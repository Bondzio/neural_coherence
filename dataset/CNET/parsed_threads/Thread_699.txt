<s> Any ideas why I can not get DBAN to boot up, and erase my hard drive? </s>
<s> I have tried it with CD and USB. </s>
<s> My system recovery discs boot in the same drive. </s>
<s> I reboot with the DBAN disc in the same drive; and it goes right into Windows. </s>
<s> I have tried every Bios boot order available, and tried a USB flash. </s>
<s> Made CD ROM my primary boot drive. </s>
<s> Made the hard drive with flash, primary boot. </s>
<s> Seems if system discs will boot, I am booting the drive ok? </s>
<s> Am I missing something. </s>
<s> It is not a perfect set-up because I am using the DVD Rom to boot, in place of a dead CD drive. </s>
<s> Even if this were the problem it seems I could boot with USB? </s>
<s> I downloaded DBAN direct from the C-net sight direct to drive, and tried next older version from the DBAN sight. </s>
<s> Still boot right past into Windows, every time. </s>
<s> My system is about 10 years old, so I was considering something to do with the version of DBAN, or something on my computer it needs to run? </s>
<s> Does not seem like it. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Rather than creating the CD from the .ISO. </s>
<s> This difference looks subtle but matters. </s>
<s> Tell the forum what you used to create this bootable CD. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I hpe you got the .ISO file and then used a proper burner like IMGBURN(free) and then in its setting used &quot;make bootable&quot; or similar. </s>
<s> I also use CDburnerXP(free) and again use the .ISO file gotten, burn it. </s>
<s> Make the CD drive the 1st boot device and it should work. </s>
<s> You can't copy files to a blank CD or anything like that, it just won't work. </s>
<s> Try this again, using the s/w I suggested it should work. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Had to look up .ISO. </s>
<s> Is that similar to a Zip file? </s>
<s> Yes I do have the ISO file only, on the boot disk I am trying to use. </s>
<s> Problem identified there. </s>
<s> I did however, just this last time, get the USB version of DBAN; and opened that one up over top of itself on the flash; and ended up with 11 separate files. </s>
<s> This did not work as a boot device either. </s>
<s> many of my attempts were directly with the ISO file I presume, aside this last one. </s>
<s> I only have the ISO file as you mention, on the primary CD, I have been trying to use. </s>
<s> Which means, I am not the only one, yippee I did try opening it on the old target machine only; but it is bare bones, and wanted to go hunting on the internet for something to open it. </s>
<s> I did not want a disk killer loose on my main machine; or I might have figured something out. </s>
<s> I guess I am using Firefox, to download into the downloads folder, or directly to the CD/USB. </s>
<s> What form, and what tools do I need here? </s>
<s> I did not notice any download instructions, perhaps I missed them : ) Do I need to open the ISO file after the download? </s>
<s> What do I open it with? </s>
<s> Then what? </s>
<s> I am sure this is the problem. </s>
<s> I can live with 2 wasted days. </s>
<s> Set me straight.please : ) Thank you moderator! </s>
<s> I think you nailed it </s>
<s> CyberLink DVD suite, seemed to come up as an option, and it burns. </s>
<s> I am preparing the boot disc on my main computer, which is not obsolete. </s>
<s> I also have HP Media Smart, Windows DVD maker also. </s>
<s> Windows 7 has a burn feature. </s>
<s> Will any of those work? </s>
<s> This process, is certainly not my normal operation; don't do much formatting, extracting, or disk killing for that matter. </s>
<s> Is this complicated, to keep people from erasing the hard drive by accident? </s>
<s> Seems a complicated way to do it; or is it just the nature of creating a bootable file, and distributing it. </s>
<s> Maybe because it is free? </s>
<s> Are there any instructions anywhere for this? </s>
<s> Seems like the days before Windows you just had a simple Dos command like C : Format, and you were good to go. </s>
<s> No such luck these days I guess? </s>
<s> Glad I am not doing this for a living, I would go broke for sure. </s>
<s> If I have to spend another day learning how to boot mode a burn; I may have the whole week done here. </s>
<s> Crazy. </s>
<s> I know ya don't make the rules, tell me what ya can . </s>
<s> Will anything I have work, or do I need to learn another program like IMGBURN? </s>
<s> Thanks Willy! </s>
<s> The programme is easy to use just put a disc in and browse to your iso file and hit burn. </s>
<s> Dafydd. </s>
<s> How about the USB version of DBAN? </s>
<s> Why didn't that work? </s>
<s> Not sure what I used to open or extract the ISO, perhaps that is the problem there. </s>
<s> Does that need some kind of software, to put the ISO image, into a useable format as well? </s>
<s> I will give IMAGBURN a shot tomorrow, burn another CD, and try again. </s>
<s> Thanks a lot! </s>
<s> I needed the help, more complicated than I thought, as simple as it might be. </s>
<s> KILDISK needed to make a bootable disc as well, obviously, for the system drive to erase; but the software would only make it in DOS mode, which did not seem to boot anything either. </s>
<s> The Free version says it will kill the system drive; but I could not get that to work.. Looks like Kildisk was a more familiar EXE. </s>
<s> file anyway. </s>
<s> I guess it burns the bootdisk for you, but not for Windows. </s>
<s> I must have done something wrong there as well. </s>
<s> This software will burn it for you. </s>
<s> You don't need to extract the iso just make sure you tick burn iso find your file and click burn. </s>
<s> Dafydd </s>
<s> Try this guide. </s>
<s> http://neosmart.net/wiki/display/G/Burning+ISO+Images+with+ImgBurn Dafydd. </s>
<s> By default, you have Cyberlink will pop-up, however you can decline that and select what pgm. </s>
<s> will do the burning. </s>
<s> You'll find IMGBURN far easier to work and it should by its own merit make a bootable disc from the .ISO file. </s>
<s> If you get Imgburn and install it, click on it and then find the .ISO file to burn, that's all there is to it. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I figured with the Malware I would at least get the program to work here. </s>
<s> Do you have to allow the Ask Jeves bar to load onto your machine also; or am I not doing something right. </s>
<s> I got IMGBURN downloaded from C-NET fine, allowed even the coupon trojan, against better judgement. </s>
<s> Then chose my USB burner, because my other burner has a raid controller I thought might complicate things. </s>
<s> Checked all the settings on the main page(alll looked good) was copying a bootable image to disc. </s>
<s> It started filling the buffer, said it was writing a lead in or such, and an hour later was still stuck at 12% no movement on anything. </s>
<s> It got hasty and told me to be patient, when I tried to shut it down(showed it got the shut down message in the log) and sat there for 10 more minutes. </s>
<s> Locked up my fresh clean machine, and I had to manual force the boot of my computer. </s>
<s> I will see if I can do a fresh install, but could do without the trojan. </s>
<s> Perhaps I missed something. </s>
<s> Any thoughts, I seem to be getting two problems for every one I don't fix. </s>
<s> I did not seem to have much trouble with the screens or navigation of IMGBURN; it just did not burn the image for me. </s>
<s> I even shut everything down while it burned, scanners and such. </s>
<s> Maybe the install did not take. </s>
<s> I hope it will uninstall easy. </s>
<s> I did a fresh download, of the latest version of DBAN used IMGBURN main screen, chose copy image to disc(first one) then chose the program at the top left using the little icon. </s>
<s> DBAN showed up as the image to copy, showed as a bootable ISO image; everything looked good, then off we went to lock up mode. </s>
<s> Something is just strange here; it can't be this hard to erase a hard drive on an old machine. </s>
<s> Should take minutes not days. </s>
<s> What next Willy, any ideas? </s>
<s> Sbybot would not update, which is very odd. </s>
<s> Ran without finding any Malware. </s>
<s> Have not run the rest of the scanners. </s>
<s> Well, it does seem you have other issues going on. </s>
<s> Since, I'm not there you have to describe as best as possible. </s>
<s> You mentioned, &quot;malware&quot; well any form of that isn't going to be good. </s>
<s> If that was already a problem prior to anything you stated before, that could be a reason for not being able to boot the CD, maybe. </s>
<s> If now its a problem, because you got new s/w and &quot;you&quot; let in, then you have complicated issues and/or all the more to clear out. </s>
<s> If you can't update your protection schemes so they have the latest defense and run anyways, it may not report finding anything because it doesn't know about the latest threats. </s>
<s> All in all, it gets difficult. </s>
<s> CAN you at least burn the s/w on another PC, a friend's or school, etc.? </s>
<s> FYI- I don't install *any* browser toolbars, any! </s>
<s> It becomes too easy for issue/problems to arise, so I decline them. </s>
<s> Even, if you don't use a browser at any given time, allowing the toolbars may have allowed other unwanted or pests to enter your system. </s>
<s> Even if not nasty, they hog resources, etc., they become a load which at times makes operations take longer or appear to hang/freeze. </s>
<s> So &quot;Ask Jeeves&quot; , i would decline, and there better be an &quot;uncheck box&quot; in order to continue the install. </s>
<s> If not, STOP and delete that pgm. </s>
<s> I wouldn't trust it. </s>
<s> So, its important to trust sources of pgms or apps to install. </s>
<s> I suggest you check out these websites: http://www.majorgeeks.com http://www.jumbo.com http://www.tucows.com http://www.sourceforge.net http://filehippo.com Even, if any of the above seem to give notice of problems, STOP and exit and delete that recent gotten pgm.. Notice, I didn't mention CNET downloads, I find it with all the problems you have now, just get from another source. </s>
<s> Alas, you needn't open the .ISO file, you direct your burning s/w to it and select it and then burn, which IMGBURN does quite well. </s>
<s> BTW, I re-read your 1st post, WHY is the dead CD drive still attached, remove or disconnect entirely. </s>
<s> make sure the DVD drive is 1st on cable or primary drive. </s>
<s> That may cause a slow response to burn. </s>
<s> On top of all this, you never supplied details of your PC brand or type. </s>
<s> 10yr. </s>
<s> PC, it is very probable that the PC doesn't allow USB boot-up, but for now I can'rt asset that. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Sound advice from Willy. </s>
<s> In the nine previous posts I see no mention of malware. </s>
<s> Do you know what this malware is and where it came from? </s>
<s> It's time to deal with this before you go on to installing DBaN. </s>
<s> Please post more details as Willy said to narrow things down. </s>
<s> Dafydd. </s>
<s> That's a senseless advice, since DBAN isn't installed. </s>
<s> It doesn't even notice there is malware on the disk. </s>
<s> All it does (when you run it from a bootable disk) is erase the drive. </s>
<s> And - if as the OP seems to have - there is a problem to burn that .iso file to a disk, it can be done on any other PC. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> So you are saying Kees that malware couldn't stop a properly burnt live DBAN disc from installing? </s>
<s> Dafydd. </s>
<s> I meant running not installing. </s>
<s> Dafydd. </s>
<s> I said that DBAN isn't installed in Windows at all. </s>
<s> It's already installed on the disk and runs from there. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> So the problem is the OP hasn't got a live disc to run on his machine? </s>
<s> Dafydd. </s>
<s> I read that he couldn't burn the disk. </s>
<s> That's why I noticed it can be burned on any other PC. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Right I'm with you now Kees, he needs to use a different computer. </s>
<s> Very confusing post isn't it. </s>
<s> Dafydd. </s>
<s> Until now. </s>
<s> I identified most of the Malware that came down with IMAGEBURN. </s>
<s> Removed it best I could. </s>
<s> The two main items were the MIXIDJ trojan Jacker; which by the way I unchecked from the instal box. </s>
<s> 100 PERCENT SURE. </s>
<s> It loaded anyway. </s>
<s> The Iminet program that instals emoticons removed after a restart, using Win add/remove. </s>
<s> No mention of that I saw, unless buried deep in the legal clause. </s>
<s> Price Gong, may be the coupon related spyware they do warn about (Required for download) Defender got that. </s>
<s> I broke some rules, to get the free-ware. </s>
<s> letting my primary virus protection down. </s>
<s> I just did not expect such a hit. </s>
<s> I was jacked, redirected, got crap-wear, toolbar, and spyware. </s>
<s> Who knows what else. </s>
<s> I removed the IMAGBURN as well; and virus protection picked up on it as malware from the place it was deleted to; and quaranteened it. </s>
<s> It was all pretty aggressive; though moderate difficulty removing. </s>
<s> Took some time. </s>
<s> Hope it did not screw anything up in my registry, or system files. </s>
<s> Will run all my scanners again soon. </s>
<s> The Malware came from the C-NET Download page for IMAGEBURN. </s>
<s> If you type IMAGBURN DOWNLOAD into your search engine; about 2-3 items down, is the cnet download page. </s>
<s> Cnet banner and familiar headings. </s>
<s> There are warnings by others I read, I just did not take them as serious as I should have. </s>
<s> Trusted the Cnet link. </s>
<s> I guess I felt lucky, figured the sight I got tech from; would be more secure. </s>
<s> At worst I figured it would be an easy to remove add-on, or program; got a bit more. </s>
<s> Total crap-ware package for sure. </s>
<s> MixiDj I think, listed as moderate threat. </s>
<s> Been a long time since I downloaded anything I was aware of; must have known I had a clean factory recovered machine laying in wait. </s>
<s> The DBAN bootdisc is not going to run on my download machine, used here and getting malware on it. </s>
<s> Once the dban bootdisc is created, it will run on the old target machine, to wipe that drive. </s>
<s> I have to get a good image burned first, because the USB method I tried on old machine, is likely not bootable on the target machine as Willy said. </s>
<s> I suppose malware could interfere with creating the boot image disc. </s>
<s> It already did, since the IMAGBURN went bust twice and caused a manual reboot of my download computer. </s>
<s> The old target computer is not even on-line. </s>
<s> I am preparing the boot-disc with my current computer that replaced the old one, about 2.5 years ago. </s>
<s> Then use the created bootdisk to wipe the old drive, so I can use it someplace else. </s>
<s> Sorry for any confusion. </s>
<s> Probably my fault, once I have been at this a while. </s>
<s> Oh dear you have been a naughty boy! </s>
<s> Where did you download imgburn from. </s>
<s> It should have been http://www.imgburn.com/ I've checked the site and its clean. </s>
<s> Back to basics, in your last post you almost made the cd from the iso you mit want to try it on another computer. </s>
<s> Dafydd. </s>
<s> Not yet. </s>
<s> There are a few tangents with the old machine complicating things. </s>
<s> First tangent, the OP has never erased a hard drive before, yet owned a computer since the DOS days. </s>
<s> Imagine that. </s>
<s> Second tangent, is an old computer with some limitations. </s>
<s> I just want to erase the drive; but it got more fun. </s>
<s> Since a computer is a cascade of sequences; one problem creates 2 more. </s>
<s> Read above, I think you will all follow better. </s>
<s> Just read your prior post. </s>
<s> Yes that's the way to go, use the link I gave in previous post to download the iso. </s>
<s> Dafydd. </s>
<s> Should have been download imgburn Dafydd. </s>
<s> http://download.cnet.com/ImgBurn/3000-2646_4-10847481.html Impulse gots the best of me </s>
<s> I checked the cnet link you clicked on and it take you to softwareinformer.com. </s>
<s> Having researched that site it seems dodgy. </s>
<s> The link I gave is the direct download for imgburn. </s>
<s> I have downloaded from ther with no problems. </s>
<s> Dafydd. </s>
<s> Good news, I am now running DBAN on the target computer, and erasing the target hard-drive. </s>
<s> Yippee! </s>
<s> Major geeks sight triggered something, that antivirus picked up. </s>
<s> FileHippo got it done clean. </s>
<s> Man am I snakebitten here; I have got a bad external DVD burner just showing up on my download machine; unless the CD's are just too old. </s>
<s> I don't burn many CD's mostly DVD's.... but have been using this drive all along the last month and a half. </s>
<s> Loading and reloading all the system disks, new drivers, and all the software back on my good computer. </s>
<s> Guess I wore it out. </s>
<s> It just decided to go. </s>
<s> On top of that, I got a real screwed up CD out of my stack here; which is scratched all around the center beyond where it seems the spindle would reach. </s>
<s> Just the last attempt, no big deal diagnosing this. </s>
<s> I am deffinately blind missing that cut up disc. </s>
<s> I am not making sense of that. </s>
<s> I would never put that back in the stack, and never had a drive go bad to cause it; so it must be bad from the 100 pack it came from a long time ago; or my failing external burner on the download machine did it. </s>
<s> Not likely, didn't hear anything. </s>
<s> I guess I will find out when I open the burner up to see. </s>
<s> I am sure it needs a good cleaning anyway. </s>
<s> It is not like I have a bunch old junk here on the new machine; but I do operate in a strange environment, harsh to the hardware. </s>
<s> Nothing I can do about it though. </s>
<s> Thanks for all the help an patience. </s>
<s> Keeping my fingers crossed. </s>
<s> Will post back when the drive is erased; and get back to the DVR phase (Willy) </s>
<s> Run DBAN from a flash drive =) Usually works when CD doesn't! </s>
<s> Enjoy </s>
<s> I probably need to read the CNET mission statement, or profile. </s>
<s> Are you saying these download pages, are randomly created by users who post them; or the sight page was maliciously redirected? </s>
<s> I guess I was thinking some form of staff, or moderator generated these download links. </s>
<s> I presume they must be user generated, by your response. </s>
<s> There must be a simple was to save and generate a shared download link then, by users? </s>
<s> Using a default CNET page generation. </s>
<s> No Genie behind a desk. </s>
<s> Pretty sure the flash is not bootable. </s>
<s> I did try that towards the end. </s>
<s> It would not boot from flash. </s>
<s> I got that download from a CNET link as well; so not sure; but it seemed to download ok. Just would not boot the machine no matter what boot sequence I tried. </s>
<s> USB is not listed by itself under Bios(only in the sub menu for teh hard drive) and it would not change position in the boot sequence. </s>
<s> Old computer. </s>
<s> Nothing malicious, my point was it's always better to download directly rather than using a mirror site. </s>
<s> On the Cnet download page under the big download button there is an option to do this. </s>
<s> How is the disc erasure going? </s>
<s> Dafydd. </s>
<s> About seven hours on my slow DVDROM, and machine, hard drive seems to be erased?. </s>
<s> Since my target computer had only a DVDROM, running the DBAN boot disc; I was not able to figure a way to get any log. </s>
<s> Half way through, it sped up, and there were no errors. </s>
<s> But I guess maybe some errors were found while erasing over night? </s>
<s> Or Not? </s>
<s> The screen showing after the nuke, said the following : DBAN FINISHED WITH NON-FATAL ERRORS.....THEN SAYS TO CHECK THE LOG..........THEN THE START AND RUN TIMES......THEN * Fail ATA Disk WDC 320AAJB-0 00.0 298GB WD-WCARW6607672 Then in bold red letters it says KILLED (as the last line showing). </s>
<s> Reboot of the computer, could not find operating system. </s>
<s> DO I HAVE A NUKED DRIVE, READY FOR FORMATING AND USE-OR DO I STILL HAVE PROBLEMS? </s>
<s> I am getting a convertor cable to allow me to plug the drive into my USB, on the good working computer; then I can perhaps run a check DISK, look for any bad sectors, or format the drive. </s>
<s> Should I do this? </s>
<s> Do I need to? </s>
<s> Before I start the next step; getting my DVR to recognize the nuked drive, formatting, and cloning. </s>
<s> Probably should start a new thread for that, I guess. </s>
<s> A sense of humor lightens up any cursing, and rage : ) I found this humorous, no ill will. </s>
