http://www.amazon.com/Virtual-5-1-surround-External-Sound-Card/dp/B000N35A0Y highlights why we must match RAM with the A10.
Keep in mind this was done with the A10-5800K I'd look to the 6800K just because of the occasional FPS render time slowdown, http://semiaccurate.com/2013/06/04/amd-brings-richland-to-the-desktop-the-a10-6800k/ shows a good graph and the 6800K would be my choice along with a pair of high speed memory sticks IF I wanted to do this on a budget.
