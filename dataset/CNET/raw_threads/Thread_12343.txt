What OS are you running? Some will fail in a reinstall of XP and simply create a dual boot. Editing the Boot.ini file will solve the problem. http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=289022

YOu at least have to tell us what OS you are trying to install, and a lot more info about the environment is also needed. With many OS's you can wipe the drive and repartition it during install, others you need to format the drive, but you give us nothing to go on. How many hard drives in the system?

I accidentally installed it there when I was doing a re-install. I formatted that drive, but it still asks me to choose between the two &quot;Microsoft Windows XP Professional&quot; OS's. But it's only on my C drive. The D drive has nothing on it. Hope this clears up the confusion. Clint

When you first get into the XP install have it Delete the partition on C and recreate it (do a Quick format). With both of those steps you should be able to eliminate the problem.
