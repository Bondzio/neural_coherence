robert, pretty much pointed out buy brand name discs.
don't be cheap maybe on a sale or two, buy what you need.
i tend to favor philips and teac though many other names do fine.
dvds are in the 4.7gb range for now, unless you get into blu-ray, etc., but that's a costly alternative.
for now unless you got globs of data to store, std.
dvd will do fine.
remember to treat critical dvds like your new born, with care.
besides writing the data, be sure to verify!
