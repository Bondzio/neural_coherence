but it appears you are not aware why these can run from cheap to not cheap or why you usual can't retrofit unless you void the maker's warranty.
there are only a few gps chip makers so that can't be your real question.
i'm fine if you just come out and ask but writing a tutorial about product testing, passing fcc certifications and more must be limited to one short paragraph.
