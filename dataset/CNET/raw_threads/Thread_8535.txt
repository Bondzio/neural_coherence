Hi all, Here is the senario, Planing to share a 1MB ADSL line with 4 neighbours at least 100mts apart from each others VIA wireless. I was designing the network with a Linksys WAG200G ADSL Router and 3 Linksys Access-Points. Would the above idea be a good choice for the routers and the access-points. Are there better routers with excellent distance of coverage. For a 1MB ADSL line will the Linksys WAG200G Router be enough? Thanks in advance.

These are not very strong signal transmitters, and distance, walls, and other dvices on the 2.4GHz waveband can interfere with the reception. A better solution would be wire to the other houses.
