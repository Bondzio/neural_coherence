I could install a filter that denied such in the router for a specific PC.
Not that I'll duplicate the manual but in the router you reserve IP addresses for those machines that need blocking (so we can use DHCP) then for those IPs we block sites outside our LAN.
-&gt; Your IT staffer should be able to do this.
If not, talk to HR on how to replace them.
