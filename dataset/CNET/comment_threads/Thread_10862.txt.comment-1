Hi, I am a little new to networking, so please be patient with me.
Well, I have a desktop computer running XP pro with 1 ethernet jack which is connected to a DSL modem.
I have a laptop which is running 98 with 1 ethernet jack.
Is there a way I can simultaneously let both computers acess the internet?
If you require any info please, just ask.
Thanx Ibrahim Jadoon
