if you growth rate or needs are simple, then keep the system simple.
the nas will do what you want.
however, you limited in expansion, up to a point.
any decent system can have the nas added, as for any true server needs, then you must look at the whole system to match what you want to do.
you can look at some outside network service and allow them to host you and your cause.
that way, the expertise is on their end and all you provide is the content.
of course this costs, but it doesn't hurt to see what it involves.
good luck -----willy
