did you ever find a solution to your question?
i have the same questions.
does anyone out there know of ways to have a laptop get internet access in a park or on a lake or in a car?
the cell co's are expensive and need monthly service plans, and what if you're not near their towers?
do they &quot;roam&quot; like a cell phone and use other co's towers?
what about a satellite company like he asks about.
anyone know who the &quot;satellite&quot; companies are?
(not for putting a dish in home/office, but for when outside or travelling!)
thanks!
