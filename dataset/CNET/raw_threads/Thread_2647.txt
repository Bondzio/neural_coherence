In either configuring a new desktop PC or purchasing a pre-configured desktop PC; which is considered to be better? A desktop PC having a CDRW/DVDRW combo drive or a desktop PC having two separate drives such as a CDRW in one drive and a DVDRW in a second drive? Comments from anyone would certainly be appreciated.

One reason for this is so disks can be duplicated by copying directly to the burner and bypass the need to copy to the HD first. I't just my personal choice.

Since a DVDROM drive can do all a CDROM can do and more, that may be in the second bay for easy CD dupes. Bob

My experience tells me that a simple CDROM drive is much more capable of reading scratched or otherwise &quot;damaged&quot; disks than a writer or a combo. I find that utilities like CDR Diagnostics, ISO buster etc are able to handle a wider range of the so called dead CD's in a simple CDROM drive than in other combined drive/writers. As far as DVD's go, I'm not ready to make any observation as of now.
740	4	61881	734073	734028	R. Proffitt	2/2/05 6:59 AM	1.10732754E12	YMMV!	I've found CDRW drives to be more adept at reading so-so CDs. My experience with the newer DVDRW drives is &quot;not enough time yet&quot; to write if I feel the same for them. Bob
