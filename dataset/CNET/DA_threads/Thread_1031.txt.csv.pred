1.1.1	Not sure if this is the best part of the forum to post this but just today I switched on my computer ( running Vista H.Premium ) and it appeared to get stuck on the screen with the green loading bar that goes across with Microsoft Corporation written beneath it .	St
1.1.2	The bar was still going across but nothing was loading .	St
1.1.3	On some other forum sites I found that the problem could be something related to the HDD having major problems .	St
1.1.4	I eventually had to manually switch off the computer and then booted it back up again .	St
1.1.5	When I was prompted I chose the option to start Windows normally .	St
1.1.6	This time it booted fine .	St
1.1.7	Is this a sign that my hard drive is beginning to fail ?	Ques
1.1.8	Or was it just a random windows typical failure ?	Ques
1.1.9	The computer is only about 1 year old and I only installed sp1 about a week ago .	St
1.1.10	Thanks -- Jono --	St
1.2.1	Most Vista machines are still under warranty .	St
1.2.2	Call it in so you wo n't pay for this one .	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	You do n't want to know how much it costs out of warranty .	St
1.5.1	well a 250gb SATA HDD costs about $ 180 USD and Acronis True image costs $ 50 USD .	St
1.5.2	So can I : Add the new hard drive as a slave drive and copy all the files over from the Master .	St
1.5.3	Make it bootable then keep that hard drive handy , and if the other one ever goes , just plug it in and boot from it .	St
1.5.4	If I can do that , $ 230 USD is an 'OK ' amount to spend .	St
1.5.5	All I want to really know is & quot ; Is the drive likely to die anytime soon ? & quot ; .	St
1.6.1	See if they have a HD fitness test program .	St
