Now, what can I do with this? Currently I'm thinking a few options: 1) Make it a bootable drive for emergency rescue operations. But, which OS / distro? Is there an OS that can fit within 64mb? 2) Install Windows portable apps on it. Thinking of Abiword for sure, what other useful apps you think can fit on it?

What I did boot was Ubuntu and it did run Abiword https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AbiWord . Ubuntu is less than 1GB which leaves you a lot of open space. Bob

Actually they had to gift something on Doctor's day, and apparently they came out with this brilliant idea of 64mb flash drive (don't know where they purchased them from). Now 64mb is a great size for carrying documents and even pictures (like patient x-ray jpegs etc), but I'm going to use my 8GB flash drive for that purpose. It's the smallest flash drive I've ever had, and I really want to experiment with it, in that how much &quot;usefulness&quot; can fit into it.
