1.1.1	I just ordered a & quot ; Western Digital My Book Home Edition External Hard Drive 500 GB , USB 2.0 , FireWire 400 , eSATA & quot ; http : //www.wdc.com/en/products/products.asp ? driveid=355 & language=en I want to go eSATA since I have a motherboard that supports sata - Intel Desktop Board D915GAG http : //download.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/d915gag/sb/c6860002.pdf I currently have installed an internal 200gb sata hd .	St
1.1.2	I was hoping I could just install a sata-esata adapter cable and plug in the new hd and that would be that .	St
1.1.3	Something tells me it 's not going to be so simple , and I have a feeling I 'm going to need a pci card .	St
1.1.4	So can I just install the sata-esata adapter cable or do I need a pci card ( any references/links to where I can purchase a good cable or card would be helpful ) .	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	It depend on how you want things done .	St
1.3.2	What data cable comes with the external drive ?	Ques
1.3.3	Internal or external ?	Ques
1.4.1	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16812119021 VAPCMD	Ques
1.5.1	USB cable , FireWire cable .	St
1.5.2	Of course , I want to get the best performance so I guess I 'll buy/put it the sata-esata bracket .	St
1.5.3	Again my question is : is the bracket all I need to get the best performance or do I need a card ?	Ques
1.6.1	I deal with lost data on drives from the public and have to come down with & quot ; never & quot ; for firewire and a Windows PC .	St
1.6.2	You are more than welcome to try it but my experiences is either it works fine then someday it just loses it all .	St
1.6.3	Stick with the sata or USB plus a damage resistant file system ( FAT32 is out ! )	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	Thanks for replying .	St
1.7.2	Maybe you can clear things up for me .	St
1.7.3	I notice they sell PCIxpress cards that will give you xtrnal esata port/s .	St
1.7.4	Is this for those whose motherboard/hdcontrollers do n't have an xtra connector for the bracket .	St
1.7.5	Or is the PCIxpress card for better hd performancs ?	Ques
1.8.1	Thanks for the tip about FAT32 , the drive comes with it preformatted .	St
1.8.2	I guess the first thing I 'll do is reformat it into one big NTFS partition ( it 's a 500gb drive ) with the XP disk management utility .	St
1.8.3	I 'm not sure about what will be the best partition size/s .	Res
1.8.4	I 'll be using this new xtrnl drive to keep a complete backup of my 200gb internal drive , as well as for the xtra storage .	St
1.8.5	Any suggestions would be appreciated , thanks !	Polite
1.9.1	You would really only need a PCI SATA or perhaps a PCIe SATA controller if there were't any free SATA ports on the MB or the MB SATA interface was n't fast enough for the external HDD .	St
1.9.2	Not sure you 'd see a big difference either way .	St
1.9.3	Some of the newer , higher-end MBs have external SATA ports .	St
1.9.4	For those that do n't ... something like what I recommended is a great alternative .	St
1.9.5	Let us know ... it worked well for me .	St
1.9.6	VAPCMD	St
1.10.1	Well I finally got an esata bracket ( kinda hard to find ) , installed the cables to the motherboard and connected the rest of the esata cables , and the bios ( and consequently XP ) does n't see the new drive .	St
1.10.2	This is the Intel bios ( ver AG91510J.15A.0816.2005.0214.1818 02/14/2005 ) .	St
1.10.3	Is the bios suppose to detect the new hd automatically ?	Ques
1.10.4	Can not figure out how to manually enter values for new hd .	St
1.10.5	Drive works fine in firewire mode ( remember its a Western Digital My Book Home Edition External Hard Drive ) .	St
1.11.1	So power on the drive before booting the computer .	St
1.12.1	Tried that , still does n't see it .	St
1.12.2	Do you think upgradeing the bios might help ?	Ques
1.12.3	( I 'm not sure if they have an upgrade ) .	St
1.13.1	try another another connection if you have more than 2. or maybe switch with the internal drive connection just to if it get recognize .	Sug
1.14.1	bios does n't see it no matter what sata mobo connector is used , even the one the internal drive is using .	St
1.14.2	Any sure way to test the cable ( s ) ?	Ques
1.14.3	Else maybe I 'll try to find a cable that connects directly from mobo to my extrnl drive , just to test things out ( I tried the cable from my mobo to my internal drive but that does n't work ) .	St
1.14.4	If I install an eSata pci card ( which provide esata connections ) will the bios be forced to see it ?	Ques
1.15.1	Sounds like the problem lies with the connection , cable , or the external harddrive itself or maybe the external power supply .	St
1.15.2	Of course the quickest way to test it out would be to connect the drive to another computer .	St
1.16.1	The drive works fine in firewire mode .	St
1.16.2	I need to find somebody near with a working esata port .	St
