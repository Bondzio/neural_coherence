hi i have just recieved a hp photosmart 2610 printer and i want to connect it to my wireless network.
it has and ethernet port so i decided i would connect my ethanet to wireless bridge d-link to the printer and then connect it straight to my home network.
i have a belkin router/modem with wep security ect.
i also have the hp networking guide and cd rom however all my laptops are vista so it wont work.also once i get it hooked up to the network how do i get it to apear on all my laptops.
if any other information is needed just ask.
thanks tom
