You will need to select the drive, usually by a wizard of some type that pops up, or in the case of my games that are on the External drive, any updates to a particular game that I download is automatically sent to that game on the External drive.
Another method of external drive....
I bought a new in box 'Retail' Western Digital 80GB, 8MB, 7200 RPM Internal Hard Drive some months ago only because of the special sale at Office Max for $19.95 after rebates.
My current WinXP desktop has aprx 485,000 files and the 100GB HD is 80% full, so instead of installing the additional WD Internal Drive to the Tower, going thru the hassle of that procedure and taking juice from the PC power supply, I'm thinking of purchasing a $25-$35 External Drive Box to place it in and use the USB 2.0 connection to the PC, and the 110V wall plug to the box.
(long run-on sentence eh).
