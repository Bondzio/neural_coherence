1.1.1	I am new to wireless networking and a somewhat slow learner .	St
1.1.2	I use an ADSL broadband service and have a home network of two desktop computers , one running WinXP Home Edition , and the other runs Win98se .	St
1.1.3	I have installed a Netgear modem/router DG834G , and Netgear PCI Adapters WG311 v3 in each computer .	St
1.1.4	The setup is working , more by good luck than management , I think !	St
1.1.5	How do I setup the router firewall and WEP or WPA now , with the router as it is in the centre of the house , and each pc approx .	St
1.1.6	65 feet distant in other rooms ?	Ques
1.1.7	Previously my network used ICS , and the XP gateway machine was connected to the 98se machine with a cat5 crossover cable .	St
1.1.8	I used the XP firewall on the gateway pc , and ran an AV program on each , together with the usual clutch of anti parasite apps .	St
1.1.9	Of course , the gateway machine had to be running before the other machine was able to go online .	St
1.1.10	Now that the router is an Access Point , and each machine can go online independently of the other , I believe that I should set up the router firewall , to protect them both .	St
1.1.11	I fear that the router will need to be physically connected to a computer to do this .	St
1.1.12	Is this correct please ?	Ques
1.2.1	setup page from one of the wireless PC 's , there is no need to hardwire .	St
1.2.2	Enter the routers configuration via your web browser , and make your security adjustments .	Sug
1.2.3	The manual will have the lowdown , but some of the basic security settings I use are : 1 ) MAC address filtering 2 ) change the routers default name and password 3 ) disable SSID 4 ) enable either WEP or WPA Depending on your proximity to other WiFi networks or neighbors will determine how many of these options you use .	St
1.3.1	At the moment there are no neighbours using wireless , or at least they are not visible to me , so I am not worried about anyone piggybacking .	St
1.3.2	Could you tell me how I can address and configure the router via a computer browser .	Ques
1.3.3	I suppose that I need to type in the router 's IP address , which I am not sure how to obtain ?	Ques
1.4.1	as well as on Netgear 's site : http : //kbserver.netgear.com/products/dg834gv2.asp but I believe the login address is routerlogin or 192.168.1.1	St
1.5.1	Yes Michael , the router address is 192.168.0.1 and the user name & quot ; admin & quot ; with the password & quot ; password & quot ; .	St
1.5.2	This got me on the track for the modem/router configuration , and I must say I am impressed with the Netgear interface .	St
