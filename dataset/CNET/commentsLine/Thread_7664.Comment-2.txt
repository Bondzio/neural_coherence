that's sad for now...from a consumer point of view it really makes ipad useless, but html5, h.264 are the future.
flash overheats your tablet, doesn't support touch based devices and eats your battery life.
webmasters should really move on...anyways someone had to make this step, and youtube,vimeo, netflix, apple and many big names made it.
