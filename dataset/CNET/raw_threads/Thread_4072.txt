Does Apple offer any type of test drive program, where you can sort of rent a machine try it for a certain amount of time and return it back to Apple. I am interested in a Macbook but I would love a chance to explore the hardware and more importantly Mac OS 10 before taking the plunge into switching from a Windows based enviroment to a Macintosh in at least my laptop.

I find it a little difficult to believe that you have done &quot;a few searches online&quot; and turned up nothing. My Google search for &quot;Computer Rentals&quot; turned up over 10 pages of hits for companies that rent computers. Check it out. P
