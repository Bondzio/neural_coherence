...however, it was the high-end previous generation card.
the x1300/x1600 are current generation cards; the x1300 is the low-end card, and the x1600 is the mid-range card.
the high-end current generation cards are the x1800 and x1900.
you'll notice that the card names all have suffixes, such as the ati radeon x1900xtx.
i won't get too deep into the suffixes; i'll tell you that xt is better than pro, and gto is better than gt.
i could also get into the crossfire dual video card stuff, but i don't feel like it.
