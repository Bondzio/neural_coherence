You see, If I get a HDD upgrade, won't I lose all my current data? I would'nt mind getting a External HDD but I feel it would take up too much space. I only have a tiny table on this desk. All suggestions appreciated. -Larry

It will clone an existing drive to a new drive. You install the software, then power off and install the drive as slave. On bootup the software detects the new drive and will then (after a few prompts) copy/clone the new drive making a mirror image of the old drive. Everything is saved. You then remove the old drive, set the new drive to master and reboot. I've used it many times. If you're running XP you will probably be asked to reactivate but it's painless.

An external, USB connected HDD doesn't have to occupy prime, desktop real estate. I believe the limit would be approximately 25' (USB connector cable)...
