Hi we are looking to get a new PC would anybody be able to advise if we should get HP Pavilion All in One MS210 or perhaps Dell Inspiron One 19 - we need it mainly for sufing the internet, downloading itunes, photos and the odd letter writing.
Ideally something basic and not complicated to use - any advice would be much appreciated
