The recovery cd probably has an older version on it.
Go to Sony's website and download the updated version and install it.
Hang in there.
The fact that the play button is deactivated tells me the software is not recognizing that particular dvd as playable.
This could be either a hardware or software issue.
Let us know.
and life goes on... Jack
