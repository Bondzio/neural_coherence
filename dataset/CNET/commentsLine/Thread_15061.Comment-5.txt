ati just has never been good for me in general its more of a preference to use nvidea.
ive had many nvidea card and they all functioned perfectly for me.
the 4870 was my first ati and its just missing something that i like from nvidea.
ive been looking at the gtx 200 series but i really dont know what the prices will look like in a few months with the 300 series coming out
