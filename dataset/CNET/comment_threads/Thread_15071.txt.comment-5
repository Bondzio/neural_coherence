yeah the only version I have is the original, have to DL SP2 after installing (which I've now done) I had planned to install partition manager to check on the size.
However this really isn't a problem for me right now, I'm more concerned with my brand new 6750 CPU running at less than 2GHz and 333FSB.
Any ideas?
