i have two hard drives, one floppy drive, one cd rom drive and one cd/rw drive.
is it possible to hook up a zip drive using a 3 device ribbon cable.
i would like to put it on the same ribbon cable as the two cd roms i have now.
the zip drive was given to me and works fine.
i just do not want to loose a cd rom or hard drive in order to hook it up.
