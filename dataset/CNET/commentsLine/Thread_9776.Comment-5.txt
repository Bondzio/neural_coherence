you might want to give a color laser more thought.
the color image quality won't be true photo quality, but will still be adequate depending on your needs (the black and white will be superior).
my color laser cost me just over $200.
i use after-market cartidges which have been just fine for me.
i pay just over $100 to replace all four cartridges.
they last for two thousand color pages, twenty-five hundred black pages; for me, that's years.
it works out to one penny per page b/w and four cents a page for color.
for me, it was a no-brainer.
you can always keep a second inkjet for those few times when you want photo quality.
personally, i just use costco or shutterfly for those times.
