i had the same error on my dell optiplex 240, 1.5mhz, 256mb, 80gig, win2000 pro system, when i tried to install the pinnacle studio av/dv card on my system.
i talked with dell support as well as pinnacle support, basically had already tried what they told me to try, different pci slots and taking all cards out that i could except that one and configuration setup to no avail.
ended up taking it back to best buy for a refund!
so much for those tech support people reading it from a manual.
they were no help.
i'am finding out that here on cnet and myself are the best tech support.
