I have an awr-8210 router and I want to play WoW. I THINK I have opened the right ports correctly, but it stops and gives me a 'firewall installed' message a few minutes into download. I have tried with my COMODO off, so eliminated that. Could anyone tell me what else I can try, Help with this will make me very happy!
