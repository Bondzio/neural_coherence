Ata outlets; Athlon 64-bit single core 3500+ CPU; Antec Truepower 450 watt powr suply; W2k Pro with a service pack (4 I Think) on Seagate 7200 S.Ata. I got a K Ubuntu on a disc, and I want to get another HdD to play with this Linux. I favor seagate and like the Barracuda line. QUESTION: I think 80 gig is all I need, but for very little more $$ I can have 120 or 250 gig. So does that bigger HdD respond slower than the smaller?? And are there factors about that bigger HdD that U might expect a shorter life?? Thnx

An 80 on the shelf was 69 bucks. Your choice here but there is some urban rumor that big drives have some early failures. I'll disagree and just write that with bigger drives people tend to lose more when a mistake happens. Bob

Maybe I will go ahead and order a 120. Newegg had one on special with shipping free. The way I operate, I don't fill one up very fast. Ol Rod

And I have not really found them any less reliable, however it is difficult to determine because as hard drives have gotten larger, computers in general are accessing the drives more than ever and people are working the drives harder with streaming music, video and constant nightly virus and spyware scans. So in general the failure rate has gone up due to use. As long as you are comparing appples to apples. Same RPM and same size cache you should be all set. However, avoid some specific drives that I have found to be unreliable such as the Maxtor ATA133 80 and 100 gig drives. If 80 gig is all you need and you really want to increase performance you might find a good deal on the Western Digital Raptor 74 gig drives. These 10,000 rpm drives are really fast. Good luck

I have three PCs, the oldest bought Nov 1997, it has two 7,200 RPM SCSI drives - still going strong. I have another PC bought June 2001, it had an 18 GByte 15,000 RPM SCSI drive - it failed. I replaced it with a 36 GByte 15,000 RPM SCSI - it failed about a month ago. I replaced it with a 160 GByte ATA drive. My newest PC bought May 2003, has a 36 Gbyte 10,000 RPM SCSI drive - still running. ALl PCs are on almost 24/7 It seems, in my case rotation speed is the killer.

The closer the info is packed, the less distance the HD heads have to travel to read / write data. This often makes bigger drives faster. 2) Bigger drives may be a newer &quot;generation&quot; of drives, which means performance improvements in the new generation are built in. Caveat: A bigger drive may be bigger because of multiple platters rather than higher density. In such a case, bigger won't mean faster. Regarding reliability: Some say the very newest (and highest density) drives are a little less reliable since the bugs aren't worked out. But I've never seen hard data that proves this is true. As a rule of thumb, buy the most gigabytes your budget will allow. You won't regret having &quot;too much space&quot; in a year or two.

With a 300gb drive for $99, I say buy 2, an inexpensive RAID1 pci card, and consider yourself better protected than 99% of the population. As someone who has had harddrives crash personally as well as helped people with their crashes, I ask: Is $100 too much to pay for insurance that you won't lose any data if a crash happens? However, if YOU delete the files or get a virus, the second drive will not help you. This is not a backup, it is an exact copy down to the smallest bit including all viruses. If you want to additionally do backups, that is another choice altogether.

After decades I've found RAID 1 to save one person but in all other cases the corruption or accidental file deletion immediately was mirrored on the other drive and the persons lost it all in milliseconds. In all cases save that one lone occurance a simpler backup copy of the drive would have saved them. Bob

I am retired, just sorta play at computer, I do not game. Yes, I considered Raptor for a while, decided not worth the premium price to me. Since my first post, have already bought 200 gig Seagate. I will post more at bottom of page, Thank you for gettin in conversation. Ol Rod

Proffitt's first reply, I went ahead and ordered a 200 gig Seagate barracuda ST3200826AS from NewEgg. Little brown truck delivered it today, I waited for the delivery to post back. I chose that one because they had free shipping on it. Also, this is the last of an older line that they call SATA 150 , The newest line does something they call &quot;perpendicular&quot; recording. I was thinking along with the poster that said sometimes the first of the new may not be as dependable as the last of the old. Now, I got a new Hd and new OS to play with and gotta go. Thanks, All !!

If you are looking for better disk performance, pay attention to the spindle speed as much as anything else. Disks that turn 10,000 rpm are faster (about 2x) than 7,200 rpm drives. Yes, they do cost more but if you want a faster disk drive, the metric to pay attention to is not size. It is spindle speed. RAID 1 across 4 drives is the fastest typical PC disk configuration. It is substantially faster than a single disk and noticeably faster than a pair.
11785	13	210033	2249149	2248795	SibTiger	10/6/06 9:49 PM	1.16017134E12	RE: Density isn't what dictates a hard drive access speed!!	Obviously RPMs play a much bigger role in drive speed. But density does have an effect on speed. Compare drive speeds of higher density drives vs lower density at same RPMs.

The older ATA 100 drives have been going and going with no failed drives for probably six years. I am not sure that SATA is ready or if we just got a bunch over the last year from the same batch of bad quality drives. This may help you decide to go with a more tested and reliable technology but in the specs it is slower spindle speed will not show up to the end users but bus speed may (slower may be faster in the long run if your drive fails). ATA 100/133 still makes pretty big drives. Check you mother board for compatibility.

We have installed about thirty of these drive within the last two years and had only one failure. I'd be curious as to which hard drive manufacturer is providing the SATA drives ie. Maxtor, Seagate, etc.

What is the deal with CACHE does having more make it quicker? What one do you think I should get? Thank you in advanced for your response.
