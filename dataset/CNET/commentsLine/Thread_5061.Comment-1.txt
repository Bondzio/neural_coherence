so i just got a motherboard to work with, and i need some help with its graphics.
it is a socket 775 motherboard, with a pentium d, 3.4 ghz.
first of all, its a 24-pin power supply slot in the motherboard, but i only have a 20-pin power supply connected.
i've read that that shouldn't be a problem as long as i don't use any pci cards, thus i haven't used any.
however... everything is hooked up as it should be, and it powers on and everything, but my monitor remains in standby mode.
i tried to turn it off, and turn it back on, and that didn't work.
i have no clue why the integrated graphics aren't working.
does anyone else know?
so after this all happened, i put in a graphics card.
however, the graphics slot is pcie x16, and the only card that i have that will fit is a dual-dvi-e. no problem, i just bought a dvi to vga converter.
so i put that in, plug it all in, and it still doesn't work!
this is driving me crazy, and i need to come up with a solution quick because this is my dads main computer.
