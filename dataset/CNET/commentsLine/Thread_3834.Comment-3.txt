i've found ecs mtrbds.
trouble at times for no reason at all.
your model was a hot one as it was cheaply offered when it came out and very affordable against other brand offering.
ok, i suggest you use the mtrbd.
install cd and load the drivers for the audio portion.
in some cases a &quot;newer&quot; driver is available from ecs support website get it for your model(verify).
don't rely on the os to provide the driver as the mtrbd.
driver that os is usually a better install, but if it works, it works.
if after all is said and done, it still fails, check the device mgr., are there any red/yellow flags?
if so, reload driver from the device line item to correct.
make sure also, that the &quot;audio&quot; is enabled under bios area and/or proper connection is being made.
also, in the os, check to see if the audio hasn't been &quot;muted&quot;.
those are areas to look at... good luck -----willy
