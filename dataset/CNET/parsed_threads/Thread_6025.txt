<s> Hey All, I'm in the process of upgrading my Dell PC and I have a couple questions about compatability. </s>
<s> I had hoped to buy Asus's new SLI capable motherboard to run two Nvidia 6800 OC PCI express cards. </s>
<s> I also have an upgraded power supply. </s>
<s> What else to I need to purchase in order to get my system up and running? </s>
<s> Thanks, M. Walsh </s>
<s> One major problem with OEM systems like Dell, Gateway, etc., is when you decide to replace the mtrbd. </s>
<s> The physical size and location of mountings may not be proper or outright not compatible as a direct replacement. </s>
<s> What this means is you have to verify any replacement mtrbd. </s>
<s> is rated or designed to be one for your Dell system, otherwise don't expect an easy drop-in and proceed forward w/o extra effort. </s>
<s> I suppose you were trying to re-use the Dell case? </s>
<s> If not and plan to buy or have access to a generic of DYI case source, then you're OK. Last, don't expect the OS to be transferable, it may but it may not. </s>
<s> The OEM supplied OS is prone to work only what it was sold with, however Dell is more flexible than others, but again, I can't say for your model, 100% sure. </s>
<s> enjoy -----Willy </s>
<s> I actually have an extra case that i can use to transfer my system to so that wouldnt be a problem. </s>
<s> My main concern is the processors compatability with a new motherboard. </s>
<s> It would be nice to be able to pick up a new PCI express motherboard and grapics card and not have to drop $1000 on a new AMD processor. </s>
<s> CPUs, can be swapped amongest other mtrbds. </s>
<s> provided they're supported. </s>
<s> The cpu type, model and/or class is best described by the mtrbd. </s>
<s> specs and what it entails. </s>
<s> You should have available new heatsink compound to use as the old may not work well once the seal is broken from removing the HSF and then cpu. </s>
<s> I've done this mucho times and rarely have a problem. </s>
<s> Beware, though proper handling procedures from ESD(static) should be followed plus proper ordination into cpu socket. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> The Asus is ONLY for AMD64 939 pin. </s>
<s> When all you keep from your old machine is the Power Supply and drives, that's not an upgrade, it's a whole new machine. </s>
<s> And SLI is just for bragging anyway. </s>
<s> Why spend an extra $500 for a 8% bump in framerates. </s>
<s> You wont even be able to tell it's working cuz a single 6800 OC is enough to turn all eyecandy to full anyway. </s>
<s> There is no SLI for P4 so you have to: 1. </s>
<s> Buy AMD proc or 2. </s>
<s> REthink SLI I don't know if your 8250 had DDR or DDR2 ram. </s>
<s> Hopefully not DDR2 cuz thats only for P4. </s>
<s> Maybe if you gave your Proc speed, ram size and number of DIMMs we could find a path for you. </s>
