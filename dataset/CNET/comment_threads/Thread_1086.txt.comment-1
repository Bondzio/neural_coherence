I could really use some advice here.
I'm planning on keeping this computer for years (5+).
Is this a good computer for gaming (would be be able to run today's games at acceptable speeds?).
And feed back would be appreciated.
Also, how are these i7 processors and am I getting good value for this price?
Are Dells reliable enough to last me 5 years?
It also says this computer comes with a free upgrade to Windows 7, will this computer be able to handle Windows 7?
And the reason why I said quick in the title is because I don't want to sale to end, not to be a dick.
