<s> i'm looking to buy a monitor for my new Aurora, and i was wondering if anybody knows anything about the company Asus. </s>
<s> i've never heard of them, but they seem to get good reviews. </s>
<s> Today's laptops usually have VGA and many have HDMI. </s>
<s> I suggest HDMI to save you some newbie troubles. </s>
<s> However since you didn't supply the exact model number I can't be exact about the interface. </s>
<s> In closing, do not buy a monitor on SPEC. </s>
<s> Go see it. </s>

<s> Read the Feedback on both. </s>
<s> While my advice is from experience if you can't find it in stores to look at, both look safe given the Feedback from buyers at those links. </s>
