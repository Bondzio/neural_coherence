This laptop is Toshiba Satellite A505, runs Win7 x64 Home premium with 4GB RAM.
I do all maintenance by myself.
I have heard of cleaning air vent using air cans but honestly I am too scared too do that as I am afraid that instead of getting the dust out, I will block it even further by pushing it in.
May be I just need to know how to do it correctly.
