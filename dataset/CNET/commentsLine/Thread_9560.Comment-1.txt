for the past two months i have been searching the web for an application/software that i can use to auto upload files to a server on a schedule bases.
originally i thought this would be a simple matter but turns out i was wrong.
there are many software available for this but the issues is how they all function.
example: one software synchronized ftp allows you to set a local/remote folder and sync files between them.
what was never disclosed is that you need windows task scheduler to run the synchronization , and you do not see a progress indicator.
i also tried turboftp but it felt like landing a space shuttle.
i don't need all that stuff, just a simple interface.
to shorten this message, i have tried too many to count.
what i need is something clean, uncluttered, straightforward and can be automated.
example: set it to grab a file at 2:00am and place to server.
all i need is an application to grab a file from a local folder via sftp/ssh and place it in a remote server folder .
i need something that i can automate (set it and forget it).
have you tried anything that is robust, works every time, automated and shows you the file is there?
i just need to upload a file.
thank everyone!
