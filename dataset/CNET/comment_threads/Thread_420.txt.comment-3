things that might be the issue: 1) Power supply probably is crap, and not providing enough juice 2) cooling, Prescott's are hot chips 3) the RAM and the motherboard may not &quot;get along&quot; (some motherboards/RAM combinations just don't work, I have no idea why, it just is the way it is, and iirc Kingston is one of compaines with the most problems)
