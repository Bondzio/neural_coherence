i have an acorp 6bx/via83 mb.
fan1 and fan2 on the motherboard are not working any longer.
i used a tester on the three prongs and this is what reads: fan1= prong1 11.1v, prong2 .91v, prong3 is the ground fan2= prong1 3.5v, prong2 9.53v, prong3 is the ground my bios has nothing for fan settings.
i haven't found any program that controls my motherboard fan.
the only trouble shooting was plugging an exhaust fan into all 3 fan oulets off my motherboard.
it only works in fan3.
is there any troubleshooting i can do with this problem, or is my motherboard going on me?
thanks for any info you can pass my way, -joe
