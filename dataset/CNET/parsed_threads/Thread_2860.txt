<s> I bought my computer two days ago. </s>
<s> It is HP Pavilion A1130, the shop I bought it told me that the CPU is hyperthreading but I do not know how to find it. </s>
<s> I cannot see HT sign on the Pentium 4 logo and I cannot see in the BIOS setup too. </s>
<s> It shows Intel (R) Pentium (R) 4 CPU 3.06GHz. </s>
<s> (Pentium4 519 (P) 3.06 GHz: 533 MHz front side bus Socket 775). </s>
<s> Please help me to find my CPU is hyperthreading or not. </s>
<s> but it doesnt support hyperthreading. </s>
<s> i have same processor. </s>
<s> Thank you Nerdyboy for your reply. </s>
<s> I'll try to return back my machine to the shop I have bought. </s>
<s> They lied to me that they told me all the nowadays all the Pentium 4 CPU are hyperthreading. </s>
<s> Thank you again for your information. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> i have a p4 with ht! </s>
<s> its a 2.8 gig, sorry those jerks either lied to you or they dont know what they are doing! </s>
<s> Hey, I wish I had ht. </s>
<s> You wouldn't have had any experience with a CPU without it. </s>
<s> I'd like a compairson to see whether it is much better. </s>
<s> Hyperthreading makes everything waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay faster. </s>
<s> Most of the computers in my school use P4s with HT, but the ones w/o HT are way slower. </s>
<s> out on Dual Core. </s>
<s> I assume HyperTransport is the same thing, just AMD's version. </s>
<s> HT only makes the comuter faster when you're using apps that are multi-threaded; HT lets the CPU process more than one thread at once. </s>
<s> FOr single threaded apps, HT can slow the computer down </s>
<s> In my tests this seems to be an old wives tale. </s>
<s> Sorry, I have such machines and can't agree. </s>
