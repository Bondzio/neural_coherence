great!
please let us know how it works out as time goes by.
how heavy is your card stock?
my heaviest stock is 100 lb cover/270 g/m.
i called canon today.
they told me that they did not have a printer to meet the needs of an invitation business.
so i called epson.
they recommended the stylus c120.
it is a new printer released fall 07. it handles heavy stock, has excellent laser quality graphics and uses pigment based inks instead of dye which should help with smearing.
it wasn't very expensive so i thought i would give it a try.
i will let you know how it works out.
best wishes!
