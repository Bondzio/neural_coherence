i wonder where you issues are coming from.
you must have 4 or more posts with issues from here to there.
maybe it's time to reload the machine from scratch, install all the heavy protection, avoid p2p or any crack software and see if the machine stabilizes.
a recurring theme are nearby neighbors with wifi.
just a few days ago i helped a neighbor change rf channels.
and that's all it took.
