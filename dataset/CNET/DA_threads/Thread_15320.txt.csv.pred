1.1.4	I also told him I 'd be switching from a basic dial-up internet connection to a high speed internet connection such as DSL or cable modem .	St
1.1.5	Besides making sure that I have an anti-virus software program installed on my new PC before connecting it to the internet for the first time what other types of software for computer security should I also have installed on my new desktop PC before I connect it to the internet for the very first time ?	Ques
1.1.6	I intend to use my new desktop computer for basic home office use ; email ; web surfing ; personal finance ; and word processing .	St
1.1.7	I 'm in the 50+ year old category ; I do n't play games nor do I make videos on a PC .	St
1.1.8	Based upon my use of a home desktop PC ; should I have installed any other security software on my new PC before I connect it to the internet for the very first time ?	Ques

1.2.1	You definetly need protection when using any & quot ; always on & quot ; ISP service .	St
1.2.2	No matter how you look at it , you simply ca n't go forth until protected .	St
1.2.3	You need the AV pgm .	St
1.2.4	such as Norton 's , plus any firewall pgm .	St
1.2.5	Norton 's has it own firewall , but another maker ZoneAlarm is very popular , Black Ice and SysGate 's are also .	St
1.2.6	The other part is having a good spyware scanner too , two are free and darn good , they are SpyBot v.1.3 and Ad-Aware SE .	St
1.2.7	Webroot 's spyware scanner is popalur too but is a commerical one .	St
1.2.8	Your new ISP cable or DSL may provide some of the protection pgms .	St
1.2.9	for you to use , so ask or read the fine print .	St
1.2.10	You *may* also get such s/w with your new system either as demoware or trialware to see it work , in either case , you just got to have it installed .	St
1.2.11	Once , you install the s/w ( any brand ) , make sure to & quot ; update it & quot ; immediately to have full 100 % protection from the git .	St
