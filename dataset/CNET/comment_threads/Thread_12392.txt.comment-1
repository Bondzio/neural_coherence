I currently have 3 networked PCs in my house.
These are wired using high speed cable internet.
My question is should I consider going wireless with them.
There are no issues with wiring but I am wondering if wireless is faster.
Im looking at the D-Link DI-624 router with D-Link AirPlusXtremeG pci adapter.
Will this improve my speed?
Would it be worth while?
Thanks
