if your serious about this stuff it's a never ending quest for one or two more fps or to get rid of that very slight lag.
i have no idea what size/type psu you have now.......so just winging it.
assuming that fits in the machine it should carry you through most future upgrades.
the hd 6670....as mentioned...is quite a jump from where you are and may be a simple video card swap with no psu upgrade needed.
might be worth a look..........depends how high up the gaming ladder you want to go.
