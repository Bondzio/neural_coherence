1) Are there any GPUs available now that will allow me to take advantage of Aero (or whatever that 3D Vista desktop function will be called)?
Nvidia cliams that its GeForce 7 series is ready for Vista but... with Vista so far away from release, how can they be sure?
I plan to get a powerful GPU now and SLI it later.
But if I'll have to wait until the DX10 cards, then I don't want to waste my money now.
2) What's the best way to connect 3 PATA drives with only two PATA ports?
I'll have DVD-RW drive, DVD-Rom, and a 300GB ATA-100 HDD.
I've heard that placing a optical drive and HD (master and slave respectably, or vice versa) will hurt performance.
