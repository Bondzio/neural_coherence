<s> Using WindowsXP Svc Pak3, Internet Explorer 8 The LA Times Sudoku and Crossword Puzzles suddenly stopped showing on my monitor on Dec 24. </s>
<s> Had been coming up with no problem for at least a couple of years. </s>
<s> I figured the Times co-ordinator took a Christmas break. </s>
<s> The Times advises no personnel change, no format change, and finds no problem. </s>
<s> All I get is a red &quot;X&quot;. </s>
<s> Am still getting New York Times puzzles OK, E-mails OK, all other Internet functions OK. </s>
<s> I'd try firefox, google chrome or opera next. </s>
<s> You posted in the PC Hardware forum. </s>
<s> Why do you think this is a hardware issue? </s>
<s> Firefox worked. </s>
<s> Great! </s>
<s> But why did IE fail after doing the job for two years. </s>
<s> I did not realize this forum was EXCLUSIVELY hardware. </s>
<s> The hardware is intimately involved with the software that controls it. </s>
<s> Hard to say where to draw the line. </s>
<s> Nevertheless, thanks for the guidance. </s>
<s> But if you chose the hardware forum, then someone might ask why you think it's hardware. </s>
<s> As to IE 8. </s>
<s> I was unaware it was out 2 years ago. </s>
<s> Let me check that. </s>
<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_8 and other places seem to write the beta one was March 2008 so it can't have been working for years? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Been using whatever IE version was current over many years, IE8 being only the most recent. </s>
<s> We hear/read about glitches like that. </s>
