<s> I have a LinkSys WRT54G router on IP 192.168.6.27 My laptop and desktop are set to automatically get an IP address from the router. </s>
<s> However, I have noticed lately that the two computers cannot communicate using their friendly names but I can ping them and do filesharing by their IP addresses. </s>
<s> Upon doing an ipconfig /all on both machines, I think I have discovered the problem. </s>
<s> The computers each have two DNS servers, but neither is my router. </s>
<s> I could manually tell my machines to use 192.168.6.27 as my DNS server, but because I travel with my laptop it would be much easier if I could just leave it on autoconfig. </s>
<s> How, then, can I get my router to tell my machines that it is the DNS server they should use and have the router handle all requests to my ISP's external DNS servers? </s>
<s> You could put those names in your HOSTS file. </s>
<s> Look up what the HOSTS file does... </s>
