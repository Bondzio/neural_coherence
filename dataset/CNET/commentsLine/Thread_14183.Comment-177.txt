started in '86 w/ comodore 64 - not quite a pc by our standarts but... ilearned basic programing, wrote a payroll program, i used all they way through 1992 long after my first real pc info: actually started rewriting rhe program in machine code throgh a compiler (merlin) and though never finished it, the function in code worked just as fast as c++ under win 3.1 on a 386 - thats why i'll always keep griping about these oversized slow monsters written by the current programers.
dec 1989 (or was it 88) bought a 383 2x25mhz, 4 meg, 40 mg hard drive 15&quot; monitor for $ 2800 ... and thats where the empty wallet started (90) 300 for a second 40 meg rll/mfm drive (90) 1100 for a 212 meg scsi drive (91) 980 for a double speed external cd rom (91) 3000 for a laser printer w/ 600 dpi enhancment card 1600 for a 486 and motherboard which could hold 1 gig meg in memory *** too bad that would have cost 10,000 to populate *** (92) 2800 for a color ink-jet ( well it was 17&quot; wide trackt) my cellphone can almost do what all my old pc's could do together and my new pc - 1 ghz pent, with 1 gig , 4 + 80 gig drives, dvd burner , cheap ink-jet all for less than 700 a couple of years ago.
- and oh yeah how much would my one gig have been in 91 --- $ 10,000 - now 50-100. makes me feel prety stupid
