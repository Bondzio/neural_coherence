<s> Hey there! </s>
<s> I want to get a new video card for my birthday but I'm not sure if I should SLI with the card I currently have or if I should just get a better card. </s>
<s> My Current card: AMD Radeon 6870 1GB (I would be SLI'ing this one) What I want: AMD Radeon 6950 (would just be a single card) </s>
<s> I have no idea of how to compare vid perf of a 2x 6870 vs 1x 6950. </s>
<s> I hope you have a whopper psu. </s>
