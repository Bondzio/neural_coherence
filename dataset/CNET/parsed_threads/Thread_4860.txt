<s> I have my internal hard drive set up with 3 partitions. </s>
<s> on the 1st partition I have XP sp1. </s>
<s> I use that for a backup operating system. </s>
<s> On the 2nd partition I have XP sp3 and I use it as my primary operating system. </s>
<s> The 3rd partition is the largest and I use it just for storage. </s>
<s> I dont really need it because I recently purchased a large external drive. </s>
<s> I really want to try the Linux based Ubuntu operating system. </s>
<s> Can I install it on the 3rd partition? </s>
<s> Here's the rub, you can install as many OSes as you like &quot;PROVIDED&quot; they don't interfere with each other. </s>
<s> Now, saying that and doing that are two different things. </s>
<s> Trail and error is the most instructive lesson you can learn. </s>
<s> You already got a difficult setup now with XP sp1 and sp3 both installed. </s>
<s> So, if you don't want your hard work wasted, take it one step at a time. </s>
<s> The boot.ini file will have to involved during all this, so I suggest you save the current working one and/or NTldr file to return to before if all fails. </s>
<s> In a round about way, if you've tried the &quot;live Ubuntu CD version&quot; you get an idea how that OS will work. </s>
<s> You can &quot;sandbox&quot; it using a &quot;virtual setup&quot; allowing its install within its parameters and see how things work. </s>
<s> Google more for virtual and check it out. </s>
<s> I assume you already have some arrangement now to tell which OS to boot, like the startup menu. </s>

<s> On primary drive, download and run the WUBI installer, shouldn't be an issue, assuming you have enough drive space. </s>
<s> requires about 17 GB. </s>
<s> I got her running. </s>
<s> Now I'm having trouble trying to figure out how to install my linksys wmp300n wireless card and radeon graphics card. </s>
<s> windows is all I've ever known. </s>
<s> I'll be patient. </s>
<s> You usual place to see if any drivers are available is to check the maker's support website. </s>
<s> If not there or unavailable then google away fro linux versions or the Linux world of things. </s>
<s> It really makes a difference in that the more common(or popular) a device is the more likely you'll find Linux support for it. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Go to APPLICATIONS, UBUNTU SOFTWARE, then look in SYSTEM TOOLS. </s>
<s> I found a bunch of stuff on how to install the drivers. </s>
<s> It looks pretty complicated though. </s>
<s> Not stuff I'm familiar with. </s>
<s> I'm going to give it a try in a few days. </s>
<s> It's a pain in the butt having to pull my graphics card out each time I want to boot Ubuntu. </s>
<s> Otherwise the system hangs up on boot. </s>
<s> I'm a single dad with 2 toddlers and my littlest one was diagnosed with pnuemonia today so I'm gonna just spend time with him and come back to it when he's healthy. </s>
<s> thank you. </s>
<s> sincerely, Steve </s>
