I just got a 1.1 terrahertz OPU [optical processor unit] from an R&D team.
It fits into my athalon 2.4ghz socket but is about 6&quot;cube.
I had to use my 3500btu room airconditioner as a new case side to keep it cool and make a cardboard tunnel [chunnel) to get the hotair exhaust out the window.
this is from in-your-dreams.com PS.
a little humor here!
