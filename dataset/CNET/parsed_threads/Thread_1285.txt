<s> Im looking for a web cam that works well with AIM video chatting. </s>
<s> I have the Logitech QuickCam Pro 4000 but that seems to not be working correctly anymore. </s>
<s> A message comes up saying that the &quot;request has timed out&quot;. </s>
<s> So if anyone knows a web cam that works well with AIM please let me know. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Mine still works great. </s>
<s> Any way to test it on another machine? </s>
<s> Yes, I'd buy another logitech... </s>
<s> and it still doesn't work. </s>
<s> I think the deal is that some webcams work and some dont. </s>
<s> Im looking at buying the Logitech QuickCam Ultra Vision Special Edition. </s>
<s> Any thoughts? </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> I can't comment on the new model. </s>
