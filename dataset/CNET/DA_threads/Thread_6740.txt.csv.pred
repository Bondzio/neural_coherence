1.1.2	I just purchased a new eMachines T3085 -- running Windows XP Home .	St
1.1.3	I would like to install my old hard drive ( with Windows 98 ) into the new computer to rescue some files .	St
1.1.4	Does anyone have any suggestions about switching the old master drive to a slave drive ?	Ques
1.1.5	I assume I can just install it and XP will recognize it/ re-lable it , etc .	St
1.1.6	Is this correct ?	Ques
1.1.7	Any thing I should be aware of when trying this ?	Ques
1.1.8	Does anyone know if I can use the MS Ofice 2000 on Windows XP ?	Ques
1.1.9	I have back-ups of most of the files -- but I am doing this to rescue some important files that have not been backed up ...	St
1.1.10	I learned my lesson .	St
1.1.11	Thanks .	Polite

1.2.1	Your issue is too similar to http : //reviews.cnet.com/5208-7588-0.html ? forumID=70 & threadID=21457 & start=0 And MS Office 2000 is fine on XP .	St
1.2.2	No new bugs noted .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	It should be no problem .	St
1.3.2	What is have done in the past is bring the new OS up and make sure that all is working ok. Power down , pull the new drive and make sure that it is set to MASTER , not to single drive .	St
1.3.3	Now set the older drive to SLAVE .	St
1.3.4	Re-install both drives and power up tyou system .	St
1.3.5	When the system comes up it will see the other drive and set it up for you .	St
1.3.6	That 's it .	St
1.3.7	Good luck	Polite
1.4.1	Be aware that many new system use Cable Select ( CS ) instead of Master and slave like the old systems .	St
1.4.2	Your old hard drive may need to be set to CS to be used as a second hard drive .	St
1.5.1	Hello , To recover your files from the old hard disk , I suggest you make the hard disk as a slave drive BUT use it on another PC with Win98 .	St
1.5.2	Then copy or burn your files on CD .	St
1.5.3	After you have done this and am sure of it , then format the hard disk which will erase everything on it .	St
1.5.4	Then , you can go back to your new PC and install this old hard disk .	St
1.5.5	XP Home ( I presume ) will recognise it after it has been formatted again by XP Home .	St
1.5.6	Sure you can install Office 2000 in XP Home I have done it and am using it .	St
1.5.7	Good Luck .	St

1.6.1	Hi , I often just apply the second IDE cable to the drive and allow it to be the second drive in the system .	St
1.6.2	You will with some luck be able to see and move everything from and to the drive .	St
1.6.3	BUT you want to not confuse the system , XP that is , and leave the second Win 98 drive in the system for any more time than necessary .	St
1.6.4	YES , it will run , NO the Registry entries are not made to XP so the data is available but not the .EXE function .	St
1.6.5	PLEASE get the drive formatted or removed soon , Actually , having a partitioned XP drive will be your backed up primary drive .	St
1.6.6	Get a good Motherboard and off you go ...	St
