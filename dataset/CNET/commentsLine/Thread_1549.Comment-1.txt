here's my problem.
i have a wired desktop and a wireless laptop (both xp) going througha linksys router to the internet.
i have file sharing turned on and shared folders on both computers; but, i can only access the folders on the laptop.
i can see the folders of both my desktop and laptop when i look at network neighborhood on both pcs but can't access the folders on the desktop through network neighborhood (on either computer).
everytime i get the error &quot;xxx is not accessible.&quot; both are on the same workgroup and i never changed the permissions of the folder on the desktop.
i know for a fact that the shared folders have worked in the past, but i don't know what happened.
oh, and the printer works fine on the shared network.
it is connected to my desktop and i can print to it from my laptop.
please help!
