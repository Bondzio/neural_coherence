AMD uses hyper-transport, meaning between 1 and 2 (usually 2) GHZ between the system and the CPU the CPU has on-die memory controller, a feature Intel lacks, this gives the AMD an advantage in terms of general performance as for a PSU, you should be considering 450W-550W range, and from a GOOD company also, OEM is fine for a hard drive, most motherboards that feature SATA include 1-6 SATA cables (mine have, most do) and you can buy a SATA cable for $2 at newegg, and if you REALLY feel like it's oh so important you can goto Xoxide and buy UV reactive cables with all the eye candy in the world for $6-$7 each in addition i'd suggest against Ultra for casing, instead i'd buy a case from who they ripped off, which would be Chenming/Cheiftec ATI is not better than nVidia, ATi is currently in #2 in terms of performance, technology, basically anything you can think up to compare them on, nVidia can beat ATi Intel is not faster than AMD, and I'm sick and tired of you not reading anything we send you so i'm going to send you Tom's Hardware Guide's interactive CPU comparison charts, it lacks the dual cored chips on it, but given that Smithfield does about the same as Presscott, and Manchester does about the same as San Diego or Venice, it's not really that bad also, it's 3700+ is the old ClawHammer S754 chip, not the new San Diego S939 chip, but aside from that it's 100% up to date oh, and it lacks the Pentium 4 670 (just look at the 570J, and add about 2-3%) (the FX-57 is also not on there, but i'm guessing that chip is WELL out of your price range) http://www23.tomshardware.com/index.html?modelx=33&model1=57&model2=116&chart=17 and you were saying about the Intel being better?
that's a 3.73GHZ chip, comparing to a 2.6 and it's appear to also be getting, BEATEN Intel IS NOT FASTER, they are just clocked HIGHER AMD does 9 IPC (Integers Per Clock), Intel does 6 but it doesn't stop there, oh no, AMD has a stronger FPU, which means in FPU intensive applications (Basically any heavy math, like FarCry) the AMD can step ahead, due to the Pentium 4 (and Pentium D)'s amazingly weak FPU AMD's chips are far and away faster if you want to compare benches to comparable clock speeds and so on... the FX-57 does not have a target competition, it was released as part of AMD's &quot;ultimate single core gaming experience&quot; thing, Intel has since cancelled the 3.73EE, so their &quot;fastest&quot; chip is the 670, which is basically a 570J with 64-bit AMD has better 64-bit extensions (which Intel copied) AMD has a better FPU AMD has a higher IPC AMD runs cooler and uses less power AMD includes a better stock HS, is supported by more motherboards for upgrade (as their Dual Core doesn't req.
a new chipset) and on top of that, THEY ARE CHEAPER in addition, with your DDR2 vs DDR thing, DDR2 is only benefical for Intel Intel's Pentium 4 design created a very bandwidth hungry chip, and in order to keep performance up, it has to run a quad-pumped FSB (AMD's K7 by contrast used a dual-pumped FSB, and now AMD just uses HTT) and it requires insane ammounts of RAM bandwidth latencies do affect performance, but on an Intel system the higher bandwidth matters which is why DDR2 is an advantage RAID is not mostly used for servers, while servers use RAID, it is also used on home system for large storage arrays and data back up you really don't know as much as you claim, and i'll go there with you if you REALLY want to get into this stuff, and believe me, i'll go over you head if you keep talking Intel is better this and ATi is better that A) you have not, and can not prove it B) I can, and have proven it so please, accept advice that is being given you by many, and come down of your high horse, your not the best, nor am I (never claimed to be) i'm just someone who knows a bit more about this stuff, and i'm trying to help you...
