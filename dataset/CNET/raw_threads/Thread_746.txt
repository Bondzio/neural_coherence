I haven't touched the compression software yet. When copying a folder from my computer, &quot;are you sure you want to copy this file without its properties?&quot; for 4 files. I don't have a clue what this means. I also am curious about the compression software. It looks like it will become a resident in the System Tray in the computer when you activate it. I'm trying to figure out how this works and would prefer not to add anything to the startup or System Tray. It mentions something about a peculiar interaction with Windows Vista and 7 - any clarification about this?
