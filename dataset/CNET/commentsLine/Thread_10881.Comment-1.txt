hello everybody, i have a rather awkward problem most of the times i try to watch a movie in my pc.
the moment i insert the dvd disk in and starts to read then all of a sudden the pc automatically restarts.
i have a pentium 4 in 3.0 ghz with windows xp home, 512 mb ram, 80gb hard drive, liteon dvd-rw, and a vga 128mb pci-express.
the problem doesnt appear in all dvd movies but in the majority of those.
with common dvd (software content) and cds there is no problem at all.
thanks
