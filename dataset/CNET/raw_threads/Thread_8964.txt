I looked around and came up with these specifications: Intel Core 2 Duo [2.6 GHz] DDR2 Ram [2 GB] Hard Disk (sata) [250 GB] Graphics Card [256 MB] Now, I'd like to know if this will do the job and also if there are any additional things that I'm going to need other than a case.

All too often supplied with a new case while they work, may not for long or be underpowered. A decent system needs a good psu in order to remain stable and provide steady outputs. If you plan not to get into heavy gaming and generally a typical home system, a 500W+ psu will do fine. There are cheap offerings out there in the 500W range and when you look into the matter see the difference price makes and what will suit you. I take it seriously the lack of a decent psu in new systems, because of the reasons above. Everything else you mentioned seems OK. Use common sense and proceed, good luck. tada -----Willy

Make sure that the SMPS or PSU (the power supply)is 500W or better. Try to get a DVD writer, its helpful in data backup. If you're going to watch movies you can add a Blu Ray player at a later date when Blu Ray discs become mainstream. Go for a decent 19&quot; LCD monitor or better
