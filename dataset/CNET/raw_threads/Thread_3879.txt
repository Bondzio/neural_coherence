While back-up is important, I'm thinking that the best approach is to get a fast HD settup with backup to an external HD as this stuff is getting bigger and cheaper everyday. I suspect we'll be able to get USB flash storage in the 20-30 GB size very cheap over the next year or two - so why buy and loadup my new desktop with expensive HD's. Anyway, I'm thinking of the 160 GB - 10K rpm in a RAID 0 settup (for a total of 320 GB storage). My question is how will I work with a RAID 0 settup? Will it &quot;appear&quot; to me as a single HD, such as the C drive? If I want to dump copies to an external HD, is there anything complicated doing that from a RAID 0 settup? Anybody know of downsides of a RAID 0 settup? Thanks in advance.

The only caveat is that GHOST until later versions couldn't backup or restore to most RAID systems. Try Acronis for that. RAID is nice but don't count it as &quot;storage&quot; since drives last about 5 years and the storage aspect until some error happens. Bob
