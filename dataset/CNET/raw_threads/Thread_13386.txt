There is some space and cover has been taken off for better ventilation. One day the cd\rw drive was not getting read by the computer anymore. It will open and close on command but it doesn't read anything. Sometimes when i turn on the computer the cd drive(D) does not show up, the cd\rw drive(E) stopped showing up a while ago. The cd player plays every now and then but it makes loud clicking like noises and sometimes it just freezes and does not read at all. Is there anything i can do to restore them or fix them or am i too late? Do i just need to buy new ones? They are about 3 -4 years old. Appreciate any help. Thank you.
