<s> I am planning on building a PC for 3 reasons: cost effective, experience, fun! </s>
<s> The computer should be able to handle HD video and multitasking, no gaming, maybe some video editing, and I want something the will not be obsolete in at least 7 years. </s>

<s> What kind of optical drive should I get? </s>
<s> What can I do to save money? </s>
<s> How much RAM and HDD do I need? </s>
<s> Any compatibility issues? </s>
<s> Thanks for your time! </s>
<s> i would get a wayyy cheaper mobo with onboard video. </s>
<s> the money u save on the graphics and mobo , u can go get an xbox or ps3 or just SAVE it ! </s>
<s> I have made some recent changes: Motherboard: http://tinyurl.com/3ecfs9h Optical Drive: http://tinyurl.com/3bq8qow USB 3.0 Card: http://tinyurl.com/3mt397p I want the desktop to be able to handle 1080P movies (blu-ray or not). </s>
<s> Should I still go for a cheaper mother board with built in graphics? </s>
<s> Also, is the stock heat sink enough? </s>
<s> The case comes with 2 fans but I was thinking of adding another. </s>
<s> What do you think? </s>

<s> Anything else I can change to save money? </s>
<s> IMO If it's 32bit it doesn't matter , I personally like amd chips because the onboard graphics is radeon based and I like the force options for resolution , but anything ~ 2-3 ghz processor and 2+ gb ram would be sufficient for what you require ! </s>
<s> If it's 64 bit IMO I go with an amd 64 bit dual core ~ 2-3 ghz and 2gb ram.... Iknow alot of ppl like intel but I like and notice the extra cache per cost on amd You can shave more $$ if you rethink your needs and cost. </s>
<s> Going for a cheaper build using build in CPU graphics: http://tinyurl.com/3fnjykh http://tinyurl.com/3bxd97n http://tinyurl.com/4y5gmrn http://tinyurl.com/3s7lnwg http://tinyurl.com/3cbwvfq http://tinyurl.com/4xpfacx http://tinyurl.com/3bv9mrr http://tinyurl.com/3okruxq I want more than 4GB Ram just cause, but it seems like the next option is 8GB? </s>
<s> Do you think the build in graphics will handle 1080P movies well? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
