i am only 40 feet away from my cable with netgear wnr2000 router.
can i just connect my notebook to my old netgear wgr614 v7 router and have 2 routers talk to each other?
how can i find out what channel i am on, if it is in use then how do i change it?
what is the name of software that checks the signal and where can i get it?
thanks.
