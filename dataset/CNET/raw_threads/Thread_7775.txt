You probably cannot do it from within iTunes but if you export the library out as AAC, AIFF or MP3 then once it is burned onto the DVD is should be playable. The other alternative is to go to the local Mac store and ask them how to do it. P

Tip: If you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution. That ipodlounge is very good about such things as well as google.com It's late so I'll be back tomorrow. Bob

So, would it be too much to expect that the contents of the iPod also existed, as originals, within iTunes? If that is the case, wouldn't one just export and then burn them. P
