and i never found a solution save this.
we ended up with 2 fax machines.
one that worked most of the time but the other was for people that couldn't send a fax to the first machine.
it took months to figure this out.
i tracked it down to the sender's fax machine model that would not work with our and other people's machines so we pulled an old fax machine and put it on a backup line.
the few that can't send to the main line send to the second line.
here's the hard part.
many think this is a flaw in the receving fax machine.
but when you change out the sending fax machine then it is fixed.
so here we are 3 decades later and 2 machines.
