You write this forum's top level sticky and I'll make it the Sticky for the forum. -&gt; There are no rules for the winner here. I'm going to choose which one I see over the next few days and click my sticky button. I know a few may not like such a bold idea but don't despair since I'll leave the stick open for your great TIPs or FAQs! As moderator I might weed out a bad one or will remove a post by it's owner's request. It's your forum. We just moderate. Here's what I'd like to see. The top entry such as &quot;Welcome. Read me first. Tips for PC Hardware here.&quot; Or whatever fits. Keep it short and put your great ideas as a reply to that. Remember to create a new discussion and reply to that with your FAQ. Other minor rules. -&gt; Must adhere to the forum policies. -&gt; Any post promoting web sites is an instant disqualifier. -&gt; English please. -&gt; TLA rule. Use a TLA but always define it such as TLA (Three Letter Acronym.) How to organize your Forum Welcome. 1. Write a Welcome! or Welcome to the PC Hardware Forum. Avoid any items there since we want this to be &quot;timeless.&quot; Make the title inviting to read. 2. Reply to the welcome message with Tips. Remember that you can ask a ninja (aka moderator) to remove a tip without killing the entire Welcome message. This way we can update tips without disturbing the welcome or other tips. 3. Be impartial. Keep in mind our forum policies. Looking forward to reading your sticky, Bob
3607	1	241302	2450242	2448585	jconner	4/4/07 11:37 AM	1.17568662E12	Welcome to the PC Hardware Forum	This is the PC Hardware forum and is meant to address issues, problems and questions regarding the components and devices that collectively constitute a personal computer or &quot;PC&quot;. If you look at the biggest part of your personal computer (the box)and have something to ask, inform or comment on that part of your PC, you are in the right forum. Our focus is the physical bits, power supplies (P/S), motherboards (MOBO), BIOS, central processing unit (CPU), memory, graphics cards, sound cards, hard drives, optical drives etc. If it has some weight, whirs, spins, lights up, or plugs into something it is generally hardware. If you are unsure if your question relates to hardware, or operating software (such as Windows, Linux, O/S 10 etc.), or a specialty application software package such as Outlook, Word, Norton etc., then you might wish to go directly to the Computer newbies forum. You may wish to browse the forum and look at the kinds of things being discussed before you post. We welcome your questions, comments and opinions as long as they adhere to the forum policies (see the link). We suggest that you review the Forum's frequently asked questions (FAQ - see the link) before posting, as in most cases your questions may have already been addressed and perhaps resolved in this or other forums. Countless hardware problems and solutions have been; and continue to be discussed within this forum. Please feel free to join in.

See these for examples. http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7594_102-0.html?forumID=59&threadID=241296&messageID=2448501 (very nice!) http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6132_102-0.html?forumID=32&threadID=238606&messageID=2432058 The length is nice and the content &quot;timeless.&quot; Bob

Example at this link -&gt; http://forums.cnet.com/5204-7594_102-0.html?forumID=59&tag=forum.fd I may have to actually break down and write one for here. But it's true that the moderators do decide which gets the sticky feature. Bob
