only supports up to ATA100.
Intel seems to feel that SATA is the place to get faster drives now and in the future, so they didn't put ATA133 support in the 865 or 875 chipset.
HOWEVER most of the other mobo's using those chipsets add their own chipsets for additional RAID support as well as aditional SATA ports.
The Gigabyte 8KNXP can support a total of 12 drives, their RAID ports can also be run as ATA/ATAPI.
Not all mobo's RAID ports can be used for ATA/ATAPI.
