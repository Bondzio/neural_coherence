<s> Hi, this is just a quick question. </s>
<s> In a few months i will be assembeling my gaming pc. </s>
<s> Specs: i5 3570k gtx 660ti 8gb ram 1tb hdd 500gb hdd 600w psu I need to know weather i should choose liquid or air cooling heatsink for my psu. </s>
<s> Also could you tell me if all liquid heatsinks have to have water replaced? </s>
<s> Are you in some climate where you have a room over 38C? </s>
<s> Cool the PSU? </s>
<s> You don't want any liquid by the PSU in case it fails(leaks). </s>
<s> As for water, most tend to add some anti-fungi killer(anti-freeze) in order to control the growth of such. </s>
<s> AND/OR use a specialized liquid that maybe part of the kit or some additive. </s>
<s> While you can water cool, having back-up air fans, will do fine just to keep it all together. </s>
<s> I wouldn'ty cool the PSU offhand, but everything else can be. </s>
<s> However, I tend to think, BIG PC case in order to mave room and additional areas to place fans and/or mount whatever. </s>
<s> Plus, a decent case may lend itself to custom builds thus you start from the ground up rather than thinking GPU and CPU stuff, having a good case and PSU is a must, IMHO. </s>
<s> Further, once you start stuffing the case, you rather not move it over to something better later, you'll probably keep the case as it came, so having a better case from the beginning is a good idea. </s>
<s> Of course, you could think &quot;oil immersion&quot; placing entire PC in oil vat. </s>
<s> google for examples. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> sorry, typo error. </s>
<s> cool cpu not psu sorry again </s>
<s> I build and I don't use them for gaming. </s>
<s> A few dollars to keep that CPU running cool and reliably is money well spent for me. </s>
<s> You can check out the HS CPU options over at http://www.frostytech.com VAPCMD </s>
<s> There are plenty of 3rd party cpu replacement fans. </s>
<s> Just be sure its rated for use with your cpu and it will fit inside the case, sometimes its a tight fit. </s>
<s> I mention that as some fan and heatsink setups are huge or unique arrangements of sorts. </s>
<s> Check online vendors for sources. </s>
<s> IMHO, a few or well placed case fans help greatly and its best to do all this when you're building rather than later. </s>
<s> Heat stress is a killer of gaming PCs. </s>
