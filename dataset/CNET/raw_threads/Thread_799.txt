But, by default, most will look for the master drive on the first IDE channel. So, you can also change drive jumpers to accomplish this or, if using cable select, switch positions on the IDE cable. Since you did not mention anything about hardware, I am presuming you are using IDE HDs. If you are using SATA drives, BIOS or cable selection is still how it's done.
