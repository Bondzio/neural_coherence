I have a Linksys WRT54G with latest firmware 1.02.2. I'm using DHCP and MAC address filtering for security. If I put my Thinkpad next to the iMac, I can get onto the network no problem. But the iMac won't even recognize the network let alone allow me to connect. I if unplug and power up the router, the iMac will reconnect to the network for an unpredictable amount of time and then lose the connection again. But the Thinkpad maintains the network conenction even when the iMac disconnects. Any ideas would be appreciated.
