1.1.1	For some insane reason, after so many years with an HP desktop, i foolishly decided to take the hook, and by an imac osx 10.6.4 2.66 ghz intel core 2 duo 2gb 1076 mhz ddr3 ram.	St
1.1.2	Can anyone help me with a way to improve the audio??	Ques
1.1.3	I use a logitech x540 5.1 speaker system which sounds AWSOME on my old hp, but sounds like @#$% on this mac.	St
1.1.4	the store where i bought the mac suggested these speakers, said speakers i have no problem with.	St
1.1.5	Before i throw this mac out the 2nd story window, anyone have any ideas??	St
1.1.6	Thanks JC	St
1.2.1	whether these speakers are attached via USB, 3.5mm plug or an fiber optic, could you tell me?	St
1.2.2	The built in speakers on the iMac do a decent job.	St
1.2.3	Is the sound from the internal speakers better than the sound from the external speakers?	St
1.2.4	In the System Preferences\Sound Preference pane, is the output set to the external speakers?	St
1.2.5	P	St
1.3.1	hi, they are plugged in through the headphone jack.	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	1) both sound tinny weak.	St
1.5.2	2)it is set to headphones, as that is the only option.	St
1.6.1	and this machine is under warranty, I would suggest a trip to the local Apple store, if there is one near you or to the nearest Apple Authorized Service Provider The sound from the internal speakers on an iMac is very good and would not be described as &quot;Tinny weak&quot; P	St
1.7.1	Thanks for all the info.	St
