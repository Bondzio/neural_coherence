Dear Friend, First of all buy a 350 Wt supply device for your case.
Secondly it is absolutely necessary to have two fans for your case because your behaviour towards your computer is generally characterized as HEAVY DUTY.
You do not have to bother the mobo.
Do not forget that the mobo needs energy to supply all the system .
And finally, a UPS device is essential.
That's all.
Bye !!!
Charidimos.
