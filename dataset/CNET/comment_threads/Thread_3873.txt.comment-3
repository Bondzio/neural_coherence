You comouter Network adapter will be able to detect available networks.
You just choose which one to access...keyng in the network key if it is a securred network... As for the IP & DNS numbers, these are keyed into the modem/router of the Network your are accessing so there is no need to do that at your network adapter [[TCP/IP proprties].
However, there is no harm in doing so.
However, if the numbers ar not properly keyed in at the mode/router or are wrong, you do need to, and in this case you may find a slow connection or frequent drop-line.
