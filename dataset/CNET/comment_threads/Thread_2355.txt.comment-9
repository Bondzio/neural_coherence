If your PC is 1yr.
old it will have USB2.0 that usually allows USB1.1 compatibility.
The issue of USB3.0 is going to be stated as that's a selling point for any new PC.
However, you didn't state what your PC maker was or model#.
Most OEM makers provide the specs of what they contain, so review them or check manual.
USB3.0 is more readily ID'ed by the &quot;blue color&quot; of ports or a different color scheme, though that may not apply to every brand out there.
