However it's so flighty and many have no grasp of networking so I must decline doing anything more than noting the article. Here a router can be found for 20 bucks. So it's a personal choice if your time is worth that. -&gt; Read http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/networking/expert/bowman_02april08.mspx Good luck, Bob
