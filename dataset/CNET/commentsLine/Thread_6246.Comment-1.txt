i just purchased a core i7 gaming pc from visualdreamers.com.
right from the start, i received great customer service on what components would work best for me.
the specs on the computer i built are as follows.
lian li full tower chassis (huge, i didnt realize how big it was) core i7 920 (overclocked for free to 3.8) 1000w corsair modular power supply asus rampage 2 extreme aftermarket fans / heatsink 6 gb ocz reaper 1866 ddr3 ram nvidia gtx 295 wd velociraptor 300gb dvd burner w/ lightscribe i also had the chassis custom painted audi blue.
its amazing looking, and is very durable.
it only cost 99 bucks, i was expecting it to be cheap paint but its full blown high quality stuff.
i couldnt be happier with my purchase.
just wanted to give them the thumbs up on a job well done.
anyone else have any experiences with them ?
