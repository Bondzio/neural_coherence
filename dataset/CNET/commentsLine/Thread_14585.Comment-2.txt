dust can make a smell provided it gets near any hot surface, open up the printer and &quot;blow it out&quot; well and retry again.
alas, there is also the &quot;ionic&quot; smell from the filter which can if dusty as well produce a smell.
any of the above smells should go away after time, like a day or two due to non-use of the printer.
i suggest you plug-in at an outlet away from other conbustables and retry again and just leave it on, using common sense to take any action, but if dust is the problem allow it to be on longer.
the last item, if in closet, little critters can make a home of it and/or leave little bits of thier passing, these too can provide a smell.
check it out and get back to us.
