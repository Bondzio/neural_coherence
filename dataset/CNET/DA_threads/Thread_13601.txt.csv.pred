1.1.1	Hey cnet , I ran a diagnostic test on my laptop because it was having some problems , and it found these errors on the hard drive : Error Code 0F00:1A44 and 0F00:0244 Does this mean that my hard drive needs to be replaced ?	Ques
1.1.2	Or can I reformat it and it 'll be ok ?	Ques
1.1.3	It still boots up so I can try to salvage some of my files .	St
1.1.4	It 's 320G , only about a year old .	St
1.1.5	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	You always do that first .	St
1.2.2	Your choice to try the format and re-use .	Sug
1.2.3	I do n't need unreliable parts in my machines .	St
1.2.4	I tend to gift them away .	St
1.2.5	Why gift ?	Ques
1.2.6	So there is no doubt that I find the parts to be worthless .	St
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	Yeah , right now I 'm running a chkdsk and probably going out to invest in a portable harddrive .	St
