It was windows 7 ultimate 64bit, 4gb memory and 460gb hard drive. But soon after he gave it to me the motherboard stopped working. So we took it to a repair shop to get it fixed, and they replaced the motherboard, and reinstalled windows, but they didn't realize it was 64bit and so they installed 32bit windows, but this didn't really matter so I didn't take it back. A little while later, I noticed a lot of my storage space had completely disappeared from windows. Windows explorer said that I now just had 160gb space, and a whole 300gb had just vanished. But then I checked in the computer management program and it claimed I still had a full 300gb spare. This happened about a year ago now so taking it back isn't really an option. But I never needed that much space until now, and I was wondering if there was any way I could get the space back? This is very annoying, could it perhaps be something to do with 32bit windows? Although that seems unlikely. Oh, and by the was it is just a regular hard drive, not an SSD! I attached some screenshots in case that is any help. Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=feh3yq&amp;s=5 and http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=301o4za&amp;s=5

But maybe that is not clear to some owners. That means this is space that is free to use as in create a new partition or expand C: to take up that space. Bob

The other is to use DISK MANAGEMENT in Windows 7 to create the partition and (quick format) it for use. If you're not sure how to do that.....just 'google' it or search these forums to find a post that has outlined the step by step process. Before starting, recommend you do a fresh backup to preclude any loss of data. Here's a link to the 'expand/extend' options. http://www.google.com/#sclient=psy-ab&q=how+to+expand+partition+windows+7&oq=Windows+7+expanding+parti&gs_l=hp.1.3.0j0i22i30j0i22i10i30l2.27073.40685.1.43136.31.30.1.0.0.0.87.1648.30.30.0....0...1c.1.21.psy-ab.DjO4VK6e1Zs&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&bvm=bv.49478099,d.eWU&fp=884c05b24674b915&biw=1920&bih=1013 Let us know how it works out.

I downloaded AOMEI Partition Assistant, and tried to merge D with the unallocated space, It spent about half an hour merging them before giving me an error that it couldn't assign the partition a letter. So I rebooted and reassigned the partition the letter D, but it still showed it as 300gb missing. But then I went into windows management and the option to extend the drive was no longer greyed out! I used that and it worked!
