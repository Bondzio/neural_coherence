<s> I am planning for an upgrade (a cheap upgrade, at least). </s>
<s> These are recent specs: Intel Pentium D 2.66 GHz (see it here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_d ) DDR 400 (1GB) 2 HDD: Western Digital (320GB,SATA) and Samsung (40GB,IDE) Internal video card (32MB) Windows XP SP2 I need advices on what hardware/software should I put in to keep it fast. </s>
<s> I also have plans of playing high spec games like Call of Duty 4, Left for Dead, Xmen Origins, etc., but I was worrying about the bus speed of my motherboard. </s>
<s> I still use DDRs (which has 400MHz transfer rate), meaning I use an old motherboard (I forgot the brand, sorry!) </s>
<s> If I reached (at least minimum) specs of these games, can I still play these games smoothly under these bus speeds? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I'd say make a minimalist install of FreeBSD with xfce, blackbox, lxsession, or fluxbox as the window manager; but then you wouldn't have games. </s>
<s> External video card with enough memory for the game. </s>
<s> Windows sucks and is insecure; but, since you insist on using it, only install the basics you need. </s>
<s> (Well I hope you're not promoting a product, eh?) </s>
<s> Uhm...let me see...I think I won't opt to change my OS (and I think FreeBSD is a gamble since you said &quot;...but then you wouldn't have games.&quot;). </s>
<s> Thanks anyway. </s>
<s> &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;External video card with enough memory for the game.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; So if I upgraded to let's say 2GB DDR for a 2GB required game, would it be performing the same as a 2GB DDR2 machine runing the same game? </s>
<s> Meaning bus speeds won't affect gameplay..is that what you mean? </s>
<s> (same for the video card thinggy...My slot says AGP 8x. </s>
<s> I don't have PCI-E. </s>
<s> I think.) </s>
<s> Help! </s>
<s> Look on google shopping for agp 8x. </s>
<s> Let's assume that you will need 256M as a minimum. </s>
<s> Part of the game performance or any performance depends on how much memory goes to graphics. </s>
<s> My card is embedded so I lose up to 128M memeory and up to 98% CPU when rendering occurs. </s>
<s> Well, complying with the memory is an easy task, since we can just readily buy the card with the appropriate memory. </s>
<s> But how 'bout the bus speed? </s>
<s> That's already becoming my concern. </s>
<s> Changing the bus speed means changing the motherboard, right? </s>
<s> (I think I won't be resorting to that. </s>
<s> It's like buying a new PC already.) </s>
<s> I hope I could get a specific answer. </s>
<s> Thanks anyway! </s>
