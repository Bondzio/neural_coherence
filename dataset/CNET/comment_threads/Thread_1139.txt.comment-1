I'm going to be running two monitors on one computer ( they will be in seperate rooms).
I was wondering if its possible to be running two keyboards and two mice (one set on the ps/2 ports and the other on usb ports) to control each screen independately.
I want to be able to be running two applications at the same time; one on each monitor.
Will I need extra sofware/hardware?
