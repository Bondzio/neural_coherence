Well My P4 560 runs at 50 degree Celcius at idle and running graphics intensive, can rise up to 67 degrees.
But idle at 60, wow that's hot.
Advice, get 2 fans in the rear if possible, 2 fans in the front, 1 on the top, and 1 on the side and get a better heatsink/fan, with maybe a PCI fan cooler.
Guarnteed temp drop.
