guess what?
i can give some few tips to get your dell run fast again and perhaps save your $'s.
1. go to control panel then add/remove programs.
look for programs you don't need and remove them.
2. explore &quot;my computer&quot; and right click on c drive, left click properties and disk cleanup.
it will free some unnecessary files.
3. after that, left click tools then defrag.
it will arrange all your files and will give priority to your favorite program.
4. well, ask me more if you need me.
enjoy!
