When I hit my e-Machine desktop's power button, things start to happen for about five seconds, then everything stops. Punching F8 does nothing. Holding the Esc key down causes the power and copyright screen (e-Machines) to remain on, but boot-up does not commence. Am I probably looking at an OS or bios problem (WinXP Home), or is it more likely in the power supply itself? What should I do? *

If you were able to get into the BIOS setup, you could try to reset it to defaults, but I expect that doesn't work (is it your f8, or is there another key on the e-machine to do so?). Then all you can do is repair the machine yourself or have it done. Be sure the costs are reasonable. If they have to replace everything, a new PC could be cheaper and better. But if it's just a rotten memory stick, it could be very cost-effective. Kees

(Not from Sam's!) I may be able to plug the hard drive into the new machine, but that's not a critical issue.
