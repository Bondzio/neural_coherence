i am looking at the new pentium 975x chipset and the speed it has w ht (dual core w ht) and wondering if you went for intel or amd and what your experiences have been with your decision.
i am about to make this decission between amd and intel and would appreciate any input.
with the new dual core 975x it is tempting to go with pentium but the benchmarking is really confusing and this is a new addition from intel - hasn't been around enough for me to find much from anyone who has seen it in action.
suggestions?
(looking to add a new windows pc that can use vista later - do picture and film work but not full length and don't do gaming).
thanks
