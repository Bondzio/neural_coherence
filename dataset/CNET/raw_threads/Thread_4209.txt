But I would like to know any third party manufacturer that makes wireless network cards and corresponding drivers/software/hardwork hookup(if needed) for a mac g4 desktop system. Optimally it would communicate with a linksys wrt54gs wireless router through a cable modem on a small internet network with two other &quot;OS&quot; systems, (win XP and win98). Mac manufacturer's seem to have an &quot;airport&quot; card or similar device and make it very unclear if there is any other hardware that can be used. this makes it very hard to know what I can use that will work in my situation. If anybody can help me out on this issue I would be greatly appreciated.

With Apple still in the single digit market share that would plague the product with a 10X higher cost per unit for just the driver. Add more dollars for your tech support lines and many manufacturers will just pass. It's simple to understand once you're told. Bob
