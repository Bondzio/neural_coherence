I am using a 19&quot; Sony LCD as my main display and just tried to connect an Apple 17&quot; LCD Studio display using Apple's ADC to DVI adapter as a second monitor. When I start the computer with only the Sony connected, everything works okay. If I disconnect the Sony and only connect the Apple monitor, I get no picture and the power button on the Apple display lights for a few seconds then goes out and I get no picture. If I leave the Sony connected and then plug in the Apple, the screen on the Sony displays the default desktop background but no folders or other icons and the Apple still won't work. If I then disconnect the Apple monitor, my regular desktop with folders and icons returns on the Sony. The Studio display was working fine for the last owner and he had a dual monitor set up but I can't seem to make it work with the config I have. Am I supposed to install any drivers for the Apple? Unfortunately there wasn't any CD with the display so don't know if I'm supposed to download specific drivers or software. And it just seems weird that the monitor power light won't stay lit. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Gampa

I assume that the Sony is being driven from the VGA connector and the Apple from the DVI one. I'm not familiar with the Apple DVI to ADC adapter but am with the Dr. Bot version of the same product. From your description, it sounds like the monitor is not getting enough power from the DVI to ADC device. Is it plugged into a known good power outlet? Is the adapter new? P
