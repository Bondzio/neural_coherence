<s> Repairing PC for friend. </s>
<s> Not sure if problem is Windows XP related or faulty Hard drive. </s>
<s> System was infected by viruses, e.g. </s>
<s> Netsky, Sasser, Trojan Swizzor etc, and kept closing down. </s>
<s> Used Windows XP restore disk, but booting from CD Rom, seemed to be only thing to work. </s>
<s> Used non-destructive format of recovery, and system seemed OK. Closed down normally but when PC switched back on next morning, Win XP would not start up. </s>
<s> Even Safe Mode was impossible at times. </s>
<s> Did Advanced Option, Quick Format in Recovery disk, but still had problems. </s>
<s> Suspected Hard drive was faulty and checked out Maxtor website. </s>
<s> Downloaded test and eventually did full format of drive using this test. </s>
<s> Since then system has worked better, but this morning got message on start up re &quot;Windows could not start because file is missing &quot;System 32\Drivers\ntfs.sys&quot; I know this has something to do with partitioning of drive, but what? </s>
<s> I have done nothing that I am aware of. </s>
<s> Got system to work again, and have done viruscans and spyware scans, but nothing much there. </s>
<s> Decided to do Chkdsk, and then defragmenter to see if anything there. </s>
<s> Chkdsk stage 1 was OK, but after Stage 2 message was &quot;recovering lost files&quot;. </s>
<s> Stage 3 (security descriptors) was completed. </s>
<s> The following messages were then received (1)&quot;Chkdsk discovered free space marked as allocated in the Master File Table (MFT) bitmap (2)Chkdsk discovered free space marked as allocated in the volume bitmap (3)Windows found problems with the file system Run Chkdsk with the /F (fix)option to correct this.&quot; Unsure if I am in the right forum but would appreciate some help. </s>
<s> Could the above messages be the reason, why the system is not starting up again, when turned off at night? </s>
<s> How do I sort this out once and for all. </s>
<s> what you do is what the error message stated. </s>
<s> Run CHKDSK c: /F or CHKDSK c: /R to FIX the errors or to locate bad sectors and recover data. </s>
<s> What did the Maxtor diagnostic have to say about the drive's health? </s>
