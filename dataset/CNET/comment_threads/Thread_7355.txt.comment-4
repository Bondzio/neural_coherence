The price we pay for these drives is under 40 bucks and get 2 or so year lifespans.
Most accept this because when they lasted years the price was in the hundreds of dollars.
Because of such low prices the highend models are never seen today.
As to make I use the Dell without issue at the office.
The retail HP/Compaq aren't so bad either.
