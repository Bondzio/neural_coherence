Desktop Maintenance.
About once a month I delete all of the files in my Recycle Bin.
I use Outlook Express and once a month I delete all of the files in the Outbox, Sent Items, Deleted Items, and Drafts.
In Internet Explorer about once a month I delete all of the files Temporary Internet files, Cookies, History of websites visited and InPrivatae Filtering Data.
I don't think I have the knowledge or skills to check the CPU heat sink.
This problem is relatively new, like a month, so I doubt that could be the problem.
But, if I can't get it fixed, I take it in to a shop and tell them to check the heat sink.
