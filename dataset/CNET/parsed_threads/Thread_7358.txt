<s> I guess everyone knows about the Soyo's rebate game that being they don't honor them. </s>
<s> IMO another rebate game is being played by Corsair. </s>
<s> They require a rebate be submitted within seven days. </s>
<s> (I should have just ordered from Newegg or Zip-zoom-Fly it would have been cheaper in the long run.) </s>
<s> I hope Microcenter will reconsider with whom they play. </s>
<s> I encourage everyone to read the policy before thay leave the store. </s>
<s> Dear Edward, I have just replied to the email you sent within the hour regarding this issue. </s>
<s> I agree that the seven day period did not give enough time for the customer to submit the rebate. </s>
<s> We value your opinion and appreciate your feedback. </s>
<s> I assure you that all future rebates ran at retail stores will have at least a 14 day or more submission period. </s>
<s> I apologize for the negative experience that you have had with our rebate. </s>
<s> Please contact me if you have any further questions or comments, my contact information is on my email reply. </s>
<s> Best regards, Vivian Wang Retail Account Manager Corsair Memory, Inc. </s>
<s> Both Microcenter and Corsair replied to my emails. </s>
<s> I'm glad the two quality organizations came through. </s>
<s> However, I do think a thirty-day submission timeframe would be more reasonable. </s>
<s> I await the rebate. </s>
<s> Thank you Vivian. </s>
<s> p.s. </s>
<s> I bought more Corsair RAM yesterday. </s>
