1.2.1	Or is there a better card that I should be looking at ?	Ques
1.2.2	nVidia 7600GT .	St
1.2.3	The 512MB VRAM on the X1600Pro does n't make a difference in performance ; it 's just for marketing .	St
1.2.4	The 7600GT SLAUGHTERS the X1600Pro AND the more expensive X1600XT .	St
1.2.5	You can get an eVGA 7600GT for $ 135 on newegg .	St
1.2.6	I am getting a 400 watt power supply What brand and model is that power supply ?	Ques
1.2.7	and not afraid of spending some money How much are you willing to spend ?	Ques
1.2.8	Also , what 's the rest of your computer specs ?	Ques
1.3.1	I ordered a hp 400 watt micro-atx power supply from HP .	St
1.3.2	I 'm not sure of the model I would be willing to spend up to $ 300 if it is an outstanding video card ( yeah , I know the best ones cost like $ 500 but I do n't have the power supply for it ) What other specs would you need ?	Ques
1.4.1	I ordered a hp 400 watt micro-atx power supply from HP .	St
1.4.2	What are the amps on the 12V rail of that PSU ?	Ques
1.4.3	The 12V rail powers the CPU , video card , motherboard , and some other important stuff , so you want to have at least 20A on the 12V rail .	St
1.4.4	The more amps , the more power that can be delivered to the devices that it 's powering .	St
1.4.5	IE : If the PSU has 10A on the 12V rail , you multiply 10x12 , and get 120 .	St
1.4.6	That means that 120 watts are available for all the devices powered by the 12V rail .	St
1.4.7	A single high-end video card can use more than 100 watts of power , so you get the message .	St
1.5.1	I contacted HP , they said it has 1.5 amps on the 12V rail , I ; m going to cancel that order .	St
1.5.2	They also said that installing a PSU with more than 1.5 amp would damage my mother board and that all HPs are give 1.5 amps on the 12v rail .	St
1.5.3	Apparently it 's impossible to upgrade my computer cause i 've been doing this for about 2 weeks and still nothing .	St
1.6.1	1.5 amps ?	Ques
1.6.2	Whoever gave you that info must be wrong because you ca n't even run a computer with 1.5 amps on the 12V rail .	St
1.6.3	My computer came from HP with a 300W power supply with 19A on the 12V rail .	St
1.6.4	It was powering a Pentium 4 , one hard drive , two DVD drives , and a Radeon X600 .	St
1.6.5	HP gave you the wrong information ; do n't cancel the order ; just look at the sticker on the PSU when you receive it .	St
1.7.1	did you upgrade your power suppy and or video card ?	Ques
1.7.2	I 'm having the most difficult time tracking down micro-atx power supplies above 300 watts .	St
1.7.3	HP is really starting to **** me off , the keep giving me wrong info .	St
