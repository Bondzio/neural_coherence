Hi, I can't see any icon for wirelss adapter, I do have an icon that says Intel PEOset that gives a choice to select an adapter.
It gives an IP address, network drive status is loaded, etc....
I checked my device manager and the network card is working.
I have 2 icons in the control panel, one says Wirelss Link, one says Wireless Network.
Under Wiress Network, it ask me to add/edit Configure a profile.
I have no clue what to do here.
This is a second hand computer that was obviusly configured for another network.
Can you help??
thanks.
