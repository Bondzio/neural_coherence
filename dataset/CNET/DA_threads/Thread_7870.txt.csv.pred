1.1.1	Anybody run across this ?	Ques
1.1.2	I have four computers all operating from a home router .	St
1.1.3	All have the same Windows 2000 and network configuration .	St
1.1.4	They can all & quot ; talk & quot ; to each other ( browse or map a drive ) except for one .	St
1.1.5	This one will map to the other computers , but the other computers can not map to this one .	St
1.1.6	Attempts just say Network path not found , or something like that .	St
1.1.7	Whenever the other 3 computers have connection issues , rebooting one of them usually solves it .	St
1.1.8	Not this one .	St
1.1.9	I 've looked at all the network configs and ca n't see any difference .	St
1.1.10	This one computer does have one other network issue .	St
1.1.11	It ca n't connect to a dialup ISP .	St
1.1.12	Gets some protocol missing error .	St
1.1.13	I tried deleting and reinstalling the TCP stack but that caused worse problems , and had to restore the whole system .	St
1.1.14	All these machines are different hardware , but identical OS 's and Windows updates .	St
1.1.15	My last resort is a clean install , which I 'm not looking forward to .	St
1.1.16	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.1.17	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	Read http : //reviews.cnet.com/5208-6127-0.html ? forumID=9 & threadID=53386 & messageID=636657 & tag=cnr Bob	St
1.3.1	Well , none of the & quot ; fixes & quot ; had any effect .	St
1.3.2	I could have sworn connecting to this machine worked at one time .	St
1.3.3	Although none of the other machines have a recently used map to this machine .	St
1.3.4	I probably just need to reload anyway .	St
1.3.5	It 's been a while .	St
1.3.6	I just hate getting everything back the way I want it .	St
1.3.7	It 's such a pain .	St
1.3.8	I 've been debating going to XP anyway .	St
1.3.9	But the thought of & quot ; registering & quot ; with MS galls me .	St
