don't feel bad for the question, it comes up a lot.
The info/misinfo on the internet is a problem compounded by retailers and manufacturers touting more RAM than the system can use.
A curious parallel from a couple generations earlier: Jewelry quality watches will have jewels in the movements.
There's a maximum of 17 places a jewel can be of use.
However, with consumers generally being of the more-is-better mindset, watchmakers started adding in extra jewels.
They'd just glue them in out of the way places.
Who wouldn't prefer a 24 jewel watch over one with a mere 17?
Same thing with RAM anymore.
2x2GB sticks is cheap and easier to sell than a 3 GB configuration.
