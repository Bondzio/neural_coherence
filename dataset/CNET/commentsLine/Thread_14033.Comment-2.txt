hi lindsay, the easiest way to set this up is to right-click in an empty area of your wallpaper and select properties.
once the display properites appears select the screen saver tab at the top.
under the screen saver section is the monitor power section with a button marked power.
in the power options properties screen i like to set 2 schemes.
the first is always on - all settings are set to never.
this is used when i run an antivirus or defrag my hard drive.
the second is home/office desk and i set turn off monitor to 10 minutes, turn off hard disks to never and system standby to after 1 hour.
you can use any settings you like but these work best for me.
enjoy your computer!
!
