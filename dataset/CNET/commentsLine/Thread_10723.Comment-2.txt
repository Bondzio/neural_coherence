it's a proxy by any other name.
if you wanted a proxy why bother with this one that has relabeled what it is in hopes of more sales?
&quot;however, are there any other prevention type softwares on the market?&quot; -&gt; for the title you supplied, that's called proxy software and far too many to list.
i don't need or use such a thing but i don't intend to do anything besides read the news or check a price on free wifi systems.
these proxy systems are also privy to all your traffic so it would be just the thing to collect personal data, credit cards and more.
