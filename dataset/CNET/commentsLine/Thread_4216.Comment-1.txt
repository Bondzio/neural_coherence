hello, i have external wd 1tb hard drive.
fat32.
one day 3 folder in my hard turned into 32kb files.
i've red some articles and learned that it might be a cluster.
dispite the fact, there was about 200gb data in these folders, hard drive's used and free space is same as it was.
so i think my data should be somewhere in the hard drive.
i've googled a lot, but i didn't found why my data turned into clusters.
i want to know how to recover my files of these 3 folders.
how to turn these clusters into folders with my data?
thanks.
windows has checked the file system and found no problems.
192kb in bad sectors.
32.768 bytes in each allocation unit.
30.516.298 total allocation units on disk.
11.341.087 allocation units available on disk.
