5995	0	28306	320249	NR	LeoAlpha	7/5/04 9:03 PM	1.08906138E12	Removing Windows xp	my XP home OS is truly messed up. I want to uninstall it and reinstall it from scratch. Or maybe even uninstall it and install XP pro instead. How do I go about doing this? (it is the OS that came with my computer. IT is not an upgrade.)

I know I'm completely ignorant about this, but if I boot from the CD and choose to install XP, will it wipe out my old version, or will it partition my drive so that I have the old and the new? I dont want a partition. I just want one XP, and I dont want any remnant of the old version.

It asked what to install on: which partition There was one partition on my harddrive, and 8 mb of unpartitioned space. I chose to install on the partition, (where my old OS is) and it said they dont reccomend it, the OS wont work right. I dont want the old OS at all. I want to DELETE IT! How do I delete xp? Anyone? is it possible?

R.Proffitt provides one of the most experienced viewpoints available. Deciphering his somewhat unique style of writing challenges your problem solving abilities, but does lead to increased skills on your part if you want them.

Just follow the steps but,ignore the part about installing on same partition. It won't!
