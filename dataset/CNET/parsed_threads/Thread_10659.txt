<s> I've used a HP PSC 2175 for about 3 years on Win XP Pro,about 4 months ago switched over to Vista Ultimate SP1. </s>
<s> Until today my printer carried on printing as normal. </s>
<s> I'm not sure about scanning as I don't do very much of that, so haven't tried it since the switch to Vista. </s>
<s> This morning I wanted to print a document but got a message saying that I needed to install a printer before I could continue! </s>
<s> I looked in Control Panel&gt;Printers and sure enough there was nothing listed. </s>
<s> I tried re installing the drivers from my original disc but got the message saying OS not supported. </s>
<s> I went to HP's website to get updated driver only to find that the PSC 2175 isn't Vista supported. </s>
<s> Does anybody know why it worked for the past 4 months and if there is a fix that I can try, as I hadn't planned on buying a new printer yet. </s>
<s> Many thanks Mike7P. </s>
<s> This same story happened back in Windows ME days. </s>
<s> Annoying but you are seeing history repeat itself. </s>
<s> I have had my 2175 running sweetly on Vista SP1....BUT... </s>
<s> the other day I finally upgraded to Vista SP2 and powie! </s>
<s> now the 2175 is unrecognized and treated as some unknown USB device with no drivers found. </s>
<s> With lame built-in HP drivers, it will still scan-and-print a page, print from Vista SP2, make copies....BUT... </s>
<s> every few days it turns up missing from the system and when I search for the driver to reinstall, I am informed that the Driver was found, BUT there was a problem... &quot;Microsoft WPD FileSystem Volume Driver&quot; and the notation, &quot;Access Denied&quot;... even tho I have tried with escalated Administrator Privileges. </s>
<s> HP, like all the rest are interested in SELLING MORE new equipment so they do NOT update drivers so you either don't print or buy a new printer... not to mention their newest trick, using a chip to date expire their print cartridges so that they can't be refilled... A pox on them! </s>
<s> As soon as I deplete my ink cartridges, I will be looking at a different BRAND... bye bye HP. </s>
<s> Funny tho, I have a 1995 Okidata Okipage 4W mono laser printer that has served me from Win95 and STILL works on my Win7 machine! </s>
<s> (With a PLL to USB converter) Now THAT'S what I expect in brand support... and better still, it uses almost any brand of toner poured into the ORIGINAL toner cartridge... and has only one tiny streak on the print outs.... </s>
<s> Win some, lose some.... </s>
