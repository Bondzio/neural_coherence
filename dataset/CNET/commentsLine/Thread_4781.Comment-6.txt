bob; thanks for the reply.
u3 drives are very limited.
only available in flash drives max capacity 2 gb.
meantime i downloaded thunderbird portable application on one of my 1gb flash drive.
on first try it worked fine.
no trace of e-mails on computer once i removed the drive.i am going to use this on other computer and see how it works.
if this works fine then i will install it on my portable usb drive.
this might be the solution.
also if this works i would like to copy all my old e-mails from outlook express to the thunderbird portable.
any idea on how to do this ?
thanks
