This is because the gain is at the cost of antenna being unidirectional -- so alignment and lack of obstruction is critical. I'd look at e-bay or a large network equipment dealer for dish with correct connector. You need to keep the connecting wires between wireless devices and antennas as short as pos, incidentally.

I believe this cable allows something like 185 meters but, if it's old, that might be a stretch. If that's the case, one option might be to find an old NIC with a coax jack. You'd also need a T connector and a terminator, of course. Is that an option?
