1.1.1	This is not actually a question , but a solution that i found to my problem .	St
1.1.2	Thought this solution may help some people as i came accross many unsolved problem of this kind .	St
1.1.3	Problem : I had bought a bluetooth dongle/radio which was a china make , im not sure .	St
1.1.4	When i connected to the pc it showed & quot ; USb device not recognized & quot ; message even though bluetooth support is present in xp service pack 2 .	St
1.1.5	The reason was that the device wasnt in the verified or approved list of bluetooth devices in xp .	St
1.1.6	So finally i had to try the cd that came with the dongle .	St
1.1.7	It had version 1.4 of blue soleil .	St
1.1.8	I installed it and every thing became fine .	St
1.1.9	Bluetooth dongle worked but only through bluesoleil not the default xp bluetooth manager , that meant i had to run bluesoleil manually before connecting the device or else there was no & quot ; device connected & quot ; message by the system .	St
1.1.10	Bluesoleil had the device drivers in it .	St
1.1.11	After installation of bluesoleil that cd remained unused in my bag , and due to friction with other materials it got harshly damaged .	St
1.1.12	One day i accidently uninstalled bluesoleil and when i tried installing it from my cd it refused as the cd was damaged .	St
1.1.13	I downloaded a copy from net , both version 1.4 and 1.6 and out of my surprise it didnt work either ! .	St
1.1.14	I wasted 2-3 days googling for alternatives but couldnt find much help on it .	St
1.1.15	Some pages gave me knowledge on where microsoft keeps the bluetooth device descriptions , but i couldnt make use of it in earlier stages .	St
1.1.16	My bluetooth device also had no brand or manufacturer which made matter worse to find the driver for it .	St
1.1.17	On the box pack it belonged to some local GEMINI company .	St
1.1.18	The dongle was transparent blue with red LED glowing on connection .	St
1.1.19	I finally found a solution to make xp recognize ur device and make use of inbuilt manager for bluetooth funtions .	St
