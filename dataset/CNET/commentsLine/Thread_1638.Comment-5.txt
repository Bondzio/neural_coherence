well, i've reset the book with the method you described there(by the link) (thanx a lot) and it began to work as if nothing was happen.. so i inserted usb boot-flash with win 7 and before installation decided to find out what's the temperature of cpu, cause that terrible heat drives me crazy.. so, i started aida64 (ex everest, from the menu below the installation choice), and went to &quot;sensor information&quot;.
i didn't manage to see any info, coz it freezed, but after rebooting i found out that book is yet again don't want to start, so i reset it again and it again began to live... so, one thing i recollected is that i installed aida64 about two hours before notebook hanged at first time... i don't think aida64 spoils hardware, but.. what can it be?
1) book is fine 2) starting aida64, looking for some info (first time it was stress-test or stability-test) 3) book is not fine, and only reset backs it to life 4) normal working at all.. o.o 5) again aida(simple sensor look up) and again failure till reset?
now i work on it for about a day, installed all drivers, programs, nothing seems to be wrong at all... your opinion?
