There is no photosmart 7200 AIO but a c7200 series.
So lets be sure we're talking the right printer model#.

Reboot and using the latest driver from the support website for the OS and model# you're using retry again after the install, what are the results?
If you still get the problem, then if using the new Win7 OS, you may have an issue not with the printer but rather with the OS.
Understand, also that your model# has been discontinued and in-depth driver and/or s/w support will be slow if that's the case.
