1.1.1	I have a Maxtor 80 gb firewire drive that all of a sudden is not recognized by Windoiws XP.	St
1.1.2	I powered off and restarted and it was recognized, then the computer acted as though I had shut off the drive, which I hadn't.	St

1.1.5	Same scenario when I tried the drive on another computer.	St

1.8.1	It's just above changing a light bulb in my book.	St
1.8.2	There is no jumper or other changes that I've found here.	St

1.8.4	Unscrew a few things, pop the drive out of the old and into the next box.	St
