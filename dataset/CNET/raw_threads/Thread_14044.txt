I have an HP 7200 series all-in-one printer with USB and ethernet connections. I have 2 wireless laptops with access to the internet. I want to buy some kind of wireless print sharer that will allow me to print from both laptops. I do not need/want the printer itself to be hooked up to the company network. All I want to do is print wirelessly from 2 laptops. I guess I want to plug the ethernet connection on the printer to an ethernet connection on whatever wireless device I should by and thats all the physical connections I have to make. I then just want to be able to print wirelessly from both laptops. I have a wireless router that came with my laptop and couldn't make that work for this job. What kind of hardware do I need? Regards, Andy
