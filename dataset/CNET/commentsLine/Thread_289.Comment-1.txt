router: netgear wgr614 number of computers: 2 desktops (1 dell and 1 gateway) 1 laptop (acer) operating system: all have windows xp home edition i've been pulling my hair out for a week trying to get this to work.
the 2 desktops have been networked for a long time now.
i am trying to add a laptop wirelessly to share files and a printer computer a (dell) can not find the laptop on the network but can find the other desktop (computer b) computer b (gateway) can find both laptop and computer a but when i click on laptop it says \\laptopname is not accessible.
laptop can not find any of the other two computers.
when i click on the network name it says that network is inaccessible...... i have disabled all the firewalls.
in fact, when i started trying to set this up the laptop didn't have any virus scan at the time.
computer a has avg free on it, as does the laptop now.
did not find any sign of a firewall with that virus scan.
all computers have guest account as active.
all computers have a folder set as having permission to be shared.
all computers can ping each other using their ip addresses.
i'm stumped.
i don't know what to do.
i don't know how i got computer b to find the laptop but it can't access it anyways.
please help and thanks in advance.
tracy
