<s> I have a Seagate External HD. </s>
<s> Plug into port on my comp, lights up so the powers good. </s>
<s> Open &quot;My Computer&quot; in my Windows XP(stop laughing, I know it's old). </s>
<s> Drive shows up but will not open. </s>
<s> After many moments waiting the error message comes up: &quot;Cannot open due to I/O damage&quot; I need all the info recovered as it stores pictures of a recently deceased daughter of mine. </s>
<s> I'm low tech, so take it easy. </s>
<s> I went to Seagate website to download drivers for updating, could not even find my product! </s>
<s> Downloaded Driver Manager and it says it's not plugged in.... Help - I'm confused. </s>
<s> I have purchased a new USB 2.0 Cable. </s>
<s> Still , no action in recovering the info from the Seagate. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> You hope it's the interface and not the drive itself. </s>
<s> You open the case and remove the drive. </s>
<s> With a little luck, it will have a standard PATA or SATA drive on the inside. </s>
<s> Most do but I've seen some proprietaries. </s>
<s> If it's just a standard drive, you connect it to a port on the motherboard. </s>
<s> Cross your fingers, boot the machine and hope its recognized. </s>
<s> If so, you extract your data and make immediate extra backups. </s>
<s> Afterward, you replace your external with two of them. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> USB cables to external hard drives have to be pretty short (usually around 2 feet) because of critical timing. </s>
<s> If you replace the cable with anything longer, you're almost certain to get wierd errors because the timing isn't right. </s>
<s> Generally replacing the cable that came with the drive is not a good idea because of that. </s>
<s> The other reason for short is that USB powered drives need every milliWatt that USB can muster. </s>
