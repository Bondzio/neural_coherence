<s> I'm planning on building a gaming PC within the next two weeks. </s>
<s> I don't want to spend too much money ($1000 limit). </s>
<s> I configured one on newegg with Socket 939 and it came to about $900. </s>
<s> I configured another with Socket AM2 for about $1000. </s>
<s> Is it worth $100 more to go with AM2? </s>
<s> I heard it's only 1% faster. </s>
<s> actually, the socket 939 configuration came to $950 </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> New technology always costs more especially after release. </s>
<s> Besides the AM2 is going to be the future of cpus from AMD, so really get it if you can. </s>
<s> HOWEVER, if you wait just a little longer the &quot;older&quot; stuff will come down in cost for sure, maybe in 30days or so. </s>
<s> You should already see some lessing of pricing of older cpus, etc.. tada -----Willy </s>
<s> The only advantage with AM2 at the moment is the support of ddr2 ram ( which is also more expensive) </s>
