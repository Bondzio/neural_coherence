1.1.6	Also , reliability of the product is important .	St
1.1.7	I was interested in VM initially but some of the reviews I had read were not so supportive .	St

1.1.10	& lt ; /div & gt ;	St
1.2.1	Odd idea .	St
1.2.2	I wonder how folk know why this is overkill for 99.99 % of us .	St

1.4.1	Some are miffed over the state of affairs in TV cards .	St
1.4.2	For example , no more cable cards and cable companies moving to all digital encrypted content .	St
1.4.3	At least these cards are $ $ and not $ $ $ .	St
