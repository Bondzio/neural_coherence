ok so i am super happy because something finally was displayed.
i had the jumper in 1-2 normal config and the video card plugged to the monitor via hdmi and there was no display.
so then i plugged the video card to the moitor via dvi and got soemthing to display.
it reads, &quot; the system bios has detected unsuccessful post attempt(s).
possible causes inclue recent changes to bios performance options or recent hardware changed.
press 'y' to enter bios setup or press 'n' to cancel and attempt to boot with previous settings.&quot;
