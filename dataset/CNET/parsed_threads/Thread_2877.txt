<s> Even after putting on the standoffs in the case, the video card does not seat perfectly but it does work. </s>
<s> Would the video card get damaged if it is not seated perfectly? </s>
<s> One time I found fried fingers on the PCB card edge. </s>
<s> You really need to fix it. </s>
<s> There is like about 1/16 of an inch left before it is fully seated. </s>
<s> Is the motherboard too low in the case? </s>
<s> If so some fiber washers on top of the mounting studs can help. </s>

<s> Where do you buy fiber washers? </s>
<s> And what kind? </s>
<s> Over the years I have some in my kit from prior machines. </s>
<s> I used this as an example of how to use what common part I see in most cases or motherboard mounting kits. </s>
<s> Any shop that sells PC parts (not Best Bu, Gold Max or such will have such) should have them. </s>
<s> After discharging any static electricity (see note below) and unplugging the PC get a straightedge and see if somethings bent. </s>
<s> You my need to replace the motherboard or video card. </s>
<s> Listen for arching electricity. </s>
<s> A sure sign the gap is too wide. </s>
<s> Look for a black sooty residue on the AGP/PCI/PCIe slot, this means it's been arching. </s>
<s> Arching is bad news. </s>
<s> What temperatures is this card running at? </s>
<s> Over 70C and you have a problem. </s>
<s> Approaching 70C might be a problem for some boards, over 66C or more. </s>
<s> check with the manufacturer of the card for the upper temperature limits for this card. </s>
<s> High operating temperatures might be a sign of poor connectivity between the card and the board. </s>
