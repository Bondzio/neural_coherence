you are pretty much limited if you are going to buy from a retail store in a small town and not buy online.
i would not buy a g router any more.
eventually all your other equipment will get upgraded to n and then you have to upgrade your router again.
i suspect n will be the best you can get for many years to come.
as far as speed goes in the short run they will exactly what you have today since you will need to run in g mode unless all your pc's have n already.
in the future when you upgrade your n speed will be based on which features both the router and the nic cards support.
most say they will do 150m and some say 300m.
your limiting factor is the internet so it does not really matter a lot.
these numbers are all best case numbers anyway.
buy the router for the other features, firewall, url filter etc etc.
the radio part are pretty much the same.
i would stay wired once it works it works... until the hardware fails.
