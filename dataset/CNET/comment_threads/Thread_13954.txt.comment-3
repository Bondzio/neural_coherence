Unfortunally, the 64-bit blockade will prevent you from using your computer for no more than 2 years unless cpu is 64-bit.
Also, Windows Vista is hardware demanding.
Then there's the stupid DRM issue.
So it may not work at all, but who knows?
Now when you say &quot;use a computer for 10 years&quot;, how do you use it?
I have a 10 year old PC that runs fine for Word, but it won't run any of the latest software or games.
But refurbs are a great buy.
