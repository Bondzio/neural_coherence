<s> Dear All, I am very new to this overclocking and recently i upgraded my PC to core i5 2310 and intel dh61ww. </s>
<s> I would like to overclock my CPU. </s>

<s> Some one please explain in detail how to overclock the given combination (I would be so happy if you could explain along with the terms in BIOS). </s>

<s> [...] de=i5-2310 Can I also overclock the intel HD 2000 graphics that came along with my i5. </s>
<s> Most of the folks that visit these forums are not interested in overclocking......they just want the machine to run and not give them any fuss. </s>
<s> If this was a car forum these folks are not interested in changing carbs/cams/exhaust to make the car faster. </s>
<s> They want the car to start. </s>
<s> When they step on the gas they want the car to go. </s>
<s> When they step on the brake they want the car to stop. </s>
<s> That's it. </s>
<s> The folks here might be able to help with removing some dead weight the machine is dragging around......that's a backward way of overclocking. </s>
<s> Read Overclocking advice and you find we found some items that were in conflict and dogging their machine. </s>
