i have a 40 gig hd but plan to get at least a 120 gig hd very soon.
how do i find out how much ram my pc can handle ( i'd like to upgrade to a gig of ram if i can.
btw i heard that i can add or remove start up programs through the &quot;run&quot; program to improve my boot speed.
how do i do that ??
thank you very much for your past reply and advice it is most appreciated.
