<s> a: drive has gone missing from mycomputer and when I enter A: at the DOS command prompt I get the message &quot;the system cannot find the drive specified&quot;. </s>
<s> I have tried all the usual things in troubleshooter and device manager and the floppy disk drive appears to be working except that it is not there! </s>
<s> An internet search reveals nothing of immediate use, anybody know how to get the floppy disk drive back on screen? </s>
<s> Thanks Peter A </s>
<s> Doesn't appear to be, based on your wordes. </s>
<s> Did this drive work properly and suddenly stop?? </s>
<s> How about a little history as to how you got to this point. </s>
<s> Tell us about the light on the drive, also what is in the first page of the BIOS re the floppy. </s>
<s> Peter, I happened to be in a secondhand (recycle) shop last Saturday, and there lay a pile of diskette drives, $ (Euro in fact, but that's no big difference) 1.50 each. </s>
<s> It might be a good investment. </s>
<s> But a new one isn't very expensive either. </s>
<s> However, first open the case (you need to open it anyway if you buy a replacement) and check if the cable is well inserted. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> when the pc first boots BIOS and shows hardware inventory; which means u may have to disable &quot;quiet boot&quot; in BIOS, also &quot;report all errors&quot; or &quot;check for floppy at boot&quot; so u get an error message if floppy isn't detected. </s>
<s> It also will power up the little LED on the floppy briefly in test. </s>
<s> Once in a while, I have to unplug the floppy and power cable and replug them because floppy wasn't found. </s>
<s> As said, get a cheap used floppy drive for quick replacement test and keep for backup. </s>
<s> According to the device manager troubleshooter the floppy disk drive is working OK. </s>
<s> However, thanks for the question about the light on the drive itself. </s>
<s> I don't recall seeing the usual operating light so I guess it's the drive at fault. </s>
<s> I won't have access to this PC for a while. </s>
<s> However, I'm surprised Windows XP troubleshooter did not tell me it's the diskette drive at fault if indeed that is the case.Next time I get to this PC, I'll check out the BIOS settings. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I have the exact same problem. </s>
<s> Nobody seems to have any answers. </s>
<s> I can boot the system with a DOS floppy disk just fine. </s>
<s> But once I'm in XP (Home Edition), I get &quot;The system cannot find the drive specified&quot;. </s>
<s> I have tried *everything* (except doing a complete re-format and re-install of the OS, which I don't want to do). </s>
<s> I'm at Service Pack 2, but this problem started a couple months before I installed SP2. </s>
<s> refers to A: drive missing in My Computer and a registry fix for it. </s>
<s> Does it show in Safe Mode? </s>
<s> If so, it can be a problem with some application that starts with XP. </s>
<s> You turn apps back on at start with MSconfig and see when it disappears. </s>
<s> We assume you have up to date spyware cleaner and have used it. </s>
