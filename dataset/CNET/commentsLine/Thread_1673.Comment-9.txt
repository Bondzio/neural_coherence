i was under the impression you were trying to establish multiple vpn connections from your one pc.
this shouldn't work.
as to the ip issues, one does have to be a little careful.
here's a note about that.
&quot;use default gateway on remote network&quot; on  since i don't know your ip plan, i can't predict an issue there.
your it staff should have that under control and admonish a home lan from using the same plan as the vpn lan.
