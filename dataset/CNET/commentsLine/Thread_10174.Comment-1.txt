a friend running windows xp has an hp color laserjet 1600 and she asked me to have a look at why it wasn't printing.
i clicked on the printer icon in the control panel which brought up the printer.
when i right clicked on the printer, it displayed the words 'paused - deleting'.
i un-paused the printer, the documents in her queue printed, and the printer disappeared.
i re-installed the printer but could never get anything to print.
the first item in the print queue would have a printing status of 'error-printing'.
running the windows troubleshooter yielded nothing.
i could not print a test page, print from dos, etc.. i then did a system restore to get her system back to a week ago.
the printer once again said paused - deleting, only the documents were the new documents i'd tried to print after the re-install.
i un-paused and the new documents printed.
and the printer again disappeared.
i can't seem to fix this.
any ideas?
