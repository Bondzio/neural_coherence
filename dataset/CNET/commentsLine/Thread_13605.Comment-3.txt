given the two models you have narrowed it down to i would suggest the dell.
i am a computer specialist at the school i attend so i have worked on every brand of computer.
i own three dells and an apple.
based on specification the dell is a bit more expensive but offers a much more robust and powerful machine.
also, hp computers tend to come with a ton of applications that clog up your computing experience.
dell is a much simpler computer to use.
that being said.
if you are looking for simplicity, i would agree with the previous message.
buy an apple.
it might be a bit more expensive but a baseline mac mini will perform in step with each of the computers you mentioned.
and it will offer a longer shelf life.
coming from someone who repairs computer for a living, you should buy a mac.
