I have an HP/w AMD 64 2.2Ghz, 3G RAM, 8600 GT vidcard w/256 RAM and on XP. The drive is a HP 740b. It is a lightscribe drive. I can play BattleFront 2 and Transformers from the DVD drive with no problem. Graphics are great and speed is great. But the processor stays at 100% in any DVD playback program and the play back is horrible. I am about to update the drive. Do I have a setting on my system set wrong?
