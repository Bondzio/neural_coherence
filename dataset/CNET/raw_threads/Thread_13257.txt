My initial setup is modem to 4-port Router (RP614 v4). I ran 4 cat 5e lines to outlets in 4 different rooms. For the basement, I have a wireless router WNDR3300 connected to the wall outlet running back to the router. Similarly on the 2nd floor, I have another outlet in which I have the WNR3500 wireless router. The other two LAN lines are for a desktop and a printer. I needed to setup two separate wireless because my signal with one was always weak in some part of the house. I have 4 computers and also have a PS3 and an xbox 360 in different rooms. I followed your instructions from an older post but it was for only 2 wireless routers without a 4port wired router. Could you please let me know how i need to configure the wireless routers. My wife and I consistently lose our VPN connections for our company computers despite excellent signals. I removed DHCP from both wireless and set the LAN IP address for each outside of the RP614 IP addresses. Still, not working. Thanks SO MUCH! Signed... frustrated

I couldn't figure our your connections but here's my example that works for me. Cable/DSL Modem -&gt; WAN port 1st WIFI router -&gt; PCs and second wifi router set up as above. I move the second wifi router closer to the area that needs coverage. Bob
