32-bit systems can never go beyond their limit, in very much the same way that you can never have 10m phone numbers with 7-digit dialing.
as for 64-bit becoming more useful, i think we're on the way there.
up to about a year ago, there were basically no 64-bit windows programs.
all that stuff was for servers only.
in time software developers will ensure support for it, and perhaps more of them will not just support it, but actually make use of it.
give it another year or two.
