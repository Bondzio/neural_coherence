you already have a 500gb sata 7200rpm drive so it's a fast hard drive.
a 10,000rpm drive is technically faster but won't help most apps.
if you're creating multi-gigabyte video files, a 10k drive may help a bit, but otherwise you won't notice the overall difference.
run the speed test and tweak test at  to make sure you're getting the broadband speed you're paying for and to tune your connection.
