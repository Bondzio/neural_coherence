Bought an XFX NDIVIA 8600GS PCI-E graphics card.
Every time I power up with the graphics card installed, I get no video at all.
I have tried disabling and deleting the current VGA adapter.
When I try to load the driver without the graphics card installed(from the supplied CD or from the Web site) I get an error saying &quot;the detected VGA does not seem to be XFX's product.&quot; And I can't try to load the driver with the card installed since I get no video on the screen.
I exchanged the graphic card with the same problem, so the card shouldn't be the problem.
I'm running Windows Vista Home Basic, with an ALTUS P5GC-MX/1333 motherboard and an Intel Core2Duo E6750 (2.6GHz) CPU.
Relevent BIOS settings: Plug and play - Yes PCI Latency Timer - 64 Allocate IRQ to PCI VGA - Yes Palette snooping - Disabled Boot graphic adapter priority - PCI Express/Int-VGA Internal graphic mode select - Enabled, 8MB Previously, I did not have a graphics card installed and the PCI-E slot had not been used.
Any suggestions would be appreciated.
