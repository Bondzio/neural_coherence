<s> Hi all I have the following configuration , Core i7 950 processor , WX58bp workstation Motherboard, 8 gigs of DDR3 RAM and Nvidia 9500 GT 1 GB video card . </s>
<s> I am planing to replace the video card with a Nvidia 560 GTX 2GB video card . </s>
<s> My query is , will the Nvidia 560 GTX video card pose any compatibility issues the the WX58bp motherboard ? </s>
<s> Also in future can I add another SLI Nvidia card , since the mother board has two PCI Express slots . </s>
<s> I am asking this because few years ago I had an compatibility issue with a Intel motherboard and a Nvidia 8600 video card . </s>
<s> The solution was to replace the Intel motherboard with a XFX motherboard with a N-Force chipset . </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> PSU. </s>
<s> Even the 8600 power draw is higher than the 9500 and I've heard techs call that a motherboard incompatibility. </s>
<s> I'd also keep an eye on http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/316549-30-compatibility-query-wx58bp-workstation-nvidia and http://communities.intel.com/thread/30584 There could be issues with a 32 bit OS here as the memory map could be cramped. </s>
<s> A less than seasoned tech might call that an incompatibility issue but it's not specific to this board or machine. </s>
<s> You'll see that on many machines where folk want big memory video cards. </s>
<s> I can't put an entire course on this here but you don't want to run a 32 bit OS on such a machine. </s>
<s> That being said, we have seen the Nvidia 9800 working on such a board. </s>
<s> You should be fine except for the 32 bit headaches or the usual driver nonsense. </s>
