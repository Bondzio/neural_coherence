thanks for the link bob^_^ did u notice the performance from single thread and multithread????
it was barely better.
so my speculations are looking tue.
1.6 ghz sucks man i got 2.7 ghx so that would put it WAAAAY up on the scales.
if you get a quad core it would go even more, if you OCed the quad it would tear the scale up.
apple sux anyway for computers.
did u notice that apple makes like 80% of their income from ipods alone?
so i doubt the ps3 is the best gaming rig.
i saw ur some of your posts and u dont look like an expert so u probably looked online and read some of sony's descriptions about the ps3 im not an expert either but i think i know more than you.
