so far just with cnet and consumer reports, but would love to post it to more sites.
let me know where you've done so and i'll be happy to post mine.
i've never done this before, but they so infuriated me that i feel an absolute need to do so.
the latest was that i waited for 90 minutes on the phone three days ago for yet another supervisor, then when i wasn't getting anywhere (they told me they'd have one call me back), i asked to speak to the call center manager or director, so they decided to hang up on me.
and, no surprise, three days later, still no return call and still no power adapter, so i still have a dead netbook.
thanks.
steve
