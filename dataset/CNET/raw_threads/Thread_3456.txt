I purchased a Belkin 802.11g wireless card for the desktop but it is not recognized as a device. I tried to search for new hardware and no luck. Can this be a SP2 problem? I know the slots are working because it will recognize other cards. (NIC and Sound card). I also know the wireless card works because I installed in another machine and it detected. The only thing was the 2nd machine was a Dell without SP2 installed. Any help would be appreciated.

Can this be a SP2 problem?&quot; I'm used to installed drivers for such things. Your post didn't tell, but let me share that Dell preloads some drivers so you don't have to. A stock install of XP will not have the drivers. Bob

I have the disk with the drivers and they are installed on the generic machine. It seems like the PC doesn't even see the card.

Your post didn't share the information so I can't tell if this is the issue. Bob

If this is a BX based board (only you will know) then this google... http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=VB-601+&btnG=Google+Search seems to agree, the issue can be.. 1. You need the latest BIOS. 2. You need to &quot;Reset Configuration Data&quot; in the BIOS. 3. You try another PCI slot since... the one next the AGP can be ... problematic. 4. The card is just incompatible with this board. 5. Someone disabled the IRQ PNP features in the OS. I offer this since I lost a day over that. The owner was thinking DOS days where IRQs couldn't be shared. Bob

I got it from a friend and put a Pentium III 500Mhz processor and it has 768 of RAM. I tried all the PCI slots and also verified the PnP option in the CMOS is enabled. I flashed the BIOS using the MI413 one from this site: http://www.fic.com.tw/support/motherboard/bios.aspx?model_id=16 . I also uninstalled SP2 and reinstalled XP without any luck.

I pulled the card and installed in another D610 and have wireless internet on that machine.I then took the good card and installed it in the 1st D610. No wireless internet. I plugged in an Ethernet cable to get internet. No Problem. I reformatted the hard drive ,did a fresh install,checked the bios and upgraded to A06 and still no wireless. any thoughts on this problem?
