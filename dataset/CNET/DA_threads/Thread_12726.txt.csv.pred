1.7.1	The WD1200JB is an ATA/100 ( Ultra ATA ) hard drive .	St
1.7.2	It is a standard 3.5 & quot ; form factor desktop drive .	St
1.7.3	What you need is an external enclosure with the following : - a 3.5 & quot ; external enclosure ( not the 2.5 & quot ; or 1.8 & quot ; enclosures for notebook drives ) - IDE ( may be listed as Ultra ATA or ATA/100/133 or UDMA5 or UDMA6 ) internal interface .	St
1.7.4	( Not SATA . )	St
1.7.5	- USB 2.0 external interface ( Firewire would be better if using a Mac ) - external power supply Alternative : - a 5.25 & quot ; external enclosure that can fit a 3.5 & quot ; hard drive Optional , but recommended : - metal case material to dissipate heat better than plastic - external enclosure with fan to better dissipate heat 3.5 & quot ; external enclosures with internal IDE and external USB 2.0 5.25 & quot ; external enclosures with internal IDE , external USB 2.0 , and fan ( For these , make sure the specifications say that it will take a 3.5 & quot ; drive )	St
1.8.1	This information is perfect .	Polite
1.8.2	Thank you so much .	St
1.8.3	Best wishes .	St
