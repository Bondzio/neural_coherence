Unfortunately during the process of installation I dropped it once. After installing it, I found that there was a lot of bad sectors in the disk (most likely due to the drop) and I managed to use Scandisk to fix them. Since then, the hard disk has been working fine. However, yesterday when I was shutting down the computer, it hanged and the hard disk activity light was on (no blinking). I waited for about 15 mins and there was further action from the computer, so I pressed the restart button and the computer restarted. As usual, it would attempt to detect the IDE devices at the start screen. Unfortunately, it was not able to detect the Seagate hard disk this time (it can still detect my CD-ROM and CD-Writer) and therefore was not able to boot up. I've tried using Win ME startup disk as well as the Win ME CD-ROM to try to boot up the computer, and the computer booted to the DOS prompt. But I was unable to reinstall Win ME as no hard drive has been detected/installed. Am I correct in thinking that my hard disk has really died and cannot be resurrected?

Next...go to the Seagate website and download their IDE hard drive diagnostic. Once downloaded, run the SW which will create a bootable floppy disk with their diagnostic program called Seatools. It should give you a reading on the drive's 'health'. Good Luck VAPCMD
