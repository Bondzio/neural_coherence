1.1.1	I recently replaced the motherboard in my system and when i hook everything back up, I get an error that NTLDR can't open multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1).	St
1.1.2	I know for a fact that absolutely nothing happened to the hard disk during transition, so i really don't think it could be a hardware problem, can anyone maybe point me in the right direction?	St
1.1.3	-Motherboard is a socket 754 Nvidia Nforce 3-a w/ Athlon 64-bit 3700+ -Drive is a Samsung 160GB SATA disk.	St
1.1.4	-Windows XP Pro SP2 -2 GB DDR 400 RAM Any thoughts or assitance would be appreciated.	St
1.1.5	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	Pick which article you want to try.	St

1.3.1	Ok good to know my drive is ok.	St
1.3.2	I've checked into those links and most seem to suggest a repair install of XP.	St
1.3.3	However, here's what's happening now....	St
1.3.4	I boot off of the xp cd, ignore the first option to repair, it detects my previous install which i then tell it to repair.	St
1.3.5	Once i do this, it copies all the files and reboots my machine but when the machine comes up nothing happens.	St
1.3.6	Nothing boots, setup does not continue.	St
1.3.7	Ideas?	St
1.4.1	Details are far too slim to offer much yet.	St
1.4.2	But think about any item you can unplug or disable since XP can't handle USB or much else until we get the drivers on it.	Sug
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	...if the new mobo has a different chipset.	St
1.5.2	reinstalling will preserve your apps.	St
1.5.3	if you've got an xp cd w/sp2, the reinstall won't be that big of a deal (just time-consuming to apply the patches).	St
1.5.4	if you only have an original xp cd, be prepared for frustration though.	St
1.6.1	Ok so i tried a few times to repair the install and each time the machine would reboot itself, but on reboot setup would not re-launch.	St
1.6.2	Now, when i try to boot the machine i no longer get a NTLDR error, the system does a POST, gets to the line about verifying DMI pool data, and does nothing.	St
1.6.3	No errors, no activity, just a blinking cursor, keyboard is useless for anything other than ctrl+alt+del.... My question at this point is even if i reinstall, what happens when i install xp, and it reboots during the process and this happens again?	St
1.7.1	It's usually something like a dead drive, bad IDE cable, noisy power supply or &quot;other.&quot; I have yet to see it be a Windows issue.	St
1.7.2	At the very lease, try the FIXMBR command.	St
1.7.3	Bob	St
1.8.1	and I checked and replaced the IDE cables for the floppy and CD for testing.	St
1.8.2	The SATA cable cam brand new with the new motherboard so i think that can be ruled out.	St
1.8.3	Power supply is fine, and I know for an absolute certainty that the hard drive was working as of last week, nothing has happened to it since.	St
1.8.4	BIOS can see the drive, so can Windows setup, it just refuses to boot.	St
1.8.5	I tried FIXMBR and FIXBOOT from the recovery console and it is still hanging at verifiying DMI pool.... Anymore ideas?	St
1.9.1	The SATA repair is complex when we change the motherboard.	St
1.9.2	Besides disabling USB, sound, ethernet and what ever else we can we can't use XP's repair and have a booting system.	St
1.9.3	On top of the repair we boot the XP SP2 CD then hit the magic F6 key to supply the NEW SATA drivers for this new board.	St
