i own a buffalo 1tb nas i use for media network storage and serving on my vista media center system.
the 1tb buffalo linkstation quad has 4 250gb wd caviar blue internal drives.
i am looking to upgrade this to a 4tb nas and have a few questions.
i would appreicate any help from anyone who may have already done this.
1 - does anyone know what vendor's drive that buffalo uses in the 4tb system?
they package the drive as a op-hd1.0t 1tb model.
their price is way too expensive.
does anyone know if they use the wd 1tb caviar black configuration?
does it make any difference?
2 - currently the linkstation quad is marketed as a 4tb solution.
does anyone know if the quad will support internal drives greater that 1 tb?
3- when i do the upgrade i plan on replacing one disk at a time and let the raid 5 system rebuild the drives.
does anyone know of any other methods...
