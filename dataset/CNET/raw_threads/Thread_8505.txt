If you have XP, let us know.....different method to do this and it might be able to be done through the Disk Management program in Administrative Tools. TONI

Locate the drive involved from the list of drives shown and see if you can right click it and get an option to format/create partitions with the empty space. Sometimes this will work and sometimes it doesn't depending upon how you formatted the drive to begin with..... TONI

XP Pro doesn't do past 127GB As noted at http://48bitlba.com XP Pro couldn't support over 127GB IDE drives until SP1. Any space above 127GB simply doesn't exist until you apply SP1 or SP2. After you apply the SP, then you use the Disk or Drive Management tool native to XP to create another partition with the new found space and format it. So it sounds as if when you installed XP Pro you didn't have SP1 or SP2 included in the install disk so you need to head to the update center and get the SP2 update installed before you can use disk manager to do what you need to do.
