<s> For some reason my screen size always resets to 640x480 when I startup my machine. </s>
<s> Then when I go to Control Panel and resize it, I am told I must restart my computer. </s>
<s> So I have done that, but the setting never adjusts back to where I need it. </s>
<s> Therefore, everything on the screen is blurry all the time. </s>
<s> Can anyone please help???? </s>
<s> I am completely at a loss for what to do. </s>
<s> Thanks... </s>
<s> This is usually a sign your video driver needs to be installed. </s>

<s> I cant think of why it would tell you to restart. </s>
<s> I think windows 95 used to do that, what windows do you have? </s>
<s> also maybe if it doesnt have the correct video card drivers it might be reverting to the default settings. </s>
<s> I would try updating or isntalling the video card drivers and monitor even. </s>
<s> if that doesnt work, try booting into safemode when you change it. </s>
<s> the method for going into safemode is different per windows version. </s>
<s> Hello, yes i need help in this area. </s>
<s> Please install the video driver for the video card. </s>
