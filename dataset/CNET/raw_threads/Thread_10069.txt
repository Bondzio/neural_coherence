Hi, the rig I'm building is: Shuttle SN26P 2 x ATI Radeon X850 Platinum Edition 256 PCIE 2 x 1GB Crucial Ballistix Tracer PLEXTOR PX-716SA/SW 1.44 Floppy drive (then swap in another Plextor) Windows XP Professional with SP2 I'm trying to decide between AMD processors. Either the FX60, or the X2 4800. Originally I was going to go with the FX55 or FX57 depending on budget, but I'm going to be doing multitasking which is why I've added dual core processors to my list, mostly burning CDs, DVDs, playing Video Games, mostly. The X2 4800 and the FX60 actually looked similar, only difference I could find was process speed 2.4 vs 2.6 ghz. Are there other differences, could someone educate me?

Both are dual core, and when looking at specs, except for processor speed 2.4 and 2.6 ghz they appear identical. Could someone explain what the difference is. For clarification, both are Toledo, both are 1.3-1.4volt, both are 90nm, both L1 and L2 Cache are identical, I mean what is the difference? I'm on the fence, leaning towards X2 only because it's cheaper.
