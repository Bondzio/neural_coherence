That drive is going to annoy you since you can't create a DVD-R disc. Tell them that you want an all-format DVD recorder. Bob

I gave up on H-P after wasting many hours of my time, including several hours on the phone with H-P's technical support. A DVD+RW disk will not play in the typical DVD player. I have tried it on several myself. - Nard

HP has a bad habit of sticking with a &quot;standard&quot; in their company even if the customers are screaming. In this case its DVD PLUS R/W drives. You will not be happy with just a PLUS drive and you will be told by HP (or any sales-droid) that PLUS will be all you need. Given that I can buy an all format 8X DVD recorder for under 149 bucks, this is a piece of the machine that is definitely out of tune with today. Bob

I'm not sure what manufacturues will offer a multi-format, but if you can get them to leave out the DVD+RW, and thus leaving an empty drive bay, you can just have one added in by a store like Circuit City or Compusa, or you can install one yourself, if you know how...
