1.1.1	G'Day , I am currently purchasing a computer and these are the specs of the system that i think i am going to get .	St
1.1.2	If someone could tell me if they are ok or not it would be appreciated .	St
1.1.3	Athlon 2800 Barton 256 GeForce fx5600XT TV out 1*GA-7vt600pl , viakt600 , 5 * PCI , 3 * DDR 400 , agp8X .	St
1.1.4	6USB2 , SATA , LAN 80 GB Hard Drive 512 Ram DVD Burner Windows XP Home creative live 5.1 FDD Belkin Wireless keyboard mouse bundle 2 years parts and labour .	St
1.1.5	Is there anything in there that i should change , was thinking about maybe a 3000 processor .	St
1.1.6	The system will mainly be used for the net , study and very few games .	St
1.1.7	Thanks a lot .	St
1.1.8	Justin .	St
1.2.1	Keep with the 2800 .	St
1.2.2	If you only use it for net study and a few games , that setup will be more than adequate .	St
1.2.3	If you 'd still like the speed of a 3000 , you can always overclock if you feel confident doing so .	St
1.2.4	Honestly though , the 2800 is fine .	St
1.3.1	XP pro- if it 's a website build it 'll only cost 50 $ or less to do it now and you 'll like the features / controls better right off the bat ( some builder / suppliers if leaned on will upgrade to pro for no charge . )	St
1.3.2	Make sure it comes with real recovery disks-not a partition on the HD , bigger hard drive ( you 'll wish for more space in less than 6 months ) perhaps the ATI agp card instead of the Geforce-more ram up front-1Gb at least .	St
1.4.1	about the cpu as thats the same one im useing on my own puter roughly same stats its very fast .	St
1.4.2	ive built a puter in shop i work in with 3000 in it unless you use a bench mark program you wont see a diference stick with 2800 go pro	St
