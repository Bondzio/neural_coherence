My Microsoft wireless mouse 5000 is acting up sometimes it's ok other times it will not respond and is very jerky it seems ok when first start up but deteriorates the longer the computer is on, I am also having trouble with I.E. constantly closing could be associated

Following Jimmy's tips (TIPS FOR A PROBLEM FREE COMPUTING EXPERIENCE) in http://forums.cnet.com/7723-6142_102-602623/how-to-format-c-drive-using-xp-nothing-is-working/?messageId=5504325#message5504325 (if you happen to use Windows, as you do) can be recommended also. As we say here: the best protection is YOU. Kees

As far as a subscription (purchased) A/V software is concerned, the only Norton package that I've seen to be pretty effective when it comes to malware/ real time protection is the Norton 360 the rest are pretty basic and lack certain features. The tech shop should, hopefully, steer you in the right direction. There are so many opinions on what to use and not to use that discussions could go on ad infinitum. Best of luck!!

But after 5 years it might be better to buy a totally new PC in stead of upgrading some parts in your old PC. That mainly depends on what parts it are. Then also, it's easy to transfer data and to re-install programs (if their license permits installation on 2 PC's at the same time). Kees

11864	10	602206	5507581	5507462	Kees_B	10/12/13 12:28 PM	1.38158088E12	Re: upgrade	So that's a new motherboard, RAM, processor and disk drive(s, maybe add a SSD) and OS. That's in essence a new PC in an old case with an old sound card and an old dvd-drive. Kees
