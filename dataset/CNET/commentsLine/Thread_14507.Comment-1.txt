it seems i've read a million blogs, reviews, etc.
etc.
about mac's being the best for graphic designers.
and i would more than likely concur with this statement, but what about the other design professions out there.
3d-graphics, modellers, game designers, furniture and industrial design, architects, interior designers....and the list goes on.
any thoughts anyone?
