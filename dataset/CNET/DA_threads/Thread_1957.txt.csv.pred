1.1.1	Ok I have a Dell E520 series .	St
1.1.2	Long story short my old pc died and had to use my student loan money and had to order from dell or HP .	St
1.1.3	ok so i have 2.8GHz intel core 2 duo 256mb xfx 8600GTS ( added ) 3gb of ram ( added ) windows vista home premium 32bit and the crappy mobo they give you is basically bottle necking my proformance so I want to upgrade my mobo but to do that , i need to get a new CPU fan , PSU , and case because Dell make everything just for there parts .	St
1.1.4	well none of that is the issue , my issue is if I get a new motherboard and plug in the hard-drive i am using right now will my current Vista system work ?	Ques
1.1.5	Will the Vista Reinstallation DVD that came with the system work ?	Ques
1.1.6	Ive herd so many un-sure and mixed answers that I want to be 100 % sure before I spend money on these parts .	St
1.2.1	Still a maybe .	St
1.2.2	It should n't work since the license is only for the Dell but you read that some succeed .	St
1.2.3	Dell 's answer should be & quot ; no. & quot ; As to the bottleneck the only one I see is the 8600 card .	St
1.2.4	Gamers usually go for the 8800 .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Well im not looking to play Crysis and I dont have any need for an 8800 yet .	St
1.3.2	But the memory speed and PCIe speed on my motherboard are so bad that I cant hit any benchmarks that my computer should be able to hit .	St
1.3.3	I called Dell and the guy I talked to said it would work but the people they have working there arnt the brightest in the world .	St
1.4.1	If you get a different brand of motherboard , your current windows wo n't load , so re-intalling windows is a must .	St
1.4.2	I have tried to use the XP installation that comes with Dell on my other pc , but the CD 's protection did n't allow me to do it .	St
1.4.3	On another note , keep in mind that a lot of these installation disks that come with dell , sony , or toshiba computers are not actual windows instalation disks ; they are image disks .	St
1.4.4	So , they probably ( almost certain ) wo n't work on your new mobo .	St
1.4.5	The kind of control that you want to have over the different parts in your pc is not easy to accomplish when you are working with a & quot ; package & quot ; pc built by dell or any other manufacturer .	St
1.5.1	thank you so much your are the first person to answer my question	Polite
1.6.1	You want to upgrade your mtrbd , thus that tells me you want to keep the mtrbd..	St
1.6.2	If not , then you replace the mtrbd .	St
1.6.3	you will have problems .	St
1.6.4	As the other poster mentioned , you will need a new OS install CD , as most OEM type CDs provide install only for the system or brand they were sold under .	St
1.6.5	While you can swap much of the old system ( h/w ) to a new mtrbd .	St
1.6.6	you 're stuck getting the drivers when the new OS has been installed .	St
1.6.7	Vista , being a PITA if you stay with it , may not have Vista available drivers from their vendors once you correctly ID the proper drivers needed .	St
1.6.8	If you stay with the old mtrb .	St
1.6.9	and the whole purpose was to reduce or remove bottleneck , then really what was the point if you blame the mtrbd .	St
1.6.10	as the bottleneck fault .	St
1.6.11	Be sure to check Dell 's support website for any bios updates that may address some issues and if they apply to you , then you need them .	St
1.6.12	Hopefull , that may address yopur bottleneck issue .	St
1.6.13	tada -- -- -Willy	St
