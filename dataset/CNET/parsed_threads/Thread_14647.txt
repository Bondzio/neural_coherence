<s> My Dad has installed a new motherboard, chip and hard drive with XP and this is working well. </s>
<s> He's installed the old hard drive as a second disk as he didn't back up the data (as instructed!). </s>
<s> He's set the jumpers correctly, the disk is shown in the BIOS and he can see the disk in the disk management. </s>
<s> There is no drive letter assigned and right clicking only gives him the option to format. </s>
<s> It would seem that the computer thinks that the drive has not been formatted. </s>
<s> He tried to use this old disk with the new motherboard and processor and the bios found it and tried to boot XP but it got into a loop. </s>
<s> We tried fixboot but this has made no difference. </s>
<s> (Probably made it worse!) </s>
<s> I'm getting all this by telephone (usually at around 11pm) so I don't have the ability to tweek and mess about to see if I can get it working. </s>
<s> I need perhaps a few bullet point things he can do to see if he can access the data on the drive to save me a 200 mile round trip to go sort it out. </s>
<s> Whilst my evil twin says he should suffer the consequences of not backing up the data, he's my Dad! </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for any suggestions of things to try. </s>
<s> Hard disks over 127GB are not supported in XP. </s>
<s> (you wrote XP) So a few owners freak out when the drive doesn't show up after a new install. </s>
<s> They go about running data recovery software and wipe the drive out in the process when all they needed was to install SP1 or later. </s>

<s> Hi, thanks for your answer. </s>
<s> I had totally forgotten that point so we made sure we had the service pack but it is still doing the same thing. </s>
<s> I feel somewhat hampered by not being in front of the machine - not sure if there is any more info I can give. </s>
<s> Try these (use google to find.) </s>
