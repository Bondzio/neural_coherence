If you are not looking for a business grade solution what works is to take a router that you can load the user written firmware like tomato on. You can then force the DNS server to use OPENDNS site. This site has a free content filter...mostly. Their are many firewall and IDP options in the user firmware releases. Of course this does not stop someone who knows how host files work.
