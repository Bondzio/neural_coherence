Please redirect me if I am mistaken. I am doing some research on migrating off my mainframe system here onto a server system. My question is what physical machines and OS have others used to do this. I am not asking for someone to tel lme exactly what and how I should do it, just give a generalknowledge of what others out there have done. The requirements I have are (1) quad processors (2) at least 8gigs of RAM (3) at least 144gig of disk space oon at least 4 hot-swappable disks as i would like to make a Raid 5 array and have a hot spare. I am currently looking at and trying to familirize myself with Solaris by Sun. It looks like a very capable OS and Sun looks to be making some great server machines. What do you guys think? Thanks for you time. Mac

IMHO, Sun makes great servers and Solaris is a rock solid OS however given their present financial state, I am not sure how long Sun is going to be in business. So if you're looking for long terms support, be careful about getting into a Sun platform. As for Storage, consider SAN's from SUN, Hitachi. We recently deployed Apple X-Serve RAID and it works great coupled with a good fibre-switch.

Of course I can't know what's driving this requirement but let's compare the old XEONs to the new ones? The old Xeons would not deliver as many mips as the latest at the same GHz but would meet your spec. SUN also may deliver you Opterons and not Xeons so without a benchmark it could happen your quad CPU system could be outperformed by a simpler but faster dual core XEON? I think you should toss this spec back into the pot and cook it more. Bob

I understand the point you are trying to make about processor performance. However, as you can see from my handle, I am but a lowely intern doing research and was given these requirements from the boss. He basically said he wanted to double the processing and ram of the current mainframe we have that runs at 50mips, dual processor 4gb ram setup and have at minimum the same ~144GB of storage space. I have been looking and San's and you have lead me into what would have been my next question. In these new servers where would i get better performance in terms of speed, internal SCSI disk drives or a fiber SAN?

I have been on the phone with Sun a little bit and got some reccomendations on which machines they think would suit my needs. I have also done some researching on IBM, Dell, HP and a few others machines also. I would just like to get some information about what others out there are doing and how it is working out for them. Not to mention we WILL NEED long term support for this hardware so if Sun is in financial disaray that could be disasterous. It is imperative that we not have this hardware be unsupported. If it were to go down.....lets just say many bad things that would effect us all WOULD happen.
