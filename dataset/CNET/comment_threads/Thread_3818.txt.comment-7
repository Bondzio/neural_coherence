Today a member is sharing a story about a drop from 1.5 feet and the HDD and other parts have failed.

The i5 wins the CPU benchmark round.

The 14 inch screen for me.

The x202e looks great for hitting the round to do support for our apps.
But for programming I'm back to some 15.6 inch laptop with the usual 16GB RAM, big HDD, etc.
