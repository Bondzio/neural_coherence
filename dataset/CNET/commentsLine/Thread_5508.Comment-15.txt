i suggest that you follow the steps (from these responses so far) in this order.
1. first, do not change anything on the drive until you have tried all these steps.
2. try a different usb cable.
3. try a different computer or a desktop 4. try rebooting with the drive plugged in with a good usb cable.
5. try connecting the drive without the old enclosure.
i have used a kit similar to this, with success:  6. if all this fails, try to retrieve the data.
i have used easus with success after improperly unplugging the hard drive.
here is a free recovery utility  if you connect successfully, run checkdisk to repair damaged files, before making any other changes on that disk.
