1.1.1	I could really use some help as this is bringing me all kinds of stress .	St
1.1.2	I will try to set this up in an easy to understand format as to how I have come to this issue .	St
1.1.3	-Some windows components were missing on my Hard Drive , so I reinstally windows XP ( upgrade ) to try and get those back .	St
1.1.4	-Put in disc and it copies what it needs then my computer reboots to start the setup .	St
1.1.5	-Everything is going fine and eventually the installation stops .	St
1.1.6	The bar wo n't move and I leave it like this for several hours .	St
1.1.7	-Eventually I reboot the computer in hopes of either just going back to my desktop and ignoring the issue or to try and reinstall it again .	St
1.1.8	-Everytime my hard drive loads I get a blue Windows screen that says & quot ; Windows XP Setup is restarting & quot ; -After the blue screen is done loading it goes to a black screen with nothing on it but the mouse pointer which I can move .	St
1.1.9	This never goes away and the setup does n't restart .	St
1.1.10	-I can not figure out how to make it no longer try to restart the set up and just load my windows XP .	St
1.1.11	-Nor can I figure out how to completely restart the Windows XP setup/upgrade from the beginning instead of letting it restart .	St
1.1.12	Now this is my main issue .	St
1.1.13	I want to just be able to get back in to my main Hard Drive , but the restarting setup issue wo n't let me .	St
1.1.14	I have the disc in and everything and no matter what the set up wo n't restart .	St
1.1.15	I did manage to go to an option to just completely restart the Windows XP set up from the disc before my hard drives loaded or anything .	St
1.1.16	But I get this when it tries to install Setup did not find any hard disk drives installed in your system .	St
1.1.17	Now I have tried many solutions and this is what I have currently done .	St
1.1.18	-I installed Windows XP on a slave drive and manually boot that one so I can get to a desktop .	St
1.1.19	-I can not get to the internet , I am missing my Ethernet drivers .	St
1.1.20	Ca n't find the disc but I can solve that if I try hard enough .	St
1.1.21	-I can access my main hard drive from this other hard drive I am currently using with the newly installed OS on it .	St
1.1.22	-All of my files are still on my main hard drive , so nothing has been lost .	St
1.1.23	If someone does n't know how to fix it so my main hard drive can stop trying to restart set up I have two further questions .	St
1.1.24	1 .	St
1.1.25	Is there a way to start the windows XP start up again that will affect a hard drive that is n't my main ?	Ques
1.1.26	For example I am currently using my storage drive as my main because my main is having that issue .	St
1.1.27	Can I while using the back up as my main , do something to make the Windows XP install disc affect another hard drive rather than the one I am currently running it off of ?	Ques
1.1.28	So that I can in essence start the set up/upgrade over on the Hard Drive that keeps trying to restart Windows XP setup ?	Ques
1.1.29	2 .	St
1.1.30	Since my main hard drive loads as the master by default and I manually switch to my 2ndary drive to run the newly installed OS .	St
1.1.31	Seeing as how I can access the files on my real MAIN Hard Drive , is there a file I can delete that would cause that hard drive to stop trying to restart Windows XP Setup ?	Ques
1.1.32	That way it would stop the set up and just load the Windows XP is currently has the files for on it , as it was an upgrade and no files seem to be missing .	St
1.1.33	Thank you for any help .	St
1.1.34	I really want to avoid reformatting/clearing any of my hard drives if at all possible .	St
1.1.35	Ideal solution would be to just be able to delete some file that causes my Hard Drive to automatically attempt to restart the Windows XP setup .	St
1.1.36	So it will bypass that and just load the Windows XP OS that I already had installed anyways .	St
1.2.1	I read your post twice and no hardware was noted .	St
1.2.2	Can you tell what hardware issue you suspect ?	Ques
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Honestly I do n't know if it is Windows XP problem or my hard drive .	St
1.3.2	No one is helping me on any help forum I have tried .	St
1.4.1	The details are sparse about your issue .	St
1.4.2	Since this is the hardware forum I would expect to see the hardware details , maybe some words about the machine 's age , the exact version of the Microsoft CD and so on .	St
1.4.3	As it stands I would have to ask for all that .	St
1.4.4	Remember this are all volunteer forums so you have to do the best you can at making your best post .	St
