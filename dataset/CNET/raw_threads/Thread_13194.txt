It was connected and I think she screwed with settings but won't admit it. The network consists of 2 laptops and 2 desktops. Her XP laptop hooks up ok. My laptop and desktop (both Vista) both hookup ok. Her desktop e-machine (XP) sees the network but won't connect. I am using Belkin wireless adapters on both desktops and they are ok. It hooks up with ethernet cable ok. I've tried everything I can think of to get it to hook up but it just won't. Using the linksys setup utility, it says that it is hooked up, but it isn't! I seem to be unable to find the network settings in xp. I don't want to re set the router (Linksys WRT54GL) because then I will have to reinstall the 3 units that are working. Anything I can do? ABC's please. I'm senile and used to running Vista now, can't remember XP stuff. thanks a bunch. George
