It connects to the ISP but after 15 secs is thrown out. The ISP help-line say that this is a very rare but known problem but this seems strange to me. Anyone out there have a clue what to do apart from buying a new router from a different company? Laptop: Dell 1525 W7.

In the end I downloaded the latest software for the router and hey presto here I am writing back to you from the middle of my back yard, sipping a very large bushmills and enjoying the dusk!
