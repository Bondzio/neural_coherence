<s> I have a question regarding turning on and off the external hard drives the proper way. </s>
<s> I own a samsung Adaptec 250 GB and a Seagate Freeagent Pro 750 GB. </s>
<s> 1) When I turn on my hard drives, there is a clicking sound (dinging dinging) or something like that. </s>
<s> Q: Is that normal that there is clicking sound when you turn your external hard drives on? </s>
<s> 2) When I want to turn it off, I first go to safely remove hard drive and stop the drives there. </s>
<s> With my Seagate, I manage to turn it off silently after a few trials and errors but with my Adaptec, I always get the clicking sound when I turn it off. </s>
<s> Q: Is it normal that there is clicking sound when you turn off your hard drive? </s>
<s> (my seagate can be turned off without making any clicking noise. </s>
<s> The Adaptec makes sound when turn off, even after i stopped it through the safely remove hardware thing.) </s>
<s> not sure abotu external drives but NOTHING should be making a clicking sound in a hard drive.. that normally indecates a failure of the drive or read head.... but for external... i don't know if its the drive or something with the casing </s>
