in my few short years working with pc's, i have found that they don't have a particular life span.
some hard drives have a short life while others live on past 15 years old.
just keep the hard drive in good shape by defraging it when it calls for it.
many times it will say that you don't need to defrag this volume and other times it will.
but keep in mind that when you defrag it when its not needed, you can shorten the life span of the drive.
how do i know all of this?
well i am a self taught computer wiz.
i have learned by making big mistakes.
now i go around helping people who need computer help.
also if you overclock a pc, you can shorten its life as well.
here is some helpful advice.
get rid of that zone alarm.
you don't really need it.
instead, try superantispyware and glary utlities.
these are both free and do wonderous work with the pc.
