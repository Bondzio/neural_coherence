More information about WHY you can't play it, like &quot;it doesn't recognise the mouse&quot; or &quot;it says the monitor doesn't have a supported resolution&quot; or &quot;it fails to install because it's the 64-bit version and I have a 32 bit OS&quot;.

But the OS setup could be incorrect in some way so ask the maker. As no maker was noted, I can't look into this. Bob

What is the OS type? Does FC3 even start to play? What are the results of any other game? have all the latest drivers and patches been installed? How does the PC in general operate? http://babysoftmurderhands.com/2012/12/far-cry-3-max-settings-graphics-system-requirements/ tada -----Willy

It ran through the beginning cut scene and into a few minutes of game play then crash. I made sure to download the latest drivers and patches for the game. It is based off Uplay, and patches the game before I play. PC began with issues, MEMORY MANAGEMENT when I installed the RAM in a 2,4 pattern in the sense 1,2,3,4 slots i used slots 2 and 4. That didn't help so I switched it to 1,2 and then installed another set of RAM in 3,4. I dont have that issue anymore.

If they leave out details we lose a few rounds asking for that detail. We know that self built units usually suffer from lack to updates to the hardware such as BIOS, drivers for EVERYTHING plus those helper apps. For example I got my old desktop out and what a dog. I got lucky in that I do this a lot and did a quick research about what drivers and apps were needed. I started with the BIOS and the missing nugget for this one was Intel's RST app. That one is not a driver but for this machine, it's needed to get the performance up. Ask your machine's maker for such a list. Bob

If it still doesn't you go back to the shop where you bought the PC and let them fix it under warranty. What happens if you reinstall the game from the original disk without any patches? It should work then.It's the first thing the shop will ask you: stock settings and a stock game to prove the machine is defective. If you assembled it yourself (&quot;tried to make&quot; can be interpreted so) it's your own task to find out what's wrong. Kees

I understand its my own task to find out whats wrong. I am in this forum to learn from other peoples oversights, I may have missed something. I will try to reinstall the game. thanks

Even in Windows 8 this fails today. It's up to the designer, builder and such to find all the updates, drivers and helper apps. I can't guess all of them but if there is a downside to building it's this. The upside is you learn more than you bargained for. My short check list is to work from the bottom up. I update the bios and if cards have firmware updates I do all that before I install the OS. Then the OS goes in and I find drivers for motherboard, audio, video and then the helper apps such as Intel's RST, media controls, wifi control and more. Figure on 10 to 15 packages on average. Bob

If you've a bunch of gaming, you'll find that easily is so. Which is why i asked in my prior post. Generally, speaking you have to settle the PC issues themselves before anything else. In other words the PC must be in stock or default form, no hi-end setting or user introduced tweeks. Just make sure it works beforew you move to gaming levels. Then fine-tune the game to what the PC can offer. The game setting are easier to adj. than the PC, because the PC was working before you went the gaming route. Which is why I offer in yet other posts, that basically want a &quot;top-end PC&quot; for gaming needs, because gaming is so power hungary for *ALL* resources whatever they may be. Further, cooling is a big issue as i see it and better be good. . The i3 is a decent cpu but it isn't all that great for gaming, though better than older cpus. Next, the Win8 OS, well that's still open as how it handles gaming or what is still required for the best operation. So, if you can accept basic or FC3 levels as they initially install, because it finds its own level of sorts. If it seems to run then or not at all well, then maybe the PC itself still needs to be tweeked. Tweeked as NOT simply asking for hi-performance setting but what makes the PC works with everything else besides gaming. Any patches and drivers MUST be Win8 ready or capable, if MUST state so or be allowed using older Win7 offering. Last, the game itself should support whatever is being given it. Even, it accepts cpu level much lower than yours, it has to say somewhere, it supports the i3 from the makers itself. Now, with all these drivers and patches and what have you, you basically create a new PC of sorts but do all these accept each other and not fall into a toxic mix. Which is why i state, gaming problems tend to create issues regular PC won't see anywhere near as soon as loading some new game. Also, since you build this yourself, you need to recheck all your work, don't take anything for granted, yeah sometimes a boo-boo takes along time accept if some small detail was forgotten. If you like, I suggest you get PCWizard 2012 and load it to see all the variables of your system PC has. It provides deep details and important real facts of just what you have installed h/w and s/w. Google for it. Last, sometimes you're too ahead of the gaming world. Your h/w mix or system just needs a fix NOT YET available from the game maker. You may want to check gaming websites to query there as those hot gamers may offer greater clues, tips, and/or hints to help you. tada -----Willy

As I read you are changing clocks from stock I see a big reason to crash. -&gt; Did you go get the RAM &quot;specs&quot; and see if your BIOS settings match? That's a pretty deep area that the maker of the PC (you in this case) have to sort out. It's an area that can really torque folk since they never imagined how much detail is required to integrate parts. Bob
