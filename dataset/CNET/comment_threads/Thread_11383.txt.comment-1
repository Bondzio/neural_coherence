Hi guys, Need advice on whether or not I should upgrade my rig.
It has served me well for the past 3.5 years.
I plan to upgrade the following components as my 670 gtx is perfectly fine: i7 920 ===&gt; i5 3570k ASUS P6T ===&gt; ASUS P8Z77-V PRO Windows 7 premium 64 ===&gt; Windows 8 Do you think there is a need right now if my primary purpose is gaming (Planetside 2 for example)?
My i7 920 is stock and overclocking on air is not an option where I live especially during summer.
