1.1.1	First of all , my sincere apologies for having posted this question as a reply on another issue by mistake .	St
1.1.2	I have a Mac G3 Powerbook , 333Mhz , 4GB Hd , 8MB Video , CD .	St
1.1.3	Everytime I try to upgrade my X OS operating system from 10.2 version to a newer version I get a message saying I do not have enough HD space .	St
1.1.4	I have transferred quite a few files to a portable drive to clear space but still get the message .	St
1.1.5	Is there something else I can do to get the upgrade ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks , Sandovh	St
1.2.1	that springs to mind is for you to purchase a larger HD .	St
1.2.2	The next question is & quot ; What OS are you attempting to upgrade to & quot ; ?	Ques
1.2.3	There is a limit as to the version of OS X that is compatible with this laptop .	St
1.2.4	You are going to max it out at 10.3.9 ( Panther ) Memory is a consideration too , how much do you have installed ?	Ques
1.2.5	New HD 's can be purchased for a reasonable sum and some suppliers even install the drive , move your original stuff to it and put your old drive into a Firewire enclosure .	St
1.2.6	That last bit is not going to help you as I do n't think you have firewire on that machine .	St
1.2.7	Does this machine have a Bronze Keyboard ?	Ques
1.2.8	If so , putting your old drive into an enclosure that fits into the CD/Battery slot is also an option .	St
1.2.9	Another consideration for that machine is a processor upgrade and lots of RAM .	St
1.2.10	Both are possible and reasonably easy to do .	St
1.2.11	If you really do not want to spend any money at all , the absolutely , positively , definitely NOT recommended way , is to Boot from the installer CD and choose Format and Install .	St
1.2.12	This WILL KILL every piece of data that you have on that machine .	St
1.2.13	It will install your new OS though .	St
1.2.14	DO NOT DO THIS ! , pretty please .	St
1.2.15	Hope this helps , let us know what the answers are P	St
1.3.1	I would suggest that you check to see how much space the new upgrade requires as to what the total space you have on your hard drive .	St
1.3.2	It just simply may be too large for your existing drive .	St
1.3.3	If that is the case there are only two possible solutions - 1 ) Upgrade to a larger version of the PowerbBook which will have a much larger hard drive .	St
1.3.4	2 ) Get an Apple repairmnan to see if he can install a larger hard drive for you that would have room for your new OS 10.2 and the other material you plan to use on the hard drive AND then get a portable disk drive , such as a LaCie ( 200 Gb or less ) disk drive , to carry with you to store your material on which you are working .	St
1.3.5	Most of these use either ( or both ) a USB / USB-2 connector or some use a Firewire connector if your computer will accept it .	St
1.3.6	Fire wire is usually faster .	St
1.3.7	You may need a USB hub if you have only one USB outlet on the side of your PowerBook .	St
1.3.8	Good luck in your project .	Polite

1.4.1	Hi , It sounds like you 're running a Lombard Powerbook , which can run OSX Panther , but ... & quot ; crawl & quot ; may in fact be a more appropriate term .	St
1.4.2	Why do you want to upgrade ?	Ques
1.4.3	Is there a program you want to run ?	Ques
1.4.4	Speaking of running , you 're going to run out of space very quickly on a 4GB drive .	St
1.4.5	Upgrading to Panther will accelerate the process .	St
1.4.6	Additionally , should you choose to invest in a larger hard drive , I believe you may have to do & quot ; special formatting & quot ; on it so the OS sees the drive correctly .	St
1.4.7	I know that on the Wallstreet ( the model before yours ) , drives larger than 7.5 GB must be partitioned so that OSX resides on the first partition of the drive , and that partition MUST be 7.5 GB or less .	St
1.4.8	Another space-saving tip : when installing , you can choose to omit some utilities and language localizations , but in Panther , you will still be squeezed quite a lot on this machine .	St
1.4.9	I recommend finding a decent used PowerBook on ebay or some other venue , like perhaps Craigslist.org if you can .	St
1.4.10	I have a 400 MHz G4 Powerbook Mercury and , if loaded with enough RAM , this machine performs very well for most tasks .	St
1.4.11	It 's not at all bad for a four-year-old computer .	St
1.4.12	I have updated the hard drive to a 40GB ( I acquired the machine in dire need of repair , which made it very affordable ) and brought the RAM to 512 ( though it can go to 1GB ) .	St
1.4.13	On your machine , the most you can go to is 512MB .	St
1.4.14	That 's the thing , really .	St
1.4.15	If you want to run software published after your machine was released , you will need to perform some hardware upgrades anyway .	St
1.4.16	And while you 're upgrading , you should seriously consider all of your options .	St
1.4.17	If you are interested in upgrading to Tiger ( OSX 10.4 ) , Apple does not support this OS on your machine .	St
1.4.18	There is , however , a utility you can use called XPostFacto to install Tiger .	St
1.4.19	While I know that XPostFacto works well with Panther on the Wallstreet PowerBooks , I have no experience with Tiger on a laptop such as yours .	St
1.5.1	The typical 10.3 installation is about 3 GB - there is little chance that you can install it on this HD , especially since you probably already have programs and files take take up more than 1 GB .	St
1.5.2	There is no way that you can easily run 10.3 on this small space , even if you are somehow able to install it .	St
1.5.3	I would get at least a 20GB drive , install it in the G3 , and put the old drive in an external USB enclosure , so that you can use the old drive as a backup .	St
1.5.4	Good luck !	Polite
1.5.5	Dan	St
1.6.1	Your description indicates that you have a 1999 model PowerBook , otherwise known as a ''Lombard . ''	St
1.6.2	Given that fact , the best OS possible without outside interference is OS X 10.3 Panther .	St
1.6.3	Panther 's default install requires 2.1 GB of free space .	St
1.6.4	A full install needs about 3.2 GB , and my best guess is that you ca n't make enough free space to satisfy this requirement no matter what you do .	St
1.6.5	As others have suggested , you could move your current MacOS installation to a larger drive .	St
1.6.6	An easy way out , for sure , but it could cost you time and money .	St
1.6.7	You could also try disabling the default ''Archive and Install '' option when setting up Panther as an upgrade .	Sug
1.6.8	Your system folders and core applications should be updated ; and your user settings should be left intact .	Sug
1.6.9	The best solution , however , may be this : Back up your Users folder and any downloaded applications that you may have , and then format and install Panther .	St
1.6.10	You can then copy the data you retrieved back to your hard disk .	St
1.6.11	Good luck , redmage0326	Polite
