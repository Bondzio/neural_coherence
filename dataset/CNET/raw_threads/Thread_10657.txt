There are two problems. 1 About once a day the computer freezes for about 5 minutes and then goes back to normal. 2. There are no hiberate and standby options available on my computer. Can anybody help me with these problems?

There should be three options available, standby, shut down and restart. Press Shift and the standby option will be replaced by hibernate.

How do configure my computer, so I can get these options? I heard something about having to download a chipset driver, but I couldn't find one. Also, I heard that I have to change the power usage BIOS settings, but that didn't help either.

I am sorry, but I guess I should have mentioned that my computer knowledge is about medium. What I am saying is that there are no hibernate and standby options IN the power options control panel. I am trying to figure out how to add these options to the computer, not how to navigate a computer.
