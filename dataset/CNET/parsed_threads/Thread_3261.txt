<s> Dell Dimension 8200, 512 MB RAM; 80 Gig HD; Intel Pentium 4, 2000 Mhz; Phoenix BIOS; 1702 LCD FP; Brother MFC-420cn; XP SP2; all patches and updates in place; AVG Pro Antivirus; CCleaner; Spybot -- and I must have forgotten something. </s>
<s> The system is just over four years old. </s>
<s> Here comes the hard part: Until today, I thought of removable storage devices as &quot;D Drive,&quot; &quot;E Drive,&quot; and the seldom used &quot;A Drive.&quot; All I knew is that they always worked. </s>
<s> Then I bought a Philips PH62022 Laser lens cleaner. </s>
<s> Please note: In all the time we've had this system, I've been careful to keep the hard drive clean -- as long as I could do that from the keyboard, if you know what I mean. </s>
<s> Physically, though, I haven't done well at all. </s>
<s> Anyway, I decided to buy the lens cleaner; it worked in both the D and E drives; but what it seemed prepared to do was much different from what the package directions indicated. </s>
<s> Now, I'm stranded on the back forty of my frontal lobe. </s>
<s> According to the package, the disk cleaner would start spinning automatically. </s>
<s> If it didn't, then the user was to start it. </s>
<s> It would spin for a few seconds and stop automatically. </s>
<s> If it didn't stop, the user was to stop it. </s>
<s> OK. </s>
<s> When I put the cleaner into D Drive (_NEC NR-7900A, according to &quot;Device Manager&quot;), WMP popped up; the cleaner started talking to me, ie: telling me it was one of the most advanced lens cleaners in existence, etc. </s>
<s> It also told me to click on &quot;Track 4&quot; at the sound of the tone, and that would begin the &quot;cleaning routine.&quot; Shortly thereafter, a tone sounded; I clicked on what I assumed was Track 4, because it was labelled &quot;Click Here on Tone.&quot; Everything seemed to be going just dandy, but I'm totally confused: Near the bottom of the WMP window, there was a progress bar in motion; and, under &quot;Click Here on Tone&quot; were three more clicking possibilities. </s>
<s> Actually, from the way things were going, I rather expected the progress bar to reach the end; then, either the cleaner would automatically go to the next option, or the friendly voice would tell me to click on the next option. </s>
<s> Problem: Given the progress of the progress bar, it was going to take at least 20 minutes for the first part of the routine to finish -- and the package directions had said &quot;several seconds.&quot; Then, if the disk didn't stop automatically, the user was to stop it. </s>
<s> So, I stopped it after maybe 4 minutes in the D Drive, and after only a few seconds in the E Drive. </s>
<s> (The latter is SAMSUNG DVD-ROM SD-616T, according to the Device Manager.) </s>
<s> Everything is still working just fine, but the lens cleaner disk seemed prepared to do a bunch of stuff not even mentioned on the package. </s>
<s> So I'm stumped. </s>
<s> Can't anybody give me a clue? </s>
<s> Thanks so much. </s>
<s> I use it when I suspect that issue but never let it run very long. </s>
<s> It's saved our Xbox and a few other drives from an early replacement. </s>
<s> I will write I don't use it unless there is an issue. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thank you, Bob. </s>
<s> I'm going to do the same thing. </s>
