my 40gb maxtor hard disk crashed.
it cant be detected when booting up, giving a message saying that primary.. bla.. bla failed.
i even have tried setting it as secondary using another hard drive as primary, the status still failed.
when i enter the bios, i can see that it recognises my 40gb hard disk.
there's a lot of data in the crashed hard drive.
how can i salvage the data in it.
is there any utility of software that i can try and use.
