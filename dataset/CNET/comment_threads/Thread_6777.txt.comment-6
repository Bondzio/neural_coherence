Hello applyguy My newly bought external hard drive 250 GB was not accessable via MY Computer anymore.
When I powered on the external hard driver, I hear some noise, however I can not hear the disk is spinning.
I'm very interested in about the Disk Warrior which fixed your problem, can you share this info with me in detailed ?
How did it fix your problem ?
Would you mind to send me email : jun_liu88@hotmail.com
