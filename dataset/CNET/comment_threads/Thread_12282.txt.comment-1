I built this computer about 8 months ago and very rarely it would just shut off (1 time a month).
Well over the last month it has become very frequent, randomly occuring more often to the point now it will only run for about 1 min and shut off and it happens while it is just sitting idle.
I do not get an error message upon restart and it just starts back up when I push the power button.
I replaced the PSU and that did not fix or even help the problem.
I have monitored the CPU and mobo temps, they seem to be running between 35 and 45 deg C. I am in the process of tearing it apart and verifying all connections again.
Im kind of at a loss as to where to go next short of replacing each component until the problem goes away...
If anyone has any suggestions I would appreciate it.
