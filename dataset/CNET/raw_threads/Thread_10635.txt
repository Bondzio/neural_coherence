637	6	119275	1354258	1353850	Ray Harinec	8/11/05 6:44 AM	1.12374264E12	need check sis chipset	intel chipset artificially creates fsb however might use memory pc intel clocks memory rated speed quad clock function creates additional clocks however next clock data available slower memory wait state way maximum memory bandwidth satisfy dual channel memory pc find sis fsb supports cpu slow memory
