i've had a computer connected to my stereo for over 8 years now.
it replaced an open-reel tape recorder and my original intent was to make cds from my vinyl and tape.
at the time i had dial-up internet.
everything is on a network now with high speed internet and i now also use it for internet radio and audio services like rhapsody although it's still primarily a recorder.
