I haven't used the drive yet, but when I turned it on, the drive sounded as though it was spinning like mad, even though there was no cd or dvd in it.
(Please forgive the crazy lack of capitals.
for some reason the shift on the righthand side of my G3 Powerbook isn't working.)
Attaching the cables inside the enclosure was really hard, because, as I wrote in the first message of this thread, the enclosure's very deep for the drive, so it took some delicate reaching in with my fingertips in order to align the plugs.
still, it's done now, and I have every reason to suppose that all systems are &quot;go.&quot; Nice of you to remember my mother in your good wishes, although you've never met her.
she had had a hard week.
