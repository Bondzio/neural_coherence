congratulations on deciding to build your first computer.
it is a very rewarding and educational process that can also save considerable money - a little with the first build and even more later when you upgrade reusing many of the basic components.
i would not recommend that package for gaming: 1. has a lot more cpu power than you need for gaming - and note that it includes no graphics card.
2. you are paying a premium for mobo that matches cpu - you can save on both to allocate more to gp 3. the power supply is not one of the models most people recommend and is not rated as highly as others for the same money at the sites that rank them 4. you can get a better heatsink/fan for less money.
to get a start on picking components, you might consider these links: 1. for general information and guides on building:  2. a specific list of recommended components at different price levels from list in #1:  note that at about one-third way down page you will see two recommended builds for about $1,000 including graphics card, that would be better than your choice above (note that neither these builds or the one you selected above include operating syste, monitor, mouse of keyboard so you need to ensure you leave money in budget for these if you need to purchase them) 3. tom's hardware guide (one of the most respected computer sites on the internet) has a recommended build model that includes the components list and a lot of discussion about the selections  4. great information about selecting and installing graphics cards with lots of links to other resources:  note that you can build a respectible gaming rig for about $600 to $800, depending on preferences.
for $1,000 you should get a powerful enthusiast rig.
