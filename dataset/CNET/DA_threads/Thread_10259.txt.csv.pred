1.2.2	The motherboard drivers are not installed .	St
1.2.3	Even with seasoned Windows 98se owners I still find the owners to not be aware of the motherboard driver packages .	St
1.2.4	2 .	St

1.2.11	Bob	St
1.3.1	Bob , Thanks for responding .	St
1.3.2	My computer does n't have the front USB ports - only the back ones of which I have only two .	St
1.3.3	They have worked for using a mouse for example .	St
1.3.4	I am not the most computer savvy person , so please excuse that fact .	St
1.3.5	If you could recommend a couple of drivers as per your comment , then I can try each one until hopefully it works .	Sug
1.3.6	Thank you very much .	Polite
1.4.1	Since there is no make or model given and such drivers are for specific make and models you own .	St
1.4.2	While it 's great that you use the rear ports , the mouse or such working is not at issue and is no indication the USB drives should work .	St
1.4.3	There are other possibilities but I like to start with what I see cure such most of the time .	St
1.4.4	Can I ask why the make and model of the machine is unknown after so many years ?	Ques
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	Bob , I am not at home right now , so I ca n't give you complete specifics .	St
1.5.2	It is a Compaq and I bought it used a few years back .	St
1.5.3	Having said that , my complete hard drive was tranfered from the computer that I had long before this Compaq that we are talking about now .	St
1.5.4	Beyond that , I ca n't tell you anything until I get home and see the information you require .	St
1.5.5	As it is Windows 98SE , I just assumed that there was a standard Windows 98SE driver or update that needed to be downloaded .	St
1.5.6	Tell me exactly what you need to know and I will provide that when I get home from work .	St
1.5.7	Thank you very much .	Polite
1.6.1	The make and model is usually enough .	St
1.6.2	From there I use google to find the motherboard chipset and then hunt down the motherboard driver pack .	St
1.6.3	Microsoft does not supply such things .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	is USB1 vs. USB2 .	St
1.7.2	Maybe these new flash drives will only work on USB2 .	St
1.7.3	A machine & quot ; a few years old & quot ; probably has USB1 .	St
1.7.4	To check this go into Device Manager and look at the Universal Serial Bus Controllers .	St
1.7.5	USB2 will have an entry of & quot ; Enhanced & quot ; listed .	St
1.7.6	If & quot ; Enhanced & quot ; is not listed you have USB1 .	St
1.7.7	To fix this is easy , purchase a USB2 PCI card .	St
1.7.8	Done .	St
