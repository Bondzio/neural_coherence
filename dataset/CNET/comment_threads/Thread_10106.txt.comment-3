Hi, thanks i pressed on the area and there was sort of change.
it opened up on it's own last night and worked perfectly, some flashing of screen, but worked.
Can the solder joints be repaired?
Read that you can re-heat this area to re-solder/ place bit of lino in case to pressure the spot............. Or do you just end up with a pile of un-fixable ibooks?
Is the earlier Clamshell less faulty?
Cheers Cas
