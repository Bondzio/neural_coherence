I will try to put the link in here for the 82021 update.
http://members.driverguide.com/index.php?action=dosearch&qm0=stealth+III+S540+Extreme+for+windows+98&qa5=4&qa6=305&dp=2&sm=b&jmd=and&pg=3&from_ums=1 It is on page 3 when searching for stealth III extreme drivers at driverguide.com.
And (because I had a problem today) you don't have to register - you can get in there temporarily with a name of &quot; temp &quot; and a password of &quot; 512 &quot;.
Please let me know if I can send you all more infomation to find this, now.
