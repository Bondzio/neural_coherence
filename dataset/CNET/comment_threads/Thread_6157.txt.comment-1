Hello, I'm looking to know what the upgrade capabilities are on a Dell Dimension 3000.
It's like a 5 year old computer and I just upgraded to Windows 7 but here are my questions: -Largest Hard Drive (Hard Drive Size Not that Important, more Important is RPMs) -How Much RAM Can I put in this (I want 6 Gigs or More) -What Kind of Dedicated Graphics Card -Upgrade Processor Let me know.
My I'm a web developer &amp; my website is Current Century Media if I can't upgrade this system much I'll just continue to use it for Microsoft Office/Notepad Editors/XAMMP I also plan on buying a Lenovo IdeaPad U410 from the Windows Store... is this a good buy or not.
I want to start working with Illustrator &amp; In-Design.
Thanks, Ted Cacciola Current Century Media
