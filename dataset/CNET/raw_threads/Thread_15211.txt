Proffitt	10/15/05 8:35 AM	1.1293653E12	No support?	http://www.3cbsi.com/products/en_US/detail.jsp?tab=prodspec&sku=3CRWDR100A-72&pathtype=purchase notes that it does have &quot;event logging.&quot; I see a manual is included so you'll have to dive in and see how and if the events you want logged, logged. -&gt; About syslog. google.com has much information about such. But in one line, syslog is much like a program that accepts syslog messages and records them for you to look at later. This is not an offer to solve your issues or write what you need to know in this small space. However I will note the information where it is and how to find it.

If you have a linux box, then it's just part of the package. Please tell more. -&gt; http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=windows+syslog finds syslog for windows. Cheers, Bob
