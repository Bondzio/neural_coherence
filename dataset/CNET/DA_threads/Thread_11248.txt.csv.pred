1.2.1	While some recent games like & quot ; Plants vs. Zombies & quot ; do n't tax such a machine anything richer will not be happy .	St
1.2.2	All the corners have been cut on CPU , GPU , RAM so let 's just say that 's not a gamer machine .	St
1.2.3	Upgrading could cost as much as a Xbox 360 .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I would n't try to play anything created within the last five , six , seven years on that .	St
1.3.2	You will be able to play web games just fine , but you wo n't really be able to play any offline games that one would care about at this point in time ( except maybe StarCraft or Warcraft III ) .	St
1.3.3	As said , buying an Xbox 360 would probably be easier and cheaper .	St
1.3.4	What games were you planning to play on this ?	Ques
1.4.1	um ya i think maybe doom could play on that ... : P lol jk but seriously if you want to play any recent games atleast upgrade your ram , get up to like 2.5 gigs or something , your graphics card could prolly play most games , just defenentally not top notch , maybe like lowest settings , and your cpu is pretty slow , maybe if it was atleast like 2.3ghz or 2.4 you would be alright but 1.8 is prolly just too slow .	Sug
1.5.1	Sorry but no .	Res
1.5.2	I had a 7600 GT that played Call of Duty 4 on low settings .	St
1.5.3	So a 7300 would n't probably be even able to play it .	St
1.5.4	As has already been said , it would be cheaper to buy a xbox 360 if your wanting to play all the new games .	St
1.5.5	You could get away with upgrading the RAM and buying a cheaper graphics card , all for maybe around $ 180 .	Sug
1.5.6	But you still wo n't play the newest games all that well .	St
