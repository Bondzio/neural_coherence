<s> Hello, I have a new computer and now I want to take my old computers hard drive and make it a &quot;Networked&quot; hard drive. </s>
<s> I have seen external hard drive enclosures out there but I am not sure what to look for. </s>
<s> Basically I want to be able to take my 3.5&quot; Maxtor 100gb drive and make it an external drive that any of my 6 computers on my network can access for backup and storage of music etc. </s>
<s> Can someone help me with what I should look for? </s>
<s> What do you suggest? </s>
<s> Get an external encolsure, connect it to one PC, and set it as shared. </s>
<s> Or get a Linksys WRT-350N router. </s>
<s> It has a USB port for what you want. </s>
