1.1.1	No one in India ( MS Tech ?	Ques
1.1.2	) can figure this problem out .	St
1.1.3	I have a Gateway desktop that was originally Win ME upgraded to WinXPSP2 .	St
1.1.4	I had been using a syslink USB11 wireless USB adapter on it sucessfully for over a year .	St
1.1.5	It was unplugged along with all other peripherals to move it to a new location .	St
1.1.6	When it was hooked back up again there was no wireless network icon in the tray .	St
1.1.7	It does not show in network places and the adapter was not shown in device mgr .	St
1.1.8	I tried to reinstall it , but it would not reinstall .	St
1.1.9	I tried this several times then finally uninstalled XP and went back to ME where the adapter had originally been installed .	St
1.1.10	It was still showing there so I Uninstalled it and then reinstalled XP .	St
1.1.11	I was then able to reinstall the adapter , but it said it was not properly installed and Device mgr shows & quot ; This device can not start & quot ; Code ten .	St
1.1.12	I have tried updating the driver , but what it has is the latest one .	St
1.1.13	I looked for hidden devices under device mgr .	St
1.1.14	to see if the first installation was lurking there but there was nothing .	St
1.1.15	Syslink thought It might be something in the registry that had not been uninstalled and sent me a cleaner for that , but it did not help .	St
1.1.16	The adapter is OK as I have tried it on another machine .	St
1.1.17	Syslink thinks it is a microsoft problem and I agree , but I have not been able to make the techs there understand .	St
1.1.18	All they want to talk about is the router .	St
1.1.19	.	St
1.1.20	I have read and read on the internet , but can not find anything similar to this except for one article in the knowledge base ( KB894480 ) that deals with a diffrent type of device.I would appreciate any help I can get on this , it is about to drive me nuts	St
1.2.1	... a different USB port .	St
1.2.2	Uninstall all instances of the adaptor at Device Manager under Safe Mode .	St
1.2.3	Try a new firmware .	St
1.2.4	Uninstall the USB controllers and let Windows reinstall them .	St
1.2.5	USB controllers drivers may have to be reinstalled ( or updated ) from the Mother Board CD , or from the USB controllers ' manufacturers or from the computer manufacturer 's recovery disc , if Windows has been reinstalled , as in your case .	St
1.3.1	Thanks , I 'll give that a try .	St
1.3.2	I had seen that information someplace , about uninstalling all the USB stuff .	St
1.3.3	but had not tried it yet .	St
