I was wondering what the possible culprits could be. The computer is about two years old and barely gets any use from her. She wants to already buy a new one, but I am hoping it just needs a battery or a new power supply. Thanks for the help

Did you try a different outlet/powerstrip? The power supply may be bad but before replacing it, open the case and check all the physical connections including the small pair of wires running from the button to the motherboard.

Cool , so that means you get this one, that may be broke?. cool. the button could be broke , but they are easy to fix.. if you know anything about computers,,pop the case and have a look, its the only way to find out. make sure you have a flashlight So you can see all the connections. you can fix it.

Power cord is fully plugged into power strip? Power cord is fully plugged into back of computer? PSU switch (rear of computer) is in 'ON' position?

Any markings? Any sticker with a Service Tag or Model Number?
