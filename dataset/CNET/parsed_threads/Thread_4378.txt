<s> I need a small (&lt;10&quot; screen) netbook that can handle u-tube & occasional streaming video. </s>
<s> I have a 3G internet account that requires a USB port so tablets are out and laptops are too big. </s>
<s> I've looked at several posts recommending ion equipped netbooks but they all seem to be from 2011. </s>
<s> Is this still the best thing for video? </s>
<s> I'm not concerned about video quality but I would like to watch it without a lot of starting and stopping. </s>
<s> Do you have any other recommendations? </s>
<s> Thanks for any advice you can give . </s>
<s> But today, you see the Android tablets to do great and the USB Internet can be done on a few as well but let's stick with the smaller laptops because internet dongle support is a gamble. </s>
<s> I have one of those newer dual core atom laptops and it's much better. </s>
<s> Try one of those. </s>
