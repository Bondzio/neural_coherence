1.1.1	Ok , so I had a 2.4ghz cordless phone in my kitchen and then I went wireless and installed a DI-614+ router in my living room .	St
1.1.2	The problem that I 'm having is simple .	St
1.1.3	When using the cordless phone , I notice a pulsing sound in the background , which I 'm sure is the routers signal .	St
1.1.4	That I can deal with .	St
1.1.5	The real concern here is that sometimes when the phone rings , I 'll go to answer it and it wo n't pick up .	St
1.1.6	Is a 2.4ghz router supposed to work alongside a 2.4ghz phone ( except for the pulsating noise ) ?	Ques
1.1.7	Should I consider paying more for a 5.8ghz phone or can I just get another 2.4 phone that is n't a piece of junk ?	Ques
1.2.1	Not only your 2.4ghz phone but your microwave oven and any other toys operating in that range will cause interference .	St
1.2.2	Try relocating the router for one .	St
1.2.3	If there is no improvement I would consider changing to a 802.11a/g ( 5ghz/2.4ghz range ) router or change the frequency of the phone .	St
1.3.1	I decided to go out and buy a new 5.8ghz phone .	St
1.3.2	My router is rock solid and I have no problems with my internet connection	St
1.4.1	Dont even think about buying a new phone , your router most have a multi-channel selection on the 2.4Ghz Wavelength , try alternating between spectrum channels until you find the perfect one , example : My Cordless phone use 2.4GHz and my Wi-Fi Broadband router is set it up on 2.47 GHz	St
1.5.1	How exactly do you do that ?	Ques
1.5.2	Change the frequency of the router ?	Ques
1.6.1	Enter your router 's Configuration Menu ( Administration page ) .	St
1.6.2	Go to the Wireless settings section .	St
1.6.3	Change the broadcast Channel ( frequency ) to another one in the list .	St
