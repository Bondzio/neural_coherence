hey matt, to first disable the onboard video in your bios, go to setup and look for one of a couple things: either &quot;onboard graphics&quot; with an enable/disable option, or &quot;set default vga&quot; with pcie or onboard as the option.
if you don't see those, reply back with the options you do see in your bios, and maybe we can figure it out; screenshots will work too.
on the game freeze/install issue, i have a few quick questions about your hdd and your ram.
when is the last time you defragged your drive?
how much memory are you running?
if you are able to drop to 1 ram stick, try the install.
if it hangs, put the other one in and try it.
as for the hdd uninstall generals, delete any leftover files, defrag the drive, reinstall and test again.
let me know how all that works out.
