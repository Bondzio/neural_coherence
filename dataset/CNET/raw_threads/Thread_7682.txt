12872	0	29788	338984	NR	Walter E	7/19/04 8:48 AM	1.09022688E12	Dell by Logitech keyboard problem	When I select the sleep button on the keyboard the message says &quot;System Standby Failed&quot; The device driver for the 'Terminal Server Keyboard Driver' device is preventing the machine from entering standby. Please close all aplications and try again. If the problem persists, you may have to update this driver. I don't know where the driver is located and this problem just started a while ago. The key was working fine prior and I must have done something to cause this. Dell is no help nor could I find info on the Logitech site. I have the standby feature working in the power options and it stands by at theprogrammed time but I want to also be able to standby when the keyboard key is selected. Any help would be appreciated. Walt

My Windows 2000 install strangely just works fine when I tap the sleep key. Most of the time, the software on the CD is best not installed. If you must install such, get the latest from the logitech web site. Bob

I solved it by going to Control Panel, selecting Add/Remove Programs, and selecting Adobe Type Manager 4.0 to completely remove it. I rebooted and now it works fine.
