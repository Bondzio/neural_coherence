I jump in here because I see that no one has come to your rescue.
I am not really a &quot;techie&quot; and my mobo is an8 ultra, a very plain jane.
Mine had a strange boot problem, and a new power supply fixed it.I see that official support from ABIT is the same as nothing, but you might try (if you have access to a computer that will get online) GOOGLE ABIT KV8-MAX3 .
Much information there, I didn't read it all, but you might get some clue.
If you get it fixed, please post back and let us know what works
