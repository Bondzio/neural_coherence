<s> I'm building a PC for someone else and I want to make sure everything's compatible before ordering. </s>
<s> I've checked and it looks like they work, but I wanna make sure. </s>
<s> Here's the parts: Case: ENERMAX Blue Aluminum ATX Mid Tower Case With 400W PSU, Model &quot;10MCS-56881LBFS-D3&quot; -RETAIL Motherboard: Intel &quot;BOXD915PCYL&quot; 915P Chipset Motherboard For Intel LGA 775 CPU -RETAIL Processor: Intel LGA 775 Pentium 4 520 2.8 GHz, 800MHz FSB, 1MB L2 Cache, Hyper Threading Technology - Retail Memory: Crucial 240-pin DIMM 512 DDR2 from crucial.com Video Card: AATI Radeon X700 PRO Video Card, 256MB DDR, 128-Bit, DVI/TV-Out, PCI-Express, Model &quot;100-437402&quot; -RETAIL Floppy Drive: NEC 1.44MB Black Internal Floppy Drive, OEM CD-ROM Drive: Samsung Black 52X32X52 CD-RW Drive, Model SW-252SENB, OEM Bulk Hard Drive: Western Digital 120GB 7200RPM SATA Hard Drive, Model WD1200JD, OEM Drive Only </s>
<s> not be compatible. </s>
<s> I don't like buying cases with the Power Supply because the supply is usually a low bid item. </s>
<s> I know that Enermax makes power supplies, BUT they make cheapies and good ones. </s>
<s> The good ones have the &quot;true Power&quot; in their name, meaning that they actually provide the full rating 100% of the time. </s>
<s> For the cheapies the ratings are for the peak wattage. </s>
<s> BUMP. </s>
<s> Any other advice? </s>
<s> Goto the mtrbd. </s>
<s> support website. </s>
<s> In some cases they provide a listing of known good tested compoents that work with thier mtrbd.. Usually, that implies at least ram, but other componets may need clarification. </s>
<s> Besides the website provides the known specs on what it supports. </s>
<s> Most off-shelf componets are going to work if compatible(usually are) and rarely do you see an issue. </s>
<s> The only time you get into trouble if you OC or speed tweak too far, but defaults work well. </s>
<s> Power supplies are the foundation of a good and *stable* system so if flaky problems arise, look into that area if not in the beginning but later within 3-4 mo. </s>
<s> isn't uncommon to see reboots or an further added componet tip the stable scale. </s>
<s> Of course don't forget good cooling of the system case and componets, this too can add stress that overtime will degrade componets or just generally start flakiness. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
