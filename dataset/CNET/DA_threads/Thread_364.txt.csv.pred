1.2.1	Try a post in one forum , wait a bit before cross-posting .	St

1.3.1	Since you can start printing , and then it stops , your subject seems incorrect , the printer IS detected or it would not start printing , does it actually get something on the paper , your description is quite unclear about this .	St
1.3.2	It is most likely to be a hardware problem with the printer or the cable , not the computer in this case ... .though a bad parallel port could do this , it is extremely rare , a bad printer is the most likely culprit .	St
1.3.3	A loose parallel connector should be screwed down tightly , but if that were really the problem it should not even start printing .	Sug
1.4.1	Excuse me Proffitt and thanks JMarchi , I was really desperate .	Polite
1.4.2	I hope you understand .	St
1.4.3	I would be careful in future .	St
1.4.4	After posting my message and I immediately reinstalled win 98 after reformatting C : \ and the printer was visible to os under plug and play after that [ before I tried uninstalling the printer but os would nt see it . ]	St
1.4.5	But once again when I start printing , printing starts but after printing half a inch of 'test page ' it stops .	St
1.4.6	Message I get is unable to comm- unicate with printer port lpt1 .	St
1.4.7	I now try other options as suggested by you and report back if something positive comes out .	St
1.4.8	I have one more apprehension that it might have something to do with ink refill in my black ink cartridges .	St
1.4.9	Color is empty .	St
1.4.10	I should nt ve gone for refills Thanks for your help .	St
1.4.11	Aron .	St
1.5.1	Here 's what I 've always done regardless of the problem on HPs and others .	St
1.5.2	You need to clean the ink carts & quot ; contacts & quot ; as well as the carriage contact nibs with a damp clean cloth and then dry wipe .	St
1.5.3	Re-install them and then check results .	St
1.5.4	Sometimes the & quot ; timing fence & quot ; the thin plastic strip that runs untouched through carraige , it has black tick marks all along its length .	St
1.5.5	Use the clean damp cloth to wipe down , left to right , repeat as necessary and use gentle/deft care while doing this , just clean it up abit , ( use no solvent ! ! ! )	St
1.5.6	just water or alcohol .	St
1.5.7	Try that and check results .	St
1.5.8	If it still fails , then use a *NEW* ink cart usually resolves 30-40 % of problems doing that alone .	St
1.5.9	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
