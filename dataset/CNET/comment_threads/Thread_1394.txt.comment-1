I'm on a budget here of about $800 and I need a computer that can run World of Warcraft at top settings with ease (Which isn't a whole lot of power).
I know I need a Core 2 Duo Processor, a 500:1 contrast ratio monitor, and 2-3 gigs of RAM.
I need to know about graphics cards and such.
Also, if you know any nice computer accessories (Mouse, Keyboard, etc.)
that improve gaming experience let me know ;D. Thank you for your posts.
