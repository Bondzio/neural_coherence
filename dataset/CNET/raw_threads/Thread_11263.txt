When I requested DVDs of my photos- the DVDs came back with a nice label with the name of the shop, date created etc. It seems to be &quot;painted on&quot; and from some shops, it seems to be printed on paper and then glued on.... How are these labels created ? What program(s) are used ? and devices ? Thanks. christy.

But as label making program goes, there are many out there and there are three other method of labeling; lightscript (labels are burned in), paper labels (print then stick), and &quot;painted on&quot; (label surface are painted on the cd/dvd).
