1.1.1	I use my Epson Stylus PHOTO 785EPX printer a lot and it seems that I have to do the Head Cleaning routine every two or three days , usually the black ink check pattern has gaps .	St
1.1.2	Ayway , I found the following site that has a lot of information about Epson head cleaning and a link to download a program , SSC Service Utility , that allows cleaning selected print heads instead of all of them : http : //www.maxpatchink.com/epson-tips.shtml I have n't tried the single head cleaning yet but the SSC Service Utility looks interesting and does all kinds of stuff with the printer .	St
1.1.3	By the way , I refill my cartridges and have excellent results although I am sure refilling is n't for everyone ... and do n't tell me the refill ink clogs the heads .	St
1.1.4	I do n't clean the heads any more than I had to with new Epson ink cartridges .	St
1.2.1	Interesting post , Fitz , As a printer engineer ( mostly ... ) my company insists that if the user is using refills/3rd party consumables we should walk away !	St
1.2.2	I had HP refills a few years ago for my deskjet 690c and they were terrible - ink bled , smudged , took a long time to dry , etc .	St
1.2.3	Recently I needed to print some stuff but was skint , so I went to a local Cartridge World-type place .	St
1.2.4	The result really impressed me , and I would recommend the shop .	St
1.2.5	However , where Laser Toner Cartridges are concerned , the story is not so good .	St
1.2.6	I have seen leaks of toner , poor quality due to the drum having marks on it , or repeated lines caused by problems within the cartridges .	St
1.2.7	They do n't seem to last very long , either , so maybe Toners are in a different league from ink cartridges : - )	St
1.3.1	One of the things the SSC Service Utility does is make my printer produce a horrible grinding noise when I used the utility to & quot ; Move head to exchange position & quot ; .	St
1.3.2	So pass on this utility .	St
