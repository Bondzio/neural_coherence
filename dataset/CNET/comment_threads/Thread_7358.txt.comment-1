I guess everyone knows about the Soyo's rebate game that being they don't honor them.
IMO another rebate game is being played by Corsair.
They require a rebate be submitted within seven days.
(I should have just ordered from Newegg or Zip-zoom-Fly it would have been cheaper in the long run.)
I hope Microcenter will reconsider with whom they play.
I encourage everyone to read the policy before thay leave the store.
