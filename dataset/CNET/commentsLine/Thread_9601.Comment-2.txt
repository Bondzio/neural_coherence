i just go to staples and hand them back in for their bucks.
as to fade proof.
isn't that fade &quot;resistant&quot;?
i'm seen claims of fade proof but after putting such in the arizona desert sun for 5 years it did fade.
also, the paper matters too.
but you can research more about low acid or acid free/neutralized papers.
