1.1.1	My son and I replaced an ASUS motherboard with a Foxconn 761GXK8M8 motherboard with a packaged Athlon 64 CPU .	St
1.1.2	The case is a RAID case with a Raidmax ATX 12V ( sn KY-520 ATX ) .	St
1.1.3	When the computer is powered up we get no fan starts , and no attempt to boot .	St
1.1.4	The power supply was working fine just before we changed the board .	St
1.1.5	The power supply has a 20 pin connector , not a 24 as recommended but the owners manual says that will work if plugged in as directed .	St
1.1.6	I have verified that is correct .	St
1.1.7	The 12 power supply is plugged in correctly as well .	St
1.1.8	I tried jumpering the power on button across the pins on the board as I had seen on other posts with similar problems .	St
1.1.9	No response .	St
1.1.10	The only sign of life was last night when I reset the power strip and the power supply and CPU fans spun up for a quick second and then coasted down .	St
1.1.11	This phenomena happened this AM as well when I plugged in the 20 pin connector .	St
1.1.12	Checking the 20 pin connector with a multimeter , starting from the left facing the clip I got 5VDC on the 2nd and 7th pairs of pins .	St
1.1.13	I get no voltage across the pins on the 4 pin 12VDC connector with the power plugged in and the toggle switch in - ( on ) .	St
1.1.14	Should I have voltage across that with the power supply on but the computer not booted up ?	Ques
1.1.15	Any other ideas on troubleshooting and repair ?	Ques
1.1.16	We have verified the reset switch , HDD LED , and power supply two pin connectors on the front of the board .	St
1.1.17	I appreciate it .	Polite
1.2.1	Newbies and HELP , you will find suggestions and recommendation that might help .	St
1.2.2	If you learn one thing from this post it 's always test the MB with CPU RAM and video BEFORE installing the MB in the case .	St
1.2.3	That said ... .NO BEEPS ?	Ques
1.2.4	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	Yes , there are NO beeps .	St
1.3.2	Additionally , when the power supply is turned on occasionally the neon light below the power supply ( it has those 'gaming ' cool internal case lights ) will light up and the fans will spin for up to 20 seconds , but with no intervention , the fans stop , the lights go out and that is it .	St
1.4.1	Two power connectors to connect to an ATX12V power supply .	St
1.4.2	One is the square plug .	St
1.4.3	Also maybe I did n't catch it but what size PSU are you using .	St
1.5.1	It is a RAIDMAX KY-520ATX 420W .	St
1.5.2	I just got done pulling it out of the case ( including unhooking the tempearure controller/monitor , hard drive , floppy , two CD 's etc ) and after plugging it in out of the case I get NO voltage on any of 12V plug ins ( I do get 5VDC on two of the twenty pin pairs , so I am assumimg the power supply is bad .	St
1.5.3	We put in the new motherboard and CPU due to frequent crashes until it went chronocally 'system failure due to CPU ' test .	St
1.5.4	Now it looks like the real root cause was that the power supply was failing .	St
1.5.5	To your point there is only one 4 pin ATX connector on the board .	St
1.5.6	There is another female four pin connector marked 'CPU ' peeking out from behind the motherboard mounting plate but it is integral to the box not the board and I do not believe it was hooked to anything when we had the old motherboard in place so I did not mess with it .	St
1.6.1	you can get a PSU tester from Xoxide.com ( ULTRA or Coolmax ) or just replace or RMA ( if still under warranty ) the PSU .	St
1.6.2	Might want to check the HW against the PSU requirements ... you did n't indicate 'what else was in the box ' .	St
1.6.3	Sorry it did n't come to life out of the case .. sometimes the slightest short ... like an extra standoff , can cause such problems and you 'll never find it when installed in the case and connected to some or all of the peripherals .	St
1.6.4	VAPCMD PS ... .Take a close look at the old MB and see what the capacitors look like ... my daughter 's A7V8X has a bad PSU replaced it and later discovered that a number of capacitors were going SOUTH .	St
1.6.5	Replaced the MB not too long thereafter .	St
1.7.1	I will test and replace the power supply and check the old ASUS motherboard .	St
1.7.2	I 'll let you know what I find .	St
1.7.3	Thanks for following up .	St
1.7.4	I appreciate it .	Polite
1.8.1	NIL	St
1.9.1	It was the power supply .	St
1.9.2	The original was 450W and probably insufficient for the computer .	St
1.9.3	It was dead on all of the 12v connectors .	St
1.9.4	Wally at CBC computer repairs ( very knowledgeable and helpful ) tested it for me on a Sunday afternoon .	St
1.9.5	I ran to Best Buy , upgraded to a 650W , plugged everything in , reloaded Windows and it works fine .	St
1.9.6	The old ASUS motherboard showed no visible signs of bad caps etc. , but since the new MB was an upgrade and was already in we did not go back and try the old MB with the new power supply and I do n't have the equipment to do a component level test .	St
1.9.7	Thanks again for your help .	St
1.10.1	NIL	St
