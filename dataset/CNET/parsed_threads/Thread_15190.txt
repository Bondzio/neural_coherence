<s> I'm going to be traveling around alot soon, so my grandparents bought me an old Toshiba - Model PS261U Notepad. </s>
<s> It has 64mb of RAM and I was wondering where you could go to get another stick of the 64mb, so it would be 128mb dual channel. </s>
<s> I haven't seen the laptop yet, my grandfather just sent me the specs over e-mail. </s>
<s> to say this. </s>
<s> I won't be using it for gaming or anything(Duh! </s>
<s> lol) just for MSN and Yahoo... </s>
<s> But I would like a little more of a performance boost. </s>
<s> It runs on Win98 too. </s>
