i currently have 3 usb 2.0 hard drives 2x fantom 500gb and a 200gb seagate in a vantec nexus enclosure.
the hard drives all work fine when plugged directly into the computer but i recently purchased a vantec ugt-mh401 usb hub and when all the drives are plugged in they are painfully slow.
for instance extracting a file with 7zip tops out at 400kb /s.
is this the case with every hub i could purchase or is it a problem with this particular hub.
it advertises that it has &quot;downstream ports have automatic connect and speed detection function plus over-current protection with auto-recovery&quot; which i am not sure if that would be a problem this is the product page  on newegg.
any help is appreciated.
thanks
