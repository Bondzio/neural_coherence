No!
The PowerBook video card, it's built onto the the logicboard, is not replaceable.
You have an ATI RAGE Mobility 128 video controller with AGP 2X, 14.1-inch TFT The VRAM is not expandable.
The good news is that the processor can be replaced, for a fee.
I'm not sure that I would bother with the expense given that I would still not be able to play the game.
I would be able to not play it faster though:-) You may be able to play an earlier version of SimCity.
The cheapest upgrade route that I could find for you to be able to play SimCity 4, is $499.00.
That will exceed the system requirements for this game.
