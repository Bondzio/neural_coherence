4005	0	29677	337512	NR	bill999	7/18/04 9:01 AM	1.09014126E12	Computer upgrade, bad MB	Compaq 5000 series, Pent III, 933MHz, blown motherboard. Local shop offers to install new MB, new 2.7MHz cpu, increased memory and new power supply for total of $300. Warrantied 1 year. Is this deal too good to be true? Told them I would consider and took my box home. Didn't even charge for diagnosis.

It's strictly a matter of cutting a big hole in the right place to mount a fan, then wire it up. It's not a big deal if you can get a nice case fan, do the planning and metal work and the minor electrical hookup. But the point is that the case was for something of about 1/4 the Watts we see from today's CPUs. Bob
