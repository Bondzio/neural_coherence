1.2.1	With a new CDRW spotted at Office Max for $9.99 or even $19.99 at Best Buy, I have to ask if this is a lot of money for a CDRW drive?	St
1.2.2	You can try a CD Lens Cleaner ($14.95 at your regular music store) and there are some issues if it the drive letter has vanished, but you didn't write that.	St
1.2.3	After a few years, if the drive letter is still there, you try a CD Lens Cleaner, but that costs more than that CDRW drive!	St
