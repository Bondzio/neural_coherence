shared video memory: using part of main memory (ram) for the display circuit's frame buffers, which temporarily hold the rendered content being sent to the screen.
shared memory is used in pcs that have the display circuit built into the motherboard rather than housed on a separate, more costly display adapter card.
sharing main memory with the display function reduces the amount of memory available to applications, and main memory is not as fast as the specialized video memory on stand-alone cards.
on lower end systems, the video is integrated into the motherboard.
the video controller uses a certain amount of 'shared ram' for video memory.
the shared ram is taken away from main system ram.
thus, on a 512 mb system, if the integrated controller uses '128 mb shared video ram', the main system only uses 384 mb of ram, and this is the number you'll see when checking for the memory.
when you go out to purchase a computer, some models specify that they have a certain amount of megabytes of memory, and they may have a video card that supports a certain amount of shared memory.
this means that when the video card is in use, especially in higher display modes, it will take some of the memory normally dedicated to other computing activities and use it as its own.
thus, if you buy a computer with 512 mb of memory and 128 mb of shared memory and you frequently use a high display settings, you may actually only have 384 mb.
all this is down to you, will you be using as a pc or for games.
