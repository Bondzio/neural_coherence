<s> I want to hide everything that can be used to find the location of my internet connection. </s>
<s> In order to do that, I'm planning to use Ultrasurf, Hotspot Shield, SMAC(or any program to change my mac address), and maybe putty. </s>
<s> The only problem is that I need to know how I can combine these programs. </s>
<s> I need to know if there is a program that can take a proxy address like Ultrasurf and let me select which program will run with it. </s>
<s> This would be very helpful because in that way I do not to change the configuration of Mozilla Firefox or IE every time I use them, and it also allow me to use Ultrasurf in programs that don't have an option to set up a proxy. </s>
<s> The program that most closely would fulfill my needs is GTunnel ( http://www.internetfreedom.org/GTunnel ), but for some reason did not work on Windows Vista and it did not shows all my programs. </s>
<s> Do you know any program like this? </s>
<s> Any suggestion on how to hide my location? </s>
<s> Please, DO NOT tell me this question is illegal because it's not. </s>
<s> I do not plan to do anything wrong with this. </s>
<s> The reason is simple. </s>
<s> If you were hidden, internet traffic would not make it to your machine. </s>
<s> This is just like hiding your mail box and asking for the mail to be delivered to your secret location. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> First I assume you are going to pay for a service? </s>
<s> The only way to do this is to make all your traffic appear to come from another machine. </s>
<s> That other machine someone has to pay for. </s>
<s> There are some free services out there but you will have to search. </s>
<s> The simplest and the one that will bypass just about any firewall or proxy is SSL VPN. </s>
<s> Because this uses the same protcol as HTTPS sesions it is unlikely to be blocked. </s>
<s> This is how the kids play world of warcraft at schools. </s>
<s> The SSL VPN client itself generally does not need to be &quot;installed&quot; so it will run on even the most secure machines since most are java based. </s>
<s> The next is a IPSEC VPN. </s>
<s> Many small routers support this so you could use a friends house if they allow it. </s>
<s> This is how we watch TV in other countries that have IP restrictions. </s>
<s> Any type of VPN is the best because it creates another interface on your machine. </s>
<s> The application do not have to be reconfigured since they cannot tell if the port is a wireless/ethernet/VPN...etc Most the other solutions are a pain. </s>
<s> You have to configure proxy which of course does not work for apps that want to use ports other than the standard ones. </s>
<s> You can use SSH to build a sorta vpn tunnel but it is a pain but the way we used to do it years ago. </s>
<s> Be somewhat careful of what software you run. </s>
<s> Many things can get lots of information. </s>
<s> Google Chrome has been blasted by many for the tracking info it sends/keeps. </s>
<s> It will at times even send the user id you are logged into. </s>
