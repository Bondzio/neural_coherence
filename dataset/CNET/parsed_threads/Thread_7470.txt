<s> I have a Dell Dimension 4100 with a 20GB ATA/100 hard drive. </s>
<s> I can get a good deal on a 160GB ultra dma/100 HD. </s>
<s> Will I have any problems adding the 160GB drive to my existing syatem? </s>
<s> I know very little about this area (no kidding right! </s>
<s> ). </s>
<s> I'll write you will have some fun in this one. </s>
<s> Only recent OSes support over 137GB and only then with the help of either an updated BIOS or a PCI card that you hope comes with the hard disk. </s>
<s> The drive will come with instructions on how to install it for the OS in questions. </s>

<s> I upgraded the OS to XP, but have doen nothing withthe bios or PCI card. </s>
<s> I will check with the &quot;friendly&quot; sales people and see if it comes with the card. </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply, and I have no idea why this posted 3 times, I only hit submit once! </s>

<s> 1. </s>
<s> SP1 is needed to support over 137GB drives. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> If you have such a drive and reinstall XP and XP doesn't have SP1 built-in, then the over 137GB drive contents VANISH. </s>
<s> Fix for item number 2 is to get or make an XP CD with SP1 integrated. </s>
<s> If this is a DELL, then ask for an updated OS CD so you don't lose it all. </s>
