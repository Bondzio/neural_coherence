Repeated improper hard shutdowns can cause problems, what they are is left the condition of the system.
Thus, you're at risk every time its done.
Refrain from such practices will allow for continued operation of the system.
However, there are times when no other method seems to be left and you have to pull cord or hit/hold power button.
Correct the problem and be happy.
