Towards the end of the download, I heard a &quot;whirring&quot; or &quot;whistling&quot; sound, which sort of faded in, got a little loud, and then faded out. It did it about 3 different times, but hasn't done it since. Is this an indication that something is wrong with my hard drive? Or could it have been the cooling fan? My first hard drive that crashed would give me a clicking sound, but this was a high-pitched whirr or whistle. Any ideas?

Fans typically are the source of much noise or new source of noise as they fail. Observe the fans(any fan)for inbtermit operation. A good cleaning helps as always if not done in awhile. For the most part, HD omit a constant noise or lack of one(very quiet), so don't jump too quickly on a failing HD, but if apparent *backup* as a safety precaution ASAP, regardless. tada -----Willy
