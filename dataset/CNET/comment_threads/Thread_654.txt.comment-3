My computer Is a 4 year old HP.
Any other information you require you will have to ask me for me to be specifiec.
My computer has a 200 W power supply right now.
but the new power supply Is to big and will nto fit into my computer and some of the cables don't match the old ones in my computer.
The cable to the video card matches with the new power supply though.
This is my New( Want it to be sperate from rest of computer if possible) power supply.
