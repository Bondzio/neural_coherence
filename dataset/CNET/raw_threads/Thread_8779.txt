I have a Dell Inspiron e1505 and the wireless card came installed. When I try to manually connect to the profile, I receive the error &quot;Problem applying profile&quot;. To my knowledge, nothing has changed with the set up on either end. It connects fine to my neighbor's system. Intel said they cannot help since it came installed on my laptop. Any thoughts on what to check to troubleshoot this?

If you've not cycled it off and back on, that's the first thing to do. You must have been able to set it up via its web interface. Can you access that? Sounds like the laptop is fine though.
