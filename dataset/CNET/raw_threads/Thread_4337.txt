So far I've had a processor reccommended to me - the Intel Pentium D 945 - would you agree that's pretty &quot;high end&quot;, or am I setting my standards too low? Also, I've pretty much extended my current (old!) motherboard as far as it can go - so I need a new one to use that processor. I have 3 questions about that ... 1. Do most motherboards come with RAM, or will I need to order some? 2. Will it be possible to plug my existing RAM sticks in (2x 512MB DDR PC2700 sticks) into a new motherboard, or do I need to stick it on eBay and start fresh? 3. How much RAM do you reccommend to get the best out of that processor? Will 1GB be enough? Also, if anybody can reccommend a decent and cheap motherboard I'd really appreciate it. Apologies for the long post, but I don't know who else to ask! Many thanks.

Too old for today's CPU's. You need to start anew. Try to get a ''Core 2 Duo'' CPU. New: motherboard CPU DDR2 memory PSU Likely needed new: case hard disk DVD burner sound card 1. no, most don't come with RAM 2. no, a desirable new motherboard will take DDR2 memory. 3. 1GB is a good place to start with Vista Motherboard and other hardware recommendations come when you tell us how you want to use your comouter.

6692	3	209027	2229680	2229599	mikeleeuk	9/27/06 7:52 AM	1.15934352E12	More info...	I have an MSI mobo at the moment - Last time I got my computer upgraded I ended up with an AMD processor. Thanks for the advice regarding which RAM I should be looking for, that will be helpful. The reason I chose a Pentium D is because I'm on a fairly tight budget, and I've heard that not many programs use the full power of a ''Core 2 Duo'' processor yet. I'm planning to get a new case anyway, so that's not a problem - but why would I need a new DVD burner, hard disk and sound card? I think mine should be fine with most new motherboards, but I may be wrong. Finally - the PC is used for all sorts of things, so it's hard to say. Sometimes it's a home desktop, sometimes I use it for designing, sometimes it's used for playing some pretty hardware-intensive games (Such as The Sims 2). Thanks for your response.
6692	4	209027	2229820	2229680	linkit	9/27/06 9:04 AM	1.15934784E12	what is your budget?	Gaming is usually the most hardware intensive activity for the general use computer, and today it requires a decent CPU, at least 1GB RAM, and a mid-level to high-end video card. Of course, all this depends on your budget. I was just guessing about the DVD burner, sound card, hard disk, and other components because of the type of RAM you stated (older RAM type means older components). If you have good components, then by all means add them to your new machine. If you tell us what you want to keep (kbd, mouse, monitor speakers, HD, DVD burner, sound card, etc.) and then give us a budget for the rest of your machine, then we can suggest some builds.
6692	5	209027	2229882	2229820	mikeleeuk	9/27/06 9:37 AM	1.15934982E12	My Budget	All I wanted was a CPU, a case and a motherboard, but it's becoming clear that's not realistic - so let's make that a CPU, motherboard, a decent amount of RAM, a case and (only if I NEED one) a more recent GPU. Here's some of the stuff I've got at the moment - bear with me, though, because I didn't install it and don't know much about it. - Two HDs - A fairly recent DVD burner - A Creative Soundblaster Audigy 2 ZS sound card - An nVIDIA 6800 LE GPU (AGP, not PCI) - Obvious stuff such as mouse and keyboard (not USB) Ideally, my budget is only 300 ... that's not a lot, I know. I hope my PSU and fan (both fairly new) can be put in a new case, otherwise I might as well not bother with this upgrade! My Dad's paying, but I suppose he could be swayed slightly as I'm giving him my old RAM and Processor to speed up his machine - we both had the same but I decided I needed more speed about a year ago. Call it a part exchange, I suppose! Again, 'scuse the long post. Many thanks.
6692	6	209027	2230087	2229882	mtrodrig84	9/27/06 11:29 AM	1.15935654E12	I just did this	Alright, here's what I just got last week: - ASUS P5B Socket T (LGA 775) Intel P965 Express ATX Intel Motherboard - SAPPHIRE 100106L Radeon X850XT 256MB GDDR3 PCI Express x16 Video Card - Intel Core 2 Duo E6400 Conroe 2.13GHz LGA 775 Processor Model BX80557E6400 - Patriot 2GB (2 x 1GB) 240-Pin DDR2 SDRAM DDR2 667 (PC2 5300) Dual Channel Kit Desktop Memory Model PDC22G5300LLK And I spent $691.89 on all this from Newegg.com. I suspect these prices will drop as the Core 2 Duo's become more popular, and AMD comes out with their new Quad-Core processors around Christmas time. If you go to anandtech.com, they will show you the trends of hardware prices and have very good reviews on hardware (it's where I did all my research for my Mobo). Newegg is typically the best place to get them, but there are other great deals out there. Also, tomshardware.com is a good place to compare CPU speed using benchmarks that are most useful to you (For example, AMD X2 +4400 processors are faster than the e6400 at some things like gaming, but not multitasking and dvd burning, which is what i wanted). My new setup runs like a dream, and on a scale of 1-10, my computer would now probably be about a 7. I used my existing Case, CD drives, Floppy, and Power Supply. I ended up needing to get a new power supply for $70, because mine was 400w and the minimum requirements for my new hardware was 400w, so I upgraded to 600w because the power was acting funky. I suspect if you wanted to go lower in RAM (2GB is the most you'll ever need, so 1GB would probably suffice), and also go for the Core 2 6300 which is almost just as good as the 6400 but for 50 bucks cheaper, and they also make decent PCI-e graphics cards for only $70, this would all save you about $150 from what I paid, not to mention the drop in prices that should occur in 3 months. I would suggest keeping your old case, HDD, and dvd burner, as they will be compatible even if you have IDE drives. You can upgrade to SATA later, as they perform much better. So I spent about $750 getting all this stuff, which is 397GBP, but I did manage to sell my old mobo, processor, RAM, and extra PCI cards on eBay for $300, so it came to around $450 for my upgrade.

6692	8	209027	2230549	2230500	mikeleeuk	9/27/06 4:02 PM	1.15937292E12	Will this work?	I've worked out a way to stretch my budget a lot, and I've found a load of stuff that I think should work together. How does this sound, and will it all work? Intel Core 2 Duo E6300: http://www.aria.co.uk/ProductInfoComm.asp?ID=23931 1GB RAM: http://www.crucial.com/uk/store/partspecs.asp?imodule=CT12864AA53E nVIDIA GeForce 7950 GT: http://www.aria.co.uk/ProductInfoComm.asp?ID=24557 Foxconn motherboard: http://www.aria.co.uk/ProductInfoComm.asp?ID=24021 Antec NSK 3300 case: http://www.xcase.co.uk/acatalog/Antec_NSK_3300.html Note that I picked 1GB RAM so that I can always add more later if I need it - but with that processor I'm sure I won't! (Does anybody know if I'll end up with all the cables I need? Will I be able to use ones from my existing system? Obviously that's important!) Thanks for your speedy replies.
6692	9	209027	2230884	2230500	linkit	9/27/06 8:00 PM	1.1593872E12	Think &quot;PCI Express X16&quot;	Video card slots: Best &gt; PCI Express X16 &gt; AGP8X &gt; PCI &gt; worst New boards should have PCI Express X16 and not AGP4X/8X.

6692	11	209027	2231317	2230888	mikeleeuk	9/28/06 4:16 AM	1.15941696E12	The search continues...	&quot;Motherboard is incompatible with your CPU and video card.&quot; Good reply, but can I ask why? What do I need to be looking for that's different from the one I chose? I picked one from the &quot;Socket 775 (Intel)&quot; section on the Aria site, to match my processor, and presumed that was enough.
6692	12	209027	2231420	2230884	ahtoi	9/28/06 5:45 AM	1.1594223E12	The board should also have intel 965 chipset.	Some other chipset will also work but 965 should be a sure thing.
6692	13	209027	2231615	2231420	mikeleeuk	9/28/06 7:40 AM	1.1594292E12	Benefits?	What's the benefit of having the same chipset - will it cause problems if I don't, or is it just a case of the processor being ''guaranteed'' to fit? The reason I ask is that having a 965 chipset board adds almost 60 to the price (on Aria, at least). http://www.aria.co.uk/ProductInfoComm.asp?ID=24272 ^ That's the one I've got my eye on at the moment, it's got PCIe x16, DDR2 RAM and it mentions the Core 2 Duo. It's also got 4 USB ports, which is something I was hoping for - my current 2 means a lot of mucking about. Will that one be alright? It's an Intel 945G chipset one - presuming the numbers go in order, that's pretty close? Right?
6692	14	209027	2231645	2231317	linkit	9/28/06 7:48 AM	1.15942968E12	make sure the CPU is listed	Just because a motherboard has a particular CPU socket, it doesn't necessarily mean that all CPU's of that socket type will work. The motherboard BIOS also needs to support the particlular CPU type. The link you posted states that the motherboard is compatible with &quot;Intel Pentium D, Pentium 4, Celeron D processors, Socket T (LGA775).&quot; Hmmm...I seen no &quot;Core 2 Duo&quot; in that list. Now, you may go to the motherboard maker's website to discover if there is a BIOS update for compatibility with C2D processors; however, there may never be such an update for that particular board. Bottom line: Make sure the motherboard specifically states that it is compatible with your CPU family. Note that some motherboards are compatible with C2D, but not C2D Extreme CPU's.
6692	15	209027	2232014	2231615	mtrodrig84	9/28/06 10:58 AM	1.15944108E12	The Asrock will do	That's the one I almost got, but it had problems I didn't like. Look at the layout, the PCI-e card is way close to the large Power supply cable you'll be running, and that heatsink may also get in the way. For some reason, manufacturers are being complete retards with their motherboard layout, so make sure you take that into consideration. Otherwise, that board will work and it's a good bang for your buck. Listen to that Linksis guy and me, we know what we're talking about. Ignore that other guy, he has no idea what he's talking about. All Socket 775 boards require PCI-e, AGP sucks. But yea, also be careful because not all Socket 775 boards support Core 2 Duo Processors
6692	16	209027	2232317	2229548	mikeleeuk	9/28/06 1:17 PM	1.15944942E12	Nearly there...	Thanks very much for your help so far... I think I've almost got it! If you could confirm this will all work, that'd be excellent... Intel Core 2 Duo E6300: http://www.aria.co.uk/ProductInfoComm.asp?ID=23931 1GB RAM: http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=290019936431 nVIDIA GeForce 7950 GT: http://www.aria.co.uk/ProductInfoComm.asp?ID=24557 Asrock motherboard: http://www.aria.co.uk/ProductInfoComm.asp?ID=24272 I'm also thinking of this case, just because it's the cheapest: http://www.aria.co.uk/ProductInfoComm.asp?ID=23750 Will that be alright, and can you reccomend a PSU from aria.co.uk? The nVIDIA FAQs say I need at least 400W, but that doesn't help much - I never know exactly what I'm after.
6692	17	209027	2232347	2232317	mtrodrig84	9/28/06 1:34 PM	1.15945044E12	Power Supply	Get one that's 600w. Also, I hope you do realize you're getting Micro-ATX stuff. It will all work with each other, I'm just pointing that out so that you know you may need a micro-ATX power supply also. That's one hell of a video card you got here, too. And if you're only getting 1GB of RAM, it might be cheaper to get 2 DIMMs (2x512MB Dual Channel).
6692	18	209027	2232327	2232347	mikeleeuk	9/28/06 1:45 PM	1.1594511E12	Micro ATX	I do realise I'm getting microATX stuff... the motherboard being cheaper is the main reason. Also, I often cart my PC accross the country when I'm visiting my Dad - so I expect that might make it slightly easier. Why would I need 600w, Isn't that a bit OTT? Obviously you know more than me - I'm just making sure I don't waste money if it's more than I need. Re: the graphics card, that could end up being different depending on my budget. The idea of this upgrade is to not need another one anytime soon, but I think I might end up going for an older model in the GeForce 7 series. It all depends on how much I have to spend on the case and the PSU - do I need a microATX one for the case I just posted?

One 7950GT model I saw on NewEgg.com states that it needs 28A on the +12V rail. This is in addition to the high maximum Wattage rating. It is better to have more Wattage than to skimp.
