1.1.1	I current have a printer simular to the HP Photosmart C4480.	St
1.1.2	I am running into an issue and the reason behind me not using it, whenever I try and print I am constantly being told that I do not have any paper in the tray.	St
1.1.3	I can load it with 100 sheets of paper and this happens.	St
1.1.4	I am looking for an all in one similar to the Dell printers where the paper is loaded from the top in.	St
1.1.5	I am not sure how good Dell's printers are, I know their PC's are good.	Res
1.1.6	Any suggestions?	St
1.2.1	If the printer is over 2 years old then try the usual cleaning, read the product manuals for what they say about this (I don't duplicate that here) and then if the printer is 2 or more years old, start shopping.	St
1.2.2	All consumer printers last about 2 to some years.	St
1.2.3	Many can't accept that.	Sug

1.3.1	Thats all fine and dandy....Do you have a preference as to what brand is better over teh others?	St
1.4.1	I've used them all over the years but don't bother with Lexmark jet printers that you find in stores.	St
1.4.2	I do prefer laser printers and &quot;Office&quot; printers from HP but consumers generally don't want to go past 99 bucks so those may not be on the list.	St
