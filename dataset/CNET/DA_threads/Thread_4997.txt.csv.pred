1.1.1	My neighbor has wireless internet .	St
1.1.2	I discovered this when I brought a laptop home from work and it picked it up right away .	St
1.1.3	I can get onto the internet with no problem at all .	St
1.1.4	Now , of course I had to return the laptop but I have a Dell desktop at home .	St
1.1.5	It is not currently equipped to receive wireless .	St
1.1.6	First off , is it morally/legally wrong to use his wireless connection ?	Ques
1.1.7	And further , what would I need to receive the wireless connection on my desktop ?	Ques
1.1.8	The desktop is a brand new Dell with McAfee firewall and virus protection , which I use for my super slow dial up connection .	St
1.1.9	I certainly do not have the resources to pay $ 50 a month for a wireless connection myself so if this does n't work out , I 'm keeping my dial-up .	St
1.2.1	It 's sad the neighbor left their system unsecured .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	The legal issues have n't been fully sorted out yet , but when they are settled I 'm sure it will be illegal .	St
1.3.2	In the meantime , it is morally wrong .	St
1.3.3	It is theft .	St
1.3.4	We do n't provide assistance in these forums for that .	St
1.3.5	dw	St
1.4.1	a man has been arrested for this , but as the case has not yet come to trial , the resolution is unknown .	St
1.4.2	In the Sacramento Valley , CA , the DA is starting to wage war on wireless theft of service , and has declared illegal those antenna enhancements used to extend the range for receiving WiFi signals -- but I have not heard of any arrests there yet .	St
1.4.3	As Dick said , it is still up in the air , and is being handled locally if at all .	St
1.4.4	I am sure the broadband suppliers will be pressuring Congress to make this a crime .	St
1.4.5	Another aspect : my broadband ( cable ) contract allows me to up to five systems on my premises .	St
1.4.6	If I knowingly let a neighbor use it , I would be in violation and could lose my connection -- if the cable company found out about it .	St
1.4.7	If I did not know , then the cable company could presumably file theft of service charges , as they do now against those who tap into a cable line , and probably win as they do now .	St
1.4.8	And , as Dick said , it is morally wrong .	St
1.4.9	Frank	St
