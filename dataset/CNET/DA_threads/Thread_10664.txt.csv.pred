1.1.1	I know a little about computers but almost nothing about networking , so I apologize in advance if this is a foolish question .	St
1.1.2	My wife has a laptop with built-in wireless capability .	St
1.1.3	Right now it is wired ( ethernet cable ) to a cable modem for internet access .	St
1.1.4	She 'd like to be able to use it anywhere in the house , without being restricted to using it where the cable modem is ; nothing fancy , just basic internet access .	St
1.1.5	All the wireless routers seem to require that one PC/laptop be wired to the router , and then other computers can connect wirelessly , but we only have the one laptop at home .	St
1.1.6	Is it possible to set up a system with just one computer connecting wirelessly ?	Ques
1.1.7	Bonus points : can it also be set up so she can print from anywhere in the house ?	Ques
1.1.8	Any advice , suggestions , specific equipment recommendations , etc. , would be greatly appreciated .	St
1.1.9	Ease of installation/use is obviously important .	St
1.1.10	Thanks for your help .	Polite
1.2.1	Some settings and especially firmware updates require you have a wired connection .	St
1.2.2	Once its setup , you do n't need the wired connection .	St
1.2.3	As to printing .	St
1.2.4	Some routers have printer support , some do n't .	Sug
1.2.5	And with one laptop , why not put the printer where it 's used most ?	Ques

1.3.1	Even if the router does not support a printer , there are print servers available at prices from about $ 40 up .	St
1.3.2	Just get one whose printer connection is compatible ( USB or parallel ) .	St
1.3.3	As Bob said , it would be convenient to have the printer located where it would the laptop is used most .	St
1.3.4	This may or may not be where the router is located ( if you have cable internet service the router and modem will be located near a cable outlet , but you may want the printer somewhere else ) .	St
1.3.5	If the printer is to be near the router , use a wired print server ; if the printer is remote , use a wireless print server .	St
1.3.6	With respect to the requisite wired connection ; first connect yoour laptop to the router by wire .	St
1.3.7	Download the latest firmware for the router , and go through the setup procedure .	St
1.3.8	Then you should be able to unwire the laptop and use it anywhere in the house .	St
1.3.9	Whenever you wish to change settings or download newer firmware or drivers , simply connect again by wire .	St
