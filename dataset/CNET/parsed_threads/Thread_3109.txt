<s> Hi, My PC worked ok until yesterday. </s>
<s> I pressed the 'sleep' button on my wireless kbd and the pc switched down. </s>
<s> The TFT monitor went into 'power saving' mode, no display and just an amber LED. </s>
<s> Problem is, when i switch the pc back on i get no display, not even a post screen and it switches straight into power saving mode. </s>
<s> I connected the TFT to my laptop and it works fine, great picture etc. </s>
<s> This narrowed the prob to my base unit or peripherals in my mind. </s>
<s> I have a wireless Keyboard and Mouse and am running Win XP Home. </s>
<s> Have tried pushing buttons on the keyboard and even booting pc without keyboard connected but same thing! </s>
<s> Any help would be 'MASSIVELY' appreciated. </s>
<s> Regards, Duncan </s>

<s> The whole system was shut down, all cables removed, re-attached and then powered up again...same fault? </s>

<s> I have to use another machine to test the display. </s>

<s> just put a new mother broad in. </s>
<s> when starting up everything works fine but the monitor just keeps going to stand by.no matter wot i try it wont work </s>
<s> to my friend's issue. </s>
<s> Secure tightly all connections, that includes the graphic card, connector pins, etc. </s>
<s> The last time it happened was a loose cable not secured tightly. </s>
<s> The next possible is the power scheme you've setup for the system. </s>
<s> Have you done similar procedure before without any problem? </s>
<s> Check your bios for the power settings as well. </s>
<s> Disable sleep mode to, wake-on-lan, etc. </s>
<s> Run as normally power-up/power-down instead of putting it to sleep, and work from there. </s>
<s> Two questions: 1. </s>
<s> Monitor connected to the motherboard or a separate videocard? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> It goes to stand-by. </s>
<s> When? </s>
<s> Do you see the BIOS POST, Windows starting, the Windows welcome screen, the desktop? </s>
