yes i've been given &quot;dead&quot; drives only to discover they are nothing but &quot;corrupt.&quot; the drive was actually good.
rare but happens.
if the drive doesn't spin then we at least look at the solder work near the power pins.
some owners were changing or removing the drive &quot;for security&quot; and the solder work gives out.
