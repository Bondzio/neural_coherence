agreed.
i've since disabled enet an am using the built-in utility, and put my network at the top, which it has consistenly connected to after a couple of test reboots.
i'm wondering if enet grabbed from this list to decide connection order, but my network was always above the other, and enet still connected to the other network.
odd, odd indeed.
