Proffitt	6/26/12 10:32 AM	1.34070672E12	Clarification request: Did you look at the maker's web page?	http://www.corsair.com/en/pc-cases/obsidian-series-pc-case.html Right there I see one has a silencing feature. Your post seems to omit what you know and what is important to you. Frankly (again) why would you want a 200 buck case? You didn't tell. Bob

Heat reduction is my main objective in buying a case because the room the computer is going to be in is going to rise to 31 degrees celsius. The manufacturers page is not clear at all, it looks as though you can put more fans in the 400r than the 550d or 650d, If someone could please just list the differences that would be great and that is all I am asking for.

It sounds to me that you'll get some case and then leave the side cover off like most folk when they can't be in a cool room. Bob
