the problem is that new pc's do contain too much &quot;junk&quot; programs from manufacturer's, which clearly indicates they are gaining advertising advantage from software vendors -- even for the &quot;free&quot; 60 day software offers!
my new hp desktop pavilion a1477c, amd 64 x2 4400, had more than 100 pieces of &quot;trash&quot; that i cleaned off in different ways.
i used &quot;msconfig,&quot; which drove me nuts re-starting and re-warning against starting msconfig in this way (with programs un'checked).
i used control panel &quot;install/remove&quot; software.
and ended up with whacked-out registry problems, and invalid startup programs i couldn't even find installed on the computer.
i installed registry mechanic, which helped.
i installed system mechanic pro 7, which helped, but came to the &quot;remove unused, unneeded uninstallers,&quot; which when i did, caused even more havoc because some of the uninstallers were actually needed.
at best, it is a major deal to have to play with this unwanted software.
this needs to be changed by computer manufacturers.
at the very least, no software non-essential to basic computer tasks (such as the op/sys) should be directly installed, but should offer the user the option to install such programs.
if i buy a home computer for my home office, i do not want 100 games and two game consoles on my computer.
at the very least, i should be given the option to &quot;install&quot; or &quot;not install.&quot; i usually buy 4-8 new computers per year, and end up giving them to family or friends.....but am seriously thinking of switching to building my own because of this problem.
then, i lost my price advantage because mass produced computers sell for less than i can the price of me building one.
either way (crap installed or not installed and built by me) i lose!!!
thanks, computer manufacturers.
