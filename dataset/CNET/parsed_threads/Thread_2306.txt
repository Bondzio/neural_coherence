<s> I recently changed the settings of my ethernet adapter. </s>
<s> I don't remember what I have done and I don't know the default values. </s>
<s> I went to the Device Manager and changed the advanced settings of Marvell Yukon 88E8056 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Adapter. </s>
<s> Please tell me the default values so that I can change it back I am using Windows Vista Service pack 2 Your help will be appreciated Chris christarzan@gmail.com </s>
<s> System Restore should be able to do that. </s>
<s> No,, system restore was disabled at that time. </s>
<s> Can you atleast tell me if Marvell Yukon 88E8056 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Adapter belongs to Yukon II product line Thanks Chris </s>
<s> (in Device Manager) and reinstall not set it to default again? </s>

<s> but found this driver http://www.vista-driver.org/query/1070/marvell_yukon_88e8056_pci-e_gigabit_ethernet_controller I can't tell if it's in the mentioned family. </s>
<s> Only Yukon can do that. </s>
<s> I have to wonder if you don't have an older pre-Vista system and have run into hardware compatibility issues. </s>
<s> Is that possible? </s>
<s> I found out a way.... </s>
<s> I googled it and got it Thanks Chris </s>
