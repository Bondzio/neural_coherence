as outlined in the thread above i have hung the old hard drive in an enclosure on a usb port and can see the folders just fine, but when i try to open the folders i need (my documents, application data) it gives me a permissions error.
how do i get past it?
i have the username and password the files were created under, but don't know where to enter them.
