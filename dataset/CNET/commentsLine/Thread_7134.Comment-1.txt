i have a dell 2350 running a celeron processor at 1.8 ghz.
ive upgraded memory, power supply and video and graphics card and now for fun id like to try a new better processor.
pentium if possible or a faster celeron.
as expected dell told me no way but im wondering if any one has had any luck with this.thanks in advance for any response.
