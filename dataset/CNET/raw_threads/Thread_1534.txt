Now this NIC seems to be dead (no light at the back, can't connect to Network, can't access internet). So I uninstalled it from Device Manager and bought this D-Link DFE-530TX PCI Fast Ethernet Adapter (rev.C). Everything is fine except for this: Each time I start Windows 2000 Pro, it tells me that it has found new hardware and to insert the cd that came with it. I would like this not to appear each time I start Windows. How would I do that? PC particulars: MoBo = ASUSTek P4S533 REV 1.xx Bus Clock = 100 Mhz BIOS = Award Software, Inc. Revision: 1009 09/09/2002 OS = Win 2000 Pro RAM = 768 MB Processor = Pentium 4 2.0 Ghz If you need more info pls ask.

If disabling it in the BIOS doesn't end this problem that works just as well, you don't need it disabled in the BIOS to use another network card.
