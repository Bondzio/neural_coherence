Just a quick checklist: Did you visit a &quot;bad&quot; site?
Maybe virus?
What other hardware are you running?
If you know: Is anything overclocked?
Probably not, just checking.
Is there anyway to check if the first HDD works in another comp?
If you don't: Visit your local comp shop: If they are nice enough, they'll test your HDD in another PC for free.
Power supply dying?
Is it under warranty?
Try calling HP for help.
