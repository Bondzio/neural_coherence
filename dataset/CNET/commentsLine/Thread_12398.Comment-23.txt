i actually wondered if this was the case on the sample print that i got.
i had sent paper and a file to a reputable printer dealer to get custom samples back.
given the generally good reviews i have seen on ricohs, i was quite surprised at what came back as a sample.
i can't say what options were selected on the printer, but all i sent was card stock, so who knows what they did.... what's the heaviest stock you have tried thru the ricoh and how did it come out?
