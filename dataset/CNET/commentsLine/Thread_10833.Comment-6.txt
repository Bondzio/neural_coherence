&quot;if i connect a switched hub to my befsr41 wired router, why will the pc to pc traffic move faster?&quot; because the switched hub in the befsr41 doesn't keep up with 100mb transfers.
even the cheapest switches hubs helped curb the time when i copy a file between machines.
since routers were pricey back then i would connect up the modem -&gt; router -&gt; switched hub -&gt; pcs to get the best overall network speed.
