For a number of reasons, rational and emotional, I've settled on the iMac G5. I was wondering about the various configurations and this question seems at least a little relevant. If you (the collective you) had the choice between a 20&quot; display with 1GB of memory or a 17&quot; display with 1.5GB, which side of the equation would you come down on? (I think I've officially entered the nit-picky phase of selection). Thanks, Jay

They make sense and seem obvious in retrospect (one of those ''why didn't I think of that'' moments). The original question arose because a colleague at the university where I work said Macs are ''memory intensive''. So after looking at the 17'' iMac on display at the campus store, I was ready to order one with 1.5 or 2 gigs of memory. Then I made the mistake of visiting a real Apple store and seeing one with a 20'' monitor and I realized I probably can't afford a big monitor plus 2 gigs of ram. This put me in a tizzy and resulted in my wondering whether I should invest in big memory or big display. Do Macs need a large amount of memory? Is one gig enough for a MacIntosh that will be used for standard web duties, some video and photo editing, and the preparation of lectures with Powerpoint? I'm sorry if I seem obsessive. Its just that this is my first foray into Macs and I would like to get it at least semi-right. I also apologize if this submission appears twice. I sent it from my office but it hadn't appeared as of this evening so I tried again. Thanks once more, Jay

I've read that some don't like Apple's mouse and use aftermarket products. I'm still not sure about the difference between Bluetooth and wireless but is a Bluetooth enabled keyboard and mouse worthwhile technology? I'll probably install Virex if only to keep from transmitting viruses with email. Do I need to use an antispyware program periodically? I presently spend the first 15 minutes of my day clearing spyware that Counterspy detects on my PC. Thanks again. Jay

Bluetooth is a short range wireless signal, usually for input devices like the keyboard, mouse, headsets, joysticks and some printers. It's pretty neat. By ordering it built into your system, you will not have to take up a USB port should you decide to go with it in the future. The Apple Mouse has only one button, as source of much discussion in the Mac world, but OS X has built in support for a two button mouse, including a third party bluetooth one. I know of no Anti-Spyware programs for the Mac, I'm sure there are some out there, but Spyware and Malware are not currently a problem on the Mac. The majority of the stuff is aimed at Windows boxes.

I read on the Apple site that with matched memory sticks &quot;it will operate with a 128-bit data path&quot; instead of the 64 one DIMM would support. Sounds good to me. I look forward to learning the system and putting all that power to use. Thanks again, Jay

While it is almost certainly slower and less slick than any G5 based machine, performance feels better than the PC in the other room with a roughly similar spec (512Mb, 1.3Mhz CPU). Then again, I've sussed that most of my wife and I's PC usage is very light, hence going for a Mac Mini rather than something with a top end graphics card. I am not heavily using Photoshop (and when I do, I am not usually working at photo quality), and I haven't started heavily using iMovie, Garageband or iDVD. The first time I hit the constraints of the machine was using Garageband, but I was testing how much I could do before it gave up (and that was CPU rather than memory). SimCity didn't seem to enjoy running at the highest resolution - I've not done any investigation there, my hunch is that it graphics card as 32Mb is the bare minimum suggested. If you do a lot of Photoshop work or A/V editing, then the more RAM the better.
