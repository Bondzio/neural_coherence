Anyway, when ever I put in a black DVD-R+ into my DVD drive/burner, it switches to a CD drive. I have tried enabling recording and switching the registry drive numbers from 1 to 2 as said on MS's website. I also tried uninstalling it and restarting letting Windows configure it itself. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I am running windows XP Media 2005, latest updates from Windows Update service.

If you're in a hurry ... you can easily find what you're looking for (or attractively-priced commercial SW) through your favorite search engine. I use/recommend Roxio Easy CD Creator and you can get good deals on it if you're willing to look ... but free it's not. Good Luck VAPCMD
