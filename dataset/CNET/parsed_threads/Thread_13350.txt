<s> I posted before about my specs and said I was interested in updating my gaming computer. </s>
<s> I am currently running a Pentium 4 3.0C and I was wondering if the new Pentium 4 3.4 GHz Extreme Edition (with HT) are good for gaming. </s>
<s> I researched online a bit and I got alot of no's and some people said yes. </s>
<s> However they do not have 64-bit support. </s>
<s> I was wondering if it would be best for me to get the P4 3.8 GHz (w/ HT) because that has 64-bit support. </s>
<s> I am not really sure on what kind of difference that would make... </s>
<s> However, I do not plan to upgrade again for several years and I guess some programs will be in 64-bit by then? </s>
<s> Also, If I plan to get the 3.8 GHz HT with the Windows XP Pro x64 Edition how much of a difference with performance will I see than just the regular Professional. </s>
<s> Also keep in mind that I am using my computer to play highend video games and do some light picture editting and the rest just being typing and surfing the web. </s>
<s> I plan to use the CPU with the specs found here - http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7591-0.html?forumID=26&threadID=108554&messageID=1236478 </s>
<s> Here are links to the products I speak of...

<s> ookay in order to upgrade the processor to 64bit ur mobo needs to support 64-bit which i highly doubt it does. </s>
<s> so probably need new mobo and processor. </s>
<s> if u buy from oem, upgrading can cause trouble. </s>
<s> also when upgrading 64-bit windows, some software may not support it. </s>
<s> 64-bit is not really new. </s>
<s> apple has been usin it for a while. </s>
<s> my suggestion, do not upgrade unless u really have a need for 64-bit. </s>
<s> i am sure future software will be able to support 32-bit and 64-bit computers as majority of today's computers are still 32-bit. </s>
<s> dont worry about it. </s>
<s> when mainstream applications become 64-bit, maybe in 2-3 years, then consider upgrading. </s>
<s> currently all 3 of my computers are still 32 bit. </s>
<s> my newest computer is only 4 months old. </s>
<s> anyways, in the future if u desperately need 64-bit, u can always pick up one from emachines or gateway for a low price. </s>
<s> If you read my second post, there is a version of the 3.8 that is 64-bit. </s>
<s> But yes, my mobo doesnt support that. </s>
<s> Should I just stick with the 3.8 ghz for now? </s>
<s> I want to know what Intel CPU would be BEST for gaming, not what one not to get. </s>
<s> If I was to get the Intel Pentium 4 Extreme Edition 3.73 GHz processor which has Extended Memory 64 Technology would I beable to still run my computer with that? </s>
<s> Could I still run this on a mobo that doesnt have x64 support? </s>
<s> I would get the Pentium EE. </s>
<s> Intel 840 because it is a dual-core and has hyperthreading. </s>
<s> It is the best choice of all three. </s>
<s> For the price pretty reasonable compared to your other choices, as their all around $1000. </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> OK, I think I am going to go with the P4 Extreme 3.73ghz because it is the fastest one that I could run. </s>
<s> The only problem is that it uses EM64T and my Mobo does support that but I do not have any programs that use x64. </s>
<s> I want that speed and stuff but is it possible to turn off the x64 in bios or something? </s>
<s> I still just want to use Windows Pro and not that special version. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> What are you talking about... </s>
<s> The mobo I listed - http://www.newegg.com/product/product.asp?item=N82E16813131534#DetailSpecs must support x64 because on new egg it shows one of the combos being a CPU that is x64 and if it doesnt support x64 then there is a way to disable it. </s>
<s> PLEASE stop being so vague it is VERY annoying. </s>
<s> I can not listen to what your trying to say with only a subject title. </s>
<s> &quot;The only problem is that it uses EM64T and my Mobo does support that but I do not have any programs that use x64.&quot; -&gt;???? </s>
<s> You created a paradox MORON! </s>
<s> Not possible to turn off em64t. </s>
<s> iF motherboard doesn't support, then the processor will be unusable. </s>
<s> My suggestion get the bios update for the motherboard if possible from the manufacturer's website so you can ENABLE it and get the processor. </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> hmm r u confusing ur other posts? </s>
