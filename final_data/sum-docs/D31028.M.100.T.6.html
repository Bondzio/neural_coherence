For 11 days last month, Hurricane Georges plowed across the Caribbean, killing at least 500 people and inflicting property damage estimated at more than $5 billion as it weaved through nearly a dozen countries before expiring as an early fall rainstorm over Georgia.
While mainland insurers are expected to spend six times what the federal government does for damage from Hurricane Georges in the Gulf Coast states, the government will spend just as much in Puerto Rico as the insurers do: about $1.7 billion each.
The cost of Hurricane Georges in Puerto Rico will not be shouldered by insurance companies.
