<s> I have a group of computers on one router (A) and another group on another router (B). </s>
<s> The two routers (A) and (B) are connected by a third router (C). </s>
<s> How do the computers on (A) communicate with those on (B) or (C). </s>
<s> Any help on the subject or a link that explains it would be great. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> They had: Internet -&gt; WAN port on router (to PCs) to WAN port on next router (to PCs) to another WAN port (to PCs.) </s>
<s> Fix? </s>
<s> We redesigned it using POST 17 of this forum. </s>
<s> Much better. </s>

<s> If these routers are your basic routers with 4 port switches built in then this is easy. </s>
<s> Just use two of them as switches instead of routers. </s>
<s> You could put all routers on the same subnet: For example: Router 1 (Internet Connection could be plugged into this one) 192.168.1.1 Router 2 192.168.1.2 Router 3 192.168.1.3 All the routers can then be connected with Cat5 CROSS-OVER cables. </s>
<s> When it is two LIKE devices such as this you will need cross-over cables. </s>
<s> Disable the firewall features on Routers 2 and 3 and you should be ok. </s>
<s> Being behind 3 firewalls may cause issues down the road for you. </s>
<s> All computers plugged into the 3 routers will have internet connection and be on the same network where they can share resources. </s>
<s> I'll look into it </s>
