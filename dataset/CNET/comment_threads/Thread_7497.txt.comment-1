I'm moving overseas in the middle of February, and I want to buy a 15&quot; basic Macbook Pro to be my primary computer while I'm there.
I was waiting for any updates at Macworld last week, but there was nothing!
Just all this fancy talk about the MB Air.
I have till the end of February... should I just go ahead and buy one?
I heard they might update the CPU chip and put a multitouch trackpad.
Will I be crying if I don't have those features?
