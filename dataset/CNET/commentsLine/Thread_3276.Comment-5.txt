netbooks have their place....they are not supposed to 'replace' an upscale laptop....i have one i use when travelling, they are easily carried at airports, can access wifi while waiting....also use in hotel room to check email, look up stuff on web, etc.
...a netbook is not supposed to be for long correspondence, lengthy emails, etc... the thing to look for in a netbook is to be sure it is upgradeable to 2 gb!
!, thats the first thing i did.
makes 100% difference in performance.
the other thing is the keyboard, there are differences in how far the keys are apart/spaced...which helps in input.
other wise, dell, h.p., acer, whatever, are all about the same... you could say its a difference between a loaded larger laptop, and a pda or an email/net capable cellphone....bottom line again is, what are you going to use it for ???
