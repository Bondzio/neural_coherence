Hi Thanks for the reply.
At the time of the crash I was using Nero Express that came with the first CDRW I had on the computer.
I was just updating it from time to time.
I was thinking the same thing about Nero.
So I uninstalled and bought the whole package, Nero Burn.
No changes, it still crashes... Boy-o-boy... Swan
