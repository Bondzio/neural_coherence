<s> From Dong Ngo's review (November 7, 2008): &quot;If you plan to have a wireless network in a neighborhood that doesn't already have too many wireless signals, we would recommend the Belkin N+ over any other wireless-N routers.&quot; http://reviews.cnet.com/routers/belkin-n-wireless-router/4505-3319_7-33361546.html?tag=mncol;lst But... How can you know how many wireless signals are in the neighborhood? </s>
<s> And how many are too many? </s>
<s> Janet </s>
<s> Never heard of that reasoning. </s>
<s> You can look for wireless networks with you PC's wireless adapter. </s>
<s> Turn it on and it should show you the wireless networks in range. </s>
<s> If you can find the reviewer's email address, ask him. </s>
<s> I don't think I have a wireless adapter. </s>
<s> Don't you get them when you buy the router? </s>
<s> Anyway, a friend said that he hides his wireless network. </s>
<s> If you search for networks around you, does it count the hidden ones? </s>
<s> Not what we write to do in our forum sticky. </s>
<s> We found it causes network drop outs but who are we to give out advice that could stop owners from calling in hired help? </s>
<s> That is, please try it our way. </s>
<s> There is NO added security by hiding the SSID. </s>
<s> It's in each packet that's sent out so newer software will show the hidden ones. </s>
<s> Only those that stuck with what Windows uses will call it more secure. </s>
<s> You can used wired now, wireless cards can be added later. </s>

<s> Is there a known issue with the Belkin N+ router and too many networks in the neighborhood. </s>
<s> I live in an apartment building and my laptop can easily pick up 10-15 wireless networks. </s>
<s> I recently installed a Belkin N+ router. </s>
<s> I am using an HP pavillion notebook running Windows Vista. </s>
<s> If the laptop is fairly close to the Belkin router, I get fairly quick webpage downloads. </s>
<s> If I move the laptop to a different room, maybe 30-40 feet away from the router, I have very slow connection and frequent network drops. </s>
<s> I have already tried changing channels. </s>
<s> I am beginning to wonder if I purchased the wrong router. </s>
<s> Any thoughts? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I was having the same problem with my Belkin N+ Router and Comcast service (RCA Thomson modem). </s>
<s> I had the Comcast guys come and check the internet signal, which was strong and uninterrupted. </s>
<s> I took the usual steps (power cycling the modem and router, changing wireless channels, resetting modem to factory defaults, etc.) </s>
<s> to no avail. </s>
<s> I have seen rumblings around the internet about problems with this router. </s>
<s> There is no new firmware upgrade to address these issues. </s>
<s> It's a shame because I was getting great speed and throughput on the router before these problems arose. </s>
<s> I ended up returning the router and getting a Linksys N router - that seemed to solve my problems. </s>
<s> We have this router in our house, connected to Comcast, with a good 6-10 wireless routers in surrounding houses. </s>
<s> For a little while the router worked alright, but it's digressed to the point where its un-usable on most of my laptops unless you're within 5 feet of the unit. </s>
<s> When i try to load a page from the next room (10-15 feet away) the signal slowly fades from 160+mbps, with strong signal strength, down to 11, then disconnects from the network completely, even with a full strength signal. </s>
<s> The page times out, after which i can re-connect to the network at full strength and repeat the whole frustrating ordeal again... sigh. </s>
<s> Interestingly, my netbook connects fine throughout the house. </s>
<s> Not sure how that works out... Im going to give this to one of my friends and get a Netgear or Linksys. </s>
<s> This unit has caused me endless hours of frustration. </s>
<s> I am also having this issue but it may not be totally the router's fault. </s>
<s> This problem occurs with my Dell Studio 15 laptop running Win7 Home Premium which I purchased early this year. </s>
<s> But I don't have this problem with my 4 year old Lenovo Thinkpad T61 laptop running WinXP SP3. </s>
<s> So that tells me that there is a compatibility issue between the internal wireless adapter in the Dell and the Belkin. </s>
<s> I did try to muck around with the advanced wireless card settings in the Dell but I had to be careful as I am not a networking expert and was afraid of making the problem worse. </s>
<s> I was hoping to find a posting somewhere that specified some settings that could be changed to fix this problem but my broader searches on this issue seems to point to a firmware problem. </s>
