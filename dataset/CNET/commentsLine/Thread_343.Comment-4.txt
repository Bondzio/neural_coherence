btw, my temp was not that high.
it was 36 idle and 47 loaded.
after i replaced my powersupply (it was burnt), i think i touched the heatsink during the process and no matter how i mounted and tighten the heatsink, it is not as good as it was b4.
im sure it has nothin to do with the psu because i replaced with the same one.
i think it's just my heatsink clamps are not as tight as it was b4
