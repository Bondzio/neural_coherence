seems a lot of you folks had the old commodore but my first comp was an atari 800 xl.
a fine piece of equipment with a monochrome 9 inch or so monitor, a cartridge port and an external 5.25 floppy.
after that came the atari 520 st with a whopping 520 kb of memory and a 3.5&quot; drive what a speed demon.
what fun to think about how far we've come.
one of my favorite quotes was something like &quot;if automotive technology advanced as fast as computer technology we'd all be driving a rolls royce that cost $2.99 and got 500 miles to the gallon&quot;
