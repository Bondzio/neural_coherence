My HP requires you to hit F1 during boot up for set up and F10 for system restore; the first screen I see shows all these options before the XP welcome screen pops up.. She might be able to recover using the F10 scenario.
It's a little too late now, but she should have made a recovery tools CD and a set of Recovery DVDs.
All the material for HP is found in a D: partition on the hard drive.
If you can't be with her, try to find someone to call HP for her.
HP should be able to walk them through a recovery.
Once the recovery is complete someone needs to make the disks for future use.
