1615	0	11440	130723	NR	Leon Thomas	2/10/04 8:13 PM	1.07644398E12	Invalid System Disk?	I have an old PC (Compaq Presario 4910) that I haven't used in years. Today, I realized I might have some old files on it that I might want to see again, so I hooked it back up. Unfortunately, after the standard COMPAQ screen and password check, I received this error: Invalid System Disk Replace the disk, and then press any key I remember that in the days leading up to the purchase of my current PC, I deleted a lot of excess files, but I didn't think I did anything to hurt my computer. Maybe I was wrong. What happened? What does &quot;Invalid System Disk&quot; mean? How can I fix it? Thanks in advance.

You need to SYS the drive to get it to boot again, if it is seen at boot time. Boot with a floppy disk that has the same version of DOS that is on the system (www.bootdisk.com for a copy) and then SYS the drive SYS A: C: to restore the boot information and get it to boot up.
