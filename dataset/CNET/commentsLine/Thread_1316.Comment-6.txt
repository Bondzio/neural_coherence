i currently have an amd x2-4400 with 4gb ram,xp pro, 1 tb of hdd's and a creative sound blasster x-fi with front audio box, crossfire video cards.
all connected to a jvc 5.1 surround sound system using fiber optic cable.
the tv is a 50&quot; panasonic connected to the pc with a dvi-i bus cable (no hdmi on the set).
i use it more for fraging and video's more than music (which also sounds great).
scare's the bejesus out of the dogs when turned up
