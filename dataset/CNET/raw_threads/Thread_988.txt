Slave: None	This happened before but somehow it actually fixed itself, (how? i dont know) but now its actually lasting longer than it previously has. OK, so i turn on my computer and everthing looks as though its going smoothly, then while it is 'Detecting IDE Drives' it takes a little longer than it usually does, then after that, this comes up: 'Primary Master: None Primary Slave: None Secondary Master: Toshiba DVD ROM SD-M1502 1008 Secondary Slave: _NEC NR-7700A' Then it pops up saying 'Verifying DMI Pool Data....Update Success Boot from ATAPI CD-ROM: Failure... Boot from ATAPI CD-ROM: Failure... Disk Boot Failure, Insert System Disc...' Recently I installed windows XP, though im pretty sure this has nothing to do with the problem, any info you need i dont mind on telling you. Any help would be appreciated.

I find this happens every now and then and really nothing seems to correct it. If it happens often enough maybe I could pin-point but usually not. I make sure the bios is the newest and installed, all cabling is proper or swap out with others. Reseat any movable chips, etc. and inspect for contacts on the rear of mtrbd. that the mounts aren't shorting, usually no matter what it seems to work at least for the time being. A reboot seems to correct the problem or at least a warm reboot does. If it happens usually from a cold boot(1st time) it maybe a cold solder joint. Considering the problems it may cause, I install a new mtrbd. and proceed on. The same mtrbd. installed in another case and the problem doesn't come back, go figure. Sometimes cleaning the ram slots with alcohol helps or the cable connectors on mtrbd. Sorry, I've seen this too often, other than above no fix. good luck -----Willy

In the BIOS, try to detect each of the drives [no time limit in this detection] and enter those parameters in the BIOS rather than using AUTO. See if that helps. Probably use LBA on the right side of the entry. Some time ago, I thought that I had read a post on on to extend thje toime that the boot allows to detect the drive before bowing out, but can't remember where.
