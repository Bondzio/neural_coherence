<s> I am trying to install a SIIG ultra ATA/133 controller card in one of my Compaq Presario's 7AP140 (desktop) PCI slots. </s>
<s> I cannot boot up when the card is installed (Windows XP). </s>
<s> PCI slots are OK/not damaged. </s>
<s> Is there a known compatibility issue with either this card or computer? </s>
<s> Perhaps a BIOS issue? </s>
<s> http://support.radioshack.com/support_computer/doc43/43999.htm shows a 250 Watt PSU. </s>
<s> It's quite possible either you: a. found a card that doesn't work in it. </s>
<s> b. overloaded the PSU. </s>
<s> c. Have the IDE cable on wrong (try just the card!) </s>
<s> d. haven't plugged in the card all the way. </s>
<s> Best of luck, Bob </s>
