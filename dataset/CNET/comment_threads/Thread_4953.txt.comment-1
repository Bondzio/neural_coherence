a while ago i built a comp with 2x256mb sticks of pc2700 ram (making it 512).
because the motherboard supports pc3200 ram, i decided to get a 512mb stick of pc3200 ram (because it's cheap) to add to the comp.
however, instead of showing up as 1 gb of ram, which it should, it only shows up 768mb of ram.
can someone please tell me why?
also, these are the specs: Athlon 64 3200+ cpu 80 gb hard drive gigabyte k8u-939 mobo
