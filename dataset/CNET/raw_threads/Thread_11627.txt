I can record music etc. directly from my computer however since it is set to the Logictech webcam the recording will pick up any noises-speech etc. in our room.I tried setting it to &quot;Line in Sound Max integrated&quot; but that did not record any sound.Any suggestions please.Thanks. I asked this question before however here it is again.Thanks.

Better try our http://forums.cnet.com/computer-help-forum . And be sure to tell more than you do now, because I don't find the problem very clear from your post. Kees

Basically this is the problem in an easy explanation. On the mp3mymp3 window it states that for recording &quot;Logitech microphone&quot; is being used to record. However when I am recording, all noises near to the microphone are also being recorded such as a cough or anything else. I hope this is a little clearer as I do like the mp3mymp3 software. Please let me know if you have any ideas. Appreciated.
