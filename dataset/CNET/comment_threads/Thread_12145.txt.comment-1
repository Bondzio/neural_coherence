My old computer caught on fire and I'm hoping that the HD still has it's programs and documents on it.
I was told to go and get a HD enclosure for my old IDE drive.
I am a novice at this... My new computer is running Windows 7 and the old one was running Windows XP Professional.
Can I still use the HD enclosure with 2 different systems?
Is there anything I need to know before I go buy one?
Also, will I be able to take programs off of the old HD i.e.
Photoshop CS2, MS Office?
