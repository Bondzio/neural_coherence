I was djing a party last night when my computer dyed.
I have had it for about 6 months and it is my 5th computer i have built.
When the power button is hit the power supply turns on runs then fan and about 1 second later shuts off.
There are leds on the motherboard that stay on.
Nothing internally has changed.
I have: Foxconn digitalife mother board Intel quad core processor 800 watt psu 8800gts gpu 120gb 10k rpm hard drive by western digital 2(500) gb hard drives If more specifics are needed I can provide them If anyone has any clue as to what happened to my unit it would be greatly appreciated.
