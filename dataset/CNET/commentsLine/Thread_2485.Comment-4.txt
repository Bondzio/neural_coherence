the laptop maker must tell you which one.
i do not have this model to look further into.
i forget something above.
sorry.
you will never get &quot;xp&quot; installed on such gear.
those sata drivers require &quot;xp sp2&quot; or later cds.
if you have xp and i have to take your word above that's all you have then it's a dead end.
don't waste your time.
