a compaq presario had it's hard drive removed and it was cabled to a pc using a notebook ide 2/5&quot; usb adapter.
after cabling to the pc via the usb port, the pc did not see the notebook hard drive.
the operating system on the pc is xp home edition.
the notebook hard drive also has xp hoome on it.
the pc's mother board is an asus ( home made pc).
why won't the pc see the hard drive?
