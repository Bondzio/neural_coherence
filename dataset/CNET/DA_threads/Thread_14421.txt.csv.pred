1.1.1	My daughter 's computer has been acting up lately .	St
1.1.2	It 's old and slow anyway , so I decided to move my previously planned upgrade ahead by a few months in order to give her the Dell 8200 I 'm currently running .	St
1.1.3	Each system has 2 hard drives .	St
1.1.4	The secondary drive on each holds all the data .	St
1.1.5	The primary drives hold only programs .	St
1.1.6	What I plan to do is swap Abby 's secondary drive into the 8200 .	St
1.1.7	I 'll remove my secondary drive and put that into the new XPS when it arrives .	St
1.1.8	This should be just a screwdriver job , correct ?	Ques
1.1.9	WinXP should recognize the drives all by itself ?	Ques
1.1.10	There is one complicating factor : the new XPS ships with a serial ATA HDD .	St
1.1.11	The secondary drive I want to put into it is an EIDE .	St
1.1.12	I already bought a controller card for the old drive .	St
1.1.13	Is there anything I should look out for ?	Ques
1.1.14	The whole point of this exercise is to save myself the trouble of copying all this data over our LAN .	St
1.1.15	By the same token , it would be a bad thing if I lost the contents of either of these drives .	St
1.1.16	Thanks in advance for any helpful advice .	St
1.2.1	i believe the computer that you have is shipped with a SATA connector for your HDD and that the Optical drives ( DVDROM/CDROM ) are actually attached to an IDE connector using an IDE cable usually a flat and gray cable , the other one or the middle socket of such cable ( usually for the slave ) should not be in use , so that you could use/attach the old HDD .	St
1.2.2	anyway , it 's just a matter of connection availability .	St
1.2.3	can i have the specs of this XPS ?	Ques
1.2.4	is that from dell ?	Ques
1.2.5	i believe it has an IDE connector native to the MOBO .	St
1.2.6	goodluck .	St
1.3.1	You are exactly right about the optical drives .	St
1.3.2	I had n't ( but should have ) thought of them .	St
1.3.3	Since there are 2 optical drives on the XPS , I 've already used those 2 channels , but by nature of their presence , can I assume that I wo n't have to worry about drivers for the new IDE controller card ?	Ques
1.3.4	When I 've just added new hard drives to systems in the past they always shipped with all this software I did n't need anyway , at least for WinXP .	St
1.3.5	Here are the specs : Dimension XPS Series , Intel Pentium 4 Processor 660 ( 3.6GHz ) w/HT Technology and 2MB cache 2GB DDR2 SDRAM at 533MHz Dell Quiet Key Keyboard Video ready option w/o monitor 256MB Nvidia GeForce 6800 Graphics Card 250GB Serial ATA Hard Drive ( 7200RPM ) 3.5in Floppy Drive Dell Application Back-up CD , Factory Install Image Restore Windows Media Player 10 Dell Media Experience 3.0 Basic Dimension Dell Support Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition , Service Pack 2 , English Dell 2-button Scroll Mouse Intel Pro 1000 Integrated PCI NIC Card No modem requested for Dell Dimension Adobe Acrobat Reader 6.0 48x CD-RW and 16X DVD+/-RW PowerDVD Software Decoding forDVD Drives Sound Blaster Audigy 2 ZS THX Certified Sound card with DVD	St
1.4.1	card as the & quot ; controller & quot ; for your IDE drive .	St
1.4.2	Like so many newer systems the XPS only has a single IDE port [ 2 drive ] .	St
1.4.3	No reason that should n't work .	St
