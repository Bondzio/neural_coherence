9502	0	109934	1250161	NR	connienwt	6/17/05 11:37 PM	1.11905142E12	My drive A (Floppy) changed to 5 1/4!??!	I was running with ME, then I replaced it with Office 2000. I didn't like it so I got that removed and I reinstalled ME. I have not changed anything else. Now my computer is showing that I have 5 as drive A instead of the standard 3.5. I deleted the 5 using the add/remove hardware and restarted my computer and it says I have new hardware and it reverts back to 5 . If I put in a floppy it is not recognized and I just get a message telling me to insert a floppy disk! I even put a floppy in and restarted my computer and still nothing. I don't know what to do to fix it and where I'm from, it is far to expensive to bring it in to a shop. Help!

Could you PLEASE be more spacific or break it down to the level of, &quot;I know nothing, please take me by the hand and lead me through it?&quot; as to what I need to do. P L E A S E
