<s> I'll try my best to make sense of the situation. </s>
<s> I have a Brother laser printer which I have connected to my router wirelessly, and a desktop connected to the same router via ethernet. </s>
<s> Yet, when I go in Windows to add a printer, it cannot find it. </s>
<s> I have the drivers installed, and it works via USB. </s>
<s> Any advice? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Your desktop doesn't have wireless capability unless you install a wireless slot card or use a USB adapter. </s>
<s> Ah, didn't know that was necessary. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> It varies with the model but most require you to setup the wireless printer first (not on your PC!) </s>
<s> then I install the printer driver and then it knows to look on the network. </s>
<s> At no time do I need to add wifi to the desktop. </s>

<s> I tried that the first time but it didn't work. </s>
<s> After reading your post, I reset my printer and connected it to the router on the printer itself and my non-wireless enabled desktop discovered it immediately. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> wireless to connect to your printer. </s>
<s> As long as the printer is connected to your Router and your computer is connected to your router, either by wire or wireless, you are golden......As you have already discovered! </s>
