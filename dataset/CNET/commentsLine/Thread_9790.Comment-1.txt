recently i scavenged an old 486 laptop.
it boots and says it is ''media magic pn315/dstn''.
bios detects 8mb of ram.
i want to put it to work somehow, but first i would like to put in more memory.
the beast has 2 slots filled with strange memory modules.
i never met such things.
please help me identify them.
[br]   .
[br] do i have any chance of finding the upgrade?
where would you advice to look?
google search gives pretty much nothing relevant.
