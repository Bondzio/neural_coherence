i do have the desktop wired and the laptop wireless.
i guess i need to go to the linksys site on the laptop and change the channels to see if this fixes the problem.
if it doesn't would you then say i should get the new laptop?
also if i do have to get a new laptop which will have vista is there a way to uninstall visit and re-install xp?
i have never had problems with xp and have really liked it.
