i monitor my system temperatures using speedfan software when i notice the temperatures climbing or remaining high i clean it out.
the quantities of the materials i find are usually low but enough to effect the operation of the pc.
in the summer we might do it a bit more.
i also filter the air flowing into the pc to keep dust out as long as possible.
furnace filter works well and can simply be cut and taped to the inlet openings.
brief momentary stalls, hangs or crashes usually are indications of over heating.
these occur most often after long term system operation or under demanding uses like gaming, scans, and i/o indexing of the hard drive.
check if dust is the problem first before moving on to more drastic and costly measures.
major crashes can occur with major dust clogging.
if this is the trouble then the user is to blame and needs to do a better job of routine cleaning.
how's your maintenance?
warning: opening the tower/laptop during the term of the warranty can void it.
see the documentation that came with your computer for details or contact the machine's manufacture.
