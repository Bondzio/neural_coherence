<s> I recently had to get a whole new computer because my old one kept breaking. </s>
<s> I would like to put my old Hard Drive in as a slave just to get some of the information off of it. </s>
<s> Both Hard drives are SATA connections, and both have windows XP installed on them. </s>
<s> How do I put my old Hard Drive in as a slave so that the computer doesn't boot off of it? </s>

<s> Cessena, Look at the motherboard where the SATA drives are connected. </s>
<s> Each connection is numbered. </s>
<s> Usually starts with a zero. </s>
<s> Make sure your &quot;boot&quot; drive is in the lowest number and the 'old' drive is in a higer number. </s>
<s> POST will look at this sequentially at first. </s>
<s> Or, as your computer is POSTing (before the Windows logo appears, your screen should give you a chance (however small) to enter setup... usually by pressing the &lt;delete&gt; key several times during this initial start-up phase. </s>
<s> Once you are in setup... you will see the opportunity to change the boot sequence. </s>
<s> Select your desired drive here and continue the boot-up process. </s>
<s> Let us know, OK? </s>
<s> regards, Jack </s>
