It may have been due to a power problem, glitch in the hardware or malevolent action. You didn't post the specific model Belkin, but hopefully the following will help. I recommend resetting the router to its factory default setting using the Reset button on the device. Then navigate to 192.168.2.1 and adjust the settings. You may want to visit the Belkin website if you are not familiar with adjusting your router settings. If you still have your router's setup disk and feel more comfortable using that instead of the manual method, then try it that way.
