<s> I am wanting to buy a TV tuner card for my bedroom. </s>
<s> I have an external LCD TV that I watch TV and play my 360 on. </s>
<s> What I am wondering is which TV Tuner cards will allow me to use my monitor for my computer and to hook up the TV Tuner Card to the TV. </s>
<s> The way I would like to do is to have my TV hooked to the tuner card and use my computer as a PVR. </s>
<s> No one knows of a TV Tuner card that I can hook up to an external TV? </s>
<s> ...but patience is a virtue. </s>
<s> We're people with lives and things to do, as well as trying to provide assistance to strangers with problems we've never seen before! </s>
<s> So, you've got an LCD TV that you play console games on, and you want a TV card in your PC that can act as a PVR? </s>
<s> That part's easy : any TV card will allow your PC to act like a PVR. </s>
<s> You can read about many here : http://www.tv-cards.com/ The tricky part is where you're asking for a TV card to output to a TV. </s>
<s> Now let's be a clear here, there are hundreds of TV cards on the market, most have loads of input options for co-ax, S-video, cable etc. </s>
<s> but cards which have an output to drive a TV? </s>
<s> I haven't seen any of those myself, but they might exist. </s>
<s> The reason TV cards do not have outputs by default's sort of obvious. </s>
<s> The graphic output of a computer is handled by the graphics card. </s>
<s> So it's easy to put virtually any TV card into a PC to provide PVR functionality, but you then use a graphics card with a TV output to show the picture on a TV. </s>
<s> Good luck, GeeBee. </s>
