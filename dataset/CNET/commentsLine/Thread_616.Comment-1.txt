i will be going home soon, after finishing up a several year job i'm in.
so, i've been trying to plan out how i am going to have the same setup i have now, with tv, ps3, xbox, printer, network storage, etc etc.
all i have now is a wireless router, with all ports(4) being used, and a lot of things using wireless.
going home, there will be even more on the network(families computers and such), so i came up with an idea.. if the idea works.
i'm no networking expert, however i will be going to school to learn.
anyway, my plan if possible is this.. isp - switch - 1st port to my families wireless router, and a 2nd port to my wireless router, and each in their own vlan to separate them completely from each other.
i'll will only use those 2 ports on the switch.
and i will connect everything i have to only my router, and the rest of the family can use just their router.
is this possible?
or am i way off?
and if i am right do you have any suggestions for home-use switches?
thank you for your help in advance.
