After just over a year my Epson Stylus C84 just died-I decided to go for an all-in-one, and am trying to decide between the Canon Pixma mp450 and mp500. Any suggestions? If you purchased the mp500 did you consider the mp450, and if so what made you choose the mp500? Same question for those who purchased the mp450. Thanks!!

Just my $.02 ~Ibrahim~ P.S.I would go to a store that retails both, try them out, ask the salesman/saleswoman if they'd let you test print one of your pictures.
