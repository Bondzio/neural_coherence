I'm very confused: i have a 500 gig seagate external hard drive that i have a bunch of stuff from an old mac backed up on... recently, i bought a windows-based notebook, but then decided i didn't like it, so i'm selling it to my dad... i hooked up the external hard drive to the notebook so i could back up songs, etc that were on there... i could not get the notebook to access to drive, so i went into disk utility and &quot;created a simple volume&quot; that was 15 gigs large, and assigned it a drive letter, which worked... i copied everything onto that simple volume... i expected that when i hooked the external drive back up to a mac, i could access those files within a volume on the drive, and all the files that were already on the drive would be in the unpartitioned space... so... i hooked the drive back up to a mac to see if it worked... but now all that displays is a 15 gig &quot;drive&quot; that is the volume i created on windows... i can't find the files that were on the drive prior to this anywhere... but then again, i can't even get the computer to recognize that there is anything there beyond the volume i created... my question is (a) did i totally screw myself and erase everything on the drive by creating that 15 gig volume? if not (really hoping not), how do i access the data outside the volume? i thought creating a partition/volume just created a little section within the free space that i was copied data into... was i wrong? please help!!!

As to the MAC, all the details would be needed but at some point Apple added NTFS support to their OS. If not you would install MacFuse. Bob
