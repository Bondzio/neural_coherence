But I'm getting ahead of myself here.
This is not an answer to how to get VPN to work across routers that don't do VPN but what I see companies do for the mobile troops.

They put what is needed up on a web server with a https:// interface.
Secure http is the next step and your company moves from VPN to web interfaces for the workflow.
