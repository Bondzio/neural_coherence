This is the pc i have been putting together: p4 lga775 540j 3.2ghz GA-8I915P Duo Pro 120gb sata hd (i have not bought any ram yet but i know what i will buy.) The main issue is which graphics card i will buy, i play alot of games and i am looking to purchase a card most suited to my needs. My monitor is capable of high resolutions so this is not an issue, as i want to play games at high detail. I am thinking of either 6800gt, 6800 ultra or a 7800gtx. I am also aware of the new ati line of cards just around the corner. Is a 7800gtx over kill for my system? I want the card to last me a fair amount of time, i may choose to upgrade cpu etc in future, but the price difference is a considerable amount between these cards. Could a 6800 ultra cope with modern games at highest settings? Any thoughts or help on this would be gratefully accepted.

Also, take alook at the 7800GT for more performance than a 6800 Ultra but cheaper than the GTX. These cards do not come in AGP, only PCI Express. The 7 series can handle any game out there as of right now.
