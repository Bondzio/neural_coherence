I had to disconnect it to move my computer and when I hooked it back up, the drive letter doesn't appear. When I go into my device manager it shows up and when I click &quot;properties&quot; it says, &quot;This device is working properly.&quot; Any advice? Its a Western Digital WD300BB. I am running XP Pro.

Fixes include software like GETDATABACK and Zero Assumption Recovery. I take it you put it back in the same USB socket, another socket and have powered down the entire as part of your troubleshooting. Bob

It's promptly repurposed here but most should cut it in two and toss it. Such cables can cause data corruption later even if it appears to work. May I add that was good troubleshooting on your part.
