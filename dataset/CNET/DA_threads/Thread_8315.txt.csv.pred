1.1.1	Help !	St
1.1.2	I just purchased an IBM Thinkpad T42 Notebook ( Win XP Pro ) computer with the Intel Pro 2200B/B wireless card and am having major problems connecting wirelessly to the internet .	St
1.1.3	I need help .	St
1.1.4	Here is where I am : Day 1 : Got computer and set it up on my 128-bit encripted home wireless network ; everything was working flawlessly , and I spent 3 hours on the internet , downloading software and reconfiguring my favorite internet sites on the new computer .	St
1.1.5	At the end of the evening , I went to Windows update and downloaded and installed SP2 before going to bed , happy with my new notebook .	St
1.1.6	Day 2 : Ca n't get on the internet via my wireless network with the new computer , but my two other computers ( both XP home , no SP2 ) continue to connect flawlessly on my wireless network .	St
1.1.7	Spend hours on the phone with IBM support making sure my Intel 2200B/G driver ( 8.1.0.28 ) and my IBM Access Connections software ( 3.53 ) are the latest versions .	St
1.1.8	-tried removing IBM Access Connection and using MS Wireless Zero Config -tried disabling MS Wireless Zero config and using only IBM Access Connection Day 3 : After hours on the phone with tech support , nothing works or helps .	St
1.1.9	My family misses me ... .	St
1.1.10	In most instances , the computer can see my encripted wireless network , but it can not access it .	St
1.1.11	In frustration , I reformated the hard drive using the IBM Access program ( which supposedly totally reformates the drive and brings the drive back to its initial factory specs ) .	St
1.1.12	To my suprise , this program reformated the drive WITH SP2 as part of the install .	St
1.1.13	So I ca n't even get back to where I was on Day 1 .	St
1.1.14	When I go to control panel add/remove programs , SP2 is NOT listed .	St
1.1.15	Day 4 : I am worried because after reading about all the problems with SP2 and wireless ( over the last 24 hours ) , that instead of spending more time trying to figure out why the wireless network access is n't working for the new computer , I just want to configure my new system similarly to when it was working on Day 1 .	St
1.1.16	Basically , unless anyone can tell me how to fix my wireless access problem in the presence of SP2 , I want to remove SP2 ( need someone to tell me how to do this ) and move on with my life .	St
1.1.17	Please help !	St

1.2.1	It 's new , support has failed you and this is how you set the world right again .	St
1.2.2	I 've returned such many a time .	St
1.2.3	It 's not worth spending weeks fixing their hardware .	St

1.3.1	I was hoping for a different answer .	St
1.3.2	I 've got the same story : the computer worked perfectly out of the box .	St
1.3.3	I installed and transferred numerous files .	St
1.3.4	Then , after configuring the new computer , I can no longer access wirelessly .	St
1.3.5	Of course my old computer is now being used by somebody else , after reformatting the hard drive .	St
1.3.6	After also spending hours with IBM Help , IBM has sent me a box to ship them the computer back under warranty .	St
1.3.7	But , sometimes I can use the same computer on my wireless network at work without any problem .	St
1.3.8	However , some times when hitting the & lt ; funtion } F5 button ( which should toggle the wireless radio on and off ) , the system does n't even show I have a wireless radio !	St
1.3.9	I do n't have any confidence in the IBM warranty , and I really do n't want to be without my new computer for weeks .	St
1.3.10	Is n't there a better solution ?	Ques
1.4.1	It sounds terrible , but you buy two machines and use the one that works and ship the defective one back and forth .	St
1.4.2	If the use is mission critical you need not only data backup but backup hardware .	St
