Comcast has upgraded their system to a newer protocol.
Some of the older modems are not compatible.
The list of modems is at the Comcast site.
And the new protocol enables faster speeds.
I replaced my D-link DCM-200 to a new DCM-202 and my speed went from 3 Mb/s to over 6.
And Comcast is in the process of upgrading again to an advertised 11 Mb/s.
Replace the modem.
