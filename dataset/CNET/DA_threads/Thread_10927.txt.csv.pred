1.1.2	I know i know they are ancient and stuff but i refurbish older computer parts and make cheap computers that people can use such as me and my brother and sister .	St

1.1.6	Is there a way to fix this problem .	St
1.2.1	Hi .	St
1.2.2	Any beeps from the speaker or signal from the keyboard ?	Ques
1.2.3	To check the board if it 's good , turn it on and see if the Num lock , KeyLock and Scroll Lock lights up .	Sug
1.2.4	Also listen for beeps from the speakers .	Sug
1.3.1	and does the power supply match the type ?	Ques
1.3.2	Need a better explanation as to what you mean by & quot ; no response from the HD or floppy & quot ; .	St
