1.1.1	Hi experts!	St
1.1.2	Please help with an answer on subnetting I take a class B address, say 172.16.0.0/16 and borrow 3 bits from the host portion, the new subnet mask is 255.255.255.224 The subnets are172.16.0.0/19172.16.32.0/19172.16.64.0/19172.16.96.0/19172.16.128.0/19172.16.160.0/19172.16.192.0/19172.16.224.0/19 I am totally confused here.	St
1.1.3	1) Please let me know how many subnets are possible, if I borrow 3bits.	Sug
1.1.4	Is it 2^3 = 8 subnetsor (2^3)-2=6 subnets?	St
1.1.5	2) I believe 172.16.0.0/19 cannot be used by defaultto use this subnet, ip subnet-zero command has to be issued 3) Is 172.16.224.0/19, a valid subnet?What is the first host address, last host address andthe broadcast address for this subnet?RegardsVijay	St
1.2.1	In combination with your other post I get the impression that you're asking the forum members to do your homework for a network course.	St
1.2.2	We never do.	Polite
1.2.3	Homework is something to do yourself.	St
1.2.4	Otherwise you won't learn anything.	St
