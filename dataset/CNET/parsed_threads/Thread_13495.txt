<s> What is everyone's opinion of Airlink? </s>
<s> I have an Airlink Wireless G router and am having trouble getting a steady connection on it. </s>
<s> Most of the times it works, but a couple of times a day it seems to die for a few minutes. </s>
<s> Turning WEP off helped, but didn't fix the problem entirely. </s>
<s> I forgot to say that sometimes I can get one website and not another. </s>
<s> Just a couple of minutes ago I could access Wikipedia but not Cnet or my school's website (byu.edu). </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> for the tips you need to keep a connection. </s>

<s> I am not trying to find information on how to work a router in general. </s>
<s> I know typical installations. </s>
<s> And it isn't some Vista bug that is causing problems because I have two XP machines and one Mac that are experiencing the same problem. </s>
<s> I just wanted to know if anybody else is having problems with this brand. </s>
<s> Do you have experience with this brand? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> I re-read your post and couldn't tell if you followed the suggestions in our forum sticky. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> &quot;but a couple of times a day it seems to die for a few minutes&quot; is typical of when you or your neighbor has those 2.4GHz cordless phones. </s>
<s> There's no fix for this if you can't banish them except to get wired. </s>

<s> Airlink technology and mfg is no better or worse than other brands. </s>
<s> They package Wifi chipsets & RF just like the others do. </s>
<s> Their firmware lack fancy features available in the Linksys, Netgear, Dlink and Buffalo brands but it works reliably. </s>
<s> Your problem may be in setup as other replies suggest. </s>
<s> I will only add that if your AP/router is not MIMO, you can expect poorer connections. </s>
<s> For the low price nowadays, always get a MIMO (g or n) device. </s>
<s> The client need not be MIMO. </s>
<s> I hadn't thought of wireless phones. </s>
<s> I will check this out, see if one of my neighbors has one. </s>
<s> Thank you for your post. </s>
<s> I will try some different settings to get it to work better. </s>
<s> I wired a computer into the router, and still have issues. </s>
<s> I will probably just reset the router every week. </s>
<s> That seems to work for a while. </s>
<s> And it's my laptop then I know the router has issues. </s>
<s> Or someone is running P2P applications. </s>
<s> Some routers have issues with P2P but do check for their latest firmware and tell us if you are running P2P. </s>
