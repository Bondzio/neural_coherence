Here's the article about it but for most folk, it's a non-starter as no common internet service uses it. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6 So unless you are doing research and willing to setup your own server and lose months of time, I suggest you forget about it.

The best way to think of this is that it is just a different name for your computer. It does not have any affect at all on the way data is sent between machines or the way applications process the data. The key benefit to IPV6 is that there are more internet routable IP addresses. The key reason that not much has happened with IPV6 is that the vast majority of people do not even need the one IP address their ISP gives them now. NAT along with the ability of servers to share IP with DNS tricks has kept IPV6 on the sidelines so far.
