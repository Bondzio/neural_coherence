Hi, I just bought a Dell dimension 8400.
I installed a wireless PCI card (D-Link G520+) in it, and receive the same blue screen when the machine shuts down.
D-link points to Dell.
First line support of Dell has no clue.
I am awaiting results of escalation within Dell.
Any feedback of users having same problem would be welcome.
