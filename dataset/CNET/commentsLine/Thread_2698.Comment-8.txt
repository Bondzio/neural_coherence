actually, someone told me something different about formatting.
this also reminded me on how i reformatted my first external hdd.
i opened up the command prompt window, typed in n: /fs:ntfs (yes, suddenly it became n. it used to be g: ) and so far it's working.
it takes time but it's 14% complete now (almost 2 hours in the reformatting process).
