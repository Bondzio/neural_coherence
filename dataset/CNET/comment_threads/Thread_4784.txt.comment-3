Oh yeah and maybe you should wait for Leopard.
I don't want a debate started here but its a strong suggestion.
Now that we are in 2007, iLife 07 should be very close to release.
and if you can hold on to buying a laptop, then you should wait for Leopard the new Mac OS to release.
It will have many cool new features like automatic backup, multiple desktops etc to name a few.
It is also rumoured tham the Graphical User Interface will change from Aqua(current on Tiger) to Illuminous which will have black and dark colours.
It is also said that the new OS normally works faster than the previous OS on the same hardware.
I dont know about this but I have heard people saying this.
