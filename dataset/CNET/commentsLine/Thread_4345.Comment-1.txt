have a dial up connection on a pii system with win 98. i can go on line and everything operates normally, but after a while i cannot go into new pages...always get an error message.
if i close down the connection and then reload, the system again works normally.
i recently removed a trojan worm and do not know if this is a residual problem or if my modem is beginning to fail.
any advice?
