I'd clarify that response even further ... the phrase &quot;high definition&quot; simply refers to resolution, and unless it specifically says &quot;high definition TV&quot; (aka &quot;HDTV&quot;) then you'd be comparing apples to oranges.
Basically, to be considered 'high def' a computer monitor just needs to support reolutions greater than 640x480 (VGA).
Nearly all 15 inch or larger monitors -- crt as well as flat panel -- support Super VGA (800x600) and higher resos, and hence are high definition.
The most succinct definition of 'hdtv' I've found so far is this: a television screen offering at least double the resolution of the highest quality standard definition TV screen (NTSC standard picture quality = 648 X 486 at 60 Hz refresh rate).
So ... if you want to know if a monitor really is 'High Def' then find out what it's highest resolution is.
