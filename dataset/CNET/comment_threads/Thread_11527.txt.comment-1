I have a Dell PC that I bought at a closing down sale and only cost $1200.
Problem I have is that the digital cable I had to connect it to the monitor (came with pc) does not fit the back of the pc.
This cable was already connected to the back of the monitor, and both ends of this cable are identical, and have a symbol that is identical to the symbol on the port on the PC.
This symbol is the same as my sisters cable, but in her PC, she has a slightly different port.
It's the same as in the back of her monitor.
My problem is, even though the symbol is the same, is this a digital cable or not?
I can't get the cable to fit it.
Thankyou all.
