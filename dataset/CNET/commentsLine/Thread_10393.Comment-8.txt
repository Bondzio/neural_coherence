ok, there was not a firmware update for the router, but there was a driver update for the laptop.
however this did not fix my problem.
i changed channels and that also didn't work.
so, i decided to turn off security and set a mac filter.
guess what?
that fixed the problem!
i am not sure if this is the best solution or why the security was slowing me down so much, but everything is working fine now.
