<s> So, I am in the process of doing the research to build myself a new computer. </s>
<s> For the most part im pretty sure i have a good grasp on what i want and need except for the video/graphics card... </s>
<s> I do a lot of work with 3DS Max, Solidworks, CAD, Photoshop & Illustrator CS3/4, etc.. and Im not sure what video card would be best for those applications. </s>
<s> I hardly do any gaming what so ever. </s>
<s> At the moment i have been looking at the ASUS EN9800GT. </s>
<s> I have heard good things about it from multiple sources but nothing pertaining to its performance on 3D modeling. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any suggestions as far as what card would be best for 3D modeling? </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> professional 3d apps publish a list of &quot;certified&quot; cards for their app. </s>
<s> these certified cards are usually nvidia quadro and ati firegl cards however they use the exact gpu as the consumer geforce and radeon product lines. </s>
<s> the only difference is the these professional cards are provided with enhanced drivers and software support to ensure top level support for the pro 3d apps. </s>
<s> some apps perform better with ati cards and some perform better with nvidia cards. </s>
<s> the difference between the two is usually only noticeable to people who use a certain app *all day long*. </s>
<s> any current radeon or geforce will work with illustrator, maya, autocad, etc. </s>
<s> but they may produce anamolies that you may or may not encounter. </s>
<s> these anamolies are bugs that the graphics card vendor has no obligation to fix and most are bugs that are very infrequent or easily worked around. </s>
<s> so the &quot;best&quot; card can be found by checking the forums for your various apps and determining the latest/greatest ati/nvidia card, or sticking with a 9800gt (as you mentioned) and only upgrading if it has some deficiency that you cannot tolerate. </s>
