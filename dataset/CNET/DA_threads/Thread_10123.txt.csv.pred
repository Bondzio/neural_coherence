1.1.1	I am planning to build a gaming PC for college at Penn State .	St
1.1.2	This is the end of my senior year in high school and I want to use my cash from working to build ( from scratch ) a very powerful desktop that I can use to play LAN/Online competitively with my friends on campus .	St
1.1.3	I 've done some research but I am not a tech genius and I was hoping the forums could help me put together the best machine I can .	St
1.1.4	Please point out any of my machine 's shortcomings and please let me know how I could improve it .	St
1.1.5	If any of this is incompatible or does n't work please let me know .	St
1.1.6	Looking to Spend $ 3000 roughly but am willing to adjust up or down .	St

Item=N82E16819115034 & Tpk=QX9650 Graphics : I really really need advice here .	St
1.1.8	I think there are new cards coming out soon but unless those are INSANE I will probably stick with a card that is already out .	St
1.1.9	I have not been able to figure out exactly what would work best here , but these are my ideas so far : Plan A : 2 or 3 ( I heard 3 was possible but heating , space , cost could be prohibiting ) BFG GeForce 9800 GTX 512MB , 256 -bit GDDR3 PCI Express 2.0x16 HDCP Ready SLI Supported Video Card http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814143132 Plan B : Same as Plan A but with BFG Tech BFGR88768GTXOCE GeForce 8800 GTX 768MB 384-bit GDDR3 PCI Express x16 HDCP Ready SLI Supported Video Card instead .	St
1.1.10	Which is really better ?	Ques
1.1.11	I thought the 9800 was a newer , better card but the 8800 has more memory and is 384 bit .	St
1.1.12	It is also listed as PCI , not PCI 2.0 , but I 'm not sure how important that is .	St
1.1.13	Basically the 9800 has higher clock speeds , but the 8800 seems to have the higher memory and 384-bit ?	Ques
1.1.14	Could someone help me out with this ?	Ques
1.1.15	I also heard the Gigabyte 8800 comes OCed to 700mhz but can be bumped to 800mhz with an included voltage mod chip .	St
1.1.16	Anyone know anything about this ?	Ques
1.1.17	That sounds absolutely blazing fast .	St
1.1.18	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814143080 Plan C : I could ( this is really expensive though ... .. ) get 2 BFG Tech BFGE981024GX2E GeForce 9800GX2 1GB ( 512 per GPU ) 512-bit ( 256 bit per GPU ) GDDR3 PCI Express 2.0x16 HDCP Ready SLI supported Video Cards .	St
1.1.19	That sounds sick but since each of 9800GX2 is actually 2 cards ( using one slot ) I am not 100 % sure how well this would work in SLI .	St
1.1.20	I would buy this one stock and then OC it since the OC version is $ 120 more expensive per 9800GX2 .	St
1.1.21	I would expect this to be absolutely crazy graphics .	St
1.1.22	But a high price for sure and perhaps I could add a third card to Plan A or Plan B that would actually come out to about the same price and power as this .	St
1.1.23	I have not decided on a Monitor yet so any input on that would be awesome .	St
1.1.24	For dvd/cd drives I think I can manage that , but I am concerned with the compatibility of all the above .	St
1.1.25	I have no idea on what I can do for cooling and Power Supply Unit .	St
1.1.26	I want to stick with Air Cooling if possible because Water Cooling sounds complicated , but my case can do both .	St
1.1.27	With this type of setup a large power supply seems necessary , so any advice would be helpful and do you think water cooling is necessary with this setup ?	Ques
1.1.28	If so , is there any product you would recommend ?	Ques
1.1.29	Please especially point out compatibility issues .	St
1.1.30	I also still need lots of help in deciding between 9800 SLI , 8800 SLI , or 9800GX2 SLI .	St
1.1.31	LOL I already know this is going a bit over what I wanted to spend but as long as the final product comes together well I can deal with it .	St
1.1.32	Please let me know if my setup is unbalanced ( IE way too much CPU and not enough RAM or GPU ) .	Sug
1.1.33	All help is appreciated- Thanks much .	St
1.2.1	That system is over the top .	St
1.2.2	If you 're someone whose finances allow it , go for it .	St
1.2.3	If you have to pay for part of your own college expenses , I 'd suggest you could back off a notch or two and retain the ability to play all current games and most any game that 'll come out in the next couple years .	Sug
1.2.4	Sometimes the better way to make a system future-proof is to budget for upgrades in the future .	St
1.2.5	Another issue is that theft is often prevalent college areas .	St
1.2.6	Two university buildings I was in were ransacked specifically taking only computers & hi-tech equip .	St
1.2.7	Video Plan B looks fine to me .	St
1.2.8	OS : You 'll need 64-bit with your RAM set up -- you can get OEM/system builder versions of Vista Home Premium 64 for $ 100-130ish .	St
1.2.9	I do n't imagine a gamer would find much in Vista Biz to merit going with Vista Ultimate .	St
1.2.10	Places to cut back : Prob'ly 4 GB would be more than enough for a gamer .	St
1.2.11	The & quot ; Extreme & quot ; line from Intel are really nice , but are just incrementally faster than the ones at ~ half the price .	St
1.2.12	Graphics : To me the nice part of SLI/Crossfire is that you can get really good graphics performance without having to buy the most expensive cards .	St
1.2.13	What could you be planning to do that a single 9800 GTX/X2 or 8800 GTX ca n't handle ?	Ques
1.2.14	So you could start with one now , and add another in a year or two when the prices have come down more and maybe there 'll be a good game that will play better with more .	Sug
1.2.15	Or shave some $ $ off and go with 2x 8800 GT .	St
1.2.16	My reasoning is that you 'll get kick-butt framerates , and except for e-peen there 's no benefit in having fps higher than you can see .	St
1.2.17	I think a dual SLI is fine for gaming - three would be unwanted headaches anyway .	St
1.2.18	That mobo just has 2 slots for it , right ?	Ques
1.2.19	Monitors : When I think of college students , I think of small apartments .	St
1.2.20	So perhaps a monitor that can double as your xbox-360 screen would be nice ?	Sug
1.2.21	I like the Gateway FHD2400 - nice looking glossy screen , supports picture in picture , takes component + composite inputs in addition to HDMI/VGA/DVI .	St
1.3.1	Solid case choice .	St
1.3.2	Should provide a good home for upgrades down the road .	St
1.3.3	I would consider moving to a 790i board from EVGA or XFX .	St
1.3.4	Or even a 780i by either .	St
1.3.5	Asus had some trouble wt 780i quality .	St
1.3.6	Nvidia 9800 xxx vidcards should see a major price drop tomorrow .	St
1.3.7	( june 3rd open for computex ) Evga all ready posted a plan to drop prices on the 3rd .	St
1.3.8	Wt Nahalem due out 4thQ and intel planning the release of new 45nm parts for 3Q your CPU is overkill .	St
1.3.9	& quot ; Way bigtime overkill & quot ; Q9650 at q9550 price , Q9400 replacing Q9300 at same P point .	St
1.3.10	E8600 at about the same P point E8500 .	St
1.3.11	Step your CPU choice down by $ 600 to $ 700 ie to an e8400 or q9450 wt a plan to upgrade .	St
1.3.12	Rember a good PSU wt stable voltages is the heart of every COMP .	St
1.4.1	I ca n't figure out which is faster between the various 9800 and 8800 models .	St
1.4.2	I thought the 9800 was faster , but then I heard that the Gigabyte 8800GT can easily be OCed to 770-780 on top of its factory OC at 700mhz .	St
1.4.3	If this is true , that makes it one hell of a fast card , but most tech comparisons seem to show the 9800s putting out higher FPS numbers .	St
1.4.4	I want to run 3 of one type of these cards in SLI , but I am not even sure if the 8800GT can be run in 3 way SLI ( I know the Ultra can ) .	St
1.4.5	Excluding the 9800GX2 , what SINGLE SLOT GPU out of the 8800 and 9800 lines is the best for gaming ?	Ques
1.4.6	On top of that , which company would you recommend to buy it from ?	Ques
1.4.7	The responses so far have been very helpful so far and I think I have most everything ironed out and finalized except for the GPU .	St
1.4.8	I need to know what GPU should be pushing this 3x SLI setup .	St
1.4.9	Thanks for the responses ^^ .	St
1.5.1	It seems that the 9800GTX is the fastest , but in higher resolutions and with AA on it gets bottlenecked by its low memory and low memory bandwith .	St
1.5.2	When this happens the 8800 Ultra is the fastest .	St
1.5.3	Since I 'll be running a 3x SLI I do n't expect to have those same memory issues and I am assuming raw clock speeds would be more important at that point because the combined 1.5 GB of VRAM should be able to soak up texture heavy visuals and AA ( or at least I hope ) .	St
1.5.4	Also since SLI does n't actually lower the latencies ( only increases frame rates ) it is really important that each individual GPU is fast .	St
1.5.5	Also I like the powersaving of the hybridpower function of the 9800GTX .	St
1.5.6	I am still considering which company to buy from but am leaning towards Gigabyte because of the ability to edit voltage , easy OCing , and low prices .	St
1.5.7	I also have not heard anything about how well the 9800s ( specifically Gigabyte 's ) are overclocking .	St
1.5.8	I know that their version of the 8800GT was a beast , but I have not been able to find ANYTHING on their 9800GTX .	St
1.5.9	Anyone know what average overclocks are yielding on the 9800GTX ?	Ques
1.5.10	Please let me know what you guys think about the GPUs and let me know if anything I said was wrong so I can put together a great system .	Sug
1.5.11	Thanks again for the responses and I 'll make a post tomorrow of a refined build incorporating your ideas .	St
1.5.12	If anyone else has advice at all please help me out .	Ques
1.6.1	Time for a reality check : If you 're going with a 3-way SLI with top/near-top of the line graphics cards ... Why , pray tell , would you care to overclock ?	Ques
1.6.2	Is there something you 're doing on the machine that is n't just games ?	Ques
1.6.3	Dual SLI with 8800 or 9800 anything will handle any game that 's been made or is on the horizon .	St
1.6.4	Triple , if you can keep it stable , will play just as well .	St
1.6.5	Overclocked triple , will play just as well .	St
1.6.6	Not better , just as well .	St
1.6.7	'cuz if you 're at max settings with 30+ fps , it looks the same as 60 fps .	St
1.6.8	overcompensating for something ?	Ques
1.7.1	I understand that with 2-3 high end cards this setup will be able to burn through most games easily .	St
1.7.2	Once you are past 60 FPS , the rest is really just & quot ; nice to have. & quot ; But I am not building this machine for epeen or to have those & quot ; nice to have & quot ; fps .	St
1.7.3	In reality , even a couple games already out ( Crysis ) or ones on the horizon will really put this machine through the paces quickly .	St
1.7.4	My main concern is that I want a computer that will continue to produce 60 FPS for about three years into the future with minimal upgrades .	St
1.7.5	Since overclocking is & quot ; free & quot ; ( in that I can do at least some of it on my own ) and since I do not mind extra fan noise , it seems like a smart way to get a lot more mileage out of the system .	St
1.7.6	I have 3 months before college which should give me time to order , build , install , and overclock the whole setup once and for all .	St
1.7.7	That way 1 year from now I do n't have to start adding fans and try to overclock it then .	St
1.7.8	That being said , what are people 's opinions on ram ?	Ques
1.7.9	Should I go for 2x 2 GB DDR3 faster ram or should I go with 4x 2GB DDR2 slower ram ( but with better latency ) ?	Ques
1.7.10	I am leaning towards the DDR3 for now with a possible addition of 2 more 4 GB sticks a year or two down the road .	St
1.7.11	The reason I ask is that the latency throws me off a little .	St
1.7.12	I have read some articles on it but was wondering what people thought .	St
