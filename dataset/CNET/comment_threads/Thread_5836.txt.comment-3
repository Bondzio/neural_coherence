If the drive was used for backups to be run during the night it might not be a problem.
I would only recommend a wired connection of course.
I'm trying to find a low-cost network backup solution for residential folks.
It seems that if we try to depend on a drive attached to a system and shared, the connection is not always reliable especially in a mixed Windows environment.
Thoughts?
