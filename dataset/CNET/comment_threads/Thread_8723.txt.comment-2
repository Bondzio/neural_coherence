1/ Check all cards and leads are firmly in place 2/Set your bios to run in safe mode - if you are running in ultra DMA mode and your cable is not up to it then you will get similar problems to what you are experiencing.
If you are able to boot OK reset your DMA to a lower setting.
3/You may have slightly damaged the hard drive cable so use the one the DVD is using and just boot to your HD.
3/ If you can boot to your CDROM then use the XP recovery console and at the command prompt type: CHKDSK /r This may fix any registry keys that were not properly written to when you previously shut down.
4/ If you have a virus emergency disk use it!!
Let us know how you go - if this doesn't work we can try 5 6 7 8 9!
Also if you get an error message just before it reboots this may help with diagnosing the problem.
For future purposes I will give you some guidance with producing an emergency CD that will allow you to boot into a CD with a system similar to safe mode - this will allow you to may repairs using a number of programs.
