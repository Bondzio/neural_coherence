it's partly why folk go to art school.
sure you could pick up a brush and paint but there's nothing like diving in and doing.
also with a little helpful advice.
since you have never used such before you can't know if this tool is going to be what you like.
so price is the best decision maker here.
that way you can see if it's the tool you dreamed of and as far as size or other features go, it won't matter when you select your next device.
