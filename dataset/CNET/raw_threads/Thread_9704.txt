1533	5	513689	5068928	5068413	VAPCMD	1/22/11 9:25 AM	1.2956883E12	Repeating 'Without knowing what computer you have	(mfg, series/product line and model #) and how it's currently configured ... no way provide specific help re upgrading.' &quot;oh. its windows xp dell machiene&quot; doesn't meet the requirement. Dell has manufactured hundreds perhaps thousands of different PCs over the years. Without knowing exactly which one you have and whether it's been upgraded or modified previously .... there's not much specific help anyone can provide to you. It may be the case that buying new versus upgrading may be the best option. VAPCMD
