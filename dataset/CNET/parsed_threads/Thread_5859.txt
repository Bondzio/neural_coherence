<s> I have a macbook air of storage capacity 64GB and it is insufficient for my videos, photos and music. </s>
<s> I bought a time capsule, intending to use it as a media server but how am I going to backup these files if I store them on a time capsule. </s>
<s> Alternatively I can store them on a portable external hard drive. </s>
<s> I think that is a better option actually but how am I going to back up an external hard drive? </s>
<s> Appreciate some advice. </s>
<s> I use a few externals, memory sticks and &quot;sync&quot; software to keep them all in sync. </s>
<s> Remember that such things are not &quot;storage&quot; since one slip of the mouse button and we've deleted or formatted a drive. </s>
<s> So the old IT lore of backup rules is written over and over. </s>
<s> Safety in numbers and in location. </s>
<s> A single backup is not safe enough. </s>
