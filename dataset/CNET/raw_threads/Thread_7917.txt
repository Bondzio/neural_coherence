I prefer such because of what we can do with a rogue hotspot. Here's some reading. http://www.privatewifi.com/wifi-pineapple-redux-hacking-toy-offers-no-legitimate-use-tricks-hotspot-users/ Such an open network is a bad idea. I can't guess why anyone does this unless they didn't know. Let's say you do put up an open WiFi spot and it's called (SSID) freewifi. Let's say I get near your office with my pineapple and do what the article portends. Now will the folk that use your free wifi be upset with you over what I did? Bob
