is it ok to switch back and forth (periodically like once a week or less) if i want to use it on the main pc with firewire and then turn it off & hook it up to the laptop with usb, and then off again to use it on the main pc?
i assume it is, but i was just wondering.
i tried searching for my question before posting and didn't find it...sorry for the repost.
