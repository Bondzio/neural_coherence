<s> Hello, I recently had my 3YO WD internal HD die on me and I replaced it with the WD3200AAKS model. </s>
<s> From the onset I noticed a slight slowdown in performance and a progressively louder noise coming from the HD. </s>
<s> I've got a 3YO Dell XPS Gen 5, OS is Winxp and 4GB DDR RAM. </s>
<s> I'm wondering if there's anything I can really do? </s>
<s> It clearly is spinning loudly because the sound will increase as I add more workload to it. </s>
<s> If I so much as look at graphic intensive stuff it'll start getting louder and louder and it's driving me insane. </s>
<s> Too bad your old drive model wasn't shared. </s>
<s> Looking at the specs at http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.asp?DriveID=299 I see the 2mS seek time will make this a fast but different sounding drive from what most would have had. </s>
<s> Also the noise level is pretty high at Seek Mode 0 </s>
<s> Larger sized HDs when they get spinning will make slightly more noticeable sounds(noise). </s>
<s> However, it shouldn't be confused with &quot;resonance&quot; from metal-to-metal contact and/or tray setups. </s>
<s> If resonance use a small thin rubber/plastic washer between screw and HD where they screw down. </s>
<s> If tray type, use some foam between slot and guide to help there. </s>
<s> if the HD itself is making the noise by simply being ON, its not the seek&fetch data cycles. </s>
<s> if the noise is too much and it seems to work OK, then use the RMA process to return under warranty. </s>
<s> Heat kills HDs and they can make noise before they die, so have a back-up plan in place to save critical data and/or a full image. </s>
<s> If heat the cause of HD failure, be sure to clean innards and provide better cooling as the problem will continue. </s>
<s> Also, verify that any screws aren't &quot;real tight&quot; they need be only snug. </s>

<s> Thanks for the advice. </s>
<s> The sound is like the HD is revving. </s>
<s> I'm using HD Tune Pro and I've been on the pc for about 30 minutes and the temp is 102 degrees fahrenheit. </s>
<s> I'm not sure if that's good or bad. </s>
<s> I'm using their acoustic management option and the pc is not making that revving noise. </s>
<s> I guess that confirms that it is a spinning issue. </s>
<s> At least I can Would a cooling system help? </s>
<s> It's a Dell XPS Gen 5 which has 4 HD slots (only 1 is being used). </s>
<s> Increased system cooling should benefit the whole system. </s>
<s> While you have 1 HD present, the system case is putting out the heat and &quot;airflow&quot; is key to maintaining a desired level. </s>
<s> Thus, be sure any dust bunnies are cleaned out, the cables/harness is routed well, any possible frt. </s>
<s> panel filter/inlets are clear and all fans are working now. </s>
<s> Add an extra fan(s) to &quot;exhaust&quot; if empty placement is available. </s>
<s> Check out: http://www.frozencpu.com/ for what's out there and others. </s>
<s> Cooling in general is always a plus. </s>
