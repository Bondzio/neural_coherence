Recently purchased MacBook Pro 17&quot;.
All fonts are micro type.
Web pages are columns using only one half to one third of the nice big screen.
I can &quot;zoom&quot; but that is not a permanent solution.
This includes the tool bar........ its tiny.
How do I make things readable and fit the screen?
I cannot find the answer in the manual or online but I may be searching the wrong criteria.
Help in the form of the correct web page is fine.
