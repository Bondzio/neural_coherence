<s> SuperOS is, most likely, too heavy for a netbook. </s>
<s> Leenux is a good one, but there are many others -- Please see some of the distros developed for netbooks here http://linux.softpedia.com/get/System/Operating-Systems/Linux-Distributions/Ubuntu-Netbook-Remix-Maverick-Meerkat-57326.shtml not just the one the link points to. </s>
