Backup is defined quite well out there.
It's that copy you have put somewhere for the day your hard disk or such device goes wonky.
Where is that backup?
&quot;DOS_FAT_32 partition type.&quot; That's the worst possible file system to trust for USB hard disks.
I always feel sad when I see those.
Good luck, Bob
