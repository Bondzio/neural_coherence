after years with both, plextor feels no different and in fact i feel like i overpaid for such.
now i just pick out the cheap unit, place it in the rack with airspace top/bottom and good cooling.
never lost an unit that wasn't 4 years old.
roxio bolloxes up the system too much for me, so i prefer nero and more often than not i use cdburnerxp since it gets the job done without complaining it didn't come with the drive.
