i &quot;cut&pasted&quot; your md# and *only* got your query as an answer via google, so either that model# is wrong or you have a very unique wd product.
i suggest reverify the model#, etc.
and recheck with google or any search engine and see what pops up.
i have found wd to be very helpful on thier support website on all products.
maybe type there under thier search button nd check results.
otherwise, open wd wenclosure and see what decal in on the wd drive itself.
you can as robert mention buy a new enclosure or an adapter(if applicable) to mount to desktop and get any data, again if possible(not a true hd failure).
ok?
