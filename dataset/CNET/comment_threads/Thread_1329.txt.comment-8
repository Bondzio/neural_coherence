Experience is where the answers will be found!
So sharing is key.
It's definitely helpful for me, since rma is not an option b/c I've exceeded 30days, so I have no choice but to do everything possible to get it up and running.
Based on your experience, I think I can rule out a defective mobo as the problem and focus on configuring the settings.
Thanks again.
