1.1.1	I have a wireless internet cable connection and one router that was supplied from the cable company .	St
1.1.2	I just got a new laptop with 54g 802.11a/b/g and bluetooth enabled network card in my laptop .	St
1.1.3	The cable company wants to charge me $ 50 more to connect my laptop to my existing network .	St
1.1.4	If I try to connect my laptop to my own wireless network , it asks for a network id which I do n't have .	St
1.1.5	Is there anyway I can get this setup without having to dish out another $ 50 to my cable company ?	Ques
1.2.1	We should be able to save you $ 50 in these forums .	St
1.2.2	Specifically , what hardware did the Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) provide ?	Ques
1.2.3	- cable modem ( one device ) - cable modem and router ( two separate devices ) - combined cable modem-router ( one device ) Please tell us the make & model number of the hardware that the ISP gave you .	St
1.2.4	You say you have your & quot ; own wireless network. & quot ; Does that mean that you already own a wireless router ( other than that which the ISP provided ) ?	Ques
1.3.1	I have a router/cable modem combo provided by the cable company .	St
1.3.2	It 's a Netgear Wireless Cable Modem Gateway CG814WG .	St
1.3.3	I do n't have my own wireless router .	St
1.3.4	I am able to see my own wireless network on my laptop , but I am not able to connect to it since it wants a WAP network id number and I do n't know what that is .	St
1.3.5	Thanks in advance	St
1.4.1	The Netgear CG814WG is listed on Netgear.com as a combination ''cable modem gateway '' and says you need to contact your ISP for support .	St
1.4.2	http : //kbserver.netgear.com/products/CG814WG.asp If your ISP configured the CG814WG , they should have given you all the information you need to connect ( SSID name , password , etc . ) .	St
1.4.3	When you contacted your ISP , what did they tell you when you asked them what the ''WAP network ID number '' is ?	Ques
1.4.4	If it is asking for a password when you try to connect , you should be able to learn what it is by going to the router 's administration page .	St
1.4.5	If this router was configured by your ISP , they should be able to tell you the password without charging you .	St
1.5.1	Try looking around your ISP 's website for help & support links or a FAQ page .	St
1.5.2	What is your ISP ?	Ques
1.6.1	The Lap top was able to dedect the Network .	St
1.6.2	That is good .	Polite
1.6.3	If I have not misunderstood you , for the Network ID , try entering ''default '' ( without the quotes ) .	St
1.6.4	If that does not work , then you need to go into the gateway of the router via its IP address http : //xxx.xxx.x.x .	St
1.6.5	etc .	St
1.6.6	( supplied ) , then look in , e.g .	St
1.6.7	the wireless section for the Network ID ( SSID ) -where to look depends on the make/model of the router .	St
1.6.8	Note that this ID can be changed .	St
1.6.9	The gateway address can also be found by Run & gt ; cmd -- & gt ; ipconfig /all .	St
1.6.10	Furhter note that it seems that the ''SSID broadcast '' at the router may have been turned off , ( actually wise to do so ) as otherwise , your Laptop should have been able to connect automatically once it has detect the Network .	St
1.6.11	Further note that it may be better to disable the bluetooth if it is not needed .	St
1.6.12	( If the above works , please send the $ 50.00 to your favorite charity ! )	Sug
1.7.1	since it wants a WAP network id Can you provide the full message ?	Ques
1.7.2	But I do not understand - why WAP for a Laptop ?	Ques
1.7.3	WAP is for mobile wireless devices such as PDA , smart phones ... Maybe I am missing something ?	Ques
1.8.1	Dude you need to check if you have admin rights to your modem / router .	St
1.8.2	try accessing the box by opening a browser and typing 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.1.0 .	Sug
1.8.3	This should give you access to your box .	St
1.8.4	The screen will request a username and password .	St
1.8.5	The typical user name is admin / administrator and the password could be 12345 or admin .	St
1.8.6	If you cant get past this page hard luck ! ! !	St
1.8.7	you probably will have to end up shelling out the cash .	St
1.8.8	If you can , please check to see if the DHCP mode is on .	Sug
1.8.9	this will automatically assign a LAN IP to your laptop and your in business ! ! ! ..	St
1.8.10	If this netgear box does not support NAT and DHCP it probably means that the provider assigns a address to your machine .	St
1.8.11	If you want to test this go n/w properties on your machine and look for the IP address .	St
1.8.12	If the address is automatically assigned then your box should have DHCP .	St
1.8.13	If there is assigned address ( say 192.168.1.2 ) then change it to 192.168.1.3 or 1.4 and see if you can still access .	St
1.8.14	If you can then assign this new add to your laptop .	St
1.8.15	Once more your in business ! ! ! ! !	St
1.8.16	If your still denied access it could be due to a MAC list restriction .	St
1.8.17	So add your laptops wifi MAC to the access list .	St
1.8.18	( Note you can do this from your existing machine while your new laptop is on and the wifi mode is enabled ) .	St
1.8.19	enabling this feature is a great security feature as an add on benifit .	St
1.8.20	There is one more small trick that the netgear box has .	St
1.8.21	It allows for secure access by setting up a PKN enabled password for accessing the n/w .	St
1.8.22	If this feature is on you should be prompted for a password to access the wireless n/w .	St
1.8.23	if your not prompted it means that this feature is not enabled .	St
1.8.24	If it is enabled and you have admin rights to your box then you could change the password to suit your convenience or disable the function .	Sug
1.8.25	If all of this dosent work have to say I am beaten , but try to figure out what your SP does and do let me know	St
