It also has a Local Area Connection Broadcom 440x 10/100 which is currently disconnected. My desktop has a 1394 Net Adaptor and also a Local Area Connection 2 3com gigabit NIC It is also connected to a Linksy router by an ethernet cable which in turn is connected to a DSL modem, also by an ethernet cable. Now, I have no trouble accessing the internet, but everytime I try to run the &quot;set-up network wizard&quot; it stops in middle and tells me something is wrong and it wont say what. Furthermore, I created a shared files folder on my laptop, which APPEARED in the Network places folder on my Desktop, but wouldn't let me access it, saying that it didn't really exist. Any ideas?

It says: &quot;A network cable is unplugged.&quot; Well, what cable is it talking about? and where would I plug it in? and while I'm at it, what is a network key?

An unplugged Network cable message is just that, the NIC does not see a cable attached to it. Which in your case seems right for the laptop not having a cable plugged in.
