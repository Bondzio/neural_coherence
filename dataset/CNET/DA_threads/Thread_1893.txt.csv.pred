1.3.1	the 9800gt will be fine at 1680x1050 ( or lower ) for those games .	St
1.3.2	but if you 're using a 24 & quot ; monitor ( 1920x1280 ) or larger , you 'll need a beefier video card like a radeon hd4870 or geforce gtx260 .	St
1.4.1	I am intending on running this on a 22inch monitor so I think that should be fine .	St
1.4.2	Do the memory and processor look beefy enough for these games ?	Ques
