<s> I need help finding pricing for systems, the RAM amount used when the systems first appeared. </s>
<s> The table below is what I am trying to comoplete. </s>
<s> Excel does not paste well into this format. </s>
<s> Is there a site that has pricing and RAM for a 1989 486dx 50 MHz machine? </s>
<s> Thanks, astiller Year </s>
<s> More than likely those systems used 30 Simms Ram as my 486DX4-100 unit took 78 Simms Ram. </s>
<s> I worked on a number of 486 units with the 30 Simms Ram (just threw out a whole slew of them two weeks ago, btw) and 8MB ran over $30 per stick and had to be purchased as EDO/pairs by 1994. </s>
<s> I don't know the original price in 1989, but assume it was much higher at that time because the 78 Simms was priced about the same $30 by 1994. </s>
<s> TONI </s>
<s> PA in Sept 1994 its new computer had FOUR megabytes of RAM. </s>
<s> Accounting program [Peachtree] wouldn't run. </s>
<s> Added 4 MB for $200. </s>
