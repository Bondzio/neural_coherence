has everybody read this?
bob, this should be posted in huge print at the top of the page, next to &quot;networking and wireless forum&quot;.
this is what i've been talking about.
with wireless, you have no idea who is using your network.
it uses airwaves and you have no control over who receives that signal.
that's why corporations are staying away from wifi.
even an encrypted signal is not very secure.
now &quot;dweebe&quot;, as far as your post, i will make no bones about it.
you asked the question, &quot;i already use zone alarm for my firewall but was wondering what i should do?&quot;.
it's simple, really.
quit using someone else's wireless connection.
anyone helping you with any other advice is &quot;aiding and abetting a felon&quot;.
what you are doing is illegal, and i hope they catch your butt and throw it in prison for a while to give you time to think about what you are doing.
there are federal laws governing usage of wireless connections, and you are violating them.
check with the fcc and see how many they have prosecuted already.
maybe you'll be next.
