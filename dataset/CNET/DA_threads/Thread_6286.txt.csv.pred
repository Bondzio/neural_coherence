1.1.1	Hello All , I just started collecting and buying parts to build a PC .	St
1.1.2	I want to take your opinion on what type of processor I should get .	St
1.1.3	I am looking for a GREAT performance processor .	St
1.1.4	I will be doing moderate work and multitasking .	St
1.1.5	I am not big on gaming , so I do not want processor that will make me go broke .	St
1.1.6	Any recommendations will be great Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	... then we can eliminate the fastest ( and most expensive ) CPU 's .	St
1.2.2	You may not even need a quad core processor if you 're only doing multitasking and work - so long as none of that work involves intensive calculations ; e.g. , video and audio file processing .	St
1.2.3	Given that , I 'd recommend one of the midrange Intel or AMD processors .	St
1.2.4	Intel CPU 's tend to be faster at a given range than AMD , but AMD CPU 's tend to be less expensive at a given performance level .	St
1.2.5	Try the manufacturers ' websites , as they both offer tools to choose the right CPU for you .	St
1.2.6	http : //www.intel.com ( click on & quot ; Play - Intel for consumers , & quot ; then & quot ; Find the right processor. & quot ; ) http : //www.amd.com ( click on & quot ; At Home & quot ; , then select & quot ; Help Me Decide & quot ; under the & quot ; Tools & quot ; heading on the right side of the page . )	St
1.2.7	When you 've narrowed the choice down , then start searching online vendors as well as local brick and mortar vendors in your area for prices .	St
1.2.8	Two notes : 1 ) You do n't say what operating system you 'll be using , but I 'd recommend that you get 3 GB RAM .	St
1.2.9	3 GB RAM is the best amount if you 'll be using Vista , and it certainly would n't hurt in an XP system .	St
1.2.10	2 ) Remember that a choice of CPU immediately dictates what motherboards you can use ; make sure that the mobo you choose has the features that you 'll need and that the CPU will support those features ( usually not a problem ) .	St
1.2.11	Hope this helps , Paul	St
1.3.1	You were a great help , THANK YOU !	St
1.4.1	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx ? Submit=ENE & N=2010340343 % 201050722265 & bop=And & Order=PRICE the e7300 is a great processor for $ 125 and e7400 is $ 140 .	St
1.4.2	the 3ghz e8400 is $ 170 and will give you top-notch performance .	St
1.4.3	( it 's as fast as last year 's $ 900 extreme processors . )	St
1.5.1	My computing needs are , I think , very similar to yours , so let me fill you in on the machine I bought when my ancient PC finally gave up the ghost .	St
1.5.2	Now , I bought , not built , but it might give you an idea of what I was saying .	St
1.5.3	Gateway GT5654 AMD Athlon Dual Core 5000+ ( 2.60 GHz actual clock speed ) 3GB RAM 300 gig SATA hard drive DVD-RW drive Multiple format card reader Windows Vista Home Premium All I 've added to it is a 320 gig hard drive , a second DVD-RW drive and a Creative sound card to replace the onboard audio .	St
1.5.4	I 'm considering adding a midrange Nvidia video card , but have n't decided whether I really want to do that .	St
1.5.5	I web surf , do word processing/spreadsheets , watch video and listen to music and other routine tasks .	St
1.5.6	With a cable broadband connection , the machine 's plenty fast for me ...	St
