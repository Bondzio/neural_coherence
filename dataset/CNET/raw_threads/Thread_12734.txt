I have minimal experience with capturing with this little handheld. Anyways, I have some footage of my proposal of the hard drive on the camera and use Final Cut Studio 2 to do some hobby editing. How can I capture the footage from the Sony HDR SR1 into Final Cut Pro 6? Thank You and hope to hear from you soon.

Would have been nice had you told us what you had done so far to import the video. With FCS2, one would assume that you were used to this sort of thing. Note: If there are any still pictures on that camera drive, you will not be able to import the video. Save the pictures, delete and then import. P
