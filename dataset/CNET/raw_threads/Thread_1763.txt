The first is that you'll have the same issue later since Windows can't understand the Apple drive format. Yes there is software to add this and yes we could boot a Live Linux CD to copy files over but this ignores the biggest issue of them all. Ready? The biggest issue is this is not a backup. It's a copy. The forums are full of folk that &quot;backed up&quot; onto one lone drive and then something happened. This is not backup. I'm going to stop writing and let that sink in and CHANGE THE SUBJECT. -&gt; OK how would I tackle this without adding an Apple file system driver? Many ways. 1. I'd get some USB memory stick to copy files on and then on the Apple copy those to the HDD. 2. I'd use my DropBox or Google Drive to save files and then on the Apple copy those to the HDD. Bob
