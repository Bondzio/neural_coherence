Support emachine link: http://www.e4me.com/support/product_support.html?cat=Desktops&subcat=W-Series&model=W3107 It doesn't show info on a dual-core upgrade. Follow the upgrade link and see if it does, but I thought it. As an AMD cpu and socket provided. good luck -----Willy &quot;0

6164	4	291678	2753067	2752980	Willy	4/16/08 5:12 PM	1.20836592E12	Seek that link	I can only *assume* you're talking about a &quot;overdrive kit&quot; type of thing. I don't recall such an item, it's probably cheaper(maybe) to get a new mtrbd. that truly supports dual-core cpu and go from there. That way, you'll have a greater range of upgrades as its needed. If you can provide that Amazon link, review it again and match it against your current system specs. Otherwise, its a dead-end for dual path, only a single core will do. Using the link I provided in the last, find the upgrade link and post a question to eMachine support and see what they may suggest. Heck, it doesn't hurt to ask. tada -----Willy
