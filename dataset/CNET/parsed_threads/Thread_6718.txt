<s> Greetings, I am interested to build a Home Theater PC and would like to know if there is a graphic cards that fit the following requirement: (1) PCI-E interface. </s>
<s> (2) HDMI output port. </s>
<s> (3) Component video (YCbCr) output port. </s>
<s> (4) Can support both Blu-ray and HD-DVD players. </s>
<s> I did the research and narrow down to the VisionTek X1650PRO HDMI. </s>
<s> However, I do not know if card is reliable & support of Blu-ray and HD-DVD players. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> http://www.geek.com/news/geeknews/2006Aug/gee20060814037985.htm &quot;In order for a commercial Blu-ray disc to play, you need to be able to decrypt the High-Bandwidth Content Protection (HDCP) copy protection it uses. </s>
<s> This can only be done via a DVI or an HDMI connection to a graphics card that supports HDCP decryption. </s>
<s> Currently, Sony says there are no cards that support this.&quot; Later we finally started to see a few cards but you discover you can't use most displays since they must have HDCP as well. </s>
<s> It's a minefield of issues so be sure you have return privileges if you find your selection doesn't work. </s>
<s> http://compreviews.about.com/od/general/a/HDParadox.htm covers this as well as http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/vista_cost.html tells more about the Vista angle of copy protection. </s>

<s> There will be no commercial content from the Component video (YCbCr) output port at HD resolution since that connection is not encrypted. </s>

<s> Dear Bob, Thank you for your answer, the graphic card that I had mentioned The VisionTek X1650PRO HDMI has the following description in its spec: &quot;256MB DDR2 Memory HDCP eprom onboard.&quot; That is why I interested to do more study about this graphic card. </s>
<s> However, you had mentioned another ineresting point that I did not know before about HDCP on the monitor/TV as well. </s>
<s> Did you mean that my widescreen 1080p LCD HDTV need to also support HDCP?. </s>
<s> Again, many thanks for your information. </s>
<s> Regards, Hiep Nguyen </s>
<s> But many have tried this only to discover... </s>
<s> It doesn't always work. </s>
<s> The industry is not making this &quot;easy.&quot; Bob </s>
