while it is in the original computer, by using a Knoppix CD.
Boot the Knoppix and see if you can see the files on the drive.
If you have two CD drives, one a burner you may be able to save them to a CD.
If the other computer has another drive already in it, then plug the old drive in another SATA port.
Or try the same thing with the Knoppix CD if the drive comes up to speed using the PCI card [running, not necessarily directly useable].
