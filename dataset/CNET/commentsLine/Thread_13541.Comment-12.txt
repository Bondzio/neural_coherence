look at  that's your card in a stripped system running 317 real measured watts.
&quot;the other thing to remember is that our test system is bare minimum only a 7,200rpm sata-ii single hard drive is used without cd rom or many cooling fans.&quot; i had to reserve commenting on this till we got the memory timing out of the way but at this point i'd consider beefing up the psu as well as considering using the board and drivers they used if you can.
-&gt; today, for zero cost, try the drivers they used for the test at  or &quot;drivers: forceware 182.06, catalyst 9.2&quot; and let's get something nasty up on the table.
if you are running torrents or such, all bets are off.
