1.1.1	I have an old but working internal floppy drive that I removed from an old machine ( running DOS believe it or not ) , but for some reason it does n't work when I installed the drive on my current machine which runs Windows XP .	St
1.1.2	When I put a 3.5 disk into the floppy and try to explore content of the drive , a message pops up asking to & quot ; insert a disk into drive A & quot ; .	St
1.1.3	Initially I thought the problem was with the disk , but after putting in 3 other 3.5 disks that I knew was working , it looks like the drive is the problem .	St
1.1.4	I am trying to figure out what are some of the possible causes when such error occurs .	St
1.1.5	Any suggestion ?	Ques
1.2.1	The heads and mechanical parts get clogged .	St
1.2.2	Depending on how good you are with tools and how lucky you are as well , you might be able to fix it .	St
1.2.3	You can try a shot of canned air first .	Sug
1.2.4	If that does n't work , it 's easy enough to take the covers off of these and get inside .	St
1.2.5	You 'll see worm drive mechanism , the heads , etc .	St
1.2.6	Dust get wrapped around the worm drive but you can carefully clean it with the proper tools , solvents and lubricants such as you can get from some hardware stores .	St
1.2.7	The heads actually pinch the disk .	St
1.2.8	I doubt you can get a head cleaning disk anymore but you can use alcohol , swabs and canned air ... .very carefully ... .to try to clean them .	St
1.2.9	It 's an old drive so you 've nothing to lose but the cost of the needed cleaning supplies might just fetch you a new floppy drive .	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the information .	St
1.3.2	Now I also ponder the option of simply getting a new one for less than $ 10 ... .	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	I figure some point in time someone will ask about this .	St
1.5.2	There are basically two possible ways to plug the cable , with either of the 2 flat sides .	St
1.5.3	I actually tried both ways .	St
1.5.4	One way showed the current result , I figure it 's more likely to be the correct way , since the drive is recognized , despite the error .	St
1.5.5	With the other way of connection , when clicking floppy drive under My Computer , the entire desktop crashes .	St
1.5.6	That furthur strengthens my belief the first way is the proper way .	St
1.6.1	Too often I see cables without 'keys ' , cables where PIN 1 stripe is so faint it 's easy to miss , motherboards where PIN 1 is barely visible and I 'm not sure all floppy drives have 'cable keys ' either .	St
1.6.2	Take away the things that help the builder ensure it 's right and 'stuff ' happens .	St
1.6.3	One of the most common symptons is the floppy drive light stays on .	St
1.6.4	.	St
1.6.5	that 's a clear case the cable is reversed .	St
1.6.6	Good Luck VAPCMD	St
1.7.1	I think you may have just provided the most important piece of information so far .	St
1.7.2	With my current connection , the floppy drive light is always on , and I was wondering why .	St
1.7.3	The only problem is with other way of connecting the cable , clicking on floppy drive under My Computer crashes desktop .	St
1.7.4	I believe I should consider the possibility of a defective cable .	St
1.7.5	Now I have to figure where to get another one .	St
1.8.1	no cable key ... it could easily be reversed at the MB .	St
1.8.2	Floppy cable PIN is indicated by the stripe on the floppy cable edge ( sometimes very faint ) and must go to PIN 1 on the MB .	St
1.8.3	Sometimes the only way to tell which MB floppy connector is PIN 1 is check the system/MB manual .	St
1.8.4	You can see it from the underside of the MB but that 's usually not readily visible for most .	St
1.8.5	VAPCMD	St
