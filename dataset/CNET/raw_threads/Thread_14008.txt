I've been using my external hard drive and it has been working perfectly for the last 6 months. However, yesterday, quite suddenly, it stopped working. Plugged it into my Windows Vista computer and saw the &quot;Safely Remove Hardware&quot; icon pop up, but the drive doesn't show on My Computer... clicking on my J: shortcut link causes Windows Explorer to crash. Tried it on Windows XP, same problem occurs. Both problems are solved the minute I unplug the external hard drive without safely removing the hard drive. I also note that before my external hard drive started to malfunction, I might have accidentally disconnected it without safely removing the hard drive. I've read somewhere that this may be the cause of the problem. Is there anyway I can fix my hard drive or at least reclaim my files inside? Cheers!

While CHKDSK may work, it did corrupt a disk thoroughly so I'm a little shy to write that's the right answer but many times it did correct the issue. In closing, many externals come in FAT32 format which is easy to corrupt. Convert to NTFS as soon as possible. Bob

I managed to retrieve my files!!! Now, would it be possible to reformat my external harddrive? It's not showing up in My Computer or Disk Management (which actually crashes everytime I try to load, unless I unplug my external hard drive).
