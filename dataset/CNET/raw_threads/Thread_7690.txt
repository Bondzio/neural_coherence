3992	0	51532	613511	NR	Contemptor	12/16/04 5:18 AM	1.10317428E12	How do I find what kind of ram I need?	For a short class I recently finished, I built a new pc. The pc is AMD, and the current ram is 256 ddr pc2700 333mhz. Can I get any pc2700 ram at 333mhz, or could there be any exceptions that wouldn't work with my motherboard? (I don't really know that much about pc hardware... not sure what my motherboard is but my processor is a sempron).

I suggest you visit http://www.kingston.com for a match to your mtrbd. model and order it. BUT, offhand just about any PC2700 should work, just be sure if you can return it if it doesn't as some systems do get picky, epseically if you tweek it too much. Vendors offering PNY, Specter, or SimpleTechnology ram will also work. good luck -----Willy
