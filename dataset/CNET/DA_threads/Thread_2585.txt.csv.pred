1.1.1	I have been trying to find the source of Packet Loss between my computer and another PC IP address .	St
1.1.2	I am able to Ping and Tracert to this address all OK without any problems showing up .	St
1.1.3	However , when I use Pathping to determine if there is any packet loss along the 11 Hop route , the output information shows 100 % Loss at hops 5 through 9 , even though the target IP shows 0 % Loss .	St
1.1.4	Are the 5 routers blocking the Pathping test ?	Ques
1.1.5	Is there any way to get Pathing to work normally ?	Ques
1.1.6	Here are the results of Ping , Tracert , and Pathping : ping 24.189.11.202 Pinging 24.189.11.202 with 32 bytes of data : Reply from 24.189.11.202 : bytes=32 time=23ms TTL=118 Reply from 24.189.11.202 : bytes=32 time=22ms TTL=118 Reply from 24.189.11.202 : bytes=32 time=17ms TTL=118 Reply from 24.189.11.202 : bytes=32 time=17ms TTL=118 Ping statistics for 24.189.11.202 : Packets : Sent = 4 , Received = 4 , Lost = 0 ( 0 % loss ) , Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds : Minimum = 17ms , Maximum = 23ms , Average = 19ms tracert 24.189.11.202 Tracing route to ool-18bd0bca.dyn.optonline.net [ 24.189.11.202 ] over a maximum of 30 hops : 1 5 ms 5 ms 5 ms 10.22.152.1 2 7 ms 6 ms 5 ms vl4.aggr1.nyw.ny.rcn.net [ 209.122.64.225 ] 3 7 ms 7 ms 5 ms ge3-0.border3.nyw.ny.rcn.net [ 207.172.15.68 ] 4 6 ms 7 ms 6 ms r3-ge2-1.in.nycmny83.cv.net [ 198.32.118.17 ] 5 8 ms 6 ms 5 ms r1-srp1-1.in.nycmny83.cv.net [ 65.19.97.97 ] 6 8 ms 7 ms 7 ms 451be0a2.cst.lightpath.net [ 65.19.96.162 ] 7 15 ms 13 ms 13 ms 65.19.111.204 8 10 ms 9 ms 10 ms opti39-6.nassau.cv.net [ 167.206.39.6 ] 9 18 ms 16 ms 15 ms ubr101-ge1-0-0.cmts.soldny.cv.net [ 167.206.39.41 ] 10 17 ms 18 ms 19 ms ool-18bd0bca.dyn.optonline.net [ 24.189.11.202 ] 11 21 ms 15 ms 17 ms ool-18bd0bca.dyn.optonline.net [ 24.189.11.202 ] Trace complete .

1.2.1	The routers at those places may block ping or tracing .	St
1.2.2	If this is bothersome , then find the router owner and have them fix it .	St
1.2.3	They can refuse .	St
1.2.4	I can assure you that your PC is not causing it .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	You wrote : & quot ; If this is bothersome , then find the router owner and have them fix it. & quot ; I posted a simple technical question and expected a simple technical response .	St
1.3.2	Instead I get a facetious reply .	St
1.3.3	You surely do not expect the ISP to change their configuration for me ?	Ques
1.3.4	I would suggest that if you do not have a practical answer to a problem , do not respond at all .	St
1.3.5	This is my first experience with CNET Forums .	St
1.3.6	Needless to say I am very disappointed .	St
1.4.1	You learn from the router 's owner why they did n't respond to the route inquiry .	St
1.4.2	I hope you understand this well enough so you do n't jump off , format your PC in hopes of fixing it .	St
1.4.3	Cheers , Bob	St
