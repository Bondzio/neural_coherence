1.1.1	One of my old PCs finally died a while back , and the other day I received a replacement I ordered online , which uses Win2kPro .	St
1.1.2	Unfortunately it did n't come with a modem installed .	St
1.1.3	I installed a & quot ; NetoDragon 56k Voice Modem & quot ; , but am for some reason unable to connect to the internet using MSN 8 .	St
1.1.4	I installed MSN 8 and chose & quot ; I 've already signed up & quot ; , and was immediately greeted with the following error message ; & quot ; We 're sorry , we can not sign you up for MSN because there is a problem with your computer or the MSN service .	St
1.1.5	Please try again later. & quot ; The driver for the modem is installed , and I can use the & quot ; Internet Connection Wizard & quot ; which successfully connects to the & quot ; Microsoft Internet Referral Service & quot ; , so apparently the modem is working .	St
1.1.6	I 've never had to install a modem on a computer , having had them already installed when I bought them , and thus have absolutely no idea what to do here .	St
1.1.7	Can anyone help with this problem ?	Ques
1.2.1	Note : If you 're asking for technical help , please be sure to include all your system info , including operating system , model number , and any other specifics related to the problem .	St
1.2.2	My first guess is that Windows 2000 is n't properly installed .	St
1.2.3	Try installing the latest motherboard chipset drivers .	St
1.2.4	I copied the forum note since without those details I ca n't be more specific .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Operating System : Windows 2000 Professional ( Says Windows 98SE on the case ) Model : Case says it is a & quot ; Compaq Deskpro EN & quot ; .	St
1.3.2	Under system properties it says ; System Microsoft Windows 2000 5.00.2195 Service Pack 4 Computer x86 family 6 model 8 stepping 3 AT/AT COMPATIBLE 261,552 KB RAM	St
1.4.1	Compaq make hundreds of that model line .	St
1.4.2	It 's not specific enough to find the drivers but you can try compaq.com Bob	St
1.5.1	I managed to find and download the drivers for the chipset , which had no effect .	St
1.5.2	Any other ideas ?	Ques
1.6.1	I do n't know the details of the machine so I 'm going to call it a dead modem .	St
1.6.2	Try another .	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	I had already tried three different modems , all had the same result .	St
1.7.2	But it seems there was never any problem with the modem to begin with .	St
1.7.3	After a bit of digging , I managed to find an old trial CD for a different ISP , and installed it .	St
1.7.4	It worked .	St
1.7.5	I was able to connect to the internet , and visit websites without any errors .	St
1.7.6	I used the guest sign-in feature in MSN 8 after going online , and that even worked .	St
1.7.7	Apparently the problem is on MSN 's end , not mine .	St
1.7.8	Even while connected to the internet , the sign-up wizard was saying I was offline .	St
1.7.9	Now all I have to do is hope MSN customer service does n't put me on hold and forget about me.. again .	St
1.8.1	But the forums work best when the forum notes are followed .	St
1.8.2	The make/model helps everyone give the best answers .	St
1.8.3	Bob	St
