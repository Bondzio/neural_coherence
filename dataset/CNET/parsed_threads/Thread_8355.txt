<s> For the last few days I have been recieving beep codes after POST. </s>
<s> I have phoenix bios circa year 2000 and the beep pattern consists of two short beeps without any pause in between. </s>
<s> For example: BeepBeep, w/ the 2nd immedietly following the first. </s>
<s> This beep occurence does not always occur when i boot, but happens spontaneously. </s>
<s> Sometimes, following the beeps, I get a message &quot;OS not found&quot; and the system halts. </s>
<s> Other times Win 2k just continues loading after the beeps. </s>
<s> I have checked internet resources on phoenix codes and listed codes do not match what I have personally heard. </s>
<s> Listed phoenix codes follow a pattern such as 1-3-2 or 1-3-3-2, unlike mine. </s>
<s> Interestingly, there is an AMI beep code that matches this one which signifies dying RAM. </s>
<s> Didnt phoenix buy out ami? </s>
<s> specs: generic hp pavilion phoenix bios dated year 2000 Windows 2000 sp4 128 MB RAM </s>
<s> http://www.pchell.com/hardware/beepcodes.shtml notes that for Phoenix as well. </s>
<s> You can make a boot diskette from http://www.memtest86.com and the only good result is ZERO errors after 8 hours. </s>
<s> Given the age of the machine and you noting HARD STARTING, it's either the memory, motherboard capacitors or a power supply that has seen better days (and now has less power capability.) </s>
<s> Most of these &quot;computers in a ready to use box&quot; never fitted much more Watts in the PSU than needed. </s>
<s> And as users installed another hard disk, a 3D card and more, the power supply strains. </s>
<s> Here's a link to the capacitor issue that is well noted on hard starting machines -&gt; http://www.badcaps.net/ident/ Bob </s>
