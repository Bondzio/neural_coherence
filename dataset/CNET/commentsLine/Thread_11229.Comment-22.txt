sorry, i didn't know u thought that way.
anyway, this may help... i tested how my computer would run with only the original ram installed and it has worked without problems for the last 45 minutes with 35 of those being in counter strike source.
it never restarted and never closed the game.
i am now gonna try to do the same thing with the 512 chip and see what happens.
