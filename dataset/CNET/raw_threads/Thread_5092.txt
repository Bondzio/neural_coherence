However i have had no problem with cd roms or audio disks at all. Does anyone know how to fix this problem? or if it is a problem with my computer and not actually the drive itself?

Try other players if possible like VLC media player ( www.videolan.org/vlc/ ). If it does not help , try swaping your DVD drive. I think it is your DVD drive which causing the problem. Good Luck
