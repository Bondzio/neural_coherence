Often people wait until the disk is too full to do it and there is not enough available to complete the task. If you have some big files you can back up, do so, delete them and try again.

Whenever I try to run the defrag-either from Norton SystemWorks, or from properties under My Computer&gt;Drive C: it replies back with &quot;Drive C may not be configured properly&quot;. I try to run a complete scan disk, and it says there is no error. I am &quot;running&quot; at 59% defragmentation, and the computer is so slow, and running horribly (surprise, surprise). I am current on my AVG (antivirus), Zone Alarm (firewall), Ad-Aware, and Spy-Bot, and have resolved all those other problems. Any ideas, please?! I've no idea how to solve this problem! Thank you!
