i think i've figured out what my problem is.
since i run adsl broadband, the system seems to think that my connection should always be available.
however, i tend to turn off both my modem and computer at night.
when i start it up again, and turn the modem on, after the initial boot, my connection icons are not available.
when i restart my computer without turning the modem off... the connections are available on 2nd boot-up.
but when i restart my computer, and turn my modem on and off... the icons dissapear again.
so, i think i've learnt to make sure that my modem is on and ready for connections before my pc starts up
