to the defaults, to start over.
be aware that as you increase the speed of the memory bus you also proportionately increase the 33 mhz pci bus speed and the 66 mhz agp bus.
thus it is not easy to tell which device couldn't handle the speed change.
most overclocking of the memory bus is done 1 mhz at a time and test the system for a while after each step.
166 to 200 is simply one big step.
