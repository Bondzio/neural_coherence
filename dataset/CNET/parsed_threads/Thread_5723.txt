<s> i have this old MIDI keyboard which uses joystick port on the computer. </s>
<s> now days computers don't have the joystick port any more. </s>
<s> i have seen a few adapters online, i am not sure if they work with the midi keyboard or not can anyone recommend a good one? </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> The MIDI signals were on many older joystick ports for convenience and cost. </s>
<s> It was still MIDI and not a joystick interface. </s>
<s> So that is likely where you only need the MIDI card and cable to get it connected. </s>
<s> The joystick port is only there to confuse us. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> but the midi keyboard only has midi out, it doesn't have midi in. </s>
<s> so i think that i still need to buy one of those game port converter. </s>
<s> isn't that right? </s>
<s> MIDI signals were &quot;stuck&quot; or &quot;added&quot; to game ports because it would be costly to put the then standard MIDI port onto the sound cards of the day. </s>
<s> As such there is never a need to think of this as a game port as a true game port would never have MIDI signals on it. </s>
<s> Creative Labs used what we called a &quot;15-pin MIDI/Joystick multiport,&quot; Those adapters simply had the connections and connectors required to connect the MIDI signals. </s>
<s> Now back to your Keyboard with MIDI out. </s>
<s> Interesting unit so you can't send it MIDI commands. </s>
<s> Most folk want the keyboard to play MIDI and now just send it. </s>
<s> Maybe this is something to consider? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> you obviously know more than i do. </s>
<s> but i just want to make this midi keyboard to work. </s>
<s> i don't have a picture with me right now. </s>
<s> but if i remembered it clearly, it has a game port /joystick port output, then a midi in or out which i kind of forgot. </s>
<s> it only has one midi outlet. </s>
<s> so what should i get? </s>
<s> the regular game port converter or are you saying that i can get a midi coverter in order to play this keyboard on my current computer? </s>
<s> A game port would not have MIDI. </s>
<s> I attempted to explain the history where Creative Labs add the MIDI signals to the 15 pin Game Multi port yet you ask for a game port to MIDI converter. </s>
<s> Since a game port has no signals we can use to talk MIDI, a converter is not possible. </s>
<s> Please add a MIDI port or if your game port has MIDI (remember Multi port?) </s>
<s> then get the cable you need. </s>
<s> ==&gt;&gt; Remember that I can't recommend any card or cable because I can't find what machines and MIDI keyboards are in play. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> http://imageshack.us/f/542/0000047.jpg here is a picture of the midi keyboard. </s>
<s> I remember those units. </s>
<s> That COMPUTER connection was so it could be controlled by same and the MIDI out was not only for output from the keyboard but to control down stream instruments. </s>
<s> I'm sorry but I thought you were a MIDI aficionado and only was in need of getting your gear up and running again after a change of machines. </s>
<s> After all this I'm beginning to thing this is your first MIDI setup. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> The picture helps but when we get right down to it, make, model, age, manuals, etc. </s>
