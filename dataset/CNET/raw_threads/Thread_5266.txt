The navigation software I'm using require a resolution of minimum 800 x 600 pixels. I have tried to &quot;cheat&quot; the software by changing the resolution after I have started the software. But then it is not possible to see the whole screen picture. I have Windows XP. Is there a software or a hardware that can solve this problem

Let me know if it works. Peter

It will be truly odd to some and you may not realize what a RUBE GOLDBERG solution it is. I am not offering any support to make it work, but offer it as a possible wild end run around the issue. Bob
