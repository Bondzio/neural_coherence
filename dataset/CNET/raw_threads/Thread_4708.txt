I am not familiar with partitioning at all so I was wondering if I can get my capacity back up to 750 gigs as opposed to the 192 gigs I have now while keeping it formatted to use with my xbox360. It is Fat32 file system. otherwise, how do i delete the partition so i can use the rest of my hard drive space? thanx

I also looked on the help section of CompuApps SwissKnife V3 and it says I have to press the &quot;spin&quot; button to change the size, but I cannot find this button. Anyone have maybe a different program that worked for them in the same situation or are familiar with CompuApps SwissKnife V3 in order to let me know how to get my capacity back to 750 gigs? thanx

I know I can create more than one partition, but since I am not as knowledgeable about partitioning as I would like, I do not know how to navigate between partitions so I was wondering if I could create a single partition of around 700 gigs = 716800 mb's. Again, I am only doing this so I can use my hard drive on my XBOX360 and am only storing video, music, pic. files on it which is why I do not want to have multiple partitions. I have CompuApps SwissKnife V3 and it will only allow me up to 192 gigs of space in a single partition on either a Fat32 or NFTS file type, but I know these types are capable of up to 1-2 terabytes which is why I am stumped.... any help is appreciated, thanx
