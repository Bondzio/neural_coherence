whatever you get, make sure its a crosscut shredder.
the ones that just cut into narrow strips are insecure.
fry's a month or so ago had one on special, a &quot;tech ko&quot; for $15 and i got it.
works fine and while i have never tried a cd, it does fine on a credit card.
i am not sure it can take a whole cc offer unopened though as its rated 5 sheets at a time and the envelope plus 1 folded page whould be 5 thicknesses.
i don't bother shredding the whole cc offer, just the one page you return to get the card which is usually the one page with my name/address on it.
the rest goes in my paper recycle box.
