1.1.1	I am running a new machine with the following components : MSI A55M-P33 motherboard AMD A6 5400K processor Radeon HD7770 graphics card with monitor plugged into DVI port 2x Crucial Ballistix Sport 4GB memory ( Memory Model BLS4G3D1339DS1S00 ) WD15EARS-FR 1.5TB hard drive Thermaltake TR2 600W PSU I am getting no video signal , and no beeps .	St
1.1.2	I ca n't tell if the BIOS is starting , since I ca n't see anything .	St
1.1.3	Everything seems to be plugged in correctly , and everything powers on .	St
1.1.4	I 've tested the video card and monitor ( and using the same PSU and hard drive ) with another motherboard ( ASUS M3A76-CM with AMD Phenom 9600 processor and 1x KVR800D2N6/2G memory ) , and it works just fine .	St
1.1.5	I 've also tried with no video card ( plugging directly onto the VGA port on the motherboard ) , and with only one stick of RAM , and still get nothing .	St
1.1.6	I had this same problem before , and requested a replacement A55M-P33 motherboard , but am having the same issue with the new one .	St
1.1.7	Is this one defective as well , or am I missing something ?	Ques
1.2.1	With no new video card , you plug-in the power connection for video at mtrbd. , notably the P4 connection from PSU .	St
1.2.2	Use a VGA type connection for monitor and on-board video should have a display .	St
1.2.3	If no display , then either the mtrbd .	St
1.2.4	or PSU power lead for video is bad .	St
1.2.5	You can reset the bios to defaults using the CMOS clearing so it can be at basics , just to have some display .	St
1.2.6	If no display , then something is amiss , on what depends on your knowing if all connections are proper .	St
1.2.7	The video P4 connection is n't the same as direct video card connections , so be careful or review your manual or guide for new video card .	St
1.2.8	It should beep in protest is something is amiss , so be sure the spkr .	St
1.2.9	is working too and/or connected right if not using an on-board spkr.. tada -- -- -Willy	St
