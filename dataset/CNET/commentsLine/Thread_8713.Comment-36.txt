i made the mistake of not making it clear once.
if you can remove 99% of the dust in a half hour, don't spend an additional 7, 8, or 12 hours trying to get out the last 1%.
i had one friend who had his computer shut down for a couple of days while he attempted to get out every little particle of dust.
i had to come and reassemble his computer for him because he thought that any dust was a problem.
i was sure that within a few weeks it would accumulate more dust than was left after the first half hour of cleaning.
