<s> I am using this Lenovo PC for some 2 years now. </s>
<s> The specs are as follows: Intel Celeron CPU Speed 2.66 GHZ Ram 1.27 GB MS OS SP2 Bios Type Phoenix-Award V6.00PG Bios Updated on 11/10/06 Bios ID Grantsdale 6a 79DFKJC-00 At times when I boot up the pc, I would hear 2 beeps and CMOS Checksum Error appears. </s>
<s> Then I have to press F1 and reset the date/time and press F10 when I am done. </s>
<s> The PC then boots up normally. </s>
<s> The next time when I boot up again after switching on the power, the same thing happens. </s>
<s> The date goes back to 1/1/2003 and time is 0:0:0. </s>
<s> I have to reset this again. </s>
<s> I have tried changing to a new CPU battery but the problem still remains. </s>
<s> I have not install any new hardware expect increasing the ram by another 1GB. </s>
<s> I have also tried removing the new ram card and conducted an anti-virus scan. </s>
<s> Problem still not solved. </s>
<s> And the thing that frustrates me is that this happens intermittently. </s>
<s> I have not try the jumpers yet, cause i do not know how or where the jumpers are. </s>
<s> Is it necessary to do so? </s>
<s> What would be the pros and cons to adjust the jumpers? </s>
<s> Thanks and pls HELP!!!! </s>

<s> Other causes I've found for this issue. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Type &quot;bad caps&quot; at google.com 2. </s>
<s> I fixed a few by putting in a new power supply. </s>
<s> There is some CMOS RESET or PWD RESET jumpers on boards, which I will not write at length about. </s>
<s> I use those to reset the CMOS values and then setup the values again. </s>
<s> Rarely fixes the issue. </s>
<s> Worse case issue? </s>
<s> The motherboard has failed in some odd way. </s>

<s> Hi Bob, Thanks for the advise. </s>
<s> I have tried replacing the power supply box but now the PC just wouldn't boot up. </s>
<s> The HDD LED light just kept on flashing but nothing happened. </s>
<s> So i hooked back the old power supply box and back to my old problem (CMOS Checksum Error). </s>
<s> I have also did an &quot;eye-ball&quot; check on the CAPs like you said, all seems ok. No bulgging or leaking caps. </s>
<s> Any suggestions with regards to the power box replacement? </s>
<s> Thanks SK </s>
<s> Missing a connection. </s>
<s> Many owners don't change them often and can't get the connections on proper. </s>
<s> Others will omit an ATX12V connection. </s>
<s> Sadly if a new CMOS battery doesn't cure it and you measured that battery with a volt meter to be sure it's good then the board looks to have failed. </s>

<s> Ya Bob I thick the mobo has failed me. </s>
<s> Well that goes to show that Lenovo has failed me too. </s>
<s> Just less then 2 years usage. </s>
<s> My other older Acer is already 5 years and my son is still happily playing his online games and does his homework on it. </s>
<s> Well i guess i will get a new CPU and this time i will make sure its not a Lenovo. </s>
<s> Thanks Bod for all your quick responds by the way i think this forum is cool. </s>
<s> Cheers James </s>
