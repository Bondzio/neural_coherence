the best thing to do is to check the price for a comparable laptop at the usual second-hand sites in your country.
a three year old netbook without warranty can't be worth much.
if it's the cheapest one i see it has: atom n270 processor, 512 mb, 8.9&quot; screen, 80 gb hard disk, xp home, 3 cell battery (the original one).
let's say 25 euro's.
maybe 50 but not more.
