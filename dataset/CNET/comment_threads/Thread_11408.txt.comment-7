I am using WPA2 in enterprise mode, and you are right, the vulnerability that I am talking about would be exceeding difficult to exploit, (Someone would have to do a black bag job on my residence, which isn't real likely) so I'm not overly concerned about it.
I'm just one of those folks that if I know of a security hole, I like to plug it.
