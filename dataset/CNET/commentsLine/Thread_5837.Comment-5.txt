the top exhaust fan, simply replace it with a dual ball bearing type.
that top exhaust is of huge benefits regarding cooling.
remember that heat rises.
i only use cases that have top exhaust fans, or add one for one case that i like, whose top comes off separately making it easy to cut the fan opening in the top,.
