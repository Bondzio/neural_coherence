<s> Here is my dilema, I work at a hotel, and in the lobby we have 2 television screens we use to run daily events for the conference center. </s>
<s> When I came into work there was nothing displaying on the screens. </s>
<s> When I checked the machine to verify that it was on I heard the fans running. </s>
<s> So I preformed a hard reboot. </s>
<s> The monitor displayed the screen asking me which way I wanted to re boot computer (safe mod, normally, etc.). </s>
<s> I selected safe mode, looked through my video card program (the video card we use is an ATI All-in-Wonder). </s>
<s> Everything seemed fine. </s>
<s> Than I attempted to restart in normal operating mode. </s>
<s> When I did the blue screen displayed stating it would dump physical memory. </s>
<s> After that when I start the computer the fans will run, but nothing will display on the monitor. </s>
<s> The action light on the front of monitor will blink once, and nothing else will follow. </s>
<s> What will I be needing to get this running again a new computer&quot; If so will I be able to re use the video card? </s>
<s> Any trouble shooting steps would be greatly appreciated I am at a loss for anymore things to do. </s>
<s> Turn it all off and try again in a hour. </s>
<s> If it works fine call the people who service the machine and tell them it's overheating. </s>

<s> Did so, nothing is happening again, and I also smelled a slight burnt smell. </s>
<s> Such devices are usually under a maintenance contract. </s>
<s> Look on the product for it. </s>
