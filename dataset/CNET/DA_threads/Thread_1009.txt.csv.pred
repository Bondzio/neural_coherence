1.1.1	Ok, I recently purchased a new Dell 9100, with a Pentium d 820 chip.	St
1.1.2	It came with 1Gb ram (512 x 2) PC-4200, and I bought 2 Kingston 1gb PC-4200 sticks and installed them .	St
1.1.3	When I plugged the power cord back into the computer, it suddenly made a weird sound, you know like a &quot;you just messed up&quot; sound.	St
1.1.4	Did that sound about 3 times, then stopped.	St
1.1.5	SInce then I have not been able to get the computer to even power up at all.	St
1.1.6	I've removed the new sticks, and replaced the old ones and still nothing!	St
1.1.7	I've got some important stuff on there and need to fix this quick... please help!	St
1.1.8	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	Only you will know if the installation/removal went smoothly.	St
1.2.2	One thing I have found though is that it's easy to dislodge something else when pushing/pulling things straight from the MB in that it tends to flex.	St
1.2.3	The finicky component is the video card.	St
1.2.4	Take that out and reseat it.	St
1.2.5	If it does not connect properly you can get beeps on startup.	St
1.2.6	If not that, reseat any other cards in MB slots.	St
1.2.7	Hopefully the RAM was the right type and nothing got shorted.	St
1.2.8	The fact that you get beeps means you at least have power to the MB so there might be hope.	St
