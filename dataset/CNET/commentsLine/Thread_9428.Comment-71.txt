i could not agree more with maggietoo9's little rant about vista, and will add a rant of my own.
the good folks at m$ft have proven amazingly adept at putting out new operating systems (os) full of major defects.
95 never lived up to the original hype and was soon updated with fixes that finally evolved into win98se, a decent os.
win me was so buggy that a year later they were selling a whole new os, xp.
tough luck to you if you had paid for me (either by itself or included in a system you bought approximately between the summers of 2000 and 2001. at this time xp pro (32-bit), which can be bought oem for well under $100 on e-bay, is, imho, the best os for 99% of windows users.
i like pro because i have found it to be very stable (for a windows product) and i have heard that m$ft will soon be ending support for xp home.
i guess they don't want to anger corporate customers.
of course any new computer you order from dell or other major box maker includes xp home.
you must pay a substantial amount to upgrade to pro.
i have no psysic powers, but i visualize vista (mista?
), which is coming out at least a year later than we were led to believe will be majorly imperfect.
the fact that we will initially see the os in both a 32 and 64 bit flavor will not help at all.
what a choice, 32-bit backward looking for stability and compatibility advantages, or 64-bit forward looking with more bugs and far less compatibility (remember xp when it first appeared?)
and that's all i'm going to say about that.
