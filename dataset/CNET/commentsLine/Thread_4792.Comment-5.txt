many thanks proffitt.
but note that i was just using adobe as an illustration.
i have some softwares that cost several thousands of dollars and that need to be prevented from copying but can be installed.
i would'nt mind buying the tool if available.
pls, proffitt, what do you suggest i can do?
thanks for your reply
