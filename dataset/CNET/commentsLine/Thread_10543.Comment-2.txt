yay first person to reply i feel special first if your computer is less than a year old just leave it on cable select and plug it in, your computer will set it as slave automatically, same applies if your using windows xp if your using 98 get your hard drive and adjust the little white block on the back (it's near the pin coinnectors) your hard drive should have a diagram telling you where to put the jumper (the block) for slave setting and don't worry slave drives are any slower to access than the master drive, it simply tells your computer which drive to look for the os on first, and on older computers stops the 2 hard drives using the connector cable at the same time (stops data colliding)
