1.1.1	I've build a new system using the following componets: Asus A7N8X deluxe Nforce 2 board AMD 2500+ cpu 512mb Geil PC3500 memory 120GB HDD ATI based 9800 video card cd-rom, cd-rw I've only installed XP Pro(no service packs yet), the NForce drivers for the board, video drivers.	St
1.1.2	I had used an old ps/2 scroll mouse to do the set up, now while attempting to use any optical mouse, they don't work.	St
1.1.3	Am pluging into the ps/2 mouse port on the board with a MS Trackball Optical and a MS wheelmouse Opital, both show the curser on screen but do not operate.	St
1.1.4	When pluged in the trackball does light up, the wheelmouse doesn't, it could be defective.	St
1.1.5	The optical wheelmouse is brand new, per instructions, in stalled the software first, shut down, pluged the wheelmouse in, rebooted; curser shows up, doesn't move.	St
1.1.6	Greatly appreciate any suggestion on fixing this problem.	Polite
1.2.1	an email to me earlier about this, you resolved the problem by realizing you had USB option for the mouse and after removing the adapter for ps/2 and booting up, it now works.	St
1.2.2	Good job.	St
1.2.3	TONI	St
1.3.1	check your bios to make sure you have USB enabled for the mouse so it will work in all situations....not just normal desktop.	Sug
1.3.2	It should already default to it, if I remember correctly, but I would check anyhow just to make sure.	Sug
1.3.3	TONI	St
1.4.1	I'm still trying to figure out why.	St
1.4.2	Thanks for the help.	St
