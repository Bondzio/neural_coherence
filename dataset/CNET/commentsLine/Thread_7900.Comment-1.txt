i need help deciding on a new agp video card, and also want to know if i should upgrade my power supply.
my computer is an xp, with a p4 2.8, 1 gig of ram, 2 drives, 1 hard drive, and a nvidia fx 5700 le video card with 128 mb of memory.
i want to update my video card, primarly to run oblivion on less than &quot;low&quot; settings with no extremely low frame-rates.
i currently have a 250 watt power supply.
i want to know if anyone can recommend a video card that meets my criteria, and is hopefully below $200.
i would also like to know if, should i upgrade to that card, if i would need to upgrade my power supply, and if so, to what.
note: when examining the insides of my pc, i saw that above the agp card slot, it said agp slot, and also said 1.5v only.
if anyone knows what this means, please share.
thanks!
