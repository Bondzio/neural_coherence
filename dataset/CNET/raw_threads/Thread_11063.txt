Its a big pin but it gets very thin where the pin connects inside the HD. I pulled the pin out of the plug, stuck it back into the hole in the HD it had come from, stuck on the connector, and prayed. When I booted up it came up fine, and I was able to complete the setup of the new HD and copy the old HD data to it. After I have given it enough time to be sure the new HD is working properly and my data is safe, I want to reformat the old HD and use it for additional storage. The question is, how reliable is that hd now? Do I need to take it somewhere to have the connector soldered back or something?

My best advice is for you to copy data onto a second internal HDD or an external. Hard drives are not expensive any more and an external drive box can be very useful for backing up or taking bulky items off your C drive. after you copy the stuff from the damaged drive throw it away and console yourself in the knowledge that you have avoided loss of your data or a very heafty recovery fee. Good luck.....Stewart

I suspected that the drive with the broken pin might go at any time. I wondered, though, about the feasibility and cost of getting the pin resoldered.

There is always some satisfaction to be gained by recovering broken gear but I think I would not put anything that I couldn't live without on that drive,Resoldered or not. However I am not noted as an optomist:-) Best regards Stewart
