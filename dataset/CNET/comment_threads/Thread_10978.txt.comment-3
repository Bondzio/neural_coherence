By power saving mode, I really meant sleep mode.
If this doesn't work, can I send a print job to the computer when it is off, or in sleep mode and then print it when I wake or turn the computer on?
I am still not even sure how I network computers so I am probably jumping the gun here- but this is the reason why i want to network- so I would want to make sure it is possible before I go through the work of trying to figure out how to network.
Thanks for your help!
