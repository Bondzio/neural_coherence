<s> when I search through the web I always see DDR memory with some numbers assigned to them. </s>
<s> For instance, 256MB DDR memory PC3200 400MHZ or PC2700 333MHZ. </s>
<s> As far as I know even the motherboards supporting 333MHZ can work with 400MHZ memory but in this case the memories will function at 333MHz thus, buying memories at a higher-than-supported speed becomes useless. </s>
<s> How can I understand whether my motherboard supports 400MHZ DDR memory? </s>
<s> describe your motherboard as in manufacturer and model# </s>
<s> The mtrbd. </s>
<s> specs are provided via the manual or the support website for your model. </s>
<s> Understand the memory mapping as sometimes certain conditions must be present. </s>
<s> In general if the mtrbd. </s>
<s> supports FSB of 333Mhz. </s>
<s> though you can install DDR PC3200/400Mhz, you can use it only at 333Mhz. </s>
<s> If the mtrbd. </s>
<s> can in fact use PC3200 at FSB of 400Mhz in may want certain memory slot(s) used only or all are supported. </s>
<s> Also, the level of the cpu class installed will determine the final setup as the mtrbd. </s>
<s> using its &quot;automode&quot; setting may pick the best overall operation or at least the safest one with lack of problem(s). </s>
<s> These mtrbds. </s>
<s> can be in most cases be &quot;manually&quot; setup to increase its operational speed but may lock-up or outright fail if pushed too far but a default mode should recover it. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
