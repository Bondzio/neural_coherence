1.1.1	I bought a used G4 and it worked OK for a bit but it used to lose the time and date .	St
1.1.2	One day , it would n't start at all , so I worked out it was probably a PRAM problem and changed the internal battery .	St
1.1.3	The new battery measures OK on my ( admittedly very basic ) meter but nothing happens when I try to power up the machine .	St
1.1.4	I have checked and there is mains voltage going to the power supply .	St
1.1.5	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.2.1	Here is a trick I have used for many years .	St
1.2.2	Remove the battery from the machine .	St
1.2.3	Remove the power plug from the machine .	St
1.2.4	Press the CUDA button ( it is on the motherboard ) , little square thing with a top that looks like a pencil eraser .	St
1.2.5	ONCE Press the Power On button on the front of the machine .	St
1.2.6	Leave the whole thing for at least 30 minutes .	St
1.2.7	Then Put the battery back in Put the power cord back in Press the Power On button on the front of the machine Sit back and enjoy the startup chime .	St
1.2.8	If this works , let me know and I 'll tell yo what we just did .	St
1.2.9	If not , tell me and we 'll start again P	St
1.3.1	Thank you so much for the advice .	St
1.3.2	I followed it carefully but I 'm afraid it did n't work for me .	St
1.3.3	The machine still shows no sign of life .	St
1.3.4	I appreciate your input ,	Polite
1.4.1	Well that rules out a PRAM problem then .	St
1.4.2	What we did there was to totally reset the logic board ( Motherboard ) Removing the battery and the power cord removed all sources of power .	St
1.4.3	Pushing the & quot ; ON & quot ; button discharged the capacitor the kickstarts the power supply .	St
1.4.4	By leaving it for 30 mins , all vestiges of power were drained from the machine .	St
1.4.5	99 out of 100 , this works and the machine bursts back into life .	St
1.4.6	Sorry for you being # 100 .	St
1.4.7	If nothing happened at all , I would suspect , first , the Power Supply .	St
1.4.8	There are ways to test this ATX type power supply but the normal step is to replace it and see if that was the problem .	St
1.4.9	Unfortunately , this is an Apple part so a regular ATX power supply is not going to fit .	St
1.4.10	Are you absolutely sure that there are no lights at all on the logic board after you push the on button ?	Ques
1.4.11	It 's quite safe to have the door down when you are doing this .	St
1.4.12	Just watch the cat and the coffee !	St
1.4.13	This may sound redundant , but , make sure that all the connectors to the logic board are seated well .	St
1.4.14	Disconnect them and put them back .	St
1.4.15	Power cord out for this step .	St
1.4.16	Remove any extra RAM that you have installed , ditto any extra hardware .	St
1.4.17	The only thing plugged in should be the keyboard , mouse , monitor and power cord .	St
1.4.18	Try to power up .	St
1.4.19	If you have a friend with a working G4 , beg , borrow or steal their power supply .	St
1.4.20	Purely for diagnostics , you understand .	St
1.4.21	Good Luck P	St
1.5.1	Thank you again for the input .	St
1.5.2	Knowing what the procedure is doing is extremely helpful , as is advice on what else I can try .	St
1.5.3	I do have access to an almost identical G4 , so swapping the power supplies would be possible .	St
1.5.4	Before I do that , I 'm wondering if I 'm simply not following your instructions correctly .	St
1.5.5	When I opened up the G4 again , there was a little red LED glowing , which suggests the motherboard is getting at least some power .	St
1.5.6	Is it safe to repeat the procedure ?	Ques
1.5.7	( You said to push the button on the board only once . )	St
1.5.8	I 'm wondering if I have correctly identified the button .	St
1.5.9	The thing I am looking at is above the positive connection for the battery , about 1/4 inch square metal casing with a round button about the size of an artificial sweetner .	St
1.5.10	However , there was nothing about its action to suggest that it was a button when I pushed it .	St
1.5.11	Thanks again	St
1.6.1	You are correct about the location of the CUDA button .	St
1.6.2	If you use a blunt instrument , no pointy things , to push it down , you will feel a slight give in the button .	St
1.6.3	That 's all it takes .	St
1.6.4	Push straight down and then release .	St
1.6.5	I usually use the end of a pencil to push it with .	St
1.6.6	Once is the recommended number of times as there is a theory that more than that will mess up the Firmware on the board .	St
1.6.7	This is NOT from experience , however ...	St
1.6.8	Yes , it is quite safe to repeat the procedure .	St
1.6.9	Check the battery is in the holder correctly .	St
1.6.10	I 'm sure you have already done that given the observation about the positive connection .	St
1.6.11	Go at it again and good luck P	St
1.7.1	Just where , in the Green and Pleasant land , does Mr simoncroft hail from ?	Ques
1.7.2	P	St
1.8.1	I do believe you 'll have good luck if you boot your mac and hold down command-option-p-r ( four keys ) It will chime and reboot .	St
1.8.2	After that it will boot properly , unless there 's another problem .	St
1.8.3	Any time the battery 's involved , it 's best to zap the parameter ram ( PRAM ) .	St
1.9.1	If you read the posts , you will find that removing the battery and resetting the logic board does exactly that .	St
1.9.2	P	St
1.10.1	do you have any suggestions ?	Ques
1.10.2	my laptop is completely dead .	St
1.10.3	its a G4	St
