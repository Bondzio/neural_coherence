many of the newer cpus can be oc'ed but you really need that cooling and a stable psu.
plus, the mtrbd.
must be oc friendly as well.
however, these new cpus are already pushing some limits so don't expect much maybe around 5-10% increase.
once, you go beyond that, you're in the danger zone.
visit websites that offer some insights and other links on the topic.
i provide this one, but google away for others.
i just don't know that much about the amd latest cpus as not too many users have jumped on it i know of.
of course, as cooling is important it better be darn good cooling once you push it and be happy once yu found the magic point where it won't crash or freeze.
