i decided (from some reason) to upgrade my firmware on my light-on dvdrw shm-165h6s.
i went to light-on's site and found the only firmware version there.
downloaded and installed just fine.
no problems at all.
it told me to re-boot so i did.
now after i reboot windows xp pro says it found new hardware (the light-on drive that has been installed for over a year).
i tried both options (to let windows find the driver, or me specify the location).
both ways windows doesn't find any driver.
if i try to select a driver i get &quot;dvd/cd-rom drive filter&quot; it says this driver is not digitally signed.
i still try to install it.
(after a couple of warnings that windows can't verify the driver) then it asks for pxhelp20.sys file.
i find it in my windows/system32/drivers directory and install.
then it finish and says &quot;there was a problem installing this hardware.&quot; i end up doing the same thing again next time i reboot?
any idea what i need to do?
my only worry is that i plan to re-install windows here in about two weeks.
and i need this drive to work?
my computer is a asus p800-deluxe p4 1gb of ram?
