i want to archive an image of a dvd that i made.
i know that when i write to the dvd recorder, the dvd will be written as -r or +r depending upon the media in the drive.
in the future, i want to use a dvd iso image to write to dvd's.
is the iso image of a dvd different if it was made from a -r or +r dvd?
can i just make an image from a -r dvd and then later write it back to a +r dvd?
