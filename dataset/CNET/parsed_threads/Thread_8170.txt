<s> Hi, I am experiencing a problem with my Seagate NAS BlackArmor 440 4TB. </s>
<s> I can't access any files on the device, I can see it in my network as usual also I can see the main filesystem (Public, wiki, etc.) </s>
<s> but when I click to open any of these folder message appears that device could not be accessed. </s>
<s> I checked the web interface of the NAS and I saw that DataVolume is marked as &quot;failed&quot;. </s>
<s> I really don't know how this could occured, what could be the reason. </s>
<s> I need to access my files because many of my backups are there and so other important files. </s>
<s> I ran the S.M.A.R.T. </s>
<s> test (via black armor interface) on every of the four drives and all of them passed. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> I'm working on a new entry about Windows Live and such failures. </s>
<s> Got Live? </s>
