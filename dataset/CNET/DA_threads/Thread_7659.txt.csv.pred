1.2.1	If not caused by a burnout that results in physical damage, you can just buy a new video card that fits a compatible slot and use that.	St
1.2.2	Of course you'd want to disable the on board video so it's not detected by the OS.	St
1.3.1	Alot depends on the damage.	St
1.3.2	If all damage is wholly to the video sector of the mtrbd.	St

1.3.9	This is a mute point if you can't see a display.	St
