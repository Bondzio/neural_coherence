I am using DDR2 4GB Vitesta 2 Chip which is compatible with the motherboard.
I found reviews about my motherboard that I am using and found out there is something with the GA-EP45-UD3R that makes the RAM unstable.
I used a voltage calculator on &quot; http://extreme.outervision.com/PSUEngine&quot; and put in everything I am using and found out I only need to use a 333W PSU but I have 650Ws.
thanks.
