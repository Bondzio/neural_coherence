tried to boot computer and received a nasty message saying: &quot;boot failure system halted&quot;.
bios no longer recognizes drive c. can this drive be used as a slave or is it trashed?
i would like to get some pictures out of the picture file.
i now am using a 15 gig maxtor drive from an older computer.
seems to work ok. thanks
