i bought my hp f1503 monitor 1year and 3 months ago and yesterday the screen blacked out.
i called hp customer service and was told i would need a new one, it would cost more to repair.
so the hp rep proceeded to give me a hard sell for another monitor( a refurbished one at that!
), even after i told her i just wanted to think a bit before buying another monitor.
i think i was transferred around to every hp extension when i began complaining about the monitor being just over a year old and breaking down.
i kept asking them, how can i be sure another one of their monitors would not do the same thing after just a years use?
i had the feeling i wasn't the first to complain about this monitor.
please let me know how it all turns out.
i am interested in some resolution.i am really unhappy about this and i have always used hp products!
thanks.
