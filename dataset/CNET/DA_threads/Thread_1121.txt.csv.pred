1.2.1	If your were able to connect in an unsecured state , that means the router itself has lost its wireless security settings .	St
1.2.2	It may have been due to a power problem , glitch in the hardware or malevolent action .	St
1.2.3	You did n't post the specific model Belkin , but hopefully the following will help .	St
1.2.4	I recommend resetting the router to its factory default setting using the Reset button on the device .	St
1.2.5	Then navigate to 192.168.2.1 and adjust the settings .	St
1.2.6	You may want to visit the Belkin website if you are not familiar with adjusting your router settings .	St
1.2.7	If you still have your router 's setup disk and feel more comfortable using that instead of the manual method , then try it that way .	Sug
1.3.1	I already reset it when i reset it i go into security and choose WPA PSK then enter my password then when i click apply changes my signal bar has a red X then disconnects i have to reset it every time thats the only way it connects unplugging it does n't work	St
1.4.1	I have a Belking F5D8236-4 v3	St
1.5.1	I deleted wireless profile then connected again it worked	St
