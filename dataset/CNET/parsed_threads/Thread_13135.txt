<s> Ok, I have $80 from a Graphics card I sold. </s>
<s> And I'm going to start building a new pc. </s>
<s> But I have no idea which parts to start on. </s>
<s> I am getting a 775 slot Pentium d 3.0 ghz processor and an asrock motherboard. </s>
<s> But I have this $80 and I am wondering what to spend it on. </s>
<s> Case? </s>
<s> Hard drive? </s>
<s> RAM? </s>
<s> Graphics card? </s>
<s> thanks for the advice </s>

<s> Since you needed all these things before you can build the system, so which one is first doesn't matter. </s>
<s> Save your money until you are ready because a whole computer might be cheaper than getting the parts individually. </s>
<s> Buy what you need. </s>
<s> Pay more for namebrand items and if you're not thinking it, think a darn good PSU with a high wattage rating and stable outputs. </s>
<s> You can have the best devices in the world and a cheap PSU will take it all down. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> a P4, they were overwhelmed by AMD CPU's and Intel got their butt saved when their Israli division came up with the Conroe core. </s>
<s> Save your money until you can get a Core 2 Duo [Conroe core].It out performs the P4's and only consumes 65 Watts, thus you can even live with a smaller case than needed to cool the P4. </s>
<s> im after power for money, and 1.8 dont cut it. </s>
<s> and isnt pentium d different to pentium 4? </s>
<s> clock rate to be the determinate, you have totally missed the current technology. </s>
<s> The architecture of the Core 2 Duo allows that lower clock rate to outperform the higher clock rates as Intel found when they madse their long instruction pipelines and couldn't cool them at the higher rates. </s>
