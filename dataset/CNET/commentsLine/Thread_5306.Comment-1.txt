i have run out of room on my laptop internal hd and am looking to get an external hd for myself.
i was told that i should probably get a 250 gb one since those are more reliable than the larger drives at this point.
i don't however know much about the differences in seek times, read times etc...nor do i know which brand to go with.
i would like to get one that is simple to set up and use, and that also comes with some kind of reliable backup program so that i can set up a backup task to run and then forget about it.
also, can you tell me about things like reliability between brands and storage sizes?
any and all information is welcome and thank you!
