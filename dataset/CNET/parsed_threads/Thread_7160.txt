<s> Hello everyone. </s>
<s> I have wifi enabled but need closer range my room and want to change my livebox location. </s>
<s> Can you suggest ways how to do it if its possible to go through a phone line? </s>
<s> Understanding correctly, you want to move your modem to another room? </s>
<s> Normally, the DSL signal is available at all telephone jacks at a premise. </s>
<s> You should be able to connect your modem to any available jack. </s>
<s> Filters are needed only on the actual telephones in your home to prevent modem noise on your voice line. </s>
<s> If your modem won't work on a needed jack, then you'll need to either work it out yourself (trace phone lines through your home) or have someone do it for you (normally a service charge involved). </s>
