Hello, I can't watch a single youtube video without experiencing a freeze.
Here is what happens during 6 minute video clip: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4x5ydW4fBM&feature=youtu.be As you see it's almost impossible to watch...
This happens occasionally in other sites too.
I remember once or twice even speedtest.net froze during the test.
Same with bigger downloads from sites - I have to pause then resume to finish downloading but file gets damaged from it.
Sometimes it downloads smoothly though ;l Torrents download with no problems.
Also, sexy videos never freeze So what's wrong with my internet?
Changing browsers or anti virus didn't make any difference ;l maybe I should configure router in some specific way?
Specs: Win7 64bit newest updates Gygabite P61-USB3-B3 Intel i3-2120 HD5670 No parts were OC'ed Please help!
