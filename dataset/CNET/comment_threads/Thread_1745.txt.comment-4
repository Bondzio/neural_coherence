I'm having problems with UPS maker and the lifetime insurance they offer.
I have a somewhat fried computer from a blackout.
I can tell you a $100-150 one will not work as a $40-50 surge protecter.
I won't but a cheap UPS again it's a waste of money.
The reason why is the cheaper UPS/battery backups do not protect from sine wave problems, although rare these can & usually occur with a blackout, brownout, or spike.
These can kill a computer chips quick.
Also cheaper UPS is not good for brownout or spikes, so if you buy a cheaper UPS you are buy a false sense of security and a fight should you get zapped.
Oh, watch the wireless in a thunderstorm lightning can get you if are close enough to a strike.
I got zapped, so good luck
