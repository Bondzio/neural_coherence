i understand that.
but seeing a whole drivers page on hauppauge's site makes it look atleast like they are trying to continue to support it throughout the vista beta.
the drivers now automatically load in vista after installed.
i was wondering if there was anyone that might have had any luck getting it to work.
i know the hauppauge 500 is a popular card, so i figure someone out there has tried it with rc2, and was wondering if they were having the same unforunate luck i have had.
