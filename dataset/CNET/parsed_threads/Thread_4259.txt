<s> hi , in one of days when i was using of my pc , i heared some voice from case and i realized its from the my Hard disk! </s>
<s> it was like chatter! </s>
<s> when i got this voice , all thing has locked up! </s>
<s> then hanged every thing , so i got restart , but it continue it again! </s>
<s> what is the main problem with it? </s>
<s> Hard disks don't speak, generally. </s>
<s> They turn until they crash, and that's the end of their life. </s>
<s> Sometimes they start making strange noice, but that certainly isn't like chatting and voices. </s>
<s> So I think nothing is wrong with your hard disk. </s>

<s> Don't be afraid, there is not gost in your PC.. </s>
<s> I agree that HD never speaks but some motherboard does (like ASUS P4..). </s>
<s> They have a system that speak (instead of beeping) when something is wrong.. this systen could be enabled and disabled trught the BIOS configuration and it is very useful to diagnostic problems. </s>
<s> You must check your motherboard manual. </s>
<s> The important isue here is: what the voice told you? </s>
<s> It is the error report... according to that error you can identify the failure component, HDD, Video card, etc... </s>
<s> Open your system case and disconnect the HD entirely via the cables. </s>
<s> Turn-ON your PC and if the noises disappear then you know the HD is going bad or is bad. </s>
<s> If the noise appears then likely a bad fan or similar, locate noise source. </s>
<s> Now, if the HD is bad, then you need to replace it, provided you're capable. </s>
<s> If you have warranty, use it. </s>
<s> It appears if the HD is bad, it gone too far and physical damage, you probably can't recover data. </s>
<s> If the noise is elsewhere, repair that, then retry powering-ON system and check results. </s>
<s> Also, take notice of any heat build-up, as that alone can cause all sorts of issues with a failing HD and anything else in the system that it finds the weakest and generally heat will cause failure. </s>
<s> So, take that into account if so found. </s>
<s> It would be a good time to clean out your system case of any dust build-up and overall clean-up. </s>
