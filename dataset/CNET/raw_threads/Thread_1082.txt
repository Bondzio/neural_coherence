It came with an 'Installation Disk' -- the retailer created a set of 'Recovery Disks' for it. What is the difference between them? When would I use each of them? Do either contain Windows? Thank you for your help.

You would use these for system failures and ONLY then. The store disks (usually 2 or 3 DVD'S) would/should contain the total operating system and would restore the system back to &quot;as new&quot; . The boot disk would be used IF the system failed to boot and would/could recover the system from within the system (OS). ONLY use these IF you need to, store them in a safe location as a just in case.

Not to beleaguer it - but - wouldn't the OS disks include the boot in?? If (and I hope I never do) need the boot disc -- wouldn't I need to follow it with the OS discs? Thank you for your help.
