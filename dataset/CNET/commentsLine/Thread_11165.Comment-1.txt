i have a coworker that is running win 2000, and uses aol dial-up.
as soon as he get online, his entire system locks up.
ctrl-alt-del does not help as he has to unplug his system to reboot.
we updated his video drivers (ati radeon 9200 se), used ad-aware to get rid of the sypware, ran norton win doctor, did all the windows updates.
any suggestions?
thanks.
