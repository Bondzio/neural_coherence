1.1.1	I'm running a wireless network for 3 computers (2 XP and one Me) and all 3 computers are able to access the internet via the wireless router.	St
1.1.2	However, I haven't been able to setup a working home network for sharing files, etc.	St
1.1.3	I've made several attempts to use the MS XP software (Setup home or office network) to setup a network without success.	St
1.1.4	I wondering if anyone can recommend a reasonable software package that would support XP and ME in setting up a home network.	St
1.1.5	I DON'T want to upgrade the ME computer to XP because of hardware issues.	St
1.2.1	Nearly 100% of the time I find a firewall in place.	St
1.2.2	It's working and the disable in ZoneAlarm doesn't turn it off.	St
1.2.3	Then you have IFC to contend with as well.	St
1.2.4	http://www.practicallynetworked.com/qa/qa20040212.shtml notes some other points.	St
1.2.5	Best of luck, and I can network just fine with Windows 98/ME/2000/XP and Linux, so it's not these OSes that are the issue.	St
