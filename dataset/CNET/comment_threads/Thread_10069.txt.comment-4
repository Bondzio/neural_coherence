Again, I'm trying to decide between the X2 4800 and the FX-60.
Both are dual core, and when looking at specs, except for processor speed 2.4 and 2.6 ghz they appear identical.
Could someone explain what the difference is.
For clarification, both are Toledo, both are 1.3-1.4volt, both are 90nm, both L1 and L2 Cache are identical, I mean what is the difference?
I'm on the fence, leaning towards X2 only because it's cheaper.
