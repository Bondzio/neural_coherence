I want to hookup the PS2 to the internet for online gaming, but not sure how to get it connected. I was thinking about purchasing the Linksys WTR54GS Wireless-G Travel Router so I can just plug it in downstairs and hook it up to the PS2. Just a thought though. Note: I had the same WTR54G travel router before, but took it back, cause I couldn't get it working. But I think I just didn't know how to use it. I thought you could just plug it in and roam around but didnt know you had to plug a cat5 cable to it to actually get on the network first then roam. Thanks
