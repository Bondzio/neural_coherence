bob, had to take an end run.
wouldn't let me post further in that last one.
i'll give the cable disconnect a try and make a trip to radio shack tomorrow and see if i can find an inexpensive set of headphones suitable for the pc.
maybe the koss headphones need a little more output power.
i'll let you know.
