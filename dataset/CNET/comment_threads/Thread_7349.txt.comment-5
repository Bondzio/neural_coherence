My load temp on both air and cooling is 61C 2which is hot for a phenom II.
I am using an OCZ Hydroflow CPUblock, a Swiftech 120mm fan, and my pump is a DangerDen CPX Pro.
My old air cooler was a Coolermaster Hyper 212 Plus.
I don't think it is the connection to the waterblock because it feels hot which would imply that heat is being transferred.
