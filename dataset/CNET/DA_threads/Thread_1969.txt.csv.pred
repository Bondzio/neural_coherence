1.1.1	I am using Trendnet wireless router TEW-631BRP and Trendnet pc card TEW-621PC on a brand new laptop running Windows XP .	St
1.1.2	I turned on WPA2-PSK and am running ZoneAlarm security suite .	St
1.1.3	After reading the forum posts I have checked for firmware upgrades and driver upgrades .	St
1.1.4	The problem I am having is the connection holds for a few minutes and then drops completely .	St
1.1.5	It forces me to find the network and sign in again with a password- only to be dropped 5 minutes later again .	St
1.1.6	If anyone can help would be appreciated !	Ques
1.2.1	Some drivers start doing this as the owner & quot ; secures & quot ; their network .	St
1.2.2	While one can argue & quot ; it should work & quot ; I find it easier to & quot ; go with what works. & quot ; I 'll enable SSID and start with other security methods .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	SSID broadcasting is on	St
1.4.1	To be specific- what is happening is the wireless connection works great for 5 to 10 minutes and then gets dropped , but it 's important to note that the computer still shows & quot ; connected & quot ; with excellent signal strength .	St
1.4.2	Sometimes it starts working again a minute or so later , or I have to go into network connections to disable the connection and then enable it again .	St
1.4.3	Any help here please ?	Ques
1.5.1	I 'd return them .	St
1.5.2	Bob	St
1.6.1	Trendnet just returned an email I sent them .	St
1.6.2	They think the problem is being caused by interference and asked me to change the channel .	St
1.6.3	It is currently on the default channel 6 but can not figure out how to change it .	St
1.6.4	The user manual does not seem to show how .	St
1.6.5	Do you think this is a realistic solution ?	Ques
1.6.6	and any idea how to change it ?	Ques
1.6.7	thanks for the help Bob .	Polite
1.7.1	fish around .	St
1.7.2	So far all of them have the word & quot ; channel & quot ; and the numbers 1 to 6 .	St
1.7.3	I try 1 or 11 when I think of interference .	St
1.7.4	Firmware for routers is another area we see that need updating even on new out of the box routers .	St
1.7.5	We all wish they would n't ship it with out of date firmware .	St
1.7.6	Bob	St
1.8.1	i checked that first after reading all the posts in the forum .	St
