I am using a Dell Deminsion 8100-Pentium 4--60GB Ultra ATA Hard Drive.
Recently the hard drive is clicking loudly, occassionly, first 1X-then 2-3X, while the drive is clicking the OS freezes up, nothing works, then after a 'whizz noise' it continues back to working.
I've used every system check, scan-disk, defrag, and the only info it shows in &quot;Complete-defrag&quot; that there 'may' be physical damage to my hard-drive.
But then it may work for days and the error will not show up, then the next time I turn it on, there it is again.
I took the front case off to be sure it is the hard drive 'clicking', it is for sure.
Should I go ahead and replace the hard-drive or wait for it to shut-down completely, second, I have an external 120 gig hard drive-how can I do a complete Drive C backup to this external drive for the install of the new hard drive?
