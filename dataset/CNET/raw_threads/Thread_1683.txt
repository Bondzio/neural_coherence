The GMA3000 is an integrated card I think and so at higher resolutions it needs more memory which isn't available. One solution to try first is to increase the memory to a gigabyte of RAM and see how well that solves some things. The better one is to see if that mobo supports a PCI-e card and if so then look at getting something like a 7000 series nVidia GeForce card or you could look at some of the mid to upper ATI cards for another idea.

By using system memory this may not be how 3d games like to work would be another way to put this. Just because it is a new series doesn't mean it breaks the benchmarks. If it is intended to be a budget graphics solution which I suspect it is then the answer lies in looking to see if the motherboard has a PCI-e slot or possibly AGP if there isn't a PCI-e slot and look for a good card in that type. Generally cards from nVidia and ATI are used for graphics rather than Intel which is known more for CPUs than anything else. Regards, JB

Even the lower-end cards should knock the socks off of integrated graphics.
