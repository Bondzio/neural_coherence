1.2.1	The trip to HP resulted in a dead laptop .	St
1.2.2	I 'd return both products quickly and go shopping .	St

1.3.1	http : //support.microsoft.com/kb/2764302/EN tells about a Microsoft hotfix that *might* solve the problem .	St
1.3.2	But maybe it 's better to contact HP Customer Service first and ask if it 's a known problem and they have updated driver available .	St
