I've now installed two 1394 PCI cards, and either allows seeing video, running camcorder start, rewind, but as I press &quot;Record&quot; the screen goes blank and the error message says I need to configure my capture device.Device mgr says all is well.
I'm using MS Movie Maker.
Panasonic is no help.
Any idea what to do next?
