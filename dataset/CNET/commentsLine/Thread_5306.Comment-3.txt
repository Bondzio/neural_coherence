can you backup your data to dvds ?
what's the basis for '250gb drives are more reliable than the bigger ones' ?
best of my knowledge the 250gb 2.5&quot; laptop drive are brand new and have no real life reliability to report.
best bang for the buck (gb) are the 3.5&quot; 7,200rpm hdds with 3 or 5 year warranties.
you pick the enclosure of choice and install the drive.
most of the prebuilt externals have only one year warranty.
you can get a 500gb for about $110.
before you buy and put all your data on an external ...read the posts in storage forum.
lots of hiccups with external hdds.
