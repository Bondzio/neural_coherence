I have a set of Logitech speakers that came with a subwoofer but the wire to the &quot;Right&quot; speaker got cut, so I am only using the &quot;Left&quot; and the subwoofer. Many off my songs have separate left and right stereo audio tracks but because the right speaker is gone I can't hear them. Is there any software change or program I can download to have windows merge the left and right tracks so I hear them both out of the one speaker I have?
