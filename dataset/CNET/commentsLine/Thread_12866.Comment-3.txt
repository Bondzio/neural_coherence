yeah, it looks like it does.
i borrowed a wired optical mouse from a friend that was less than 2000 dpi just to test things out.
before i used a wireless mouse because i'm using it on a tv and across the room.
it improved the performance about a thousand times.
i've already ordered a logitech g700 (5700 dpi) and hopefully it won't fail me because it's wireless as well...
