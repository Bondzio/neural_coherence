my son decided to take apart his dell as a &quot;learning&quot; experience......including taking the cpu off the mb.
after it was put back together it won't boot into windows.
the power shuts off completely as soon as it gets past the bios screen.
the power stays on no-problem in setup mode...but it seems as soon as the cpu is used the machine shuts down.
this is a 2.4 gig intel machine.
is it possible for the cpu to cause this problem?
