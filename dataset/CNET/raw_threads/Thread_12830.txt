I have a Westell Versalink 327W from Verizon. I had to relocate it to the basement of my home. The signal that I receive on the first floor is excellent. The signal is very poor/nonexistent on the second floor. My question - is there anything that can be done to the versalink router to increase the signal that it puts out or should I purchase another router. If I need to purchase another router, what would you recommend. Thank you.

The 327w is DSL so it can't be limited to the basement. Any phone outlet would do fine. Why would I move such to the basement and pay more for better antennas? Bob
