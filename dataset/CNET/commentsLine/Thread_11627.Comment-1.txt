i think this is a good piece of software with one problem.
i can record music etc.
directly from my computer however since it is set to the logictech webcam the recording will pick up any noises-speech etc.
in our room.i tried setting it to &quot;line in sound max integrated&quot; but that did not record any sound.any suggestions please.thanks.
i asked this question before however here it is again.thanks.
