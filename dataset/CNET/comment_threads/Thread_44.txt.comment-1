Well I read this review: http://reviews.cnet.com/desktops/gateway-dx4831-01e/4505-3118_7-33964710.html and went ahead and got the computer.
Now I need to know how to add a hard drive.
Does anyone know if the Gateway comes with everything you need to add one?
I can't really remove anything from the old computer (Vaio), and might need a cable or something.
