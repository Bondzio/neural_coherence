I probably should not have used the word DMZ as this appears to be a word of art, and I had just used it to mean a &quot;less secure area&quot; where whatever my guests get up to on the Wifi might be isolated from our home lan, the TIVO can update itself, etc.
I have no idea how easy it might be to hack a Tivo or an Aluratek Internet Radio compared to a PC, but certainly would not be surprised to learn that they are much easier to get into and I doubt if they operate in a tunneled mode.
I have always thought of a port on a switch as a &quot;straight wire&quot; and that if for whatever reason I put a switch in front of a single router, that the router could connect through the switch.
But if I understand you, if there are two routers behind a switch (which is connected to my internet connection), each router cannot provide the modem function separately?
If so, then if I put the wired router (D-Link DL-604) (which functions as the modem and a switch, then connect the Wifi router (Zyxel P-330 v2) to one of the D-Link ports, will this create the &quot;less secure area&quot; for Group 1 and which is &quot;isolated&quot; from the other ports on the D-Link?
I just don't understand how how isolated one port on a switch is from another (i.e., can a node on one port of a switch sniff traffic on another port on a switch?)
and this is part of what I would like to better understand.
If a guest's PC is compromised and this computer is in use on the Wifi, can the compromised PC sniff traffic on the other ports of the wired router?
I hope that I am explaining my concerns clearly, but please let me know if not.
