So I ran seagate tools to check the disk, the first few quick checks didn't find anything, and then I did the larger check, and it took 8 or so hours, and it didn't find anything wrong either.
So I purchased a new SATA cable to replace the old one, and now the problems I was having are (so far) gone.
There is still a small (and expected) delay on seeking for very large files, but I would expect that in any event.
But the warping/skipping issue I was experiencing is gone.
