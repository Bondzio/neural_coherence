1.1.1	Greetings all .	St
1.1.2	Second time here to the forums .	St
1.1.3	I posted a question on one of the other forums and I have to say that the help that I received was wonderful , so I thought I 'd post this question in the hopes of finding an answer .	St
1.1.4	I 'm a newbie with regards to building or upgrading a computer .	St
1.1.5	So please forgive me if my question seems a little dumb .	Sug
1.1.6	I 've decided to upgrade a computer by adding a new hard drive & additional memory .	St
1.1.7	My mobo is an Asus P3B-F .	St
1.1.8	It is a Pentium II , 350Mhz .	St
1.1.9	My question is this .	St
1.1.10	Taking into account that my Prossesor speed is 350MHz , does that restrict me in the size of hard drive & rpm 's that I choose or in the amount of memory that I add ?	Ques
1.1.11	I 'd like to add a 80Gb hard drive at 7200rpm 's and 256MB of Ram .	St
1.1.12	I 'm already aware of the capability issues as far as connection-IDE etc. , but as for the above question I 'm a little confused .	St
1.1.13	With thanks	Polite
1.2.1	The short answer is yes .	St
1.2.2	My bet is that ASUS has a last hurrah BIOS upgrade ( which is free ) , that will ( I bet ! )	St
1.2.3	give you support for up to the 127 GB size or there abouts .	St
1.2.4	As to adding memory , the discussion at http : //hardwareanalysis.com/content/topic/4434/ MISSED the real issue .	St
1.2.5	The BX chipset requires double-sided memory and the usual stuff you get from off the rack or shelf is single sided .	St
1.2.6	I 'll write what the real electronic issue is and let you digest it .	St
1.2.7	The BX chipset only supplied enough address lines for 128M of RAM on a slot using a single Chip Enable signal .	St
1.2.8	To get 256M support , a second Chip Enable is used for the other bank of RAM on the memory stick .	St
1.2.9	Hence , double-sided .	St
1.2.10	One bank of ram verses two .	St
1.2.11	If you get some 256M stick of RAM and it works as 128M , then you got the wrong memory .	St
1.2.12	Better vendors like Crucial will ship you the right part if you look it up and supply that make/model board .	St
1.2.13	I do n't see any real show-stopper .	St

1.3.1	Your system is 5 years old now , and at the end stages of it 's useful life , you could start having serious hardware problems with it any time now , so do n't overinvest ... .but if you think you want to extend its life you should really consider getting a faster processor , they are quite cheap and an 800Mhz processor would definitely make a bigger difference than 256meg more memory ( unless you only only 64meg now ) .	St
1.3.2	Memory for your older system is more expensive than for current systems , costs almost 2 times what it costs for a new system .	St
1.3.3	Adding more than 256meg of memory is unlikely to make any noticeable difference , how much do you have now , adding 128meg might make more sense , you probably wo n't be able to tell the difference unless you only have 64meg now , and in that case adding 256meg more would help if you are running XP , but probably wo n't help at all if you have Win98 or Windows ME .	St
1.3.4	Your motherboard was not originally configured for an 80GB drive , but will support it , you may need a BIOS update , unless you have updated it since you bought it .	St
