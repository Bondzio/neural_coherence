<s> I am having problems with a keyboard on a PC running Windows XP. </s>
<s> When I press backspace it opens Internet Explorer. </s>
<s> I have looked everwhere and can not find a solution to this. </s>
<s> Any help would be great. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> start - settings - control panel - keyboard - make sure it is set to US default Look at the keyboard mappings, character settings etc. </s>
<s> It got changed somehow - possibly malware. </s>
<s> When a keyboard starts messing up like you describe the first things to do are to unplug and replug the keyboard to see if that fixes it. </s>
<s> Next is to reboot, third is to test another keyboard. </s>
