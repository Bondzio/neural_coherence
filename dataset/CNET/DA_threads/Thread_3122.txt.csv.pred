1.1.1	First of all I apologize if this issue has been asked and answer in the past .	St
1.1.2	Thank you before hand for any information .	St
1.1.3	I recently purchased a Netgear ME102 Access Point Wireless Router .	St
1.1.4	I downloaded the USB Management software and drivers into my laptop and win xp recongized it .	St
1.1.5	My problem is that is afar as I know h ow to go .	St
1.1.6	I do n't know how to set tcip protocols , gateways ds etc.etc .	St
1.1.7	and I much less do n't know how to set up my wireless network .	St
1.1.8	I have done my research but the information that I find goes right over my head .	St
1.1.9	If I can get any ifnormation or step by step on how to configure my wireless network with my netgear router I would appreciate it	St
1.2.1	Wireless NICs in the PCs ?	Ques
1.2.2	Network Interface cards .	St
1.2.3	Most wireless routers are wireless ready when you turn them on .	St
1.2.4	No & quot ; creative & quot ; setup is necessary other than setting up security .	St
1.2.5	Tell us more about each PC , what kind of W-NIC is involved , cable or DSL ( it does make a difference ) , and are any of the PCs wired ?	Ques
1.3.1	ok well I will try to answer as much as I can , all I have for my network will be my Dell inspiron dual amd laptop that comes with a Dell wireless Wlan 1370 Card mini pci card .	St
1.3.2	My pc has no problem recongizing hot spots or wi-fi areas .	St
1.3.3	I do have high speed dsl and when I connect the ethernet cable from the modem to the router , nothing happens .	St
1.3.4	Like I said did install the software managemetn for usb configuration and have cnnected my router to pc via usb , that is where I get stuck .	St
1.3.5	I do n't know how to set up ip numbers for the router and pc etc .	St
1.4.1	for that exact reason .	St
1.4.2	To use USB you have to install a lot of extra & quot ; stuff & quot ; for the PC to recognize it .	St
1.4.3	Can you connect the PC to the router via Ethernet ?	Ques
1.4.4	The wired Ethernet port on the PC will recognize the router automatically .	St
1.4.5	Nothing to install .	St
1.4.6	Once you get connected you can access the router and turn on the wireless .	St
1.4.7	BTW , you 'll need to configure the router to work with DSL before you can surf .	St
1.4.8	DSL requires PPoE ( usually ) and you 'll need to set up a logon like just connecting to the modem .	St
1.4.9	The router will then mimic the PC and access the net .	St
1.4.10	After you 're on line & quot ; wired & quot ; , turn on the wireless on the router and unplug .	St
1.4.11	You should be good to go wireles .	St
1.5.1	That makes sense , should I uninstall the usb management program ?	Ques
1.5.2	and then just connect the router via ethernet connection ?	Sug
1.5.3	what do I have to do with all the addresses that is required ?	Ques
1.5.4	and you just blew over me again , how do I configure my router to the dsl ?	Ques
1.5.5	Hey I appreciate your help If you get me through this I will do anything to repay for your help .	St
1.6.1	The USB stuff .	St
1.6.2	Now , connect the router to the modem and the PC to the router .	St
1.6.3	You 'll have to read the owner 's manual on how to access the router .	St
1.6.4	In essence , you open a browser and type in an IP address .	St
1.6.5	Different routers use a different address , but they ALL will be 192.168.x.x .	St
1.6.6	A browser window will open and the configuration screens are listed .	St
1.6.7	My D-link uses 192.168.0.1 .	St
1.6.8	Netgear I think uses 192.168.1.1 .	St
1.6.9	Read the manual .	St
1.6.10	The manual will tell you what screens do what , and how to configure the router for DSL .	St
1.6.11	You then tell the router to turn on the wireless radio .	St
1.6.12	Again , all routers have different screens so I ca n't help you there .	St
1.6.13	After you have turned wireless on you need to turn on encryption .	St
1.6.14	There will be another screen for this .	St
1.6.15	The easiest is WEP which is a form of encryption .	St
1.6.16	You 'll set a pass code on the router and the same code on the laptop .	St
1.6.17	I use the 10 character version .	St
1.6.18	It is in HEX which gives you the numbers 0-9 and letters A-F. Make up anything you want but DO NOT FORGET IT !	St
1.6.19	After you have set this up , exit the router by clicking on your home page .	St
1.6.20	If you 've done this correctly you 'll surf .	St
1.6.21	If you can surf wired , unplug and have the laptop look for a wireless network .	St
1.6.22	It should see yours .	St
1.6.23	Since all laptops use different software for their wireless modems and some use Windows to manage it and some use the card 's software ( Cisco for one ) , you 'll have to investigate yours .	St
1.6.24	Done , and good luck .	Polite
1.6.25	Wayne There are 10 types of people who understand binary ; those that do and those that do n't .	St
1.6.26	Click here to see the CNet faces , learn a little about analog and digital data , internet connections , spyware removal , and download free software .	St
1.7.1	you said to connect router to modem and the pc to the router .	St
1.7.2	This is not possible with my router all I have is the ethernet connection and the usb connection besides the power supply .	St
1.7.3	How do I go around that ?	Ques
1.8.1	Have a look on this home wireless network setup tutorial , it 's not that difficult to set it up.. wireless network setup tutorial : http : //www.home-network-help.com/wireless-network.html Have fun ...	St
1.9.1	I should have looked up the unit .	St
1.9.2	It 's not a router .	St
1.9.3	It 's just an access point .	St
1.9.4	Did you get a user 's manual ?	Ques
1.9.5	I 'm afraid you 'll have to do some digging .	St
1.9.6	I found the owner 's manual here http : //www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-ME102-Wireless-access-point/dp/B00005B8HU , scroll down to Product Manual .	St
1.9.7	Sorry , and good luck .	Polite
