<s> Help - My son pulled the flash drive out without waiting for it to be closed. </s>
<s> Now I can't do anything with it - I can't even format it and start over again. </s>
<s> (There was nothing critical on it at the time.) </s>
<s> It was a 2GB Coby. </s>
<s> I have a generic computer at home, using Windows XP. </s>
<s> I also tried taking the flash drive to work where I have a Dell, also Windows XP. </s>
<s> When I check the drive, it says it is functioning correctly. </s>
<s> When I try to move info to it, I'm always asked if I want to format it, but then it says formatting not possible. </s>
<s> What else do I need to do? </s>
<s> Or is it lost forever? </s>
<s> Thanks - Mom70x7 </s>
