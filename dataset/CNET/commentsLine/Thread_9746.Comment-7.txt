common sense says i have to side with robert.
for an average joe user like me (surfing, doing a little video stuffs, etc.
), vga should do just fine; i won't go out and spend big bucks for dvi hardwares.
but if hi-def video is your thing, then dvi will be needed.
so how's the new year been treating you so far?
hopefully better than last year.
