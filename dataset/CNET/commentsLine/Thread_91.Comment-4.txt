the &quot;freezer cure&quot; is a carryover when hds were in the mb range.
plus, it *may* allow the electronics &quot;contract&quot; if an open or burnt component, but this is only a temporary fix, not a real fix.
thus, you need to get any data if that's the sole purpose and do it quickly.
understand, if it fails further, it maybe corrupt the data even more, so beware.
even then it may not work at all, just be sure to double wrap the hd in plastic and allow at least a few minutes before use to climatize and then power-up.
