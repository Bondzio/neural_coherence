hello: i have a lan that worked until wednesday.
since then, no computer can see any other computer on the network except the linux server... all computers are either windows (xp home, xp professional, or media center) and none are 64 bit.
i can connect to the internet using all of the computers, and dns works.
i can ping the router and network printer.
using the &quot;net view //[computername]&quot; command, i can see the individual computers that have file and print sharing installed and set up.
yet, none of the computers appear in the my network window (or in the view network computers window).
no changes to the firewall (kapersky, zone labs, comodo) have been made on the computers--unless conducted by an update.
any suggestions?
