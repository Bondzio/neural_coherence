1.1.1	Hi , Sorry if this is posted in the wrong section , so please move it if it is .	St
1.1.2	I need to find for my study project a graphics card expert who 's willing to help me .	St
1.1.3	The person needs to answer 15 questions ( that i made ) about the history of the graphics card .	St
1.1.4	Thanks Chris	Polite
1.2.1	My experience dates back to pre-PC days with circuit designs from about 1972 .	St
1.2.2	Does that help ?	Ques
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Hi , Think it does Class starts again on monday so i 'll have to ask then .	St
1.3.2	It has n't been easy finding one : s Thanks	St
1.4.1	Good grief BOB !	St
1.4.2	You are dating yourself ! !	St
1.4.3	I thought I was the only Dinosaur around **LOL** I go back to roughly the same era and perhaps beyond , PRE SOLID state , tape drives , etc .	St
1.4.4	Happy new year !	St
1.5.1	Was in use back then and in the class I took we learned how to inspect it and even repair the memory arrays .	St
1.5.2	Graphics back then was pretty crude .	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	that required a heater and temperature control to keep their crystal oscillators stable , Hollerith punch cards and ascii punch tape , keyboards that somehow coded with visible light .	St
1.6.2	You 'll remember words like & quot ; and , nand , or and nor & quot ; and maybe even & quot ; Schmidt trigger & quot ; ... but video ... what video ... there was n't anything that resembled video other than the Lissajous pattern on one 's O-scope doing hard drive head alignments .	St
1.7.1	Ah yes , have n't heard that terminology for years !	St
1.7.2	Sort of a walk down memory lane , glad to see that SOMEONE still remembers !	St
1.7.3	HAPPY NEW YEAR STEVE !	St
1.7.4	!	St
1.8.1	One of the labs was to build the tic tac toe game with relays .	St
1.8.2	LEDs were new and expensive so incandescent bulbs and LEAD based solder .	St
1.8.3	Graphics of the day was with pens that were pushed around the paper !	St
1.8.4	Bob	St
1.9.1	Some of the communication stuff I worked on in the military and later used this type of memory .	St
1.9.2	I was once told that they were hand & quot ; sewn & quot ; by Asian women because they were the only people with the eyesight and steady hand to do this work .	St
1.9.3	Vaguely I remember something about having read , write , and re-write functions .	St
1.9.4	The beads required two lines to make them change state ... X and Y .	St
1.9.5	Either did n't provide enough current to switch them so this happened only at the intersection where both passed through a bead .	St
1.9.6	To read from memory , an attempt was made to switch each bead back using the same method .	St
1.9.7	If it switched , a small current was felt in the read line .	St
1.9.8	This , effectively , cleared that bead and the controller would need to write it back again ... .or at least that 's the explanation I remember .	St
1.9.9	I 'm thinking that 8 or 16 k occupied nearly 1 square foot of space on a PCB .	St
1.9.10	I never saw one of these fail .	St
1.10.1	Yes Bob and the calculators had handles on them and a word processor was a Royal or a Remmington , Happy New Year , Phil	St
1.11.1	My first was an Underwood .	St
1.11.2	We nicknamed it the & quot ; Blunderwood & quot ; .	St
1.11.3	but the purest would prefer one of these http : //images.google.com/images ? hl=en & um=1 & q=blickensderfer & sa=N & start=0 & ndsp=18	St
1.12.1	Blade maker and gun maker ?	Ques
1.12.2	Seems the right stuff for zombie movies .	St
1.13.1	We had no graphics to speak of .	St
1.13.2	All i/f was through the teletype panel .	St
1.13.3	Though , some could say the punch cards were also an i/f .	St
1.13.4	Let 's see , input a problem and walk away or await a call to say the work was done .	St
1.13.5	Also , computers were noisy back then up to a point .	St
1.13.6	Those printers back then , really pounded away .	St
1.13.7	Heck , I had to learn & quot ; tube theory & quot ; and read all those darn logic schematics .	St
1.13.8	-- -- -Willy	St
