<s> Hi, I apologize if this has been solved before, I had trouble searching. </s>
<s> I am having trouble connecting my old T40 (2373-19U) laptop to my Airport Extreme network. </s>
<s> The laptop is running XP Pro SP2. </s>
<s> The LAN adapters are Intel PRO/100 VE (driver version 8.0.47.0) and PRO/Wireless LAN 2100 3B (driver version 1.2.5.37). </s>
<s> I also have a Belkin F5D8053 USB network adapter and the software is installed (my ultimate goal is to get that working and switch my network to WPA/WPA2). </s>
<s> My router is an Airport Extreme, to which an iMac is already successfully connected, currently set up with Transitional WEP security. </s>
<s> The Airport is connected to a cable modem. </s>
<s> I seem unable to connect through any method (wired or wireless). </s>
<s> I CAN access the internet if I bypass the router and plug the ethernet cable directly into the cable modem. </s>
<s> I can get Network Connections to see available wireless networks, and I can even get my built-in wireless card to &quot;connect&quot; although it isn't really connected. </s>
<s> When I've got the ethernet cable connected, I have &quot;limited or no connectivity.&quot; At one point I tried switching the router security to &quot;none&quot; but still was unable to connect. </s>
<s> I must have messed up my settings trying to get this to work. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> What should I check? </s>
<s> Thanks - </s>
<s> set to run in mixed mode for the other network cards if it is set to N or G only it might be ignoring any other standard those network cards may be using. </s>
