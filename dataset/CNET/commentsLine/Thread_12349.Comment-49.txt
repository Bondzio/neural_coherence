allows one to store files on it from the home computer and then retrieve those files remotely from the web when away from home.
i got on the netgear page and finally found this info.
anyway, since that is not anything i would ever need to do, and since i also read that this unit (the storage router) gets pretty hot, i've decided against it after all.
as i have researched further, i'm not convinced it is a good idea for me to get a router and use the card i already have with it and fret about how they work together when i can get a set (&quot;kit&quot;) comprised of router and card that is made to work together.
there's also a current sale offering a $40 rebate, so i think i'm going with a netgear kit = the wgtb511t (which also supposedly reaches 108 mbps when in &quot;turbo mode&quot; whatever that is.)
thanks for your input.
