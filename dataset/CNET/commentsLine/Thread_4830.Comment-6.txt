why would you need to buy 2 different motherboards, and 2 different sets of ram?
if you're planning on building 2 computers, then you're going to be needing more parts.
if you're just building 1 computer, i don't see the need for the extra components.
you also need to be aware of this issue in regards to system builders - oem
