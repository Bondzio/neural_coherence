1.1.1	Hello everybody , last year in October 2004 , I bought a MAG 17 inch LCD monitor to replace my CRT monitor .	St
1.1.2	I have heard that LCD monitors last longer than an CRT monitor , but I was wondering does anybody know how long on average does an LCD last before you have to fix it or buy a new one ?	Ques
1.1.3	For example I know that there is a lamp inside an LCD monitor and I was wondering how long that will last on average .	St
1.2.1	The CCFL or lamp will slowly degrade with time .	St
1.2.2	Some define end of life when the lamp hits 50 % of its output .	St
1.2.3	What is your definition ?	Ques
1.2.4	As to the actual numbers , all are estimates but are published .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	thanks for your input .	Polite
1.4.2	I forgot to realize that the lamp inside an LCD monitor gets dim overtime .	St
1.4.3	yeah I was wondering when will the lamp start becoming dim and how long before it simply goes out ?	Ques
1.4.4	how many hours ?	Ques
1.5.1	There will other failures , but we are talking averages of the lifetime .	St
1.5.2	If you look in some peripherals forum , you find a production gaffe that caused that model to possibly have a 1 to 2 year lifespan .	St
1.5.3	But that 's not the usual .	St
1.5.4	As to dead or no output .	St
1.5.5	It was a long ( too long ) discussion with others that could n't accept that LEDs do n't burn out like light bulbs .	St
1.5.6	Find a graph and you see it diminish , diminish and keep diminshing .	St
1.5.7	If you read the reports they never burned out .	St
1.5.8	Bob	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	cuz it seems less bright than when it was new ... or it could be that i 'm spending more time in front of it that my eyes got use to the brightness lol anyways yah lcds can last 2 years for some ppl and some can last even longer but nothing lasts forever and eventually it will break	St
1.8.1	is the term generally used for LEDs , which means the LED will be half as bright .	St
1.8.2	The half-life of an LED is generally considered to be about a hundred years .	St
1.8.3	Of course this is in perfect laboratory conditions , and with perfect samples .	St
1.8.4	What you and I will generally see are dead pixels .	St
1.8.5	But remember this .	St
1.8.6	By the time your display has become unusable , something better and cheaper will be available .	St
1.8.7	Count on it .	St
1.9.1	I 'd say that my monitors are about 8hrs a day on and not in screen-saver or standby .	St
1.9.2	By my calculation your 60,000 hrs will give just over 20 years of service life .	St
1.9.3	REALLY ?	Ques
1.9.4	BTW , agree with nerdyboy1234 about the brightness of LCD fading , or getting used too .	St
1.9.5	My now 1 year old LCD just about burned my eyes out when it was new .	St
1.9.6	Resolved it by using the AVI cable instead of DV cable ( monitor had both connections , video card just DV ) .	St
1.9.7	Can anyone explain why this work-around worked , because I have n't a clue ?	Ques
1.10.1	... or does that make no difference ?	Ques
1.10.2	Thanks .	Polite
1.11.1	Whoever says that the display lasts 60,000 hours , has never used it that long .	St
1.11.2	I bought a Compaq Presario two years back for Rs .	St
1.11.3	75000/- ( that 's US $ 1666/- but is a lot of money in India ) .	St
1.11.4	The screen started getting dimmer , I didnt realise , I kept telling my wife to keep curtains drawn , I 'm getting a glare , cant read the display .	St
1.11.5	Then it reached the not-readable state .	St
1.11.6	Imagine my surprise when compaq service indicated a cost of Rs .	St
1.11.7	50,000 , they dont give the parts which conk out , I have to buy the invertor and the display .	St
1.11.8	And to find out what is wrong , they would first charge me an obscene amount first , which will not even be adjusted against cost of replacement of the display .	St
1.11.9	This is a money making racket , and I will never buy a laptop again .	St
1.11.10	I 've decided to buy next time the latest cellphone which has computer functions , and work in conjunction with a desktop .	St
1.12.1	I can state that I 've purchased over 50 Planar LCD Monitors 4 years ago for my network and not one had dead pixels upon installation and only one has failed within recent months and they run 24/7 .	St
1.12.2	Planar was providing LCD 's to the medical field and Air Force long before consumer LCD 's became popular .	St
1.12.3	Thus I have 4 years of successful use with a large quantity and our staff have been very happy .	St
1.12.4	I use a double panel I monitor my network form and I have an 18 '' LCD at home that 've run flawlessly and now they are one hell of a bargain versus 4 years ago .	St
1.13.1	Are you able to purchase from ebay , perhaps you can find a dead laptop to use for parts there for much less .	St
1.13.2	I have 3 flat panel monitors , all from different manufacturers , only had troubles with 1 , but it was under its 3 year warranty and was replaced .	St
1.13.3	3 years is the longest I have owned one without troubles .	St
1.13.4	I would shop aroung and make sure you get at least a 3 year warranty .	St
1.13.5	As far as laptop screens , I have worked on units with Pentium 1 's and the screens still seem very bright , issues with moisture , static , or abuse [ i.e .	St
1.13.6	dropping ] will shorten the life of any product .	St
1.14.1	I have 3 puters on a home wireless network .	St
1.14.2	It stays on all the time .	St
1.14.3	Would I be better off powering the whole thing down at night ?	Ques
1.14.4	The life of LCD 's sparked this question .	St
1.15.1	That 's true of many components .	St
1.15.2	Run at lower output = longer life .	St
1.15.3	Linux , Windows , MacOS all offer power saving settings that you can program to shut the monitor off after so many minutes .	St
1.15.4	The new monitors are designed for this to save power and this does extend the life .	St
1.15.5	In the case of a laptop , I maintain it 's not as big a deal since I 'm seeing 4 years tops for office machines when keeping the old ( now slow ) machine around costs us more than replacing it with spiffy new fast machines .	St
1.15.6	Bob	St
1.16.1	I have used a Viewsonic CRT monitor for seven years ( 1999-2005 ) and it has not failed me in any way .	St
1.16.2	I also am looking at LCD 's but have no idea how long they last .	St
1.17.1	What is your recommended shutdown time ?	Ques
1.17.2	I have always turned off auto shutdown , but this is my 1st LCD and I would like to maximize it 's lifespan .	St
1.17.3	Thanks .	Polite
1.18.1	My take is that if the computer is used everyday , it should be left on .	St
1.18.2	But you should use the power saving features on the screen saver tab .	St
1.18.3	I have my computer turn off the monitor after 5 minutes of non-use and spin down the drives after 10 .	St
1.18.4	( There 's no rhyme or reason to why I picked these numbers . )	St
1.18.5	If I 'm going to be out of town for more than a few days , I try to remember to turn off the computer .	St
1.18.6	Most of the time I forget .	St
1.19.1	As far as I know , most LCD displays do not , yet , have LED illumination .	St
1.19.2	This is one of the applications held out for white-light LEDs .	St
1.19.3	Most displays have LCDs .	St
1.19.4	They do n't create light .	St
1.19.5	There 's a white backlight illuminating the LCD , where the colour stuff happens .	St
1.19.6	The bit that fades is the backlight .	St
1.19.7	These are often fluorescent lamps .	St
1.19.8	No reason why these should cost an arm and a leg to replace .	St
1.19.9	For an explanation of why backlights fade , read this : http : //www.elotouch.com/products/crtlife.asp	St
1.20.1	Most backlights for LCD screens are either cold cathode fluorescent tubes , or garden variety fluorescent tubes .	St
1.20.2	LEDs are rarely ever used ( maybe places like cell phones ) due to their unbalanced emission spectra .	St
1.20.3	The tubes in LCDs do degrade much like LEDs but unlike LEDs they sometimes do just die out .	St
1.21.1	I have been to your country 5 times in the last 10 years .	St
1.21.2	From what I saw , the products which were sold there were often outdated and possibly refurbished .	St
1.21.3	There is also the likelyhood that the products are not the best in the lot during the quality control process .	St
1.21.4	The best in the lot are sent to the USA , and the rest are sold elsewhere .	St
1.21.5	This is even true with Japanese named brand sold in Japan .	St
1.21.6	I have a Panasonic shaver bought in Tokyo 1 year ago .	St
1.21.7	The rechargeable battery is not holding it 's charge like it used to be .	St
1.21.8	I am a computer consultant and have used laptop computer since when they made laptop .	St
1.21.9	None of the LCD died on me .	St
1.21.10	I still have a Sharp Actius 100 running with the screen as bright as the first day I bought it back in 1998 .	St
1.22.1	I used the notes I have on LEDs since I had to write studies on such lifespans in a hardware project I worked on .	St
1.22.2	The LCD lighting and lifespan is close enough that I can use this information .	St
1.22.3	So far I 've found the invertor dies rather than than the LCD or CFFL tubes so I maintain that the parallels are close enough to be useful .	St
1.22.4	Cheers , Bob	St
1.23.1	I 've heard a few experts say that leaving your pc or monitor on all day is n't really necessary .	St
1.23.2	You just end up paying a higher electric bill is all .	St
1.23.3	They said that turning them on/off every day does n't really stress the parts as much as some people think .	St
1.23.4	Besides , even if it does shorten their lifespan , it will most likely happen many years down the road , long after you 've bought a new pc & monitor .	St
1.24.1	... I 'm not talking about shutting it off but , rather , viewing it with the minimal brightness that I need .	St
1.24.2	Will this extend the life ?	Ques
1.24.3	Again , thanks .	Polite
1.25.1	Yes .	St
1.25.2	That 's true of many components .	St
1.25.3	Run at lower output = longer life .	St
1.26.1	the LCD panel inside of your monitor is the expensive part , and it will last & quot ; forever & quot ; .	St
1.26.2	However , other parts of the system will limit the lifetime .	St
1.26.3	The cold cathode florescent tubes used for a backlight will have a 1/2 brightness time of a few thousand hours and may suffer premature death .	St
1.26.4	The power supply parts should last forever , but may also suffer failure after a few years ( especially the surface-mount capacitors for some reason ) .	St
1.26.5	Buttons - well that depends on you .	St
1.26.6	Same for rear-panel connectors ( do n't stress them ) .	St
1.26.7	Unlike a CRT monitor where the tube is about 95 % the value of the monitor , and when the tube gets dim you chuck the whole thing , when an LCD gets dim , you can replace the lamps .	St
1.26.8	This will take some effort , and your computer place WILL NOT DO THIS ( they just REPLACE MAJOR PARTS ) - you got ta find a real electronic technician who can use a mutimeter and a scope and stuff .	St
1.26.9	There are actually very few styles of lamp made , so you can track these down .	St
1.26.10	You ( or your tech ) will have to get these from a major distrutor like Bulbtronics or Arrow or something .	St
1.26.11	This is different from , say , TV 's where some of the parts are custom chips and can only be obtained from the mfr ( IF the can be had at all ) .	St
1.26.12	Overall , over the years , I have tossed CRT monitors about 1/2 the time because they were broken ( either out , or degraded performance ) and about 1/2 the time because nobody wanted to use it ( too small , to low res ) .	St
1.26.13	EVERY time I have discarded an LCD it was because it was too small or too low res ( i.e .	St
1.26.14	12 & quot ; VGA ) .	St
1.26.15	The one exception was when my laptap display went out ( under warranty ) because of a $ 2 cable and they replaced the entire display ( worth about $ 600 ) .	St
1.26.16	It was done under warranty and they would not give me the old one back , so maybe someone back at & quot ; depot & quot ; replaced those $ 2 cables and recycled the LCD panel ... ... . Like when you get a new alternator for $ 120 and they take back the old one so somebody can replace the $ 2 brushes and then repaint it and sell it for $ 80 & quot ; remanufactured & quot ; .	St
1.27.1	A DVI cable actually sends a signal to define the contrast of the picture .	St
1.27.2	VGA/composite does not .	Res
1.27.3	Thats also why some ( most ? )	Ques
1.27.4	LCD monitors will not allow contrast adjustment on a DVI signal .	St
1.28.1	NIL	St
1.29.1	Thanks to this CNET forum and everyone for replying to my gripe about Compaq 's ripoff .	St
1.29.2	It 's good to know I 'm not the sole victim , and yes Mr. Perry Tsang , we sort of know India is a dumping ground , but thought we were imagining too much .	St
1.29.3	Wish I had the forum 's and everyone 's email , would have thanked everyone individually .	St
1.29.4	I 'm at mazda @ vsnl.com Navroz .	St
1.30.1	I have owned and used PCs for over ten years in my home and business and I switch them off whenver I am not using them and in all that time I have never had a problem .	St
1.30.2	Why do I switch them off ?	Ques
1.30.3	Because it is wasting massive amounts of energy , you the imagine the drain of millions of computer being left on needlessly ?	Ques
1.30.4	Even with power saving features residual current is still being used .	St
1.30.5	The environment is changing , we need to change with it .	St
1.31.1	I think the 60,000 hour figure is for plasma displays , not LCD displays with cold cathode florusent lamps .	St
1.31.2	All LCD have a light source , The big downside of LCD displays is the fact that it is so difficult to get and replace the lamps .	St
1.31.3	Hey , has your LCD gone dim ? ? ?	Ques
1.31.4	Buy a new one is the attitude of the manufactures .	St
1.31.5	If the lamps could be easly replaced then LCD would last longer than a CRT .	St
1.31.6	John	St
1.32.1	NIL	St
1.33.1	I knew that .	St
1.33.2	But the brain said LED instead of LCD .	St
1.33.3	I 'll save that answer for an LED question .	St
1.33.4	Thanks .	Polite
