It does not take in account the power supply age or the issues such as the label that claims 500 Watts but never delivers such as http://www.tomshardware.com/2005/07/11/stress_test/ Your calculator only makes matters worse since you will lull users into thinking their 300 or such Watt power supply is enough. Why not put a little more effort into this? Bob

It is impossible to predict in such tool which PSU has real 500W (for example) or not. Also it is impossible to collect the information about all the PC components power consumption by 3.3V, 5V and 12V rails because not all companies provide it to the public (video cards for example). At least I warn people that amperage is more important than watts...

I've seen many power calculators but yours is the worst offender so far. It will create far too many machines that will be unstable and possible even smoke parts. Sorry to pan your efforts so harshly, but having replaced 100's of PSUs over the years due to such &quot;calculators&quot;, I will not be accepting of a calculator that misses the mark by such a wide margin.

Sites like TomsHardware, DFI and many others recommend this calculator, not any other ones. And it's funny because real PC tech people called my calculator as &quot;overestimator&quot; before because it had overhead by 10-30% Now almost 90% of the components have an accurate wattage. &quot;I've seen many power calculators but yours is the worst offender so far. It will create far too many machines that will be unstable and possible even smoke parts.&quot; It's a very strong statement. What makes you think that those calculators are more accurate than my? Can you provide me with some real numbers for any particular components and why do you think that mine are not correct? Because somebody created a PSU calculator 5 years ago and rest of the &quot;creators&quot; just copied his code doesn't mean that they have a perfect tool to estimate watts. Let's discuss it. I've spent 2 years studying PC components, it will be fun &quot;Sorry to pan your efforts so harshly, but having replaced 100's of PSUs over the years due to such &quot;calculators&quot;, I will not be accepting of a calculator that misses the mark by such a wide margin.&quot; You see, I'm not telling people to go and buy 500W PSU of some made_in_the_basemnet_of_zanzibar brand. As I mentioned in of my previous respond - user is MUST check what is he buying!!! For God's sake - there are tons of online forums, reviews, guides, sites that explain about power supplies. I bet most of those 100's PSUs died because of amperage lack on a particular rail. More likely 12V. But I do warn people on my website that amperage is more important than watts. Well, you can call this the worst calculator known. It's your opinion but I respect it. Regards, mnemonik23

The sad thing is my vid card didn't even run on a 300watt psu. I had to buy a 450watt to run my system. This calculator is very deceptive. Since there are so many other variables that are not considered in determining wattage needed, such as PSU quality, then this calculator doesn't serve its purpose. &quot;The eXtreme PSU Calculator is provided as-is and we shall not be responsible for any kind of harm, physical defects, equipment damage and other loss or damages as result of using this utility.

I think we're riling the web site's author about this, but to tout that you can pick a power supply by wattage is incorrect. So far this site only makes matters worse as it doesn't do a good job of telling that you need so many Amperes on each supply leg but reports Watts. All power supplies degrade with time and that's not in the mix either. Bob
2274	15	154331	1751015	1750382	mnemonik23	2/17/06 9:15 AM	1.1401677E12	TO STOP ALL SPECULATIONS: see inside	Bob, you can skip this part and go directly to &quot;TO STOP ALL SPECULATIONS&quot; section. ------------------------------- Just talking, declining everything, now facts, no answers, everything is bad, getting worse, etc., etc. Now you blame it because &quot;it doesn't do a good job of telling that you need so many Amperes on each supply leg&quot;. I answered you before - it is impossible to do unless all companies will release the power consumption information for their components. OR somebody (like some of the existing calculators) will fake it up. Again, for those who still don't get it: Calculator just estimates a recommended total amount of watts. It DOES NOT SAY: buy a 500W PSU which costs $20 bucks with 10A on 12V rail and made God knows where (I'll probably add a note about this on my site). TO STOP ALL SPECULATIONS: ========================= 1. Buy a Kill-A-Watt monitor (around $20-$25). 2. Plug your PC power cord into Kill-A-Watt monitor. 3. Plug Kill-A-Watt monitor into wall outlet. 4. Turn ON your PC. 5. Start DVD encoding process. 6. Start CD burning process. 7. Start HDD file copy process (let's say 200-300GB OR less - depends on the capacity and shock resistance!). 8. Start Prime95 (CPU and RAM stress test). 9. Start 3DMark06 - Shader Model 3.0 graphics test in a loop at 1600x1200 resolution and with enabled 4x FSAA and 16 anisotropic filtering (for graphics cards that do not support multi-sampling antialiasing with HDR, do not enable it, for those who do not have SM 3.0 support, the third game test from the 3DMark05 should be used). 10. If your PC is still alive - you can check your system power consumption. Well, you have an idea. Many of you will not be able to do all these steps at the same time but at least try DVD encoding, Prime95 and 3DMark. You will be surprised Have fun!

While measuring with the Kill-A-Watt is a grand idea, it doesn't help determine what size PSU you need (just Watts.) The conversion efficiency was not mentioned but on average ranks from a low of 60 to top notch numbers in the 90s. This again doesn't address Amperes on each supply leg and if said supply is OK or overtaxed. While your effort is commendable, it's not helping people get the right power supply. Tomshardware did a fine review of power supplies and with 9 out of 21 supplies that could not meet their label numbers, your exacting method of calculation will get more people into trouble than help them avoid the PSU traps. Power supplies are a deep topic. Why not expand your site to cover the whole story? Bob

Just Watts - that's what my calculator does to have at least an idea about approximate amount of Watts you will need and then start reading PSU reviews, labels, etc. AND only after that buy one. My calculator is just a start. &quot;While your effort is commendable, it's not helping people get the right power supply.&quot; - See above. Bob, tell us, how would you start shopping for a new PSU for your new system? P.S. You are right about PSUs: they are a deep topic and actually I'm working on it It just takes a lot of my free time... Damn it, people! I'm spending my free time by doing this and what I've got? No appreciation at all! I'm just kidding, you know I love you all
2274	18	154331	1751199	1751115	R. Proffitt	2/17/06 10:20 AM	1.1401716E12	Let's try this.	Your PC (or device) draws only what it needs for power. If we can avoid the &quot;inrush current&quot; issue, we can make this quite simple. Let's say I want to fit a power supply with enough headroom (spare capacity) to allow for a few years degradation and not suffer what happens when we tax a power supply. We'll also reap the benefit of running the PSU at a fraction of it's full load. The conversion efficiency on most models increases as we move away from full load. It also decreases as we approach and pass the 10 percent mark. We have 2 disparate paths we can take here. The fundamentally correct methods is to tally up the amperes (max) for each supply leg and then add about 25 to 50 percent to account for electrolytic capacitor aging. Then we can shop for a PSU that meets that. However the 50 percent over-rating is best since that accounts for most manufacturer's fibs. The next method is to try the Watts calculation. If we go down that road, then the over-rating would be to double what we added up to overshoot the numbers for the power supply amperages as well as aging effect or label lies. After all that we can go shopping. -&gt; PC Power and Cooling is great stuff, but even their supplies suffer the electrolytic capacitor aging issue. So we can't fit exactly what we need and expect it to be OK in the next year. Bob

I like the first method but it is hard to find out the amperes (max) for each supply leg... mnemonik23

In the section titled &quot;ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITORS&quot; &quot; Cons: Marginal electrical properties means that these capacitors must be applied with care. The parameters to be watched include leakage, service life vs. temperature, ESR, ESL, and low-temperature performance. &quot; http://my.execpc.com/~endlr/ If you look at BAD CAPS on google.com you find the badcaps web site. This is NOT the topic we are on but if you look at the low-temperature &quot;performance&quot; you find out why many of those bad cap motherboard owners were able to get the machine to boot after it &quot;warmed up.&quot; This is another point where we have to select &quot;overkill&quot; on the PSU because someone might turn on their PC when it's nearly 0C in some basement. Most of your label &quot;specs&quot; are for 25C operation. Just another reason why you see many old salts fit the bigger supplies. More surprises as we research &quot;service life.&quot; I hope this explains what your correct size power supply may not handle the load next year. It's not as solid state as people believed. Bob
