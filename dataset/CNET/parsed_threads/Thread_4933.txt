<s> Hello: I have to buy a replacement for my HP All in One 7410 because it finally gave out. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, that model is no longer made, so I was looking at other brands. </s>
<s> I was considering an Epson Artisan 800 or a Brother Multifunction. </s>
<s> Any thoughts? </s>
<s> My HP printer is totally wireless and is not hooked into my router and I have multiple PCs and laptops printing to it. </s>
<s> My concern is that the Brother and the Epson must be hooked in to the Router (which is in another room) to make it wireless, unlike the HP. </s>
<s> Can anyone advise me if the other brands are truly wireless, or do they have to hook in through the Router. </s>
<s> Thanks so much! </s>
<s> You can buy wireless adapters that work with other printers. </s>
<s> This broadens your choices considerably. </s>
<s> You might want to look into that instead. </s>
<s> Pick a good printer and add the adapter. </s>
<s> They'll generally plug into Ethernet or USB ports. </s>
<s> And if you already happen to have any NAS-drives, they might also be able to support network printers. </s>
<s> The interface is usually USB, which widens the range of printers to be bought. </s>
