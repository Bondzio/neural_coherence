I have two Rev-A Bondi iMacs, both pre-owned by different users.
Their spec is identical, and all the components are original.
So why is it that one CD-ROM drive will recognise CDRWs, but the other won't?
CDRs are no problem, and it doesn't make a difference if it's Mac OS standard or ISO 9660.
I've checked the extensions, software, control panels, everything I could think of!
What am I missing?
Thanks for your help so far!
