hi, i'm about to buy a new lcd monitor for my father.
he's 60 years old and his eyes aren't quite as sharp as they used to be.
he currently uses a 17&quot; samsung crt monitor at 1024x768 with the font size set to large (not extra large) in the winxp appearance settings.
he finds this comfortable - the text is large enough for him to read.
i want to buy him a larger lcd monitor now.
what screen size / resolution should i go for so that he'll find it just as comfortable, but will have more screen space?
my budget is around $200, definitely not more that $250.
