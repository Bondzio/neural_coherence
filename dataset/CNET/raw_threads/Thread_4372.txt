This will require opening the case and it does draw from your already limited PSU. Another solution is an external device. This has the advantage of; being completely portable, eliminating the need for opening up the case, having its own power supply. I use an ATI TV Wonder USB 2.0 capture device. Here is a link to one review that gives some pretty good info on the device. http://www.trustedreviews.com/article.aspx?page=1570&head=0

But you have many other posts so this post doesn't fall on that side of the fence. Thanks for posting the information and let me share I've used many versions of ATI and Hauppaugge products over the years with equal success and aspirin consumption with both makes. Bob
