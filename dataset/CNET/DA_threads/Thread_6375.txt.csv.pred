1.1.1	I feel so embarassed.	St
1.1.2	I have searched high and low for a straight answer but I can't seem to work out how to create a home wireless network in my house.	St
1.1.3	I don't know whether it's so easy it's not published anywhere or whether I'm missing something or what but I can't find what I think I'm looking for and it's so common I feel embarassed.	St
1.1.4	So I turn to you guys.	St
1.1.5	Apologies if you think I'm an idiot but please help me out, I am for real.	Sug
1.1.6	I have a PC running Windows XP upstairs with a wireless adapter.	St
1.1.7	If a machine is to act as like a server then this is the one I'd want it to be.	St
1.1.8	Downstairs I have a Netgear wireless router which is plugged into my DSL line, acting as the modem my crappy ISP gave me for free.	St
1.1.9	With an ethernet cable I have my Xbox plugged in to this.	St
1.1.10	Then I also roam the house with a laptop running Windows Vista.	St
1.1.11	Oh and my flat mate also has a laptop running Windows XP.	St
1.1.12	All I want to do is set up a home network, wireless of course, that enables me to see all devices (PC, laptop, and Xbox) on the network, from each machine.	St
1.1.13	I want to be able to transfer files between machines over the network and be able to communicate with my Xbox from my PC or laptop.	St
1.1.14	I would also like my flat mate to be able to tap into the network when he likes so we can transfer files between our computers.	St
1.1.15	I plan on hooking up a printer to the router at a later stage for shared printing too.	St
1.1.16	That's it.	St
1.1.17	That's all I want to do.	St
1.1.18	Is that so hard?	St
1.1.19	So what I'm after is a step-by-step guide on configuring this.	St
1.1.20	If someone could point me in the right direction I would be eternally grateful.	St
1.1.21	Thanks for your time	St
1.2.1	The step by step is still only a GUIDE and will never match exactly what you see on the screen.	St
1.2.2	I hope this explains that issue well enough for you.	St
1.2.3	As to your issue today, you omitted the part names, models, makes, how it's connected so there is little more I can offer except to note that the usual cause of not seeing file and printer shares are FIREWALL settings.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks.	St
1.3.2	Could you point me in the direction of them guides then please?	St
1.4.1	If you look to the top of this forum http://forums.cnet.com/5204-7589_102-0.html?forumID=62 Networking & wireless we have a forum sticky about suggested settings.	St
1.4.2	Your router maker's web site will have the manuals and more guides.	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	I use a program called Network Magic that automates many of the functions you are attempting to do.	St
