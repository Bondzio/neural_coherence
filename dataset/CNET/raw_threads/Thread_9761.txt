With the Powerbook my habit was to rarely turn the computer off; I just put it to sleep. In the last year that I used it, the computer would sometimes go to sleep, sometimes literally between keystrokes, and I would be unable to wake it, had to pull the battery, unplug the power cord, and then hit the power button to turn it off, then could turn it back on again. Occasionally it would go to sleep while it was powering up. The problem most often occurred when I was using the computer at close to its limits with respect to ambient air temperature, that is, it was in the 90s or 50s F. Is there any connection between continually using sleep mode instead of turning the computer off and problems with sleep?

Although you did not actually define 'sleep' can we assume that it just froze in the middle of what it was doing or did it go black and quiet? I don't believe there is a connection between using the Sleep function and not turning off the computer P

I failed to mention that sometimes I was able to wake it from these sleeps by hitting keys continuously for anything from a few seconds to a few minutes, but all too often it just would not wake up, and then I would power it off as I described above and then power it up again. Thanks for the answer.
