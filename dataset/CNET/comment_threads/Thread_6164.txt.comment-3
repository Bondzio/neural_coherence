If I were to remove the back casing of the monitor, (leaving the monitor screen and front casing attached) I wouldn't be able to paint it?
I don't see how this would change the way the monitor dissipates heat.
The holes in the top would remain there.
I could maybe even mount, say a 80 mm fan in the very back to keep it cool.
I'm not sure how I could go about doing this, but any hints or links in the right direction would be much appreciated.
I have been googling for a couple hours and no luck yet .
