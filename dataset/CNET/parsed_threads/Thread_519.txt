<s> I am having the same problem as dinadozer in the ''Cannot view computer in workgroup'' and also have tried disableing zone alarm and have logical drives setup for file/print sharing. </s>
<s> My network has been functional for 2 to3 years, loss of networking has become only a very recent problem. </s>
<s> I have checked for viruses, spyware, and have kept zone alarm, avg AV, ad-aware, microsoft's anti spyware, spy-bot up to date. </s>
<s> I've also checked for rootkits. </s>
<s> It doesn't matter which pair of 3 computers I have networked, 2 win2k computers or 1 win2k and 1 XP the target computer can not be seen in network places. </s>
<s> I have tried windows help and the last step said that microsoft had done all it could to resolve the problem. </s>
<s> The last step in windows networking troubleshooter deals with the tracert command. </s>
<s> My network contains a satellite server, one print server, and two computers. </s>
<s> The satellite has a required address of 192.168.0.1 and the print server has a required address of 192.168.0.10. </s>

<s> your other computer in network place...? </s>
<s> Since your machines are not in some DNS (server) pathping can't resolve the names. </s>
<s> No failure in my book. </s>
<s> -&gt; The network neighborhood is full of issues. </s>
<s> No fix is forthcoming and if you want to spend the money on the phone with support, so be it. </s>
<s> However if I want to look at shares and machines I use the COMMAND LINE. </s>
<s> Such as... NET VIEW And the other net commands. </s>
<s> Feel free to rant that the Network Neighborhood needs work. </s>

<s> I had to go into the firewall section and put my home network range in the trusted zones and then it worked perfectly. </s>

<s> As far as pinging the whole network from either computer that has been covered in the original post. </s>

<s> I have also tried temp killing zone alarm, also my av. </s>
<s> To be internet safe, I did this with the satellite server de-powered. </s>
<s> Thanks for the suggestion, though. </s>
<s> One thing that I forgot to mention to Bob was this problem first showed up after Sony had me reatore the sony XP to its factory state. </s>
<s> When I broached this subject to a Sony 2nd tier rep, he gave up and said that networking was not their expertise and that I sould hire a local &quot;networking specialist&quot; to aid me. </s>
<s> Frankly the last 2 &quot;specialists&quot; created more problems that they solved. </s>
<s> Well, I shall keep my fingers crossed and keep trying. </s>
<s> Thanks again..Charles </s>
<s> As a rule I don't duplicate web content. </s>
<s> These are volunteer forums so I leave you to read about this. </s>

<s> I have made some progress. </s>
<s> I checked the local area connection properties on both computers and the soyo had netbeui protocol. </s>
<s> The other one did not so I added that to the other computer. </s>
<s> From the ''computerties'' computer, I can now see the soyo computer. </s>
<s> When I open workgroup, I get a msg that the Soyo computer is not accessible &gt; Password has expired. </s>
<s> I don't use passwords, so what do I do now? </s>
<s> Have resolved the network issue from the soyodragon computer. </s>
<s> Opened sharing for C & D drives on both computers and removed the share names of C$ and D$ and replaced them with C-Drive and D-Drive and the soyodragon is now seeing and opening files and drives on the other computer and copying files. </s>
<s> So one computer is fine now. </s>
<s> Password error still not resolved as mentioned above. </s>
<s> Clicking properties in workgroup of the soyodragon computer icon (in computerties windows explorer) returns the msg that I do not have proper access rights. </s>
<s> Contact administrator. </s>
<s> Which is I. </s>
<s> You might need a same username in the win2k computer. </s>
<s> If your pc have a username A, then you need to have a user name (A) in your win2k computer. </s>
<s> Just for testing, make a username (let's say A) in all the computer. </s>
<s> (when you ask for username/password, in the network plcace, use that name) </s>
<s> I need a little clarification here. </s>
<s> The pair of computers that I am trying to network right now are both win2k, which I will ''rename'' Old and New (for this discussion) . </s>
<s> The New computer sees, opens, and transfers files to the Old. </s>
<s> The Old sees,but can not open the network because of the error of expired password (?). </s>
<s> Are you suggesting that I rename each computer the same name so that one computer is named ''Old'' and the other computer is named ''Old'' also?? </s>
<s> I will retain the different urls, though. </s>
<s> A trial won't take long and if I've got you wrong then let me know. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Does have its passwords expire. </s>
<s> Fix? </s>
<s> Logon as admin.. and set the password to never expire if that's your choice. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> its only password expired. </s>
<s> What I mean by having a same name.. </s>
<s> I mean you need to have a same USER name on the computer .. not the computer name. </s>
<s> User name has been the same though most of the time I simply log in as administrator. </s>
<s> Changing the password took care of the problem. </s>
<s> Thanks to all. </s>
