I have a Motorola Surfboard Modem that is connected to my DD-WRT 54G Wireless Router. If I put in my external IP address in the browser while connected to my wireless network, It directs me to the correct Local IP that I have it set to. If I try to access it outside my network it just times out and says &quot;Response Error. Technical Description: 502 Bad Gateway - Response error, a bad response was received from another proxy server or the destination origin server&quot; Any ideas of what I can look for? Thanks!

You didn't share what you mean by access so I can't tell if this is a FTP, Telnet or other type of access. Because of problems that occur with &quot;users&quot; many ISPs now block network sharing ports. Bob

It is going to my Raspberry Pi that I have running Raspbmc (XBMC). I have tried using different ports because like you said they block access certain ports. I wonder why I am able to connect within my network using my external IP though, that seems strange to me.

This leads me to believe it's an issue with the PI and not the network. I will have to do more research. I can connect to the pi by it's internal IP address however so I am not sure why I can't connect by port forwarding.
