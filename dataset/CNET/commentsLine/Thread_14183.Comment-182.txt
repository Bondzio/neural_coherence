the first personal computer i had was an ibm pc.
i worked with them at work too and we had a couple of tandy 1500's.
we ended up standardizing on the ibm.
i ended up with a pc xt-286 that i ran the legs off and upgraded the motherboard to one with an amd 386-40. that sucker ran all the way until i built my own box with a pentium 166 mmx a number of years later.
the only reason i replaced it was because it just wasn't quite fast enough.
it was bulletproof otherwise... never a bit of trouble.
