here is the problem.
occasionally, my computer will not boot.
when this happens, it appears to be caused by the boot hard drive not being recognized.
when this occurs, if i restart it several times, the drive will get recognized and then i can boot to xp professional sp2.
when i am in xp, i can work for a while but then the pc freezes.
i can still see the display on the monitor, but everything is completely frozen.
i have to reboot.
when i reboot, most of the time the boot hard drive isn't recognized and (as mentioned above), i have to reboot several times.
sometimes, i just have to let it sit over night.
i originally thought it could be a heat issue.
however, it happens on a fresh boot after sitting all day.
here are some specs: - windows xp pro sp2 - 2 seagate sata drives (&lt; 2 years old) - no raid, just connected via sata - 1.5 gigs of ddr ram what i have done: - ran windows defender - came up clean - ran avg antivirus scan - came up clean - recently reformatted boot drive
