<s> I just downloaded and used `speed fan' because I was concerned with the heat rising from the top of my rig. </s>
<s> A blackbird 002 01b. </s>
<s> The CPU and other temps are at 41c. </s>
<s> The ram is at 75c. </s>
<s> The ram is not liquid cooled and I believe this could be a fatal flaw in the design. </s>
<s> Any ideas on this kind of thing? </s>
<s> Seems like HP/VOODOO did not quite get their homework right. </s>
<s> I could put the dominator ram fans in there, but this should be hp`s responsability. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> The system monitoring s/w is only as accurate as the sensor is. </s>
<s> In most cases only those with sensors give a approx. </s>
<s> value. </s>
<s> Last, I recall no memory has sensors attached, so its getting that info 2nd hand. </s>
<s> Next, the system is running and that being the case, its doing it job. </s>
<s> If you want to cool it better then that's your option to do so. </s>
<s> What you should do if it isn't already to route harnesses/wiring/cables to reduce airflow interference, thus be cooler. </s>
<s> As for HPVOODOO systems not doing their job, that's debatable, but I'm not here for that. </s>
<s> If it running OK, don't fix it, IMHO, except of course add cooling if you want. </s>

<s> the RAM temp is accurate....infrared thermometer would be easiest. </s>
<s> If the temp as indicated is accurate ... then I'd check the BIOS for speed and voltage settings. </s>
<s> Hoping that will solve the problem. </s>
<s> Let us know. </s>

<s> I was a little hasty in my `prognosis'. </s>
<s> However; I have had nothing but problems with this `bird'. </s>
<s> Over 4 mos. </s>
<s> in the shop. </s>
<s> Emails galore. </s>
<s> One tech says mobo, another say not. </s>
<s> I have switched the GPUs, (at the prompt from the tech). </s>
<s> One of the fans, southbridge or north. </s>
<s> I`m not sure, keeps falling off. </s>
<s> I`m supposed to get a new one delivered but I still wait. </s>
<s> I`m going to get a digital pyrometer and check the temps again. </s>
<s> PS. </s>
<s> After shut down, the usb ports on the `bird' are allways `live'. </s>
<s> Is this normal? </s>
<s> Every pc I own, have owned and including friends pcs. </s>
<s> None of them have power to the usb ports when the rig is off. </s>
<s> I got this rig last Nov. </s>
<s> This is not right. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Gone to get a digital pyrometer as soon as I can. </s>
<s> I still dont think 79c is normal operating temp. </s>
<s> Trying to get answers reminds me of `Davinci code'. </s>
<s> why it's important to make sure the reading is accurate before going further. </s>
<s> Good luck getting the problems straightened out...and keep us posted. </s>
<s> VAPCMD PS...here's a link to a good infrared thermometer that can be used to troubleshoot PC or non-PC heat related problems. </s>
<s> http://www.amazon.com/Fluke-62-Mini-Infrared-Thermometer/dp/B000MX5Y9C </s>
<s> Thanks for the link. </s>
<s> I wish I still had my Fluke multimeter. </s>
<s> $900 went for a walk. </s>
<s> I`ll let you know. </s>
<s> Sorry for the delayed reply... Well any fan that falls off isn't a good thing. </s>
<s> Plus, even before it falls, it maybe not 100% seated or unsettling factor to keep it where it suppose to be. </s>
<s> These extreme machines just don't like losing any cooling and the results will be as you find. </s>
<s> Certainly, that has to be corrected. </s>
<s> The plain fact is, if you can further cool the system, it will be a plus for you. </s>
<s> Add extra fans or switch over to water cooling, etc.. USB ports shouldn't be active in that actually still do something in any big way. </s>
<s> BUT, they are still powered, the LEDs you see lit probably are just a minor side effect of keeping the system &quot;at the ready&quot; maybe from a wake-up/hibernate&quot; state or awaiting a hot key from the kybd., that's a power setting issue(or bios), you may want to review that. </s>
<s> However, its not going to hurt the system and in some cases you may do more harm delving into all those power setting. </s>
<s> If you like, keep it simple place system on a power strip(surge protection?) </s>
<s> and when done, just switch it off provided you did a proper shutdown. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
