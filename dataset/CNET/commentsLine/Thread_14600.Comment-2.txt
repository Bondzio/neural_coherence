visiting the website you offered, a poster there made the point, it has loud operating fan, maybe too noisy.
if that's the case, the cause is the fan.
it can be unbalanced or simply too cheap of a fan installed.
however, smaller fans will be loud if they operate in high rpms.
better quality fans even if high rpms are quieter and made from metal generally are noiseless if one can even find one nowadays.
-or- the clicking noise is a poor component starting to breakdown but hasn't failed yet or even a dusty fan.
