Just installed a PCI based video card in my older desktop so that I can run dual monitors (one's on a serial port, the other is DVI).
I'm wondering if there is anyway to ALSO use the OEM/stock video chipset to run a third monitor at the same time on the original serial port?
We're using windows 7 here, if that helps.
