More than one copy.
Your posts so far appear to indicate it would be the only copy.
As to wear out, I've only seen a few fail.
Very rare but not unheard of.
One was an accident where they stepped on it while plugged in.
Another just stopped working.
-&gt; With DVD recordable media being less than a buck, keep a few extras of what you can't lose.
There is a deep study about archival storage on such media if you need it from NIST.
