1.1.22	- Brand name - SATA II - Aluminum - Has a good fan - Has vent holes - Prevents vibration/shock - Quiet fan - Good chipset - Internal: SATA, External: USB	St
1.2.1	Even the units made by WD, Maxtor.	St
1.2.2	Let me note this item you listed &quot;Prevents vibration/shock&quot;.	St
1.2.3	That would have to include a sensor to tell the drive to park.	St
1.2.4	Outside of a few laptops nothing has this.	St
1.2.5	You may see such in a few years but not today.	St
1.2.6	Best of luck, Bob	St
1.3.1	Newegg.com....they've got an excellent search engine for their products.	St
1.3.2	Not sure it makes anything faster with a 3.0GB SATA as the max USB 2.0 transfer rate is limited to 480Mb/s.	St
1.3.3	This one might work ...if you can find it in stock http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817145390	St
1.4.1	Their list exceeds what I see in such devices today.	St
1.4.2	Bob	St
1.5.1	Shock sensors...haven't seen any with them.	St
1.5.2	But for the right price...I'm sure someone could add shock sensors and maybe even shock absorbers.	Sug
1.5.3	Only problem it would be so expensive, no one would buy.	St
1.5.4	VAPCMD	St
1.6.1	While admirable for the list, to prevent such shocks and more, the unit would almost need to have Artificial Intelligence with video sensors and legs to move out of the way of an oncoming collision.	St
1.6.2	Bob	St
1.7.1	NIL	St
