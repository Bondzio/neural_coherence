Is there anyway I can over ride the printers settings and get it to print red and blue images regardless of the fact the black cartridge is empty? Of course I could just get the black ink but it's Sunday evening and I need the documents to be ready tomorrow morning. Any ideas?

You might try removing the cartrige and putting it back, then tell the printer you put in a new one.

I was handling a Epson Stylus 400 about 6 years ago, and it had an option of synthesizing black from the 3 colors. If I remember right, this option was available in the epson icon on the control panel. Of course, it was an Win95 OS. Hope this helps.

I do not have an Epson, so I am not too sure, but at printer's properties, is there an option for auto detect of color or manual detect ? Or you may be able to shut down ink level monitoring....Or you can try removing the black ink catridge, reboot, put it back in, go to maintenance and reset the counter....?
