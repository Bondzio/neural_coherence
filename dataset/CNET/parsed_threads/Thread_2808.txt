<s> Sound plays through only one of two speakers. </s>
<s> Pull the jack halfway out and the first speaker goes silent and the quiet speaker starts to play. </s>
<s> Sound quality is O.K. </s>
<s> Obviously a dead spot there. </s>
<s> What part do I buy to fix this problem? </s>
<s> Not the sound card is it? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Sounds like you are using a &quot;mono&quot; sound cable and not a &quot;stereo&quot; sound cable. </s>
<s> If so, the solution is to use a stereo cable. </s>
<s> Count the number of black (or green) rings on the 1/8&quot; (Sony) ending: 1 ring = mono 2 rings = stereo Even if you have a stereo cable, it may be faulty, so try another stereo cable. </s>
<s> Does another source, such as an iPod, CD player, Walkman, etc. </s>
<s> work with the speakers? </s>
<s> No, it's a stereo cable that works fine on another box. </s>
<s> I'm asking what part inside the hole do I need to buy. </s>
<s> Is it a whole sound card or just a loose wire on the jack or a terminal on the card or.............. </s>
<s> speakers behaving like that can be caused by one of two things: a faulty audio cable or a faulty line-in jack if its the former try using a different cable or swapping speakers. </s>
<s> if its the latter, you've hit a dead-end. </s>
<s> you either replace the card or take it to service. </s>
<s> sorry but there's no user servicable part on an audio card. </s>
<s> Thanks,Jen. </s>
<s> Now I know why I trash pick old computers when I can. </s>
<s> I think the one in the garage has a sound card in it. </s>
