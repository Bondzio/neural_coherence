<s> Hi there, I'm writing from home about my computer at work so I don't have detailed specs. </s>
<s> I just got a new Dell (insert specs here) and I'm trying to connect my older HP PSC. </s>
<s> (insert spec here) New machine has no parallel port, printer has no USB thingie. </s>
<s> Is there any kind of adapter available? </s>
<s> Can't seems to find one online. </s>
<s> Also need a network interface card for DSL (cable is impossible in the old factory where my restaurant is located) USB to PS/2 cables (or the other way around) to connect new CPU to our 10 year old POS so I can use one mouse and keyboard on both machines. </s>
<s> Silly me, I thought I could replace our worn out computer with a spiffy new one and life would be good. </s>
<s> Silly me for not checking out this stuff before I clicked &quot;BUY ME!!! </s>
<s> !&quot; Arrgh. </s>
<s> Thanks, Kim </s>
<s> You need to state (your specs here). </s>
<s> No one can help if left so wide open to at least best guesses. </s>
<s> Check this website or similar for &quot;adapters&quot;. </s>
<s> But beware if you need this many adapters just return the system for a more usable one that already provides this otherwise, time and cost may defeat the whole purpose of the solution of replacement, while you can. </s>
<s> http://www.cyberguys.com http://www.blackbox.com A qucik fix for no parallel(LPT) port is to install a pci type card offering LPT port(s). </s>
<s> The same solution for any DSL link, which maybe best using an ethernet port, if possible one offering m/f ports like LPT, ethernet, and serial. </s>
<s> DSL can work using USb port just be sure that is offered as an link, but this is slow compared to ethernet. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I have an old HP Printer 812c and it works fine with XP that is what it has to be compatible with. </s>
<s> I could not use the instalation CD, I used the drivers that XP gave me. </s>
<s> My HP Computer works just as good with Windows XP as it did with Windows ME. </s>
<s> Good Luck Wendell H </s>
