Your PS3 has DLNA-built into it, which means that a DLNA-server software installed on your PC can stream video, music and photos to your PS3 (which you then can watch/listen to on your TV).
So, all you need to do is connect your PC and PS3 to your home network using Ethernet cable or wireless (Ethernet cable is best, but it you go wireless, choose wireless N if you want to stream HD video).
Once all connected to your home network and you have installed a DLNA server on your PC, you will see the DLNA server's icon appear on your PS3.
On your PS3, you will be able to browse your folders/files and play them as you want.
For DLNA-servers, I'd suggest Mezzmo as it is my favorite after playing with all the others but there are free ones as well.
