the recurring themes are: 1. heat.
remove case cover and try again.
2. memory failure.
try with one stick.
run memory tests from  3. bios is not the latest.
new to pc builders don't understand why a new board wouldn't have the latest bios.
i can't explain it, but unless the bios is latest, you may crash and burn.
4. bios safe defaults until it's up.
5. power.
i still see small power supplies driving big rigs.
easy to test.
just downsize the machine to one hard disk, one stick o'ram, one cd drive, one video card and try again with the case cover off.
6. the worms.
a new install of today's windows will catch a worm infection as soon as you go to install the patches.
drives people insane.
