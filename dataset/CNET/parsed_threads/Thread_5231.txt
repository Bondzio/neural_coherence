<s> When I was close to buying a PC about 4-6 months ago I watched this forum very closely and through a lot of various posts, quetions etc eventually it seemed to be the overall opinion that in terms of memory 512mb was the bare minimum, and one should go for 1.0gb if possible. </s>
<s> PLUS it was noted that stepping up to 2.0 MB did not &quot;get&quot; you that much more. </s>
<s> NOW FOR THE 'DUMB' QUESTION: A lot of those comments were around single core processors (the Intel 500's and 600's or AMD 3200, 3300 etc). </s>
<s> Now that since then Dual Core has really hit the market, and if were to get one I most likely would get a Intel 800 series, does the 1GB comment still apply, or since I have DUAL core do I now need 2.0gb. </s>
<s> I KNOW obviously 2.0gb is always better than 1.0gb, my question is if 1.0gb was enough before, with dual core does that mean I should for the msot part assume I need 2.0gb. </s>
<s> I told youthis may be a stupid question, so I apologize if it is. </s>
<s> By the way, the use of the PC will be for internet, digital photos, basic home video editing and dvd burning, very little gaming and I would bet no major games (HL2 etc) </s>
<s> I have 1 GB, works great. </s>
<s> OK, to your question. </s>
<s> No, it doesn't mean that jumping to 2.0GB will be noticeable just because you have 2 cores.. Not that many programs can even fully utilize those cores, games MIGHT give you an extra fps or two. </s>
<s> 1.0 GB will suffice for a long time... </s>
<s> In 5 years, 2.0 GB MIGHT be on the recommened specs of something powerful like video encoding, but 1.0 will suit you fine. </s>
<s> I have a few friends who took the leap to 1.5 and they said they had a noticeable difference. </s>
<s> Noticeable, but slightly. </s>
<s> hth -Ibrahim P.S. </s>
<s> Every Benchmark I've seen: AMD is on the throne of dual-core. </s>
<s> I'm not fanboy, I have an intel in all my computers, all nine of them. </s>
<s> But my next purchase will indefinitely be an AMD product. </s>
