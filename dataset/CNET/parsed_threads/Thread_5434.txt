<s> I have a Dell 8300 2 years old. </s>
<s> I can only boot into safe mode because I'm having XP Home issues. </s>
<s> I need to move important files (20GB worth - movies and MP3s) to SOMETHING and I'm purchasing an external hard drive soon. </s>
<s> Question is, can I move those files to the external HD when I can only boot to safe mode? </s>
<s> If so, how do I do that? </s>
<s> won't let you access your USB ports. </s>
<s> Unless you get XP working the best thing to do is put that HD in another system as a slave and do your file transfers from there. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> I've been using a KNOPPIX (google.com) boot CD and that let's me copy files out to FAT32 formatted USB hard disks. </s>
