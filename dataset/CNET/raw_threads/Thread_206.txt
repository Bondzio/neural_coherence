Just rencently i purchased a new ati radeon x1600 512 meg PCI-E Graphics card. After i physically installed and booted up i noticed that there was no display on my monitor. So i checked in troubleshooting and they said to upgrade my BIOS. Which is where i am stuck, i cant seem to be able to indentify my motherboard so i can upgrade my BIOS. I cant seem to find the model # on the motherboard or in BIOS. I looked up my computer # on the internet and it says that a new one has a Intel 945G Express mainboard. Would that be the same for a refurbished one? This issue is making me very frusterated, moderator please HELP.
