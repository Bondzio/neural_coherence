thanks for the help.
the system isn't really good enough to run recent games so it shouldn't be a problem, i also have a nvidia tnt2 m64 card in a very similar systemand it works fine.
i've just been looking into this because my intel 740 graphics under xp sometimes gives a narrow picture across the middle of the screen in some full screen apps, i think the driver is the problem as it was fine under 98se and the xp driver is the most recent, nut it doesn't matter now.
thanks, nick
