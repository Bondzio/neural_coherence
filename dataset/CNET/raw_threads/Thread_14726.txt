A friend of mine has a P4 MDG-built, Intel motherboard PC which now cannot power on. It was in this condition at my arrival at the scene of the crime. An inexeperienced individual has been fiddling around with the corrections, and after finishing, the computer allegedly never powered on afterwards. I reconnected all of the loose and missing cables to their correct places, and tested the power supply (using a paperclip to connect green to black wires on the power supply's 24-pin connector). When I plug the 24-pin connector back into the motherboard, the LED on the motherboard and the front of the computer lights up. However when I attempt to power the computer up, nothing happens. Anyone have any ideas? I'm out... Either the mobo is busted and needs to be replaced/fixed, or I missed some connectors? Could it be that the power supply is only half-busted? It could be that the button is not plugged into the right spot (doubtful), but I've tried manually connecting the two pins with a knife, etc. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, sorry for the long message. TIA

Sometimes there is a bad slot on the motherboard, sometimes the memory won't work in certain slots, sometimes it will stop working where it has worked before. If that doesn't work, consider that the only components you need to have connected in order to POST (not boot into Windows) the board are: Power Supply CPU RAM Video Card That's it. Unplug absolutely everything else and use the knife to short the the power pins. If this doesn't work, unplug all the RAM and try it again. Sometimes you have to make the connections between the pins for a couple of seconds. Does the system beep at you when it didn't before? You probably have bad RAM. If it doesn't beep, try putting the RAM back in and taking the video card out, etc. Try a different power supply. Try a different CPU. ood luck

Try this too	Sounds like somethings not right...so look for these problems in no particular order 1 loose memory in slot 2 Loose video card in slot 3 Motherboard has switch plugs. They need to be right backwards won't work on some boards. I don't think it's a bad motherboard if the fans spin sometimes clear CMOS either by jumper or remove battery....

At this point, the HD, CDROM, FLOPPY, and only the POWERSUPPLY-FAN begins to work. I can't get to see the screen run because this way, the motherboard isn't connected, therefor no video card. Could RAM or CPU really be the problem? Surely I would get some sort of response from trying to power on even without it? Thanks again.

Plug the Power supply into the AC outlet [switch on rear on]. No components mounted to mobo, no CPU, no memory, no nuttin. With the 24 pin power supply cable connected, simply use the tip of a small flat screwdriver to momentarily [very momentary] short the two Front Power switch pins on the mobo together. The supply should turn on [its fan rotates] and stay on. You can turn it off by shorting the pins again, possibly need to hold for 4 to five seconds to shut it off. If the supply does not turn on the mobo is bad. One should do this test when first removing the mobo from the box and before mounting anything. If the supply doesn't turn on at this point things ain't going to get any better.
