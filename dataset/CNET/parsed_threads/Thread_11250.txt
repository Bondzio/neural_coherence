<s> Is there anyway to share a printer when one computer is dialed into a VPN network and the other one is not (Outside of swapping the USB cable back and forth). </s>
<s> I have a work computer and a personal computer at home that share the monitor/keyboard/mouse and would also like it if they could share the printer. </s>
<s> Both systems run Win XP pro and access the internet via a netgear router(wireless but both are hardwired). </s>
<s> My work computer has wireless but my personal does not. </s>
<s> If I added a print server could my work computer access it via wireless(while still on VPN) while my personal used USB? </s>
<s> Thanks for any help. </s>
<s> If you allowed such, VPN would have a security hole. </s>
<s> Think it over and over and over and you'll understand why a VPN drops other network connections. </s>
<s> But you can plug the printer directly to the VPN'd machine and print. </s>
<s> Nothing broken... Bob </s>
<s> What about a USB hub, splitter, or something so that I could plug both computers into 1 printer? </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> Such USB sharing ports, splitters and such cost just as much as some printers. </s>
<s> Try justifying this with a little math. </s>

<s> A bluetooth printer. </s>
<s> Sadly this is not cheap. </s>
<s> Could be more than another printer. </s>
<s> How would bluetooth be any different then adding on a wireless print server? </s>
<s> Not that money is no object but for the convenience I wouldn't have a problem spending $100. </s>
<s> As such, VPN would not block its use. </s>

<s> Found a USB share switch that pretty much does the trick. </s>
<s> Allows you to connect 1 device to several PC's. </s>
<s> Does not switch automatically when needed but provides a hot key that makes it pretty easy. </s>
<s> If you have two computers running Win XP pro on the same Router, all you need to do is enable file/print sharing on both computers (Use the Network Setup Wizard) and as long as the computer with the printer on it is on, the other will have access to it. </s>
<s> That would work if I was not connected to my VPN. </s>
<s> That's why I started this thread. </s>
<s> Without the VPN its easy. </s>
