MMMM i would go for the hp HP a6030n with AMD Athlon 64 X2 dual-core processor 4800+ Graphics NVIDIA GeForce 6150 SE First th processor is the same speed it may differ a little bit but the Intel graphics arent recommended however i experiences the 6150 LE video card and it can run new games with considerble graphics but look if u are looking for gaming i dont recommend HP
