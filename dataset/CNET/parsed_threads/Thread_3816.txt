<s> Hi, I have 2 toshiba laptops both operating on xp and have wireless network setup. </s>
<s> I am able to get on the internet with both but I can only check email on one of them. </s>
<s> I am using hotmail as email account and when i log in and wait for it to open my mailbox, i get a page cannot be displayed error. </s>
<s> Anyone have any trouble shooting ideas. </s>
<s> I have tried my gmail account also to no avail on the one machine so i don't think it is the email provider something with my settings on the one laptop. </s>
<s> Any ideas greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks, Doug </s>
<s> Is it up to date? </s>
<s> hi, i am using a linksys router that i just bought last week at best buy so i would assume everything would be up to date? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Can't assume that. </s>
<s> Latest Version: 4.20.7 Release date: 8/25/2005 The mfg. </s>
<s> could have boxed your router months ago. </s>
<s> If it is the router's software, why would hotmail and other email work on my other computer??? </s>
<s> wouldn't it be all or nothing? </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> Some webpages, including free webmail sites, have objects in them (javascript, activeX, etc.) </s>
<s> that have the potential to install/behave like malware. </s>
<s> There are software routines in your computer that can be blocking these (antispyware, firewalls, etc.). </s>
<s> Routers often contain firewalls and filters, too. </s>
<s> R. Proffit was wise in recommending a firmware upgrade. </s>
<s> At least you can eliminate the router's firmware in your troubleshooting. </s>
<s> In Internet Options, what happens when you clear all cookies and delete files (offline files, too)? </s>
<s> That new meant you didn't have to check the firmware. </s>
<s> In short since I've already noted the firmware must be checked... </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> The MTU may be too high and email retrieval will fail for some. </s>
<s> To fix this issue, the newer firmware addresses this so you don't have to. </s>
<s> Let's remove the firmware from the probable list of causes. </s>
