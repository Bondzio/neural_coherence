For LG, GSA-E30L (18x) is the current model.
For Lite-on, SHW-160P6SU (16x EZ-Dub) and LH-20A1HX (20x) are current.
Unless you're getting a real bargain price (&lt;$60), get a current model since they'll have better media compatibility.
As for Philips, they're not a major manufacturer (mostly they just relabel components built by someone else) and wouldn't consider them over LG or LiteOn.
