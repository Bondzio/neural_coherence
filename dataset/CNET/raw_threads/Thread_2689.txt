In order to route speaker to back panel the manual says to place jumpers in 3 locations. I also need to place jumpers on 2 locations for my BIOS. My board came with 3 little blue plastic things already placed on some of these locations (not the correct ones according to the manual). My problem is that I have removed them and I forgot how they were installed. On one side of the plastic thing is 2 holes and on the other is 3 holes. It seems to fit both ways. Which way is correct? Also, the board only came with 3 and according to the manual I need 5. Can someone please tell me if I am missing something here or where I can obtain more of these little plastic things. Thank you in advance. Mike

The site says that I only need to set 3 jumpers while the manual says 5. Ive double checked and the manual I have is correct, D865PERL. The website makes more sense as my mobo only came with 3 jumper blocks or whatever they are called. Please help clarify.

The blue thingees are the &quot;jumpers&quot; just configure to the way you want the audio connected or setup. Look at the picture/graphic in manual and &quot;usually&quot; the way they show it is the default setting. Why you moved other jumpers for the audio portion doesn't make sense. In other words, &quot;just what are you trying to do&quot;? for what you want. My experience has shown the latest info is gotten from the website, so d/l the new manual or help guide and use that. Just be sure you're reading the guide for the proper mtrbd. model. The jumper itself, connects two pins, use the side that has two holes. Unlss Intel is using some new jumper I suggest to proceed with common sense. good luck -----Willy
