sorry, to hear of the negative results.
not knowing all the details(pictures) it may provide some clue.
understand there maybe small connections or harness unconnected in small way or somehow compromised.
attention to detail becomes very important and also if any &quot;short&quot; is present, can you power, &quot;on&quot; with case open or adjust to do this to check results?
since, it come down to playing with it.
