1.1.1	These 2 monitors are on eBay for the EXACT same price ($119.99w/free shipping), and I would like to know which would be the best bang for my buck.	St
1.1.2	Again, they are the ASUS VE228H, and the VIEWSONIC VX2250WM.	St
1.1.3	Please DO NOT recommend me ANY other monitor, unless YOU can find it in the same price range.	Sug
1.1.4	If you can find a better monitor with DVI, HDMI inputs and a 1080p resolution under $119 altogether then PLEASE tell me.	St
1.1.5	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	I never would buy a monitor without having seen it in a store.	St
1.2.2	I think both brands are great although I have a slight personal preference for Asus.	St
1.2.3	When you buy on ebay, I assume you're buying a used monitor which is something I would definitely avoid.	St

1.2.5	` Good luck.	St
1.3.1	I've been on eBay for a while now.	St
1.3.2	And trust me, when I see most used items, I only bite if I see detailed pictures and detailed descriptions.	St
1.3.3	BOTH, of these used monitors provide that, and they have a top rated seller seal too.	St
1.3.4	I'll provide the links so you can see for yourself.	St
1.3.5	I don't need any advice really (no disrespect intended).	St
1.3.6	And since these monitors are not in current mainstream, my local stores would not have them to view.	St
1.3.7	I would just like someones though on the specs for each monitor.	St
1.3.8	I am not very knowledgeable when it comes to monitor specs.	St
1.3.9	So at least, please, look up the specs for each monitor and tell me which one comes out on top.	St

1.5.6	Please do.	St
1.5.7	I'm open to question.	St
