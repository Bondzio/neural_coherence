sata drives have nothing to do with the master/slave designation of ide drives.
if your secondary hd (the ide drive) is connected to the end of a cable that has 2 connectors on it, then it should be a master (or cs).
if the ide cable has only a single connector (you have to remove the cd drive to attach the secondary hd), then attach the secondary drive as a master (or cs).
