<s> Can someone give a simple approach to erasing DVD-RW's? </s>
<s> I've tried Nero but it looks for a CD-R instead. </s>
<s> I've tried CloneCD as recommended in a Google search but that seems to be a 50/50 chance of working. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> The Nero that came with my DVD recorder seems to work well. </s>
<s> A click on some &quot;more&quot; item on the botton and the &quot;erase disk&quot; button. </s>
<s> I can't write more, since that's all there is. </s>
