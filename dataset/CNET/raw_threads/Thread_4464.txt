System running XP, existing HDD 40GB IDE 0, CD drive, DVD burner dual Layer. New HDD to be used as storage. Thank, in advance.

If the old drive is set for CS (cable select), set the new one the same. If the old drive is set to master, set the new drive to slave. Done. You'll now need to have XP recognize the drive. Go to Control Panel and click Administrative Tools, then click Computer Management. On the left, click Disk Management. Locate the new drive on the right. Doing this from memory now, but there should be an option on the new drive to activate it or such. And to format it to get it ready for use.
