1.1.1	ok so my new computer ran fine for two days , then next day I randomly get BSOD , usually memory management error then 0x0000001a ...	St
1.1.2	So I figured it was the memory .	St
1.1.3	Uped voltage and made sure ram timings were where they were supposed to be , still BSOD randomly ... then I put different memory in from another PC which has been running stable , still BSOD on this machine.. switched the power supply.. no luck .	St
1.1.4	Updated video drivers.. and yet still no luck .	St
1.1.5	all tempuratures are cool..	St
1.1.6	I have no idea what the problem could be .	Res
1.1.7	Is it possible its software related ?	Ques
1.1.8	I installed Steam , WoW , and UT3 , first 2 days they ran stable.. should I just reinstall windows with totally different drivers ?	Ques
1.1.9	what could this be ?	Ques
1.1.10	btw , eventlog had some warnings about TCip or something not quite sure , but they were not the same time it BSOD ?	Ques
1.1.11	my motherboard is a BIOSTAR NF61S TE AM2	St
1.2.1	tests ... .memtest86+ ?	Ques
1.2.2	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	I have , but the BSOD are to random and frequent to be accurate , it gets through with no errors til it BSOD , but its always at different times .	St
1.3.2	and like I said I tested with another pair of memory sticks out of a working stable computer , and upped the voltage ( 2.0v ) along with tinkering and timings , even lowered spped to 667mhz with both pairs , BSOD seemed to happening just as frequent .	St
1.3.3	and no nothing is overclocked	St
1.4.1	I see & quot ; new & quot ; which means WARRANTY .	St
1.4.2	Be sure to ask the makers , suppliers for support or exchange of any , all parts involved .	St
1.4.3	- & gt ; I wonder if this is a home built .	St
1.4.4	If so tell me about the CPU heatsink compound you used and how you knew to up the RAM voltage .	St
1.4.5	Did the BIOS get the setting wrong ?	Ques
1.4.6	How did you know ?	Ques
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	I knew to up the voltage and correct the timings because I fixed many computers before , just never seen an issue like this .	St
1.5.2	I figured it out though , it was service pack 2 , I reinstalled windows , this time X64 edition , loaded drivers , been running stable since , did memtest overnight no errors , then prime 95 for 5 hours no probs .	St
1.5.3	thanks	Polite
1.6.1	I am finding those that build there own are hemorrhaging at repair counters as out of date BIOS do n't get the memory voltage and timings automatically right anymore .	St
1.6.2	What 's the opposite of progress ?	Ques
