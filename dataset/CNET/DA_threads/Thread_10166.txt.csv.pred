1.1.1	Hi there I took out the HDD ( Toshiba MK1516GAP 15GB ATA-2/3/4 2.5 & quot ; 9.5mm Hard Drive ) from an old vaio notebook and put it into a 2.5 external casing ( usb ) to use as portable storage .	St
1.1.2	When all is connected windows recognizes the drive i.e as a toshiba and its size .	St
1.1.3	Now the problem arises when i try to read from or write to the drive .	St
1.1.4	For the first few minutes ( 5min ) after i plug in the usb cable i seem to be able to read and write to the drive .	St
1.1.5	Then after i keep getting the following message : Windows -Delayed Write Failed -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Windows was unable to save all the data for the file ( path of file ) .	St
1.1.6	The data has been lost .	St
1.1.7	This error may be caused by a failure of your computer hardware or network connection .	St
1.1.8	Please try to save this file elsewhere .	Sug
1.1.9	When i then try to access the drive i get this : I : \ is not accessible The request could not be performed because of an I/O device error Any help given would be very much appreciated	St
1.2.1	Did you find a resolution to this problem .	St
1.2.2	cheers Mark mcs @ modnet.com.au	Polite
1.3.1	I had a similar situation with an external HDD .	St
1.3.2	My mobo has a USB 1x , I used a USB 2x plugin card .	St
1.3.3	It worked fine for a few days before this problem cropped up .	St
1.3.4	It happened on both XP and 98 !	St
1.3.5	Finally , I got rid of the plugin card and started to use the mobo USB .	St
1.3.6	No prob , no speed .	St
1.3.7	I think it could have been a hardware failure .	St
1.3.8	Not sure .	Res
1.3.9	Waiting for more info ... ...	St
1.4.1	I have a seagate 120 GB external hard disk in a sarotech hardbox external casing .	St
1.4.2	I was able to access the data in my external HD yesterday and today i keep getting the Delay Write Fail error as well .	St
1.4.3	Any idea how to resolve this problem ?	Ques
1.5.1	Open a command prompt to run CHKDSK .	St
1.5.2	For me the command is ... CHKDSK T : /F /X If the drive needs to be checked later , answer yes .	St
1.5.3	- & gt ; This will also occur if the drive is full to the brim .	St
1.5.4	Remove a GB and see if that and CHKDSK helps .	St
1.5.5	If not , find the drive fitness test and do n't trust this drive .	St
1.5.6	Bob	St
1.6.1	turns out , the problem lies on the usb wire .	St
1.6.2	Changed it and it works again .	St
1.6.3	Thanks for your suggestion though .	Polite

1.8.1	SOLVED ( for me , anyway ) : I also was having the & quot ; Delayed Write Failed & quot ; issue on XP Pro SP2 with my new Buffalo DriveStation Duo 1TB system .	St
1.8.2	I tried it in both Fat32 and NTFS modes as well as in RAID1 and as two independent drives , but would continue to randomly get this error message - mostly on writing large ( & gt ; 500MB ) files but occasionally on reads as well .	St
1.8.3	Finally - due to the suggestion in this thread about the USB wire - I switched the connection of this unit from a USB wire to a 1394 wire ( fortunately my laptop had this port ) and the errors finally cleared up .	St
1.9.1	I 'm having the same error message on my external hard drive as well , but I only have a USB2 port coming from the external case .	St
1.9.2	Does anyone have any suggestions ?	Ques
1.9.3	Thanks	Polite
1.10.1	Try the above fixes .	St
