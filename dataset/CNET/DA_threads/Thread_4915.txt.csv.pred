1.1.1	My Gateway has an onboard graphics chip .	St
1.1.2	I wanted to upgrade it so I bought an XFX 8600GT PCI Express Nvideo card .	St
1.1.3	It worked for about 5 months , then it died .	St
1.1.4	I could still hook up the monitor to the onboard graphics chip and it worked .	St
1.1.5	Next , I bought a Sapphire 8650 PCI Express ATI card .	St
1.1.6	It worked fine about 3 weeks and then it failed .	St
1.1.7	Again I can still hook up the monitor to the onboard graphics chip , but of course its graphic capabilities are slow .	St
1.1.8	Can my motherboard be frying graphic cards ?	Ques
1.1.9	I am afraid to buy another one for fear it will fry after a couple of days .	St
1.1.10	I returned the XFX card under warranty and eventually they will send me another and I can try that one , but who knows how long that will last .	St
1.1.11	Anybody has any ideas ?	Ques
1.2.1	My hunch is power supply , that you 're under-powering the system .	St
1.2.2	I recently replaced a stock PSU in a Gateway .	St
1.2.3	It rated 300W .	St
1.2.4	Graphics cards like you 're describing may prefer 400-450W .	St
1.2.5	It might be heat , too .	St
1.2.6	Keep the insides of your tower clean , and be sure it 's where it can breathe ok .	St
1.3.1	Go to gateways web site and go to support , select type of computer and find your model .	St
1.3.2	It will list EVERYTHING about your ride , including power supply .	St
1.3.3	Most gateways have a 300 watt PSU .	St
1.3.4	The fx and a few multi-media will have 400 watters .	St
