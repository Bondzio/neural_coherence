1) Do I have the connection speed and connection reliability to play these games?
and 2) Does the games company I'm using have the hardware necessary to provide me with smooth and reliable service.
Are they currently hardware &quot;up to date&quot; or lagging well behind?
I'm making two important points here for those that might understand.
