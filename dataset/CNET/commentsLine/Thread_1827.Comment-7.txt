why i'm going to answer no each time is simply this.
dsl providers are giving the new customers free dsl modems with wifi routers and the 10/100 switch units.
there is no incentive to make one with gigabit switches.
however you can bet you'll get better performance if you add your own gigabit external switch.
i would not look for the product you asked for since the market is non-existent (save for you.)
