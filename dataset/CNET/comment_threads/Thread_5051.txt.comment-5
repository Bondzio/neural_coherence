I don't like fixing my friend's computers that have suffered such damage since the unit could decide to turn into a brick just by removing the case.
It's suffered some hard times but still works.
Until you are sure they are OK with getting a brick back I'd leave it alone.
Plus if you do, why open it unless you have the spare parts to put in?
