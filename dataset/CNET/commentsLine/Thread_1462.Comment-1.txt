using a dell latitude 131l laptop on xp pro sp3.
just recently the keyboard typing rate on all applications has really slowed down.
i have checked some of the standard things, spywear scan, accessibility setting, keyboard setting, but all look normal.
i have re-booted into safe mode and the problem goes away!!
does anyone have a suggestion how to fix it?
thanks in advance for your help.
