<s> I've never used a green drive, but from my understanding all it is is that it uses less power (hence &quot;green&quot;, to lower you're carbon footprint). </s>
<s> Everything else works the same just the drive uses less power. </s>
<s> Generally, the ones I've seen with this feature have a shorter warranty. </s>
<s> I don't know if this relates to quality standards that are relaxed in these or not. </s>
<s> But, a drive that breaks and goes to the dump earlier than one that does not, loses some &quot;green&quot; appeal...or so I'd think. </s>
<s> It takes energy to make the drive as well. </s>
<s> It's only &quot;greener&quot; if the overall consumption of energy from manufacturing to disposal is less than one without that label. </s>
<s> But earlier disposal can mean additional environmental impact and this makes it's &quot;greenness&quot; difficult to qualify. </s>
