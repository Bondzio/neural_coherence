Because the cables and the router from the old setting are allready installed.
Please take notice that the router is not in my room, so if I need to connect a laptop (any laptop from friends who drop in) to my PC, I will need a port.
I thought that a second ethernet card would solve my problem, but I wasn't sure, that's the reason for my visit to this forum.
So please tell me if my proposed setup will work.
I appreciate to learn better methods.
so I may consider those for future use.
Bob thank you for responding Leo
