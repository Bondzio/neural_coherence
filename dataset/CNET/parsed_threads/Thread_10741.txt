<s> I am looking to run two Seagate 250GB 7200 16MB Ultra ATA Hard Drives with a Raid-0 configuration and am looking for some ideas for what computer to run these on. </s>
<s> I'll be capturing images off of 8mm tape and need something fast enough to keep up with the process. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> My old 120GB 7200 RPM drive does just fine either by firewire or analog capture. </s>
<s> Why would I need RAID 0? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> new 7200rpm drives have sustained transfer rates in excess of 40MB/sec. </s>
<s> unless you have video segments that exceed 250GB in a single file, dual striped 250GBs is a bit overkill. </s>
