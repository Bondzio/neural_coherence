<s> I have a Flytouch 8 Superpad VIII and it is taking 1 hour to charge an additional 4% charge, hence it would take 25 hours to charge it from 0% to 100%. </s>
<s> Is this normal for this android tablet or could it possibly be faulty? </s>
<s> Many of the pads that charge from USB can only take a little less than the 500mA the USB port can supply. </s>
<s> Some makers get around that with &quot;tricks&quot; but nothing sounds wrong here. </s>
