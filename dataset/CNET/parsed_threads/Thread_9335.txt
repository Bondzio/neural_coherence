<s> I would like to add a Drive to my Computer, It is a Compac. </s>
<s> Is this hard to do or should I have it done. </s>
<s> It is not hard and if the drive is new, as it will come with instructions on how to do so. </s>
<s> If you just have the drive then look at the model number and brand and go to the manufacturer's website for specifications on the drive and if needed how to set the drive select jumpers. </s>
<s> For more specific instructions provide information on your operating system but, It may be a bit more involved if this is an older system such as Win95/98, which may be limited in drive size supported without installing a special bios upgrade or add-on. </s>
<s> In general you have to install it with correct jumpers to identify it as either a secondary or if a newer system as cable select. </s>
<s> If on the same cable as the primary drive, it needs to be recognized as the secondary drive. </s>
<s> Once it is installed and recognized, it will need to be formatted and possibly partitioned for your operating system. </s>
