<s> I have an HP Pavilion Elite HPE running Windows 7 and want to upgrade to a dual dvi graphics card. </s>
<s> The most intense s/w I'm running is Blu Ray movies and Vegas Movie Studio HD Platinum 10. </s>
<s> Not planning on gaming with it. </s>
<s> Suggestions/advice? </s>
<s> In fact, why not skip dual DVI and get HDMI? </s>
<s> Since this is just for BR/BD play why not the usual ATI 5450? </s>
<s> https://www.google.com/#q=ati+5450&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;source=univ&amp;tbm=shop&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DrGyTubgJ8vRiAK_1rWNBA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CHAQrQQ&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;fp=a88196fa830a7663&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=589 Can be under 50 bucks. </s>

<s> Because the audio is playing from the computer output ports, there is no HDCP issue. </s>
<s> And this is not just for BR/BD. </s>
<s> Second, my monitors have DVI inputs, not HDMI. </s>
<s> Vegas Movie Studio HD Platinum 10 renders stuff in real time in Preview mode. </s>
<s> I do not know, however, if this is GPU or CPU intensive. </s>
<s> So, &quot;the usual ATI 5450&quot; may be just fine. </s>
<s> But I'm not sure. </s>
<s> Which is why I'm asking all you experts. </s>
<s> So far I'm hearing no BD/BR play for non-HDCP systems. </s>
<s> http://www.cyberlink.com/prog/support/cs/product-faq-content.do?id=2577 and many other sites note this. </s>
<s> But hey, it's your money to prove them wrong. </s>
<s> While the usual ATI5450 would be my choice given the non-gamer use, I do have better cards ready to talk about. </s>
<s> Do this -&gt; Set the price you want to pay and then pick one at that price from this link. </s>

<s> Bob </s>
<s> Because the system came with a Blu Ray burner, and I've watched Blu Ray movies on it, my assumption is that the HDCP encoding is built into the system, and separate from the video viewing/graphics card requirements. </s>
<s> Am I wrong? </s>
<s> I did not read in prior posts that BD/BR was functional. </s>
<s> Folk have systems that don't do this and I didn't know yours was OK. Now all we have to be sure of is that the DVI ports note HDCP in the new cards. </s>
<s> In short, the displays must have HDCP, the video cards must have HDCP and the BD player software have it's decoder, etc. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> After a lot of reading, I think this card will do the trick. </s>
<s> And I found one for $65 including tax and shipping. </s>
<s> Thanks for all your input. </s>
<s> so I got the new card, and when I went to see what kind of card I was replacing I found... a Radeon HD 5570!! </s>
<s> I didn't even care to check before because it didn't have the ports I needed. </s>
<s> The one I'm replacing has an HDMI with the DVI, and I don't have a monitor with an HDMI port. </s>
<s> And the new one has 1 GB DDR3 memory. </s>
<s> So I replaced it anyway. </s>
<s> But I thought you might find that an amusing ending... </s>
