<s> Installed a DIAMOND X1650 AGP512SB Radeon X1650PRO 512MB AGP 4X/8X Video Card in computer #1 for an upgrade-no problems, works great. </s>
<s> Wanted to buy and install another of same card in computer #2 but will not fit. </s>
<s> #2 computer has micro atx mobo and the height of the fan/sink/cooler on the X1650 video card hits the pci card next to the AGP slot (video card basically takes up a slot and a half). </s>
<s> Cannot move pci card to another slot to make room for video card. </s>
<s> Am trying to replace a Diamond Stealth S120 Radeon 9550 256MB AGP 4X/8X card with fan/sink/cooler that fits (barely) without hitting pci card next to it. </s>
<s> Diamond website lists both cards as &quot;full height&quot;. </s>
<s> (From looking at photos looks like dropping down to model # X1600 that the fan/sink/cooler doesn't rise as high and would fit). </s>
<s> Are there different &quot;profile&quot; heights? </s>
<s> How do I determine what card will fit? </s>
<s> Shouldn't be a problem unless it's a slim-line or low-profile case. </s>

<s> New video card would be replacing a Diamond Radeon 9550 AGP on a PCChips M825LU micro atx mobo (Micro-ATX Form Factor, 244*190mm). </s>
<s> Mobo has AGP slot with two PCI slots (both slots being used). </s>
<s> Conventional mid tower case. </s>
<s> As mentioned before the 9550 video card sits next to a PCI card slot with a LAN card for my wireless internet connection and the fan on the 9550 clears the underside of LAN card (or any other card) by 1/8 inch. </s>
<s> The height of the fan/heatsink on the Diamond 1650 is taller/higher by at least 1/4&quot; than the fan/heatsink on the 9550 video card. </s>
<s> Can you run a wireless USB network card so you have an open space? </s>
<s> This is one of the beefs ive had for the past 3-4 years ever since i got into overclocking and stuff using big fans. </s>
<s> Why cant the put the GPU on the other side? </s>
<s> why does the GPU need to be on the bottom? </s>
<s> you always have room on the other side yet all the slots are so crammed together. </s>
<s> Seems like a no brainer but no one has done it have they? </s>
