it was xp with 2 identical machines.
the dvd render took 6 hours on the machine with 512mb ram.
the 1gb machine did it 5 minutes faster.
we couldn't believe the results so we swapped ram and re-ran the tests.
same results.
you are asking for speed so this is not where to get it as you are already at 1gb and have xp (not vista which would change my answer.)
