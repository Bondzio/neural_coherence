Superdrive is a Pioneer DVR-103. Computer is Power Mac G4 733 digital audio running OS X 10.2.8. Drive shows up on system profiler and on Toast. Do I have a bad drive?

I do have another issue though. In OS X the profiler says burning is fully supported but I can't burn files without making a disc image of the file first. The disc works fine on the mac but doesn't read on a PC. My version of Toast only works on classic, do I have to get Toast for OS X to burn cross platform discs?

You really should be moving away from anything &quot;Classic&quot;. The OS X version of Toast will burn just about anything, including PC compatible disks, DVD, D/L DVD, CD and all the other neat stuff. Toast 6 Titanium OS X version, is the earliest version you should be looking for but Toast 7 would be nice. Happy burning P
