I have a P4 system with an Ausus P4P800-VM motherboard based on the Intel 865 Chipset. It came with a sound card onboard. Now I would like to add an additional sound card (any one) to my system. My Questions are 1) Is it Possible to have both the cards working simultaneously 2) Would it cause any performance losses to the motherboard ? I would really appreciate your help in this regard!! Thanks!

Windows doesn't offer a system to route sound from an application to a specific card. If it did, this would have made for some very interesting applications of the PC today. Since you don't run Linux, then it becomes a costly endeavor with cards or devices like http://www.protools.com/products/digi002/systems/002hw.cfm and software to match. Bob
