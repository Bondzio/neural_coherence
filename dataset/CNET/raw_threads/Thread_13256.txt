I'm transitioning to wireless n for my home network to facilitate streaming HD video and basically speed everything up. We still have 1 computer that runs wireless g and often have guests that may have g as well. Is it possible to hook a cheap wireless g access point like the Belkin F5D7132 to my new wireless N router? My understanding is that running mixed g/n from the router will degrade the overall performance. I'm assuming that running a seperate g access point connected by ethernet will allow the router to remain 100% n but maintain g access.

I need to maintain wireless G access in my home network but don't want to negatively impact the wireless N performance. I'm thinking that hard-wiring a wireless g access point from my wireless N router (D-Link DIR655) will let the router run pure N instead of downgrading the speed with g trafic. The access point will let my Wii and guests to connect with g. True?
