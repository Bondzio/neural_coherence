with the old drive, see what format that was in.
i would use ranish partition manager to look at it.
or even to create the new drive in the same partition type and format.
i wonder if you duplicated the jumper settings?
in closing, some of these boxes have strict limits on hard disk sizes such as 127gb limits or others.
the makers rarely reveal exactly what these are but we can take clues if they never offered over 127gb.
