thanks but having the imac awake doesn't sound too convenient for us (there are stairs involved!).
on but in standby is not ok?
do you know if the print jobs are held in a queue so that when the imac wakes up the print jobs go through, or are they just lost?
if not, are there any other ideas out there to setup this network?
