ok, cheers bob, now you're asking something.
all this stuff about operating systems and the like....lol....don't know the make and model (doh!!
don't know how to find out either) but my brother installed the os and yes all the drivers from it's maker are installed.
(well all the ones i got with the computer.)
i'm a beginner when with computers but i'm learning all the time (there's so much to learn though) i appreciate the time you took to answer.
you were that quick you must have been sitting waiting for my question.....lol....... thanks again, kiai xx
