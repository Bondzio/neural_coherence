Both VLAN have outgoing traffic configured through different ISP i.e. traffic for users on VLAN1 is routed through ISP1 and traffic for users on VLAN2 is routed through ISP2. Inter-VLAN communication is enabled. The proxy server should route internet traffic for users in VLAN1 through ISP1 and for users in VLAN2 traffic should be routed through ISP2. Is this setup possible? If yes, how?

I've seen this discussion before and maybe you didn't detail enough to show why a proxy is needed. But for now, it's a bit simple. Just a common IP setting. Your new networker tends to use a proxy where none is required. Bob

What do you mean by common IP setting? The two VLAN are different subnets and their internet traffic is routed through different WAN networks (ISP). What hardware/software/TCP-IP configurations does this require? How can we configure the proxy server to route traffic from different VLAN to different gateways?

Also i do not want to procure hardware separately for different subnets. That makes me to think of configuring a single proxy server for different VLAN.

A first cut at this would be some box with enough ethernet ports for the job and running the proxy servers in their own virtual machines on say Linux. At no time would we connect the LANs to each other because of the havoc that would ensue with DHCP. Bob
