I downloaded the drivers but when I execute them, I get a &quot;Cannot Start Application&quot;. How do I get these drivers installed? I had to install Win XP SP1 after a HD failure and of course none of my drivers are present. I need to get my OEM sound working again. I don't have the original disks. Thanks

I have an old machine that the drivers will fail to install on SP3. I have to write a note to myself about that and put into the driver CD sleeve so I remember that. 2. An antivirus suite, firewall can interfere. Disconnect the internet and try again without those. 3. There is an order which drivers must (shall!) be installed in. Example: OS, Motherboard driver package, Sometimes the MSUAA then the sound driver. More at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7587_102-0.html?threadID=271360#2699006 and you can google up MSUAA and Dells. 4. A corrupted download. Can be your AV suite or a download accelerator. Hope this helps, Bob
