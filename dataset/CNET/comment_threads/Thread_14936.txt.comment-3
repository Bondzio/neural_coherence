This sounds as if it could be a driver issue, that would be something to check in to.
Since you are running Windows XP, there may be an issue with compatibility.
Assuming the printer software had been installed and this type of issue came up, that's where I'd start.
I'd be curious to know if this unit would fly with a more current OS, Vista or 7, if it would/will not, I'd say likely a defect but with an older OS, I'm more apt to say software compatibility.
