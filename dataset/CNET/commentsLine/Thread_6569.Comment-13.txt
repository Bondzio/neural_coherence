wireless b is more than fast enough for your internet connection.
cable and dsl are usually 1.5 - 6 mbps downstream.
802.11b is capable of carrying 11mbps.
there really is little benefit to running g if you are only looking for wireless internet.
it may solve some of your woes to get the actiontec wireless b card for your router, and rid yourself of the troubles of patching an internet router with a wireless ap.
