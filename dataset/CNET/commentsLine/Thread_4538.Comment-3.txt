i am guessing you don't have 1080p on that tv.
if it has 1080p, i am pretty sure there would also be hdmi connection.
what kind of contents are you trying to view at 1080p?
you have a ps3 or blu-ray player on that pc?
i will also venture to say if you don't have a hd video card you might not have much fun trying to output 1080p contents.
just my thoughts.
