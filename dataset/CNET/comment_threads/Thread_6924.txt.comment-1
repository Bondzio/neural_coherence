Looking for a &quot;possible&quot; CPU upgrade.
I'm running a EPOX EP-9NDA3J with a Athlon XP 4000 64bit along with 2 gigs of OCS ram and a XF 7800 GS.
I'm heavily into gaming.
So now, if I purchase a Athlon XP 64 x2 3800, would I benefit at all or would I loose power.
If not the 3800, what about the 4200, 4400 or 4800-which is rare, and prices are through the roof for socket 939 boards.
Any advice would help.
Thanks.
