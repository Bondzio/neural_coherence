1.1.1	Hi everybody , I formated my hard disk , so now it can not boot at all .	St
1.1.2	I would like to know how to create a bootable hard disk .	St
1.1.3	( My OS is WINDOWS ME ) .	St
1.1.4	Please help !	St
1.1.5	Thank .	St
1.2.1	Of course , this will cause it not to boot .	St
1.2.2	I would ask what you used to format the drive and why ?	Ques
1.2.3	All you should really need is your CD of Windows to install the OS .	St
1.2.4	You need to set your BIOS to look to the CD ROM drive as the first boot device .	St
1.2.5	Insert the ME CD and restart the PC .	St
1.2.6	Presuming you have a genuine full version of Windows ME , that should be all you need .	St
1.2.7	It 's an upgrade version , you need to be prepared to present a qualifying upgrade disk at the appropriate time .	St
1.2.8	Hope that helps .	St
1.3.1	Hi Steve Haninger , Thanks for your help .	St
