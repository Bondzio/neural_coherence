<s> I currently have a sent of the Logitech Z-5300e and want to know the frequency range of JUST the satellite speakers (ie not with the sub). </s>
<s> I typed the following into Google.com: Logitech Z-5300e This is one of the first links that came up in the search: http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/US/EN,CRID=2177,CONTENTID=9586 I then clicked on the &quot;Specifications&quot; tab and saw that its frequency response is 35Hz - 20kHz. </s>
<s> See if you can see a part number for the just the satellites. </s>
<s> I couldn't find one at Logitech.com. </s>
<s> I've tried all that and I even emailed Logitech about it but they gave me the same response you did (35Hz-20kHz) so not very helpful. </s>
<s> I'm not too sure where I'd find a part number either, there isn't much on the speaker itself. </s>
