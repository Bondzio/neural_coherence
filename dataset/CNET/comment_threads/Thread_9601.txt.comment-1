Epson has had archival priter ink for several years.
I find that they will not recycle used cartridges w/o a $5 - $10 fee!
(outrageous) Anyway, HP seems to have a fairly fade proof ink but I can't get &quot;Vivera&quot; ink for my printer.
I use a Photosmart C5580 and use 75XL and 74XL.
Has anyone an opinion on the ink and it's permanance?
Have you found the color to be fade proof???
