after building 3 computers for people in the house, i would not be of a mind to buy a ready-made brand name for personal use.
it's a real breath of fresh air to not have the crap/shovel ware that is loaded on brand name computers.
the primary tech support is immediately at hand and i might only have to deal with microsoft or some other vendor on a small issue.
i have an intimate knowledge of the components and software with no need to send the pc to the factory or turn it over to a repair service.
when i may indeed have questions, i don't have to wait on hold ad infitum for an answer, they're mostly available on-line and very quick and easy to get.
