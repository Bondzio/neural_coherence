<s> Hi everyone, I would appreciate any help. </s>
<s> Here is my problem. </s>
<s> I have 2 Windows accounts. </s>
<s> Let's name them account A and account B. </s>
<s> When I log on to account A the CD and DVD drives work perfectly and when I switch to account B, they don't. </s>
<s> I get the following message &quot; drive:\is not accessible. </s>
<s> Access is denied&quot;. </s>
<s> If I log on account B they work and then switch to account A, they don't. </s>
<s> That means they work only with the FIRST account. </s>
<s> They use to work on both accounts. </s>
<s> I would grately appreciate any help. </s>
<s> Thanks a lot </s>
<s> If so, look up BURNRIGHTS. </s>

<s> Hi Bob, Thanks for you message and sorry for not answering sooner. </s>
<s> Yes, Nero is on the machine. </s>
<s> I'll give a try for Burnirights and let you know. </s>

<s> Hi Bob, I just tried the Burnrights and it didn't work. </s>
<s> I still have the same problem the drives. </s>
<s> When I double-click on the drives in Windows Explorer, it still says that the drives are not accessible. </s>
<s> So far it sounds like the classic INCD issues. </s>
<s> Look up REMOVE UPPERFILTERS LOWERFILTERS on google.com after uninstalling Nero. </s>
<s> This is pretty proper stuff if there is no CD in the drive (you didn't say.) </s>
<s> Or the user has no rights. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hi Bob, Thanks again for your message. </s>
<s> Indeed, there was a INCD issue, but even if there is a CD/DVD, it does that, but I finnaly found out from where the problem came. </s>
<s> Some program changed the the rights for the devices. </s>
<s> I just gave the rights back and it works!! </s>
<s> Thanks soo much for your help. </s>
<s> Have a good one Rapheek </s>
