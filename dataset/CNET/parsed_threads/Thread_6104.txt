<s> Got a Memup Xdrivelll portable harddrive/card reader with 40gb capacity. </s>
<s> When connected to computer and after deleting all contents 'properties' tab on computer shows indeed 39,8gb free space for the drive. </s>
<s> However, display on portable drive itself only shows 21,5 gb free space. </s>
<s> What is blocking the rest and how can I get the whole drive clear? </s>
<s> My XDrive required a FAT32 format which in Windows XP is limited in size. </s>
<s> Not a bug and took some reading to understand the limit and issue. </s>
<s> Didn't the XDrive documents note this? </s>
<s> (Yes, they did but who reads them?) </s>
<s> Q. </s>
<s> What is blocking the rest and how can I get the whole drive clear? </s>
<s> A. </s>
<s> As above. </s>
<s> I was able to use my entire 40GB after I booted up in Linux and used it's disk partition software to create a full size fat32 volume. </s>
<s> I decline to detail the exact steps. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the suggestion, Bob. </s>
<s> But I have done no formatting on this drive. </s>
<s> It's well beyond my capability. </s>
<s> Drive came already formatted in FAT32. </s>
<s> Worked perfectly well for a year or so to full 40gb capacity. </s>
<s> All I've ever done is to move data onto and off the drive. </s>
<s> Need to learn how to partition and format it again. </s>
<s> If it's just file space that's gone missing the two user friendly items would be to run CHKDSK on the drive and use some FILE SPACE EXPLORER tool. </s>
