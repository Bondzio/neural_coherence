I want to know if i would be able to replace the GPU in this APU ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103943 ) with another, better, GPU ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102918 ).
I'm not exactly sure how APU's work so I decided to come to the experts for help.
