Have a G5 with a Samsung LCD monitor.
Has worked fine until the other day when the monitor turned black and blinks with a white box in the top left corner.
Can also see the desktop sometimes during the blinking.
I hooked up another working monitor (same brand/model) and an older monitor to the G5 and had the same problem.
Changed cables and still nothing.
I am able to get the monitor to work if I restart in safe mode (extensions off).
Any suggestions?
