1.1.1	Hey all , I 'm new to the forums .	St
1.1.2	I am looking for hardware advice .	St
1.1.3	I 'd like to assemble a $ 2k rig using a Lian-Li PC-767 case , http : //www.amdreview.com/reviews.php ? rev=pc767 and an AMD X2 4400 cpu ( or 3800 if i run out of dinero ) .	St
1.1.4	I 'm not sure what motherboard to use as it needs to be inverted , but I 'd like the SLI option ... and I 'm also concerned about proper cooling and airflow .	St
1.1.5	Any advice is very welcome .	Polite
1.1.6	Thanks so much .	Polite
1.1.7	*wish*	St
1.2.1	like the BTX type case .	St
1.2.2	The mobo is accessed from the right side rather than the left .	St
1.2.3	Intel has been pushing the BTX in order to improve cooling , however they have basically given up .	St
1.2.4	No mfr 's have jumped on the BTX bandwagon , and INTEL is dumping the P4 's and their cooling problems and coming out with a complete new line of CPU 's that do not run as hot , and thus the ATX cases will be fine once more .	St
1.2.5	I know nothing about the EATX , however with the standard ATX , one can get similar cooling airflow by using a fan such as this http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16835118223 Note that the fan is perpendicular to the CPU surface so that airflow goes through the heatsink unobstructed , rather than blowing down through the heatsink into the surface of the CPU which creates a large back pressure..	St
1.2.6	This was the main point of the BTX cooling design .	St
1.2.7	They relocated the CPU on the mobo to make a more straight through path for airflow from the front to rear of the tower .	St
1.2.8	I believe that by mounting the mobo upside down they are trying to accomplish the samer thing , while not requiring a BTX type mobo .	St
1.2.9	[ because nobody wants to make them .	St
1.2.10	LOL ]	St
1.3.1	Ya , I see that too .	St
1.3.2	I 'm more curious as to what people would suggest putting inside .	St
1.3.3	Any suggestions ? ?	Ques
1.3.4	*wish*	St
1.4.1	I decide the basic capability wanted , and then go to tomshardware and anandtech sites and read the detailed reviews of the key items of hardware .	St
1.4.2	When one gets down to the nitty gritty it is amazing how different similar mobos can be .	St
1.4.3	Certainly from those sites and the fact that one can download a copy of the manual for any mobo 's under consideration should allow one to make ones own decision .	St
1.4.4	Just possibly confirm here [ not by me , but others ] for tough choices .	St
1.4.5	I really do n't see how THAT case can be of any real impact in your choices .	St
1.4.6	The case is great and will likely take anything that you might consider .	St
1.4.7	A rigid budget can make decisions simpler .	St
