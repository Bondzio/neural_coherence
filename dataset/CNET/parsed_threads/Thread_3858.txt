<s> First of all, I want to thanks all the people who answered my questions, for taking so much patient to do it, I know that some questions are a little stupid, but what can I do?? </s>
<s> :$ Well, after that. </s>
<s> I want to know one thing... </s>
<s> I have a case with the option to install a cooling fan, connected to the mobo, (3 pins conector). </s>
<s> But I don`t know if it`s necessary. </s>
<s> The specs of my computer are: AMD Semprom 2800+ PCCHIPS Mobo, K7 863G 512 Ram (1 DDR, 333Mhz), 128Mb. </s>
<s> Asus video card, GeForce 5200FX (without cooling fan) LG CD-RW unit. </s>
<s> Western Digital HD 7200Rpm, (80gb). </s>
<s> Sound Blaster Live, audio card. </s>
<s> Most days (5 days per week) I leave it, on all night, and part of the day, downloading some music or games. </s>
<s> So, do I NEED a heat extractor? </s>
<s> or should I leave it, just like it`s. </s>
<s> Thanks a lot! </s>
<s> bye </s>
<s> I guess you can, since u leave it on for so long. </s>
<s> But i think it depends on the temperature it runs at. </s>
<s> Understand that &quot;airflow&quot; is important to maintain a well cooled system. </s>
<s> Its always good insurance to have adqueate yet properly placed fan(s) and/or water cooling system. </s>
<s> The whole purpose to keep componets within operating specs and prevent any heat related stress, otherwise things start to go downhill. </s>
<s> If you have the option to install yet another fan via the mtrbd. </s>
<s> or directly to power harness plug, do it, its cheap insurance. </s>
<s> Beware, any power demands of any kind to add up, so a decent power supply is a must. </s>
<s> FYI - I have a 5200Nvida chipset as well, but it does use a fan to keep it cool. </s>
<s> I'm sure yours uses a rather large heatsink. </s>
<s> Thus, it needs a well cooled system case to help control its own &quot;passive cooling&quot;, OK. enjoy -----Willy </s>
<s> Dear Friend, First of all buy a 350 Wt supply device for your case. </s>
<s> Secondly it is absolutely necessary to have two fans for your case because your behaviour towards your computer is generally characterized as HEAVY DUTY. </s>
<s> You do not have to bother the mobo. </s>
<s> Do not forget that the mobo needs energy to supply all the system . </s>
<s> And finally, a UPS device is essential. </s>
<s> That's all. </s>
<s> Bye !!! </s>
<s> Charidimos. </s>
<s> Im heavy duty.... havent turned my comp off in 23 days. </s>
<s> Hasnt been off for any reason except to travlle to a lan party in 6 months. </s>
<s> heh. </s>
<s> Generally speaking, it never hurts to have extra cooling. </s>
<s> (I've never heard of a computer freezing to death, have you?) </s>
<s> However, if the heat sink is good enough, sometimes a fan isn't necessary...it might just end up blowing a lot of dust around. </s>
