i have windows 7 ultimate 64-bit with a ga-ep45-ud3p (rev 1.0/1.1) motherboard.
when i play games i get a bsod stop 0x0000001e.
it occurred to me i didn't install all my drivers or the new bios for my system since updating to windows 7 64-bit.
i have installed all current hardware drivers, but when i try to install the bios it says it is not compatible with 64-bit and to contact the company.
i have contacted them, but without a reply.
is windows just saying it isn't compatible when i try to run the update in windows, but really is compatible if i used a disk to update the bios?
thank you!
