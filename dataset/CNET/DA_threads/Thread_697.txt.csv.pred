1.1.1	I 'm a big Tron nerd so was really looking at the Tron keyboard by Razer , but it appears to be a terrible keyboard unless you only want to look at it .	St
1.1.2	Bummer .	St
1.1.3	I got to thinking though I really do need a new keyboard .	St
1.1.4	I 'm not an expert , but I believe I need a mechanical keyboard .	St
1.1.5	I see a lot of discussion about & quot ; cherry & quot ; and & quot ; switches & quot ; .	St
1.1.6	I can type pretty fast and am beginning to see how inefficient my old Microsoft keyboard is and how hard I have to press to type .	St
1.1.7	I 'm looking for effortless and responsive typing .	St
1.1.8	I do a ton of typing and want high end all around great typing .	St
1.1.9	That being said I want it to look outstanding as well .	St
1.1.10	Cool lighting is much preferred .	St
1.1.11	So far the only keyboard I have found online to be mechanical and have neat lighting is the Black Widow Ultimate , but again I am not an expert and can use any and all advice you all have on keyboards .	St
1.1.12	Please let me know what is out there that would be good for me .	Sug
1.1.13	I appreciate the help !	St

1.2.1	http : //www.datamancer.net/keyboards/aviator/aviator.htm has a few models .	St
1.3.1	Although they are really designed with gaming in mind , I really like the Logitech G series of keyboards .	St
1.3.2	There is a G15 , G11 and some new ones .	St
1.3.3	I have the G11 .	St
1.3.4	The keyboard has a nice feel to type on , not clicky buttons , but not soft and squidgey either .	St
1.3.5	They allow you to turn off the lights , have them dimmed or full brightness .	St
1.3.6	One of the main reasons they are gaming keyboards is because they come with extra programmable shortcut buttons , but I find these useful out of games .	St
1.3.7	I write a lesson plan every week for school , and it is in essentially the same style each time .	St
1.3.8	So , I simply have the shortcut buttons set up linked to macros .	St
1.3.9	I have the first 6 buttons linked to sentences that I use often in the document .	St
1.3.10	For example , I use & quot ; The children develop & quot ; all the time , so that is key G6 .	St
1.3.11	I hit that in Word , it types it right out for me .	St
1.3.12	I have 2 other buttons set up to auto format .	St
1.3.13	So I highlight some text , hit G10 and it formats the size , font and bold settings to my standard .	St
1.3.14	These button also have three memory settings , so you could set up on group of shortcuts for Word , another for Excel , and a third for Outlook or something , and simply switch between them at the touch of a button .	St
1.3.15	Hope this helps .	St
