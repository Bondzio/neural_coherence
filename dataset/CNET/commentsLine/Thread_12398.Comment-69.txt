i have the phaser 8560; hp 3600n & 3700dn & hp photosmart pro b8350... i also do invitations, etc.
and work with the starstream papers, pearl metallics, 110lb papers, envelopes, everything!
the hp 3700 has been the best for the last 4 years but i am always calling for service.
which if youve called hp, is not the easiest to deal with.
i thought i would love my phaser but when i compare my color laserjet to my phaser, the laserjet wins.
the print quality is much better and truer to what i see on my screen.
the phaser ink scratches off even if i happen to get my finger nail on it gently.
i am having all the issues everyone else has.
on the phaser, the sensor not reading the paper in the bi-pass tray even though its there; the colors completely don't match what is on the screen no matter how much paper i waste changing the options in techcolor feature.
i will say that i use all my bi-pass trays exclusively and the jamming is kept to a minimum.
but i still get jams and streaks on most things and i do large volume.
is there anything anyone loves and they have found thus far that really works?
i cannot sacrifice the quality of my work or charge clients if i cannot produce a product that i wouldn't use myself!
anyone find anything else out?
noise, speed, cost not much of a factor if i can get what i need to work right...
