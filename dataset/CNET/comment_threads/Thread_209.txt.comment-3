I've got it turned off now but it's just a matter of time before I'll have to buy something inexpensive to replace it so I can transfer most of my word processing documents to something newer then retire the old PC for good.
As I stated previously I have another desktop, WIN XP which after a period of inactivity the screen will go black but as soon as I hit any key on the keyboard the screen comes back to life.
I have a new Dell laptop with Vista which works the same way but the WIN 95 PC would go to an underwater scene screen saver and stay there all night until a few nights ago when it went black.
Could the power supply have overheated which would have forced the computer to shut down?
Thanks for your post.
