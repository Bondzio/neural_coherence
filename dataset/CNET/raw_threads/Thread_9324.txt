This will be the first gaming pc though I am a devout gamer, consoles mainly until my friend introduced me to the world of pc gaming so this is the first time I have ever bought one so be gentle with me. I'm looking around for a good pc that runs the latest games and is going to be future proof for a number of years. I have a budget of around &#163;1000 though I may be able to go up and down a little bearing in mind that I have got to buy a monitor and keyboard etc (Using a laptop at the moment). I have been snooping around and the amount of choices are insane. So essentially what I would really like is advice on graphics cards, processors and the likes and what I could get for most bang for my buck. Recommendations are welcome whether it be desktops or sites but I have no intention of building my own I'm afraid. Thanks

I have a list I really like. Here it is -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-performance-radeon-geforce,3018.html Frankly any card above the 101 USD line is going to rock compared to most off the shelf desktops. Bob

A dual core may work just fine, but the op was requesting a machine that wouldn't be horribly outdated for a couple years or so. My advice would be to look for an Intel i5 quad core. You will notice a difference in performance between the two.
