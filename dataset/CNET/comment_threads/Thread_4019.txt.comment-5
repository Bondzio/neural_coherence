Upping the old one to 2 GB of ram would be the only thing I would do with it.
It would extend the life of it for a few more years until XP is no longer supported.
As for a new system you can either build one, and it sounds like you could (if you don't already), or buy a pre-built system.
Now I don't know currency exchange rates very well, but I've put together an inexpensive system for around $500 US.

My oldest system I keep for old games and other old programs.
My XP system has become a media server, and my newest Vista system is the one I use all the time for everything.
Another plus to a new system is that it should run cooler and use less energy.
