<s> Hello, I recently upgraded my Dell Dimension 2350 to Windows Vista Ultimate. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, the Intel integrated graphics (82845 G\GL\GV) is only recognized as &quot;standard VGA graphics&quot; which only allows the monitor to run at 800x600 resolution. </s>
<s> I've looked for an updated driver without success. </s>
<s> Anybody know where I could find one or know any other tricks to fix this problem? </s>
<s> Thanks, J-Law </s>

<s> Sorry to bother you. </s>
<s> It seems the problem has fixed itself. </s>
<s> After a couple restarts Vista recognized the adapter. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help though. </s>

<s> I have a dimension 2350, pentium 4 2.5gb, 1gb ram and have installed vista ultimate. </s>
<s> However i am also getting a resolution problem, it will not allow the resolution to be increased to 1024x756 and wont let the colour to go up to 32bit. </s>
<s> I have attempted to download several drivers, vista says it is up to date, intel drivers will not install becuase they say the system is not supported,ie vista. </s>
<s> and a dell driver had no effect. </s>
<s> Fter several restarts vista has not 'recognised' and changed it... Help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> On xp the graphics chip was known as an intel chip but now they only information i can get it that it is a standard VGA graphics adapter. </s>
<s> I believe it is: Intel 82845G Graphics Controller. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> We seem to have had the same exact problem. </s>
<s> Maybe yours will fix itself soon, I don't know. </s>
<s> Anyways, you could try installing the driver under compatibility mode. </s>
<s> To do this, right click the icon, click properties then goto the &quot;Compatibility&quot; tab in the properties windows and check the box and select &quot;Windows XP.&quot; That might help. </s>
<s> I'm not sure, but anyways, there ya go. </s>

<s> I m not using Dell pc... but, my case is even worse.... </s>
