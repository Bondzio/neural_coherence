all the parts can lead to this issue.
well, maybe not the speaker, some indicator leds and a case (but maybe?)
i mentioned the age of the parts are working very much against us here.
electrolytic capacitors used in power supplies, motherboards and almost all parts of the pc age and decrease in capacity at an astonding rate.
chips can exhibit such anomilies and there is no firm test to find which one in any economical manner except to swap out a board/cpu/chip and see if the issue vanishes.
but since it does this with repeatability and you can use the machine, maybe all you need to do is to not spend a dime?
just turn it on 10 minutes ahead of time, then reboot?
bob ps.
if you want some engineering documentation on electrolytic capacitor aging, then i can supply some, but it's mostly charts and jargon that shows the aging of time and temperature.
what no-one really tells the consumers is that most machines will fail in some number of years or develop 'issues.'
