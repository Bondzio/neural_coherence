it would be the 1st step, however as always, its a logical procedure should it not be the problem.
the other candidates are weak psu and/or mtrbd., also possible bad ram.
reseat the ram and/or use less if more than 1 stick present.
also, are there any beep sequence or error message, maybe a beeping sequence then?
if not, then the cpu again.
good luck -----willy
