1.1.3	My ?	Ques

1.1.7	Thanks in advance Bikerart	St
1.2.1	data from those PCs as they are now and give enough extra space for what you might accumulate in the future .	St
1.2.2	Then , consider what you stand to lose when and not if that big drive fails .	St
1.2.3	As for overwriting previous data , that only happens if you copy new files with the same names as existing files in folders on the drive and you will be asked first .	St
1.2.4	Files are n't removed in rollover fashion as the disk fills .	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the reply .	St
1.3.2	Is it possible to partition the drive so we can put 4 different PC 's on there ?	Ques

1.5.1	I use CLONEZILLA .	St
1.5.2	I did n't read ANY manual or documentation and am able to store IMAGES of machines to such a drive with a single partition .	St
1.5.3	I find partitions to vanish on folk so I shy away from that advice .	St
1.5.4	But if you feel it 's the answer , go for it .	St
1.5.5	The CNET STORAGE FORUM is testament to how we ca n't trust hard drives and more so EXTERNAL HARD DRIVES so make plans for backup and do n't let it be the only place a file could be found .	St
