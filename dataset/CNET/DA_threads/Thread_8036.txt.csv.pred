1.1.1	I have a simple DSL router that can connect to a pc via a Ethernet port or a USB port , obviously for machines that can not support Ethernet .	St
1.1.2	Just looking through the manual it repeatedly says you should not use both at the same time , but I have been using both so I can get two machines on the net , i.e 1 has the ethernet cable and the other has the USB , why is this not supposed to be allowed , both connections wor fine or will it cause a strain on the hardware ?	Ques
1.2.1	It 's simpler than you suspect .	St
1.2.2	The design does n't include a NAT ROUTER that would be required to use more than one such interface .	St
1.2.3	In closing , I 'm sure you could plug it in , but it will not work .	St
1.2.4	Let me share I will not detail why .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	No they both work , Simultaneousley too ?	Ques
1.4.1	& quot ; No they both work , Simultaneousley too ? & quot ; I know it must be Greek , but unless said modem has a NAT router in it , how could it work ?	Ques
1.4.2	Bob	St
1.5.1	I do n't know but it works , perhaps someone can shed light on this ?	Ques
1.6.1	Google.com would be your next stop with simple questions to begin with .	St
1.6.2	Try : What is a router ?	Ques
1.6.3	What is NAT ?	Ques
1.6.4	Your DSL Modem does not have such a feature .	St
1.6.5	If you want to share the internet connection , you learn about ICS at various web sites like www.wown.com or just go get a router .	St
1.6.6	Bob	St
1.7.1	& quot ; If you want to share the internet connection , you learn about ICS at various web sites like www.wown.com or just go get a router. & quot ; I do n't mean this to sound rude but you ar n't listening to me , I AM SHARING AN INTERNET CONNECTION	St
1.8.1	Then I have to ask .	St
1.8.2	What issue are you trying to solve ?	Ques
1.8.3	Bob	St
1.9.1	If you read the 1st post you wouldhave found out that when I stumbled across the Manual it repeatedly says not to use both the ethernet and USB Simultaneously , I wanted to know why ?	Ques
1.10.1	From an electrical standpoint the modem maker ca n't warrant the device because they ca n't control proper grounding of both PCs .	St
1.10.2	If the electrical design is n't done to plug both in at the same time , then and if the PCs are not on the same ground then the modem will be damaged .	St
1.10.3	This is unlikely , but when I write manuals I have to error on the side of caution .	St
1.10.4	Is that what you needed to know ?	Ques
1.10.5	Bob	St
1.11.1	Cheers bob !	St
1.11.2	That 's just what I was getting at , I presumed some sort of electrical problem !	St
