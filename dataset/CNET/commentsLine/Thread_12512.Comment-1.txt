so, i am on a somewhat tight budget and am looking for a projector costing around $500... it will be mostly used for movie watching and occasional gaming.
i would of course like it to be hd (at least 720p) but i understand it may be a stretch for the price?
perhaps you know of some sort of sale or clearance (with the whole black friday or cybermonday ordeal)... any help is appreciated, thanks.
