<s> I have three monitors hooked up to my ATI Radeon HD 5570. </s>
<s> It has three monitor ins, VGA, DVI, and HDMI. </s>
<s> I have a Dell 1907FP hooked up to the HDMI port (I have a cable that has DVI to monitor and HDMI to computer) I have a ViewPanel VPA150 hooked up to the VGA port, and I have a Gateway FPD1510 hooked up to the DVI port. </s>
<s> I have the two monitors working (ViewPanel and Dell) but in Catalyst Control Center when I try to extend the Gateway CCC says something like &quot;If you extend this monitor another monitor will have to be disabled&quot; And I clicked continue it just disabled the ViewPanel and replaced it with The Gateway. </s>
<s> I wondered if there is anyway I could get the three monitors all extended, not like eyefinity but just so I can move windows to other ones </s>
<s> I saw this on the ATI Radeon site; &quot;ATI Eyefinity technology works with games that support non-standard aspect ratios, which is required for panning across multiple displays. </s>
<s> To enable more than two displays, additional panels with native DisplayPort connectors, and/or DisplayPort compliant active adapters to convert your monitors native input to your cards DisplayPort or Mini-DisplayPort connector(s), are required. </s>
<s> ATI Eyefinity technology can support up to 6 displays using a single enabled ATI Radeon graphics card with Windows Vista or Windows 7 operating systems - the number of displays may vary by board design and you should confirm exact specifications with the applicable manufacturer before purchase. </s>
<s> Systems using multiple ATI Radeon graphics cards can support a maximum of 8 displays (total across all cards in system) with a maximum 6 of those displays being used together in a display group (also known as a single large surface mode)&quot; http://www.amd.com/US/PRODUCTS/DESKTOP/GRAPHICS/ATI-RADEON-HD-5000/HD-5570/Pages/hd-5570-specifications.aspx {Note 2). </s>
<s> Seems you may need something extra. </s>
<s> Mark </s>
<s> If I see this card's specs correctly you can use 2 of the three connections at any one time. </s>
<s> To get display number three you'll need another card. </s>
