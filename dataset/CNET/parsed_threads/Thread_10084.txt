<s> I have a 300 GB Seagate external drive and I am having difficulty moving large files onto it. </s>
<s> I have several video files that I am trying to move onto the drive, most of them around 4 GB in size. </s>
<s> Problem is, even if I am trying to move just one at a time, I get an error message saying that the disk is full. </s>
<s> The external drive has at least 150 GB free and even my main drive has 12 GB free. </s>
<s> I've tried enclosing one of the videos in a .zip file and moving it over, and that works fine. </s>
<s> But then when I try and unzip the file, I get the same &quot;disk full&quot; message. </s>
<s> I've also tried using some &quot;backup software&quot; to move the files over, and while everything seems to work correctly, when I go to the external drive where the backed up files should be, nothing is there. </s>
<s> Smaller video files seemed to copy over fine, as well as files of several other types. </s>
<s> Is there anything I can do or any software I can get that will allow me to move those files over? </s>
<s> There is nothing that will EVER fix that limitation. </s>
<s> Only NTFS supports over 4GB files (for a person that wants to run Windows.) </s>

<s> Yeah, it is. </s>
<s> Is there any way that I can reformat the drive in NTFS format (even if I have to delete everything)? </s>

<s> It seems to have worked. </s>
<s> Thank you all so much! </s>
<s> Sorry for the wild guess, glad it worked out. </s>
