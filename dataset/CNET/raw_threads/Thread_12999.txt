I couldn't really think of a good title to describe my problem, but that's as good as it could be, I guess. Anyway, I've been doing a great deal of work on the hardware for my computer this summer, but I've been as careful as I can be. The problems started around when I added a modem and installed SP2 for WinXP. I turn the computer on, and at some point, it decides it doesn't want to work anymore. Then, it just freezes up, and I cannot do anything, except reset - which sometimes doesn't work until I disconnect the power, wait till it all drains out, then plug it back up and set to work. It's not the hard drive, because I put in a brand-new hard drive, and besides; it even locks up in BIOS sometimes. Various things make me think it might be the power supply, but then again, I don't know - I still am learning about computer hardware. SPECS --- PSU: Antec 300W MB: Intel Processor: Intel P4 (I think), 1.8 GHz RAM: Kingston DIMM (?) 256 MB [PCI]Audio: Astron/Ensoniq/AudioPCI (Not sure - says all three) [AGP]Video: Some sort of AGP card with added S-Video support (Don't seem any names...) Case: It says MB on the front. HDD: Western Digital 200 GB DVD: Lite-ON DVD +/- RW CD: LG CD-RW I also added an extra fan. --- Any clue what could be up with this? Also, what's up with the 20 pin AND 4 pin connectors that plug into the motherboard from the PSU? I've seen 20 pin connectors, as well as 24, but never 20 + 4 (two separate connections). Thanks, g'day. -Christopher

Anyway, I think the problem is most likely either in the motherboard, or the power supply, but I haven't another power supply that has the 20 & 4, so I can't try that. Any other suggestions (thanks for those who have tried to help so far)?

So the power supply works fine; now, I am thinking it is perhaps the motherboard, or maybe the RAM causing the PC to lock up. Any suggestions on this?
