I have a partition question.
If I have like 4 partitions on 2 hard drives and the C drive is obviously the OS, does it mess up the the system or registry or what ever if I place programs for instance on the F drive instead of the C drive.
For instance C:\Program files\Adobe, I place it in F:\Program Files\Adobe as an example.
And I am referring doing this to several programs.
I guess my concern is if the C drive or OS crashes, I don't have to reload all my software.
Does this question make sense?
Mike
