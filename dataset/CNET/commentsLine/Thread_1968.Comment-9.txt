hi, not a techie myself.
you should be able to buy a card from any wireless cell phone stores or online (ebay, etc.)
and (usb) connect.
but before you invest, i would check configuration settings.
not sure if licensing will be an issue.
but as long as you are in range for that particular service provider, you should be able to connect.
