I plan on upgrading my 4 year old Enpower Desktop and I would like to know if there is any way to copy everything from my old pc to the new pc so I can avoid having to re-install all my programs and network software.
I plan on staying with Windows XP Pro.
I have a very small business and I use my desktop as a server with two other computers in the building as workstations.
