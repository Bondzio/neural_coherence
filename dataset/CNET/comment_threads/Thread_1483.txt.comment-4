What does it show in Device Manager, I don't notice you mentioning anything about those settings under Control Panel/System/Hardware.
Does everything show it is operating normally in there?
You didn't go into the CMOS setup and disable the sound card when you tried to use the Soundblaster, did you?
Was it re-enabled?
Did you download and install the Soundmax driver that is found at the Dell web site for your model of system?
