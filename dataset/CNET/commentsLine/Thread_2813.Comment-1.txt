i'd been wondering if cables marked usb-2 were really faster than usb-1 and worth the extra money.
so i decided to test the speed.
not scientifically by any fashion, but the results were interesting.
i just used the sweep second hand on my wrist watch.
my machine specs: home built with shuttle main board with 6 usb-2 ports, amd 2400+ xp processor, 512 meg ram.
optical drive: sony 52/32/52 cd burner.
drive case: bytecc usb-2.
procedure: copy a large file from the usb drive to a folder on my hd.
i used the supplied usb-2 cable that came with the case and a several year old usb-1 cable from an older usb zip-100 drive.
file copied: ie6 full, 48 meg in size from a cd-rw disk that i had burned a while back.
results: usb-1 cable took 25 seconds.
usb-2 cable took 19 seconds.
so there you are folks.
