1.1.4	I have the two monitors working ( ViewPanel and Dell ) but in Catalyst Control Center when I try to extend the Gateway CCC says something like & quot ; If you extend this monitor another monitor will have to be disabled & quot ; And I clicked continue it just disabled the ViewPanel and replaced it with The Gateway .

1.2.1	I saw this on the ATI Radeon site ; & quot ; ATI Eyefinity technology works with games that support non-standard aspect ratios , which is required for panning across multiple displays .	St
1.2.2	To enable more than two displays , additional panels with native DisplayPort connectors , and/or DisplayPort compliant active adapters to convert your monitors native input to your cards DisplayPort or Mini-DisplayPort connector ( s ) , are required .	St
1.2.3	ATI Eyefinity technology can support up to 6 displays using a single enabled ATI Radeon graphics card with Windows Vista or Windows 7 operating systems - the number of displays may vary by board design and you should confirm exact specifications with the applicable manufacturer before purchase .	St
1.2.4	Systems using multiple ATI Radeon graphics cards can support a maximum of 8 displays ( total across all cards in system ) with a maximum 6 of those displays being used together in a display group ( also known as a single large surface mode ) & quot ; http : //www.amd.com/US/PRODUCTS/DESKTOP/GRAPHICS/ATI-RADEON-HD-5000/HD-5570/Pages/hd-5570-specifications.aspx { Note 2 ) .

1.3.1	If I see this card 's specs correctly you can use 2 of the three connections at any one time .	St
