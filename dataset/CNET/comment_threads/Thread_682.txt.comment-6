In the summer of 2004 I purchased a new camera and photosmart bundle from HP.
I sent my rebates out with 1 week.
I checked the email status several times which stated &quot;it was being processed&quot;.
After multiple communications with HP, I received a notice that this rebate had expired.
Go figure?
I have 3 HP PC's and 1 Sony Vaio (I have grandchildren, say no more).
I also presented HP with the online documentation which I printed every time I checked my rebate status.
They simply continued to state &quot;sorry, rebate expired&quot;.
