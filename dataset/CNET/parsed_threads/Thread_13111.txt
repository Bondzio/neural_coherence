<s> I have a Linksys WRT310N router which I use with Comcast High Speed and a Windows Vista machine. </s>
<s> I have a Mac OS X computer that I need to get online with for a specific task. </s>
<s> The Mac doesn't have a wireless card. </s>
<s> If I run an ethernet cord connecting the Mac to the router, will I be able to get online? </s>
<s> Also will this mess up my Vista machine getting online at all(not sure if the WRT310N can simultaneously allow Macs and Windows machines to be online at the same time). </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> but it should not cause a problem mixing Mac and PC's on the network. </s>
<s> It is done all the time. </s>
<s> Just running an Ethernet cable to the Mac should allow it to get online. </s>
