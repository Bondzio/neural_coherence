Proffitt	5/6/09 3:53 AM	1.24158198E12	What I discovered	Was that most work but as always the makers can change designs and what I found to work today can stop tomorrow. (99% of the stuff works for me) If you need such a thing, write a RFQ and submit it to CDW or TechData and demand it be tested before delivery. I think it's only a few hundred bucks more for such testing. Bob
