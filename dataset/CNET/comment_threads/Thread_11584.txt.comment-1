hi - i am running two hard drives under the intel matrix storage program, which allows me to have one RAID 1 and on RAID 0 on only two hard drives.
one of my drives just died, so now i have to replace it and repair the stupid thing.
i would like to take advantage of this problem to reconfigure my RAID.
i think i put too little space on my RAID 1 partition and would like to increase it.
is there a way to change my partition sizes without deleting everything on my computer?
i configured the RAID on my motherboard bios, a Gigabyte GA-EP45-UD3P.
the intel matrix runs through windows 7, i guess it just keeps a handle on things and fixes problems.
i've found intel's matrix storage site and documentation to be pretty bad and hard to deal with.
