8995	0	17355	190410	NR	deasel98	3/27/04 3:28 PM	1.08040128E12	POST Problem	I have an old computer (P3, 733mhz, 384 MB, 20GB HDD)that worked fine up until today. Now when I turn it on, it won't boot up. The fans both start up (Power Supply and CPU), the lights go on, but that is it. It doesn't go through POST. The CD-ROM drives won't open either. Any idea of what the problem could be? I'm guessing that my motherboard is shot....
