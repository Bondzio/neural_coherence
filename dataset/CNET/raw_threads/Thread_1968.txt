I was wondering if I could use this as a connection for my home PC (both Windows XP) so that I can cancel my cable modem and if so what equipment do I need to buy and how would I need to connect it? Thanks in advance for your help.

This is a pretty major configuration change for a corporate laptop. Are you sure they'd want you to turn on Internet Connection Sharing and use it in this way? If you decide to do it, you'll need some method for the two computers to talk to each other. Do you have a Switch at home, or a Router with Switch Ports?

Or could I just use the wireless cell card and hook it up to my pc at home so it wouldn't involve my laptop? I have a wireless router at home but it is not all that great, so I would need a switcher? Could I just turn on sharing and then run an ethernet cord from my laptop to the switcher? If so, could it screw up the laptop? Thanks in advance for the help

Having one computer go 'through' another to get to the Internet can be a little more complicated. I don't know what you would have to do to get the cell card to work with your computer, or how your office keeps track of who's connected when. When you say switcher, I think you're referring to a switch. You can get a switch, but you'll still have to enable Internet Connection Sharing on the office PC to allow the other computer to use it to get to the Internet. You could possibly attach your second PC to the one that gets to the Internet directly, but you'll need a crossover cable.

You can install a PC Card-to-PCI Adapter in your Desktop that will allow you to simply plug the PC Card device into your desktop (this requires opening the case on your desktop and unscrewing a few screws - on a 1-to-10 difficulty scale, about a 2.5). Here's an example below - about $40. After the Adapter is installed, simply load the software that came with your Cell Card and, assuming you have good cell signal at the PC, you should be in business.
