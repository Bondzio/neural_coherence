<s> Hey is there anyone who can help me? </s>
<s> I have an dell dimesion 4400 very old it has a dpt478 motherboard. </s>
<s> I have a 1.6 pentium in it and have just scored a celeron d335+ processor. </s>
<s> I see the cooling fan and heat sinks dont fit but can i still use the processor with my old coolling system? </s>
<s> Do i have to edit and bios ****? </s>
<s> Any help would be much apreciated... </s>
<s> You might be able to. </s>
<s> Go into your bios and see if there is a cpu temperature reading if you want to use the old heatsink and fan. </s>
<s> Remember you need to grease the heatsink with the cpu. </s>
<s> Besides, don't the cpu you have came with a heatsink and fan combo, mine did but it was a pentinum D. If not, look up a heatsink with the correct socket for the motherboard. </s>
<s> You can look it up on yahoo or google and find the motherboard and its socket type. </s>
<s> Hope that helps. </s>
<s> heatsink/fan mounting is standardized for socket 478 and that's a mid-tower case so height shouldn't be an issue. </s>
<s> i wouldn't recommend using the original cooler since this cpu runs more than 1ghz higher (and hotter) than your original cpu. </s>
<s> the latest bios for that system is from june 2002, 2 full years prior to the release of the celeron 335. the dimension's bios may not know how to deal with that cpu. </s>
<s> Hey thanks for replying, O.k well i.ve tryed the new processor (celeron d 335+) and no go my computer or motherboard or whatever wont reconize it. </s>
<s> So i've looked all over the net and have found out that intel no longer supports my motherboard but the last info on it that they posted was it supported a celeron 1.8 i think it was, so i'm thinking that if i change my bios to read the new processor it will work (i'm new to this stuff so if i'm totally wrong dont hold it against me.) </s>
<s> Exactly what i was thinking. </s>
<s> can i change the bios to read the new cpu? </s>
<s> If so can you tell me how? </s>
<s> And as to the fan thing i dont have a clue why it doesnt fit the old system was a alu block mounted to the cpu with the fan mounted to the casing. </s>
<s> The new systems clamps are completly different to the old. </s>
<s> you may be able to get an updated bios from here: http://www.biosman.com/replacement.htm but i think you're beating a dead horse. </s>
<s> after the bios update and cpu change, windows may need to be reinstalled or reactivated. </s>
<s> you may just have problem after problem to deal with. </s>
<s> if you are sure and double check what the bios update will support then it should recognize the celeron d 1.8 you are referring to. </s>
<s> It should work because I just changed from celeron d to pentinum d on my intel motherboard but luckily i did not need to update my bios. </s>
