1.1.1	Hi I have 3 2.5 & quot ; usb hard drive enclosures filled with Hitachi 120GB hard drives .	St
1.1.2	I have a lot of trouble with them , they corrupt , cause the computer to blue screen etc .	St
1.1.3	Hitachi diagnostics do n't work inside the enclosures and they suggest connecting them to the computer but the normal cables do n't fit on the hard drive .	St
1.1.4	How do i test these drives ?	Ques
1.1.5	Is the instability with usb drives normal ?	Ques
1.1.6	I always properly disconnect them by safely removing them by the icon in the task bar .	St
1.1.7	Thanks Michael	St
1.2.1	If you 're talking about 2.5in .	St
1.2.2	as in laptop HDs , use a laptop adapter .	St
1.2.3	This will convert , once out of the USB enclosure and attach to HD then to a int .	St
1.2.4	IDE cable of a system .	St
1.2.5	Most 2.5in .	St
1.2.6	are jumpered as HD1 ( master ) , thus make sure its the only HD present or jumpered as HD2 or slave if used with a system and another HD .	St
1.2.7	Adapters are found online so google for one , but here 's a quick source : http : //www.geeks.com You can then run your tests .	St
1.2.8	I suspects , the HD just got too hot if they not cooled in thier enclosure , though most are vented .	St
1.2.9	Try using some enclosures with a fan for direct cooling to see if that helps .	St
1.2.10	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	You did n't tell enough about the setup .	St
