i purchased a atari computer which had the mother board in the keyboard.
it booted with one 3 1/2&quot; floppy and ran all it's programs from floppys.
i bought a hard drive after a few months of having to swap floppys until my fingers fell off.
get this !
a 30 mb hard drive set me back $300 and it was about 15&quot; square and 3&quot; high in size.
don't we miss the good old days !!
