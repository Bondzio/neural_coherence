Hey, I have a fairly great computer with a GTX660 and a i7 3770, but lately one monitor just seems too little, so im upgrading my GPU to a GTX 690 and adding a few monitors to my setup. But of course like any sensable person, I want to be sure that if I put in a 690 it wont **** everything up with Bottlenecking my CPU, so is a i7 3770 capable of keeping up with GTX 690?

More of a concern would be the power supply. That card calls for a 650 watt minimum supply It says at full load it draws about 300 watts.

Link, comment.	&quot;Our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a $225 LGA 1155 Core i5-2500K and a $1000 LGA 2011 Core i7-3960X, even when three-way graphics card configurations are involved. It turns out that memory bandwidth and PCIe throughput don't hold back the performance of existing Sandy Bridge-based machines. &quot; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-cpu-review-overclock,3106-4.html
