then it means there is still an os or driver issue.
it could be hardware since many xp machines are past their expected life span.
that alone can cause owners to explode in some fit of rage but when it comes to having a stable pc, you know it matters.
again, sata appears to be enabled and the driver issues alone should scare most support away.
disable sata in the bios, remove the sata drive and replace any optical drive older than 2 years for a test run.
