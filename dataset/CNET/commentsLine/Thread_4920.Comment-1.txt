i'm using a sony viao notebook piv 2.6 w 512 ram.
it has three usb 1.1 ports.
as an additional bit of information, this notebook as a sony memory stick reader assigned to drive &quot;f&quot; i have a dell issue 64 mb memory key/stick.
the key works fine; i've transferred data using it from other pcs, including my desktop at home.
however, when i plug it into any of the usb ports on the viao, i can't find it recognized by windows explorer or my computer.
it makes the &quot;noise&quot; that says new hardware has been installed, but i don't see it anywhere.
i tried to &quot;map a drive&quot;, but i don't know what or where to map a drive to.
my op system is xp home, sp1.
