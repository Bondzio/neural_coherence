I've been researching network hardwear for three days and can't find a highly rated pci adapter.
The Linksys WRT54G router is high up there, but the wmp54G pci adapter has been having problems.
Looked at a usr 5416 it lacks WAP, anyone have any ideas on a good combination for a router and pci adapter
