Hello, My laser for my DVD Drive has burned out, it is unable to read DVDs.
Anyways, I recently looked online for possible solutions and found out I can transfer a DVD Drive from one of my old computers into the burned out one.
So I thought of my TOSHIBA Laptop.
Then I started to think if it wouldnt work since laptops are compressed hardware and you cant upgrade them etc.
So my question is; is it possible to extract my DVD Drive from my TOSHIBA Laptop and place in my Desktop Computer (Windows XP Professional Edition) If so please explain the steps.
Thank you
