<s> Hello, I have been burning CDs without any problems, until now. </s>
<s> Sometimes, the computer will freeze during a burn and I have to restart it. </s>
<s> Then, if I try the process again it may burn ok. </s>
<s> It appears to be absolutely random. </s>
<s> Any suggestions. </s>
<s> Regards, Bert. </s>

<s> No mention of power or cooling and the rest of the machine. </s>
<s> However I'd like to read that the power supply is 450 or more Watts and that you tried it with the cover off to sniff out cooling issues. </s>
<s> In closing, no operating system was noted but if compatible I'd run Housecall and EWIDO to eject what they find. </s>

<s> sometimes it just happens. </s>
<s> Even on a machine that is set up correctly and has no problems. </s>
<s> Happened to me yesterday. </s>
<s> My explanation is &quot;Gremlins&quot;. </s>
<s> Have never found a good reason, and have learned to not tear my computer apart looking for one. </s>
<s> After closing Nero and rebooting, same exact settings make a good burn. </s>
<s> If it is more than a occasional thing, then look for a reason. </s>
