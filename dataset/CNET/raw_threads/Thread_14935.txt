3391	0	281826	2691504	NR	Odyssey42	1/29/08 5:38 AM	1.20158508E12	Need guidance with new build configuration	It's well past time to replace my aging Dell 4600. My needs are simple: browsing, spreadsheet, word processing, music, no gaming, but I complicate the situation by keeping lots of instances of browser windows, each with multiple tabs, open all the time, so memory is important as well as whatever demands the multiple windows put on the graphics and other parts of the system. I will buy a mobo with CPU and build out around them, and will use XP, either Home or Pro, but unsure if Pro is important to me Considering my system use: I guess the first question is whether I should opt for a quad or duo core. So balancing cost and possible future developments, which of these do you recommend and why? Also what is important in terms of the various buses, memory types, and how many memory sockets, PCI-16, etc? What minimum power PSU? I have a Diamond Viper 512MB X1650Pro which I would like to use instead of buying a new graphics card. Is this adequate for my needs? I do not require state of the art, which by the time I get my system built and running the way I want it will not be state of the art anymore anyway. The extra cost of the latest and greatest would not be a good outlay for me as my needs are simple. TIA

I have already done a bit of looking at how others are building. Copying someone else's build without knowing how they work might not be applicable to solving my issues. This is the reason that I have described my current use (window overload) and mentioned my current computer. The decison for me is whether to try to improve the 4600 or to build a new one on the expectation that faster and more ram, and the duo core cpu, added to the ability to use the Diamond card (the 4600 only has PCI, not PCI Express slots). One reason I thought to build my own is that I have the video card, extra CD and DVD writers, ATA hard drives, an Antec 500 watt PSU and case, so the main ingredients needed are only mobo, cpu, and ram. One question here is whether SATA hdds would be helpful in dealing with my needs. (The 4600 does have SATA connectors on the mobo, BTW.) Any thoughts appreciated.

Since it's a Dell or such, that OS (Windows) is likely to be an OEM so factor that into your costs in case it doesn't activate on your new motherboard. The power supply looks good for all but dual video cards, many hard disks, etc so I'd stop there. As to Sata drives, these feel no faster to me than the old drives. But be sure you are ready with the needed driver diskettes or ask if your new board emulates IDE to ease the install of the Windows OS. And NO. Windows doesn't like such changes so we usually get to start over. Bob

Will the Diamond card help with my window overload issue? Will faster buses and memory make any difference to my use? Or should I just re-install my 4600, bring memory up to 2GB and buy an older graphics that will work in the Dell?

Armed with such a box I expect you could play a game like &quot;The Orange Box&quot; but not Crysis or Bioshock. Bob
