<s> I have a Cannon PIXMA copier/printer/scanner connected to a Targa XP computer. </s>
<s> The printer and copier are working very well, but the scanner fails to work. </s>
<s> I have uninstalled it and reinstalled it from its disc but to no avail. </s>
<s> Any solutions or suggestions, other that dumping it please </s>
<s> I should have said that it is a Cannon PIXMA MP130. </s>

<s> Sadly the last test is to try it on another PC. </s>
<s> Often a part of these all in ones will fail and if the &quot;copy&quot; button works we still need to test if it works on other PC as a test of the all in one. </s>
<s> There are other reasons today such as malware damage, firewalls and more but your post didn't tell if you tried the uninstall and reinstall without the PC being &quot;protected.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the info Bob. </s>
<s> Unfortunately the only other pc I have is vista and it does not support the PIXMA MP130. </s>
<s> I'll triy installing it with the firewall and viruse protection switched of. </s>
<s> I'll let you know how I get on. </s>
