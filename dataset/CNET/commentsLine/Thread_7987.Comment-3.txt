hi mediafreakgodicon, since reading your post and posting my first reply, i have spoken to my mate who suggested a way to solve my problem and it has worked, so i thought you may want to try it.
look on your mobo for the jumper to clear your cmos and short it out.
if there isn't a jumper to short remove the battery for a short time whilst disconnected from the mains.
this will restore cmos to default settings.
it has worked for me so give it a try!
regards mike
