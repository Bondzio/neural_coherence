<s> I'd say the IBM T42 should be a decent machine if you want it more for business purposes. </s>
<s> You don't get these at CompUSA and BestBuy, however. </s>
<s> They are more sturdily built than most I have seen. </s>
<s> I am using an older T30 series for work and it's been faultless so far. </s>
<s> T42s come with about everything but firewire built in. </s>
<s> It's the one drawback I can think of. </s>
<s> You'll need a cardbus (PCMCIA) device for such if you need firewire but USB2 is on board as well as a wireless port. </s>
<s> You mentioned needing a network port and this is standard with most anyway. </s>
<s> The T42 has an RJ45 port like most. </s>
<s> Hope this helps and you get other recommendations. </s>
