Three things to take into account: 1.
Available slots: AGB, PCI or PCI-E. Wrong type won't fit at all.
2.
Power supply.
If you're unsure, how can we know?
3.
Cooling.
If this is an XP machine, 3 Gb RAM doesn't make much sense probably (depending on what you do with the machine).
But it doesn't harm either.
