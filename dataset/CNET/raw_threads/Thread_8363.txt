I currently do all my work on a Mac but would like to switch to a tablet for at least half of what I do (it's a challenge to tote my laptop everywhere I need to go). I'd like to find a tablet that is functional with spreadsheets like Excel or Numbers AND/OR can use a program or app like Photoshop (I don't need it for photo editing, but rather for creating simple backgrounds and designs with text and then saved in JPG). Ideally I'd like both options, but I recognize that I might not be able to get everything I want. I use Polaris Office on my smartphone but am not a big fan - perhaps it's because of a small screen or a poor phone? - because editing is difficult and it's a challenge to retrieve my changes. I'm using a Droid smartphone and really like things like Google Play. But since everything I do is on a Mac am I better off with iPad just because of compatibility? How easy is it to use Numbers on an iPad? I also am with Verizon, so it would need to be usable with their 4G network. Other needs are so simple I think any tablet would fit the bill: email, playing music, web browsing, some e-reading. Thanks for any direction!

But for photoshop you may have to consider a Windows 8 Pro tablet. http://www.samsung.com/us/windows-8-pcs/intel-ultra-thin-tablets/ Notice the S pen? I find many don't want touch features but the ability to draw on the tablets. That means you want an S Pen. Bob

It looks like Photoshop Express is the only thing compatible with Windows 8 Pro - which as far as I can tell is only for photo editing. Are there other apps or software tools that go beyond just photos? (text on a designed background) Numbers on the ipad is a positive - didn't realize that was an option. I assume the cloud is the easiest way to ensure changes are captured between devices? And does that mean that Excel is available on Windows 8 Pro tablet? But what does that mean for document sharing with my Mac?

Proffitt	9/5/13 5:08 PM	1.37840088E12	Why would you write that?	&quot;It looks like Photoshop Express is the only thing compatible with Windows 8 Pro&quot; Windows 8 Pro can run the same Photoshop as you do on laptops and desktops. This is the surest way to assure that you get everything you asked for. MS Office is available and since it's Windows 8 Pro, you should be able to run Windows Office 2003 to today's current version as well as the free LibreOffice. Can you define document sharing? Here I just put my docs and such on dropbox and can access them on all my machines. To me that's document sharing. Bob

So I recant that question and appreciate your correction. Document sharing - in terms of compatibility between devices and retaining changes. I've only used iCloud, Google Docs and Polaris Office to share files from one device to another. I've been pleased with iCloud, horrid experience with Google Docs (it's a pain to import back to my Mac) and can only seem to share in one direction with Polaris. After just learning that I can only print from an iPad using their special printer, that's probably not an option. Right now printing isn't important, but it's a possibility in the future. Looks like Windows 8 Pro is easy to install printer software.
