reformatting is the best thing you can do.
however, while not necessary, you can use disk wiper tools like eraser or ccleaner.
these tools will rewrite every sector of data with new data.
any virus hiding will be overwritten, but like i said, reformatting should be enough.
but on the plus side, doing a full disk rewrite will make it very difficult for any one to recover any data that is on the hard drive.
even if you reformat the drive data can still be recover.
and you can you encrypted backup to make you data safe, in case someone steal your hard drives.
also don't do a full rewrite on ssd (solid state drives), it will not work property and you will use up more of the read/write cycles.
