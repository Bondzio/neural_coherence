motherboards that come with built in graphic are not very good for the high end games .what i would suggest it to fit a graphics card to your new computer that will do two thing 1st all the ram power will go to your computer and sppeed it up and the new graphics card will have its own memory ( get the biggest one you can afford ) and that should handle most top end games.
ps i like nvidia cards they dont usually cause any probs.
