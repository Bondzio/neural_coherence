1.1.1	I 've been looking at tablets for quite along time now and i happen to come across these awesome deals .	St
1.1.2	The only thing is I cant decide on which one is the best .	St
1.1.3	Office depot has the Google Nexus 7 32Gb for $ 240 .	St
1.1.4	They have the Asus Transformer pad 32Gb for $ 300 .	St
1.1.5	They also have the Samsung Glasaxy tab 2 10.1 16Gb for $ 300 .	St
1.1.6	And lastly they have the Samsung Galaxy tab 2 7 & quot ; 16Gb for $ 170 .	St
1.1.7	I would like to use a tablet for school and use the polaris office to type documents .	St
1.1.8	I would use it to play games often .	St
1.1.9	The design and feel of the tablets does not bother me , but I would rather like to have a 10 inch tablet .	St
1.1.10	Just please give me some insight on what is the best deal and which one would be best .	Sug
1.2.1	The office works on apps so at my desk I have the Nexus 7 32GB and a tf300t Transformer .	St
1.2.2	But the problem as I see it is I do n't see how you could replace the common laptop with either .	St
1.2.3	I did stumble over a deal for an Asus for 300 which is pretty nice if touchscreen is what you were after .	St
1.2.4	It was a refurb and the office popped for it and it 's not bad .	St
1.2.5	http : //www.woot.com/offers/11-6-touchscreen-core-i3-vivobook My only wish was it 's fan was a bit quieter but for 300 , I 'm in .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	Well I was wanting a tablet for the portablitly and convenience and the ones that I am looking at are cheaper .	St
1.3.2	Do you like the nexus 7 or the tf300 better ?	Ques
1.4.1	The Nexus 7 is the de facto standard for Android tablets .	St
1.4.2	It has every Android gizmo ( did you know it has the magnetometer ? )	Ques
1.4.3	and is very nice .	Polite
1.4.4	The Transformer is the one with the keyboard dock so you get a few 32GB memory slots so it is probably the biggest storage tablet today .	St
1.4.5	It goes for a few days on a charge and it 's almost a laptop as I use it with a bluetooth mouse .	St
1.4.6	But neither are used as laptop replacements but demo units for our apps .	St
1.4.7	For work , I ca n't see how it could fill the laptop 's shoes .	St
1.4.8	Maybe and since they are all pretty equal in apps I 'm going to write you should buy the cheapest tablet from your post so far .	St
1.4.9	That way you wo n't get too burned .	St
1.4.10	Bob	St
1.5.1	apple makes in my mind the best tablets in the world .	St
1.5.2	if you are in the 300 $ price range the Ipad mini would be I tiny bit more expensive but worth it .	St
1.5.3	they have the best os and it will get even better with IOS7 .	St
1.5.4	you can download more games and better games with it and I think that the extra 30 $ would make a big difference .	St
1.5.5	this is the link to it .	St
1.5.6	http : //store.apple.com/us/buy/home/shop_ipad/family/ipad_mini	St
1.6.1	i suggest nexus 7 or apple ipad mini	St
