Parts like that from HP are usually unavailable as you discovered and you may have to get an entire printer (dead or alive) to scavenge these.
Once in a while you encounter folk that only want the parts they want.
If so you, as the shop keeper get it from ebay, sell it to them for the usual markup of what the entire printer cost then ebay what remains.
