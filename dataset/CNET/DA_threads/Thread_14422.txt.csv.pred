1.1.1	I 've just recently moved to a new house and switched from a broadband connection to DSL , and ever since then , I ca n't stay connected to AIM or MSN chat services or even connect to Limewire anymore .	St
1.1.2	I 've tried other chat and P2P clients , but still none work .	St
1.1.3	How can I fix this ?	Ques
1.1.4	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	Try the Virus forum and use the tools noted there to clean up as well as WINSOCKFIX ( noted in that forum . )	St
1.2.2	Hopefully you can recover enough to avoid a total wipe and reinstall of this OS .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Woah , calm down .	St
1.3.2	I run frequent virus scans with several programs , and comes up .	St
1.3.3	Viruses are n't my problem .	St
1.4.1	These are not viruses and are well known to damage the OS .	St
1.4.2	Giddy up .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	I run spyware and adware scans frequently too .	St
1.5.2	But let 's get off this subject , please .	Sug
1.6.1	If not , why not ?	Ques
1.7.1	First , please run another scan with Adaware and SpyBot just to be sure nothing snuck in when you were n't looking .	Sug
1.7.2	Bob 's point in the other subthread is that & quot ; frequent scans & quot ; is n't frequent enough when something unknown has happened since the last scan .	St
1.7.3	And if you are running Windows XP , get their new spyware scanner and run it too - it is a very good utility and finds stuff that Adaware and Spybot miss .	St
1.7.4	Now , on to the next part ... DSL is one of many forms of broadband , and it ( DSL ) comes in many flavors .	St
1.7.5	It 's like saying you just changed your primary form of roadway transport from an automobile to a Chevrolet .	St
1.7.6	Not much information there - a Chevy is an automobile and Chevy makes a number of models .	St
1.7.7	So ... can you tell us some specifics about your DSL - provider name , connection type , and hardware involved ( modem type and is a router in the configuration ) .	St
1.7.8	Assuming there are no malware issues and you can get to the general internet without trouble , two possibilities come to mind quickly : you are having a port-forwarding issue for these specific services that needs to be resolved in your modem/routing configuration ( or in your software firewalling , if you are using any such ) ; or your ISP is doing some sort of & quot ; traffic management & quot ; by blocking certain ports or packet types .	St
1.7.9	dw	St
1.8.1	I 'm have Alltel DSL at 1.5 mbps connection running through a regular router .	St
1.8.2	Anything else ?	Ques
