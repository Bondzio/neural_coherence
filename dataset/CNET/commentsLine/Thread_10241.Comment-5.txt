yeah looks like its a deffective motherboard then.
i have had some previous troubles with it too, im pretty sure its nothing to do with the sata-ide connectors and the actual sata connectors on the motherboard because it dosent recognise a sata card reader either, or my 22 shop bought sata-ide converter.
i tried looking at recovering a corrupted bios and reinstalling it online, but you have to boot it from a floppy and the only computer that has a floppy drive is the broken one.
if they do decide to not give me a refund, you can buy just the motherboard online for about 40. they also supplied me with an insufficient cpu fan, it was only doing 2900rpm max and it even said in the booklet recommended minimum 4800, so i got a 6000rpm fan and i works fine.
even on the box it shows an aluminium fan, and they gave me a cheap plastic one.
