Computer will turn on and then after going thru the opening of MS Windows XP the desktop will show up. After a minute of start up (Avast tells you virus definitions are up to date) the hard drive stops making its usual sounds and the screen freezes. NO mouse movement, no chance to use ctrl, alt, delete to begin using any system problem solutions or nothing. I bought it from amazon dot com as a refurbished item. It is a 3 gig processor with 2 gigs of ram, 160 hard drive with a DVD rom drive. It worked great since purchasing it in Feb of this year. Always ran system scans of AVast, disk clean up and disc frag done two weeks prior to this problem. I always use the shutdown feature for turning off the computer. Don't visit porn sites or open attachments I don't know who sent them. Any help will be great.
