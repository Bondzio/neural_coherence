1.1.1	I have four Seagate 40GB IDE hard drives that were removed from working PCs .	St
1.1.2	In each case , the drive was reformatted in the PC .	St
1.1.3	My aim was to use these drives as ( free ) medium-capacity backups -- mostly for video projects .	St
1.1.4	I bought an IDE-to-USB adapter cable that plugs into the back of the drive , so the drives can be used as enclosure-less externals .	St
1.1.5	Out of the four drives , only ONE works with the cable .	St
1.1.6	The other three do n't spin up .	St
1.1.7	The drives seem to TRY to spin , but just repeatedly lurch and beep ( I can feel the drive twist when I touch it ) .	St
1.1.8	I suspected that the cable was n't providing enough power , but checking with a multimeter , the power cable provides the necessary 5 and 12V with upwards of 5 amps .	St
1.1.9	At least very close to the needed voltages ( 4.9 and 11.8 ) .	St
1.1.10	Is the adapter cable 's power supply the problem ?	Ques
1.1.11	I do n't understand why all four worked in a PC , but only one works with the cable .	St
1.1.12	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	If so , there is n't going to be adequate power to run an external 3 1/2 inch drive .	St
1.2.2	Taking current measurements with a multimeter is a tricky and imprecise process as well .	St
1.2.3	You ca n't really measure what can be provided but only what is being drawn at any one time .	St
1.2.4	As well , motors need much more current to start them than to keep them spinning .	St
1.2.5	The rule I remember from long ago is 7X current to start .	St
1.2.6	This wo n't apply universally today but might give you an idea of what to expect .	St
1.2.7	You should be able to plug just the power connector from the 4 pin molex on a computer 's PS and get it to spin without a data cable connected .	St
1.2.8	If it does , the drive 's mechanical system is OK .	St
1.2.9	If not , the drive is probably beyond its usefulness .	St
1.3.1	Need more info on the system you are using , specifically PSU capacity , might be underpowered for the task ( s ) .	St
1.4.1	No , the power does n't come from the IDE/USB cable .	St
1.4.2	There 's a separate cable to a wall outlet .	St
1.4.3	The power supply is marked saying the output is 2 amps .	St
1.4.4	The drives say 5V @ 0.85A and 12V @ 0.75A .	St
1.5.1	If the ext .	St
1.5.2	cable setup was correctly attached and the drives are jumpered or setup right as well , then that only leaves the small AC wart providing power .	St
1.5.3	Understand the 40gb HDs are older and tend to be wanting more power than newer HDs as the int .	St
1.5.4	HD motor is more power demanding .	St
1.5.5	On top of all that any past wear & tear of the HDs could be enough to overcome the initial startup juice required , in other words , no Ummfff ! ! !	St
1.5.6	to get it spinning .	St
1.5.7	-OR- they are spinning ( very quiet ) but yet another connection problem exists , they are n't being recognized for whatever reason .	St
1.5.8	I have an ADA-2020 ( like yours ? ? ? )	Ques
1.5.9	and works work quite well until I deal with much older drives to includes CD .	St
1.5.10	Check the HD specs for the jumpering , some older HD needed dual jumpers when operating alone .	St
1.5.11	While there , the specs should state the power demands .	St
1.5.12	Need , be sure the contacts are clean .	St
1.5.13	Follow that and inspect the specs of the AC wart to compare .	St
1.5.14	Also , unless you have a AMP clamp to gauge the true draw of power , a typical meter just wo n't do unless that 's an option .	St
1.5.15	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.6.1	The ADA-2020 is pretty much what I have .	St
1.6.2	The drives are n't merely running quietly , as I can hear them repeatedly TRYING to spin .	St
1.6.3	Oh well .	St
1.6.4	At least the whole exercise did n't cost me anything .	St
