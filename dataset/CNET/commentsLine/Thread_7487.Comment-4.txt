what i need to disable?
and how?
i am using the roxio program interface (not drag and drop) the program is suppose to creat an image in the disk and then download that image to my blank dvd, i think is the common way.
i am using only one dvd driver for this.
i am trying to make a copy from a original dvd.
thanx for your response
