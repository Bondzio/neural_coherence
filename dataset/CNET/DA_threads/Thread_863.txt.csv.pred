1.1.1	I saw on CNET , maybe a month ago , a new tablet/laptop that converts by having the screen pivot on two silver rail-type things on the side .	St
1.1.2	It can either be a tablet with the screen sitting on top of the keyboard , or the screen slides away from the keyboard to make it look more like a laptop .	St
1.1.3	That 's a horrible description , I 'm sorry .	Polite
1.1.4	I also think it was running Windows 8 .	St
1.1.5	Anyone have any idea what that tablet was called ?	Ques
1.2.1	Here 's the CNET link about it .	St
1.2.2	http : //www.cnet.com/8301-31045_1-10424800-269.html It 's been done before and given it 's lukewarm sales and more , you probably wo n't see this again .	St
1.2.3	The next things will likely be the Windows 8 tablet with it 's keyboard unit .	St
1.2.4	Although the big issue for most will be APPS .	St
1.2.5	http : //www.techradar.com/us/news/mobile-computing/tablets/windows-8-tablets-release-date-specs-and-prices-916134 Both could run Windows 8 but what is the draw here ?	Ques
1.2.6	I mean you wo n't be using Office or many current apps for a while .	St
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	This had grey/silver rails on the side that were connected to the tablet and allowed the screen to slide away and up , locking into place to be used as a screen for a keyboard .	St
1.4.1	But ca n't see the attraction given the issues with APPs and use .	St
1.4.2	As the Slate rolls out you can bet you 'll see more models as they hope to get you to buy one .	St
1.4.3	Sorry but your description sounds like a fragile thing .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	and it may not work for us , but I was intrigued .	St
1.5.2	And then when I could n't find it , I was even more determined to figure out what it was called !	St
1.6.1	http : //www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/262026/why_windows_8_hybrids_wont_survive_the_test_of_history.html	St
1.7.1	Pretty sure this is the tablet you are talking about .	St
1.7.2	Let us know if this is the one so we can put this question to rest : -P http : //tablet-news.com/2012/08/30/ifa-2012-dell-unveils-xps-duo-12-ultrabook-with-swiveling-touchscreen/	St
