<s> This is a simple question, does anyone have a preference between the ATI Radeon 9700 Pro or the Radeon 9800 Pro, they are almost identical cards, and thier benchmarks are close so I am just wondering if anyone has a preference. </s>
<s> My preference is to avoid ATI cards, they have so many driver problems that you are going to find out about their &quot;driver of the month&quot; issues in a short time. </s>
<s> How you need one driver to play one game, and another to get another to work properly. </s>
<s> Not a fun situation. </s>
<s> Between the time I wrote this post and now I have changed back to wanting a good old nVidia (I have never used ATI yet, all my cards are nVidia but none are very good I still have my old GeForce 2 MX200) So now my question shifts to will there be a considerable difference between the GeForce FX 5600 Ultra and the GeForce FX 5700 Ultra? </s>
<s> (I would prefer the 5600 since it costs less, and has VIVO) </s>
<s> Check out www.tomshardware.com for reviews on different cards. </s>

<s> Like the Moderator I personally prefer Nvidia cards after reading about problems even with the newest ATI cards. </s>
