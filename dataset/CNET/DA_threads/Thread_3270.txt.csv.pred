1.1.1	So I recently found a great online deal for an Asus cm6870 for the purpose of using as the base of a gaming rig .	St
1.1.2	I replaced the PSU with a Coolmax ZU-900B to power my GTX580 GPU .	St
1.1.3	After testing 3 or 4 games , I launched Skyrim with some graphic mods and the PC rebooted .	St
1.1.4	This happened within about 30 minutes of testing .	St
1.1.5	After trying the game again about 15 minutes later , I realized that the audio was playing very slowly and was pitch-shifted really low .	St
1.1.6	I also heard the fan blowing loudly , so I turned it off immediately .	St
1.1.7	The back the case was painful to the touch .	St
1.1.8	Here 's some info that may be useful : - The case does not have a fan in the front .	St
1.1.9	- The PSU did not initially align with the screw-holes in the current case until bending some guide-rails out of the way .	St
1.1.10	- The PSU did not have direct connections for the video card but had some additional cables that connect manually via the PSU 's housing .	St
1.1.11	( I used common sense in using only connections that fit naturally ) - The motherboard is pretty small ( 1 x16 pcie , 1 x1 pcie ) .	St
1.1.12	- The case has non-removable covers where additional slots would be .	St
1.1.13	( possibly restricting airflow ) First off , did fry my GPU already ?	Ques
1.1.14	And why is it overheating so quickly ?	Ques
1.1.15	Is it the case ?	Ques
1.1.16	The PSU ?	Ques
1.1.17	The motherboard ?	Ques
1.1.18	Could not having a front fan or any apparent frontal ventilation on the case lead to that quick of an overheat ?	Ques
1.2.1	The whole idea of & quot ; airflow & quot ; is to exchange air from in to out , thus airflow .	St
1.2.2	The exchange obviously replaces hot air for cool .	Polite
1.2.3	If you have some restrictive path or simply one that is block or not yet fully used , you need to make it happen .	St
1.2.4	Best explained by visiting gaming websites to review pix of all those gaming rigs out there .	St
1.2.5	If you have no frt .	St
1.2.6	fan , then get one and mount as it should ( empty space/mounting ) and draw air , & quot ; in & quot ; .	St
1.2.7	Better fans have an embossed & quot ; arrow & quot ; showing air direction or label/decal .	St
1.2.8	You mention , no side cover , well either that 's a poor gaming rig or it was n't for gaming in general .	St
1.2.9	Now , you know why gaming rigs cost more , everything is geared to make it stay running longer , even the case .	St
1.2.10	What some users have done , make a & quot ; blow hole & quot ; , by cutting on side or top ( or both ) and mount a fan there .	St
1.2.11	It would appear the Asus cm6870 is capable , so investigate what 's what .	St
1.2.12	Maybe a plate is blocking air , you have to remove it by flexing it off ( knock-out ? ) .	Ques
1.2.13	Better PC cases have the PSU mounted on the bottom to better assist heat exchange as they too cause heat .	St
1.2.14	heat rises and its better exhausted by upper fans and all is expelled out .	St
1.2.15	Also , if a filter is mounted at frt .	St
1.2.16	maybe remove it , as you need better airflow even unfiltered as demands are greater than can be supplied & quot ; as is & quot ; .	St
1.2.17	These are areas to look at , so they 're suggestions and using common sense you may zero-in on problem area .	St
1.2.18	Also , visit gaming websites .	St
1.2.19	GPU in general will run hot or at least uncomfortably so , but if too hot , they will stress out and worse , fail .	St
1.2.20	Be sure that if the GPU is fan cooled it is working as well and clean .	St

1.3.1	After trying the game again about 15 minutes later , I realized that the audio was playing very slowly and was pitch-shifted really low .	St
1.3.2	I also heard the fan blowing loudly , so I turned it off immediately .	St
1.3.3	The back the case was painful to the touch .	St
1.3.4	QUESTION : Which fan ... ..the CPU fan ?	Ques
1.3.5	The GPU fan ?	Ques
1.3.6	or the PSU fan ?	Ques
1.3.7	Here 's some info that may be useful : - The case does not have a fan in the front .	St
1.3.8	- The PSU did not initially align with the screw-holes in the current case until bending some guide-rails out of the way .	St
1.3.9	- The PSU did not have direct connections for the video card but had some additional cables that connect manually via the PSU 's housing .	St
1.3.10	( I used common sense in using only connections that fit naturally ) - The motherboard is pretty small ( 1 x16 pcie , 1 x1 pcie ) .	St
1.3.11	- The case has non-removable covers where additional slots would be .	St
1.3.12	( possibly restricting airflow ) QUESTION : Have you tried running it with the case 's side off ?	Ques
1.3.13	First off , did fry my GPU already ?	Ques
1.3.14	And why is it overheating so quickly ?	Ques
1.3.15	Is it the case ?	Ques
1.3.16	The PSU ?	Ques
1.3.17	The motherboard ?	Ques
1.3.18	Could not having a front fan or any apparent frontal ventilation on the case lead to that quick of an overheat ?	Ques
1.3.19	ANSWER : Fry GPU ... .not way to tell .	St
1.3.20	Try running system with case side off .	St
1.3.21	ANSWER : Overheating so quickly ... .almost anything and everything overheats when it can not dissipate heat .	St
1.3.22	Again , try running system with case side off .	St
1.3.23	QUESTION : How many power connectors from the PSU are connected to the GPU and exactly which GTX580 ( mfg/series/model # ) do you have ? ?	Ques
1.3.24	SUGGESTION : Download , install , run and minimize PCWizard 2012 ... the system temps including the CPU , the GPU will remain on the screen ... .let us know what the temps are .	St
1.3.25	VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	Thanks a lot guys !	St
1.4.2	Decided to go get a new case with an obscene amount of ventillation lol .	St
1.4.3	Downloading CPUID to monitor my temps .	St
1.4.4	If I hit anymore snags , I 'll add a new reply .	St
1.4.5	Thanks again for the guidance !	St
