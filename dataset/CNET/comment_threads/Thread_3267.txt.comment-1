My son is into composing and editing music.
He is planning on building his own computer, using the best suitable Motherboard and other components.
Looking for suggestions for best MB and CPU if price is no object.
Looking for suggestions for second best MB and CPU if there is vast price difference between #1 and #2 recommended MB & CPU.
For the money, is AMD better than INTEL?
What other components are recommended?
Sound card... etc...
I know there are a lot of knowledgeable people on this forum so I am hoping for some valuable help.
Thanks Ben
