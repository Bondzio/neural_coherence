1.1.1	AthlonXP 2500+ Generic ( Hercules ) 400W PSU 1GB RAM 1 DVD-ROM 1 DVD+\-RW Radeon 8500 ( 64MB ) Floppy SB Audidy 2 Plat , with Live Drive installed XP SP1a all updates OK , so I 'm playing a game of War3 and suddenly the system just seems to lock up .	St
1.1.2	The monitor just goes black and then into power save mode .	St
1.1.3	I smell what smells like popped kettle corn coming from the PSU .	St
1.1.4	No other parts seem damaged after visual inspection .	St
1.1.5	Including the CPU core .	St
1.1.6	If I turn the system on , the fans all start up and the DVD drives flash like they should .	St
1.1.7	The floppy is silent , and I get no signal to the monitor including the pre-POST diag messages .	St
1.1.8	The monitor displays a message about how there 's no signal .	St
1.1.9	I 've tried switching video cards , monitors , reseating the video card , making sure the other PCI cards were still seated properly , nothing works .	St
1.1.10	The only way to turn the system off is via the switch on the power supply .	St
1.1.11	The power and reset buttons do n't work .	St
1.1.12	My thinking at this point is that the PSU has blown out enough that it 's unable to power everything in my system .	St
1.1.13	I know AthlonXP 's are known for putting high demands on PSU 's , and I suppose I 'm lucky the potentially dead one lasted as long as it did .	St
1.1.14	But before I run out and spend about $ 80 on a replacement PSU , I want to see if others agree with my assessment .	St
1.2.1	I 'll supply an article about how to select the size and then another about how they lie about the rated size .	St
1.2.2	http : //www.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/ http : //www.tomshardware.com/howto/20021021/ In closing , we lost about 5 motherboards and a few power supplies due to failing motherboard capacitors .	St
1.2.3	Be sure your PSU loss is n't due to some other issues .	St
1.2.4	But with what parts you 've listed , that PSU may have been just too small .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	On a side note , after you get your P/S problem fixed ( I hope ) , could you tell me how you like the XP2500 ?	Ques
1.3.2	I 'm trying to decide between the XP2500 and the XP2600 Barton .	St
1.3.3	Not sure the XP2600 would be any faster for the extra money .	St
1.3.4	Ca n't find a side by side comparison .	St
1.3.5	Good luck on the PSU .	Polite
1.3.6	chuck	St
1.4.1	You mention & quot ; generic & quot ; and that what can happen , especially on a loaded-up system .	St
1.4.2	At least 400W is better than 300W whcih many a home build system case comes supplied with , so at least you started out decent .	St
1.4.3	The problem with a blown p/s unit is that it *could* cause other problem ( s ) .	St
1.4.4	So do n't discount it should after replacing the p/s unit flaky problem ( s ) may appear .	St
1.4.5	The better p/s units are Enermax or Antec ( sp ) or those supplied by pcpowerandcooling ( dang good ) .	St
1.4.6	It not surprising that 500W+ units are now available and even if generic is better than 400W unless name brand .	St
1.4.7	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
