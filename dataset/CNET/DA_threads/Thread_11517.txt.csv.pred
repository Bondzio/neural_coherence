1.1.1	http : //www.newegg.com/app/viewproductdesc.asp ? description=11-129-117 & DEPA=1 I like this case , but it comes with a 300W Antec Smart Power PSU .	St
1.1.2	I currently run an Apex case with a 350W PSU ( Generice PSU ) .	St
1.1.3	Will the Antec case with the 300W PSU Antec Smart Power be able to handle my components ?	Ques
1.1.4	Right now the 350W PSU randomly restarts and this is not due to my oc cause the Prime 95 ran for 18 hours before I turned off my comp .	St
1.1.5	Abit AA8-Duramax P4 520 2.8 @ 3.73 2 x 256 DDR2 Kingston VRam WD Caviar SE 160 GB Maxline Plus II 250 GB SATA Optorite DVD +/- RW LG 52x CD-ROM Seagate 36.6 GB SCSI U320 LSI Logic U320 Controller Sapphire Radeon X600 Pro Floppy Drive	St
1.2.1	Sooner or later the 300W wo n't cut it or flat out fail and maybe take a device in the process .	St
1.2.2	With all the goodies you got you ned room to grow on and work with .	St
1.2.3	I suggest a 350W or hi-quality p/s unit but cheaper 400W+ are easily gottern and for even a few $ more a 450-500W+ is n't being outrageous .	St
1.2.4	If you want to see what can be suggested look at this website : http : //www.pcpowerandcooling.com Even though you pay more , you get one hella of alot quality and *stable output* far better than anything out there .	St
1.2.5	Brand names like Antec , Enermax or Vantec should be look at in the 400W+ range .	St
1.2.6	Real cool system cases don'tr even come with p/s units expecting you to decide on the best desirable unit .	St
