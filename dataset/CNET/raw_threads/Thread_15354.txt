Porsche 160GB USB2.0 Item Number 300700U for quite a while. My problem is: When i connect the USB to the computer, i can see the drive show in my computer but i could see it in disk management (in control panel). The disk is spinning when i connect the cable , from what i heard, but i cannot access it. Can anyone tell me what wrong or is there anyway i can fix it? Is it because i suddenly unplug it (without safety remove), i assume that it shouldnt be the case these day. Many thanks

It may show in disk manager but not in my computer until it's partitioned. If you partition and do not format, it will show as a drive letter in my computer but you cannot access it until formatting. Any missing steps here?
