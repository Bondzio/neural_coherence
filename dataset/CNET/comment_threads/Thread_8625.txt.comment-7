Is that as time marches on, you find it's no longer true.
Back in the 90's I had dual CPU machines and enjoyed smooth operations and all the rhetoric back then was fun to read as I was there and enjoying the ride while others debated more than one CPU topics.
Today I have the quad core and it's very nice for the work that I do.
I would not change back.
Today I'm &quot;there&quot; with Windows 7 64 bit and not a single problem.
Again I see all those that claim there are problems yet most of them are not &quot;there.&quot; That is, they don't actually own, use or write software on such machines.
