Michael, Thanks - the motherboard has the two IDE channels printed on the MOB as 1 and 2 so that is what I am using for explanation.
I did try booting with the hard drive on each channel with nothing on the other and encountered the same problems.
I have an email and a call in to the vendor.
Thanks for your help.
