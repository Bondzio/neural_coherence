<s> Notebook battery replaced + power cords changed yet FAIL. </s>
<s> I had to replace my old notebook battery since I used it a lot. </s>
<s> It was not keeping the charge for even 5 minutes. </s>
<s> During the time I also purchased new power cords to outlet & adapter. </s>
<s> I tried to power on the notebook but to no success!! </s>
<s> I double checked the battery connection & it was secured with the lock button in ON state. </s>
<s> There is a Led light on the new adapter so it was turned green when plugged in but the notebook green large power light was not lit up? </s>
<s> New battery & new power cords why is it not working? </s>
<s> Does new battety require a charge before use or something? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> The old battery was depleted yet still on direct outlet power it was working fine. </s>
<s> How will I make it to power on? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> You've explained your problem but lacking what model# was inviolved. </s>
<s> In light of that and probable long time operation with a bad battery or weak one, it came back to bit you. </s>
<s> Understand, prolong use of battery will cause the internal charging ckt. </s>
<s> to run and it may actually be worn-out or worse, broken. </s>
<s> Yeah, that happens, as electronics being used and in &quot;heat stress&quot; situations are stressed until they become less than stable. </s>
<s> Also, old stuff is old stuff and brings in its own faults to include anything under the sun. </s>
<s> Alas, is the new adapter or all those new items really ready for your notebook. </s>
<s> In other words are they whjat you reall need and accepted as so. </s>
<s> If they vary or really aren't as capable or the wrong setup it will be quick to error or as you found out. </s>
<s> Also, is the battery really a new one or rebuild one. </s>
<s> If you can get your hands on a friend's &quot;exact same charging parts&quot; use them and check results, as that is about the only way other than checking specs to see if the items you brought are capable. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Older laptops suffer from a failure in the charger/inverter component in the unit itself. </s>
<s> Sometimes the mfgr uses a small seperate board and others make it part of the system/motherboard. </s>
<s> When batteries reach the end of their useful lives, the take more current to charge and can burn the board, battery and charger inverter unit. </s>
<s> Replacement of both battery and converter leaves the internals being the failure. </s>
<s> I have a Dell with the same trouble and a new MOBO is needed, not expensive but over ten years old, best left for more dire days. </s>
<s> I don't know all models but some require the maker's adapter to charge. </s>
<s> You claim the old adapter was working so why not step back to that adapter and leave out the battery. </s>
<s> If that fails, it needs repairs. </s>
<s> And in parting I'm assuming you read about the generic reset noted in the CNET Laptop Troubleshooting forum welcome post. </s>

<s> I had a Dell laptop and I bought one of these universal PS, but guess what? </s>
<s> It did not work. </s>
<s> I checked the voltage output of the connector and check the connection and everything appears to LOOK ok...but yet, it won't work. </s>
<s> I end up getting a Dell replacement PS and it works like a charm. </s>
<s> So you might have the same situation. </s>
<s> Get a same replacement. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> I got my from Amazon, which should be lot cheaper. </s>
<s> This post has been here awhile and like to make a note of interest to anyone that gets a laptop adapter. </s>
<s> Most OEM adapters are labeled on their backside what they expect to offer. </s>
<s> Often enough one adapter is pretty much like another especially if from the same maker(Dell, Gateway, etc.) </s>
<s> but that is not always an given. </s>
<s> I mention that because the sale of so-called universal adapters that have all the connections and maybe slide voltage sw. could be less than desirable for your laptop. </s>
<s> These are too generic though they certainly work for many laptops just not all. </s>
<s> They may simply lack the amps or desired voltage required to &quot;turn-ON&quot; the laptop brought for. </s>
<s> It's working but excluding any prior faults of the laptop itself, it just isn't cutting it. </s>
<s> However, if you shop for a replacement laptop adapter, make darn sure it's rated or compatible for your laptop model-XYZ. </s>
<s> That way if it doesn't work you can return it or get a refund, etc.. </s>
<s> If on the other hand you try one adapter from one laptop maker on yet another laptop model, don't expect it to work it just may not. </s>
<s> Again, provided nothing is wrong with the laptop shop for a direct compatible replacement. </s>
<s> tada ------Willy </s>
