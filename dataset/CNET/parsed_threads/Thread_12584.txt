<s> The time has come to buy a new cordless phone, I'm interested in a 2 handset model, a base with one handset and another handset with it's own cradle which I can install in another part of the house. </s>
<s> I'd like to install the new base unit in a bedroom where my desktop PC is located. </s>
<s> There's also a Linksys WRT54G router in that same bedroom. </s>
<s> I've been reading some user reviews on some of the newer cordless phones, the biggest complaints have been interference with wireless routers. </s>
<s> My old phone which I'm replacing is a Panasonic 5.4 model. </s>
<s> Do the new 6.0 cordless phone models work good if they are set up in a room that also has a WRT54G wireless router? </s>
<s> I've had a Uniden cordless phone sitting within two feet of my D-link modem for at least three years. </s>
<s> Never a blip on either the phone(s) or the modem. </s>
<s> I have changed channels, though. </s>
<s> Since I researched the specific frequencies before hand, I'll let you do the same. </s>
<s> Oh so rather than come here seeking good advice you're telling me to go do the research myself. </s>
<s> Gee, thanks. </s>
<s> Correct me if I'm wrong here, my Linksys WRT54G wireless router operates at 2.4Ghz, my current Panasonic cordless phone which I want to replace operates at 5.8Ghz, 5.8Ghz phones are still being sold and there's the new cordless phone technology, DECT 6.0. </s>
<s> Well before I set out to do my research what's your opinion on this? </s>
<s> Which cordless phones are better? </s>
<s> Panasonic phones or V-Tech? </s>
<s> Can you answer that? </s>
<s> I have the Dlink wireless router; they seem to work ok for me. </s>
<s> I have no idea what their frequencies are. </s>
<s> Some of the older phones operated in the 2.x bandwidth. </s>
<s> They had a tendency to interfere with routers (B & G). </s>
<s> As far as the newer phones and higher frequencies, the higher frequency the better the transmission. </s>
<s> Usually. </s>
<s> Brands? </s>
<s> I only have experience with Uniden, which I'm pleased with. </s>
<s> If you decide to upgrade the router to N, they operate at the higher frequencies in and around the 5.x bandwidth. </s>
<s> So what would happen if I bought a Panasonic multi-handset DECT 6.0 unit and decided to upgrade my router later to a &quot;N&quot; router? </s>
<s> Could I still use a DECT 6.0 phone near an &quot;N&quot; router or not? </s>
<s> While it should be fine there will always be someone that has a system that will be upset with what they added. </s>
<s> No one can claim there will be no problem. </s>
<s> But in this case there should be no problem. </s>
<s> That's the honest answer. </s>

<s> OT: How was the pumpkin pie yesterday? </s>
<s> As Sheriff Andy use to say, &quot;Mighty good pumpkin pie Aunt Bee, mighty good&quot;. </s>
<s> Was it that good? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Ahh. </s>

<s> by Big Steve The pumpkin pie is in the oven. </s>
<s> Did you mean there is no more pie or that your Mrs. burned it in the oven and that there was no pie yesterday? </s>
<s> If it was the latter, sorry to hear about that. </s>
<s> Unlike the cake is a lie ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=the+cake+is+a+lie ) the pie existed for a short time. </s>
<s> Now much like a Black Friday sale item it is gone. </s>
<s> Well it must have been good. </s>
<s> I had one here at my house, my neighbor, Mrs. Smith made mine. </s>
