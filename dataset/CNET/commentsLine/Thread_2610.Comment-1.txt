i moved to linksys after my 2nd netgear wireless increasing lost range (my first one died outright).
but as it still has a little life in it, anyone know if it's possible to bride the netgear to linksys so extend wireless range?
i've also wondered if a macairport could be used for the same purpose?
or do i have to stick with netgear?
thanks in advance for any ideas.
