<s> I have a Dell 4550 running a P4 2.6 with 1 gig of ram. </s>
<s> My current video card is a GeForce4 ti4800 AGP. </s>
<s> The card has been wonderful and I play almost all games with video settings maxed out. </s>
<s> I've been wanting to get a new video card simply because I can't play games like Battlefield2 because the GeForce4 isn't DirectX 9 compliant (or something along those lines). </s>
<s> Can anyone recommend a good card that would work for me? </s>
<s> I'm looking to spen around $150-$250. </s>
<s> I've been looking at a GeForce 6800, but to be honest, I can't sort out the different models too well. </s>
<s> I have a 4x AGP controller. </s>
<s> On a simple level, will I be seeing any improvement going to an 8x card? </s>
<s> Yeah, I believe a 6800 is your best bet when it comes to a AGP slot. </s>
<s> This seems like a very nice one. </s>

<s> Or if your for little more power this would be a very nice addition and it seems to be in your price range. </s>
