I have a dualview setup working off of a PNY FX5200 Nvidia card with a ViewSonic A90f+ as my secondary monitor and a VS 900 LCD as my primary. My question is whether the factory drivers are really necessary or will the drivers within Windows XP Pro suffice. Am I giving up any quality doing without or should I update. Thanks for your help in advance
