Did not know you can test your ram and HD without any OS set up.
Doing it now.
The CD works as my friend formatted his laptop and his computer using it, I have an old cd of Windows ME from my sony desktop and when I run that a gray screen appears saying that the cd is not from this machine.
I did the ram test with Memtest86, my first run through it at about 10 min into the session th pc restarted leaving the cd in the machin kept restarting non-stop until I removed the cd.
(no errors were found I think it got to about 37%) I am retrying the test again.
