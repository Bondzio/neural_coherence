Make sure the graphics card is seated firmly and screwed in.
Make sure any power connectors that went to the card are plugged back in (6 pin, 8 pin) (this often doesn't apply unless its a powerful card) Make sure the RAM is in the same slots you took it out of.
Don't ask me why, motherboards are weird like that.
Try powering on with only one stick of RAM, try the other stick if it still doesn't work.
Make sure the power supply is plugged into everything it's supposed to be plugged into (motherboard especially).
If you removed the heatsink and CPU cooler, double check you put it back on right.
This is all I can really think of right now.
I am leaning towards RAM being your problem if the monitor is powering on.
Do you have a speaker installed for beep codes?
