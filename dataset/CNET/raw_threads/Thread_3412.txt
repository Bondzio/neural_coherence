9273	0	3386	40044	NR	opack	11/19/03 7:00 AM	1.0692252E12	New computer won't boot	I am building an intel computer with mobo D865GBF with a Pent. 4 2.6, OCZ 1Gb PC 3200 running in dual channel mode, WD Raptor 36, onboard video, and I am not getting any video. I beleive the cpu is not dead, b/c after removing the fan header, the heatsink warms up. I am getting no POST beeps, the HD Light and Power light lights up, but thats as far as it goes. I have installed a new power supply (Antec True 430), and have all the connections in place. I have removed a stick of memory, removed all the perfs. including the HD, FD, and still nothing yet. I have even removed all the memory completely to see if I get a memory POST beep, and I do (Three long ones). Than as soon as I put the memory back in, I go right back to square one. I even added a Matrox AGP video, maybe thinking that the default BIOS is AGP, and not On-board, but it is not. I still get no video, and more importantly, no POST beeps with the memory installed. I have a green diode lit up on the motherboard, indicating MoBo power. Is it possible that the memory is shot? What about the MoBo? Processor? I would think that if it were the MoBo or Processor, I wouldn't get any POST if I take out the memory. These are all brand new parts. Any help would be greatly appreciated. The Sony monitor does nothing. I have even tried putting back in the old AGP Matrox video card. I have reset the CMOS, took out the battery, removed and reset the CPU. Still nothing. Please help!!
