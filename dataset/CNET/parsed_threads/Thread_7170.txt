<s> I wasn't sure where to post this, but I'm a CIS student about to take a Microsoft Windows Server class online, and I'm looking to buy a used server just to fool around with. </s>
<s> I'm currently looking at a used - Dell PowerEdge SC1425 blade server for about $200. </s>
<s> But I've always worked with desktops, I know little about servers. </s>
<s> If someone has any other suggestions on what to look for to deploy an OS over a small network, please let me know. </s>
<s> Should I look at a server like this or just build a desktop type server? </s>
<s> I have for years used old gear to test server setups on. </s>
<s> I'd use anything for the task you are describing. </s>

<s> The only reason I'm looking at this server is because I can get one for $100 with all the parts. </s>
<s> I'd rather a tower, but for the price.... </s>
<s> These usually go into a box that holds the blades. </s>
<s> Be sure you are getting the entire ready to load unit. </s>
