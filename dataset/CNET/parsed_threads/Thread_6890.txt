<s> Yes, you can run them side by side if you have the necessary desk space. </s>
<s> Assuming that you are going to buy a monitor for the G5, then the best thing for you would be to have the two machines on a network with each other. </s>
<s> If your &quot;router&quot; is really a router and not a modem, plug each of the computers into the LAN side of the router and plug the router into the Modem. </s>
<s> That way, both of the machines can access the Internet at the same time. </s>
<s> The printer is another story. </s>
<s> If the printer is compatible with the Mac, see the manufacturers web site, then you can attach it to the Mac and share it. </s>
<s> Or the other way around. </s>
<s> If it is a network printer with its own ethernet connection, just plug it into the router and you can all share it. </s>
<s> If you are not going to buy a monitor for the G5, then you will need a KVM switch so that you can share the Monitor, Keyboard and mouse with each machine. </s>
<s> Make sure that the KVM switch you get can handle USB keyboards and mouse. </s>
<s> Any other questions? </s>
