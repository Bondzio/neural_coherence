i've installed three maxtor 160 gb drives (one original and two replacements sent by the company) and all have suffered from the same noisy clicking sound when asked to perform a task.
the one good thing that i can say about the company is that their customer care team are very good about responding to queries and sending replacements.
however, when the replacements are just as bad as the originals it kind of takes the edge off it.
personally i'm not getting a maxtor drive again.
