<s> And the small light on front keeps flickering at same time.The light i mean is the same light that flickers when you load a cd or dvd ... can anyone tell me what is the problem and can it be cured.Is it some sort of virus anto </s>
<s> The ticking of the hard drive offends some owners. </s>
<s> Any change and they think something is wrong. </s>
<s> Your post doesn't seem to note anything really wrong as the light and the ticking is normal when the machine is working proper. </s>

<s> thanks a lot ANTO </s>
<s> You gave no mention of the Compaq model#, thus to help pinpoint possible reference. </s>
<s> LED/light on frt. </s>
<s> panel isn't enough. </s>
<s> If in fact during a CD/DVD operation the noise is present then consider it aging and reflects the usage as it NOW becomes noisier. </s>
<s> If this is a possible HD operation, then that's more serious. </s>
<s> However, all this needs your attention in order to resolve it. </s>
<s> Your ear is the best tool to determine the operation when the noise becomes present. </s>
<s> If you open case and proceed on this level on inspection maybe it becomes more clearer. </s>
<s> Yes, system can get noisier as time goes by. </s>
<s> if you open case, prepare to clean it out as well at least its worth opening for that alone, if you never clean the system when you had it. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
