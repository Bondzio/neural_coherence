Thanks VAPCMD, because I guess I have now found where the partitioning and formatting presumably is performed.
However, I understand nothing of what I see there.
There appears to be nothing there to &quot;click on&quot; to allow the hard drive to be partitioned or formatted.
As well, VAPCMD said that &quot;no operating system works with an unpartitioned and unformatted hard drive&quot;.
However, my operating system (as you can see) is working just fine and I have never partitioned or formatted my hard drive (I purchased this computer new and am the only user).
So I'm still pretty much in the dark about this subject.
Thanks, though for the responses I received.
If anyone is willing to help futher, I would appreciate knowing more.
