Hi Ramarc, I understand about extending the desktop, but when i try cloning it doesn't work, &quot;use this device as my primary display&quot; is greyed out as my laptop has a Hotkey as you suggest, but when i use it with the TV is connected it doesn't work.
It does work if i connect to my desktop PC monitor though.
any further thoughts?
Regards Mike
