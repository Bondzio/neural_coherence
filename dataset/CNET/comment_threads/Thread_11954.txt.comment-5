I cannot ping the copier after I attach an Ethernet cable to it a d give it a known valid IP on the network.
If I cannot ping it, then I cannot set it up as a network printer which is why I am writing this.
BTW, I plug in a laptop and it picks up an IP with no problem via the same cable used by the non-connecting copier.
