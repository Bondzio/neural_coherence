from what i can determine that 819 gateway was made for the home shopping network.
where are you looking at (link-url) and at what price?
they seem to run from $1300 to $1500 with a 17'' lcd monitor.
some things to consider: the 819 is a pent 4 3.2ghz and has the 540 series processor that does not have the 64-bit support that is in the 6xx series or the new ''dual-core'' processors that is in the 8xx series.
my suggestion would be one of these new gateway computers that have both 64-bit & dual-core processors gateway model 835gm media center pc at best buy with 17'' lcd monitor & printer for $1069.97 has the intel pentium d processor 820 dual-core 2.8ghz.
or the gateway model 840gm media center pc with 17''lcdmonitor & printer and ati tv tuner & pvr for $1269.97.
has the intel pent d processor 830 dual-core 3.0ghz
