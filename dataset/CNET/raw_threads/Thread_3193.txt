Asus A7N8X Deluxe Socket A Motherboard AMD Athlon XP 3000+ CPU 333FSB Barton Retail w/Fan Seagate 80GB Serial ATA HD 7200/8MB/S-ATA-150 Albatron GeForceFX 5200 128MB 8X AGP w/TV Out/DVI PNY 512MB PC3200 DDR 400MHz (x2=1024MB) Sony DVD Burner So then, I was installing a new power supply (because of the old PS fan wouldnt spin correctly causing it to smoke issue)(BUT STILL FULLY WORKING PRIOR TO INSTALLING NEW PS AND HD) and I also installed a new secondary SATA 250 GB hard drive. In addition I cleaned out the case with a can of air and I let that dry. I power it up and all the fans are running but I am getting ZERO signal to the monitor! I got a couple beeps the first time / Wasn't paying attention to the beeps though. I ruled out the monitor by hooking it up to my laptop. I have a video card in the AGP slot (as opposed to PCI slot) and so i thought it was the video card... well at this time I run out to Walmart at midnight and buy a new AGP video card for 100 bucks!! Get it home and it still didn't work. (Will be taking that back today)! So do you have any ideas as to why the signal is not getting to the monitor? Should I try a PCI video card...Everything was fine before I installed that new power supply and hard drive...and I was grounded for static electricity as well... P.S. I do remember removing one of my 512MB sticks to get the hard drive in the rack. Then I put it right back. Would memory affect this?
