it was a core 2 duo area 51 system.
since placing the order in august they managed to be out of: the case the motherboard.
the dvd drive.
the power supply.
machine sat at stage 5 for 3 weeks until i filed a complaint with the floridia bbb.
jumped to stage 8 and sat there for 4 days.
called alienware, they said stage 8 usually takes 24 hours unless there is a problem.
obviously there was a problem so we decided to cancel.
see my review (and others) here:  glad i'm not the guy who waited for them the actually ship.
he's had 2 mobos and the machine still doesn't work.
