<s> hi, i have a problem in win 8 that i had also in win 7, i did update sound drivers and it didn't help. </s>
<s> when i want to hear my self using the microphone i press &quot;listen to this device&quot; (is this tha only way?) </s>
<s> and there is a very small delay but its impossible to sing like that. </s>
<s> i have a laptop, maybe that's the reason because the sound &quot;card&quot; is not a card but a small chip? </s>
<s> my laptop is strong its an HP Pavillion g6 1229ej (cpu- i5 ,4gb ram, 500 gb hard drive, a very good graphics card, but still a laptop so probably the sound device is just a chip?) </s>
<s> so i tried installing asio 4 all :} but it needed a music program to be attached to or something (that's what i understood that it doesn't work on its own) so i downloaded fl studio and played there with the settings and did (i think) change the delay/latency to a less delay but it was still annoying and impossible to sing to a karaoke like that. </s>
<s> is the only solution is buying a sound card??? </s>
<s> and if so, which one is the cheapest i can get that does just that, that's the only thing i need, to fix the microphone delay/latency. </s>
<s> thanks in advance to all that read and help out. </s>
<s> :) </s>
<s> As any sound card must digitize the audio then pass that over to a decoder then to an amplifier this will always result in a delay. </s>
<s> If you had an amplifier then maybe you could do this but... if you watch folk that sing they hold their hand just so to hear themselves better. </s>
<s> In other words, this is not something a sound card can fix. </s>

<s> hi, how 'bout instead of an amplifier, i get a cheap pc speakers that have a mic in and a headphones out, could i hear my self as well, like an amp? </s>
