I want to network two XP 9main PC HOST, and laptop GUEST) (XP Home, and XP pro), the main PC Host is pro, and the laptop (home XP), I have a Switch and DSL Internet.
What IP address should I use?, when I have the IP on auto I can use the internet, when I use this IP192.168.0.1 address I cant log onto the net.
When I use my laptop (Guest) I can see the host PC when I use this IP 192.168.0.1 I can see the host But can see icon on the host PC but it wont communicate
