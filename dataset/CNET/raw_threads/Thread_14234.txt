I mostly use that computer for gaming and graphic/web design. I have never used AMD so I am not sure if I want or can come up with a good system based off their CPU's. However, if someone can come up with some ideas for highend AMD system that will work with what I have in mind; I may take a look. I will list the parts I have come up with so far and I would love to hear any feedback. Also, I have a limit of about 2300 to spend.

4002	2	109968	1250831	1250743	Scott847	6/18/05 10:25 AM	1.1190903E12	Well...	I was thinking of overclocking the 3.73 to 4.0. I have seen gaming benchmarks with the EE overclocked to 4.0 and it was performing only a little bit under the FX-55. Plus, I am guessing the other parts that I am getting will make up in performance in the games. I have a 120 internal and 60 external that I will use. I was thinking about getting one raptor but would only one SATA HD ruin the point of raid? The case is the first Koolance item I listed under &quot;Stuff I already have&quot;. The water cooling system is built into a custom Lian Li case.

Kick on up to the dual processor and it will kick the Pentium's butt. Get a DVD-ROM too. Never know when you might want two DVD drives, hint, hint. Don't wast your time, even thought you didn't mention it, on a dual layer drive. The disks are outrageously priced, about ten bucks each.
