there are a lot of laser printers out there, for a basic reasonably inexpensive one, look at brother i saw one on sale, i believe at office depot for around 70.00 a couple of weeks ago.
as i said there are many manufacturers out there, it depends on what you are doing from a quantitative standpoint.
the best thing to do would be to go and look at a few and compare specifications, cost per page etc.
best of luck!
