1.1.1	I 'm looking to purchase one of these models and wonder if anyone can compare the performance of the SX2800-07 with the Intel Core 2 Quad Q8300 processor and 4GB RAM against the SX2840-01 with the Intel Core i3-530 processor and 6GB RAM .	St
1.1.2	Any comments would be appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	The core 2 Quad runs 4 actual threads and the i3 runs 2 with hyperthreading .	St
1.2.2	The i3 also has graphics on the CPU .	St
1.2.3	While I do n't have personal experience with either of these as mine are different , I think you 'd want to look at your personal needs .	St
1.2.4	If you want to game , you want your own graphics card and not the i3 .	St
1.2.5	If you like to open multiple programs , you want more actual threads .	St
1.3.1	http : //ark.intel.com/Product.aspx ? id=39107 shows VTx not to be a solid YES .	St
1.3.2	I wo n't detail what this CPU feature is but it is growing in importance to many .	St
1.3.3	http : //ark.intel.com/Product.aspx ? id=46472 shows a solid yes to VTx and given the higher clock rate I could safely bet that for almost every use this would outperform the older q8300 .	St
1.3.4	But if you could get the old gear for cheap , it 's still a great choice if the price is right .	St
1.3.5	Bob	St
1.4.1	Thanks for the comments .	St
1.4.2	I 'm not into intensive gaming .	St
1.4.3	I 'm leaning towards the i3-530 machine because of more memory , newer chip architecture and a larger hard drive .	St
1.4.4	Cost of 2 machines is comparable .	St
