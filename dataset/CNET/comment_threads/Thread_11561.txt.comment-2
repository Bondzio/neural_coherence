Split a hair in some respects, I am nodding to # 2 using # 1's graphics card.
As far as processor speed is concerned unless you can think in nano seconds I seriously doubt you notice any difference.
And of course it would depend on what speed you are alluding to, internet speed ( hook ups) notwithstanding.
