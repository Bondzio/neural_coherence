When I pluged it in to my computer today (running Vista Ultimate), nothing happened. I rebooted my computer, checked my device manager (where the device is corretly listed under disk drives), uninstalled and reinstalled the device and driver, and still nothing. I'm trying to access the drive using Windows Explorer to pull files as normal. I noticed an odd clicking or popping sound when I pluged in the drive that I don't remember hearing before. The drive is an Ultra Traveldrive (TD) v1.0. I have made no changes to my computer or Vista (except for maybe automatic updates). Any ideas are appreciated.

Its a h/w problem and no amount of s/w will fix it. I suggest you use whatever &quot;diags&quot; the support website has and check it out. If you have any warranty, use it before it expires. If not and you want to, open ext. case and mount HD(may need an adapter) in order to try to retrieve data. You should try using a rear USB port if using a frt. panel one. Try also another system using rear USB port. Do all this, what are your results? tada -----Willy

Inside is a card connected to the harddrive case. The audible sounds are louder (duh) with the case removed. No change when connecting to the laptop. Should I open up the harddrive case now and direct connect somehow? By the way, all USB ports on this worthless Lenovo are on the side. All input is appreciated.
