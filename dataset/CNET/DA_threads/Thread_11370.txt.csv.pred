1.1.1	I have a 2wire HomePortal 1000SW and would like to get an inexpensive wireless card or USB connector that will work with this system.	St
1.1.2	I have read elsewhere that you have to use a 2wire product, but I find it hard to believe that no one has developed a product to fill this demand (SBC/Yahoo DSL has many customers).	St
1.1.3	Can anyone help with this?	Ques
1.1.4	A 2wire adapter costs almost half as much as I spent to build my daughter's computer.	St
1.1.5	Thanks: Blackflame	St
1.2.1	http://www.dsldepot.com/item.asp?id=24 notes it does 802.11b.	St
1.2.2	That's a standard and the cheapest 802.11b pcmcia card I ever dredged up was 8 dollars.	St
1.2.3	On average it's closer to 20 or 30.	St
1.2.4	It's not proprietary (802.11b) so why not?	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	I use a GetOn from Truckstop.net.	St
1.3.2	Bought it on eBay for $5.00.	St
1.3.3	I work in a small office about 25ft from the portal and it just zips along.	St
1.3.4	Good Luck.	St
