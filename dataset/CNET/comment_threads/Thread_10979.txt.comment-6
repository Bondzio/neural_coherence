That computer has 2 bays for CD/DVD.
So like Willly said just put the new Lightscribe unit in the unused bay.
The power is already there, unused and the new unit will come with a SATA cable to plug into the motherboard.
Dell support site gives a step by step in their service manual.
Also be sure to go to Lightscribe.com and get the latest udates for the Lightscribe software.
Lightscribe is great, but painfully slow.
