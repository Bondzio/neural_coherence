(Disclaimer: I am a newbie to these more complex computer issues) My wife and I just inherited a Seagate External Hard Drive; she uses a Mac and I use a PC.
I've been searching web forums for a way to format the HD so we can both use it, and have not found any solutions.
It looks like the best solution is to use some sort of &quot;NTFS for Mac&quot; program.
I'm hoping you more educated folk can help me out with 2 questions: 1) what sort of NTFS program would you recommend?
and 2) I've seen a number of freeware &quot;NTFS for Mac&quot; programs on the web: are these effective and safe?
Thanks.
