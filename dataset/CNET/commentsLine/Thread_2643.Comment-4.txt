i ordered one from vm last week after doing much research.
i had originally ordered one to be customized from hp.
i also ordered a monitor from them.
i got the monitor (actually 2), and since both were defective, i cancelled my order after spending about 4 hours on the phone with their &quot;tech support&quot;.
arrgh!
i think the deciding factor for buying a vm was this article.
i thought it was very helpful:  good luck!
