i have just completed my installation of an intel pentium d 940 processor on a biostar p4m900m7 se motherboard.
the box of the cpu shows the cpu as intel pd 940 3.2ghz oem.
however my winxp system info (settings/control panel/system) shows intel(r) pentium(r) d cpu 3.2ghz 1.60ghz 1.93 gb of ram physical address extension is this correct?
is my cpu running at 1.6ghz or 3.2ghz?
if i am only running my cpu at half speed, what can i do to change it?
