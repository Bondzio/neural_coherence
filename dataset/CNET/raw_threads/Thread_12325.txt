The CPU is fine according to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARMA_2#Engine http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARMA_2#Engine shows a little but since I can't tell what laptop this is in, I will not research further. You can look at benchmarks and reviews of your laptop but you may know if your laptop runs games OK or not. Most have issues unless they are a gaming laptop. Bob
