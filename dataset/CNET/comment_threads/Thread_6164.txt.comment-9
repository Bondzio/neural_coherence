Looking forward to this project.
The paint + laquer will run no risk of melting and running in to the CRT once back in use again right?
Just wondering, I don't have too much experience in this area.
The monitor hasn't been plugged in for about 6 months now.
It should be discharged, even if it is I'm going to make it a point not to touch any of the components.
As for buttons on the front and knobs, should I remove them, or leave them in tact when painting?
Thanks a lot!
