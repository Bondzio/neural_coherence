<s> I just purchased a WD 500GB External Drive. </s>
<s> I know nothing about working with them, but want to use it mainly for backups and also store photos and music. </s>
<s> First, I would like to know just WHAT I actually Need to back up and how often.I won't need any office information,just general uses. </s>
<s> Also there is little information about how to back up. </s>
<s> I need to learn from scratch the very basics. </s>
<s> Would appreciate any help and information anyone can give me. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>

<s> Hi Red I just recently started using an external drive as well. </s>
<s> What you actually need is a back up program, or just drag & drop. </s>
<s> There are a bunch of back up programs out there. </s>
<s> I don't give much credence to the ones that come with Windows, if only due to failure in the past. </s>
<s> So if someone suggests one here, you may want to look into it. </s>
<s> You can check out some on Cnet, in the download area. </s>
<s> For automatic back up, that may be a great start. </s>
<s> I usually know where my files are (saved to), so I drag them to the drive myself. </s>
<s> This way I know they are backed up. </s>
<s> It also gives me control of what is being copied. </s>
<s> I've had some that backed up everything new or modified, including files I didn't want or deleted. </s>
<s> I know that Nero has a back up program that isn't too bad. </s>
<s> It does ask if you want it to back that file up, which can get bothersome. </s>
<s> They have a program called InCD, that wasn't too bad, that just copied only the new files, in the folders you have already selected. </s>
<s> Some programs (software), has a back up feature. </s>
<s> Just select the drive letter of your external, & they'll do the rest. </s>
<s> How often you need to back up is up to you. </s>
<s> Or often. </s>
<s> Depends on how critical the file is (or it's loss). </s>
<s> A picture of someone vs. a shopping list. </s>
<s> Many people will have many answers. </s>
<s> Often & redundant is the best. </s>
<s> That is, every day & to two separate mediums (drive, disc or online). </s>
<s> So from there, base it on your files & needs. </s>
<s> In a nutshell of learning. </s>
<s> The backup software will ask you where you want to back up to. </s>
<s> Your external drive will have a letter (Not C). </s>
<s> Give the folder a name, or use their default one. </s>
<s> Like Redspix for your photos. </s>
<s> If it's a group back up of everything, it may get a bit confusing at first, till you poke around & see what everything is called (sub folders). </s>
<s> Meaning, a directory Redspix, will than have sub folders (hopefully) of your other stuff. </s>
<s> I use folders by date & sub folders in there. </s>
<s> Example: 01-01-10 is the folder, than folders off that like; Christmas 2009. </s>
<s> One final thing. </s>
<s> Make sure that your external drive shows up under my computer, as a separate drive, with a letter, & remember what that letter is. </s>
<s> There will be an icon of a dive type shown, so it's easier. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, I'm sure you'll have more questions as you learn more about it. </s>
<s> Just ask. </s>
<s> Thank you for the information about external. </s>
<s> Yes, I may have more questions later. </s>
<s> Thanks again, Red </s>
<s> Windows 7 has a nice backup..I tested it..it work. </s>
<s> Nero does as a responder stated...it works. </s>
<s> I bet Roxio does also. </s>
<s> Check CNET downloads....plenty of programs. </s>
<s> Or just use an Cloning/Imaging programs like Macrium Reflect (free) and clone your whole harddrive every few weeks....paid version of it and ACRONIS allow you to clone just files/folders etc. </s>
<s> AND MOST IMPORTANT alot of these external drives come with SW to backup does yours??? </s>
<s> Did you read the booklet on it? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Thanks for answering my post. </s>
<s> I finished backing up yesterday. </s>
<s> I used Windows 7 and ,so far, everything seems to be ok. Will post again if I run into any problems. </s>
<s> Thanks again, Red </s>
<s> Don't count on the ext. </s>
<s> HD for storage over extended periods of time. </s>
<s> If you review the horror stories on ext. </s>
<s> HDs, they do fail and/or become troublesome. </s>
<s> I suggest you consider seriously any true important data get saved/backup/copied/stored on media such as DVD or CD as 1 copy or more. </s>
<s> This needn't be everything but what you consider super critical at least. </s>
<s> Further, don't treat your ext. </s>
<s> HD lightly, it can easily become a victim of mishandling or s/w corruption and this is normal mode. </s>
<s> While, I paint a dire picture here, its better to play safe than sorry. </s>
<s> Take due care... tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Yes, I understand most of the things about Back Up, but not everything. </s>
<s> When I purchased my computer, the first thing I did was make recovery disks. </s>
<s> I had one large external drive so I had a friend Ghost my computer after I went to Windows 7. </s>
<s> I put that drive away for safe keeping. </s>
<s> I also made a repair disk. </s>
<s> So I am pretty well fixed for now. </s>
<s> I just want this disk for backing up important information about the PC on a regular basis and maybe add some photos and music. </s>
<s> Now, here's the latest news that I may need some help with. </s>
<s> I thought I had this disk backed up, but now ,not so sure. </s>
<s> When I go to Explorer and right click the drive-properties, it has zeros like nothing is on it. </s>
<s> It lists two headings that I used but when I click one,it brings up the restore box. </s>
<s> Thats the one I used after I did the install. </s>
<s> The other one is supposed to be the important information and when I click it, a message says that there is nothing to read it with. </s>
<s> Now, I really feel stupid and don't know what to do. </s>
<s> Should I format the drive and start over? </s>
<s> If so, could you explain to me just how to do the process? </s>
<s> I thought I knew, but it seems like I didn't know what I was doing. </s>
<s> Sorry to make this so long, but thought you would need the entire story if you can help me. </s>
<s> Thanks again for any help you can give me. </s>
<s> Red </s>
<s> If you're saying the ext. </s>
<s> backup disk is already corrupted, then reformat. </s>
<s> Use win7 own format routine and be NTFS type, provided of course whatever data is now coming from the working system. </s>
<s> Once done, use win7 own backup pgm. </s>
<s> for such. </s>
<s> Unless, you have other capable back-up(vendor provided) and win7 ready, do what you feel seems OK. Last, whenever using the ext. </s>
<s> HD be sure to actually dismount it via the s/w, once it says done, then unplug it. </s>
<s> If you want to save the current data, then google for &quot;recovery s/w&quot;, I believe the sticky post here as links as well, check it. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Here's what I've found.I may have it correctly backed up. </s>
<s> I went to &quot;Computer&quot;. </s>
<s> My Libraries and Drives are in left pane. </s>
<s> I click my external drive and properties. </s>
<s> It tells me that I have 72GBs on the drive. </s>
<s> That sounds about right for the things I backed up. </s>
<s> It has 2 items listed in right pane. </s>
<s> Under &quot;RayPC&quot;,Properties,it lists the GBs and other information about changes that I can make.The other item on the list is MediaID, which I assume is my personal information. </s>
<s> It opens in Word Pad. </s>
<s> There I find some letters and numbers that I can't tell anything about. </s>
<s> So, I guess I have the data on the external drive. </s>
<s> Is there anything else that I need to do,like make a special folder for it? </s>
<s> I have it set to back up once a week, Sunday, so I'll see if it automatic backs up. </s>
<s> Any other information that I might need would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help Red </s>
<s> About not counting 100% on external hard drives for backup. </s>
<s> I had a 120 Gig drive I used to backup all files,documents, pictures and such. </s>
<s> I am also from the old school about always double covering yourself with anything important. </s>
<s> I have pictures that can't be replaced so I also burned everything to DVDs The external drive crashed after a year, but I really didn't lose anything because I have everything on DVD. </s>
<s> DVD/RW and CD/RW blank media is cheap and well worth the time and investment. </s>
