<s> Hi Client of mine has got NAS LaCie d2 Network is installed on his LAN and it was mapped to a public ip address for an ADSL router. </s>
<s> Private ip address for NAS LaCie d2 Network is 192.168.10.50 and it is mapped to 87.67.x.x (not real WAN ip) with port 21 as can be seen below : http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=8x0745&s=3 From any remote location when I type in in a browser this ftp://87.67.x.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I can access the folder on the NAS LaCie d2 Networ as can be seen on the snapshot below : http://i25.tinypic.com/zuidsw.png Rather than driving to the clients site and access through his LAN, I need to access the NAS remotely to update few configuration. </s>
<s> How can I remotely access web interface for LaCie d2 Network? </s>
<s> I tried to read the documentation below but I could not locate the section that is related to what I am looking for http://www.lacie.com/download/manual/d2Network_en.pdf Thanks </s>
<s> Set up some remote access like VNC or even Windows Remote Desktop and then you can access it from there. </s>
<s> As to FTP, it appears you forgot port 20. </s>

<s> &gt;&gt;Set up some remote access like VNC or even Windows Remote Desktop and then you can access it from there.&lt;&lt; This is one option to access it.But how can I access it as http if it is feasible ? </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;it appears you forgot port 20&lt;&lt; Yes I did not configure that ,,,,Do i need to configure that as well ? </s>
<s> right now it is working without port 20 has been configured. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I'll skip the discussion about port 80 blocks by ISPs. </s>
<s> You could try 8080 or other ports for the web server in that product. </s>
<s> As to port 20, it's part of FTP so need I write more? </s>
<s> Also worth noting is some ISPs block FTP. </s>
<s> I don't need to write why but this and other common server ports are too often blocked. </s>
<s> This area is slamming a few out there. </s>

<s> Hi Bob &gt;&gt;I'll skip the discussion about port 80 blocks by ISPs.&lt;&lt; No this is not the case for me. </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;You could try 8080 or other ports for the web server in that product&lt;&lt;. </s>
<s> What do mean I can try ? </s>
<s> could you please explain ? </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;As to port 20, it's part of FTP so need I write more?&lt;&lt; Yes I konw that port 20 is a data port on a server side. </s>
<s> When the client uses active mode, the server only needs to receive connections on port 21, so forwarding only port 21 is sufficient for that. </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;Also worth noting is some ISPs block FTP&lt;&lt; This is also not my case. </s>
<s> I think we're done. </s>
<s> I offered the most common workaround when that happens. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I don't see where you tried that. </s>
