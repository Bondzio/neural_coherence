i've been happy with a canon pixma ip2000 printer, and can replace the 2 ink cartridges for less than $2.00 each.
a new canon printer, &quot;free&quot; with my camera purchase, uses proprietary cartridges which cost $30 each, so i'd like to find a replacement for my trusty ip2000 which will use generic and inexpensive ink.
do you have recommendations?
