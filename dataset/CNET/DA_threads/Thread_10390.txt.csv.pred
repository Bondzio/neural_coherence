1.1.1	I was wondering if it is possible to run Mac OS from an external hard drive.	St
1.1.2	Currently I have a Dell with an Intel Core Duo 2 CPU 2.00GHz and 3GB of ram.	St
1.1.3	The external hard drive is a Hitachi 1TB.	St
1.1.4	Would I be able to partition the external hard drive so I can use it with windows and maybe(if possible) run Mac OS from it.	St
1.2.1	The forum policies disallow discussions that break that OS's license.	St
