ok the skinny!
if you like to game 8meg cache or, if you like to have multiple windows open and do not have a lot of memory onboard also go with the 8meg cache otherwise the only other reason to have it is for the future when you will do these things and need it.
also the warranty is much better because the drive is not taxed as much with the 8meg cache.
whereas the 2meg cache must work more often to do the same work read/write or i/o if you prefer.
