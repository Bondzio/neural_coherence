i also am looking at getting either the hp2610 or a canon mp73.
epson i will avoid due to the amount of ink it uses, a close friend bought the epson and luckly it broke down after 2weeks and they could change it to the hp2410.
they had used over half the ink already in that short time just with normal printing at the cost of ink that is expensive.
