i have the same cd r/w / dvd combo drive and have had a hell of a time with it!
from incorrect copying of my files, to not alowing me to r/w my r/w disk, to not recognizing my r and r/w disk, not to mention the failure to play all regions formated dvds.
i am seriously considering getting an external replacement drive and uninstalling this god damned combo drive and throwing it in the garbage heap of all the other poorly designed drives and p.c.
devices.
combo drives at this point in time are imperfect at best useless at worst.
the problem is laptops and notebooks rarely can handle more then one cd rom/dvd rom drives, so unless you dare try to find a non-combo drive that will be compatiable with your laptop and not require a+ certification to install, an external drive(s) are your best bet.
windows default drivers are often troblesome and very often not compatiable with your devices.
sometimes your device(s) will work but not to their full potential because of imperfectly matched and/or outdated drivers (such as the cd part of your drive working but not the cd/r and cd/rw part).
uninstall your combo drive and get an external dvd r/w drive (if money is an issue try e-bay or if you prefer new, comp usa is a good choice  .
good luck and damn sony and their expensive and buggy computers and devices .
