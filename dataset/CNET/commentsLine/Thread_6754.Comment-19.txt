i am writing in an effort to discuss some major problems that i have had with my laptop.
it is an hp pavilion dv5220us.
i have had issues with it since i purchased it from staples.
i have contacted the company several times, but they have refused to offer me any assistance.
the last individual that i spoke with advised me that if three people who purchased that same model number call customer service and file a complaint, the laptop will be recalled and we will be given new laptops.
the main problem that my laptop has is that it shuts itself down all the time without my advising it to do so.
i will be in the middle of a term paper and it will just shut itself off.
if you have experienced the same problem with your hp pavilion dv5220us, i urge you to contact hp customer service at 1-800-474-6836. please post here if you decide to call.
i would like to keep track of the number of people who call in, so that we can make hp follow through on its word.
only two people need to call with this complaint in order for new laptops to be sent to us.
please call if you have experienced this same problem.
it is frustrating and we should not have to deal with it.
thank you for your time!
