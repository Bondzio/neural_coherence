<s> I was thinking about upgrading my mother board for my computer. </s>
<s> I was wondering if there are any steps I need to take and how to do them to find out compatibility of mycase and motherboard. </s>
<s> Like I have a Compaq Presario SR1330NX Desktop: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&cc=ca&docname=c00280664&product=443740&dlc=en&lang=en And was wondering how I would go about finding a motherboard that would upgrade my system and allow me in the future to perform other upgrades and such? </s>
<s> But yeah, are there any real steps needed, and if so, could you explain and help me? </s>
<s> OEMS would require a new os to as the hardware is only compatible with the factory os. </s>
<s> Also, drivers aren't standard,and would need to be backuped prior to the installation of a new os. </s>
<s> As for the ocmpatibility, just make sure the powersupply motherboard cable (24-pin ,etc...) is the same on the motherboard. </s>
<s> I would highly not suggest upgrading the motherboard. </s>

<s> Recently I have been looking at http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813127225 Recamended(sp) by a friend. </s>
<s> I was just wondering, do you think I would be able to use this problem free? </s>
<s> Right now it looks like a great price for how much he was hyping it up and telling me how it would improve and benefit me so much. </s>
<s> 65 bucks after a rebate so, my question, do you think it would work in my case? </s>
<s> Is it a smart buy? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> The OS is locked to the HP machine. </s>
<s> A surprise upgrade cost will be a new XP (or other) license. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The upgrade may tax the old power supply. </s>
<s> While this can be cheap many upgraders forget the stock power supply may not be up to the task. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Internal wiring. </s>
<s> While I don't have much issue here some will give the market failing marks on how to wire up the reset, LED active, USB and more connections. </s>
<s> Usually by your second or so upgrade you've learned your way out of this. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> The OS won't boot on the new machine from the old hard disk. </s>
<s> If the upgrader is new, some confusion will happen and too often they lose their files. </s>
<s> Hopefully this list of possibly issues will help you avoid them. </s>

<s> note &quot;CAN BE&quot;! </s>
<s> It can be a nightmare too. </s>
<s> Upgrading a proprietary box like the one you have is a real crap shoot. </s>
<s> Many unknowns and many potential problems. </s>
<s> The advice you rec'd is a strong caution against doing it based on many years of experience ... </s>
<s> I too recommend you choose another approach to a new PC. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I have been. </s>
<s> Ive been looking at different things on the internet and Ive chosen to start building a pc instead. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Ive been reading and stuff, and ive been like intrested in computers for years but always felt out of the loop, like people talking way over my head. </s>
<s> But, I've read some stuff and it doesn't sound all that complicated. </s>
<s> And I recently started working again so I have a steady cash flow coming in that Im going to spend. </s>
<s> I had only opened a computer once before to install a NIC card; I just decided to build my own rig since it would be completely for gaming and the ones from places like alienware are way too expensive. </s>
<s> There are many online tutorials that help you through the process of assembling your computer - it truly is not that complicated. </s>
<s> I got a lot of help from people on these forums and was able to get out for under $1000, but the rigs value is much more than that. </s>
<s> post it here along with a description of the intended use. </s>
<s> Just surfing the NET ? </s>
<s> editing videos, running PhotoShop ? </s>
<s> playing games ?, how many hours per day ?etc,. </s>
<s> The more specifc you can be ...the easier it is for users to make suitable recommendations, You'll usually get plenty of comments. </s>
<s> And by all means read the buyer comments on those products you're interested in at places like NEWEGG.COM. </s>
<s> Armed with all the info you can order the parts and search the WWW for sites that have good step-by-step infio in 'Building-Your-Own PC'. </s>
<s> Let us know how it goes. </s>
<s> VAPCMD Good Luck.... </s>
<s> I have my list semi set up already. </s>
<s> Ive opened my PC plenty of times to install harddrives, cd burners, replace psu, add a fan. </s>
<s> So Im not completely new inside a PC. </s>
<s> The only thing that somewhat scares me even after reading stuff on the net would be the processor. </s>
<s> I dont know why but that just seems from what Ive read to be over me. </s>
<s> Most of my stuff would be coming from newegg and I always read the buyer comments just to get an idea of what they thought and if anything was bad. </s>
<s> Most of the times its just &quot;good product, fast shipping etc&quot; Theres not to many &quot;Not reccamended&quot;'s. </s>
<s> But yeah once I more finalize my list, I will probably post here and try to get some ideas. </s>
