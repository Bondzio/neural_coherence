alas, the memory advisor on  in an alphabetical list of hp models has nothing between &quot;presario&quot; and &quot;professional&quot;.
so no &quot;probook&quot;.
so you might have to check the manual about what type of memory it has and what's the maximum amount.
luckily, i understand it now has 4 gb and for most people that's enough.
