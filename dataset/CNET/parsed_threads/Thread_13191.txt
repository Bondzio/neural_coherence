<s> Hi, I want to buy this capture card to transfer some VHS tapes in my computer. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any experience with it ? </s>
<s> Also, how would I capture the sound from the VHS ? </s>
<s> The only sound output is an RCA jack. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> I used the ATI and Hauppauge cards for the CAPTURE step with the AUDIO plugged into my PC's audio line-in jack. </s>
<s> After the capture I used Ulead.com's (demos are there) for the video to DVD creation. </s>
<s> The downside to this is that you can count on 6 to 10 hours of work for each 1 hour of DVD. </s>
<s> Not that you sit there for each hour, but that's the usual time it takes for the PC. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I have hunted high and low for my software disk for this card to no avail. </s>
<s> Is it possible that I could get you to duplicate yours for a fee? </s>
<s> Please help me, all I want to do is copy some camcorder video to digital. </s>
