Its dead. I have a Samsung SM-332B combo drive. The old firmware version was T-408 (from Dell). I downloaded and installed version T-406 from the Samsung website. Kaput. I did a system restore to the previous day with no luck. How do I get back or get a copy of the old firmware? It's an older Dell Dimension running XP SP2. Hey, at least I took some notes. Thanks
