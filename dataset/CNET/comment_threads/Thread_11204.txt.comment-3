Understand you to say we can't configure card until plugged into college LAN.
We have dial up at home, no network.
Are you saying Windows doesn't have drivers to support card and that we will have to find driver at a website?
College recommends SMC or 3COM cards and sells them and cable at the bookstore.
I was hoping to get the job done at home before the move.
