Well anyways I know a fair amount about computers so I have decided to build my own. These are some of the parts I wanna use for my comp. But there is still somethings I have not figured out yet. CPU AMD Athlon 64-bit 90nm 3800+ CPU with &quot;Venice&quot; core MOBO Asus A8V Deluxe Mobo ATHLON64 S939 K8T800PRO DUAL DDR AGP 5PCI SATA 1394 SOUND 1000LAN Video Card eVGA E-GEFORCE 6600GT 128M DDR3 AGP8X VGA DVI HD OUT VIDEO CARD Memory CORSAIR VALUE SELECT DUAL CHANNEL 1024MB KIT PC3200 DDR CAS2.5 2X512MB That's what I've pickeed out so far, I still need a psu(prolly 450-500W would be good), cooling stuff and a case. BTW, I'll have about $1200 cdn to spend and I allready have mouse/keyboard and a monitor. So if any one could comment on the choices and reconmend a psu, case and cooling stuff that would be great. Also tell me if I forgot something that I will also need (Not cd/dvd/floopy tho). Incase this matters I will probably get this stuff around the end of may so tell me if something good will be coming out by then, that I should consider getting.

Same set up here, just slightly diff video card. Get the Hyperion driver 4.55..... Nvidia 3 or 4 chipset or Intel may be a better &quot;out of the box&quot; solution. Took several starts before the false temp warnings quit. --------------------------------- On the other hand, some video operations that took 30 minutes are now reduced to 3 minutes. Is very fast board using dual channel corsair. --------------------------------- Since Im using a 2wire modem/router, the worse I ever get is a few cookies. Hardware firewall. Yes I use the 3 main tools, spybot, adaware and spyblaster. So for now no SP2. --------------------------------- Originally I did a repair install of XP with the new board. No satisfaction. Slow boot.

One feeds the 4 pin CPU power connector, the other feeds the mobo and drives. This provides cleaner power to the CPU during high transient conditions. Don't get confused by seeing the minus 12 volt rail on the supply list [normally 2 amps or less, and no longer used]. You want two Plus 12 volt outputs listed for the supply, each with substantial current capability.

10321	8	97696	1125008	1113958	John Robie	4/14/05 12:24 PM	1.11348144E12	Re: New Computer	Hi Kirby, With that powerful and up to date Athlon 64 + 3800 (Venice) CPU, why don't you also go modern and not be outdated soon by switching motherboards to the Asus A8V-E Deluxe with the PCI-Express Technology. It only costs (NewEgg) $29 more than the Asus A8V Deluxe (AGP). PCI Express Architecture &quot;PCI Express is the latest I/O interconnect technology that will replace the existing PCI. With a bus bandwidth 4 times higher than that of AGP 8X interface, PCI Express x16 bus performs much better than AGP 8X in applications such as 3D gaming. PCI Express x1 also outperforms PCI interface with its exceptional high bandwidth up to 500MB/s. The high speed PCI Express interface creates new usages on desktop PCs e.g., Gigabit LAN, 1394b, and high-speed RAID systems.&quot; http://www.asus.com/products/mb/socket939/a8v-e-d/overview.htm For the video card: The Nvidia GeForce 6600GT PCI-E card is the same price as the AGP (NewEgg low $175). If you can afford it the 6800GT PCI-E ($379) would be much better.
