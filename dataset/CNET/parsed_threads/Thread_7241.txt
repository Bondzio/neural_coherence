<s> Planning on purchasing this system. </s>
<s> Most reviews have a con that says no 64 bit windows, but when I configure it, it comes with 64 bit vista and I can bumpit up to 6MB Ram. </s>
<s> What's the story? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> What software do you run that supports over the usual 2GB? </s>
<s> While it's nice to be leading edge they don't call it the bleeding edge without reason. </s>
<s> Tell us what you run that would use this memory. </s>

<s> My interest in the memory was more reactive. </s>
<s> I bought a dell about 5 years ago that came with rambus memory. </s>
<s> Now that I want to add more memory to it, that rambus memory costs an arm and a leg! </s>
<s> The new system alreay is upgraded to 4gb so that might be fine. </s>
<s> My question was more about the reviews that list in the &quot;cons&quot; - no 64 bit windows, yet Dell says it comes with 64 bit vista and can support memory beyond the 32 bit limitation. </s>
<s> Let's say your question was &quot;Why did this review write 'no 64 bit Windows' yet when I went to Dell I can get it?&quot; The answer is to look at the date of the review and see if it is outdated. </s>
<s> RDRAM is a long story on its own. </s>
<s> But 5 years on one machine is not bad. </s>

<s> Expanding upon the points Robert mentioned, let's say, just what is the purpose of the system with 64-bit included. </s>
<s> In most cases if you have no directly supported s/w for 64-bit use, its a waste. </s>
<s> Further, though the 64-bit can readily support 32-bit s/w, etc. </s>
<s> it still just waits to breathe fully regardless of memory installed. </s>
<s> For all intends and purposes think of it as a Ferrari, having to go only 2mi. </s>
<s> to work and at 35mph, other than show and tell, a family van would have gotten the job done. </s>
<s> But heck, if you want it its not going to hurt overall too greatly provided you want simple demands from it and then expand from that. </s>
<s> Of course, any glitches, etc., they have to be 64-bit world fixes. </s>
<s> Why not google for 64-bit issues and base something on that. </s>

<s> In my earlier post, I should plainly explained to use 64-bit fully or at all, requires 64-bit &quot;h/w&quot; as well. </s>
<s> The drivers thus must be MS ready for 64-bit usage. </s>
<s> In Vista it's all the more harder, not only finding 64-bit ready s/w but Vista has not been warmly supported as one would like. </s>
<s> Though, this is a big problem as in XP it still prevalent as well. </s>
<s> Vista was suppose to clear problems found in XP 64-bit version but it seems things aren't all that good. </s>
<s> Let's just say, if you can avoid 64-bit usage as a beginner there are problems in plain old 32-bit to deal with that seem more solvable. </s>
