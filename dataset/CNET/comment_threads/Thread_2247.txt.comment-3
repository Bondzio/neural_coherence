I knew it wasn't backwards compatible since I think very few sockets have been if any, but I'm thinking of basing my self build off that with the Athlon 3500+ also if you buy and socket AM2 off NewEgg you get a free OEM FarCry copy WOW!!
so they either have far too many FarCry copies or aren'r selling enough AM2s.
Well anyway I only dislike how I can't find a nice motherboard with 2 ATA slots so if I want more than 2 optical drives I need to buy a controller card for ATA.
