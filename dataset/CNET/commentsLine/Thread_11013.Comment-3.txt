the cantenna is thick and big, i need something thin that i can put on my project enclosure, it has to be lighter than lets say 200-500 grams, and as small as possible with at least 6+ dbi.
im pretty sure you are right and this antenna is cheap and a piece of garbage but i couldn't find a better alternative, you might.
thank you for your reply and i hope that someone will have a solution to my problem.
thanks
