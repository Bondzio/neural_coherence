I have a Dell E310 computer, and I would like to buy a graphics card.
I've wanted to play Battlefield2 and Call of Duty 4.
I just can't seem to find a decent graphics card for my computer though, I know my computer cant handle a x16, and I was hoping I could find a x1 or something for it.
The best I've found is here: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814143032 If anyone could find something better, that would be nice.
Thank you.
