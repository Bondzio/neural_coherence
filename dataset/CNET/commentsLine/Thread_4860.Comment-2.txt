here's the rub, you can install as many oses as you like &quot;provided&quot; they don't interfere with each other.
now, saying that and doing that are two different things.
trail and error is the most instructive lesson you can learn.
you already got a difficult setup now with xp sp1 and sp3 both installed.
so, if you don't want your hard work wasted, take it one step at a time.
the boot.ini file will have to involved during all this, so i suggest you save the current working one and/or ntldr file to return to before if all fails.
in a round about way, if you've tried the &quot;live ubuntu cd version&quot; you get an idea how that os will work.
you can &quot;sandbox&quot; it using a &quot;virtual setup&quot; allowing its install within its parameters and see how things work.
google more for virtual and check it out.
i assume you already have some arrangement now to tell which os to boot, like the startup menu.
