i'm thinking you should install the latest drivers all around from the makers (no microsoft involvement!)
&quot;after about 5 minutes of use the screen goes blank,&quot; this sounds heat related.
if this was my machine the case cover comes off and and stays off till it's fixed.
i dust it out, hit the heatsinks with compressed air and retest with the cover off.
good luck, bob
