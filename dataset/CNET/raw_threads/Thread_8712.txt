I know I have not had a reason to reload my computer for some time but have done at least one other P4 2.8 and I always thought they were quick until now. This E Machine is running factory and not over clocked and I am surprised as to how quick it is. Should'nt the performance on these two computers not be closer. Looking for opinions and not any real tech stuff I wouldn't understand. Thanks

On which I use to run program for PIC MicroChip Emulator, to test programs that I make for PIC Processor. At that time I also had a P4 2.8, 1GB Laptop. But one of the guys from my office walked up to me and asked me to exchange his laptop for mine, his was a brand new Athlon 64, with 512MB but it had few other things like Wireless and better looking screen, he wanted to exchange it because I had a serial port on mine. So I thought it was a good deal but not a great one, still I did exchange it, after installation I Ran the same emulation program to my surprise the program actually was running 5-6 times faster. Which is really amazing. BTW if you want your machine to boot really fast don't install MS Office, I use OpenOffice and it really boots up faster and works faster after being booted up.

Also the P4 I did awhile ago was fresh as well and was not noticeably faster than mine. I have looked into comparisons at various sites and found these configurations should be close in operation speed. Are Athlons normally quicker at start up?
