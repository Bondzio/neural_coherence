Many berate the printer companies for printers that only last a few years, but the prices have come a long way so some slack is needed.
Do we really need to return to 1,000 dollar printers so you can get 10 years of use?

It's this simple.
Some ink is on a roller, guide or another part along the paper path.
If you can't clean it up, then you buy a new printer.
