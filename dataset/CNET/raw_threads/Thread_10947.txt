4362	0	127814	1444319	NR	martylk2	9/27/05 7:40 PM	1.12785E12	Anybody with Ultra power supply comments?	Seems Ultra has what I'm looking for in a power supply: At least 25 amps on the +12V. Modular design - use only the cables needed. Powerful enough for a powerful rig. Not too expensive. I don't know anything about Ultra, though, but did read a somewhat favorable review at PCStats. Thanks for any comments
