windows is managing my connection, with me testing on so many browsers i made sure that the firewall didn't get in the way....remember that when i type the ip address in the address bar it works....so why not work when words are used?.....my router firewall isn't the issue i think because the computer gets through to the internet....we don't use vpn....unfortunatly i only have a desktop.... thanks for the suggestions...
