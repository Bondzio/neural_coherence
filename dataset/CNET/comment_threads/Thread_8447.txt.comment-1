This is a pretty noob type question, and you'd think this would be a common question with tons of information on the net.. but god knows I cant find it.
Anyway I'm wondering in medium-to-high end gaming and average desktop applications what is the real-world difference between dual and single core processor(s)?
And why does an intel dual core at 3.0( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16819116212 ) cost nearly the same an AMD dual core 2.0 ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16819103562 ) I'm sure there is some obvious answer I'm not aware of.. so someone educate me!
