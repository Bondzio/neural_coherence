<s> hi all just got two 1tb external hard drives both are WD Elements usb 2.0 exact same models. </s>
<s> my computer will pick both of them up but not at the same time. </s>
<s> it will also pick up one of them at the same time as my flatmates external wich is different brand, but cant seem to work out how to get both mine at same time. </s>
<s> anyone got any ideas? </s>
<s> im running a: hewlett packard compaq presario cq61 windows 7 home premium 2gig ram 32bit os if u need futher details just ask. </s>
<s> cheers to anyone that can help </s>
<s> I can't explain why the makers don't fix that. </s>
<s> It's technical and has to do with device identifier numbers in the USB chips on the products. </s>
<s> More at http://www.beyondlogic.org/usbnutshell/usb5.htm Notice that if a vendor cheaps out and does not have unique serial numbers as well as other entries your issue can occur. </s>
<s> You can try putting one of the drives on some USB hub but it's a sign that there is a problem with the production of said product. </s>
