1.1.1	Sorry for if this sounds ludicrous but I wanted to troubleshoot as best as possible w/ as little headache as possible.	St
1.1.2	I just finished building a new PC from scratch.	St
1.1.3	When I went to plug in my monitor (HP w2207h) I see that the mobo accepts DVI (and HDMI) and the monitor has VGA (and HDMI).	St
1.1.4	Since there is no VGA to DVI adapter, I am thinking I may need a new monitor (which is fine, if this is the case).	St
1.1.5	I tried to use the HDMI but the monitor says that is does not detect the HDMI input and goes to sleep.	St
1.1.6	Does something else need to be installed, perhaps?	St
1.1.7	I need a screen so I can access the BIOS and later install my OS but, as of now, I can not get my current monitor to work with the new build.	St
1.1.8	Thoughts?	St
1.1.9	Like I said, this sounds ridiculous and I feel stupid typing it but I'll take the heat.	St
1.1.10	If I have to purchase a new monitor, is there anything in particular that I should look for so that the monitor &quot;works&quot; without installing software, etc.	St
1.1.11	since this is a new build?	St
1.1.12	Thanks for any feedback that can be offered.	Polite
1.1.13	Trying to troubleshoot w/, as I said earlier, as few headaches as possible.	St
1.2.1	more than 1 HDMI input on the monitor?	St
1.2.2	Mine has 2 , if I select the wrong input I get the same results your'e getting..	St
1.3.1	port on the monitor.	St
1.4.1	Use the OSD setting of the monitor to select or default to HDMI, instead of SVGA if that is the method of setting for use.	St
1.4.2	be sure if required to save that setting as well.	St
1.4.3	Make sure by reviewing the manual for your monitor but a quick check of the OSD should be enough.	Sug
1.4.4	The same applies to your PC, it may need to know where to output the video stream to that device.	St
1.4.5	I checked manual on page 3-8, the HDMI supposely works as an output from an HDMI device like a player, so it may not work as direct HDMI-to-HDMI but still the setting might be the fix regardless.	St
1.4.6	the manual does offer an adapter should work.	St
