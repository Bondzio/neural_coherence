If the controller sees inconsistency between the two volumes in a RAID 1 array, it can often just rebuild it to match the two again.
The ones I've seen offer that option while booting up but I cannot know what you're seeing.
This doesn't usually mean data loss but it would be good to back things up.
From what I've been reading about newer drives is that, if they were not specifically designed for RAID use, they will cause problems.
As I understand, it's due to some sort of deep cycling they do that's built into the firmware and part of their error correction routine.
What happens is that one of the two drives may enter this function making it temporarily unavailable.
This can break the array....or so I've read.
Make sure the drives you are using are RAID capable according to the manufacturer.
