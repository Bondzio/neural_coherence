Now with the release of the Mac Mini ( http://www.apple.com/macmini ), it is now an option. My questions are the following: -- Concerning clocking speeds, what does the 1.25 G4 compare to in the PC world? -- Can I put my PC RAM or HDD in this and make it run? Thanks!

The G4 chip is kind of old and isn't really that powerful when compared to many of the newer processors. I BELIEVE the MacMini should run on standard, PC2700 non-ECC 184-pin DIMMs. The HD SHOULD also be a standard 3.5&quot;.
