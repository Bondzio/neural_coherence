for reasons i won't go into-my workplace had a wd 1200jd (?)
8mb buffer drive they wanted converted back to fat23 from ntfs,(grrr) it resisted several efforts but what finally worked was to get a w98se boot disk, (bootdisk.com) make the disk, and also find and put on the disk &quot;delpart&quot;, so that once i booted with the floppy-( the wd i was working on connected as only hd-primary master) i could type delpart at the a:\ prompt,( the usual message from the boot disk about there being no drive present)then rebooted, floppy again- then fdisk, make whole drive primary and active, even though the w98 fdisk lists the total space incorrectly,then rebooted with floppy again and formatted-took ages, but it's what finally worked-then put it as primary slave in a computer with xppro which we have left as fat32, xppro sees complete drive, then used partition magic 9 to gradually break into 30ish partitions -one at a time-reboot each time.. and it finally worked all the way thru-now i can,if need be, make any of them into ntfs, or not// whatever they decide....i may have been able to leave out a reboot here and there-but this had made me so crazy i decided to go for the smallest verifiable steps and reboot..
