I know of no Intel chip capable of running at over 80* C and not melting down and Silicon's melting point is over 2000* C if I remember correctly, but it's the actual transistors (which are not silicon as I recall) will melt at a much much lower temperature AMD's max limit is around 80-90*C the issue is the voltage's are sparatic at those temperatures, it's not the heat so much as it's the voltage that kills it honestly I say you need that CPU running 40* C cooler
