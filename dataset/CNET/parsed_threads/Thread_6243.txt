<s> I have a nook tablet and was trying to use a google maps satellite view or google earth to use as my gps when boating. </s>
<s> I have a cell phone that puts out wifi that i hook up to. </s>
<s> I tried to get google maps to use my location but it kept saying unable to determine location. </s>
<s> My phones screen is to small to see while driving the boat. </s>
<s> Is there anyway that I can get the nook tablet to show my phones screen kind of like how you can get your computer screen to show your cells screen? </s>
<s> If not do any tablets allow you to do this that are not extremely expensive. </s>
<s> Also I wouldnt mind getting a tablet that would let me use my phones wifi and use google maps that would allow the my current position feature. </s>
<s> Sorry for the long post. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> if anyone has any other ideas im all ears( i live in louisiana and the marsh where i fish is not displayed well on most gps systems that is why the google earth view is so good.) </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> I'd move to some tablet with a GPS like the newer Google Nexus at http://www.google.com/nexus/#/7/specs You'll still need to preload maps and possibly enable the wifi hotspot on the phone. </s>

<s> I use an app called foxfi that lets me use the internet on the tablet </s>
