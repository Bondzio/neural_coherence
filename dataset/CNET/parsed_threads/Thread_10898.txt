<s> Hi I wanted to know what the best way to reformat a LaCie HD from a Mac format to a Windows Vista format is? </s>
<s> I have the LaCie big disk 500GB with firewire and USB. </s>
<s> I'm using a format program on my Mac thats making the LaCie into a MS-DOS file system. </s>
<s> Will this work or do I need to try something new? </s>
<s> Thank you for your help. </s>
<s> im not quite sure this would work, but with my hdd [just a normal sata hdd] i go into cmd type convert [drive letter]:/FS:NTFS then if it says Convert cannot gain exclusive access to the drive_letter:, so it cannot convert it now. </s>
<s> Would you like to schedule it to be converted the next time the system restarts (Y/N)? </s>
<s> press y then restart your computer and then it should be done. </s>
<s> may go through a screen before the welcome screen </s>
<s> OK the format that the iMac made on the LaCie worked with Vista, but when I right clicked on the LaCie Vista had a option to reformat the LaCie to the NTFS file system. </s>
<s> I looked on the Microsoft's web site and they talked about how NTFS works with Vista, but don't work with earlier Microsoft OS? </s>
<s> Since I'm only going to use Vista I think having a NTFS systems is not a bad deal with it's better reliability and stuff. </s>
<s> Again thank you for your help. </s>
<s> with XP. </s>
<s> XP could use either FAT 32 or NTFS, however FAT 32 cannot read NTFS, but NTFS can read FAT 32 with no problems. </s>
<s> Thanks for the information people. </s>
<s> It helped a lot. </s>
<s> One more thing do any of you know how to get my external hard drive to sleep when my computer sleeps? </s>
<s> When I had it on my Mac the external went to sleep, but on the Vista it don't. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
