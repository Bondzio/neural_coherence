I have some mobility problems and I can buy the necessary items only on the Web.
I use a nice Teac OX1200 mouse on my office computer and I tried to find similar mouse for my house computer but I cannot find the same model.
Several online shops offer Teac mouse of different models but without enough data to decide if they are what I need.
Is there any Teac catalog with data on the various models of Teac mice?
I could not find such on the Web.
Please advise Thanks
