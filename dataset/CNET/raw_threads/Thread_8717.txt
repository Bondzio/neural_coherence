Hi, Trying to print a stack of &quot;no. 6 3/4&quot; envelopes with my business return address. It works great feeding them one at a time through the MP tray, but when I put a stack in the regulat tray, 75% come out printed crooked. I have the side guides snugged down. The nice guy at Canon hemmed and hawed and basically said my machine may have a problem, then said that model wasn't really designed for that...what the? Anyone have luck printing more than one envelope at a time on a Canon multi functon laser D480?

If the product says it prints on envelopes and if you are giving a few degrees of latitude then call it defective and stand your ground. Bob
