<s> I recently replaced the battery on my compaq presario 1500 because it wasn't charging at all (was always at 0%) and needed the adapter to work. </s>
<s> I bought a replacement battery, put that in and it said it was at 54%. </s>
<s> I check a few hours later, it's at 56%. </s>
<s> I repeat trying to charge the battery over the course of a few days and the most it will charge is still only 56% or 59%. </s>
<s> I leave the computer on with all powersaves off to make sure its charging and same result. </s>
<s> is it the battery? </s>
<s> the adapter? </s>
<s> the voltage of my outlet? </s>
<s> something to do with the contacts? </s>
<s> how do I either &quot;fix&quot; the battery or the contacts or whatever else is causing this? </s>
<s> It's either noted in the manual or on their website. </s>
<s> What you are seeing is normal until you do that. </s>

<s> i tried the battery calibration, not sure if i did it right, but what i did was use up the battery until it was at 0%, then plugged in the adapter and tried charging it up to 100%. </s>
<s> the problem is that after I tried charging it from 0 after plugging back in the adapter, it only got up to 2% and i left the computer on all day. </s>
<s> But I'd read it again and try again. </s>
<s> It's a common problem and it's possible you'll sort it out. </s>
