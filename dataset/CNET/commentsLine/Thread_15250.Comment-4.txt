for your excessive vulnerability.
if you are drawing separate addresses from your isp for the two computers, you are probably being charged extra for the second address.
the technical truth is that you only need one public ip address from your isp.
replace that hub with a common broadband router.
the physical connections will be similar - uplink to the cable modem through the wan port and there will be 4 inside network ports to choose from for the computers.
the router will draw the one public ip and then reissue internal private addresses to all the inside computers.
the router will automatically sort out who gets what from the internet.
the internal addresses will all be in the same range, so the internal computers will be able to share files and printers.
and the address translation between the public ip and the private ip serves as a basic hardware firewall at the network level.
then you can make your own choice of additional security features in a software firewall for the the individual systems.
