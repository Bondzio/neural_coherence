1.1.1	Hi , I has got a 8 system ( Say Node1 , Node2 , ... .. , Node7 , Node8 ) in my LAN Network .	St
1.1.2	i Want a Group a 8 System 's in Such a way that Node 2 Should Ping with Node1 , Node3 Node4 , But not with Node 5 , Node 6 , Node 7 , Node 8. and ViceVersa .	St
1.1.3	Thank in Advance	St
1.2.1	It all really depends exactly what you want to do .	St
1.2.2	In the exact case you specify and assuming that you are using the same subnet for all the machines the solution to this problem is called private vlan .	St
1.2.3	This is a advanced vlan topic where the switch will not allow ports on the same subnet to talk to each other it will force the traffic via a firewall port .	St
1.2.4	This is generally done this way to preserve ip addresses .	St
1.2.5	You could place each machine on its own subnet and vlan and then use a more general ip based firewall solution but it depends on your requirements .	St
1.2.6	In any case you need a firewall .	St
1.2.7	If you can get one that contains enough ports you could plug all your machines directly into the firewall and avoid a switch and the private vlan issue .	St
1.2.8	Firewall tend to get very expensive the more ports you buy so most people use external switches .	St
1.2.9	Needless to say you need commercial firewalls to do this , most consumer ones do not have the ability to run as passive ( ie layer 2 ) firewalls .	St
1.2.10	The only cheap solution I have seen involves running a consumer router that can run dd-wrt firmware .	St
1.2.11	This has many more advanced features and might do what you want .	St
1.2.12	It will not work at a layer 2 level so you would have to redefine your need so that your machines were in different IP ranges and define rules between the IP blocks .	St
1.2.13	If you have a lot of traffic between the machines this will not work well on cheaper routers mostly because they do not have the CPU capacity .	St
1.2.14	Of course if you dig there are methods to use a PC as a router running linux .	St
1.2.15	You could then build your own firewall of any size you wish but it is not a beginner project .	St
1.3.1	So given it 's a LAN or LOCAL AREA NETWORK you would have to redesign it to be 2 LANs .	St
