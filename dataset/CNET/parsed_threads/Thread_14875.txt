<s> My disc drive has dissapeared. </s>
<s> I can boot up and it's still there, and it's still listed under device manager, but programs don't recognize it and it's not listed in my computer. </s>
<s> I'm running xp pro 64 bit and I tried to download Tweakui because I saw that as a solution for someone with a similar problem in these forums but I can't find a compatible version for my windows. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> This issue is usually the same old registry keys noted at this article. </s>

<s> Thank you very much so far. </s>
<s> I might have a 2 part problem. </s>
<s> I deleted the reg keys but 1) there was no &quot;Upper file&quot; where it said there was supposed to be. </s>
<s> So I deleted &quot;default&quot; instead because it said &quot;cdrom/dvd drive&quot; next to it. </s>
<s> Upon restarting my disc drive is visible in my computer and everything else seems to work ok so I didn't break anything with the regedit. </s>
<s> 2) New problem though is that I can't burn using my drive. </s>
<s> It's like the computer knows there's a disc drive but has forgotten that it's able to burn stuff as well. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Sorry but given no title to said software that's the usual fix. </s>
