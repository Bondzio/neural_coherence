You best bet is a wireless extender.
Still you must have a usable signal someplace in the apartment.
All it really does is allow you to not sit at that one place it works.
Needless to say the signal will never be any better that that location so if it does not work well there the extender will not improve it.
Now if you can't get a good signal inside the apartment you will have to go with some form of external antenna.
This gets very complex very fast.
One of the simpler ways I have seen are the antenna that contain access points or routers.
This is one example and this company most likely has what you need but you may need to dig to find something that will work for you and you can afford.
