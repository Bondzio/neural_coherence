1.6.2	I did n't know there was a fault till last Saturday but complained to ISP hundreds of times so is looks as if what setting were there originally got wiped back then as I had to re-install windows and several other bits then ... did n't notice USB card until recently .	St
1.6.3	The DSL modem is in the original USB port on the PC .	St

1.8.1	Hello Stan , with 98se you can re-install without formatting your drive which I try to do a little as possible as only having MS Backup .	St
1.8.2	I know the manufacturer of my card , they are a local company to me but the lines are always busy so impossible to get through .	St
1.8.3	Even trying through the web-site takes days at the moment .	St
1.8.4	Everyone is too security concious in the UK at the moment .	St
1.8.5	I do realise what I have to do but having the time just makes it difficult ... please give me a couple of days ...	Ques
1.8.6	I 'm still waiting for my DSL provider to fix a fault on my DSL as I 'm losing data both ways until it 's fixed ... this fault started back last year and the ISP have just realised that what I 've been telling them for 6 mths is correct .	St
1.8.7	Cheers Stan , whitesnake	St
1.9.1	Stan , I ran a re-install today and got it to work using the generic driver from my 98se disc so USB 2 does work with 98se ... sorry but I had to prove you wrong .	St
