if you are still having issues with less gear, then you haven't found it.
as to the mac address, that's well discussed so i will be short.
only required if your isp locks the connection to a mac address.
otherwise i leave it &quot;stock.&quot; let me share another story of a person with dropping connections (cable and dsl).
turns out they were running torrent software.
even i walked out.
no one can support that.
