When i play games like battlefield or rome total war or any application mostly.
i will be playing or working and then my whole pc shuts down and reboots.
I thought it may have been a power problem but i had a 350 and changed it to 480 and still the problem continues.
Is it maybe a hard drive issue or a heat issue.
2.53 pentium Windows Xp 1gb 2100 ram 7 fans 480w power radeon 9800pro 128mb 80 gb hard drive ( 60Gb empty) I checked bios and the it said that cpu Heat - 48c Pc heat - 28C
