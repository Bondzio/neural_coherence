List the brand and model number here and I'll look it up for you or go to the manufactures web site and see if you can find it's system requirements. I believe this maybe for a camera. Is the camera compatible with Vista is it's driver up to date? What is the make and model of the camera? Sorry it took so long for someone to get with you about this problem.
