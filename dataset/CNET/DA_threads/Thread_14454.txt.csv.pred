1.1.1	Hi, I'm wondering if there is a solution to get the status of catridge, I mean, before I used XP Pro, I got a view of Cartridge-satus everytime I was printing, I could check if it was still enough , or not, and since I installed vista, I get no feedback, the cartridge are staying grey, without any utility...grgrgrgrg Thks for your help!

1.5.2	Anyway, if everybody stay conservative with windows 98,won't be any progress in the future!it's the price to pay when you want improvment,and there is always a small (I hope) phase where the chaos is taking place...but in 6 Month,everythings will run smooth, I'm pretty sure!	St
1.5.3	By the way I found a thread by epson, the drivers will be released,during march fpr the R800,for some other products should be now already on download-site...yeah I have to wait a little bit...but that's life... viva vista!	St
