<s> The issue of Pentium vs. Athlon processors for non-partisan computer buyers goes on. </s>
<s> However, it is all the related issues that are leaving me cold now. </s>
<s> I'm considering ordering a custom computer for business including repeated burning of training DVDs. </s>
<s> I'll probably choose a Pentium 4. </s>
<s> In one recent computer advertisement the following items were mentioned as CPU-related: * 775-pin architecture * 90nm cores * Intel's HyperThreading technology * Compatible with Intel's new 925 and 915 motherboard chipsets * Add in DDR2 support and PCI-E, two of the hottest new technologies available today. </s>

<s> What's the significance? </s>

<s> Every little bit helps &lt;g&gt;. </s>
<s> &quot;With Hyper-Threading Technology, desktop users can experience greater system responsiveness and performance when multitasking. </s>
