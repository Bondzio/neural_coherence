1.1.1	I have a p-4 system with existing 254 ram ddr 266 cl2 pc2100 sdram .	St
1.1.2	i would like to upgrade to 1 gig ram .	St
1.1.3	do i have to follow pc2100 selection or can i choose pc 2700 instead .	Ques
1.1.4	thanks	Polite
1.2.1	PC2700 is typically backward compatible and will run at the pc2100 speed when installed together .	St
1.2.2	However if you motherboard is capable of the faster speed , I would install the pc2700 only , for better results .	St
1.2.3	When the two are installed together , it will only run as fast as the slowest component .	St
