I pulled the side cover off and left it off.
The fans/heatsinks are all fine.
I turned it on and didn't even run any programs.
I figure with the cover off and no programs running heat shouldn't be a problem.
The computer still froze after a couple minutes.
I think I'm going to try reformatting again and turning off the automatic updates to see what happens.
I've heard of people having some issues with those before.
And here I was trying to pin all my problems on itunes!
I think my next computer will be a mac.
