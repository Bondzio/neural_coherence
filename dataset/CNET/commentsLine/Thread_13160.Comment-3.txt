i have a separate nice hp scanner and little brother laser printer and an hp photosmart inkjet printer.
then my husband needed to print out large 11x17 printouts so we got a brother all-in-one.
boy is it nice to have.
it's not even hooked up to a computer all the time.
we just plug in the usb when we need to print from it.
and you don't have to have the computer on just to make a photocopy.
just walk up and copy.
just like a real office copy machine!
