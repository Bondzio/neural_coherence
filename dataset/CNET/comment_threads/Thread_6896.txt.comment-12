Many years ago I ran a few repair shops.
We had service manuals, meters, oscilloscopes and solder irons.
Not only that but the spare parts room was full of the stuff needed for swaps and more.
Today I moved on to other endeavors but keep in touch with various shops that I help at when they have a tough case.
This means I have access to spares if my spares don't suffice.
Yes I've built my own in the past but with refurbs and laptops today I see no reason to build from scratch.
