I do not have access to DSL or cable. I want to network another desktop in my home as well as a printer. EDGE is accessed through a SonyEricsson PC card. I have looked at powerline as well as wireless networking but can not find help or guidance utilzing EDGE connection. Has anyone networked using EDGE? Thanks
