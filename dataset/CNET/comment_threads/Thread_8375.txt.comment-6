Thank you so much!!
It was the BIOS.
I updated to version 1014 and everything seems fine so far.....no freezing or Overclocking errors, and my computer restarts normally with the new RAM in.
It even works with 2 of the old RAM chips in it so now I have 6gb.
I cant wait to get 2 more Kingston chips and have 8!!
:-D Thanks again!
You Rock!
