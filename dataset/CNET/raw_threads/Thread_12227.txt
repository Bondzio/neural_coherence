You can try disconnecting the data and power cables from any of the drives, reduce the RAM to one stick, double check the PSU connectors...the 24-pin and 4-pin ATX connectors and the PSU connector to the video card. If the system won't POST then, the next step is to pull the MB ....put in on a piece of cardboard and start from scratch. Important to have a speaker connected so you hear any beeps which are signals for what's wrong. Here's a good troubleshooting guide from MSI that may give you some some tips. Start with noting but the CPU installed and build from there ...1 DIMM, 2 DIMMs then video, then an HDD Keep us posted. VAPCMD http://www.msicomputer.com/support/sup_tshoot.asp

So the E6700 should work but I think I'm going to get the Q6600 because it's cheaper on Amazon and the motherboard supports it.

Link below confirms	http://processormatch.intel.com/COMPDB/SearchResult.aspx?Boardname=d975xbx2 How about another MB ? Abit IP35 PRO gets great reviews everywhere I read..and buyer reviews are good too. If you stick with the Intel MB...believe they're sensitive to RAM speed. So if that RAM isn't 1.8V...might want to check too. Keep us posted. VAPCMD
