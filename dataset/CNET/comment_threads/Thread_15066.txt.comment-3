system cannot look through the external case's interface and positively ID the drive.
If not, it will rediscover it each time the PC restarts.
I'm suspecting this begins in the BIOS.
You do need to keep keep the drive connected to the same USB port...no swapping...or it finds new hardware.
You can also try assigning the drive letter yourself and see if that works.
But I'd check device manager to see if the external is showing by the actual hard drive's ID which should suggest the manufacturer's name, model # and connection type.
