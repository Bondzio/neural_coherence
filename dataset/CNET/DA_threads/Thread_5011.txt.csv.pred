1.1.1	Heya folks .	St
1.1.2	First time poster , long time lurker & gt ; . & gt ; I 've decided to build a computer for gaming .	St
1.1.3	The last one I built was about four years ago .	St
1.1.4	I 'm really into RTS games and the horrible frame-rate on SupCom is the last straw .	St
1.1.5	My current rig was state of the art when I put it together but a long time has passed .	St
1.1.6	Based on my preliminary research , here 's what I 'm thinking of : CPU : AMD Athlon 64 FX ( Dual-Core ) $ 215 -I & lt ; 3 AMD , so the CPU was a no-brainer .	St
1.1.7	Motherboard : Asus M2N32-SLI Deluxe $ 169 or an ASUS crossfire $ 237.66 -I really did n't know what motherboard would be best for my purposes , but both came highly recommended for my intended processor .	Ques
1.1.8	Ram : ddr2-800 pc2-6400 2gb $ 89.98 x 4= $ 359.92 -Ram wise , well ... let 's just say I 'll probably end up repeating this process another half-decade down the line .	St
1.1.9	Though , I still ca n't figure out the difference between just buying ram and buying a ram kit .	St
1.1.10	hard-drive : Western Digital WD1600YS 160gb sata2 7200MB 16mb bus .	St
1.1.11	$ 69.00 -As far as the hard-drive goes , I do n't really have a use for uber amounts of space .	St
1.1.12	So long as it holds the game , faster is better .	St
1.1.13	video-card : Geforce 8800 GTX Video card , PCIE , SLI .	St
1.1.14	$ 540 x 2= $ 1080 -I think either motherboard was really postured for use with Nvidia cards , otherwise I probably would 've went with Rage .	St
1.1.15	Or something .	St
1.1.16	I marked it down twice because , correct me if I 'm wrong , SLI requires two of the same cards .	St
1.1.17	CD/DVD drive : Plextor PX-810SA $ 99.48 -I do n't write DVDs .	St
1.1.18	I just wanted to be able to put a game in and play .	St
1.1.19	A cheaper alternative more suited to my needs would be welcome .	St
1.1.20	Case : Raidmax katana atx-729WB black steel .	St
1.1.21	Full tower .	St
1.1.22	$ 95.98 -I went with a large tower to hold all the stuff in this list .	St
1.1.23	I 'd heard there were particular problems fitting it all into a mid-size .	St
1.1.24	PSU : Nspiregear 58655 .	St
1.1.25	850W unit .	St
1.1.26	$ 178 -I figured this system would draw roughly 650ish watts .	St
1.1.27	I wanted to overshoot by roughly 200 just in case .	St
1.1.28	As another aside , Nspire is made by Texas Instruments , and I loved my TI-82 to death .	St
1.1.29	Literally .	St
1.1.30	Keyboard : logitech G15 $ 68.99 -Dunno .	St
1.1.31	Heard it was good .	St
1.1.32	Macros are are always welcome .	St
1.1.33	mouse : Logitech G7 $ 56 -Sometimes I get a fixation on FPS .	St
1.1.34	It usually ends poorly .	St
1.1.35	Altogether , this should run between $ 2391.37 - $ 2460.03 , depending on the motherboard .	St
1.1.36	I 've got quite a few concerns before I take the plunge , but I 'd like outside opinion before finalizing any decisions .	St
1.2.1	CD/DVD drive : Plextor PX-810SA $ 99.48 -I do n't write DVDs .	St
1.2.2	I just wanted to be able to put a game in and play .	St
1.2.3	A cheaper alternative more suited to my needs would be welcome .	St
1.2.4	Case : Raidmax katana atx-729WB black steel .	St

1.2.7	I 'd heard there were particular problems fitting it all into a mid-size .	St
1.2.8	PSU : Nspiregear 58655 .	St
1.2.9	850W unit .	St
1.2.10	$ 178 -I figured this system would draw roughly 650ish watts .	St
1.2.11	I wanted to overshoot by roughly 200 just in case .	St
1.2.12	As another aside , Nspire is made by Texas Instruments , and I loved my TI-82 to death .	St

1.2.18	It usually ends poorly .	St
1.2.19	Altogether , this should run between $ 2391.37 - $ 2460.03 , depending on the motherboard .	St
1.2.20	I 've got quite a few concerns before I take the plunge , but I 'd like outside opinion before finalizing any decisions .	St
1.3.1	My advice today is that if you are going to run Windows XP ( gamer 's choice ) then stop at 2GB since it 's a 32-bit OS and you do n't want to repeat all the lessons learned by others about the 4GB issue .	St
1.3.2	Looks like fun .	St
1.3.3	Bob	St
1.4.1	and wherea re oyu getting these prices , its so expensive firstly : look at Intel 's Core 2 Duo line , and AMD 's Athlon64 x2 , you dont need FX ( and it doesnt get you much , unless you 're buying the DSDC set , the DSDC setup would increase FPS in supcom ) secondly , SLI , worthless , get the 8800GTX single , install it , and forget about it , you dont need SLI ( it wont help much with supcomm ) thirdly , ram kit just means you get 2 or 4 sticks of RAM in one package , vs buying each individually , DO NOT GET 4GB OF RAM , Windows XP and Vista 32-bit wo n't even see part of it , and while Vista x64 can see all of it , nothing can make use of it ( its a waste of cash , is what I 'm getting at ) , if you want a lot of RAM , get a 2x1GB kit and a 2x512MB kit and run 3GB of RAM in dual channel , it 'll save you the money on buying another GB , and it 'll be usable the money you 're spending on that optical drive is obscene , look at basically any other brand of DVD burner , it 'll cost about $ 35 , Lite-On and NEC are both great , so is LG I 'd look at an entirely different PSU , as the one you 've selected does n't inspire confidence , check out companies that are revered for their PSUs , not their calculators , such as Corsair , Seasonic Tech , Silverstone , PC Power & Cooling , Enermax , etc if you still want SLI for whatever reason , 850W is skimpy , I 'd look at a different case with SLI too , try Silverstone , Lian-Li , or Antec ( you need more airflow ) , and 850-1000W of PSU from a reputable , known PSU maker honestly , the Kb/mouse are n't worth the $ 100 , you dont need & quot ; gaming hardware & quot ; just to game , if you want a fast response mouse , check out the IntelliMouse Explorer 3.0 from MS , should run you about $ 35 , just as capable as the Logitech , but none of the built up hype , hence cheaper ( even Razer 's mice are cheaper ) check www.newegg.com , you should be able to do a whole system with a 500GB HD ( they only cost about $ 95 ) for under $ 1500	St
1.5.1	I 've just read over the comments posted .	St
1.5.2	I 'll re-work parts and try to find other merchants .	St
1.5.3	I 'm a little strapped for time at the moment ; I 'll be heading out the door in a few minutes to go TDY for a week .	St
1.5.4	Thanks for the insight , I 'll see if I ca n't put it into practice on my return .	St
1.6.1	Just got back and had some time to review .	St
1.6.2	Here 's what I 've come up with so far .	St
1.6.3	CPU : AMD Athlon 64 X2 $ 210 -As per suggestion .	St
1.6.4	Motherboard : Asus M2N32-SLI Deluxe $ 140 -Made a decision and picked this one instead of the crossfire .	St
1.6.5	Ram : ddr2-800 pc2-6400 2x1 gig ( A-Data $ 28x2= $ 56 ) and 2x512 mb ( Wintec $ 20x2= $ 40 ) .	St

1.6.8	$ 60 .	St
1.6.9	-Still not wanting space as much as speed .	St
1.6.10	I wanted something with higher RPM , but I was n't sure if SATA 150 was compatible with the motherboard , so I went for this .	St
1.6.11	video-card : Geforce 8800 GTX Video card , PCIE , SLI .	St
1.6.12	$ 500 .	St
1.6.13	-As per suggestion .	St

1.6.21	$ 230 -I tried to find one under the manufacturers that was recommended , but they did n't have anything on newegg.com that was near the wattage I wanted .	St
1.6.22	I think this one has all the cables I 'll need , but I 'll research it more later on .	St
1.6.23	Total : $ 1454 .	St
1.6.24	Let me know what you think .	St
1.7.1	wo n't get the best bang for the gamimg buck .	St
1.7.2	CPU : AMD Athlon 64 X2 $ 210 ( WHICH ONE ? ? ? )	Ques
1.7.3	-As per suggestion .	St
1.7.4	Still recommend Intel C2D as CPU ... .clearly the CPU of choice for today 's PC .	St
1.7.5	Motherboard : Asus M2N32-SLI Deluxe $ 140 -Made a decision and picked this one instead of the crossfire .	St
1.7.6	Still recommend MB for Intel Platform such as the Abit IP35 Pro http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16813127030 $ 159.99 after $ 20 rebate Ram : ddr2-800 pc2-6400 2x1 gig ( A-Data $ 28x2= $ 56 ) and 2x512 mb ( Wintec $ 20x2= $ 40 ) .	St
1.7.7	-As per suggestion .	St
1.7.8	Personally I 'd buy the 4GB now and decide how to best use it afterwards .	St
1.7.9	Believe you can use it all with the 64bit version of Windows .	St
1.7.10	It 's unbelievably cheap today .	St
1.7.11	hard-drive : Western Digital WD1600YS 160GB 7200 RPM SATA 3.0 Gb/s , 16mb cache .	St
1.7.12	$ 60 .	St
1.7.13	-Still not wanting space as much as speed .	St
1.7.14	I wanted something with higher RPM , but I was n't sure if SATA 150 was compatible with the motherboard , so I went for this .	St
1.7.15	For peanuts more you can get a 320GB or 400GB SATA see here http : //www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx ? Submit=ENE & N=2010150014+103530105+1035915133 & Configurator= & Subcategory=14 & description= & Ntk= & srchInDesc= PSU : COOLMAX CTG-850 ATX 12V 850W .	St
1.7.16	$ 230 -I tried to find one under the manufacturers that was recommended , but they did n't have anything on newegg.com that was near the wattage I wanted .	St
1.7.17	I think this one has all the cables I 'll need , but I 'll research it more later on .	St
1.7.18	******Read here for best info re PSUs .	St
1.7.19	.	St
1.7.20	.	St
1.7.21	http : //www.jonnyguru.com/reviews.html and then check Newegg.com again .	St
1.7.22	.they 've got PSUs from 100W to 1200W and prices with shipping are usually quite competitive .	St
1.7.23	And by all means ... read the buyer comments ... they 're usually quite helpful and informative and helpful .	St
1.7.24	VAPCMD	St
1.8.1	CPU : AMD Athlon 64 X2 6400+ Windsor 3.2GHz 2x1MB L2 Cache AM2 Socket .	St
1.8.2	$ 210 -My bad , failed to specify .	St
1.8.3	As far as AMD vs. Intel , maybe I 'm counter-culture .	St
1.8.4	I just like AMD more .	St
1.8.5	hard-drive : Hitachi Deskstar 7K1000 750GB 7200RPM 32MB Cache Sata 3.0Gb/s $ 200 -Well , I thought the matter over and maybe extra space would n't be that bad .	St
1.8.6	The price seemed alright and I liked the cache .	St
1.8.7	PSU : PC Power & Cooling Turbo-Cool 1KW-SR EPS12V $ 430 -Thanks for the johnnyGuru link .	St
1.8.8	I went back and picked this one out .	St
1.8.9	Reviews were favorable .	St
1.8.10	Adjusted total : $ 1754 -- - I figure if I need more RAM I can always go back and buy more ; the motherboard has the slots .	St
1.8.11	If the games I play ca n't use it yet , I 'll wait until they can .	St
1.9.1	One more thing ... Might be better with two HDDs than just one .	St
1.9.2	Here 's why ... . drive 0 serves as space for your OS and APPs ( C : ) with a second partition for DATA ( D : ) .	St
1.9.3	Drive 1 is also installed internally and serves as an easy , fast back up ( and restore ) for the main HDD .	St
1.9.4	One big HDD .. if it dies you 're toast and have no backup .	St
1.9.5	With two HDDs you 've got some redundancy and not likely that both drive could fail simultaneously .	St
1.9.6	Virus infected yes ... fail unlikely .	St
1.9.7	VAPCMD	St
1.10.1	When looking for a gaming PC for my son , I relied on the reviews from PC World to select CyperPower PC ( www.cyberpowerpc.com/ ) .	St
1.10.2	They have been HORRIBLE .	St
1.10.3	We purchased two PCs -- one for $ 3,500 , one for over $ 5K .	St
1.10.4	The $ 5K PC arrived and would n't stay on for over 1 minute before overheating .	St
1.10.5	We went back and forth and finally were issued a full refund .	St
1.10.6	The cheaper PC ( $ 3.5K ) has been returned -- the motherboard went out after eight months .	St
1.10.7	Customer service is non-existent .	St
1.10.8	You will be on hold for hours .	St
1.10.9	Trying email is a joke .	St
1.10.10	After about a month of communications trying to honor the warranty on the motherboard , we did receive the PC back with a new motherboard .	St
1.10.11	Today , we discovered that the PC wo n't turn on .	St
1.10.12	Power is getting to the PC , but it wo n't start .	St
1.10.13	We 've been on hold to Technical Support with CyperPower PC for hours .	St
1.10.14	Do NOT purchase a PC from these people .	St
1.10.15	It is a joke .	St
1.10.16	It is a shame that PC World would have rated them so highly .	St
1.11.1	I would recommend going with a Athlon X2 7750+ Kuma more performance/clock good overclocking too since its a BE chip	St
