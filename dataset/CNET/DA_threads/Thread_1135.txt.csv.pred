1.1.14	I wish I would have backed them up on CDs or something , but I thought an external drive would work best ... man was I mistaken .	St
1.1.15	I 've tried everything ... any advice from anyone ? ?	Ques
1.1.16	I will never buy another Toshiba product again .	St
1.1.17	If I can steer one person away from them as well , so be it .	St
1.1.18	What happen to customer service ?	Ques
1.2.1	They should replace the drive .	Sug
1.2.2	That 's what they make and will usually make good on that .	St
1.2.3	You have the data .	St
1.2.4	It is your data , not theres and you must safeguard it with a backup plan .	St
1.2.5	- & gt ; Let 's go over a good backup plan .	St
1.2.6	1 .	St
1.2.7	3 copies .	St
1.2.8	2 .	St
1.2.9	A copy away from the other 2 copies .	St
1.2.10	If you decide not to maintain backups this is your choice .	St
1.2.11	- & gt ; Let 's note a fine company that you can talk to next - & gt ; http : //www.drivesavers.com In closing , read that warranty again .	St
1.2.12	It does not cover any data loss .	St
1.2.13	Bob	St
1.3.1	Sorry about your loss .	St
1.3.2	Never have only ONE copy of anything stored digitally if at all possible .	St
1.3.3	I have so many photos that I could not keep them all on my laptop .	St
1.3.4	Moved them to two different external drives , so there are two copies .	St
1.3.5	One of the drives is portable and I carry to work each day ... just per chance something happens at home .	St
1.3.6	Next step is to burn to DVDs ... over 50 gb of data , so that will be at least 10-12 full DVD-Rs .	St
1.3.7	But after hearing your story and others , I 'm going to spend the time doing just that .	St
1.3.8	Of course , the DVDs have a shelf life too !	St
1.3.9	As to Toshiba 's liability : I 'm afraid that no drive maker eve warranties against loss of data , only the repair/replacement of the hardware .	St
