xp allows you to easily create a home network using a crossover cable between the two, or using a straightthrough cable from a swich to each computer.
this option would give you a much faster transfer speed, you could also share the internet connection this way.
once the connection is made going throught the creat a new home network wizzard is easy.
from there i would create shared folders, or purhaps share the desktop folder.
