Not only didn't I find such but even if it was done the cost would be more than what we were trying to adapt to or a PCI video card. To save posts I'll share I used some Nvidia 8400 and 9400 PCI cards as a last hurray upgrade. I don't see it in stock today but if your power supply is 300 or more Watts try this one -&gt; http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=SP95GT1024D2LHP&cat=VCD Bob
