hi i've got an asus a8n-sli motherboard with the above processor.
i installed all the pieces myself.
however, the chipset fan is occasionally flakey - makes a racket trying to get up to full speed - and my pc seems to like to freeze more often than i would like.
so i would like to return the motherboard... but am afraid of breaking heatsink/cpu/something.
has anyone got instructions for removing the cpu - simply reversing the installation would appear to risk a, too much brute strength and b, nasty separation of the heatsink from the cpu.
thanks darren.
