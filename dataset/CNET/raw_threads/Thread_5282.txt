Desktop runs XP PRO SP2, laptop XP Home SP2, both run Zonealarm, Windows Firewall is disabled in both. Router was updated to the last Firmware. Both are defined as Workgroup MSHOME, with different names. Any help, please? Raul.

Support	I had to call them a few times on issues with the same router and they were most helpful on set up; not so quick on dropped conenction, but they eventually got that resolved. I am currently running about the same thing except 2 desktops and 1 laptop.

Then you can share and see both the computers. By setting the network type to trusted, this will protect your computer from malicious attacks, but allow you to see the computer and share files, printers, etc. Like you, I have a linksys wrt54g and the firewall included in the router does an excellent job so setting your zonealarm setting to trusted does not compromise your data at all. Hopefully this will work T. Ward

I did notice that the ip address Zone Alarm shows is slightly different than what Linksys shows. Linksys shows XXX.XXX.X.1, but ZA shows XXX.XXX.X.0. I cannot edit or delete the settings. I appear to be OK, but should I do more to change the settings?
