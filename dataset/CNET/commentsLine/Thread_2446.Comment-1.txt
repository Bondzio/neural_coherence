hi.
when i first set up a wireless network in my house a few years ago, i bought a linksys wrk54g router.
it's been disconnecting a lot and occasionally the wireless internet connection is unusually slow.
i know that it's a poor quality router and that linksys stopped supporting it in 2004. i was wondering if anyone would recommend a good router that isn't prone to disconnections.
thanks.
