hi everyone!
i'm planning to get a new gpu next week,so i just wanted to take your advice on it.
my system configuration is phenom iix4 945 3.0 ghz ga-880gm-ud2h 4 gigs of ram gpu(integrated) hd4250 windows7 x32 since i live in india,i have a budget in my currency that would be equal to around 250-300$.
i've been doing a lot of research and found that 6870 is a pretty good deal but then again, the hunger of power never stops,so i checked out 6950 and 6970 but they kind of cross my budget.
i also check gtx560 ti and noticed that it is slightly better in performance than 6870 and perhaps on par with the 6950 and 560ti is cheaper than 6950. i'm pretty confused and can't decide the best deal for myself.so,i seek advice.
i use a monitor with a native resolution of 1600x900 and i'd really like it if all the heavy games(crysis,just cause 2) run smoothly at least 40fps.
please feel free to suggest anything you may like.
thanks!
