as the owner of a computer repair shop i am asked many times a week &quot;which is the best brand to buy?&quot;.
my response is always the same.buy your neighbors old computer.
all the computers that come to our shop are made from the same third world junk that would not even be called &quot;seconds&quot; here.
the parts are the same with white sticker on the partss or board with the brand name of the computer being sold.
i'm not aware of any computers made in this country other than shops like ours.
i tell people to look at them as you would a throw-away camera.
my best advice is to keep them unplugged from electric and telephone when not in use.
i doubt i've ever had anyone come in here with a toasted motherboard and power supply that didn't tell me &quot; i had it on a surge protector&quot;.
seems they are boobie trapped to go with first little powewr surge.
