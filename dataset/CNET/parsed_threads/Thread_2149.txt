<s> If this is an old psu, just get a new psu. </s>
<s> Damage may already have been done to the psu beyond what a fan can correct though properly cooled. </s>
<s> If new system, check warranty. </s>
<s> If you replace be aware of your abilites, some fans are a drop-in, just unplag and swap. </s>
<s> Others you &quot;unsolder&quot; and replace/swap. </s>
<s> Further, be sure you get the right fan type, in voltage/vanes(blades) and cfm rating, etc.. </s>
<s> This is the time to get a higher wattage replacement psu as the system can better from it, especially is a decent one(brand name). </s>

<s> It's an old(ish) system and so warranties have run out. </s>
<s> Think it's time for a new one since the old one is 300 watts. </s>
<s> 300 watts wont get very far anymore. </s>
<s> remember, its not just watts, but volts and amps too. </s>
<s> like 12v@25a. </s>
<s> thats what you want to look for. </s>
