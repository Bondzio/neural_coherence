Many thanks!
I don't want to spend more than $700.
This will be a true utility appliance compared to what others are doing with their computers.
The laptop question is a good one.
On one hand I don't want to spend $2000 on a laptop when I could buy the same tools for 500-700.
I have other places I'd like to spend that money since my computer truly will be an appliance.
On the other hand I will be traveling a great deal in the coming months and I can see the eventual superiority of a laptop.
For the moment, however, a desktop will take care of my immediate needs and when/if I see the real need for a laptop, I'll buy one.
