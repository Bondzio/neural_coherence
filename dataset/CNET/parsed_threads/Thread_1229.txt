<s> Hi, I am trying to decide what to purchase on routers. </s>
<s> I am also debating if the router will work for SBC/AT&T. </s>
<s> Can anyone tell me what kind of routers/type routers will work for SBC? </s>
<s> Thanks, I appreciate the help </s>
<s> They all work the same, basically, if you're talking about broadband. </s>
<s> SBC/Yahoo!/AT&T offers DSL. </s>
<s> Pick one that fits your needs, and most if not all routers today will have wireless. </s>
<s> If you just want to do general surfing and email, any good router will suffice. </s>
<s> I personally like and use D-link and have for years. </s>
<s> Linksys is good also. </s>
<s> Just be sure, if possible, that you match vendors with devices. </s>
<s> This means a (for example only) D-link router and D-link NICs. </s>
<s> Or use all Linksys. </s>
<s> I've found that devices from one vendor are usually more compatable with each other. </s>
<s> Wayne There are 10 types of people who understand binary; those that do and those that don't. </s>

<s> Alright! </s>
<s> Thanks a lot Wayne! </s>
<s> Great help. </s>
<s> and when you get it set up you can build a home network and share files and printers. </s>
<s> Makes it nice. </s>
<s> Happy surfing. </s>
<s> Do you know what kind of routers that don't disconnect while you are surfing/playing on games? </s>
<s> Anyone know??? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> if you're set up correctly. </s>
<s> There are specific settings on the router and the ports for gaming, voice, web-cams, etc. </s>
<s> Just get a good router and follow the set-up instructions. </s>
