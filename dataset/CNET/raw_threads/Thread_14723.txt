The ASUS P7H55-M PRO is on sale at Newegg for $85, I'm mostly interested in it's overclocking features (Dell board is locked. While the reviews are pretty good, my main concerns would be the graphics card (Radeon 5750) fitting on the mobo and the lack of cooling in the XPS case (I'm going to replace the case next when have the $). Any help would be appreciated.
