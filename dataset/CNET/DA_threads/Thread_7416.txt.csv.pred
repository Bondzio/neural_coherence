1.1.1	Help!	St
1.1.2	My PC seems sick.	St
1.1.3	I've been building my own for years and never had a problem with them.	St
1.1.4	Last night, I was in the other room and noticed I heard my PC reboot.	St
1.1.5	I didn't think much of it until I heard it again.	St
1.1.6	I then went in and started to look for a problem and it just rebooted in front of my eyes.	St
1.1.7	Just went black and to the main BIOS boot screen.	St
1.1.8	When I got it to boot up, windows wanted to generate a report.	St
1.1.9	I let it and it said it was a graphics card driver problem.	St
1.1.10	After a while, it did the self-reboot again and this time, when it generated a report, it said divice driver problem.	St
1.1.11	I began to think those reports meant nothing.	St
1.1.12	I tried it again after yet another self-reboot and it simply just locked up.	St
1.1.13	Rebooted again, tried to search for problem and it just blanked out again and this time got stuck in the BIOS screen.	St
1.1.14	Now, when I power up, I hear the drives and fans power up but the BIOS wont even come up.	St
1.1.15	So, I look out everything: cards, drives, CPU and put them all back in.	St
1.1.16	Worked for a while.	St
1.1.17	Well, I am having this same issue.	St
1.1.18	It worked for several days until I noticed that my PC was like in low power mode but wouldn't come back up when I moved mouse or pressed a key.	St
1.1.19	I powered it off and back on and it worked.	St
1.1.20	This morning, it wont do anything.	St
1.1.21	The original problem is back..you turn it on and nothing happens..PERIOD.	St
1.1.22	Any other suggestions?	St
1.1.23	I will try to provide as much info as possible about my machine: ASUS P4SDX Pentium 4 1.6 Gig 512 Megs of Memory on one chip GeForce 4 MX 420 AGP Video Card Soundblaster Audigy 2 Generic Network Card Pinnacle AV/DV video card.	St
1.1.24	Two Hard Drives Two CD-ROMS Antec 430 True Power Supply.	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	None...any other suggestions?	St
1.3.2	It is just so hard to narrow it down...power supply?	St
1.3.3	BIOS?	St
1.3.4	Memory?	St
1.4.1	I've got similar issues with my computer as well.	St
1.4.2	It rebooted on me once, but before it did this, it said I had a new hardware installation.	St
1.4.3	I didn't install anything new.	St
1.4.4	I ran spysweeper and norton and found nothing.	St
1.5.1	No power up?	St
1.5.2	Try another AC Cord.	St
1.5.3	And that push button to power up?	St
1.5.4	Short it in a metal pin tip to see if it failed.	St
1.5.5	Or just a few seconds?	St
1.5.6	a.	St
1.5.7	A few machines will do that when the CMOS BATTERY is low.	St
1.5.8	A very annoying feature according to Bob.	Polite
1.5.9	b.	St
1.5.10	Remove what you can.	St
1.5.11	Try again.	St
1.5.12	Still no go?	St
1.5.13	Reduce it to 4 parts.	St
1.5.14	CPU/HSF, PSU, Speaker and motherboard.	St
1.5.15	No go?	St
1.5.16	Remove CPU/HSF.	St
1.5.17	Still no go?	St
1.5.18	You are looking at one of the 2 bad parts.	St
1.5.19	Bob	St
1.6.1	Well, as I stated, it does power up everything but just wont boot.	St
1.6.2	I finally got my internal speaker working.	St
1.6.3	I does one LONG beep..5 second pause..one LONG beep..5 second pause, over and over.	St
1.6.4	This seems to indicate bad memory but alas, without getting a new module, I can't test this.	St
1.6.5	My original memory was from crucial and they claim to have lifetime warranty.	St
1.6.6	I may need to go get at least a 128 module to see if this is the issue or not.	St
1.6.7	Thoughts?	St
1.7.1	The downsizing is how we nail down what part it could be.	St
1.7.2	Such failures are tough enough to find as it is.	St
1.7.3	Not downsizing to least number of parts makes it harder.	St
1.7.4	I offered a copy/paste response to another post and will NOT tailor it to every person who has a boot issue.	St
1.7.5	I can't and won't do that.	St
1.7.6	If you feel this is not good enough then consider it's a free service and I really want to see you succeed.	St
1.7.7	You get to pick through it and see if it helps you out.	St
1.7.8	I'd still remove any item not needed and reseat all cards again.	St
1.7.9	Bob	St
1.8.1	I am sorry...I didn't mention I did a &quot;piece by piece&quot; try and same thing..just getting one long beep every 5 seconds.	St
1.8.2	I am assuming it is memory but don't have any to test the theory.	St
1.8.3	I wish I could get something as small as 128 locally cheap to test it.	St
1.9.1	Well, I tried a new memory module.	St
1.9.2	No luck and not even any beeps.	Polite
1.9.3	So once more, I tried the one by one add in as suggested and nothing.	St
1.9.4	So I am down to this: CPU is bad or MB is bad.	St
1.9.5	Suggestions?	St
1.10.1	Motherboards with a CPU and proper power may not beep if...	St
1.10.2	The CMOS battery is dead.	St
1.10.3	I'm not going to dive into motherboard mounting issues, a loose screw floating aroung the board etc.	St
1.10.4	Bob	St
1.11.1	I reseated the motherboard as well..made sure all was right with it...this is kind of fustrating because it has taken this long to not get anywhere with it..I would purcahse a new MB but don't want to wait that long..no real good deals here locally.	St
1.12.1	You didn't tell if you tested the CMOS BATTERY with a VOLTMETER.	St
1.12.2	It's a nutty thing and I've found good boards replaced for a 2 buck (or less!)	St
1.12.3	battery.	St
1.12.4	Cardboard.	St
1.12.5	When faced with a no-beep system and I know the jumpers and battery are good, I rip the motherboard out of the PC, and just the MB, the CPU, a speaker, the Heatsink/Fan and the PSU are placed on the slab of cardboard.	St
1.12.6	No RAM, no nothing else.	St
1.12.7	I power up by using a metal tip pin or jumper on the PWRON jumper.	St
1.12.8	I want it to beep.	St
1.12.9	If no power, I remove the CPU/HSF.	St
1.12.10	If power up and no beeps, I know I'm looking at the bad parts.	St
1.12.11	Bob	St
