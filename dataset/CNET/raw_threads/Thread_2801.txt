My question was, Should I go with the Quad core one at 2.8 GHz, or the Dual core one at 3.2 GHz? The dual core is cheaper, and I have heard that the higher clock speed is better for games, while more cores are better for things like Photoshop that are written to be CPU dependent. I'm sure both will work, but is it worth saving the $30 and losing two cores?

And then the i5 has the turbo boost to let a core clock up dynamically. My bet is the i5 will consistently beat the older Core 2 Quad core CPUs. Bob

I know Intel tends to be more on the cutting edge, but I'm trying to stay under $1000, and I need to focus on the gpu more than the cpu, because the rig I want to build will be for games primarily.
