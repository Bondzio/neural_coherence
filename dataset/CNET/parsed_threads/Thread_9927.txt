<s> I've got the notice from Windows 7 that the hard drive I'm on is failing. </s>
<s> I'm considering getting a program that will copy the image over to a new hard drive. </s>
<s> Two questions: 1. </s>
<s> Will copying the exact image / sectors / etc whatever - will that also copy the problems onto my new hard drive, or will the problems that I have on the existing hard drive create issues with the image copy to the new hard drive? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The new hard drive is significantly larger than the old one, will this be a problem in any way - I assume the partition isn't copied over in the transfer, but haven't done this in several years so just want to make sure. </s>
<s> One is CLONEZILLA and later if I need to resize partitions GPARTED. </s>
<s> I'll stop here about their use since there is plenty of web pages about these FREE apps. </s>
<s> The copy will not copy bad sectors to the new drive. </s>
<s> The data will move if possible but you won't create bad sectors by copy a drive. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> If the HD is &quot;physically&quot; failing then getting any copy transfer will be to the degree the damage is done. </s>
<s> If you're trying to get away from some s/w issue then it *may* copy provided all s/w is cloned(image) over. </s>
<s> You will soon know afterwards if the same issues crop-up due to corrupted or malware problems. </s>
<s> Since, you gave no idea what the true damage is from, but a bad HD. </s>
<s> If you simply install new HD and using the OEM restore/recovery discs, you prepare the system for re-use. </s>
<s> Then you can access the old HD and copy critical data over that way. </s>
<s> Though you will need to install the pgms. </s>
<s> prior before moving data over. </s>
<s> Does your HD provide any s/w for data transfer? </s>
<s> If not, check thier support website, it may provide it that way. </s>
