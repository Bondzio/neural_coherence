I'm not buying any MBs without IDE ports, floppy controllers and some of the other legacy stuff.
There are just too many other good choices not to have to accept such limitations and overcome the potential problems in the future.
Yeah .. there's always a way around ... but I prefer use and have access to stuff I know works easily with anything.
SATA is great but many many folks would swear otherwise...especially those with optical drives.
Maybe they work better in preconfigured systems from the big box mfgs but they seem to present problems for the 'Do-It-Yourselfers'.
