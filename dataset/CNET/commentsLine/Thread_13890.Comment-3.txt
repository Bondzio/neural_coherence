as bob proffitt said, trying units on another system is one check to do.
i'd get my hands on a ps-2 mouse to make further checks, specifically device manager to see what is going on with usb function, errors update(s) etc.
since it is possible that it could me a device (hardware) failure.
if that should be the case get a pci slot usb card and stuff that in the system, that might just remedy the situation.
