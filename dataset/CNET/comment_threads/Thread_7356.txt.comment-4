Since the machine with the issue is a fresh install of Windows 7, it's drivers may be what Microsoft supplied.
Which most folk are learning (again) that we must find our drivers just like we have for over a decade.
Sorry but your link to MediaFire is not one I can use.
That site is too full of bad things for me to consider trying.
-&gt; Bottomline?
Find the laptop maker's page for drivers for this laptop and install the drivers they tell you for Windows 7.
