As to installing the drive, it's no different than any other drive and you follow the makers install instructions.
If you don't then you have your reasons why.
As to RAID, that is again where you get a RAID controller and follow the instructions.
Worth noting is that with just a 200GB and one 80GB drive, you don't have enough drives to make a RAID setup.
