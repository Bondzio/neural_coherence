1.1.1	I have a system that was gutted by a friend, and I am wanting to turn it into a 'new' desktop system for home.	St
1.1.2	It was originally a server that they used, with dual processors (2 - AMD 2GHz).	St
1.1.3	Like I said, they gutted it, and left only the motherboard, processors, case, fans.	St
1.1.4	I tried flipping it on, to see if it was even worth messing with, and after only 1-2 seconds, the fans shut down, and a led came on in the middle of the mobo, signalling that it was overheating.	St
1.1.5	I pulled the heat sinks off(dual processors, remember), put new thermal grease between them and the processors, and tried to start it up again...no difference.	St
1.1.6	It still shut down after 1-2 secs, and the overheating light came on.	St
1.1.7	I was going to buy ram/hdd/etc, but if it won't make it more than 2 secs, I figured it would need some more help.	St
1.1.8	Any suggestions, or should this be 'retired'?	St
1.1.9	System specs: (not much right now!)	St
1.1.10	dual AMD socket A processors, 2 ghz (AMSN2400DKT3C) mobo: Gigabyte GA-7DPXDW-P 450W power supply, 4, 80 mm fans in case	St
1.2.1	your HSF's can't possibly be adequately coupled for heat transfer to the CPU's.	St
1.2.2	You may have too much thermal grease on them, however, I suspect that the clamping system is fouled up.	St
1.2.3	Clamping the HSF's tight enough can be a very scary process.	St
1.2.4	Of course they may be totally inadequate HSF's.	St
1.2.5	I assume while experimenting, the case is off thus the general issue of cooling the total interior of the case is not a problem.	St
1.2.6	Are the fans running at top speed?	St
1.2.7	If plugged into the mobo with three pin connectors they are temperature controlled, maybe the controllers are bad.	St
1.2.8	Get adapters to run the fans at full 12 volts by connecting to the big molex connectore.	St
1.3.1	They gave you the system with the cpus already present suggests they didn't have much luck with it either.	St
1.3.2	I suppose the cpus themseleves are already buggered and may well be toast or at least one of them.	St
1.3.3	Overall, if possible does that mtrbd.	St
1.3.4	work with one cpu installed alone?	St
1.3.5	If so, test that way.	St
1.3.6	otherwise, verify correct amount of cpu grease and further that is clean before install if older thermal paste was used.	St
1.3.7	Thena pply new grease, otherwise AMDs aren't very overtemp tolerant.	St
1.3.8	Remove cpus just to check the socket-A's placement, is glased or browned it shows alot of temp was active, not a good sign.	St
1.3.9	This excludes any other possiible cause mtrbd.	St
1.3.10	or elsewhere.	St
1.3.11	Play with it is basically the best t/s I can give, but if the cpus are socket-A type are they transferable to another single socket-A mtrbd.	St
1.3.12	if so, then try that.	St
1.3.13	The cpu p/n# is present on the top surface or the die or bottom.	St
1.3.14	tada -----Willy	St
