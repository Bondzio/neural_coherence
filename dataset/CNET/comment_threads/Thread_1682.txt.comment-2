and I have the following laptops connected to it Dell Inspiron Hp Compaq Preserio and I do NOT have any problems with any of them connecting.
You could connect using an ethernet cable or buy a wireless card and connect using the Netgear router.
You failed to tell us which type of internet you are using so this is the best information I can give.
