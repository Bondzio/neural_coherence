1.6.1	... It has an AC97 Integrated Audio , accessed through the Control Panel .	St
1.6.2	Depending on what speaker configuration you select ( 2 speakers , 3 speaker or 6 ) , the mic is only available on the 2 & 3 speaker configuration .	St
1.6.3	Also , there is no coaxial or optical connections .	St
1.7.1	After due consideration , I have decided to build a 64 bit system using the MSI K8N Neo4 mainboard , and MSI GeForce 6600GT .	St
1.7.2	By recycling old parts , I should keep the overall cost below $ 450 .	St
1.8.1	yes..if i had the time/expertise to build.. i would have gone ur way as well.. make sure..u go with a good power supply that 6600GT needs lot of power ( what i read in forums )	St
