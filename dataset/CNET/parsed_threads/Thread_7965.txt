<s> I am seriously thinking of getting this Gateway. </s>
<s> It seems to have a lot more for the money than other manufacturers. </s>
<s> However, Gateway has had so many ups and downs, I am hesitant. </s>
<s> Any thoughts? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> You should google for any negative comments to include the Gateway support forums if anything is amiss. </s>
<s> If you read these forums and others, just about any PC makers will have problems. </s>
<s> PCs are so pushed out the door, anything can happen. </s>
<s> If your comfort level suggests everything is OK in that model#, get one. </s>
<s> IMO, Gateway is just another builder and overall isn't that bad. </s>
<s> I would put it above HP and Compaq for instance but less than Dell. </s>
<s> yet, you'll hear alot of bad press on Dell, yet the numbers suggest they too provide for the most part a decent system. </s>
<s> Sorry, that's about as much bravo I can say about any PC out there. </s>
<s> You should review the return policy and/or warranty to see what you're getting into. </s>

<s> The most comprehensive comparison of brand reliability I have seen is done by PC Magazine. </s>
<s> Here are links to the article and the chart on the ratings: http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2368154,00.asp http://www.pcmag.com/image_popup/0,1871,iid=267317,00.asp You have not stated how you will use the computer or what price range. </s>
<s> If you are looking for a low end model, then one of the large manufacturers options will provide the most bang for the buck. </s>
<s> However, you also generally get low grade components, a small PSU which limits upgrades, oftern not being able to add a decent graphics card, and bloatware. </s>
<s> If you want an intermediate level to above machine and/or want to avoid the above limitations, then I strongly recommend a custom build from CyberPower. </s>
<s> Note that they evaluated on the reliability list linked above and rank higher than all other prebuilt systems except Apple. </s>
<s> If interested in this option, you go to there site and select the components. </s>
<s> This will take a little more work since you have to pick the components, but that can be a fun process too. </s>
<s> For help, take a look at this link I just posted to earlier: http://forums.cnet.com/7723-7586_102-517823.html?tag=threadListing;forum-threads If you want to add or upgrate the graphics card for any of these systems, you can find helpful guidance and other resources at this site: http://www.upgradevideocards.com/index.html </s>
