i've been running an external for 2-years and two internals for 12-years.
in fact, i am about to retire my 12-year old computer, pull the drives and make them external drives for my new machine.
my son did this already with his machines.
he pulled the drives, put them in enclosures, bought a usb hub and now command them with his lap top.
i rather have a drive rack instead of a bunch of wires running everywhere.
like ben stated, alway turn off your machine when you are done.
letting your machine run in idle waste energy and cost you money.
last thing; you can read an old windows drive with an apple machine but you can not write to it without drive maintenance first....
