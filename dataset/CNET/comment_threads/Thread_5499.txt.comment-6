So how long will it be for these chips to fall in price?
Id figure the drop would be substantial, is there a new chip coming out at the end of the month?
So I assume you are saying that this trip would run better than the 4200 or 4000 X2.
If I do get it, is there a motherboard I should look for that would work well with it?
Also, any reccomendations on memory?
I wanted to get 2GB.
Thanks, ~J
