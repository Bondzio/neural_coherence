1.1.1	Hi All, I own 3 80GB drives (Model - ST380011A) purchased at different times, Due to some problems in the SMPS one of the drive had burnt one of the IC on the circuitry and now I can not access the drive completely.	St
1.1.2	My office IT ppl suggested to remove the burnt circuit and put the circuit of a working drive and try booting the drive again..	St
1.1.3	I tried but the drive did not detect.	St
1.1.4	However I could find that the platter is rotating freely (from the sound).	St
1.1.5	So i guess the Head and internals of the drive are fine.	St
1.1.6	Can anyone help me with that.	Ques
1.1.7	Let me know if you require more details.	St
1.1.8	looking out passionately for a response.	St
1.1.9	Thank you in advance, Kritz.	St
1.2.1	One suggestion is to look carefully at the old and replancement (new) on-board controllers and make sure the &quot;new one&quot; is configured exactly the same way as the original.	Sug
1.2.2	Look for jumpers, dip switches, etc.	St
1.2.3	and set them the same way as they were on the old one.	St
1.2.4	You might also verify that the drive that had the replacement controller was visible to the OS before swapping the cards.	St
1.2.5	Good luck, -Ron	St
1.3.1	I have no idea what you mean....the word &quot;burnt&quot; does not exist.	St
1.3.2	Do you mean &quot;burned&quot;?	St
1.4.1	If swapping boards fails you move to the usual names in the business such as Ontrack and Drive Savers.	St
1.4.2	Bob	St
1.5.1	The word &quot;burnt&quot; cerainly does exist.	St
1.5.2	It is in fact an older and somewhat more cultivated word for &quot;burned.&quot;	St
1.6.1	Hello Kritz, As your Hard drive is not being detected, you need to contact some data recovery service provider, such that they can recover your data back.	St
1.6.2	As you said that your hard drive head is alright, I think the changing of IC board will do the job and you will recover 100% of your data.	St
1.6.3	You can contact Stellar Information for the data recovery service.	St
1.6.4	http://www.stellarinfo.com/data-recovery-services.htm Stellar provides hard disk data recovery services worldwide through its well equipped Data Recovery labs (Class 100 Clean Room) and experienced professionals.	St
1.7.1	The recovery techniques with failed electronics to switch boards and chips are known to work.	St
1.7.2	If not, there may be a higher level of failure requiring lab facilties and trained technicians.	St
1.7.3	I work for ActionFront Data Recovery Labs and have seen first hand hard drives with failed electronics and destroyed read/write heads.	St
1.7.4	Some times there is physical media damage possibly created from the end-users attempting to power up the drive.	St
1.7.5	Extensive platter damage usually means all opportunities for recovery are lost.	St
1.7.6	If you would like to discuss this, takin' is free at 1 800-563-1167.	St
1.7.7	Best of luck!	St
1.8.1	Some time back I had an major hard drive crash and at that time i contacted Stellar ( http://www.stellarinfo.com ) .. As my hard drive was making sound, they suggested me take the hard drive to their data recovery clean room.	St
1.8.2	And my Good Luck!	St
1.8.3	They were successful in recovering my data.. then I went through the successful data recovery stories & testimonials of stellar I came to knew that these people have recovered the data from burnt hard drive also...	St
1.8.4	They are really god for lost data... www.stellarinfo.com	St
1.9.1	Hi,maybe you have some explanation!!!	St
1.9.2	I had two hard disks,system and data.Few weeks ago I saw a message &quot;secondary hard disk error,press F1 to resume&quot;,which I did and everytime when I turn on pc it was ok. System red from secondary /data/ hard disk.	St
1.9.3	I checked it few times with system tools/xp/,everything was ok. And... Once,when I chehcked,jumper and cables /on secondary hd/,after that,when I turned on pc again,I saw same message but I didn't see hd!	St
1.9.4	Sometime bios see hd /when I put it to find it manually/ but system doesn't.	St
1.9.5	There weren't any strange sounds or &quot;clicks&quot; or bad sectors and hd is spinning as I can notice.	St
1.9.6	Cables and contacts are ok.	St
1.9.7	I gave it to some good boy to change electronic board ,he did but it without any results?!	St
1.9.8	That's the story!	St
1.9.9	Regards Zoran	St
1.10.1	You could try freezing the drive.	Sug
1.10.2	I don't know about a burnt out circuit, but drives with heat problems can be used by sticking them in the freezer for a day or two and work for about 20 minutes or so before crashing again.	St
1.10.3	(this usually one works 2 or 3 times in a row then *dead*.)	St
1.10.4	Chances are you will need to take it to a repair shop and have them get the data off of it.	St
