hello, i have been having some trouble with my laptop.
i have a hp pavillion dv8000 with windows xp.
none of my usb ports seem to work, when i plug something in the error message titled &quot;usb device not recognized&quot; pops up and the device does not operate.
i have researched this as much as possible for about 2 hours now and i have tried these methods.
- unpluging power cord and battery - deleting the items for usb under device manager - checking for updates in windows update - scanning for hardware changes in device manager i would really appreciate some help.
i have service pack 3.
