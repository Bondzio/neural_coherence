hi folks, i have a problem with my lan.
it worked fine until i moved a computer to another room and tried to resume the net.
nothing works.
one computer recognizes one other but the other two won't recognize either.
someone suggested i disable the firewall, which i did, but no help.
he also suggested i ping, but i don't know how to do this.
i have run thru the set-up procedure many times and tried all the different ways.
i'm using a netgear model #fs605 if any more info is needed please let me know and i'll try to furnish it.
thanks
