1.1.1	Hello all , looking to upgrade my computer to psudo-gaming quality ( enough to run WoW ) and I want to know if I max out my memory to 2 GB ( 1 gb per slot ) and install a 80 gb hard drive ( which is the maximum I can find since it does not have the 48 lba thingy that lets it exceed 137 gb ) will I need to upgrade anything else such as my CPU with is currently a intel celeron ?	Ques
1.1.2	Here 's the specs page for my computer if that helps & gt ; & gt ; & gt ; http : //h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/genericDocument ? docname=c00255589 & cc=us & dlc=en & lc=en & jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN thanks , -quagmier	St
1.2.1	WoW will benefit most from a decent video card .	St
1.2.2	since you have no agp slot , a geforce 6200 is your best alternative .	St
1.2.3	geforce 6200 , 256mb , $ 56 : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814130289	Ques
1.3.1	Max RAM is 1GB Video : No AGP or PCIe slot for video ... only PCI slot HDD : Could bump the HDD to 120GB Larger capacity HDD with upgrade BIOS or PCI HDD Controller w/BIOS RE CPU : Socket 478 for Intel P4 Williamette and Northwood processors , 1.4GHZ to 2.8GHz or higher .	St
1.4.1	RE MAX 1 GB RAM : You have 256MB RAM ... . You can have 1GB RAM ( 2 DIMMs at 512MBs ea PER MANUAL ) Looks like you 'll have to pull the existing 256MB DIMM and install 2-512MB DIMMs .	St
