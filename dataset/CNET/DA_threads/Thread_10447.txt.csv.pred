1.1.1	Hi I have posted this message in the Mac Hardware fom as well, I was unsure which one would give me the fastest feedback.Do Macs only connect wirelessly to an Airport connection or base?	St
1.1.2	Or can Macs also wirelessly connect to any .11b/g signal?	St
1.1.3	Even if this signal was being broadcasted from lets say a Cisco or Linksys wifi access point?	St
1.1.4	Thanks to everyone in advance!	St
1.2.1	You can use your mac through most wired and wirless routers/access points.	St
1.2.2	They do not have to be apple branded, and most routers are b/g backwards compatible, meaning the new wireless N standard routers support wireless b and g.	St
