If you see a lot of local hard disk access, then more RAM may help.
Then again, it's quite rare to see Windows machines with up to date BIOS and drivers.
The crash is abnormal and a clue that something is wrong.
Our old machines never crashed on boot like that.
We had to push them very hard.
I would not upgrade a crashing machine.
Adding ram will not stop the crash.
