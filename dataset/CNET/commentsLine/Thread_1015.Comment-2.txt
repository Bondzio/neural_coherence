this sounds like an os or driver issue.
in fact, that's a very new machine and you should be able to pester the supplier/support to fix it for you.
all the fujitsi based systems do have a reset but may not wire it up.
later you can research this and inspect the motherboard to find the reset and add that button.
notes a reply for you.
