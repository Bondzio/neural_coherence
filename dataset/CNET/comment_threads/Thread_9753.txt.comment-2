http://www.sonix.com.tw/sonix/product.do?p=SN9C103 I had some trouble tracking this down.
It is not a Vista driver.
I hope this is the brand name/Manufacturer for this Web Cam.
Of the few sites that did list some form of driver for it, none said they had a driver for Vista.
Seek out the manufacturer of this product and see if the driver is available from there web site.
I had the same problem with a web cam and the simplest solution was to get a new one.
Also, I have McAfee site advisor on my computer and I don't believe I've ever seen so few sites reviewed or so many yellow warnings then I had on this search.
Where did you get that thing?
There certainly in a bad neighborhood.
