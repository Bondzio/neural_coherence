They run large tax programs, finance programs (Quickbooks Pro), internet explorer (research), email, messaging, and tax research software all at once. We Norton ghost backup everything every two hours to net storage, so that, along with printing (lots), is often going on in the background. A second nic card saves us time here, but these folks occasionally push 32 bit XP beyond its memory capacity. We get hangs that are clearly memory related. Obviously, productivity is a concern when all this stuff is running concurrently. Given these non-gaming, non-multimedia tasks, what is the best processor for these professionals. It would seem that Intel's i5 and i7 and quads are overkill in all the wrong areas. Should we stick with

Just hoping someone will steer me to the fastest computer I can buy for the the things my accountants do on a daily basis.

Core i7 is a quad-core processor with hyper-threading (each core capable of handling two threads) means that Core i7s look like 8-core processors in Windows and are idea for multitasking. If budget is not a concern then I would suggest a Core i7-860. Core i5 is not a bad choice either and will probably be more readily available in SMB systems. Good luck!

I read that most of the day to day business software out there does not take advantage of the quad core architecture. That was the basis for my question about getting a fast duo instead.

So e.g. 2.85 GHz quad-core can actually ratchet up to over 3 GHz when there is processor &quot;headroom&quot;. BUT as I mentioned at the start of the thread not all SW is multi-threaded today but think about what your PC needs will be in 3-5 years from now. Whether Core i7 or Core i5 you will be making a good choice. TimWoodChip Disclosure: TimWoodChip is an Intel employee and aspirational sponsor of tomorrow.

The irony is, that in three years, when I am replacing this computer, Intel will be offering an i14 and it will be too advanced for the software current then. By the way, just how much wood could a woodchip chip if a woodchip...

Accounting software aka Caseware, Taxprep, jazz-it are not made for multi-core processors. So don't kill your self about quad i5 i7 etc. Get a high frequency dual core with windows 7 and max out the memory i would say 1 to 2 GB per open program. Freezing is also caused by cheap video cards. Get a dedicated video card with 512 mb it will refresh faster. Note dont go cheap get the real ATI card not a cheap copy. Why are you not making a dual image of your hard drive in case one fails.

If you actually want performance increase, you'd go to a RISC type of processor and a system that can utilize such. I run 3d graphics rendering, multiple traceroutes, nmap, qemu, LAME, xine, firefox, multiple builds, konqueror. In the VM I will run firefox, make, traceroute, etc. I'm using a Sempron 3400+. I can also run instant messaging on both. The difference is that I am using FreeBSD or Debian to do all of this.
