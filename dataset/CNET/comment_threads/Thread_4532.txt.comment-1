Interesting name, but I think I kind of like it.
Check out the links for more info: http://www.9to5mac.com/macbook-air-2453564654 http://www.macrumors.com/2008/01/06/thin-macbook-specs/ http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en-us&q=MacBook+Air&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8 From the pictures from those banners, it looks like it would need a docking station like that recent patent suggested.
I mean, it has no ports on the side that is photographed, so how would it connect to devices and charge by itself?
Perhaps the dock is meant for all of that and there's no ports on it at all.
That would be a stunning move by Apple.
Bundle it with a Blu-Ray/HD-DVD combo drive!
