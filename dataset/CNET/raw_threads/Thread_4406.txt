Hey all- I was wondering what i need for these situations: - My Laptop on the Go - what tech do i need to have a reliable internet connection most of the time ($100-250 dollar range). -Could I replace my cable with a router or something? I have 2 desktop and 3 laptops. But I heard routers are unreliable; would making the switch be the right and cheap choice?

But, there are enough differences in the text to make it unclear as to your goal. You mention being &quot;on the go&quot; but having laptops and desktops. As well, you ask about replacing your cable with a router. These are not interchangeable items. Each does something completely different. You might ask that your posts be removed and put together a new one that defines more specifically what you want to do and what problems you are having.

When I say &quot;laptop on the go&quot; I mean that I want to know what I can do to have wireless internet access on my high school campus. Is placing a router in my locker feasible? That sorta thing. By &quot;replacing&quot; a cable modem with a wireless router, I meant that could I use a wireless router or some similar device to power reliable internet access in my home for both laptops and desktops instead of using a cable modem which i pay expensive monthly fees for. That's pretty much it. Simple too.

It's a piece of hardware that needs to be connected to another piece...generally a broadband modem. The modem connects to an internet service provider...generally by phone line or coax cable depending on whether it's cable or DSL. Of course fiber optic is growing as well. You can't put any piece of hardware in your school that will originate an internet connection. Does your school not have a network with internet access already? It's the same deal at your home. You cannot toss out the cable modem and use a router. In fact, you will want both. The router cannot reach out and grab an internet connection. It needs to connect to a modem. &quot;Modem&quot; means &quot; MO ulator- DEM odulator. It converts the incoming and outgoing signals to the ISP from and to a modulated signal that can carry the long distances that a purely digital signal cannot. This means it's on a high frequency &quot;carrier&quot;...going for a ride. The carrier is added at one end and removed at the other. Your router cannot handle the signal that enters your house. I hope this is clear.
