The problem is that when I try start up with minimum configuration: cpu, motherboard and power and case of course.
The power fan and cpu fan just run 1 second then down 2 second and then run again and down again.
I think the normal situation should be the fans keep running and the motherboard alert no memory found.
there are 4 phase leds on board, two green down one yellow up and one yellow top.
I have replace the power and cpu, it doesn't work.
Now I am gonna change the motherboard.
But before that, I post to see if there are some good solutions.
And I wonder if there is a chance that it the case problem.
cpu : i5-760 motherboard : gigabyte p55-usb3 power : corsair TX 650w power supply
