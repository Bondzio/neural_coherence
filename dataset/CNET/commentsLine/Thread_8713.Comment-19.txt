you can blow the dust out of the cooling fins with a can of compressed air, and then pick up what ever dust you can (your computer should be shut off) if you remove 85% or 90% of the dust, you have eliminated 85% or 90% of your danger.
there are lots of little tricks like a small battery operated computer vacume which might even pick up some of the dust but one of my favorites is a turkey baster which you can use to blow or to suck up dust.
i have seen people blow with their breath which contains a great deal of moisture and other contaminants; that is not a good thing.
just be careful and be gentle and don't be too fussy.
get out any heavy accumulation of dust.
