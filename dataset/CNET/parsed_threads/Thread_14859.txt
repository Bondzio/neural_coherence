<s> I need a new power supply for my hp xt973 desktop pc. </s>
<s> The one that is in it now is a Bestec ATX-1523D. </s>
<s> I really know nothing about the inside of my computer so I am wondering if I need to get the exact same kind of power supply or can they be upgraded? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> http://www.affordablesurplus.com/hp-power-supply.asp shows it's a common 230Watt ATX power supply. </s>
<s> The only noteable items are the dimensions and the fan placements (look at that one under the PSU rather than the ends.) </s>
<s> Dimensionally it looks like a stock ATX supply and you'll look at your case to see if you have space to accomodate any number of supplies from http://www.compgeeks.com/products.asp?cat=CAS#Power%20Supplies You can fit a much higher wattage PSU such as the 450 Watt units without any negative side effects since the computer parts only draw what is needed. </s>
<s> This can be cheap to fix. </s>
