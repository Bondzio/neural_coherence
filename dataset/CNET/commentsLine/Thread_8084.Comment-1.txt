hi there everyone, this is my first post, so bear with me if i mess up (i'm sure many of you have heard that plenty of times before lol...) anyways, i'm planning on building a new computer, and i want to get a nvidia geforce 9800 gtx graphics card.
i know it's a two slot card, and i know that i only need 1 pci-express 2.0 slot to use it, but i don't know whether or not there needs to be a second pci slot next to it for it to rest on.
if it does, will the motherboard i'm getting work?
i want to get an asus p5ql-em intel g43 socket 775 motherboard (from tigerdirect.com).
if you need any more info, just ask.
thank you!
