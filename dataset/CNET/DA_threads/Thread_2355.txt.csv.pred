1.1.1	I just read the review of USB 3.0 drives and want to buy a new drive for backups on my system .	St
1.1.2	My Window 7 PC is about a year old but I do not know if it has USB 1,2 , or 3 .	St
1.1.3	Is there a way in My Computer or the Device Manager to tell what version of USB I have ?	Ques
1.1.4	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	In Device Manager expand USB 's .	St
1.2.2	Look after the Family part for USB or USB2 , etc .	St
1.3.1	Under & quot ; Universal Serial Bus controllers & quot ; it lists 17 items , & quot ; Standard Enhanced PCI to USB Host Controller & quot ; ( twice ) , & quot ; Standard OpenHCD USB Host Controller & quot ; ( four times ) , & quot ; USB Root Hub & quot ; ( 8 times ) , etc .	St
1.3.2	Each item refers only to & quot ; USB & quot ; , not USB2 or USB3 .	St
1.3.3	Does this mean I have only USB1 and not USB 2 or 3 ?	Ques
1.3.4	Thanks .	Polite
1.4.1	http : //www.sevenforums.com/hardware-devices/133519-usb-controller-openhcd-not-enhanced.html & quot ; & quot ; Whenever a system has USB 2.0 ports , you 'll find the & quot ; Enhanced & quot ; USB controller in Device Manager , but you will also find two other USB controllers .	St
1.4.2	These two to mantain backward compatibility to USB 1.1 devices. & quot ; ( USB 2.0 , Hi-Speed USB FAQ ) & quot ;	St
1.5.1	The important part is look for & quot ; enhanced & quot ; .	St
1.5.2	Have a look here at MSDN .	St

1.7.1	while I was typing .	St
1.8.1	If my Device Manager lists & quot ; Standard Enhanced PCI to USB Host Controller & quot ; twice , does that mean I have 2 USB 2.0 ports ?	Ques
1.8.2	Does & quot ; Standard OpenHCD USB Host Controller & quot ; mean USB 1.0 ?	Ques
1.8.3	What would it say if I had USB 3.0 ?	Ques
1.8.4	I have 6 total USB ports , 4 in the back and 2 in the front .	St
1.8.5	Is there anyway to tell which are the USB 2.0 ports ?	Ques
1.8.6	Thanks very much .	Polite
1.9.1	If your PC is 1yr .	St
1.9.2	old it will have USB2.0 that usually allows USB1.1 compatibility .	St
1.9.3	The issue of USB3.0 is going to be stated as that 's a selling point for any new PC .	St
1.9.4	However , you did n't state what your PC maker was or model # .	St
1.9.5	Most OEM makers provide the specs of what they contain , so review them or check manual .	St
1.9.6	USB3.0 is more readily ID'ed by the & quot ; blue color & quot ; of ports or a different color scheme , though that may not apply to every brand out there .	St

1.10.1	My PC does not have a brand .	St
1.10.2	Our network & quot ; guy & quot ; built it and a couple of others for us last year .	St
1.10.3	He moved and I ca n't get in touch with him anymore .	St
1.10.4	There is no manual .	St
1.10.5	I 'm sure he used parts which were easy to find and cheap , but it is fast works great .	St
1.10.6	The ports , both front and back , are white , not blue , so I assume they are not USB 3.0 .	St
1.10.7	Thanks for your help .	Polite
1.11.1	Then you need to refer to what information can be gotten using some s/w analyzer , like PCWizard 2012 .	St
1.11.2	Irt will report what you really have and then use that to google for your needs .	St
1.11.3	The report should state what mtrbd .	St
1.11.4	you have , like Brand XYZ-123-a , google away for the manual and thus review what your specs are .	St
1.11.5	The information is more than anything else , real hard facts about your build .	St
