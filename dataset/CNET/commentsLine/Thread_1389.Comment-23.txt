if you're really happy with what you have now, then just get another internal hardrive.
check up with your motherboard (mobo) on what's supported.
-find out the largest capacity supported.
if it's not as much, you could still get a larger one than that and just partition it to utilize the full space.
&gt;winxp will require sp1 or greater to read hds greater than 137gb in capacity even if your mobo supports it.
&gt;bios updates may be necessary as well.
-7200 rpm -2mb buffer cache was standard on older hds.
8mb is mainstream now, with 16mb already out.... mostly on newer/larger hds.
2mb isn't &quot;death&quot; perse, but 8mb would help cut back on some bottlenecking that occurs in hds.
-maxtor, seagate, western digital are among some of the good brands out there in hds -how an internal hd connects to your pc.
for yours, likely the older ide interface (with the wide 'ribbon' cables).
sata is a thin cable that's on newer pcs a usb 2.0 card (try to have at least 4 ports.
like with hardrive space, you don't need a super amt of it, but some more than you need is always handy to have) for fast transfers if you decide to also utilize external hds.
perhaps more system ram.
if you feel winxp has been running slower or sluggish, then shoot for more ram.
512mb will up the performance dramatically for more resource intensive tasks and/or more simultaneous tasks w/o puttng a huge hit on your budget
