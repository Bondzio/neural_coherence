my dell 8300 is a year and a half old but now does not turn on.
both the power supply and mother board check out ok. now the problem seems to be between the on/off button to the mother board.
is there a way to check for this or get around it?
where would i be able to fine a replacement if needed?
i have check ebay (can replace the whole case) but nothing.
dell customer service takes to long and will charge a fee just to tell me that i should send it in.
any help will do thanks.
