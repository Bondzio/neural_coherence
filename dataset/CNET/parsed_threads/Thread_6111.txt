<s> hello, I have a Dell Inspiron 6000, its about 5 years old. </s>
<s> It has an integrated Wireless Adapter Intel Pro/Wireless 2915ABG . </s>
<s> I have noticed that its been acting up sometimes, finds signlas, drops them, the status bar going up and down all the time. </s>
<s> Im not sure if this is a software issue r hardware. </s>
<s> what I want to know is if an NCI or Cardbus wireless adaptor is better than the integrated one, range and stabitily wise. </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> Stability = SAME when both are working proper. </s>
<s> Distance = SAME OLD STORY of &quot;it depends on the situation.&quot; But the reason I fit those cards is that while sometimes replacing the internal card fixes it, it usually fails again so I never bother anymore. </s>
<s> This is not a design bug. </s>
<s> Laptops have a life span and it's from 3 to 5 years so again, not a bug or omission in the design. </s>
<s> You have the right idea to fix this common issue. </s>
<s> It's how I deal with it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
