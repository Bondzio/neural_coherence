1.1.1	PC with printer attached is Windows XP Home SP2.	St
1.1.2	Running McAfee.	St
1.1.3	Printers have &quot;enable sharing&quot; turned on (the little hand icon appears).	St
1.1.4	Laptop is Vista Home Premium.	St
1.1.5	Running Norton.	St
1.1.6	When I tell the laptop to search for printers on the wireless network, it never finds them.	St
1.1.7	I should note that my previous laptop (Windows XP) never had an issue connecting to the same PC's same printers that I am trying to connect to now.	St
1.1.8	Very strange.	St
1.1.9	Is this a Vista -&gt; XP issue?	St
1.1.10	I have poked around in the McAfee setting and I don't see anything obviuos blocking the printer sharing.	St
1.1.11	Also, as I mentioned, it worked fine with my old laptop, and I haven't touched the McAfee settings.	St
1.1.12	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	There's a special thing to be installed for it to cooperate in a mixed Vista XP setup.	St
1.2.2	See the forum sticky.	St
1.3.1	Interesting.	St
1.3.2	I don't know about this Vista thing.	St
1.3.3	I'll try and find it in the sticky and give it a whirl.	St
1.4.1	can be found here.	St
1.4.2	http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7589_102-0.html?forumID=62&threadID=264135&messageID=2584349 Are you trying to use a wireless print adapter or just printer sharing.	St
1.4.3	Notes can all be found there.	St

1.5.1	OK, I installed that patch on the XP machine via the link to Microsoft in the sticky.	St
1.5.2	Restarted the pc and checked on the laptop...still doesn't find the shared printers plugged into the PC.	St
1.5.3	The PC DOES show up on the Vista network map.	St
1.5.4	However, when I click the PC's icon, it just opens up Media Player and accesses the media I have on that computer (which I was able to do before that patch as well).	St
1.5.5	Help!	St
1.6.1	It's firewall is likely blocking it.	St
1.6.2	And it will do little good to disable it since in some versions even disabled it still blocks the share.	Ques
1.6.3	-&gt; Go try NETWORK MAGIC too.	St
1.7.1	Norton is on the laptop that I'm trying to search with.	St
1.7.2	I have &quot;share printers and folders&quot; enabled.	St
1.7.3	Anyone know a step by step I can follow to be able to print from my laptop?	St
1.8.1	In case it helps, I want to reinforce that even after I installed the &quot;vista thing&quot; on the xp machine, my laptop shows the pc as &quot;Media Devices&quot;...not like a real computer I can click into and brose te shared folders and printers, like I used to be able to do with my old xp laptop.	St
1.8.2	If I click the PC's icon, it just opens WMP because it thinks it's a Media Device!	St
1.9.1	While we can cover accounts, permissions, firewalls and more PLEASE go try Network Magic.	St
1.9.2	The demo is free and often corrects what was overlooked.	St
1.9.3	Bob	St
1.10.1	Will this program interfere/overwrite, or conflict with Norton in any way?	St
1.10.2	Which machine do I need to run this thing on, the PC or the laptop?	St
1.11.1	Also, the PC can see the laptop fine, and all of its shared folders...just not the laptop-&gt;PC (and hence the printers)	St
1.12.1	NIL	St
1.13.1	Will this program interfere/overwrite, or conflict with Norton in any way?	St
1.13.2	Which machine do I need to run this thing on, the PC or the laptop?	St
1.14.1	Norton is likely the reason you haven't got it working.	St
1.14.2	Again, Network Magic removes the need for you to learn about accounts, permissions, firewalls, network names and more.	St
1.14.3	If you want to do it manually, please check each area in depth.	Sug
1.14.4	Bob	St
