i bought a t23 2647 laptop a while ago.
everything worked perfectly untill i found out that i had no graphics card.
i used the dxdiag run program to search for my device and there it said &quot;N/A&quot; i looked around my C drive for a bit and i found ATI and S3 Savage drivers in my video drivers folder.... could it be that it doesnt recognize my device?
or did the guy who sold it to me take it out before he sold it to me?
i dont really wanna take appart my laptop but if anyone has instructions in how to do so i would unwilling look for my graphics card
