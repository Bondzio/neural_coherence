<s> Hi, My system was working perfectly, sound worked great. </s>
<s> Then, I was going thru the menu's in musicmatchjb, and I tried to go into player setup, and mmjb crashed. </s>
<s> Then, when I restarted it, I found that it would not play. </s>
<s> It gave a message like: mmjb failure: soundcard problem, or something like that. </s>
<s> I looked in device manager, and it said my sb was working, but still I had no sound. </s>
<s> So, I deleted the sb from the device manager, and proceeded to restart so the card would be recognized again. </s>
<s> A card was recoginzed, but it said &quot;PCI multimedia device&quot;, no SBLive ... Then, it asked for a driver which I couldn't find, but would not accept any driver on the creative sblive install disk. </s>
<s> Next, I removed everything from the computer that I thought had to do with the sb. </s>
<s> First, I did add/remove programs and removed SBLive, and all software. </s>
<s> I removed the wave device that was added to device manager. </s>
<s> No sound card was listed. </s>
<s> I went thru and manually removed everything in the registry that had the words creative, or cddb, or anything else I thought might be related. </s>
<s> Now I try to restart again. </s>
<s> Same thing! </s>
<s> I can't install this card, yet I know it works. </s>
<s> When I got close at one point to getting it to at least install something, I would get a &quot;ctstub&quot; error. </s>
<s> I really need help. </s>
<s> I use the pc mainly for music anymore, and without sound, this thing is a boat anchor. </s>
<s> The manual says that when the dialog comes up for selecting a driver location, to cancel and insert the install disk and go thru the process. </s>
<s> Sometimes that goes thru, but while still in that program, the found new device (PCI multimedia device) comes up again. </s>
<s> I click cancel, and the install finishes, but no sound card is ever installed. </s>
<s> PLEASE HELP I have win98 installed if that helps. </s>
<s> I know I have been long winded, but I wanted to give as much info as I could so someone out there can understand the problem and hopefully help. </s>
<s> TIA, Viper </s>
<s> did you try re-seating the card in its slot? </s>
<s> --fj </s>
<s> The card is firmly seated in the socket. </s>
<s> This seems like a windows system/driver problem to me. </s>
<s> I removed the software and device from device manager, and reinstalled windows. </s>
<s> Windows did not correctly pick up the card when reinstalled. </s>
<s> Then, with the new windows installation, I removed all sb software and devices again. </s>
<s> Then, rebooted. </s>
<s> This time, it did recognize the card. </s>
<s> It recognized two things actually. </s>
<s> 1. sblive 5.1 wave sound device and 2. pci multimedia audio device. </s>
<s> The only one it asked for the driver for was the pci, and I said cancel. </s>
<s> Then I used the sb disk to run it's installation. </s>
<s> Seemed to go well, but when finished and restarted, I got the new hw found: pci mult audio device again. </s>
<s> I clicked cancel again. </s>
<s> Then went to device manager. </s>
<s> The soundblaster card was NOT listed. </s>
<s> What else can be done to get this card to install. </s>
<s> Where else can I get help? </s>
<s> TIA, Viper </s>
