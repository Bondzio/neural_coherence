thanks, i'll look into the anti-virus software you mentioned.
and, yes, i was running norton when the astro was brought to it's knees.
as for the mac, i do need to find a checker somewhere -- i was hoping to find something on-line -- because i am one of those dumb users who when a website says i need to download software to see a file, do as i am told.
i don't purposely visit bizarre sites, but i do end up in the most unusual places sometimes when doing a search.
if you know anyplace a mac can go to make sure it hasn't picked up some trojan horse, i'd appreciate directions.
thanks.
