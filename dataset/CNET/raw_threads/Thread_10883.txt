I currently have a G4 Power PC with version 10.3.9 installed and i tried to upgrade it again because i cannot afford a new computer. Doing some research I found out that i cannot upgrade to leopard or use the new CS3 programs as they are not compatible to 10.3.9 . I create Graphics for print ,web and 3D .What does someone recommend since Price is the issue . i was looking at the Apple Power Mac G5 - PPC G5 1.6 GHz ,Apple Power Mac G5 (1.8GHz, 256MB RAM, 80GB HDD),Apple Power Mac G5 - PPC G5 2 GHz,Apple Mac Pro Dual-Core Xeon 5150 2.66 GHz.

Do you recommend something else??What do you think i can get for $1500 or less that will be powerful enough for 10.4 or more and for the latest adobe software Thanks.

It comes pre-installed with Leopard so that shouldn't be a problem. Every review I read on the iMac raved about its features and ease of use. If I were to buy any Mac at all it would be the iMac. What's your budget? The iMac is essentially a mainstream system unless you configure it with all top of the line components.

7714	5	287231	2726414	2726318	artchick	3/10/08 6:15 PM	1.2051729E12	beacuse i have a budget	I called apple store and they told me that i should look at the Imacs or i can do leasing on the new 8 core workstation. Not sure .
7714	6	287231	2726447	2726314	artchick	3/10/08 6:49 PM	1.20517494E12	thanks	I know the imacs come with leopard. I have a new keyboard and monitor so i was looking for just for a tower. but that may be the way to go

7714	8	287231	2727106	2726460	artchick	3/11/08 4:19 PM	1.20525234E12	you are right	I went to the Mac store today and the sales guy told me that i should base my decision on what i can afford . I decided i am going to get an Imac for now and then in a year or two when i have more $$ i will invest in the Mac Pro.I am going to research and see if i can sell my G4 and get something for it. Plus i just applied for a Mac Visa credit card and well see if i am approved. * All the advantages of a Visa credit card * No interest for up to 90 days for today's purchase (2) * iTunes reward points with every purchase * Open line of credit up to $25,000 (4) * No prepayment penalty * No annual fee * Flexible spending
