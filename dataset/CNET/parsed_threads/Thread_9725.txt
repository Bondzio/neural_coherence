<s> Hi, I'm building a new system, and I'm asking for recommendations for a motherboard. </s>
<s> I bought a cpu/mobo combo, and got a crappy mobo. </s>
<s> What I'm building around is: Athlon XP 3000+ barton (333FSB) 1 gb dual channel PC3200 DDR ram (400FSB) Ati Radeon 9800 pro 256 video card Hercules gamesurround Muse 5.1 DVD sound card (is this crap ?) </s>
<s> Features I'm looking for are: dual bios or an easy way to en/disable dual channel for ram (depending on what I'm doing) integrated lan 2 SATA channels 4 PATA133 channels firewire I'll be running win98 and linux. </s>
<s> I'll be using it for gaming and video editing thanx </s>
<s> at [www.tomshardware.com] and [www.anandtech.com]. </s>
<s> Pay close attention to whether the RAID controller can be used for ATA and ATAPI drives. </s>
<s> Some only allow use for RAID. </s>
<s> thanx </s>
<s> We really are interested. </s>
<s> OK, I went back to AMD's site, and after wading through the 7 pages of recommended mobos, I pared the list down to these: Abit KW7-G NF7 albatron KX18D ProII asus A7N8X Deluxe A7V880 biostar M7NCD ULTRA chaintech 7NJL6 7NJS Ultra ZENITH dfi LANPARTY NFII ULTRA NFII ULTRA INFINITY epox EP-8RDA3+ Pro giga-byte GA-7VT880-L GA-7VT880 Pro GA-7N400 Pro2 GA-7N400-L GA-7N400 GA-7N400-L1 GA-7N400 Pro GA-7NNXP leadtek WinFast K7NCR18D-ProII msi K7N2 Delta2 Platinum K7N2 Delta-ILSR shuttle AN35N soyo SY-KT880 DRAGON 2 SY-KT880 Dragon 2 v2.0 What I need to know is if there is a consensus on what chipset I should go with, via or nvidia, to avoid conflicts with my ATI video card. </s>
<s> Then I can start scanning reviews of the remaining choices. </s>
<s> Thanx </s>
<s> favor the NVIDIAn Force ultra BUT by only the slightest of margins. </s>
<s> usually somewhat more expensive. </s>
<s> They have the dual BIOS, but at least on the one that I use at work, the CMOS chips are soldered on the board. </s>
<s> I'm not certain that I would rather have a single BIOS on a plug in CMOS chip. </s>
<s> In emergency one can get a new chip. </s>
<s> The good thing is that their ITE gigaraid chip allows rhe ports to be used for ATA drives or ATAPI drives. </s>
<s> Don't get dual bios and dual channel memory mixed up. </s>
<s> The way to go from dual chamnnel memory setup would be to open the case and move one of the memory sticks to the non dual channel slot. </s>
<s> taint automatic. </s>
<s> led you to the wrong mobo?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> My question is...does my video card brand (ATI) determine which brand of mobo chipset I'll get the best results with? </s>
<s> So far, after posting this question in 8 different forums, I've got: 11 it doesn't matters 1 &quot;I had a problem once&quot; vs the one post that made me start this line of inquiry Thanx </s>
<s> NIL </s>
