Just yesterday I found a machine that would corrupt any volume that was plugged into its USB ports.
-&gt; Would that upset you?
It did its owner as they had nothing backed up on DVDRW or such.
-&gt; Why I note this.
The USB hardware was reliable.
After we found the cause and fixed that, all devices that we could format began to work again so the bottom line was &quot;all the hardware was reliable.&quot; Bob
