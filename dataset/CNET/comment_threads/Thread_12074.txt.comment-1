I have a desktop and three laptops.
There is a router theat takes the internet signal and puts it out to the desktop then out to another router that has my printer and three laptops going through the second router.
I set up a network and all four of the computers are part of the same workgroup.
The three laptops can see and access the desktop but nothing can access any of the laptops.
I don't know how to solve this.
