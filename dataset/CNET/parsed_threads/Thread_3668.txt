<s> I have not used Seagate Hard Drives for a long time so don't know if this is normal. </s>
<s> It makes a lot of noise the the Western Digital drives don't. </s>
<s> This started when I had 3 BSOD in one day and as soon as it would re-boot, it would go right into CHKDSK. </s>
<s> The computer is still under warranty so I called Dell and after some trouble shooting steps it was determined the hard drive is going bad. </s>
<s> The tech came out the next day and installed a new Seagate hard drive, that's the one making noise that sounds like someone tapping on the bottom of a aluminium can with a pencil or stick. </s>
<s> Not real load, but very anoying. </s>
<s> Turns out the drive was sent with the wrong image and they have to send another hard drive to replace this one. </s>
<s> The tech will be here tomorrow and I have no idea what brand hard drive it will be. </s>
<s> Is this noise normal with the Seagate drives or was I just very unlucky? </s>
<s> Thanks Wayne </s>
<s> The tech was a day early and installed the drive today. </s>
<s> It was another Seagate drive and this one you can't hear at all, so the first one must have been bad. </s>
<s> One bonus is the first drive was a 640 gig and the new one is a 1 Terabyte drive. </s>
<s> To me it sounds like some harmonic being created and emanating from the cover. </s>
<s> You said a pencil tapping on a can. </s>
<s> The covers on newer drives can be very thin and made to flex easily. </s>
<s> That could be just the way it sounds when the heads move and the vibration is picked up by the cover. </s>
<s> Putting some foam tape on it might have reduced the noise. </s>
<s> Of course the 1TB drive will be a different model and could be made differently. </s>
<s> As long as you're happy with it, that's fine but don't think that all drive noise is an omen of impending doom. </s>
<s> The 1 terabyte drive has been working great and still no noise. </s>
<s> One thing is it appears the bigger drive is actaully faster than the 640. </s>
<s> I thought it would be just the opposite. </s>
<s> This is not only the seak time, but also boot up and shut down. </s>
