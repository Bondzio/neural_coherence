1.1.1	Hi, I am new to skype and looking for a cordless phone with a range over 10m to use dedicated for skype.	St
1.1.2	I want to keep my current landline phone as is for the moment.	St
1.1.3	I am also looking at buying for my mother a skype phone where no PC is required so she can talk to her sister in UK anytime if she gets a similar set up.	St
1.1.4	Not sure how these work but assume you only need a phone line socket.	St
1.1.5	Does anyone have any good recommendations for phones I could buy within a budget as I have seen some VERY expensive ones and I'm a bit nervous about the cheaper ones and their quality.	Ques
