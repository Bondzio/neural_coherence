But if you are trying to hide the IP's, the DNS service won't help there.
My background includes writing early router code back in the early 90's so I'm an old hand at networking.
I don't mind discussing topics and must take folk's word on this and that.
If someone tells me they are using a DNS service then I nod, file that and proceed with what that does.
If someone meant they use a Proxy or VPN instead, I can't guess that and shouldn't because VPN, Proxy, DNS are all very different things.
