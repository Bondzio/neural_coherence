I have an older sata hd that already has an os on it that I need to get some info from.
How can I connect this to my current system?
If I just plug it into my extra sata slot, will it automatically read my current still as the boot drive?
And if so, will I have to download any drivers to be able to access this old hd to pull the info off of it?
Sorry if its a little confusing.
I used to work on computers but haven't dealt with any in a while, especially sata.
Thanks!
