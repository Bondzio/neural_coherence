assuming that dhcp is properly configured to begin with, 1. yes, you would disable dhcp on the wifi router.
2. you would connect from lan port to lan port (do not use the wan port on the wifi router).
if you have further problems, you may need to provide more details (isp, make/model of all networking devices, error messages, etc.)
