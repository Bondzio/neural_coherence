i don't know what you are meaning in &quot;moving the laser at the speed that the cds/dvds move&quot; are you insinuating that a laser moves slower, or faster, than current cds or dvds?
i seem to think you are hinting that a laser is slow in comparing to our fast dvds.
if that is what you mean (and i apologize if i read that wrong) then you are somewhat mistaken.
the laser beam can be deflected at a rate far exceeding anything mechanical.
i work in the computer printer industry.
in fact, it was my company that created the first laser printers back in the early 70's.
we were deflecting laser beams at radio frequency rates back then, and they go a heck of a lot faster now.
now we make 2 page per second laser printers.
that's pages!
think about how fast that laser beam has to travel and pulse to do 2 pages at a resolution of 2400 dots per inch horizontally and vertically.
and what do to think is reading and writing today's cds and dvds now?
it's lasers.
laser beams can be deflected exactly like a tv raster.
deflecting it horizontally and vertically with the greatest of ease.
(that's not how we do it in the printers though - that's a whole other story.)
it isn't done with magnetic fields though (but it could be).
instead, some use piezoelectric crystals that can be pulsed at extremely high rates.
besides, i have already seen a flat card read by a laser, no rotating disks, at a comdex show over 10 years ago.
the capacity was &quot;great&quot;, for that time , somewhere on the order on 100mb on a 3 sq inch surface - which is small compared to today's magnetic medium.
but it was just a start.
i don't know whatever happened to them.
i remember they were handing out an entire star trek game on the card for demos.
but you had to buy - when it became available - their card reader to read it.
