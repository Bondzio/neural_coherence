1.1.1	Right now I have my spare HDD in an enclosure plugged into my laptop , and easiest way to say it is the wheel 's spinning but the hamster is dead .	St
1.1.2	My laptop is picking up the USB connection , but I 'm not able to access the drive itself .	St
1.1.3	I hear a disk spinning but it use to spin up and stop a lot before , now its just steady .	St
1.1.4	I think this might have been caused by a premature power off .	St
1.1.5	I was hibernating my laptop for the night , and just hit the power switch on the drive as well .	St
1.1.6	There should n't have been any transmitting activity but I might have missed something .	St
1.1.7	Checking the other threads it seems like there 's little to be done .	St
1.1.8	I have no access to an actual desktop at the moment , so I ca n't check if the disk is really dead or its just the enclosure not working .	St
1.1.9	Honestly I might have to just invest in a server box or something at this rate .	St
1.2.1	In other words , you hear the default tone ?	Ques
1.2.2	I 'd check in disk manager to see if the drive shows there as unpartitioned space .	St
1.2.3	If so , that could account for it 's disappearance in explorer because it would have no drive letter .	St
1.2.4	If not , and you have a PC available , you can remove the drive and connect it to a motherboard port to see if it shows there .	St
1.2.5	If you care to go one step further and know the drive 's manufacturer , you can try to download their diagnostic utility to see if it can find and test the drive .	St
1.3.1	Alright .	St
1.3.2	I do n't have a desktop on me , so where can I find disk manager ?	Ques
1.3.3	I remember it from somewhere , but its been a while .	St
1.4.1	If you do n't know who the manufacturer is , you need to remove it from the enclosure to look .	St
1.4.2	It should have the model as well .	St
1.4.3	You need to go to that manufacturer 's web site and look for their diagnostics disk .	St
1.4.4	It may take some searching .	St
1.4.5	If you have difficulty and can post the brand and model here , I 'm sure someone here can dig up a link for you .	St
1.4.6	These generally download as an executable that can create a bootable floppy or CD ROM disk .	St
1.4.7	You boot this disk with the suspect HD attached .	St
1.4.8	If the utility detects a controller that it can deal with , it will display it .	St
1.4.9	There should be a variety of testing options available but , since each manufacturer has their own utility , I ca n't direct you specifically as to what these are .	St
1.4.10	I know that WD , Seagate , and Hitachi have fairly good utilities but there are some that are limited ... I think Toshiba might be one of these .	St
1.4.11	As well , if your drive is such as an old Maxtor or Quantum , these have been taken over by other manufacturers and some utilities are no longer readily available .	St
1.4.12	Pull the drive from the enclosure and check its label .	St
1.4.13	Good luck .	Polite
1.5.1	WD600BB .	St
1.5.2	Found the downloads on the WD site .	St
1.5.3	Got a trial version of Partition manager off cnet as well .	St
1.5.4	It sees the drive , and seems to be able to format it .	St
1.5.5	Have n't tried since I want to see if I can save this data .	St
1.5.6	Well the diagnostic can see the drive , and seems to be able to check it properly .	St
1.5.7	Pass the quick scan .	St
1.5.8	Running through the extended one right now .	St
1.5.9	Now looking at this it might just be a vista thing .	St
1.5.10	Which does n't help since I have nothing else to work off of .	St
1.6.1	So I guess this means the drive works , and the enclosure works to some degree .	St
1.6.2	So I guess what 's left is test this on another computer , probably at least with a mobo .	St
1.7.1	you might experiment with the jumpers .	St
1.7.2	Since there 's only one possible connection , I 've seen these get confused if set to master or slave .	St
1.7.3	Try CS if you 've not done so already .	St
1.8.1	Well I 'm under the impression that if the jumper is set to anything not listed under the choices , it defaults to CS .	St
1.8.2	I think I 'll try it without the jumper .	St
1.8.3	Just plugged the external w/ usb to another laptop , still being detected alright but still no drive .	St
1.8.4	So it looks like it might be something wrong when I turned it off last time .	St
1.9.1	I 'm guessing formatting it through the Diag would probably be the only solution at this rate as well ?	Ques
1.10.1	Jumper setting was set at just cable select .	St
1.10.2	Removing it set it as single .	St
1.10.3	Which still did n't work , but misinformed right there .	St
1.10.4	Might as well try the other two .	St
1.11.1	Okay , after finding out where disk management was ( Stupid vista ) , I probably could 've learned that the disk was & quot ; Not Initialized. & quot ; Might 've fixed my problem before I decided to use the WD diag to write zeros to the entire disk .	St
1.11.2	Course , that is if initializing did n't force you to reformat the drive anyway .	St
1.11.3	Just my luck .	Polite
