sorry but I did not realize in what forum I was in before i just started asking questions... Well if you can help, that'll be awesome.. 15L x 13W x 9H room.
Tv viewing distance about 10'.
If I'm watching tv; wall to the left, sliding glass door/wall on the rear, kitchen to the right(8' of open space), 2'Wide wall next to kitchen leading to dining room(5' of open space).
Any help would be appreciated..
