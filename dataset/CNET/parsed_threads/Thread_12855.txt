<s> I've read a lot about both of these systems, and the majority of reviews are very positive. </s>
<s> The price difference does not concern me. </s>
<s> I am by no means an audiophile, and I'm pretty sure that the difference in satellite sound will not concern me. </s>
<s> What I am most concerned about is the subwoofer. </s>
<s> I primarily listen to rock music, but I do enjoy a little bit of everything. </s>
<s> I know that the Klipsch sub is able to hit lower notes, but does this actually mean anything? </s>
<s> Can anyone recommend one sub over the other? </s>
<s> This system will travel back and forth with me to school, so durability and portability are also a bit of a concern, but I don't expect the speakers to be banged up. </s>
<s> Also any comments about any aspect of each product is really appreciated. </s>
<s> None of the stores around me carry either of these products to listen to, and I'd have to drive about a half hour to pick up the Klipsch...the z2300 is closer. </s>
<s> I'm having a really hard time deciding, so any and all input is greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> I haven't listened to the Klipsch, but I've never been a fan of the brand - too much sizzle comin' out of their horn-loaded tweeters... but some people like that... :? </s>
<s> I have the Z-2300s, and I like them a lot. </s>
<s> For computer speakers, they're great- they even have a semblance of a sound-stage! </s>
<s> I don't think that you'll have to worry about low-end output - If you're going back and forth to school, I'm assuming that you're not going to be putting them in a very large room - you should easily be able to reach adequate sound pressure levels- as always, take a little care with the placement of the sub. </s>
<s> Oh, on the portability side of things... they're not very... the set probably weighs 40 lbs+. </s>
<s> Oh, and to directly address your question about the real-world difference in frequency response range of the two subs - the cnet review said that there was some distortion... </s>
<s> I would take the sub with less distortion any day, even if it doesn't go as low. </s>
<s> A good sub, that's setup well, will blend in with the main channels - if you close your eyes, you shouldn't be able to tell where it is, bass frequencies are omnidirectional. </s>
<s> Distortion kills that illusion. </s>
<s> That, and the fact that you probably wont miss that frequency range anyway (unless you listen to pipe organs! </s>
<s> ), would make me lean towards the z-2300s </s>
<s> I really appreciate the information you've provided, thanks. </s>
<s> Definitely going to check out the z2300s. </s>
<s> Now do you have specific advice on sub placement? </s>
<s> Or somewhere to find out about that stuff? </s>
<s> In a nutshell - front of the room, near (but not in!) </s>
<s> a corner or wall. </s>
<s> Not-so-nutshell - if you have enough cable, place the sub where you would normally listen. </s>
<s> Play something with at least somewhat musical bass. </s>
<s> Walk around near the front of the room slowly, listening to the changes in the quality of the bass - bass frequencies/waves are long, as such very dependant on room shape, size and location within that space- it'll sound different at point A than it will at point B, even if they're only a foot apart. </s>
<s> So, on your walkabout, you'll find a place where it sounds best - good oomph, but not too bloated and boomy - that's where you want to put the sub. </s>
<s> Again, pay particular attention to the areas to the front of the room, near a corner or wall, but never up against one. </s>
<s> Also, never put a sub at the halfway point between opposite walls - the waves will reflect and tend cancel each other out. </s>
<s> After you get the sub placed, fiddle with the sub volume 'til it matches what's coming out of the L&R speakers (the z-2300 has a bass volume knob in addition to the master volume on the wired control). </s>
<s> If you REALLY want to get the most out of them (hehhehheh) go to RadioShack and get a $30 Sound Pressure Level (SPL) meter and a test disc and balance along the frequency range to your heart's content! </s>
<s> I should clarify - when I say to place the sub where you would normally listen, I mean, where you, yourself, would be when you're listening - if you would most likely sit 2 feet in front of the computer when listening, put it there. </s>
<s> If you're going to listen more from the edge of your bed, put it there, etc. </s>
<s> Great stuff, can't thank you enough for the info! </s>
