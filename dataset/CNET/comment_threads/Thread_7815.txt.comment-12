Backup is running as we speak.
I un-bundled the HDD SCSI cable to find...a female terminator plug, just like the one I just bought at Fry's for $15.
I set the tape drive to terminate, loaded the drivers from Veritas and away we go!
WAY faster than than the AIWA & 7.3, too.
A couple of parting questions... 1) Should I update the Adaptec 294x drivers?
I pulled one off the 'net last night from 2001 and put it on floppy, my feeling at this point is leave well enough alone 2) When I add my new HDD, should I use this same, native adapter or are there any benefits to using a newer, UW SCSI PCI card?
I plan on upgrading that next.
Thanks for all your help, I learned quite a bit too.
I'll be back when it's time to swap out the mobo... Tony
