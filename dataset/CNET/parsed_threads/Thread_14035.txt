<s> So I've been going around the internet for a couple hours now trying to find some decent ram that's compatible with my motherboard (ASUS M4A77TD) What I'm looking for is something along the lines of 8-12gb 1600MHz DDR3 $60-$80 I have 4 slots available to use. </s>
<s> I just picked up 12gb of Corsair Vengeance ram only to find out that it won't work with what I have. </s>
<s> The other problem is that I've found a few items that do work with my ASUS but are all out of stock at Tigerdirect, Newegg, etc. </s>
<s> strange value. </s>
<s> How did you arrive at that? </s>
<s> It seems all the ddr3 memory stick comes in 2/4gb each...and the board have 4 sockets. </s>
<s> Did you happen to get some 3gb ram or some spares that you want to use. </s>
<s> The prices are so reasonable, I probably would not want to mix them. </s>
<s> Take a look at Mwave or Fry's. </s>
<s> http://www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx?model=M4A77TD&amp;Cat=RAM Pick one. </s>
<s> Thanks Bob. </s>
<s> I'm guessing this is decent ram at the least. </s>
<s> Ahtoi- The stock ram was 2 2gb sticks while the Corsair was 3 4gb sticks. </s>
