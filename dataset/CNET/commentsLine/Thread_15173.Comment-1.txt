it's getting round to my pc laptop upgrade time again, and am wondering whether the galaxy note 10.1 (android) could serve as a laptop replacement if i get it with the keyboard dock and usb mouse for when i need to turn it into .
after all, my laptop needs are (i) that it is light and compact (ii) that it is compatible with high speed mobile internet use including skype and youtube (iii) stores pdfs, photos, and supports standard pc programmes such as word and excel.
gaming functionality is just a 'nice to have'.
is there any reason not to get the galaxy note 10.1 as my laptop replacement?
one reason i suppose is that samsung are apparently coming out with yet another tablet, but a windows based one.
is it worth me waiting for that if i am looking for a laptop replacement in my tab?
