a vac and a small brush for years...works fine.
don't get &quot;ham handed&quot; with the vac.
i can clean most of the innards without touching anything with the vac...just get it close.
heatsinks/fans/stubborn stuff..use the small brush and then bring the vac close.
there may be no right or wrong way to do this.
heck...one forum member uses 409 and a garden hose.
