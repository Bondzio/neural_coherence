<s> ... in the &quot;available wireless network list.&quot; I have had two desktop PCs connected to my wired home network. </s>
<s> I also had a D-LINK WBR-2310 wireless router installed. </s>
<s> I had created an &quot;Unsecure&quot; wireless network (abc123) to use my laptop. </s>
<s> It was working fine. </s>
<s> I was able to wirelessly connect to the Internet and peek into the desktops. </s>
<s> Yesterday, I decided to make the network secure by putting in a WEP key. </s>
<s> After that, the network has disappeared fro the network list and I have not been able to do anything with my laptop, wirelessly, that is. </s>
<s> When I try to create a new wireless network using the wireless wizard, it asks me you want to create new network or add a computer to the existing (abc123). </s>
<s> So it is there somewhere. </s>
<s> HP C751NR laptop; XP PRO; D-Link WBR2310. </s>
<s> PLEASE HELP! </s>
<s> We cover this in the top posts in this forum. </s>
<s> Who is saying this is secure? </s>
<s> With WEP cracking in 2 minutes what security is this? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Why are you using WEP? </s>
<s> It can be hacked in 30 seconds? </s>
<s> Thanks Bob for your comment. </s>
<s> I am not a techie. </s>
<s> I just thought secure is better. </s>
<s> Anyway that is hardly the point for me now. </s>
<s> I just want to connect wirelessly to the Internet. </s>
<s> Any thoughts? </s>
<s> How do I do that? </s>
<s> Pardon my ignorance. </s>
<s> Go back to what worked or move to other setups such as noted in this forum's sticky. </s>
<s> My question is still &quot;Who said that is secure?&quot; </s>
<s> Thanks everybody. </s>
<s> I was able to fix the problem by resetting the router and reinstalling and reconfiguring it. </s>
