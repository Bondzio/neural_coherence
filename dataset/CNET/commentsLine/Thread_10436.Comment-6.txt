have to install windows and the backup sw do the backup restore.
cloning can help you create an exact copy of the source drive to a target drive or cloning can help you create an image of a partition .. compressed or uncompressed to a folder on another hard drive.
i clone each partition of my drive 0 to a second hard drive ...drive 1, so the backups are smaller and take less time than doing the whole drive, i can restore either partition separately as needed.
i also copy the compressed images from drive 1 to an external hdd just for safety and peace of mind.
bottom line...cloning is the way to go if you want a fast simple way to get back up and running quickly and easily.
it's worked perfectly for me for years.
