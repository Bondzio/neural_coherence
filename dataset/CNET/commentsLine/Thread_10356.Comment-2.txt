really your only option on a router problem that you have to reset the hardware is to patch it and hope.
all routers have some limit on how much traffic they can pass but most when you exceed that limit most just slow down to almost unusable but as soon as you stop they recover.
if they lockup then you have some kind of bug.
not sure which wrt300n you have some you can load dd-wrt firmware.
since it is different firmware it may not have the same issue and since it has more debugging option maybe it would give you a idea.
still it does not run on all model of 300n.
routers that accept external antenna are hard to find.
way to many people worry about the appearance of the router rather than how well it technically works and they think antenna are ugly.
the best solution i have found it to use a ap and hook it to you favorite router.
the router does not even need to be wireless.
the nice thing about many ap is that these are designed to mount outdoor with the antenna solving many of the cable loss issues.
