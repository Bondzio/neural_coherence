<s> Since you have your SSD installed has it lived up to your expectations? </s>
<s> Does it do what you want or do you find it lacking or even more troublesome than a std. </s>
<s> HD? </s>
<s> Since, these have been out for some time and early problems resolved(I think) just are your thoughts on that? </s>
<s> I like to exclude any costs here, just your real PC experiences. </s>
<s> thanks -----Willy </s>
<s> Wasn't looking for the fastest around but just better boot, program launch, software updates, utilities execution and shutdown times vs. HDDs. </s>
<s> Got all handily and never bothered with benchmarking. </s>
<s> Have them in dt and notebooks. </s>
<s> No problems if FW is good. </s>
<s> Unfortunately not all mfrs support their SSDs with up-to-date FW and that has given SSDs a bad rap. </s>
<s> User reviews will point out the brands that satisfy more than others. </s>
<s> Not worried about longevity; 3 yr warranties cover me with replacements should they die prematurely and I have system image backups, in case. </s>
<s> After 3 yrs who cares, it's time for a new machine anyways; small businesses feel differently, but they shouldn't because it's a bad decision to stall due to HW wearouts. </s>
<s> Don't &quot;store&quot; data on system drives, be they HDDs or SSDs. </s>
<s> Therefore only buy SSD up to capacity necessary for OS and apps to save money and heartaches. </s>
<s> It seems to be a little faster but nothing to brag about. </s>
<s> But the price has come down abit... which is a good thing. </s>
<s> I bought mine for $80/120GB to see just what it's like. </s>
