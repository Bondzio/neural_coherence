Unfortunely, you need the firewall.
The good news is, there are *free* firewalls just as good as the commerical types.
They are Kerio, Zonealarm and SysGate to name a few, just google for them.
While Norton's s/w is good, I try to shy away from it as when it starts to puke it tends to cause more problems plus its a resource hog, IMHO.
Up to you, though.
