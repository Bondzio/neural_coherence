<s> Quick Question: I have a printer with a USB connection currently connected to my Win XP desktop. </s>
<s> I don't really care for the Windows print feature on XP, seems to be hit or miss with my other pcs on the network at times. </s>
<s> I would like to know if I can connect the printer directly to the network router port. </s>
<s> I understand there are USB to ethernet adapters, will this assign an IP from the router that other PC's can use as a network printer, or do I need to get a mini print server? </s>
<s> Also, the printer port is the type B square USB connection, while most convertors have a type A to LAN. </s>
<s> Do they sell a type B unit? </s>
<s> Each device connected to a router must have a NIC. </s>
<s> Does your printer have a NIC? </s>
<s> Either the printer manufacturer offers an internal print server that you can install in the printer, or you get to purchase a USB print server. </s>
<s> USB-A or -B doesn't matter because you can purchase whatever cable you need. </s>
<s> There are wired and wireless print server models. </s>
<s> It's best to purchase a print server that is known to work with your printer model. </s>
