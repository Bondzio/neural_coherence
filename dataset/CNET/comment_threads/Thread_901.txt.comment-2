i think ure referring to the t6212.
the ram it uses is ddr400/pc3200 although it is compatible with ddr333/pc2700.
i'm not sure whether dat is possible to run it different speeds.
i would rather by the same speed ones at 400mhz.
What is the price difference?
Is it so much dat ure not willing to fork over the dough?
Also i would not go with the x700 pro as it suks compared to the 6600gt.
at newegg, evga 6600 gt is $160.
