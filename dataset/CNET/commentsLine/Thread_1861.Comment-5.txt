first thanks a lot for your detailed description...i appreciate it i do have a few questions though.
1. in your example, the printer ip address was one more than the default gateway...is that a mistake cuz you said one more than the pc's ip addresses?
2. you said to &quot;make sure to verify the ip is not being used by another device on your network.&quot; i'm not sure what you mean by this...i don't think i have a network set up.
do i have to actually do something in order to set up a network?
3. where does the other end of the printer ethernet cable go?
phone jack in the wall?
4. when adding a printer, it asks the &quot;device type.&quot; the options are &quot;autodetect, tcp/ip device, and web services device.&quot; which do i choose?
sorry for all of the questions...i'm just not really familiar with this type of thing thanks again!
