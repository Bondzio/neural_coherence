<s> I am getting ready to build a PC for the first time. </s>
<s> It's time to retire my Dell! </s>
<s> I was wondering what type of video card I should look at. </s>
<s> I am not a gamer, but I primarily use my PC for video editing and encoding (AVI - MPEG2 - DVD). </s>
<s> I have had lots of overnight encoding sessions with my Dell, and I am ready for some speed. </s>
<s> I am planning on going with an Athlon 64 3200+, and my mobo choice depends on what type of video card will work better for me. </s>
<s> Thanks for your advice! </s>
<s> Go for a PCI-EXPRESS! </s>
<s> As for the motherboard, get socket 939 with at least 1 PCI-EXPRESS x16 slot. </s>
<s> As for the motherboard specifically, well theres lot to choose from. </s>
<s> Get what is right for you, try to balance price with features. </s>
<s> ROger </s>
<s> Avoid PCI Express. </s>
<s> It's new, but not better. </s>
<s> Motherboards equiped with PCI Express sockets cost more. </s>
<s> 16x PCI Express runs faster than 8X AGP only in theory. </s>
<s> In the real world, AGP comes out faster almost every time. </s>
<s> Graphic cards aren't nearly fast enough for AGP to become a bottleneck. </s>
<s> PCI Express tends to be less efficient, and tasks the CPU more than AGP, especially when a big game is running, and the CPU is working at nearly 100%. </s>
<s> Also, the last time I checked, the fastest graphics card aviliable is still AGP. </s>
<s> It's not a matter of paying a lot more for a little bit of speed increase. </s>
<s> By buying PCI Express, you'll be paying a lot more for a slower machine. </s>
<s> When the first AGP cards came they weren't much faster than the top PCI video cards. </s>
<s> But then AGP 2x then 4x and 8x came along. </s>
<s> We are at the same point now in the switch from AGP to PCIx. </s>
<s> So at this point in time if I were to build a new PC I would still go with a good AGP card. </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> Right now there is hardly any game performance difference in AGP vs PCI-Express. </s>
<s> I have not read anywhere that AGP is faster than PCI-E. PCI Express x16 (double x8) offers an increased bandwidth of 4GB. </s>
<s> As always, when there is more bandwidth available, developers will find a way to put it to good use, driving the technology into the mainstream. </s>
<s> It may take a little time until this will really show in any applications, especially games, but future 3D games and applications will continue to become more realistic and eventually will need more bandwidth. </s>
<s> It can be noted that the latest motherboards being produced are looking to the furure producing PCI-Express X-16, x1, and x4 slots. </s>
<s> Also ATI & Nvidia see the future and have shifted to PCI-E, but realize there is an awful lot of current AGP boards out there and don't want to miss out on the $'s so are producing AGP versions of their PCI-E cards. </s>
<s> As someone at Tom's Hardware once said, &quot;It's a case of &quot;If you build it, they will come!&quot; Something like finally Intel announced in February their shift to 64-bit (EM64T). </s>
<s> The 5xx series Processors are being replaced with the 6xx series and 8xx (dual core) that contain EM64T. </s>
<s> There is not a lot of applications currently available for 64-bit, but it will be the wave for the future and even games will be forthcoming with 64-bit and dual core applications, re Intels announcement: http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20050308net.htm?iid=search& It should also be noted that companies like Dell, HP, etc... are now producing computers with the 6xx series (EM64T & PCI-Express), and as soon as they sell out of the 5xx series, then EM64T, PCI-E, and of course Dual Core will be the computers sold for Intel. </s>
<s> AGP have not became a bottleneck for graphic cards, not by a long shot. </s>
<s> What's with the 4GB bandwidth? </s>
<s> Does anyone's computer even has 4GB of memory? </s>
<s> O_o PCI Express is more complex and creates more overhead. </s>
<s> Identical GPUs will always run faster on AGP than PCI Express. </s>
<s> GPUs nowdays are nowhere nearly fast enough for AGP to become a bottleneck, and they won't for the near future. </s>
<s> Also, they're putting more and more onboard graphics memory. </s>
<s> This reduces load on the bus, as the GPU don't have to access the main memory bank as much. </s>
<s> It delays that date even further. </s>
<s> Chances are, by the time PCI Express actually becomes useful, your computer would be obsolete anyway. </s>
<s> Last time I checked, the fastest graphics card is still AGP. </s>
<s> If you look at the present, using PCI Express is the same as paying more for a slower computer. </s>
<s> &quot;the fastest graphics card is still AGP&quot;just what card is that? </s>
<s> Where did I or anyone say AGP has become a bottleneck. </s>
<s> Perhaps you have been reading too many kiddie gamer forums. </s>
<s> Please read my post...it is about the future. </s>
<s> Didn't I indicate AGP & PCIe are currently about the same in performance. </s>
<s> Please provide a link that shows what you say..re: &quot;Identical GPUs will always run faster on AGP than PCI Express&quot;. </s>
<s> I guess some people just cannot bear a change or that PCI-e is currently taking over in motherboards and video cards...... </s>
<s> Thanks for all the inputs...I think I will go with an AGP card. </s>
<s> As I said I am not a gamer, so I don't need the top of the line card. </s>
<s> I was looking at this card: ATI ALL-IN-WONDER Radeon 9600XT 128MB 128-bit DDR VIVO AGP 4X/8X Video Card - Retail . </s>
<s> Newegg ~ $189 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814102352 I like the TV Tuner aspect, and since my primary purpose is video editing, being able to hook up my VCR/Video Camera directly is a big plus. </s>
<s> The price is about as much as I want to spend. </s>
<s> What do you think? </s>
<s> PCI-Express isn't high-end. </s>
<s> It's standard now. </s>
<s> You can get some pci-express cards cheaper than the agp versions... Roger </s>
<s> since u r not into gamin, this card can meet ur video needs i think...try go look http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814102345 its 40 dollars cheaper </s>
<s> That's definately too expensive... ^_^ As I said, it'll be a long while before AGP becomes a bottleneck. </s>
<s> Definately not in the next few years. </s>
<s> The thing is, by the time graphics cards reaches that speed, and PCI Express becomes the standard, the rest of your PC would be obsolete anyway. </s>
<s> PCI Express is definately faster, a lot faster. </s>
<s> It's just this extra bandwidth does not make a difference today. </s>
<s> I'm not talking about 10 years from now. </s>
<s> Today, here and now, PCI Express gives you no advantage in speed whatsoever. </s>
<s> PCI Express also creates more overhead, which actually lowers speed, especially with chipsets designed for AGP, which is the overwhelming majority of GPUs today. </s>
<s> You'll be paying extra for not speed gain, and in most cases, net loss in speed. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> just like the 64-bit wave, pci-express would soon dominate the market and future gfx card will only support pci-express. </s>
<s> i bet the gfx card manufacturers will soon stop makin agp cards just as intel will stop makin the 5xxseries prescotts. </s>
<s> Definitely will be in the next year or two. </s>
<s> Soon, ati and nvidia will stop porting their high-end cards to agp. </s>
<s> So basically expect the 6800 ultra to be the last agp card... </s>
<s> The manufacturers won't stop providing agp cards, but don't expect new models, but models avilable now. </s>
<s> Like the 9200se, nvidia 5200, etc. </s>
<s> AGP cards will soon be stuck in time. </s>
<s> I wonder if any of them will come true. </s>
<s> They made the same assumption about PCI Express a year ago, and you know how that turned out. </s>
<s> Of course PCI Express is faster, no arguements there. </s>
<s> There is no way such things will happen in the next one or two years. </s>
<s> Graphics cards cant become fast enough for AGP to be a bottleneck during that time. </s>
<s> I's say 3 years at least, during which your PC built today will be obsolete in any case. </s>
<s> You have to think about the need for a new bus. </s>
<s> As long as AGP is not a bottlneck, the need for PCI Express does not exist. </s>
<s> Getting PCI Express now will mean paying extra for no benefits. </s>
<s> Also, they've been saying the same thing about 64 bit applications for a long time. </s>
<s> Today, there are no 64 bit applications, because there is no need for it. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> There are no true 64 bit applications, only a few test cases where they made a 64 bit variants of normal applications. </s>
<s> These don't offer any significant advantages anyway. </s>
<s> It'll be a long time before 64 bit replaces normal as standard. </s>
<s> By then, a computer you build today would be obsolete anyway. </s>
<s> y do u keep saying &quot;y do u keep saying &quot;By then, a computer you build today would be obsolete anyway&quot; i dont think so as i dont think 64-bit apps r that far off as alerady has 64-bit windows, 64-bit far cry, and intel and amd all have 64-bit processors out and i'm sure developers r soon gonna take advantage of dat and make 64-bit apps. </s>
<s> There is no significant difference between normal Far Cry and 64 big Far Cry. </s>
<s> It's just an adaption for the existing software which offer no real benefits of 64 bit. </s>
<s> I wouldn't consider these real 64 bit software. </s>
<s> 64 bit windows has been around for a while. </s>
<s> They said that 64 bit would take over immediately after the news breaks out. </s>
<s> That hasn't happened. </s>
<s> Look at the old pattern here. </s>
<s> People are always eager to jump on new technologies. </s>
<s> Eventually times do change, just not as soon as you would think. </s>
<s> Right now, it makes no sense to pay a lot more for no benefits. </s>
