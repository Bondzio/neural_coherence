I want to keep my current landline phone as is for the moment. I am also looking at buying for my mother a skype phone where no PC is required so she can talk to her sister in UK anytime if she gets a similar set up. Not sure how these work but assume you only need a phone line socket. Does anyone have any good recommendations for phones I could buy within a budget as I have seen some VERY expensive ones and I'm a bit nervous about the cheaper ones and their quality. Thanks for your help Kelly
