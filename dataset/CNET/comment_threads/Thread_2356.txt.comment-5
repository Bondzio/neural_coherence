So, last night the router sort of wigged out.
While I was on the laptop upstairs and the renter was on her laptop downstairs the connection would go in and out over and over again with like 10-45sec between lost connections.
Then it was like the router won the battle and all connectivity was lost.
I went down to the desktop and tried to see if I could access the router settings and I wouldn't connect to them.
Now the connection was down and I couldn't get on the internet so I tried to access the settings from my favorites page and it didn't work, then I tried hard typing in the address and it didn't work either.
It was mentioned that my router has deeper issues if this was undoable.
It's an old router at this point, 3years, is it just going out?
Also, I would like to thank you for sharing your tech knowledge with those of us with less:) Thanks bill012!
