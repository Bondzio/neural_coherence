<s> I stupidly formatted the wrong hard drive when there are two external hard drives connected on my computer. </s>
<s> It is a WD external hard drive. </s>
<s> I heard about the data recovery software which could help restore the saved data back from a formatted drive. </s>
<s> But, I am afraid the program may make things worse. </s>
<s> Do I have to use a data recovery program to get back my videos? </s>
<s> Is there any one that could give me some suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> You don't have to use a data recovery program, that option is entirely yours to make. </s>
<s> But if you want this data back you either try those or send the drive to some data recovery business. </s>
<s> That 2nd option will cost a lot. </s>
<s> Have a look at the software suggested in Lost and Found. </s>
<s> Or the Storage Forum Sticky, . </s>
<s> There are some good suggestions there, but which ones work best, if at all, can only be found by trying. </s>
<s> Remember, you are unlikely to recover all your lost files. </s>
<s> I assume you have no backups? </s>
<s> Mark </s>
<s> It's at the top of the forum and progresses from free to try before buy to data recovery houses. </s>
<s> REMEMBER TO NEVER WRITE TO SAID DRIVE!!! </s>
<s> We only do that after we recovered (copied out) the lost files. </s>
<s> In the future be sure of your backup systems so you won't repeat this problem. </s>

<s> After accidentally deleting the needed data, one could use a data recovery programs or ask for a data recovery service from the expert and data recovery company. </s>
<s> But, the latter choice always needs much money. </s>
<s> So, if you have no much money for it, you could firstly try some drive data recovery freeware. </s>
<s> In fact, as I know, there are many drive data recovery freeware that could work much efficiently than some paid ones, such as Recuva, TestDisk and iCare Data Recovery Free, etc. </s>
<s> Therefore, do not save anything new on this formatted drive in case of data loss and select a proper data recovery program to take chances. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
<s> Thank you so much for your explanation of formatted drive data recovery. </s>
<s> After mistakenly formatting this hard drive, I am really worried that I could make thing worse. </s>
<s> But, fortunately, after reading your answer, I have tried your mentioned data recovery freeware and restore back all my wanted files back! </s>
<s> Thank you thank you thank you for your help. </s>
<s> If you do not want to make things worse when you use the program to recover formatted files from hard drive, there are a few precautions to keep in mind: First, before you recover your data, do not save any new files onto the formatted hard drive. </s>
<s> Second, do not install the recovery software onto the formatted drive, install it on a different disk drive or to a separate PC. </s>
<s> Third, if you are afraid of damage to the formatted drive during recovery process, you can create a disk image of the drive to pull the data from rather than directly from the disk, some of the recovery software includes disk imaging function. </s>
