<s> I have an opportunity to get a brand new in box Macbook C2D 1 gig ram 180 hard drive for my 5 mts old Macbook Pro CD 1 gig of ram, 80 hard drive. </s>
<s> Is it worth it? </s>
<s> The Pro's dedicated video should give it the boost beyond that of the non-Pro. </s>

<s> even though the macbook has the new core 2 duo chip and the pro has just core duo? </s>
<s> Look at what benchmarks there are out there. </s>
<s> I wouldn't. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I think MacBook Pro CoreDuo is still better than the MacBook Coreduo2. </s>
<s> Specially when it comes to graphics and overall performance. </s>
<s> CNET.com says that the Macbook C2D and Macbook Pro C2d have similar performance. </s>
<s> Now the Pro has a Core Duo so the Macbook c2d should have even closer performance if not equal. </s>
<s> All this applies if you don't want graphical performance. </s>
<s> Like if you edit photos or play games and stuff then I think the Pro would be better. </s>
<s> Second thing is size. </s>
<s> Which size do u prefer. </s>
<s> If both are OK then go for what is important to you. </s>
<s> Simply put if you need graphical performance then go for the Pro and if you dont then go for the Macbook. </s>
<s> i would certainly go for the Pro. </s>
