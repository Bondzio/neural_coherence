I have a cell phone that puts out wifi that i hook up to. I tried to get google maps to use my location but it kept saying unable to determine location. My phones screen is to small to see while driving the boat. Is there anyway that I can get the nook tablet to show my phones screen kind of like how you can get your computer screen to show your cells screen? If not do any tablets allow you to do this that are not extremely expensive. Also I wouldnt mind getting a tablet that would let me use my phones wifi and use google maps that would allow the my current position feature. Sorry for the long post. Thank you. if anyone has any other ideas im all ears( i live in louisiana and the marsh where i fish is not displayed well on most gps systems that is why the google earth view is so good.) thanks
