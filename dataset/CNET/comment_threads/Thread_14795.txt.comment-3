Thanks for responding.
Can you tell me how to determine what size storage drive to buy?
[I need to install the whole program, not just the data].I've tried to find the amount of space it requires by loading the program searching for details but don't see anything.
There is no specifics on the set-up disc either.
The portable storage drives advertised come in sizes of 256MB, 512MB, 1GB, etc.
[the ones over 512MB start to get a little expensive].
thanks.
