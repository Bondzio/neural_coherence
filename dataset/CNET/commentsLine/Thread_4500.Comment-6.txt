thank you for the advice.
i am planning to get a new computer, but i would rather get a newer car (7900 gtx or 1900 xtx) or even slid or crossfired cards.
anyway, if i was to upgrade my computer, which of these cards: x800, x1300, x1600 or any other agp cards you think are good should i upgrade my computer with?
