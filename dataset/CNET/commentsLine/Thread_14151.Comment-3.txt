hi.
i realize this post is nearly 1 year after the original, but i was wondering if you ever were able to resolve the issue using the same hardware?
i recently purchased the same expander and have the same issue.
in fact, at times it seems to suck the life out of the entire network.
there are times i can be 10 feet away from the expander and i won't be able to get a strong enough signal to access the internet.
i have a neighbor with a hawking range expander.
that may be my next attempt.
