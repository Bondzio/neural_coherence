stephen, a) can you swap the psu?
b) can you swap the usb cable?
c) can you remove the hdd from its enclosure?
either of the first may resolve the problem.
if neither [individually or combined] help, search the forums.
otherwise, unless wd can help, you seem to be stuck with a dead hdd, so read on: - i'm guessing that this is most probably a standard hdd housed in an enclosure with power connector, led and usb interface if this is the case, open the outer enclosure and establish whether you can extract the hdd.
if so you might be able to retrieve the data by simply installing it in your pc.
please check wd website for instructions, [based on model number on internal unit]!
good luck!
