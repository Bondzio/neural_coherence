a couple of notes on the 4400n, first i have found that the speed is certainly adequate, but i tend to get quite a few dropped connections.
i'm not 100% positive whether it is the router or the wpc4400n cards.
you will have to get n cards or as a previous respondent indicated, you will only connect at g speeds.
one security note, since you are using this in a business environment, i presume you will be using wpa-enterprise.
if so, you will want to use wzc and not linksys network monitor to configure the cards.
the reason for this is that lnm does not give you the option of validating the server certificate, and this would leave you vulnerable to a type of man in the middle attack referred to as a validation failure attack.
while this attack rather sophisticated, and is quite hard to mount, it is a concern nonetheless.
i hpe this helps.
