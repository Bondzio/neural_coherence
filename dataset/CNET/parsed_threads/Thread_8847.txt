<s> I will be using windows XP with MCE 2005 and then switching over to vista when it arrives. </s>
<s> Since i will be using my computer for watching/recording tv i want a system that doesn't make any noise. </s>
<s> Can someone here tell me whether the P4 chip or the graphics card make a lot of noise and if so is there any way to reduce it???? </s>
<s> Noise during gameplay is okay though.Only wanna keep noise down while watching/recording tv. </s>
<s> This is the first time i am building a new computer.Please let me know of any combatibility issues or what should be changed . </s>
<s> Also is it better to build or buy a media center system that can play games? </s>
<s> Also please state whether this config would be enough for vista. </s>
<s> Also does it make any difference whether i use 400 MHz or 677 MHz ram on my pc? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> I have a P4 630 3Ghz and a Leadtek 6800GS Extreme PCI-X. </s>
<s> I built the system about 2 months ago. </s>
<s> Initially I had some noise problems with this setup. </s>
<s> My computer is in my bedroom so I wanted quiet. </s>
<s> First off the 6800GS is almost silent. </s>
<s> I looked at a number of cards from different makers and chose the Leadtek because of reports that it was quiet. </s>
<s> I have to shine a flashlight at the fan to make sure its spinning. </s>
<s> The intel heatsink/fan is another story. </s>
<s> Not only is it loud, it doesn't work well. </s>
<s> I was idleing at 48C with fan cranking. </s>
<s> I tried using Arcric Silver 5 and got the temps to 41C. </s>
<s> Replaced it with a Arctic Cooler Freezer Pro 7 and realized that my 120mm case fans were really pretty quiet. </s>
<s> The high pitched fan noise disapeared with the hs/f and my temps idle at 31-33C and 45C under high load. </s>
<s> Replaced stock case fans with Aspire 120mm and now I can barely hear a humming. </s>
<s> I've got a similar setup and ScarChunk is bang on the money. </s>
<s> The Artic Freezer Pro 7 is (imo) the best after-market coolor for a P4. </s>
<s> It's cool and quiet (to steal a phrase) and cheap ($35). </s>
<s> Unless you're absolutely sold on a 6800GS, take a look at current pricing on an X850XT. </s>
<s> Both it and the 6800GS are starting at $170 on newegg. </s>
<s> But the x850XT is significantly faster out the box (no tweaking necessary). </s>
<s> It's fan is a bit noisier (but Artic makes a silencer for it also). </s>
<s> I'm running Patriot DDR2/667 at 4-4-4-12 (spd is 5-5-5-15) in one PC and GEIL DDR2/533 in another. </s>
<s> From the mem tests I've tried and the reviews I've read, name brand DDR2 with spd of 533: 4-4-4-12 will run at 667: 4-4-4-12. </s>
<s> The benchmark difference is slight at best (less than 5%). </s>
<s> So, your Corsair/Transcend should be fine at DDR2/667. </s>
<s> Don't know what your budget is, but hexus.net gave your tuner a so-so review. </s>
<s> But at the $50 price point, i 'spose that's expected. </s>
<s> OK I've got another thread going, but maybe you've had experience with both. </s>
<s> Is DDR2 running at 533Mhz with 4-4-4-12 timings any faster than DDR at 400Mhz with 2.5-3-3-7? </s>
<s> I've built a few systems, but I've never really messed with the timings. </s>
<s> I'll soon have my hands on a gig of both types and I want to get another gig to match. </s>
<s> I've read a bunch of conflicting articles, but most seem to think that unless you get DDR2 with really good timings, DDR is still the way to go. </s>
<s> Good timings + DDR2 = $$$ </s>
<s> Thank you all for helping me out! </s>
<s> Also please explain to me :- What's the AMD's equivalent( same or greater speed) of intel type 640 3.2 MHz 2 MB L2 cache processor???? </s>
<s> Also are AMD's fans noisy??? </s>
<s> ?And how many fans do i need to install in such a system(which is comparable to 3.2 MHz P4 system)??? </s>
<s> Also are AMD CPU's reliable?? </s>
<s> Will they last for say 5 yrs without any problems????? </s>
<s> And finally tell me which tuner card is better:- Pinnacle PCTV Pro or Compro Videomate Tv Gold Plus 2 ? </s>
<s> The AMD equivalent would be the Athlon 64 3200+, which costs about $160. </s>
<s> AMDs are as reliable as Intels, and they produce less heat. </s>
<s> I would get an Athlon 64 3700+ San Diego core for about $210 on newegg. </s>
<s> Get a name-brand socket 939 board, and some nice DDR400 (AMD doesn't support DDR2), and you're good to go. </s>
<s> About the TV tuners: I have no idea. </s>
<s> I had one in my PC, and I never used it. </s>
<s> When I want to watch TV, I watch it on a TV :P. </s>
