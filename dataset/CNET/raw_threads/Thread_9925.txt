I have some general computer knowledge, what parts handle what and I have a pretty good idea of where to plug them in. That being said, when buying parts I'm at a bit of a loss. I'm not sure when looking at a motherboard for instance, what I need to be looking for. I think I might could find some high performance parts, but I'm really worried about them being compatible If anyone has ideas on some good compatible parts or possibly tips as to what I could run into as far is incompatibility issues, that would be great. Thanks, Nicholas

If you don't get a combination that's been tested, you're rolling the dice. They're supposed to all work together, but we know how Murphy loves computers! Good luck.
