<s> Im looking for help with what appears to be a common yet very fatal error with my PC. </s>
<s> When I press the power button, the tower lights turn on, fans start up, but I get no post, no beeps, and of course no video. </s>
<s> Now, a week or two prior to the PC basically dieing, I was experiencing some very strange behavior from my PC which, at the time, I thought was video related. </s>
<s> While in the middle of playing a game (WoW if it matters, though Im sure it doesnt), the computer would crash, causing the image on screen to become distorted and repeat itself in rows across the monitor. </s>
<s> It looked kinda like if you tiled a small picture onto the background of your desktop. </s>
<s> Anyway this weird freeze started happening about once a day. </s>
<s> Audio would still be playing out of the speakers, but as far as the screen, I had to keep reseting the pc to get out of it. </s>
<s> After a while it started happening more and more frequently to the point where I could only be in game for a minute or two before the pc would crash. </s>
<s> Things only got worse from there. </s>
<s> This weird graphical glitch started happening outside of the game now. </s>
<s> Watching a video on youtube, for example, would cause the same error to occur. </s>
<s> After that the screen glitch would occur while simply being idle in my desktop. </s>
<s> After that, it started happening at the login screen, and once it even happened during a post. </s>
<s> Then finally, one morning when I tired to start it up, the pc refused to boot, and here I am today asking you all for help. </s>
<s> Here are my PCs Specs: Motherboard: ASUS A2N-SLI Deluxe CPU: AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core 3.0ghz PSU: Enermax 600W Noisetaker II Video Card: Geforce 6800GT x2 (SLI) RAM: 2GB Kingston Hyperx DDR2 (2 Sticks, 1gb each) I dont have a second computer to test components in, so the best I have been able to do is run some rough tests with a barebones setup outside of the case using: The psu 1 stick of ram 1 video card the cpu and heatsink fan (no new thermal compound applied yet) And ofcourse my monitor. </s>
<s> The first thing I noticed when I opened the case was that the cpu was stuck to the heatsink fan. </s>
<s> With the help of a hairdryer, I was able to ease it off. </s>
<s> I inspected the CPU and found that no pins were bent or broken; everything looked ok. (I just thought Id include that little bit on information in case it has some relevance to what the problem might be.) </s>
<s> Anyway, onto the tests: For obvious reasons, I wanted to test the video card first. </s>
<s> After basically watching any sort of graphical performance from this pc degenerate into crap, I was fairly convinced that the video card the monitor was plugged into had gone bad. </s>
<s> Besides, I had been having a lot of driver errors recently with these video cards (which I believed I had resolved), so at the time there was no doubt in my mind that one of them was the culprit. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, as I said earlier, I have no second pc to swap components with, so the best I could do was swap my lead video card (the one on top in my SLI set up) with the other one. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, this solved nothing. </s>
<s> With my second video card installed in the barebones setup, I was still getting no post, no beeps, and no video. </s>
<s> This discouraged me quite a bit. </s>
<s> Is it possible for both video cards in an SLI setup to go bad at the same time? </s>
<s> I had no clue, so for the time being I decided to test other pieces: -Swapping out my RAM with the other stick yielded no results. </s>
<s> -Removing all RAM from the setup gave me an error beepcode. </s>
<s> -Removing all video cards gave me another error beepcode. </s>
<s> -After leaving the power on for a few minutes, the cpu would get warm And so I turn to anyone willing to read this post. </s>
<s> I know its long, but I wanted to include as much information as possible, since I seriously do not know what to do next. </s>
<s> Whats the problem? </s>
<s> Is it the mobo? </s>
<s> I know mobos cause this problem a lot, but the fact that I was getting error beepcodes caused me to believe otherwise. </s>
<s> Am I wrong? </s>
<s> Is it the cpu? </s>
<s> The fact that it was basically welded onto the hsf when I first opened the case seemed a little weird, and again, I know that faulty cpus cause this problem a lot too. </s>
<s> Is it possible that a lack of thermal compound can cause barebones setup to not boot? </s>
<s> Is it the video cards? </s>
<s> Cause if you said yes Id believe you without question. </s>
<s> But the fact that neither card changed anything caused me to second guess myself. </s>
<s> Is it possible for both cards to go bad at the same time? </s>
<s> I dont know, so I have not come to a conclusion. </s>
<s> Is it something else? </s>
<s> Is this no boot problem even related to the video errors I was getting prior to it dieing? </s>
<s> Please help me out. </s>
<s> If any part of my story has yielded some sort of hint that I clearly am not seeing, please tell me. </s>
<s> It appears you've done all you can. </s>
<s> I would suggest replacing the PSU. </s>
<s> If you system wasn't cooled enough during all the time you had it, it experienced &quot;heat stress&quot; which in turn applies to all componets. </s>
<s> What gave out or became the weak link can be anything. </s>
<s> Since, you play as gamer you can drive the system to extremes and cause an earlier death. </s>
<s> In other words, it was pushed until it pushed back and failed. </s>
<s> Even if you replaced the PSU there's no guarantee it will work, though it may. </s>
<s> Many times removing parts to other system alone, they work, but once all together again, they don't as a package. </s>
<s> As for the cpu being stuck(welded), heat will cause air to be driven out and be some suction from application & dryness of the goop over time. </s>
<s> In many cases, I look at the psu or mtrbd. </s>
<s> being at fault. </s>
<s> You can google for t/s'ing guides but you did alot of what to test. </s>
<s> Of course, replacing parts is about what you can do since you don't have another system. </s>
<s> Also, return the bios setting to defaults if you tweaked them for performance setting. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply Willy. </s>
<s> I was able to test my PSU with my brother's very old PC (its the only component still compatible with his set up) and it started up fine. </s>
<s> While I am not entirely sure this was the most effective test (his PC is going on 5 years old), it proves my PSU isn't completely dead. </s>
<s> Should I just RMA my mobo and see what comes back? </s>
<s> If you can RMA after 5yrs. </s>
<s> heck go for it. </s>
<s> PSU are strange items, I often post that they lose their &quot;phuumf&quot; after awhile. </s>
<s> The other half is the mtrbd. </s>
<s> and since logic is part of the &quot;start-up ckt&quot; something a user can't fix, a replacement mtrbd. </s>
<s> may be the fix. </s>
<s> However, as I stated it can be anything or a &quot;combo&quot; of problems. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
