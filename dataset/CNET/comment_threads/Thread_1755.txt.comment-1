The on board sound on my ECS K7VTA3 Motherboard with AMD XP 200+ quit working.
I uninstalled it and disabled it in the bios and installed a Sound Blaster Audigy SE sound card.
But no sound comes out of it.
I have windows XP Pro with service pack 2.
Window shows the Sound Blaster is installed and working properly with no conflicts.
I tried a different set speakers and tried my speakers on an different computer and they work fine so I ruled out the speakers.
I have been building my own computers for 7 years and this one has me stumped.
Creative was no help nor Microsoft.
