So I recently upgraded my computer and I know for sure it meets a lot of the requirements for a lot of games, the minimum, some are maximum, but some of thse games still run slow.
I want to know why.
My computer meets the sysreq for Crysis but it only runs at 16 fps.
I have everything on low, and my resolution at 1024x768 Specs: Manufacturer: ASUSTeK Computer INC.
Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5 CPU 650 @ 3.20GHz (4 CPUs), ~3.2GHz Memory: 8192MB RAM Hard Drive: 989 GB Video Card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460 1GB GDDR5
