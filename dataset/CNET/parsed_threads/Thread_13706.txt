<s> i got a HP Pavilion zd8060us Notebook, it came with a Dual TV Tuner AVC-3610/HP, it works fine with Windows Media Center, but when i try to use the tv tuner with ANY other application (like Windows Movie Maker) a popup says &quot;the video device is currently in use. </s>
<s> Close any other application that is using the device and try again&quot;, but there is no other application using it. </s>
<s> what should i do? </s>
<s> contacted HP? </s>
<s> they told me to reinstall the tv tuner drivers an run &quot;Media Center&quot; to configure it, it works with MC but not with other program </s>
<s> It appears that a hidden service has control of the device. </s>
<s> When I called HP, they told me that they only support tv capture with Media Center. </s>
<s> I've tried every application. </s>
<s> Made sure I disabled all the services that may be running that are associated with Media Center. </s>
<s> Still it seems that Media Center is taking control of the device and is not allowing any other applications to use it. </s>
<s> Can somebody find a registry setting or command to disable Media Center entirely? </s>
<s> I have the same problem on my laptop.. </s>
<s> There is a microsoft tech note that says to disable the Microsoft Media Center Receiver service via the control panel and then reboot. </s>
<s> But even that didn't help. </s>
<s> I'm so pissed off at Microsoft right now I better not continue this message any further... Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr </s>
<s> Windows Media Center has services that are constantly running. </s>
<s> You need to right click on My Computer &gt; Click Manage &gt; then expand Services and Applications on the left &gt; click Services &gt; find 'Media Center Reciever Service' and 'Media Center Scheduler Service' and right click them and click stop for both. </s>
<s> You must start them again when your done to make sure Media Center runs properly. </s>
<s> DO NOT DISABLE THESE SERVICES, just stop them. </s>
<s> I had stated before that I disabled the services for Windows media center. </s>
<s> Yes, I stopped them first and attpemted the other applications and still get the same error. </s>
<s> It is not a Windows issue. </s>
<s> I called Adaptec. </s>
<s> They told me that HP is responsible for support and HP still insists that it is a setting or configuration error. </s>
<s> I spoke to them again today for about 2 hours before the battery ran out on my cordless. </s>
<s> It has to be a driver issue, because the device gives me the exact same error on a different PC, running plain Windows XP. </s>
<s> The driver is version 1.0 and is apparently designed to only work with Windows XP. </s>
<s> I am still trying to get this escalated through HP support. </s>
<s> The only way that there ever will be a different driver created is if enough people call there and complain. </s>
<s> HP has to order it through Adaptec (if they haven't already, because when I called Adaptec they would not provide any information on it) CALL HP and complain!!! </s>
<s> It's toll free and 24-7. </s>
<s> Having a PVR that the driver cannot handle s-video, composite or audio capture is absurd! </s>
<s> I'm so pissed off at HP right now, I'm about to break something. </s>
<s> First off, I'm sick and flippin tired of speaking to someone in Bangalore, India who barely speaks english,and insists on reading prompts from a computer screen. </s>
<s> Second off, I'm tired of hearing that EVERYTHING is a third party software support issue. </s>
<s> I just spent 1hr on the phone with HP Tech (NON) Support only to have Raja tell me he couldn't help me. </s>
<s> If anyone can solve this problem, please please please post the solution here! </s>
<s> ARRGGHHHH!!!!!!!! </s>
<s> M </s>
<s> If the product doesn't work, pack it up and start the return process. </s>
<s> It is that simple. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Sorry I can't help. </s>
<s> Just wanted you to know you are not alone. </s>
<s> Two hours of non-conversation, at my cost, with no result. </s>
<s> My letter to the CEO is in draft!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
