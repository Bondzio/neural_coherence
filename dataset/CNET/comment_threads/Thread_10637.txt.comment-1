I am looking for a work horse printer that can handle a large monthly volume that prints full sheets of labels.
When doing a search online for best label printers all the come up are specialty printers that only print single labels.
I need a standard laser printer that will print 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; sheet labels.
Most office printers and all in ones claim that labels sheets do not work well, so I guess I need a specialized printer but can not find any.
Any suggestions and recommendations would be greatly appreciated, THANK YOU!
