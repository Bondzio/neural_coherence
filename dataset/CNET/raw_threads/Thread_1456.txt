I have not succeeded in finding it. Is it, at all, possible to copy without the special software? Please help. Thank you.

Since you noted &quot;XP&quot; you must keep the boot partition under 127GB in size. I will NOT duplicate why this is but offer this link -&gt; http://www.48bitlba.com Next it's a snap to clone your 10GB to the new drive with the free software that comes with your drive, downloaded from your drives maker or even G4U copydisk (see google.) &quot;Is it, at all, possible to copy without the special software?&quot; The software I noted so far is not special.

I have downloaded the dlgsetup 11- win.zip (that is being padentic and uninformed)although the WD advises, &quot;if you want to copy all the contents of the boot disc, that is precisely what I want to do,&quot; use DOS version of Data. Should I use that instead? I would not know the results of the exercise until after the Xmas holidays. The product is a Xmas present for my grandson. Thank for your help. Shafiq
