i clean out the dust bunnies from my pc every few months.
i learned to do this many years ago when a pc i then owned kept overheating causing it to freak out and freeze up.
the dust acts as insulation, not allowing heat to dissipate from the components properly.
the fans get all dust covered and do not move enough air over heat sinks that are covered with dust and so forth.
chasing out the dust bunnies simply prolongs computer life.
