This is the ethernet version of the good old serial / parallel null modem cable. In effect the cross over connects one ethernet's out to the other's in, and vice versa. A normal ethernet cable won't work. If you connected them both to a modem (router) they can both connect to the internet, but not to each other. Network hubs are what form small LAN's for connecting computers. Plug modems, printers (but not fingers), into a hub for complete connectivity and multi-user fun and games. GeeBee.

If you do use one, go to Start - Run - then enter winipcfg and hit the enter button. Select the network card you use and it will tell you the IP address (like 10.16.0.23 or something). Go into your firewall on the other computer(s) and tell it that it is OK to allow that IP address access. Don't forget to enter the other PC(s) IP address(s) into the first PC's firewall as well. If you do use a Modem Router, they sometimes come with a built-in firewall which will protect the whole LAN.
