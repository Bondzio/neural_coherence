<s> I'd like to transfer all my old VCR tapes and 8mm tapes to DVD. </s>
<s> I'm looking to buy a new computer that can handle all that video editing can do. </s>
<s> I'm looking at an HP Pavilion a6750y. </s>
<s> Phenom 2.3gz quad core processer, 8GB od RAM, 750 GB hard drive. </s>
<s> I'll be uploading with a Pinnacle Dazzle Recorder thru a USB. </s>
<s> Will this machine let me get the job done. </s>
<s> Any suggestions?? </s>
<s> Trying to stay under $1000.00 Thanks bobmj14120 </s>
<s> And after a few tapes I declared &quot;This is nuts!&quot; I went and bought a simple 55 buck DVD recorder, connected it to my VCR, popped in the blank DVD+R, a tape, pressed play then record on the respective boxes and came back in 2 hours to retrieve the finished DVD. </s>
<s> Feel free to repeat the lesson I learned. </s>

<s> sounds like youre adding another step since youd then have to copy the dvds to your hard drive to edit them, vs capturing straight to the computer </s>
<s> i have a quad core and dazzle as well and can copy from a camcorder and play a game at the same time </s>
<s> Only those that have done such things will understand I fear. </s>
<s> When you use the computer as the capture you can count on about 4 hours of computer work for each hour of DVD video. </s>
<s> I'm sharing my lesson learned and a cheap fast economical solution. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> dazzle records to mpeg2, which is the dvd format. </s>
<s> you can either burn to dvd from the capture, or edit it </s>
<s> If you want to reply to the original poster, do that. </s>
<s> But I've BTDT and will share it's too much work. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> buy a rig with a Phenom II or Core i7 depending on your video editing software, you might be able to offload work to the graphics card, if your software does that, it would be a good investment to buy a good graphics card like a Radeon HD 48x0 or GeForce GTX 2xx </s>
