I am really confused about buying a new computer.
I am saving up for a top of the line computer and I am stuck between 4 companies, Alienware, Falcon Northwest, Dell, Voodoo.
I am leaning towards Alienware because I really like their cases(I'm a sucker for cool cases), but I have read nothing but negative things about their customer support.
I have also read that Falcon and Dell both have really good tech support.
Not sure about Voodoo's support.
Help please!
