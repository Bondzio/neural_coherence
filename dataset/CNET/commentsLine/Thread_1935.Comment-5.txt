i talked to samsung and went through and installed all new drivers and even uninstalled and reinstalled many of the drivers and it is still not working.
i have talked to many people at samsung too and they still cannot give me a straight answer about what is the problem besides that it's probably the router.
which i know it isn't since every other computer can still connect to it.
