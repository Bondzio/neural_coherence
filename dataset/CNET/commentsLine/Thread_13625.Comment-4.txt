i made my router into a wap (idk why but it took me longer than i thought), now it works, no interruptions, but i feel that now the internet is much slower than with my old router.... my only indication of this is that videos take a lot longer to load (almost double the length of the video itself).
the speed seemed to be fine just after i turned the router into a wap.
it was a few hours later that it got slow... i think i have an aura that ruins electronics...
