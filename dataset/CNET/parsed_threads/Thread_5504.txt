<s> I have the Eee PC 1005HA-PU1x for use at a second home.....browsing the net, emails, word processing...using bluetooth to connect to my blackberry. </s>
<s> Love it and works great. </s>
<s> Now thinking of getting another for just 2 purposes. </s>
<s> Checking emails and watching DVD's that I own and download(not HD)for use on plane trips and when traveling. </s>
<s> Have been using my 4&quot; Dell laptop but it is heavy and battery life is not that good. </s>
<s> My questions is can the above Eee or 1001P-PU17 handle the watching of these downloads with only 1GB memory or do I have to upgrade to 2GB? </s>
<s> Will I see any difference in quality, etc.? </s>
<s> Thanks for the help and suggestions. </s>
<s> Would consider another in the same price range, such as Samsung N210 and/or N220. </s>
<s> Or any others. </s>
<s> Thoughts? </s>

<s> They seem to like the ION video solution. </s>

<s> Good suggestion but 12&quot; screen compared to 10&quot;....I would like to stay at the 10&quot; size and weight and also about $150 more than either of the netbooks listed in the first post......since only going to be used for email - movies would like to stay in the price range of $325 - $350. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> The full screen video playback is why many look to better GPU solutions. </s>
<s> Now that you know the ION you can see what other machines have that. </s>
<s> Just so you know, this is not a shopping service. </s>
<s> Many think it is and are miffed when other members don't do the research. </s>

<s> On similar netbooks you can even play HD, eveyone says you need ion, but you can see from this video, they got HD working with a few simple solutions. </s>
<s> http://www.netbooknews.com/3562/how-to-play-hd-on-asus-1001p-video/ If you are having trouble now with your system and don't want to do a clean install (which always fixes my netbook troubles) try http://www.pcdecrapifier.com/ But for the price upgrading to 2Gb of RAM you'll see a definite improvement to your system performance. </s>
<s> With the Intel GMA 3150 this had the faster GMA. </s>
<s> The prior models with slower GMA chips still suffer. </s>
