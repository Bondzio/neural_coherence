<s> OK, my brother plugged in an external drive(a Creative Zen MicroPhoto) via USB and the computer froze. </s>
<s> He restarted it and No video output, no sound. </s>
<s> But the fans started and it sounded like the HDD also started. </s>
<s> Also everything plugged into the USB ports no longer worked and the keyboard(connected through what I am guessing is a serial port) wasn't working either (no lights were on or turning on for the caps lock,ect). </s>
<s> I did try and see if it was related to some usb problem but my phone was able to charge from the usb but nothing else seemed to be able interface with it. </s>
<s> My first thought was maybe a motherboard issue, any ideas? </s>
<s> Oh, and the computer is an HP a350n desktop running(or used to be) XP home, and its about four years old. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance Jason </s>
<s> it was the motherboard and I have to replace it or pay HP to fix it </s>
