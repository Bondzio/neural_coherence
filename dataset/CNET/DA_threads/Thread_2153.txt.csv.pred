1.1.1	I have a linux/ubuntu box I built in 2008 that does n't want to boot up now .	St
1.1.2	I took the HD out of it and put it in another box that I built a couple months ago .	St
1.1.3	It 'll boot up in that box , so I 'm assuming it 's going to be something wrong with the MOBO , or the CPU , maybe both .	St
1.1.4	Is there a way to isolate it to find out what it is ?	Ques
1.1.5	Here 's everything I have in it excluding the optical drives .	St
1.1.6	XFX MOBO , Intel Pentium D processor and a Seagate 500 GB HD .	St
1.2.1	The tech looks it over for obvious burn or scorch marks , BAD CAPS ( see google ) and sees if it powers up .	St
1.2.2	The better tech gets out the Volt meter to check the power supplies .	St
1.2.3	At that point they have found it or begin to swap out the part they suspect .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I 'm not a computer tech , I 'm an HVAC technician .	St
1.3.2	I just built these myself for my own personal use .	St
1.3.3	Thanks for the advice , I 'll check it out .	St
1.4.1	There are buckets of discussions about broken PCs and here 's the bottom line .	St
1.4.2	There is no exact process to fix a dead PC .	St
1.4.3	Sure we could take the old swap it piece by piece approach but let 's upgrade that a little .	Sug
1.4.4	1 .	St
1.4.5	Some parts are not needed to boot .	St
1.4.6	A keyboard , CD/DVD drive , and then one stick of ram .	St
1.4.7	2 .	St
1.4.8	When swapping parts and no one knows which is bad , I have advice for our techs .	St
1.4.9	Ready ?	Ques
1.4.10	It 's a wowser .	St
1.4.11	- & gt ; Change the cheapest part first .	St

1.5.1	The following describes how you can install Ubuntu onto a client machine , using just its network card to boot an Ubuntu installation image which will install Ubuntu .	St
1.5.2	The way this works , in summary is : you set up and configure bootp , tftp , dhcp , and internet gateway services .	St
1.5.3	Your client machine will 'netboot ' via its network adapter , using pxe/bootp protocol , get passed a kernel and installer via tftp .	St
1.5.4	It will boot into that kernel , which will run an installation of Ubuntu onto your client machine .	St
1.5.5	Most of the packages installed come from latest versions from the Ubuntu repositories on the internet .	St
1.5.6	Set up the servers Ensure that you have a bootp server , a tftp ( eg tftp-hpa ) server , and access to your router/gateway .	St
1.5.7	Configure the router and its dhcp server .	St
1.5.8	Get the mac address of the new machine you will be installing ubuntu onto ( the 'client machine ' ) .	St
1.5.9	It is easiest if you decide on a fixed ip address for the client machine and set it into the router , as a fixed ip address , eg 192.168.1.42 .	St
1.5.10	Note also the gateway address of the router .	St
1.5.11	Configure a bootp service on a linux host .	St
1.5.12	The same ip address as above needs to be assigned by the bootp service to the client machine .	St
1.5.13	Install bootp .	St
1.5.14	Edit /etc/bootptab .	St
1.5.15	Here is an example .	St
1.5.16	client : \ ha= & quot ; 00:00:39:2B:54 : B5 & quot ; : \ ip=192.168.1.42 : \ gw=192.168.1.1 : \ sm=255.255.255.0 : \ td=/ : hd=/ : bf=pxelinux.0 ha = the mac address of the client machine ( set this to its value ) ip = the ip address assigned in the router to the client machine gw = the address of the router sm = the subnet mask for your lan td = the directory on the tfptboot server where the pxe files reside , relative to the tftpboot server 's root .	St
1.5.17	hd = a further path which ends at either the pxe boot file or a link to it .	St
1.5.18	( this is probably ok as is ) bf = the pxe boot file ( this is probably ok as is ) For further help : man bootpd ; man bootptab and also found in the etc/bootptab file itself as comments .	St
1.5.19	If you do n't know the hardware address , or which ip address the dhcp server of the router will assign , start the client machine .	Ques
1.5.20	Make sure its bios is set to boot first from its network adapter .	St
1.5.21	You should then be able to get the hardware mac address as it attempts to boot via the network adapter .	St
1.5.22	Update /etc/bootptab on the bootp server with the client 's mac address and the ip address for it as set in the dhcp server ( eg in the router ) , then restart bootpd .	St
1.5.23	Start bootp : Here is a wrapper to start and stop bootpd from the command line .	St
1.5.24	vDaemon=bootpd vCd=/var/lib/tftpboot Start ( ) { echo -n & quot ; Starting $ vDaemon : default current directory is at $ vCd ... : & quot ; /usr/sbin/ $ vDaemon -d 4 -c $ vCd & gt ; /tmp/ $ vDaemon.log 2 & gt ; /tmp/ $ vDaemon.err & sleep 1 Status } Stop ( ) { echo & quot ; Stopping $ vDaemon ... & quot ; kill `pidof $ vDaemon` } Reload ( ) { if [ & quot ; `pidof $ vDaemon` & quot ; ] ; then echo & quot ; Reloading config file for $ vDaemon ... & quot ; kill -HUP & quot ; `pidof $ vDaemon` & quot ; fi Status } Status ( ) { vPid= & quot ; `pidof $ vDaemon` & quot ; if [ & quot ; $ vPid & quot ; ] ; then echo & quot ; $ vDaemon running , pid= $ vPid & quot ; else echo & quot ; $ vDaemon not running & quot ; fi } case & quot ; $ 1 & quot ; in start ) Start ; ; stop ) Stop ; ; reload ) Reload ; ; restart ) Stop ; sleep 2 ; Start ; ; status ) Status ; ; & quot ; & quot ; |* ) echo `basename $ 0` parameter : start stop status reload or restart ; ; esac Preparing Files for TFTP Net Booting , Section & quot ; Setting up BOOTP server & quot ; has more info on bootp , including instructions for starting bootp using the inetd alternative .	St
1.5.25	Configure the tftp server : Install tftpd-hpa .	St
1.5.26	Its config in /etc/default/tftpd-hpa should be RUN_DAEMON= & quot ; yes & quot ; OPTIONS= & quot ; -l -s /var/lib/tftpboot & quot ; The -s parameter is your tftp server file root .	St
1.5.27	Download the netboot installer tarfile from the Ubuntu Archives ( karmic , jaunty ) , and extract its contents into the tftpboot server file root as per above .	St
