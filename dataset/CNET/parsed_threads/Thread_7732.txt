<s> okay, so my very basic questions are, is it possible to connect to a modem through usb, why? </s>
<s> And why isn't it possible for me to connect to my modem directly from various computers i.e., how come changing ethernet cable to another computer wont allow internet connection(configuration problem?) </s>
<s> last ques: should wired router from modem to desktop and laptop work and what if any configuration is necessary? </s>
<s> their both xp os and just assume there arent any other notable variants </s>
<s> Of course you can connect it by using USB. </s>
<s> What do you mean by WHY? </s>
<s> .. because it can?? </s>
<s> Because when you connected DIRECTLY to the modem, your provider will detect and keep your MAC ADDRESS least for atleast 1 day. </s>
<s> That is why you can just connect diffrent computer as you wish... you will have to wait for the IP Address lease expired... OR you can call your provider to reset it. </s>
<s> -- (Although it say 1 day (24hrs), usually it will reset after 15 - 30 minutes.) </s>
<s> Wired or Wireless ROUTER will work with all computer... and of course there are a configuration needed. </s>
<s> And this is the way to connect many computer to single Internet connection, HINT: Sharing.. </s>
