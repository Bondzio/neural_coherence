the two dsl modems of your office neighbor are on separate phone lines.
as such, it is not two simultaneous connections as with cable where you can just keep adding modems to every cable outlet in the house until the cableco's billing system maxes out on the number of modem mac address they are willing to let you pay for.
dsl is a point-to-point dedicated connection, not shared.
the &quot;modem&quot; is only a bridge.
some newer models add nat and dhcp routing functionality to ease customer networking of multiple local client systems (but, interestly, typically fail to provide more than one ethernet port so the customer must still byo switching, though some of the latest models include a wireless access point).
however, the dslam at the telco end can't support more than one bridge per circuit.
my point was that it isn't simply a piggish business practice of the provider or a service degradation borne of dividing the bandwidth, but it is technically infeasible because afaik dsl doesn't work that way (or at least the typical current commercial implementations of it can't do that).
if the op has two phone lines, sure sign up for a second dsl account on line 2 and put that one upstairs.
but i have a feeling that wasn't what he had in mind.
