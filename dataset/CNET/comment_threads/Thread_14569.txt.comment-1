I am using ME.
I installed a v2 usb pci card.
I installed IVT BlueSoleil software.
I installed a generic bluetooth dongle.
I paired it with a motorola HS850 headset.
It connects, but I can't get any volume in or out.
Does anyone have ideas about why this is happening, and if there is something I can do about this?
Thanks kzolady
