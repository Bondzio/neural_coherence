<s> I recently acquired a PDA phone, model O2XdaIIs with wi fi function. </s>
<s> It picks up wireless signals and connects well at hotspot areas, but so far I have not been able to connect at home. </s>
<s> The error states as &quot;unable to obtain a server assigned IP address. </s>
<s> Try again or enter an IP address in network settings&quot; Is this related to the wireless router settings? </s>
<s> please advise. </s>
<s> Hopefully your wireless router at home is properly secured. </s>
<s> If so, you have just learned why it should be - so passers-by with unknown new devices can't just walk right in to your network. </s>
<s> so...have you configured the router to safely interact with your new wireless device? </s>
<s> That will also require you to properly configure your new wireless device to match the security requirements of your wireless router. </s>
