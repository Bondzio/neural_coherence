the first one was a 22a rail or about 262 watts per rail on a good day, new and at 15c.
that's a recipe for a future or nearly immediate meltdown (man or machine is debatable!)
i'd like the 800w but i don't see the rest of the machine so for most setups save those where folk put in 2 cards or a dozen drives, this should be fine for years.
