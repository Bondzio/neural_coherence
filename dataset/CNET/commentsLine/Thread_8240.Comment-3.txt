i dont know if the dead processor would hurt it or not, but if you find a local computer shop, preferably one family owned and operated rather than best buy or circuit city, they will test the processor for you for about $10 and they will do a full inspection to insure its in perfect condition.
its a shame to have to spend the money but then at least you will know black and white if its good or not.
