Windows 7 Using a WD My Book Essentials external HD & I'm trying to access my photos on it.
Trouble is, when I see the thumbnails, they've all got this generic picture on them & clicking on them gets me this pop up message telling me I don't have the correct permissions to access this file location.
How do I fix/ change this?
