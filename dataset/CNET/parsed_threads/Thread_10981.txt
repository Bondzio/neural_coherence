<s> Hi I want to buy a portable hard drive (2.5&quot; inch external with casing). </s>
<s> 250 GB seems appropriate capacity for me. </s>
<s> I have used two portable hard drives (Hitachi Travelstar, 80GB and 160GB, bought without enclosure and fixed into one later). </s>
<s> Both of them seem to be working fine still. </s>
<s> One for about 2 years and another one for 8 months. </s>
<s> Now I am not too sure which company to rely on. </s>
<s> Hitachi don't make drives like WD and others which come packed into the casing. </s>
<s> Is it a better idea to buy a hard drive and its enclosure separately ? </s>
<s> OR the ones (that come with enclosures) sold by manufacturers are 'more' reliable? </s>
<s> I am looking at Toshiba, WD, LaCie, Iomega. </s>
<s> Not too sure which one to go with. </s>
<s> Any advice or personal experiences will be really helpful. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> It seems like there is no specific answer to my question . </s>
<s> But maybe some suggestions? </s>
<s> Still waiting... </s>
<s> my suggestion would be to get a complete unit. </s>
<s> This way you know the thing works or don't work. </s>
<s> If it doesn't work then just return it; no decession as to which part of the unit is bad. </s>
<s> Personally I always build mine (3.5&quot;) and I have used maxtor, WD, etc. </s>
<s> which ever give me the best bargain. </s>
<s> I found these thing are fairly reliable. </s>
<s> Just my thought. </s>
<s> Its quite small, about lets say a notebook. </s>
<s> Only choice because &quot;Costco is cheaper&quot; is what my parents say but in the end I choosed between 150 and 250. </s>
<s> Pros: -Comes with WD syn -Small -From 60-250GB Cons: -The wire is small I got mine around 90$ to back up my dad's music one day when the music was missing due to system recovery long time ago. </s>
<s> Thanks for the replies. </s>
<s> I will get a WD Passport soon. </s>
<s> I guess there are not many options. </s>
<s> Plenty of info on hard disk drives external and otherwise already here in the STORAGE FORUM. </s>
<s> Here's some info from a CNST STORAGE POLL. </s>
