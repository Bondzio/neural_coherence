<s> How does having a dual core CPU help? </s>
<s> I look at them on Newegg and they don't have any higher speeds than the other ones... At least not that I saw. </s>
<s> Some were only 2.0ghz. </s>
<s> So... What's so great about it? </s>
<s> processors that work with each other [with properly written software]. </s>
<s> Seems obvious that two working on different parts of the problem at the same time and then putting them together with the answer pays off. </s>
<s> The idea that the clock speed of the CPU equaled performance was false has been proved for a few years by the AMD CPU's out performing Intel CPU's that ran at much higher speeds. </s>
<s> It got so bad that Intel about 8 months ago ceased including the clock speed as part of their CPU model number. </s>
<s> The generation of Intell CPU's just now hatching will run at lower clock speeds but perform as well. </s>
<s> The biggest problem with clock speed is that it causes the CPU to get extremely hot. </s>
<s> Intel's CPU's got over a hundred watts, thus when they decided to go to Dual Core they couldn't use the top speed ones in Dual because they simply couldn't cool them. </s>
<s> It is the total architecture of the design of a CPU, its chipset and cache that determine performance. </s>
<s> I figured that was the case, but I was just making sure. </s>
<s> So basically, like the AMD CPU's, the can do more in one clock rotation than could regular Intel CPU's. </s>
<s> Would you recommend Intel or AMD Dual core? </s>
<s> they have better communication between the two CPU's by far. </s>
<s> HOWEVER the situation is so dynamic and Intel is a far biger company than AMD, yopu can be sure that they will very shortly have equal or better. </s>
<s> By putting the MCH [Memory Controller Hub] inside the CPU [a great idea] AMD unfortunately locked themselves into DDR memory. </s>
<s> Thus they are frantically working on a new set of CPUs that will support DDR2 and possiblly something newer, [they just signed an agreement with another memory developer]. </s>
<s> Thus it will be a different socket type and thus a different mobo. </s>
<s> One shouldn't make a decision until they have money in hand and ready to place the order. </s>
<s> Then on that day you buy the greatest and a month later it is the old slow one. </s>
<s> LOL Keep up by going to http://www.tomshardware.com and http://www.anandtech.com [as well as others] and read the test that they present regarding such things. </s>
<s> Fantastic source of current info. </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
