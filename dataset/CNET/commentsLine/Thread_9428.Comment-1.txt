i am unable to make up my mind whether i should buy a computer right now or wait a little bit longer so that i may get a better and more advanced computer.
it's been over 5 yrs.
since i bought my last one.i have a 667 mhz , 64 mb ram computer with integrated graphics which still works okay but cannot play games older than quake 3. anyone in here got any idea of the things to come:- i mean the advancements taking place in processors, ram , graphics ,etc.?
if so please tell me about it!!!
i don't wanna buy a computer that gets obsolete in a yr. or two.
