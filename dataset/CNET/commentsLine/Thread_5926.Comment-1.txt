i have four ide drives.
a cd-rom drive, dvd rw, zip drive, and a hard disk drive.
the motherboard is a pc chips t18 intel 915p.
it has three ide slots.
if i plug two into my first it will recognize the two drives.
however, the other two will not recognize anything.
the instruction manuel says those two are optional, but nothing in the cmos setup will get me going with them.
can someone help me, please?
