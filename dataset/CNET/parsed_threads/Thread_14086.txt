<s> I want to upgrade to a larger hard drive, I did this a while back and when I did It was a nightmare because I had to reload all items, lost my emails and everthing. </s>
<s> Is there a &quot;wizard program&quot; to migrate to a new hard drive? </s>
<s> Any and all advice taken, serious. </s>
<s> Check this thread for info on transferring files to the new drive. </s>

<s> Utilities exist that will transfer, intact, an entire partition from one drive to another. </s>
<s> There are some limitations as far as partition resizing but they can usually be expanded quite a bit. </s>
<s> Two I know are Symantec Ghost and Drive Image (was from PowerQuest but now owned by Symantec as well). </s>
<s> I use Drive Image and have no experience with Ghost. </s>
<s> It will make compressed partition images or, as mentioned, copy and resize entire partitions. </s>
<s> The original drive needs to be fairly free of problems, however. </s>
<s> As well, any existing problems on your drive such as spyware, viri and such will transfer nicely too. </s>
<s> If using XP, this is a hardware change and might cause the need to reactivate. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
