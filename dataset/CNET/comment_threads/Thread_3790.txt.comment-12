I run Windows XP home.
I believe it came with 98 installed and another person upgraded the system to XP for me.
That person has moved elsewhere and I don't know where he lives.
My ABS did work with the XP and after it got infected with spyware, I didn't know what to do.
Somehow at first my computer worked fine.
It was able to boot regularly but I couldn't use my usb mouse or my ps/2 mouse.
I played around in setup and my computer couldn't boot.
It kept saying Pri Slave HDD error and it keeps asking me to insert a floppy and this is where I am now.
