1.1.1	My mother wants a tablet for Christmas and is leaning towards the Ipad.	St
1.1.2	But I am not really sure if the Ipad is the right one for her (aka it's kind of expensive).	St
1.1.3	The main reason she wants it is to play 'Words With Friends' when she is waiting at the doctors' office.	St
1.1.4	At the moment, she plans on relying on wi-fi and not getting a cellular plan for it.	St
1.1.5	Also, she would properly like to play her pogo.com games and read her kindle books on it.	St
1.1.6	Her eyes are not the greatest so it needs to be at least the size of the kindle.	St
1.1.7	So, what do you'll think is the Ipad the right one for her?	St
1.2.1	When you went with Pogo my mind said no go.	St
1.2.2	I doubt the iPad would work with that site.	St
1.2.3	To get that working you are looking at the old Windows 7 tablets.	St
1.2.4	I pulled up my Kindle Fire HD (starts at 199 bucks) and Words With Friends is available from the Amazon store so that's a go go.	St
1.2.5	If we dismiss the mess of Pogo I think we get a two out of three with the KF HD.	St
