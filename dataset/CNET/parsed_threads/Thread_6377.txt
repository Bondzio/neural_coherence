<s> I am trying to buy a new PC and wanted to know which is a better video card nVidia GeForce 8300GS 128MB ATI Radeon HD 2400 PRO 128MB Which one of these is the best and give best picture. </s>
<s> Thanks very much </s>
<s> i believe nVidia is currently slightly ahead of ATI in the graphics department at the moment. </s>
<s> I haven't seen the 8300 benchtested. </s>
<s> Toms hardware tested the HD2400 Pro, and rank it a couple notches higher than the 8400 GS, and just a notch below the 8500 GT. </s>
<s> They're both mid/low range graphics cards, good for basic use + light gaming. </s>
