1.4.1	Depends on the seller ( not always ) to provide that when the & quot ; maker & quot ; usually does .	St
1.4.2	What a seller may provide is a link to specs or maker 's own support .	St
1.4.3	There is only so much room for info and most sellers provide the basics .	St
1.4.4	If you ever want a specific need or want direct data , then go to the source , the maker .	St
1.4.5	AND yeah sometimes it does n't make sense to the uninformed or those lacking knowledge on the latest developments until MUCH later explained in common lingo .	St

1.4.7	Even I as an informed tech and such , get hosed because so much is being tossed out there .	St

1.5.3	I get a number close to 512 .	St
1.5.4	What do you get ?	Ques
1.5.5	Good question but since the spec sheet lets us figure it out , should we expect folk to know how to do this if they are in this deep with PCs ?	Ques
1.5.6	Bob	St
1.6.1	I read an article online the day before that the earlier AF drives are needed an Align software , but the latest ones are automatically aligned .	St
1.6.2	Few months ago , I installed XP to a 6G/s 2T drive which I did not know it is an AF drive then , but somehow , It has not caused any problem so far .	St
