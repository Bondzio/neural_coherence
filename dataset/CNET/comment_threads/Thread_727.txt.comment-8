Well, then he is right.
Just wondering: Is this for a server or something?
Because I've only seen one setup with more than 1 physical CPU, and its a server running four Xeon's at 3.0GHz which is alot of processing power.
If you want power, and save a butload of money, just upgrade this one.
In todays Programs and Applications it is almost always overkill to add a whole new Processor, and the money is big, I mean new motherboard, new CPU, it adds up.
