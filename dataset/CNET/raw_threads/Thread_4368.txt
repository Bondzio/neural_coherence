I once had it fully loaded with 4 fans (Top exaust, front intake, side intake and rear exast) but it got a little noisey for me... ANyways, I am currently using a Hyper 212+ as my cpu cooler of choice, and was just curious is a top, rear exaust fan would be of any benefit. I once had one in before I upgraded to the Hyper 212+ but thought that it would mess up the airflow from the coolers fan to the exaust fan since its pulling up while those two are pushing back Any ideas would be appreciated. Thx

If little or no change...leave the top disconnected and try the same with the side fan. You might also consider quieter fans ot larger fans that rotate at lower RPMs. Let us know. VAPCMD

I just thought if I could improve them any more, why not go the extra step sort of thing. Also, there is a bunch of small punch outs at the top for the fans to pull air/exaust out of... Would it be wise to completely block those off? I read somewhere that having those holes punched at the top can screw with the way the air circulates. Im trying to get any tips or suggestions now so when I re-assemble the computer I wont have to go back in and potentially have something else break unexpectedly on me

With decent active airflow and a good CPU HS Fan...you should be good to go. You can get always leave the other existing fan installed bu unconnected and if necessary you always change to bigger lower RPM fans or better quieter fans. Let us know how it works out. VAPCMD

In his opinion he thinks that what I have now is perfect and the top doesnt need anything extra because the heat already rises out of the case and installing a top exaust may screw up the exaust areas air dynamics where the cpu cooler is spitting air out the back
