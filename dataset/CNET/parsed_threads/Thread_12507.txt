<s> Very simple for some one who knows ..we live in newcastle and my wife would like to listen to sydney am radio and I am thinking I may be able to stream it in via a tablet? </s>
<s> I can do it on my desktop but am not computer savy enough to know if a tablet is the same </s>
<s> Last week we had a member here who needed Flash to listen to his favorite stations. </s>
<s> And neither iPad's not (most) Android laptops support that. </s>
<s> And, of course, don't have a very good speakers. </s>
<s> So you should use either a headphone/earbuds or external speakers. </s>
<s> But for those external speakers the tablet should have a connection. </s>
<s> And, of course, it should have WiFi, so it can connect to your wireless router. </s>
<s> So you've got some nice selection criteria, when you visit a shop: - must have WiFi - must be able to use external speakers - must be able to play that specific radio channel Let the sales person show that it work, before you buy it! </s>
