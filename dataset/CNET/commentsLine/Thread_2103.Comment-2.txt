anything ... it depends on use, handling, quality, etc., if you insert them and remove them constantly .... quality and durability really count.
if you leave them in place but power off the drives when not in use, that reduces wear and tear on the device connectors.
good quality frames and removable drive trays should last a good long time and serve you well with careful use and handling.
