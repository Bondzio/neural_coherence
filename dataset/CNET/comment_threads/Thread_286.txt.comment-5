Bob: Thanks for your reply, I did also try that yesterday and it was taking forever about an hour 1/2 waiting and I finally got to chat with someone he ended up wanting me to chat with him thru another computer so we could look into the Bios.
I didnt have another computer so that was kind of a fail.
Guess I need to borrow someones laptop and attempt it again.
I might take a look at what you suggested about installing in order, I was unaware of that.
This is a shot in the dark but, a relative has the same exact computer as mine.
What if I was to make a set of restore cd's and tried to load them into my computer using my XP serial number??
Maybe?
?
