1.1.1	I have a 160GB SimpleTech SimpleDrive USB 2 External Hard drive .	St
1.1.2	It 's been working fine for several months , and now all of sudden its giving me problems .	St
1.1.3	I can see all the files on the hard drive , and can delete them occasionally , but anytime I try to copy or access the files windows slows to a complete stop and nothing happens until I pull the plug .	St
1.1.4	I 've tried 4 different USB cables , I 've tried plugging it into a different computer , and nothing has worked .	St
1.1.5	I 've tried defragging the hard drive several times , I 've run chkdsk a bunch of times , and everything comes out normal .	St
1.1.6	I 've tried running chkdsk in deepscan mode , but then it just tells me that for a bunch of files it does n't have the space to replace the bad sectors , even though it has about 20GB free .	St
1.1.7	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.2.1	Start by getting the files you ca n't lose off this failing drive .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	I keep trying to copy it off but usually it just goes to the copy bar , says some crazy high number like 130 minutes , and then fails altogether and the windows goes all & quot ; not responding & quot ; .	St
1.3.2	Every once in a while i can get a file off , but almost never .	St
1.4.1	Then the next one .	St
1.4.2	When you go those off the drive , ask for a replacement drive .	St
1.4.3	You could also remove the drive from the enclosure and hook it up directly inside a PC ?	Ques
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	I ca n't even get that far .	St
1.5.2	And every time i run checkdisk it just give me lots of errors like this : The disk does not have enough space to replace bad clusters detected in file 3248 of name \Music\Artists\PHANTO~1\PH0781~1.WMA .	St
1.5.3	Anything I can do to fix that ?	Ques
1.5.4	I still have 20 GB free space on the drive .	St
1.5.5	Is it fixing the problem ?	Ques
1.6.1	This is disaster and file recovery time then we wipe the drive clean start again .	St
1.6.2	I 've run into corrupt volumes that chkdsk never could repair .	St
1.6.3	Look up PC FILE INSPECTOR as well , but stop writing to the drive since it usually makes it worse for getting the files out .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
