1.1.1	I have a Microtek Scanmaker E3 flatbed scanner that is several years old ( guess 5 or 6 years - predates USB scanners ) .	St
1.1.2	I have tried Omni Form Filler and I just got ScanSoft 's Paper Port 10 .	St
1.1.3	Neither program will copy forms correctly that are lined .	St
1.1.4	I also have Omni Pro and Pagis and have very few problems scanning plain text documents with them , so I know the scanner works OK .	St
1.1.5	When I copy a form with lines , sometime I get the form just as formatted but no lines and sometime I just get the form that was a page full of text and lines reproduced as just the text squeezed into a paragraph at the top of the page , with all the lines gone .	St
1.1.6	So I wonder , is it the scanner or the software ?	Ques
1.1.7	I just bought Page Port 10 and still have a few days left on the return guarantee .	St
1.1.8	Is there better software out there or should I be looking at a better scanner ?	Ques
1.2.1	If the scanner scans to a image file or copies to the printer ok , then its a software issue .	St
1.2.2	Just sharing that I 've yet to see any consumer grade form filler software that everyone likes .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
