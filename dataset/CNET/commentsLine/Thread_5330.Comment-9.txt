i forgot that part.
never saw a ups with all plugs being battery-protected.
i'll take your word since you are looking at it.
that being said, sgt brought up an important issue.
did you run the set-up program that came with ups?
unless you did, the computer is not tied to the ups and will act as it has.
good luck.
