1.1.1	I have physical access to a network printer working fine on a network but when I add my notebook to a cat5 connection and try to find the printer it cant.	St
1.1.2	When I check other workstations control panel printer is &quot;IBM 1145 on MYSERVER01&quot; and I even have a printer name (&quot;LXK485DC8&quot;) and an IP address but nothing helps find it in the printer find window after selecting the server name to find.	St
1.1.3	Other info states I need to specify (e.g.	St
1.1.4	&quot;server.host1.printer/LXK485DC8&quot;) but that doesnt work either.	St
1.1.5	I also try searching under the share name &quot;IBM1145&quot; and that doesnt work.	St
1.1.6	Again, I have printed the printers network configuration info.	St
1.1.7	and have access to printer setup GUI from the notebook but dont know how else to setup.	St
1.2.1	The reason it can't find it is simple.	St
1.2.2	It can't resolve the name.	Sug
1.2.3	Ask your IT staffer to check if the DNS has this entry.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I simply created a port with identical information (ip, name, etc) to the functioning workstations, extracted the oem drivers to a directory, created a dummy printer then changed its port to the new one and did a &quot;driver update&quot; to the driver directory.	St
1.3.2	I realize this has to be the most hassel-filled way to do it but it worked fine.	St
1.3.3	BTW, on printer, a DNS address was specified but enable DHCP was unchecked...may mean nothing.	St
1.3.4	Thanks again	St
1.4.1	Only those grizzly IT staff use assigned addresses today.	St
1.4.2	Have the IT staffer show you the DNS record (I use NSLOOKUP) for server.host1.printer.	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
