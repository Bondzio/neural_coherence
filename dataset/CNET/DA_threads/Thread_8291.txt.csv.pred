1.1.1	Well , I 'm back looking for more help .	St
1.1.2	My original problem is detailed in the thread referenced here - http : //reviews.cnet.com/5208-7813-0.html ? forumID=26 & threadID=110288 & messageID=1253394 After finally getting the system working right , my daughter used the drive as a CD-ROM for several days and everything seemed fine .	St
1.1.3	Then , she tried to burn a CD to play on her CD player .	St
1.1.4	Using Nero , the process seemed to go well .	St
1.1.5	However , when she tried to play the CD on her CD player , it would not work .	St
1.1.6	I told her that she probably did n't finalize the disk and to do so or just burn another one and be sure that finalize is selected .	St
1.1.7	Instead of doing that , she tried to burn with Windows Media Player .	St
1.1.8	The PC got hung up and when she rebooted , the problem of the missing drive returned !	St
1.1.9	I 've tried deleting the upperfilters and lowerfilters in the registry .	St
1.1.10	No effect .	St
1.1.11	The drive does show in BIOS , but not in My Computer , Windows Explorer , etc .	St
1.1.12	Any help would be appreciated .	Polite
1.1.13	By the way , also ca n't boot into safe mode .	St
1.1.14	I 've looked at the forums a little and this too seems to be associated with Nero software .	St
1.1.15	Is it possible that I should delete all Nero software and use something else ?	Ques
1.2.1	Since the drive shows in bios , go to Device Manager check the status there .	St
1.2.2	If it shows there , uninstall the drive , reboot and let Windows reinstall .	St
1.2.3	I 've had similar experience with a micro advantage cdrw drive .	St
1.2.4	I had to install about six times , but finally got it .	St
1.2.5	It 's been working for two years now without problems .	St
1.2.6	Best of Luck	St
1.3.1	Neglected to mention that it does not show up in the Device Manager either .	St
1.3.2	BIOS is the only place that there is any evidence of a drive .	St
1.4.1	I would go back to the beginning to retrace the steps taken , including Bob 's post of deleting filters from the registry .	St
1.4.2	Also double check or reset the jumper settings .	St
1.4.3	If it were me , I would try the cable select setting .	St
1.4.4	It ca n't hurt anything .	St
1.4.5	If all fails , I suspect the drive is bad .	St
1.4.6	Install it in another machine to see how it reacts .	St
1.4.7	Best of Luck	St
