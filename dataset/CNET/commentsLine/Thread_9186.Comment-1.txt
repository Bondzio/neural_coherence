can anybody tell me the maxium memory i can put in balance \ ecs a535 notebook?
from the best i understand it only has one slot for upgrading and when i go to sites to purchase for that model it only gives me options of 512mb and under?
it runs so slow and was hoping to put a 1024 in it.
is that even possible?
