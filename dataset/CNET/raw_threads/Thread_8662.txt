8336	0	320914	2930614	NR	rmdial	12/17/08 6:37 PM	1.22953902E12	Slow page scrolling	Home built PC w/Asus P5GPL-X-SE MB, Intel P43.2 GHz Processor, 2 gig RAM, XP w/SP3, GeForce 8500 GT 1 gig(Driver 178.13) Video card, PCI Express. Display set at 1680 X 1050 as suggested. Recently added the video card along with a new pwr supply (750 watt) and a 20 inch Viewsonic monitor. Since I have added new hardware scrolling pages takes a long time. If I use my mouse wheel it does not react immediately and, in fact, takes a while to scroll. Very frustrating. Suggestions on what is causing this greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. Soapy

I have not tried adjusting the mouse but I do not think that is it since it does the same hesitation when I use the up and down arrows on the keyboard. I will try though. Thanks again to both of you for the suggestion. Soapy
