Since I'm over 60 and thinking this may be my last complete computer purchase I was wondering how I did having this one built? There were many variables taken into consideration on deciding where,when,cost,hardware,software etc.. The use is mainly for gaming(old folks style) and online. Current games Crysis,Red Alert3,Call of Duty 4 and World at War.

Use a solid state drive for swap. Make /etc /bin /usr /shar /sbin read only. Put those also on a solid state drive. Use a hard disk for /var /tmp /home /root. Set other directories according to use: /sys should be ro /service should be rw. Encrypt the partitions on the hard disk. Use a minimalized desktop if you are planning on doing a lot of encoding, rendering, or providing services. You won't need an anti-virus. You will need to tune SELinux or the runlevels- depends if you are using Linux or BSD. VirtualBox or Xen for emulation. You can play games.
