I have a 500 gig Seagate hard drive (SATA) that is no longer working as an external (broken bus ).
I'm considering using it as extra storage space.
I have 2 IDE drives that I'm using as master and slave.
I run Windows XP.
My question is: Can I use the SATA as storage and keep the IDE as my boot drive?
