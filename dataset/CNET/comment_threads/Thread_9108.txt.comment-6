OK, just in case any other poor sod is reading this, there would appear to be quite different inverter boards in what appears to be the same monitor...
I followed a trail of links from this thread, and eventually found somebody else with the same inverter power board as me no toroidal coils etc, but some big caps, which had ballooned a bit at the top.
He replace them and pronounced it fine one of mine was the same, so I've replaced the lot it's fine so far!
Woo-hoo!!!
Now all I need is a cheap replacement screen for a Packard-Bell C3300 notebook which somebody sat on...
