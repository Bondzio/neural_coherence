Custom built or off the shelf, they all have basically the same connections to the system board and drives. Pull the supply and take it to a good computer store. Reason being so you can match the leads with what is available. They are all generally the same, just do this to make sure. A good supply of 300 or more watts is around fifty bucks. My next concern would be that the failure may have caused spikes toward the system board. The only way to test this is to install the new supply and try a boot. If it fails, the board is probably toast, or a component like the processor, memory, or one of the drives. If this is the case it's time for a new PC.

An older computer like yours might have a different type of power supply than most of the newer systems. Check the cords inside the computer that plug into the Motherboard. If there are two connecters side by side, then You have what is called an AT Power supply, If it is One solid connector it is an ATX power supply. Those designations relate to the type of case by the way. Another quick way to tell is if you have audio, modem, Printer, and serial connectors built into the motherboard. If there are several of those built right into the motherboard it is probably an ATX motherboard which means you have an ATX power supply, but still check the connectors. AT is the older type and will be harder to find, I would also find someone who knows something about computers to hook it up for you since it can go in the wrong way. If it is ATX then just buy one and hook it up, make sure its in the right direction, but that shouldn't be an issue. Then you just hope the old one didn't fry anything else when it. went.

Some name brands have a non standard ps size, like some Emachines have a small 120 watt supply and there are a few others like that. So you will have to do some fact finding to get the correct one. Hopefully the other parts are ok, but the only way to find out is get a new ps and see what happnes. John
