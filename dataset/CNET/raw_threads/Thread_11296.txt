5645	0	349012	3076473	NR	Coryphaeus	7/8/09 5:01 AM	1.24702926E12	Is my printer dead?	Canon i455 a few years old. Was connected to my PC and shared across my network. A few months ago I got a NAS and connected the printer there, still shared, worked perfectly (didn't have to turn my PC on for others to print). Tried to print a text file this morning, no text. Print head moved but no black ink (yes, new cartridge). Did a nozzle check and all colors and black printed. Tried text file again, everything moved but no text. Moved the printer back to my PC and did a nozzle check. All OK. Tried to print the document, no text. Created a document in Word, same-same. Changed the color of the text to blue and voila! So, it's not printing black. All printer tests work but no black on any document. Time for a new printer?

Especially, if this is a refilled ink cart or generic type. Newer inkjets use all ink to print its output its really not black unless you have &quot;mono output&quot; selection. They do this so all inkjets get used and not become clogged due to non-use. I exclude any possible electronics issue here or introduced s/w glitch. I would suggest you do an alignment, etc test and check results, etc.. if fails or never corrects then replace printer. Its probably the cheapest fix, when new ink carts become involved. You could try this printer on an entirely different system that never had it and install it to test. If you buy new printer look into similar model or Canon that uses same ink carts to help in that area. tada -----Willy

I do not use recycled/generic/refilled cartridges, only Canon fresh out of the box. I'll install it on my laptop and see what happens.

Installed it on the laptop, and after a few times of going through the tests and checks, I looked at the levels. DUH!! These levels do not show up correctly when connected to the NAS. Put a new cartridge in and voila! The NAS is nice but it will not display the printer monitor.

Remember the &quot;ink monitoring pgm.&quot; is nothing more than estimate or approx. of ink level. Defeating or ignoring the new ink cart install(align.) starts sometimes this issue and/or get out of whack and keeps wanting attention. Even if not displayed, it has become a sore spot. I wish the times i could carry another system with me on calls as laptop sits at home. tada -----Willy
