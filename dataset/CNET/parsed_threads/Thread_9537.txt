<s> I am running an emachines 1840 desktop PC pre loaded with Windows 7, a 500GB HDD &amp; 64bit Dual Core Processor &amp; 3GB of Ram, it is also fitted with an aftermarket ASUS 5054 1GB Graphics Card, the onboard Graphics card Couldn't even cope with some of the supplied games!!! </s>
<s> The system will not run MS FLT SIM X Deluxe or any other Flt Sims I have, even in compatability mode, So I wouild like to know if I can fit my old 160 GB HDD from my previous PC (a Maxdata 3000 Mob Favorit) as a slave, or to be able to boot-up from, That has XP Home Edition, loaded &amp; all My Flt Sims but was only a 32 bit system, &lt;div&gt; I bought the emachines 1840 in January 2011 &amp; it has been returned twice due to faulty HDD's ? </s>

<s> If both of the HDD's are SATA, you don't need to worry about the master/slave relationship, because SATA doesn't use them. </s>
<s> If one is SATA and the other is IDE, you still shouldn't have to worry about it. </s>
<s> As far as using it as a boot drive, ideally it would pop up after the POST to give you the option of which OS you wanted to boot up. </s>
<s> If not, you should be able to choose in the BIOS which drive you wanted to boot from. </s>
<s> Thank you, for your advice, It is very much appreciated. </s>
