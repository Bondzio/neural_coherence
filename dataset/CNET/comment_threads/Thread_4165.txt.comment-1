Greetings, I have a Dell Latitude E5510 running Windows 7 64bit.
Lately the cursor has been jumping while I type.
It doesn't matter if I am in email or Word or Firefox.
I ran Maleware bytes and virus check to see if I picked up any thing, both were clean.
Any ideas what is causing this or how to fix it?
Paul
