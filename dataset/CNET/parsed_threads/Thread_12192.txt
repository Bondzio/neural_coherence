<s> Greetings, I'm looking for a solution, basically the requirement is to have a monitor of some sort, displaying basic info on the wall, that changes about once a day. </s>
<s> I.E. </s>
<s> 0800 - Meeting in Conference Room 1000 - Video Teleconference 1130 - Some sort of activity 1300 - So on and so fourth This information would need to be easily editable and displayed on a monitor mounted on the wall. </s>
<s> I am trying to keep it from being attached to a stand alone computer if at all possible, however if that is the only way to do it then so be it. </s>
<s> What would be ideal is to have a connection on the monitor that you can either Serial Port, or IP address in and change what it displays on the fly, and have a weeks worth of data displayable in one form or another, possibly with controls on the front of the monitor to be able to flip days. </s>
<s> Smaller: digital picture frames Update with a flash memory card or even wireless. </s>
<s> Larger: information kiosk Can be expensive, but I have no idea what your budget is. </s>
