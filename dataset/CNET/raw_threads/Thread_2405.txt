I've posted this question over in CNET forum: Home Audio & Video and on AVSforum, but I should try here also. I own a Defender surveillance DVR SN500 4ch. It comes with a basic corded usb optical mouse for on-screen navigation. I've tried using a Logitech 2.4g/nano receiver wireless mouse for remote use but it didn't seem to work after setup. A Defender-USA representative wasn't sure of a wireless mouse that would work with the DVR. So, just wondering if anyone here knows of a wireless mouse that works with these types of DVRs ? j-vtol

Annoying but have you noticed DVRs are only just getting into VGA output when PCs have moved on to DVI, HDMI and DisplayPort? These guys are a century (ok, decade) behind the curve.

The ones I deal with are linux based and only a few USB mice are supported. THESE ARE MADE FOR PRICE and to get your price points you can't support many mice. It's also not a PC so anyone that calls it stone age may be out of touch with this market. Ok, there is one idea here. Did you try a wireless remote mouse like http://www.amazon.com/Wireless-USB-Remote-Control-Mouse/dp/B001M56DI0 Given the nature of these systems that's what I would try. Bob
