had the same problem with mine.
having done a bit of research it seems the esata connection on the drive is a bit problematic.
i found that if i push the esata cable firmly into the socket it will work, but as soon as i let go it does not.
unfortunately i haven't found a solution yet, i will be trying a new cable soon.
other users have trimmed the plastic on the cable connector so it will go further into the socket, i may try that as well.
