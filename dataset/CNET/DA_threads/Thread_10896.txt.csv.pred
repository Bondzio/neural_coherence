1.1.1	Want to build a moderate priced system to use for graphic art work .	St
1.1.2	Motherboard just died .	St
1.1.3	Have the following components and would like recommendations on a good motherboard that can carry into the future as I plan a later CPU and Video upgrade .	St
1.1.4	My biggest problem has always been overheating as there are smokers in the house and the computer sits on carpet .	St
1.1.5	AMD Athlon 64 3200+ Antec True 550 PS Antec Performance I P-160W Aluminum Case 4 sticks Celixir 512mb DDR400 pc3200 ATI Radeon 1600XT Pro Video Card Generic FD Sony DVD Drive Plextor ?	Ques

1.2.1	... because your CPU has few links to & quot ; the future & quot ; .	St
1.2.2	In your case you 'd need a motherboard which supports a single core CPU , which could well allow you a path to an X2 dual core , but that 's not the lasting future either .	St
1.2.3	AM2 is AMD 's future path , but this a completely different socket from that used by single core Athlon 64 's and X2 's , so you 're out of luck there .	St
1.2.4	Have a look at the motherboards ( www.newegg.com ) which support X2 's and you 'll see many options and the fastest most powerful chips you could use in the future ... ..if they 're not totally gone by then .	St
1.2.5	As far as cooling , the bottom of a case does not heat up , so it 's of little importance that it 's sitting on a carpet , adding anything to the feet to gain some height ( twist caps from sauce bottles , lego bricks , stacks of coins , aluminium speaker spikes ... .whatever ) to lift it up from the carpet pile is not a great engineering feat .	St
1.2.6	However , if the grime from smokers is collecting in heatsinks , you might do well to get a case filter installed ( google : antec case filter ) , and use good CPU heatsink and fan that is easy to clean , especially as the 64 's are not a hot running chip .	St
1.2.7	Good luck , GeeBee .	Polite
1.3.1	the least expensive route now is another Socket 939 MB that works with an AMD 64 4800 X2 or evem an Opteron 175 CPU .	St
1.3.2	( Note : This recommendation assumes your current CPU is Socket 939 not Socket 754 .	St
1.3.3	How did you determine the motherboard was kaput vice the CPU or PSU ?	Ques
1.3.4	VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	Thanks to both of you for the advice .	St
1.4.2	Actually , the components I have are pieces/parts from two computers .	St
1.4.3	My son gave me the CPU and video card from his old computer ( he upgraded to AM2 ) .	St
1.4.4	The rest of the parts are from my computer .	St
1.4.5	The motherboard on it is an Asus A8V which has a faulty AGP slot - moot as my Video card is now PCI-E. For me to go AM2 , I would need a new processor , board and memory .	St
1.4.6	Even going with the cheapest , I would be looking at over $ 500 .	St
1.4.7	I was hoping to get a decent 939 socket board which would give one more upgrade until the price on the AM2 's come down .	St
1.4.8	But it sounds like the 939 's wo n't be around much longer .	St
1.4.9	Perhaps , I should by a no frills 939 and plan on an AM2 upgrade for the future .	St
1.4.10	Does that sound reasonable ?	Ques
1.4.11	Could you recommend a decent board ?	Ques
1.4.12	I do a lot of graphics work using PhotoShop CS2 , Poser and Vue .	St
1.4.13	They eat up ram , which is why I eventually would like to upgrade .	St
1.5.1	I 'd just get a decent socket 939 ... preferably one that gives you the option for the Athlon 4800 X2 or Opteron 175 .	St
1.5.2	That will make this change low cost AND give you at a CPU upgrade option later that should be a nice boost over the current processor without tossing any of the existing equipment .	Sug
1.5.3	By then ... it 'll all be cheaper .	St
1.5.4	VAPCMD	St
1.6.1	Yes , the CPU takes a 939 socket .	St
1.6.2	I will go that route .	St
1.6.3	Thanks-a-million !	St
1.7.1	NIL	St
1.8.1	Thanks for all the previous help .	St
1.8.2	I purchased a new motherboard and CPU .	St
1.8.3	The whole system is now as follows : Gigabyte K8 Triton Series GA-K8NF-9 MB AMD Athlon 64X2 4400+ Dual Core CPU Antec P160 ALuminum Case Antec True 550 PS 4 sticks 512 DDR400 PC3300 RAM ATI X1600 Pro 512MB PCI-E Video Card 120 GB WD IDE 7200 HD 80 GB Seagate IDE 7200 HD 250 Seagate Barracuda SATA HD Plexwriter 12/10/32A CD-ROM Sony DRU540A DVD/Cd-RW Generic 56K Fax/Modem Generic Floppy Drive The Questions ( One ) : When installing the heat sink on the cpu I engaged the holes on the metal clip over the plastic pins on both sides with no problem .	St
1.8.4	The HS is seated correctly in the plastic holder .	St
1.8.5	But when I lower the lever to lock the heat sink , the & quot ; L & quot ; on the lever handle does not quite engage the side of the outermost plastic pin .	St
1.8.6	I worked with it 3 or 4 times with the same result .	St
1.8.7	I believe the heat sink is locked and sturdy and this is just a glitch , a problem with the plastic .	St
1.8.8	But as this is the first time I have installed a 939 HS , I am not sure .	St
1.8.9	Anyone else have this problem ?	Ques
1.8.10	( Two ) : The motherboard has a 24 pin PS socket .	St
1.8.11	My PS is 20 pin .	St
1.8.12	Gigabyte says to leave the small cover on the power connector if using a 20 pin .	St
1.8.13	However , the small cover is missing from my board/box .	St
1.8.14	Is is necessary ?	Ques
1.8.15	Can I just leave those 4 pins open ?	Ques
1.8.16	I have read on the web that I may have problems using a 20 Pin PS .	St
1.8.17	Eeeps !	St
1.8.18	I would hate to have to purchase a new PS as a good 550 watt is not cheap .	St
1.8.19	What do you recommend ?	Ques
1.9.1	you will need a 20 to 24 pin PSU adapter OR a new PSU .	St
1.9.2	If you 've got a good PSU ... I 'd try the PSU adapter first .	St
1.9.3	VAPCMD	St
