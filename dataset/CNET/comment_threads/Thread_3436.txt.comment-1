Im building a new computer from all new parts.
When I plug in my power supply, the system starts without pushing the switch.
The front switch doesnt work either.
Even with the switch disconected from the board the system still starts up when the ATX Power supply is plugged in.
No OS has been installed...is this a hardware problem like a jumper or a software issue (will it be fine after the OS is installed) or can the be configured in the BIOS.
Thanks for the help The board is a Biostar P4VTB with a Power Magic 550W power supply
