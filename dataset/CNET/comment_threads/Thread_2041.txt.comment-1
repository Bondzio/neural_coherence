HELP!
All of a sudden, my computer is not recognizing my d:// and E:// drives.
When I open &quot;My Computer&quot; all that is listed is a:// and c:// What can I do!?
What did I do that may have caused this?
My computer is a few years old.
I'm using Windows 98 and it's an AMD Athlon Processor (not sure how much info to give about the 'puter) Any ideas?!
Thank you!!
!
