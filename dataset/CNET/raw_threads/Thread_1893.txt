I do not need a beast or anything like that. Rather, I want to be able to play all the current titles on at least medium-high settings with a decent FPS. Needs to be able to play World In Conflict, Crysis: Warhead and Warhammer. I have to go through Dell, so please let me know if you think any parts of this are sub par or going to give me trouble (rather than suggesting I use a different company). Thanks!

Read http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/Best-Graphics-Card,2033.html See where your DOLLAR AMOUNT gets you from this list and how your card compares. Also try to get a monster power supply. Bob
