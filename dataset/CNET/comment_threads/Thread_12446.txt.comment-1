I have an MSI RX3870 T2D512E-OC Video card and over the weekend told me about the ATI Catalyst driver site at http://ati.amd.com/support/driver.html .
I was wondering, what are the major differences in the drivers you can download at the manufacturer's website as opposed to the drivers from ATI Catalyst?
Any real benefits to the catalyst drivers?
