His setup is cable modem for internet access. The cable modem plugs into a 4 port router. He wants to attach his router to a 16+ dlink ethernet fast switch. My question is do we need a crossover cable to connect the router to the swith. If so would this be the best setup. Should we just take away the router and plug the cable modem into swith. If so how would i configure. Anyway all help is appreciated. Any advice as far as setup and configuration would be greatly appreciated

It's the gateway that connects one network to another. It also is probably capable of being a DHCP server. If network users want or need dynamic addressing, the router will do that and a switch will not. That should give you a start.
