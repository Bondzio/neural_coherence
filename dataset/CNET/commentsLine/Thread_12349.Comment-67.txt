i have worked with various makes & models and find where one works ideally in one situation, it is not so good in another.
no one brand seemed to stand out.
one reason maybe that there are many other surrounding influences that effect the wireless signal.
these range from cordless phones & other electronic gear in close proximity, through the structure of the building (glass, concrete, steel) and include what the neighbour's using.
simply, the more central the access point can be mounted (away from other electronic gear) the better it will communicate and brand seems to have little bearing.
what difference brand does make is user-friendliness.
where some linksys units are a nightmare to setup properly other systems like the zyxel are very easy.
previous advice has suggested to use gear of the same brand - although this can be a good idea i have not found it to be essential.
summary - go for a good price with good (preferably local) helpdesk support.
