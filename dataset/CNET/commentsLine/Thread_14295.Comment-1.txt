just a quick question.
i just bought a usb pci 2.0 card with 5 ports.
4 at the back and 1 for the 2 usb ports on my case at the front.
im running windows xp professional service pack 2. its connected up ok and it works just fine apart from when i connect another usb device my usb wireless lan stick goes dead and loses the wireless connection.
after juggling the ports around i am able to restore it again.
any ideas as to why this may happen?
all the ports work fine on their own and its only the wireless usb stick that goes dead.
connecting other devices all together doesnt pose any problems.
also on the card itself is a floppy drive 5v connector.
what is it exactly for?
