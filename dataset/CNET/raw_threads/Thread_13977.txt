I have win 98se running well on a socket370 gigabyte 6oxet motherboard. (dual bios) now, i've tried first to upgrade and clean install legal copies of win 2000pro and then winxp pro. but pc does not want to do this. so did some digging. updated intel chip on mtherboard, no problem went to update bios chip, found a problem, at the moment when i boot i get bios version f7 then i can flash main bios to version f10. flash seems to work until i reboot and bios goes back to version f7, i've tried to flash main bios and backup bios but same happens,the bios goes back to version f7. totally confused and frustrated at this time. any help would be much appreciated many thanks

I went to the GIGABYTE Website and notice that they have 2 BIOS upgrades for the motherboard that im seeing. About updating BIOS... The whole BIOS updating procedure should be treated with extreme caution. If you do not encounter any system instability or bugs with the current BIOS version, we suggest that you keep it. If you determine to flash BIOS, you are taking a personal risk of BIOS flash failure. Please contact your supplier or our distributors/resellers for further remedy in case system crashes unfortunately because of BIOS flash failure. Before you begin... 1. Please make sure the BIOS version you want to flash matches your motherboard model. 2. If your BIOS is flash protected, please do not enable BIOS Flash Protection under Advanced CMOS Setup (AMI BIOS) or Advanced BIOS Features (AWARD BIOS) in BIOS menu. 3. Never interrupt when you BIOS is being updated. GA-6OXET Intel 815EP chipset F11c(Beta) 2002/5/15 Update Micro code http://biosupgrade.notlong.com/ *DOWNLOAD* F10 2002/1/23 Support I/O chip : ITE8712 G version Fixed FAN control in suspend item function not work http://biosgigaf10.notlong.com/ *DOWNLOAD* *Please remember to &quot;Load Optimize Defaults&quot; (in the BIOS Setup) after updating new BIOS And im not sure if this is the case, But i went to the Intel Website because the motherboard has the Intel 815EP AGPset Right? I seen that it said for that you used the Intel Chipset Software Installation Utility http://IntelChipSet.notlong.com

They make great mobos, but have no one that can write a clear English sentence. I had the Dual Bios in a later version mobo and never could figure from the wording in the manual . The following, again from Dragons good input, is an example of a Gigabyte statement that seemd to make no sense. &quot;2. If your BIOS is flash protected, please do not enable BIOS Flash Protection under Advanced CMOS Setup (AMI BIOS) or Advanced BIOS Features (AWARD BIOS) in BIOS menu&quot; Somehow how I think that the flash protection is preventing you from flashing the BIOS. Email Gigabyte and instead of clarifying the answer, they will simply send reference the exact same statement back to you. Decided to use ABIT mobos, simply because their manuals and website stuff is written such that one can understand them.

Installed intel updates fine, but would not update bios. Even used gigabytes own bios flash program. It flashes the bios to the version I want, but then after I load optized defaults and reboots the bios goes back to f7. Will have to stay with 98se for now.
