<s> I have gotten frustrated with my current printer's (Canon MX310) propensity to chew up and engorge itself with each and any standard sized envelope (business #10 size)I attempt to print. </s>
<s> For my own sanity I wish to purchase a dedicated envelope printer. </s>
<s> I need only black ink (I do not wish to have to purchase additional color cartridges or dual purpose cartridges). </s>
<s> My volume is low (usually no more than 10 envelopes in one day - with an average of less than 20 per week). </s>
<s> Any recommendations for something economical that actually LIKES printing envelopes rather than eating them? </s>
<s> Many thanks! </s>
<s> If you are not doing color at all, look into getting an inexpensive laser printer, mono (B/W only) Brother makes an inexpensive printer that would do that, model # 2140,you should be able to find one for around 100 bucks. </s>
