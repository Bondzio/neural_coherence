While you can storage on flash media, don't count on this as permanent storage, temporary at best.
Just too many issues arises and all the requests for help can't always be fixed.
You still need to store the most precious of your data to discs as a more safer place.
That doesn't mean you can't use flash drives, just don't don't store them there indefinitely.
As for flash drives sales, they come and go.
There will always be another one either at brick fronts or online stores on sale.
In my experience, I've used Toshiba and Kingston drives with good results.
HOWEVER, don;t fall for super cheap drive like A-Data, etc or any that seem to pop-up on sale often.
