<s> I have this cable: http://www.justuploadit.com/files/view/1/000_0002_thumb.jpg I have a HP Pavilion a1025c, i want to take this cable and hook it up to my 17&quot; lcd, and hook it to my 32&quot; tv (the tv has vga and i tested it and it works). </s>
<s> I hooked it all up, and both the lcd moniter and tv wont show a picture, says nothing is connected. </s>
<s> I dont know if my pc is missing some type of driver? </s>
<s> Or not compatible with 2 moniters? </s>
<s> I got 2 of these cables for free. </s>
<s> Says on the cable (sonet) i looked it up and i could find cables, but not this one. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatfull. </s>
<s> But some do not work. </s>
<s> And the simple splitters often are not wired proper. </s>
<s> One last try. </s>
<s> Connect just one display without the cable. </s>
<s> Working? </s>
<s> Ok, now try the splitter (just one display still.) </s>
<s> No go? </s>
<s> Then it's junk. </s>

<s> Still wont work, can you recomend some type, i would like to view my lcd moniter, and on the lcd tv at the same time, i was looking into a converter, but i was thinking of trying to keep it vga. </s>
<s> Is there a box that i can hook pc vga to the box, then vga to the moniter, and tv. </s>
<s> I think vga comes in better than avi. </s>
<s> Any advice would help. </s>
<s> Oh, and is there a good one like this, that WORKS? </s>
<s> I have 2 of these and they both dont work. </s>
<s> Given the price you paid there isn't much to say here. </s>
<s> Try newegg.com and read customer comments about the prospective unit. </s>

<s> Found this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817107511 I seen some good reviews on this, and its reasonabley priced think it will do its job? </s>
<s> While it will likely do the split (others say so) I don't have the unit or the full details of video mode you tried to split. </s>
<s> Such didn't matter in the case of what you had since the test failed. </s>

<s> I am going to use it to play dvds from my computer, picture slideshows stuff like that, if i connect my computer directly to it i have to disconnect the moniter, im wondering if i get this how i will set it up, because on the lcd tv i have to set the windows text biger because its so small and i cant see it far away. </s>
<s> I wonder how that would work, is there a way to use 2 gfx cards with vga or something? </s>
<s> At beyond 1024x768 some of these splitters may smear a little. </s>
<s> Other than that should be fine. </s>
