I have an old HDD from a Dell Dimension 2400 (Win XP) that I want to get some old family pictures off of. The Dell has no power supply so it justs sits in the garage. So I took it out and connected it to my current PC (Win XP). I believe its IDE. I had to take out my CD drive because I could only find 1 slot for the IDE connector. Long story short: I tried accessing the folder but it says its inaccessible. I'm guessing it has something to do with the administrator profile thing. I remember I set it so that Guest profiles could not look at my personal documents. Is there a way around this lock? Thanks in advance.

If the message says &quot;Access denied&quot; then you can do something about that, Take Ownership! Have a look at the guidance from Microsoft here; http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308421 If the error message differs, please let us know what the full message is. I hope that helps. Mark
