Do I need to have one computer on at all times for the DSL network to work? I can't find a direct answer to this question. All I want is to be able to have my wireless network on like it is now so that any computer (and the TiVo) in our house can connect at anytime. Is it possible to do this with a DSL connection? Thanks for the help.

Note that some modem's will have built in routing capabilities. Ask you ISP if they are providing such.
