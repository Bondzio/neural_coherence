Years ago I bought their routers from Walmart.
I encountered the same thing as many of you did: I could not find them anymore.
by around mid 2005 I called them and found they were closing down the business.
I could not get any support service as all their tech staff like product managers, product engineers had all got let go.
It is a sad story as these small companies trying to make it but not getting for financial support in hard time.
I guess the best bet is still stick with Netgear and Cisco or D-Link.
I have been using D-Link DIR655 for years and being able to get firmware update and tech support when I need them.
