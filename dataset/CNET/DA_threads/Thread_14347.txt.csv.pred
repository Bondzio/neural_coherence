1.1.1	Hey guys, I am a freelance graphic designer and minor gamer (cs 1.6/cs:go).	St
1.1.2	I recently shied away from the iMac 27&quot; due to price and upgrade inability and decided on getting another pc.	St
1.1.3	I am a print designer so I will not be rendering video or anything to demanding.	St
1.1.4	I loved the appearance of the Maingear Potenza and also tower size is an issue in my little apartment which has led to me to the Maingear Potenza: http://www.maingear.com/custom/desktops/potenza/ What are your guys' thoughts about this computer and if you have any recommendations that would be greatly appreciated.

1.2.5	http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html The site you noted appears to cater to those that want good lucks over performance.	St
