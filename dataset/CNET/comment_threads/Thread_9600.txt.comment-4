I always use this stupid way to solve my hardware connection problems and it always work.
Go to add hardware and click &quot;yes that the hardware is connected&quot;.
It will list you all the hardwares those you mentioned &quot;working properly&quot;.
Highlight that hardware and click next and finish.
It will go to the troublesthooting menu and will guide you step by step.
I have the same problem with my computer in my office.
It fails to read some hardware sometimes and it always said working properly.
