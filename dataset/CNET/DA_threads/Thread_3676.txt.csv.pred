1.1.1	Have an iMac 400DV, slot load, OS 9.2.2 that blew up.	St
1.1.2	Logic board and analog board are toast.	St
1.1.3	Repair removed hard drive, and determined data was recoverable.	St
1.1.4	Now, have bought new iMac G5, 1.8, SD.and would like to transfer some files from old HD if possible.	St
1.1.5	Backup was current to 2 weeks before crash and burn.	St
1.1.6	What is best way to grab files from old HD?	St
1.1.7	Do I need an enclosure for old HD as well as cable?	St
1.1.8	Thanks for help.	St
1.2.1	Given that your old machine is toast, a good and lasting way to move the files and have an external drive for later use is to purchase a Firewire enclosure.	St
1.2.2	Other World Computing sell a nice one for about $60.	Sug
1.2.3	It comes, as they all do, with the necessary Firewire cable and instructions.	St
1.2.4	As you are using OS X, no drivers are necessary.	St
1.2.5	Just put the old drive in the enclosure.	St
1.2.6	Connect the Firewire cable at both ends and power up the enclosure.	St
1.2.7	Within seconds, your old HD will appear on the desktop, ready for you to drag your old DATA files to the new machine.	St
1.2.8	Do NOT drag the Application files to the new machine, they will NOT work, but you knew that anyway.	St
1.2.9	It's a really easy fix and you have the external drive for extra storage later.	St
1.2.10	Hope this helps P	St
1.3.1	Thank you for the quick reply.	St
1.3.2	Sounds great, I like the idea of the extra drive, and also thanks for letting me know where I can go to get the enclosure.	St

1.4.1	Got sidetracked with taxes, but finally followed your advice and wanted to send my thanks.	St
1.4.2	I got a firewire external drive enclosure from OWC and everything works like a charm.	St
