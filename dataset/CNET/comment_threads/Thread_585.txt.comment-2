To be sure it is installed properly, your brother must have tried it, so it seems logical to me he showed you that it worked correctly and how to use it.
I assume it isn't a flash drive, but something with a (rather large) hard disk inside.
And I assume it's just a drive letter (maybe d:, maybe g:) in My Computer.
So saving or moving anything to it can be done by selecting the g:-drive in stead of the c:-drive.
And you can move or copy anything to it using My Computer or Windows Explorer like you copy or move to any other drive.
Hope this helps.
