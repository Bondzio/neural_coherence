We would like to keep this arrangement for the XBox & desktop for gaming purposes (general consensus seems to be a wired connection is faster than wireless). However, I would like to add a Linksys WRT54GL Ver 1.1 wireless router for another laptop to roam around the house. Can I just connect the Linksys wireless router into the Dynex wired router, or does everything now have to go through the wireless router first? To connect the wireless router, do I run the setup CD in the laptop that I want to primarily use the wireless router? I'm not the most savvy when it comes to this stuff, but can follow detailed directions. If there are any links/videos, etc. you can refer to me to that already addresses this issue, that would be great. I greatly appreciate any assistance you can provide.

Some of the better router firmwares just work without you changing it to how we note in this forum's sticky. Bob
