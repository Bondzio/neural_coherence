1) as long as you have a router you don't need a dedicated computer for internet access.
Everyone goes through that router for access.
2)Again if you have a router connect to the ISP wireless equipment, your son's laptop can certainly connect to your network through a WiFi access point which you will have to purchase from tigerdirect or futureshop.
this access point will provide wireless coverage in your home so your son's laptop can connect to your home network.
Usually the WiFi coverage is about 100 meters range so it should be enough for most home users.
From the access point you need an ethernet cable to go to your router, but other than that your son's laptop is free to go anywhere in the house and do not need ur user name and password to go online since you have everything going through ur router.
Hope this is helpful.
