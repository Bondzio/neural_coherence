as this is just another hard disk without write protection, multiple copies of the media and more it fails what a backup is.
if you feel this is backup you only need to keep reading posts in this forum.
the one thing to never do is to whittle your copies of what you can't lose to just one copy.
tech support is not free anymore.
and some rail against that.
as dvdr is 4.7gb you have about 15 dvds or less than 20 bucks for your first backup.
as bluray comes down it's 25gb per disk gets your backup on 3 disks.
as you make more copies you then achieve backup.
