<s> Ok, the story goes, I bought this Epson C82 inkjet printer about 4 months ago. </s>
<s> Now I ran out of black awhile ago and bought some at a discount online and things have been fine.Until I ran out of magenta, now nothing is printing, so I replaced all with Epson C80 ink from Office Depot, still no printing, I cleaned the heads 5 times, did all mantenience and nothing. </s>
<s> So I thought it was the C80 ink. </s>
<s> So I bought C82 ink at a discount online and tried printing just a cover letter and all I got is just some streaks, then I tried a photo setting and I got a very faint and streaked print.Sooo, I called Epson Customer Service and they want to charge me $9 for their help, forget that, can anyone help, or do I have to pay the $9 for a phone call? </s>
<s> I want to throw this thing out the window, Help! </s>
<s> Thanks Mike </s>
<s> What will irk most is that service and support will cost more than replacing the printer. </s>
<s> Perils of lower costs. </s>
<s> I will not write much about why removing free support lowers the initial cost of the printer, but I have learned to just pay the piper on ink cartridges. </s>
<s> The Epson has some superfine nozzles and I can't say if non-Epson ink will clog. </s>
<s> But will note that your warranty is void now and I'd open the window before tossing it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Go ahead and throw it out the window. </s>
<s> But, before that try repeated cleanings as many as 10X or more. </s>
<s> Yes, that will use alot of ink. </s>
<s> However, if you really don't want to spend money on ink then buy a replacement as a &quot;on sale&quot; printer may be as close as the ink carts cost. </s>
<s> Now, next time use Epson ink(costs alot, consider your past experience) and if it ever goes dry, install a new ink cart quickly. </s>
<s> Epson printers work great when they do and just are a PITA when they don't, IMHO and I don't recommend them. </s>
<s> sorry ... -----Willy </s>
<s> Are you running the Nozzle check? </s>
<s> If so, does it show anything now that you have replaced the cartridges again. </s>
<s> Be aware, that pulling out a cartridge and putting it back in is a NO NO with an Epson, it can leave a bubble in the nozzle that will not clear up easily. </s>
<s> You really need to clean until you get a complete nozzle check pattern. </s>
<s> At this point, about all you can do is try repeatedly, printing a nozzle check each time. </s>
<s> It should improve with each cleaning. </s>
<s> You can buy cartridges that have cleaning fluid in them, that may fix it. </s>
