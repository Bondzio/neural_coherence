I also heard that my power supply sucks, and my ram is okay.What video card should I get that will fit my computer? Do all power supply's fit any computer?Basically asking what ram/power supply/video card I should get to upgrade my computer. I want to play pretty good games on it but my budget isn't huge. Thanks.

The ATI 5450 continues to pop up as a nice enough card that can go in and work even on a slim power supply. You can research benchmarks and more. Here are starter links. http://www.techspot.com/review/244-ati-radeon-hd-5450/ http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/radeon-hd-5450,2549.html Notice those power comparisons? This should give the machine a nice boost without a power supply swap. Bob
