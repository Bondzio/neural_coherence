<s> hi, my computer does not have good cooling...besides the cpu fan and the power supply fan i only have one fan in it, and i am going to get a XFX 8800GT Alpha Dog Overclocked Edition 512MB, DDR3, 256bit, PCIE, Dual DVI Out, HDCP. </s>
<s> because of my cooling is it a good idea to get it? </s>
<s> PS: the graphics card has a built in fan </s>
<s> I always check http://www.tomshardware.com/2008/02/04/best_cards_february_2008/ but for cooling I can leave the cover off and/of modify the case to add more vents. </s>

<s> If you already know you got cooling problems, adding a OC'ed card isn't going to help. </s>
<s> Before you even install the new card, get better cooling, this will prevent cooling issues. </s>
<s> If possible add extra in any empty fan holes or make them, if capable. </s>
<s> There are websites that users also called modders that modify their cases, etc. </s>
<s> to get better cooling. </s>
<s> Google for modding websites. </s>
<s> Here is a website for fan selection and other items: http://www.frozencpu.com Though you didn't mention what psu you have, its VERY IMPORTANT to get a psu that's capable of supporting a hot video card and is able to better cool itself as well with dual fans. </s>
<s> This not something to consider but something you need to do, IMHO. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> i have cooler master 550W power supply, and i decided to go with the standard one lol ill get more fans soon </s>
