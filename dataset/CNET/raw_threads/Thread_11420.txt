Its an HP,with Windows XP Professional & an intel pentium 4 processor,it says it has 256 MB or RAM but that might be wrong. The PC had a lot of problems and everytime we went it to get fixed it worked well for a short while then got even worse. I also suspect that the people who &quot;fixed&quot; it used a fake/false copy of Windows because recently when I checked on the Microsoft site, it wasn't a genuine copy. At first we said we would order a new copy but now we're thinking of just buying a new computer. I really don't feel...right using a fake copy after we've spent so much money buying and &quot;repairing&quot; this PC I am a little fed up.) --I like music and videos and I want a fast PC that has a lot of memory. Can anyone help me?
