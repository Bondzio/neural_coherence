We have a huge number of iBooks that need to have their batteries recalled. However, one of the instructions is to discharge all of the batteries. With hundreds of these batteries to send back, it isn't practical to discharge them one by one. Does anybody know of any battery discharging towers, or other methods to discharge large numbers of Li-Ion batteries?

You may want to rinse off the batteries before shipping and check them with a voltmeter to be sure that they are fully discharged. A very simple yet effective method.

A Google search on &quot;Lithium and Water&quot; will yield tidbits like: &quot;Effects of exposure to Lithium: Fire: Flammable. Many reactions may cause fire or explosion. Gives off irritating or toxic fumes (or gases) in a fire. Explosion: Risk of fire and explosion on contact with combustible substances and water.&quot; Recommendations I've received include: Tape off the contacts to prevent inadvertent shorting; the batteries can then be shipped by SURFACE movement...not air shipment.
