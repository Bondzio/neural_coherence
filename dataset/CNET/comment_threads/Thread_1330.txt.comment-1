Does anyone know how to restore a file after emptying the recycle bin (not how to restore one that's currently in the bin)?
I accidently deleted something and didn't realize my mistake until after I had emptied my recycle bin.
I know that windows doesn't actually erase the data until something else needs the space (or something like that), so I stll have hope.
