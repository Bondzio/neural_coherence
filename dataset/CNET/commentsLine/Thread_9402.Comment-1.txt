i have a hp xl759 desktop and it became obvious to me that i needed more ram.
when my computer boots it loads three programs.
after it boots, i checked the system status and noted that only about 40% of the installed 256 mb memory was available (i.e., 60% was being used by the start up programs)....so i decided to double the memory.
i checked hp website for applicable ram and then installed the recommendation of hp upto the max amount allowed by this pc (512 mb).
once installed, i checked the system again upon booting up and the computer recognizes/sees the ram....but it still says only about 40% of the installed 512 mb ram is available...as if the computer can see the additional ram but it isn't using it.
any ideas on how to solve my problem?
thanks...
