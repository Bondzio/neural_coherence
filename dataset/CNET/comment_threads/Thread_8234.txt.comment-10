If they work out of the box they will almost always enjoy a normally long life.
However, external drives can have parts that fail, most frequently in fact, that are not part of the drive itself but are circuitry within the drive's housing that are part of the USB port or power supply.
I have found that, once you pry open the housing (not always an easy task) and &quot;liberate&quot; the drive itself, it almost always works perfectly and no data has been lost.
Hardware that allows you to connect a bare drive to your PC via a USB port costs about $9.00 or so, and there are a whole slew of them available from the usual retail sources.
