1.1.1	I have a HTC Thunderbolt.	St
1.1.2	I was checking my email and tried to open an attachment.	St
1.1.3	It was a picture from some app called Pocket Booth.	St
1.1.4	I should have known it was going to be trouble because I had to click download several times and it wouldn't open.	St
1.1.5	Little did I know it actually had downloaded everytime.	St
1.1.6	Anyway, I saw the picture several times in my downloads folder and deleted them all.	St
1.1.7	Several weeks later, I started having issues with the camera and other apps because the phone claimed that my SD card was full.	St
1.1.8	It's 8 GB, but I've only had the phone for a few months so it couldn't be possible.	St
1.1.9	I went to the downloads and saw that there were more than 5000 items!	St
1.1.10	The majority of them was this picture that had been copied over and over.	St
1.1.11	I deleted them.	St
1.1.12	The next week I had 1200+ files in there--all this picture that won't go away!	St
1.1.13	I've tried mounting the phone to the computer and deleting them from there, but that does work.	St
1.1.14	What gives?	St
1.2.1	Assuming this is a Micro SD chip a suggestion would be to get (likely at a box store or online tech site) an adapter for the micro chip, input to a computer SD card reader, many computers including laptops have these, read the card and attempt deletion that way or more likely attempt a full format.
