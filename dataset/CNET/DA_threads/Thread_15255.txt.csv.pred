1.1.1	I have two old Gateway PC's that I have cobbled together with spare parts.	St
1.1.2	One has all of the OEM software with keycodes.	St
1.1.3	I have installed Ubuntu on both of them.	St
1.1.4	One of them is a P3 700, with 192 mb of Ram and a 20 GB hard drive.	St
1.1.5	The other is a P3 550 with 320 MB of Ram, and 2 hard drives.	St
1.1.6	OS on a 10 GB and the data drive is a 20 GB.	St
1.1.7	Along with CRT monitors, keyboards and mice and speakers, I plan on taking the machines to Goodwill.	St
1.1.8	Unless I can find someone in need of a PC, I will take them tomorrow.	St
1.1.9	Any idea on value of them?	St
1.1.10	They both work.	St
1.1.11	The one with the least memory has a NIC card, I was just surfing the internet with it a few minutes ago.	St
1.1.12	The other PC only has a modem installed.	St
1.2.1	But for example, a new laptop starts at 299 so at best 1/2 that and only if there are legitimate CDs for the OS and what's loaded.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	I have the Gateway software package that came new with one of the machines.	St
1.3.2	Along with it (98se) the keycodes and gateway recovery disk.	St
1.3.3	I had to put a NIC card in it, clean the lint and dirt, installed a new CMOS battery.	St
1.3.4	I installed UBUNTU on both machines.	St
1.3.5	I was going to offer them to someone for $50 apiece (includes CRT monitor, Mouse and keyboard, speakers.)	St
1.3.6	I just wondered if that was too much.	St
1.4.1	My nephew is able to ply a similar P3 1GHz etc.	St
1.4.2	no display at 100 bucks so the market is out there.	St
