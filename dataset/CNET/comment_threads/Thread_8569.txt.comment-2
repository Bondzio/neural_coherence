Your power cable/cord should be an 'unused' one from the system's power supply.
If you don't have an extra one or one that matches, then you need to buy one.
However, you offered no info on the USB/firewire card, what model it is.
If it is a typical system power connector required, you can get a 'Y-cable' which splits one power lead into two, found at many computer suppliers, but this is a guess on my part.
Just be sure to follow the install instructions, take that with you to RS maybe they got what you need or ask for more info.
If none of this helps with that RS product return it, it useless, get a more generic USB2.0 pci card, if you need firewire, a combo pci card from another source.
