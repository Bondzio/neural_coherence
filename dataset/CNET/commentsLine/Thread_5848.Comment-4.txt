sorry when i ask about dpi, it's not about the number of dots on the screen.
here's a primer on dpi.
while it's nice to have a higher dpi some folk explode when they can't see a single pixel change on the display when it's very small.
so while apple's retina displays are very nice, i find cad folk to have issues with very high dpi screens when drawing lines and such.
last year's high end machine could be some i7, 8gb ram, etc.
so you are talking about a 2 generation leap so it will be fine.
