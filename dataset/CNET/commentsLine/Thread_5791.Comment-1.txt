i recently purchased the netgear ma111 wireless adapter, as well as netgear's wireless router.
the router works fine w/ the computer when the computer was plugged into it via ethernet cable.
however, when i try to access the internet w/ the usb adapter only, it does not work.
i spoke with netgear's tech support and we ran ipconfig which seemed to indicate the existence of the internet.
nevertheless, i could not access any site including the config site for the router.
also, i am running windows 98se.
thanks, corey
