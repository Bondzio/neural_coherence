<s> Hey everybody! </s>
<s> I've read the article titled &quot;Double Vision: Add a second monitor to your system&quot; and got interested. </s>
<s> I attached another monitor to my laptop and everything had been working just great until my notebook's screen started glitching - something wrong with LCD matrix, I guess. </s>
<s> So, my question is - how can I make my second monitor my primary screen? </s>
<s> I tried going to the Display-&gt;Properties-&gt;Displays (or something like that :)), where one can choose the primary screen, but all the option boxes are gray, and I can't click them... My nephew has been messing with my computer, so it could've been him... Could you please help me out? </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> anyone? </s>
