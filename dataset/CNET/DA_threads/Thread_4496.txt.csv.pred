1.1.1	Hello, I am looking for a washable, flexible, 109-key, USB full sized keyboard with, preferably, normal placement of the arrow keys, an enter key that is of a decent size (and is the backwards L type), a full sized backspace key, the full top row of f# keys, etc.	St
1.1.2	etc.	St
1.1.3	I don't know which brand of &quot;Flexible and Washable&quot; keyboards to get, or which model to get if I *do* decide.	St
1.1.4	Has anyone done a comparison of any of the keyboards from Seal Shield, Tripp Lite, Adesso, Grandtec, True Touch, Modtek, Targus, etc.?	St
1.1.5	Also, how can I figure out if one of these is just a rebranded version of another?	St
1.1.6	Which of these companies is still alive and supporting their product?	St
1.1.7	Do any of these keyboards have anything physically different with the f and j keys, to find the home keys by touch?	St
1.1.8	If so, which?	St
1.1.9	Which brands have the lowest incidents of stuck keys for their latest models?	St
1.1.10	I am in the States, and would like to pay under $40 for a keyboard (these seem to be relatively inexpensive, which does help!	St
1.1.11	), and I don't know what to get.	St
1.1.12	Any help would be appreciated!	St
1.2.1	I have identified these models of being 'of interest'.	St
1.2.2	Does anyone have any thoughts on any of them, or any comparisons?	Ques
