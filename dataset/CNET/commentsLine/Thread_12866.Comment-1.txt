i already know it makes it more accurate, but before i blow a hundred dollars on a mouse i want to know if it actually makes the game look smoother.
i just bought a new graphics card (gtx 560 ti) and couldn't help but notice that it looks a little jumpy when i slide the mouse.
when i run or aim i can tell that the games actually running a lot smoother than when i turn.
it also looks a lot smoother with a controller.
so can somebody vouch that their games got smoother looking after buying a higher dpi mouse... or is it just one of those things people like to brag about but it reality there's no difference?
