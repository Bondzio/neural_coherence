<s> When I boot up, error message &quot;operating system not found&quot;, Can this problem be the jumper settings or who has experience with this error? </s>
<s> Im sorry, it says &quot;cannot find the operating system&quot;. </s>
<s> I just changed the hard drive, this one is used 10 gig IBM Quantum. </s>
<s> Not sure if it has operating system loaded or not but I would guess so. </s>
<s> I want to reformat and tried to put 2000 pro booting from cd and It went through process and in partition it said to quit. </s>
<s> If I am getting this right, you have a used 10 gig drive and do not know what it's contents, if anything, is. </s>
<s> You want to install Win2K on it, however. </s>
<s> Here is what I would do with such an unknown drive. </s>
<s> You said IBM Quantum. </s>
<s> Well, Quantum was it's own company and was acquired by Maxtor. </s>
<s> If you can, I would try to find a diagnostic utility from their web site that you allow you to test the drive first. </s>
<s> You might even be able to completely erase it. </s>
<s> This would be best for a new Win2K installation. </s>
<s> If the drive is in good shape, you should be able to attempt an installation of Win2K provided the rest of the PC is capable of running it. </s>
<s> This will mean some minimum processor and amount of RAM. </s>
<s> Win 2K will want 256 megs or RAM at least but more is better. </s>
<s> I'd suggest a P-3 or better processor as well. </s>
<s> You will also need to have other hardware drivers available. </s>
<s> Good luck and hope this helps. </s>
<s> Ok, thankyou, I will try and see what happens. </s>
<s> My system is a pentium 3 with 391 ram 933 mhz compaq. </s>
<s> Ill let you know if it helps. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
