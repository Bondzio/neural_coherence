Thanks for your response Ray.
I've only got one black lever on my assembly.
Then these two clips which were a bugger to get in properly in the first place, and seem even worse to get out.
Last time I had a go I was trying to do it with the mobo in place, next time I'll remove it and have another go... and cross my fingers, toes and everything else.
Cheers Darren
