Just a bit of advice, I've just started overclocking and want to see what the max voltage I can safely send to my CPU as Ive been told that this will help increase my FSB speed, here's my setup - Asus A7V600 (KT600 chipset) Motherboard Athlon XP 2400+ 512MB 2700 Samsung RAM Radeo 9800 Pro 450W Power Supply Initially, the FSB was set to 133/33 in the BIOS, this gave me a CPU speed of 1.99GHz, I've took it step by step to 149/33 (anything above this and the PC won't start), this gives me a speed of 2.23GHz.
However, as stated above, I've been told that if I increase the voltage going to CPU, I can overclock even further.
the current voltage is 1.650V.
What can I safely increase this to so I don't damage the CPU?
