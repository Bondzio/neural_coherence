Hi, For whatever reason your disk has lost some clusters the same,aside from accident damage eg dropping,is likely to be ongoing.So the drive over a few months more use will prob get worse.
Lost clusters are serious stuff since the os cannot read across them and a crash or freeze results.That crash usually means more data loss or software damage which in turn causes yet more probs.
Even when clusters can be restored and got working or at least isolated they can still cause probs eg slow to read/write or the area has got to be skipped by the os,not good !.
So on a drive of mine any bad clusters and the drive is from then on is suspect,back ups are taken quick.If they cannot be repaired or any more deteriation is suspected then the drive is scrapped and back ups applied to a new one.
Best wishes Chris.
