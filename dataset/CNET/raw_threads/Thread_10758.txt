15108	0	356637	3114693	NR	Peter Mc Kimm	8/29/09 11:20 AM	1.2515448E12	Printer will not function.	I keep getting a message when closing from Windows that states' Installing updates1 of 1' and then telling me not to turn off as pc will turn itself off. That takes time. Coincidental or otherwise printer, HP Deskjet D4260 that was printing normally has stopped working and installing Cd supplied only brings up message 'Print spooler service is not running' I purchased 1 Uniblue Powersuite2009 on 18th June last and I wonder is it a scam, although recommended by you, as it made no difference to the pc's performance. Any assistance would be much appreciated

As for the printer error, look at Hewlett Packard's site for print spooler error fixes, there should be a patch to download and run to deal with that issue. As for the other items, need more info.
