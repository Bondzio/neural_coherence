1.1.1	Just a quick question.	St
1.1.2	I just bought a USB PCI 2.0 card with 5 ports.	St
1.1.3	4 at the back and 1 for the 2 USB ports on my case at the front.	St
1.1.4	Im running Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2.	St
1.1.5	Its connected up ok and it works just fine apart from when I connect another USB device my USB Wireless Lan Stick goes dead and loses the wireless connection.	St
1.1.6	After juggling the ports around I am able to restore it again.	St
1.1.7	Any ideas as to why this may happen?	St
1.1.8	All the ports work fine on their own and its only the wireless USB stick that goes dead.	St
1.1.9	Connecting other devices all together doesnt pose any problems.	St
1.1.10	Also on the card itself is a Floppy drive 5v connector.	St
1.1.11	What is it exactly for?	St
1.1.12	Chris	St
1.2.1	...since juggling them around corrects the problem.	St
1.2.2	Even though you have 4 external ports, some will share the same power.	St
1.2.3	You can see what power a device is using by opening Device Manager (right-click My Computer, select &quot;Hardware&quot; tab, click [Device Manager]), opening &quot;USB controllers&quot;, and then checking the &quot;Power&quot; tab of each &quot;USB Root Hub&quot;.	St
1.3.1	What is the make & model of PCI USB 2.0 card?	St
1.4.1	forgot to add that the 5v connector is probably to provide additional hub power (in excess of what a pci slot can provide).	St
1.4.2	if you plug it in to a power supply lead, you should see either some of your hubs becoming self-powered or additional power availble on the hub.	St
