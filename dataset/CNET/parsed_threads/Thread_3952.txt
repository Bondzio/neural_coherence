<s> am trying to network my two home computers, and am not very capable with setting this up. </s>
<s> my specifics are as follows: Comp.1--HP desktop running Windows XP Home w/SP2. </s>
<s> This has Norton Systemworks 2007 Premier and ZoneAlarm Pro installed. </s>
<s> Comp.2--Gateway running Windows XP Media Center. </s>
<s> This is fresh out-of-box, with no installed AV or purchased firewall yet. </s>
<s> Motorola Cable/telephony modem SBV5220 Linksys Router WRT54G version 6 Linksys Wireless-G WMP54G Wireless-G card was installed on Gateway and appears to be ok...brought up a list of available networks it sniffed out. </s>
<s> Attempted to install router on HP with supplied cd, but cannot connect to internet thru router. </s>
<s> Wiring is correct: cable to modem, Ethernet cable to router, line 1 Ethernet cable to computer (HP). </s>
<s> Have been in touch with their &quot;support&quot; techs. </s>
<s> The last one informed me that there was a compatibility problem with IE7 (running on HP). </s>
<s> So I installed Firefox version 2.0. </s>
<s> Same problem exists. </s>
<s> I'm able to &quot;ping&quot; their site 192.168.1.1, and can also &quot;ping&quot; a URL (if there's any difference between those two). </s>
<s> I don't know how to check for the IP addresses, nor where the MAC address comes into play, if at all. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Work on getting the wired connection working first. </s>
<s> See if you can access the router's administration page (the router's settings) by going to http://192.168.1.1 Once you access the router's admin page, follow the instructions from your ISP on how to set up a router with their service. </s>
<s> i am no real expert but i've just been thru this so i thought i'd give you my 2 cents, re: the router, my big mistake was misunderstanding which ethernet jack was in and which was out, as they are often right all in a row. </s>
<s> that stuff usually works right off. </s>
<s> if not, one trick is to reboot the modem and router: unplug, wait 30 seconds (why i don;t know- i wait 3) plug back in, and give it a few min. </s>
<s> re: setting up a home netowrk, here is what 5 books did not tell me: assuming both comps are on the net, this very important: 1) create a user account on each computer that is identical in name and password to the other. </s>
<s> when you create the account, add it to a workgroup. </s>
<s> you need to name the workgoup the same on each machine too. </s>
<s> this too is real important. </s>
<s> 2) i am not sure but i think the accounts need a password. </s>
<s> I was hoping to avoid this but apparently not. </s>
<s> 2a you may need to set the thing to ask for passwords. </s>
<s> go to system/ users and passwords. </s>
<s> it's a checkbox. </s>
<s> note this was a win2k thing. </s>
<s> 3) using windows explorer, (not ie), right click on folders you want to share, click properties, and click on share/ sharing and make them shared. </s>
<s> 4if you have a firewall (I have zone alarm) you need to add the network to the trusted zone. </s>
<s> my system: start run type cmd, in the dos window type ipconfig. </s>
<s> you will see your IP number, &quot;add&quot; that to your list of trusted zone comps. </s>
<s> 5) note if all your machines are xp, there is a network setup wizard you can use. </s>
<s> you need to burn a disk or have a thumb drive to xfer stuff to other comps. </s>
<s> i had win2k so couldn't use it. </s>
<s> bear in mind, i played around with passwords yesterday and now nothing works, but i had it up and running for a day. </s>
<s> this is just what seemed to work for me, it's still a blur. </s>
<s> if any experts care to correct me feel free. </s>
<s> once done, click on start network places, you'll see menu options to click on, one will take you to your network group. </s>
<s> if all you see is printers and faxes you dind't enable sharing. </s>
<s> good luck-- fj </s>
<s> well i am back up and running -- lesson learned, if you muck around with anything you need to go back and re-name the workgroup, why i do not know. </s>
<s> --fj </s>
<s> Yep, that is a solution that can get sharing via Windows Workgroups going again. </s>
<s> The ability to connect to the Internet (rykdawgg6601's original problem) is independent of whether file sharing on a local network is functioning. </s>
<s> rykdawgg6601 should be able to get the router to connect to the Internet whether or not Workgroup file and printer sharing is enabled. </s>
