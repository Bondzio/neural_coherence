Hi Mark, Sorry for not getting back to you sooner but we had a family tragedy so I wasn't able to post back until now.
I don't have a clue what was wrong but I decided to clean up the laptop and when I removed one of the programs I didn't need anymore, I had to do a restart to finish uninstalling it.
When it rebooted, my internet connection was back and running just fine.
Go figure!
So, this post is now resolved.
Thanks for your help anyway, Mark.
