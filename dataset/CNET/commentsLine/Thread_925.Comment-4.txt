i know about the xp sp2 repair install (see google) where i can press the f6 button at the right time to install the needed raid or sata drivers but i don't duplicate web pages about that.
tell me you have looked into that.
we also have a dead end issue which is where the raid is setup via some onboard bios.
these are usually incompatible from board to board so any expert will point that out to you and suggest we look again at our disaster recovery plans.
