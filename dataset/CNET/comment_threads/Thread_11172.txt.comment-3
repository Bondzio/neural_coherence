Yes, that's right.
The machine did not come with Win XP when I bought it.
I believe, it came with some Linux OS.
I reinstalled the Win XP Pro in the comp.
I can see the sticker on the bottom of the laptop, saying that it contains Atheros card.
Also, I was able to use the wireless with Atheros, till around 2 months back.
I'm sure that the wireless would work if the red X is removed from the Wireless Network Connections in the Network Connections window, but I dont know what and where to check, to get it connected.
Apprecaite your assistance.
Regards,
