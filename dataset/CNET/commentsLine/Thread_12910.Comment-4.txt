i did unplug and replug the modem and the router countless times.
same thing.
i have plugged the modem into the computer.
i got the internet.
when plugged to the router everything seems to worl fine.
i get all the lights, i can access my network, my laptop gets a signal, but the internet doesnt go to my desktop or laptop.
