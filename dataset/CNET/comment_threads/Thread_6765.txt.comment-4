did you click YES to having large drive support?
If you didn't then you are limited to FAT 16- 2 GB.
There was also an update to FDISK.
Even if you downloaded that it DID NOT automatically insert the new version into the file that makes the Boot floppy.
You must do that manually, either on the floppy as just for that floppy or in explorer to replace the old FDISK that is in the boot disk file.
For large drives the FDISK works just fine, however then the format reports the incorrect size, however if you proceed it actually formats the drive correctly.
