<s> I have a DELL Dimension 4600 series, and am about to purchase a 4700 series (has a different processor, chipset, ram, pretty much everything). </s>
<s> In order to preserve my data and restore the 4600 series to its original state, I was just going to physicall switch hard drives on the two pc's. </s>
<s> Would this cause any problems (ie. </s>
<s> BIOS issues)? </s>
<s> Would the computer recognize all of the changes to the system and make the appropriate adjustments? </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> If it's Windows XP, the activation alone will try to activate again plus minor hardware differences will cause the drive and the OS to not boot. </s>
<s> Why not move your stuff over with your backup? </s>
<s> You do backup, don't you? </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> Another nifty thing is that XP has a nasty habit of rewriting the partition table on a drive you add to some system. </s>
<s> I've seen and read posts here where people panic when they put the drive back and the slave on that system vanishes (along with the data they didn't backup.) </s>
<s> That forever after- it WILL be a slave!! </s>
<s> !- takes quite a trick to make it useable as a primary master for operating system purposes... </s>
<s> well... i didn't just want to move the backup because I want Office Small Buisiness on the 4600 and I was planning on purchasing it pre installed on the 4700 and then switching hard drives so i would have a new computer with my old hard drive and my dad would have my computer with a new hard drive and Office Small Buisiness.... darn </s>

<s> As to moving your Small Business Suite, Microsoft is taking more time to ensure we all follow those licenses today. </s>
<s> To the point that some systems take a hit in operation when we try to pull a fast one... </s>
