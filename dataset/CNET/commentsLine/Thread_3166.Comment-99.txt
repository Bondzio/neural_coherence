you said, &quot;on the other hand, i have not heard any bad reviews of maxtor hard drives.
based on reviews alone, it seems that maxtor has surpassed wd in quality.&quot; just another perspective... i've read more bad reviews about maxtor drives than any other brand.
in any case, they were bought up by seagate a few years ago.
i'm surprised no one has mentioned grc's spinrite software.
if you have a hard drive failure, spinrite is absolutely your best chance of recovering your drive at least long enough to get your data back (grc.com).
