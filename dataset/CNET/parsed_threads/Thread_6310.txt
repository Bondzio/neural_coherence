<s> I have a Dell LCD monitor with multiple inputs: VGA, DVI-D, S-Video, Composite and Component. </s>
<s> I'm currently using the VGA with my desktop, but would like to also connect my laptop, which has VGA and HDMI outputs. </s>
<s> Which combination would be the most simple and inexpensive? </s>
<s> I've already tried VGA to DVI-D adapters, but quickly learned that I need a converter, which is too expensive. </s>
<s> Looking forward to your suggestions. </s>
<s> For the laptop VGA to VGA seems simple. </s>
<s> If the desktop has DVI you're done. </s>

<s> Use a KVM-switch then. </s>
<s> That serves to connect 1 monitor (that's the V for video) to 2 computers. </s>
<s> Don't use it for K (keyboard). </s>
<s> Your choice to use it for M (mouse). </s>
<s> I've never compared the price of a KVM-switch to a VGA-DVD-converter. </s>
<s> So I don't know if that isn't too expensive for you also. </s>

<s> Ok, I'm familiar with this, but I have to admit I'm surprised that this would be the simplest answer. </s>
<s> I was guessing it would be best to get an adapter for VGA to S-video, or VGA to component, or something similar, and just wanted to make certain that adapters such as these are analog, and efficient for this application. </s>
<s> I'll look into the KVM. </s>
<s> Thanks Kees. </s>
