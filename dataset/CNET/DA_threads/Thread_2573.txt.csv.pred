1.1.1	I moved the motherboard of a HP pavilion system from the HP case to a standard ATX case to allow for a larger power supply and better vid card.	St
1.1.2	I had been running it open case with the switch from the old computer becuase I couldnt figure out the plug for the case.	St
1.1.3	Stupid right?	St
1.1.4	Well now, I turned it off last night, and it wont turn on again.	St
1.1.5	I plug it in everything starts humming and moving EVEN IF THE POWER SWITCH ISNT CONNECTED!	St
1.1.6	Am I going to need a new motherboard, and wth happened to her overnight.	St
1.2.1	I should also mention that the moniter isnt getting any information to display.	St
1.3.1	Install componets with no case at all on a flat surface like cardboard or stiff plastic.	St
1.3.2	The power-ON switch is only a simple contact, find the wire harness that connects to pins that need only connect for a split moment to start system, use a simple split wiring strip to expose and touch the required pins.	St
1.3.3	Check results.	St
1.3.4	If system starts, then you had a short on the backside on some mtrbd.	St
1.3.5	against metal.	St
1.3.6	Some psus aren't really all that good if you brought the cheapest available, even with a higher wattage rating.	St
1.3.7	Too many come with impressive specs but are too good to be true for a real demanding system, so be sure to buy a decent brandname and they're more expensive for sure.	St
1.3.8	Check http://www.newegg.com to get an idea of pricing plus a source or any trusted online vendor.	St
1.3.9	tada -----Willy	St
