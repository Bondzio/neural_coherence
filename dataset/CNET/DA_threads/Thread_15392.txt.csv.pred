1.1.1	I 've got 2 WinXP desktops which have been directly networked through cabling .	St
1.1.2	One comp has an ADSL connection so it 's shared thru the network .	St
1.1.3	now I 've got a Centrino laptop which I want to bring in , and since the wiring slots on the desktops are taken up Im thinking of going wireless .	St
1.1.4	my laptop supports 802.11b/a .	St
1.1.5	I want to hook up my laptop so that I can share the net connection especially , and also share my files and printer .	St
1.1.6	Whats my best option ? ?	Ques
1.1.7	what hardware do I need to get ? ?	Ques
1.1.8	any recommendations ? ?	Ques
1.1.9	router ? ?	Ques
1.1.10	access point ? ?	Ques
1.1.11	about routers , something I dont understand is , my ADSL modem is a USB device , does it hook up direct to the router or thru a comp ?	Ques
1.1.12	( any hardware independant of a comp ? )	Ques
1.1.13	Also im concerned abt compatibility and performance .	St
1.2.1	Get a router .	St
1.2.2	Connect the router to the ADSL modem .	St
1.2.3	Connect each PC to the router .	St
1.2.4	Most routers offer wireless .	Sug
1.2.5	Avoid mixing brands .	St
1.2.6	My setup is all D-link .	St
1.2.7	Cable modem , router ( wireless for my laptop ) , three desktops wired , D-link NICs in the desktops , D-link wireless card in the laptop .	St
1.2.8	With this type of setup the D-link equipment discovers each piece and since they know each other , configuration is painless .	St
1.2.9	Good luck , Telephony facts , analog/digital explained .	Polite
1.2.10	See the CNet faces behind the posts .	St
1.2.11	I think computer viruses should count as life .	St
1.2.12	I think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive .	St

1.3.1	so the ADSL modem can run independantly , without a comp , if I get a router ?	Ques
1.3.2	?	Ques
1.4.1	You did n't say much about it except that it is currently connected to one of your computers via USB .	St
1.4.2	Do you know if it could be connected via an ethernet cable ?	Ques
1.4.3	If you do n't know , perhaps you could tell us the brand and model and who your ADSL provider is - a we can look up the specs .	Ques
1.4.4	My concern is this - there are a few cable modems/ DSL modems/ satellite receivers that connect to the user 's computer via USB only .	St
1.4.5	Others with USB capability also have an ethernet output ( but must be used either/or , not both ports ) .	St
1.4.6	The problem is that there are n't any mainstream wireless broadband routers that accept a USB input ; they all require ethernet input from the broadband modem .	St
1.4.7	If your ADSL modem is in the first category I mentioned - USB only - then you will need to & quot ; negotiate & quot ; with your DSL service provider for a new modem that has an ethernet output .	St
1.4.8	If your current modem is an either/or ( but you just happen to be using the USB side so that you could share the internet the other computer via Internet Connection Sharing on the main computer and a simple crossover cable to the second computer ) then you are good to go .	St
1.4.9	Get a wireless router , connect it to the modem via ethernet cable , connect the wired computers to it via more ethernet cables , set up the wireless configuration on the laptop , and use the USB cable for something else .	St
1.4.10	Regarding the ADSL modem being able to operate without a computer - yes , they all can operate without a computer .	St
1.4.11	The issue that you may be thinking of is PPPOE authentication and login .	St
1.4.12	If your service is PPPOE-based , then there must be a PPPOE client somewhere immediately upstream from the modem .	St
1.4.13	In a single computer setup , the client would be a software utility that loads and logs on when you boot .	St
1.4.14	In a multi-computer setup with a router , the router itself has the client built into its firmware .	St
1.4.15	When you set up the router , you enable the PPPOE client in a checkbox on the setup screen , put in your account ID and password , and from now on the router does it all .	St
1.4.16	You then have to uninstall/disable the old PPPOE client on the main system ( as you ca n't have both clients trying to open a connection ) .	St
1.4.17	HTH , dw	St
1.5.1	I searched on the web , this looks like my ADSL modem http : //www.chipweb.de/dsl/index.php ? menu=2 & id2=72 its a Prolink no it doesnt have any ethernet connectors , this is only the ADSL modem .	St
1.5.2	and yes I think it is PPPoE , remember that from the software setup .	St
1.5.3	hmm so now my only option is to get a router and place it instead of the crossover cable and connect the laptop thru that rite ?	Ques
1.5.4	( or get an adsl modem with router ? )	Ques
1.6.1	ahh , yes that does limit the options as I feared .	St
1.6.2	For starters , your best bet is to change out that modem .	St
1.6.3	However , a significant consideration for this is the specific technical details of your ADSL service .	St
1.6.4	There are several different methodologies for ADSL delivery and the modem has to be set exactly for what 's coming up the line from the central office .	St
1.6.5	You can often get a newer model that 's appropriate from your service provider just by asking .	St
1.6.6	So give them a call and see what they say .	St
1.6.7	If they flat out refuse to work with you on it , let us know who they are so we can research the details of their transmission protocols and determine what alternate modems could work .	St
1.6.8	( And we can also put out the word to the rest of the world not to do business with them ... but , honestly , I 'll be very surprised if they wo n't work with you on this . )	St
1.6.9	Otherwise , you going to have to leave the first PC in place to do the PPPOE and make the conversion from USB .	St
1.6.10	It would have to be running anytime you wanted another computer to access the internet - which is kinda stupid to have to put up with that .	St
1.6.11	As you surmised , the wireless router would be next in the chain .	St
1.6.12	dw	St
