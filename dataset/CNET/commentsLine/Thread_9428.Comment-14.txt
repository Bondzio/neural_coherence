i'm hopeing that my 2002 computer keeps going until i can replace it with a vista preinstalled system.
i don't want another computer with winxp preinstalled, because it seems to be a fundementally insecure operating system.
(and no, i don't want an apple computer, and i don't want to change to linux.)
