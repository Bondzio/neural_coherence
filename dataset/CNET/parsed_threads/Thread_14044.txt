<s> I have an HP 7200 series all-in-one printer with USB and ethernet connections. </s>
<s> I have 2 wireless laptops with access to the internet. </s>
<s> I want to buy some kind of wireless print sharer that will allow me to print from both laptops. </s>
<s> I do not need/want the printer itself to be hooked up to the company network. </s>
<s> All I want to do is print wirelessly from 2 laptops. </s>
<s> I guess I want to plug the ethernet connection on the printer to an ethernet connection on whatever wireless device I should by and thats all the physical connections I have to make. </s>
<s> I then just want to be able to print wirelessly from both laptops. </s>
<s> I have a wireless router that came with my laptop and couldn't make that work for this job. </s>
<s> What kind of hardware do I need? </s>
<s> Regards, Andy </s>
<s> Then plug that into your LAN and follow HP's instructions for printing over the LAN. </s>
<s> A print server would only serve to waste time and money. </s>

<s> I can't plug the printer into the LAN. </s>
<s> Well, I could but it wouldn't work. </s>
<s> All the computers, or anything else plugged into the LAN, at sikorsky have special chips in them. </s>
<s> No chip, no access. </s>

<s> Your IT staffer needs to get involved. </s>
<s> They have a secure LAN and even with a print server this will be quite a mess. </s>
<s> Let your IT staffer do their magic. </s>
