then you are going to re-discover the truth about this one.
hopefully you don't get too upset later.
it's odd to see you write about handwriting recognition.
that is, since when was it a digitizer issue?
or palm rejection?
you seem to write as if you are new to all this.
i fear you would buy such a thing and then write blogs or facebook how bad it is.
avoid all this and get out there and use these things.
then you will find out exactly why i have written the above.
