it's a nas and we don't partition nas products.
this is likely why no responses.
just create a directory (folder?)
for each system and save your copy there.
finally, this is not backup.
it fails basic rules about backup as in multiple copies, multiple media, off site storage, write protection and more.
it does make for a nice online copy.
