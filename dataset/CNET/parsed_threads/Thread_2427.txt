<s> I am running a wireless router and am wondering if I can also use a wireless keyboard and mouse. </s>
<s> Will I run into frequency problems if I have to many wireless items on my computers? </s>
<s> Does anyone know if this is a problem? </s>
<s> I would like to add a wireless keyboard and mouse to both computers in the house, but am not sure if this is even possible with the wireless router. </s>
<s> No conflict between my Linksys wireless router and my MS wireless keyboard and mouse. </s>
<s> They sit inches away from each other, I believe they are in different FQ ranges. </s>
<s> It is unlikely there will be any conflicts, even if they run the same, or nearly the same, frequency. </s>
<s> Sort of like if you were in a large room with a lot of people all talking, yet you are able to single out the one person who has your attention at the moment. </s>
<s> That same scenario becomes even more plain, if you add in the possibility that some of those people are talking different languages. </s>
<s> To hone in on just your language becomes even easier. </s>
<s> Back to the wireless scenario, there are different kinds of wireless, too. </s>
<s> There are wireless 802.11a standards that is a totally different frequency (5GHz) than 802.11b or g (2.4GHz), there is Bluetooth wireless (2.45GHz), there is 900Mhz wireless, there is infrared wireless (also a frequency, but it is in the light spectrum - far above the radio spectrum), lots of different kinds. </s>
<s> in my own case, I have a wireless keyboard and mouse, I have a wireless router and bridge (802.11b) and I also have a wireless phone (2.7GHz). </s>
<s> The only thing I get, that supposedly is a minor noise conflict is with the wireless phone that runs near the same frequency as the router. </s>
<s> I hear a slight &quot;click&quot; every few seconds in the phone. </s>
<s> It isn't bad, and the other party does not hear it at all. </s>
<s> The digital devices don't get that conflict at all. </s>
<s> Even if the items ran on the same frequency, there are bands, protocols, and other identifying factors used by matched devices and ignored by similar devices. </s>
<s> If, by some odd chance, there is any conflict, just keep your receipts, and return what gives you a problem. </s>
<s> I have had a wireless router and a Logitech Wireless Keyboard as well as a logitec wireless optical trackball for over a year and have yet to have a single problem... </s>
<s> The only thing is when I have my feet on the desk or I have the receiver hidden behind something, I tend to lose connection (about 3-4 feet of clutttered deskspace). </s>
<s> So I rake everything into the garbage can and then it works like a charm... </s>
