I don't know much about computer hardware so its been hard trying to figure this one out. I am trying to get my display shown on two moniters but I don't really want the extended desktop. Just want one moniter to show exactly whats on the other one.. Both Moniters support DVI cables and VGA cables and I was wondering is there a possible way to hook up one as VGA and one as DVI or what do i have to do to solve this problem? Thank you

I'm sorry if i can't be more specific since there a some variations on VGA software GUIs. there might be an easier way than this though, lets just wait for the others to look at your problem. but don't you worry, if there's anyone who can make your comoputing life easier, its the forum guys here. life is good

First is playing games or full screen applications. How can I maybe temporarily disable the mouse and put it into a hotkey from going to the other screen? That way i can play the game but when I want to move back to the other screen i enable the mouse to move there again so it can work. Seeing as how many games need you to maybe turn around or scroll the map it becomes annoying with the mouse constantly moving to the other side. Also how do i keep a full screen app from minimizing when something else is activated? Thank you again!
