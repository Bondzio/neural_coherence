It appears there is a basic problem with the mob of this Pavilion computer. I found some info indicating this device was only compatible with Win XP; the vendor failed to tell me this, I had assumed he would. Maybe he didn't know either. So I acknowledge I must purchase a new usb hub. But how do I ensure my next hub purchase is compatible with my HP Pavilion desktop? There is no mention of os's on the websites, only PC and/or Mac. I cannot afford to waste more money on dubious computer peripherals. Any input as to what (brands) to look for would be appreciated.

The fact that it will not boot to windows, but works when connected after boot up suggests that incompatability is the issue here. Am searching for usb 2.0 hub by better manufacturer. Thanx.

The front USB's work for other peripherals e.g. b/u drive. I prefer an AC powered hub to cover any power hungry devices in the future. I am still perplexed that other than preventing booting to Win 7, it works normally. As an aside, the green sound output jack on the rear panel has suddenly stopped functioning. In fact, have speakers connected to a front jack. Another reason to get the old dell 5150 functioning as a backup computer. I am now starting a special savings account for the purchase of my next new desktop, as it seems this Pavilion may be entering the croak phase. Thanx again for your input.

A bit of research tracked it down to a flaw in the BIOS HP sourced for this model. The name was &quot;InSyde&quot; and HP made it clear they had no means to correct the flaw. Keep in mind that it was not a flaw in the handful of smart phones, usb drives and hubs in this case. Bob

Meanwhile I think a Belkin product would likely be the best choice, although they never compatibility wiyh Win 7 OS. Thank you all for your input. &quot;Let the buyer beware&quot;
