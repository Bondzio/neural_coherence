1.1.1	Hi , In the very near future , when all the PS3 buzz settles down , I would like to purchase the PS3 unit along with the Gran Turismo HD ( as I 've invested in steering wheel/pedal hardware in the past ) .	St
1.1.2	And to certainly take advantage of the & quot ; high definition & quot ; output of the PS3 and GT HD , I would need a 1080i display .	St
1.1.3	But I do n't want to invest a couple of grand in a large 40 or 50-inch family room LCD/Plasma display , but instead would like to upgrade my current ViewSonic 17 & quot ; CRT monitor and get myself a either a standard or a widescreen LCD computer screen .	St
1.1.4	If that 's the case , would I be able to take the HD ( HDMI ? )	Ques
1.1.5	output of the PS3 and display it on the computer LCD screen ?	Ques
1.1.6	Would there be a conversion with cables/adaptors that I 'd have to use ?	Ques
1.1.7	The PS3 is already a big investment itself , so I 'd like to balance it out with a LCD display that would be used for my regular computer games , internet surfing , digital image editing , etc .	St
1.1.8	Appreciate anyone 's feedback !	St
1.1.9	Paul	St
1.2.1	does the monitor have .	St
1.2.2	If it has a DVI connector , then you can use an HDMI to DVI cable .	St
1.2.3	HDMI carries video and audio .	St
1.2.4	DVI carries only video .	St
1.2.5	If the monitor has no digital input you 're probably SOL .	St
1.3.1	as long as you buy a LCD monitor that is HDCP compliant and hook it up using an hdmi-dvi cable you should be fine .	St
1.3.2	i am building another pc and decided to get a 20inch widescreen lcd and it is hdcp capable and it works just great .	St
1.4.1	I know this is really late , but I found this post by searching google .	St
1.4.2	Once I hookup the hdmi to dvi cable and get video , how would you get sound ?	Ques
1.4.3	Would you just use the white and red cables that came with the TV hookups ?	Ques
1.4.4	Thanks	Polite
