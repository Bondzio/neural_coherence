Hi , Yes I do understand,its not the problem of ethernet cable.
Well the ethernet cable is connected to the RJ45 port of the ISP Modem directly and that ISP Modem has a DHCP enabled.I am connecting the other end of the ethernet cable to the laptop or to the desktop,but it is only the LAN connection on laptop which is having problem, not the desktop.
I have checked the TCP/IP settings on the LAN connection on the laptop ,it is all set to dynamic ,not to static.You would be surprised to know that I used this same laptop and connected it to the ethernet cable which was connected to a at home and it works fine their.
Sometimes even anti-viruses or firewalls block these connections but my winxp firewall is turned of and avast is not blocking any connections from DHCP.
So what could really be the problem?
