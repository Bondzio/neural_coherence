1.1.1	I have a home wireless network that works great in some areas and not so great in others , ( slow or drops connection ) I added a wireless access point which improved but would like to add another to expand.I have no problems connecting until I reach a certain point in my property line .	St
1.1.2	Will access points connect to each other or does an access point have to connect to a router ?	Ques
1.1.3	I have a Belkin router and Access Point with DSL .	St
1.2.1	but to be used in a school with two floors , a long hallway and cinder block walls .	St
1.2.2	Look into clustering or WDS .	St
1.2.3	From what I 'm reading you might be better off with access points of the same brand and model that can operate in these modes .	St
1.2.4	With WDS , only one device needs to be wired and the others can act as repeaters .	St
1.2.5	There are limitations and pitfalls , however .	St
1.3.1	repeaters , do so .	St
1.3.2	Read up about signal degradation , simplex , etc before committing .	St
1.3.3	RF do n't travel well through dense walls and floors .	St
1.3.4	You are better off bouncing signals off hard surfaces .	St
1.3.5	However that can create dead zones , so look into MIMO .	St
1.3.6	Practically any brand 's MIMO point can handle a 2000+ sq .	St
1.3.7	ft. home with ease .	St
1.3.8	For your school , ca n't you pull cable to other end of hallway and use a POE point ?	Ques
1.4.1	I posted a question about that a while back .	St
1.4.2	We 'd need a midspan or switch capable of providing the power .	St
1.4.3	Our short list of hardware includes a few 3Com 7760 PoE capable APs and either a 3Com or US Robotics PoE switch in the lower price ranges .	St
1.4.4	Pulling more Cat 5 is n't a problem but finding AC outlets at the best locations for the APs is .	St
1.4.5	That 's why PoE is being considered .	St
1.4.6	Only recently did funds turn up to plan in earnest .	St
1.4.7	I appreciate your mentioning problems with repeaters .	Polite
1.4.8	I 'm not an IT guy and , as a volunteer , I want stuff that works without a lot of care and feeding .	St
1.4.9	Unfortunately , the current batch of laptops at the school that would benefit from a wireless hot spot feature a bunch of 802.11 & quot ; a & quot ; s which travel in a cart that carries it 's own AP with it that needs to be plugged into the classroom ports for use .	St
1.4.10	What we implement will need to be as compatible as possible with what we already have to live with unless a money tree appears in the school yard .	St
1.4.11	Thanks again .	St
1.4.12	I do n't want to hijack this thread and I hope such discussion will be useful to originator .	St
1.4.13	There 's plenty to read on this common issue .	St
1.5.1	Reading http : //kbserver.netgear.com/kb_web_files/n101236.asp and similar from the other makers this is easy once you know how .	St
1.5.2	In closing did you put your router in the basement ?	Ques
1.6.1	or the money tree has n't sprouted yet due to a never ending winter ( Phil did say 6 more weeks , which should be ending this Saturday !	St
1.6.2	) , here is a device you might consider http : //www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/wireless/ps5678/ps6973/ps8382/product_data_sheet0900aecd806b7c5c.html	St
1.7.1	This cost of this device , however , would fetch 5 of the 3Com units .	St
1.7.2	It does n't list the PoE standard either but I do think Cisco makes their own power injectors for some models .	St
1.7.3	No doubt it has features and management capabilities that would n't be used in this school ... .partially because no one there would know how .	St
1.7.4	It 's nice to think big but we need to live with reality .	St
1.7.5	It 's not a big school ... K-8 with a capacity of about 250 kids plus the staff .	St
1.7.6	I 'm hoping to get by with 3 or 4 APs and a small capacity but rack mountable switch that can power them .	St
1.7.7	I 'm hoping to propose we can do the project for under $ 1500 .	St
1.7.8	I can get a spool of Cat-5 donated so that will help .	St
1.8.1	but make sure you evaluate the effectiveness of one before committing to more .	St
1.8.2	XR is an improvement for a/b/g but it is n't as good as MIMO .	St
1.8.3	There are some MIMO-XR units in the market but they are from small companies .	St
1.8.4	If you choose it , again make sure their firmware supports features that you need .	St
1.8.5	Good luck in your project .	Polite
