Backup is when you have a copy.
Now let's say you have a copy on your PC and that flash drive.
That's barely a backup since when the PC is wiped out you only have the original and no copy.
Thus no backup.
-&gt; Try the stick in some other machine next.
Maybe your host machine is missing drivers after a reload.
But I don't see that in the story so that would be me guessing badly.
