<s> I have a custom desktop with an Intel DX48T2 motherboard. </s>
<s> In an penny-pinching effort, I decided to go with the motherboard's onboard sound. </s>
<s> After I downloaded the sound drivers from Windows update, I noticed that there was no sound. </s>
<s> I have also noticed that one of the sound drivers was an HD Audio driver. </s>
<s> Does the HD Audio driver need special speakers in order to get sound from them? </s>
<s> My current PC speakers, while still working well, are approx 5 or so years old. </s>
<s> If it's not a speaker issue, I may just get that soundcard after all. </s>
<s> &quot;After I downloaded the sound drivers from Windows update, I noticed that there was no sound.&quot; Microsoft isn't the place for drivers. </s>
<s> Go back to before that with System Restore. </s>
<s> Microsoft's updates have worked more often for me than not (hardware wise), so that's why I didn't think much of it at the time. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> The old speakers if they worked before are fine. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Sometimes people overlook the speaker selection in some control panel (there is no standard here.) </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Be sure to google MS UAA DRIVERS Bob </s>
