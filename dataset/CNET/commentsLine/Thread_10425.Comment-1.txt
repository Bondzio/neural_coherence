i was never interested in going wireless until i saw my bro' in laws access point linked to his cable modem, and was surprised at the speed using 802.11b.
he doesn't have a network, as i do, which is hardwired.
here's the question: can i link a wireless router to my existing router and still be networked?
or will this only enable me to surf the net?
i was looking for a cheap, access point kinda setup, but all i can find on the net are wireless routers (well, on newegg and tigerdirect.)
this is mainly for my laptop, and possibly later for my daughter's machine.
i'll keep my system hardwired.
so, is this doable?
if you're interested, here's a link to the wireless router, which is a netgear; i helped my br' in law reinstall windows, and was surprised how quickly setting it up was, but again, he doesn't have a network, and only uses an access point (if that's the proper term for the thing that's allow wireless, but not being a router.)
oh, i also intend to use a usb adapter for the laptop/my daughters system; same as my 'bro in law.
tia.
