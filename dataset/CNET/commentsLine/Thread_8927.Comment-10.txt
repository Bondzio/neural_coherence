first off, knowing nothing about u, i'm surprised, u never seen an lcd in person (at work, school, internet cafe, or retailer like best buy/staples that sell pc stuff) if true.
ppl who wanna pinch pennies, have big area for less $$, graphics/image, or hardcore gamers artists spring for crt the tradeoffs are: crt -more viewing area for less $$ -no ghosting -no dead stuck pixels -better color accuracy -better overall for graphic, image work, certain movies, or certain gaming lcd -less footprint -easier on eyes -much less bulkier -weighs much less -saves on electricity bill -some can screen pivot for portrait mode view -height adjustable for ghosting, this is very subjective.
my dell ultrasharp 18.1&quot; lcd has a response of 30ms!!
but i haven't noticed any ghosting whatsoever.
however, i don't play alot of fast motion games or movies.
furthermore, i probably couldn't tell if there was ghosting anyways.
roughly &lt;16ms is good for 'extreme' gaming.
use it as a guideline only tho, as some ppl have reported one lcd having lower response time to show more ghosting than another lcd (different brand/model) with a higher response time.
ultimately, your own eyes need to be the judge for ghsointg you're not a video/image professional, and $$ is not object.
lcd oughtta work out for u. the last 2 lcd pros are minor.
lcds are light enough that u could always put yours on a a block of wood or phonebook to get more height, and while it's nice to view certain word docs and internet pages in portrait, few, if any games actually support portrait mode the less weight is nice for me.
i highly prefer to have at least 18&quot; viewing area.
a crt of that size would weigh 66 lbs and up.
my current dell lcd can be easily picked up with one hand, and i don't really work out.
small footprint it nice since i didn't have a monstrously huge deskspace at my old house.
