well, i got another tip to plug the cpu fan into the power fan connector on the motherboard to test if it was the heat sink unit.
this powers the fan and lets me run the box.
i'm still curious if the 8 pin connector will resolve the issue with the proper connector and will post an update on that.
if it does not (which would mean the cpu fan connector is defective), i can live without the fan speed throttling that the cpu fan connector would enable.
i would like to invest in more exotic cooling mechanisms down the line anyhow.
i'm curious though, currently i get a warning on bootup &quot;cpu fan error!&quot; not having clean boots could get annoying.
how do other cpu cooling devices (like water or oil immersion) work?
would they plug into the cpu fan connector to resolve this?
there may also be a bios setting that i can change to fix this.
i'll update this thread with the 8-pin connector results.
thanks to willy for the advice!
