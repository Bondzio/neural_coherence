<s> Hello and thanks for any help. </s>
<s> I have a new desk top, Dell 530S, o.s. </s>
<s> Vista and a nine year old Dell Dimension XPS--o.s. </s>
<s> Windows 98, second edition. </s>
<s> I'm connected to the internet on the new computer with the wired modem I had on the old computer. </s>
<s> I want to connect the old computer, now in another room, to the internet through the new computer's internet connection--Is this possible and what do I need to do this? </s>
<s> I have ordered a wireless router, a Belkin n+ 802.11 n, but do I also need another wireless card for the old computer --as you can see, I don't understand what I need. </s>
<s> Do I need a USB adapter?? </s>
<s> (not sure what that is --or an Access Point?--not sure what that is either. </s>
<s> I appreciate any answers. </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
<s> ....I'm breathless just from reading it. </s>
<s> As far as I can tell you have a coupla probs -- were both systems using the same version of Windows (preferably XP) you could do simple Internet Connection Sharing. </s>
<s> That would involve linking the internet connected computer to the older one with an ethernet cable and running Windows ICS. </s>
<s> Whether this will work linking 98 and Vista is an interesting one. </s>
<s> So your best bet is probably to buy a wireless adapter which has drivers for 98. </s>
<s> Personally, with a desktop machine I would buy a PCI device, but USB will work. </s>
<s> The wireless adapter will allow the old machine to make a direct link to your wireless router without bothering the new machine. </s>
<s> However you will find that setting up a network connection is more difficult on 98 than it was with Vista and I would suggest you get someone knowledgable to help. </s>
<s> Though I had 20 years PC experience I had a software engineer friend set up my old 98 machine's wireless for me and it took some time and fiddling -- with XP I could set it up myself. </s>
<s> I appreciate your reply--you have clarified some of the concerns I have about this. </s>
<s> I have a couple of questions: What is Windows ICS (I don't understand the acronym ICS). </s>
<s> Also what is a PCI device? </s>
<s> As you can see, I am a novice at this. </s>
<s> Also, do I attach the &quot;wireless adapter&quot; to the old computer or the new one? </s>
<s> And the same with this router that should come in the mail today--it connects to the modem I have,so it has to be next to the new computer, right? </s>
<s> Thank you so much for your help! </s>
<s> I'm beginning to think that trying to connect my old computer to the internet isn't worth it. </s>
<s> Thank you, rain2snow </s>
<s> Internet Connection Sharing (as mentioned in earlier post). </s>
<s> PCI is the standard slot for adding boards to a PC motherboard. </s>
<s> If your are not happy opening the computer use USB. </s>
<s> You install the wireless adapter to the machine which presently lacks internet access (I guess the old one). </s>
<s> The router's connection depends on the type of internet feed you have. </s>
<s> If you have cable you will probably add a simple wireless router to the cable modem. </s>
<s> I assume the router is coming from the ISP in which case it should carry instructions for linking to modem. </s>
<s> If you have ADSL (phone line feed) you probably replace the modem with the router (which is more accurately called a wireless router/modem). </s>
<s> To do this successfully you may need help from ISP on WAN settings. </s>
<s> Rather than abandon the idea of connecting the old computer to the internet you might try installing a newer operating system. </s>
<s> Not Vista (obviously) but I currently run XP on a laptop with a Pentium2 600mhz processor. </s>
<s> Hello fihart, I apprecitae your help, and now I will try all your suggestions. </s>
<s> Thanks for your time and valuable help! </s>
