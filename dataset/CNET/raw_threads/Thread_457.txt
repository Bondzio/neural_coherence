I have to recycle the modem/routers one at a time in wired order to get things back to normal. is there a way to do something so i wouldn't have to do that (in case the power goes off when i'm not around and neighbors using the wifi can get on)? also this pcx 2500 modem, I pay $3 to rcn for it, it's 2 years old at least, is this thing up to date technology? thank you -- fj

Since we are looking at such small power usage, the UPS may be the cheap cure. Bob
