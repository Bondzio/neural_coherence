hey i got my dvd burner today and installed it.
it is pretty cool.
i have watched a dvd, but not burned anything yet.
i got some dual layer discs, and am waiting on some lightscribe ones.
i have a couple of questions.
in my old setup, both of the drives were setup in the 1/4 position (i guess it is neutral).
i guess neither of them were master or slave.
my new drive was setup as the master.
i did not change this.
will this cause problems, and should i change the old drive to slave?
also, when i was in bios?, i got the impression that i could have used the unused sata output for a sata burner.
am i wrong?
i kind of hope i am cause lg has an sata burner that reads hd and blueray.
thanks
