I am looking at getting a Linksys WRT350N router and a Maxtor 750GB One Touch III from Office Depot.
We have 4 computers on the network 1 being wired and the rest wireless.
All the computers that are wireless have draft n. But 2 of them our macs.
What i want to do is connect the Hard Drive to the router and have it on the network for my parents when they offload photos onto there mac computer and have a backup of them.
Will this even work?
And what do you thing of the products?
