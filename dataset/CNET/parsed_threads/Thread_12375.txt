<s> I have a TubeMagic DAC that connects to my computer via USB. </s>
<s> I first noticed a popping sound coming from the DAC hardware box when the silent loading screens initiated in SpecOps: The Line. </s>
<s> I later noticed popping in the speakers during movie playback and during the first few notes of any song in Winamp. </s>
<s> Progression and location of events; works box is popping while plugged into real USB port &gt; plug into externally AC powered USB hob and works fine. </s>
<s> starts popping a month later. </s>
<s> &gt; plug into front usb ports and second hub, notice sound is louder and no pops. </s>
<s> Anyone have any clue as to the likely cause? </s>
<s> Static in the motherboard? </s>
<s> Underpowered/overpowered USB ports? </s>
<s> Drivers? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Yes, other peripheral devices, including a Xmod USB sound card work fine. </s>
<s> I've heard numerous people make similar complaints about static and popping with the TubeMagic but nobody seems to have found the culprit. </s>
<s> I think I've localized the problem to motherboard static, USB power surges or voltage under supply, and/or drivers. </s>
<s> I'd sincerely appreciate any guesses as how plausible any of these possible causes are for static and popping through the speakers alongside a &quot;popping&quot; from the DAC. </s>
<s> Two types of &quot;pops&quot; sound from the actual hardware. </s>
<s> One sounds like a jittering buzz I associate with static. </s>
<s> The other is a &quot;clicking&quot; sound identical to that made by a XonarSTX on start up or when switching modes. </s>
<s> I'm not worried about this second type, as I understand that is the sound of transistors powering up. </s>
<s> But are having a hard time accepting that the product has a defect. </s>
<s> Since it is defective, return it and don't use it again. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It's not defective under all circumstances. </s>
<s> It's only problematic depending on what USB port it is plugged into. </s>
<s> And does not work in all ports. </s>
<s> All this means is that there is no reason to keep it unless you can live with a crappy thing. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for your help, Bob. </s>
<s> I'm confident you're right that it's a hardware malfunction but I'm trending toward thinking the problem is due to a design defect. </s>
<s> One more question, are you familiar enough with hardware to make a suggestion on what might cause the hardware to emit a static buzz at times? </s>
<s> I'm more interested in finding a cause than a solution (solution being: as you suggest, returning a poorly designed device). </s>
<s> It's a long list of things from a driver issue to power available on the USB port. </s>
<s> I get those USB DAC things for 2 to 3 bucks to my mailbox to sub in for failed onboard audio. </s>
<s> So when I get a bum one I give it to a buddy that seems to want to try to fix everything. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Now you know why some devices cost more than others for the same function. </s>
<s> Audio bounds, but solutions are sometimes build-in to better handle them. </s>
<s> Seeing some DAC devices handling low voltages, etc. </s>
<s> and then the make-up of the components, you wonder if it can handle as they are easily over-whelmed it seems to me at times. </s>
<s> Just the plain fact, you get a pop is not unheard of as being-ON just got an unwanted audio response. </s>
<s> Just cranking up the audio may cause a &quot;hum&quot; from speakers in just about any audio system. </s>
<s> So, you get what you pay for, IMHO. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Thank you Willy and Bob. </s>
<s> You both make great points. </s>
<s> I did buy an entry level audiophile DAC and I do sense that the produce is being &quot;overwhelmed&quot; by electrical signals as Willy comments. </s>
<s> I couldn't figure out how to close the thread after Bob's last response which I found satisfactory. </s>
<s> I had the same problem with a user installed Creative Sound card. </s>
<s> I found the DAC lines into the card to be hanging near the power for a DVD drive. </s>
<s> After wrapping and grounding foil over the digital lines and dressing the power lines from the PS solved the popping and clicks and even reduced some hum. </s>
