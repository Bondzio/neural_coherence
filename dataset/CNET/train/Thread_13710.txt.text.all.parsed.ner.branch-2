1283	1	47432	562753	562613	sbaig	11/24/04 4:09 am	1.10126934e12	re: the fastest cpu	i am not so educated on the g5. however, the fastest processor for amd is the fx-55 and its specs are 2600/1024/htt. and the fastest for intel is the pentium 4 570j and its specs are 3800/1024/800. as christmas nears, intel will release a new p4ee and we will retake the market. that p4ee will be the fastest and its specs will be 3733/2048/1066 making for a speed daemon processor.

1283	7	47432	1093687	1093439	john robie	4/2/05 11:19 am	1.11244074e12	yes......	the amd fx-55 is faster, but you probably have to be a spoiled rich kid, or make a pretty good wage, to buy the fx-55 from $816-$840 (processor alone - newegg).
