I have a HP Vectra VLi8 SFF Desktop PC (PIII,600 MHz,320MB RAM)with a sleek CD-ROM (like the ones used in a laptop). This cd-rom has a strage problem. Earlier there used to be no problem with the cd-rom. But lately, it is recongnizing only the CD's that are either purchased from a software vendor or that come with the hardware. It is not recongnizing the CD's that are written using a CD writer. So I have got a heap of CD's that were recognized earlier but of no use now. But these CD's are perfect and run well when tried on other systems.Can anyone plz. help?

Can I use a commercially available cleaning kit to clean the lens and the drive instead of actually buying a new one?

I use any number of replacement make/model CDRW/DVD drives today. CDROM drives seem to be out of production now. Bob
