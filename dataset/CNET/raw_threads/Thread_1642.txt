I know I can't get much for a price range of strictly $500-$700, but can someone help me out? I need to know what is the best computer I can get in terms of HD memory, RAM, Video, and basically just overall stats. Thanks in Advance

Of course I'd love it to come with a mouse, keyboard, etc but that's just asking too much. I just want the best --computer-- I can get for my price range.

I had my wife's PC within 6 days of ordering, and that was 4 days before they anticipated shipping it. They usually have a rebate and several free upgrades going on. I got her a free HD and CD-RW drive upgrade by procrastinating a day or two.

I've searched but I' m just reluctant to buy from seemingly unknown &quot;companies&quot; that's why I'm here. I don't need my computer to be brand name...I just need it to have what I need. Basically my question is, and this may depend on different opinions, what is the best all-around I can get for $700? Thanks foir the suggestions though

Are you a gamer, or like to edit photos or videos, or do you just run home office type apps? A good local system builder could help you determine exactly what your needs are and design a system to meet your needs. i.e., if you don't need high end graphics, and an on-board video chip would suffice, you could spend the extra money on memory, hard drive or faster CPU. Spending extra on memory is better than pinching your budget on memory for a faster CPU. Just a few thoughts, hope this helps.

Well I'm not a gamer but I play a few games like Knight of the Old Republic which thi computer no longer allows me to use. I need memory because I'm a frequent downloader, although I do take care of my computer. I wouldn't mind a better-than-average video card but not somehing top of the line. I'd also like at least 512-1 GIG RAM since that seems to be the standard now. Someone please help me in choosing a model. I'll answer any other questions if you'll help me, I just don't know what to do.

I'm trying to get the best computer I can because i can just use this monitor. My main interest is getting the best computer I can.

HP/Compaq puts the minimum in their pc's to keep costs down. http://www.newegg.com/ProductSort/Subcategory.asp?Subcategory=48
6928	14	161635	1798644	1798484	MGCurious	3/9/06 4:35 PM	1.1419221E12	Video Cards	At Costco.com these are the video cards I can choose from: Integrated ATI Radeon Xpress HyperMemory [included] NVIDIA GeForce 6200SE w/TurboCache 256MB support [add $62.00] 256MB DDR ATI Radeon X1300 Pro [add $153.00] The final price with the ATI Radeon Express which is the basic one is $610 so I need a not-too-cheap-but-okay-video card. I know I seem to be asking a lot of questions but I really need a good computer so I don't blow all my money on this one and have to buy another in the near future.

Here's a video card that's cheaper than the ATI and performs better. You will also need a new power supply; the standard one doesn't provide enough power for a seperate video card. The first link is the video card; the second one is the power supply. A link takes you to another page. To go to that other page, click on the link. The link will be blue, and when you move your mouse so that the little cursor is on top of the link, the link will become underlined.

You'll be able to run multiple apps at once w/o slowdown, and it will play the latest games at medium settings with good frame rates.

And the Compaq price is already including a new video card and power supply. I'm not going to buy it just yet though, there's no possible way. Like I said before, I need 371 more dollars so there's plenty of time for something better to pop up. Until then though, my sights will be set on the Compaq but please, keep suggesting people. I'm afraid I may have failed to mention a few things I want on the computer: Floppy Drive CD/DVD Burner 1 GB RAM At least 100GB HD I don't care if it comes with a monitor or speakers. In any case, I'll just buy one later when I have money, I mean, this monitor and speakers will still work.
