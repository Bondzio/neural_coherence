<s> Is their a way to mirror two drives on a win2000 pro box without upgrading to win2000 server? </s>
<s> Third party software may be an option. </s>
<s> Use SCOPY to copy the drive daily from one to the other. </s>
<s> Better yet, use ACRONIS to save an image when you like to the other drive. </s>

<s> i.e. </s>
<s> , writing to the two drives simultaneously, is a hardware matter -- you need a RAID controller, and it must be configured as RAID 1. </s>
<s> (RAID 0 is striping, which is faster but without redundancy and with a greater chance of failure.) </s>
<s> Bob's workaround is, in essence, backup; this does have some advantages. </s>
<s> A major disadvantage, however, is that backups take time. </s>
<s> If I were going that route I would, as Bob recommends, choose Acronis True Image. </s>
<s> To save time, those important things needing frequent backup -- mainly data & documents -- in a separate partition, and then do partition imaging. </s>
<s> IMHO, the same idea applies to a RAID 1 system. </s>
<s> In my case the single C drive contains the OS, program files, relatively unimportant data, and other items that do not change frequently. </s>
<s> This drive is backed up only as needed. </s>
<s> My D drive, which is a pair of drives i RAID 1 configuration, gets the more important and changable data. </s>
<s> Hope this helps Frank </s>
