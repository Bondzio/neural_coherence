Will this work for cable internet? http://cgi.ebay.com/NETGEAR-WIRELESS-N-300-DGN2200-DSL-WIRELESS-ROUTER-/320536639681?cmd=ViewItem&pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item4aa178f8c1 Thanks.

By the looks of it though, I do not think I will be able to use it. I emailed the guy about the shipping cost and he said that he is mailing it in a medium flat rate box and that USPS charges around twelve dollars for it.
