<s> Our accountants are heavy multitaskers. </s>
<s> They run large tax programs, finance programs (Quickbooks Pro), internet explorer (research), email, messaging, and tax research software all at once. </s>
<s> We Norton ghost backup everything every two hours to net storage, so that, along with printing (lots), is often going on in the background. </s>
<s> A second nic card saves us time here, but these folks occasionally push 32 bit XP beyond its memory capacity. </s>
<s> We get hangs that are clearly memory related. </s>
<s> Obviously, productivity is a concern when all this stuff is running concurrently. </s>
<s> Given these non-gaming, non-multimedia tasks, what is the best processor for these professionals. </s>
<s> It would seem that Intel's i5 and i7 and quads are overkill in all the wrong areas. </s>
<s> Should we stick with </s>
<s> Oops. </s>
<s> Need to finish my question. </s>
<s> Should we stick with Intel duo processors, 64 bit Microsoft 7, and lots of memory? </s>
<s> Or go up to these new offerings from Intel. </s>
<s> MOney is NOT and issue here. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I saw benchmark data that made it look like quads are great for multimedia, audio, photoshop, number crunching, etc. </s>
<s> but they perform worse than duos for productivity software (MSOffice), messaging, file transfers, etc. </s>
<s> I have no axe to grind. </s>
<s> Just hoping someone will steer me to the fastest computer I can buy for the the things my accountants do on a daily basis. </s>
<s> Intel's new Core i7 is not just for Gaming and multimedia. </s>
<s> Core i7 is a quad-core processor with hyper-threading (each core capable of handling two threads) means that Core i7s look like 8-core processors in Windows and are idea for multitasking. </s>
<s> If budget is not a concern then I would suggest a Core i7-860. </s>
<s> Core i5 is not a bad choice either and will probably be more readily available in SMB systems. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>

<s> I see you are an Intel evangelist...which is fine. </s>
<s> I read that most of the day to day business software out there does not take advantage of the quad core architecture. </s>
<s> That was the basis for my question about getting a fast duo instead. </s>
<s> Sorry, it was Google. </s>
<s> I used i7 vs i5, i7 vs quad core, quad core vs duo core and just read what ever popped up. </s>
<s> The comment I saw on the duo was from a guy at intel. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Correct not all software today is multi-threaded which is why Turbo is so important as a feature (Found only on Core i7 and Core i5) Turbo allows a processor to increase frequency IF there is are fewer SW threads than there are cores on the processor. </s>
<s> So e.g. </s>
<s> 2.85 GHz quad-core can actually ratchet up to over 3 GHz when there is processor &quot;headroom&quot;. </s>
<s> BUT as I mentioned at the start of the thread not all SW is multi-threaded today but think about what your PC needs will be in 3-5 years from now. </s>
<s> Whether Core i7 or Core i5 you will be making a good choice. </s>
<s> TimWoodChip Disclosure: TimWoodChip is an Intel employee and aspirational sponsor of tomorrow. </s>
<s> Thanks woodchip. </s>
<s> I'll go i7. </s>
<s> The irony is, that in three years, when I am replacing this computer, Intel will be offering an i14 and it will be too advanced for the software current then. </s>
<s> By the way, just how much wood could a woodchip chip if a woodchip... </s>
<s> windows 7 good performance ...but very bad vista... </s>
<s> Its amazing no one actualy answered the question. </s>
<s> Computer guys can drive you crazy. </s>
<s> Accounting software aka Caseware, Taxprep, jazz-it are not made for multi-core processors. </s>
<s> So don't kill your self about quad i5 i7 etc. </s>
<s> Get a high frequency dual core with windows 7 and max out the memory i would say 1 to 2 GB per open program. </s>
<s> Freezing is also caused by cheap video cards. </s>
<s> Get a dedicated video card with 512 mb it will refresh faster. </s>
<s> Note dont go cheap get the real ATI card not a cheap copy. </s>
<s> Why are you not making a dual image of your hard drive in case one fails. </s>
<s> You're running a resource heavy system to begin with. </s>
<s> If you actually want performance increase, you'd go to a RISC type of processor and a system that can utilize such. </s>
<s> I run 3d graphics rendering, multiple traceroutes, nmap, qemu, LAME, xine, firefox, multiple builds, konqueror. </s>
<s> In the VM I will run firefox, make, traceroute, etc. </s>
<s> I'm using a Sempron 3400+. </s>
<s> I can also run instant messaging on both. </s>
<s> The difference is that I am using FreeBSD or Debian to do all of this. </s>
<s> Thanks for you reply. </s>
<s> Thus far, it is the only one that makes real sense to me. </s>
<s> I am hep to the graphics card. </s>
<s> I AM making a dual image. </s>
<s> It is a Ghost image. </s>
<s> Nerd. </s>
<s> But thanks. </s>
<s> You're welcome. </s>
<s> I'm a &quot;nerd&quot; who does physical labor. </s>
<s> Scary, isn't it, that the proles are more intelligent than the gentry. </s>
