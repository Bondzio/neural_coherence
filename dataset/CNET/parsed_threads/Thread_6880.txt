<s> I have a seagate goflex network drive (connected to router w/ ethernet cable) that I store all my pictures, movies, and files on. </s>
<s> It is connected to every computer in the house and is constantly being changed. </s>
<s> I was just thinking the other day that if this drive goes down, we're pretty much screwed, so I got a backup drive, a seagate goflex desk (works through usb, which is also connected to router). </s>
<s> After the initial copy paste of files from one to the other, how can I set these two up so that if you copy files to one, it will also automatically be copied to the other?? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>
<s> -I work on both mac and pc </s>
<s> But I've used Syncback and Goodsync to do this. </s>

<s> SyncToy (Developed Microsoft, free) can sync folders including shared folders in different computers. </s>
<s> More safer methods are: 1. establish RAID(such as RAID 5) with multiple hard drives in your Network Attached Storage, so one hard drive failure of all hard drives won't destory your data. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Scheduly backup your important data to another location. </s>
<s> I use Total Backup & Recovery( http://www.farstone.com/software/totalrecovery-pro.php ) to do this job. </s>
<s> I've yet to see that save the day. </s>
<s> Katrina taught us again that if we don't backup to off site then RAID won't help for the usual fire, wind, flood and lightning strikes. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yes, you are right. </s>
<s> Total Recovery Pro( http://www.farstone.com/software/totalrecovery-pro.php ) has a function called Offsite copy can help you avoid disasters of local site. </s>
<s> The function uses FTP to upload your backup images to remote FTP site; so you can get back your data from that site. </s>
<s> Another way is using Online Backup. </s>
<s> Online Backup will backup files/folders to Internet, but it may take you some money by calculating the data size. </s>
<s> What I use can do this already. </s>
