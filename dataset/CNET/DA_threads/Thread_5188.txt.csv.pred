1.1.1	I have a general question this morning.	St
1.1.2	I've been doing fine with my laptop to router signal for the most part.	St
1.1.3	However, every now and then, about every 4 or 5 days, I may loose connection for some reason.	St
1.1.4	I have found that the easiest way to fix the issue, is unplug the router, take a bathroom break and voila.	St
1.1.5	Should I be worried about any long term affects from doing this?	St
1.1.6	I have a dlink WBR1310.	St
1.1.7	Settings are on TKIP, PSK, WPA Enhanced.	St
1.1.8	Any comment or feedback appreciated.	Polite
1.2.1	To a common problem.	St
1.2.2	I have to ask if you completed the steps and advice you find in our forum top post (called stickies) and reference posts 2, 3 and the one about Vista's BROADCAST FLAG.	St
1.2.3	bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the info, I changed my settings to WPA2 and AES.	St
1.3.2	Any other suggestion or advice.	St
1.3.3	I didn't see any post or sticky about Vista.	St
1.4.1	Notes to pull back to just WPA.	St
1.4.2	And you can do further research about Vista's BROADCAST FLAG on google.	St
1.4.3	The sticky post about it is the one about Vista machines that have trouble connecting to routers but you can just google up VISTA BROADCAST FLAG to decide what you want to do about that.	St
1.4.4	Here I just disable it to avoid the issue.	St
