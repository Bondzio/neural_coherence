reading  it's for windows phone so the answer is that it won't run on windows 7 (the os.)
there are tablets that run windows 7 and you can run office on those.
but then that's not &quot;office mobile&quot; is it?
is just one of the handful of windows 7 tablets.
before i would consider that i'd pick up one of the new ultrabooks.
