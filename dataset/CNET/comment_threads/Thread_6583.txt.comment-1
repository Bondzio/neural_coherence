I've got a new PC: HP Pavilion 1630n.
ADSL is connected with a copperjet 810 modem using my LAN.
Now I would like to share the ADSL with 2 more computers, but my ethernet port is taken by the modem.
Question is: Can I install a second ethernet card in my machine, and connect the two other computers with a crossover cable (via a US Robotics Broadband Router) If the answer is Yes, please specify what Ethernet Card is needed.
Your advice will be cert much appreciated Regards Leo
