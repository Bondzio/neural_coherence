<s> hi everyone, im looking for a storage solution. </s>
<s> i need it to be a usb 3.0 and an internal sata 3 6gbit/s interface. </s>
<s> 3.5&quot; in size that needs no external power. </s>
<s> thanks in advance Roman </s>
<s> Does your PC support USB3? </s>
<s> Few do. </s>
<s> its a lenovo w510. </s>
<s> I believe it does, i got supertalent usb 3.0 flash drive, works like a beast. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Store/SubCategory.aspx?SubCategory=92&name=External-Enclosures </s>
<s> if no 3.5 then 2.5. if a compatible drive is available. </s>
<s> i believe that there is no sata III interface enclosure out there in the options. </s>
<s> please advise... </s>
<s> your requirement is..no external power. </s>
<s> I believe any 3.5 harddrive will require extenal power to be effective (just my opinion). </s>
<s> is there any chance to use multiple jacks, like 2 or 4 usb ports to power the enclosure? </s>
<s> that are self powered USB are for laptop drives. </s>
<s> I don't know; but do you have such cable or are you going to make your own? </s>
<s> Give it a try and let us know. </s>
<s> Is not that complicated, it requires more motivation than skill. </s>
<s> USB 2.0 Ports are minimum 100ma of current supply - in desktops. </s>
<s> USB 3.0 Ports have a greater supply of current, at-least in theory they have 500ma of supply - again in desktops. </s>
<s> What about laptops, i cant get that information from lenovo, if someone has that information it would be great. </s>
<s> the features re drive capacity, power, port types, drive size, internal interface etc., you want. </s>
<s> The loss of speed would be negligible and the choices of external enclosures is endless depending on your criteria. </s>
<s> Later when USA 3.0 enclosures are available...you can switch. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> usb 3.0 are available its that sata 3 aren't. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> $19 for a case and $19 for a controller. </s>
<s> It's not so if it can hit 2/3 of its max. </s>
<s> target (5Mbps). </s>
<s> 5Gb vs. 6Gb. </s>
