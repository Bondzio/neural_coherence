linkit is giving you good information.
faster ram than the manufacturer calls for will not speed up your system any more than putting 200mph capable tires will make a stock chevy vega into a racing machine.
it's speed will remain the same.
check your bios for a ram setting referring to spd.
this is a chip on the memory module that provides it's capabilities to the mb so the ram can be automatically configured.
if your system (and most will be) are spd capable, your bios will configure the ram for best performance.
you are free...at your own risk....to override the automatic settings.
my preference would be to always get two sticks rather than one.
buy double what the os and applications state to be minimum requirements.
one reason to buy two sticks is that, if one fails or gets quirky, you can run on one stick to troubleshoot and keep your system operational.
also remember that, if you increase your ram, windows will increase the size of the page file (virtual memory).
i have never figured out the logic to this.
i tend to manually trim back the page file size as it takes up more total disk space.
that's probably not an issue for most but it increases the time needed to back up my system using the scheme i have in place.
