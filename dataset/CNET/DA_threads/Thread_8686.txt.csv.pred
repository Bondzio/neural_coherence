1.1.1	Okay I will try and explain this best I can.	St
1.1.2	I am not a networking pro but I know enough that this is pissing me off and there is probably a real simple fix.	St
1.1.3	I have access to my linkstation through the browser and I can add folders through that access but when I installed the linkstation it failed to map the drive and it is not showing up in the my computer folder.	St
1.1.4	Now with that being said I cannot find or use nero to burn something from the drive because it does not see it.	St
1.1.5	I have not tried mapping the folders on the drive and I do not know if that is even possible so I figured I would ask first before doing anything crazy that I would not be happy with anyway.	St
1.1.6	I am running NIS 2009 with a Linksys router.	St
1.1.7	Any and all help will be greatly appreciated.	St
1.2.1	I forgot to put the model number HS-DH500GL	St
