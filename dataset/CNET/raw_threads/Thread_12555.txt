The fan on the video card is making all kinds of noise and rather than replace the whole computer, I'd rather find a good replacement for the video card; however, I'm not find any replacements when I Google it. Does anyone know of where to find these older generation cards and maybe even an upgrade to the one I have.

That's good news provided as you already know can find one. Thus, it will be an upgraded version quite capable. Start at these vendors, http://www.geeks.com http://www.newegg.com http://www.computergate.com and google others. You can use the web search engines under google, etc. by narrowing it down via the price searchers, like Newtag and Shopzilla, etc.. Of course, there is eBay, just be sure to check their reviews or credentials. tada -----Willy

I used this with a little work to drill the holes to match my old card -&gt; http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=CH-RD&cat=FAN 2. Shop for the fx6200 or fx7200 card for the slot type you have. The power requirement for this card is on the low side. Bob

Your fan size maybe 40mm or 50mm and RadioSmack does have new ones for sale. Provided you can remove the fan, thus replace to include any wire splicing, yada, yada. If removable, take to RadioSmack or a decent local computer shop for the replacement match-up. Far cheaper than another video card. good luck -----Willy
