here's one for $750 with dual core cpu that meets your specs:  it's pretty hard to build your own cheaper than the $400 specials.
the windows os is $100 so $300 barely covers the hardware.
if you're going to build your own, definitely go to newegg.com, zipzoomfly.com, tigerdirect.com, etc.
i buy from ebay frequently but no ebay seller can beat the prices of the websites i mentioned for the same new hardware.
here's a $470 (including shipping) configuration: asus barebones (case, power supply, mobo), $135:  amd athlon x2 4200+ cpu, $75:  wd 200gb sata drive, $75:  corsair 1gb ddr2-667, $39:  sony/nec 18x dvd burner, $30:  logitech keyboard/optical mouse, $15:  windows vista premium, $99:  17&quot; lcds are the same price as 19&quot; lcds now.
monitors always on sale somewhere so just wait a week or two until you see one for less than $160.
otherwise, here's a couple of choices: asus 19&quot; widescreen, $190 before $30 rebate:  hanns-g 19&quot; widescreen, $173:  acer 17&quot;, $180:  acer 19&quot;, $180:
