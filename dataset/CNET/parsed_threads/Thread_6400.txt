<s> I have an Intel D845PEBT2 motherboard with the latest bios. </s>
<s> On my Secondary IDE bus I have a Plextor PX-708A DVD burner (master) and a TDK DVDRW420N burner as the slave. </s>
<s> When I boot XP Pro and try to read a PhotoCD (.pcd) in Plextor drive, it asks to put in disk , then it says can't read from disk. </s>
<s> Yet when I put it into the TDK drive it has no problems. </s>
<s> Now - I have played with htis and that settings, and finally I found that if I go to device manager and remove the Plextor drive, then have it search and install new hardware , that now it will act right, at least till I reboot, or if I follow the advice and reboot - it will work properly that instance as it installs the device on that cycle, but won't acknowledge the .pcd disk upon hte following reboot. </s>
<s> Any ideas how I can fix this , or why this is happening - and only to my master drive?-- Harry JK of Reading, PA </s>
<s> This is a sign that either the firmware in the drive doesn't support the media or the drive is aging. </s>
<s> If its an aging drive, you'll find more media that won't work as time passes. </s>

<s> Latest Firmware for the Plextor unit is installed this is a relatively new 8x +/-R/RW DVD burner. </s>
<s> Have uninstalled from hardware manager, adn rebooted allowing discovery of new hardware. </s>
<s> Having done this in the past it had worked ofr that session only and not after multiple reboots. </s>
<s> Today it si still working, adn I wonder when it will stop next? </s>
