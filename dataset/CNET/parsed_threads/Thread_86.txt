<s> I have an external Hard Drive, as detailed above, that presumably needs drivers to mount in my Mac OS X 10.3 Panther on iBook G3. </s>
<s> Can't find any drivers and it's looking maybe as if the drive doesn't have any for Mac OS X. </s>
<s> Any thoughts? </s>
<s> I believe this drive has a USB 2.0 interface and no power supply. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, your iBook only has USB 1.0 and not enough power up the USB chain to power the drive which could result in a non-mounting drive. </s>
<s> If there is a connection on the drive enclosure for an external power supply, that would cover that problem and the drive would mount with no problem. </s>
<s> I say, No Problem. </s>
<s> You would still be left with the slow USB 1 transfer speeds. </s>
<s> What is that, 12Mbs? </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> Twelve megs sounds about right. </s>
<s> However, the drive is in fact powered externally; it's a huge brick of a thing actually. </s>
<s> Just doesn't appear to be mounting. </s>
<s> Any ideas my man? </s>
<s> Upgrading to the latest revision of Panther (10.3.9) solved this, I can now successfully use my external drive. </s>
<s> Thanks for input. </s>
