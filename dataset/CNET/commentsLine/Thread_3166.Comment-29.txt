depending on several physical factors such as spindle rotation speed, flying head clearance, shocks (always to be avoided especially when the heads are in motion), cooling issues, and even power supply surges (killers for high density ics) your drive will last from 30,000 to 100,000 hours mtbf (mean time between failures).
there have been two schools of thought about how to maximize hard drive life: 1) run it continuously (never power off) as the sealed brearings will last longer than other critical components and there is less chance the heads will ever crash since the most likely time for them to crash is during spin up or spin down; (that advice may be outdated nowadays); 2) use a disk manager program (and data storage scheme) that absolutely minimizes disk accesses, and power off the drive when the last access is more than a second or so ago.
the theory here is to minimize use for lowest rate of wear.
whatever you adopt as your strategy you should realize that your hdd will not last forever, and plan accordingly, for the day when it fails - critical (unreplaceable) files should be written to cd/dvd roms several times a year.
you can reinstall software, download tunes, but your personal photos, and correspondence may not exist anywhere else.
no enterprise that wants to stay in business ever puts its critical data on one drive these days -- they use raids with hot swappable drives which are backed up on a regular schedule.
some day soon hdds will be cheap enough that we can use the same strategy for our data as well.
