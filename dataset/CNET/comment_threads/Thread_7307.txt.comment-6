Proffitt, several monthes later I finally got a chance to look at my wifes pc and installed windows 7 from a flash hd.
I did what you said and looked over the other web shot you found stole a jumper from a old hd and BINGO !

Thanks A bunch..... and no i am not gonna kiss ya.
Now I will transfer 7 to the 500 and reformat the rest of the ide drives for max space.
Thanks again , glad /i saved this message.
