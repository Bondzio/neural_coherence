i guess i should further clarify.
i do not wish to purchase equipment (router/switch) if not absolutely necessary for this one-time transfer with another computer.
ive heard its possible to directly cable-connect two computers with ethernet but i cannot get it to work.
when i plug ethernet into each, they both just say &quot;network cable unplugged.&quot; is it because this requires a crossover cable?
or do i just need to adjust settings.
or was i told wrong and this is not possible?
