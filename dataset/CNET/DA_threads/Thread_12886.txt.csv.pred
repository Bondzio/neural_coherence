1.1.1	well i just got a new computer and its working great so i decided to go download FEAR(demo) since my last computer i had whould blow up if i tryed to and as i got in the game everything was perfect i could play it at the max settings at 1024 by 768 with 4AA and 8AF and be like 90 some percent always over 40FPS.

1.1.2	But when i walk around a corner or something or see a corner with shade on it sometimes it gets kind of edgey and feels like its draging.	St
1.1.3	my computer spec is AMD X2 4800, 2 GB of RAM, geforce 7800 GTX 256mb.	St
1.1.4	I hope you guys can understand that its kind of hard to decribe.	St
1.1.5	thanks for the help.	Polite
1.2.1	At its higher settings and beyond the game is written to tax hardware that has yet to be invented.	St
1.2.2	This is no bug but why not push the machine envelope so you don't have to rewrite it tomorrow?	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
