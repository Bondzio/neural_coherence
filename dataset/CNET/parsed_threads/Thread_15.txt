<s> Ok i just opened my pc case to clean the dirt and so on , when put back together and turned on right away it says &quot; Monitor Out Of Range&quot; with a pure black screen , and pressing keyboard buttons or restarting the comp doesnt help. </s>
<s> I tried putting my brothers monitor considering my monitor might be dead , but still same error on screen , is something wrong with my motherboard ??? </s>
<s> How do i fix it please help. </s>
<s> All help appreciated. </s>
<s> it's possible you dislodged the video card (unless yours in on the MB). </s>
<s> AGP slots can be touchy and component fit is not always perfect. </s>
<s> Video cards get unseated and it only takes small movement to do this. </s>
<s> Remove and reseat it and see if this helps. </s>
<s> Hmm i dont get it i mean ive got a built in video card , so how could i ever have misplaced it ? </s>
<s> Is there any other possibilities ??? </s>
<s> Or anything else wrong ? </s>
<s> ? </s>
