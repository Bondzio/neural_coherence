<s> I'm in a bit of pickle with my new computer. </s>
<s> It keeps shuting off and restarting for no reason, after turning off the auto-reboot option I keep getting BSOD'd. </s>
<s> Normally with the generic error message. </s>
<s> However the last two times I kept getting a BSOD with BAD_POOL_HEADER on the 3rd or 4th line down. </s>
<s> I've been told it could be a number of different things wrong with it. </s>
<s> Overheating, bad mobo, faulty PSU, bad RAM etc. </s>
<s> I've checked the mobo for defects and bad capictors and they all seem ok. Its had a fresh install of Windows XP pro, I did a memtest and after about 2 hours it came up with 2 errors with the RAM. </s>
<s> The CPU temps according to Speedfan are running at 36-43'C depending on load (this is with the side of the case off and a small deskfan blowing inside the case). </s>
<s> With the side panel placed back, core temp 1 and 2 were into the 40s with a little red arrow pointing up. </s>
<s> Its got a stock AMD heatsink and fan on it, however the case has no fan on it. </s>
<s> The actual PC is about 4 years old but its new to me. </s>
<s> The specs are: AMD Althon 3500+ (2.2Ghz 64bit) Asus motherboard (dont know the model) Nivida GeForce 5700 2 Sticks of 512mb ATL RAM Maxtor 80GB Hard Drive Windows XP Pro 230V PSU (dont know the wattage) Can anyone help? </s>
<s> Is the case cover off and the dust bunnies moved out? </s>
<s> And with the cover off and that fan there, did it still reboot? </s>
<s> Also, since it reboots I wonder if you can tell us the 10 or so drivers you installed after you installed XP. </s>
<s> It's not unusual to find a driver that was forgotten. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The case has been cleaned out, it has restarted on a few occasions with the side off and a fan blowing into the case. </s>
<s> the drivers that were installed, the CD-rom and DVD-RW drivers were installed I think, the graphics card driver, mobo driver, Wireless card driver. </s>
<s> Thats all I can remember, </s>
<s> The chipset drivers. </s>
<s> Notice the first 3 drivers are all about that at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7587_102-0.html?forumID=69&threadID=271360&messageID=2699006#2699006 If you can supply the make, model of the mainboard I might find these. </s>
<s> Also, my kids older machine continued to reboot oddly (rarely) for months until I figured out it was the audio driver. </s>
<s> You can test for that by disabling the onboard sound. </s>
<s> One last thing. </s>
<s> Did you refresh the CPU heatsink &quot;compound&quot;? </s>
<s> I would. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Where would I find the motherboard model. </s>
<s> The motherboard is made by Asus. </s>
<s> In reguards to the heatsink, I have reasons to suspect this as it was kinda dusty before I cleaned it. </s>
<s> I havent got any thermal paste so I cant take the heatsink off to see. </s>
<s> I have an AMD 64 socket 754 system and my random reboots ended when I moved some USB things off the onboard USB connections. </s>
<s> That was my clue a driver wasn't quite right. </s>
<s> Oddly the PCI USB 2.0 card that I moved them to worked fine. </s>
<s> OK, how to identify the motherboard. </s>
<s> You have the visual method and you can try BELARC ADVISOR and the free version of EVEREST. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I do have a usb 2.0 card plugged in but not installed. </s>
<s> could this be the problem? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I've removed the usb card, going to find out what the mobo model is. </s>
<s> ASUSTeK Computer Inc. A8V Rev 1.xx From that Belarc system scanner thing. </s>
<s> I think it might be a bum card because I have taken that USB card out and so far no restarts. </s>
<s> Temps are at 40-43'C </s>
<s> Someone told me that. </s>
