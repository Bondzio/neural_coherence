1.1.1	I have the 320 GB Simpletech ( Hitachi ) Signature mini Pininifarina external hard drive , bought in August 2009 .	St
1.1.2	Since then I have had the occasional minor glitch , such as when trying to unplug it from my laptop ( Acer Aspire 5735 , running Windows Vista Home Premium ) I would get a message saying : Can not disconnect ; Generic Volume still in use .	St
1.1.3	And a couple of weeks ago the cable stopped working properly , but I found another to fit it and it has functioned perfectly well since then .	St
1.1.4	Then on Saturday night it suddenly stopped working properly .	St
1.1.5	I was listening to music and the files suddenly wouldnt open .	St
1.1.6	It was late so I simply disconnected the hard drive , turned off my computer , and left it til morning .	St
1.1.7	On Sunday morning , when I plugged my hard drive into my laptop , I heard the usual du-du sound Windows makes when you insert a USB device .	St
1.1.8	But then nothing .	St
1.1.9	No autoplay options , nothing detected in Windows Explorer .	St
1.1.10	Hmm Changing the cable , unplugging and re-plugging , restarting my computer , all did nothing .	St
1.1.11	I tried it on a different computer ; still nothing .	St
1.1.12	The device is initially detected when I plug it in , but nothing further happens .	St
1.1.13	Occasionally it does show up under Computer management & gt ; Device management .	St
1.1.14	It has a little yellow exclamation mark , and a notification saying This device can not start .	St
1.1.15	If I click Check for solutions Windows does a search and then tells me that the device driver is up to date , nothing more can be done .	St
1.1.16	Crap .	St
1.1.17	On the hard drive itself , there is a red light to show connection and a blue light to show when its busy doing something .	St
1.1.18	The red light illuminates and stays on constantly , but the blue flickers weakly once and then stays off .	St
1.1.19	There is also a faint tapping sound from the hard drive , like a heartbeat .	St
1.1.20	It ticks rhythmically 36 times ( yes I have been dejectedly sitting here with my ear pressed to it ) , then makes a sound like a video being rewound for a few seconds , then starts another 36 clicks .	St
1.1.21	It repeats this six or seven times , then sounds like it is spinning normally .	St
1.1.22	But still nothing happens .	St
1.1.23	Double crap .	St
1.1.24	Ok , so now Im getting a little worried .	St
1.1.25	That thing contains all my music and pictures , and some documents .	St
1.1.26	I have a few bits and pieces backed up on my laptop , but the rest ah !	St
1.1.27	Not to worry , theyre on the family computer at home !	St
1.1.28	( I should explain , Im living in France at the moment , but originally from the UK ) Quick phone call to my Dad only to discover that in updating the home computer to Windows 7 , they decided I obviously didnt need my user account any more , cos I dont live with them at the moment , and besides I have everything I need on my external hard drive ; so they deleted it Triple crap .	St
1.1.29	Ok so now I really need to get this Signature Mini working !	St
1.1.30	I look around online , and a few forums suggest checking the BIOS hmm , Im not very computer-y minded so Im not entirely sure how to change those , but as far as I can see its not that .	St
1.1.31	Reinstalling the drivers nope , that doesnt work either .	St
1.1.32	If I try to reinstall from scratch I get a little popup saying Installing device drivers , click here for status .	St
1.1.33	The status scrolls for a little bit , installing installing still installing failed .	St
1.1.34	Quadruple.. well you get the idea by now .	St
1.1.35	As a last ditch attempt I followed the advice of several hundred people online saying Omg this really works , and put my hard drive ( well wrapped ) in the freezer .	St
1.1.36	That was 5pm on Sunday ; it is now midday on Monday and on getting my chilly hard drive out of the freezer I have found no change whatsoever .	St
1.1.37	Is there Anything , absolutely ANYTHING , that can be done ? ?	Ques
1.1.38	Or am I just going to have to shell out on data recovery ?	Ques
1.1.39	I know that since my hard-drive is under a year old I can send it back to Simpletech , but they dont do data recovery which is the vital part of my problem !	St
1.1.40	Sorry to blab on , guys , but I thought you should have as much detail as possible .	St
1.1.41	Please please help me	Sug
1.2.1	The story reads like others that did n't plan for the crash so this forum has the usual at the top of the forum .	St
1.2.2	Try those and progress from free to trial to payware and finally http : //www.drivesavers.com & quot ; We only lose what we did n't backup. & quot ;	St
1.3.1	is to take the hard drive out of that enclosure and put it into another .	St
1.3.2	If it still does n't work , it 's likely a goner .	St
1.3.3	That sort of thing happens every day .	St
1.3.4	It 's not a matter of & quot ; if & quot ; but a matter of & quot ; when & quot ; this is going to happen .	St
1.3.5	The ticking you hear sounds like what some would call the & quot ; click of death & quot ; but I ca n't be sure .	St
1.3.6	Sorry to tell you this .	St
1.4.1	HI You suggest taking out the harddrive and replaceing it ... how/where can I find another harddrive to put in this case ?	Ques
1.4.2	Thank you	St
1.5.1	All my local computer shop sell hard drives .	St
1.5.2	And so do all computer webshops where I live .	St
1.5.3	Might be comparable with you .	St
1.5.4	Kees	St
1.6.1	We 've had a few PowerMax customers ask us the same question so we decided to post an answer on our resources page .	St
1.6.2	For troubleshooting ideas , please see this post : External Hard Drive Not Registering on a Mac .	St
1.6.3	Hope this helps !	St
1.7.1	I am having an almost identical problem with mine .	St
1.7.2	Curious to hear solutions .	St
1.8.1	with one of my Western Digital drives ... ... on another forum someone answered me the following & quot ; you might need to crack the case open and plug the hdd directly into the pc , could be the usb controller on the case gone. & quot ; That was verbatim and all he said .	St
1.8.2	Good luck !	Polite
1.8.3	Mine 's still not fixed .	St
1.8.4	To a shop when can afford .	St
1.8.5	Hate to ask , but someone else on here needs to know the voltage output specs on the same drive as yours .	St
1.8.6	Can you pleas tell us ?	Ques
1.8.7	Thanks and good luck .	Polite
