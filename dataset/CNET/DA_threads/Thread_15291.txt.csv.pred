1.1.1	I need help with an ongoing CD/DVD Writer issue that 's really driving me nuts .	St
1.1.2	Recently , I had some PC problems ( replaced my main system hard drive and repairs were made to my motherboard 's batteries ) .	St
1.1.3	I had one problem after another .	St
1.1.4	Lately , I 've been having consistent problems with my DVD Writer .	St
1.1.5	When I inserted a DVD or CD , blank or not , my PC shut down as soon as it began to read the disk .	St
1.1.6	If I booted my PC with a disk in , it shut down immediately .	St
1.1.7	This happened the great majority of the time , but not always .	St
1.1.8	I tried uninstalling the drivers and adding them back on , but it did not help .	St
1.1.9	I disabled and then enabled the drive .	St
1.1.10	I removed the drive and then added it back in the Device Manager .	St
1.1.11	I also replaced the cable and checked the jumpers .	St
1.1.12	I virus checked my system .	St
1.1.13	The manufacturer suggested that I use Microsoft 's Fix It program , but it asked for a disk to be inserted and this resulted in a shutdown .	St
1.1.14	Finally .	St
1.1.15	I assumed it was a hardware issue and I replaced the drive .	St
1.1.16	The problem continues as before .	St
1.1.17	The same fix attempts have failed .	St
1.1.18	Any suggestions would be helpful .	St
1.1.19	Thanks ... John OS : Windows XP , SP3 NEW CD/DVD Writer : LG # GH24NS95 ( SATA ) OLD CD/DVD Writer : LG # GH22NP21 ( IDE )	St
1.2.1	XP , even with SP3 does not have native SATA support so this is a nightmare of drivers , issues and arcane information for most users .	St
1.2.2	Unless you have a geek guru friend I suggest you forget SATA and get another IDE drive .	St
1.2.3	And for the same bucks you usually can get some USB external DVDRW and get a bonus that you can use it on many other PCs .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	If the problem happens with both an IDE and SATA drive , it must be something other than a SATA related problem .	St
1.3.2	How would going back to another IDE drive help ?	Ques
1.3.3	I 'm also looking to keep an internal drive rather than switch to external .	St
1.4.1	Then it means there is still an OS or driver issue .	St
1.4.2	It could be hardware since many XP machines are past their expected life span .	St
1.4.3	That alone can cause owners to explode in some fit of rage but when it comes to having a stable PC , you know it matters .	Sug
1.4.4	Again , SATA appears to be enabled and the driver issues alone should scare most support away .	St
1.4.5	Disable SATA in the BIOS , remove the SATA drive and replace any optical drive older than 2 years for a test run .	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	Just out of curiosity , what shows up in Device Manager at the drive location , see errors ? ?	Ques
1.5.2	?	Ques
1.6.1	We still do n't know your actual PC model # .	St
1.6.2	It makes a difference knowing the details .	St
1.6.3	Also , because I assume you 're now using SATA , that it was n't before ? ? ?	Ques
1.6.4	If not , its the 1st time now using a SATA device , check the bios and see if any & quot ; legacy or IDE mode & quot ; for SATA is present , if so enable it .	St
1.6.5	If you have an SATA HD , that could conflict because the servicing or polling of devices gets hammered as IDE devices still present lag the system and on top of all this is XP OS , not overall friendly to SATA as it was n't native to it .	St
1.6.6	Alas , you had a problem prior to all this , so I ask was SATA present then ?	Ques
1.6.7	What happens if you disconnect the IDE type CD/DVD drive ?	Ques
1.6.8	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.7.1	No errors ... & quot ; This device is working properly & quot ; .	St
1.8.1	Willy , It 's not a name brand PC .	St
1.8.2	It has a Foxconn WinFast motherboard ( NF4SK8AA-8EKRS / Socket 939 ) with an AMD Athlon 64 Processor 3700+ GHZ CPU .	St
1.8.3	I 've had a SATA HD for some time and it coexisted well with my previous IDE DVD Writer for years .	St
1.8.4	Then about a month ago , the problems started .	St
1.8.5	After a lot of attempts to solve things , I gave up , assumed it was a problem with the DVD drive .	St
1.8.6	I replaced it with the new SATA DVD writer .	St
1.8.7	The IDE writer is gone , but the issues continue .	St
1.8.8	John	St
1.9.1	Clear this up ; & quot ; It 's not a name brand PC & quot ; are you saying this is another mtrbd .	St
1.9.2	than before ?	Ques
1.9.3	Did you do a fresh install of the OS from scratch with all the new parts ?	Ques
1.9.4	If you 're trying w/o the new install , that maybe an issue as previous installs and/or drivers conflict .	St
1.9.5	Having a socket 939 also tells me it 's a dated mtrbd .	St
1.9.6	which is no longer provided out there .	St
1.9.7	if you 're saying it worked before but now telling me it 's a different PC , well it 's not the same , is it .	St
1.9.8	You 're throwing a curve ball in there and if you did n't wipe the HD to do a fresh install as I stated it gets hosed , one way or another .	St
1.9.9	I ca n't tell fully from your posts , which is why I asked about details .	St
1.9.10	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.10.1	By 'not a name brand ' , I meant it is not a Dell , HP .	St
1.10.2	etc .	St
1.10.3	As I said in my first post , work was done on my Foxconn MB .	St
1.10.4	It is the original and same one .	St
1.10.5	I put in a NEW system HD so I had to do a fresh install of XP .	St
1.11.1	This is a lot of posts and I ca n't tell if you are doing tests without the HDD and just a Live CD .	St
1.11.2	I have more ideas such as discussing how the PC boots , how CPU Microcode can be in the boot area , and of course BAD CAPS .	St
1.11.3	Foxconn made millions of bad cap boards .	St
1.11.4	Bob	St
