What I want is a small pc running XP Pro.
When it boots no one logs on to the pc, but the drive on the PC is shared to the network.
The other 3 computers running XP Pro need to access this shared drive.
This is in a peer-to-peer network so there is no server involved.
I'm trying to do this without having to put a client server environment in this really small office.
They don't need the security.
I was planning on not hooking a monitor to the pc and remoting in from one of the other PCs to administer the box if necessary.
Does this help?
