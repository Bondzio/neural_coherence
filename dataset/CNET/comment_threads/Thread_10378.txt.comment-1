If I backup my Toshiba Satellite L305-S5885 laptop 250gb hard drive to an external 250gb hard drive and then restore my laptop hard drive back to Day 1 (Brand New Status), can I selectively put files back on the restored hard drive?
So I can get rid of unnecessary files.
The reason for the restore is an error message that I get EVERY time I reboot my laptop that requires me to put the Windows disk in the CD Drive which came with the laptop which I bought brand new.
I'm hoping to eliminate this error message and &quot;spring clean&quot; my computer's hard drive.
