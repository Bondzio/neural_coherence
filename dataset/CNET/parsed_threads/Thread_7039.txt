<s> Would I be able to use an ATI Radeon X1300 512mb AGP graphics card with an ABIT AV8 motherboard and an AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual-Core Processor? </s>
<s> If not, what cards would work? </s>
<s> (I'd mainly be using my computer for digital photography, microsoft office, and a few games) </s>
<s> i believe the av8 motheroard has agp slot. </s>
<s> ...and just a search away too. </s>
<s> Search : abit av8 http://www.abit-usa.com/products/mb/techspec.php?categories=1&model=175 Listed specification shows support for an AGP 4x/8x complaint graphics card, and Athlon 64 X2 CPU. </s>
<s> X1300 comparison : http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/graphics/charts.html Places it right at the bottom in almost every game, but as long as the &quot;few&quot; games&quot; are at low res, low AA/AF, and a few years old..it might (just) scrape through. </s>
<s> ATI X1600/ nV 6600GT offer far more power (and longer game lifespan) for a little extra outlay. </s>
<s> Good luck, GeeBee. </s>
<s> don't be fooled by the 512mb into thinking this card is more than it is. </s>
<s> it's an entry level card and more ram won't help it perform better in anything. </s>
<s> an x1600pro w/256mb is a better choice. </s>

<s> Thank you for your input. </s>
<s> I am not positive if I want to purchase that card now. </s>
<s> I guess I will rethink it. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
