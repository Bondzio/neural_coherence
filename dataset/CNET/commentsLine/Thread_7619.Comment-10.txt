i am most probably just going to get myself more ram and the upgraded cooling not particularly for overclocking but for simply cooling cause my room gets to high temperatures in the summer, over 30'c and i currently keep my case open, cause one day when i touched the hdd it was that hot u almost couldn't touch it.
so chassis fan would be good.
thx for all the help
