I hope this is something common... Ive just finished building my first pc.ive followed all the wiring diagrams and intructions in all my intruction books but this keeps happening.
i plug the power lead in the back of the compter and get a red led on the motherboard which the intsructions say that the motherboard is recieving power.i then turn the power button on and get a green led and the fans start up but a second after the computer turns off leaving me with the red led again.ive disconnected everything three times now and follewed the instructions each time but the problem keeps coming up.does this ring any bells with anyone?
thanks for your time leon
