thanks, kees, i read:  then i realized that while i had added a local port to the xp's local printer (there is no printer attached locally, though, as the local installation [add printer on printers and faxes window] was originally done just to get the driver on the xp system and accessible), i had called the port printer_name instead of //server_name/printer_name.
i got the server name and printer name from my network places, microsoft windows network.
the server is my vista x64 and the printer is the one attached to the vista machine.
i would guess that no ports are needed on the vista printer unless i was trying to connect to this machine.
adding the port to the local printer installation on the client-side local printer (despite the fact that there is no attached printer to the client xp x86 machine) with the correct syntax successfully resolved this issue.
it should be noted that the box next to the added port should be checked and that a box for spooling below the listed ports must be checked to have more than one port box checked at a time.
thank you very much for your help.
