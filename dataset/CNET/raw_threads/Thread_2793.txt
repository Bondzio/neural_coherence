3045	0	261431	2568769	NR	Cavaleer	8/23/07 8:50 AM	1.187859E12	Should I buy a new unit desktop or separate components??	I need a desk-top but I need NO BELLS AND WHISTLES. Speed is not terribly important nor is memory. 100G HD and a dozen or so RAM is all I'll need. I do not game nor will I ever. I need XP Office and Powerpoint. Other than that only a 17'' flat-screen monitor and a CD-burner completes my package. I don't need any technical support either. I really don't need a warranty. I've used a Presario 700 laptop for the last four years and had no problems. Thus, should I purchase a new budget desktop or go to ebay and buy the separate components? Tnanks in advance... Cavaleer

Monitors always on sale somewhere so just wait a week or two until you see one for less than $160. Otherwise, here's a couple of choices: asus 19&quot; widescreen, $190 before $30 rebate: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=10005838 hanns-g 19&quot; widescreen, $173: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824254023 acer 17&quot;, $180: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824009088 acer 19&quot;, $180: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824009115

This will be a true utility appliance compared to what others are doing with their computers. The laptop question is a good one. On one hand I don't want to spend $2000 on a laptop when I could buy the same tools for 500-700. I have other places I'd like to spend that money since my computer truly will be an appliance. On the other hand I will be traveling a great deal in the coming months and I can see the eventual superiority of a laptop. For the moment, however, a desktop will take care of my immediate needs and when/if I see the real need for a laptop, I'll buy one. lol

I'll check Best Buy for comparison sake. I can drive to both locations as well. Many thanks again, Cavaleer
