8676	0	185470	2019627	NR	bigfatben	6/21/06 1:01 PM	1.15089486E12	graphics card question	Would I be able to use an ATI Radeon X1300 512mb AGP graphics card with an ABIT AV8 motherboard and an AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual-Core Processor? If not, what cards would work? (I'd mainly be using my computer for digital photography, microsoft office, and a few games)

Search : abit av8 http://www.abit-usa.com/products/mb/techspec.php?categories=1&model=175 Listed specification shows support for an AGP 4x/8x complaint graphics card, and Athlon 64 X2 CPU. X1300 comparison : http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/graphics/charts.html Places it right at the bottom in almost every game, but as long as the &quot;few&quot; games&quot; are at low res, low AA/AF, and a few years old..it might (just) scrape through. ATI X1600/ nV 6600GT offer far more power (and longer game lifespan) for a little extra outlay. Good luck, GeeBee.
