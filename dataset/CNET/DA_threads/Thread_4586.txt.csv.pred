1.1.1	I currently have a wireless network with a cable modem.	St
1.1.2	I am thinking of switching to DSL because it is cheaper.	St
1.1.3	Do I need to have one computer on at all times for the DSL network to work?	St
1.1.4	I can't find a direct answer to this question.	St
1.1.5	All I want is to be able to have my wireless network on like it is now so that any computer (and the TiVo) in our house can connect at anytime.	St
1.1.6	Is it possible to do this with a DSL connection?	St
1.1.7	Thanks for the help.	St
1.2.1	But most likely you need to change or reconfigure the IP address... so before you change the modem, please make a note on your current configuration...	St
1.3.1	so everything will work the same with my network?	St
1.3.2	the only difference is that instead of haveing a modem that gets a signal from my cable line i will have a modem that gets a signal from my phone line, right?	St
1.3.3	i wont have to worry about having a computer establish some sort of connection so that the rest of the computers can get online right?	St
1.3.4	thanks for your help.	Polite
1.4.1	is simple, add a wireless router to the modem and each individual device may connect independently.	St
1.4.2	Note that some modem's will have built in routing capabilities.	St
1.4.3	Ask you ISP if they are providing such.	St
1.5.1	You pretty much called it.	St
1.5.2	There is no difference between DSL and cable other than the physical connection.	St
1.5.3	Swap the modem and plug your router back in.	St
