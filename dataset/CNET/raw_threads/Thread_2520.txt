Linksys wireless router, model number WRT54gs and two laptop Dell computers. One with WinXP and the other with Visa. So far I have both installed with Lyksys and the master PC shows it is intalled correctly, while the other recognizes the main one. The problem is, the main one wont go to the Internet unless it is linked directly from the comcast modem to the computer and the other PC, wont link to the internet, no matter what. I have gone over and over the hook-ups. I have linkssys on my own pcs, linking 3 pcs. I have not trouble with mine and use it as a guide. Do you have any advice? Valerie Fasig
