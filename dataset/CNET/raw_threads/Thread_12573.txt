I know some can be found through Google searches or various newspapers but it would be nice if there was an app that can put all the comics in one places so I could select which ones I want to read daily and then use the app daily to read my favorite strips. Is there anything like this available for the iPad or iPhone?

An app like that did show up over 8 years ago and promptly broke as the publisher of the comic strips alter their site to break the app. I hope you think it over why things are the way they are. Without the ad revenue there can't be such strips. Bob
