<s> Hi, I recently built my own computer using the following parts. </s>
<s> Processor - AMD Phenom II X4 910 @ 2.6 Power Supply - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817339012 Graphics Card - ATI Geforce 9600 GSO 384mb Motherboard - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813135234 Heatsink & Fan - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835186030 Memory - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820141300 HardDrive - 7200.11 Seagate Barracuda 160gb 1 120mm Case Fan Aimed At Processor 2 DVD drives and a front port Ok, so the computer has been working flawlessly for 7 months, with no problems. </s>
<s> Yesterday the computer shutdown when I left it on with a game running (league of legends? </s>
<s> ), and today it shutdown again with that same game running, I immediately booted into the BIOS to check the CPU temperature after the shutdown, and behold... 120 C!!! </s>
<s> I immediately changed it to auto-shutdown at 70 c, and then opened the case to check whats wrong. </s>
<s> I touched the heatsink to see if maybe it was loose, but it burnt me, which means it has good contact... </s>
<s> I touched the power supply and it was also EXTREMELY hot... </s>
<s> The graphics card was cool. </s>
<s> As soon as I started it back up, everything started going back to normal, the CPU went down to 30c, with each core at about 20c, and the power supply started cooling down. </s>
<s> Now I don't know what is happening, as I've played much more demanding games without this problem (crysis? </s>
<s> ), this is the first time I've built a computer... Any thoughts? </s>
<s> Because another one of these shutdowns and it would probably be time to say goodbye to the processor. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreicated, thanks! </s>
<s> P.S. </s>
<s> If it was the power supply not living up to the 550watts promise, would I be able to get a warranty on it? </s>
<s> and watch the system and core temps as you use the PC. </s>
<s> How many case fans do you have running ? </s>
<s> Re the PSU.. wouldn't be on my pick list .. the 1 year warranty speak for itself. </s>
<s> Re the HS Fan.... here's some info that might be worth review. </s>
<s> http://www.frostytech.com/articleview.cfm?articleid=1922&page=1 Let us know what you find. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Im like 1 and a half years late... </s>
<s> But the case fan that I have pointed at the CPU was backwards, so it was working as an exhaust. </s>
<s> Anyways, 2 years and running strong, my computer is still newer than most ;D Not to mention cost only around 350 back then. </s>
<s> Get a new cooler </s>
