(Disclaimer: I am a newbie to these more complex computer issues) My wife and I just inherited a Seagate External Hard Drive; she uses a Mac and I use a PC. I've been searching web forums for a way to format the HD so we can both use it, and have not found any solutions. It looks like the best solution is to use some sort of &quot;NTFS for Mac&quot; program. I'm hoping you more educated folk can help me out with 2 questions: 1) what sort of NTFS program would you recommend? and 2) I've seen a number of freeware &quot;NTFS for Mac&quot; programs on the web: are these effective and safe? Thanks.

And (here I'm revealing my ignorance) just to be sure: to say that newer Mac operating systems can deal with NTFS &quot;natively&quot; is to say that such a machine wouldn't have a problem syncing with an NTFS formatted external drive, yes?

You can also try NTFS-3G as noted at http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/macnifying-os-x-introduction-and-working-with-ntfs-drives/ You won't spend a dime. Bob
