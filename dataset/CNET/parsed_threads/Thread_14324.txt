<s> Okay, Guys! </s>
<s> We've talked about who makes the best equipment, and what to look for when choosing that equipment...now it's time to go shopping! </s>
<s> So, here's my next question: In your personal opinion, what is the absolute best place and/or way to buy quality hardware at the best possible price? </s>
<s> Is NewEgg the best? </s>
<s> How about Ebay? </s>
<s> Should we shop Tiger Direct, or Crazy Bob's House of Hardware? </s>
<s> Is &quot;white box&quot; stuff worth the extra effort? </s>
<s> And how about those sales we should probably all be watching for? </s>
<s> When is a deal really a deal? </s>
<s> Any tips and/or tricks would be greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> There will be no votes in this thread--and no winners will be declared. </s>
<s> I just want to hear what everyone has to say. </s>
<s> Sincerely, JDM (*I hope CNET's international readers will share their favorite suppliers, tips and tricks as well. </s>
<s> People have to shop for hardware in Australia, Britain, Canada...and everywhere else, too. </s>
<s> So tell us what you know!) </s>

<s> And are there any shopping tips/tricks you'd like to share? </s>
<s> (Ex. </s>
<s> Can we get an additional discount by bundling stuff together? </s>
<s> Does anything go on sale on the second tuesday of every month?) </s>

<s> Better prices? </s>
<s> Better service? </s>
<s> More convenient? </s>
<s> More selection? </s>
<s> Quick delivery? </s>

<s> I use OEM (a.k.a. </s>
<s> &quot;White Box&quot;) parts. </s>
<s> For those of you who don't already know--white box parts are what large producers use. </s>
<s> They usually come without any cables or manuals, and have a 3 month guarantee at best. </s>
<s> For me, the prices are great--so I don't really mind scrounging up a few cables and downloading the necessary info/software from the web. </s>
<s> I get my stuff from what you might call &quot;warehouse stores&quot;...although I think &quot;garage stores&quot; might give you a better idea of what they actually look like. </s>
<s> I get sales/price info from local &quot;computer rags&quot; and off the web. </s>
<s> JDM (*OEM parts are nicknamed &quot;white box&quot; parts because they usually come in plain white boxes.) </s>
<s> (**OEM stands for &quot;Original Equipment Maker/Manufacturer&quot;--if anyone really wanted to know.) </s>
<s> we've had ZipZoomFly, Newegg, and whatever OEM parts fall off the back of a truck. </s>
<s> Is that it? </s>
<s> Well, I guess hardware heaven isn't so hard to reach after all! </s>
<s> JDM (*A few more &quot;shopping tips&quot; for the average muggle would be appreciated. </s>
<s> How safe is shopping online? </s>
<s> Is there any way to make it safer?) </s>
<s> it's weekly iirc where they put select items on large sales (and it's only for like 4 hours) at www.xoxide.com the hard thing about Xoxide is finding things you actually NEED, and not just cool stuff that you WANT lol </s>
<s> Those kinds of sales can be fun...and you never know what might turn up! </s>
<s> JDM </s>
<s> you shouldn't have a problem with security as long as you don't have spyware, have a firewall, and don't shop at weird or flaky sites. </s>
<s> make sure you are in a secure connect(windows should notify you)when you put your info. </s>
