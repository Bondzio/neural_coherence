i, too, am concerned about my private stuff being out there, but it already is.
every bank account and other financial things are accessible online, whether or not i am the one looking at it.
i use online everything (bills, statements) because i figure i am the one who has to protect them with passwords.
those passwords, btw, are hand written, crossed out and rewritten and hidden so well i sometimes cannot find them.
i try not to let my machines keep track of them.
but i do worry.
also, if there is a tsunami, not being a business, data is the last thing i will be worrying about.
