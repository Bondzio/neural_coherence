Any suggestions on what kind of computer I should get? I am the one mostly on the computer. I do a lot of basic picture/movie editing and I download lots of songs daily. My current computer only has 64 MB of RAM and is running on Windows ME. We purchased it the year 2000. Our price range is about $1250 to $1750. Also, do you think that we should wait a little bit longer until Windows Vista comes out? And maybe when computers ship with a Blu-Ray reader/writer?

Wait say 2yrs. and you will get a computer with blu-ray. When blu-ray comes out, it will cost about $1000. Some analysts say that when the PS3 comes out, the price of blu-ray should fall since the PS3 will have blu-ray technology in its drive. Sounds to me a Gateway or HP will suit you well. You can always get an emachines for a low price and upgrade it from there.

Down the road, you will want to add a video card and maybe a second HD for all your vids and tunes. No second HD bay open in this machine, but there is an extra 5.25'' bay that can take a HD. Look for a machine with: - dual core, 64-bit CPU - 1GB RAM - Dual Layer DVD burner (DVD+/-RW DL) - PCI Express X16 slot for video card - large HD (200GB or larger) You will want to add a 17'' LCD or bigger. The faster the response time for the monitor the better (8ms is faster than 16ms). Make sure you are comfortable with reading text at its ''native resolution.''

Here are the basics, 1 the processor, get an intel pentium 4 with HT tecnologhy (if not HT dont even bother, cuz its actually the best tecnology) say about 3.2-3.6 GHz depends on the price. Second, an Intel MotherBoard, You can search for the 915/945/865 Models but knowing your needs, i own the 865 and for me its good, but if you want audio channels sorround and that stuff i recommend 915 for a P4 proccessor and 7.2 channels, and finally the video card for games and more advanced editing of images, get an ATI 256 DDR3 AGP8X, and you will be fine,if you want get an DVD Burner, but look for one easy to crack RPC2 version, to eliminate all restirccions to burn or see DVDs, I recommend that you buy the new pc before Windows Vista, beacuse it will bewcome more expensive when it comes out. And with XP you will be fine, dont worry, its about 2 years to change a good inversion in a machine.

For that cash, the computer better have the following: - dual core, 64-bit processor (with or without HT) - PCI Express X16 video card slot(s) (not AGP) - high-end video card Today, I would strongly lean towards: - AMD X2 CPU's - nVidia 7800 video card family Check TomsHardware.com for comparison tests.
