<s> I am going to buy a new pc with maybe 256 Mb of Ram and a P IV 2.6 Ghz intel processor.In a reply to my post in the newbies forum, I was told to upgrade to 512 Mb.I personally think it is a great solution.But I am going to use my pc for programming and all that stuff.Would the RAM make much of a difference given the processor speed and OS being XP home ? </s>
<s> if you can, pay out for an extra 512M of RAM, you WILL see a difference... http://www.price.com/memory/drill.html?epg=5018&tci=5018 . </s>
