And some port scanning software/web sites will try to sell you something to close those ports. When I tried that site it wanted to set a cookie. Why? I don't know, and I denied it and I won't be back. BTW, there are almost 40,000 ports on a PC. Are you gonna try to close them all? Please, don't worry about it.
