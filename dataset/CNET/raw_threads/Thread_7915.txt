I am having trouble booting up i turn it on and it says i hav e a low power supply and then i have to press F1 and then i have to choose Windows XP (ive had to do both of those for ages. But the thing is when it usually boots up to y desktop is flashes a blue screen then restarts this process and is very aggrevating. So any feedback is highly appreciated.
