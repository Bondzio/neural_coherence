you system RAM.
But after it's gone through a number of cycles called &quot;PASSES&quot;, it will show a problem or not.
It cannot 'FIX&quot; anything....it can only tell you if the RAM passes or does not pass all the RAM tests in the system it's installed in.
What results do you get from Memtest86+ after three passes ???
