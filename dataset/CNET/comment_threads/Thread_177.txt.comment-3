Much thanks for your timely reply.
With the advance of virtualization I just thought it might be possible to virtualize applications to a USB drive.
The two obvious barriers would be power and a physical connection to a router.
Just wondering if there is anything like this in existence or being ontemplated.
Ideally, I would would like to access some things without having a desktop on 24/7.
