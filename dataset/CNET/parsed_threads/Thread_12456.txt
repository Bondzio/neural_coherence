<s> I have a 800mhz ibook laptop and dont have a airport card is there any other products to connect it to my wireless network? </s>
<s> I have heard of usb adapters but also heard they dont work. </s>
<s> occurred to me was: Why not buy an Airport Card fro your iBook? </s>
<s> The other thing that occurred to me was: Why is this person not telling us exactly what sort of iBook they have? </s>
<s> Is it an iBook with a 800Mhz G3 processor or is it an iBook with an 800Mhz G4 processor? </s>
<s> Both are Airport Ready and both can have an Airport card easily inserted. </s>
<s> It's a user upgrade for both these machines. </s>
<s> Note that the G3 machine requires the older, 802.11b, Airport card which is more expensive and harder to find. </s>
<s> The G4 machine requires an Airport Extreme card, 802.11g, which are cheaper and easy to find. </s>
<s> Both of these cards, work. </s>
<s> Does that help you? </s>

<s> it is a g4 800mhz I would just get an airport card but i was told only the older discontinued ones will work and people want $60 plus for an outdated card. </s>
<s> Doesnt make sense to spend 60 bux on a card that uses an old standard when i could go down to wal mart and have a selection of faster wireless adapters for around 40 dollars. </s>
<s> of course those dont seem to work. </s>
<s> The extreme will work with the G4 ibook? </s>
<s> I am mistaken my ibook is not a G4 it is a G3 800mhz ibook. </s>
<s> will the extreme card still work with this? </s>
<s> You will need the older, slightly more expensive, Airport card. </s>
<s> If you found one for $60, get it. </s>
<s> They got for anything up to $160 P </s>
<s> that is just crazy! </s>
<s> I think i will find another solution thank you for your help. </s>
<s> It's really not anyone's fault that you have an old machine that requires much sort after accessories. </s>
<s> Good luck on your hunt, there are USB wireless devices out there that will work in your machine. </s>
<s> Problem is, finding them. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> Give macwirless.com a try. </s>
<s> They have 100% compatible wireless solutions for almost every Mac. </s>
<s> $60 is a good price on a used card. </s>
<s> Most people are selling them on EBay for 80-100 dollars. </s>
<s> Old Macs are great, but the laws of supply and demand will dictate the price of add-ons and upgrades. </s>
<s> Some hotels offer wireless access points that plug into the ethernet port ... maybe they can be had somewhere, or ask a hotel that uses them if they would sell a used one to you. </s>
<s> Good Luck, Greg </s>
<s> Here's a USB solution: http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=358&sec=0 and some more info on that solution: http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20050201091946184 http://reviews.cnet.com/D_Link_AirPlus_G_DWL_G122_network_adapter/4505-3380_7-30974199.html Good Luck, Greg </s>
<s> I am sympathetic, believe me, and it is admirable to be frugal, as you clearly are. </s>
<s> I have a G3 PowerBook without an Airport card, myself, and have given some thought to getting the right card for my little workhorse, though it has (unfortunately) more pressing demands, at present--if I read things correctly, beginning with a new battery. </s>
<s> Leaving frugality aside, though, you seem already to have some kind of network arrangement (did I read you right? </s>
<s> ), and the Airport card would allow you to use hot spots all over, so unless there is another, much cheaper solution, why not go for the card? </s>
<s> For that $60 (lucky you--I've seen the same cards offered only for more than $100) you'd be getting a lot more utility and enjoyment out of your computer. </s>
<s> My two cents and no disrespect. </s>
