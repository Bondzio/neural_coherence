Trying to share a wireless connection between several computers, for several computers in a building with thick concrete walls.
The connection is horrible right now.
What can be done to improve it?
Is there a really good router that I should upgrade to, or should I get a booster of some sort - and if so, what's the best one for so much concrete?
