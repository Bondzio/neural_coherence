the atom processor will probably be around the same speed as the pentium m ulv.
the ram in the netbook is probably faster than what you've got in the laptop, and the ssd will be faster in the long-term as fragmentation doesn't bother it (and windows loves to get fragmented...).
i can't say whether ms office 2007 will run well - i use linux.
but openoffice.org is reasonably snappy on my aspire one (same specifications but lower ram as your prospective netbook).
if there is a speed improvement, it won't be by much.
if you really want a little more speed, you'd be better off looking at a proper notebook.
hp has a notebook that uses an amd neo processor - it's like an ultraportable but only about twice the price of a netbook - that i'm thinking of upgrading to, it might be a good option for you if you want the portability.
