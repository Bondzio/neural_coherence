you are right in saying that the CDROM is an IDE device BUT, the device inside the iMac has a special connector which supplies power and data transfer and is a different size than a regular IDE cable.
The ide cable on an iMac is exactly the correct length and will not reach the top of the CDROM let alone another HD.
No power cable either.
The guy needs to purchase a replacement CDROM and all this will go away.
Sooner or later he will have to install something that is on a CD.
The external Firewire/USB option and Carbon Copy cloner are also a possibility.
