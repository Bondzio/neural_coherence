have had the hard drive and memory completely tested.
even bought a new hard drive.
installed a fresh copy of xp pro.
everything running along smooth.
do all the windows &quot;critical updates&quot; etc.
i connect a jump drive one time and everything loads fine.
5 minutes later i put the same jump drive back in the same usb slot or even a diff.
usb slot and it just hangs or i get device not recognized.
tried to find and update the intel chipset 875p.
found one update.
when it hangs or gives not recognized message i of course find the error in the device manger under bus controllers.
have uninstalled and reinstalled all usb universal host controllers.
a few weeks ago i was getting the dreaded blue screen stop error which is why i had the hdd and memory tested.
can't find any other updated drivers and any other possbile sollutions and even with new hdd and fresh install of os 30 to 45 minutes into installation the hang or error messages begin.
thing is i never have had this problem in the past 3 years i have had the cpu so i figure it has to be the motherboard.
dell refurb with tax/shipping is about $185
