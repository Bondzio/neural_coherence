hi, thanks for replying.
i am not very technical with this but basically i want to be able to connect my laptop to the main desktop's printer but i don't want to connect my printer through the internet if that is what you mean by being connected all the time.
i know my response is very vague, but you can either ask me further to clarify what exactly i want or if it's not much trouble, you can just post the solutions and instructions for going about setting up the network printer with a heading for each network printer solution (step by step and numbered steps).
thanks again for replying.
