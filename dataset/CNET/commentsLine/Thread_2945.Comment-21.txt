there is a great registry cleaner i use call &lt;a href=&quot;  &gt;ms-errors&lt;/a&gt;, i use it on my both pc's with different os one is xp the other is vista.
this registry cleaner fixed many errors i had and the slow preformance i had.
i recommend that soft but use what you think is the best for you.
