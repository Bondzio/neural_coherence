the screw hole thing still baffles me.
i'm telling you it doesn't match up.
i know the drive is in correctly.
i would take pics but i have nowhere to host them.
why would i need to access the bios anyways?
will it cause problems if i just go ahead and finish partitioning the drive without going into the bios settings?
