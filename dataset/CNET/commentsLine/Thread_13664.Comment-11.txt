forgive me... i am talking a bit over my head.
yes, this does seem to be related to the ip address changing and the router not recognizing it... it fexes by a manual recycle.
i am not sure 100% but the two seem to coincide.
when it happens, it affects my wired and wireless computers... so if lease refers to only the wireless...then i was confused.
any other suggestions on how to get my router to accept the ip address changes automatically or otherwise assess the problem?
