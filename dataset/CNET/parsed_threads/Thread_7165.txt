<s> It appears the 3Tb HD is here. </s>
<s> WD, is offering it as a &quot;bootable&quot; one that being the major point. </s>
<s> You need to have these requirements in order to use it. </s>
<s> 1) 64-bit OS 2) UEFI and GPT partitioning If you system needs it, WD will provide a small PCB card in order to better i/f the HD for compatibility. </s>
<s> The 64-bit OS is very important as it addresses the capacity or volume issue, as 2.19Tb is the limit for 32-bit OS, thus the 64-bit OS need. </s>
<s> There are other 3Tb out there but it seems the WD offered one is bootable, other will be storage only. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I don't think there's much advantage of using a large capacity harddrive like that. </s>
<s> Personally, I rather use 6-500G. </s>
<s> or 3-1T instead (especially if the price comparison is about the same or not too much higher). </s>
<s> To each their own decision. </s>
<s> But, let's be clear here, there are many users of 500gb, and 1Tb now HDs. </s>
<s> You're own answer offered 3x1Tb as a solution, I'm sure for others it'll be a 3Tb HD. </s>
<s> As time goes by, while fairly common now, 1Tb is already starting to give way to 2Tb and that wasn't too long ago, some pie in the sky. </s>
<s> While on the subject, persistent releases of SSD's are qrowing as well. </s>
<s> So, a typical current 250gb HD maybe replaced by a 250gb SSD as costs go down. </s>
