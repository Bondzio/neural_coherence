1.1.1	So , shipping my computer had some unexpected side effects , one of which is my CD-RW drive seems to be broken..	St
1.1.2	If I go into -any- program to burn a music or data CD or copy one.. it seems like it 's working..	St
1.1.3	In fact , it 'completes ' it and the CD pops out after it 's 'done ' but.. the CD is always empty but can not be reused .	St
1.1.4	I 've tried with different CD types to no avail .	St
1.1.5	The hardware is hooked up , and registers as working right .	St
1.1.6	No new drivers or anything sooo ...	St
1.1.7	I 'm pretty much screwed with that one , right ?	Ques
1.1.8	I 'm okay with that as my other CD drive works and I do n't use the R a whole lot .	St
1.1.9	I would n't mind upgraded to a DVD drive anyway - I guess it would be a DVD writer so I 'd still have the CD writing capabilities .	St
1.1.10	I do n't imagine this should be too hard .	St
1.1.11	How do I find out if my motherboard can handle that ?	Ques
1.1.12	And what 's compatible with my system ?	Ques
1.1.13	And finally , what 's recommended ?	Ques
1.1.14	I 've never had a DVD drive and so I totally have not caught up with the technology .	St
1.2.1	You gave no mention of your system specs/details .	St
1.2.2	On this matter a replacement DVD in lieu of the CD drive will be OK. Just drop it in and set the jumpers , ect .	St
1.2.3	to your needs .	St
1.2.4	Most retail boxed DVD drive will have the help guide and any r/w software required .	St
1.2.5	Beware , the DVD may not be seen as a DVD and the s/w is important as if XP based system wo n't follow the easy drop to disk writing , you 'll need that provided s/w .	St
1.2.6	As for brands I suggest the HP , LG , or Lite-on and maybe Sony .	St
1.2.7	If you desire & quot ; lightscribe & quot ; option that 's up to you .	St
1.2.8	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	As for specs , right now I 've 768Megs RAM , 20 free Gigs of space and , according to HP my motherboard is ASUS A7N8X-LA .	St
1.3.2	It seems I was n't quite as in the dark as I thought I was - simply took some looking up of the new terminology - like Light Scribe which seems pretty dandy .	St
1.3.3	I 'm seeing things about IDE/EIDE/SATA which seem to be the connection/cable type .	St
1.3.4	Is there a certain type I would only be able to use ?	Ques
1.3.5	My current drives use IDE ( which , according to some is really EIDE ? )	Ques
1.3.6	but would I be able to use SATA or EIDE if I found a writer I liked better with those options ?	Ques
1.3.7	The ones I am looking at right now are Lite-ON , HP , LG or Asus .	St
1.3.8	I 've been checking out reviews from a certain competitor site .	St
1.3.9	The pricing is actually much more reasonable than I expected !	St
1.3.10	I 'm not entirely sure by what you mean with 'set the jumpers . '	Res
1.4.1	Jumpers , those are small plug thingees that need to set .	St
1.4.2	This tells the system either master/slave -OR- CS setting for use on the cable .	St
1.4.3	Once , you remove the old CD , review the decal/sticker and see what its set as .	St
1.4.4	You can use that to help set the new drive .	St
1.4.5	For most , you probably have an EIDE type CD drive , thus a new EIDE is required , also known as a PATA vs SATA type .	St
1.4.6	As for a brand pick one , if you 've a HP system , then keep it in the family or not , pick one of the others .	St
1.4.7	It really does n't matter in the long run .	St
1.4.8	adios -- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16827129018 It does n't have lightscribe but it 's getting great reviews from buyers .	St
1.5.2	Might want to check out lightscribe before you get to set on it ... it might require more than it 's worth .	St
1.5.3	You should probably get an IDE CD-DVD drive if your MB is the ASUS A7N8X MB ... .the A7N8X-LA is an ASUS MB made for HP we need more info about the HP model number and series to assist further .	St
1.5.4	Happy Computing VAPCMD	St
