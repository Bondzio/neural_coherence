Thank-you for your reply.
If you are inferring that I should have backed up the DVD.
Yeah!
I know that it would have been a good idea to have 2 copies of the DVD but I didn't.
I did try ISOBUSTER and it merely reported that the DVD was a blank disk.
It is my understanding that (on a hard drive) even if the file allocation table is damaged or erased that a disk recovery tool can restore files.
I'm assuming that something like that happened to my DVD-RW.
Are there any other ideas?
