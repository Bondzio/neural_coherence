i'm finally going to get around to swapping out my hard drive in the morning and i'm counting on you to be there.
all is prepared and the operation begins on friday the 13th.
i won't repeat it here, but i explained it all in a posting to a new friend who wants to help.
it may take all three of us if i screw it up and have to start over.
as always, thanks in advance.
i'll be in touch, even if by some miracle, i get it right.
ann
