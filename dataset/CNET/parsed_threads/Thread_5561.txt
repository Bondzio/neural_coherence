<s> I'm currently running an extremely old piece of junk computer and im looking to build a new one. </s>
<s> I play a lot of online games so i am looking for a powerful build in a budget. </s>
<s> My budget is around $1,300 - $1,500. </s>
<s> I already have speakers but need a monitor. </s>
<s> I have decided on the graphics card (geforce 8800gt for a little under $200) and processor (Q6600 for about $250). </s>
<s> I am basically clueless as to the rest of the components like motherboard, RAM (although i want 4 GB), case, etc. </s>
<s> I've actually decided to change the processor to the E6750. </s>
<s> Good idea or bad idea? </s>
<s> And is it better than the Q6600? </s>
<s> The E6750 is $190 instead of the $250 for the Q6600 on newegg. </s>
<s> I still need help with the rest of the components. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>

<s> I've been doing a little research on cases. </s>
<s> Is this a good case? </s>
<s> And if so, what is a good power supply to buy with it? </s>
