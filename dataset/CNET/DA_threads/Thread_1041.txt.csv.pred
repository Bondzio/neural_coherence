1.1.1	I have comcast digital cable , and I do n't have a network card .	St
1.1.2	I recently bought a Network Adapter for my Playstation 2 , and I do n't have a correct plug for the network adapter .	St
1.1.3	If anyone has a network adapter , they know that you are supposed to plug in what looks like a phone jack .	St
1.1.4	What do I need to buy in able to use my network adapter ?	Ques
1.1.5	Someone has told me these : A router , a network card ( which we tried and it did n't work ) , and a cat5 cable ...	St
1.1.6	Please help !	St
1.2.1	I hope I do n't steer you wrong here , but for just one computer hooked up to the internet , you should not need a router .	St
1.2.2	The network card goes inside you computer in a PCI slot , then you plug the cat5 cable from it to the comcast thing .	St
1.2.3	I hope this is a start and does not get me in hot water for messing you up .	St
1.3.1	Thank you !	St
1.3.2	I hope that works , but if any other people see this , keep posting ideas or knowledge please !	St
1.4.1	The key items missing from your post are : 1 .	St
1.4.2	How the cable modem is attached to the PC .	St
1.4.3	2 .	St
1.4.4	What OS is the PC running .	St
1.4.5	Even if you add an Ethernet card to the PC , enable ICS ( Internet Connection Sharing ) , some versions of Windows are less than stable ( Windows 3 , 95 , 98 , ME ) and this extra work may push them over the edge ( along with your sanity . )	St
1.4.6	If the cable modem has an ethernet connection , that would be my preferred connection point , then I 'd run out and get a Linksys NAT capable DSL/CABLE Modem Router ( and cables if need be . )	St
1.4.7	That puts the work of the internet connection sharing off your PC .	St
1.4.8	If you want to tackle your PC supplying the connection , look at http : //www.wown.com/j_helmig/icshchck.htm to give you an idea of what you may need to check up on .	St
1.4.9	Other OS 's are at that site .	St
1.4.10	Bob	St
1.5.1	any mention of the cable modem and your purchase of INTERNET SERVICE along with the Digital cable service -- it is not automatic .	St
1.5.2	One either pays for an installer to set up the account or one gets the self installation package from the provider when one signs up for the internet service .	St
1.5.3	The cable company 's line screws into the cable modem and the cat5 goes from the cable modem to either your NIC ( ethernet card ) , your router , or your hub 's uplink port .	St
1.6.1	First off , I do n't know what a OS is ... sorry bout that !	St
1.6.2	^_^ Second of all ...	St
1.6.3	I believe the cable is running to the modem , then another cable is NOT plugged into the phone jack ( or it looks like one ) but plugged into another socket that looks like a square with another half-size square inside it .	St
1.6.4	Then & lt ; i & gt ; THAT & lt ; /i & gt ; cable runs into the front of my compaq computer ( if that helps any ) right next to the floppy drive .	St
1.6.5	It plugs into one of two vertical rectagular sockets .	St
1.6.6	That 's all I really know about it .	St
