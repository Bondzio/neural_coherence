<s> Hi, I was thinking of buying a cable for my Dell M65 Laptop to connect to my tv to watch movies. </s>
<s> I looked into a 1.5M VGA to 3 RCA Cable Adapter TV HDTV for PC Laptop. </s>
<s> Is this a feasible cable? </s>
<s> If not, what should I get? </s>
<s> I do not have a S-video output on my laptop </s>
<s> if so, use it. </s>
<s> depending on the cable and your nvidia graphics drivers, a vga to component hdtv cable may or may not work. </s>
