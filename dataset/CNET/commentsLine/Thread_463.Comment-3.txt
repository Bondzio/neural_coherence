bought the retail cpu.
they come with the hsf.
for a while they came with the thermal paste on the bottom of the heatsink.
it looked like a sticker because it was so perfect.
touch it and one realized that it was a paste.
later they went back to supplying a small tube of thermal compound with them.
in your case you have an intel cpu.
they already have a heat spreader on them, and although they would possibly do a little better with thermal paste, i wouldn't expect more than 4 c degrees.
amd only has the approx 1 square inch chip to contact for heat transfer, definitely needs thermal paste.
[the 64 bit versions do have a heat spreader, they have copied most of the good heat protection things that intel has had for a few years.]
artic siler and a few others are also electrically conductive so be careful to not get it on anything but the heat spreadr.
the thermal compound goes on in a very thin layer.
too thick and it tends to npot transfer heat as well.
