if you've been around there is a race between games that tax the hardware and hardware that improves and provides more cpu/gpu power.
if you reach some plateau then you have to improve or replace the pc or parts.
it's a shame you only posted what you did and not the reason you did all this latency testing.
in itself it's just a test and doesn't mean there is a real problem to solve.
also, not a word about your pentium 4 machine?
