be nice if you could set the ip with a command line but windows says gui is better.
it is trivial to set the ip but it is so hard to describe in words.
it is in the tcpip properties for the wireless card.
there are a number of sites that show screen caps of how to set the ip if you search.
a wireless lan interface is configured exactly the same as any other.
just google how to set a static ip.
someone else hardcoded their ip is more than likely how they are interfering with you.
there is no way to know for sure the new ip you pick is not already assigned to another machine since it may be turned off.
that is why dhcp exists but you will eventually find on e that will work.
