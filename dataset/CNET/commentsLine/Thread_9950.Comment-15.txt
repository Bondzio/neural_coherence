if your old system is a vendor system do not expect to use xp.
if your os disk is an oem you may get lucky.
you will have to make the xp disk the master, the 98 disk a slave.
in bios set the cd-rom as first boot device.
insert the xp os cd, save changes and reboot.
follow the prompts to format the xp drive and install the os.
this will create a dual boot system and will work with the oem os disk.
the problem...windows activation .
do a google on dual boot.
items to note: xp needs 256mb memory min.
5 mb of h/d space.
last note, 9x would at times allow h/d to be swapped from system to system.
60% at the time it worked not so with xp.
xp takes a snap shot of all the hwd on the system.
if the hwd profile does not match the system will not boot to windows.
dagger is in denial and a danger.
follow bob's and johan's advice.
