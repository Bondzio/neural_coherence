1. you may go for check connecting a different monitor.
if it works then after start deleat all driver files of earlier monitor.
then reconnect earlier monitor and put correct driver and set correct setting of monitor ( i.e.
24 or 32 bit and 800x600 or very apropriate which monitor can sustain/see the monitor manual).
2. if 1 above does not work then please post the number of addon cards present in your pc and also video detail (i.e.
