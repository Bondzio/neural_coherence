<s> When you repeatedly pull the power cord or cut the computer off manually by holding in the power button, do you risk the loss of hardware due to corruption - how about the operating system? </s>
<s> I have been told there is no risk of doing this repeatedly over years, and would like to know what happens to hardware/software. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> As to losing the files, filesystem or the OS the good news is that the newer filesystems are more resistant to damage but not damage proof. </s>
<s> There is little evidence you can break the machine by removing power but if you want to try to corrupt hard disk contents it is possible. </s>
<s> -&gt; The lesson? </s>
<s> We only lose what we didn't backup. </s>

<s> Sometimes a system can become unresponsive and attempts to shut down properly just don't work. </s>
<s> You've little choice when this happens. </s>
<s> You don't want to be doing this regularly. </s>
<s> As for hardware damage, what I was taught was to avoid rapid off-on and on-off cycles. </s>
<s> Today's power supplies may be better than some of yesterdays but they still like to sequence on and off in a controlled fashion. </s>
<s> If you need to pull the plug to shut down your machine, wait several seconds before applying power again. </s>
<s> This gives circuits time to bleed off stored current before being hit again. </s>
<s> Long ago, I was taught to count to at least 10. </s>
<s> That's not a hard and fast rule, however. </s>
<s> Repeated improper hard shutdowns can cause problems, what they are is left the condition of the system. </s>
<s> Thus, you're at risk every time its done. </s>
<s> Refrain from such practices will allow for continued operation of the system. </s>
<s> However, there are times when no other method seems to be left and you have to pull cord or hit/hold power button. </s>
<s> Correct the problem and be happy. </s>

<s> Desktop PCs that are in a work area, which are repeatedly manually shut down by pulling the plug. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I always power down, power up properly, but a guy at work was arguing that pulling the power cord would not hurt the machine, with the way technology is today. </s>
