&quot;Both the power supply and mother board check out ok.&quot; How did you test them???
The power switch is a momentarty push switch.
The easest way to check this out is to CAREFULLY short out the pins on the MB whet the power button plugs into.
If it powers up then the switch is bad.
then you can have fun getting a replacement from DEll.
Or juryrig a small switch.
