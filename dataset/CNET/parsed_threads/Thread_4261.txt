<s> When I insert a blank DVD to burn, the burning process does not start right away. </s>
<s> I have a delay of between 5 minutes and 2 hours before the process starts. </s>
<s> This is after clicking burn, with the burn window open, buffer is at 100%, CPU usage at 0%. </s>
<s> Happens with both Alcohol and Nero, any burn software I try. </s>
<s> Tried turning off anti-virus, firewall, closing all programs and still occurs - but does not occur when I reboot and burn the DVD prior to opening any programs (other than start-up items). </s>
<s> Running XP, all updates etc. </s>
<s> recent fresh install (to see if that fixed the problem). </s>
<s> An odd note is that when this occurs, the window that pops up asking what you want to do with the DVD you just inserted pops up a long time after the DVD was inserted - like it takes a long time for Windows to see it has a new DVD. </s>
<s> But any program that uses the DVD (other than burning) works right away. </s>
<s> Any thoughts... </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I wonder if this is why I never experienced your issue? </s>

<s> When I try that, it sees the blank DVD and then hangs at that point, same as if I place the DVD in before the software is loaded.... </s>
<s> Drivers, BIOS, firmware in devices, cabling, jumpers and more. </s>
<s> Your post only supplies a symptom and no clue which area could be amiss. </s>
<s> I would be check each area to see what's up. </s>
