Hello, For months a I have had zero success trying to network Epson 4800 printers on a windows 2003 server from a mac client (10.5.6). I am able to print directly to the printer via IP, but when I send the job to the server nothing happens and I get a communication error. Epson support would not give me any help ...and stated that Epson drivers do not support any server OS. So i then created a XP pro box to queue jobs and still had the same problem. I NEED to get these up on a server! Are there any alternative drivers that are a close match to the Epson 4800's? Generic drivers will queue to the server, however print quality is sketchy..... I just can't seem to face the fact that I'm unable to queue Epson printers on a server client network! There must be a way! I Administer a print server with a variety of printers and only epson give me trouble. anyone out there run into this issue? thanks for reading! j

I used this a few times -&gt; http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=GMFPSU22W6&cat=PRN Sorry, I do not have an Epson. Just some HP k550. Bob

We use Pharos pay per print tracking system.....This is the only way the college I work at can charge students per print. I have never had any trouble with HP and Cannon printers, both large format and laserjets without any trouble.
