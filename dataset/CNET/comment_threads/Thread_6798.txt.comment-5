Going off what you have said there are a few questions that must be asked.
1.
Have you installed the O/S drivers for the RAID controller?
2.
Have you partitioned and formatted the drives?
If you haven't installed the drivers Windows will nnot recognise the controller in many cases.
if you haven't formatted the drives Windows will not recognise the logical volume.
You should be able to see the disks within Disk Management if the RAID controller drivers are installed, from here you can format the disks!
