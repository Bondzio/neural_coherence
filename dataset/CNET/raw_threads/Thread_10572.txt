Yesterday, I was using my computer and I noticed that I have two lines running from top to bottom. One is about an inch from the vertical edge of the monitor, the other is about two inches from the vertical edge of the monitor. I disconnected my monitor and unplugged it. I let it sit overnight and reconnected it this morning. The lines are still there. The only difference is that Instead of one line being blue and the other line being red, one line is now green and the other line is blue with a hint of red around the edges. How can I fix this problem? Anyone else have this problem with the L90D? Anyone else have this problem with the L90D?

If it changes then it's likely a cable or video card issue. To nail this one, you need to test the display on another PC. bob

Started with one line, then 2 and now this morning I see 4 lines! Green and red in colour. Will return as soon as possible! Expected better from a Korean brand...

They were fairly quick in replacing my monitor and they gave me no problems. I'm keeping my fingers crossed as I have not had any problems with the replacement. Maybe it's just superstition, but I noticed that the lines on my first monitor appeared near the on/off switch. I wonder if the pressure from pressing that button caused the lines, so now, I never used the on/off switch and just let the monitor power down when my computer turns off.

After reading many reivews I decided on the L90D+, but I have one concern. A larger portion of the recent reviews describe a problem with vertical lines appearing on the right sides of the screen within one to three months of use. I am wondering if this situation has been corrected in the latest production line? Thanks, Drew

In February the replacement and the other original monitor went bad. All three of the monitors have the same problem of vertical lines on the right hand side of the machine. I am still waiting to find out if they are going to charge me shipping for the replacements.

That was the last purchase I will make from Tigerdirect. I ave not had any problem in contacting Hyundai or getting replacements. The number I called was 1-800-568-0060
8050	12	129940	1826461	1633160	gkozowski	3/22/06 7:03 PM	1.14305418E12	E-mail from Hyundai	I currently have 2 monitors I am sending back with the streaking symptom, that makes a total of 3 I have had to send back. I have to pay to ship these units back. I understand that once and a while something can go wrong with a unit but this problem is one Hyundai is aware of. I think it is very poor business practices for a company to require customers to pay shipping for a known factory defect.
