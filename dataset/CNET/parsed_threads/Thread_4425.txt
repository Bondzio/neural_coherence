<s> Alright, my brother just gave me an old Asus desktop. </s>
<s> Whenever I try to power it on, it starts beeping, and doesn't start. </s>
<s> How can I find out what the problem is? </s>
<s> on beep codes. </s>
<s> Like Wayne suggests, search for the beep codes for that particular model #. </s>
<s> The beeps are telling you the nature of the problem. </s>
<s> Once you understand the codes, you'll be on your way to repairing the machine. </s>
