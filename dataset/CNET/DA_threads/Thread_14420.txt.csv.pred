1.1.1	Hi, There are some companies that have their wireless network enabled for their staff to access to the file server.	St
1.1.2	What i wish to know is this.	Ques
1.1.3	I noticed that in order for the staff to be able to use the wireless network is to put in a password.	St
1.1.4	Each of the staff are given a kind of password generator gadget to generate password for them.	St
1.1.5	For curiosity's sake, How does this work?	St
1.1.6	i mean this would be a more secure way to use wireless network in a company or other private properties.	St
1.1.7	What is this system called?	St
1.1.8	Thank you in advance	St
1.2.1	SecureID token.	St
1.2.2	It generates a random and changing code.	St
1.2.3	When I login I must enter the current code that's displayed.	St
1.2.4	Occasionally it will fail and I will be asked to wait and enter the next code.	St
1.2.5	I don't know what happens at the other end.	St
1.2.6	I presume what I type must match what's expected.	St
1.2.7	It's an IT secret and they're not telling.	St
1.2.8	My device isn't to access the wireless network specifically but the VPN.	St
1.2.9	The device will fit on a key chain, is about two inches long and resembles a USB flash drive.	St
1.2.10	Is this what you mean?	St
1.3.1	I had one before I retired from SWBell.	St
1.3.2	Works exactly as you described.	St
1.3.3	It generates a new six digit code every thirty seconds or so.	St
1.3.4	How the remote server knows what it is is beyond me, and like you said, the IT group isn't talking.	St
1.3.5	But in my case it was only used for dial-up when I had my company laptop away from the office LAN.	St
1.3.6	Mine looked like a credit card with an LCD display.	St
1.3.7	After you dialed in you had to wait for the server to give you the prompt to input the code.	St
1.3.8	A real PITA.	St
