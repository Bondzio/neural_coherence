I get the impression you thought it was permanent storage. It isn't. That's why we make a backup copy for the &quot;important data&quot; (and, in fact, that's most data). Kees

It could be due to a failure of the operating system, a virus or an errant program. There is an outside chance that it is the result of sector drop out. Sector drop out occurs when the drive has bad sectors replaced by spares from the bad sector list function. If you can't get it back, you can reach me at info@drivelabs.us Our website is http://www.drivelabs.us We are a data recovery lab. If it is urgent call me at 1-800-994-DISK.
