i just got an idea--perhaps the issue is my modem overheating--that might explain why the outages are intermittent--and this is the end of july (live in desert region).
is there any way to detect the temperature of my modem (apart from dunking it into a bucket of water then sticking a thermometer in the water)?
if in fact this is being caused by overheating, this problem would not be solved by getting a new modem--at least, not solved over the long run.
i have siw (system information for windows), a nice utility that gives a ton of system information (even keys for ms products), but it didn't have this information.
i've had my modem in an enclosed space, standing right next to the back of the desktop unit, which would be providing a rather warm environment.
anyways i'll put it in an open space tonight and then see if these problems continue over the next few days.
