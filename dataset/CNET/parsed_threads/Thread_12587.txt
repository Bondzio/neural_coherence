<s> Hello all, I was thinking about getting a wireless network up and running and I wondered if any kind of parental control for website surfing is available that would work at the router level. </s>
<s> The kids have a Play Station 3 that would also connect to the internet and wondered if there is filtering available for that as well. </s>
<s> Regarding a question you had about the parental control for website surfing.. </s>
<s> There are two that I know of. </s>
<s> One is made by SafeEyes and the other is by ContentProtect. </s>

<s> You just enter the two OpenDNS DNS addresses into the router, create an account with OpenDNS that is associated with your IP address, and then you can filter by category or block certain websites entirely. </s>
<s> No software is needed and it will work with any device that is connected to your network. </s>
<s> It will also protect you against phising scams. </s>

<s> Thanks very much for this information. </s>
<s> I just set it up and if it performs as advertised then you've helped a great deal. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> It is very useful) </s>
