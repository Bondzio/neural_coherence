I upgraded my computer about an hour ago, by installing a Zotac gtx 650 Ti (drivers were installed correctly) and a a Rosewill RD600 Stallion Series psu.
computer worked as it is supposed to for a good 30 minutes.
However, when I entered a second game to test settings, my computer completely crashed.
No bluescreen or anything, it just instantly shut off.
Now when I simply turn the psu on my system makes the first sound it normally does when it boots, but then the cpu fan turns on to full blast.
No follow-on beeps, just the cpu fan running full speed.
I have never heard it this loud before.
I do not get any video output to my monitor, and the led on the power button of my case doesn't even light up, as if the computer isn't even turned on.
I upgraded this factory model from gateway DX4840-03e The specs for this system are -1 TB HDD -Intel i3 540 cpu running at ~3.1 Ghz -8 GB RAM Thanks in advance for the help.
