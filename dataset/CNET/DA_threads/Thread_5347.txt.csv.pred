1.1.2	a laptop and a desktop , but the laptop can connect to the internet just fine , no crazy stuff attached .	St
1.1.3	: cool : but when i head towards my computer , i see a 3-2 bar connection : ( both the laptop and desktop are in the same room , and no drivers are giving a huge red light .	St
1.1.4	Also , when i plug in a rear end network adapter , it seems to do nothing to help its range .	St
1.1.5	: huh : both computers run windows 8 Pictures Laptop 's wifi imgur : the simple image sharer My desktop 's wifi ( in the same room ) imgur : the simple image sharer Laptop 's drivers : imgur : the simple image sharer Desktop 's Drivers : imgur : the simple image sharer also , if you would like to help me with another mystery , The desktop would n't pick up the wifi connected printer downstairs , or the headphones right next to the Bluetooth adapter .	St
1.1.6	Pics : Bluetooth : imgur : the simple image sharer Printer : imgur : the simple image sharer Thanks ! ! ! ! ! !	St
1.1.7	!	St
1.2.1	What type of a hook up are you using ?	Ques
1.2.2	Hardware , ISP etc .	St
1.3.1	i am using Century link as my isp , not sure what the laptop is , but ik my desktop is a gateway XD4780 , and as for my back adapter , do n't know what its called , but it looks like this : http : //imgur.com/ZpzmQgH http : //imgur.com/Z3yLQeP	St
1.4.1	that screw on to a socket	St
1.5.1	The picture ( s ) seem to be of the wireless antenna .	St
1.5.2	IF it is possible for you to do , hardwire to the router via an Ethernet cable , this would be a much more efficient hook up than wifi .	St
1.5.3	As far as printers or peripheral devices , proximity and impediments ( walls doors etc . )	St
1.5.4	can play a major role in defeating wifi signal .	St
1.5.5	Bluetooth is an entirely different ball game , generally requiring a Bluetooth dongle , not the same as wifi .	St
1.6.1	Yeah digger that is the antenna that came with that model desktop , it is obviously unplugged from the system ( unscrewed ) and of course is non functional in that position .	St
1.6.2	From what I saw of the other pic alluding to Bluetooth ( no hardware found ) I am not sure what he is using for a dongle or what the configuration is but as you know , Bluetooth does n't recognize wifi .	St
1.7.1	it just was n't effecting my wireless connection one bit	St
1.8.1	have the antennas screwed on to the wireless network adapter ?	Ques
1.9.1	IF you have very weak wireless signal ( using the onboard adapter with the antenna ) then , as I suggested , IF the router is near enough to the desktop , hook it up hardwire , this is a far better way to go .	St
1.9.2	You could buy a USB input wireless adapter , that MIGHT help but again , impediments ( things in the way ) can block the signal to your unit from the router .	Sug
1.9.3	Hardwire hook ups are always superior to wireless , especially in a desktop application .	St
1.10.1	its like the computer doesnt see the adapter	St
1.11.1	Windows 8 installed or did you recently install it and if so did the wireless adapter work ok with the previous os ?	Ques
1.12.1	From the pictures you sent of Device Manager , it shows your wireless adapter , no errors are shown .	St
1.12.2	Have you tried updating the driver ?	Ques
1.12.3	Or deleting it , rebooting and seeing if that would do the trick ? ? ?	Ques
1.12.4	I was under the impression that it WAS working but with weak signal results , maybe I missed something .	St
1.13.1	i had done a FULL computer wipe ( reinstall windows ) which , after that , has seemed to go bust after installing the lastest driver	St
1.14.1	have windows 8 previously .	St
1.15.1	yes	Res
1.16.1	loaded the original os with the original disc 's the drivers should be correct .	St
1.17.1	i am now in pure hardware ( inside the computer ) , and noticed that both wires to the wireless adapter is unconnected , when i tried putting them near each other i get : http : //imgur.com/KRk4myp so , its definately those 2 wires , thanks for the help everyone .	St
