<s> I have a hp pavilion ze4900 and i do alot of university work on my laptop. </s>
<s> But after about 10 mins i get an icon sign thats says your virtual memory is low, what does this mean and how do i correct it thanx?????????? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Go to My Computer &gt; Properties &gt; Advanced &gt; [Performance] Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Virtual memory and tell us what it says. </s>
<s> Also tell your total and free disc space from the properties of the drive the virtual memory is defined on (probably the c:-drive). </s>
<s> This will give a clear picture of the situation, so we can tell you what to do. </s>
