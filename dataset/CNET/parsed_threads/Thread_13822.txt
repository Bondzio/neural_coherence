<s> Hi folks, I have a PC using an Asrock 4coredual SATA2 motherboard and am looking for an upgrade to my video card. </s>
<s> Asrocks website lists several video cards which they claim they support and claim are compatible with this board, unfortunately the majority appear to have been discontinued. </s>
<s> Is buying a video card that the motherboard manufacturer supports or states is compatible very important or is it safe to assume that most video cards will work? </s>
<s> Ive never heard of this being an issue before, but a lot has changed since the last time I shopped for a video card Im still using an NVIDIA GeForce 2 card that I bought in 2001. </s>
<s> Can someone tell me whether buying from the motherboard manufacturers compatible list is a big concern or not? </s>
<s> Also, where can I go to get a quick tutorial on what the various features Im reading about are? </s>
<s> Thanks John Plenge </s>
<s> Keep in mind some of these card MAY require a BIOS update AND a more robust power supply. </s>

<s> I've copy/pasted several of the names on this list into Google and into the search window of places like NewEgg and Amazon and haven't found any matches. </s>
<s> I realize many of these chipsets are still in production and cards with them are currently being sold, but I was looking for the exact model listed as supported by Asrock. </s>
<s> Maybe I'm being paranoid, but I'm trying to avoid making any purchases until I can be fairly certain what I buy will work. </s>
<s> I'm suspecting that many, if not all, of the cards currently being sold will work, but I'd rather make sure before spending any money and being stuck. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I was leaning toward a Radeon because I had heard somewhere that NVIDIA cards might have some kind of conflict with this board. </s>
<s> I'm trying to avoid upgrading my power supply so I'll watch for that in the specs. </s>
<s> I'm looking at an HD 4670 on newegg right now that may do the job since I don't need the absolute latest and greatest. </s>
<s> I noticed there isn't a 4600 series card on the supported list. </s>
<s> Is there any reason to think it wouldn't work? </s>
<s> the length. </s>
<s> They mfgs provide the dimensions and PSU requirements. </s>

<s> Thanks for all the help, but I've run into a snag. </s>
<s> Someone in another forum pointed out that the motherboard has two video slots, one AGP and the other PCIE x4, and PCIE x16 cards won't fit into an x4 slot, so it looks like I have to either get an AGP card or get another motherboard (which I'd rather not at this time). </s>
<s> I'm currently running a 2001-vintage Geforce 2 card, so just about anything currently being sold would be a quantum leap in performance. </s>
<s> The answer may be to get a fairly cheap AGP card and, in a few years, upgrade both motherboard and card together. </s>
<s> I did see an adapter that allows PCIE x16 cards to plug into an x4 slot, but it raises the height of the card a bit and we start running into problems with the topmost port on the card being obstructed by part of the case. </s>
<s> Also, the card only runs at X4 speed, although it would be usable in a newer motherboard in a few years. </s>
<s> the same speed performance. </s>
<s> See link below http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express#Hardware_protocol_summary From the information found at the site above, it reaffirms my experience which is that PCIe slots can be 'full size physically' but only perform at 8X or even 4X. </s>
<s> Your MB appears to have an X16 size slot which may only by 'wired for 4X performance'. </s>
<s> And based on the list of recommended video cards for your ASRock MB ... assuming your PSU is robust enough, you CAN use almost any PCIe 16X card in the 16X size slot but it will only run at 4X. </s>
<s> No adapter required. </s>
<s> To confirm this I took an ASRock 775Dual-VSTA MB that I bought to use as a bench board. </s>
<s> It has an AGP 8X and a PCIe X16 size slot. </s>
<s> Like your MB my PCIe slot is full size but only runs 4X .. and I just put a VisionTek Radeon HD 2600 PRO X16 card and it works as expected. </s>
<s> Doubt it's working at full speed (16X) but it does fit in the slot and it clearly works .. probably at 4X. </s>
<s> If you read about MBs as some of us here do, you'll find there are many MBs out there that have 2 or even 3 PCIe X16 (full size ) slots but they don't all run at X16. </s>
<s> RE AGP...here are some alternatives. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=2010380048%201069609639&name=AGP%204X%2f8X Now the question which is the better buy for today and tomorrow .. that's one choice only you can make. </s>

<s> I haven't had a chance to look at the forums for a few days and saw your post a few minutes ago. </s>
<s> I had noticed that the slot on my board was the same length as an x16 slot and called Asrock's tech support to confirm that I could put an x16 card in the slot without problems. </s>
<s> Their tech support rep also told me that I should be OK if I use nearly any card with the same chipset as one on the supported list, just make sure my BIOS is upgraded to the same version listed on the list and that I have the same driver version listed. </s>
<s> Again thanks. </s>
