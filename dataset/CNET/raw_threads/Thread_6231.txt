But let's look at http://www.amazon.com/Behringer-HA400-4-Channel-Stereo-Headphone/dp/B000KIPT30/ref=pd_cp_MI_2 I see reviews and here's what I notice. 1. No mention of HISS like I found in 20 dollar units. 2. The volume controls look good, solid. 3. If I needed this, this one hits my price and I'd even get it if I didn't need the other 3 channels.
