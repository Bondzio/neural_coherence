glad to hear there was something to my desperate act of putting an icepack on the drive!
also i ran techtoolpro 4/tests/volumes on the drive.
funny, after i ran that then i hit the play button again (running the volume structures test again to rebuild the drive).
that didn't solve the matter, but i think it prepped it so that when i ran the latest version of disk warrior next, it finally was able to rebuild the drive.
alas!
it now shows up on disk utility and passed the repair test there (oh good thing we all have that lame utility!)
it repaired the fixed volume just fine!
i'm dragging off any valuable files off of the duo pro now and yes, sending it back to simpletech where they said they will replace it.
they said when the drive starts ejecting itself it's big time trouble.
i guess i'm lucky to have recovered it at all.
thanks again for the feedback and tip, folks!
