<s> I have a FreeAgent Pro 750GB hard drive. </s>
<s> I want to use the eSATA interface but have seemed unable to thus far. </s>
<s> I bought an eSATA Cable that has 3GB/s transfer speed, along with an &quot;eSATA II ExpressCard RAID&quot; by SIIG, Inc. </s>
<s> I installed all the software for the card(which appears in device manager and seems to be working properly and nothing seems to work. </s>
<s> it doesn't show that i have a drive connected at all. </s>
<s> It seems to work fine with USB but not with my eSATA connection. </s>
<s> This is the secong kind of card i have tried so i don't know what else to do. </s>
<s> I have a laptop that runs windows XP Media center. </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=HOW+TO+INSTALL+XP+ON+SATA+DRIVES&btnG=Google+Search What derails most is that you would think it should be as easy as installing one driver. </s>
<s> Sadly you often discover some motherboard drivers need installing. </s>

<s> with the drive electronics. </s>
<s> Not very likely, however. </s>
<s> Anyway, the shop where you bought it (hope it's stone and brick) should be able to show it works with them so isn't broken. </s>
<s> That leaves the driver issue. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> I just purchased the exact same setup. </s>
<s> SIIG ExpressCard eSATA with RAID and the 500GB FreeAgentPro. </s>
<s> One thing I found is that there is possible interference between the eSATA cable plug end and the SIIG card. </s>
<s> I had to shave the corners off the cable plug end in order to get it to seat properly in the card. </s>
<s> Once that is fixed, the blue light should appear on the SIIG card. </s>
<s> For single drive mode you have set it up as a RAID0. </s>
<s> Be careful because the RAID gui from SIIG will require you to format the drive after creating teh RIAD group. </s>
<s> Make sure you install/backup the software that's preloaded on the drive. </s>
<s> I lost mine that way....no CD. </s>
<s> I'm still working on formatting the drive. </s>
<s> Doesn't seem to want to format while plugged into eSATA. </s>
<s> Let me know how it goes. </s>
<s> I've also got a 750GB FreeAgent Pro but it's connected directly to an eSATA port on the motherboard's rear panel (ASUS P5N-E SLI). </s>
<s> I *think* that the connection is live because the external HDD stops/starts glowing orange when I switch off / boot up the PC. </s>
<s> Absolutely no sign of it anywhere in the PC though. </s>
<s> Nothing in device manager let alone My Computer. </s>
<s> I'm running Vista Home Premium. </s>
<s> The drive worked fine when I connected it to my Windows XP laptop using the USB cable. </s>
<s> Any ideas folks? </s>
<s> I'll email Seagate and ask them too. </s>
<s> I'll let you know if they come up with anything useful. </s>
<s> Thanks very much! </s>
<s> I bought a PCI eSATA card and cable from Fry's to connect to my 750 GB FreeAgent Pro. </s>
<s> The drive will not power on (no light) no matter what I tried. </s>
<s> The card appears in the XP Media Center configuration. </s>
<s> The base of the drive is warm but no orange light. </s>
<s> USB and Firewire work fine. </s>
<s> I have a Sony VAIO desktop with XP Media Center edition. </s>
<s> Has anyone experience this problem? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Had the same problem with mine. </s>
<s> Having done a bit of research it seems the eSATA connection on the drive is a bit problematic. </s>
<s> I found that if I push the eSATA cable firmly into the socket it will work, but as soon as I let go it does not. </s>
<s> Unfortunately I haven't found a solution yet, I will be trying a new cable soon. </s>
<s> Other users have trimmed the plastic on the cable connector so it will go further into the socket, I may try that as well. </s>
<s> I have been looking for an answer to this exact problem. </s>
<s> I have Freeagent Pro 320GB drive and haven't been able to get a SATA connection working. </s>
<s> Like the rest here I could get a USB connection no trouble. </s>
<s> I also purchased 2 different eSATA port PCI cards and could not seem to get them working. </s>
<s> I stumbled across this forum and saw that it was a cable connect problem for some of you. </s>
<s> When I plugged my drive in, the cable felt like it was connecting but after reading this post and apply some addtional pressure to my cable. </s>
<s> BAM IT WORKS. </s>
<s> Just wanted to say thanks. </s>
<s> I had the same issues. </s>
<s> I found that I just had to push the eSATA cable in harder into the drive and tada! </s>
<s> it worked. </s>
<s> I feel extremely stupid after this experience. </s>
<s> I was checking my drivers, BIOS, connections to the MB, swapping known good connections, trying different cables.... stupid that it was that simple. </s>
<s> I've wasted money on two PCI controllers, the whole night looking up FAQs, knowledge databases, bios and driver upgrades from WD, Silicon Image and Vantec... and I was one stop short of RMA-ing my external HDD.... Thankfully I found this forum! </s>
<s> just a 60-second trick to shave the end off the header and it works! </s>
<s> the thing is... why can't they even get the specifications right in these sort of stuff? </s>
