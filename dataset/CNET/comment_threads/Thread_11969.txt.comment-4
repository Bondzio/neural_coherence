Thanks for your help.
I looked @ the back of my computer.
It has 2 ports.
They look the same size to me.
Thet each have a line that runs from the computer to the phone ports in my surg-protector strip.
One says &quot;input&quot; & the other, &quot;output&quot;.
Would one of those be my ethernet port?
I don't have my DSL installation kit yet.
Maybe when I get that, things will become clear.
But if I need to purchase something to make it work, it would be nice to know in advance.
