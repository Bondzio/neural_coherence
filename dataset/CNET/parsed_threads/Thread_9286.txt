<s> Hello, I have a D-Link DI-514 wireless router and I've been using it from past one year, i connect my laptop and Mobile through Wifi with my PC(windows XP), it has been working fine till now, all of a sudden fron last night my Laptop and Mobile are unable to detect the wifi signals(provided, internet on PC is working fine), i tried all possible trouble shooting steps but, none worked for me....can you please suggest me what possibly might have gone wrong, and what am i supposed to do, to make my wifi router working again. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> Turn the wifi off and on in the router. </s>
<s> Now be sure the security is set to WPA and you broadcast a single SSID. </s>
<s> I've found that helps if it's the usual issue. </s>
<s> If not, try another router. </s>
<s> I tried selecting all types of securities(WEP,WPA,..) available in the drop down, but none worked. </s>
<s> How can i check, if my wifi is working or not ? </s>
<s> can u please suggest me.... </s>
<s> The next test requires another router. </s>
<s> turn the wireless off, then on? </s>
<s> Are you broadcasting SSID? </s>
<s> Try power cycling the router. </s>
<s> Turn it off for 30 seconds, then back on. </s>
<s> If no joy, it's time for a new router. </s>
