I agree with Bob.
Overall cost per page is less, you do not need worry about nozzle clogging during periods of non-use, and for black on white, there are several for under $200.
If you do want color for printing web pages, I think the Konica-Minolta for under $400 is a good buy.
I myself use HP and Brother lasers, but I have friends who use Samsung with good results.
