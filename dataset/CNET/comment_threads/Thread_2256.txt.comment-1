If I were to purchase a wireless router, (those I've seen have several Lan ports), could I connect my DSL modem via the Wan port and my PC via 1 of these ports to utilise the router as a another security measure?
Also if that is feasible am I putting data RF out?
Do you see what I am asking?
Wireless routers are prevelant, but I would still use the router as a wired PC.
