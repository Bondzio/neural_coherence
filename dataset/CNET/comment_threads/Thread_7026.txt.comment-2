I used to Safely remove hardware all the time then I was told if it is USB 2.0 don't bother.
So I stopped.
Is it true?, not sure but I have never had a problem.
So try that first as you may be turning off your USB port each time Also make sure that you are not having conflicting drives.
I had a mapped drive set to E and everytime I plugged in a memory stick I never knew if it was going to recognise it.
Hope that helps
