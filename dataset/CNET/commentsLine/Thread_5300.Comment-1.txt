to all who can help plz do.
a couple days ago my pc got fried.
i smelled smoke from the back and my pc died.
i replaced the power supply but still won't boot up.
pull the battery out and the plug and replaced them.
the power supply fan spins as well as the fan for processor but no video and no beep just a low tone.
i removed the video card and plugged directly to motherboard still no video.
is there anything i can try b4 i end up just replacing motherboard and if needed the processor?
