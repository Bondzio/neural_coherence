1.1.13	Does anyone have any idea what the problem is and how I can fix it?	Ques
1.1.14	A solution is much appreciated.	St
1.1.15	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	I had exactly the same problem, and my ISP identified it as being a problem with Linksys.	St
1.2.2	I upgraded firmware, but the problem persisted.	St
1.2.3	The Linksys router seems to lose your settings, although the settings appear to be there.	St
1.2.4	So all you need to do is open the linksys settings page, and click on save settings.	St
1.2.5	Another related problem is if you have more than one network named on the router (eg: 'home' and 'linksys')- I deleted my 'home' network, and run on the default 'linksys' network now, and since then, the problem has not returned.	St
1.2.6	Hope this helps.	St
1.3.1	Also, I think I only have one network name but how do I know?	St
1.3.2	I can't find anything on my PC that says Linksys.	St
1.3.3	Nothing in start menu, program files, search...nothing!	St
1.3.4	Thanks.	St
1.4.1	Open your network connections, click on properties, then check your preferreed Network list.	St
1.5.1	I appreciate it but can't figure it out.	St
1.5.2	I can't find anything on my computer that says Linksys.	St
