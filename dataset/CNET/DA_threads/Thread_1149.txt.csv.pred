1.1.1	As the title suggested.	St
1.1.2	How do you achieve optimal hard drive parition?	St
1.1.3	Or what do you think is the best way to achieve it?	Ques
1.1.4	For me, I use Partition Magic but I am not sure if it is the best and whether I doing the right way with it.	St
1.2.1	It depends on what/how you want to partition.	St
1.2.2	For creating new partitions (including logical ones) I use Window's Disk Management and that has never gone wrong for me.	St
1.2.3	However if I want to do more of the complex stuff that Partition Magic offers (merge partitions, rename a partition, redistribute free space, resize, etc.	St
1.2.4	), I would use that.	St
1.2.5	Oh and for installing a new OS, even though PM offers that I don't use it, I like doing it the conventional way.	St
1.2.6	But if you like it, use it.	St
1.2.7	I'm just stating my opinion	St
1.3.1	IS there an optimal way to partition a hard drive?	St
1.3.2	In general or in any particular situation, like &quot;tell me the details of your PC and what you do with it, and I'll tell you the optimal configuration for that machine&quot;?	St
1.3.3	If there isn't, the only possible answer to your question is that it is an question without an answer.	St
1.3.4	Something like &quot;how do I walk to the moon?&quot;, or even &quot;how do I reach the end of the rainbow?&quot;.	St
1.3.5	I think for most of us one partition per drive is optimal.	St
1.3.6	And that's easy to achieve the first time you use it.	St
1.3.7	No magic needed.	St
1.3.8	Kees	St
