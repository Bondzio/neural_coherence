<s> you simply need a router. </s>
<s> That's essentially what a wireless router does: turn your connection into a wi-fi hotspot for your house. </s>
<s> so the wired internet connection goes in..........and i have a wifi card in each pc....and thats it.............???? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Yeah. </s>
<s> It works like this: You hook a wireless router up to your cable/DSL modem. </s>
<s> All of the computers that you'd like to connect wirelessly need to have a wireless adapter. </s>
<s> Most new laptops already have this built-in. </s>
<s> You can also have wired connections to the wireless router if you don't want to use wireless for all computers. </s>
<s> ok just tell if i got this right 1.) </s>
<s> I get a wireless router and adapters for my PC's as you say... </s>

<s> tell me what hardware i will be needing to do so. </s>
<s> NOTE THAT I AM USING A WIRELESS USB NET CONNECTER AND NOT A WIRED BROADBAND. </s>
<s> Your WiFi enabled phone is able to use the same WiFi source as your desktop. </s>
<s> No extra hardware necessary. </s>

<s> i am using internet connection on my desktop through &quot;TATA PHOTON NETCONNECTOR&quot; which is an USB device(dongle) which i plug in my desktop and use internet through it. </s>
<s> my desktop DOES NOT have any wifi capabilities. </s>
<s> now i wish to share my net connection from my desktop with my phones(which are wifi enabled). </s>
<s> Thus suggest me devices through which i can create an wifi hotspot in my desktop to share internet with my phone.. </s>
<s> Thanks and regards </s>
<s> That dongle isn't a WiFi dongle, it's a 3G dongle. </s>
<s> And you're phone is not 3G, it's only WiFi. </s>
<s> The 2 ways to do that seem to me: 1. </s>
<s> The device from http://www.tataphoton.com/photon-wi-fi-hub.aspx combined with a wireless WiFi dongle in your PC 2. </s>
<s> Using Internet Connection Sharing on your PC, then connect that to a wireless router that you setup as being an access point. </s>
<s> Method 1 is basic. </s>
<s> The main disadvantages of method 2 are (a) configuring ICS seems to be prohibitively difficult and (b) your PC needs to be switched on to use Internet on your phone. </s>
