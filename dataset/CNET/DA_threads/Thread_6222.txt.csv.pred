1.1.1	In mobile adhoc network which is not fixed, there is a centralized node and other 100 nodes are at 1 hop and 2 hop distances and so on..	St
1.1.2	Calculate the distance for 1 hop, 2 hop till 100.	St
1.1.3	Also consider an other network with 200 nodes containing the nodes at 1 hop and 2 hop from the centralized node.	St
1.1.4	Calculate the probability of accessing the centralized node and also compare the probability of both network with 100 and 200 nodes.	St
1.2.1	There are no such networks so the answer is that you'll never encounter such in real life.	St
1.2.2	Yes, in the past they tried this concept in the &quot;Ricochet&quot; service and products but it's long gone and a testament to the idea.	St
1.2.3	Don't let anyone talk you into figuring this out or investing in it.	Sug
