For the new year I thought I'd build myself a new computer, but Ihave encountered some problems and I thought I'd ask for some help. System specs: Mobo: Asus P5W DH Deluxe Processor: Intel D850 Dual Core RAM: 512 Power Supply: Xilence Power 600W Hard Drive: Barracuda 7200 80 Gigs DVD ROM: Samsung writemaster Video Card: MSI NX7100GS I only installed the basic hardware just to get the system up and running. The hard drive is an old drive that I had in another PC. The PC boot up but stuck in the Bios screen and does not go past that. It recognized the hard drive and DVD-ROM drive. I have checked ASUS' website it suggested to update the bios if the PC felt to boot. As per ASUS's &quot;This problem can be resolved by updating BIOS to 0604 or later. Please use a non-Core 2 processor to boot and perform this BIOS update.&quot; My question is: Since I don't have another processor to perform the upgrade, is there any other way of upgrading the BIOS? Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Cheers and Happy New Year to everyone. Garry

Exactly what does it do when you turn it on? VAPCMD
7432	4	227177	2368077	2367902	garryg11	1/7/07 6:40 AM	1.168152E12	Yes that CPU support all BIOS	Yes the ATX12V cable is connected to the board. It's safe to say the processor and the motherboard should work together. I have checked the link you provided and my bios version is Rev:1.03G higher than Rev:B0 version listed on the website http://support.asus.com/cpusupport/cpusupport.aspx?SLanguage=en-us&model=P5W%20DH%20Deluxe ..so I can safe say it's not the bios that's causing it not to work. I'm getting a one beep during the bootup process. According to the User Guide manual, the possible errors could be: &quot;keyboard controller error&quot;, &quot;Refresh time error&quot;, or &quot;No Master drive detected&quot;. 1. The keyboard is working fine, because I'm able to navigate within the Bios screen. 2. I don't know what they mean by Refresh time error, so I have to look into that. If you know what ii is, please tell me. 3. No Master drive detected - but I can see the drive description within the bios screen. Any suggestions as to what I should do next? In the meantime I will try to find out any info on Refresh time error. Thanks a million for your help...looking forward to your reply.
