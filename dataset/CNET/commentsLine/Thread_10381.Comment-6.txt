unfortunately you have not told us the info that would make the answer accurate.
most good quality modern motherboards require you use the memory in pairs and that is essential to get the top bus speeds.
if you use only one stick it may not work at all or definitely will only get you half the speed the bus is supposed to run at.
using 1 pc3200 stick gets you 400mhz bus speeed, using 2 in pairs (in slots that use them that way) gets you 800mhz.
which do you think is better?
now if you have a cheap motherboard it may not have the higher 800mhz speed and may not work with memory in pairs, in that case you can do what you wish.
since you didn't tell us what motherboard you have we really can't give you the answer you really should have.
