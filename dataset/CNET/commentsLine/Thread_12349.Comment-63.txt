well, i can't be ojective because linksys is the only router for both wired and wireless that i have used.
i've been very happy with it.
i did have some trouble connecting my wireless router to my notebook but after 3 phone calls the last customer representative i got was so helpful and patient in helping me get my wireless connected and the wireless security.
overall, whenever i've had to call linksys whether asking for information or trying to correct a problem (very, very few) i have been very pleased with their customer service.
if the customer service is outstanding overall, i feel confident in buying their products.
