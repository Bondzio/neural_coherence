What my goal is, is to do a sort of pulse width modulation (pwm) though this. in more detail i want to generate a DCC (digital command control) signal, as it is used in the model railroad. I would need to alternate &quot;1&quot; and &quot;0&quot; states either every 116 microseconds or 232 microseconds. depending on the limitations I would consider researching real time systems, although in my scenario I might not have to.
