3827	1	514539	5068793	5068287	Steven Haninger	1/22/11 3:30 AM	1.295667E12	You didn't mention your purpose, price range	or required speed. Personally, I always liked 3Com but they got bought by HP. We picked up a 48 port baseline model for our school. Its auto-sensing, 10/100 with a gigabit uplink and has worked fine. We've a couple of 24 port 3Coms and one POE used for the wireless system. None have ever had a problem. These are all their &quot;baseline&quot; models which are unmanaged, rack mountable and moderately priced. I'll recommend 3Com any day if you can still find their products but more about your needs would be helpful.

Here's a 48 port POE switch they offer. I don't know the price and suspect it might make me drop over. http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/switches/ps5718/ps9967/ps9985/data_sheet_c78-502075.html

This device is end of life and end of support so don't pay a lot for it maybe $100 All depends what you want to do with it, if you just want to hook a bunch of stuff to your router it will do fine even if you run vlans and such. Note this is a managed switch, you may have to do some basic config.

Digital phones need power and this is why I wondered if POE would be a better choice. I think you've not given enough details as to exactly what you want to accomplish but if all you want is a 48 port un-managed switch, you are can pick any name brand that offers such and consider it to be expendable.

3827	9	514539	5070016	5069949	Steven Haninger	1/24/11 10:55 AM	1.2958665E12	But it's not completely unmanaged	You did say you wanted VOIP and 48 ports but what I see is a business use system. If you're using VOIP type phones such as I've seen in some environments, they need to be powered by something. I can't imagine 48 wall outlets so suggested the POE switch. These will power phones but not all of the ports will necessarily have that power on by default. You turn power on only to the ports that need to power devices and you have a maximum amount of current to work with. There is some management involved with POE switches but it's not all that technical if it's just power management. But, if you've already got power to all of your phones via some other method, you can still use a baseline switch. I just thought this would eliminate a lot of extra wiring by getting it from the switch. It's up to you since we really cannot envision the scope of the entire project.
