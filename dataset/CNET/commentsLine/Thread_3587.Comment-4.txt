my hp d4999t is pretty stock with 4gb ram, one hdd, 2 dvdrw drives and a some nvidia 1gb 240 or such card.
on the p3 watt meter it's at 200 watts when a 3d game runs so i don't worry about it's stock 300 watt psu.
it's a little tight and while i like to run at 50% or less of the rating this machine is rather dated so we'll just let it be.
