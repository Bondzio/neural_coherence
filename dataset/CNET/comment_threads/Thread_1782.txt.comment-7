Thanks for all your help so far guys!
So I think what it's coming down to for me is the screen size and whether or not I should upgrade to the 4mb.
I'm stuck between the 13&quot; and the 15&quot;.. what do you guys prefer?
Also, will 4mb be a drastic improvement for a laptop, or will 2mb suffice?
Thanks!
