i want a burner to just back up digital pictures and maybe convert some old vhs movies to dvd.
i have been looking at the sony but while at walmart noticed the lite-on dual layer that uses all +/- formats.
it also comes with the nero software and some others as well.
i believe it was $109.00 not a bad price and about $70.00 cheaper than the sony.
will it hold up do you guys think?
thanks.
