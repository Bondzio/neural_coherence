I'v just bought one and to my dissappointment, I think the scanning quality is quite bad. Attached a scanned sample here: [IMG] http://i29.photobucket.com/albums/c267/liewss80/hp-scanner.jpg [/IMG] (If cant view the above pic, goto http://i29.photobucket.com/albums/c267/liewss80/hp-scanner.jpg ) Check out those straight lines in the attached picture, my original drawing is a very clean-cut straightline, very fine but my scanned result is like this. Its the problem with my scanner or setting? Any advise/comment? Thank you Regards, Sean liewss80@yahoo.com

Don't think it comes with money back satisfaction guarantee. I just wanna find out whether all this model have such problem or the prob with my unit only... TQ

At 600x1200 DPI, on screen will be at most 100 DPI so it will be like looking at it at 72X under a microscope. Be sure to view onscreen at something reasonable. Wish I had your setup to test, but armed with only this discussion, it's defective and needs to be returned. Bob
