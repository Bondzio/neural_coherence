<s> My 802.11g connection on my Toshiba A-35 notebook (XP) allows me to drink beer in my back yard and surf the internet as it communicates with my 802.11b Linksys Wireless 4-Port Router that provides cable modem access. </s>
<s> But now, I want the same mobility that will allow me to sit on the beach at Galveston; or sit on the river bank in Big Bend Nat'l Park; or as a passenger in a car driving to Dallas; and I want broadband fast connectivity. </s>
<s> Is this possible yet? </s>
<s> Details....? </s>
<s> Remember that 2.4GBz is that same frequency range as your Microwave oven. </s>
<s> Now a little issue of how to double the coverage of a Radio signal. </s>
<s> You need 4 times the power for each doubling of the distance. </s>
<s> Starting at only 200 milliwatts for your best WiFi Wireless Access Point (WAP) as a baseline, we can figure what it takes to reach out to you at 100 miles away. </s>
<s> Let's peg that full speed 802.11a at 11 megabits to work super at 41.25 feet and see what Watts we need at 1 mile? </s>
<s> OK BPBASIC Ready&gt; 64000 Bytes free 41.25 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 5280 feet. </s>
<s> 0.2W * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 25.6 Watts End BPBASIC Now if we want to go from 1 mile to 20 miles we just keep going. </s>
<s> 2 miles = 51.2 Watts 4 miles = 102.4 Watts 8 miles = 204.8 Watts 16 miles = 409.6 Watts 32 miles = 819.2 Watts Yes, we have about the power of your average household Microwave oven at 20 miles. </s>
<s> Not only do we need this much power in the WAP, but about that much in you lap PC-Card. </s>
<s> Looks like WiFi in your card will have some problems. </s>

<s> What a bummer, Mr. Moderator. </s>
<s> So what's the answer? </s>
<s> Vacationing last week in Hawaii, there were &quot;hot spots&quot; in most of the local coffee houses that would give you a password for about $10 per day. </s>
<s> Being the cheapskates that we are, we opted for dial-up access (56k), which felt like reverting back to the 50's because it was so slow. </s>
<s> But I've heard of &quot;access&quot; thru your cellular phone, also &quot;satellite&quot; service (for the mobile computer-guy). </s>
<s> What's the story? </s>
<s> Are there any holy grails out there that are functional? </s>

<s> Are there any holy grails out there that are functional?&quot; The cellular phone is about 115K or so baud. </s>
<s> Nothing spectacular from what I've seen and pricey. </s>
<s> You'd rack up 10+ bucks in charges from what I've seen. </s>
<s> The hot-spots are bargains for today. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Did you ever find a solution to your question? </s>
<s> I have the same questions. </s>
<s> Does anyone out there know of ways to have a laptop get internet access in a park or on a lake or in a car? </s>
<s> The cell co's ARE expensive and need monthly service plans, and what if you're not near their towers? </s>
<s> Do they &quot;roam&quot; like a cell phone and use other co's towers? </s>
<s> What about a satellite company like he asks about. </s>
<s> Anyone know who the &quot;satellite&quot; companies are? </s>
<s> (not for putting a dish in home/office, but for when outside or travelling!) </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> In the past we had Richochet (modems) and in some places you can pick up WiFi such as a local bookstore for free. </s>
<s> In the future we have WiMax, but all this takes time unless you are lucky to have the Richochet up in your area. </s>
