i have an intel 2.6ghz which is working very well.
my temperature is ok but i still want it to be cooler.
it is always displaying 42 c and i would like to lower it.
i have not oc'd it.
i know that 42 c isn't a big deal, but i would like to have a more efficient fan/hs anyway.
i have three case fans (two exhaust fans in the back and one sucking air into the case on the side of the same).
does anyone know about a top of the line fan for my processor in order to keep it even cooler?
i want a better fan/heatsink (not the thermal paste since i think that means that you can't get the hs/fan off anymore) for top $50.
thank you.
