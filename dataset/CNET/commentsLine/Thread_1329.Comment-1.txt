hello, the bios of my foxonn a7gm-s mobo won't detect my sata hd ( western digital caviar 160gb 7200 rpm 8mb cache 3.0gb/s).
it did detect a dvd sata drive, so the sata cable and connectors appear to be working properly.
i've configured the bios, as far as i can tell, so that a sata hd should be detected.
i have not installed the os yet; it will be windows xp pro.
sure would appreciate any suggestions, thanks!
