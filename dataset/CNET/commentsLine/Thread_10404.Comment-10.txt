of being unfortunate batch received.
similar to mobile phones in which not all batches are produced with same longivety, and odd ones will slip out.
quality checks are also randomly selected, thus, it may have een missed.
one won't go checking all million of manufactured ones as it will take ages to complete.
likewise, like some previous battery recalls, some of those with faults have been shipped out, and although not all of the same batches may be affected.
i have unfortunate experience before with such stuffs and this is despite my friend have the same stuff from the same batch, his was ok and vice versa.
so, yup, that's why i mentioned it as possibility.
