I will look into each suggestion further.
But the stop gap measure that I tried seems to working, and indicates an overheating problem.
I have the side panel off the unit, and have a fan blowing directly on the computer.
It has stayed on for 12 hours or more at a time.
I can see where these forums are a big help for those of us who are a bit mechanically inclined.
Thank you.
Sheila
