locked sata ports don't increase in frequency with the fsb when overclocking.
unlocked ones do, and therefore will corrupt the hard drives on them.
as for overclocking, i am currently overclocking my 3800 x2 (stock 3ghz) at 3.5ghz, so i am not new to it.
i understand the risks involved and have a pretty good grasp on how to do it and what's involved.
i am just wondering about the oc ratings because i haven't seen them before.
i think they probably mean the board is guaranteed to be stable at those speeds, meaning up to them you are limited only by your other components' capabilities, but i am not sure.
as for $120 to reset the cmos, don't you think that's pretty steep?
you're basically figuring on at least a few hundred dollars an hour there assuming it takes you a very long time of about 20 minutes to open the computer up and move the jumper or pop the battery.
