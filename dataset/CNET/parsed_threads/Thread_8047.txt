<s> I've got an eMachines ET1331G-03W, and I want to install XP Pro x64 on it, so I can play games that don't support the factory-installed Windows 7 Home Premium, which I upgraded to Professional with my own key, and I know how bad XP is with drivers on a fresh install. </s>
<s> I need some drivers to keep on my flash drive, can anyone help out? </s>
<s> http://www.emachines.com/support/drivers.html Desktop &gt; ET Series &gt; ET1331G Those drivers only work on 7, so can anyone help me out? </s>
<s> I have that and why wouldn't I use that? </s>
<s> As to the drivers, good hunting. </s>
<s> It's getting harder and going to get worse. </s>
<s> Read another reason why at http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8557144.stm Again, good luck in your XP 64 bit driver hunt. </s>
<s> XP 32 bit drivers were not as hard but the version of XP (64) you are looking for means that it is almost assured most drivers will be never found. </s>

<s> that I want to go down to XP is, I wanna be able to play some games that just don't support 7...yet. </s>
<s> I'm all up for dual-booting XP and 7, I already know how to do that. </s>
<s> I'll just need to acquire the right drivers, and then the rest will most likely be easy as pie. </s>
<s> It appears you need to research XP Mode more. </s>
<s> It's a nice feature that I'm finding folk to need catching up on. </s>
<s> Hope your machine has the CPU with VTx enabled. </s>

<s> I have had XP mode for a while now, but it doesn't offer 32 bit color...Is there a workaround? </s>
<s> Read http://www.sevenforums.com/virtualization/32942-i-got-xp-mode-display-24-bit-color-integration.html There may be someone that found a way to 32 bit color but it will take time for everyone to catch up and figure out all the tricks. </s>

<s> I never really was a big fan of windows in general, but to be able to run my adobe products i need windows and for anything past cs2 wine can not run it. </s>
<s> I have gotten the drivers before from talking to Emachine web tech support, i had to talk to 4 different people but i did get a copy of the drivers needed for xp on my machine ( et1331G-o5w) so they are out there just might have to talk to few different tech support people or go on a good search. </s>
