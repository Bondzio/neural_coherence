1.2.1	A netbook is just the same as a laptop , but it 's smaller , lighter and slower , it has a keyboard that 's unsuitable to type on , a screen that 's too small for everyday use , it usually does n't have a CD- or DVD-drive and it 's hardly suitable to play games .	St
1.2.2	It 's hardly imagineable somebody would buy one as their primary machine .	St
1.2.3	But it 's nice if you go backpacking and want to check your mail , provided you can find a hotspot for the Internet access .	St
1.2.4	Most netbooks come with Windows XP , although you might find others with Linux or Windows 7 .	St
1.2.5	So to answer your questions : 1 .	St
1.2.6	Yes , you can use it with a wireless printer ( provided it has a driver for the OS on the netbook ) .	St
1.2.7	2 .	St
1.2.8	Yes , you can use the same parental control options as on your own laptop .	St
1.2.9	That 's totally independent of the hardware .	St
1.2.10	But do n't expect too much from that .	St
1.2.11	3 .	St
1.2.12	A wireless modem/router is a very good thing to use to connect to the Internet from 2 or 3 or 4 laptops simultaneously .	St
1.2.13	Kees	St
1.3.1	Yes , you will be able to use a wireless printer for printing documents .	St
1.3.2	most notebooks and netbooks sold today have built in wireless capabilities .	St
1.3.3	no worries on setting that up , that must be found on the manual .	Res
