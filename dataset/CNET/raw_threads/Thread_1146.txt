My old PC is working fine, but won't recognise hard drives over 40GB. So I've a choice between using a smaller (second user) drive, or buying a new motherboard. Any other suggestions? Hope the question's clear enough; I'm new round here Cheers, SJ

Its important, as then you could partition a large HD into smaller partitions under 40gb, probably 32gb as the limit for each partition. Did you visit the HD makers website for HD install s/w to help install beyond whatever the bios limits are? good luck -----Willy
