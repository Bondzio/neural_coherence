this is about my hard drive problem.
i used spinrite 6 to recover my data but as of the moment or within 12hours of waiting it is still in .14% of 99.86%.
i just wonder if this is totaly hang or do i need to wait until it was finish.
the .14% is just started at about 11hours ago as of this writing...(1 hour when i started to run spinrite 6 at my laptop.
i just wonder if there is a fast way that i can recover my harddrive or even my data only.... i shall appreciate advice of everyone...thanks
