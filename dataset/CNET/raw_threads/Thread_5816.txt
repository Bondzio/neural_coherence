All of a sudden I get the subject error message. System lites up and I see the Dell screen then it beeps twice and posts the error message and F1 to continue, F2 to go to setup. Tried both but keep coming back to same error. I've reversed the drives (Master/Slave) and still get it. I can't believe that both drives died at the same time. When power is on with case open I can feel vibration in the drives as though they are spinning. Cooling fans are running. Checked power leads to drives with VOM and detect voltage present. Where do I start CPU?/Motherboard?/ BIOS? Any help appreciated.

Try with only one HD installed, the other disconnected entirely but not removed. make sure jumper reflect what that brand should be for solo HD. If you had this system for sometime, maybe the bios(CMOS) battery is weak, replace. tada -----Willy

I repaired the installation of Win XP on the 40gig drive and system is back up and running. Thanks to all for your help. Jim
