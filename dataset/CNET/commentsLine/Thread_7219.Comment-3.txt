i just did.
there's scads of support and contact options.
re transform and lighting for a new card, simply call their sales department.
you can usually con one of them to find the answer for you.
i have always found them to go out of their way to help.
of course, one cannot start by yelling at them and telling them their stuff is junk as i suspect some others have done, then they complain here about the lack of support.
not implying that about you in any way.
