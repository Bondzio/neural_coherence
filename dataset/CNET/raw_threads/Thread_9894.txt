For myself- should I partition it into say two 465 pieces and be happy or split into even more parts, or - leave it alone. Reason I ask is client machine ten or eleven weeks ago I installed one (After formatting by itself, only drive connected, using Partition Magic-NTFS-etc- single partition.) I could tell a slowing down of the overall running of the computer. (XP all patches-sp3-etc) They needed it for movie and audio storage. They didn't seem to notice the reduction in speed, have had no problems with it. About to have myself one and can't seem to find a definite yea or nay on the impact or the slow down of that large of a drive. (Machine = Asus P5VDX mb, P4D @3.4, 2gb ram, Nvidia 7600 gs graphics.

You separate the OS and its files from work data or results/storage elsewhere. If the system fails you can more readily access the data in some form. Why, because all too often its the OS and and/or some work pgm. at fault when s/w related. As you've noticed a minor performance increase as the system knows where to go and not fiddle through a huge cache or amount of files to access something. Remember its what the user wants or desires. However, if it works OK allow it to proceed until it bletches. If you can remember in days past, having partitions was still common but the amount of storage for data has increased thus the lost will too. There is a big difference in 120gb vs 1tb. for storage loss. IMHO, that's my story -----Willy

I verified it after first installing their 1Tb drive- most things seemed to drag a little. about like the differenc when you have fresh loaded xp and run it a while then use the performance tune app to 'Adjust for best Performance' then turn on mouse shadows and a couple of other preferences but not that whole sack of stuff MS wants you to have. Remove the 1TB and things were back to lickety quickety. I guess to really know I'd need to partition it and then fill it up and see if things slowed down.

If you divided into 2x500gb partitions those are still huge partitions but it is stiller smaller than 1tb. When HDs get that huge the benefits may diminish abit but it holds true smaller is better. FYI, the need for backups, etc., will benefit as insurance against any data lost for any size HD. tada -----Willy

Multiple times of different variations- always get the 110 error. Checked two more 1tb hard drives- same thing. What is the deal? Looked at Samsung Disk setup software and DO NOT want to use some kind of overlay software they want you to use. Anyone know if 1Tb hard drives just do this because they are so big?

I usually don't use PM in any form if I can avoid it. I use the HD makers s/w which in many cases is just fine and more to the point. However, Samsung is outside of this group of good HD s/w providers. As for PM, it tends to create an extra layer for its use and recovery process. I suggest contact PM support and see what they offer in reply, I believe they too have a public forum to post. tada ------Willy

After looking at Samsung software I wished for something as good as the old, old Maxtor setup discs. I wound up using the Samsung 'Hutil' to clear the PBR, Mbr, etc then booted with it connected and used XP's disc initialize and split function. Seems to be working ok. Now to fill it up and see if the speed is any better. (Three equal sized partitions-btw)

(after splitting into thirds)	Questions previously posed- I used the Samsing 'Hutil' software to clear the drive to as near nothing as they would let you-then used Zap63 (on the MES disk I've had forever) booted into winxp (WD 160 that is basic OS and some stash of setup backups. Used winxp to initialize, format, divide, etc etc. Recognition is perfect- works fine in four computers (Checked this morning) loaded all the stash video and audio stuff onto the partitions and installed into the computer where it's going to live from now on. And - YES - its much faster with partitions. I have no idea what the ideal split would be but I can live with thirds no problem. I wonder what the &quot;Data Books&quot; with 1 and 2 tera bytes use for setup and so on?

If you're still having worries regarding slow performance on this hard drive in your XP system, my recommendation is to check whether you need Intel's Application Accelerator. See this link for info: http://www.intel.com/support/chipsets/iaa/sb/cs-009293.htm You may not need it at all, but your description of your slower performance immediately reminded me of my experience with this issue. Here's what happened to me. . . At the time, my system was a Dell XP2 box with just one internal ATA hard drive. I had been using an external drive connected via USB 2 to do my backups; the backups used to take about 25 minutes to complete. However, I added a second internal ATA hard drive with a capacity of 250 GBytes. I used the Seagate setup utility that came with the drive and the setup &quot;complained&quot; that my system, as it was then configured, could not handle a drive that big. However, the setup utility offered to fix that for me by merely selecting an option it offered (I cannot recall what it did). I selected that option and successfully formatted the entire drive to function as one 250 GByte partition. All seemed okay, but I soon realized something must be wrong when I decided to do one of those backups of my primary drive and I wrote the image onto the new second hard drive instead of the external USB drive. The problem was that the backups that used to take just 25 minutes on the external drive now took more than THREE HOURS to complete when writing the image to the new secondary internal drive. &quot;How could that be,&quot; I wondered. How could an internal drive be so much slower than an external drive? I looked around and that's when I learned about the Intel Application Accelerator. After installing their &quot;accelerator&quot; (which is really a replacement for your system's ATA drivers), that immediately fixed the slow performance problem and full backups to the new hard drive were taking just under 25 minutes again. Big difference, huh? Over three hours vice 25 minutes. Check to see whether you need these ATA drivers and perhaps that will fix your performance issues. Good luck and tell us how it turns out. Tony

Like I said -there may be some optimal ratio, or size numbers, but for me-for now, thirds is fine.

But some thought they could save APPLICATIONS from needing a reinstall by putting them on their own partition. Sadly they learn that doesn't work. Let's be clear. Reinstalling the OS destroys install applications. And while some thought that putting their personal files on it's own partition, our forums are filled with pleas on how to recover their files. So with that all I can offer is we only backup what we can't lose. Bob

I use a 2nd internal hard disk drive just for separate comp-ressed backup images of C: and D: ...so if the need arises I could restore C: from a compressed image without affecting the data on D: . If drive 0 dies ....I just replace it and restore the images from the 2nd HDD. Has really worked well for me. I also have copies of the compressed images on an external and hopefully I'll never have to use them. VAPCMD PS...RAID not part of the equation.
