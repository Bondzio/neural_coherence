i have a 2wire dsl modem and last year set up a wireless network for my nearby laptop and my pc downstairs.
due to problems since day 1 i'd rather have a wired connection downstairs.
i don't care about having a network, sharing files between the two computers, etc.
can i just connect my pc to the filtered phone jack downstairs?
can the laptop still be wireless upstairs or does that need to be wired too?
thanks so much!
