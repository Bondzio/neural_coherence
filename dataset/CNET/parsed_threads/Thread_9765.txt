<s> Hello ,I have an &quot;Optiplex GX280 ,I have 4 slots for memory and &quot;Crucial says after a scan that I can max out at 4GB's. </s>
<s> I have purchased 4 1GB sticks of memory ,I've installed them and when the PC turns on it says it has 4 GB's of memory but when I click on &quot;system information ,it reads only 2.99 Gb's . </s>
<s> what's the deal ??? </s>
<s> I appreciate any help ,thanks ! </s>

<s> That's normal for any 32-bit OS. </s>
<s> My Windows 7 system (where I type this) says &quot;Installed RAM: 4 GB&quot;, &quot;Total physical memory 2.93 GB&quot;. </s>
<s> I assume most of that missing 1 GB is used for video, because it doesn't have a separate video card. </s>
<s> But I don't really care. </s>
