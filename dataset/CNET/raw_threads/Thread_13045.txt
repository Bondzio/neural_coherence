If i use the USB - it doesn't work, and It won't read through the USB port on the printer either - But the Printer will print the pictures on the camera - what's the deal?

While http://www.usbman.com often laments that the motherboard drivers are not loaded or the USB ports are not enabled, you posted far too little comments about your machine to go very deep into your issue.
