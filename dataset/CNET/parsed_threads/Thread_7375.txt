<s> What is the best external TV tuner/ analog to digital video converter for a new IMac. </s>
<s> Can it process HDTV yet? </s>
<s> ie-Miglia or Plextor </s>
<s> Isn't HDTV already digital? </s>
<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television writes about an analog high def but that was in 1936. </s>
<s> Since this is a world wide forum, what's available here may not be in your country. </s>
<s> Here's my suggestion. </s>
<s> Look at the Apple store and ask them then check your usual Apple web sites such as macally and more. </s>
<s> Then share your findings here for comment. </s>
<s> If you are trying to capture HDTV then you also know the makers are not too keen on giving that capability to the public. </s>

<s> yes. </s>
<s> high def is digital but not all digital is high def </s>
<s> You can read up on that, but at least you can toss up a few tuners for people to comment on. </s>
