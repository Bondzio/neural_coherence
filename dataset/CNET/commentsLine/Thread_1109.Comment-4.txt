is two years considered old for a hard drive or processor?
i can see where a fan might wear out or begin to, but a hard drive?
anyway, i'll take your advice and try and get an exact location of the sound.
by the way, if it happens to be the hd or the pocessor, i'm gonna be back here needing help installing the new one.
is it hard to transfer everything from one hard drive to a new one?
is hard to install a new processor?
just thinking out loud.
gary,
