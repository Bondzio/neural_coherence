I have seen USB devices that were detected in the startup.
There were several machines with AOpen boards and a SATA RAID controller that could not have any usb device with memory pluged into it, not even a label printer or it would look at it first before the PCI RAID card.
If it can happen accidently, then it is only a matter of time before the it can be repeated
