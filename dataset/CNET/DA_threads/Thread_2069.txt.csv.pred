1.1.1	I have inherited an old 500Mhz machine that I am looking to turn into a media server .	St
1.1.2	It came with a 10GB HD , so for obvious reasons , I 'm looking to increase the storage .	St
1.1.3	I have found a 300 GB ATA/133 that I am interested in , but I do n't know if my machine can handle it .	St
1.1.4	Are there maximums for a machine 's HD size ?	Ques
1.1.5	Also , before I buy a hard drive , I want to make sure it has a compatible interface .	St
1.1.6	I know my machine works with ATA drives , and this drive says it uses parallel ATA .	St
1.1.7	Is this the same thing ?	Ques
1.1.8	My machine is a HP Pavillion 6630 .	St
1.1.9	Thanks in advance !	St
1.1.10	Trish	St
1.2.1	They both are the same thing , PATA and ATA .	St
1.2.2	You should be good to go with the 300gb , but to make sure : What OS are you using ?	Ques
1.2.3	And you are putting the 300GB on the NTFS file type , correct ?	Ques
1.2.4	Sometimes old OS 's wo n't allow or wo n't recognize the full size of the hard drive .	St
1.2.5	~Ibrahim	St
1.3.1	Not even worth to turn into a server , with those low specs .	St
1.3.2	How long would it take to upload the files ... 300gb could take weeks , non-stop .	St
1.3.3	Roger	St
1.4.1	I agree with Roger , making a media server out of that ? ? ?	Ques
1.4.2	Go try but you wo n't have any fun .	St
1.4.3	You can get a new computer or build one your own .	St
1.5.1	Those older PIII systems almost always need to have an ATA/100 or ATA/133 hard disk controller card added to a PCI slot to use drives over 137GB .	St
1.5.2	You also need an operating system that supports large HS 's .	St
1.5.3	References : http : //www.seagate.com/support/kb/disc/capacity/index.html http : //www.48bitlba.com/	St
1.6.1	I would not sink much money into it .	St
1.6.2	$ $ $ Harddrive + more memory ++++Etc = You can buy a cheap computer and have a machine that will work for you a lot better .	St
1.6.3	Some media cameras , mp3 players want USB 2.0 or you will need alot of patience .	St
1.6.4	Read some of your media apps requirements they also may want a bigger system .	St
1.6.5	I have 2 desktops that are 400 mhz they are great for the kids to surf the net and play older games .	St
1.6.6	I wo n't upgrade the computers .	St
1.6.7	I bought myself a new Computer and they have the older ones .	St
1.7.1	it just not worth it to turn that old thing into a media server .	St
1.7.2	like everyone else said -- -slow -slow and just slow- ! !	St
1.7.3	u could just buy an emachine desktop for $ 550 emachines are not bad as ppl think they are .	St
1.7.4	they have good quality with bring cheap .	St
1.7.5	i had a dell and then i bought another desktop ( e-machines ) everything is awesome - i am gamer and so i buy a lot of PC games and emachines never let me down .	St
1.7.6	i actually got it for multimedia purposes and it has never ever let me down except for the fact that i have been having problem with burning from cd-r/dvd combo drive but they have a really good tech support .	St
1.7.7	and it was n't the computer 's fault either .	St
1.7.8	the person from the tech support said that i mus have downloaded some software and when i uninstalled it , it probably deleted some of my file , and the tech person gave me instructions on how to solve it , too .	St
1.7.9	also , i download a lot of free software from internet especially from download.com and unistall a lot of them , too and the comp .	St
1.7.10	never caused any problems in that either .	St
1.7.11	for $ 550 , u will probably get ( if u look for deal in flyers -- there are many every two weeks of so ) 1gig DDRAM atleast 160gig HDD Microsoft Media Center 2005 ( i recommened it ) some good graphics card ( probably ATI ) wat else do u need ? ? ? ! ! !	Ques
