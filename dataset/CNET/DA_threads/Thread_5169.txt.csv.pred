1.1.1	Hi !	St
1.1.2	When trying to play & quot ; Age of Conan & quot ; or & quot ; FreeRealms & quot ; , or the Star Trek online beta after a few minutes I get a crash , which according to Win7 is being caused by ATIKMAG ... . Just upgraded drivers and Catalyst control center to 09.12 ( also tried removing the catalyst control center because a post on the web said that might be the problem ( it was n't ) .	St
1.1.3	Tried switching off Aero , tried 9.12 hotfix , tried re-seating memory ( ran windows & quot ; memory diagnostics utility & quot ; showed no problems ) nothing doing any good ... Help please !	St

1.2.1	http : //processorfinder.intel.com/details.aspx ? sSpec=SLAPL notes this CPU to have a system bus speed of 1333 MHz and yours is 1993 .	St
1.2.2	Is this overclocked ?	Ques
1.2.3	Hint : Do n't .	St

1.3.1	Here are a few troubleshooting items which you may have overlooked .	St
1.3.2	Sometimes a small problem can cause so much chain reaction .	St
1.3.3	Right now we 've got a lot on our plate if we go at it one by one , but here 's are some places to start : Insufficient Power Bad Memory Modules Over Clocking Motherboard/Memory Compatibility Overheating Defective Motherboard	St
1.4.1	I do n't really know how it got set that way , I could n't even find how to change it directly in Bios - ended up changing general settings to low-safe ( ca n't remember what it called it ) .	St
1.4.2	This changed it to 1333 , have n't had a chance to see if it did any good .	St
1.4.3	Did notice that a hardware monitor program showed something in red zone heat right after re-booting ( after one of these crashes ) , unfortunately I 'm not sure exactly what it 's telling me is the particular heat problem ...	St
1.4.4	It lists Mainboard ( ok ) , CPU ( ok ) , temp 3 ( which has no sensor ) , and CPU0 Core ( which is where the red showed up ) .	St
1.4.5	why it shows CPU ok , and CPU0 Core as a problem , I do n't know what it 's listing as this CPU0 Core that i need to address ... .	St
1.5.1	Ok that you changed it to stock which may help but have the machine 's builder pull the heatsink off the CPU and drop some fresh heatsink paste there .	St
1.5.2	Then have them make sure the heatsink is in solid contact and fans to working .	St
1.5.3	For heat issues it 's very important to clear those up as it ages parts and machine quickly .	St
1.5.4	A 5 year machine will see trouble after the first year .	St
1.5.5	Bob	St
1.6.1	I do n't understand what I 'm seeing here , I 'm seeing 22C for the CPU , 41C for both core 0 , and Core 1 .	St
1.7.1	That you ca n't trust the temperature sensors or software .	St
