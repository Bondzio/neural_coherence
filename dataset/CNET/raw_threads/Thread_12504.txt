If I were building ...I might look at this MB. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128387 Re the HDD...I'd look here.. good buyer ratings, large cache buffer (32MB) and 5 year warranty http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136319 What about RAM ? VAPCMD PS...It's easier to help if you provide LINKs to the products you want feedback on.
