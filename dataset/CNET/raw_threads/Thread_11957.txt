Try going to run, type msconfig hit OK . on the first page [I believe] click advanced and put an X into the box that says something about limit memory to 512 MB. See how it works then.

Thanks anyway

Use XP Pro system alternate days. 76 years old and simply trying to not refuse to try new things. No other reason for using XP. I even refuse to use the classical screen to force to learn something a little different. LOL
