ComputerWiz, Todays systems will not reconize what you are attempting to do.
Two monitors will give you the ability to have two applications visible but you can only work in one of the application at a time.
(I run 3 monitors) Unless you pick up a Jetway http://www.jetwaycomputer.com/ Then you have to worry about cable length.
