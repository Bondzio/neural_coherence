12556	0	155987	1732816	NR	Bandy(yfi)	2/9/06 6:19 PM	1.13950914E12	WISP - Expansion Questions	I currently run two towers each with Ornico 2500 Ap's and Proxim Gold Cards. the first runs 3 x 120 degree antennas with 1watt amps and the 2nd runs 2X 180 degree antennas with 1 watt amps. I run on the 2.4frequency at 802.11b To expand with I have 4 other AP ( 2500's) and 8 gold cards. I have many good tower (silo) location(s) and a clear LOS for a double bounce into a town with limited Internet speeds. Also high number of customers within range of the first tower. My main Questions are: - What would be the best method of transmitting signal from one of my current two towers to a second location , allowing me to rebroadcast there. ? ( I have DBL 2300's , smartbridges , Dlink dsa 3100 and 24dBi dishes) . - Once I get the back-haul setup I'm wondering the best method to transmit - I like the 180 degree we seem to get good coverage and two blades only take one AP. Will an Omni serve the same customer base with a single AP and only one card ? - We like the distance we get with the 120 degree blades but we have our channels all used - how would you coordinate a bounce in this case.? Would changing the frequency (for the bounce) be a way to avoid channel clashing? - I'd love some info on splitters or filters or whatever allows you to run two or three blades on one channel - That would save me a lot of problems. Thanks In advance for the help anyone can give me - Really ! Bandy.

( I have DBL 2300's , smartbridges , Dlink dsa 3100 and 24dBi dishes NC&gt; In order to avoide interference, use 5 GHz backhaul. You might like to consider smartBridges multiband airHaul solution. Once I get the back-haul setup I'm wondering the best method to transmit - I like the 180 degree we seem to get good coverage and two blades only take one AP. Will an Omni serve the same customer base with a single AP and only one card ? NC&gt; Sector antenna is always prefered over Omni. Best Regards, Naveen
