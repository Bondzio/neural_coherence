i recently discovered the smc barricade broadband router i use does not allow me to log the ip addresses of external clients accessing an apache web server which sits behind the router.
is there some special protocol or feature i should look for in a router so that i can log external ip addresses, or can anyone just point me to any soho routers that can do this?
thanks.kah
