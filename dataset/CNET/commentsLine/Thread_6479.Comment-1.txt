hi and i would really appreciate your help on this i have a notebook connected to the internet through wired lan and i want to share this over the wireless lan to another notebook.
both notebooks have xp home sp2.
the host computer has the following: wired lan (has ics setting) ip: 10.0.15.
*** subnet mask: 255.255.254.0 gateway: 10.0.15.254 wireless ssid(***) has been set to ad hoc with automatic ip and dns etc but shows as not connected client setting shows as connected to the ssid(***) with ip: 169.254.240.179 subnet mask: 255.255.0.0 gateway: 169.254.240.179 now i don't know much but i definitely know that i shouldn't have the gateway as same as the clients ip and i'm thinking that the host should show connection... any idea what i need to do?
