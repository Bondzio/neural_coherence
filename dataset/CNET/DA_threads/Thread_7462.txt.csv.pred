1.5.1	Could be hardware (as you suggest), a driver, malware or a corrupted OS.	St
1.5.2	To solve it, I would start with a clean install of Windows (back to factory conditions, be sure you have a BACKUP of EVERYTHING you don't want to lose).	St
1.5.3	If the problem persists, it's a hardware issue.	St
1.5.4	Otherwise it's solved.	St

1.6.1	I think first you need to check internet cable connected to your pc to modem.	St
