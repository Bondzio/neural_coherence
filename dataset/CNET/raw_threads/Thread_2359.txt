Will this ram TW3X4G1333C9DHX 2X2GB 1333Mhz work along with my old (TWIN3X2048-1333C9 2X1gb)RAM. So that i ll be having a total of 6Gb of ram. Q2. Wat OS would u recommend if i upgrade to a total of 6gb RAM. My main purpose is for maya and other 3d software's. Will the 64bit have driver and other support for the softwares iam going to use.

I like the vista interface and everything, but the background software that runs in vista is very annoying. I also want to know weather the ram iam going to buy now will match and work along with my old ram. cause i heard about some latency and other stuff should also match.
