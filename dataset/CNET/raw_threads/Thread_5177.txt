They use a 2Wire Home Portal gateway router which they charge $149.00 for, then give you $100.00 off, so basically theyll chargeme $49. However, they do charge big-time for the computer network adapters. They sell Linksys PCI network adapter cards for about $50. I know I can find my own way cheaper. We have two desktops in the house that will be using the router. Mine will be hard-wired using a PCI card and my brother's upstairs will have to use a wireless PCI card. Question 1.) To match up with their 2Wire device do we HAVE to use Linksys PCI devices? Intel, TRENDnet, D-Link, Intel and MSI all make PCI network adapter cards also. I was leaning towards perhhaps a D-Link or Intel, but they use Bus = &quot;32-bit PCI 2.2&quot; or &quot;32-bit 2.3&quot; I don't think my computer has PCI 2.2. My Everest utility lists (2) PCI, (1) PCI-E x 1 and (1) PCI-E x 16. It does not list a &quot;PCI 2.2&quot; I tried reading about PCI and it's designations, but other than &quot;Express&quot; (a wholeother animal) I'm not cclear about PCI differencs. However, I don't want cards that won't fit, not fit, but won't operate. Question 2.) Should I just go with the more expensive Linksys? It's just plain &quot;32-bit PCI&quot;? I want them to be compatible with the phone company's device. Question 3.) What cable do I need to purchase for my hard-wired connection? Is any one better than another? NOTE: Both desktops are about 2 years old. Both AMD Athlon 64 2.0 GHz & 2.2GHz. Both have PCI dial-up modems that we will replace with network cards. I just want to get the correct ones so we're ready as soon as the 2Wire router box is in the house

It's rare to find a 2 year old system without. Maybe if you could supply some make and model numbers for those computers we can look for you.

Windows XP Media Center SP-2 Network card removed and replaced with pCI dial-up modem. That &quot;upstairs&quot; computer needs a &quot;wireless&quot; PCI network adapter card. 1.) ABS Awesome AMD Athlon 64 2.0 GB 3200 Windows XP Media Center SP-2. Never had a network card...just a PCI dial-up modem.

Since network adapters are an industry standard, use the one you wish. I'm partial to D-link. Of the two mentioned above, only the wireless will need to have it's software installed.
