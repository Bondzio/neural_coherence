I can only support a graphics card which fits in a pci slot because my computer is a bit older and it is hard to tell the difference between the bad and the good and the best. so what is the best for a pci slot? preferably under 150$. PLEASE HELP BECAUSE I NEED IT SOON!

Supposedly costs about $130, but there's probably limited availability, if you can find one at all, so prices might be a bit steeper. Look at CC and BB, Newegg's supposed to carry, but isn't available yet.
