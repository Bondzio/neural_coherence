<s> Last month my six-year-old sons hand-me-down PC started beeping continuously when powered on and then shut itself down in about 5 seconds. </s>
<s> We did the following troubleshooting: Checked all connections and found them to be tight and sound. </s>
<s> Took off-line, one at a time, the CD-ROM, floppy, and hard drives. </s>
<s> Replaced with known working versions the power supply, sound and video cards, and RAM. </s>
<s> We had the same problem after each step. </s>
<s> Over the course of the next two weeks I tried booting up several times, but each time the immediate shutdown occurred. </s>
<s> We unplugged the PC from the power source for about ten days. </s>
<s> I was then able to boot up with no problem and it ran happily for about 3 or 4 hours. </s>
<s> When I rebooted, it began to power up but again shut down in 5 seconds. </s>
<s> (I was not able to replicate this behavior by leaving it unplugged overnight.) </s>
<s> No hardware or software changes had been made, nor were there any apparent symptoms prior to the problem. </s>
<s> Since we live in south Florida, we have frequent power outages and brownouts. </s>
<s> The climate and our three cats make overheating a constant menace, but we saw no visible evidence of any. </s>
<s> The heatsink looks fine; its fan works, as does the CPU cooler and the case fan. </s>
<s> Although it was custom-built, this is now a spare PC and I dont want to invest any more than necessary to keep it running. </s>
<s> Our son uses it for games and educational software. </s>
<s> There is no internet connection, not even a modem installed, and it is virus-free. </s>
<s> The process of elimination would seem to indicate motherboard and/or chipset, but I wanted some input before buying something we may not need. </s>
<s> I may be overlooking something obvious. </s>
<s> If we do need, I would appreciate any suggestions for a low-cost replacement for this system configuration. </s>
<s> The PC is running Windows 98SE. </s>

<s> Do a close visual inspection of the motherboard. </s>
<s> Check for leaking or bulging capacitors. </s>
<s> They're the small clyndrical shaped things on the motherboard. </s>
<s> Look at the tops, they should be flat, not rounded or domed. </s>
<s> If you find this, then replacement of the board is in order. </s>
<s> Try running the machine with the side panel off and a small house fan blowing directly on the motherboard. </s>
<s> If it shows improvement, then it's heat related. </s>
<s> What configuration of memory chips? </s>
<s> One stick of 256, 2 sticks of 128, etc.? </s>
<s> Memory chips can fail. </s>
<s> If you have more than one, try booting with just one stick installed, then replace with another. </s>
<s> Best of Luck </s>
<s> If that doesn't work than it's your motherboard. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
