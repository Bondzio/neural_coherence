<s> I have a Vaio vgc_ra842g desktop. </s>
<s> When I unplug my pc it resets the clock to 2003. </s>
<s> I'm running Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit and have 4 GB of ram. </s>
<s> I have replaced the CMOS battery twice with new ones thinking this is the problem. </s>
<s> Does anyone know what else could be my problem? </s>
<s> There is that CRACK PIRATE VERSION of Ultimate 7 that we encounter at the shops and this is how it stops activation (by changing the clock.) </s>
<s> Some folk bristle about this but we can't fix or help if that version is involved. </s>
<s> One owner was jumping mad and threatened to sue because we put it on the machine. </s>
<s> Since we only had the machine for 10 minutes we thought they should take the machine home and sue away. </s>
