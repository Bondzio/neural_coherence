I had no problems with the WD drive until this morning.
It is connected to the computer via a USB2 cable.
I turned on the computer.
As the booting was taking place the WD drive powered up but then produced three clicking sounds then a pause then another set of three clicking sounds.
Then the power stayed on but it was not attached as a drive (i.e.
it does not appear as a drive and I have no access to the data stored on it).
Has anyone run into this problem (and what was the solution then)?
Thanks
