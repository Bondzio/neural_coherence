if you would like to know more about satellite and pc satellite tv, you can go to fta which is a free to air satellite website, read the forums there.
you can install a pci tv satellite card and receive satellite tv on your computer monitor.
the reception is extremely clean as it's digital and your monitor will make the picture better than a tv but not as good as hdtv.
you can find any additional help on the forums there and no question goes unanswered and is generally answered in a matter of hours, seldom more than a day or two.
