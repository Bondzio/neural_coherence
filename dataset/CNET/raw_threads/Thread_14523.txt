Somebody mentioned that it was cheaper to buy a used internal hard drive, adapt an external enclosure, and use it as an external hard drive. Taking that into consideration, I would only assume that IDE drives are going for a lot cheaper than SATA drives due to age, speed, and technology right?. Just how big is the difference between IDE, SATA, 7200 rpm, 5400 rpm, for backup purposes only.

But it's less safe as a backup, because: - you can't store it at another location (to protect against fire, and theft of the PC) - it's much too easy to delete or files from it by accident - there is a risk that viruses or power outage or peaks damage or erase the internal hard disk - it can be infected with malware easier So maybe you want an internal hard disk for a fast backup, done regularly (a few times a week an incremental backup = only new and changed files) and an external one to use less often. Your backup strategy is totally your choice. Kees

While it's still connected to the PC via the USB port, it's usually the way to go. The only other option is use of SATA-e provided you have or install a SATA-e port on your PC. You then need an ext. HD case that offers SATA-e as well. This is faster than plain USB, but generally isn't widely accepted. Your last option if you care to be more open to it, is an ext. adapter setup. These accept various connections and even devices that require those ports. google ADA-2020 or similar adapters that use USB ports. Thus, you get your hands on whatever HD is available. tada -----Willy
