cpu.
there is some nugget that posts about gpu processing but for photoshop, for the rest of us it's the cpu.
after all this, i ordered a quad core unit just minutes ago.
but back to you.
to let photoshop stretch its legs, go 4gb and 64 bit.
200 may be about right, but where are you shopping?
for example this 8gb monster at  while it's on vista seems to be a deal i would have considered.
we still have 2 more windows 7 updrades left.
