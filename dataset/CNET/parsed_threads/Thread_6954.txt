<s> I am on a Thinkpad running Windows 2000 and over the past several months, I've had a problem with randomly stopping receiving packets. </s>
<s> It happens both through the wireless and cabled connections, and there is no specific activity that causes this to occur. </s>
<s> The problem corrects itself and the machine starts receiving packets again after a period of time if I just let it sit. </s>
<s> I can correct the problem manually by disconnecting and reconnecting the network connection. </s>
<s> The problem usually happens after I've been using the connection for 5-10 minutes. </s>
<s> I can still send packets, and the connection seems to be perfectly fine - I just can't receive anything. </s>
<s> Does this sound familiar to anyone? </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> At this point, I have scanned for viruses and spyware and installed the latest crappy Microsoft updates but neither fixed the problem. </s>
<s> I would really appreciate any help... </s>
<s> Try http://www.ewido.net/en/onlinescan/ I'd note router and such firmware updates but your post told so little. </s>

<s> Bob - I downloaded and ran the complete system scan from the link you provided. </s>
<s> The problem persists. </s>
<s> Another symptom: when I connect to a VPN, the problem automatically occurs. </s>
<s> As soon as I disconnect from the VPN, I am able to receive packets again. </s>
<s> It's a cable connection and I'm using an RCA DCM425 cable modem. </s>
<s> The wireless router is a Netgear MR814, but as I mentioned before, this happens both on wireless and when I'm physically connected. </s>
<s> Please let me know if there is any additional information that would be helpful. </s>
<s> I really appreciate it. </s>
<s> I can't tell. </s>
<s> The router firmware version is noted as Version 5.4_06. </s>
<s> Got that? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It is not fine without the router. </s>
<s> If I plug directly into the cable modem it has the same problem. </s>
<s> Could it be some kind of DNS problem? </s>
<s> I know I'm not very knowledgable about these things so I apologize if that is a silly question, but when the connection craps out, it seems like it sees the site (if I'm in a browser) but can't manage to resolve it. </s>
<s> It's like it gets tired of doing stuff for me so it takes a break and then it's fine again. </s>
<s> Hint: google.com and my email link in my profile. </s>
<s> I'll give it the onceover for DNS hijacks. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I am having the same problem - did you get a solution? </s>
<s> The VPN. </s>
<s> Tell me about your VPN connection. </s>
<s> If you don't have a VPN then it's not the same problem. </s>
<s> I've been telecommuting for several years and all of a sudden I'm having this unstable VPN connection. </s>
<s> The IT department at work and my ISP (Time Warner) both say nothing has changed on their end. </s>
<s> It's a work issue and they need to get to the bottom of this. </s>
<s> Have them bring another laptop to your home and test with that. </s>
<s> I have added instructions on my Blog on how to fix this. </s>
