1.1.1	I recently upgraded my pc and installed a sata 300 in it .	St
1.1.2	I had a couple of sata 150 in it before .	St
1.1.3	The motherboard has 2 connectors for sata on it .	St
1.1.4	My question is if I hook up one of the sata 150 drives to the other connector on the Mboard will it cause my sata 300 to downgrade in speed or is each connector is independent ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks , Sparky	St
1.2.1	Each connector is independent .	St
