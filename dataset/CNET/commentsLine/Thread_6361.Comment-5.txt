for a long time the trend has been that prices fall and performance increases but prices are falling more slowly now.
basically, for the same relative cost today you get more.
but, i would not want to predict the future nor would i buy anything today to put away for later.
i'd not try to find an &quot;upgradable&quot; pc unless the i planned to upgrade real soon as technology comes and goes too fast to know how long something will be useful.
buy what you need today to do what you need to do today and not what you think your needs will be tomorrow.
just my opinion only.
