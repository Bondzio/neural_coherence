1.1.1	I recently upgraded the motherboard and processor to my rapidly aging eMachines desktop .	St
1.1.2	The hardware store I normally buy from was running a deal .	St
1.1.3	Now I have a Chaintech MPM800-3 with a 2.80 GHz Celeron processor running with my factory standard hard drive , CD-RW and power supply .	St
1.1.4	Things have been running extremely well , except for a recent occurance of random freezes and shut downs .	St
1.1.5	Sometimes whatever I 'm doing will hang for a second and then the screen will go black and come back up normal in 1-2 seconds .	St
1.1.6	Other times everything will lock up requiring a forced reboot .	St
1.1.7	Still other times the computer will simply shut down , no error message , nothing .	St
1.1.8	I was thinking that it could be my dinky 250 Watt power supply or possibly a heat issue .	St
1.1.9	If anyone has any suggestions I would be very grateful .	Ques
1.2.1	Although power supply is important and,250 is not enough my first quetion would be what did you upgrade from ?	Ques
1.2.2	Give us those specs .	St
1.2.3	You did not mention new heatsink or cpu fan .	St
1.2.4	What memory are you running ?	Ques
1.2.5	Was this upgraded for your new motherboard ?	Ques
1.2.6	ect .	St
1.3.1	It maybe due to the system RAM , Try replacing RAM .	St
1.4.1	The old system specs were an Intel 810e chipset with a 1.4 GHz Celeron processor .	St
1.4.2	I installed a new heatsink ( it already had the thermal glue on the bottom so I could n't have screwed that up ) and CPU fan which is running properly and was rated high enough for the 2.8 GHz processor .	St
1.4.3	I now have 256 MB PC2700 DDR SDRAM in one slot with another of the same on the way .	St
1.4.4	The RAM is brand new from Office Depot , so it better not be faulty .	St
1.4.5	I was told I could install any 266/333/400 DDR memory and at bootup it says mine is at 333 .	St
1.4.6	The graphics card is the same one I had before , an nVidia 5200 128 MB PCI card .	St
1.4.7	The fan seems to be working on that one still .	St
1.4.8	I really appreciate all the help , this problem is starting to get pretty annoying .	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	Hi , Could you try booting up and using the sytem with less stuff ?	Ques
1.6.2	e.g .	St
1.6.3	remove the VGA card , use the on-board one , and use less / one pcs or even old RAM .	St
1.6.4	If it works fine , than re-install RAM , Cards one by one to see the difference .	St
1.6.5	You may also adjust the CL value in the bios to a bigger value ( e.g .	St
1.6.6	CL3 or 4 ) I have similar problem for my PCs / notebooks at home and work .	St
1.6.7	RAM is usually the source of problem .	St
