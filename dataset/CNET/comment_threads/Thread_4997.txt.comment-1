My neighbor has wireless internet.
I discovered this when I brought a laptop home from work and it picked it up right away.
I can get onto the internet with no problem at all.
Now, of course I had to return the laptop but I have a Dell desktop at home.
It is not currently equipped to receive wireless.
First off, is it morally/legally wrong to use his wireless connection?
And further, what would I need to receive the wireless connection on my desktop?
The desktop is a brand new Dell with McAfee firewall and virus protection, which I use for my super slow dial up connection.
I certainly do not have the resources to pay $50 a month for a wireless connection myself so if this doesn't work out, I'm keeping my dial-up.
