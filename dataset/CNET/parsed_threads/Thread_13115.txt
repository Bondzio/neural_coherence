<s> Hi, I am experiencing problems with my home network. </s>
<s> I recently installed (after formating HDD) on one of my computers (comp C) Windowx XP Media Center (Windows XP Home Edition was previous operating system). </s>
<s> Other two computer (comp A&B) are running on Widows XP Profesional. </s>
<s> My Problem: I am not able to acess comp C neither from comp A nor com B. </s>
<s> While the comp C is listed in my worgroup computers. </s>
<s> When I click on comp C the error message comes up: \\comp C is not accessible. </s>
<s> You might not have permission to use this network resource. </s>
<s> Contact the administrato of this server to find out if you have access permissions. </s>
<s> The network path was not found. </s>
<s> Please help me to figure this out. </s>
<s> Thanks for your time and all your help. </s>

<s> I had couple of folders to be shared, but I was still not able to access the computer. </s>
<s> You may have set 1 or more folders on Comp C for sharing, but if you have a firewall running on Comp C, and didn't give an exception for Comp A and Comp B to actually access it, they won't. </s>
<s> Also, are you certain that the Workgroup name is the same on all 3 computers? </s>
