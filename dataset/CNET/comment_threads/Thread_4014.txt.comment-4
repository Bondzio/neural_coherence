Try to only enable 802.11g on the router and all computers/labtops.
If you have a mixed network, the network throughput might be dropped to half or more if there are 802.11g and 802.11b wireless clients in the network.
Try to tune the wireless adapter settings on that Compaq computer and see how it works.
Also the wireless bandwidth is shared among wireless clients, the more clients you have the slower the network.
Hope this helps.. :o) picoHat http://www.home-network-help.com
