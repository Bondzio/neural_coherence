After connecting it to my home desktop (Compaq Presario SR2002X) front USB 2.0 port and leaving it on for a while, my computer won't detect it. To check if my computer had a problem, I connect the drive to my work laptop (Dell Precision), it still wasn't detected. I tried everything from changing the BIOS setting on my desktop to disconnecting an extra internal drive I have, but still nothing happens. I am thinking about returning the drive. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks,

I bought a SimpleDrive 250gb USB External Hard Drive, and when I plugged it in, it refused to play with my Dell Dimension 2400. Although Windows XP detected and allegedly installed the SimpleDrive, it was nowhere to be found when I double-clicked My Computer. After spending hours trolling through various online forums (seems that more than a few Dell owners have had troubles with SimpleDrives), I found your post. I followed your instructions and, yes indeed, the SimpleDrive was listed as &quot;Unallocated Space.&quot; I have no earthly clue what &quot;Unallocated Space&quot; is, but I did as you directed -- right-clicked, partitioned, formatted -- and suddenly my SimpleDrive is listed in My Computer. I've transferred a sample file to the SimpleDrive with no problem. We'll see if it continues to play nice as I put it to use. But thanks for saving me a trip to OfficeMax to return it. (I now feel much better about the great price I got -- $69.00)

Installed it - simple, no driver required, but it wasn't pre-formatted, as I'd expected. Formatted (NTFS) with no problem. Started to put a few file folders on and that was quick, all seemed well. Next day I find that the drive has reverted to RAW formatting again. I tried installing again via the accompanying disk, reformatted to NTFS and, after two more days, I put a few more folders on. A day later, I go back to the drive and find that it's reverted to the unformatted state - gone back to the RAW - so I couldn't access it (the file folders were mainly back-ups so I wasn't unduly worried). Hmmm - tried their 'Support' line - no reply (and it's been either no reply or voicemail several times since). Sent an email a week ago via their 'support form' at their website. I get no reply after three emails (and note that the 'Case Number' has risen by around 2000 in a week). I gave in and reformatted today, moved a folder over no problem. Since then I've been getting system error messages, &quot;Windows Delayed Write faied. Windows was unable to save all the data for the file G:\$Mft. Failure of computer hardware.... etc&quot;. I've read elsewhere on this forum about drivers for USB etc, but surely I don't need something else? Any ideas most welcome. WIndows XP, 2Gb RAM 80Gb HD USB2.0 Geoff

However, after I posted here I got an email from SimpleTech who suddenly seem very helpful - I'm fairly sure I lost my data but they'll exchange the drive for me. Can't say fairer than that! I'll report here when I get a new drive and test it out. Thanks for the reply, though!

Pulled it out of the box and connected it to my Dell Inspirion 2200 (1.7 GHz; 504? MB RAM) running XP Home Edition SP2. It won't recognize the drive or even show up in the disk management tools as unrecognized space. Its USB identity does show up and in the system tray it does infer that I can safely remove Hardware. The CD ROM does say that it is preformatted with NTFS but if it isn't formatted how could I tell?

(You find out about formatting via the Properties, if the drive shows up at all). Once I'd reformatted I transferred some files to it and it seemed fine, then a day later the computer didn't recognise it again and I discovered that the formatting had been lost (it was back as 'RAW') so I lost the files too. I eventually got a reply from the Simpletech support via email and have now sent it back for replacement.

Then try ALL USB-ports. Some may work, some may not work. If you find a working one, you're done, more or less. Then try a working USB-port (check with any other USB device, like a mouse or a USB-stick) and connect it the disk through an active hub to that port. Hope this helps. Kees

It did NOT work out of the box, but here is how I got mine to work just fine. SimpleTech told me to go to RadioShack and buy a power supply. It was a 7.5 watt, and cost over $30 I decided that was TOO much. So I went to WalMart and bought one of those powersupply things that you can adjust the voltage on, and has all sorts of plug in tips. WalMart had two types of these, and I bought the cheaper of the two. The drive had NO information on polarity of the power supply pin, but another SimpleTech drive has Center Positive, so I set for that. Also, a standard USB port only gives 5 watts. I thought jumping to 7.5 watts was a BIG change, so I set the thing on 6 watts. SimpleTech sends you that Y-shaped cable. The bottom end connects to the drive, and the other branches into two. When I used the FARTHEST one, the drive Didn't work. When I used the closer one, the drive worked and I have stored a lot of stuff on it. -that was today!

On Windows XP Pro, I initially used Windows USB Troubleshooting. Everything checked out in Device Manager, and the drive was visible under the USB branch. Everything was listed as operating properly. I repeatedly examoined and refreshed my list of drives, but nothing was listed for this external drive. Called Simpletech support, and was routed through several levels of the phone queue, and was offered the support scenario of a drive which is invisible within My Computer. The pre-recorded solution was said to be plugging just the cable into two USB ports on the back of the desktop, and then connecting the drive, which was supposed to appear after twenty or thirty seconds. It didn't. Began internet research, and found that many drives came to life after users noticed Unallocated Space under Device Manager - indicating that the drive had not been ready for use, and needed to be partitioned. Yikes!!! Mine was already full of data, so this would have been a very bad sign. Checked under Device Manager for unallocated space, but noticed a SECOND listing for the Simpletech drive, not under USB devices, but under hard drives. Under the properties Volumes, nothing was listed, so I clicked Populate, and found my drive listed as F-drive. Voila! But no, F-drive was not Simpletech, but a mapped network drive. DRIVE CONFLICT! I unmapped the network drive, and it came to life as Simpletech.

Unfortunately, I was planning on starting to use it both as a backup drive and also as a media drive, so I moved all my music (20gb) from my laptop to the drive, and now, seems like I can't get to them. I have tried it on a dell latitude D420 with XP SP3, and as well on a gateway running vista, having both not recognizing the USB connection. Last time it worked was when tried to do a defrag from the vista laptop, and although I left it on for the whole night and shut it down proerly at the next day, when connected to the XP machine, started giving problems as slow to write to the disc, and after a couple times, it stopped showing of. Any help is highly appreciated.
