1.1.1	I recently upgraded my computer from ASUS Motherboard and Intel 1.8 to a new ASUS MOBO and Intel 2.8. now when i went into the device manager, it has exclamation marks next to: system timer, system speaker, Direct memory access controller, system CMOS/real time clock and numeric data processor.	St
1.1.2	I am running WIN ME, 512 DDR, and 64 bit video card.	St
1.1.3	can anyone tell me what all these exclamation marksmean and how to fix these?	Ques
1.1.4	I have gone into the BIOS but i dont see anything there that looks out of the ordinary.	St
1.1.5	please help.	Sug
1.1.6	if possible, you can email me at zena3546@aol.com.	St
1.1.7	Thank you.	St
1.2.1	Download current drivers.	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	Did this new mobo come with a cd?	St
1.4.2	If so and with a little luck if you place it in your cd reader unit it will auto play and present you with a nice menu to load the mobo drivers.	St
1.4.3	If you can do that then many if not all of those exclamation marks will go away.	St
1.4.4	Be aware that the drivers on the cd may be quite old so a trip to the mobo makers site to check for updates would be a good thing to do.	St
1.5.1	Upgrade to XP or reinstall Windows ME.	St
