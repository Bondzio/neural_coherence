<s> I'm looking for an easy-to-use, moderately price external hard drive (~80GB, USB) to serve as a backup device. </s>
<s> Do experienced users here have any specific recommendations. </s>
<s> I've reviewed the different selections listed here, but find no reviewer ratings and user ratings are all over the place. </s>
<s> Thanks much! </s>
<s> This fails as a backup on 2 points. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> No write protect switch. </s>
<s> Connecting such to an infected system can result in the backup being lost. </s>
<s> Or operator errors! </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> No backup to the backup. </s>
<s> A backup system has multiple copies so that if one fails, you go get the next oldest copy. </s>
<s> This would be one backup device and no copy to fall back on. </s>
<s> If a copy is all you need, then such will be fine. </s>
<s> But you won't see me put my lifetime digital photo collection at rish on such a system! </s>

<s> I define &quot;backup&quot; as a scheme or plan but not as a device. </s>
<s> You develop the plan suitable for your own needs. </s>
<s> You must capture the information that is important or even critical. </s>
<s> You must determine what might threaten it and take precautions against these, etc. </s>
<s> You should also have a recovery plan. </s>
<s> No backup plan is any more important than is the ability to recover what is lost. </s>
<s> Once you've made all these decisions, then you get the appropriate hardware, software, etc. </s>
<s> Then you get to be diligent in using it. </s>
<s> My own scheme involved actual testing of the backup and recovery methods until I tuned them to meet my needs. </s>
<s> I was talking to a user a while back about backups. </s>
<s> He was telling me about some product he uses and how he backups this and that and this and that, sounded good. </s>
<s> So I asked have you ever tried to restore using these backups? </s>
<s> Answer=NO So I asked how do you know the restore works? </s>
<s> Answer=OH it will work. </s>
<s> So I said let's test. </s>
<s> Wipe the HD and restore. </s>
<s> Answer=subject title </s>
<s> Thank you for your insightful response. </s>
<s> It's people like you make life miserable for someone trying to ask simple questions on forums like this. </s>
<s> Thanks for nothing and you might ask yourself the same question you asked me! </s>
<s> You have to meet a few people who lost it all to understand that backup is not optional. </s>
<s> And a test of the backup is not to wait till its needed. </s>
<s> All the respondants want you to never experience the true misery. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Backup s is plural </s>
<s> Geez Randun I didn't mean anything negative. </s>
<s> My post was directed to steve and not you. </s>
<s> I think it's great that your on the backup route. </s>
<s> You can learn from all the mistakes that others have made or do it the hard way and make all the same mistakes on your own. </s>
<s> I was just trying to point out that there are two parts to a backup. </s>
<s> BACKUP RESTORE You can spend hours daily/weekly/monthly doing backups only to find that when you need them the restore function does not work. </s>
<s> It's a heck of a time to find out the backup compressed the data better than was expected. </s>
<s> (bummer) Anyway no slight intended. </s>
<s> Obviously I've either mis-stated my inquiry or users here simply didn't understand. </s>
<s> I've backed up data for years on my PC to tape drives. </s>
<s> I currently use Retrospect 6.5 and a Seagate tape drive. </s>
<s> And yes, I DO have a backup plan and can restore data at will. </s>
<s> Now, that I've made that crystal clear, does anyone want to actually answer my question and recommend an external hard drive that can replace the tape drive. </s>
<s> If you don't have a civil answer, please don't bother responding. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I really have no idea what all those guys are rambling about. </s>
<s> It should not really matter much which enclosure you buy, as long as you make sure the drive within is of high quality. </s>
<s> I suggest choose anything with a Seagate drive in it, as Seagate drives now all come with 5 year warranties. </s>
<s> As for the enclosure itself, these are not really expensive, and if the ENCLOSURE fails (ie not the drive itself within the enclosure) you can always get a new enclosure and through the drive in the old one, into the newer one. </s>
<s> Generally you cant go wrong if you purchase the Vantec NST-250U2 enclosure with a seagate drive inside. </s>
<s> Also you cud consider getting a Dual-Layer DVD drive and backup tyo DVD disk, which is probably a much better bet and will probably cost u much less. </s>
<s> Just make sure you get quality DVD disk like Verbatim, TDK, or Maxell. </s>
<s> good DVD burners include NEC-3500a (the best) Sony D22A, Samsung H-552B </s>
<s> I'd used about every one and they all &quot;work&quot;. </s>
<s> Which model is available today? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Until reading your explanation which qualified your knowledge and previous experience, it's a bit hard to know where to start and stop. </s>
<s> No one here (I hope) wants to insult a knowledgable person nor do they want to overwhelm a real &quot;newbie&quot; with technical garble that only serves to prove their own expertise without really offering help. </s>
<s> So, a reply to a what seems like a straight forward question can be difficult to tailor to specific needs. </s>
<s> What I would advise is that you hope for lots of responses regardless of whether they are on target and pick the ones that suit you best. </s>
<s> Don't get too flustered. </s>
<s> This is a great place to pick some pretty good brains but a bad place to always get succinct answers. </s>
<s> As for HD enclosures, I would go one of two ways and the rest is up to you. </s>
<s> You can purchase external drives already in an enclosure or you can buy the enclosure and drive separately. </s>
<s> The latter is what I do. </s>
<s> I think the major HD manufactures that you already trust are the best source for drive/enclosure packages. </s>
<s> I put Seagates in my enclosures and feel comfortable saying they are a long time and reliable company. </s>
<s> Mine run quiet and cool and Seagate offers what you need. </s>
<s> If I was buying one as a gift or personal use, I would not hesitate to buy a Seagate with USB2. </s>
<s> Please don't let this experience get you down. </s>
<s> :) </s>
<s> I had a 40Gb Maxtor external, it went, and I can't use any of my spare HDs with the USB case, I have 2 120 Gb Maxtor externals, both holding the same data, normally diconnected ( I only connect to a PC, for read/write, which has been completely scanned ), a 120GB internal ( which is external most of the time ) holding much of the same data, and the same data is scattered around a few more internal HDs. </s>
<s> I haven't lost any data but it's not easy to find what I'm looking for when I want to check on it. </s>
<s> System, it's not. </s>
<s> Data bank, OK. </s>
<s> I probably have 10 copies of some files (over-over-overkill) but I wouldn't even mention the possibility of cleaning the system up, unless somebody knows of a utility which can sort it all out. </s>
<s> HAH!!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> The number one reason is... No write protection. </s>
<s> While you mention it's unplugged most of the time, without a write protect feature a missed virus or even operator error can wipe the backup out. </s>
<s> As such, this is not a valid &quot;backup&quot;, but just a copy. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
