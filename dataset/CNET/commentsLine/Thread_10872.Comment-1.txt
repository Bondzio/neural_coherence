i have an older pc which i still want my family to use and i bought a new pc with an lcd monitor that i want to use for professional work but i have no space to put my older pc so i want to know if there is a way that i can connect both my pc to the same monitor so i can switch from work pc to my home pc.
is there a vga cable that i could buy so i can connect them.
by the way my monitor only has 1 vga input.
thanks if you help.
