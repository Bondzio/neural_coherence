<s> I recently upgraded my computer with new components. </s>
<s> I have been having problems clocking my G.Skill 1866 RAM to factory settings. </s>
<s> The highest I can get it to go is in the 1700's area. </s>
<s> I don't know if it is a problem with my RAM or my motherboard. </s>
<s> Purchased from Newegg, this is what I got: Asus M5A97 R2.0 Motherboard. </s>
<s> Newegg lists it as having 1866 RAM capability with RAM overclocking in the 2000s area. </s>
<s> Running latest UEFI BIOS release. </s>
<s> AMD Phenom II x4 965 black edition CPU 16Gb(4x 4Gb sticks) of G.Skill Sniper Series 1866 RAM Sapphire Radeon HD 7870 2Gb GHZ Edition OC The BIOS does not have an option for 1866 RAM speed by default. </s>
<s> When I try to manually set the RAM to 1866 speed, my computer will not start up and I have to hit the &quot;RAM OK&quot; button on the motherboard to reset it. </s>
<s> Maybe I'm just doing something wrong. </s>
<s> I've never had lemons from Newegg before so if someone could provide an in-depth guide to set my RAM to its factory clock or let me know if I need to get a different motherboard model then that would be great. </s>
