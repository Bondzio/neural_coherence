ok - I ended up resetting the modem back to factory settings which put back the SSID and password.
that allowed it to work again.
I then changed just the password and the printer was still able to reconnect.
So - I am not sure if it did not like the SSID I was trying to use or if something else happened but I can live with the weird SSID but a password that works for me.
Thanks everyone.
