if your computer has been reliable and you are not using it for anything but internet and picture storage, all you need is a bigger hard drive.
keep in mind eventually your system may not be able to run future programs due to speed and other limitations.
check hard drive prices and compare what it would cost to get a new computer with the hard drive size you want.
prices on low end machines are pretty cheap.
i personally am a mac user and will never go back to windows!
