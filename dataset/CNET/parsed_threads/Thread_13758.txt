<s> i just upgraded my RAM.. i just noticed that i bought 512mb 266mhz.. i currently have 512 330mhz and my mobo supports up to 330mhz.. when i install the RAM and start the PC it tells me the 1gig of ram is running at 266mhz.. does this mean that the new ram i installed has slowed down my current RAM to 266.. or do they run independently at their own speed... also is is possible to overclock the RAM that i bought?.. </s>
<s> Thanks in Advance, Danny </s>
<s> Run the memory system at the stick with the lowest speed. </s>
<s> That's proper. </s>

<s> ok.. so ur saying now all my ram is running at 266mhz . </s>
<s> so did i upgrade or downgrade lol :P </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> if i run it at 330mhz will that overclock the 266mhz RAM or will it just stop working... is it safe to overclock 266 ram to 330? </s>
<s> wat is the worst that can happen? </s>
<s> Pentium 4 - 2.4 Ghz 1000 MB RAM 128MB Geforce 4 Windows Vista </s>
<s> i can see that my CPU clock is only 133mhz.. so im guessing that changing my systems ram from 330mhz to 266mhz wont really make a difference.. then again i could be wrong ? </s>
<s> Since RAM is used to cache hard disk reads and writes the worst things are crashes and next are corrupted data being written to the hard disk (hello format.) </s>
<s> But that's par for overclockers and they get used to it. </s>
<s> As to any speed hit you should run a benchmark (pick one?) </s>
<s> and see the effect before and after. </s>

<s> nice, i really appreciate your help.. all the best </s>

<s> When you have RAM chipsets that are operating at different clock speeds, the computer most times will default to the lowest chipset speed. </s>
<s> Sometimes, though, the computer will even drop RAM clock speed to half of the chipset speeds, i.e. </s>
<s> a 350mhz and 266mhz will default to 133mhz. </s>
<s> It is best NOT to mix clock speeds. </s>
<s> The only thing that happens is your computer will load slow, run slow, and frustrate the ever-loving beegeebers out of you. </s>
<s> It has happened to two friends. </s>
<s> When you have memory with different speeds the computer will automaticaly run the memory at the lower speed. </s>
<s> It is likely that you will still get a performance improvement becuase the improvement you gain from the extra memory is likely more significant than the performance difference you will experience based on the memory speed. </s>
<s> The best option of courase would be to use memory of equal speed. </s>
<s> It is not a good idea to tweek your system to try to run memory above its rated speed. </s>
<s> this can cause instability. </s>
