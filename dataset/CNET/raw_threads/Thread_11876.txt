I was looking the specs for each and they are both the same. Is there a difference between the 2 besides the part numbers?

Warranty on OEM products is from the retailer/seller and is usually whatever the retailer/seller provides ...30 days, 60 days, 90 days etc.,. On the otherhand, retail boxed CPUs whether Intel or AMD, usually have 3 year warranties from the manufacturer. My recommendation, get a retail boxed CPU which gives you the HS fan and the longer 'manufacturer-backed' warranty. VAPCMD
