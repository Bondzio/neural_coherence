1.1.1	When I try to play music on my laptop , it 's very slow to load/ play .	St
1.1.2	The hd space within my laptop is pretty much full now , so I 'm thinking that 's my problem .	St
1.1.3	If I were to get myself an external hd with tons more space , loaded my music & music playback software on *that*- it should all run normally , right ?	Ques
1.1.4	I just wan na be sure 1st before I plunk down $ $ $ .	St
1.2.1	It all depends on what is taking the space on the primary hard drive .	St
1.2.2	If music files are the culprit then that should solve the problem , but when an internal hd gets to that situation we often find that other steps are needed , for example , reducing system files like System Restore backup files , ( if Windows ) , uninstalling un-needed software , etc .	St
1.2.3	So really it is difficult to say whether what you suggest will work or not .	St
1.2.4	One thing though , where are your backups ?	Ques
1.2.5	Mark	St
1.3.1	I suspect it 's the music files only because I did notice a gradual slow down with the more music added .	St
1.4.1	I 've backed up the music on dvds	St
1.5.1	And good to see .	St
1.5.2	Slow playback of music tracks does n't necessarily relate to a full hard drive , so I wonder if there is anything else amiss .	St
1.5.3	Mark	St
1.6.1	It could very well be the other things you mentioned .	St
1.6.2	I 'll have a look .	St
1.6.3	Thanks !	St
