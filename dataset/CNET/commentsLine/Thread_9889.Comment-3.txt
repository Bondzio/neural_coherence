is the distortion from like the sound being clipped or soemthing else.
if it's being clipped depending on what sound software came with your card maybe look at the eq settings.
high bass and high volume will make the speakers begin to clip and distort.
if you can turn the volume down and it cleans up amplify the sound anther way.
