Did you click the GREEN &quot;Create New Discussion&quot; button instead of the YELLOW &quot;Reply to This Message&quot; button when you initiated this discussion?
Now, I am curious as to which forum post stimulated your initial posting.
While I don't doubt that you had good intentions with the original post in this discusstion, it reads like you are trying to regurgitate a condensed version of the first chapter in a Computers 101 textbook.
(I have read and used many of them in classroom settings.)
BTW, I agree with Coryphaeus on the holes in your statements about electrical circuits.
