<s> There's a few ways to set-up multi-boot systems. </s>
<s> All of them will require some sort of way to select which operating system to boot. </s>
<s> With a single HD, you'll need to partition it into at least a seperate Server 2003 and a Windows XP partitions. </s>
<s> I've used Acronis multiboot manager, is ok. </s>
<s> It comes with the disk director suite, which will handle partitioning, too. </s>
<s> I haven't done Server 2003, but in principle there's no reason it can't be the same re multibooting as any other OS. </s>
<s> I am going to give acronis a try i have heard that it helps in multiboot systems. </s>
<s> Here is what i did I installed server 2003 32 bit first then installed xp x64 then vista x64. </s>
