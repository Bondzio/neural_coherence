I think this is because the CPU is overheating. Can I correct this by changing the heatsink ? Now it looks the heatsink is properly attached. Thanks in advance! Mike Myatt

If it conforms what you suspect, then you can take a look at the heat sink and fan assembly for the CPU. It could be something else but at least you will have an idea where to look.

The onlyh real way to tell is remove the HS fan, clean the surfaces, reapply thermal grease and reinstall the HS fan. I recommend downloading/installing 'Sensorsview' to give you CPU and HDD temps. Let us know what you find. VAPCMD
