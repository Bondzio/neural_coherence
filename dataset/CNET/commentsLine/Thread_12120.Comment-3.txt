a dell photo all-in-one printer 964. it can print on thick paper, photo paper, etc.
i usually get my photos printed at a place like walmart, cheaper.
ink i purchase is around $23 a cartridge and i use the cheap ones.
my printer is no longer made.
make a trip to office max or staples and check out the printers and the prices of ink for them.
a nice sales person should be willing to help you.
