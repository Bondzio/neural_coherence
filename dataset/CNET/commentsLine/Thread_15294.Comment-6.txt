ask verizon if you are in their 4g coverage area.
they are going live today dec 5 with their lte system.
i have used this when they were testing and it is very fast we were streaming (ie transmitting) hidef video from a moving car.
work very well considering that you cannot buffer outgoing live video.
have not had time to read the fine print on their contract but they implied they were going to offer a tiered plan so you could by what you need.
sprint/clear if you can get it offers a true unlimited 4g plan but in theory lte will be faster but we will see who is telling the truth.
