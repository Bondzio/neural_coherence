its a brand new motherboard, i have never touched any of the components on ir and i always wear an anti static wrist band.
the sata-ide convertors are broken because they are cheap ones from hong kong, and even the ones that do &quot;work&quot; dont actually convert sata-ide, so i simply removed them all.
