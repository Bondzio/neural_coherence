you could go on for days trying to figure out which inkjet printer might be the cheapest to use on a per page basis.
what i have seen is that none of them are cheap to use from a page volume standpoint.
if you are talking about large printing volumes you may want to look into laser printers, again it totally depends on what you are doing, quantities of color print as opposed to b/w.
so far i have yet to see a really economical inkjet printer, claims some manufacturers make are one thing, reality is another.
there are so many variables in the way printers are used (especially home users) it is nearly impossible to do an accurate per page costing/ink usage calculation.
