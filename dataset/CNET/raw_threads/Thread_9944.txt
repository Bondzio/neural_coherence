I have a pc and a laptop both running windows xp pro. I recently purchased a netgear WGR614 wireless router. It set up easily enough, with all appropriate connections running fine. I can access the internet either through a cable or wirelessly no problem. i can also share files from my main pc to any attached device. What i cannot seem to do is access my pc's files from another machine, either wirelessly or with cable connected to the router. I can ping all machines from all others with no loss or problems. I am running zonealarm but seem to have the network set up ok (problem persists with zonealarm disabled and also uninstalled), and have disabled windows firewall. To be honest ive run through so many different options that it might be that i now throw myself open to your help. Many thanks
