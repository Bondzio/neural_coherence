When I went to turn it back on, and in every attempt there after, I get power for all of 1 second. The fans fire up, disk drives light, and thats it. I replaced the power supply not too long ago but it has been working fine for about 3 months. The mother board is getting power, when switched &quot;off.&quot; So im guessing it is not that. Any help would be appreciated. XP P4 200mHz 512 self built power supply is 550W did not smell any burn up.

CPU plus HSF (HeatSink/Fan). 3. Power Supply. 4. Speaker. No case, no RAM, no extra cables. Just those four pieces on a square of non-conductive cardboard. I use a jumper to power it up and hope to beeps. Power down. If I get beeps I can add a minimum amount of RAM and try again... More beeps is good. Power down. A video card and hopefully more beeps and a display output. I then move that back to the case and check that no metal standoffs are where they shouldn't be. If you can't get beeps with the 4 items above, then you have narrowed it down to those 4 items are either dead or grossly misconfigured. Happy hunting, Bob

With no smell of burning, but with the recent replacement of a burnt up power supply, which should i suspect. the motherboard is an asus p4b533, and the cpu is pentium 4 2.0, not overclocked
