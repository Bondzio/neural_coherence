My wife has a laptop with built-in wireless capability. Right now it is wired (ethernet cable) to a cable modem for internet access. She'd like to be able to use it anywhere in the house, without being restricted to using it where the cable modem is; nothing fancy, just basic internet access. All the wireless routers seem to require that one PC/laptop be wired to the router, and then other computers can connect wirelessly, but we only have the one laptop at home. Is it possible to set up a system with just one computer connecting wirelessly? Bonus points: can it also be set up so she can print from anywhere in the house? Any advice, suggestions, specific equipment recommendations, etc., would be greatly appreciated. Ease of installation/use is obviously important. Thanks for your help.

Once its setup, you don't need the wired connection. As to printing. Some routers have printer support, some don't. And with one laptop, why not put the printer where it's used most? Bob

Just get one whose printer connection is compatible (USB or parallel). As Bob said, it would be convenient to have the printer located where it would the laptop is used most. This may or may not be where the router is located (if you have cable internet service the router and modem will be located near a cable outlet, but you may want the printer somewhere else). If the printer is to be near the router, use a wired print server; if the printer is remote, use a wireless print server. With respect to the requisite wired connection; first connect yoour laptop to the router by wire. Download the latest firmware for the router, and go through the setup procedure. Then you should be able to unwire the laptop and use it anywhere in the house. Whenever you wish to change settings or download newer firmware or drivers, simply connect again by wire. Frank
