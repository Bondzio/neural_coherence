as for the digital editing, the program i got is called power director 9... it had very good reviews and the demo was easy to use.
i am pretty good with user-friendly software, just not tech specs.
to be honest, most of this editing will just be photos and not actual video... i would be creating dvd slideshows set to music with some graphical overlays and/or transitions, but i don't plan on much beyond that.
what kind of processor does that put me in?
2ghz+ makes sense, but what i struggle with is intel vs. athlon vs....?
i just don't know.
i was thinking probably 1tb of memory, so that sounds good.
other specs though?
are there any particular brands i should or shouldn't check out?
i know this is subjective, but i have no frame of reference and need input.
thanks so much for the response!
