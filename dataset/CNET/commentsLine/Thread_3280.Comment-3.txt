well, i have been using an ancient, huge, viewsonic crt, which i have always liked, but which is beginning to show it's age.
i like big, and i want good...trouble is, i haven't shopped in so long, i have lost the &quot;thread&quot; on what to look for.
i would say 80% of my useage is managing images, and text documents, some photoshop work, and the rest in online games like wow, swtor, and second life.
i want to see it, and i am not getting any younger .
i can afford $500 to $700.
does any of that help?
thanks, jp
