in sd you have the option to make the clone bootable.
if yours were unchecked, chances are that sd did not make it bootable.
i would first repeat the cloning making sure that this option is enabled.
if it fails, then return the drive.
i would suggest you get an owc one.
they have a very good reputation and are portable to boot (no pun intended).
