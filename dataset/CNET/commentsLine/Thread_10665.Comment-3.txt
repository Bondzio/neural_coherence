just the response i needed.
thanks!
yes, i am aware of 64-bit windows and it's ability to address more memory, but i really don't consider that a very useful windows as most of the programs i run, like you said, would not run on 64-bit.
so when i said &quot;windows&quot; i had in mind &quot;32-bit windows&quot; and should've specified.
and i definitely agree with you on how big numbers sell, and i was actually considering putting that in my original question.
hard drive space, cpu speed, etc.
big numbers do sell.
i just wanted to know if there was any practical use of the four gigs of ram, other than linux or attempting to use 64-bit windows, like if it somehow improved 32-bit windows experience.
is there any future possibility of a 32-bit system compatible with more ram, or 64-bit systems actually becoming useful?
