<s> For some reason, I cannot print envelopes. </s>
<s> I am using a HP Pavilion 734N desktop and a Lexmark X75 all-in-one. </s>
<s> My OS is Win XP. </s>
<s> On my old computer I was able to - using this same printer. </s>
<s> I can print web pages and documents but not envelopes. </s>
<s> Can you help me? </s>
<s> I can't help yet. </s>
<s> You'll need to write more detail about your issue. </s>
<s> For example, what happens when you try to print an envelope, error messages or is it some feeding problem with the printer. </s>
<s> In short, your post is too light on details. </s>

<s> I hear sounds like it is printing, but the envelope feeds out blank. </s>
<s> http://www.hyperdictionary.com/dictionary/elucidate No mention if you selected the envelope paper size in the printer dialog or what direction/side the printer you fed the envelope. </s>
<s> I was hoping for a gritty blow by blow detail of how you tried to print on the envelope. </s>
<s> Here's a test I do when I wonder where/how/orientation to feed the envelope. </s>
<s> I print, but instead I use a full size sheet. </s>
<s> That way I can discern where to place the envelope. </s>
<s> In closing, your post is much too short on words. </s>
<s> Make/model of what printers, the OS, the applications and more would help the forum see what the problem could be. </s>
<s> The following Tip is presented with every post. </s>
<s> I'll copy here in case you missed it. </s>
<s> &quot;Tip: If you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.&quot; Bob </s>
