fan connector to the mobo, that voltage is provided by a separate chip [or two] on the mobo.
the voltages are modulated by a variable on/off cycle, thus the voltage readings cannot readily be accurately read by a digital voltmeter [nor a d'arsonval movement.
got an oscilloscope???
the chip probably got zapped.
get an adapter and run them at 12 volts from a ps molex.
