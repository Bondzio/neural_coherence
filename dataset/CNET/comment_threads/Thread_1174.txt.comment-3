Look at these from http://www.bgmicro.com They're two listed in 12v/3a range.
As for proper usage, you do need the right voltage period, the amps can be higher, but lets not get crazy.
I did mention those, they seem to fit what you need and are new and cheap but verify the connection barrel type.
part# PWR1207 and PWR1206 good luck -----Willy
