I get it now, I wasn't thinking!
80-wire, like the hard drive cables, duh!
I didn't realize that's what you were talking about - I didn't use an 80-wire cable for the cd drive, I never even considered it.
I do think I was having conflicts in the OS, but now that I've wiped the hard drives and re-installed, everything is great.
