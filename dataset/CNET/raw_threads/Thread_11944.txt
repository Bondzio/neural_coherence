Any advice? What could the problem be? Thank you!

The situation that it works with both devices having indirect connection (via a router) is much more common. So I'd try to get that working first. And then you might find that the direct connection works also. Kees

It worked also for the other people in the thread. They say to just write the IP of the other computer in the default gateway (the IP that is automatically assigned, although you could also assign it manually)... I did it for both computers and it worked, although I had not shared all folders, so only a few were shared, but both computers appeared in the network...

So, you do it just that way. You give each a &quot;static&quot; address. They must both be withing a compatible range and you don't need a gateway address. The most simple way would be to use the old MS convention for LAN use. Set one to IP 192.168.0.1 and the other to IP 192.168.0.2. Set the subnet mask for both to 255.255.255.0. Your PCs should now happily connect. This doesn't mean you can access or move files yet. You need to set up file sharing and create at least one user one both PCs that share their username and password. It's also best if these are in the admin group. Good luck.

I don't know if it is because the OS are not the same, or because the laptop (and the network card in it) are a bit old (about 5 years). If you connect the two computers with the crossover cable and then try ipconfig /all (I think that's what it was, I found this info on the net too) you will find out the automatic IP address assigned by the crossover cable. (It won't appear if you just try ncpa.cpl, but it is there...) I also tried those IP addresses you mention + the subnet masks, but the only thing that worked was adding the IP address of the other computer in the default gateway... I found this solution &quot;hidden&quot; in a thread, so obviously not a well-known solution, but it worked!
