hi all, running winxp pro.
computer has been running fine.
then installed sp3.
after that, at every startup i got 2 error messages.
the first error message said: airgcfg.exe - entry point not found.
the procedure entry point apsgetinterfacecount could not be located in the dynamic link library wlanapi.dll when i clicked 'ok' on that message, a second error message came up that said: wzcsldr2.exe - entry point not found.
the procedure entry point apsinitialize could not be located in the dynamic link library wlanapi.dll i have since learned that the 2 error messages could have been removed by simply updating the dlink wireless driver.
before i discovered that fix, i did the following.
i put the pc in safe mode, and i checked c:\windows\system32\wlanapi.dll to see if the sp3 install had added a second wlanapi.dll file.
i thought that might be causing the problem based on some suggestions i found in a google search.
then i deleted another file that's almost identical.
it was the file: wlanapi.dll.
the w and a are capitalized and the file size was larger than the wlanapi.dll file that i didn't touch.
within a second or two after deleting the wlanapi.dll file, the monitor froze.
i hit the soft reboot and now when the computer comes on, the monitor stays completely blank, nothing on it, no post, nothing.
i turn the pc off and on and there are no beeps, all pc led's come on, the fans are on, the dvd led's light up for a moment, but monitor is blank.
any ideas on what i can do to get the pc up and running again would be greatly appreciated.
