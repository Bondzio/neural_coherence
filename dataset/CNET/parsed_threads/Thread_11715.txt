<s> Hey, I just installed the ATI Theater 550 Pro TV tuner card, and I want to play my PS2 on it. </s>
<s> However, I can't seem to find a way how to play it. </s>
<s> So I have a few questions: First, how do I go to the PS2 in the first place? </s>
<s> Do I access it from TV? </s>
<s> Is there supposed to be a special channel? </s>
<s> Second, I don't have a cable or tv antenna connected; do I need to have one connected to play the ps2? </s>
<s> Third, I have Windows SP1. </s>
<s> Do I really need SP2 to play on the ps2? </s>
<s> The outputs on PS2 are??? </s>
<s> RF??? </s>
<s> Video??? </s>
<s> ?How did you hook your PS2 to your TV???? </s>
<s> So lets say RF set PS2 to channel 3, connect a RF cable from the PS2 RF out to channel 3 the ATI tuner input and tune it to channel 3. </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> How do I set the RF? </s>
<s> I'm a little confused by what you're suggesting. </s>
