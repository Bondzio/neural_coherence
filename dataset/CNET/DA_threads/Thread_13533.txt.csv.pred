1.1.1	I have heard somewhere that there is a size limit to HDD when used with a P2 or P3 computer and wondered if anyone knows because I am about to purchase a new HDD and don't want to get the wrong thing.	St
1.1.2	Maybe it was a limit on HDD size with the OS system used, I have no idea.	St
1.1.3	I have a P2 350mhz 256 ram and a 4ghz HDD and I also have a P3 400mhz 128ram and a 8gb HDD using Windows ME and XP.	St
1.1.4	These are my backup computers and still very functional and I would like to spruce them up a little so any help would be appreciated.	St
1.2.1	http://www.48bitlba.com notes the common limitations.	St
1.2.2	You may be running a DOS based Windows so that is a limit to 127GB if the BIOS supports such.	St
1.2.3	Many will not update a BIOS, but I always do this in my upgrades but your choice.	St

1.3.1	Earlier versions of Windows don't support hard drives greater than 137 GB, but Windows 2000 (Service Pack 4) and Windows XP (Service Pack 1) do.	St
1.3.2	Please note that for both OSes, the service packs are necessary.	St
1.3.3	If you have SP2 (XP), you're in great shape, but if you don't have even SP1, you need to upgrade.	St
1.3.4	Windows 2000 needs SP4 to support more than 137.	St
1.3.5	Actually, you could get a 200GB HDD and use it with any version of Windows, you'd just be limited to 137GB, and the rest of the HDD would just sit there, not being used.	St
