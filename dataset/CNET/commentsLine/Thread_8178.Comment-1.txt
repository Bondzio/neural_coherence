i have the above model of linksys router and i am finding that i lose the wireless signal from the router several times a day.
my laptop states it is receiving an excellent signal, but the internet just goes down on me.
i have tried repairing the connection and it doesn't work.
i have to run upstairs, sometimes as many as 2-3 times a day, pull the power cord on the router, immediately plug it back in and by the time i get downstairs, i am connected to the internet again.
i contacted linksys who gave me a series of instructions for fixing the problem (reset) and it didn't work.
anyone else having this problem out there that was able to fix it?
