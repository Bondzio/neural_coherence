i'm not aware of any drawbacks using just 1 stick of 1gb as opposed to two of 512. someone else might be able to enlighten us both.
if your motherboard supports ddr-400, go for that, of course - although, check what your cpu frequency is - some would say it's better to have the same frequency for both.
cl is latency - the lower latency, the faster the memory.
from my own experience, cl2.5 is noticeably faster than cl3.
general advice - memory is key to computer perfomance; buy branded memroy from makers like kingston, crucial, corsair, and not generic unknown makes.
a good place to get memory is from crucial's own site -  - they'll also advise you on the best compatible memory for your motherboard and their prices should be well within your budget.
good luck!
