hello, okay, I have this old PII PC (soyo 6ba mobo) and I was using it to format/erase some old hard drives before discarding, when an old maxtor drive I had hooked up made this singing sound and when I restarted I got this message after a good POST: &quot;your program caused a divide overflow error (if problems persistst,conctact vendor etc)&quot; this message occurs whether I use a win 98 startup in the a drive or using the win 98 on the hard drive.
I am going to toss this machine and sell for parts anyhow but was curious as to what this is.
thanks!
