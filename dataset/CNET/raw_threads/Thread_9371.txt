A couple of months ago bought new Dell computer and just connected them and they sound better than ever. I noticed, however, over the last couple of days I can hear this very annoying squeak coming out of them ... volume is turned right down ... what could be causing this? Help! Thanks!

Mostly likely it's either the speaker or the connection. Try disconnecting and reconnecting all connections. Also try switching the left and right speakers. If the same speaker makes the squeaking noise, the problem is with the speaker; it might need to be replaced. Speakers don't last forever, although most good ones should last more than six years if not abused. If you switch the speakers and the other one makes the noise, the problem is with the source. Make sure the sound card (if you're not using onboard sound) is firmly seated in its slot. Try using a different sound card, if possible. Like most such problems, isolating the cause is a matter of trial and error, and a process of elimination.

Anyway, what do you mean by squeak? Do you mean a high pitched noise that is there all the time or just when you play music or hear sound? If only when you are listening to music or other sound, does it come from both speakers. If ''yes'', reverse the left and right speaker leads to see if the sound follows the speaker or the channel. If ''no'' can you try them in another PC or connect them to another input source. Mine started to act up a while back and would produce a raspy sound intermittently. I had to pull the sub woofer assembly apart to get at the amplification circuitry and eventually found a bad solder connection or two in the output transistors stages. I had to resolder these. Getting into the electronics of this thing was a bit tricky. I suspect the solder joints were not that good and the vibration eventually broke the leads loose from the board. They're on another PC now and working fine.

Fingers crossed, at this very minute they are silent and the only thing which is not on, is the desk lamp. I noticed last night when switching off the lamp before the computer, the speakers let out a big &quot;rasp&quot;! Very odd! The squeak coming from the speakers was very faint, intermitent and not noticeable with music. But when I sat here quietly, was irritating. I am hoping they stay dumb for now! These speakers have bounced around with me from country to country and am amazed they have lasted this long. I bought new set from Creative Labs, but still in box; don't have the heart to throw these away - they still sound so amazing! The volume control is fidly (it's called a potentionmeter eh?), but means I can have the speakers far back, away from monitor (flicker) and mobile phone (buzzing). I do have new hardware since purchasing new computer; cordless mouse and QuickTV which, I suppose, could suddenly be interfering - too many wires and signals around!
