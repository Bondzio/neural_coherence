<s> I've got a 3 1/2 yr old gateway 700xl, p4-2.4gb, 1 gb ram with an Intel D850MV motherboard. </s>
<s> I have the NVIDEA GeForce 4 Ti4600 (gateway) video card. </s>
<s> The video started acting up going to the 640 display and a blue screen error message re. </s>
<s> an NV_4 video driver. </s>
<s> I pulled the video card and cleaned it and on reassembly and boot the fan(on the card) is not running and the card gets very hot. </s>
<s> I'm assuming the card overheated and will replace it. </s>
<s> The motherboard specs say go with an AGP 2.0 version card, 4x at 1.5 volts. </s>
<s> Are the 4x and 8x cards backwardly compatible; Are they 1.5 volts; will they work in my computer? </s>
<s> My card has 3 partitions on the insertion tab; the 8x ones I see have 2- I believe my AGP socket will take the card but are there problems? </s>
<s> Any recommendations for a replacement?- I'm not a gamer. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>

<s> Michael- Thanks for your response and link- as I read it ''a motherboard that supports 1.5V (AGP 4x) video cards should work ok with a .8V video card (AGP 8x), however in the later example the video card would only work at the fastest speed the motherboard supports (AGP 4x).'' </s>
<s> -- my interpretation is that I can purchase an 8x card if it fits in the slot but it will only run at 4x. </s>
<s> As I look in the slot in my computer, I don't see a divider to preclude the insertion.There is only one divider 2/3 of the way down. </s>
<s> However, I am confused by what I think is a conflicting statement earlier in the link-'' If a motherboard requires a 1.5V AGP card and you place a AGP card in it that is not 1.5V, you will physically damage the motherboard and probably the video card as well.'' </s>
<s> Is this a conflict with the earlier quote? </s>
<s> Any comments regarding this would be appreciated.Also any recommendations for cards. </s>
<s> Thanks, Mike </s>
<s> http://www.ertyu.org/steven_nikkel/agpcompatibility.html The physical damage can occur when you try to force a non-compatible card into the slot. </s>
<s> The dividers are positioned to prevent this, however some will try anyway. </s>
