Hello, I'm looking to upgrade to 1GB of RAM from 512MB.
Currently, I have 2 256MB cards installed.
Would installing 1 512MB card ruin the Dual Line configuration, or would it be okay?
Also, any recommendations as of brands, websites to buy from, etc.
Thanks P.S.
I have a Dimension 4700.
Thanks for the help.
