1.1.1	I am adding a second hard drive to keep some records on .	St
1.1.2	The one I am adding has xp pro on it already and I want to wipe it clean .	St
1.1.3	My main hd that I am using now also has xp pro on it .	St
1.1.4	Here is the problem I am having .	St
1.1.5	I connected my main drive to the end of the cable and my slave drive to the middle part .	St
1.1.6	When I boot up it ask which operating system I want to use and then begins to load the slave drive .	St
1.1.7	I want it to load my main drive so I can get into the slave to reformat it .	St
1.1.8	I have my jumpers set correct as for as I can tell .	St
1.1.9	Any ideas what I am doing wrong ?	Ques
1.2.1	Connect the drive you want to erase only .	St
1.2.2	Boot from a floppy or CD with a utility to wipe it clean of all data and partitions .	St
1.2.3	Personally , I prefer the drive manufacturer 's utility that does so as part of a destructive testing procedure .	St
1.2.4	These also test the drive hardware and the integrity of the media .	St
1.2.5	Every manufacturer has their own name .	St
1.2.6	Seagate 's is & quot ; Seatools & quot ; .	St
1.2.7	WD , Hitachi and others offer such .	St
1.3.1	Steve 's suggestion ... connect only the drive you want to wipe or clear .	St
1.3.2	That eliminates the risk of inadvertently wiping the wrong drive and once it 's wiped , it wo n't have an OS to boot from .	St
1.3.3	If you have an old IDE 40 wire cable vs. an 80 wire cable , the Master or bootable drive is usually placed on the middle connector .	St
1.3.4	( see link for more detail http : //www.mikeshardware.com/howtos/howto_connect_ide_hd.html ) VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	I got it going .	St
1.4.2	In my bios it was booting from hd1 instead of hd0 .	St
1.4.3	Once I figured that out all went perfectly .	St
1.4.4	I did try using the utility that came with the hd but for some reason my A drive only reads some of the disk but not all .	St
1.4.5	It would not read this one .	St
1.4.6	It says the disk needed to be reformatted .	St
1.4.7	I have bunches of floppies with pictures on them but when I went from 98 to xp I have not been able to view them .	St
1.4.8	I even changed the A dive thinking it was bad but I get the same thing .	St
1.4.9	But that is another story .	St
1.4.10	I did get it wiped clean and reformatted .	St
1.4.11	I have been moving my stuff to it already and all seems to be working well .	St
1.4.12	Thanks for the help .	St
1.5.1	back up what you do n't want ( or ca n't afford ) to lose .	St
1.5.2	VAPCMD	St
