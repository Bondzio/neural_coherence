<s> I had a problem that I was told was a rootkit, so I decided to reformat my hard drive. </s>
<s> Details on that problem, if necessary, are in this thread: http://forums.cnet.com/5208-4_102-0.html?threadID=379874%20&tag=unsubscribeForm;tracked-disc So now I have a fresh install of XP Pro, and I need to install my wireless driver. </s>
<s> I've done this successfully at least once before. </s>
<s> This time I am having problems. </s>
<s> I have the original disc with the drivers that came with my computer. </s>
<s> As I was installing the driver, the icon appeared in the taskbar with a &quot;New Hardware Found&quot; kind of message. </s>
<s> A couple seconds after that, my screen switched to a blue screen with lots of white text for a second, and then the system restarted. </s>
<s> Then I have the option to start Windows normally, in safe mode, or last known good configuration. </s>
<s> If I start Windows normally, the blue screen and restart happens again. </s>
<s> If I start with last known good configuration, I don't have wireless. </s>
<s> Does anyone know what my problem is? </s>
<s> motherboard chipset drivers before the wireless or any other drivers. </s>
<s> Did you do chipset first? </s>
<s> No, I didn't do that. </s>
<s> I started over and installed the two chipset drivers and a networking driver. </s>
<s> Are there any other drivers I should install before the wireless one? </s>
<s> Is there anything else at all I should have to do first? </s>
<s> Sorry but some machines like a Dell need ONE MORE THING after I install the OS, motherboard drivers and the wifi card driver. </s>
<s> It's called QUICKSET and maybe your machine needs this or something like it. </s>
<s> I'm going to plead with all members to start making good posts. </s>
<s> Include those make and model numbers to save you time and getting asked for the detail. </s>

<s> It's a Dell Inspiron 600m. </s>
<s> Is the QUICKSET another driver that should be on my disc or is it something different? </s>
<s> Google what that is and yes, without it all Dells I work on can't use wifi. </s>
<s> NOT A DRIVER! </s>
<s> I installed the chipset drivers, quickset, and several other drivers, and I'm still having the same problem. </s>
<s> The computer says that no wireless adapter has been installed. </s>
<s> When I install the wireless driver, it begins to detect it, but then the computer crashes. </s>
<s> Is it possible that the wireless adapter was damaged somehow? </s>
<s> I find the internals to give out. </s>
<s> Let's say you have a PC-Card slot. </s>
<s> Try something like this one _&gt; http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=F5D9010&cat=NET I keep one around or some USB version for days like this. </s>

<s> Thanks for all the help </s>
