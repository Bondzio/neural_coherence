the unfortunate happended to me over the weekend.
i believe either my motherboard (asus p4t533-c) or cpu chip (pentium 4 2.8) died since my pc won't boot/post.
my hard drives (2 western digital 120gb 7200rpm hard drives; 8mb cache) are raid configured (no array; the drives act as a single drive) using a highpoint raid controller card (rocketraid 133; a 2-channel ata133 raid adapter).
does anyone have any suggestions about whether i can put the two drives in an external enclosure and still access them using another pc (or an imac)?
i see a number of external enclosures that appear to be designed to accomidate raid drives but it is unclear with me if these will work.
thanks for any help.
