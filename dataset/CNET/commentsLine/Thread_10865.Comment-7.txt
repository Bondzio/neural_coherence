these types of questions generally illicit tons of opinions that just cause further confusion for the buyer.
as i write this, i see an older toshiba sitting beside me, a gateway in my travel bag, and my daughter's new acer that she bought when she got her first job out of college.
none of these computers have ever given me any issues or problems.
all three have performed at or above their respective specifications and my own expectations.
so what would you have me say?
i would rate all of them a buy.
what i would suggest is going to a store of your choice and test driving all of the systems.
compare them and then make a decision based on your results and reviews.
i just finished helping a neighbor purchase a new notebook and after everything was done, they bought a new hp laptop.
i think they made a great choice based on their criteria, not mine.
that is what's important.
one more thing, regardless of what you buy, once you have, don't second guess yourself based on information you didn't have originally.
make the best choice available and then move on and enjoy the new system.
good luck and let us know what you eventually get.
