I have a 320 GB external hard drive.
You can tell they are USB because the description will say USB.
My own came with a CD with the drivers and a manual.
I believe I had to install the drivers first before connecting the external.
Then the manual told me how to format the drive and list it in Disk Manager.
I agree about the backups.
I also use CD/DVD to backup, even though I use the external to backup as well.
