<s> Hi there! </s>
<s> I currently have an ATI radeon X1600 pro 256. </s>
<s> I sometimes experience some lag when I'm playing games and i was wondering if upgrading to the radeon X1650 pro 512 would show a considerable difference? </s>
<s> (I'm currently running 1GB of ram, would upgrading to 2GB also solve the slowdowns?) </s>
<s> It will slowdown. </s>
<s> There is no known system that doesn't slowdown on complex scenes. </s>
<s> If you are running VISTA, the 2GB is well known as a must have on games. </s>

<s> x1650pro is just a bit faster than x1600pro but not worthwhile as an upgrade. </s>
<s> in my opinion, you'd need to upgrade to a x1950pro or 7900gs for a noticeable improvement and only a x1950xt or 7950gt (or better) would be worth the cash. </s>
<s> if you're slowing down in certain games, more ram may help depending on the game. </s>
<s> for example, battlefield 2 needs 1.5gb or more for smooth play. </s>
