I got this WEI must be refreshed message...
I recently updated my Catalyst Control Center to 11.5 and overclocked my video card a little.
Could this be why it asked my to refresh?
Also, my graphics score was a 5.5, after this refresh it's a 5.6.
I believe that's from the overclock?
Thanks in advance.
