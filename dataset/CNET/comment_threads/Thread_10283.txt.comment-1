I recently aquired a DELL Demension 8100 1.3mhz P4.When I opened it up and found there was no memory installed and after futher examiation noticed it used RDRAM.Now this PC will be used for everyday computing and The Sims 2 game.My question is how much RDRAM should I install it this PC?I dont want to drop a whole lot of cash in this thing I jsut want it to run smoothly.
