At this time there is really not much to be gained by going to PCI Express. It's new technology and the gains that it offers are still a little in the future. Just, specifically, what do you expect to gain??? I assume that you have an AGP slot for Video. Many people here can give excellent advise on which AGP video card will give you improvement needed, if video is the issue.

Especially with a proprietary vendor's PC. When the time comes, simply buy a new system with all of the improved technologies.
