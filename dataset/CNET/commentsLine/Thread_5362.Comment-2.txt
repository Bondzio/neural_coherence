some don't understand the age issues but in short, electrolytic capacitors age and the noise levels on the board and psu go up.
symptoms can be like your machine.
fixes include new caps, new psu and new main boards.
you convinced me it's not a bios issue.
you didn't convince me you were not overclocking.
