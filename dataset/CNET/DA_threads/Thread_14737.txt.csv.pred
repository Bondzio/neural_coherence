1.1.6	When I tried to run Hardware Troubleshooter , a blank window appeared .	St
1.2.1	That 's not unusual if the BIOS is out of date or the owner did n't install motherboard drivers .	St
1.2.2	But you did n't tell much about the host machine .	St

1.3.1	What is the IRQ of the display device and what is the conflicting device ?	Ques
1.3.2	It may be possible to move one to another IRQ .	St
1.3.3	Another thing you can do is free up IRQs by disabling unused devices in the BIOS such as serial ports .	St
1.3.4	These can be reallocated by Windows when resources get scarce .	St
1.3.5	I might also wonder if you have a legacy device using jumpers to take a specific IRQ that the display card wants but this should be rare as display cards are n't usually that picky .	St
