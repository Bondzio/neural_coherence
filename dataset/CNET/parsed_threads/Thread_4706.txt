<s> I have a HP dv4000 series laptop running on a 1.73 GHz Pentium M, but I'm becoming aware that my system is not running as fast as it can/should. </s>
<s> I use GameTap a lot and when downloading games I am sometimes warned that my CPU does not meet the required speed - as low as 1400 MHz. </s>
<s> Why is this? </s>
<s> What can I do? </s>
<s> I am only a bit savvy, so step by step would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> 1) What else are you running on the computer? </s>
<s> If it is doing a few other things plus the game then it may be that the software looking at how much power is available isn't as much as you think. </s>
<s> 2) What power options do you have and are you trying to run at highest performance off the battery with options set to low things down? </s>
<s> That could also cause problems though there are other possibilities. </s>
<s> 3) Do you check the temperature on the laptop? </s>
<s> If it gets hot, then it may pull back on how hard it runs to try to cool down somewhat. </s>
<s> 4) Have you cleaned the case so that the dust bunnies aren't causing problems? </s>
<s> Regards, JB (Who likes his dv4000 but has a 2.13 GHz Pentium M processor) </s>
<s> I'm using http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=SpeedswitchXP to force the CPU to top speed for such tests. </s>
<s> Usually I leave it on DYNAMIC. </s>
