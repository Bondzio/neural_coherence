i've had the first computer in my area an old vic20, i also had a vic16 which is an odd animal.
i think it came from england.
any way those were hooked up to tv much like the nintendos etc.
were.
you had whatever your tv was capable of stereo or mono.
the newer systems used monitors and the first i believe was a tandy a radio shack clone just before windows.
these had monitors and comodore 64, 128, amiga did too but comodore wasn't ibm compatible.
tandy made the first clone to run ibm software but were phased out almost before they started.
they must have sold out i'm guessing.
they should have had patents and beat out bill gates or perhaps he bought them out.
when in college (electronic technician) we tried to make a monitor back into a tv but were unable because of the tiny signal they worked with and the ability to decipher what was what audio/video and where exactly to apply them along with the modulation and demodulation to deal with.
it was fun tryinh though.
today it would be a breeze because tv's and monitors have audio/video inputs so you can go either way.
i don't know what all the fuss is about because you can make your pc into a stereo and have all the output you want any way.
