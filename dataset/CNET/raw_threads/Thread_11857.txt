(RAID 0 is striping, which is faster but without redundancy and with a greater chance of failure.) Bob's workaround is, in essence, backup; this does have some advantages. A major disadvantage, however, is that backups take time. If I were going that route I would, as Bob recommends, choose Acronis True Image. To save time, those important things needing frequent backup -- mainly data & documents -- in a separate partition, and then do partition imaging. IMHO, the same idea applies to a RAID 1 system. In my case the single C drive contains the OS, program files, relatively unimportant data, and other items that do not change frequently. This drive is backed up only as needed. My D drive, which is a pair of drives i RAID 1 configuration, gets the more important and changable data. Hope this helps Frank
