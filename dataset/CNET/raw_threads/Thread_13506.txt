Qwest will be supplying a DSL modem with a wireless router. The first computer will be connected to the computer with a cat 5e patch cord. There will also be a laptop and a desktop with wireless connection. My question is, can the two wireless computers be configured to use the printer that will be hooked up to the wired computer? I have done printer sharing before, but all computers were hard wired to the router and a network port on the printer. Can it be done? and if so how do I set the computers up. Thanks in advance Wayne

I just did my two day ago. It works great. 1- Go to Add a printer 2- Follow add printer wizard 3- Select network printer 4 Select Brownse for printer Example: \\WinXP_home\HP 1100 Series 5- Select printer that is already connected to computer. 6- Go to computer that has the Printer. Reboot that computer. 7- Make sure the first computer work then do all the computer from step one again. Good luck. Please let us know.

In addition to the set-up described in the previous message for the &quot;client&quot; computer, you first need to make sure the printer is shared (Start -&gt; Printers & Faxes -&gt; right-click on printer to be shared & select &quot;Sharing&quot;. You may also need to check to make sure all computers are members of the same workgroup in order to share resources (right-click on &quot;My Computer&quot;, select &quot;Properties&quot;, then click on the &quot;Computer Name&quot; tab. Click on the &quot;Change&quot; button if you need to change the workgroup name. You'll need to restart the computer for the change to take effect. I actually did this just this afternoon on my home wireless network.

Make sure you have to browse for network printer that is available. Example: \\WinXP_home\HP 1100 series Good luck. Please let us know.

You may want to try turning off ZA (briefly) on the client computer and trying to access to see if it makes a difference. You can turn off ZA by right-clicking on the ZA icon in the system tray and selecting &quot;Shutdown ZA.&quot; You may also want to check to make sure your home wireless network is in the Trusted Zone (double-click on the ZA icon in the system tray, click on the &quot;Firewall&quot; tab/button on the left side of the ZA panel, then click on the &quot;Zones&quot; tab).

You can also access this feature from the windows firewall.

I just got back from my daughters and the wireless network and printing is working great with the help of all the advise I got here. The only thing different is, I had to load the printer software on to each of the wireless laptops before it would work? Thanks to all. Wayne

I'm wondering how the printer could be found on the network if the IP address changes everytime the DSL connection is cycled for dynamic allocated addresses. My DSL provider does dynamic allocation.
