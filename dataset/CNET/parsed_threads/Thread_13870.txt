<s> I recently started using an external hard drive with a USB 2.0 connection to backup all my important documents. </s>
<s> The drive is USB powered and NTFS formatted. </s>
<s> On multiple occasions during file transfers the drive would 'hang' and explorer would become &quot;Not responding&quot; and I would be unable to &quot;safely remove USB device&quot;, forcing me to turn off the PC or yank the USB cable out. </s>
<s> Now many of my documents and folders have become &quot;corrupted&quot; and unaccessible. </s>
<s> Is there any way I could salvage that data or restore it? </s>
<s> I appreciate any advice... </s>
<s> &quot;using an external hard drive with a USB 2.0 connection to backup all my important documents.&quot; This means to me this is a backup and not the only copy. </s>
<s> If the only copy then where is the backup? </s>
<s> That is, you did write backup and not &quot;to store all my...&quot; The issue of USB powered drives is not unknown. </s>
<s> Try adding a powered USB HUB or if your unit supports it, add a power supply to it. </s>
<s> If it is backup, then just delete the partition, create and format a new partition and begin again but keep an eye out for corruption. </s>
<s> If it does corrupt then make it a warranty issue. </s>

<s> Oh sorry about that Bob, what I meant to say was archive really, not backup. </s>
<s> The data on the disk is the only copy left of those documents. </s>
<s> Your advice is great for the future, but is there any means to restore corrupted files on an external drive like mine? </s>
<s> First the power issue should be addressed. </s>
<s> The simplest fix could be to add an USB 2.0 powered hub. </s>
<s> Most ports are &quot;not great&quot; power sources. </s>
<s> Dropouts can lead to corruption. </s>
<s> NTFS was a good choice but is damage resistant not damage proof. </s>
<s> OK, once you have good power to the drive you can look at solutions like GETDATABACK and ZAR (Zero Assumption Recovery) on google.com I strongly suggest the drive be set aside until the power issue is tackled. </s>
<s> -&gt; More about the future. </s>
<s> Backup and archive is where we have multiple copies. </s>
<s> This area is well discussed but today you don't get this from the vendors of machines or hardware. </s>
<s> My backup is on a few devices, 3 kinds of media. </s>
<s> My quick backup is to an NAS or hard disk that is on the network. </s>
<s> This is quick so it helps to keep daily backups done. </s>
<s> Next is another copy to a secure server of works that can't be lost. </s>
<s> From the works that can't be lost server we have 3 sets of DVDRW media. </s>
<s> And finally I have a distillation of what I can't lose ever on a 4GB memory stick that I can take with me everywhere I go. </s>
<s> I'm serious about backup. </s>
