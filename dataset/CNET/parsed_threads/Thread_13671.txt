<s> I am going to be training high school seniors on computer networking and I'm still searching for the perfect book. </s>
<s> I'd prefer to have (but not necessary) a book that also covers wireless and security if possible. </s>
<s> I obviously want to keep it on a level thats not too advanced but not for dummies either. </s>
<s> It should speak to the types of networks, OSI Model, etc. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any experience with this or have suggestions of a book I may want to try? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> The 'Dummies' series is good enough for 'not' so beginner. </s>
<s> As for more detail information, actually you don't need a book, because there are a lot of information on the internet that you can print. </s>
<s> Maybe you can give your student an assignment to go to certain website, take a note of any information they interested or need to know (+ the website address) and bring them to class to discuss it. </s>
<s> This way, everyone can collect as many information as they need, including you. </s>
<s> Then may be you can write your own book, specifically design for your class later on. </s>
