<s> I need to know how to mirror my hard drive (keeping all my programs and files) so I can replace it with a new drive. </s>
<s> And yes the best steps to do this would be nice. </s>
<s> CC </s>
<s> Norton Ghost. </s>
<s> Acronis True Image. </s>
<s> The new hard drive will have cloning software if it's a full retail version. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Acronis True Image.....your hard drive must be in working condition for this to work. </s>
<s> Like other issues, it is best done when everything works. </s>
<s> I recently installed a Western Digital 1 terrabyte drive and the cloning software that came with it was not compatible with Windows Home Server or Windows Vista or Apple's OS. </s>
<s> Carbon Copy for Apple OS. </s>
<s> Again, your drive needs to be working. </s>
<s> If you have errors in your hard drive, they will not be corrected by cloning. </s>
<s> Go to harddrive manufactures web site and download their free program </s>
<s> The onlyOne that does it is ShadowProtect Desktop 3.x even to &quot;Bare Metal&quot; base. </s>
<s> Google it! </s>
<s> i had this dilemma not long ago, and after reading up on the easiest FREE way to mirror my drive, this program won. </s>
<s> i cannot stress enough how simple it is to use this program. </s>
<s> worked flawlessly. </s>

<s> I've used the free version of HDClone to upgrade several PC's and laptops to larger drives with no problems. </s>
<s> You can download it from their site. </s>
<s> You install it to a floppy or CD then boot the computer from the floppy/CD that has the original and the new (has to be larger) drive attached. </s>
<s> Menu system walks you through it all. </s>
<s> I'd stay away from Norton, Acronis True Image is a pretty good choice, but you should consider also WinHex. </s>
<s> All you need is the old (bad) HDD, and the new one, both hooked up to a computer running WinHex and you're set. </s>
