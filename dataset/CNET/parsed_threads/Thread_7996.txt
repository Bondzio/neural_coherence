<s> Hello guys, sorry if this has been asked before or if this is in the wrong forum, but I figure I'll at least be pointed in the right direction. </s>
<s> My computer has an 80 gig hardrive in it, partitioned into 62.5 and 17.5 gigs worth of unallocated space (the result of getting rid of a linux partition). </s>
<s> Now I'd like to be able to use that 17.5 gigs to store files on, but I don't want to pay for Partition Magic or any other similar programs. </s>
<s> Are there any working free methods out there, and should I format it to FAT or NTFS? </s>
<s> Boot with that in and go through the steps to format that partition. </s>
<s> Of course, a reformat and install would return it to 1 partition. </s>
<s> But you would need to back up everything to another source that you didn't want to lose. </s>
<s> And make sure you have ALL drivers needed. </s>
<s> chuck </s>
<s> Thanks, but that's another thing I'd like to avoid (having to back everything up and etc...) </s>
