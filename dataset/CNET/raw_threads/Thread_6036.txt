Tip: If you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution. But I'd start with the epidemic issues I see. 1. Heat and cooling. Pull the case cover, point a fan at the internals. Check the CPU fan and if it's clogged or failed, shutdown and repair. Does more cooling help? 2. BAD MOTHERBOARD CAPACITORS Type those words into http://www.google.com to learn what to look for on the motherboard. If you see this, the symptom you note is typical of this issue. Fix? New motherboard. Bob
