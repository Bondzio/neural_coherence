<s> I am getting pounded, up to 4 times a second, with an attempted connection that causes the Console message: 2/8/10 12:04:27 AM </s>
<s> Don't know a lot about the airport since it is a mac box. </s>
<s> This almost sounds like a bug. </s>
<s> A outside machine that would scan ports would normally scan the low number ports looking for a application. </s>
<s> the high number ports are generally used for outgoing sessions. </s>
<s> Now if this was coming from the internet first it would not be sent to your machine unless you have DMZ setup. </s>
<s> When you are not running DMZ the nat entries are setup only when your traffic goes out. </s>
<s> This way the traffic coming back knows which machine to talk to since they all appear to come form your router from the view point of the internet. </s>
<s> The strange thing is the source address would be the actual address. </s>
<s> In this case you are seeing your routers address. </s>
<s> This appears as if somehow you are natting the public addresses to your routers private address. </s>
<s> Although there are limited cases where you would do this it is a very non standard thing to do. </s>
<s> I would go back and check your router config and try to make it as simple as possible. </s>
<s> Routers by default drop traffic like this just because of the way NAT works. </s>
<s> You really should not have to do anything special to block it. </s>
<s> The router will still have drop messages in its log, if it logs, but that is how it suppose to work. </s>
<s> The only other thing I could think of is that someone has gotten into your wireless on the inside and somehow your router is natting inside to inside traffic. </s>
<s> Again the router should have a log of this. </s>
<s> Bill, thanks for your explanation. </s>
<s> It taught me enough that I was able to do a helpful search. </s>
<s> mDNSResponder provides Bonjour service usnig UDP Port 53. </s>
<s> When that doesn't answer, it uses a random port to offer the service. </s>
<s> Since that application is reading port 53, it is safe to open it. </s>
<s> Now I've done that and the message is gone. </s>
<s> It didn't stop the messages. </s>
<s> It just slowed them to once every 30 seconds or so. </s>
