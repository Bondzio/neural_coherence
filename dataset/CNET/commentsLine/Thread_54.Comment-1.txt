i just bought a dell poweredge 400 sc and it has a reportedly good 250 watt power supply.
however i intend to use a bit more stuff in it (nvidia agp, sound blaster card, combo cd/dvd/rw) and was wondering if anyone was aware of a 3rd party replacement that fits the slightly non standard form factor dell uses.
dell's has the power plug and a 110/220 slider directly below it, but no on/off switch.
the mounting holes seem to match a standard atx supply.
looking from the back, the fans on the right and the power cord connector is upper left.
any thoughts, thanks, john
