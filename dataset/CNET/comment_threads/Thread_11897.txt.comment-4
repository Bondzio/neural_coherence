Thanks, I've actually spent the past 3 evenings (til the wee hours) trying to eradicate this crap off the old machine.
I had already started using hijack and several of the other tools before posting here.
I've been following along dozens of forums and tooling the net for strategies on how to clean this PC.
Last night I thought I took care of it, but now programs are running slow and scans are coming up with some junk again.
I've got a bad variant of the Smitfraud.B virus - lookout for this one, it's bad!!
Fortunately my ailing HD has weathered through all this so far.
I plan on connecting a secondary HD to the machine to drag off all my data as soon as the machine starts running right again.
