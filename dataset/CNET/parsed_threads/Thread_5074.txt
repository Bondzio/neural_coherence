<s> When I get a Blue Screen its all about Hardware.. .. Did you ORDER the Correct machine for the Software and hardware.. .. </s>
<s> Example...for Multi-Media you really need a Pentium 4 Processor as minimum..the Celeron D is a Audio ONLY CPU.. .. Also if you ordered a Video Card installed I might check that for the problem-since that's an ADVANCED User's part..your supplier might have that installed wrong.. .. </s>
<s> If this is your First PC/your definitely in trouble on the money side.. </s>
<s> It may have a Built in Defect from the Supplier..and if you intercede thay can PULL the WARRANTY.. You may want to CONTACT a Consumer Advocate in your Local Area for help on the issue of a defective PC. </s>
<s> There are TONS of good PC's.. Go to Circuit CITY to make a purchase..Circuit CITY has a Good Customer Service policy.. </s>
<s> I just built my first PC/but the LENOVO Brand seems really interesting.. .. DELL makes great PC's and Laptops..but you fairly well get stuck w/the configuration you intitally purchased..upgrades are risky.. .. TOSHIBA makes great products.. .. SONY/is expensive....I quess there are SONY fans out there..I have a SONY Burner Drive(its excellent).. .. PanaSonic makes LapTops called TOUGH-Books..take a look there.. .. </s>
<s> ACER...I saw an ACER at Circuit CITY-a LapTop...didn't need a LapTop but was vert tempted..nice Priced LapTop.. .. $$5000.00 will get you one heck of a PC. </s>
