i'm running windows xp.
i have downloaded the latest smart pack.
i have a firewall running, disk drives work for everything else.
if this matters, when i restart my pc i get an box open up for the ez dub disk but then it tells me i need to install the nero software first.
but when i try to load the installation cd i get the error message posted above.
