<s> *Which is better- XFX or MSI? </s>
<s> *As i am opting for 4 GB RAM, Which operating system should I use? </s>
<s> *Is DG33 FB good enough or do I need a Abit IP 35 E? </s>
<s> Or should I take a Biostar? </s>
<s> *Should I take 8800GT or Ati Radeon 4850? </s>
<s> Please help me on these queries and one more thing, My config should not cross 50K. </s>
<s> What changes should I make if at all my config crosses 50K? </s>
<s> I will be very thankful if you answer my queries Thanking you, Sagar NOTE: ALL THE PRICES ARE IN INDIAN RUPEES </s>
<s> go with the abit p35 based mobo if you can afford it. </s>
<s> it allows for overclocking and better memory optimization. </s>
<s> hd 4850 is faster than 8800gt. </s>
<s> the coolermaster 460w is a no frills, basic power supply but is sufficient. </s>
<s> xfx has a life time warrenty and great customer support so there are folks which would only use xfx Why ATI? </s>
<s> if you are into mmorpgs many of them like the nvidia better . </s>
<s> If into mmorpgs i had less issues with the 8600 512 then the better more expenxive cards I also suggest using a local shop that would post your cpu and mother board and power it up. </s>
<s> That way you have back up if something goes bump Post means they attach the cpu to mother board with fan and power it up. </s>
<s> Also include decent fans both side back and on top of cpu. </s>
<s> If into specific games have you gone to their web site tech help sections to see what video cards are experaincing problems? </s>
<s> What set ups seem to work best? </s>
<s> Best price isn't always safest way to go . </s>
<s> Sometimes having support after the sale is worth the extra then over the net purchase ( something to keep in mind) </s>
<s> Well, just some ideas. </s>
<s> Food for thought. </s>
<s> SLI? </s>
<s> You could double up graphic cards if you really want to push your max granting your MOBO supports it. </s>
<s> MSI vs XFX? </s>
<s> Neither. </s>
<s> I have read too many problems with both. </s>
<s> I used to be a fan of BFG but I gave up on that too as they were a little overbloated in my opinion. </s>
<s> I like EVGA. </s>
<s> Good CSR/Support. </s>
<s> Lifetime warranties. </s>
<s> Additionally, one of the few companies who offer tradeups. </s>
<s> Return an older graphic card/MOBO for the more recent component and they will give you credit towards the new one. </s>
<s> Not many companies offer such a perk. </s>
<s> 8800 GT? </s>
<s> Good bang for buck. </s>
<s> Better card than the 9800's actually. </s>
<s> If you want more power... 8800GTX. </s>
<s> 8800GTS's are mid range and would be pretty sufficient. </s>
<s> 8800GT GTS support 2-Way SLI. </s>
<s> 8800GTX supports 3Way SLI. </s>
<s> Each card has a some different specs, overclocking capabilities. </s>
<s> I happen to like the 8800GTS 512MB cards myself. </s>
<s> They are a good cost/performance ratio. </s>
<s> They look wicked too. </s>
<s> I don't care for Biostar boards. </s>
<s> Again, Asus boards or EVGA would be my preferance. </s>
<s> EVGA perhaps more for me as they lean to spec boards particularly for NVIDIA platform. </s>
<s> I've never steered away from NVIDIA even with ATI having had some great cards. </s>
<s> They're good for each other cause the competition drives the technology, so I don't hate on either or. </s>
<s> Do your research, it is a preference thing. </s>
<s> My viewpoint has been... AMD processor/ATI Card or Intel Processor / Nvidia card. </s>
<s> Doesn't have to be that way, but I think they just pair better and that is purely a personal opinion. </s>
<s> I think you are fine with processor choice. </s>
<s> Not worth paying much more right now. </s>
<s> There will always be something bigger, faster, better, and more expensive. </s>
<s> Vista will accept and register more RAM for the system than XP. </s>
<s> That does not mean it will lead to a performance boost. </s>
<s> XP will read somewhere around 3 Gig's of the RAM. </s>
<s> Circumstances and tweaks bending to get more benefit from XP with RAM beyond 2Gigs. </s>
<s> Research. </s>
<s> Forget where Vista taps out right now for RAM but I think it is in the range of 6-8 Gig area and that depends on the version. </s>
<s> Honest opinion, Vista is the red headed stepchild of XP which can never seem to walk straight. </s>
<s> XP is a better OS by far. </s>
<s> More efficient. </s>
<s> Do 4 Gigs RAM on XP Pro and even if it doesn't read all 4Gigs, the MOBO will utilize pretty close to all of it. </s>
<s> Bios tweaks can assist as well. </s>
<s> If you are a gamer and your Graphic card is a huge necessity, I would say you need to push past the 600Watt PSU area. </s>
<s> 460 doesn't cut the mustard for most cards and you don't want to inefficiently power your PC. </s>
<s> 600-800Watt PSU with Good rating should be sufficient, consider 700-800 if thinking of doing 2 GPU's in SLI mode. </s>
<s> Hard Drive. </s>
<s> This often is argued. </s>
<s> Me... </s>
<s> I'd shoot for SATA 3GB/s 7200RPM w/ 32MB Cache. </s>
<s> People will say you wont notice a difference, true gamers/pcfanatics will argue every MS counts when your clocking performance. </s>
<s> I feel the newer 7200RPM's outperform the 10000RPM drives as long as they are SATA 3GB/s. </s>
<s> Research. </s>
<s> Case/CD-DVD Drive/etc etc. </s>
<s> is nothing but preference. </s>
<s> Price: Under $1500 USD. </s>
<s> Do the conversion for Rupees. </s>
<s> My 2 Cents. </s>
