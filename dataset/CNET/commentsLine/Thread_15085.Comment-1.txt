hello, i have a windowsxp server at home.
i use comcast as my isp.
i have an android phone that has a ssh application that i would like to use to access the internet when i am away from my home network.
two questions arise.... 1. will comcast allow a ssh server to be set up 2. if so, can regular mobile networks handle ssh activity the way a wifi network does.
