Hi Phil Thanks for your reply.
I connected the PC to port 1 on a Netlink 5 port Ethernet switch, and connected the Uplink port to the only port on the Siemens Gigaset SE572 WLAN dsl.
The WLAN cannot detect the Netlink.
I can get the printer networked via the Netlink, no problem, but as the Siemens unit has only 1 port I have to connect it directly to the PC to enable me to access the internet.
I assumed I would be able to connect as in para 1, then connect the printer to port 2 on the Netlink and all would be well!!!
The software for the Siemens unit is installed and working ok. Again thanks for your time.
