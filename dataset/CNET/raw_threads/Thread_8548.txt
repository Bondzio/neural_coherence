Is there a USB stick or something I can buy to create a small network from my desktop?

The setup of the usual wifi dongle would have us need (in most cases) the OS setup CD as we would make fairly big changes to the networking. Just so you know that it's non-trivial so let your IT staff do that one. Bob

If the company wanted to have WiFi then there would be WiFi. There's no gadget that I can just plug in and create a network off of?

I have yet to see anything such as an USB WIFI adapter that would work without drivers and a somewhat involved network configuration. And as you said, it may be that they forbid wifi. If so why put your job at risk over this? Bob
