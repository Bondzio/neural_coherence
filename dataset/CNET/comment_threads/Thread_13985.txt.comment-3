Thanks Bob, A few feet has made a difference but its now in a place that will probably cause my wife to pick it up and throw it in the bin!
(bin = thrash can) I need the repeater because the WPN802 repeater is better at connecting to the primary than my wireless connections in the computers are and I have several.
I'll check into the WPNT834.
Will I need two.
Do they have a repeater mode?
Joe
