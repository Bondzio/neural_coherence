1.1.1	I recently overclocked an AMD X4 965 way to much and fried it .	St
1.1.2	So , I bought another one and it is sitting here next to me .	St
1.1.3	What I need to know is , When I put the new CPU in , will the previous CPU 's overclocked settings be active ?	Ques
1.1.4	I would think not , because I 'd just end up frying another CPU .	St
1.1.5	I just want to be 100 % sure before I lose another $ 180 .	St
1.1.6	Thanks -JRed13	St
1.2.1	or go directly into your bios and choose & quot ; factory default & quot ; or & quot ; fail-safe & quot ; settings .	Sug
1.2.2	refer to your mobo manual for instructions on how to do either .	Polite
1.3.1	I *assume* when you OC'ed you used the bios area to do so .	St
1.3.2	if that 's the case or any other OC'ing method which addresses the bios , then those setting are still in place , unless you cleared them by & quot ; resetting & quot ; the bios .	St
1.3.3	You can also remove the CMOS battery besides the clearing pins .	St
1.3.4	Thus , use either method to reset the bios to return to defaults .	St
1.3.5	You will still have to reset or set the setting you require for a typical setup .	St
1.3.6	You can then OC , using new setting below what caused your previous problem .	St
1.3.7	Now , understand when you OC , you also push the cpu into the areas of a higher demanding cooling setup .	St
1.3.8	thus address that to better handle the heat stress the cpu will be under .	Sug
1.3.9	The stock or typical HSF wo n't handle well once you exceed its limits .	St
1.3.10	Replace with a better cooling setup in order to keep within tolerances .	St
1.3.11	Also , the whole cooling process MUST be capable of handling the entire desktop airflow , so prepare to maintain the proper tolerance levels .	St
1.3.12	good luck tada -- -- -Willy	Polite
