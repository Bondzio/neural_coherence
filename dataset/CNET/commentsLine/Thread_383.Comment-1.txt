i'm trying to decide between getting a 23/24in.
widescreen (probably the dell 2405fpw) or dual 19in lcd's.
i know the picture quality should be better on the widescreen, but i can get the 19in monitors for less (although i'd want a new graphics card that had 2 digital outputs).
any thoughts, feelings, advice or suggestions would be welcome.
