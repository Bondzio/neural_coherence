<s> Hi, I just have a question about printing onto CD/DVDs. </s>
<s> I've read that CD/DVD labels aren't good for discs so I've stopped using them. </s>
<s> Sharpie seems to be the way to go, so I do use it for some of my stuff. </s>
<s> I can't seem to find much info on inkjet printing onto discs. </s>
<s> Will the ink degrade the DVDs? </s>
<s> Or is it likely to be made of similar stuff as sharpies and be just as safe? </s>
<s> Read http://www.supermediastore.com/how-to-dvd-cd-labeling-guide.html and you find that you want the ones for CD media. </s>
<s> The other labeling methods are covered nicely in the same article. </s>
<s> What am I using? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Sharpie but writing in the small clear area and 2. </s>
<s> Lightscribe. </s>
