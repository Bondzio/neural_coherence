To change the icon to something other than an hour glass.
Even the latest and greatest PC will show that if the internet is downloading something.
But back to reality.
I bet you meant 2 GB (gigabyte) RAM.
That's nice for Vista.
Don't get more than that on 32-bit OS based machines.
As to the video, I'm going to peg it at 256 MB for desktops.
-&gt; The really big item to look for is a DUAL CORE CPU.
Hope this helps.
