a seagate video comparing xt, ssd and 10krpm hdd boot times.
my strictly unscientific measurement has xt taking approx 75 secs and ssd 45 secs cold boot to w7 ready in a domain.
speed boost of xt and ssd applies to all storage activity, not just boot.
it's your call but i have abandoned spinning disks in anything but servers needing mass storage.
for better price/perf in your case, get one 64gb ssd for boot and apps and keep the other hdd for data w/2nd hhd in a usb enclosure as backup.
if you have 4gb or more ram, get rid of paging unless you need dumps.
