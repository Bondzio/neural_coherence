<s> I have a old pentium 4 computer custom built back in 2001. </s>
<s> Foll are the details: Pentium 4 CPU 1400 Mhz 256 MB RDRAM NVIDIA GEForce2 32MB While I am not a computer guy, I am comfortable swapping out parts to make it faster(Coming to think of it...I think I did swap out the orig graphics card sometime in 2005 or so). </s>
<s> Question is if it is worthwhile to make it last another 2-3 years by swapping out new components or should I just get a new computer. </s>
<s> Specifically: - What is the fastest CPU I can upgrade to using the same Board. </s>
<s> (The one inside is a Willamette 0.18um technology acc to Speccy) - What type of memory can i use. </s>
<s> I saw a post here saying DDR RAM(whcih seem to have won out the battle) is not compatible with RDRAM. </s>
<s> CAn I swap out all the RD RAMs to some other platform without changing the board... </s>
<s> Sorry for the long winded query but appreciate any expert advice. </s>
<s> Happy Holidays to all. </s>
<s> The CPU is governed by 2 things. </s>
<s> The motherboard and the availability of a CPU. </s>
<s> Since it's been many years the problem is that many searched and used up what would have been the faster CPUs. </s>
<s> We can't start looking for a CPU since you didn't supply what Dell computer this was or if something else, the make, model or details. </s>
<s> Even if we had that the speed bump would be minimal and frankly I've seen faster machines from FREECYCLE or the FREE AREA of craigslist for free. </s>
<s> I would not upgrade this box. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I was suspecting that much but wanted to get confirmation. </s>
<s> I do see some used components being sold online but figured that would put be back the cost of getting a cheap new one. </s>
<s> Also, The computer was built for me by a local store. </s>
<s> It has a bunch of retail parts. </s>
<s> So cant give you more details than in my orig post till I can open it. </s>
<s> I think I will start looking for New Year Sales for new computers. </s>
<s> Thanks again for your input. </s>
<s> Then the make, model and revision of the mainboard is needed. </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> There were socket 423 and 478 RDRAM boards. </s>
<s> And then some boards didn't supply HT P4 CPUs. </s>
<s> For now you could limit your search for non-HT CPUs of the 423 or 478 P4 with the same FSB. </s>
<s> Sorry but I'll stick to the acronyms and you can google what they mean today. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> PCWizard2010 or Belarc and they will tell you most everything you need to know about your PC components. </s>
<s> If you have a system requiring RDRAM, your best bet is to skip all this an head for an up-to-date PC. </s>
