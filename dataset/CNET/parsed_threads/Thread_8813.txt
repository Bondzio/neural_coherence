<s> Hey, I wanted to upgrade my motherboard. </s>
<s> I think my other one has had it and so does the guy at the computer store. </s>
<s> If I'm going to upgrade, then I'd like something that fits my needs. </s>
<s> I want a motherboard that will stand up to programs such as editing software including AVID, Photoshop, Illustrator, Aftereffects...to run simultaneously. </s>
<s> I currently have two gigs of ram (DDR2) that I purchased which my current motherboard cannot handle. </s>
<s> So it would need to support those. </s>
<s> It needs to be fast. </s>
<s> I'm assuming Intel 4 Dual Core Processor...but what do I know? </s>
<s> I would like a pretty decent graphics card...at least to support guitar hero!! </s>
<s> It also should have at least 4 slots for additional cards. </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be much appreciated?? </s>
<s> Obviously want it as cheap as possible, but able to support what I have listed...Thanks. </s>

<s> As for the graphics card...I intend to use Avid Express Pro. </s>
<s> They recommend to only us NVIDIA. </s>
<s> Is this just they're way to promote NVIDIA, or will the program actually not work if it isn't an NVIDIA? </s>

<s> the geforce line is aimed at consumers while quadros are aimed at business/professional users. </s>
<s> both use the same GPUs, but quadros include special drivers which are tailored for advanced open-gl use. </s>
<s> in practice, a geforce will run any app that a quadro will, but you might run into minor bugs (crawling lines, shadows not visible, etc). </s>
<s> whether or not the bugs are show-stoppers for your work (or even evident in your app) is up to you to decide. </s>
<s> check the forums to see what other users of the app use/recommend: http://community.avid.com/forums/14.aspx </s>
<s> Thanks for the info...just one other thing I'd like to inquire about before I purchase. </s>
<s> I currently have a Pentium D processor. </s>
<s> I was just curious to know how this compares to what you suggested, and if its worth me purchasing another one? </s>
<s> at any video task. </s>
<s> the q8200 is comparable to a q6600, so compare that processor with your p4d in these charts: http://www.tomshardware.com/charts/cpu-charts-2007/Encoding-Video-H-264-MPEG-4,358.html </s>
<s> Hey, I appreciate your help thus far. </s>
<s> I have purchased what you suggested, and I am left with one last inquiry. </s>
<s> The power supply that I have is a Retail Plus 465 Watt with a dual fan. </s>
<s> I just want to make sure this will be fine to power my new hardware. </s>
<s> The guy at the store mentioned that I would need something at least 500 watts. </s>
<s> Just wanted to know your thought. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
