i haven't read every comment so maybe someone has already said this.
i'd look at the old computer and say, what is it about this that i've outgrown?
for me, it's often that the hard disk is full and way smaller than what they are now selling.
or maybe it's the memory, or the graphics capability.
once you've narrowed this down, you will know what to look for in a new computer -- i look for the biggest hard drive i can get.
but, memory is a big issue with xp, bigger than it was before, imo.
my old desktop computer has 512 mb of ram and that's still enough for most things we do.
the laptop, that is actually newer, has only 256 mb ram and i'm often running out of memory.
i'll probably upgrade the ram on this laptop, and when vista comes out, i'll replace the desktop with a computer that has the most ram and the biggest hard drive i can afford.
though i have to say, i'm considering getting a mac.
you really might want to look at macs, depending on what you do with your computer.
i'm getting really fed up with microsoft and i wonder if it's not finally time to switch.
i'm not sure i'm techy enough to try to install linux on a computer, which is another alternative.
