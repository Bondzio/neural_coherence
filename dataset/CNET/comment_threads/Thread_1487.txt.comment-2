It should certainly be in the specs if they were able to render an xxx document (for xxx read: pdf, .docx, WordPerfect 9, AbiWord, ODT, .xlsx etc) without a PC to tell them about the fonts and having the Word or Excel or WordPerfect or OpenOffice reader to do the rendering work.
Which means: I don't think it exists.
