<s> I have looked at all sorts of DVD burners and found one I like (Lite-ON-IHAP422-08-DVD-Burner). </s>
<s> It meets all of my system requirements, but I can't figure out if PATA will work with my computer. </s>
<s> It is IDE, the right size. </s>
<s> I googled PATA and just can't quite figure it out. </s>
<s> Is this an addition or replacement for your system ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I have a Dell Optiplex GX280. </s>
<s> It is 3.2 GHz, 2GB ddr2 ram, XP Pro SP3. </s>
<s> I want to replace my CD drive with a DVD burner. </s>
<s> My CD drive is a Samsung SC-148A, and I'm pretty sure it is IDE. </s>
<s> I am looking at the Lite-On IHAP422-08. </s>
<s> It has the features I want, and is okay with the size, and system requirements, but I don't know if the PATA connection is right. </s>
<s> Do you need any other info? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>

<s> Guess I can get the Lite-On. </s>
<s> Yehaw. </s>
<s> just like the (old) optical drive it replaces. </s>
<s> Let us know how it goes. </s>

<s> I finally made up my mind and ordered an LG GH22LP20. </s>
<s> I think with help I have received here, I should be able to set it up. </s>
<s> I even think I can switch it to the master from the slave. </s>
<s> If not I will probably be back here again. </s>
<s> to jumper a new drive same as the drive it replaces. </s>

<s> Hey I got my DVD burner Today and installed it. </s>
<s> It is pretty cool. </s>
<s> I have watched a DVD, but not burned anything yet. </s>
<s> I got some dual layer discs, and am waiting on some lightscribe ones. </s>
<s> I have a couple of questions. </s>
<s> In my old setup, both of the drives were setup in the 1/4 position (I guess it is neutral). </s>
<s> I guess neither of them were master or slave. </s>
<s> My new drive was setup as the master. </s>
<s> I did not change this. </s>
<s> Will this cause problems, and should I change the old drive to slave? </s>
<s> Also, when I was in Bios?, I got the impression that I could have used the unused SATA output for a SATA burner. </s>
<s> Am I wrong? </s>
<s> I kind of hope I am cause LG has an SATA burner that reads HD and Blueray. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> When you say 1/4 position ...not sure I follow . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> do you mean the jumper placement ? </s>
<s> Usually jumper placement is clearly marked on the drive by MA, SL, CS, etc., IDE drives are usually jumpered as Master, Slave or Cable Select. </s>
<s> I prefer to jumper IDE drives as Cable Select where the Master and Slave are determined by their position on the IDE cable. </s>
<s> Drives at the very end of the cable becomes Master and the drive at the middle connector becomes the Slave. </s>
<s> Bottom line if the drives are working OK ...I'd leave them as is. </s>
<s> Re the BIOS...it's certainly possible the PC could have SATA ports you could have used for a CD or another hard drive. </s>
<s> Link below indicates some models have one SATA connector and others have two http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/opgx280/en/ug/specs02.htm VAPCMD </s>
<s> It was just what the diagram I was using from the Dell site, was labled them as 1-4 was (CS) 2-5 (SL) and 3-6 (MA). </s>
<s> I think mine was setup as both CS. </s>
<s> The cd drive was at the end, the dvd recorder was in the middle. </s>
<s> I think it is working, but can change it if it will make it better. </s>
<s> About the SATA. </s>
<s> My computer has an SATA harddrive. </s>
<s> It has two SATA ports. </s>
<s> One is empty. </s>
<s> I got the idea that I could have used the empty SATA port in bios. </s>
<s> It said the empty SATA port was for a harddrive or cd drive. </s>
<s> I wouldn't have been in bios except I was told by the person in the Dell forum that I needed to make changes there, but I didn't need to. </s>
<s> Guess that is only if you add a drive, not replace one. </s>
<s> Thanks for the info </s>
<s> Sounds like every thing is working OK and you could add another SATA drive...CD-DVD or HDD, if desired. </s>
<s> Re the BIOS and replacing or adding...right. </s>
<s> No need to change the BIOS if you're just replacing an old or failed drive. </s>
<s> VAPCMD PS...Just make sure you keep the dust bunnies out of the case...they easily clog the case fans and PSU fan as well as the CPU heatsink and fan. </s>
<s> Clean as a whistle inside and out </s>
