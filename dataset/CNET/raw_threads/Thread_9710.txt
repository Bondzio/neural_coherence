Previous to my problem the computer had been sitting for several weeks. I had taken the memory out and had not fully replaced it into the mobo slot. Without realizing this I turned on the computer. It beeped a lot, the power button light was on, and the HD access light stayed on continuously. When I realized what I had done, I unplugged the computer and replaced the memory solidly into the slot. Since then when I boot it, I get the screen message &quot;Operating System Not Found.&quot; When I go into setup, it shows no primary master or slave drive. It shows my memory, floppy drive and DVD-ROM(as a secondary master) correctly. The computer will boot from the floppy drive with a windows 98 boot disk. It runs programs from the floppy disk without problems. I have tried a different,working HD. I can hear it running, but the BIOS will not recognize it is there. I have switched cables. Nothing I try has worked. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks

I then disconnected the DVD-ROM and connected that cable to the HD. The computer booted fine. But then I took the cable in the primary slot and moved it to the secondary slot(the one that the DVD-ROM was in). After this the computer would not boot again. In other words the cable was bad the whole time. Once again thanks for the help. James
