<s> I'll start by saying I'm not new to pc's, I just don't have any formal training. </s>
<s> I have done countless hardware changes to my computers in the past with acceptable results. </s>
<s> Today however I needed to install a new CD-RW and to do this I had to remove the &quot;bay box&quot; of my dell. </s>
<s> I had to disconnect all of the ide and power supply leads. </s>
<s> (I have two HD's and two CD drives). </s>
<s> Once I had the new CD in I connected everything back and started up. </s>
<s> No video. </s>
<s> I changed a couple of cables around blindly and I got video. </s>
<s> But it ask me if I wanted to boot to safe mode. </s>
<s> I thought that it may have been because I had to power down because of the no video thing. </s>
<s> I booted to safe mode and it atomatically restarted and ask me the same question again. </s>
<s> it did this three times before I gave up. </s>
<s> Now I have tried what I feel is every possible cable combination. </s>
<s> I have even tried not connecting CD drives, a hard drive and still no solution. </s>
<s> Right now I do not have video again and I can't figure out what is wrong. </s>
<s> So I through myself humbly at your mercy. </s>
<s> Tell if the video is integrated or a pci card. </s>
<s> If a pci card, you may have bumped it causing it to become loose. </s>
<s> Reseat it in the slot to see if that makes a difference. </s>
<s> Try this one : After turning your PC OFF and disconnecting the supply 220 Vt, remove your video card and get it in properly. </s>
<s> Then check all the cable connections and then start up. </s>
<s> That's it friend. </s>
<s> Charidimos. </s>
<s> Review all aspects of what you did and verify its all OK. Now, look at your old CD drive and make sure your new CD drive is &quot;jumpered&quot; the same way, its either MA/Master, SL/Slave or CS/Cable Select. </s>
<s> Your new drive should have a decal/embossed(manual/docs) showing what the jumper ordination is. </s>
<s> Then, check the cabling etc. </s>
<s> for all other devices. </s>
<s> Once done, proceed to boot and allow to finish. </s>
<s> If it boots into safe mode, let it finsish. </s>
<s> After its done, restart it from OS, it should then go into regular mode. </s>
<s> Dell, does provide some info/details on upgrades, check thier suppport website for such on your model. </s>
<s> Doesn't matter is it isn't a Dell upgrade itself, any upgrade of your need is explained. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
