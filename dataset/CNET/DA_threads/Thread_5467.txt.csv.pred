1.1.1	I am looking to log on to the internet if I am traveling and not at a Wi-Fi hotspot.	St
1.1.2	I guess I am confused on the difference between Wi-Fi and wireless internet provided by a phone company like Alltel or Verizon.	St
1.1.3	If I buy a laptop that says it has 802.11g, is that just good for Wi-Fi at a Starbucks or some other &quot;hotspot&quot;, or will 802.11g also work for providing wireless internet access with a phone provider like Alltel, Verizon, etc?	St
1.1.4	Maybe I should also ask if 802.11g is a card built into a laptop, and if you must have another type of card for wireless internet service?	St
1.2.1	802.11g is now a common feature built in to laptops.	St
1.2.2	It allows you to connect to hotspots or your home network.	St
1.2.3	It will not connect to your phone provider's wireless Internet access.	St
1.2.4	You must purchase a different card for that.	St
1.3.1	802.11 cards are for hot spots and wifi If you want to use the internet anywhere and everywhere, get a nice cell phone(like my blackberry) and tether with it, or a mobile broadband card and stick it in your laptop.	St
