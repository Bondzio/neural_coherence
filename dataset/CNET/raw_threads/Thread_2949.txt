7512	0	310247	2868861	NR	snooz	9/27/08 11:06 PM	1.22255676E12	wireless n or g	I just set up my home network with a &quot;n&quot; wireless router. I have 2 laptops with g cards and desktop with a N adapter. When I check my network with my laptop it shows up as a G network. I assume that if I am running my only my desktop with the N adapter it will show as a N network. What happens when I am running my laptop(G) and desktop (N) at the same time.
