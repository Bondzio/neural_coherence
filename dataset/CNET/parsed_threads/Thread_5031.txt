<s> I have two LAN connections from two different service providers, and obviously with different conncetivity settings. </s>
<s> The PC is currently having one ethernet connector. </s>
<s> How can I configure my PC to run both LANs at the same time but with different settings? </s>
<s> it sounds like you have 2 ISP's, in which case you need to just take the faster of the two if you have a in-house/in-office LAN + your internet and want to connect to the web + have the LAN you need to get a router, and feed it into the switch or hub that your using for the office so it can provide the internet to everybody/thing configuration of 2 LAN's on a single PC is possible if you have 2 NIC's </s>
<s> We do have an in-house LAN sort of a thing but recently our boss decided to get another ISP running in case te first one bogs down. </s>
<s> I did installed another NIC in addition to the Built-In Ethernet connector. </s>
<s> But how will I configure IE6 with two opposite settings? </s>
