click start -&gt; control panel -&gt; performance information and tools -&gt; advanced tools -&gt; generate a system health report.
it will take 60 seconds to collect the data, then another minute to generate a report.
then look in the basic system tests and click the + next to disks, and voila there it is.
then below there you can click the little down arrow to the far right of where it says disks and again where it says disk totals and physical disks there's a bunch more info.
no doubt it is a bit cryptic to get to it, but persistence pays.
