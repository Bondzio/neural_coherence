hey madtownidiot, i'm planning to build a new system with the qx6800 processor.
now, i've been looking everywhere to try and find this processor, but no luck.
i read somewhere that Intel only sells it to OEM companies like Dell, Alienware, etc, but not to hardware retailers like Newegg, Tigerdirect, etc.
So my big question is: Where did you buy your qx6800 from ?
I really really wanna know.
Thanks a million.
