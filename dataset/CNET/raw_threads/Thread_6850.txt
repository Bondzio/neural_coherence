It started about three years ago when when I purchased my first wireless router - Linksys B. I kept my desktop hard wired and ran my laptop and Playstation using Linksys wireless adaptors. Everything worked fine for a couple of months when suddenly the router quit working. I had to run the installation software to get the router to work again. This pattern continued (even after I bought a new PC) until last fall when the router quit completely. I purchased a new router - Linksys WRT54G v.5. Around Christmas time - same problem. Just today it did it again. It's really not that big of a deal, just a pain in the a$$ doing this every couple of months. Anyone have any ideas what would cause this? Thanks for any help.
