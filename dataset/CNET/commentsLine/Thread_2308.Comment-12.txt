ok my motherboard has 4 slots for ram.
3 of them are blue and the 4th and closest one to the processor is black.
i tried my stick of ram in each slot alone and didnt get any beeps.
oh and by the way.
the video card's box has a 6 pin pci-e connector that splits into two 4 pin ide connectors.
i don't know whether to use the power supply's 6 pin pci-e connector to go into the video card, or to use the video card's ide splitter thing.
