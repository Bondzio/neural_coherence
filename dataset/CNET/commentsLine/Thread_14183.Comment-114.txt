i answered 1980's for pc use.
it was an ibm xt in 1982. i had been using main frames (now workstations in a lan) since 1977 through the 1980's (until 1988).
all the computer usage during the 1980's was at nasa/gsfc.
after 1988 most facilities had distributed lan networks with individuals using workstations (sun, dell, gateway, etc...).
does a stand-alone dec 11/23 (1982-1988) count as a pc?
