if you can burn a cd, there are instructions for slipstreaming the driver into your copy of xp.
google: xp slipstream sata driver - or - google: xp unattended install sata driver alternatives: - borrow a floppy drive just for the installation - cannabalize old computer for a floppy drive - buy an internal floppy drive (usd$6 +sh) - buy a nice external usb 2.0 floppy drive (very handy) my preference: beg, borrow, or buy a floppy drive
