i bought a computer from my good friend.
before i bought the computer, he had hard drive problems so he had given it in and got a new hard drive for it.
it's definitely not a hard drive problem.
i think its most definitely a driver problem because i had the same problem with the modem yesterday, i just needed to get on another computer, and download the drivers for it.
but that was a different story because i knew what type of modem i have.
this time, i can go to device manager, and it will be under &quot;other devices&quot; named video controller(vga compatible).
along with it in the &quot;other devices column, is multimedia audio controller and ethernet controller.
i can type in &quot;dxdiag&quot; into run and go to display, and beside name and chip type and all of that are just &quot;n/a&quot;.
i have no idea what's going on here at all?
do i really have no video card?
