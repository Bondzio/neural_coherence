My budget is around $1300 and I think I found a good deal on this dell laptop http://ecomm.dell.com/dellstore/popups/popup_sys_details.aspx?itemtype=&s=dhs&l=en&cs=19&c=us&item=361635ff-6f7a-4e54-a89b-b5e5aa751463&cart=MySavedItems (if for some reason the above link does not work, here is a pic of the specs) http://img84.imageshack.us/img84/7562/laptopbe6.png My questions are: will this dell draft n wireless card work with any wireless router? And is there any other laptop that would be better considering the criteria? Or is this laptop good to go?

You can always find a router it won't work with which is a non-issue since I've experienced that with 802.11b/b cards too. Usually a firmware update to the router is the fix. Hope this helps. Bob
