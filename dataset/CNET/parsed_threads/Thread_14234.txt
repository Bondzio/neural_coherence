<s> I am in need of a upgrade for my main computer. </s>
<s> I mostly use that computer for gaming and graphic/web design. </s>
<s> I have never used AMD so I am not sure if I want or can come up with a good system based off their CPU's. </s>
<s> However, if someone can come up with some ideas for highend AMD system that will work with what I have in mind; I may take a look. </s>
<s> I will list the parts I have come up with so far and I would love to hear any feedback. </s>
<s> Also, I have a limit of about 2300 to spend. </s>

<s> wow that is an extreme system. </s>
<s> although, if you do do gaming, you might want to look more at amd. </s>
<s> they are the best when it goes to gaming. </s>
<s> everything looks good, and the power supply should handle that, but you should look at antec's new line of true power II. </s>
<s> water cooled - nice gpu - either is fine where is your hard drive btw? </s>
<s> i would say go 2 raptors in RAID 0 and maybe add another 120gb drive cuz you have alot of moooonay! </s>
<s> case - ??? </s>
<s> i would recomend the new p180 from antec. </s>
<s> the cooling on this is superb esp if you choose intel. </s>
<s> yah other than that, you are building a beast. </s>
<s> konny </s>
<s> I was thinking of overclocking the 3.73 to 4.0. </s>
<s> I have seen gaming benchmarks with the EE overclocked to 4.0 and it was performing only a little bit under the FX-55. </s>
<s> Plus, I am guessing the other parts that I am getting will make up in performance in the games. </s>
<s> I have a 120 internal and 60 external that I will use. </s>
<s> I was thinking about getting one raptor but would only one SATA HD ruin the point of raid? </s>
<s> The case is the first Koolance item I listed under &quot;Stuff I already have&quot;. </s>
<s> The water cooling system is built into a custom Lian Li case. </s>
<s> requires at least two drives. </s>
<s> Beat the Intels in both the PCWorld and PCMag bench tests. </s>
<s> Kick on up to the dual processor and it will kick the Pentium's butt. </s>
<s> Get a DVD-ROM too. </s>
<s> Never know when you might want two DVD drives, hint, hint. </s>
<s> Don't wast your time, even thought you didn't mention it, on a dual layer drive. </s>
<s> The disks are outrageously priced, about ten bucks each. </s>
<s> I would obviously get the FX-55 with a nice Asus mobo...maybe even SLI if u felt like it </s>
