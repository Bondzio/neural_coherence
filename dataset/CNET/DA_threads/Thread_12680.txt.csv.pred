1.1.1	I was wondering if I am doing something wrong .	St
1.1.2	I am connecting my Cyber Home CH-DVD 300 via component video out , into a monitor with a vga only input .	St
1.1.3	The cable I am using is The HDTV RGB/15 pin to 3 rca Component video cable .	St
1.1.4	There also is a Male vga to 2 female vga & quot ; splitter & quot ; that is connected to the monitor .	St
1.1.5	i am running audio out rca and i can hear the program just fine , i just ca n't see it .	St
1.1.6	My computer is connected to the other side of the splitter and it works just fine , however when i have both the computer connected and turned on , and the dvd player there seems to be a signal interruption , which is leading me to believe I can make this work .	St
1.1.7	The other part of this equation is that on the vga side of the component cable , there is a pin in the middle that is missing .	St
1.1.8	I hope someone can help me .	St
1.1.9	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	my motto has always been ... why look for trouble when there ai n't none ?	Ques
1.2.2	You have component out .	St
1.2.3	What input connection/s do you have on the TV ?	Ques
1.3.1	vga is the only input , if i had multiple inputs i would try them .	St
1.3.2	oh well .	Polite
1.3.3	thanks !	Polite
1.3.4	let me know your thoughts .	Sug
1.4.1	what you are trying to do .	St
1.4.2	My suggestion is to watch dvd/video through the computer or just plug and unplug your source .	St
1.4.3	My guess is that your Y-method of connection is not going to work .	St
1.4.4	A switching box might work better but I do n't know if they sell such device though .	Sug
1.4.5	Good luck .	Polite
1.5.1	the reason I am trying to do this is so i can give my computer a rest .	St
1.5.2	i run a video editing software quite a few hours a day and i 'd like to give my computer a rest , if possible .	St
1.5.3	one of the pins of the component to vga cable was broken off .	St
1.5.4	i ordered a new cable , it should be here within the next day or two , i 'll let you know if it works , if you even care , haha .	St
1.5.5	thanks again for all the help !	Polite
1.5.6	have a good one .	Polite
1.6.1	At first I thought you were having some digital to analog problem .	St
1.6.2	But I do n't really think that is the problem .	St
1.6.3	I read the HTPC forums on the net , and I imagine the computer just wo n't accept the signal .	St
1.6.4	You will see on amazon.com that many people buy wires trying different task you would think will work , but then they do n't .	St
1.6.5	Lots of the converter adaptors and wires have low ratings because of this fact .	St
1.6.6	they usually convert one way only .	St
1.6.7	Many times displays just do n't accept the signal because of some silly reason that takes a degree to understand .	St
1.6.8	try amazon.com or avsforums and you might find the answer faster .	St
1.7.1	I had the same problem too , and I 'm using a CyberHome CH-DVD 300 DVD player as well .	St
1.7.2	I 've used it fine with older tvs using a yellow jack composite cable with audio cables , so I did n't think it was the player .	St
1.7.3	BUT IT IS !	St
1.7.4	The trick is that this model dvd player is factory set so that it only recognizes S-Video outputs without considering other good connections !	St
1.7.5	You need to go into the SETUP menu to change it out .	St
1.7.6	On the remote , press the SETUP button ( top row , third button ) to access the menu .	St
1.7.7	Then move the arrow to the right to choose the VIDEO option and press ENTER .	St
1.7.8	Then move the arrows to the VIDEO OUTPUT option and choose the YCbCr option !	St
1.7.9	If the original poster is still experiencing the problem , try this solution !	St
1.7.10	I racked my brain trying to figure out what was wrong and only came across this solution after looking at troubleshooting for the player itself .	St
1.7.11	Reviewers at Epinions have noted similiar problems and this solution working for them .	St
