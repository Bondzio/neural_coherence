1.4.1	I thought the laptop was dead at all hotspots .	St
1.4.2	If not , tell a little longer story but beware there is no click here cure .	St
1.4.3	If the laptop is dead everywhere , system restore or drivers do n't help I try a WIFI PC-Card .	St
1.4.4	Then I get the internal card replaced .	St
1.4.5	If the wifi card fails I reinstall the OS if I 'm paid to do that since it 's the faster fix and least cost .	St
