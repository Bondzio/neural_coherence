I am only 40 feet away from my cable with Netgear WNR2000 router.
Can I just connect my notebook to my old Netgear WGR614 v7 router and have 2 routers talk to each other?
How can I find out what channel I am on, if it is in use then how do I change it?
What is the name of software that checks the signal and where can I get it?
Thanks.
