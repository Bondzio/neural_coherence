sorry it took so long to answer.
the replies were not showing up on my profile, so i didn't realize all these had come in.
i appreciate all the help.
i went ahead and bought from staples, i ended up saving about $10 over what i could find from the cheapest store for the cartridge.
since i needed them quickly and needed good quality i decided not to take any chances, plus i could return them right to the store if there was a problem.
i appreciate all the help and definitely will be checking these sites for the future.
thanks again!
