Thanks for the response, I forget the brand, but I have a middle of the road in price 750w psu.
I built the pc myself really didn't skimp on anything.
As far the size of my case, I haven't measured or anything, but I have a pretty big case: Cooler Master HAF 922.
The &quot;24 amps&quot; part of your response interests me.
Can I make more or less power come from my psu?
Also, may I infer from your response that I should not expect any problems running an nVidia gpu on an AMD board?
Thanks again
