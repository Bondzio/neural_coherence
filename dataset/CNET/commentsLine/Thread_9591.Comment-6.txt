let me know if this is correct.
my ide cable has two connectors.
right now the dvd/cd is the ''master''.
i should change the hd to be the master on the hd jumpers.
then i should remove the master ide connection from the dvd and connect that to the hd and reconnect the dvd/cd to the slave connection.
is that corect?
what about the bios setting?
thanks
