that was my original thought before i posted.
but i could only find routers on the net.
maybe i'll look locally; i'm settling on netgear, cuz that's what my bro' in law uses, and setup was so quick, and he said their tech support was really good.
will let you know how it goes.
thanks for input.
btw, the new look in here is pretty cool.
