1.3.1	I do n't know what the monitor is supposed to do when loading , i 've never been able to use it before .	St
1.3.2	And yes my computer is on ( i 'm not that dumb that i did n't try and turn on the computer too ) I have an old IBM 15 & quot ; monitor sitting next to it now that i 've been using up til now and when i plug that one in , everything works fine .	St
1.3.3	I 've tried fiddling with settings , loading drivers for the new monitor , pretty much anything that a semi-intelligent computer user would do in order to try and fix the problem .	St
1.3.4	I 've changed settings , restarted the computer but nothing works so far that i 've tried .	St
1.3.5	I 've also noticed that if i plug the & quot ; new & quot ; monitor in and turn it on it proceeds with the problem that i described in my first post ( it 's almost as if it 's trying to turn on but then it turns off before it can and then back on ) but if i unplug the actual video cord ( 15 prong cord thingy ) that the monitor will only flash between the green and orange lights and not turn off as well ?	Ques
1.3.6	could this be a clue to something ?	Ques
1.3.7	please help anyone , i 'm sick of using a 15 & quot ; monitor and my eyes would love to see the & quot ; new & quot ; 19 ' one working soon .	Ques
1.3.8	Thanks again to anyone that can help me with this	St
