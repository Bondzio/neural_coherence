My graphics card at the moment is a PCI-E card so I assume that means any other will work?
will getting that better graphics card makes games run faster?
(as this is my primary concern) I regularly play World Of Warcraft and have to have lowest possible video settings and occasionally play Football Manager 2009 and this also runs very slowly (due to the 3D match engine)
