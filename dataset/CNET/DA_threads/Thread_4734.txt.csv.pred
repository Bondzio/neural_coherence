1.1.1	I have been working on a Dell Dimension 4400 Desktop Computer .	St
1.1.2	However , I have run into a big problem .	St
1.1.3	When it starts up , It gives you the menu for Safe Mode , Last Known Good Configuration , Boot Up Normally , etc .	St
1.1.4	If you click on any of these options , you get a quick blue screen , and the computer reboots .	St
1.1.5	It takes you back to that menu .	St
1.1.6	Can anybody help me with this ?	Ques
1.1.7	I 'd appreciate it !	St
1.2.1	1 .	St
1.2.2	Take a moment on your next post to craft a meaningful title .	St
1.2.3	Please .	St
1.2.4	2 .	St
1.2.5	Consider that I can only guess that you may be using Windows 2000 , XP or 2003 .	St
1.2.6	Repairs may vary , BUT a little history could reveal what the issue is .	St
1.2.7	For instance , another poster with the same plea revealed they changed the motherboard .	St
1.2.8	The answer is clear on that one that they get to reinstall the OS since Windows NT , 2000 , XP and 2003 do n't like such changes .	St
1.2.9	Tell more and post a better titled post with more words and history in the OS Forum that matches .	St
1.2.10	Bob	St
