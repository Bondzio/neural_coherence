those wall protectors are still basic protection, but better than nothing.
you can use them and a strip surge protector(plug into) that may allow better access for ac warts and such.
i do suggest don't use all plug-ins as you may turn the ac outlet into electrical &quot;hot spot&quot;.
if you can, use yet another ac outlet.
i understand you maybe limited but its important as a safety fire issue.
if you like spend better $ on protection as you're items are high cost, its worth it.
as an added note, i put &quot;singular plug surge protector&quot; at the end of a ac cord, then into the strip or wall protector and/or ups.
it seems redundant, but i've experienced mucho lightening hits over the yrs.. tada -----willy
