Thank you Bob, I have done a lot of things acording with HP suport, from reparing and reinstalling the OS, last thing they suggested was to use an utility called active killdisk, I have downloaded but it wont work since is the free version and would only do a zero phase erasing, What would you suggest, do you think this will work, and is there another free utility that would do the same has killdisk???
I believe as you said that might be a problem with the grafic card it self, since eve while runing DOS I have the white dots on the screen.
Thanks, Daniel.
