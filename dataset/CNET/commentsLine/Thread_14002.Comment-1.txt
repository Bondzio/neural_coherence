i am planning to but a external hdd, i read the specification it say formatted to &quot;fat32&quot;.
i did a further research and came to know it cannot store files more than 4gb unless i convert the drive into ntfs.
i have couple of movies in hd (~5gb each).
i will be using the drive mostly with windows xp and vista systems, and occasionally with mac 1. is converting to ntfs a good idea?
2. is ntfs better then fat32?
if yes, then why the manufacturer is not selling the drive in ntfs?
3. any issues with ntfs format?
