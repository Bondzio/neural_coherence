i like to change out ram add ram, video cards, sound cards and this can't be done with an intergrated machine.
for all of you who don't really know what intergrated means..everything is built into one unit and it's not meant to be tampered with and that is why a non-intergrated machine is best, if you can afford one.
intergraded computers are more reasonably priced and you get what you pay for.
