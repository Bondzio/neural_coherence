On my computer, do I really need to enter the IP and DNS to the wireless adapter as provided by a ISP to asscess their free public wifi hotspots, or to access points of private Networks [with permission]whose ISP may or maynot be the same ISDP which provided the public wifi hotspots ?
Is it OK to leave them black ?
[The IP and DNS numbers would have been entered unto the routeers and access points to access the contents provided by the ISP and private Networks.
My computer wouod only have to have a radio link to these hotspots and accesspoiunts.
corr3ect me, if I am wrong].
Thanks.
