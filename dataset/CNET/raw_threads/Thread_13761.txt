I purchased it for the purpose of using very demanding 3d graphics and modeling programs such as 3dstudiomax, maya, rhinoceros and have come to be a little disappointed in it's ability to run these programs, both from a speed side and visual performance side. Is it possible to add RAM to this machine, change processors, or otherwise increase the performance via operating system settings?
