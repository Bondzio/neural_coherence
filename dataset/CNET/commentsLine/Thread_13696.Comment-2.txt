when the power supply ages and is near it's limits you see this.
you usually find the owner in some form of denial it can't be this since they have found workarounds that seem to get it to work again.
my tech buddies will nod and wait for it to fail totally.
this doesn't mean there are other issues such as bad caps on other boards.
but nothing weird is going on.
it's a common end of life symptom.
