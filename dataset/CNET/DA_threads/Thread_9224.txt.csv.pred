1.1.1	This is an annoying problem that has recently started to happen in our office .	St
1.1.2	The UMAX Powerlook II scanner is taking HALF A DAY to power up .	St
1.1.3	That 's 3 HOURS and it greatly impacts on our work flow .	St
1.1.4	Below are the specs of the computer and the ADAPTEC SCSI card .	St
1.1.5	Computer Specs OS Name	St
1.2.1	Am assuming that you have tried reloading the scanner software ?	Ques
1.2.2	Other peripherals work normally ?	Ques
1.2.3	Printer , etc .	St
1.2.4	If you have not , uninstall the scanner and reinstall the software .	St
1.2.5	Sounds more like a hardware issue but always try the software first , then go from there .	St
1.3.1	Yes we have tried that .	St
1.3.2	But the software does n't work when the hardware is n't detected when the computer starts .	St
1.3.3	When the computer starts the Scanner is n't even detected in the device manager .	St
1.3.4	Before last week if I hit refresh the scanner was detected and started but now nothing happens .	St
1.4.1	Sounds like hardware issue then .	St
1.4.2	Cable possibly but more than likely internal issue with scanner .	St
1.4.3	My suggestion would be to replace it with a newer USB input scanner , they are n't that expensive and are generally faster than the old SCSI hook ups .	St
1.5.1	It does seem to be a hardware issue because it 's taking half a day from the time the Power button is pushed .	St
1.5.2	This is even before I turn on the computer .	St
1.5.3	In regard to your second point getting the usb scanner might be like pulling teeth as far as my supervisor is concerned .	St
