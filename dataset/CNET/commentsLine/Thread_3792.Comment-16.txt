if you don't have ghost, it comes with norton systemworks which you should have anyway.
take a ghost image of your hard drive (makes a good backup also).
run the integrity check, and make sure you can boot into ghost and use the backup; i have to use a floppy to boot to and the cdrom image files to make it work on my system.
then use any partition manager, i used fdisk from a windows 98 startup floppy, to create your partitions.
ghost is capable of restoring the image to a partition if it's large enough to hold the data, it doesn't have to hold the free space.
