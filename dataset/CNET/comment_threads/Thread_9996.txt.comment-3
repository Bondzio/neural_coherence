This is actually a manufacturer replacement for the the first computer I ever owned (that was an older Pavilion series).
That one kept crapping out so they finally replaced it with this, &amp; everything, including the RAM, was installed by HP.
I haven't upgraded it @ all.
That aside, how do I fix this?
What will this problem effect?
Can I just disable it &amp; forget about it?
There is another device listed under storage controllers: Microsoft iSCSI Initator &amp; it's working fine.
