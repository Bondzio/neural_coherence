I disabled EIST, but i didn't find C1E.
Somehow... it performed worse on the benchmark than with it enabled.
I retested it with both settings a few times to make sure.
CPUZ Shows My proccesor at normal stats.
333x8 2.66ghz, but passmark's &quot;measured CPU speed&quot; is always on the low side (and it varies every time i open it) the only other CPU settings i could find in the BIOS are: CPU Function -&gt; Execute bit support (disabled), Set CPUID Maxval to 3 (disabled) i'm not sure what these mean but i will test them out
