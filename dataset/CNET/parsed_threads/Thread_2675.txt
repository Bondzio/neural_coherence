<s> Hi and please answer these questions I have a Dell Inspiron 530s (2009 Model) with specs of Intel 2 duo 2.53ghz, 500GB Hard Drive, 2GB of ram. </s>
<s> And I'm not sure how much ram it can hold and if it takes DDR, DRR2, DDR3, ram because i am looking at buying a 8GB of ram that is DDR3 and i want to make sure its the right kind before i buy it and the other thing is that if i can put a Intel core i7 with 3.40GHz and with a Intel HD Graphics 4000 go into the motherboard or do I need to upgrade the motherboard. </s>
<s> So please answer these questions I really need the info. </s>
<s> and the Intel core i7 has a H2 socket </s>
<s> No......you can not put 8GB of ram on that machine. </s>
<s> http://www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx?model=Inspiron%20530s&Cat=RAM No...you can not put an I7 on that mobo. </s>
<s> If you change the mobo to accept an I7 your Dell OS will no longer function. </s>
<s> That means you get to go buy a new copy of Windows. </s>
<s> Tell what you need to boost the machine to do. </s>
<s> I can see this running a few games if it had the RAM maxed out and a better video card but what you asked about the CPU, motherboard would cost as much as a new PC. </s>

<s> Hi If you upgrade your PC then it require all the changed to your motherboard & it takes more costly. </s>
<s> So i recommended to purchase a new motherboard & configure the PC in your needs. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
