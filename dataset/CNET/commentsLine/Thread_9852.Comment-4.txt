hi.
yes i can access the bios, but nothing after that, i've changed the boot order and nothing, when i said f8 i meant the splash screen w/ my hp logo and the info to press f8 at the bottom of the screen.
by the way this is an old cpu i'm setting up for my son to play games and watch movies, it's an hp vectra xe320 1.10ghz celeron.
no errors just did a fresh reboot, got everything almost set up and put disc in and shut down to boot from disc to set up cable modem and after splash screen all i get is that damn flashing cursor unless i go to bios or f8.
i think tho that when i changed the boot order and put the dvd drive first it did access that, which leads me to believe that it is the hdd.
and also my friend said that the cpu was getting slow, slower than 512 of memory would imply, like 1 or 2 programs max.
thanks for your replies folks.
