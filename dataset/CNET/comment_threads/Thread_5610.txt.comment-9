Yeah thats what I've heard about MSI, and this board is VERY reasonable @ $90.
For the Core2 I'm going to wait until the new 45nm wolfsdale comes out and either buy it or a conroe if the price is low enough.
In either case I want one that will run @ 1333 FSB.
If the 8800GT comes down enough I'll take a look at it.
