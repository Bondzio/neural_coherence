did some looking around yesterday and i still like the case so i still think i'll go that way.
but swap out the psu.
i cant remember what i was considering but some of the rosewill 450 or bigger psu's were 2.03 compatible.
i know one i was considering was antec sl450.
i think that was the main one, though looking aroudn at tigerdirect.com they had some 1.2 and 2.03 compatible psu's that were 500wt for less than an antec 450. i think tha'ts the one i was looking at.
size wise the spot for the psu and the antec psu seem to be pretty close; one's measued in in and the other in mm so i cna only approximate.
so get the case and an antec psu.
from antec's website: sl450 features: smartpower: runs cooler and quieter atx12vcompliant for compatibility with amd and intel systems dimensions: l5.9&quot; x w5.5&quot; x h3.4&quot; +5v and +3.3v combined output: 250watts max.
specs...  good one?
