1.1.1	I took my ibm thinkpad r31 apart in an unsuccessful attempt at fixing a loose dc power jack .	St
1.1.2	When I put all the parts back everything worked fine , even the unpredictable internal wifi antenna , but the trackpoint mouse is no longer shown in system devices .	St
1.1.3	The keyboard works fine and the trackpoint is all one piece with the keyboard .	St
1.1.4	I bought a wireless mouse which is recognized and works well .	St
1.1.5	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.2.1	... the trackball is connected via one of those flexi plastic film things ?	Ques
1.2.2	These are notoriously difficult to keep working as you disassemble devices .	St
1.2.3	Basically the thin platic film has small bared ends , which go into a very narrow slot ( which is the problem ) .	St
1.2.4	Then a little clip slides in which is supposed to pull it fully home , and into proper contact .	St
1.2.5	It 's easy to get it wrong , and even with it looking like it 's right , and firmly clipped in , it 's not contacting correctly .	St
1.2.6	Or maybe it 's just broken ?	Ques
1.2.7	GeeBee .	St
