I bought my original emachine in May, 2 weeks later it starts freezing up not matter when. So I take it in and 2 more weeks later they tell me my motherboard is bad and need to replace and because its still rather new they were having trouble getting a serial number for it. So they opted to exchange mine for the floor model they had there. Well everything was fine until about a week after I had it, it started freezing up , not as bad as the first machine but the fact that it does is annoying. so any help on the situation would be greatly appreciated.
