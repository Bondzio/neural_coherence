when you installed the new card in the old pc and it booted up ok, were you using the same monitor or a different one?
it's very rare that a video card and monitor have a compatibility issue (with a particular motherboard) but i have encountered such things on very rare occasions.
try a different monitor if you have one (this would be the easiest first step to trouble-shoot the problem).
if this doesn't work, check to see if your motherboard bios is the latest revision available.
if not, update and try again.
does your system bios have options for agp?
if so, make sure you select the right compatibility mode for your new configuration.
hope this helps... cindy
