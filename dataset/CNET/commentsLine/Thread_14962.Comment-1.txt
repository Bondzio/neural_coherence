i want to add a 1 gb memory module to my 256 mb dell dimension 2400.
(winxp home, sp3).
the machine supports ddr-266 (pc2100) and ddr-333 (pc2700).
i dont know which one is currently in it.
if i add a ddr-333 module will it work ok if the original module is a ddr-266?
if not, is there a way to find out what kind of memory it has?
