Want to find something on sale or with rebates and stay under $100. Dont do much if any gaming. Some video editing, videos etc. but might get back into playing a game or two someday. Windows Vista and XP, 3GB DDR2 800 MHz memory, Intel Core 2 6600 2.4 GHz. Think my weakest link is my video card and was planning on taking Radeon X1300 and putting it in my Acer upgrading the integrated graphics on that so figured I would try to step up from the X1300 to something else in my Dell. Any suggestions are appreciated.

BGF makes some lower level cards that have been overclocked at the factory that work well with higher bus speeds at that much searched for under $100. category.
