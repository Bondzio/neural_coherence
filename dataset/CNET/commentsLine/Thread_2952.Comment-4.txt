remove any &quot;extra&quot; parts.
such as one of the cd/dvd drives.
that second hard disk... and go back to the prior video card.
it can still be a glitchy power supply or motherboard.
be sure to look for domed or leaking capacitors too.
so far, nothing in your post points to any specific part.
so you get to use the old ways.
