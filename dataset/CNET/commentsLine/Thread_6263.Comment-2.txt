you can't access files on d: exactly as file on c:, because the drive-letter is different.
so you would have to go to another drive.
it's transparent if you move a folder like my documents (via its right click properties) that you don't access via a drive-letter.
but for all other files - after moving the folder - you'll notice the drive they are on is different.
but that's only a minor difference.
don't move files from - the root folder - program files - windows - other folders than my documents in your profile kees kees
