But in short you can create a wider area if you use routers as Access Points or APs.
This is the Cnet discussion forum (nothing to do with CNET routers) so you are not on a CNET ROUTER support site.
This is where people discuss things and help another.
Since you didn't give links to the manual I'll just note the usual method.
