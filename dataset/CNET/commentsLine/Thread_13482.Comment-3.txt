on top of steven reply, you need to check these areas of concern.
applying compound need not be too much.
also, the cpu surface should be 100% cleaned before application.
smear the compound out and then re-attach the hsf to it.
as explained by steven, if applied wrong or at a slight angle, etc., it may not have full contact.
any ducting is in place as it should be.
any wiring(fan or sensor) re-connected, etc..also, don't over-tighten screws as well.
since, you know its related to the previous work you did, it needs to be rechecked.
