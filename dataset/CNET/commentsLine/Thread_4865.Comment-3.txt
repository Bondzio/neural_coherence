just unplug the hd completely, not the data alone.
if the sound continues you have another problem source at least.
offhand, it sounds like a bad fan.
there are fans in the psu and check all others when starting.
if you haven't already clean out the dust bunnies and the fans as well.
depending on your wallet, if the psu fan(s) are the source of noise, you maybe better off replacing the psu as damage from lack of cooling maybe already present and thus your result.
of course any other fan failure(not turning or not 100%) will cause problems too.
if fan, replace will similar unit.
if psu, replace with higher wattage unit, cost for similar type above 300w is easily affordable, imho for generic psu.
follow your ear for noise source, open case, however don't unplug fans to test, observe.
verify, under the bios area that the hd segment has been enabled for new hd, plus be sure master/slave(jumper) or cs cabling is proper.
