enjoy the network.
sometimes the firmware can do hokey things like that.
i was losing my connection to my modem every so often for no apparent reason and no one could tell me why.
i updated the firmware and the problem got fixed.
i also set the mtu's manually to 1492 and it worked.
go figure.
as far as punching holes and stuff, it might be easy just to do it to the closest room in the upper level of your home where one of the pc's resides.
assuming that there's a phone jack in the wall, all you would have to do is absolutely nothing but plug the modem to the wall jack, power it, hok it to the router and then to the pc.
i'm also assuming that for some reason the phone company decided it would be best to wire a phone line in the attic?
(that's kinda weird to me).
if that's the case, it's very easy to run a line to the closest room on the second level where one of the pc's resides.
nonetheless, that could be a nice weekend project.
i just wouldn't feel right leaving my router in my attic where it could be exposed to whatever (including water and heat), that's just me.
