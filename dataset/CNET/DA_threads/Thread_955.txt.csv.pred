1.1.1	I have a netgear router that was the gateway to a lan of three home pcs running windows xp SP2 pro on two and one home dition SP2 .	St
1.1.2	I actually do n't know what triggered it of but one morning the xp home computer with VIA Rhine II ethernet decided it would not reconnect to my LAN .	St
1.1.3	I 've tried every thing ? ?	Ques
1.1.4	Restored , given static IP , Uninstalled and re-installed the hardware , updated drivers , run microsoft patches , changed from auto negotiate to 10T full duplex , pulled out my hair etc..	St
1.1.5	I can see my LAN as connected , but ca n't connect to the internet .	St
1.1.6	I use my usb modem to connect now , which means the other two computers are off-line .	St
1.1.7	I 've set up networks for small organizations previously , but I concede this time and need help .	St
1.1.8	I ca n't ping my router sometimes it actually does n't time out on all requests and returns between 50 to 80 % success .	St
1.1.9	If anyone out there can help I 'd be grateful .	St
1.2.1	Clean out all viruses and spyware .	St
1.2.2	Test .	St
1.2.3	Download and run WINSOCKXPFIX.EXE on that computer .	St
1.2.4	Test .	St
1.2.5	Try a different network cable .	St
1.2.6	Try a different network adapter .	St
1.3.1	tried every thing but a new adapter !	St
1.3.2	was hoping i wouldnt have to replace this but i 'm quite sure it would work if i did cos many people ok a few have had issues with the VIA rhine and say they could connect after reducing to 10 full duplex speed .	St
1.3.3	but sadly that did n't work for me either !	St
1.3.4	I do givw network support to a couple of small companies but this is the first time i have conceded defeat and opted to change a component !	St
