Make sure you take Michael's advice and call your ISP.
Usually shaky Internet service is a problem on the ISP end (a bad server/blade/bank).
On more than one occasion over the years, the ISP has replaced my modem because its firmware just can't get the job done.
DHCP: Make sure you have only one DHCP server enabled.
If your modem is a combo device (modem-router), try keeping its DHCP server enabled, but disable the DHCP server on the other router.
If using wireless, try changing the router/access point to a different channel to avoid interference.
(Try channels 1, 6, or 11 in the USA and Canada).
Spyware scans with at least 2 programs on each computer may reveal a culprit.
