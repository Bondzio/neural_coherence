1.1.1	Iomega blames OSX for the problem I have.	St
1.1.2	I bought an Iomega Floppy Plus drive in case I needed access to the old floppies I made on my now-discarded G3 (OS 8.6-9.2).	St
1.1.3	The problem is that the new drive will recognize only about 1/10th of my old disks.	St
1.1.4	Iomega suggests I find a computer with OS 9.2 and &quot;update&quot; the disks somehow(!	St
1.1.5	), a solution not within my reach.	St
1.1.6	I recall a similar problem with earlier iMacs and underpowered drives.	St
1.1.7	Seems the ones powered with 110 AC read many more disks than the ones powered through the USB port.	St
1.1.8	The drive mounts when I put a new disk in and will reformat if I ask it to, it just won't read the old disks.	St
1.1.9	Is there anything I can do to get my new drive to behave?	Ques
1.1.10	I own an eMac 1.25 Ghz, with 512 RAM, running on OS 10.3.9.	St
1.2.1	The disk contents had to be transferred again.	St
1.2.2	That is...	St
1.2.3	I grabbed a pile of disks formatted on the new drive.	St
1.2.4	Ran to an old machine that could read the old disks and copied the files to the new disks.	St
1.2.5	I know of no other cure.	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	Everyone likes to blame everyone else but this is a common problem with floppy drives and floppy disks.	St
1.3.2	I had the same problem, until I decided that none of the disks that I had were important and that most of the stuff on them would not run under OS X. I have not used a floppy disk for over 6 years, on my Mac.	St
1.3.3	My fix was to take my bundle of disks to a friend, with a beige G3 and a CD burner.	St
1.3.4	All the floppies I thought I would want were then transferred to a CD.	St
1.3.5	This CD has never been used!	St
1.3.6	Apart from the suggestion from Bob, this is the best I have right now.	St
1.3.7	Floppies tend to deteriorate at a rate that is directly proportional to the length of time they have not been used.	St
1.3.8	P	St
