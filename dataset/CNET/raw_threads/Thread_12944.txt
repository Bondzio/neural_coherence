Your choice of external enclosure will depend on your answer. Either way, the connection of choice for the Mac is Firewire but USB 2.0 will do at a pinch. (It's not as fast.) (Yes, I know that 480 is faster than 400 but when it comes to the crunch, USB 2.0 is slower overall) So, a Firewire enclosure that is capable of supporting the type of connection, data and power, that the HD requires.
