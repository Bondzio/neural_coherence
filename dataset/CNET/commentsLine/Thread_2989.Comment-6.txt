1. the motherboard.
2. the power supply.
the psu seems to escape some why that matters.
i offer it from my experience of too many years in the repair biz.
a &quot;cheap&quot; test is to remove any optional gear.
anything on usb and try again.
for the cmos to hold its content it's just three parts.
the psu does matter as when they get old i've seen the noise on the supply lines corrupt the cmos settings.
cheaper than a new board so that's why we always try it.
