Anyone have any suggestions for third party web sites offering tech support on Adobe (fka Macromedia) Flash Player?
Adobe/Macromedia support is non-existant and Flash Player no longer works on my PC.
All I have are blacked out boxes where flash content should be playing and Internet Explorer's manage add-ons indicates the Flash Player active-x control is enabled.
I have recently gotten rid of Norton Systemworks and a combo Pop-up/Ad Blocker software and have searched and removed possible kill-bit entries in the registry, all to no avail.
Any suggestions appreciated.
