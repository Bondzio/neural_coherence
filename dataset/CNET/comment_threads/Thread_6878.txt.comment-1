Last night I upgraded the firmware on the CD-RW/DVD combo drive and now the computer doesn't recognize it.
Its dead.
I have a Samsung SM-332B combo drive.
The old firmware version was T-408 (from Dell).
I downloaded and installed version T-406 from the Samsung website.
Kaput.
I did a system restore to the previous day with no luck.
How do I get back or get a copy of the old firmware?
It's an older Dell Dimension running XP SP2.
Hey, at least I took some notes.
Thanks
