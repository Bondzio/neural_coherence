1.1.1	Mk so many problems here ...	St
1.1.2	I recently got a HP G71 laptop from a friend who said thatit would not start up correctly and the Bootmgr was broken .	St
1.1.3	Well , in my attempt to fix it I found that the D : drive was also 'missing ' .	St
1.1.4	So as I tried to fix bootmgr using a windows 7 repair disc and going through that crap I eventually found that the bootmgr cant be fixed till the hard drive is .	St
1.1.5	So , I ran this thing where it says at the top 'Checking Disk Local Disk ( D : ) ' and I knew there was bad clusters so I checked the thing about attempt to clean up bad clusters .	St
1.1.6	So far this checking disk thing has been going on for almost 3 days .	St
1.1.7	and its at about 60 % progress..	St
1.1.8	I would also like to wipe everything off the laptop before I give it to my girlfriend that way she pretty much has a fresh start and not a ton of crap .	St
1.1.9	My questions are.. Is it supposed to take this long ?	Ques
1.1.10	Am I on the right path ?	Ques
1.1.11	& gt ; If I 'm no , t how do I fix this ?	Ques
1.1.12	Will doing all this wipe my Hard-Drive like I want ?	Ques
1.1.13	Any questions I will answer to the best of my abilities	St
1.2.1	My first thought , if I 'd gotten such a laptop , would be to do a factory re-installation of the system so I 'd have some starting point .	St
1.2.2	If the restore partition was still good and accessible , this would be a good thing to try .	St
1.2.3	Unfortunately , I do n't know the keystrokes to attempt this but you could check the HP web site for instructions .	St
1.2.4	It may be that the restore partition is gone or damaged and you can not fix this without the proper media .	St
1.2.5	I would wonder , as well , if the issue could have occurred by the laptop being dropped and the HD suffering physical damage .	St
1.2.6	In that case , you 'd need a new drive .	St
1.2.7	You could try to pull the drive to see who manufactured it , go to their web site and find their diagnostics disk to check the drive .	Sug
1.2.8	You 'd need to make bootable media to do so .	St
1.2.9	If the drive is good but you 've no way to rebuild the system due to lack of proper disks , you go to HP and ask to purchase them if available .	St
1.2.10	That 's about all I can offer as there 's no known history to give a hint as to what the problem could have been caused by .	St
1.3.1	Did you try using the restore media for this PC ?	Ques
1.4.1	Idk how I would do the media thing.. but when I tried to do all the restore points and everything I was not able to .	St
1.4.2	It was all because the hard drive was 'missing ' and when I would look at the hard drive in some windows it would n't show the amount of memory it had and when I opened it , it would have no files in it .	St
1.4.3	so I ended up popping off the back to make sure it was secure .	St
1.4.4	And as far as the history of the damage .	St
1.4.5	Apparently this was my friend 's friend 's computer .	St
1.4.6	And she one day got pissed off and threw it to the ground and punched it .	St
1.4.7	Then when she started the computer it started with the whole broken bootmgr .	St
1.5.1	If this is true , I 'd say you not only need a new laptop but maybe some new friends .	St
1.5.2	I 'd not put a dime into it .	St
1.5.3	If the screen is n't damaged , maybe you can ebay it for parts .	St
1.6.1	Well , my friends are fine xD its my friends of friends that are a little outgoing and brutal =P yeah , she beat the crap out of it then when she started it up she apparently said & quot ; I think it got a virus & quot ; with all serious-ness too .	St
1.6.2	I could n't help but laugh .	St
1.6.3	Anyways , I just received the laptop for free and if I could fix it I still get to keep it .	St
1.6.4	Soooo , lets say that the hard drive is able to work it just is n't .	St
1.6.5	How would I go about fixing it in its current state .	St
1.6.6	It is still doing the Checking Disk thing where it says XXXXXXX free clusters processed .	St
1.6.7	Would this clean up all the bad clusters ?	Ques
1.6.8	Then after this what would I do to continue fixing it to eventually get it in working order ?	Ques
1.7.1	You need the recovery/restore discs for that model # laptop .	St
1.7.2	-OR- an install OS disc that 's from retail sources .	St
1.7.3	You can order a replacement disc from HP provided it is still available in wares for some cost .	St
1.7.4	This cost is usually less than store brought .	St
1.7.5	I suggest you query for those disc ( s ) in order to attempt a reload of the OS .	St
1.7.6	You can contact HP for details via the HP support website , look for replacement discs .	Ques
1.7.7	With all the problems you have , then that 's the way to go provided you have a display on the screen .	St
1.7.8	Of course , contact your friend and see what discs they have available .	St
1.7.9	Beware , though there maybe a possibility the HD is actually bad which is either part of multiple problems or the source of .	St
1.7.10	No matter you need those disc ( s ) .	St
1.7.11	A quick test is to get the Ubuntu & quot ; LiveCD & quot ; version , burn to disc using the .ISO file .	St
1.7.12	Once done it should be bootable , place in drive and reboot .	St
1.7.13	That way , you do some testing and accessing to see what if anything is wrong .	St
1.7.14	That is a freebie OS and works on many laptops .	St
1.7.15	good luck tada -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.8.1	program .	St
1.8.2	These can be downloaded as an image and burned to floppy or CD .	St
1.8.3	They 'll tell you if the HD is good or not .	St
1.8.4	If not , you need to get a new HD to make it work .	St
1.8.5	As Willy said , a live Linux disk could be of value as it can check your other hardware for functionality .	St
1.8.6	It ca n't do much in the way of hard drive diagnostics though .	St
1.9.1	But the check finally finished ... Yep the hard drive is screwed .	St
1.9.2	Lol , my girlfriend isnt too happy about it .	St
1.9.3	Know anyone wanting to buy laptop parts ?	Ques
1.9.4	xD	St
