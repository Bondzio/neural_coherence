thanks for the input here, but once again i think i'm getting things all confused.. i was told awhile ago that if my system has 'integrated' video; well, that's it.
there's no where else to go.
if i understand what your saying, i can add a graphics card to my system?
wow, that would be great; but, how would i know what kind to buy for a system so old?
sorry for the denseness here, but like i stated earlier, i'm not good at mixing/matching things on computer systems... thanks!
