I was wondering if something like this exists: I use Google Talk to talk to people around the US and overseas, using a USB headset which I absolutely love. I would like to be able to go wireless with it. I know I could do something with Bluetooth, but the range is pretty limited (30 feet max, under great, line-of-sight conditions). I would prefer to go further (a couple of hundred feet would be nice) and for the signal to be able to pass through walls, just like a regular cordless phone. I was wondering if I could carry a small transmitter/receiver that I plug the headset into, and also have a transmitter/receiver (not necessarily small) plugged into a USB port on my computer. Please let me know if there's a solution to this. Thank you very much, Colin
