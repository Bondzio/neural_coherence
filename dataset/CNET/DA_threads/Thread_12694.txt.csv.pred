1.1.1	I have PC with configuration of Pantium D processor and 512 MB RAM.It was working fine until i replace 512 RAM with 1 GB RAM.	St
1.1.2	Now mkv video or any high quality video is not playing continuously and CPU used is more than 90%.	St
1.1.3	Even if i switched back to 512 MB RAM , Problem is there.	St
1.1.4	Could anybody suggest anything please?	Ques
1.2.1	Go into taskmanager and tell us the top-5-processes after sorting on CPU usage.	St
1.2.2	Also tell about your graphic card.	Sug
1.2.3	Kees	St
1.3.1	That makes me wonder if there is TORRENT software or other VIDEO PLAYERS that came from a TORRENT on this machine.	St
1.3.2	I'm losing count how often a machine gets slammed when the owners begin to use torrents.	St
1.3.3	Bob	St
1.4.1	System Idle Process explorer.exe firefox.exe utorrent.exe system Graphics Memory is 96 MB.	St
1.5.1	about torrents.	St
1.5.2	And it's a pity you didn't tell the percentage of each process.	Polite
1.5.3	Normally, system idle (the system doing nothing) should be above 80% if all you do is looking video, I think.	St
1.5.4	The video program shouldn't need more than 20%.	St
1.5.5	But I don't see any video viewing program in the list.	St
1.5.6	Remarkable: with system idle on top of the list it's nearly impossible that the CPU is being used for more than 90% by other processes.	St
1.5.7	That leaves less than 10% for system idle, and it's hardly imaginable it's on the top of the list than.	St
1.5.8	Maybe tell more?	Sug
1.5.9	What I should do: - switch the hard disk you're reading the video-file from from DMA to PIO mode, reboot, switch it back again to DMA-mode and reboot again.	St
1.5.10	That's done in Device Manager.	St
1.5.11	If that doesn't help: - clean install of the OS - try again to view a video you already have on your harddisk (copy it to USB-stick first, because the clean install will format the hard disk); disconnect from Internet until then - stay away from torrents in the future Kees	St
1.6.1	have been infected using UTORRENT, here is a great program for scanning and cleaning your computer http://download.cnet.com/SuperAntiSpyware-Free-Edition/3000-8022_4-10523889.html?tag=mncol Or if you discover you have a specific infection running on your computer, check out the forums on this (reputable) website: http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/forum55.html	St
1.7.1	Sure enough they are running a torrent at the time of the troubles.	St
1.7.2	I'm unsure why you are replying to me about this.	Ques
1.7.3	Bob	St
