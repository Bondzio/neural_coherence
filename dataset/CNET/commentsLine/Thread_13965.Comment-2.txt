i am not able to locate my external benq cd rewriter as a drive in &quot;my computer&quot; after properly installing it.
what i mean is that when i connect the the device through my usb 2.0 port the computer detects that a new hardware( usb 2.0 mass storage device...disk drive) is found and it says it is ready for use but when i look for it in my comp.
with the other drives i could not find it.
so please tell me what to do.
the operating system am using is windows xp
