I'm having the same problem, except I don't use sleep mode, it's just when I boot it up.
I've found out a few things about it: one, if I reseat everything it stops having the issue, but that's temporary and it will soon start doing it again more frequently, and two, when I kick it right after I boot it it has a better chance of starting up, but I really don't like doing that because it's potentially harmful to the hardware.
Even so, this tells me something is seated incorrectly or loosely, but if that's the case I can't figure out what it is because I've gone through every connection on the board, a few times each, and they all seem to be fine.
I can't send it to be repaired because it's a custom, but right now I'm pretty stumped and I can't find any help, and this is the first thread I've come across which has the problem I'm having.
Please, if anyone knows how to fix this, share.
Thank you.
