Sometimes it completes the startup and is on for a few minutes before it shuts down. Other times it starts shutting down before the startup is complete. What's really bizarre is that it also started coming on by itself after being off for several days. They had to unplug it to get it to stop booting up in the middle of the night. Anyone ever seen this problem before?

Verify all bios setting and save regardless, if change or not before exiting. Next, I strongly believe the PSU/power supply is going kaput. It has been compromised in some way and basically only a replacement will do. If there is no surge protection, get some as possible outside AC line glitches can reek havoc on a pc's psu. Going on/off suggest a psu problem but as a bios offering wake-up can do the same on a remote level. Power spikes/surges, or lulls can be at fault too, so if experienced look for electrical pros to handle that side if need be. I've seen these types of problems due to various causes and nothing can be taken for granted and its a hit-or-miss fix sometimes. good luck tada -----Willy
