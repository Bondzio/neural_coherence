when i bought my hp computer they tried to get me to buy their extended warranty.
the techs at circuit city advised against it and said it's a total joke if anything goes wrong in the warrany period to get it repaired.
their advise was buy the extended warranty from where you purchised the computer, that way if something does go wrong you can go face to face with who you bought it from and they speak english so you can understand them instead of the gibberish you get when you call hp tech support.
i didn't buy from either which was lucky as circuit city is now out of business.
anything with hp anymore is &quot;we got your money so don't bother us&quot; i have had a hp printer problem and it's compatibility problem with vista for the past 2 years and they refuse to do anything about it even though it is a known issue with me and thousands of others.
i finally bought a kodak printer that worked right out of the box and gave my hp printer to my grand kids who's computer has xp, problem solved.
