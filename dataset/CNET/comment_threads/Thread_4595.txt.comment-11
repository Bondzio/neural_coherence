Right, I'll buy the new PSU and test it with my GT220, and if the fan still doesn't work I'll see how the 3650 runs.
I'm in need of an update anyway so I'll start saving for a new card at some point.
If this doesn't improve my FPS dropping I have no clue what will.
As some of you may have gathered I'm a bit of a novice when it comes to this sort of thing :P
