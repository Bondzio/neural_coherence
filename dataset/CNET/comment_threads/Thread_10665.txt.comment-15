I believe the motherboard for my current laptop can handle up to two gigs of RAM.
I can assume there are two slots, and both are filled with one gig memory.
It's a shame 'cause I'd want to upgrade my RAM to four, but looks like I can't.
As for your suggestions about big numbers, yeah I understand that.
I just didn't understand the memory deal.
I appreciate your responses!
