you would check at  and see if they have a newer bios and then see if that helped.
there are companies like  but you may be not happy since such booting is not only an issue in the initial boot, but if the os in question is coded to work in such an environment.
windows 95 being a prime example of only working off the primary ide master drive and just coughing up errors when the drive was moved to another connection and the primary ide left empty.
maybe you don't need or want a pc?
pcs are commodity items built for the millions with some limitations on what they do.
maybe some embedded card with an os you wrote would work?
look up linux from scratch as an example.
