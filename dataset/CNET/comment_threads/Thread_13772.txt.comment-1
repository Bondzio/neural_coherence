I got a very weird problem with my daily use machine...it is shutting itself down every 5 minutes...almost on the dot.
It isn't temps, last shut down was 36C on CPU...very cooled off.
I don't know what is doing it, it's not overclocked, I pulled all things that I wouldn't normally use (like my uneeded 56K modem, cold cathode lights) Ideas to get it work?
AMD AthlonXP 2600+ DFI LanParty KT400A 400W PSU ATI Radeon 9600Pro 1.5GB DDR RAM 80GB HDD SB Audigy 2 ZS Plat.
(w/front drive) Flopyy drive 4 case fans 56x CD-ROM 16x DVD-ROM any thing else you want to know?
I am safe from crashes right now...since I am using my other computer (not a system I like BTW)
