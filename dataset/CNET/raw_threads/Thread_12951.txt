Proffitt	9/22/07 10:49 AM	1.19045814E12	Tell more.	http://support.packardbell.org/uk/item/index.php?i=spec_quasar shows the AGP slot which is the usual 2/4/8X slot that your 7300 appears to be ok with. I used this link for the 7300 -&gt; Figure 3 of http://www.pny.com/support/verto/vertoinstallationguide.pdf It seems like the slots match to me. Bob

Should be able to find a 256MB AGP Video Card at Newegg.com. By all means ....double check all of this before proceeding. VAPCMD

Start here.... http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=2010380048+1069609639+1068309611&Configurator=&Subcategory=48&description=&Ntk=&srchInDesc= and decide which card(s) you like based on the specs, the user reviews, your budget, etc., and then go to http://www.tomshardware.com At Tomshardware.com you can compare how these cards perform on some of the same games. From there...well, that's up to you but I don't ever buy my hardware at eBay. It's hard to be sure you end up getting what you thought you bought. Not so with a good internet vendor like Newegg.
