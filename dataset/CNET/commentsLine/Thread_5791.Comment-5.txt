good luck getting any help with netgear's 3rd world support people or the &quot;slim&quot; documention that comes with their products.
that said, i got my netgear system up and running in 2 days mostly by myself.
i'm not familar with the usb wireless unit that you're using with your laptop.
i'm running the wg511 pc card and it works fine.
perhaps you should go that route instead.
