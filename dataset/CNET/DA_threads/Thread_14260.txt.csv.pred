1.1.1	I am currently running on an outdated Intel Celeron 1.7Ghz with 533Mhz FSB and no real graphic to speak of.	St
1.1.2	1GM DDR2 RAM 80GB HD(5400rpm).	St
1.1.3	As you can imagine, it is slowly slowing...	St
1.1.4	I am looking for a new (laptop) computer to do the following: -Do school work in Web Development -Photoshop (mostly web graphics and amateur photography editing) -YouTube video editing (rarely DVD) -Occasional browser-based games and what not -Want to stream web-based TV to my HDTV periodically OK, now the real question.	St
1.1.5	I have a moderate understanding of computer specs, but not sure how they really translate into day-to-day use.	St
1.1.6	I am currently looking at a few laptops by HP and can list specs, but really just need some practical advice here.	St
1.1.7	Do I need a &quot;Core2 Duo, 512 GPU, 3G DDR2&quot; type setup, or a &quot;Core i7, 1GB GPU, 4GB DDR3&quot; type setup?	St
1.1.8	I understand some of the technical differences, just not sure how they would really translate into working performance.	St
1.1.9	I can also select from a few AMD processors(turion ii X2 for instance).	St
1.1.10	Thanks so much, I have spent hours researching and just can't come up with solid in-life advice.	St
1.2.1	Do I need a &quot;Core2 Duo, 512 GPU, 3G DDR2&quot; type setup, or a &quot;Core i7, 1GB GPU, 4GB DDR3&quot; type setup?	St
1.2.2	Either are nice but I'd stick to the 4GB machines since you move solidly into the 64 bit wave and won't feel left behind.	St
1.2.3	The memory on the GPU is all about gaming.	St
1.2.4	So no real gain for your listed uses.	St
1.2.5	I am using something along the first model (C2D w/4GB DDR3) and it's nice.	St
1.2.6	But will shop for a quad desktop later this year.	St
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks Bob.	St
1.3.2	Gaming really isn't my thing.	St
1.3.3	Does Photoshop process through the GPU or CPU, mostly (I haven't found a solid answer online)?	St
1.3.4	Do you think (for my uses) that it is worth the extra $200ish for quad-core?	St
1.3.5	Quad would also automatically give me the larger GPU.	St
1.3.6	Sorry for so volume of questions, I simply want to understand.	St
1.3.7	This question going to anybody BTW.	St
1.4.1	CPU.	St
1.4.2	There is some nugget that posts about GPU processing but for photoshop, for the rest of us it's the CPU.	St
1.4.3	After all this, I ordered a quad core unit just minutes ago.	St
1.4.4	But back to you.	St
1.4.5	To let photoshop stretch its legs, go 4GB and 64 bit.	Sug
1.4.6	200 may be about right, but where are you shopping?	St
1.4.7	For example this 8GB monster at http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883108209 while it's on Vista seems to be a deal I would have considered.	St
1.4.8	We still have 2 more Windows 7 updrades left.	St
1.4.9	Bob	St
1.5.1	Thanks again Bob, Well I was hoping to use my student status as an advantage and get an edu discount from HP.	St
1.5.2	They offer the best discount that I can find.	Polite
1.5.3	i was looking at the DV6T which comes in C2D or i7 (and AMD).	St
1.5.4	There are several quick-ship models as well as customized models which allow me to tweak with the specs a little.	St
1.5.5	Your link seems to point to a desktop.	St
1.5.6	I am really looking for a laptop.	St
1.5.7	As for the prices, they are $705 for C2D (with a faster FSB and 4GB RAM (no GPU)) and $915 for i7 (4GB, 1333mhz, 1GB GPU).	St
1.5.8	I just couldn't find cheaper.	St
1.5.9	Add on wireless-n, 12 cell battery and a few customizations and its like $1,045.	St
1.5.10	-Jared	St
1.6.1	Forgot the AMD model.	St
1.6.2	It is the same system but AMD Turion II Ultra Dual-Core M620 Mobile Processor (2.5GHz) 6144MB DDR2 memory For $911	St
1.7.1	I went with the HP DV6-1361SB fro 799 at Newegg.	St
1.7.2	http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?Item=N82E16834157045 That's what I'm on today.	St
1.7.3	Fairly fast and my only quibble is the keyboard is a little slick.	St
1.7.4	Bob	St
1.8.1	There is also a 14.1&quot; Intel i5 ($779) which has a way faster clock speed, but no threading like the i7.	St
1.8.2	I am so confused.	St
1.8.3	: ) Thanks for clearing me up on the GPU.	St
1.8.4	Not having one will save me a good $50-$100.	St
1.9.1	Nice system.	St
1.9.2	Exactly like one of the ones I was looking at.	St
1.10.1	The i5 is almost the rebadge of the Core 2 Duo line.	St
1.10.2	If we are to compare models, name names or give up links.	St
1.10.3	Here's the killer Best Buy exclusive -&gt; http://ces.cnet.com/8301-31045_1-10429305-269.html Almost good enough to consider but not to displace what I use today.	St
1.10.4	Bob	St
