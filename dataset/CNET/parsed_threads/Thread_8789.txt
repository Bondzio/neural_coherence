<s> I'm a senior getting ready for college next year. </s>
<s> A little early, I know. </s>
<s> But this is the last Christmas before college. </s>
<s> Anyway, I have asked for a netbook (Dell Mini 10v). </s>
<s> However, I am torn between whether I should get the netbook or the money for it. </s>
<s> I plan on getting a Macbook before college and hopefully Apple will have a back to school deal. </s>
<s> I just dont know if it would be worth it. </s>
<s> My gut is it would, but I dont have both yet, so I cant be sure. </s>
<s> Anyone have both a netbook and normal sized comp in a college environment? </s>
<s> What are you thoughts? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I have your average laptop and use the netbook for presentations and quick trips out of the office. </s>
<s> I find it nice to have a machine that I don't have a big investment in. </s>
<s> But frankly if I had a 13 inch macbook I think I'd not need the netbook. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> If I were you I would hold off on the netbook and put that money towards a laptop. </s>
<s> Using some simple reasoning I'm guessing by next school year you will have around $1,400 to spend, which could get you a laptop that will not only be easy to take to class, but also powerful enough to do everything you need well. </s>
