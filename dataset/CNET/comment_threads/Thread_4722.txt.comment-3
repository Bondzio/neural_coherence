It may be I need higher wattage.
That APA10US is 70 watts.
But definitly I'll probably go with a toshiba adaptor this time.
It's too bad though because I wish I didn't have to change out my adaptors so much.
Maybe it's my computer's battery?
Or is there a proper proceedure of plugging an adaptor in that I don't know of.
Perhaps I should have always pluged in the adaptor first to my laptop THEN to the outlet?
Thanks for the help.
