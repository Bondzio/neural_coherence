It is not fine without the router.
If I plug directly into the cable modem it has the same problem.
Could it be some kind of DNS problem?
I know I'm not very knowledgable about these things so I apologize if that is a silly question, but when the connection craps out, it seems like it sees the site (if I'm in a browser) but can't manage to resolve it.
It's like it gets tired of doing stuff for me so it takes a break and then it's fine again.
