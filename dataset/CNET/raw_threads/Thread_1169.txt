9492	5	161725	1793710	1793544	Ray Harinec	3/7/06 3:35 PM	1.1417457E12	Please explain your statements	&quot;&quot;pc wont come on light on the front does but then nothing, have changed the psu aswell and still nothing dont even hear the fan starting &quot;&quot; What light comes on?? The Power LED?? If so that means that you have 5 volts at least. Are symptoms before changing PSU identical or did some of them change??? What fan is it that you don't hear starting?? Was the second PSU a new unit of same or higher wattage, or an old one that you had laying around?? Do you know how to turn the PSU by itself?

The memory sticks [or stick] should have been one of the items. The memory sticks are held in by a plastic tab at each end of the stick. One lifts up the tabs which then allows the memory stick to be unplugged. Just remove them and plug them back in FIRMLY and then lock the tabs down again. Did you replug the video card in?? If you want to test the power supply by itself [probably not needed if you tried two different ones], plug it in to a wall outlet [a hot one LOL] and with the supply connectors not plugged into the computer. On the 20 pin [24 pin on newer computers]connector find the green wire, use a small piece of wire to connect the green wire to any one of the black wires. As long as the connection is made the supply will turn on and stay on as noted by its fan rotating. The Molex connectors are a sloppy fit so with a fine piece of wire one can usually make the connection from the rear of the connector. It is simply a logic connection so there is no voltage that you can feel.

The newer mobos provide power to the CPU via the 12 volt line [at one time they used the 5 volt line]. If you have the 5 volts and no fans or anything running you then have no 12 volts, which depending on your computer mobo may mean that the CPU also doesn't get power. For this to happen on two power supplies is hard to understand for me, although in the last month or so in these forums I have seen others with that problem. Wonder if they were all eMachines. Normally if the CPU were shorted and overloaded the supply, all the main voltages would shut down automatically. Possibly your power supply only shuts down the voltage main that is overloaded. I don't think that I can offer much help. At this point AFTER you go back and make certain that you replug everything in, the only thing left is remove/replace trouble shooting. Doesn't sound too good for the CPU. Good luck. You wouldn't be the first in these forums that found the PC suddenly working after rechecking all connections for the third time.
