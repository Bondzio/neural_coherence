i have been looking for an answer to this exact problem.
i have freeagent pro 320gb drive and haven't been able to get a sata connection working.
like the rest here i could get a usb connection no trouble.
i also purchased 2 different esata port pci cards and could not seem to get them working.
i stumbled across this forum and saw that it was a cable connect problem for some of you.
when i plugged my drive in, the cable felt like it was connecting but after reading this post and apply some addtional pressure to my cable.
bam it works.
just wanted to say thanks.
