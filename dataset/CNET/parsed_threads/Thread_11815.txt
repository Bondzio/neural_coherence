<s> I have some christmas money burning a hole in pocket so I figure it might be a good time to upgrade my computer a bit. </s>
<s> I'm by no means a hardcore gamer, but I would like to have my system ready for Starcraft 2 and Diablo 3 (if and when blizzard ever releases them). </s>
<s> I'm looking to possibly upgrade either my graphics card or my ram, possibly both. </s>
<s> Here are some of my current hardware specs. </s>
<s> Board: DFI Corp,LTD LP UT NF590 SLI 1.0 2.10 gigahertz AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core NVIDIA GeForce 7600 GS Ram wise, I have 2 1024 MB sticks, with 2 open slots. </s>
<s> Ideally I'd like to bump up my graphics card a bit and jump up to 4gigs of ram. </s>
<s> My knowledge of hardware issues has always been pretty lacking compared to what I know about software and I haven't been paying attention to what is available on the market right now, so any suggestions of how to best optimize my current system would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Somewhere around 300ish, hopefully no more than 500. </s>
<s> I'd go to Tom's Hardware and see the options for GPUs at various price points .. link below. </s>
<s> Just make sure you pick a GPU that doesn't require more power than your current PSU can deliver ... otherwise you'll end up having to buy a more robust PSU too. </s>

<s> Keep in mind the GPU could be used in a newer PC if desired whereas DDR2 is an older technology and not likely of use in a newer PC. </s>
<s> Let us know how it works out. </s>
