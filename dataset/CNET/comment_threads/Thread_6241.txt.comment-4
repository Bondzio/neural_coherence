I've downloaded Windowsxpfix, but I'm extremely reluctant to start messing around with registry files with an unsupported utility, I don't know enough about it, call it regeditophobia.
I especially don't want to mess up a friend's computer.
This whole problem started wiht the uninstall of McAfee so what I'd like to try first is to remove any McAfee registry entries or other files that uninstall may have left hanging around.
I think it was the 2004 McAfee Antivirus.
Can anyone tell me what I need to look for?
