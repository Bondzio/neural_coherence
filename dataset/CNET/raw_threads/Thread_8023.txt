Sometimes the programs I need to run analysis only comes in a Windows version. I deal with stats, data mining, a little SQL type stuff. I even need the Windows Excel due to add-ins, etc. My data is rarely over 10GB. Most is far less than that. Here is my question- I am better off running a virtualization side on my Mac (ie Parellels) or to buy a Windows desktop/server, load the Windows programs into it and then remote desktop in from my Mac. Thus I am running the analysis process on the Windows machine. Upsides and downsides? Comments? Thanks

And here's a trick I use and want to share. Let's say I want to use another machine. I copy my virtual box file over to that other machine and launch that virtual box machine without having to reinstall the windows in that virtual box. It's pretty amazing stuff. Bob

I decided against using virtualizing on my Mac. Anyway, to remote in I use NoMachine for Windows and Mac. I have to say for me it works like a charm.
