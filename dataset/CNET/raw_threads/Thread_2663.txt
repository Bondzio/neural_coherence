I think I have tried jpgs and they didn't work either so the file extension should be irrelevant but there you go just in case. It's a couple of weddings so they are huge files. Here's what I've tried: *I put each folder on my external hard drive, 14G worth. When I am done I see that the images transferred fine and my hard drive is 14G fuller now. I hand that over to the Mac person and he says the folders are empty when trying to view from his computer. *Then I got his external hard drive and ended up with the exact same result. His drive was 14G fuller and everything. * I have burned discs for him and they come up empty as well What do I need to do? Please help!

Have them install NTFS support or have them format the drive on their machine and use a Linux boot CD to copy files to their Apple formatted drive. We discuss the Linux boot CD at the top of the forum. It is not sarcastic but stating that you might have to upgrade that person. Bob
