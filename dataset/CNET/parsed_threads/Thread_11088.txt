<s> My GTX480 has recently passed on ( Rip ). </s>
<s> However, I need to get my PC up and running pretty soon. </s>
<s> I don't really need an upgrade but I need something able to run at the same speeds or better than that of the 480. </s>
<s> I do game and do some rendering. </s>
<s> The catch: I need it for 200 or less. </s>
<s> Any help is appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Is that 200 will get something far better IMO. </s>
<s> Stick to this list in a link to follow. </s>

<s> From what I gathered there for 200 dollars a HD 7950 ( This coming from a NVIDIA fanboy ) is the best bang for my buck for what I'm doing. </s>

<s> but its a few more $$. </s>

<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I doubt your going to get any better than that card at the 200 buck area. </s>
<s> Looks like equal to or slightly better than the 480. </s>
<s> If you have more bucks then the mix changes. </s>
