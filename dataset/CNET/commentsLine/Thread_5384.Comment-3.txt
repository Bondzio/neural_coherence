i have a 5200 and stepping through the setting, it doesn't show on mine.
but, it should support a lesser value at max.
(mine) of 1280x1024.
there are various vendors using the fx5200 series chipset but it should be very similar outputs.
in short its not a good marriage but *may* work as to what you hdtv range will allow.
