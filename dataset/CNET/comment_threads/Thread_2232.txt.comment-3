I recently bougth this DVD/RW, but the problem is that I can't hear the sound of some DVDs, for instance I got the VH1 Divas Live 1998, and it comes with 2 music tracks, I can hear one of then but the other one is mute, the tracks are (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo), (Dolby Digital 5.1).
Why can I hear just one of them?
What should I do in order to hear both tracks?
