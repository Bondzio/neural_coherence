<s> Just got a brand new HP pavilian dv5 notebook. </s>
<s> everything is fine. </s>
<s> except I can hear clock ticking sound from hard drive constantly. </s>
<s> it is not exactly one second per click, but very similar. </s>
<s> when hard drive is working hard, it makes normal sound. </s>
<s> when it is kind of idle, it is ticking. </s>
<s> is this normal? </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> I take it back. </s>
<s> I thought when hard drive is working, there is no ticking sound. </s>
<s> but I was wrong, i think it is still there, just that normal busy sound of hard drive seems overpowered that ticking sound. </s>
<s> and see if the sound is there. </s>
<s> If not, continue to boot into safe mode and take a second listen. </s>
<s> If the sound is only heard when Windows fully loads, it's a background process accessing the hard drive. </s>
<s> What process that is may not be simple to find. </s>
<s> These aren't unusual. </s>
<s> Your computer just doesn't always sit there and wait for you to input something. </s>
<s> It does stuff on it's own. </s>
