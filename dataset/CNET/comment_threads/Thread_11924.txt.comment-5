Gee Mingo, I didn't mean to hit a nerve here!
I know the card is old but I have Dim 4400 that is almost that old and that card was supposed to be good in it's day.
I don't do games and I can't swing a new computer right now but my current video card is a Rage 128 with a whole 16mb of memory.
All I want is a card that will update my video without causing a power supply crash.
There isn't much to choose from with AGP 2X.
Is the X1650XT an ATI card?
I also head a GEFORCE FX5500 will also work in my 4400.
Any help is appreciated.
