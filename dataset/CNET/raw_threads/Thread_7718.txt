Windows Media Center doesn't manually scan for all the signal on the cable. I know that the cable does have HD signals because my TV/HD scanned and pick up all the free HD signals. Does anybody know how I can get the most out of my TV tuner card?

Without it, you won't be able to get any of the clear/free HD channels from your cable company. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAM_tuner

I searched through all the the &quot;QAM&quot; or whatnot, and I'm able to view a handful of HD broadcasts by connecting my cable to the ATSC input, having installed the proper updates. My problem isnt that I cant view the beautiful content, but its that I cant set my PVR to record them. When I do, they seem to record, take up an enormous amount of disk space, but they dont seem to work. I get audio when I play them back on some mpeg editors (the setting is that it only records on &quot;DVD quality&quot; 2048 bytes/sec and I cant change that, and the recording do not play back through windows media center or player). I run Vista on a brand new Quad core machine. Its a &quot;stock&quot; HP m8120n with a GE Force Lite or LE or something 128 video card. Do I need to upgrade my video card to be able to handle so much raw data?
