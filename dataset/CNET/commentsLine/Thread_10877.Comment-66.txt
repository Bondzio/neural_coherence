hi anotherpark thanks for the kind words... here's a very simplistic explanation of how hybrids will work.
hybrids will use the ssd cache' to hold the os and store the main program that will allow for faster start-ups and program launch.
the actual writing/work that is done with a program including any windows/security logging and document storage will be relegated to the spinning hd plater.
theoretically the ssd cache portion will not be subjected to any unnecessary read/write cycles.
of course the user must first direct where &quot;working&quot; files are to be stored which is no different than saving files to an external drive.
manufacturers are hoping that you buy into the concept that you get the speed benefits of an ssd plus the (expected) longer life span of a conventional hd vs that of a pure ssd deployment.
i hope this helps.
