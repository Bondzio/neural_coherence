<s> I decided to undergo the project of building an affordable gaming PC. </s>
<s> After doing long hours of research, and talking with people on forums I have finally ordered the components for my new PC. </s>
<s> At a budget of under $1000 dollars, I am very pleased with the system. </s>
<s> Specs: AMD Athlon 64 3700+ San Diego 1GHz FSB Socket 939 EVGA GeForce 7800 GT eVGA nForce 4 SLI Mainboard CORSAIR ValueSelect 1GB (2 x 512MB) 184-Pin DDR SDRAM Dual Channel Kit System Memory Western Digital Caviar SE 120GB 3.5'' SATA 3.0Gb/s Hard Drive LITE-ON Black IDE DVD Burner I am going to be using a white Dell CRT monitor that I was using with a previous system, until I can justify spending money on a new monitor. </s>
<s> My question is: can I custom paint the monitor? </s>
<s> If so, how? </s>
<s> Are there any good tutorials for doing this? </s>
<s> I understand the dangers of working inside a monitor, but if this is possible please let me know! </s>
<s> I want to paint it to match my new Xion case which is black and grey. </s>
<s> Any help is much appreciated! </s>
<s> LSW </s>
<s> problem..NOT.. You run the risk of creating an oven. </s>
<s> The case won't be able to dissipate the heat. </s>
<s> You could try using a fan directed into the back but the choice is yours. </s>
<s> The fire is your responsibility. </s>
<s> CNET makes no warranties or promises or etc etc..;) and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> If I were to remove the back casing of the monitor, (leaving the monitor screen and front casing attached) I wouldn't be able to paint it? </s>
<s> I don't see how this would change the way the monitor dissipates heat. </s>
<s> The holes in the top would remain there. </s>
<s> I could maybe even mount, say a 80 mm fan in the very back to keep it cool. </s>
<s> I'm not sure how I could go about doing this, but any hints or links in the right direction would be much appreciated. </s>
<s> I have been googling for a couple hours and no luck yet . </s>
<s> i have custom painted 2 of my monitors and 2 others for a friends. </s>
<s> the oldest monitor i painted was already 7 years old and the latest is a year. </s>
<s> all are still running a-ok. </s>
<s> Care to share the details :-D? </s>
<s> not much really. </s>
<s> i think jack there answered the wrong post. </s>
<s> anyway, its always a good idea to separate the case from the innards. </s>
<s> that way you can paint everything you need to without getting paint on the CRT or its circutry. </s>
<s> What you need; Spray Paint (Flat Black and silver gray) Clear Laquer (No.190) Masking Tape old newspaper now the fun part: 1. </s>
<s> &quot;Mask&quot; everything you don't want painted, use the tape and newspaper to cover large portions. </s>
<s> 2. test spray a small, obscure part of the monitor before painting everything. </s>
<s> (anywhere at the bottom would do). </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Start spraying a thin coat first (you'll need around 2-4 coats to achieve an even finish.) </s>
<s> let the paint dry after each coat for at least 20min. </s>
<s> 40 if you have the time. </s>
<s> 4. let the final coat dry for atleast an hour before finishing it off with the clear lacquer. </s>
<s> (2 coats would do.) </s>
<s> 5. put everything back together. </s>
<s> that's it. </s>
<s> if you have any other questions, i'll be happy to assist you. </s>
<s> please post back and tell me how it went. </s>
<s> enjoy! </s>
<s> BTW, i don't think you need the fan. </s>
<s> life is good. </s>
<s> just to be safe: be extra carefully in dismantling the monitor. </s>
<s> don't touch anything inside unnecessarily especially the tube. </s>
<s> just to be safe: be extra careful in dismantling the monitor. </s>
<s> don't touch anything inside unnecessarily especially the tube. </s>
<s> Looking forward to this project. </s>
<s> The paint + laquer will run no risk of melting and running in to the CRT once back in use again right? </s>
<s> Just wondering, I don't have too much experience in this area. </s>
<s> The monitor hasn't been plugged in for about 6 months now. </s>
<s> It should be discharged, even if it is I'm going to make it a point not to touch any of the components. </s>
<s> As for buttons on the front and knobs, should I remove them, or leave them in tact when painting? </s>
<s> Thanks a lot! </s>

<s> don't worry much about the paint melting the plastic. </s>
<s> just try it out on a small portion first. </s>
<s> i normally leave the buttons in their places, unless i want them to be of different color. </s>
<s> better put a mask on the LED though. </s>
<s> gum work best for this, but you could also use your masking tape. </s>
