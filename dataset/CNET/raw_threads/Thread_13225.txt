I'm not really knowledgable with this at all =/ What exactly can i do with a SATA hard drive that gives it an advantage over the old IDE style? Ive been reading about people saying that you need a SATA adapter and all kinds of cables in order to run a SATA hard drive.. any input would be greatly appreciated, thanks

People with older boards may need adaptors for the SATA power connector, or a PCI SATA card if they don't have onboard SATA connectors. There are no con's to SATA HDD's, they are faster. Older systems may need SATA drivers on floppy disk to install XP. Your board SATA can be set in bios to IDE mode, so you don't need to worry about the driver for XP.
