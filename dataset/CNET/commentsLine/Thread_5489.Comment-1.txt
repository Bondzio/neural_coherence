i have a 4 1/2 yr old emachine (w2888) with 'integrated graphics' and i was told it would not work with a large monitor like a 22&quot;.
my graphics controller is a &quot;intel(r)82845g/gl/ge/pe/gv&quot; if that helps.
i have no experience with changing my original system and adding new components/peripherals, so i wanted to ask here to find out if this is true.
my processor is a 2.8ghz if that helps also.
i would love to move up to a 22&quot; (or at least a 20&quot;) from the 17&quot; crt i now have, but don't want to invest in something if my system won't work with it.
would appreciate any help/suggestions!
