Ok I need a new Graphics Card and I was about ready to buy a Radeon 9800Pro for $200 from MSI, but the new GeForce 6800 (not ultra and not GT just 6800) costs $275 and will outperform that 9800pro but 2x in most cases. Now would you either buy that 9800Pro or would you save that extra $75 and go for that 6800 from eVGA? Thanks

But the 9800Pro still can come in costing less and performing very well at various games. Do you think that the GeForce 6800 in 14 months will be the same as a GeForce FX 5800 is today, still performing great but basicly phased out? any ideas on how long it should be considered top range? (I ask that because I don't want to be buying a new $200-300 part every 8 months)

As to the card being the top of the range, once you get near the top, the top position can be a tenuous thing since a better video driver could cause the number 2 card to move ahead. If you are in the top 10, then you can run any game offered today. Bob
