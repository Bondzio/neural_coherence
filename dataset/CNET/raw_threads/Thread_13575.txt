Ive tried connecting NIC to NIC using a crossover cable and i get the connected LED lighting up. But what do i have to do after that, do i have to set something up in 'my network places' ? Also im getting a new desktop with xp so will the same method work for xp to xp? pre thanks

You can go to the help section or online to research various knowledge articles. You can also transfer by other methods cd/dvd's or software programs.
