A non-performing product can be returned due to... non-performance.
At 600x1200 DPI, on screen will be at most 100 DPI so it will be like looking at it at 72X under a microscope.
Be sure to view onscreen at something reasonable.
Wish I had your setup to test, but armed with only this discussion, it's defective and needs to be returned.
