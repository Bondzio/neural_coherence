1.1.1	I only have 5gb of music on my macbook , which I backed up using a flash drive and that 's it .	St
1.1.2	My macbook is used primarily for surfing the web and not much else .	St
1.1.3	I was able to erase my hardrive and reinstall using the osx disc provided to me by apple when I bought my macbook .	St
1.1.4	I came out of it just fine , so I 'm wondering if I need to buy an external hd considering I do n't have much of anything to backup ?	Ques
1.2.1	whether you wish to .	St
1.2.2	It 's personal preference , and for me , I do have an external for storing not just my mp3s , but photos taken , documents created and downloaded drivers/softwares , if I 'm heading to a place where I wo n't need or ca n't use my laptop , I 'll just bring the external hdd .	St
1.2.3	As a backup also is not a bad idea .	Polite
1.3.1	I appreciate your input , thanks .	Polite
1.4.1	Using a Flash Drive as a backup solution is not really a good idea .	St
1.4.2	It 's better than nothing at all but those things are notoriously unstable and prone to losing their data , especially if they are formatted as FAT and not as HFS+ ( The Mac format ) I would suggest that you burn a DVD of your iTunes Library and store it somewhere safe .	St
1.4.3	DVD 's are cheap so burning one a month is not going to break the bank .	St
1.4.4	If you have a program like Toast , it will will span the data across two , or more , DVD 's if your data exceeds the capacity of a DVD .	St
1.4.5	P	St
1.5.1	Thanks , I have been contemplating for awhile now using dvd ( data ) as a primary backup along with my flash drive for my media .	St
1.5.2	Appreciate the input .	St
1.6.1	per GB and I manage to 'kill ' my flash drive to no-return ( totally failed me ) , a harddisk is personally cheaper , but taking to consideration it consist of moving parts ( not the SSD type ) , it needs to run off some electricity at times to last , longevity-wise , a dvd can last longer .	St
1.7.1	Thank you for your input and I have decided that a data dvd backup is what I need right now .	St
1.7.2	I appreciate your input , thanks .	Polite
