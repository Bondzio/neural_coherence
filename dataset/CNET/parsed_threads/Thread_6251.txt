<s> I can get more details tonight, but I thought I might see if anyone has a clue as too what is happening. </s>
<s> I have a case with 8 HD's in it (for storing HDTV files). </s>
<s> A few nights ago I was looking at one of the drives from another PC using Remote Desktop and when I clicked on one of the folders, it said it wasn't there (don't remember the exact error) or that was not accessible. </s>
<s> So I went into the computer itself and looked, same error. </s>
<s> So when I restarted, it wanted to run Scan disk (I think thats the DOS disk utility) at startup. </s>
<s> SO it ran over night and when I went to look at it in the morning, the drive was empty! </s>
<s> It had 200GB of data on it. </s>
<s> This has happened to two other drives in the last few months. </s>
<s> I can get computer details later to help figure out the problem. </s>
<s> But I though some ideas might be on the top of someones head. </s>
<s> I wonder if it's a power issue, cable issue, etc? </s>
<s> I also have this computer in a &quot;closet&quot; with my cable modem, WAP and Router. </s>
<s> It's also in the same closet as the water meter (I think that's what it's called, where the water comes into the house.) </s>
<s> I wonder if it has some magnetic field that's effecting the PC? </s>
<s> Thanks, Jeff </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Many of the hard disk testing utilities are data destructive. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Are you using a damage resistant file system. </s>
<s> If it's FAT32 or such, loss is not unheard of. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Are you using a more reliable OS like Linux? </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Why couldn't you reveal enough information so the forum can take a guess at a proper sized power supply? </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> 8 drives at about 20 watts each is 160 Watts. </s>
<s> Since most power supplies FIB about capacity, I'd fit something about 4 times that value plus beyond reason ventilation. </s>
<s> 6. </s>
<s> IDE cables will be an issue in such an electrically noisy box. </s>
<s> I would only accept 80 conductor IDE cables if these are IDE. </s>

<s> Since hard disks are temporary storage space, you may want to review what the backup system is and how it failed. </s>
<s> Can you share why the backup system failed you? </s>
<s> Others can learn from this backup failure. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I am using NTFS OS is Windows XP Pro My Power Supply is an Allied AL-A400ATX 400Watt All IDe cables are PCToys 80wire ATA133 cables. </s>
<s> Does that help? </s>
<s> What kind of backup system can I used with almost 2 terabytes of data? </s>
<s> I am in the process of backing up to DVD's. </s>
<s> But that is gong to take forever. </s>
<s> I am considering a NEC 8X DVD drive for backups. </s>
<s> But I hear the 8X are not as reliable as 2x and 4x? </s>
<s> But I will probably use it anyway. </s>
<s> But from your writing, you may just be revealing that you have no concerns about data retention? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Along with what I read about your backup plan (none?) </s>
<s> it appears you have work to do. </s>
<s> Best of luck, Bob </s>
<s> No, I do. </s>
<s> I just had this happen before I can get the data backed up to DVD's. </s>
<s> It will take a while with that much data to get it all on DVD's. </s>
<s> Your choice on the backup scheme, but DVD seems like a poor choice since you may need some 40 or 50 disks to hold 2 TB. </s>
<s> Time to look at DLT. </s>
