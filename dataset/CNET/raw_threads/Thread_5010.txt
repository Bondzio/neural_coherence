Alright, I have had a crappy G router from D-Link for a while and my desktop computer upstairs had a matching wireless adapter. Just recently my adapter has been having issues with getting too hot, because I found that when it wasn't working it was hot and after it cooled it worked fine again. Well, now it seems that it is becoming completely useless because it is pretty much broke and only allows a few minutes of internet use before having to unplug it and replug it back in. If I was only to get a new wireless adapter right now, what kind should I get? Also, if I was later to upgrade my router to an N router, would that wireless adapter be able to pick that signal up as well? Im assuming that it doesnt matter, but Im not sure.

Wireless N Gigabit wired. Zero problems. I have a Linksys WRT350N in storage because it died and was replaced. The replacement is what is in storage. I have a Netgear Gigabit PCMCIA card in my ThinkPad laptop. I have a Linksys EG1032 Gigabit PCI card in my server. Stick with the brand names. A wireless card is designed to run hot, you ought to feel the PC card in the laptop. But a flaky solder joint will render any device broken.
