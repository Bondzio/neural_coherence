<s> I am having some issues with my Samsung HD 501 JK internal that came installed in my HP Pavillion a6500f. </s>
<s> I am very concerned that it is about to die. </s>
<s> After a little searching, I have read that even the replacements that Samsung sends out are junk. </s>
<s> Any suggestions on a different HD of similar size/speed to replace it with? </s>
<s> Quite frankly there just isn't that many HD makers. </s>
<s> Off the top of my head, there is Seagate, WD, Samsung, Hitatci and Maxtor. </s>
<s> Seagate now owns Samsung a as well as Maxtor. </s>
<s> Any other label out there maybe a &quot;rebadged&quot; HD is different from those listed. </s>
<s> I have found Seagate to do well to include WD brands. </s>
<s> I xclude any ext. </s>
<s> mounted drives and any 2.5in. </s>
<s> as well also anything SSD based. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy :I </s>
<s> i also had the same concern with my HP Pavillion a 6500f not too long ago, and i decided it was time to get a replacement for my HD. </s>
<s> i bought a Western Digital RE3 WD5002ABYS-01B1B0 from Here it has been working wonders for me! </s>
<s> its a similar spec as the Samsung, but personally think WD is more reliable than Samsung's in the HD market. </s>
