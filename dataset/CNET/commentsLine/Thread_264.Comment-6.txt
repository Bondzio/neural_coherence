(i hope, i'm using it myself), but for this xp antivirus program mbam is recommended somehow.
see for yourself in the 300+ post discussion i linked to.
once you get your machine up and running again, keep using avast.
it needs registering to start with, and reregistering every year, but they don't spam your email-address.
best of luck.
