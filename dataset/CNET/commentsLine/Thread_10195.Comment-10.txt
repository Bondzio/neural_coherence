thanks, willy, for recommending printer works.
they spent 3/4 of an hour troubleshooting our hp laserjet 6l for free.
we now have a plan for diagnosing our problem.
for $9 they sent 1mg printer memory (which reached us in 48 hours regular us mail).
we also now know how to run an engine test.
the next time our printer fails in the way it has been since the laser printer repair tech cleaned it, we will run a test knowing that it is not a memory issue and then we will know if we have an engine problem.
then we will be able to get a &quot;repair kit&quot; from printer works.
terrific service as well as an education in how laser printers work, the history of their development, and specifics on the 6l.
many thanks, alex
