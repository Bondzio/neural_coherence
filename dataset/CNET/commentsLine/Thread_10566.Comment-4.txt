that i've seen where it can make a difference.
lots of pundits out there but i'm sticking to what i think are nice enough machines.
here's my short list for gaming today.
1. dual core or better.
2.
2 to more gb ram.
3. a current os.
4. cards over the 100 buck mark from this list -&gt;  having said that, my game rig is a paltry dual core 2+ghz, ati 3850, xp sp3, etc.
still nice enough but i'm not an avid gamer.
