<s> Hi, I want to add a USB Printer and USB Hard Drive (or two) to my wireless network. </s>
<s> I currently have a 2wire 2701HG-G ADSL modem/router. </s>
<s> The only device I've seen that allows for multiple USB devices is the Airport Extreme. </s>
<s> I'm thinking of connecting my USB printer and 2 hard drives via a USB hub to an Air Extreme. </s>
<s> The Air Extreme would then connect to the 2701HG-G via 802.11G. </s>
<s> - Will this set-up work? </s>
<s> - Have I missed any other devices that will add muliple USB devices on an 802.11 network? </s>
<s> Given the speed or lack of speed in copying files many spend time, money only to go back to connecting those drives to their machines. </s>
<s> Have you done the math to compute copying your files over? </s>
<s> Will you be upset at some file that took seconds to copy now taking 20 to 30 minutes? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
