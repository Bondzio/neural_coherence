Running 3dmark06 professional version, I got a score of 10034.
Now, with my system specs I feel that is low.
Does anyone have any advice??
Here is what I'm running: CPU: Core 2 Quad Q6600 @ 2.4ghz (stock) Heatsink: Zerotherm Nirvana Premium RAM: 2x2gb Corsair @ 800mhz (stock) GPU: evga GeForce 9800gt 512mb (stock) Mobo: nForce 780i sli Hard Drive: 500Gb Seagate Barracuda Looking at those specs, is my score low?
Or is that normal?
I have updated all of the drivers so I'm pretty sure that isn't the problem.
I have also ran a test on 3dmark vantage, and got a score of about 6300.
Thank you for your time.
