<s> Way back in the mists of time (that is, sometime in 2007well, that's way back for many computer users), I told of a CD/DVD burner I bought for my Sawtooth G4 tower (OS 10.4.11) from an online vendor recommended here. </s>
<s> They sent me something meant to be used internally (though it had feet), and I tried installing it, with the result that I knocked out my Zip drive. </s>
<s> I hoped that I wouldn't have to do any more mucking about inside the computer with that drive, even though I've installed RAM in the past without a bit of trouble. </s>
<s> I then decided that if I could, I'd use it as an external drive, but the geniuses (yes, that's what they are called) at the Apple Store told me that would make it too slow. </s>
<s> I subsequently phoned the place where I had bought it and was assured that the drive should, indeed, fit inside the computer, but the man said that I could use it as a Firewire external drive if I got an enclosure. </s>
<s> He even told me the model of enclosure I needed, but not knowing how to put the drive and its little jacket together, I didn't get one. </s>
<s> All well and good, but when I went to a the best-known Apple repair place in New York Citythinking that they might be able to advise me or put the thing into an enclosure for a reasonable feeI was told that no, I shouldn't (couldn't?) </s>
<s> put it into a Firewire enclosure, that they didn't even have one for that drive, but even if they had one, it was not advisable to do so. </s>
<s> Advised me to try again to put it into the machine (or let them do it for a hefty price) or get an external drive from them (ditto on price). </s>
<s> And of course, if I chose the first alternative, I'd have to cart it down in a taxi, wait to be served (long wait), leave it there for days or more, pick it up and then take it back in another taxi. </s>
<s> That isn't on unless I have to do it. </s>
<s> Any idea who is right? </s>
<s> I'd be inclined to believe the folks who sold it to me, but they are the ones who sold me a drive with feet, for heaven's sake. </s>
<s> If I had wanted to insert it again myself, I would have done it, per Tekserve's recommendation. </s>
<s> Apple Geniuses didn't suggest using it externally at all. </s>
<s> I am totally at sea, and if I didn't like the idea of being able to burn files to a CD (esp. </s>
<s> photos, which I could then take someplace to print them out, quaint as that might seem), I'd just skip the whole thing and consider the cost of the CD/DVD drive a loss. </s>
<s> I've gotten excellent advice on this so far, but there has been a new twist or two since the last time I wrote about it. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> At least, about who might be advising me best? </s>
<s> Most humbly grateful and with apologies for the length of this message, jenny </s>
<s> How about you forget about the &quot;Drive with Feet&quot; for a while and get the $34.99 solution to this problem. </s>
<s> This one will absolutely, positively, fit inside your G4 and does not have feet. </s>
<s> I recently purchased 2 of these. </s>
<s> One went into a G4 like yours and the other into a Firewire enclosure. </s>
<s> Those Geniuses at the Apple Store, I wonder what they were smoking? </s>
<s> Believe me, they were NOT what their title claims them to be. </s>
<s> Putting a CD/DVD burner inside an firewire external enclosure does NOT make it slow. </s>
<s> If the place that sold it to you says that it will fit inside a Firwire enclosure, it probably will. </s>
<s> I would really like to take a look at a picture of this &quot;Drive with feet&quot;. </s>
<s> All the internal CD/DVD's I have seen have a smooth surface on all sides, except the front and back of course. </s>
<s> By the way, do they still sell that device at that store? </s>
<s> I still can't help feeling that they shipped the wrong thing to you. </s>
<s> Installing a CD/DVD into an external enclosure is really simple. </s>
<s> Usually 4 screws, two plugs and you are done. </s>
<s> Good Luck How's mumsie? </s>

<s> I have a few USB DVDRW drives and they are not much slower than the internals when it comes to recording. </s>
<s> HOWEVER I abhor coasters and record at HALF the media or drive speed, whichever is lower so I may never see the 8 or 16X speed the drive is rated at. </s>
<s> Yes, my friends claim to record at such speeds but they also have a steady supply of coasters. </s>
