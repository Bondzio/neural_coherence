i have netgear wireless router.
i want to host one web application on my system which is having internal ip as 198.162.*.
* and my external ip is static ip address.
i have installed a web application (using websphere app server) using my external ip adress as host name is not working.
i can access my pages from my machine using host name as localhost or my internal ip address.
what can i do to access my website from outside?
