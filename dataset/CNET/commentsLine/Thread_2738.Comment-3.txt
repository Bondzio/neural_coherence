i had it set up like it says but i called tech support and they told me to disable the security settings, but im starting to doubt what they say.
so i went to change it back and i did, now my wireless internet wont connect and when i try to change it, my wired computer which i am using to change the setting keeps disconnecting, sometimes it says little or no connectivity or network cable unplugged, stop trying to change setting, internet works fine, i am stumped, any help would be greatly appreciated.
