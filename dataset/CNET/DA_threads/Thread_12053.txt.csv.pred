1.1.1	I really dont know much about computers , I would definitely build my own gaming rig if I did .	St
1.1.2	If I had tons to spend I would go with something a site like FalconNW or something , but Im looking to spend around $ 850 .	St
1.1.3	Im looking at Cyberpower , Im thinking an AMD PhenomII X4 cpu with a Radeon 5760 gpu .	St
1.1.4	1 ) Is this pretty good for gaming ?	Ques
1.1.5	If so , how long will it be sufficient for running most games ?	Ques
1.1.6	2 ) What should I know about matching the mobo with the cpu , if the mb says amd ... is that all I really need to worry about ?	Ques
1.1.7	3 ) Case size ... I dont ever think I will need to run a setup with more than one gpu , I dont play high end fps titles .	St
1.1.8	Can I just go with the default case ?	Ques
1.1.9	4 ) What is an internal usb extension module ?	Ques
1.1.10	What is a motherboard expansion card ?	Ques
1.1.11	Do I need these ?	Ques
1.1.12	Any help would really be appreciated , Im in over my head a little	St
1.2.1	also ... I found a few extremely negative reviews about cyberpower .	St
1.2.2	Lots of positive ones but the negative ones are scaring me a bit , a couple said they dont test the systems before shipping .	St
1.2.3	Does anyone have suggestions as far as comparably priced vendors ?	Ques
1.2.4	ibuypower perhaps ?	Ques
1.3.1	CyperPower is nothing more than a 3rd party building systems with typical off shelf components and putting them in a glitzy case .	St
1.3.2	You can do all that just as well .	St
1.3.3	What many consumers complain about is generally they ordering a top-end PC and putting through its paces on gamers demands .	St
1.3.4	These users are generally the most demanding punishing out there .	St
1.3.5	Make no bones about it , they want the best for the least yet do n't really put the effort to really get things going smoothly .	St
1.3.6	You ca n't OC and expect things to always be good .	St
1.3.7	You ca n't push the PC to the extremes and expect good results .	St
1.3.8	You ca n't allow the PC to cook in heat bath for long .	St
1.3.9	You really ca n't play for hrs .	St
1.3.10	on high output and then expect to run every day like that .	St
1.3.11	You CAN only if the $ is spend , wisely installed components and everyday TLC .	St
1.3.12	Usage of only the best components and pay attention to the small details .	St
1.3.13	Cooling and more cooling and make it work .	St
1.3.14	Follow the hints/tips/clues of any hic-up via some gamers forum , drivers forum , s/w forum and/or basic google hits .	St
1.3.15	Of course , if CyperPower ships a piece of crap , well that speaks for itself .	St
1.3.16	Check your wishlist against all those gaemr PC systems and see what makes them tick .	St
1.3.17	-OR- look into high-end PCs and just what they offer and see if you can build one .	St
1.3.18	I generally advise now , is to get a big case , big and namebrand PSU and any cooling options .	St
1.3.19	Then build on that because those 3-items I mentioned are not overlooked or taken for granted and/or shortsighted with regard to the classy items a PC will need .	St
1.3.20	That 's all ... .. tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	Unless you are very rich there is no such thing as a off the shelf 'gaming computer ' .	St
1.4.2	The majority of gamers build their own .	St
1.4.3	That way you can assemble a computer without spending mega bucks .	St
1.4.4	As you claim you are not too computer literate start by googling the web for the fastest CPU , the best video cards and the best motherboard .	St
1.4.5	Make a note on the specifications , and price of each component .	St
1.4.6	This would give you an idea of the cost .	St
1.4.7	Do n't get caught up with the 'speed ' hype .	St
1.4.8	A good dual processor will blow the doors off of a quad or even a six CPU .	St
1.4.9	Remember that Intel is better than AMD .	St
1.4.10	You also would want to get the best power supply , and RAM you can afford along with a good mid size case .	St
1.4.11	Goto all the forums and glean them for information .	St
1.4.12	This way you will be able to get a good computer without buying a ready made one .	St
1.4.13	My saying on this is 'Get a PC at Bestbuy , Walmart etc Get a Computer by building it yourself ' .	St
1.4.14	With modern computer parts it is quite easy to assemble your own .	St
1.4.15	Gone are the days where you had to jumper motherboards and needed an engineering degree to set one up .	St
1.4.16	Good luck .	Polite
1.5.1	thanks guys , i appreciate the feedback .	Polite
1.5.2	at this point i think i am actually going to attempt to build it myself .	St
1.5.3	i have been watching build your own pc vids on youtube like crazy , and i really think i can do it !	St
1.5.4	i have learned more about computers in the last four days than i have in my entire existence on this planet .	St
