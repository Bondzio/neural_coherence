Hello ,I have an &quot;Optiplex GX280 ,I have 4 slots for memory and &quot;Crucial says after a scan that I can max out at 4GB's. I have purchased 4 1GB sticks of memory ,I've installed them and when the PC turns on it says it has 4 GB's of memory but when I click on &quot;system information ,it reads only 2.99 Gb's . what's the deal ??? I appreciate any help ,thanks !!

My Windows 7 system (where I type this) says &quot;Installed RAM: 4 GB&quot;, &quot;Total physical memory 2.93 GB&quot;. I assume most of that missing 1 GB is used for video, because it doesn't have a separate video card. But I don't really care. Kees
