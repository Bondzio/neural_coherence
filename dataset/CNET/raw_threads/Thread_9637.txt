Last week, one of our staff returned a ViewSonic PJ 658 projector, and they had broken the adjuster foor off. The viewSonic Tech guys gave me the part number, but this is an out-of stock item. It is the screw-height adjuster leg. I am usually pretty good at finding these things, but have found nothing so far. Does anyone know of a repository of oddball viewsonic parts? Anybody buy these things when they are broken and part them out? I kind of stinks that we can't use this just now because it is functioning properly...you just can't get a level image to project. All Help appreciated.

A projector at the office lost a foot so one of the office staff whittled one from some wood. If you want to not make a part, try Ebay, craigslist and place that part on order at Viewsonic. Bob
