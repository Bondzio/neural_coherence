I have unplugged, replugged, uninstalled and reinstalled. I have this problem into Lexmark, but they have loads of problems before mine, so if anyone can help me, I would appreciate it. windows me 128 mgs ram Thank you Flora

I uninstalled the program and reinstalled it. I unplugged from the electrical outlet and then plugged it back in. I have tried everything that I have found when I searched &quot;Google&quot; and the Lexmark troubleshooting web site. Thanks again Flora

USB connection w/2.0 specifications. USB cable secure in Trio and PC? Lexmark program used to scan, control program to test scan? No yellow question marks in &quot;Device Manager&quot;? Printer works ok? No error messages on program re-install? No double listing of Trio in printers and &quot;add/remove programs&quot;? no error messages when scan of document attempted? Power light ON on Trio?
