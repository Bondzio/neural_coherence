<s> I decided I can't go on any longer without a portable HDD for video editing (can't upgrade my laptop for another 7 months thanks to Applecare's restrictions). </s>
<s> So I scoured the web for a 7200rpm+FW800 option and boiled it down to either getting the Seagate 2.5 500GB 7200rpm HDD with OWC FW800 enclosure (~200$) versus the Seagate Freeagent Go Pro of the same specs (190$). </s>
<s> I also know that Lacie has the rugged option but it is 320GB and more expensive than the Seagate for less space. </s>
<s> Nevertheless, I can't decide between the two. </s>
<s> On the Seagate hand, I'll have a 5 year warranty versus 3 years for the Seagate drive and 1 year for the enclosure. </s>
<s> On the OWC side, I can always switch out the drive without voiding any warranties since I put it together myself. </s>
<s> What do you guys think. </s>
<s> I think I'm leaning towards Seagate's warranty but want to hear some wisdom before swiping the card and a good chunk of my pay check. </s>
<s> Why I ask is that all these drives eventually suffer the same fate and sooner than most internal drives. </s>
<s> Besides the drive, what backup copy is needed? </s>
<s> I haven't heard that these drives have a shorter lifespan. </s>
<s> Is there an article you can point to? </s>
<s> Why do they have a shorter life than most internal drives? </s>
<s> Please fill me in on more details. </s>
<s> all the more reason to get the Seagate with 5 yr warranty, eh? </s>
<s> You can read this forum and many others to learn this. </s>
<s> Of course you could learn it on your own. </s>
<s> After decades in and around computers of all shapes and sizes this is what I've learned. </s>
<s> &quot;Backup is learned rather than taught.&quot; While we can teach, write about backup each new user appears to question the need for backup until they suffer loss. </s>
<s> Then they no longer need to be told or taught. </s>
<s> Sorry about that but it can upset some when you write it harshly. </s>

<s> So I backup everything I have on the portable HDD, I still need a portable HDD for the work that I do. </s>
<s> You say that the drives I mention have a shorter life, then I ask which drives have the longer life? </s>
<s> Is this a portable vs. desktop issue, a 7200 rpm issue? </s>
<s> I do video editing on the go and need a solution for carrying around files larger than my laptop can hold. </s>
<s> It sounds like it doesn't matter what drive I get as long as I back it up. </s>
<s> Is that correct? </s>
<s> I've seen all makes and models show up in need of recovery. </s>
<s> I can't say that any maker has one that is better than all the rest. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> So I'm just going to put together a 500GB solution that is 7200 rpm for video editing, and make sure to back it up. </s>
<s> Thanks for the advice. </s>
