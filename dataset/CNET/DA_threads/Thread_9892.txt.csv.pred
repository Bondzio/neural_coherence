1.1.5	Ive tried everything.	St
1.1.6	It works, I know that much.	St

1.3.4	PATA drive not jumpered correctly 4.	St
1.3.5	Defective drive or cable The first place to look is in the BIOS setup menu.	St
1.3.6	Boot there see what drives show up.	St
1.3.7	It sounds as if the CD/DVD ROM is detected.	St
1.3.8	The HD listing should be in that general area.	St
1.3.9	As well, make sure the HD spins up.	Sug
1.3.10	You should be able to hear the motor start and the clicking from the heads initializing.	St
1.4.1	in the XP installation where you must hit 'F6'(?)	St
1.4.2	to load any special drivers for SATA hard disk drives.	St
1.4.3	Did you try that ?	Ques
1.4.4	Sometimes you have to create a floppy disk to load the driver.	St
1.4.5	It would really help if you provided more detail about the hard drive .	St
