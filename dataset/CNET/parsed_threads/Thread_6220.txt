<s> I was thinking of purchasing a netbook for my 9 year old to play internet based games from (Gamesloth.com, miniclip.com, nick.com, etc) would the netbook support these ok? </s>
<s> Those Flash games aren't so demanding. </s>
<s> Some remarks: - the screen size of a netbook is quite small - 600 x 800 pixels at most - this may be a limiting factor for some games - the small keyboard might be right for small 9-years hands - playing games often needs a mouse - the touchpad of an average laptop isn't nice for that; so preferably you use it sitting at a desk, and then you don't need a notebook or laptop so much - netbooks, like all laptops, have a rather limited lifetime and expensive batteries A cheap desktop MIGHT be a better solution. </s>
<s> YOUR choice, depending on YOUR situation. </s>

<s> That ran on our Acer Aspire One netbook after I figured out how to pan and scroll so the screen would fit. </s>
<s> So the kid was able to travel and game for cheap. </s>
<s> Later we picked up some under 400 buck Toshiba 3GB RAM, 160GB HD, Celeron with the usual. </s>
<s> The netbook was great training wheels so I could see what respect he would have for the real thing. </s>
