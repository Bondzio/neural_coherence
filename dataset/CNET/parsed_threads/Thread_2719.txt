<s> I have a question I have recently started a job, and being that I have a computer background, my boss wants me to set up his network. </s>
<s> His setup is cable modem for internet access. </s>
<s> The cable modem plugs into a 4 port router. </s>
<s> He wants to attach his router to a 16+ dlink ethernet fast switch. </s>
<s> My question is do we need a crossover cable to connect the router to the swith. </s>
<s> If so would this be the best setup. </s>
<s> Should we just take away the router and plug the cable modem into swith. </s>
<s> If so how would i configure. </s>
<s> Anyway all help is appreciated. </s>
<s> Any advice as far as setup and configuration would be greatly appreciated </s>
<s> The switch just expands the number of possible wired connections but you can't eliminate the router. </s>
<s> It's the gateway that connects one network to another. </s>
<s> It also is probably capable of being a DHCP server. </s>
<s> If network users want or need dynamic addressing, the router will do that and a switch will not. </s>
<s> That should give you a start. </s>
