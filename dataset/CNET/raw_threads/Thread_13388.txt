Maxtor drive (or possibly power source) is completely dead. Since then all USB ports are not working (nothing happens when I plug anything into any of them) - even though device manager says they are. Also discovered the slot for my Sony memory stick is not working as well. Tried: updating USB drivers (none newer available), rolling back and re-updating drivers, uninstalling and re-installing USB's. Was going to disable then re-enable in BIOS but I don't see anything in BIOS about USB's. Sony says I should reset system to factory installation. This will take DAYS - backing up data to CD/DVD, rebuilding, re-updating Windows, drivers, reinstalling programs, etc..... Does anyone know of any other way to determine if the hardware is completely failed? Any 3rd party utilities? If the USB's and other slots have blown, will I have to re-set the pc anyways (so I may as well bite the bullet and try it)? Thanks in advance!

If not, you may have a true h/w fault and the USB ports got blown away. While, I've seen singualr USB ports go bad, not all of them. Either the weak link of the USB int. to system is poof, or by using a bad device, plugging into all of them forced the issue and kaput them. No mention of Sony system model, so laptop or desktop, yada, yada. If desktop place a USB pci type card and install. Does it work then? If yes, bad USB ports, if no then bad s/w issue. tada -----Willy

Under XP: goto start-&gt;pgms-&gt;accessories-&gt;system tools-&gt;system restore-&gt;follow prompts. Now pick a date that makes sense, like a day before the problem occurred. If Vista very similar. Google for restore point to understand this feature. Don't use a resotre disk or recovery disk to reload the system. I hope I made this clear. good luck -----Willy
