<s> I recently acquired a fairly old 40 gb hard drive which connects using a wide ribbon IDE cable. </s>
<s> I opened my dell computer, and found that it has no such thing. </s>
<s> The only things using a ribbon of any kind are the CD/floppy drives, but those ribbons are less wide, and don't fit. </s>
<s> The newer hard drive connects using some really thin blue cable and a power cord. </s>
<s> Is there some type of cable that will convert the thin blue cord to a wide ribbon IDE cable? </s>
<s> You probably need something like this: http://www.cooldrives.com/sata-adapters.html </s>
<s> Is most probably a SATA connection which is generally standard on newer motherboards </s>
<s> Okay, so, since it's SATA then (as the other guy mentioned) will I need to set up a master/slave thing, or do I just have to buy a separate cord? </s>
<s> Because those prices are NOT reasonable if I also have to buy the cord, since this hard drive is only 40 gb. </s>
<s> Could you please tell your motherboard model or your dell model so that we can be more helpful? </s>
<s> those aren't necessarily the best prices. </s>
<s> just a link that showed a few different adaptors. </s>
<s> I bought one for about $20 which allowed you to connect the drive to your pc via the usb port - all cables and power supplies included, nice and easy. </s>
