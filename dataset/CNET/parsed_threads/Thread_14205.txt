<s> and now the sound is somewhat corrupted. </s>
<s> I mean that every minute or so music or DVDs or whatever seems to be warbled. </s>
<s> I'm able to access the internet without a problem and I don't think that installing this hardware has interfered with the IRQ channels since sound is controlled by the mobo. </s>
<s> Problem is, the drivers that came with the desktop adaptor were not XP verified. </s>
<s> So if anyone could please tell me how to troubleshoot this, I'd be grateful. </s>
<s> See http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/storage/IDE-DMA.mspx </s>
<s> I just got the same card, and its doing the same thing. </s>
<s> Studdering occationally, as if my system is doing hard work, when really its just idle. </s>
<s> I can tell something is happening because any audio playing will studder as if slowing down momentarily, as well as mouse speed studdering. </s>
<s> I'm certain it has nothing to do with drm as suggested above, as it affects entire system, its just more noticable with audio playing (including game audio). </s>
<s> i read people having problems with the drivers ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16833127213 ), and that &quot;The chipset is made by atheros, which also is in the wpm7000 by linksys&quot; (from post in link above), but i can't seem to find the drivers for a wpm7000 by linksys, if it even exsists. </s>
<s> this is really a pain in the ass. </s>
<s> uninstalling the card gets rid of the problem, and it comes back when i reinstall it. </s>
<s> its also auto starting the d-link wireless connection manager twice, so that two green bars appear in my notification area. </s>
<s> i had a netgear wpn 311 who's drivers kept crashing to blue screen randomly, which is why i thought i was &quot;upgrading&quot; to this d-link card and router. </s>
<s> so im not having the best of luck with wireless. </s>
<s> I figured out that the linksys drivers reffered are these : ( http://www-uk.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Download_C2&childpagename=UK%2FLayout&cid=1129319258516&packedargs=sku%3D1144912118458&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper ) the EU and AU version of the linksys card chipset is made by atheros, like the d-link cards. </s>
<s> i tried this driver, and, while the card appears as WMP300N - Wireless-N PCI Adapter, it works, but still studders the same way (audio still studders). </s>
<s> the studdering is making the mouse hard to controll too which is the biggest pain in the ass, cause i gotta photoshop for work. </s>
<s> http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/storage/IDE-DMA.mspx It's a simple procedure that I've used a few hundred times to cure this. </s>
<s> It's so simple that I do that first before doing anything else. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I tried the linksys driver, it didn't work, the internet connection sucked I got the updated driver from dlink [1.02 i think] and now i have a great connection, but i have the stutters anyone? </s>
<s> forgive my ignorance, but what does switching the DMA of my IDE harddrive or cdrom help this issue with a driver for a network adapter card? </s>
<s> or am i doing something wrong? </s>
<s> I must decline writing the long answer for each member. </s>
<s> It's a quick, painless, no reboot procedure and we use that first to dismiss the usual. </s>
<s> If this is unacceptable then please research it further or just take it to a repair counter. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> thanks for the reply, bob from what I can tell, both my primary and secondary are in DMA mode. </s>
<s> i still seem to having the audio/video stutter issue thanks again for the reply i guess i will have to do more research </s>
<s> We have to flip it to PIO and back in a specific manner since we can't tell if it's in DMA 0 or 5 or 6. </s>
<s> If you decline the procedure I'd rather not explore all the other areas first. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> i will do that now and i will let you know thanks! </s>
<s> My primary channel devices 0 and 1 are both DMA mode 5 My secondary channel device 0 is mode 2 and device 1 is n/a </s>
