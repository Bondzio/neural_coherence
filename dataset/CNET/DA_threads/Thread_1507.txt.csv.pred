1.1.1	Hi , I just completed my first computer build as a major upgrade to my old Dell Dimension 8200 .	St
1.1.2	With help from my buddy the parts were put together without any problem .	St
1.1.3	Our dilemma lies in the booting of the installed O/S .	St
1.1.4	We tried booting with XP Professional or Linux Ubuntu 10.10 but the hard drive is not able to fully start up either O/S .	St
1.1.5	XP gives us the Blue Screen , while Linux only gives the blinking cursor after the bios runs .	St
1.1.6	My friend believes there is something wrong with the hard drive .	St
1.1.7	After getting the Blue Screen he used a software to do a clean wipe of the drive which found many dirty/corrupted sectors .	St
1.1.8	If so I can get the drive replaced by NewEgg .	St
1.1.9	However , I wanted to know if any of you had other suggestions .	St
1.1.10	Please see my build specs below .	St
1.1.11	Thank you , Vikram Specs : AMD Phenom II X2 555 BE AsRock 870Exreme3 Motherboard XFX ATI HD4650 1gb 128bit DDR2 Graphics card Rosewill RG530-S12 530W PSU Mushkin Silverline Enhanced 4GB Memory Samsung Spinpoint F3 HD502HJ 500gb HD SATA 3gbs Asus DRW-24B1ST DVD/CD Burner Rosewill Challenger Case	St

1.3.1	Actually , I 'm not .	St
1.3.2	I thought the drivers could only be installed after the O/S starts up all the way .	St
1.3.3	I can download the drivers for the HD but I 'm not sure if the PC will read them since they will be on a separate disk .	St
1.3.4	I can try it since its worth shot .	St
1.4.1	How are you adding SATA support to this old OS ?	Ques
1.4.2	And another suggestion .	St
1.4.3	Let 's not duplicate the old XP and SATA discussion ever again .	St

1.6.1	ftp : //download.asrock.com/manual/qig/870 Extreme3.pdf You 'll have to copy and paste the full link as there is a space in the URL .	St
1.6.2	Page 28 tells you to set the BIOS for XP & quot ; 2.13.1 Installing Windows ?	Ques
1.6.3	XP / XP 64-bit Without RAID Functions & quot ; PAGE 2 of http : //www.asrock.com/support/qa/TSDQA-44.pdf repeats this advice .	St
