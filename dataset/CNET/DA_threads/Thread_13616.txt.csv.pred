1.1.1	Just over a year ago I purchased a Maxtor Shared Storage II NAS drive.	St
1.1.2	My needs were basic; all I wanted to do was serve MP3 files to my Sonos streaming music system.	St
1.1.3	Problem was, only after I bought the drive did I find out about it's record of unreliability, and sure enough after 6 months it started to play up.	St
1.1.4	A few tips off the web plus a few hours talking to Maxtor did get it up and running, but I still didn't trust it so backed up my crucial files to DVD.	St
1.1.5	That proved wise; almost the day it went out of warranty it's failed completely, so now I'm in the market another solution.	St
1.1.6	My needs have changed slightly though... - Serve content to my Sonos as before (I only have a measly 15gb of music right now, though); - Provide a reliable backup solution for the two laptops my partner and I use (I think that means I need RAID 1 config, correct?	St
1.1.7	); - In future, serve HD video content to my main TV.	St
1.1.8	The backup piece is probably the most important thing for me now - I've just bought a new digital SLR and have a baby on the way, so I need to be able to backup my files safely, reliably and with the minimum of fuss.	St
1.1.9	Speed is not so crucial - as long as it can keep up with pushing 720p content down a wired link to the TV, that should be good enough.	St
1.1.10	I've taken a look online, but have become rather confused by the options on offer.	St
1.1.11	What would people suggest?	St
1.1.12	I have up to 300 to spend on the right solution.	St
1.1.13	I'm a technology lover, but not a techie - I'm not against buying a NAS cage and installing drives if that's the most reliable option, but I don't want to spend hour after frustrating hour setting it up only to get unreliable performance.	St
1.1.14	As a result I like the look of the Buffalo Linkstation Pro Duo, but don't know much about it - are the drives possible to replace if one fails?	St
1.1.15	Any suggestions would be much appreciated - frankly I'm surprised at how few of the consumer targetted NAS solutions get a good writeup!	St
1.1.16	Thanks in advance, Matt	St
1.2.1	No suggestions from anyone?	Ques
1.2.2	Would be much appreciated...thanks!	St
1.2.3	Matt	St
1.3.1	Anyone have any ideas on this one?	St
1.3.2	Thanks, Matt	Polite
1.4.1	I'd consider the Apple Time Machine.	St
