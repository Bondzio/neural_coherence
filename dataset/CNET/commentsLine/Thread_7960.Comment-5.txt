the off the shelf computer you have now has a cheap motherboard and processor,so most other parts will be selected on price rather than quality.
by using a top class motherboard and processor these parts will have a 3 year warranty.
a 400w-500w power supply in a large atx case for better airflow is needed to run a good video card.
use either a p4 or athlon 64 motherboard with the latest socket size.
gaming computers need to be top of the line with at least 1 gig of ram and a core 2 duo processor or dual core processor.
you will not be able to build a cheap system if you want to play the latest games.
brand name computers are built to a price first and foremost,this is why a lot of them give trouble.
the moment you cut corners on price you cut quality.
if cost is a real problem forget using it for serious gaming and put your present system into a larger case with a 400w power supply and install a dvd r/rw so you can burn dvds and add 2x512 of ram discarding the 256 stick (you may be able to trade it in if is lifetime warranty ram).
doing this will be a cheap option that will improve your performance and allow you to play older games.
with the adittion of a $300 video card more modern games can be played.
