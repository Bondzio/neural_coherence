<s> I have an arctic cooler freezer pro 7 and used arctic silver 5 thermal compound. </s>
<s> I had an Dual-Core e2180 2.0ghz CPU installed with my Gigabyte GA-P35-DS3L, which was 27C idle and about 48C under stress. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116052 I just went to Fry's electronics and they installed a dual core e8500 3.16Ghz. </s>
<s> C01 stepping model. </s>
<s> (They installed the fan facing towards the graphics card, it was originally facing forward) http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115036 Everything works fine but my new temperature is 48C idle and under stress OCCT it skyrockets to 70 degrees??? </s>
<s> I called and the lady told me that she installed it correctly and used the right amount of thermal compound. </s>
<s> Is the 20 degrees difference because of the new CPU? </s>
<s> or is it a bad CPU? </s>
<s> I bought it off Ebay Used. </s>
<s> Or did Fry's electronics did a bad installation? </s>
<s> What should I do? </s>
<s> There was reason the fan faced forward and it you see the result. </s>
<s> The new cpu itself should cause some increase in temp, but if the fan is rated for its use, it should be OK within tolerances. </s>
<s> The trapping of exhaust air between the two(video card and cpu) isn't ideal. </s>
<s> However, if the fan can only be mounted in that way, then it was the wrong HSF to use. </s>
<s> The link you provided offers nothing in the fan(HSF) used in the way it is. </s>
<s> IMHO, the setup is incorrect as I see it. </s>
<s> If you can reroute the fan as it orginally was, it should be correct. </s>
<s> If not, then try another fan setup. </s>
<s> HSF = heatsink + fan There are so many various combos, I'm sure you can find another one. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> My i860 runs under 30c at normal use like right now but up to 50c under heavy load. </s>
<s> My guess is the HS is not flush with the CPU heat spreader....... </s>
<s> Here's another HS Fan that rates highly over at FrostyTech.com http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835233082 Let us know how it turns out. </s>
