1.1.1	Help .	St
1.1.2	I am a graphic designer looking to expand my capabilities into video editing/animation .	St
1.1.3	Looking for a new Desktop with all the bells and whistles , and mega power to run all my Adobe programs plus all the new video editing software I 'll be adding on to my existing bounty of programs .	St
1.1.4	I need to run several design programs simultaneously without losing speed and without crashing .	St
1.1.5	And bear in mind that programs like Adobe 's Illustrator and Photoshop grab memory and drive space to run their graphic filtering programs .	Sug
1.1.6	I 've read all the articles on what a super-charged desktop requires and I have a good idea of the specs required for what I need to buy .	St
1.1.7	Well ... sort of .	St
1.1.8	I 've been looking at the Sony VAIO VGC-RA810G which is supposed to be a state-of-the-art machine made for media work ( favorably reviewed here by CNET 8/3/2004 ) BUT it apparently has a RAM upgrade limitation of 2 gigs .	St
1.1.9	Should this be a dealbreaker for me ?	Ques
1.1.10	I want the system to last me a few years .	St
1.1.11	Is 2 gigs of RAM an insane amount ?	Ques
1.1.12	Will I ever need more ?	Ques
1.1.13	I have seen some systems ( like the Velocity Media series ) that are upgradable to 8 or 9 gigs of RAM or more .	St
1.1.14	Will the video/design technology require more than 2 gigs of RAM to produce high end work ?	Ques
1.1.15	Or am I just worrying about something that will never even matter to the efficiency of my system ?	Ques
1.1.16	I am confused and need some clarity .	St
1.1.17	Any advice greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.1.18	Any other desktop recommendations for my specific needs would be welcome too .	St
1.1.19	THANKS !	St
1.2.1	For example , a DVD creation software created identical DVDs in 6 hours .	St
1.2.2	The clone of the machine with 1G ram ( the other had 512MB ) finished 5 minutes sooner .	St
1.2.3	For that , the extra 512MB was not paying off .	St
1.2.4	I would have expected better because the DVD image is ... 4.7GB .	St
1.2.5	As to this machine lasting you years , you should buy what you need today since tomorrow we see dual-core 64-bit machines in just a month or two .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for your reply and example .	Polite
1.3.2	But are DVD creation and video editing equitable functions ?	Ques
1.3.3	I 've been told that video editing will require massive amounts of ram .	St
1.3.4	I 'm trying to ascertain if this is true or not .	St
1.3.5	If I buy a computer and 2g of ram means I can only edit a video 30 minutes in length or less than I will regret spending $ 2,000 on such a purchase .	St
1.3.6	The operating system is going to leech a certain amount of that ram already , so I am concerned if ram size is important that 2gs may be too little .	St
1.4.1	Such is very much like video editing .	St
1.4.2	In fact , it 's more demanding than the video editing to us because it takes so long .	St
1.4.3	The machines are clones of each other and we have taken a 512M stick from one to the other with & quot ; not much & quot ; difference in any application .	St
1.4.4	1G buys you bragging rights though .	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	Thanks Bob .	St
1.5.2	Thats exactly the information I needed to be able to go out tomorrow and buy this machine with confidence .	St
1.5.3	Thats a huge relief .	St
1.5.4	This forum has been immensely valuable .	St
