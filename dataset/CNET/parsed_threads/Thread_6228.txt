<s> after sorting out a wireless password problem i got my network up and running again for laptop to access. </s>
<s> this didnt last long and now my laptop says it cant find anything when it scans for wireless networks. </s>
<s> it also has an icon of a mast with a cross over it in the system tray which states &quot;WLAN: Disabled.&quot; i clicked the icon but it has no option to turn on my laptops wifi to scan for networks. </s>
<s> any help on how to turn it on to access my network would be greatly appreciated. </s>
