Reading http://support.microsoft.com/kb/925528/en-us it appears they still have some bugs to pound out.
That is NOT the only KB article they have on this problem.
Dell and MS however should get you moving.
In closing, be sure to use the rear USB ports if on a desktop machine to avoid another issue.
