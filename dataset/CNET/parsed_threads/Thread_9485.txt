<s> i have owned,,,,and looked at several lcd monitors of different brands,,,sony, iiyama,samsung,,,,,and they ALL squish the images slightly. </s>
<s> ie,,,a square looks slightly rectangular, and a circle slightly elliptical, as opposed to my crt which shows images as they should be. </s>
<s> why is this. </s>
<s> btw, there are no adjustments for this. </s>
<s> LCD monitors all have a Native pixel density. </s>
<s> This is their best setting. </s>
<s> All other settings require software to map the chosen density to the native density, this requires interpolation (approximation). </s>
<s> Artifacts of this procedure may be what you are seeing. </s>
<s> Are you using these LCD monitors at their Native setting, or not? </s>
<s> i guess i am. </s>
<s> well, let's just say i haven't done any tweaking other than color/brightness/contrast. </s>
<s> as i said, i don't see or recognize any settings to adjust. </s>
<s> would getting the monitor to view things proportionately correct, cause problems? </s>
<s> The adjustment will have to occur in you mind. </s>
<s> There are no such settings that will change the LCD's pixel shape/size. </s>
