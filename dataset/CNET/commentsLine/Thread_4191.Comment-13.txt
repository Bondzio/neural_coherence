some may insist this means it's like a car.
you change the tire and then get in and drive off.
in this case it's not simple.
you change the motherboard and while it does work the os will not run.
your pc will not work as before.
windows is not running.
the computer works but will likely need a fresh install of windows but that oem windows may fail.
i hope you see the problem.
