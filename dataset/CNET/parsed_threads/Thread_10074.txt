<s> I am a consultant and keynote for very high end executives. </s>
<s> Sometimes I am in a room of 5 executives viewing my screen, other times in front of 500 viewing through projection. </s>
<s> I am in need of a visually impressive laptop (not a MAC), lightweight (&lt;4lbs), that easily runs animations, presentations, video, etc. </s>
<s> and is projection system friendly. </s>
<s> If anyone has any advice as to what I should consider, I would love your input. </s>
<s> Most look great. </s>
<s> For me, anything with HDMI is &quot;projection friendly.&quot; Bob </s>
