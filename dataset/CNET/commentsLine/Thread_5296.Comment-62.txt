integrated graphics means the graphics card is on the mother board and shares your ram memory instead of having it's own memory deciated to the video card.
now days computers come with a couple of free slots pci\pcie where you can disable the on board video card and puchase a video card if you ever did need the extra power.
i would reccomend researching the pc and check to see if it comes with any addtional slots for upgrade purposes.
if your not going to be gaming and using the pc for internt, word processing and light video editing you should be fine.
hope this helps.
