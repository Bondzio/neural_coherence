<s> I personally use an Ultra external HDD case with a Seagate 120Gb HDD inside. </s>
<s> The external HDD case does not come with a hard drive. </s>
<s> I had to purchase a separate hard drive for it - chose the Seagate 120Gb, 7200rpm hard drive because the Seagate is more reliable from my experience and the 120Gb takes care of all my files. </s>
<s> This combination was less expensive than any complete unit on the market at the time and it has both USB 2.0 and high speed Firewire. </s>
<s> This Ultra has both a USB 2.0 and Firewire connections. </s>
<s> I use it to backup both my office and home machines. </s>
<s> I purchased it through TigerDirect.com for about $50. </s>
<s> I have used it for a year. </s>
<s> I would recommend the Ultra product to anyone. </s>
<s> Do the research and find what you like. </s>
<s> And with a good external case you can put the HD on the shelf and put an optical drive in. </s>
<s> More flexibility!! </s>
<s> Good luck, Telephony facts, analog/digital explained. </s>
