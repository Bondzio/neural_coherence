1.1.1	Ok. Only other time I networked anything was when I used a router to split a cable ISP connection between my neighbor and myself .	St
1.1.2	However , when we tried to take the router off and go back to individual access , my neighbor 's pc could never connect so I 'm already afraid of routers .	St
1.1.3	Anyway ... .	St
1.1.4	I 've got a desktop pc , a new ibook w/Airport card , and an xbox .	St
1.1.5	Need advice to set up a network where the ibook is wireless and the xbox ( wired or wireless ) gets strong bandwith throughput .	St
1.1.6	I 'll be downloading a lot of music on the pc as well .	St
1.1.7	The pc is upstairs while the xbox is in the basement .	St
1.1.8	( thanks to my wife ! )	Polite
1.1.9	I was looking at the new Belkin Pre-N router .	St
1.1.10	I 'd like all the help and suggestions I can get .	St
1.2.1	I would stick with a good quality router .	St
1.2.2	Netgear and Linksys are two of the best brands out there .	St
1.2.3	Dlink would be my third choice .	St
1.2.4	I personally would n't use a highspeed connection without a router .	St
1.2.5	A router offer some protection from the outside .	St
1.2.6	Better to get one with a built in firewall .	St
