<s> I am having a time trying to get any DVD to play without studdering. </s>
<s> I have an HP/w AMD 64 2.2Ghz, 3G RAM, 8600 GT vidcard w/256 RAM and on XP. </s>
<s> The drive is a HP 740b. </s>
<s> It is a lightscribe drive. </s>
<s> I can play BattleFront 2 and Transformers from the DVD drive with no problem. </s>
<s> Graphics are great and speed is great. </s>
<s> But the processor stays at 100% in any DVD playback program and the play back is horrible. </s>
