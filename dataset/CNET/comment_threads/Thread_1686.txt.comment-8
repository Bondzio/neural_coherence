As Bob pointed out, networking with a router would simplify thing alot.
I have just subscirbe to verizon dsl and here is what they sent me; a wireless dsl modem/router (it's actiontec model GT704-WG).
So far I haven't got it connected yet.
I am still learning, hehe.
If I were you, I problaly would stay away from the bluetooth thing.
Sounds like a different animal to me.
