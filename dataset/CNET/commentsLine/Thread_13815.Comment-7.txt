bob, indeed - i have been trying to clean it for the past few weeks (uninstalling programs); but also all e-mail is web based for us, so we have not storage on here for that.
duly noted on the back-up - for that i have been negligent and plan to address that 1st.
i downloaded ccleaner and used it just now and that was helpful to some degree.
thanks for the ideas
