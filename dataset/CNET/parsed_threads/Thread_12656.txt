<s> The case I aquired has a LCD panel to indicate temperature labeled CPU,HDD, & VGA. </s>
<s> How are these best positioned? </s>
<s> CPU: at the base (side) of the heat sink? </s>
<s> HDD: On the drive itself or near the Controller IC? </s>
<s> VGA: Controller IC? </s>
<s> I am hoping someone has experience with these devices and can advise what is considered optimum use. </s>
<s> Thanks, rbul </s>
<s> Virtually all mobos have a thermistor located in the CPU socket that is probably the best place to sense CPU temp. </s>
<s> Your BIOS probably reads it and you can download speed fan to read it in real time. </s>
<s> Google it. </s>
<s> For your sensor, maybe have the sensor about 1 inch above the hub of the CPU fan. </s>
<s> Both AMD and Intel recco the temp there to be under 38C for their heat sinks. </s>
<s> This gives a high but in spec CPU temp, thus adjust your air flow/fans to get that well below that temp. </s>
<s> If I had such an item [mine only has one sensor]. </s>
<s> I would simply move them around every now and then and get a temp profile of the interior temps in the case. </s>
<s> If you go to a new hotter en hades video card you certainly want to be sure that the air is moving through that section. </s>
<s> [VGA should be considered to be the video cards ATI or Nvidia chip on the card, if you have a card.]. </s>
<s> Once you establish the steady state temps at the various locations, they won't change unless you change the airflow situation. </s>
<s> Of course they will also move up and down with your room ambient temp. </s>
<s> Thank You Ray! </s>
<s> Just the 3 probes, all connected to the LCD front panel. </s>
<s> What products are used to afix heat sensors to pcb's, HDD's & CPU's? </s>
<s> Tape, gum adhesive, what's available? </s>
