<s> Which would be a cost efficient B&W laser printer to buy ? </s>
<s> My son , a university student , is printing a lot of lecture material. </s>
<s> I had an old Epson 400 printer that worked quite well until he started using cheap cartridges and refills which totally clogged the heads. </s>
<s> I have a HP7900 photo printer I use for printing photos , I need a printer to print B&W text inexpensively, I assume that laser would be a better choice than inkjet . </s>
<s> The printer would be run on a new PC with Vista. </s>
<s> Thank you Cesia </s>
<s> Head to the office stores and you should see HP lasers in the 99 to 199 range. </s>
<s> Such will work fine on Vista. </s>
