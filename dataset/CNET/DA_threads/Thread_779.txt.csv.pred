1.4.1	it 's IDE , is that all i need to know ?	Ques
1.5.1	For larger HDs , your system BIOS and operating system need to support the largeer size .	St
1.5.2	References : http : //www.seagate.com/support/kb/disc/capacity/index.html http : //www.48bitlba.com	St
1.6.1	Well , how do I know ?	Ques
1.7.1	There are tutorials everywhere .	St
1.7.2	Hard drive mfgs .	St

1.11.1	I meant one that had all of the info about compatibility What 's an MFG ?	Ques
1.11.2	My Computer : IBM XP Model E4N	St
1.12.1	Hard drives ( HD ) have been around for decades , and there is a long history of development and compatibility .	St
1.12.2	Therefore , you are n't going to find a concise tutorial on all the different HD technologies .	St
1.12.3	You would be reading a good sized technical manual .	St
1.12.4	Circusjojo gave you a good start on the 3 main technologies of the past decade -- SCSI , IDE , and SATA .	St
1.12.5	SCSI historically has been the HD for servers and Macintosh computers .	St
1.12.6	Macs switched over to IDE drives on many of their machines in the mid 1990 's .	St
1.12.7	http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scsi IDE drives historically have been in MS Windows machines .	St
1.12.8	The term ''IDE '' is often misused because it encompases a large area of technology ( not just one type of hard drive and not just hard drives ) .	St
1.12.9	Many use the term ''IDE '' to mean any Parallel ATA ( PATA ) HD and not SATA and not SCSI .	St
1.12.10	http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Technology_Attachment SATA or Serial ATA is a newer technology that would not be found in a computer as old as yours .	St
1.12.11	http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sata A good way to approach it is to find out what type of HD is currently in the computer and then get one of those .	St
1.12.12	Your computer seems to be a Windows machine from 1999 .	St
1.12.13	AMD processor 350MHz ?	Ques
1.12.14	Anyway , it would have a PATA HD .	St
1.12.15	Maybe it is an early EIDE drive or possibly an ATA/33 or ATA/66 drive at the fastest .	St
1.12.16	TO GET ANSWERS HERE , YOU NEED TO PROVIDE MORE INFO : Download and run Belarc Advisor and tell us what the full name of your IBM E4N is .	St
1.12.17	Tell us the motherboard ( system board ) model mumber .	St
1.12.18	Tell us the make and model of your current HD .	St
1.13.1	NIL	St
1.14.1	The specifications for the HD on the retail box or online will tell you enough information .	St
1.14.2	If you are looking at your old hard drive , the model number on the drive is enough to do a search online .	St
1.14.3	You can also get the name and model number from Windows utilities like Belarc Advisor , Everest Home Edition , and the built-in System Information utility in Windows XP .	St
1.14.4	Do you have a link to an example ?	Ques
1.14.5	Can you provide the model number of the current HD ?	Ques
1.15.1	I have IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers and the hard drive I have now is a Maxtor 90840D5 I am also considering building a computer from scratch , but I need a way to know if everything is compatible .	St
1.15.2	Are there some guides where it tells you what kind of video cards work on what kind of motherboard , what kind of ram works , etc..	St
1.16.1	Quick search on the internet for Maxtor 90840D5 : 8.4GB 33.3MB/s = ATA/33 ( Ultra ATA 33MB/s ) Buffer ( cache ) Size : 256KB Rotational Speed : 5400rpm This means that it is extremely likely that you will have a BIOS problem with upgrading the current machine with a larger HD .	St
1.16.2	You will be limited to an 8.4GB or 32GB maximum HD with the motherboard .	St
1.16.3	http : //www.seagate.com/support/kb/disc/capacity/index.html Today 's mainstream PC drives are : Much larger ( typically 80GB to 400GB ) ATA/100 , ATA/133 , SATA 150 , SATA 300/II 8MB cache or larger 7200rpm or faster I think you are wise not to upgrade , but start anew .	St
1.16.4	Either buy new or build .	St
1.16.5	Everyone I know who builds one finds it to be quite rewarding ( myself included ) .	St
1.16.6	For the most part , they do n't want to buy a prebuilt machine ever again , unless it is a fantastic deal .	St
1.17.1	google : ''build your own pc '' Search CNet forums : ''build your own '' The first thing you need to ask yourself is how you will use the computer .	Sug
1.17.2	Gaming , high-end gaming , video editing , graphic design , programming , word processing browsing and email , general use , accounting , CAD , etc .	St
1.17.3	That will lead you to a CPU choice .	St
1.17.4	Everything will start to fall into place when you search for a motherboard that is compatible with your CPU .	St
1.17.5	If you have never even upgraded a PC before , you need to do a little reading .	St
1.17.6	You can do this online or get a book like this one : http : //www.dummies.com/WileyCDA/DummiesTitle/productCd-0471767727.html ( No insult intended with the ''Dummies '' book .	St
1.17.7	They are fantastic resources . )	St
1.17.8	If you want recommendations for websites that have good step-by-step instructions on what to do , I strongly suggest creating a new discussion ( the green button ) , rather than burying that request in this discussion about hard drives .	St
1.17.9	You will get a lot of suggestions .	St
1.17.10	Make sure you post what you want to be able to do with your new computer .	St
1.17.11	Hope this helps .	St
1.18.1	I ahve googled and searched cnet , but Google gives me a bunch of sites from 98 and they do n't talk about compatibility .	St
1.18.2	Cnet 's build your own computer did n't talk about a motherboard .	St
1.19.1	Found this discussion interesting , and may someday soon be faced with the same situation .	St

1.19.4	I have a Dell Dimension 8200 with a 40gb drive and a little interest adding another drive and also maybe building my own system some day .	St

1.21.1	I 'm old school in that I 'm used to seeing the multiple pin ( 39 pins ) connection on hard drives .	St
1.21.2	I recently bought a new Dell and thought I would take a 160GB drive I had in a drawer and upgrade the machine but when I opened it up it was clear from the size of the cable and the plug that there are far fewer pins required for the hard drive on this machine .	St
