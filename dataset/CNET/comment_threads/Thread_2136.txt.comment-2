60c or 140f is a little hot for the motherboard and cpu, but it is not going to blow up!
The components are just not going to last as long as if they where running cooler.
Download the program EVEREST it is free.
The best way to find it is to google, Everest home edition.
Run it to see what your temps are.
If they are high, pull the side case of your computer off and check the temps again in a hour or so and see what the temps are.
I have heard people say that could make it run hotter as that disrupts the air flow, but I don't find that to be true.
Try it and see.
As for the video card, I have a PNY 7600gs that runs 60c most of the time and that is well below the temp PNY says is too hot and will start causing problems.
