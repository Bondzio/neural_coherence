1.2.1	It's unclear how your network is configured.	St
1.2.2	But worth noting is that many put in firewalls and can't configure them.	St
1.2.3	I can't offer ANY support for a firewall since Zonelabs has their own support.	St
1.2.4	Your setup is unclear, the firewall effect seems to be indicated and I wonder what changed since it worked.	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	The only firewall I am using is the one with XP pro.	St
1.3.2	The high speed modem connects to my P4 via USB.	St
1.3.3	The P4 connects to the hub via ethernet as does the P2.	St
1.3.4	I used XP pro to set up the home network.	St
1.3.5	I can access messenger on the P4, no problem, but when I sign in on the P2 it just sits there.	St
1.3.6	I have tried to connect on the P2 after turning off the XP firewall (on the P4) but that doesn't work either.	St
1.3.7	The hub doesn't have a firewall.	St
1.3.8	Yahoo messenger works fine on the P2 & P4.	St

1.4.13	Yahoo messenger works fine on the P2 & P4.&quot; MSN Messenger has some &quot;other&quot; requirements.	St
1.4.14	ICS may or may not work in it's default setup, but to use MSN messenger networks, you can try using GAIM instead from http://gaim.sourceforge.net/ http://www.cyberwalker.net/columns/mar04/msn-messenger-audio.html gives us clues that MSN Messenger is not going to work all over.	St
