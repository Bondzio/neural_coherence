There are a lot of Laser printers out there, for a basic reasonably inexpensive one, look at Brother I saw one on sale, I believe at Office Depot for around 70.00 a couple of weeks ago.
As I said there are many manufacturers out there, it depends on what you are doing from a quantitative standpoint.
The best thing to do would be to go and look at a few and compare specifications, cost per page etc.
Best of luck!
