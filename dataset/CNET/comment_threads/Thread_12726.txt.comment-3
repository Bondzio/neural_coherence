I've been doing my PC Parts shopping at http://www.newegg.com ..
Excellent Service..great website..lots of info..great prices.. ..
I think BELKIN makes really great products and I use them..
So I would suggest you try the BELKIN Ext.
Enclosure.. ..
But recently I came across some discarded HDD's that I wanted to use..
I purchased from NEW EGG two External Enclosure KITS: ....EXT ENCLO ANYWARE[ME-325U2-SV RTL]....and I'm very surprised at the Excellent Quality for the PRICE.. ..
They loaded easily/did not need the enclosed CD..
I suggest you have USB 2.0/ Comes w/the CABLE..externally powered by 120vAC.
