Are you sure it's compatible with Windows XP? I've got my doubts. My suggestion is to find another (compatible) C-compiler or a another (compatible) OS, like MS DOS 6.0 or thereabout. But that might not run on current hardware. Kees

427	9	303629	2880722	2850959	Kees Bakker	10/13/08 4:30 AM	1.2238722E12	Sorry, but we don't do ...	homework and school assignments here. That's something you must do yourself: learning by doing. Be sure your program had a good way of handling: - empty input (just return) - invalid input (like @1A' or 877) - short input (like 0) unless, of course, you're allowed to interpret &quot;assumed&quot; or &quot;assume&quot; as &quot;There's no need to check it and the program may give erroneous result or reach an abnormal end if these precondition isn't met&quot;. Ask your teacher. A few more remarks: - The suggestion above of using an array is useful, but - given the order - not necessary. It should work without array also. - The assignment is about numbers (each on it's own line until you enter a negative one). Your input example is about digits (all on one line and ending with a non-digit). - Is it necessary to handle floating point numbers (like 3.14 or 3.14E13) or can it be assumed the numbers are positive integers?

Moreover, it's not clear if you mean c or c++ (that should make a difference for the coding you need). And can you tell more about what you mean &quot;make a command to printer&quot;. Please repost with this additions in Computer Help. Kees
