1.12.1	XFX is an excellent brand , so if you want the 256MB go for it but 256MB was not a reference design by nVidia for the 6600GT ( 128MB , however , was ) it does n't meant it wo n't work , it just means the RAM has been added for marketing reasons , it wo n't provide a speed benefit due to the 6600GT 's performance just consider , a 6600GT is n't slow , but it does n't kill any game at 1600x1200 , as in with all the settings maxed , the extra 128MB of RAM would help it if that were the case ( extra RAM means more room for textures , and resolution data , it keeps it from off-loading to the AGP or PCIE buffer , but that does n't happen that often ) a card like the 6800GT has 256MB because : A ) it 's targeted as a top end part and B ) it can make somewhat better use of it but in most tests comparing a 128MB card to a 256MB card , the performance increase ( if it 's using the same GPU ) is n't noticeable such as the X600Pro 128MB vs the X600Pro 256MB the performance difference is like 1 % if even	St
