i had the same problem with a gigabyte ga-8ik1100 p4 motherboard.
after removing everything it still would not beep or anything.
all that happened was that the cooling fans would turn on but that was about it.
i took all the components out and put them in another p4 computer that i have and all components worked fine so i replaced the motherboard and all is a ok now.
youll have to know also that this was the second time i replaced this gigabyte motherboard for the first one did the same thing, and i defiantly didnt replace it with another gigabyte motherboard.
btw they still make plenty of motherboards to replace the one you have and use all the components you have on that board, and for the best prices surf the internet and the motherboard reviews for the best boards and deals.
good luck, art
