with the modem connected to the lan port, there will be a conflict with the public and private ip addresses.
it won't operate properly in this configuration.
you should try: - turning off all devices (including modem) - turn on modem and allow it to sync (all lights indicating normal service) - connect modem to wan (internet) port on router, then turn it on.
- turn on pcs and test service.
if you still can't get it to work, you may need to contact your isp and inquire on proper settings you may need for your router.
