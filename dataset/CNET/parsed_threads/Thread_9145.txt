<s> hey guys quick question how come when i go play a game like FEAR or any other kind of new game with a auto detect performance thing it always puts my cpu at medium but i dont get that cause my CPU is brand new its a X2 4800+. </s>
<s> is it because it is only 2.4? </s>
<s> which brings me to my next question if intel has 3.6 and higher CPUs how come they are not better when the AMD only has 2.4 and 2.8 i think are the highest? </s>
<s> and higher clock speed does help gaming. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> if your mobo detects you processor correctly and its just the games you play that doesn't, there's the probability that those games weren't written with an ID of your new proc. </s>
<s> so it would just match it with the closest ID it can find. </s>
<s> AMD procs has a different architecture than Intel procs. </s>
<s> they don't crunch data the same way. </s>
<s> so its not really an apple to apple comparison. </s>
<s> the mobo sees the CPU right? </s>
<s> you can find that out on the POST (Power On Self Test) screen. </s>
<s> its first screen that pops out when you turn on your PC. </s>
<s> you should see your BIOS version, CPU info and available RAM there. </s>
