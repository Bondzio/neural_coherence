i pay the bill and it is in my name.
i am going to call them tomorrow and ask what the heck is going on.
i have a feeling though that at&t is going to send me the 2nd level internet support that i have to pay for, which i refuse to do.
they send me there just to configure my email for my browser.
thanks for your responses.
oh another thing should i have my network set at public or private.
