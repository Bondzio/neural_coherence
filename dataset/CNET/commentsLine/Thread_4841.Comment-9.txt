thanks!
my cpu is an intel pentium d socket 755. the pc is an hp media station m7170n that i use primarily for video editing.
(adobe premiere pro; adobe after effects, adobe audition, adobe encore, and photoshop.)
if by price range you mean what i'm willing to spend on a heatsink, then i think i have to spend what it takes to get my system back working - within reason.
it looks like most heatsinks are under $100.
thanks, dan
