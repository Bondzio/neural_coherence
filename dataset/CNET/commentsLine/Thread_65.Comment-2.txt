first off you need a large enough tower to support a grafhics card & lot's of ventilation & an extra chassis fan.
you don't need all that lighting outside the case unless you just want to have it for a great looking desktop.
alot of gamers out there love having it fancy if it's in your budget.
get a large psu to support the grafhics card memory & cpu.
get a board that will supports athlon dual cpu or pentium & lots of memory.
some out there don't like athlon from all the review's i've read but i have to pc's with it & have no complaints.
memory,cpu,grafhics card & psu ia the key word here.
get a good graphics card as well.
you will need a good grafhics card to play good quality games.
keep it updated often.
more will come in here & add more info if i missed some.
happy building & play safe!
