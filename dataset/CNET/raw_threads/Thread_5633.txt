If so, follow those. Most CRTs are glass or coated glass. Regular glass cleaners using a soft cloth without rubbing will usually work fine. Some camera lens cleaners might also be good to take away small fingerprints. Again...soft cloth such as for use on glasses or lenses should be ok. Avoid strong solvents, of course, and stick with mild surfactants where grease and oil are a problem. Maybe some coaching for your daughter might help if she's old enough to understand.

8356	5	117561	1335632	1334786	Willy	8/2/05 8:15 AM	1.1229705E12	Glass cleaner	Use just about any &quot;glass cleaner&quot; to wipe a glassed monitor. Best, to apply to cloth or rag instead of directly on monitor surface, then wipe. HOWEVER, if you monitor is really a LCD type, don't do this, buy the required special wipes or cleaner for that purpose. tada -----Willy
