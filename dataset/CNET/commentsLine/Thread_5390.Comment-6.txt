i solved my problem of upgrading my psu, bigger case!
after going to tom's hardware and doing research there about the video card i want, i seriously started thinking of just getting a different case.
i don't know why i balked at that.
since i'm self taught about working with my pc thanks to the excellent forums and websites on the net, that was just one area i overlooked.
don't know why,when that is such a simple why to go, because my case is a pain.
any video card i did get would have to be smaller physically to fit inside,(which i forgot to mention) so problem solved!
why is it sometimes the simplest things never cross our minds?
thank you for the help, faerie
