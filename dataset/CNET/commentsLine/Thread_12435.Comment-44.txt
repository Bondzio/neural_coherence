as what is &quot;critical&quot; to one user isn't to a multitude of others.
the issue boils down to the simple fact that it is cosmetic and not any actual symptom of problems with the drive.
a man bought a rolls and christened it sir churchill with a bottle of french champagne.
his neighbor bought a continental and christened it mr. lincoln with a bottle of napa valley champagne.
another neighbor bought a ford f150 and christened it teddy roosevelt (the rough ridin' sob) with a bottle of pabst blue ribbon.
all were satisfied but the f150 is still running strong while the other two spend their lives in critical care facilities.
