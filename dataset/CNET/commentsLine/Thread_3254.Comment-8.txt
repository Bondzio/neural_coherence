i appreciate the help and although i have a temporary fan in place to cool this chip i have orderd the fan you recommended.
it is available at ncix.com and very reasonable see link:  i have already installed the heatsink and the lowest temperature i can get is still 63c, i suspect there's a problem with the heat sensor, because it is not too hot to touch i already have coolers on my ram sticks, but appreciate the advice.
thank you so much for the help
