I'm looking for a better hard drive too.
=].
The E310 only has an 80gb one, and I have no clue if some of them are compatible with my computer, what kinds are good.
This one seems good to me, but I don't know.

lol....Thank You.
I don't need a massive HD, but it would be nice to have around 250-320gb.
