I just built a PC with SATA.
It has a thiner wire and is quiet.
It is the way to go.
With the default drivers etc.
it had a weird look in &quot;Device Manager&quot;.
It had some kind of crosslinked thing.
The speed of data transfer was unbelievably fast.
Then I updated everything.
The BIOS, the motherboard chipset, and everything else I could find.
It looks normal now in &quot;device manager&quot; but now I'm lucky to get above ATA66 speeds out of it.
