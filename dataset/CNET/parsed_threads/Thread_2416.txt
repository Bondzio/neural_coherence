<s> I did a full restore of my IBM ThinkPad Laptop. </s>
<s> Everything went fine with this, but when Windows boots up my mouse does not work. </s>
<s> I have tried plugging in an external mouse, but this does not seem to work either. </s>
<s> When you first boot up the computer you can got into a program called &quot;Access IBM&quot; (basically a pre-installed computer diagnostic program). </s>
<s> In this program that mouse works fine, however as soon as Windows boots up the mouse does not respond to anything Can anyone please help? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Your mouse does not work, but you plug in an external mouse and it doesn't work. </s>
<s> What kind of mouse does not work? </s>
<s> - How exactly did you do the 'full restore'? </s>
<s> - PS/2 mouse, USB mouse or both don't work (worth a try if you only checked one type) Kees </s>
<s> The computer is a laptop. </s>
<s> The touchpad mouse doesn't work. </s>
<s> And when I tried to plug a USB mouse in it lights up, but does not work either. </s>
<s> Its an IBM Laptop and IBM has a system program loaded that you can get to before windows opens. </s>
<s> I did a full restore from that program. </s>
<s> I'm thinking this has to be an operating system issue...? </s>
<s> Have you gone to Mouse/Touch Pad Properties (in Control Panel) and looked at the settings? </s>
<s> I'm well familiar with IBM laptops (I've had 5) and the restoral partition. </s>
<s> But I've never heard of your problem. </s>
<s> You might go to the IBM site http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/product.do?template=%2Fproductselection%2Flandingpages%2FhotNewsLandingPage.vm&sitestyle=lenovo&validate=false and input the laptop specs. </s>
<s> Look for updated drivers. </s>
<s> (immediately after, I mean) this shouldn't be an OS issue. </s>
<s> The next thought is a hardware issue. </s>
<s> It will be interesting to see how this is finally solved. </s>
<s> Keep us posted please. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> The reason I feel like this is an OS issue is because the IBM program that I get to before Windows opens recognizes my mouse. </s>
<s> The mouse works and I go into BIOS and it shows the mouse as being disabled. </s>
<s> Weird situation... </s>
<s> Thanks so much for trying to help! </s>
<s> should been seen by Windows. </s>
<s> So (if you really mean the BIOS-setup) that fits. </s>
<s> It's much stranger that another (non-Windows program) sees it, despite the BIOS-settings. </s>
<s> Something is wrong here. </s>
