Bob, I actually have a home network using a Cat5 crossover, and using MS ICS, and this does all I require.
It is a friend who recently connected to broadband, and her husband complains that she now hogs their computer.
So he asked me, if he buys a laptop, could he share the ADSL connection, using a simple splitter, and without buying more hardware.
I told him that I had heard of additional IP addresses provided by some ISPs, probably not free.
