it shuts off when playing some of the higher end games not when i play like c&c, half life, etc... as for shutting down while not playing games, sometimes.
when you run quite a few programs at a time, sometimes it will sometimes it wont.
but if just letting it run, no.
i ran limewire and let it go all night, got up in morning, never shutdown.
ive tried contacting ati about this issue but every time i call there number is busy, and i've already registered my card online, i dont know where else to turn to.
thanks again
