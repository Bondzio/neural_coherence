<s> Sorry, I'm reposting my question here too, because it's related to my wireless card in notebook problem... </s>
<s> I hope someone will be able to help me fix my problem... </s>
<s> I have a COMPAQ 2100 Notebook. </s>
<s> Recently, I installed a D-Link wireless card [AirPlus.G DWL-G630] and it was working fine. </s>
<s> One day, I decided to see how will the connection work outside my appartment; at school. </s>
<s> Well, as soon as I inserted the D-Link card, a msg popped up saying smt about Windows, I cannot recall exactly what and seconds later the screen went blue with a long message about a recently installed drive etc. </s>
<s> So, as I later found out, I had to go to the D-Link website and install the last version of the drive. </s>
<s> [BTW, when I came back home I had no problems with the comp.!] </s>
<s> I installed it and everything was fine even outside my building. </s>
<s> About 10 days later, I started having problems at home. </s>
<s> Very slow response to action, frozen screen with the mouse moving but unable to click and finally the blue screen thing AGAIN! </s>
<s> I read online about someone having the same problem and installed updates for my COMPAQ 2100. </s>
<s> Nothing changed. </s>
<s> Today, I finally decided to remove D-Link and couple other things. </s>
<s> I ran the Registry Mechanic, Hijackthis, Ad-ware and stuff like that, even Clean up. </s>
<s> I kept having the same problem. </s>
<s> After the blue screen the computer reboots and can never fully reload. </s>
<s> It either stops at a certain point frozen or when I try to press F8 it wouldn't respond and continue until some point. </s>
<s> I also tried to run the Safe Mode but it wouldn't do it. </s>
<s> The Last Good Version thing did not work... </s>
<s> I just turn it off, let it cool down and try again. </s>
<s> It starts running fine until a certain point when it grows lazy, freezes and gives me the finger [blue screen and all that sh... crap all over again]. </s>
<s> Sorry for the long explanation. </s>
<s> Hope someobody will suggest something useful Thanks in advance, Attila </s>
<s> can be a sign of failing hardware. </s>
<s> The first place I would look is to the hard drive. </s>
<s> A boot to your XP cd (didn't see your OS in the post), and into the Recovery Console. </s>
<s> From there I would run CHKDSK C: /R from the command prompt. </s>
<s> I gave it away and no one else could make it work. </s>
<s> Sometimes you get a dud. </s>
<s> Try another make/model. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I also have a D-Link 630 adapter card with same syptoms you have on my Sony Vaio. </s>
<s> I could not get mine to work correctly and found posts on various forums with everybody having the same problem with d-link cards and USB adapters. </s>
<s> Uninstall your drivers. </s>
<s> Accect your loss and Buy a new card or USB adapter of a different brand. </s>
<s> I bought a Netgear adapter card WG511 and it works great. </s>
<s> No problems with my network or anybody elses. </s>
<s> You can usually catch them onsale for around 30 dollars. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> Yep. </s>
<s> It was a sign of a hard disk failure. </s>
<s> I've had my Compaq for 2 yrs now. </s>
<s> The 2yr warranty just expired... a month ago! </s>
<s> : ((((( I bought a new HD... Thanx anyways! </s>
