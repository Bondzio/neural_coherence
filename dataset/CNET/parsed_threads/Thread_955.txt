<s> I have a netgear router that was the gateway to a lan of three home pcs running windows xp SP2 pro on two and one home dition SP2. </s>
<s> I actually don't know what triggered it of but one morning the xp home computer with VIA Rhine II ethernet decided it would not reconnect to my LAN. </s>
<s> I've tried every thing?? </s>
<s> Restored, given static IP, Uninstalled and re-installed the hardware, updated drivers, run microsoft patches, changed from auto negotiate to 10T full duplex, pulled out my hair etc.. </s>
<s> I can see my LAN as connected, but can't connect to the internet. </s>
<s> I use my usb modem to connect now, which means the other two computers are off-line. </s>
<s> I've set up networks for small organizations previously, but I concede this time and need help. </s>
<s> I can't ping my router sometimes it actually doesn't time out on all requests and returns between 50 to 80% success. </s>
<s> If anyone out there can help I'd be grateful. </s>
<s> Clean out all viruses and spyware. </s>
<s> Test. </s>
<s> Download and run WINSOCKXPFIX.EXE on that computer. </s>
<s> Test. </s>
<s> Try a different network cable. </s>
<s> Try a different network adapter. </s>
<s> tried every thing but a new adapter! </s>
<s> was hoping i wouldnt have to replace this but i'm quite sure it would work if i did cos many people ok a few have had issues with the VIA rhine and say they could connect after reducing to 10 full duplex speed. </s>
<s> but sadly that didn't work for me either! </s>
<s> I do givw network support to a couple of small companies but this is the first time i have conceded defeat and opted to change a component! </s>
<s> it wouldn't install clients and tcp ip version 6 either! </s>
<s> its how should i say... buggered! </s>
<s> We had five computers using that onboard card and I had to replace four of them because of connectivity problems. </s>
<s> As soon as the card were disabled and a new Nic installed, the problems were gone. </s>
