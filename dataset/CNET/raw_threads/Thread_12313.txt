You still hadn't explain your problem does the monitor work? Have you tried anything yet? Is the monitor cable at the monitor side or at the video port? If not, you maybe able to return cable provide no real physical damage is done, just loose. Otherwise, disassemble the back cover and see what's what, again only if you're capable. Get back. tada -----Willy

Fortunately, you can buy a graphics card or basic monitor card and put one in. HOWEVER, I won't say there wasn't any damage to the motherboard itself further than where the port got yanked from but if you are lucky, there isn't. Paul

You will need to &quot;disable&quot; the build-in mtrbd. video and install a new video card. The new card should contain instructions for all this or at its support website. Place electrical tape to prevent the video port from moving to possibility cause a short or whatever, just keep it from moving. tada -----Willy
