I cannot connect to other computers on my network. I have run the network setup wizard many times, and the computer is on the same workgroup as the others. Also, I cannot access the internet. The version of Windows I installed did not include SP 1 or 2. The network adapter is 3Com Etherlink XL 10/100 PCI For Comple PC Management NIC (3C905C-TX), according to Device Manager. System Specs: AMD K6-2 300mhz 128mb RAM ATi Rage 128 Pro 4gb HDD w/ Windows 40gb HDD extra storage

I'd advise you to restart the other computers you have on your network (don't ask why!). Hopefully you should get some network connectivity. If the other comp's are ok then don't update their drivers!

I then noticed on the computer that was having problems connecting to the network said there is an IP conflict. I shut down that computer and the internet worked fine on the other. So, to fix this do I just do ipconfig/renew?

I currently have both computers running and the internet and network works fine now. Thanks for the help.
