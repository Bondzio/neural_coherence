<s> Hi, I was able to port forward for a long time until I got a new modem from comcast. </s>
<s> I never had to mess with the router settings until I recently found out that I couldn't port forward any more. </s>
<s> When I try port forwarding on the router website(10.0.0.1), I get an error message that states&quot;Server IP Address isn't in LAN IP address subnet!&quot; What I enter: Common Services: Other Other Service: Minecraft Server Type:TCP/UDP Server IP Address: 192 168 1 13 (My IPv4 address) Starting Port: 25565 Ending Port: 25565 Any help would be appreciated! </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> It should not work. </s>
<s> I fear you have not read enough about IP networking but change your server at 192.168.1.13 to something in the 10.0.0.x range. </s>
<s> Maybe x is 13? </s>
<s> 10.0.0.x is your LAN. </s>
<s> 192.x.x.x is not. </s>
