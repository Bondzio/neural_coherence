The seagate Hard Drive in my Dell dimension 4400 is starting to die, I run winxp, and I'm getting alot of errors on the drive, and scandisk wont complete because it says it encountered an unsepcified error. I then downloaded HDD Heath amd Hard Drive inspectior, both told me that my HD was at crtical temperatures (around 127*F or 52*C) I'm looking to replace the hard drive, but because I've never done it before I am clueless. I would lke to be able to transfer all my data and programs from this drive to the new one, but I dont know if its possible or even if I should considering the errors. If I cant tranfer, does that mean I must buy a full copy of winxp also? If anyone can help explain how I could got about this, I would appreciate it greatly. -pcf

Since I don't duplicate web content here (that would be duplicative) I suggest you look at the drive maker web sites and their install instructions. Bob

If I get any errors, even one, I replace it since you have no idea when it will die on you. My suggestion is to buy a new drive and install it in the computer. Then install your system while the other drive is not plugged in at all. Once your new system is up and running, plug the old one in as a slave so the new one still boots. Then copy everything you need over. If you need help with these steps just let me know and I will be more detailed on what ever steps you need help.

Maxtor comes to mind as I have used theirs on several occasions. But I'd be real concerned about why the drive was running hot. Unless you fix that you'll be doing this all over again.
