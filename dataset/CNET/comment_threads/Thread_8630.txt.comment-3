My bad.
I was actually asking the minimum I would need just to run the cards themselves, but here are the specs.
to the best of my knowledge: 3.0 GHz Pentium 4 Prescott w/ HT and 800fsb, 1GB PC-4000 DDR2 500MHz ram, dual 36.7GB Western Digital Raptor 10000rpm HDDs (raid 0), Sound Blaster Audigy 2 ZS sound card, [soon to be] dual GeCube x300 256mb video cards, 8x dvd-rw, 16x dvd drive, 56x drive, 3.5&quot; floppy, multimedia keyboard, Intellimouse 4.0 wireless mouse.
