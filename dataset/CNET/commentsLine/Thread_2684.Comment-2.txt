&quot; i then tried the software(ezburning) came with dell, the software complained that it can not find any dvd writer divice.
&quot; while you missed one item on your post, the make/model of the laptop my bet is the ezburning software is locked to the make/model of the drive that came with the dell.
if you just need data dvd recording, try what i use -&gt;  in closing, my external wasn't that stable until xp sp2 bob
