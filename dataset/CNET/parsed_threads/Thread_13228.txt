<s> My post is a little lengthy but I was hoping for some help. </s>
<s> My wife works from home and has her laptop set up in the office via Verizon DSL. </s>
<s> I have attempted to hook up my Emachine PC throught the same modem but the network connection continues to flash that a connection is &quot;unplugged&quot;. </s>
<s> It will conneczt than disconnect and continue to flash that way. </s>
<s> My initial phone call to Verizon led to me having my PC looked at by Geek Squad at Best Buy. </s>
<s> The GS did a diagnostic check up ($90.00) and they demonstrated that the PC does connect to the internet via the ethernet connection. </s>
<s> I returned home and expereinced the same network connection problem. </s>
<s> I have been back and forth w/GS and been in Verizon tech support purgatory. </s>
<s> I have tried everything-disconnected my wife's laptop, changed ethernet cables etc.. the blame game continues until finally GS suggested purchasing a new modem. </s>
<s> Can anyone offer any suggestions? </s>
<s> I am at a loss! </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>
<s> dsl does not connect to the computer modem, but the ethernet connection. </s>
<s> I think bestbuy connected it to the correct ethernet connection with an ethernet wire and you're trying to connect it to the computer modem? </s>
<s> What you do is you plug in the telephone line to your dsl modem. </s>
<s> Then get an ethernet wire and connect that to your pc's ethernet port. </s>
<s> ROger </s>
<s> Sounds like you need a BROADBAND ROUTER. </s>
<s> It will allow more than one computer to share the Internet service. </s>
<s> Does your DSL modem also have a built-in router? </s>
<s> If not you could benefit from a broadband router box. </s>
<s> We charge $20 at Staples and refund ur money if we can repair it. </s>
<s> Anyways, you need a router for that. </s>
<s> Unless you have one built it to your modem. </s>
<s> Upon initial install the verizon software might put certain items on the PC that set it up. </s>
<s> It's been awhile but you enter a lot of information to get it working. </s>
<s> My point is without a Router your wifes PC might have this information on it and your desk top doesnt so it's not recognizing your PC as being legit. </s>
<s> I use a 4 port wired router and 2 PC are connect constantly with a 3rd work PC connected occasionally. </s>
<s> I have not problems with this setup and was the best $50 I ever spent because the router is a SPI firewall. </s>
<s> Thank you for all of your responses! </s>
<s> Yes, I did pay $90.00 for the diagnostic but I may hound Verizon for a refund of the money because I feel there was noting wrong w/ my PC in the first place. </s>
<s> Just to clarify: I have a Westell Versalink Model 327W that Verizon provided as a part of the service. </s>
<s> It has four ports in the back where I have attempted to run both the PC and laptop ethernet cables. </s>
<s> As explained my wifes laptop runs like a dream but all attempts to set up my PC have failed. </s>
<s> My emachine is a C1641 and I again tried to connect to the internet yesterday but the network connection would connect and then disconnect stating the network cable is unplugged. </s>
<s> Looks like I'll take the advice of the posters and get a broadband router or four port wire router. </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
<s> I had that wicked problem a few months back. </s>
<s> First off, the ethernet card, NIC, in the PC: Is it internal or is it on a PCI card. </s>
<s> Maybe try switching. </s>
<s> I had to get a cheap NIC for PCI 'cause my internal one died on me. </s>
<s> Also: Do you have floresceunet (The spelling fairy is going to kill me) light bulbs? </s>
<s> I had the weirdest thing happen. </s>
<s> With the lights on: The modem WOULD work, with the lights OFF it would not. </s>
<s> A pain, and a high electric bill. </s>
<s> I ended up moving the PC. </s>

<s> What about an Ethernet Hub? </s>
<s> If so do I need both a hub and a router? </s>
<s> You want a router. </s>
<s> Some broadband modems (Cable or DSL) also have a built-in router. </s>
<s> What is the make & model of your DSL modem? </s>
<s> Typical broadband routers for a small office/home office have a built-in 4-port switch (an intelligent hub) to connect 4 computers to form a small network and another port (WAN port) to connect to the broadband modem. </s>
<s> Once the modem is connected to the router, all computers connected to the router will be able to share the broadband modem. </s>
<s> This is the essence of a router--it connects one network (your home computers) to another network (the rest of the Internet). </s>
<s> A hub cannot do this! </s>
<s> A typical wireless router has the 4 port switch and adds the ability of making multiple wireless connections. </s>
<s> It also has some security measures such as a firewall. </s>
<s> If your DSL modem doesn't have a built-in router, look at wireless-g broadband routers from Linksys, D-Link and Netgear. </s>
<s> I bought a Linksys Speedbooster 802.11 Wireless Broadband router. </s>
<s> Will that hopefully help me out? </s>
<s> a good Wireless Router for what you are looking for. </s>
<s> ~Ibrahim~ p.s. </s>
<s> Please correct me if I'm wrong: It is what (s)he is looking for? </s>
<s> Yes, I hope this solves my PC/laptop problem. </s>
