so, it seems i wasted my money on the dual band capability - although in all the reviews i read about this router, none of them mentioned the compatibility of the network adapter.
two of my laptops, however, are 802.11n and say &quot;dual band&quot; - however, i can't get either of them to recognize the 5 ghz range either.
