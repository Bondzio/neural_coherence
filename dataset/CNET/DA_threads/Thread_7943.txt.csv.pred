1.1.1	I have an HP Compaq dc7800 Small Form Factor computer with a built in Intel Q35.	St
1.1.2	I'm trying to install an ASUS EAH4350 SILENT graphics card.	St
1.1.3	Without the card in, the computer boots up completely fine, running Windows Vista with 2gigs of ram.	St
1.1.4	The ASUS card uses a PCI Express slot, but once the card's plugged in, and I power up the computer, it will beep 6 times in sequence with a red light flashing on the front, stop for a second, then start beeping again.	St
1.1.5	The start up HP screen won't run either.	St
1.1.6	Any idea on how to install it with it working?	St
1.1.7	Any help would be greatly appreciated.	St
1.2.1	That box looks to have a very small power supply.	St
1.2.2	Ask HP and ASUS if the power supply is big enough.	St
1.2.3	My thought is it's power related.	St

1.3.1	here is a list of the Intel beep codes, scroll down to where it explains the '6 beeps' http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/cs-010249.htm	St
1.4.1	Is there a way besides a PSU calculator to figure out how much extra power I have or would be needed to run this card?	St
1.4.2	As in an actual application in Windows or something?	St
1.4.3	The entire reason I want to in include this card is because while playing the Sims 3, the screen will go black, but comes back darker than before.	St
1.4.4	When the Sims is minimized, a warning triangle will appear in the notification area saying that the display driver crashed but has successfully recovered (or something or the sort) so I figured that a new graphics card would be the solution.	St
1.5.1	Other manufacturers websites suggest a minimum 300 watt power supply for their HD4350's, you also have to take in consideration that your PC is a 'small form factor', so write down the measurements of your power supply, and compare that to the size of new ones.	St
1.6.1	Docuument page discussing installing various graphic cards and what to do.	St
