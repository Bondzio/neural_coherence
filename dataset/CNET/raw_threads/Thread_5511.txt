As others have mentioned, you won't be able to play DVD's without a video decoder installed. This utility will list the installed decoders: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=DE1491AC-0AB6-4990-943D-627E6ADE9FCB&displaylang=en If you don't have a decoder, and you don't want to spend money on one, then try VLC Player. Try Deleting UpperFilters and LowerFilters. Don't get hung up on the fact you don't have Roxio Easy CD Creator. I follow the manual instructions. Just do it. http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314060
