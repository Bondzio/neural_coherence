1.1.1	I have an internal DSL modem that has internet connection sharing enabled and a network switch connecting it to the other computers in the house, and my xbox.	St
1.1.2	However, I can't get my xbox live to work.	St
1.1.3	I input the DNS server values that my isp gave me.	St
1.1.4	Every time I try to connect it comes up with an error that says &quot;network services (DHCP or PPoE) were not found&quot; i know that i do not have a PPoE dsl connection.	St
1.1.5	Help me please.	St
1.2.1	Tell the make/model of the router.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	It is actually not a router it is a network switch, here is the info: it is a Belkin 5 port switch	St
1.4.1	A switch will not work unless you pay up for a second IP address from your ISP.	St
1.4.2	It's about 30 to 50 bucks a month so most go get the router.	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	Why can I access the internet from the other computers connected to the switch without paying for the extra ip's?	St
1.5.2	also How would I use a router if I have an internal DSL modem that cannot be connected directly to a router?	St
1.5.3	Thanks so much for your help.	St
1.6.1	You are likely pilfering some addresses and they will shut you down if they find out.	St
1.6.2	Best of luck figuring it out.	Polite
