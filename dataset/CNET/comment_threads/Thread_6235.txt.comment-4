remove your video card and try booting your pc.
if it beeps, the motherboard is functioning (to some degree).
if it doesn't the mobo is dead.
assuming the mobo is working, find a friend who'd be willing to let you put the video card into their pc (to test if its working).
if circuit city is in your area, get this card geforce 6200 http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/EVGA-E-GeForce-6200-Video-Card-128-A8-N339-LX-/sem/rpsm/oid/153130/catOid/-13011/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do and pop it into your PC.
you can always return it if it doesn't work and its only $30 after rebate.
