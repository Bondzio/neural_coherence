You need a true load whether it be the actual mtrbd.
or a &quot;dummy load&quot; sold for that purpose.
http://www.pcpowerandcooling.com shows such a device.
Other vendors offer it as it as well, probably called an ATX p/s dummy/load tester.
I believe http://www.computergeeks.com has it as well.
good luck -----Willy
