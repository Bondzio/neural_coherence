looking at your sound blaster from the back of the computer the far right plug is the digital out jack.
it supplies a digital signal via an 1/8&quot; plug and your stereo supplies the dsp (digital signal processor).
if you go with computer speakers the sound blaster will handle the dsp.
basically digital is a rehash of an old idea where more than one channel of music is present.
remember quadrophonic stereos of the late sixties and early seventies?
this time around you only need a right and left channel each with a digital signal and a processor recreates the multiple channels based on the digital information.
every listener has different tastes in what sounds good to them.
for instance i like a lot of high end in my music whereas some folks find it to crisp that way.
i also like a deep rich bass and some folks find that annoying.
my best advice is visit a brick and mortar store with displays set up and find one that suits your ears then try to duplicate the setup at home.
keep in mind that sounds are effected by space and objects in that space, so it may not sound the same at home.
the good news is your sound blaster can recreate a wide range of spaces to try to mimic different settings.
good luck
