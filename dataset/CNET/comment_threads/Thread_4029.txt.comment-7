I too have a IBM T40 , I too have some problems, when I first have it,but I went found out there is a IBM RESCUE & RECOVER DISKS I can buy , which it erase and reformat the whole hard drive, the IBM BIOS and all,no more spyware or virus unexplain problems,great product, after I've install the disks, then went on IBM web site down load all the latest BIOS and driver and programs updates, everything run smooth like silk.
let me know if you want to give a try, I can get one for you cheap,(I am not a sales man or in it for $ ) so good luck if you have your problems fix.
