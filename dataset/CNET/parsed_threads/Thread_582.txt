<s> Hi, I have an old G3 powerbook, I am wondering if a Travelstar 15GN (10MB) should work with it? </s>
<s> It does not appear to recognise the disk (or any of a couple of others I have got lying around) but it boots ok from a CD and recognises RAM etc. </s>
<s> any info appreciated cheers Brian </s>
<s> the Travelstar should work if it is connected correctly. </s>
<s> Are you sure that it is a 10MB drive? </s>
<s> If it is, trash it. </s>
<s> Boot from the CD with the drive installed and see if you can see it with the Disk Utility/Hard Drive Utility. </s>
<s> It may be formatted strangely and just needs reinitialising. </s>
