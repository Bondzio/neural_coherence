hi there, my additional keys on my keyboard is all mixed up, the usual ones still work normally, but the media keys, hot keys, and the f-keys are all mixed up into each other, such as when i press stop in the mdia keys, it turns out to run previous track, and when i press itouch, it turns out to be decreasing the volume.
pls help as soon as possible.
if any info were needed, pls say so, i'm using win xp pro
