My computer is in my office while the closest cable outlet is in the living room. So, right now I have to run a cable along the baseboard down the hallway. I was wondering if a wireless network would allow me to get rid of this wire. Im not familiar with this type of network so I dont know exactly how they work. Is it possible for the wireless access point and the modem to be in the other room and not physically connected to any computer at all using a wireless NIC? One more thing... I want to get rid of the wire for my X-Box as well. This is another wire I have to run down the hall back into the living room. Currently I use an extra NIC in my PC to connect it. If possible, I want the X-Box and PC to share the access point so I don't have to use my PC as a hub anymore. Thank you.

The XBox has it's own model &quot;gaming adapter&quot; which I will provide an example... http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?grid=33&scid=38&prid=550 Bob

Looking into it a bit more, I may go with the Motorola wireless G router for the PC but still wire up the X-Box since it will only be a few feet away. That way I could save about $80 by not buying the gaming adapter. I was given a Motorola Surfboard cable modem and it's been great so far. I figured I would just stay with Moto since the modem has been solid... or do you think I should go with a Linksys wireless router? The Moto to my surprise was $10 less.

They tend to drop out and you won't get a firmware update or such. Linksys/Cisco on the other hand... it's their primary business. For 10 bucks I'd get the linksys. Bob

I followed the directions to the T and followed your advise on connecting the PC to the router with an ethernet cable first. I got the router working, I unhooked the cable, installed the NIC card, and everything is beautiful. I'm getting 54 Mbps as my connection and I am delighted. It seems to be running great and I'm gonna test it with a few games later tonight to push it a bit. Thank you for your help.
