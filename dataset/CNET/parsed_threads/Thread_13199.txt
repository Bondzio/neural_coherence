<s> I have Charter internet and I have been losing internet connectivity so I decided to go with Bellsouth DSL thinking it was Charters problem. </s>
<s> Well when I was ordering Bellsouth DSL online they have a tool to see if your computer meets the requirements. </s>
<s> My computer passed everything except networking. </s>
<s> I got this message (malfunctioning nic found.) </s>
<s> What does this mean? </s>
<s> Is this why I am having internet trouble? </s>
<s> It is a Gateway computer running windows xp service pack 2. </s>
<s> The computer is about 2 years old. </s>
<s> Why not replace it? </s>
<s> http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=FA331-BULK-R&cat=NET is 4 bucks. </s>
<s> I see them on the shelf at not much more. </s>
<s> Finding out why will likely take a few hundred buck trip to a repair counter. </s>

<s> I like to add to what Robert mentioned, if you have a build-in nic, buy a nic card then install it. </s>
<s> Just disable the build-in nic before so. </s>
<s> It's easier to replace and as it was called a bad unit, it pretty much suggests what problem you had before as that's your link to the outside world. </s>
<s> Rerun the test after the install and check results. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> The technician said in order to replace the nic the motherboard has to be replaced! </s>
<s> They told me to back up anything I don't want to lose and they said I will most likely have to reinstall the operating system. </s>
<s> How do I do all of this? </s>
<s> They are coming Tuesday and I can't figure out how to backup anything! </s>
<s> As for reinstalling the operating system, are they talking about the recovery disks you make when you first run your new computer? </s>
<s> That is all I have, recovery disks. </s>
<s> I have a Gateway 5310s </s>
<s> For the 4 dollar fix you get into the BIOS, disable the onboard NIC, install the new NIC and drivers. </s>
<s> No one I know replaces a motherboard due to a bad NIC. </s>

<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=2050400027%201162810711&bop=And&Order=PRICE It's the one with the 4 buck cards at the top. </s>
<s> I thought I was posting a link with the lowest price listed first, but now I realize that my browser cookie was determining that and not the search criteria I used. </s>
<s> Thanks, Bob! </s>
<s> Inexpensive and a relatively easy install. </s>
<s> Hard to beat that fix. </s>
<s> I know this is a late reply, but needed to as for the &quot;tech response&quot; you got. </s>
<s> Unless, there's some magical nic involved(i don't think so), that tech is way off on replacing nic via the mtrbd.. </s>
<s> In most cases you can disable the onboard nic, install a new nic and go from there. </s>
<s> As for recovery or any back-up it just worth the money to buy a decent back-up s/w and proceed to do so. </s>
<s> Visit any local or online vendor and buy one. </s>
<s> Good s/w will back-up to just about any media, like CD, DVD, tape, and/or other HD or NAS drive(if applicable). </s>
<s> The recovery itself usually refers to the OS re-install disks, sometimes called restore disks. </s>
