I have a 2000 installation running with a IBM TFT monitor and a 4500 3dfx.
Finding drivers for the 2000 installation was difficult as the card is out of support.
I have WXP drivers built into the Win XP installation.
but not the 2000 installation.
I found some third party drivers that worked fairly well.
