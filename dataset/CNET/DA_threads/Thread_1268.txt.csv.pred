1.2.1	you have a 775 board and an AM2+ CPU, not compatible!	St
1.2.2	if you like the board, get a Core 2 Duo/Quad If yo like the processor, get an AM2+ board Also, if you like X3's check out the Phenom II 720, not on newegg yet though	St
1.3.1	So this will work with it?	St
1.3.2	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813135074	St
1.4.1	rather old, I have no idea whether ECS is good with BIOS updates http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813157149 will work with Phenom normal, not sure about Ph2	St
1.5.1	Best to with the platform .... CPU (AMD or Intel) and a motherboard that supports it.	St
1.5.2	Also give us a budget so we know what price range we're working with.	St
1.5.3	If AMD...look at something with a better user rating ...perhaps something like the one below Gigabyte Motherboard for AMD CPU: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128373 VAPCMD	St
1.6.1	also, you have an atx cae but a matx motherboard	St
1.7.1	since matx is smaller than atx, it is compatible.	St
