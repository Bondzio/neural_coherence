1.1.1	My new antec case has a 3 pin power LED female connector ( middle not wired ) .	St
1.1.2	The motherboard I 'm using ( ASUS ) has a 2 pin connector for the power LED .	St
1.1.3	Its on the end so I might be able to move a pin to the middle and still use the case connector , or I could solder in a two pin ; but I was wondering if anyone actually makes a jumper eg .	St
1.1.4	3 pin male to 2 pin female or two single females ?	Ques
1.1.5	Does it have a name if someone does make it ?	Ques

1.3.1	Antec 160B ASUS P5PE-VM	St
1.4.1	I looked at your motherboard manual and saw what you meant about PLED+ and PLED- pins being immediately next to one another .	St
1.4.2	I was n't able to confirm the configuration of the cable form the Antec 160B ( I could n't find the manual online ) .	St
1.4.3	Frontx.com sells different sizes of terminals , header connectors , and tools if you decide you need them : http : //www.frontx.com/order_c.html How to : http : //www.frontx.com/head_con.html	St
1.5.1	I moved one of the pins to the center position and it works fine .	St
1.5.2	Had n't done it before so I was a little nervous about damaging the pin insert , but it worked out OK .	St
1.5.3	If the pins had not been on the end , they do make single male on one end and female on the other so I could have gone that route .	St
1.5.4	Anyway thank you for responding .	Polite
1.5.5	Back to building .	St
1.5.6	Its a great case by the way .	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
