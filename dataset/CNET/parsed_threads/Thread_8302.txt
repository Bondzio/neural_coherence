<s> I have a host pc with DSL and a new Linksys wireless router for a brand new hp ze2000 notebook. </s>
<s> I can get either to recognize one another. </s>
<s> I get an icon on the desktop for 'notebook' but no ability to share files or printers. </s>
<s> I have tried many times unsucessfully to add a home network to no avail. </s>
<s> On the notebook it says that the Ethernet card/cable is not connected when it is. </s>
<s> Both units (including the wireless notebook) work perfectly with IE but just don't communicate. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> 1) workgroup names the same on both 2) file and print sharing enabled 3) something set to be shared (folder) 4) XPs firewall set to except file and print sharing No OS is mentioned, so only general help can be offered. </s>
