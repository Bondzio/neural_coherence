its known that you would not need to re install xp if the chipsets the same on each board but im not that worried about re installing the os, im very used to that!
im more concerned that i dont have any display on my monitor, no post beeps and (i think) no bios (dunno cos i cannot see) i even took the brand new agp graphics card back to the shop and exchanged it for a different brand name, i have came to the conclusion that the agp slot on the board is at fault (even though the board is brand new), all else seems to be powering up eg, optical drives,hard drives, keyboard and mouse, just have no display.
i did take anti-static precautions before touching anything inside the case, suppose i will just have to stick with 800mb cpu power until i get a new p4 board, my brother in-law is gonna give me a shot of a spare pci graphics card to try, so if that works then the agp slot is at fault for sure.
