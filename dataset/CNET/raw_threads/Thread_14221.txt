They requested that I check the attached mailing label. I didn't open for fear it was a virus.. I am, however expecting a package and wondering if this may related to that... somehow I doubt it.

While I'm sure I don't expect any package brought by Fedex from the USA to Europe. So just consider it malware. Very good not to click it. It's even better to not even open it. In case of doubt, I look at the source in Outlook Express. That doesn't open it in the regular sense. Kees
