1.1.1	I 'm using an Epson Stylus D88 on WinXP.I have some images I need to print by tomorrow but the black ink cartridge has run out , even though the images have no black in them the printer will not accept the files for printing because the black ink needs replacing.When this happened before I was given the option of switching to another mode where colours are combined to print any black content but I ca n't figure out how to set my printer to do this .	St
1.1.2	Is there anyway I can over ride the printers settings and get it to print red and blue images regardless of the fact the black cartridge is empty ?	Ques
1.1.3	Of course I could just get the black ink but it 's Sunday evening and I need the documents to be ready tomorrow morning .	St
1.1.4	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.2.1	Most printers count the pages and then decide the cartrige is empty .	St
1.2.2	You might try removing the cartrige and putting it back , then tell the printer you put in a new one .	Sug

1.3.1	I was handling a Epson Stylus 400 about 6 years ago , and it had an option of synthesizing black from the 3 colors .	St
1.3.2	If I remember right , this option was available in the epson icon on the control panel .	St
1.3.3	Of course , it was an Win95 OS .	St
1.3.4	Hope this helps .	St
1.4.1	I do not have an Epson , so I am not too sure , but at printer 's properties , is there an option for auto detect of color or manual detect ?	Ques
1.4.2	Or you may be able to shut down ink level monitoring ... .Or you can try removing the black ink catridge , reboot , put it back in , go to maintenance and reset the counter ... . ?	Ques
