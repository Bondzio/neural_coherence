Host to Linksys switch, switch to WAP (Buffalo AirStation WLA-L11G), WAP to wireless notebook XP Pro. Using ICS and File/Printer sharing due to nature of satellite internet connection which has USB modem and requires said modem to be plugged directly to host computer running the Direcway software, so switching to a router is not an option at this time. No problem accessing shared printer. I can send a 467KB jpeg saved on notebook harddrive to printer in a few seconds. I can copy and paste same image to host drive in a few seconds. I can save a webpage with images in a folder on notebook hardrive, and send folder (80KB) to host in a few seconds. So sending files to the printer is fast. Sending files to the host drive is fast. But when browsing the web on notebook and click to print the current webpage, it takes 5-10 minutes to send the page to the printer. Saving the page to harddrive, then opening saved web page and click to print does the same thing. What am I missing here that causes this?

You may want to research how to place an entry in your HOSTS file (not HOSTS.SAM!) to resolve the name of the print server. The outlook from here is that delays occur as Windows tries to find the printer server by name. You can help speed this up. Bob

It is only web pages that take so long to start printing.When using any other app, (such as notepad, wordpad, acrobat reader, Irfanview, etc) the job starts printing in a few seconds.

I'm not going to stress over it, it's not that big an issue. I can copy and paste to notepad any text I need, and send that to printer pretty quickly. I very rarely wish to print a whole web page, as is. It's just sort of irritating that it takes so long.
