Ok, the story goes, I bought this Epson C82 inkjet printer about 4 months ago.
Now I ran out of black awhile ago and bought some at a discount online and things have been fine.Until I ran out of magenta, now nothing is printing, so I replaced all with Epson C80 ink from Office Depot, still no printing, I cleaned the heads 5 times, did all mantenience and nothing.
So I thought it was the C80 ink.
So I bought C82 ink at a discount online and tried printing just a cover letter and all I got is just some streaks, then I tried a photo setting and I got a very faint and streaked print.Sooo, I called Epson Customer Service and they want to charge me $9 for their help, forget that, can anyone help, or do I have to pay the $9 for a phone call?
I want to throw this thing out the window, Help!
Thanks Mike
