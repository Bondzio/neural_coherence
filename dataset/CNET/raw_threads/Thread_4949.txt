I have 3 ASUS boards but not your model and mine all have RAID 0 and 1 capabilities. These controllers can be configured as regular IDE for HDs but not ATAPI devices. Your board should have come with a manual. If not, the ASUS web site is good about having these available on line so you can double check but I would say the answer is &quot;no&quot;.

You have to use the either the primary/secondary EIDE ports, not the raid ports. Unless, it is configuarble, then maybe and that's a big maybe. Your bios setting should explained in the manual or support website thier usage of all IDE ports. If you have 4 ide devices already installed, then consider what has to be swapped or gone in order to use your new drive. If you have small HDs, now is the time for a larger HD to complish the same mbs is not more. sorry... tada -----Willy
