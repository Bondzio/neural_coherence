can they share a file or printer?
yes.
however, if you have an ap with no security, then you've opened up your network.
handing out your ssid and wep keys to guest is not ideal either, from a security stand point.
you could put a printer in the &quot;dmz&quot; and have the guest come in on the dmz side.
just keep in mind that any thing you allow guest to access from the dmz, so can the rest of the world that is within rf range.
so that makes file sharing a wee bit difficult.
to keep the network secure, they will have to keep entering the mac, wep, and ssid.
