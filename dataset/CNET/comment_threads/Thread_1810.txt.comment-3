I just thought of an easier way to do this.
You must have the following information 1.
Static IP address (ex: 192.168.1.18) 2.
Subnet mask (ex: 255.255.255.0) 3.
DNS settings (you have them) 4.
Gateway address (ex: 192.168.1.1) Connect your wireless router to the Hotel's network using one of the 4 LAN ports.
Input the above information into the wireless card's IP configuration.
Connect to the wireless network and you should be on.
Let me know if this works.
