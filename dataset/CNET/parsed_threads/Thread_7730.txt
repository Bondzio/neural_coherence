<s> I want to get a (not too expensive) scanner for scanning in b+w negatives I'm taking for school (and probably color negatives in the future) but also for general scanning in documents etc. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> I know I once saw a scanner that was a regular scanner but then had a frame that you put negatives in and put that on the scanner bed, and it would automatically crop and resize all the negatives-is this a common feature or only available in higher price scanners? </s>

<s> I had to find it for you. </s>
<s> Look here and you'll be able to figure out, after research, what you need to do this. </s>
