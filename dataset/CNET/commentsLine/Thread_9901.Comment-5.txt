redrover, check drivers first .... then try to slow down the hwd acceleration.
display properties -&gt; settings -&gt; advance open troubleshoot tab -&gt; slow down hwd acceleration slider is in middle of window.
this happened to my main system after upgrade to geforce2 mx/mx400 video card and third monitor.
the effect was only on this card and attached monitor.
