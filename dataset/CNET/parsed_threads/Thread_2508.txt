<s> So basically I've recently brough a nice new gaming PC , the Acer predator g7200 it has 2.5Ghz , X2 ATI Radeon 4850's , 4GB ram, AMD Phenom 9850 Quad Core Processor. </s>
<s> BUT I recently downloaded counter strike and call of duty 4 and I get around 5-10 FPS? </s>
<s> What is wrong?. </s>
<s> I have tryed.. Disabling one of the graphics cards didnt work Updating all the drivers and processor drivers , operating system - which is Windows Vista 64-bit I have confirmed it is not my internet because I receive the same lag offline on single player or a private lobby of a game such as cod 4. </s>
<s> WHAT IS WRONG? </s>
<s> I desperetly need an answer. </s>
<s> This computer cost alot of money and I don't want it not to work within a week of buying it.. </s>
<s> Vista (the new Windows ME) could be it all on its own. </s>
<s> You should let the machine's maker know about this and ask them for one very important document. </s>
<s> Ready? </s>
<s> &quot;The Windows Install Plan.&quot; Given it's AMD based, it could be tricky. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> and/or the os needs a fresh install. </s>
<s> personally, i'd reset the bios to default settings and install win7 from scratch. </s>
<s> btw... that's not a high end pc. </s>
<s> phenom 9850 cpu is 2 years old... ditto for radeon hd4850s. </s>
<s> these were nice midrange components in 2008, but have been superseded by new generations (phenom x4 ii 900s and radeon hd5800s) and are definitely behind the curve now. </s>
<s> if you can, you should consider returning the pc. </s>
