I can see the folder on #1 computer. However on #2 computer it is not in &quot;My Computer&quot;. I want to be able to access the #1 C drive (folder) from computer #2. How do I do this? Both machines are WXP. Bill

Simply create an identical account on all machines, enable file and print sharing by running the network setup wizard on said machines, and then create shares.
