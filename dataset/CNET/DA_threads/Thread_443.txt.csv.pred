1.1.1	I have a requirement to be able to Write Protect an external hardrive .	St
1.1.2	We have unclassified data that we need to move to a classifed system .	St
1.1.3	The whole purpose of write protecting is to insure that no sensitive data is inadvertantly copied to the external drive while its connected to the classified system .	St
1.1.4	We currently have 6 Maxtor 250GB drives that do not have any type of physical switch for enabling write protection , nor does their software enbable us to do that either .	St
1.1.5	Does anyone know of a procedure we could use to enable write protection on these drives ?	Ques
1.1.6	Does anyone know of a external drive that has a physical/software means of enabling write protection ?	Ques
1.2.1	We put it on CDR or DVD-R and moved it over .	St
1.2.2	The CDR and DVD-Rs were put in the burn barrel for destruction later .	St
1.2.3	This was the only solution our security officer would accept since the write protect can ... fail .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	An ancient original post , but still a current problem ...	St
1.3.2	I use internal hard drives to store all of my data , and I use various external USB/firewire enclosures which conveniently allow me to hot-swap my hard drives and take my data to other computers .	St
1.3.3	There have been several occasions where friends of mine and I personally have lost all data on external hard drives - corrupting the data on external drives seems to be a fairly common problem that may occur for instance if the drive is powered on while the computer reboots , or if you connect to a computer with an old operating system , or if you hook up additional external devices that do n't get along with yours .	St
1.3.4	I find this situation very troublesome , and I would like my data to be protected from this kind of corruption .	St
1.3.5	I am not interested in password protecting my files , or preventing them from being read , but simply in preventing deletion and corruption .	St
1.3.6	In my opinion , there can be no software solution to this problem : Even if it worked , it would only apply to one system , and not to any arbitrary system I would like to hook my drive to .	St
1.3.7	It seems that the only secure solution would be an external enclosure that only allows read commands to the enclosed hard drive .	St
1.3.8	It would be nice if this write protection could be turned on and off with a switch , but a permanent one would be just as good ( I can always put the drive in another enclosure if I want to write to it ) .	St
1.3.9	It seems that to find this kind of device , you need to add the word & quot ; forensic & quot ; to your search , as if forensics were the only application that this is useful for .	St
1.3.10	Some search results that offer IDE to either USB or firewire : ~ $ 100 : http : //www.cooldrives.com/firewirepcmcia.html $ 195 : http : //www.coreprotect.com/core_shield.html $ 330 : http : //www.cooldrives.com/usb20toatast.html $ 400 : http : //www.logicube.com/products/accessories/usbwriteprotect.asp $ 980 : http : //fwdepot.com/thestore/product_info.php/products_id/1086 Good luck ...	St
1.4.1	For the price , form factor , etc ... the best I could find was the UltraBlock USB write blocker ... this is a USB device you plug & quot ; in-line & quot ; and it will write protect what ever is connected to it .	St
1.4.2	It is a Hardware Write protect , so it is n't prone to failure .	St
1.4.3	They are n't cheap ... to the tune of $ 300 each , but being a simple & quot ; in-line & quot ; USB device that can not be accidentally & quot ; unwrite protected & quot ; , it is worth it .	St
1.4.4	Yes , it does NOT have a switch on it ... it is always in READ ONLY mode .	St
1.4.5	A big plus if your security officers are paranoid .	St
1.5.1	Too bad I do n't live/work in the UK .	St
1.5.2	Plextor has a write protect hdd available to Europeans .	St
1.5.3	http : //www.plextor.be/products/px-ph08u.asp ? choice=PX-PH08U It is NOT available in the USA .	Ques
1.5.4	I 've already looked .	St
1.5.5	I wish it was .	St
1.5.6	I even contacted Plextor to try and find out what it would take to get some here .	St
1.5.7	The guy on the phone was a real smartass about it and would n't lookup any contact info for anyone in the company that would actually know something .	St
