Now, LAN has low connectivity and a 169.234.x.x automatic private address for the ip address assigned ip instead of the usual Zyxel assigned router of 192.168.1.xxx. What kind of problem is this?

Said fix program is out there on google. Another common oversight is trusting Microsoft to find all the machine's driver. I'll be short. That doesn't work. Bob
