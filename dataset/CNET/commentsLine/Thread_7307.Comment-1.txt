installed a new seagate sata hd in my wifes tower for more storage space, bios is as current as possible,so is windows xp.
bios will not recognize hd, as i did not install sata raid drivers last time i installed new ide hard drive.
is there a driver for the asus motherboard of her a600n hp tower, i can install, without reinstalling windows.
only added hd for storage.
computer has 2 ide hd's now, but there are 2 sata ports available minus the one for the new hd.
hd is a seagate sata also.
thanks in advance.
