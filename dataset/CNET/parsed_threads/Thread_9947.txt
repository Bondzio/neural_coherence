<s> We have an eight year old Gateway tower (OS = Win XP) hooked up to our Samsung flat screen TV and watch all our TV and movies through our Internet hook-up (Hulu, Netflix, sports through random free sites...etc.) </s>
<s> This is working well for us and we're very happy with the set-up except that the Gateway is so weak, we need to upgrade. </s>
<s> Questions for those who know about these things: 1. </s>
<s> Given that all we care about for this computer is internet/wireless speed and video and sound quality, what specifications should I be looking for in a new tower? </s>
<s> What processor speed/capacity, RAM memory, sound, video and wireless cards, will maximize the quality of our viewing? </s>
<s> FYI- we live in a rural area where our Internet service is limited to 6 MBPS max (right now it runs about 1.5 to 2 MBPS but will soon be upgraded (in theory) to be closer to the 6 MBPS max). </s>
<s> We will also want to play DVD's through the DVD drive that the new computer should have. </s>
<s> We do not need a TV tuner. </s>
<s> We do not play video games. </s>
<s> And I also assume we will not need much hard drive capacity but maybe I'm forgetting something? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> What operating system should we get? </s>
<s> I'm inclined to get Win 7 because Win 8 seems like overkill for what we need. </s>
<s> Plus my wife is very frustrated by changes brought about by periodic software upgrades. </s>
<s> Win 8 looks like nightmare to her. </s>
<s> But I worry that we lose out in the future by not starting off with the latest OS when available. </s>
<s> Any help on any of this would be greatly appreciated- thanks! </s>
<s> Any i3 or better, 4GB or better with a video card with dedicated video memory with HDMI and the DVD player and of course Windows 7 should be fine. </s>
<s> WiFi is nice but can be trouble for some if the distance to the WiFi router is too far. </s>
<s> It's all about location and what's between you and the router. </s>
<s> It rarely is the hardware choice unless it was some rare 2 dollar thing. </s>
<s> Windows 8 might be OK if we add the start button back in. </s>
<s> http://www.stardock.com/products/start8/ for example and there are others and free ones as well. </s>
<s> We'll get a few Windows 8 machine just in case we get asked if our apps run on it but for now we see that Windows 9 will be fine. </s>
<s> For me I went simpler with an Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7 to the HDTV but this falls short on what you want to do but I thought I'd toss this in. </s>
<s> With that out of the way, let's look at the top sellers at amazon.com for desktops. </s>
<s> Stores have drank the Windows 8 Kool Aid so my bet is you may not get what you want there. </s>
<s> -&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Computers-Accessories-Desktop/zgbs/pc/565098 At NUMBER 2 I see http://www.amazon.com/HP-P7-1490-Pavilion-Desktop/dp/B009X8EC90/ so read the buy comments and see what you think. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> As you're using your OLD PC and got what you wanted, anything newer is going to do this as well of similar specs. </s>
<s> You need to pay attention to your current cable setup and be sure that is also similar to what is offered in a new setup. </s>
<s> While, I'm inclined to go Win7 also, Win8 provides the same answers. </s>
<s> If you go through the trouble of Win7, Win8 will be just as much, so decide which maybe less of a headache for you. </s>
<s> Also, if Win7, you can upgrade to Win8 later. </s>
<s> With the setup(cable) they should provide anything newer if need be because you have a new PC if applicable or they may swap over the items that are part of thier setup to new PC. </s>
<s> That service should offer what it takes via the support website, the needs of continued service -OR- they send someone out to do this or instruction &quot;YOU&quot;. </s>
<s> DVD movies will play nicely provide the DVD drive is there. </s>
<s> The other half of this is the player s/w, but at least Windows media will handle that OK. </s>
<s> Since most newer PC will have globs of HD space, consider how much you need, but typical offering should be 1Tb or better. </s>
<s> If you need more, then buy with new PC as part of it, but 2Tb should do well. </s>
<s> if you save or store personal movies or offline movies then that will take HD space. </s>
<s> Win7, 4gb ram, Intel cpu( I perfer), DVD drive, 1Tb HD(at least) and ports(ethernet, USB, etc), video(card? </s>
<s> 512mb ram or better) otherwise on-board video supports 512mb or better. </s>
<s> It appears you want a &quot;desktop&quot; to replace your old Gateway, so run away from tablets, laptops or netbooks, unless that suits you, but most of those would be better with Win8 and touchscreen if decided upon. </s>
<s> Shop online of local stores(check for deals either way). </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks very much to to R. Proffitt and Willy for the advice! </s>
<s> Couple follow up questions: 1. </s>
<s> I'm not up to speed on HDMI technology but understand that's the connection I need to make between the new computer and Samsung flat screen TV we have (as opposed to the parallel port cable I'm currently using). </s>
<s> When I look at the specs for the HP desktop that R. Proffitt provided a link to, I don't see anything about HDMI ports or cables. </s>
<s> Is there another name for it? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> As far as hard drive space, we don't download movies- pretty much stream everything when we watch the TV (or use DVDs). </s>
<s> So I don't plan on getting a ton of hard drive space. </s>
<s> But am I going to regret this because I'm not thinking of where entertainment technology is headed? </s>
<s> Or is hard drive memory cheap enough that I should just go ahead and get a good amount of hard drive space (say 1 TB) anyway? </s>
<s> Couple clarifications- Internet connection is via DSL and WiFi is a must since there's no phone jack near the computer. </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
<s> You're right. </s>
<s> It has DVI and VGA. </s>
<s> Now DVI does use a small few dollar adapter to HDMI but it might not put sound on the HDMI. </s>
<s> If this was my choice I'd add the usual 30 dollar ATI 5450 1GB video card (I already checked for the slot and power) then I'd be good to go. </s>
<s> Try a few other models from that top sellers. </s>
<s> There's a reason those are in that list. </s>
<s> If I'm unsure which I should consider, the best sellers at Amazon has been a great help to narrow it down. </s>

<s> HDMI- If you have no connection coming with new PC, then you can add it latter. </s>
<s> USually, I perfer the video card addition vs the ada[pter, however the adapter will work too with added instructions to make it *all* work. </s>
<s> Which is why I perfer the video card with HDMI port amongest others that maybe included, DVI or VGA. </s>
<s> HDMI handles the audio as part of tis make-up. </s>
<s> HD storage- The main feature of a larger HD is more storage. </s>
<s> Newer PCs will come no thought with a larger HD. </s>
<s> Overall, it's good insurance to have the extra even though you may not think you'lll use it. </s>
<s> It's just there and it part of the overall PC build, just be keen on what's provided. </s>
<s> Of course, you can use the HD storage any way you want. </s>
<s> 1Tb is just darn good to have, IMHO. </s>
<s> Ports- All those connections you may need are going to come with the new PC. </s>
<s> The only lacking ones are called, &quot;legacy ports&quot;, like parallel/LPT, etc.. </s>
<s> But, those can be added later if the need arise by adding a PCI type card with those required old ports. </s>
<s> Though its important to know that your new PC has available empty slots to instal them on, so be sure to review specs. </s>
<s> tada ----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks for the quick and informative responses! </s>
<s> I think I'm good to go. </s>
