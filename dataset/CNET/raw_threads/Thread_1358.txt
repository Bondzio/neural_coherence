My issue is that writing strucks on 1% (only when writing DVD's). No issues while writing CD's. Some times writing is normal when writing RW DVD's. Writer is Samsung Slim External DVD writer. The product is under warranty and got replaced once. It is only 4 months old. Second time they refuesed to replace the writer as it is not showing any isssues in other computers. I reinstalled Windows and Nero. I almost tried all versions of Nero. Still got the same error shown below. Alcohol and Daemon Tools where previously installed, but I uninstalled it now and still getting same error. No issues with the USB port, other devices are working fine in the same port. I bought this writer because my laps internal writer got damaged which is of same make.I updated the writers firmware to the latest.....Please help....... OS Name

You wrote it worked on other machines but look at Alcohol and Daemon Tools. You've installed some titles that install CD/DVD emulations and could interfere. Given the story of the fresh install I wonder why we would need Alcohol and Daemon Tools and not stick with CD/DVD burning software? It's something with the machine and install but all I see is the usual titles I've removed too often. Bob
