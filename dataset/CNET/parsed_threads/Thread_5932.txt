<s> I have had a gateway desktop for about 9 mos now and I was wondering what I could upgrade the processor to it is a intel 915G Express chipset as of right now it has the pentium 4 550 3.4Ghz it is an LGA775 socket i think not positive. </s>
<s> not to goos with this sort of thing i buy it and then i have comp store install it because if i buy threw them i pay x2 lol </s>
<s> http://www.intel.com/products/processor/pentium4/index.htm I see a few 3.8 GHz CPUs that may work but then again the gain is minimal. </s>
<s> What is driving this need? </s>
<s> Games? </s>
<s> If so a graphics card will pay off. </s>

<s> Yes this is for games a lot of the new games I am seeing require at lease 2.6ghz I have already got ram at 2 GB and Nvidia 7300 GS 256mb video. </s>
<s> just worried games are going to start lagging didn't know if my PC could hold a EMT64 Processor or a Pentium D lol i though since they were all the same socket type (at lease that what i thought when i looked threw newegg) that i could use any </s>
<s> Hardly any game stresses on a 3GHz P4 with HT. </s>
<s> You have better than that. </s>
<s> Look at the video card for gains here. </s>

<s> ok my video Card has the option of going to 512mb I just don't know if it drains it from my system or if in some way I add memory to the actual card ...... odds are it drains from system since never heard of one that has a ram slot lol..... but my system says it can only handle 2 GB of ram it has 4 ram slots and I have 512MB's in each slot didn't know if Gateway was just being conservative lol just didn't know if I should sacrifice the system ram for video ram </s>
<s> ohh BTW its a gateway 506GR </s>
<s> and low wattage PSU. </s>
<s> Your system has a built-in graphics CPU (vice a graphics card) and the memory to run it is borrowed from the system memory. </s>
<s> You're OK re RAM but onboard video doesn't cut it for games. </s>
<s> Adding a more powerful video card, one suitable for gaming, takes a more robust PSU. </s>
<s> You could look for a video card that doesn't require more than a 300 WATT PSU but that will really limit your options. </s>
<s> Good Luck and keep us posted. </s>

<s> video card was changed 2-3 mos ago it has a Nvidia Geforce 7300GSis has 256Mb on board but that package for it says it can go up 512mb i am guessing it draaws system ram for its one use the onboard video has been disables and i currenly have the full 2048 installed </s>

<s> concerned it recommends a 350W PSU and yours is only 300W. </s>
<s> Re upgrading the CPU...what's the mfg. </s>
<s> say ? </s>

<s> can anyone recommend a new power supply ?? </s>
