<s> Some sage thoughts, please. </s>
<s> I have been looking at upgrading my PC. </s>
<s> It runs Bioshock OK but jerks slightly, say, when doors open or characters appear on screen for duelling. </s>
<s> I upgraded to 2GB RAM which was a marked improvement (wish I'd plumped for 1GB sticks instead of 4x512) and bought a second GPU for SLi...which wasn't a marked improvement. </s>
<s> The PC is only a year old and I am dismayed at how fast the pace has moved on...939 board, 3200 DDR2...it will only be 'minimum requirement' for the upcoming Crysis. </s>
<s> Anyway...my research tells me that an AMD 64 FX 57 is a pretty good chip (but is not dual core) and the ASUS site says that my MOBO is compatible. </s>
<s> However FX 57 chips are as rare as hens teeth...and very expensive when tracked down. </s>
<s> The MOBO is also AMD X2 (dual core) compatible but my research tells me these chips run no better that 2.2GHz and are more suited to multi-tasking, not gaming. </s>
<s> Is installing a new chip as straight forward as it seems? </s>
<s> Am I getting my thoughts on this all wrong? </s>
<s> Would even more RAM speed things up? </s>
<s> Should I consider clocking (I don't do this)? </s>
<s> Is it time to buy that XBox 360 :-/ Cooperm4n XP home AMD Athlon 64 (939) 3700 San Diego (2.2GHz equivalent) 1MB cache ASUS A8N-SLi SE (SLi enabled) Dual DDR 2GB Corsair DDR400 3200 160GB Western Bell SATA HDD nVidia 7600GS 256mb PCIe nVidia 7600GS 256mb PCIe 500W PCU 120mm fan </s>
<s> After reading and using much of what is at http://www.tweakguides.com/Bioshock_1.html I played it ok with a C2D with an older AGP 6800 Nvidia 256MB card. </s>
<s> It has 2GB RAM but I don't think 2 or 4 sticks is the issue here. </s>
<s> The biggest boost came when I used the hint about Vsync and the triple buffer settings. </s>

<s> Looks fascinating RP I have some reading to do...thanks Cooperm4n </s>
<s> note that its recommended system is a dual core cpu, 2GB of ram, and geforce 7900gt/8600gts or better graphics card. </s>
<s> anything less and you're going to have to reduce your resolution or start turning off most of the visual effects. </s>
<s> even dual 7600gs cards don't approach the performance of a 7900gt so you should consider a geforce 8600gts (or try to find a 7950gt or radeon x1950xt). </s>
<s> evga 8600gts, $160 before $150 rebate: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=321211 cpu-wise, your options are limited because of your 939 socket motherboard (socket 939 was obsoleted by socket am2 more than a year ago). </s>
<s> athlon x2s go all the way up to 3.4ghz (x2 6400+) but require the am2 socket. </s>
<s> but in the 939 flavor, you're limited to 2.2ghz (x2 4200+ is $70). </s>
<s> x2's are overclock friendly so you should be able to crank an x2 4200+ up to 2.6-2.8ghz fairly easily. </s>
<s> I may have made a rash move but I managed to get a new AMD 64 FX 57 2.8GHz...after watching second hand ones swap places on ebay, over a two week period, for the same price (150). </s>
<s> A better GPU is next but I was dismayed at the obsolescence of a 939 socket board so thought I had better move quickly. </s>
<s> I will take any b0llocking like a man! </s>
<s> Anyway I wanted to know...when the chip arrives...postal strike permitting...is it just a question of powering down the PC with the old chip in, dismantling, re-assembling and then powering up the new chip? </s>

<s> A new CPU driver might be needed. </s>
<s> Read http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7591_102-0.html?forumID=26&threadID=266794&messageID=2599695#2599695 </s>
<s> Thanks RP These links seem to refer to Duo Core - the AMD 64 FX 57 is, by my understanding, a single core. </s>
<s> Do you think I will have to install updated drivers for a single core? </s>
<s> Coopem4n </s>
<s> &quot;For XP you need to download and install the AMD CPU driver.&quot; I supplied the links to a discussion and the driver. </s>
<s> There's very little else I can supply for you about this. </s>
<s> Print the discussion out if you have difficulty with this for the tech to finish the job. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks RP Finally gotten around to intalling my FX57 with the help of your directions...cheers. </s>
<s> The delay was, in part, due to the UK postal strike! </s>
<s> I'm now in gaming heaven! </s>
<s> More RAM and a GPU upgrade next! </s>
<s> Cooperm4n </s>
<s> Glad the tweaks and drivers helped. </s>
<s> I've noticed other games work better after such changes. </s>
