<s> Got a new laptop, the CD drive has been acting up horribly. </s>
<s> CDs read at an incredibly low speed (like half an hour for a 170MB install) and whenever I try burning a CD I receive an error message. </s>
<s> After the error message, the drive will appear to continue doing things indefinitely, and the eject button doesn't work. </s>
<s> Is this the drive that is messed up or is it a software problem? </s>
<s> Please use it. </s>
<s> It's not your problem. </s>
<s> Well almost... </s>
<s> If you installed Roxio software, there is a bug with whats on the CD distribution that will cause what you complained about. </s>

<s> Haven't been using Roxio. </s>
<s> I tried with Media Player and Sonic Record Now. </s>
<s> I'll contact Dell but I hope I don't have to send my laptop back in because I'm in university right now and I need it. </s>
<s> I don't know all software that creates the issue. </s>
<s> You can try uninstalling ANY recording software that you installed after getting the machine. </s>
<s> But before that, try stopping the imapi service and trying again. </s>
