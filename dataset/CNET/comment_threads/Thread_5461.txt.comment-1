Hi all, Just after some advice.
I have 3 partitions + some unallocated space.
In partition magic it shows my 3 partitions adjacent to eachother with the final partition next to the unallocated space.
I want to give all the unallocated space to the partition in the middle.
So I went to resize partition on the menu and selected the middle partition and went through the wizard, increased the size etc.... After clicking okay and looking at the operations pending items bit it said it was going to &quot;move partition X [the partition next to the unallocated space] up by [amount I wanted to give to the middle partition] and then resize the middle partition with the ammount I wanted to increase it by.
My question is that is this the correct way of doing this?
Should I perhaps reszie the partiton next to the unallocated space to the max then give this free space to the middle partition?
Any help appreciated.
Thanks.
