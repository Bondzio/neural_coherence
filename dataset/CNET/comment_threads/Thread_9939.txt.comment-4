Sorry, I don't know the WD Software.
Maybe somebody else does.
If it's all combined in one Windows file, can't you delete that and start all over.
This is one of the risks of using proprietary backup software.
It might use a proprietary lay-out for the data that it backs up, so the usual Windows tools don't work on it.
Your choice to use it.
