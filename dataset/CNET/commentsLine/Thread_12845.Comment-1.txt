hey, i know this has probably been covered before but i couldn't find one that matched my situation.
ok so i bought a sata hd as a backup dive, and at first xp recognized it.
but i got an error half way though formatting the sata and since then xp will not recognized it.and don't say disk management because that the typical solution i keep finding except for the fact that it doesn't show in disk management.
any idea's people ??
system is - amd athlon 3200+ 64 bit , msi rs482m4 mother board, 1.5 gigs of ram , with a ide main hd and the sata is a wd caviar black
