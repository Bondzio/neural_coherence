<s> I need to buy a GOOD gaming PC for myself. </s>
<s> I will be playing games like Battlefield 2, F.E.A.R, Rainbow 6 Las Vegas, and other awesome games like that. </s>
<s> I cannot spend more than $1000 on this. </s>
<s> All i want to know is what are the best things to get so I can get good memory, a good video card and all that junk. </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> Thanks a lot. </s>
<s> I'm really only a casual gamer. </s>
<s> I will play Rainbow 6 and Battlefield mostly. </s>
<s> I probably won't even have any other games on my computer. </s>
<s> What I am looking for is basically an awesome pc that can handle those games easily so i don't get mad that it lags all the time. </s>
<s> But along with that, I don't need, and won't spend money on, the $4000 - $5000 pc's. </s>
<s> How about the Gateway FX530XM with: -Intel Core 2 Duo Processor E6600 (2.40GHz, 1066MHz FSB, 4MB cache, non-HT) -2048MB 667MHz Dual-Channel DDR2 SDRAM (2-1024MB modules) -Intel 975X Chipset with DDR2 and Intel Core Duo support -500GB 7200rpm Serial ATA II/ 300 hard drive w/ 8MB cache & Raid 0 (2-250GB hard drives) and either one of these(I can't decide on which one I actually need): -NVIDIA GeForce 7600GT 256MB DDR2 Video Card Dual DVI/ TV -NVIDIA GeForce 8800GTS w/ 320MB, Dual DVI-I Dual link TV Out (Factory Overclocked) w/ VGA adapter </s>
<s> I know i said i don't want to spend more than $1000, but the reason I like the Gateway is because I can get a computer from either Gateway or Dell for a little bit cheaper. </s>
<s> So it would actually be a good price. </s>
<s> .-&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/06/11/the_best_gaming_video_cards_for_the_money/ The 8800 is noted. </s>
<s> See how it fared. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> how about an xbox360 for $400... </s>
<s> you're looking at a $105 geforce 7600gt and a $285 8800gts. </s>
<s> why? </s>
<s> if the 8800gts fits in your budget, get it because there's no other $300 card that can match its peformance. </s>
<s> if you only have $200, get a radeon x1900xt. </s>
<s> if only $160, its a tough call between a geforce 8600gts (dx10), geforce 7900gs (faster), or radeon x1950pro (fastest). </s>
<s> don't put anything slower (like a 7600gt) in a new gaming rig. </s>
<s> so your saying either the 8800gts or the radeon x1950pro. </s>
<s> but if i want i can get the 7900 gs and still play my games without getting really mad cuz the frame rate sucks? </s>
<s> but when i buy it from gateway.com i have the choice between the 8800GTS($299.00) or the ATI Radeon X1900 Crossfire w/ 512 MB($357.00) nothing about 1950 PRO it says crossfire and its an added $470. </s>
<s> so idk which one to get since i've actually never used ANY of them b4. </s>
<s> all i want is to play a few games without getting any lag. </s>
<s> thanks a lot by the way. </s>
<s> really appreciate it. </s>
<s> gateway offers a limited number of graphics upgrades but any of the cards i mentioned will work in the pc. </s>
<s> gateway's price on the 8800gts is reasonable especially since they will pre-install it for you. </s>
<s> the x1900 crossfire won't match the all-around performance of the 8800gts. </s>
<s> as i said before, if you don't have the budget for the 8800gts, get what you can afford from the earlier list. </s>
