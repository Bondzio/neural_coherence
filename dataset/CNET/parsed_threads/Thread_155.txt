<s> I have a HP Pavillion 8756 that I just upgraded to XP from ME, I find it kind of slow and would like to upgrade my RAM.... </s>
<s> I have 2 x 126MB sticks and would like to put in 2 X 256MB sticks. </s>
<s> (There are only 2 slots on the mother board) Problem is that I'm not too sure what speed these ram sticks are...Probably 133MHZ but, how can I be sure before I go ahead and purchase the 2 new sticks???? </s>
<s> Is there a way to find out in the computer configuration? </s>
<s> I don't have my original books either!!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Many online computer hardware stores such as http://www.crucial.com/ offer automated services to determine exactly what kind of sticks and max RAM a machine can use. </s>
<s> Here is a link to all of the specs for the Pavilion 8756. </s>
<s> The first chart states that your computer uses PC100 SDRAM, not PC133. </s>
<s> Be careful when purchasing an upgrade...some PC133 SDRAM is backwards compatible with PC100, but not all. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, John </s>
