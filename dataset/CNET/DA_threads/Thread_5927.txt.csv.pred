1.1.1	Hello , Win XP Pro , and US Robotics USR 5470 wireless kit ( USR 5462 wireless router & 5422 USB wireless adapter ) After coming out of hibernation ( my prefered method of 'turning off ' the computer ) I am not able to access the internet through my wireless connection .	St
1.1.2	The wireless connection itself works grand ( can access router 's setup pages , can ping router , IP address is correct , etc ) but it will not connect to any internet pages ( except , strangely , Craigslist ) .	St
1.1.3	Anyone know why hibernating would mess with internet , even though the wireless connection is working fine ?	Ques
1.2.1	Drivers .	St
1.2.2	Sorry , but it 's drivers .	St
1.2.3	Call the maker of the unit if need be if you do n't get them from the web site .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Ok , thanks for the reply ...	Polite
1.3.2	This is a common issue , eh ?	Ques
1.3.3	Well , I 've actually already updated the USB wireless adapters driver , and of course , the router itself does n't have one ...	St
1.3.4	I 'll poke around some more on the USR site and see what I can find .	St
1.3.5	Thanks !	St
1.4.1	I find that about every 2-3 months , for unknown reasons , the COMCAST connection is dead when I try to log onto Internet .	St
1.4.2	My guru friends tell me ( and it works ) that the solution is to disconnect power to the router and the modem , disconnect the router from the modem , disconnect the modem from the COMCAST cable , turn off the computer , wait 5 minutes then re-connect everything and boot up the computer and the problem is solved .	St
1.4.3	It 's a pain to have to do all this , but it works and it restores the Internet access .	St
1.4.4	Fortunately , this only happens infrequently .	St
1.4.5	Now that I know what to do , I just do it !	St
1.4.6	Best regards , David Hodge at the top of the Chesapeake Bay .	St
