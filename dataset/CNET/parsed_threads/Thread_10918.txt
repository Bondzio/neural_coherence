<s> I was actually checking DeskTops here at C/Net today and was really looking at VISTA ready machines.. a LEVONO&lt;&lt;--did I spell that rt./ Business Machine called a Think Centre was going for $$758..00 utilizeing a 3.06 GHz CPU and an 80 GB HDD..and 512 MB's of RAM.. seems from the ReView that it did not SHIP w/Burner Drive..only a CD-ROM.. .. </s>
<s> I would suggest this machine for a Purchase and a Upgrade.. you could go USB 2.0 on your Burner Drive..along w/External HDD at least 120-GB's... .. Software.... .. its an added $$300.00. </s>
<s> yes i want a complete system, i record music, i play counter-strike for CAL and warcraft3 for CAL, photo programs- photoshop cs2, imageready, wally/music programs- cakewalk and guitar pro, and my budget limit is $1000. </s>
