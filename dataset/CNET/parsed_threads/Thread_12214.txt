<s> My Linksys WRT54G v5 is a dog -- stops working, needs to be rebooted almost daily. </s>
<s> I've read the reviews (and this forum) and I know I'm not the only person with this problem. </s>
<s> It's lousy equipment, I want to replace it, and I won't be buying Linksys again. </s>
<s> So -- can anyone recommend an affordable (&lt;$100) home wireless router? </s>
<s> My criteria are, in this order, 1) RELIABLE (day in, day out, never needs attention); 2) FAST; and 3) EASY to set up and maintain. </s>
<s> I don't need any high-end features -- just an internet access point with WPA+ encryption. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> I think we might all have been better off when we communicated by beating on hollow logs. </s>
<s> Check out this post on how to hack your linksys router and turn it into a more reliable firewall, client access point, or just plain old wireless router. </s>

<s> First...What is fast? </s>
<s> You want a line speed router? </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> If your looking at $100 routers then you probably can't produce enough bandwidth to actually use a line speed router. </s>
<s> Second...It needs to be rebooted daily? </s>
<s> I've used nothing but modified linksys routers for my company of 100+ people and its the only thing I don't have to worry about. </s>
<s> ''Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> I think we might all have been better off when we communicated by beating on hollow logs.'' </s>
<s> (Right....) ''Easy to setup.'' </s>
<s> What easier than plugging it in? </s>
<s> Do a little research. </s>
<s> Walk though Best Buy. </s>
<s> Don't trash a good product, maybe you should talk to your ISP (Internet Service Provider). </s>
<s> I have had my Netgear Super G Wireless Router Model: WGT624 (Bestbuy $59.99) for about a year now, only had to reset it once, which was very quick and painless, so I would totally recommend a Netgear wireless router. </s>
<s> I have a mac ibook, but my friends come over with there peecees and they have never had trouble connecting. </s>
<s> If you don't want an open network, very easy to close it up too. </s>
<s> That is all I have to say, hope is helps. </s>
<s> works fine for me. </s>
<s> I haven't had to reset it after I set it up correctly. </s>
<s> Question Are you turning off your radio when you disconnect? </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> To be perfectly honest, as I support and install these for friends and family, I haven't seen much difference in the four most popular routers (NetGear, LinkSys, DLink, and Belkin). </s>
<s> All of them seem, from my vantage point, to work as advertised. </s>
<s> As such, when someone asks me which one, I tell them to buy which ever is on sale that week and I'll help them get it up and running. </s>
<s> Following Bob's advice about upgrading the firmware has resolved almost every issue I have come across, except the occasional &quot;doa&quot; that can happen to any vendor. </s>
<s> I posted the original message on 10/16. </s>
<s> One of your responses reminded to check my firmware, and I did -- sure enough, Linksys had posted an update on 9/22. </s>
<s> I updated and, to their slight credit, the worst of the problem has ended -- I have not had to re-boot the router since I updated. </s>
<s> HOWEVER, Linksys isn't free and clear -- this was the third or fourth firmware update I've installed since I've had the router, none of which solved the problem I described in my original post; AND the darn thing is still buggy -- sometimes I have to try several times in order to establish a connection. </s>
<s> If I take the router out of the loop, the problem is gone. </s>
<s> Linksys still has some 'splainin to do. </s>
<s> Thanks gang for the suggestions. </s>
<s> My now 3+ year old Linksys 802.11b router still works like a charm. </s>
<s> No problems. </s>
<s> If you are having problems you may want to try a simple flush. </s>
<s> Open the command prompt and enter: ipconfig /flushdns. </s>
<s> This may clear some old stuff in the cache. </s>
<s> I own a Linksys WRT54G wireless router for just about 3 years now. </s>
<s> In all the crap that I put it through, even with self-inflicted errors what I would get when I 'tweak' it, it still runs like a charm. </s>
<s> I will admit, there are times when I flash to new BIOS, the router would crap out. </s>
<s> I simply re-flash it to it's origional state, and works like a charm agian. </s>
<s> Added Hi-Gain antennas when I get crappy signals, and it works even better than I thought. </s>
<s> If you are still experiencing internet issues, you may want to try the hi-gain antenna option. </s>
<s> Assuming all else fails. </s>
<s> Good luck </s>
<s> I don't know about the WGT624 but I can tell you the WGU624 is not good. </s>
<s> The problem that sticks in my craw is that the logging/emailing function is not operational. </s>
<s> This thing does not log at all. </s>
<s> My old 614 did it flawlessly. </s>
<s> I spent three months trying to work with Netgear support only to find out about a class action lawsuit against them. </s>
<s> They offered me $10 off my next online purchase through them. </s>
<s> I also bought their MP101 to wirelessly stream music. </s>
<s> It looks pretty there gathering dust. </s>
<s> It has never worked although I think it is the server software. </s>
<s> I have negative feelings about a company that their gear fails out of the box. </s>
<s> Actually, I just replaced a DLink DI524 with the DI634M. </s>
<s> Both are very reliable, gave me virtually no trouble. </s>
<s> However, the 634M is much faster, with MIMO and a greater range. </s>
<s> I've had it for at least three months, and I may have rebooted it once since getting it set up originally. </s>
<s> Both were easy to configure with a reasonably simple &quot;G&quot; home network. </s>
<s> I USE BELKIN ROUTER I HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH ONLY COSTS 40.00 FOR THE ROUTER AND THE CARD WE HAVE 2 PCS NO PROBLEM WITH EITHER ONE DELRAYBEACHBUM@ADELPHIA.NET </s>
<s> Experienced a problem setting up my Linksys Speedboost Router with Verizon DSL. </s>
<s> After several weeks, and no resolution from Verizon, and a ton of frustration, called LinkSys Tech Support. </s>
<s> Result, return unit (defective) for exchange. </s>
<s> With the exchanged unit, setup ran smoothly and without any problem. </s>
<s> No problems since. </s>
<s> Regardless of the brand, anything can fail out of the box, or have problems. </s>
<s> The model Linksys I have is the SpeedBoost model. </s>
<s> I turn mine off daily after use, as well as the computer. </s>
<s> that I purchased at Sam's Club a year or so ago. </s>
<s> I may have to reboot once a month or less, but other than that, I haven't had many problems. </s>
<s> When I went wireless two years ago, I already had a Belkin switch based wired network. </s>
<s> I added a Belkin Wireless Access Point and I've had not a single problem. </s>
<s> The interface to the AP control panel is a bit clunky but it does the job. </s>
<s> I've had Belkin kit for other projects in the past and never had a problem with any of it. </s>
<s> It's cheap too - at least here in the UK! </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Z </s>
<s> I have had endless linksys routers same problem as you finally went with 3com never rebooted in two years. </s>
<s> I used to have the same problem with routers when doing torrents. </s>
<s> Searched through the web for solution and found that its better to update the linksys firmware to a Linux DDWRT. </s>
<s> Am now a very happy owner of the router. </s>
<s> You sir, are an idiot. </s>
<s> You should note that this is a VERY common problem with v5 of the firmware for this router. </s>
<s> Linksys does not deserve your business if they allow such ridiculously lousy firmware to become public without the proper testing. </s>
<s> Check Wikipedia if you don't believe me. </s>
