<s> I just went to cable from dial up. </s>
<s> Got five email addresses. </s>
<s> Decided to keep records of which email is used where. </s>
<s> I used one of them for one time, to go to Linux central to buy a Knoppix CD. </s>
<s> I am now getting SPAM mail against that email address which has been used only once. </s>
<s> What can I do to report this?? </s>
<s> Any ideas. </s>
