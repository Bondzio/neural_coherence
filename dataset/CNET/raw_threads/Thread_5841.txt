Follow my happy drive suggestions at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7813-0.html?forumID=9&threadID=127919&messageID=1445802 2. Remove the UPPER and LOWERFILTERS such as we read at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7813-0.html?forumID=5&threadID=137660&messageID=1548239 3. Consider other sources of problems. a. media. b. power supply overtaxed. c. a hot case. Best of luck, Bob
