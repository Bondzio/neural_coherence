I'm not aware of any drawbacks using just 1 stick of 1gb as opposed to two of 512.
Someone else might be able to enlighten us both.
If your motherboard supports DDR-400, go for that, of course - although, check what your CPU frequency is - some would say it's better to have the same frequency for both.
CL is latency - the lower latency, the faster the memory.
From my own experience, CL2.5 is noticeably faster than CL3.
General advice - memory is key to computer perfomance; buy branded memroy from makers like Kingston, Crucial, Corsair, and not generic unknown makes.
A good place to get memory is from Crucial's own site - http://www.crucial.com/uk/ - they'll also advise you on the best compatible memory for your motherboard and their prices should be well within your budget.
Good luck!
