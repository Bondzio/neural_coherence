this was a timely topic.
i have had 2 maxtor external hdd die on me.
my son has gad on maxtor die on him.
in all three cases the units were hardly used at all.
used occasionally for backups and storage and then turned off.
the supplier was not interested in the fact that 3 of their products had failed.
(all three out of warranty) they suggested data recovery - at a cost of up to $2,000 each with no guarantee that the data could be recovered.
i have had computers for up to 10 years with no internal hdd failure.
i have also worked in companies where the hdd has run for 7 years or more 24/7 with no failure.
my suggestion is to steer clear of cheap hdd.
from now on it is only wd or lacie for me.
