xp64 is beta.
to me beta=infancy.
i wouldn't consider it mature until you can buy it in a box.
and i would be expecting full driver support and software compatibility.
i don't really disagree with your original post.
64bit is the future and i am eagerly awaiting it.
anything that will speed up my work.
i had actually composed an answer to the question and then got called away from my machine before i could post.
i didn't know you had replied when i sent mine.
i can see how it might seem to be contradicting yours but it wasn't meant that way.
as to linux, it certainly is a nice server os, and if it had more of the tools i need (solidworks, photoshop, illustrator) i would be all over it.
but to be appealing to consumers it's got a long way to go.
