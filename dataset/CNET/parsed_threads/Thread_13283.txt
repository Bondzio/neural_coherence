<s> I purchased ink for HP Deskjet 3745 from outside and not from the company but on putting that cartridge I am getting an error stating that there is a problem with my cartridge.I tried to remove and reinsert it but of no avail. </s>
<s> Please help! </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> A new HP cartridge costs Rs.1700 whereas the cost of the printer is Rs. </s>
<s> 3000 so clearly its not worth it. </s>
<s> Refilling cost me Rs. </s>
<s> 200 but the printer is not accepting the refilled cartridge. </s>
<s> In your 1st post, you didn't mentione you &quot;refilled&quot; the old cart. </s>
<s> Now, that's your problem. </s>
<s> HP keeps track of ink carts, but using a different ink cart even if refilled but NOT used by your system will be accepted. </s>
<s> HP tracks upto 3 inkcarts, thus you need 4inkcarts to reset the last value from re-occuring. </s>
<s> Saving X-money isn't worth it if the prtr. </s>
<s> doesn't work. </s>
<s> You need to access other inkcart(s) to continue usage. </s>
<s> Google for further details but that covers it. </s>
