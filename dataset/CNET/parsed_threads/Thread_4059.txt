<s> What do you guys think? </s>
<s> I can't but a price on it. </s>
<s> Can you guys tell me a reasonable price for it. </s>
<s> *The reason I'm selling it is because I bough an HP Laptop and I have it connected to the Expansion Bay and well I can use it as a desktop. </s>
<s> So I prefer to have one computer instead of two computers. </s>
<s> this acer aspire is pretty close to your config and costs $370 new: http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/Acer-Aspire-Desktop-PC-AST180-UA350B/sem/rpsm/oid/170985/catOid/-12962/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do since your pc is used, cut that price in half ($185). </s>
<s> add $40 for the monitor, $25 for printer (see ebay pricing), and $20 for speakers and keyboard/mouse. </s>
<s> That's what I insured one like that I sent to my nephew. </s>
<s> Since there is no warranty or support the price takes a heavy hit. </s>
<s> See what they are going for on Ebay. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Unless I needed the money. </s>
<s> I'm curious about this statement tho. </s>
<s> and I have it connected to the Expansion Bay and well I can use it as a desktop? </s>
<s> I have it connected to an HP expansion bay and have my notebook setup as a desktop:P </s>
<s> ok well from what i think is a reasonable price would be about 300-400$ has good stuff inculded i agree with someother people you should keep it for future stuff...... anyways that is a pretty good machine! </s>
<s> I was thinking of that price. </s>
<s> But if I buy the AMD Athlon 64 X2 CPU i said i want and a Compaq 19&quot; Widescreen LCD display then I won't sell it. </s>
<s> LOL! </s>
<s> But yeah who knows. </s>
