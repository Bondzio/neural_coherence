<s> Everytime I print something on my Dell A940 printer the job completes but the printer status box does not fully delete the job. </s>
<s> I have to go into Task Manager on my Windows XP and find two processes (DLBAJSWX.EXE and DLBAPSWX.exe) and manually end the processes to free up the printer for the next project. </s>
<s> Any idea what's up? </s>
<s> On 3/28/04 you posted a question regarding Dell 940 printer and the fact that you had to manually delete two processes. </s>
<s> Yesterday, I got a message after putting new color cartridge in same printer, that referenced dlbapswx.exe. </s>
<s> Did you ever find out what your problem was? </s>
<s> In addition to error message,the cartridge is missing blue color. </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> Wondering if error message is a separate issue. </s>
<s> I am relatively new at all this, but have a need to know... even if I don't understand the answers!! </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated </s>
<s> Same problem I think anyway Win XP My printer when doing a page will go to 99% then stop there...the paper comes out and the job is done but it still won't go to the next printing job...it gives you the option of &quot;cancelling&quot; the current job but even that doesn't help...it still won't move to the next thing I then get a list of &quot;pending&quot; jobs it has to do but unless I reboot...it won't go to the next printing task Are all our problems related? </s>
<s> BTW I have a Lexmark X1150 and everything else(scanning...faxing etc) all still work fine just printing is acting up </s>
