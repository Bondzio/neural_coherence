hi, i have to reinstall my windows xp, before y download all to a external drive (from a friend).
but by mistake i reloaded with now mostly useless files my hard drive.
is there a way to recognize which files are been used and which to get rid?
if possible, if there is a way to delete them not one by one will be grate.
