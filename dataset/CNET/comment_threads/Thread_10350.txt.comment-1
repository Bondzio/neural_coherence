HP deskjet 3420 model printer, very new and the printer head won't move when sent a print job.
Can hear a spinning sound like it's trying to move.
Was working fine.
Have checked all settings and all appear to be correct.
Any suggestions?
I'm not a techie so simple answers would help greatly.
Thanks!
