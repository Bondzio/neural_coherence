<s> What can I do?? </s>
<s> I do have xp on computer(dell dimension 3000)computer is less than year old.printer is about two years old. </s>
<s> a different cable (sometimes they do go bad)? </s>
<s> If a USB connection, have you tried a differeent port? </s>
<s> Are you using a hub? </s>
<s> Lexmark warns that sometimes that will cause problems, and you should go directly into the computer. </s>
<s> Do you have any other USB devices connected? </s>
<s> If so, try it with them all disconnected. </s>
<s> Have you searched the knowledbebase for &quot;no connection&quot; at the Lexmark site ? </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
