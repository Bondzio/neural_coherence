I have been doing alot of reading about a LCD monitor that I am getting.
Going to be used by a graphic artist and my price range is similar at around 400-600.
Read about the viewsonic and it seems like a good option.
Also saw the HP f2105.
Anyone have any thoughts on this?
This is for a PC not a mac, otherwise I would likely stretch and get the Apple display.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
