1.1.1	I have an Asus A7V133 v 1.05 motherboard w/bios v.1009 .	St
1.1.2	My 1GHz Athlon seems to work fine but I need help setting bios to run Athlon XP2100+ .	St
1.1.3	The settings so far seem to hang .	St
1.1.4	At the time I bought it , the motherboard was found to be able to take up to Athlon 2100 , I did n't realise the + made a difference and I ca n't get it to run .	St
1.1.5	Is there any upgrades available for this .	Ques
1.1.6	Any new BIOS that can handle this ? .	Ques
1.1.7	Thanks for the help .	St
1.2.1	You truly need to check the Aus support website for any new or last bios updates .	St
1.2.2	Since , I had this mtrbd .	St
1.2.3	I know it would support upto and maybe with the Semptron beyond the 2100+ , the 2200+ being the last I rememeber , but again the Asus wqebsite offers the specs on cpu supported .	St
1.2.4	The mtrbd .	St
1.2.5	is suppose to be & quot ; auto-configuing & quot ; , that 's stated by the boot-up displays showing a 2100+ being present .	St
1.2.6	The omnly problem , I see maybe you have an older or initial release mtbd .	St
1.2.7	where you *manually* configure the setting besides any bios setting .	St
1.2.8	If only bios setting , be sure to verify the voltage , FSB , and CAS setting are done if done manually .	St
1.2.9	Plus save before exiting the bios area .	St
1.2.10	I really liked that bd .	St
1.2.11	but moved on .	St
1.2.12	I suggest you further check all setting , then try again .	Sug
1.2.13	If the problem persists , do a CMOS clearing in order to get back to defaults and see if wants to boot properly , reboot if does , then change any bios setting , etc , save and hopefully it settles down .	St
1.2.14	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.3.1	Disable & quot ; Spread Spectrum & quot ; in the BIOS .	St
1.4.1	a 1700+ to run at a memory speed of 133 MHz .	St
1.4.2	The system is still running fine but at only 129 MHz memory speed .	St
1.4.3	With Spread spectrum enabled it would only run at118 MHz .	St
1.4.4	Have you tried using the manual settings in the BIOS ? ?	Ques
1.4.5	Just increase the memory bus one MHZ at a time starting from 100 [ I assume that you have PC 133 memory ] , and save and exit .	St
1.4.6	The only problem is that when you get to a speed that it ca n't handle , you may have to reset the BIOS , which is the shorting of the two solder **** on the mobo with a screwdriver .	St
1.4.7	Once you find the highest speed that it will run stable at , you may find that for any type of & quot ; bad & quot ; shutdown , the system will boot up into the BIOS with thbe setting back at 100 MHz .	St
1.4.8	Then simply set it back to the speed that works .	St
1.4.9	Remember when this mobo was designed and qualified the 1700+ and later CPU 's did not exist , so there was no way that the mfr could verify what the maximum speed a specific mobo would support .	St
1.4.10	There was a later version of the mobo .	St
1.4.11	It was confusinng because they simply added another dot after the 1.05 vrsion number .	St
1.4.12	That version seems to have supported later CPU 's .	St
1.4.13	As Willy said , make sure that you have the latest BIOS .	St
1.5.1	If I remember correctly , you have to disable the 'jumperfree ' mode and use the swithes on the motherboard to configure the CPU ( this has been on the German ASUS support site a while back ) .	St
1.5.2	Apparently , the AthlonXP series are a bit more picky about signal quality than the Athlon Tbird series .	St
1.5.3	When using the dipswitches on the mobo , a different circuit , that should have better signal quality , is used .	St
1.5.4	There has been a minor update of version '1.05 ' , namely the '1.05 . '	St
1.5.5	( trailing dot ! )	St
1.5.6	to improve signal quality .	St
1.5.7	This one has official AthlonXP support .	St
1.5.8	I ca n't confirm whether or not the 'dipswitch trick ' will work .	St
1.5.9	I hope it will because I 'm expecting a 2400+ I bought on ebay .	St
1.5.10	I wo n't be dissapointed if I have to run it at a lower busspeed , as long as it runs at a higher clockspeed than my ( t ) rusty old Athlon Tbird 1.2GHz .	St
1.6.1	The following webpage has an English translation of that ASUS site : http : //www.a7vtroubleshooting.com/info/cpu/ According to this site , the Athlon XP Palomino is supported when using the dipswitches .	St
1.6.2	The XP Tbred is not yet rated .	St
