Thanks!
It seems you know what you are talking about.
I have seen this in other computers that I've worked on and I have told the client the same thing.
Just let it run.
I guess I feel kind of stupid not knowing why this is happening to even my own computer now when it wasn't for years.
I really appreciate you taking the time to answer my question, again thanks!
