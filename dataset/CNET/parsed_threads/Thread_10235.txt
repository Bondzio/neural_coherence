<s> I bought a HP a1450n last spring and am contemplating buying a new video card. </s>
<s> The cnet review of this computer states that the max video RAM supported is 256. </s>
<s> Is this because the integrated nVidia GeForce 6150 card is 256MB or is the something else (like the motherboard) limiting the amount of video RAM supported? </s>
<s> In other words if I bought a 512MB graphics card would be a waste? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> In fact you can get 1GB video cards today on desktops. </s>
<s> But a laptop was another type of machine where you wanted portability, battery powered for as many hours as possible. </s>
<s> I get the feeling you are not looking for the usual laptop but a desktop in the shape of a laptop. </s>
<s> For these you pay a premium. </s>
<s> In parting, it's rare to almost non-existent the number of laptops with user upgradeable video. </s>
<s> Be sure you get that item right. </s>

<s> Hi Bob, Actually, the a1450n is a desktop. </s>
<s> I'm looking to upgrade the video card to run more graphic intensive games. </s>
<s> I am not sure if for some reason the computer's max video memory (256MB) is limited by more than the video card itself. </s>
<s> So if I bought a 512MB graphics card would it not work or only work like a 256MB card? </s>
<s> donatena </s>
<s> But the answer is no. </s>
<s> You can fit newer cards and the drivers and get more video RAM. </s>
<s> But 256MB is plenty for most games and Vista's Aero effects. </s>
<s> What needs a 512MB video card? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hi Bob, You pose a good question. </s>
<s> I've been reading reviews on xbitlabs.com for about a year now, and from what I gather 512MB isn't needed for anything yet. </s>
<s> However, some of the more advanced cards are coming with a 512 MB option. </s>
<s> I probably won't buy a new video card for at least 6 months, but when I do the 512 MB cards might be more the norm. </s>
<s> I just wanted to be sure that if I bought one I was going to be able to utilize all 512MB. </s>
<s> Thanks again for the help. </s>
<s> I spoke with reps at circuit city and HP and neither seemed to know what I was asking. </s>

<s> Sounds like that motherboard has integrated video circuitry. </s>
<s> It supports up to 256MB video memory, meaning that it &quot;steals&quot; some of your much slower system RAM to get to 256MB for display purposes. </s>
<s> nVidia calls its shared memory technology TurboCache and ATI calls it HyperMemory. </s>
<s> It may be found integrated into motherboards or separately in video cards. </s>
<s> In desktops, these cards are the less expensive, lower performance alternatives to the other video cards that have their own dedicated (not shared) video memory. </s>
<s> If you are a gamer, then you will want to upgrade to a better card. </s>
<s> You are correct it is an integrated card. </s>
<s> If I upgrade to a dedicated card do I need to worry about disabling the integrated card or will the installation of the new card solve that problem during installation? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> In general, the steps are as follows: - remove current video drivers - install new card - start computer and disable integrated video in BIOS (optional on some motherboards) - install new video card's drivers Read ALL OF THIS LINK carefully and you should be OK: HP and Compaq Desktop PCs - Installing or Replacing a Video Card </s>
<s> Thanks again linkit. </s>
<s> The link was very informative and helpful. </s>
