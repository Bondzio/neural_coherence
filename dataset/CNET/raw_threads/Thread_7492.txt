I already installed additional ram 1.5 gb..and a wireless adapter sucessfully. my question is can I install a SATA DVD burner (there are 3 unused SATA ports) instead of an IDE (like the existing one) to avoid the whole master/slave issue of sharing the one IDE port...and is SATA plug and play or will i have to get into the BIOS and other settings that I don't yet understand...thanks in advance.

Some are thinking we'll know the future. The light in my crystal ball didn't show a flicker because all the clues are unknown (the words in red were unheeded.) Bob
