1.1.1	I was thinking of upgrading the RAM on my computer which I understood was currently 512MB .	St
1.1.2	I downloaded a freeware programme - Belarc Advisor which does a complete scan of the computer and reports on everything which is installed .	St
1.1.3	I did this to try and establish what scope there was for extra RAM .	St
1.1.4	The report tells me that there is 512MB of installed memory and that there are 4 memory slots ( 2 banks of 2 ) with a maximum capacity of 4096MB .	St
1.1.5	However , and this is where I get confused , it says that slot A0 has 128MB , slot A1 has 4096MB and slots A2 and A3 are empty .	St
1.1.6	This would make me think that the total installed memory is 4224MB which is more than the maximum .	St
1.1.7	The motherboard is MSI MS-6747 .	St
1.1.8	I also did a further scan using Crucial.com and it came up with the same memory configuration .	St
1.1.9	Can anyone explain what memory I have and what scope there is for expansion ?	Ques
1.2.1	That make board was listed the last time I tried it .	St
1.2.2	A program called CPUID and EVEREST might reveal what 's in each slot if you do n't remember or do n't want to look .	St
