At the time I was not connected to the internet, so the artist/album/song titles were not automatically added. I manually renamed the songs from &quot;Track 1&quot; etc. to their real names, and created a folder with the artist's name as its title (all from within iTunes). Upon renaming the folder, the entire CD simply disppeared and I have not been able to recover it. Is this an issue with iTunes' DRM? Does anyone know what really happened?

DRM only applies to music that you download from the Apple iTunes Music store. There is NO DRM on store purchased CD's By Folder, do you mean playlist? Was it a smart playlist? Music that is ripped into iTunes does not just go away. Take a look at your library and click on the Name column. This sorts all the library by alphabetical name. Be like Santa, check it twice. Even if you delete a playlist, the tracks still stay in the library, even though the &quot;folder&quot; is no longer there. If all else fails, rip it again. It doesn't take long, and then you will find the duplicates P

DRM is applied only to those tracks that are purchased from the iTunes Music Store and the DRM information is coded as part of the track. These tracks have a limited burn potential. I think the limit is 5 but do NOT quote me on that, it could be higher. There are also limits on the number of machines you can copy that file to. Each machine has to be authorized, done locally, so that DRM usage can be controlled. Burning the purchased tracks out to a CD and then ripping back in again, overcomes the limitation. Should you feel the need. This was the way that M$ advocated it's WMP users use to move iTunes music into WMP. This advice has since been removed from the M$ website, perhaps partly because they realized that translating a track from MP4 to MP3 or worse still WMA, was just asking for poor quality. However, if you are foolish enough to be using WMP on the other side, you will find that M$ feels it necessary to question your honesty when it comes to CD's that you have legally purchased and ripped into WMP. Transferring these tracks to another PC, or even the same one with a new HD, will prompt WMP to cast doubt on your integrity.
