I have tried changing resolutions but this has no effect and i know there can be problems playing pc games on a lcd tv, but is there any way round this? thanks for an help or suggestions!

With every post you make the following is asked so I don't have to. Note: If you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem. My bet is the video mode called up by the game is beyond the capability of the display, but without details I can't offer any help. Cheers, Bob

If you blindfold me, I can't see what I'm working on. Hey, that's your choice but be prepared to get flames on some boards if you try that. &quot;why do you need to know my system info. the computer plays the games fine but it is the screen which has the problem with any type of game.&quot; For example some video cards have tools to limit video modes, some games have settings you need to tinker with. -&gt; Your discussion has many replies now but you didn't reveal the details and the discussion is now about why the details are needed. Best of luck, Bob
