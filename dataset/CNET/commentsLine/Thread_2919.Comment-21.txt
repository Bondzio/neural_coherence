i had a hard drive failure on my 2 year old vaio desktop.
i was very distraught as i was in the middle of an important photo archival procedure.
i took it in to geek squad who told me none of my data could be recovered, but i could pay up over a thousand dollars to send it off and try and get it recovered and there was no guarantee.
i ended up looking in the phone book and found a local guy who went to geek squad, picked up my hard drive, recovered all my data, replaced the hd and loaded up all my programs for less than $200.
