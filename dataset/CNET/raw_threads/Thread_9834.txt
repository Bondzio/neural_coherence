I have bought a dell dimension E520 Pentium D Processor 805 with Dual Core Technology (2.66GHz, 533FSB), Genuine Windows XP Media Center 2005 Edition, upgraded memory to 1GB Dual Channel DDR2 SDRAM at 533MHz- 2DIMMs and a 13 in 1 Media Card Reader. This computer is configured with a 48X CD-RW/ DVD Combo Drive. Why is there only one CD etc. drive and not two? Am I missing something? Is there newer technology that does not require the use of two drives to burn? And could you comment on speed, I have Cable service. Any Help? Gordon

However if we reach back in time we remember we would fit 2 floppy drives for convenience after the price of such drives dropped. For the majority of users the dollars for this convenience is an issue. You can always fit the second drive if you wish. Bob

If you only want to burn CDs and watch DVDs, you have all you need. But if you want to burn DVDs, a new DVD burner is dirt cheap now. I have a dual layer DVD burner (I use mine for data only) and a CD burner in my system. There's nothing I can't do.

And a CD-DVD Dual Layer burner allows you to back up much much more per disc whether it's home videos or system backups. For me...they're just too cheap ($30-$40) not to have two....your $, your time, your call. Hope this helps. VAPCMD

That alone is the reason for singular CD drives. In the past, CD drives just read disks, then they could burn to disk, then DVD got in, and too they offered read only then burner. Now, its a combo drive. Of course, you install a physical 2nd int. drive if space aloows and/or ext. port allows it. tada -----Willy

It's unfortunate that your combo doesn't RW to DVD's as well as CD's, as DVD disks have much more storage space on them than CD's. It depends what you intend to do with your computer, but as people here say, combo's that RW to both CD/DVD are fairly cheap now, and you may benefit from adding one. Mark

The first cd players were slow and cost an arm and a leg. But like everything else, as the technology developed, it got better and the price dropped. It started with slow cd players. Than the speed got better. Than the players also became burners. I can remember one of my first cd burners was about a 16x speed burner that cost about $250.00. Next along came dvd players. These than cost an arm and a leg. As the techynology progressed, the cd player was mated with the dvd player for an all in one package. Finally they came out with a combo cd player/burner dvd player. Now you can get both a cd/dvd player/buners combo if you want to spend the extra money, which is not all the considerable. The lastest advancement right now is the dual layer dvd burner. These are just ball park figures, but a standard cd disk can hold about 620 meg of data. A standard dvd disk can hold 4.6 gig of data and a dual layer dvd disk can hold about double the stnadard dvd disk capacity. Currently, with a cd/dvd combo burner, the software your using to do the burn copies the data of the disk you want to burn to your hard drive. Once the copy is done your prompted to insert the blank cd/dvd disk and the data is then burned from the hard drive back to the burner and onto the disk. If you elected to invest in a 2nd cd/dvd burner, you could insert the disk containing the data you wanted to burn into one of them and a blank disk into the other and burn directly from one to the other. So in answer to your question, do you NEED to have 2? No you dont. Would you WANT to have 2 or would it be NICE to have 2? Well only you can answer that. But when you consider the low prices of these units, and the fact that your current system will not allow you to burn dvd's I would recommend you take the plunge.

Keep in mind home doesn't necessarily imply desktop. Many have made laptops the primary/only PC at home. In that case, most laptops do not have the space to accomodate 2 optical drives, so in their case, they'd need to decide on shooting for a more expensive combo drive that does much more or a cheap, more essentials only functionality. an even more minute issue, IT folk recommend reading discs from the ROM drive only as opposed to also the burner drive as well. You get best results doing so

You can get a combo good drive for about $40, from Newegg, Tiger, etc. They can read and burn CD-R/RW, DVD+R/-R/DL. You just want to make sure you have a big enough hardrive to copy from one disc to another. The burning software will have the drive read the disc and copy it to the hardrive, then the disc will eject and you will be prompted to put in a blank disc to burn what was copied to the hardrive. I used to have two drives before there were combo drives, I just prefer using a single combo drive.

Ever since CD writers came to the H/W market and the DVD writers later(now with double layer writing ability in 8GB+ space), the act of replicating CDs has become an easier task. With one as the master drive and the other as its slave, the original CD/DVD placed in the master allows the blank in the slave to get copied fast and without the trouble of using the HDD space as the intransient memory base and without making the copying devise to eject the original and ask and get the blank in. It is the same way when in those older days we used to have two floppy drives and did our Disk Copy functions without having to eject and insert floppies in the course of the program. If CD duplicating is not your need then one DVD-RW will act as your CDROM, DVDROM/RAM and CD/DVD recorder.

Most of the new burning software need only one drive. What it does, it: Your CD/DVD burner reads the disk storing an image on your hard drive and making Temp files in you Temp folder. Once the CD/DVD has been read it will ask you to insert a blank CD/DVD into your drive, it will start the burn process once it reades the media that you have insereted making sure it's the right type. If it is your CD/DVD burner will start the burn process. When compleated it wil automatically remove all back up files if you tell the software that you don't want to save the data that you just burned. If you do want to save it to burn again later you will need to make a folder in which to store the data in for burning later. Simple process.The only time you would need 2 drives is when you want to burn streight to disc. That means you have 2 burners, one is the reader and the other is the burner. It will not use any hard dick space using the method.

I'd just like to clarify something that many of these posters seem confused about. A drive that can write CDs and read DVDs is a &quot;combo drive&quot;. A drive that can write CDs and write DVDs is called a &quot;super drive&quot;. You don't see super drives being labelled with their proper name (mine says &quot;Super Multi Format CD/DVD&quot;), but combo drives always are. So if you go down to the shop and see a &quot;CD/DVD Combo Drive&quot;, that is NOT a DVD burner.

You just put the original disc in one unit and the blank DVD in the other and leave the machine do the magic without your intervention, without having to swap discs. I like to review one ore more CD/DVD contents at the same time because it saves time. More money? please, the price of DVD MULTI burner is lower than ever: you can get a great unit for US$40 or even less.
