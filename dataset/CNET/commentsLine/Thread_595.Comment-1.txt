i just finished building my first pc and i encountered this annoying problem.
when i minimize a window on the screen and then go to move the window it moves in segments....like it's rolling or under water.
it isn't smooth like it normally would be.
even a full screen, like my yahoo home page, when i take scroll bar and move the page, it goes in waves!
i'm not sure if it's a setting that isn't right.
i have already checked the smooth scrolling box in internet options and checked the mouse setting (3 frames per click...like my other computer).
any suggestions?
my computer system info is as follows: mob: dfi lanparty ut nf3 250gb cpu: amd athlon 64 3200+ newcastle (socket 754) hd: wd 160gb serial ata 150 7200rpm video card: ati radeon x700 pro agp 256mb mem: ocz ultra high performance dual channel kit 1gig 3200 (2 x 512mb) monitor: viewsonic va1912b os: windows xp pro thanks
