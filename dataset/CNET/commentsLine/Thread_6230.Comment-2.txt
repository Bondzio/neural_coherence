all router &quot;power&quot; is limited but the fcc so no router is more powerful than the next.
i will write the dwl-g550 is a card that was indeed so-so and using another antenna helped.
this is why we have other solutions like moving the router to a central location or using a second router as a wap.
sorry but the answer is no.
