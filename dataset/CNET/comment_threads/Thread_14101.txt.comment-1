I'm a gamer looking to build a NICE system.
whats the deal with dual Opteron 280's.
I know they require a server class motherboard, which scares me as far as compatability.
Should i stick with the fx 60 (or the upcoming fx62) or is the extra cost involved in the opterons worth it.
Second question, dual nvidia geforce 7800gtx's at 512mbs a piece vs. dual nvidia quadro fx 4500's at 512 mbs a piece.
are the quadros worth the money for gaming performance.
