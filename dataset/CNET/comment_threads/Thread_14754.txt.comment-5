My MacBook is connected to the internet via my Airport Extreme transceiver/router.
Suddenly it fails to connect to the internet although signal strength is high.
When I abandon the Extreme and opt for the plain old wifi offered on the primary household system, voila!
Internet.
But the Extreme is faster and preferred on this machine.
I have recycled power on the Extreme's hardware unit.
No joy.
I'm running OS-X, 10.5.2.
No software updates pending.
Thanks.
