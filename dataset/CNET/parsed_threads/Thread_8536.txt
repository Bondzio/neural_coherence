<s> Make sure virtual memory is turned on. </s>
<s> How much RAM is installed in the PowerBook? </s>
<s> If there is plenty, greater than 128MB, you may need to allocate more memory to the Office 98 applications. </s>
<s> To do this, find the application Word, SINGLE click it, go to File/Get info and increase the preferred memory size by 10MB. </s>
<s> Keep doing that until it does not quit. </s>
<s> Then do the same with XL and PowerPoint. </s>
<s> If you have less than 128Mb RAM, go shopping for more RAM for the machine, at least 256MB You may also need to reinstall the Office 98 suite. </s>
<s> You do have the CD, right? </s>
