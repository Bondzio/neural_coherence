<s> Here's a brain picker. </s>
<s> I deal with several hundred IBM Netvista PCs. </s>
<s> These are leased units and there are basically four different year(models) The second year lease are (6792&6794 desktop and tower respectfully).These two models are suppose to be identical except for the footprint configs. </s>
<s> Now the problem. </s>
<s> Not long after installing these units we began to get trouble calls on them. </s>
<s> One day they would be working fine then shut down for the night. </s>
<s> The next day upon start up the machine would go through post then come up with and error &quot;missing vmm32.vxd&quot; or simular error and the system would not finish booting. </s>
<s> I would boot the system to a 98 boot disk and check the C: drive for this file. </s>
<s> It should reside in the windows\system folder. </s>
<s> Well some of the machines had the windows\system folder totally blown away others even had the enitire windows directory gone. </s>
<s> I went around and around with IBM to no avail, even sent them one of the machines that had experienced this problem. </s>
<s> Their respose was nothing wrong with the machine and it was apparently a rouge application, virus or someone deleting these files from the hard drive. </s>
<s> Well thses machines are on a network with many other different types and models of computers and these particular ones are the only ones that experience this problem. </s>
<s> To me that knocks out the rouge application and virus since the first year leased ones have the same OS (Win98) and app loads. </s>
<s> Also it has happened to computers all over the district even in our admin offices so that eliviates someone deleting the files. </s>
<s> The mainboards of the first and second year lease are essentially the same except for second year having some revisions. </s>
<s> First lease mainboard has P5 designation, second year P6. </s>
<s> Anyone have ideas as to what's causing this or experienced it themselves please respond. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> Windows 98 has no protection from the DELETE KEY or any rogue SPYWARE or other pest. </s>
<s> It's part of the reason it's not used as widely anymore. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> There was an option called 'disable fast shutdown' which I think was removed by some update. </s>
<s> If you still have it run a test. </s>
<s> Anyway on this machine it's gone. </s>
<s> Another thought is to disable write behind caching and test. </s>
<s> Well Bob I understand what you're saying here, only thing is this happens to only the 6792-6794 machines nothing else. </s>
<s> Hard to believe that the no protection from the delete key or any spyware would just be targeting only these machines. </s>
<s> I might also mention that these machines are among the model of the known problem of swelling, leaking capacitors adjacent to the processor which causes involuntary reboots and or shutdowns. </s>
<s> I have only discovered one machine thus far with the capacitor problem in the ones I support but know of many others. </s>
<s> For the input I'll have to look into this. </s>
<s> The cache not getting flushed on some machines. </s>
<s> This item will affect only specific machines. </s>
<s> BUT and this is a big deal, it would only affect machines that didn't have all critical updates. </s>
<s> You as the administrator get to know all about this... </s>
<s> Given the age of this OS, I do not expect IBM to be able to help you. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I suppose you are refering to the L1 L2 cache not getting flushed? </s>
<s> I can see where some files could get screwed up in a situation like this but for the life of me I can't see no way in hades the entire system folder or more especially the Windows directory could actually vanish off the hard drive. </s>
<s> Like it's POOF they're gone. </s>
<s> Where can I find more info on machines not flushing the cache, Bob? </s>
<s> Thanks for your responses by the way. </s>
<s> Have cache that may need flushing. </s>
<s> Microsoft did supply a critical patch for this. </s>
<s> http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=273017 does not detail all the possible effects of this issue. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> And that could certainly explain a machine working fine one day and booting up the next with a missing vmm32.vxd error. </s>
<s> Still puzzling are the ones that have lost the entire system directory or windows directory. </s>
<s> Thanks for the info. </s>
<s> Have anything else let me know please. </s>
<s> The directory &quot;sector&quot; may need to get rewritten and ... fails. </s>
<s> The old entry is invalid and you get the effect you note. </s>
<s> Only one reason why we don't bother with FAT file systems at the office. </s>
<s> At least with NTFS, the transactions are ... part of why NTFS is more damage resitant. </s>
<s> There has been no attempts to cure this issue. </s>
<s> bob </s>
<s> Couple of co-workers and I had just discussed this and came to the same conclusion. </s>
<s> Your post just verified it. </s>
<s> Still there must be something with the particular machines we've had this problem with since the same load is on many other machines of different build and model times. </s>
<s> We have downloaded that patch and installed it on an image to be used on two school labs containing the machines in question. </s>
<s> Guess we'll see if that was the fix for this problem. </s>
<s> Thanks much for the insight and expertise! </s>
