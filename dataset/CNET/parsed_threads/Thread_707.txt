<s> Hi there, I had a HP laptop die on me last week (not a huge surprise considering age, use and the fact that that line of Pavilions had a tendency to overheat) but I was hoping to use the HD as an external HD for my other laptops and desktop. </s>
<s> I'd also like to retrieve the few files I hadn't backed up (some downloaded mp3's and a few Word docs). </s>
<s> I'm wondering though, since I can't boot the laptop to reformat the hard drive, is there going to be a problem with an already formatted master HD being plugged into one of my other computers as an external HD. </s>
<s> If so, is there a way to pull the files from the HD and reformat before building the external HD? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Purchase an external drive case (I recommend a USB-2 connection) and an adapter for the laptop drive. </s>
<s> Your choice on the case, here's the adapter cable, big bucks. </s>
