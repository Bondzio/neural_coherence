i design electronics and write embedded and more apps.
if you lead off by telling me that you are signing up with a dns service, i have to take that as fact.
then i work with that.
if you lead off by &quot;i want to hide or spoof my location&quot; then i can guess you want a proxy or vpn service.
but beware those services as they really don't hide your ip.
you reveal your ip to that service and in canada/usa and most other countries it's required to let the gov/justice departments to listen in on the traffic.
this is why you see folk that say you can hide your ip get a little beat up.
(or a lot.)
--&gt; then you have the russian proxy scandal.
here's the recent article.
as you can imagine, those that want to hide often fall victim to this.
