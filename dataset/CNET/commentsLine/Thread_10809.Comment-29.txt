works great for me.
i have used it going on 2 years.
you must have a good broadband service if your picky about sound quality.
i no longer have a land line.
you must set up udp ports 5060 an 5070 on your firewall for good flow thru or the sound will be choppy.
i like it that my phone number is no longer listed, cuts down on sales calls.
forwards all voice mails to your email inbox.
i use multiple (5) uniden dect 6 phone system with mine and it works great.
it has caller id and you can forward your calls to your cell phone or any phone you want to.
free conference calling!
call any where in the us or canada!
