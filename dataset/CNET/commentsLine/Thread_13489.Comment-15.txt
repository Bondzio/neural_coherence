sorry but i only have your posts to work with.
if there are files on the drive, get them out first.
then treat the drive as if it was blank.
start over.
sorry but how to partition and format would have me duplicate easy to find web content.
this issue is not unknown but the way i fix it is simple.
i prepare the drive on the new machine.
