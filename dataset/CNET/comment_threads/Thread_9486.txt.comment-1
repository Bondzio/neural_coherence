I have a 160GB SimpleTech SimpleDrive USB 2 External Hard drive.
It's been working fine for several months, and now all of sudden its giving me problems.
I can see all the files on the hard drive, and can delete them occasionally, but anytime I try to copy or access the files windows slows to a complete stop and nothing happens until I pull the plug.
I've tried 4 different USB cables, I've tried plugging it into a different computer, and nothing has worked.
I've tried defragging the hard drive several times, I've run chkdsk a bunch of times, and everything comes out normal.
I've tried running chkdsk in deepscan mode, but then it just tells me that for a bunch of files it doesn't have the space to replace the bad sectors, even though it has about 20GB free.
Any suggestions?
