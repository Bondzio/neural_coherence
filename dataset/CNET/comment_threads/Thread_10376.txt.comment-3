Thank you for pointing me towards Netswitcher, and I will definitely check it out.
However, I am definitely a novice when it comes to networking, and I could really use assistance in establishing the very basic procedural steps for installing a router at home, given that I already have the notebook adapter card and that I know all the security/network name/password options I want to put in place.
Holding all that aside, if you were advising someone on how to install a router from the moment it is purchased at the store, specifically what is the appropriate order of the various steps that are necessary?
I have been told that I need to download upgrades/patches from the Netgear website, to install software on my computer, and to physically connect the router, but I am not sure of what order to complete these steps.
Any help in that regard would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks!
