<s> I have a 32MB ATI Rage 128 ULTRA, and it doesn't seem to be listed on the ATI website, and I cannot find the drivers for it. </s>
<s> The closest thing on the site is a ATI Rage 128 Pro, I tried using the drivers for that, and it doesn't work. </s>
<s> i found this, &quot;32MB ATI RAGE ULTRA 4X AGP&quot; card that Dell distribute with some of their systems. </s>
<s> Also known as Rage 128 Pro Ultra. </s>
<s> that was from a google search, drivers were also available if you havent come across this. </s>
