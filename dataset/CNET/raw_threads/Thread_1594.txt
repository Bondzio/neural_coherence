(don't flame..CPU speed is part of the equation, but I've seen systems w/Slow CPUs' smoke faster CPUs' due to the M/B and memory) See http://www.aceshardware.com/Spades/read.php?article_id=5000186 Old but still prevelant Bill

If he were to leave it set for 400 MHz and plugged in the PC2100 [133/266], yes the system would fail to boot immediately. If he [she?] were to first change the BIOS to the 133/266 memory bus speed, it likely will work fine. Of course, the CPU will not run at its maximum speed. [called underclocking]

If you are getting something like a DELL then you might not have this option. In your BIOS you will need to find your memory properties. You need to set it to DDR266 look for memory speed: AUTO or LIMIT or simply DDR400/333/266/200. As an overclocker, this can come in very handy if you know how to use it. GOOD LUCK
