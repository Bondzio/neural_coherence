awesome!
thanks for the reply.
by reading some of the articles, it looks like raid 5 does support 3 disks.
i was worried that i would need a minimum of 4. now i'm going to do some digging and see what one i should buy.
they tested a few but im still not quite sure if all of the controllers out there support only 3 drives for raid 5. only reason im worried is because the controller thats built onto my mother board doesnt support 3; you have to use 4 drives.
