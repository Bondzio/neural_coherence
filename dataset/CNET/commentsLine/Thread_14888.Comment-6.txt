ok, thanks for the reply.
i understand about waiting, you can wait forever and there will always be something else about to come out, you must take the plunge at some point!
this time though, there is an entirely new operating system, and dx 10. i guess i mean to ask, is dx 10 so radically different that current cards will be incpable of running it, or is is simply a matter of liscensing and money that will stop current cards from running it?
i just cant imagine every card out right now suddenly becoming obsolete the day dx 10 is released.
i guess another way to put it is this way: when will game makers start really using dx 10 to make games?
if 99% of the video cards out there are not dx 10 capable, whats the point of even using dx 10?
they may as well play the waiting game and wait until a majority of users have a dx 10 card.
