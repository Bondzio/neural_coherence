It has been working fine but now shortly after it dials out, it will reboot the computer. Also, the modem isnt always showing up in the device manager.

If so, turn it of. It is also possible that the reset, if XP is your OS, has detected a fatal error. By design, it can reset your system rather than hang it. If this is the case, we may still be looking at a hardware issue. Good luck.
