i didn't clean the heatsink yet but i noticed what's the problem here i checked the cpu usage while running the gpu on 100% it only takes 5 to 10% of cpu usage but when my cpu and gpu are 100% loaded he can't do that 5 to 10% cpu usage correctly hence the framerate spike drops i do get this problem with games because it probably taxes my cpu too much as well i thought he would just lower the framerate of th gpu to compensate the load on the cpu but apperently i'm wrong
