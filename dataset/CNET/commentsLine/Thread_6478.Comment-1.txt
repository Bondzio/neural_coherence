hello all, i would like to create multi-wlan for personal communications, and gaming purposes.
each wlan (is located in seperate house) and consists of a wireless ap wirely- connected to wireless router.
the computers in each of these wlans are connected wirelessly to the router.
the houses (containing the wlans) are locates within the region of a central wireless internet ap tower antenna.
i managed to utilize this central ap to make the connection, and make multiplayer gaming on two computers (in different houses and without using the internet services), each computer is connected to the central ap by a usb witrless adapter.
my question is what are the necessary configurations that i need to make on the routers and aps?
if it helps, i have a number of different tp-link routers (wr1043, wr743, wr543), micronet aps.
please note that wr743 and 543 have ap client mode that can be used to simultaneously connecting wirelessly to central ap and to attaced computers.
i'll appreciate any advice..
