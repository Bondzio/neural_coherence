Hi, I have had similiar problem with my PC but mine is hard wired connecting with a netgear router.I tried everything you can think of,New NIC,replaced cables,anti virus/spyware scans in safe mode, including re-installing the OP system XP PRO and after 6 months and with help from other guys.I gave up and tried a USB to RJ45 adapter and I am online no problem all for the sake of 14 .Wished I had tried it earlier.So I would recommend borrowing a wireless USB adapter first to try it.
Good luck.
