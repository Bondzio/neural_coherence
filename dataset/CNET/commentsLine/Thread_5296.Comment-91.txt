if you're looking for a system capable of gaming casually, or at least having the ability to game casually, the integrated graphic processors are seldom sufficient.
take a look online at the specs for the system.
if you see that the motherboard includes a &quot;pci-express x16 slot&quot; then you should be able to upgrade the graphics card to some extent, so long as the power supply is capable of delivering enough current.
the amount of memory on the onboard graphics processor can sometimes be adjusted, but using this will &quot;steal&quot; from your system memory pool.
even if you don't play games, a slightly upgraded card can give you a much better experience for 2d desktop work, photos, video (especially if you're looking to watch blu-ray) and online content since the new versions of flash support gpu acceleration.
even so, a decent card for all this and some mild gaming doesn't need to cost over $100 and nowadays, that will buy a lot of graphics card.
even so, you still may not have to upgrade.
if a game seems to lag, try adjusting a few settings.
this can make a big difference.
