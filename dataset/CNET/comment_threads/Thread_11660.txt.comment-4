I've tried locating the drivers and on the gateway website I have downloaded 3 networking drivers, but none have really worked.
One did manage to turn the wireless radio on, yet the Windows Zero Configuration (WZC) had a conflict searching for wireless networks because the Broadcom driver was the one in charge of it, yet it's not searching for wireless networks, so it's just a mess.
I need to get that broadcom driver out, and try to install the original wireless radio, but I wouldn't know under what device it would be or how to locate the driver without access to the internet.
