thanks for the help, and guidance, though I admit some of the specs on the parts confuse me, the numbers and such get all mixed in my head, I might be a lost cause... as for a budget, well I never thought about it, though I really should have, I guess with me being a part time cashier my budget is meager at best.
I was hoping to buy each part individually as I can afford each one, but I guess if I have doubts on comparability that wouldn't be best.
I have put together a PC before, though it was at school and only basic stuff really...
