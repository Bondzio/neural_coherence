Turn off unneeded stuff with Task Manager to free up RAM and also see if you have some unwanted programs running that shouldn't, or you don't need (spyware, malware).

Hot Dog Pro 7.0 may be trying to install in a memory location that is taken. Hot Dog Pro 7.0 is what type of application? Bill .

Since Hotdog Pro won't run under WinXP right mouse click on the hotdog icon and choose properties. Under the compatability tab choose win98/ME. Haven't had any problems yet.

I had the same prob with HD 7.03 in XP RPro even after cleaning the reg manually to remove all entries left behind by add/remove (lots of them & only 1 shared which didn't seem to affect anything else when removed). Thanks for the original post on the fix !!! -- Yakkityakk
