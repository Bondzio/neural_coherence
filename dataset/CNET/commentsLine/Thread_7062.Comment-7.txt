it's a bit late for me to want to pull the fan and cpu apart right now, but i can only figure there's probably something wrong with the dimm under the v8, since i pulled the other piece out, but the usual start-up beeps that occur on a normally-functioning system are missing.
if i can't troubleshoot tomorrow evening i'm going to have to take it in to a shop.
