<s> Where do you find what CPU's are compatible with an ASUS board? </s>
<s> I know on the ASUS website but where? </s>
<s> Anyway I'm just trying to find out if a Pentium D925 is compatible with an ASUS P5WD2 Premium. </s>
<s> I think it is but I'm not 100%. </s>
<s> Plus what do you think about that processor as an upgrade for that board as from a single core. </s>
<s> I would also like to find out what the maximum processor is that I can put in there is, within financial reason. </s>
<s> Of course that changes with time so I would like to find the list of all the processors that go in there so I can watch as the prices drop. </s>
<s> Thanks JW </s>
