<s> Hello all, I was wondering which set DDR3 would be faster for a gaming computer... 4xGig DDR3 1066Mhz with a Cas Latency of 7-7-7-20 or 4xGig DDR3 1333Mhz with a Cas Latency of 9-9-9-27 Thank you in advance! </s>
<s> the tighter timings for the ddr3-1066 won't overcome a speed grade and the ddr3-1333 will still be faster. </s>

<s> : notice that ddr2-1066 performs best. </s>
<s> if you haven't bought the mobo yet, you might want to save money and stick with ddr2. </s>
<s> if you want the best performance, go with ddr3-1600 cl6/7 or faster. </s>
<s> it will outperform practically any ddr2 configuration. </s>
