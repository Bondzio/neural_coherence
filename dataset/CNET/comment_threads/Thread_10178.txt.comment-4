an aftermarket HS Fan to provide better cooling than the stock unit.
Also didn't see a CD-DVD Burner/Drive....another must for me.
Perhaps most important....I'd be looking at other MBs.....like the GA-970A-D3P it stipulates support for the CPU you listed and rates way better based on buyer feedback.
