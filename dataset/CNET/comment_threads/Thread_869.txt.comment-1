For some reason my pc started to run scan disk after a normal shut down.Every time i start the computer after a normal shutdown it runs,and it's not the short scan it's the complete scan.The first time it did it i let it run all the way thru but after that i just cancel.I have disabled it but i would like to fix the problem.
Any ideas?
Im running a 750 athlon with win/me.
Thanks
