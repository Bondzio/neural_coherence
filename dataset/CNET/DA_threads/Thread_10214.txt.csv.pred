1.1.1	I 'm getting a new computer soon , and I was wondering what is the best gaming PC I could get for under $ 700 .	St
1.1.2	Thanks !	St

1.3.1	The only good gaming PC I 've found so far that fits in my budget is the Dell XPS 7100 , but since this is a year old , I did n't know if better ones had come out .	St
1.4.1	Gaming continues to lean heavily on the video card .	St
1.4.2	Here 's a link of cards that I always suggest checking out when shopping for such - & gt ; http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-gaming-graphics-card-geforce-gtx-590-radeon-hd-6990,2879.html If you took your XPS 7100 and popped a nice card into it , you 'd have a nice gamer machine for most of us .

1.5.1	Our review in http : //reviews.cnet.com/desktops/dell-studio-xps-7100/4505-3118_7-34117339.html mentions $ 1149 .	St

1.6.1	I have n't actually bought the XPS , so should I buy it and then put a new video card in it , or should I buy a newer computer altogether ?	Ques
1.7.1	Gamers tend to be a finicky bunch .	St
1.7.2	Some must have the high end cards .	St
1.7.3	Some must have a machine that & quot ; looks & quot ; a certain way .	St
1.7.4	Here we have 700 bucks so you have to search what 's out there at that price and see what fits .	St
1.7.5	Unless you get some ready to use machine 200 bucks could be used up just on Windows .	St
1.7.6	So the budget is much less than what you may be happy with .	St
1.7.7	Share with the forum what you found so far .	St
1.7.8	Bob PS .	St
1.7.9	The world is a big place .	St
1.7.10	So it 's not possible for me to find the 700 dollar unit in most countries .	St
1.8.1	That review was a year ago , and the price has dropped to $ 550 for the least expensive model .	St
1.9.1	But do n't try to save on the video card .	Sug
1.9.2	And I think 4 GB RAM is the minimum for a gaming PC .	St
1.9.3	Kees	St
1.10.1	The & quot ; 1GB ATI Radeon HD 5870 & quot ; is way up there on the GPU list so GAMING should be nice and fine .	St
