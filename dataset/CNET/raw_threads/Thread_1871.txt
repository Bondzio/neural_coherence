When I play videogames both vents blow hot air out and work perfectly. However when I am simply browsing the internet or not even on my comp, only the left fan runs and it is very loud. The right side (which fan isnt running) is noticeably hotter. What could be wrong with my comp? This has been going on for about two months and it really worries me because the laptop is only 1 year old

They get turned-ON when it gets hotter for whatever setting or sensor activation. Since, you mentioned a 1yr. use, maybe its time to do at least the basic &quot;cleaning cycle&quot; of the laptop. Once done and it acts the same, then its done what its setting were at. You should also review any fan operational setting are at, either at the BIOS level or a pgm. designed for your model# laptop. You may need to check your manual in this case. As always, it helps to provide the laptop details here to better answer your ?. tada ------Willy

The main thing that bugs me though is that it seems that the laptop is using the one fan too an extreme when its not necessary. What happens is I leave my laptop for 10 minutes, when I comeback the one fan is roaring while the other does nothing, but if I dont leave my laptop and am constantly browsing the web or typing neither fan is really blowing. Once the fan starts going it goes on and off until I shut down or restart my computer. My BIOS is up to date. My Laptop is an Alienware m17x R3 with i7quad core and Radeon 6990 HD Graphics card
