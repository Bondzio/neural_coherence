Hi there, I am also having the same problem.
Whenever I try to run the defrag-either from Norton SystemWorks, or from properties under My Computer&gt;Drive C: it replies back with &quot;Drive C may not be configured properly&quot;.
I try to run a complete scan disk, and it says there is no error.
I am &quot;running&quot; at 59% defragmentation, and the computer is so slow, and running horribly (surprise, surprise).
I am current on my AVG (antivirus), Zone Alarm (firewall), Ad-Aware, and Spy-Bot, and have resolved all those other problems.
Any ideas, please?!
I've no idea how to solve this problem!
Thank you!
