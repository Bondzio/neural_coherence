i did a fresh reinstallation of windows xp and i need to find files that are hidden.
i have about 15 gigs worth of music and i cannot access them.
i know they're in there because the same amount of space is used up on the hard drive.
the pie chart and &quot;free space&quot; are nearly the same as before i reinstalled windows.
thanks, clint
