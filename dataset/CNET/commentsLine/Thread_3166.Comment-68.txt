the answer to your question is a definitive &quot;yes&quot;!
please remeber that external hard drives are no more than internal hard drives parked in nice little drive enclosures with a power supply and an interface to your computer.
generally speaking, if you open the enclosure, you will likely find a pata or sata drive that you could install directly inside your computer with a little know how.
the manufacturer of the the drive provides mtbf (mean time between failure) specifications usuually with a 300k hour rating.
300k hours is approximately 11+ years of 24/7 continuous use, and most of us will tell you that this specification refers to optimal usage under optimal conditions which almost none of us have unless we run a line conditioner in tandem with a ups.
understand that power fluctuations (i.e.
drops, spikes, brown outs, surges, etc.)
will gradually damage the circuitry, spindle motor, and heads in an electro-magnetic device such as a hard drive.
so you can usually expect atleast half of that life span running continuously unless you take a major power hit.
this means that pretty soon you will be operating on borrowed time if you use the drive continuously.
if you only use the drive occasionally, say for backing up data, then you probably have a few years to go.
but many think that most of the wear and tear to a hard drive is powering it on and off.
dependent on the data you are storing to the drive, and its criticality if lost, you might want to buy a secondary drive.
they are cheap!
the question with any hard drive isn't if, but when.
i hope this answers your question.
