I'm having a problem with playing back audio on the CD-drive. Data recording/playback works well on both drives. Dell Tech support are not much use so I thought I'd seek other opinions. I'm an PC amateur, but I think my PC is configured with a single IDE cable from the motherboard which goes to the CD (middle connector) and DVD (end connector). My CD sound is choppy in this configuration. I tried swapping the cables round and found that the DVD sound was choppy. So whichever device is connected to the 'middle' cable connector gives poor sound. It's identified as '2' on the cable. My simple brain told me that there's probably a problem with the IDE cable - so I ordered a new one from DELL. However, when I searched the net I found all sorts of confusing stuff about Slaves/Masters/Cable select - so I'm starting to wonder if it is the cable or whether something is set up incorrectly with my system (bear in mind it's less than a month old - and you'd have thought(!) that DELL would have set it up correctly). If anyone has any insights into this problem I'd been very grateful - the DELL tech support guys seem little more qualified than me! Thanks.
