<s> My desktop computer died today and I think it's a motherboard issue, but I wanted to confirm that it wasn't something more simple like a power supply issue before buying a new computer. </s>
<s> Specs: Dell Dimension E510 Windows XP Media Center 32 bit My computer has not given me any problems or system errors for the last 4 years. </s>
<s> While I was typing in Word, the computer proceeded to shut down, but not the way that it does when a power outage occurs. </s>
<s> The programs shut down (firefox asked me if it wanted me to save windows, with 5 messages about this; another program I had open came up with an End Now screen), and then the windows splash came on the screen as it does when the computer is actually shutting down. </s>
<s> At that point the computer turned off, and did not restart. </s>
<s> When I pushed the power button, the button did light up green, the system made noise for about 5 seconds as if it was trying to turn over and boot, and the windows splash came on the screen briefly. </s>
<s> After 5 seconds of this, the computer powered off. </s>
<s> Pushing the power button after that did nothing, even after waiting an hour. </s>
<s> When I unplug the computer and then plug it back in, the power light does turn green for about 2 seconds and the computer sounds like it is starting, and then it turns off. </s>
<s> Nothing appears on the monitor. </s>
<s> This also happens if I turn off the power strip it is plugged into, and then turn it on again. </s>
<s> So the power light turns green for about 2 seconds whenever power is restored to the computer, but just pushing the power button does nothing. </s>
<s> I of course tried changing the outlet, but that was not the problem. </s>
<s> Just in case it was a memory issue, I removed one set of RAM from the desktop and tried to power it on, and then replaced it and removed the other set. </s>
<s> The same thing occurred as before - when the computer was plugged in again, the power light turned green for about 2 seconds and then turned off. </s>
<s> Any advice would be welcome before I buy a new computer. </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> You can try unplugging all hard drives, CD ROMs, etc. </s>
<s> to see if power stays on. </s>
<s> If it does, you plug things back in one at a time (power off each time) and try again. </s>
<s> A marginal power supply will shut down if an overload is detected but this wouldn't mean any particular device was the culprit. </s>
<s> Many builders use the smallest wattage power supplies they can get away with and, over time, their capability decreases. </s>
<s> I'd go with the PS first but do a thorough dust bunny removal from the machine and pay special attention to the heat sink and fan assy. </s>
<s> Think over &quot;what could it possibly be starting with the cheapest part first?&quot; These ideas are not definitive. </s>
<s> Some get uppity if the ideas don't work out. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> The cmos battery. </s>
<s> In many machines the usual CR2032 50 cent item ( http://www.amazon.com/Handheld-battery-lithium-ion-pack/dp/B000X107GI for example) can cause machines to not boot. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The power supply. </s>
<s> At about 30 to 50 bucks this is the next most likely. </s>
<s> The odd part of your story is that graceful shutdown. </s>
<s> But the rest of the story is the usual. </s>
<s> Type THE DEAD PC at google for more ideas. </s>

<s> Thanks for the feedback. </s>
<s> The only thing regarding the power supply that seems odd to me is that the green power light did come on briefly when I restored power to the system (by plugging it in or turning on the power strip), even though it did not when I pushed the power button. </s>
<s> Could that happen if the power supply wasn't working? </s>
<s> By the way, this morning it is not responding at all (no green light even for a second) when I turn on the power strip or plug it in. </s>
<s> The symptoms do not mean much here. </s>
<s> A bum motherboard could do anything so let's look at google. </s>
<s> Use these words. </s>
<s> HOW TO TEST A PC POWER SUPPLY? </s>
<s> You'll discover how to power one up without much attached (we use a dead hard drive to provide a small load) and a Volt meter to check the supply levels. </s>
