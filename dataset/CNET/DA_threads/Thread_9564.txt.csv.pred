1.1.1	I have dual displays on my PC and would like to add a third and I 'm seeking advice on what I need hardware wise .	St
1.1.2	I have the monitors .	St
1.1.3	I just need an appropriate video card ( i.e .	St
1.1.4	a second video card ) .	St
1.1.5	I DO N'T want to spend much money on this .	St
1.1.6	Here are my specs : -I 'm running 64-bit Vista , to be upgraded to 64-bit win7 shortly .	St
1.1.7	It 's a Dell Studio XPS Core i7 PC .	St
1.1.8	-I believe this is my motherboard : http : //support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/435MT/en/SM/techov.htm -My current video card is an ATI Radeon HD 3450 .	St
1.1.9	It handles two displays fine .	St
1.1.10	-Ideally I would have DVI and VGA connected monitors to this video card ( 1920x1080 and 1680x1050 ) I would like add a third monitor , which I have already , 1600x900 .	St
1.1.11	From what I understand , I can do this by adding a second video card .	St
1.1.12	But I do n't know what to buy .	St
1.1.13	I know an internal video card has to be compatible and ca n't go beyond what my motherboard and PSU can take .	St
1.1.14	But I know there are also external USB video cards and I 'm wondering if one of those would be the way to go .	St
1.1.15	I 'm not into gaming , but I do video editing .	St
1.1.16	The ATI card works fine for such purposes .	St
1.1.17	So my third display will be used for work - displaying documents , web browsing , etc .	St
1.1.18	I would have no problem unplugging the USB attached monitor during video editing if need be .	St
1.1.19	So I want a cheap solution that will allow for a third display , one that will support the resolution and give a decent picture and not impact the quality of the other two displays .	St
1.1.20	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	You could fret about the compatibility ( I do n't ) or move forward .	St
1.2.2	That is , I ca n't assuage fears here but if I wanted another display as you noted I 'd get a PCIe x1 video card ( newegg and amazon have them ) then pop it in then install the drivers .	St
1.2.3	Or I 'd look at the Sewell USB video solutions .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	My radeon graphics card also has an HDMI port .	St
1.3.2	So it has DVI HDMI and VGA .	St
1.3.3	Does that mean it can support 3 monitors ?	Ques
1.4.1	I 've yet to see one that allows all three to be used like you wanted .	St
1.5.1	Can you give me an example of a PCIe x1 card I could buy ?	Ques
1.5.2	I 'm not sure what PCIe x1 means exactly .	Res
1.5.3	I 'm assuming that it has something to do with the fact that there is only one slot on my motherboard that is the specs that fit my current graphics card ?	Ques
1.6.1	Here 's the 5450 on newegg .	St
1.6.2	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814161354 The PCIe x1 is what those slots on the motherboard are .	St
1.6.3	If I were to bet , the x16 slot is in use but I ca n't tell from the post so far .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	If you look at my motherboard in the above link it 's the one plugged into slot # 25 .	St
1.7.2	So the one you 're recommending would be plugged into slot # 27 or 28 , right ?	Ques
1.7.3	And they 'd both be in use simultaneously ?	Ques
1.7.4	Just to follow up : -I 'd rather spend less money .	St
1.7.5	What 's the cheapest one I could get that would work on my system with a 1600x900 monitor ?	Ques
1.7.6	-second , will my PSU have enough juice to support 3 displays ?	Ques
1.8.1	I think you can figure out that .	St
1.8.2	As to cheapest , you go shopping .	St
1.8.3	I only go as far as this then you get to do the work .	St
1.8.4	Sorry if that upsets anyone but this is all volunteer and I only go so far .	St
1.8.5	The juice issue is a good question and why I picked this card .	St
1.8.6	So you do n't have a juice issue ( unless there is more added to the machine that we know about . )	St
1.8.7	Bob .	St
