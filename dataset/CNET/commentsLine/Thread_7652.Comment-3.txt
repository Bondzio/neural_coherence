your 8800,is that a 1gb ,or a 512mb ?
..just curious.
i don't know,but i can share some experience.
i had a 400mhz,a 1.2mhz,and 2.4mhz pcs on my lan a few yrs ago...all were maxed with ram.i have alot of dated nvdia video cards laying around,so i eperimented.i was curious if a slow machine would benefit from a fast video card.i started with a 32mb in the 400,then 64,128,and finally a 256 (all cards used the same nvidia driver so it was easy.thanks nvidia !
i installed tiger woods 2003 and went to work.i figured anything above a 32 or 64 would be useless overkill on that ancient 400,but i was wrong.the game ran smoother,and smoother untill i reached my 256 ceiling.
i still have that 1.2,and just installed lord of the rings on it.the game demands a 1.8 cpu min,yet my 1.2 runs it smooth with a 7600gs (512mb) installed.
(even though the 7600 wants a 8x agp slot,and the 1.2 only supports a 4x) experiment results say fast video cards are worth it,in any machine.cpu's are a distant second in comparison.
