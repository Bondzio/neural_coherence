help.apple.com is one of my trusted websites, but the options, in any combination, render a warning window with an exclamation in a yellow triangle and a &quot;yes&quot; with an ok button.
when i click the button, nothing happens.
why is this happening?
i have tried several combinations, same result.
am running a windows 7 os (my daughter owns the mac pro).
thanks for the info about the stabilization issue, especially if we get a camcorder with a cmos image sensor.
does this mean that we can turn off ilife's built-in video stabilization feature to get a less distorted picture?
(i can't check that right now - mac pro is not in the house.)
i will definitely get a tripod for concert and dance recordings, so i hope the pictures will be stable to begin with.
thanks again, awaiting reply about the mac website with options to find compatible camcorder (though maybe i have to ask for help from apple).
