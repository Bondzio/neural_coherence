But do you think this a VERY bad situation or just easy?
Cuz I havent written anything on the drive since I deleted it.
Just tried to boot, it failed, the slipped it into my enclosure, hooked it up to the laptop and tried a few programs and now with the full version of getdataback I am trying to recover.
