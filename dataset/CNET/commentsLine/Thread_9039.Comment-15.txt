ill keep on the editors.
you would think it would be easy to mention if a tablet has a stylus, and how many levels of pressure it has, maybe a little more difficult who makes the tech...but even that cant be too hard to find out.
this little bit of info like this in a review would greatly help artist with me in looking at what tablet to get.
i am sure there are artists that want everything for nothing.
my experience, as i mentioned, is just different from yours.
myself, and the other digital artists i know have talked about this for a long time, and most of us would be willing to pay $2000 and up if a tablet really met our needs.
$1200 and up if a tablet is mostly there ( i think i mentioned, the 2 things that seem to be missing for us artists types is more that 4gig of ram and a dedicated video card) to be honest, most of us keep hoping(but in no way expecting) that wacom would team up with a manufacture, for a wacom branded high end tablet.....but none of us are really expecting that.
wacom already has the attention and devotion of the niche of digital artists, and many of us have willingly paid a high price for the cintiq, that's why we think they would be a good company to market to this niche.
i am excited to see what win8 (non rt) tablets are coming in the next months....who knows maybe something will really stick out.
