No mention of power or cooling and the rest of the machine.
However I'd like to read that the power supply is 450 or more Watts and that you tried it with the cover off to sniff out cooling issues.
In closing, no operating system was noted but if compatible I'd run Housecall and EWIDO to eject what they find.
