1.1.1	I was shopping around for a new 19&quot; LCD and wanted a decent resopnse time for gaming.	St
1.1.2	I hit Best Buy to touch/feel and saw the ViewSonic VX910 for 449.00 and thought hmmm, but a 25ms response time would not cut it in CounterStike Source, so I went online and saw on the ViewSonic web site the VX910 has a 16 ms response time...hmm.	St
1.1.3	I went back to BB and called ViewSonic from there...any LCD made AFTER December is 16 ms.	St
1.1.4	I gave them the Serial Number of the model on display it was 25 and then the one from the box I was to buy and YIPPIE it was 16!!!!!	St
1.1.5	So, for that price I am happy .	St
1.1.6	Any - just an FYI for any gamers looking for a good LCD 19&quot;...it is SO SWEET.	St
1.2.1	see the Samsung 915N 8 ms and great price!!!!!!!!!!!	St
1.2.2	!	St
1.3.1	I was personally gonna say, 16ms is still pretty high..	St
