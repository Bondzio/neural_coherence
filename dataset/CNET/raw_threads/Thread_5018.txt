Let's name them account A and account B. When I log on to account A the CD and DVD drives work perfectly and when I switch to account B, they don't. I get the following message &quot; drive:\is not accessible. Access is denied&quot;. If I log on account B they work and then switch to account A, they don't. That means they work only with the FIRST account. They use to work on both accounts. I would grately appreciate any help. Thanks a lot

I still have the same problem the drives. When I double-click on the drives in Windows Explorer, it still says that the drives are not accessible.

Look up REMOVE UPPERFILTERS LOWERFILTERS on google.com after uninstalling Nero. This is pretty proper stuff if there is no CD in the drive (you didn't say.) Or the user has no rights. Bob

Indeed, there was a INCD issue, but even if there is a CD/DVD, it does that, but I finnaly found out from where the problem came. Some program changed the the rights for the devices. I just gave the rights back and it works!! Thanks soo much for your help. Have a good one Rapheek
