1.1.1	I mean to leave a pc ( XP Pro ) unattended for weeks , collecting data from meteorological instruments for a moment every hour or so .	St
1.1.2	The site has a 30w solar panel and lead-acid batteries with about 100 amp-hours available before the charge controller turns off the load for low battery voltage .	St
1.1.3	Days could pass before the sun comes out enough to charge the batteries , so I want to reduce the power requirement of the pc as much as possible .	Sug
1.1.4	It has solid state IDE storage , video disabled and an external 12v power supply , and needs about 20w when active .	St
1.1.5	That load would use up the batteries in less than three days of no sun .	St
1.1.6	I 'm thinking that if the pc could download the met data and go into standby until the next data is available , the power use could be reduced by a factor of ten or so .	St
1.1.7	The sun and batteries could easily keep up with that .	St
1.1.8	I 'd set the no-activity interval to 5 minutes to get the pc to go into standby .	St
1.1.9	How to wake it up again ?	Ques
1.1.10	After the met data logger has accumulated 175 datasets , it sends them to the pc on a serial port so maybe I could use activity on a serial line to activate the USB-wakeup function of the pc .	St
1.1.11	I would be grateful for comments on this idea and suggestions for better approaches , that solve the basic problem that I need more power or less consumption .	St
1.2.1	I have this netbook I put on the Watt Meter and it draws 9 Watts when running and the screen has shut off .	St
1.2.2	For reference the make and model is the eMachines 250-1162 .	St
1.2.3	I 've used both bluetooth and usb to serial converters with it along with apps I 've written .	St
1.2.4	For even lower power I 've used Windows Mobile phones with the apps in C # and the serial connection via bluetooth serial ports .	St
1.2.5	As to your method , you may have to try it .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks Bob .	St
1.3.2	I wish I 'd known about the eMachines 250-1162 before I got so far down the road I 'm on .	St
1.4.1	As to waking up , it could be just a matter of the bios set to wake on usb activity .	St
1.4.2	Or you researching the use of the windows scheduler .	St
1.4.3	From memory , the current versions of Windows 7 can wake from sleep when scheduled .	St
1.4.4	This is not an offer to write the app but to chat about how to research it further .	St
1.4.5	And to share that apps on windows mobile up to 6.5 is fairly easy with Visual Studio Pro 2008 .	St
1.4.6	I demo & quot ; your first app in 5 minutes & quot ; on that so it ca n't be more than a few days for your average programmer to have their first WM apps out and running .	St
1.4.7	I think my Pharos m619 tops out at 2 Watts with everything going ( GPS , Cell Phone , WIFI and Bluetooth . )	St
1.4.8	So it makes for a fine little data collector .	St
1.4.9	And with the cell phone it can email home the data .	St
1.4.10	Bob	St
