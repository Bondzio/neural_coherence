1.1.1	Hello , I 've been looking at 3 computers one is a Sony Viao , the other one is a Systemax and the the 3rd one is a V2 Premier .	St
1.1.2	Can anyone tell me something about these or give me some advice please , so I do n't make a major mistake for the second time ?	Ques
1.1.3	Thanks , Sky	St
1.2.1	My experience with Sony support on a dozen office laptops has me writing that Sony needs some serious whacks around the head about after-sale support .	St
1.2.2	Out of the 12 , 6 died immediately and we spent untold hours shipping and on the phone about the units .	St
1.2.3	In the end , the Sony story was these were not suitable units to be placed on a business desktop for use during the day .	St
1.2.4	In otherwords , you should only use them for an hour or two at a time .	St
1.2.5	Nothing in any printed literature noted such a limitation but it may have been true since we could only manage to eek usage out of the units by having the users shutdown during lunch .	St
1.2.6	Another issue with a Sony is they pretty much treat it like a TV .	St
1.2.7	If you change the OS or add a device , the support vanishes .	St
1.2.8	While this can be true with other vendors , Sony seems to be more extreme with this .	St
1.2.9	As to the other makes , such are clones and one would have to rip off the lid and survey what 's inside to tell .	St
1.2.10	Why not a Dell/HP ?	Ques

1.5.1	I do n't know exactly what it is you are looking for in a home computer , but this looks like it should work for what you seem to be looking for , but you have buy a seperate monitor and speakers , but it will still end up cheaper than 2,000 here is what I think might work for you http : //www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp ?
