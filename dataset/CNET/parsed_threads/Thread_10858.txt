<s> Running Windows XP home, SP2, have USB external hard drive formatted NTFS. </s>
<s> The drive was working fine and is fairly new. </s>
<s> Suddenly, the connection was lost and the drive is no longer recognized by the system, neither in My Computer, nor in Disk Management. </s>
<s> I checked the connections inside the external enclosure and everything is tight. </s>
<s> When I turn on the drive, the fans go on, but the light does not. </s>
<s> Does that mean that the drive went bad, and if so, has all hope been lost on retrieval of the information that was on it? </s>
<s> I am a relative newbie and am willing to bring the drive to someone who knows how to do such things, if someone can point me in the right direction of where to turn. </s>
<s> Sometimes on the one that I have the systems looses it. </s>
<s> So I shut down the PC and power it off, then power off the ext HD. </s>
<s> Then power on the PC let it boot up after it's up then power on the ext HD and hok it up a USB port. </s>

<s> Ext. </s>
<s> HDs are nothing more than a small p/s(not all) and and the i/f plus the HD. </s>
<s> The HD usually is an EIDE type and if push comes to shove, open the ext. </s>
<s> HD case and swap the info provided it powers-UP with an int. </s>
<s> IDE connection within your system. </s>
<s> What may have happened is either the USB power got hosed or the HD case was. </s>
<s> If not, then a system acknowledgement is lost. </s>
<s> Try another USB port or another system to see if it works elsewhere. </s>
<s> Beware, if you have warranty, don't open case as that will void warranty. </s>
<s> Also, verify under the device mgr. </s>
<s> area that the USB are working or at least some other USB device works at the port in question. </s>
<s> This how I would attempt to correct for now.... tada -----Willy </s>
<s> what is p/s and i/f? </s>
<s> I am a newbie, please don't abbreviate. </s>
<s> I do have a 1-year warranty so I do not want to open the case. </s>
<s> Between you and me, I did so just to make sure everything was still connected and it is. </s>
<s> When I turn on the hard drive, the fans go on but the light does not. </s>
<s> So I know it is not the usb port (which works with my other external hard drives) and the system recognizes my other 2 external hard drives. </s>
<s> Of course I can exchange this drive since I just got it, but I want the information that I put on it. </s>
<s> Any other ideas? </s>
<s> p/s = power supply i/f = interface, what the cabling goes to Warranty, then use it. </s>
<s> As for data, if it doesn't work on another system, I thought there's anything you could do. </s>
<s> Of course try whatever suggestions they offer at the makers support website. </s>
<s> I only made the remove the HD suggestion, &quot;push comes to shove&quot;, if you're not capable then leave it alone. </s>
<s> Just because the fan comes on doesn't mean there's enough &quot;power&quot; to spin-up the HD, it takes alittle more. </s>
<s> USB devices have a limited amount of power to drive devices if powered directly by the USB port and if alot of devices are connected to USB, it will get flaky. </s>
<s> You mentioned, 2 other ext. </s>
<s> HDs are they connected also at the same time or using 1 USB port? </s>
<s> That's important, if all are hooked-up, no wonder you finally got a bad HD. </s>
<s> -OR- you found a weak HD, use the warranty. </s>
<s> sorry.... tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I'll tell you why. </s>
<s> First of all, I tried unplugging my other usb hard drive (one of them was firewire). </s>
<s> Then after I unplugged it from the usb port, I turned it on (the known working drive). </s>
<s> The light and the fan BOTH went right on. </s>
<s> Even while the drive was disconnected completely from my computer. </s>
<s> That light should go on with the power switch, just plugged into the AC adapter. </s>
<s> The drive that is problematic doesn't turn on the light no matter where I plug it in. </s>
<s> The guy I got it from online must be out of town because he is usually very very good about responding to my emails, and my other 2 drives are from him. </s>
<s> Once he responds, hopefully he can help; I am not worried so much about getting the drive replaced, but was hoping to be able to get the info off this drive without having to wait for him. </s>
<s> Thanks for trying to help. </s>

<s> Hi, Willy, and all other interested parties. </s>
<s> I put my hard drive into a new external encasement, and it was recognized in My Computer right away with all the data intact. </s>
<s> So there was something about the case connections that failed. </s>
<s> Simple, no? </s>
