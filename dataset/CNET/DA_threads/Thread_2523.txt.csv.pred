1.1.7	Device Manager and BIOS boot recognize my ST drive.	St
1.1.8	My Computer doesn't show the E: drive.	St
1.1.9	But I haven't figured out how to write a MBR or anything else to the drive.	St
1.1.10	I tried using SeaTools.	St
1.1.11	But the program stops when it tells you that it doesn't work in Windows, but DOS only.	St
1.1.12	I have to turn off the computer and reboot to do anything.	St
1.1.13	So, what do I need to do to be able to use my ST drive?	St
1.2.1	Boot to the SeaTools disk to test for damage on the 40GB Seagate drive.	St
1.2.2	In the meantime, I'd use the Dell Windows XP Restoration disc to install Windows on the 120GB HD.	St

1.2.4	Make sure you install all drivers after installing Windows (download the latest versions from Dell.com).	Res
1.3.1	It's entirely proper for it to not show up in explorer until you partition and format it with your OS.	St

1.3.3	Bob	St
1.4.1	Thank you for the suggestions.	St
1.4.2	I hoped I followed the advice correctly.	Polite

1.4.11	My XP files are on my primary drive.	St
1.5.1	I usually look to my backup disks.	St
1.5.2	For me that's all of 4 DVDRW disks.	St
1.5.3	That cost was all of 4 bucks and worth every penny.	St
1.5.4	I don't backup the OS or programs but reload those from CD or net.	St
