my configuration: psu: 400w cpu: intel celeron 1.7ghz (256kb cache) mb: asus p4p800-x ram: 256mb kingston 333mhz pc2700 ddr hdds: maxtor 40gb + 80gb 2.700rpm vga: asus nvidia n6600 256mb vram in the last two years i've got a really hard time playing videogames, even if i changed the video card one year ago.
currently, i'm short of cash, so i can't change my pc, but if i start saving now, for jan/feb probably i'll have the money to buy a new pc.
but since i'm an impatient person, i'm considering upgrading as an alternative to replacing.
i'll like to know your opinion about this: will replacing my celeron with a p4 3/3.2ghz ht and putting two ddr 400mhz modules (in dual channel configuration) allow me to play decently for the next couple of years?
how much memory do you think i'll need?
(i plan to buy used stuff in case of an upgrade) i'm not interested in playing at the maximum detail level, i simply want a stable frame rate.
looking forward to your opinions, thx!
