I have a six-year-old computer with a reset button on the tower.
This button is convenient because when a screen freezes up it is easier to press the reset button than to press ctrl.
alt.
and delete.
I need to buy a new computer but the stores that I visited only sell computers that do not have reset buttons.
If I buy a computer without a reset button how would I fix a frozen screen?
Thank you very much.
