i used another cd-r disk that had the files i wanted to transfer over.
that disk worked.
god the job done.
the strange thing was.
the first one i tried and pictures and other files on it.
the only thing that come up for loading was the pictures.
no folders!
that is what was driving me crazy.
i like to get answers!!!
but thanks!!
