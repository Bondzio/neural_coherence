<s> I have Canon PIXMA ip5000 printer attached via USB to Dell Dimension 4700 under XP Pro SP2 with all current updates. </s>
<s> Using Canon Print Preferences window I can set all options except for Print Preview. </s>
<s> This worked fine until February when it stopped working. </s>
<s> I can preview in all applications (Office 2003 Pro, JASC Paint Shop Pro 9, and in the Preview option of Canon Easy-Web print). </s>
<s> I have uninstalled and reinstalled the latest Canon Driver, uninstalled and re-installed Office 2003 but these actions have no effect. </s>
<s> Whenever I select the print option from whatever application, I get immediate printing without tha Canon Print Preview screen. </s>
<s> Can anyone suggest other options to try? </s>

<s> I have the same problem with Canon Print Preview Preferences. </s>
