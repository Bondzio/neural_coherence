your router works, because the ipod connects to it.
so it's something on your laptop.
the most likely thing to me is a hardware issue.
replacing the wireless card in the laptop would probably solve that.
the dv6000 series has a rather bad reputation.
it could well be that you have to replace the whole motherboard.
but there's a small chance it's a software issue also.
the means to research that aren't pleasant either: 1. boot from a linux live cd and see if that connects wirelessly.
2. back to factory settings using hp's system recovery options.
i'd start with contacting hp customer support and see if they can talk you through their standard diagnostics.
if it's a hardware issue indeed, still having warranty might make a big difference in total costs to solve this.
