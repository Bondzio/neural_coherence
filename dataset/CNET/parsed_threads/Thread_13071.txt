<s> Hey all, For a while I was using a Logitech RX300 mouse for all my needs. </s>
<s> A rather simple piece of hardware but it had no bells and whistles attached, no fancy indentations or 20 programmable buttons. </s>
<s> Eventually this mouse died on me, so I took this time to find an old favorite - a Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer 3.0. </s>
<s> Didn't find it, but I got a &quot;Wheel Mouse Optical&quot; instead, which is essentially the same minus the side buttons. </s>
<s> As much as I loved mice from this family in the past, I forgot about their setting of 400 DPI. </s>
<s> My Logitech mouse used 800, and I had all my applications' sensitivities set to accomodate that. </s>
<s> When I used the Logitech mouse I kept my mouse sensitivity in the control panel (I did not install their drivers nor settings program) at the default, the sixth notch on the slider. </s>
<s> This mouse is slower, but bringing it to the seventh is too much. </s>
<s> I checked out the Intellipoint program which came with the mouse, but apparently this model is so old that I can't do anything beyond reprogramming the buttons, whilst newer models apparently have more features in the program such as DPI changing. </s>
<s> Any suggestions on how to bring this mouse up to 800 or compensate? </s>
<s> Can I edit a hex string or something to attain a more specific mouse sensitivity setting in Windows than the control panel allows? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Sorry if this thread is a tad long-winded, but I'm a perfectionist when it comes to my hardware's responsiveness. </s>
<s> :P </s>
<s> The mouse I use daily for hours is the Logitech v450 nano. </s>
<s> I never installed it's drivers or software and have no complaints. </s>
<s> I also have the Logitech LX8 and it seems nice enough. </s>
<s> Same story. </s>
<s> Never took the CD out of the box. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'm not really aiming for a mouse suggestion, though. </s>
<s> I'm curious as to if there's a way to get more precise settings out of the Control Panel's mouse options, like via hex editing or a registry entry. </s>
<s> Use the MSDN (Microsoft) site and search for the published registry entries. </s>
