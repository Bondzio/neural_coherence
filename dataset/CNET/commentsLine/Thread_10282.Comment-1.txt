hello, so basically i put together a computer and it just refuses to post.
i've cleared the cmos via pin, taken out the battery.
the bios speaker makes a small faint clicking noise about every .800 ms (almost 1sec) i'm using an amd athlon ii x3 3.3 ghz psu is fine, i've tested it in another pc.. works fine (550 wat psu) graphics card is fine (gtx 460) i've tested it in another pc.
cpu is fine, tested it in another pc... i tried my memory from another pc to this one, the memory has lights and the lights always flash when i boot my pc but they stayed solid with pc that didn't post.
it still clicks with the cpu out or in same with memory i've reseated the cpu 3-4 times no bent pins, looks fine and the cpu even gets hot when it's in.. i also checked the connectors on the heatsink/fan to the mobo.. fine too.
i've unplugged all devices like keyboard/mouse, etc but still clicks.
i fear the worst, the motherboard?
here's the mobo:
