What I experience too often is the software or installer fails and the enduser is left to slug it out.
I know to dig around the CD contents and try methods such as Device Manager add/remove hardware to see if I can overcome that failure.
In closing, some are blissfully unaware that Microsoft doesn't update your BIOS, set the BIOS proper (defaults work for most) or fetch and install motherboard (and other) drivers.
The area of installing the OS used to be a rite of passage before 2000, but now we read post after post about this issue.
I'll read your next post now.
