<s> I have a PowerMac 8600 running OS 9.1 with a sonnet 450/G4 card and an IDE card installed with a CD burner. </s>
<s> I recently added an internal NEC ND-3520A DVD burner. </s>
<s> When I installed it I connected the power cable and the ribbon cable but I didn't have anything to insert into the audio cable connection on the back of either the CD burner or the DVD burner, as that is connected to the original Apple CD player. </s>
<s> These drives are recognized on the Apple System Profiler but when I try to play a CD in either the CD burner or the DVD burner I don't get any sound from the speakers. </s>
<s> My questions are: 1. </s>
<s> How can I get audio to play from the CD burner and the DVD burner to the computer speakers? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Is there a three in one Y cord I could connect to the Apple audio cord and then plug into each of the three CD or DVD drives to get sound from each drive to the speakers? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Or can I only hear the audio from one drive on the computer speakers? </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Even though I can't hear the audio on the speakers, I've been told that if I rip audio from one of the CD drives to burn to either the CD or DVD burner it will record the audio files okay. </s>
<s> Is this correct? </s>
<s> Thank you for your help and assistance. </s>
<s> Nice to see such a venerable machine still going strong. </s>
<s> The answers to your questions are: 1. </s>
<s> See Answer 2 2. </s>
<s> Yes, I have seen such a thing, but not lately 3. </s>
<s> Without installing the subject of answer 2, Yes. </s>
<s> Only sound from that CD 4. </s>
<s> Yes, it will record the audio files. </s>
<s> If you have an old version of iTunes, you should be able to hear the audio as the CD tracks are imported. </s>
<s> I have two external CD devices and neither of them have an audio cable attached. </s>
<s> (Both firewire but I don't recall connecting anything inside the enclosure for audio) They both play CD's well Hope this helps P </s>
