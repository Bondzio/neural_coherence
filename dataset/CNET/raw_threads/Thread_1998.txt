Not all the cards I can get, will be in your market at the price you might expect it to be. Example, a 99U$D card may be double the exchange rate in you local market. Next look to the VGACHARTS at http://www.tomshardware.com to see how your list fared. Bob

A very nice card. Compare with http://www6.tomshardware.com/mobile/20040203/ to see if benchmarks help you decide. Both cards should be fine for most games. Bob
