If your friend is willing and has a pc have him install the drive in an extra slot of the PC[for stability reasons] connect the middle connector to main drive and first connector to your drive.
Do not have slave or master selected on your drive.
Leave empty.Connect Power: When you start your friends pc the drive should be showing itself.
From there you can grab what you want off of it.
There are many self help quides on the net to explain this in detail or diagrams if you want.
IF you do not see it and have trouble's there is a program from http://www.grc.com/intro.htm called Spin Rite by Steve GIbson that recovers Hard drives.
Just for your info.
May come in handy and is not expensive.
