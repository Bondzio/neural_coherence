hey everyone.
i've run into a bit of a problem.
couple weeks back, my computer's ram started having issues.
ran memtest on it; one of the modules was broke, not sure which, and corsair wanted both modules back for an rma so it didn't really matter.
anyway, got my replacements today; the exact same module i was using before, only new and not broken, installed them, but now i've got a 'cannot find signal' on my monitor.
any ideas what happened?
i should also note that it worked fine for nearly nine months before the ram went bad and now i'm here.
