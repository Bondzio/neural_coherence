<s> Hi all, I have an old Cel. </s>
<s> 333 pc, LX motherboard with 96MB SDRAM,OS : Win98, The mother board did not have any USB ports but there were pins on the board, next to which USB was written, I tried connecting a standard cable with 2 ports to this but no results( I tried checking with a multimeter for any voltage across the pins but could not detect any, was this method correct ?) </s>
<s> I even tried installing a PCI card with USB outlets, EVEN this did not work, I&quot;am at my wits's end on what 2 do Any help would be most welcome. </s>
<s> http://www.usbman.com and see if there are any BIOS updates to your board and if there is any USB enable in your BIOS screens. </s>
<s> LX boards were not widely tested on USB. </s>
