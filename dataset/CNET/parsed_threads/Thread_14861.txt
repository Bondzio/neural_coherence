<s> alright i have a belkin router with 1 labtop ethernet wired, 1 host computer wired, and 1 desktop computer going wireless. </s>
<s> On the computer going wireless everytime i seem to play Counterstrike (for those who know what i'm talking about) i would walk walk walk, then just randomly lag and get this HUGE lag spike for about 3 seconds, then its fine. </s>
<s> Occurs occasionally no idea why... then after maybe about 1 hr - 2 hrs... the wireless connection goes down. </s>
<s> So then i just right click my wireless connection icon and press repair.. ALL SET... an hour later connection goes back down... its starting to annoy me.. plz help </s>
<s> the only thing i can think of right now is that your machine may be set to switch off your wireless connection to save power. </s>
<s> right click 'my computer' and select 'properties' go to the 'hardware' tab and then click on 'device manager' locate 'network adaptors' and click the little [+] next to it, double click on your wireless adaptor and then go to one of the end tabs, possibly called 'power' (cant really remember right now cos i'm not using a windows pc) clear any check marks that say something like &quot;allow the computer to turn this device off to save power&quot; this may or may not cure your problem. </s>
<s> like i say it's all i can think of right now. </s>
<s> as for your LAG, are you within range of you wireless router, and have a good signal. </s>
<s> could anything be interferring with the signal. </s>
<s> i would expect a slight delay (fractions of a second) due to the lower bandwidth of a wirelss conection, but nothing that big. </s>
<s> it's rediculous! </s>
<s> good luck, hope this helps </s>
