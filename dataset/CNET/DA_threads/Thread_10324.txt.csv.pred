1.1.1	Hi guys, I'm looking into buying a new Wireless-N Router.	St
1.1.2	Linksys or Netgear?	St
1.1.3	Anyone experience either one of these makers?	St
1.1.4	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	Netgear is what I have It has WPA security.	St
1.2.2	That's what you need for your router to be secure.	St
1.2.3	I'm sure the other one has WPA security.	St
1.2.4	Just remember to update the firmware for your router, since most come shipped with outdated firmware.	St
1.2.5	Rick	St
1.3.1	Some of the firewall options are better in the Linksys.	St
1.3.2	Example?	St
1.3.3	Block an IP range.	St
1.3.4	Bob	St
1.4.1	I just switched from a Linksys wireless G router to a DLink Extreme wireless N router - DIR 655.	St
1.4.2	The difference is night and day.	St
1.4.3	Now the kids play their online games and the internet works perfectly.	St
1.4.4	No one complains of slow load times.	St
1.4.5	I had to many issues with the Linksys.	St
1.4.6	Set up with the DLink was a breeze.	St
1.4.7	Consider this one another option.	St
