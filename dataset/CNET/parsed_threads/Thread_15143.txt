<s> Hi - I use my PC for everything from music creation (no great graphics requirement) to playing games (obviously, this is where things get more demanding). </s>
<s> I recently fitted an Nvidea GS7800 card which offers a maximum screen display of 1600 x 1200 (I currently have my 19&quot; CRT monitor set to 1280 x 960, which suits my purposes. </s>
<s> Games seem to offer a choice of resolution settings, but invariably have their own native setting which imposes itself, which is fine with my CRT. </s>
<s> However, I fancy replacing my 19&quot; CRT with a - you guessed it! </s>
<s> - larger LCD monitor.... From googling around, I see that there are 21 and 22-inch LCD monitors which seem very attractive, but depending on their format (i.e. </s>
<s> how widescreen they are) they max out at either 1600 x 1200 (perfect for my needs?) </s>
<s> or 1680 x 1050 ( a more widescreen format?). </s>
<s> Am I confined to monitors with 1600 x 1200 or can I still consider 1680 x 1050 with my current graphics card? </s>
<s> Also, is it likely that my games will find their own resolution whatever the monitor size? </s>
<s> I am not too clear about how LCD technology works under these conditions and would appreciate any advice. </s>
<s> Incidentally, how important is a really fast response time of, say 2ms, when it comes to gaming? </s>
<s> Will 5ms not do just as well? </s>
<s> I understand that measuring systems vary a lot, even within one make of monitor. </s>
<s> A number of points here, I know, but if they could be addressed individually or together that would be much appreciated (in fact if anyone can recommend a monitor that would work with my card then great!) </s>
<s> I took the simple MATH approach but it appears the makers lie about the numbers. </s>
<s> See what you think at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-10152_102-0.html?forumID=97&threadID=266305&messageID=2596675#2596675 Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for that. </s>
<s> It seems likely that quoted figured of 2ms are misleading... </s>
<s> Anyone got anything on screen resolution? </s>
<s> Any monitor recommendations? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I would be interested in hearing more discussion on the issues of LCD monitor screen size/resolution, as in my original post. </s>
<s> I have always found that resolution plays a part, however, refresh rates are just as important. </s>
<s> I have a Viewsonic 22&quot; widescreen multimedia LCD with a 7600GS graphics card and the games look and run very good with that combination. </s>
<s> As far as response time I could not see any difference with the 5ms response on the Viewsonic and the 2ms on the Samsung that I used for 2 weeks while the Viewsonic was being delevered. </s>
<s> I set the resolution at 1680 X 1050 and it looks great in very day use and also games. </s>
<s> The only thing I will be doing to improve gaming is installing a bigger power supply and a better, newer graphics card as that seems to be the key with the newer direct 10X games </s>
<s> Thanks for that useful advice! </s>
