i wanted to upgrade my winxp home-built system with a new mobo and cpu.
but when it tries to start, it almost gets to the winxp screen and then it restarts.
it keeps doing this over and over until i shut it down.
someone told me that you can't use the same hard drive that was used in a winxp system.
but all of the hardware except mobo and cpu are the same.
(sometimes i almost miss win98)i have all of my software and documents there and i hate to wipe it and start over from scratch.
can i set it as a slave in my upgraded system, or will this not work either?
the new mobo and cpu are just sitting in the box.
i had them checked out at a computer shop to make sure they were ok and they checked out fine.
i appreciate any help.
