1.1.1	Hello every1 , my system config- processor - intel E6300 Motherboard - intel DG965RY Hard Disk - 200GB SATA RAM - Transcend 1GB DDR2 ( 533 ) I want to upgrade my RAM .	St
1.1.2	Want to buy ( 2GB each for four slots ) DDR2 ( 800 ) as it is very cheap now .	St
1.1.3	but i am confused whether the RAM available in market will be accepted by my motherboard , The instructions in the motherboards manual clearly mentions that only DDR2 ( 800 ) with 5-5-5 or 6-6-6 timing will work properply .	St
1.1.4	It also mentions that there are many RAM 's available in market with same timings but their actual timing is not the same , this would degrade the system performance or may not boot .	St
1.1.5	So please help me out on which RAM to buy ?	Ques
1.1.6	Will TRANSCEND DDR2 ( 800 ) solve this problem , as it is easily available near my place ... ?	Ques
1.2.1	if you do n't have a 64bit OS , you can only use 4GB of ram .	St
1.2.2	also , some motherboards have problems running memory at full speed when all 4 slots are filled .	St
1.2.3	and intel motherboards are very finicky about voltage .	St
1.2.4	so , if you want 4gb i recommend you get a 2x2gb ddr2-800 cl5 1.8v kit like this : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16820134582 for 8gb , stick with 4x2gb ddr2-667 ( pc2 5300 ) cl5 1.8v .	St
1.3.1	http : //www.intel.com/design/motherbd/ry/ry_available.htm In the & quot ; Memory - Maximum Supported & quot ; row it shows 4GB @ 800Mhz ... what does this mean ? ?	Ques
1.3.2	does it mean that if insert 8GB it will only show 4GB installed ? ?	Ques
1.3.3	?	Ques
1.4.1	But I should n't spend the money , if I were you .	St
1.4.2	Possibilities : 1 .	St
1.4.3	It wo n't boot at all .	St
1.4.4	2 .	St
1.4.5	It will boot but only show ( and use ) 3.2 Gb or so , as all 32 bits OS'es do .	St
1.4.6	Kees	St
1.5.1	huh ... i regret buying a intel mobo ...	Polite
1.6.1	I just found out from the intel website that a 2GB stick of DDR2 ( 800 mHz ) is not compatible with my mobo ( upto ... 1GB 800 ) Now i jst plan to add 533Mhz RAM sticks with the existing 1GB ( 533 ) .. ( total of 3 or 4 GB memory ) .	St
1.6.2	Is there a lot of difference in performance between 533 and 800 MHz RAM 's ? ? ?	Ques
1.6.3	Pls suggest me on this. , I just want to make the right move and make the best use of my mobo .	Sug
1.6.4	Thankyou !	St
1.7.1	Re RAM it says 4 GB at 800 MHz , 8GB at 667/533 MHz System resources and hardware ( such as PCI and PCI Express* ) require physical memory address locations that can reduce available addressable system memory .	St
1.7.2	This could result in a reduction of as much as 1GB or more of physical addressable memory being available to the operating system and applications , depending on the system configuration and operating system VAPCMD	St
1.8.1	http : //download.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/dg965ry/sb/d5601101us.pdf Page 16 shows the supported memory configurations ... it does not mention 2GB @ 800MHZ	St
1.9.1	from the link you cited and says same as you indicate .	St
1.9.2	Spec indicates you can go 8GB RAM at 667/533MHz or 4GB RAM with 800 MHz ... assuming you find RAM compatible with that MB in that quantity .	St
1.9.3	Some MB state they will run with 4 DIMMs but sometimes do not .	St
1.9.4	Check your OS limitations before deciding how much RAM to install .	St
1.9.5	VAPCMD	St
1.10.1	I got Windows XP professional SP2 ... .	St
1.10.2	Okay i will not go with 8GB.. Shall go max upto 4GB.. which MHz to get ? ? ?	Ques
1.10.3	i already hav 533MHz 1GB.. what to do ? ? ?	Ques
1.10.4	thankyou..	St
1.11.1	Try Corsair .	St
1.11.2	They will have dominators for your needs .	St
1.11.3	That said , Thats a lot of ram .	St
1.11.4	Unless your machine has specific need for this much ram .	St
1.11.5	In a bunch of tests I`ve read , some pcs had a small increase in performance with 6gb ram .	St
1.11.6	At 8gb there was no increase .	St
1.11.7	The biggest concern here is the power consumption from 8gb of ram Think about it .	St
1.12.1	http : //support.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/dg965ry/sb/CS-026602.htm Once you 've studied carefully ... then come back and ask any remaining questions .	St
1.12.2	VAPCMD NOTE the caveat regarding voltage 1.8V ... ignoring it would be unwise .	St
1.12.3	And pretend for the moment you 're buying all new RAM so there 's no issue re mixing the old RAM and the new RAM .	St
1.13.1	Recession goin on ... definitely got ta think abt it.. okay , No confusions -- I want atleast 3GB and max 4GB ... Should i go for 533MHz or 800MHz ( 5-5-5 timing ) ? ? ?	Ques
1.13.2	this is what i want to know ...	St
1.13.3	The thing is if i get 533MHz i can use it with my current 1GB stick , but if you guys recommend me to get 667 or 800Mhz for better performance then i will go for it ... And ya i will have to get 'TRANSCEND ' only , as Corsair and even Kingston is not available near my place ...	St
1.14.1	OS will use just a little more than 3GB .	St
1.14.2	VAPCMD PS ... Corsair is n't on Intel 's recommend RAM for this motherboard .	St
1.15.1	This is what i have decided..	St
1.15.2	I am not going to get 800Mhz RAM ...	St
1.15.3	So left with either 533 or 667MHz RAM ... Is there a lot of 'performance difference ' between 533 and 667MHz ? ? ?	Ques
1.15.4	?	Ques
1.16.1	mind ... .. many machines are optimized for RAM in matching pairs ... .same mfg , same speed , same timings and capacity , and some machines do not run well on 4 DIMMs .	St
1.16.2	If it were my PC ... you could get 1 DIMM to match the 1 you have , or 2-2GB DIMMs ( usually a kit ) and not use the existing 1GB DIMM or perhaps 2-2GB kits ... with 4 1 GB DIMMs .	St
1.16.3	If you really want 4GBs RAM ... then a 4GB kit consisting of matching 2-2GB DIMMs total 4GB .	St
1.16.4	That would be the optimum combo and in addition would allow you to use the 800MHz RAM vs the 667MHz or 533MHz RAM .	St
1.16.5	Who wants to go slower ?	Ques
1.16.6	Just make sure you follow the MB mfg specs with regard to the RAM voltage ( 1.8V if I recall correctly ) .	Sug
1.16.7	Do a little shopping and see what you come up with ... try Crucial.com and Newegg.com too .	St
1.16.8	Once you 've narrowed it down ... post here for final comment .	St
1.16.9	VAPCMD PS ... You can always sell the 533MHz 1GB DIMM or give it to a friend so it 's not like you 're thowing it away if you do n't use hereafter .	St
1.17.1	I tried to find this information everywher , but just couldnt find it ... Could you please tell me whether my DG965RY mobo will support a 'single ' 2GB RAM stick of & quot ; 800MHz & quot ; ddr2 ( yeah 5-5-5 or 6-6-6 timing ) ...	St
1.17.2	If yes , then no second thoughts , i will be buying it ...	Res
1.18.1	of DDR2-533 RAM as then you 'll end up with 3GBs RAM running at 533MHz and NOT DUAL CHANNEL .	St
1.18.2	That 's a very very poor choice ... any way you look at it .	Polite
1.18.3	For about $ 50 ... you can have 4GB RAM ( 2 DIMMs @ 2GB each ) running dual channel at 800MHz .	St
1.18.4	That said ... here 's my best and final recommendation http : //www.crucial.com/store/mpartspecs.aspx ? mtbpoid=545035EDA5CA7304 ... 4GB in 2 DIMMs for $ 45.99 * Chipset : Intel G965 * Supported DRAM Types : DDR2 SDRAM only * Module Types Supported : Unbuffered only * Error Detection Support : Non-ECC only * Graphics Support : PCI Express x16 * Max Component Density : 1024 * USB Support : 2.x Compliant * 240-pin DDR2 DIMM Banking : 4 ( 2 banks of 2 ) * DDR2 SDRAM Frequencies : PC2-4200 , PC2-5300 , and PC2-6400 * Max Unbuffered DDR2 SDRAM : 8192MB * Maximum memory using PC2-4200 or PC2-5300 is 8192MB .	St
1.18.5	Maximum memory using PC2-6400 is 4096MB.Although the memory can be installed one module at a time , the best performance comes from using matched pairs of modules .	St
1.18.6	Q : Will my system recognize the maximum upgrade ?	Ques
1.18.7	A : Possibly How much memory your Windows OS will recognize depends on which version of Windows you are running .	St
1.18.8	32-bit versions of Windows will see ( and utilize ) only 3GB or 3.5GB .	St
1.18.9	To utilize more memory , install a 64-bit version of your OS .	St
1.18.10	More information about OS memory maximums can be found at http : //www.crucial.com/kb/answer.aspx ? qid=4251 .	St
1.18.11	Q : What memory goes into my computer , and will a faster speed be backward-compatible ?	Ques
1.18.12	A : DDR2 memory with support for DDR2 PC2-6400 , DDR2 PC2-8500 , DDR2 PC2-5300 speeds .	St
1.18.13	Q : How much memory can my computer handle ?	Ques
1.18.14	A : 8192MB .	St
1.18.15	Adding the maximum amount of memory will improve performance and help extend the useful life of your system as you run increasingly demanding software applications in the future .	St
1.18.16	Q : Do I have to install matching pairs ?	Ques
1.18.17	A : Yes .	St
1.18.18	Your system requires that you install memory in pairs .	St
1.18.19	Q : Does my computer support dual-channel memory ?	Ques
1.18.20	A : Yes .	St
1.18.21	To benefit from the performance advantages offered by dual-channel systems , you should install memory in identical pairs .	St
1.18.22	Installing a kitted pair is the best way to ensure that your modules are identical , right down to the chip count .	St
1.18.23	Q : Does my computer support ECC memory ?	Ques
1.18.24	A : No .	St
1.18.25	Your system does not support ECC .	St
1.18.26	Because ECC and non-ECC modules should not be mixed within a system , install the same type of modules that are already in your system .	St
