1.1.1	I currently have one PC connected to a cable modem for my DSL service.	St
1.1.2	I just bought another PC and want to use the same (one) cable provider.	St
1.1.3	When I called them, they said I woudl need to pay them the full fee for the second cable modem... My question, why can't I just purchase a cable modem and hook it up to the coaxial wall outlet in the room I want to use the PC?	St
1.1.4	Do I have to really tell my cable company?	St
1.1.5	Thanks, Novice-Luis	St
1.2.1	but the solution is a 4 port wired/wireless router.	St
1.2.2	No need to pay for a second IP address, and plugging another cable modem into the wall jack will not work unless you pay for another account.	St
1.2.3	The routers the cheaper solution.	St
