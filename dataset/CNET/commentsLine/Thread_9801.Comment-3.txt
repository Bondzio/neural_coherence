i'm just offering up one of my old computers as a loaner to shorten the time i'm without a work pc.
i work for a non-profit and it could be over a month before i see parts to repair the old computer at work.
we have several unused legal windows xp pro liscences (microsoft is very generous to non-profits.)
-- this is not the issue.
(although it is my understanding the xp pro is supposed to allow you to make 4 major hardware changes before it asks you to re-activate.)
i've done this before -- i'm just concerned about data loss.
i'm starting to think it may be better to piggy-back this drive on the drive that was orginally in the amd computer.
(which i really don't want to do...) and i agree, taking a company harddrive for home use would go over like a lead ballon -- but that's not what i'm doing here.
thanks for the input.
