hi, i want to upgrade memory in a gateway 827gm.
it has one 512 mb pc3200 ddr-sdram stick in it.
i want to add one more stick to it.
on newegg there is a wide variety of memory.
is there much of a difference in memory and is there a certain manufacturer that i should be looking for?
thanks............ tom
