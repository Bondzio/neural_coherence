before you go to costco and buy any national brand computer check out the small local computer stores in your area.
if they are anything like my small local computer store, and i'm sure they are, you will get a better computer and probably one with a discreet video card (even a lower end video card is better that onboard in most cases) and a better deal and let me stress this point, local tech support!
just think, you have a problem or a question, you call a local number and you don't get someone in a call center half way around the world giving you cookie cutter answers.
but anyway, get one with a discreet video card, it's always better.
