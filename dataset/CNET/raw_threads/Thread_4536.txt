I will be playing games like Battlefield 2, F.E.A.R, Rainbow 6 Las Vegas, and other awesome games like that. I cannot spend more than $1000 on this. All i want to know is what are the best things to get so I can get good memory, a good video card and all that junk. Please help. Thanks a lot. I'm really only a casual gamer. I will play Rainbow 6 and Battlefield mostly. I probably won't even have any other games on my computer. What I am looking for is basically an awesome pc that can handle those games easily so i don't get mad that it lags all the time. But along with that, I don't need, and won't spend money on, the $4000 - $5000 pc's. How about the Gateway FX530XM with: -Intel Core 2 Duo Processor E6600 (2.40GHz, 1066MHz FSB, 4MB cache, non-HT) -2048MB 667MHz Dual-Channel DDR2 SDRAM (2-1024MB modules) -Intel 975X Chipset with DDR2 and Intel Core Duo support -500GB 7200rpm Serial ATA II/ 300 hard drive w/ 8MB cache & Raid 0 (2-250GB hard drives) and either one of these(I can't decide on which one I actually need): -NVIDIA GeForce 7600GT 256MB DDR2 Video Card Dual DVI/ TV -NVIDIA GeForce 8800GTS w/ 320MB, Dual DVI-I Dual link TV Out (Factory Overclocked) w/ VGA adapter

So it would actually be a good price.

6528	6	252763	2520107	2519677	ramarc	6/21/07 8:25 AM	1.1824143E12	buy the card you want from newegg.com or zipzoomfly.com	gateway offers a limited number of graphics upgrades but any of the cards i mentioned will work in the pc. gateway's price on the 8800gts is reasonable especially since they will pre-install it for you. the x1900 crossfire won't match the all-around performance of the 8800gts. as i said before, if you don't have the budget for the 8800gts, get what you can afford from the earlier list.
