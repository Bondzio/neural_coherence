<s> I jsut installed the Belkin PRE-N Network Desktop Card on one of three PC's in my home. </s>
<s> The main issie I'm having with the card is something in the device manager saying &quot;out of system resources (code 12)&quot;. </s>
<s> I looked into this and couldn't find anything that might have conflicted with the Belkin card. </s>
<s> I looked in the the &quot;resources by type&quot; in the device manager and opened up the IRQ settngs and couldn't find any devies conflicting or having a problem running except for the Belkin card. </s>
<s> Has anyone run into a problem like this at all? </s>

<s> Forgot to include this in the original message Windows XP Pro Belkin PRE-N Network Desktop Card (8000 series) </s>
<s> Some machines (which you didn't describe yours) require a motherboard driver package, a BIOS update or other to avoid this message. </s>
<s> I can't help you with your issue. </s>

<s> The machine is an HP desktop (not sure model number because it diesn't belong to me) w/ a Pent 4 processor. </s>
<s> I did notice there is a built in Ethernet connection on the mother board that may be causing the conflict. </s>
<s> Are you suggesting that I turn off/disable something in the BIOS? </s>
<s> I'll figure this one out and let you know what I find. </s>
<s> My problem is with an older system that I pieced together. </s>
<s> We just happen to find we want it wireless. </s>
<s> But I bought the Pre-N router and the card so why not(both for a total of $120). </s>
<s> Just can't seem to narrow down what the conflict is yet. </s>
<s> Have you tried to disable the internal NIC ethernet port? </s>
<s> Naturally, you wont be using it if you are going wireless. </s>
<s> That should free up some resources. </s>
<s> Also, just more food for though....try also uninstalling the Pre-N card and reboot and install the drivers/software again. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
