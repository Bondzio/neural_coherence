1.5.1	Hi As far as monitors go you can do what you like it is up to you on how you choose to do it it is far easier to use windows display settings to setup your monitors than nvidia control panel one screen can be the correct orientation while the other the reverse plus you can set different resolutions for each i know for fact that you can attach 4 monitors all replicating the same desktop using intel mb graphics and nvidia graphics card to which nvidia have stated is not possible at all Yours robjlee64	St
1.6.1	This update is in relation to any tv monitor hdmi dvi vga dsub that you can connect to a pc now depending on what ops sys you are using they should work in the same way and to function correctly you may also have to update your monitor driver and the firmware update for your tv which may require you to use some kind of usb memory stick the same applys to blu ray and dvd players but do not confuse this with dvd rom player devices as windows does this for you automatically i hope this helps Yours robjlee64	St
