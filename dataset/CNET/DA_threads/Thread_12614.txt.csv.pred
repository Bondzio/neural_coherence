1.1.1	I'm looking to buy a new desktop computer and I'm on a budget.	St
1.1.2	I am not up on the latest processor technology but would be interested to know what is the best bang for the buck in processors.	St
1.1.3	I'm not into gaming or photo editing, just typical PC applications and web surfing.	St
1.1.4	I plan to go to Vista so I want to make sure I get a decent enough machine to handle it.	St
1.1.5	So is there a sweet spot($)in processors that I should look for in a desktop.	St
1.1.6	Thanks in advance	St
1.2.1	If purchasing a new desktop today, I'd start with an Intel Core 2 Duo CPU.	St
1.2.2	Entry level CPU is the E6300 (2MB L2 cache).	St
1.2.3	The E6600 fits my definition of a CPU sweetspot (4MB L2 cache).	St
1.2.4	It is the cheapest with 4MB cache, which translates into a nice performance bump.	St
1.2.5	Spending more money on the offered faster clock speeds doesn't give as much a performance bump.	St
1.2.6	Check the CPU CHARTS at TomsHardware.com for performance scores.	St
1.2.7	Now, tomorrow the sweetspot will be....	St
1.3.1	unless you're going to build the pc yourself, a specific cpu alone does not guarantee you'll get a pc suitable for you use.	St
1.3.2	still, since it seems you just want a good entry-level general-purpose pc, make sure it includes a dual-core processor (athlon x2, pentium d, or core 2 duo).	St
1.3.3	the price differential between them and a single-core processor is minimal.	St
1.3.4	also, avoid sempron or celeron cpus which are cut-back (some would say crippled) versions of other cpus.	St
1.3.5	the extra $100 (perhaps even less) for an entry-level dual-core is well worth the money.	St
1.4.1	See Tomshardware.com for CPU performance comparison.	St
1.4.2	VAPCMD	St
