Put it back in and see if it works, if not, put the old memory back in and see if that works, than try again. You shouldnt have to change any bios settings

If that, perchance, is PC 2100, that is DDR 266, much slower than the other memory and certainly can't be expected to run at the DDR 400 clock rate.
