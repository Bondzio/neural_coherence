I find that bridging did not let the host device (such as the 315) count up more devices.
However http://www.tp-link.com/en/products/details/?model=TD-W8950ND shows some DSL modem router so that's a second issue.
That is I have yet to meet anyone that has turned a DSL modem router into a router.
That's 2 big hurdles why this does not work.
And on top of that, the EC315 is USB and WiFi so again too many hurdles here.
Too many wrong parts.
