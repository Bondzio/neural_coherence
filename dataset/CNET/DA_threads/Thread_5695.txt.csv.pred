1.3.2	i would go with the ultra mobo http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16813130484 go with a different power supply , antec or ocz 480+ watts your mobo will come with the cables for your drive .	Sug
1.3.3	everything will fit , nice first time list enjoy ur build !	St
1.3.4	konny	St
1.4.1	My quick observation , do n't forget about an Operating System ... say $ 82+ for WinXP Home .	St
1.4.2	I would like a card reader like 8-in-1 or so..inexpensive .	St
1.4.3	Also a modem and NIC .	St
1.4.4	Plan on other small costs .	St
1.4.5	On the video card ... go with the Gigabyte you listed as the Fujiplus does n't list 'Core Clock ' or 'Memory Clock ' neither at their home site .	St
1.4.6	Note absence of 'reviews ' .	St
1.4.7	Processor OK , I would go with the Platinum Ultra on the mobo .	St
1.4.8	Case power supply may be a cheapo , but can change out later if not good enough .	St
1.5.1	I 'm not going for SLI in the future I wo n't play high-end games maybe some BF2 but I am fine with playing with low - med setting , I 'm not an *extreme* gamer .	St
1.5.2	With that should i go for the cheaper mobo ?	Ques
1.5.3	also I 'll get the gigabyte videocard .	St
1.5.4	Anyone post links for a seperate power supply , should i find a cheaper case then that doesnt include a power supply ?	Ques
1.5.5	As for an OS i have already one here and I do n't need one of those 8 in 1 readers since i can just hook up my camera via usb and shouldnt onboard NIC be good enough ?	Ques
1.5.6	I plan on using cable internet so i do n't to waste $ $ on a modem .	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	in the future for sli .	St
1.7.2	you might become a gamer , your playing bf2 = VERY graphics intensive game .	St
1.7.3	& quot ; I 'm not going for SLI in the future I wo n't play high-end games maybe some BF2 but I am fine with playing with low - med setting , I 'm not an *extreme* gamer .	St

1.7.8	I plan on using cable internet so i do n't to waste $ $ on a modem. & quot ; um , i would keep the mobo for future sli , as you might change your mind .	St
1.7.9	power supply , show around newegg for antec or ocz , get at least 480 watts .	St
1.7.10	onboard sound uses the cpu , aka adds more usage to it which lowers gaming performance .	St
1.7.11	for me , i do fine with integrated sound , but i do plan on getting a soundcard in the future when i have enough money .	St
1.7.12	i use a logitech headset as my speakers i think you will be happy with your build .	St
1.7.13	konny	St

1.8.4	Final question , will i need to buy a 20pin to 24pin converter mobo to psu ?	Ques
