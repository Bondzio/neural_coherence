XP can see the other computer but can't access any files. The 98 computer doesn't see any of the network. Both computers are routed thru DLink 624 and are able to access internet at the same time. Where can I find more info on configuring this system? I looked at several sites but they all pertained to using 2000 and 98 together. Any suggestions?

I had to enable file sharing on &quot;both&quot; computers. Then restart both machines. Worked fine. I was able to transfer and share folders between each. By the way, the Dlink (Di-624 router) worked fine out of the box. I called support about upgrading the firmware because one update on the VDI624(revC3) which I have, said DO NOT update firmware. Contact your ISP for an upgrade. There is another upgrade but Dlink support tech told me not to do any of them? Wonder why?
