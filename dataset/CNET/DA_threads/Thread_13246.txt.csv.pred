1.1.1	My PC currently has 1 GB memory ( 2-512GB chips ) with 2 slots for expansion .	St
1.1.2	I 've always read where an upgrade should use the same size chips , but is it written in stone where I have to use 2 more 512s as opposed to dropping in 1 or 2 1GB chips to use with the 512s in there now ?	Ques
1.1.3	Or do I take the current 512s out & drop in 2 , 3 or 4 1GB chips ?	Ques
1.2.1	I have seen many computers with different RAM sizes .	St
1.2.2	The things that are important are , to note where the & quot ; duel channel & quot ; slots are .	St
1.2.3	It is recommended that you use the same speed and size when filling these slots .	St
1.2.4	On the other hand , you do not have to match the RAM in the opposing channel .	St
1.2.5	So Channel 1 could be 2x512 and channel 2 1gx2 .	St
1.2.6	But , why take the chance of spotty operation .	St
1.2.7	At current RAM prices , you might as well match all the chips .	St
1.2.8	As with any RAM upgrade , make sure you check the manufacters compatible RAM list .	St
1.2.9	DDR2 is more strict when it comes to speed .	St
1.2.10	For guaranteed reliability , ( which is my motto ) spend the extra $ 20 .	St
1.2.11	-BR	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	Your details are lacking as what your system is .	St
1.4.2	You need to verify just what the specs are for your system ram needs and if it 's DDR2 capable .	St
1.4.3	Once known you can buy similar ram sticks you already have -OR- increase ram amt .	St
1.4.4	per stick to add to system present -OR- replace old ram with new larger ram amt .	St
1.4.5	sticks .	St
1.4.6	The DDR2 mode if used will better handle ram demands , however usually its demands proper ram slot placement .	St
1.4.7	Also , the OS being used will limit the ram amount and/or ideal ram installable ( search the forums here for topic ) .	St
1.4.8	Review the manual or visit the system/mtrbd .	St
1.4.9	support website .	Polite
1.4.10	Visiting crucial.com or kingston.com should help in ram buying and getting ram info .	Ques
1.5.1	different sizes on different channels only work if your chipset supports it .	St
1.5.2	for amd systems you will have to check if the cpu will support it .	St
1.5.3	otherwise it is definately a bad idea	St
1.6.1	not just same size but identical modules .	St
