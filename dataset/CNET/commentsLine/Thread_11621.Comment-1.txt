hi, i am considering buying the gateway zx 6810 all-in-one pc.
would someone be able to advise me if all-in-ones in general or this gateway in particular be susceptible to overheating.
i intend to use it in india, where outside temperatures can get pretty hot in summers (going upto 45 celcius).
in other words, is over-heating a serious problem with all-in-ones?
thanks,
