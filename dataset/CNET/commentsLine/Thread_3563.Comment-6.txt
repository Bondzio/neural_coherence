that system will run windows 7 perfectly.
i have win7 running on a desktop and laptop, with much lower spec's all round.
you mention triple booting with osx.
that might be a problem.
osx is a bit iffy when not installing on apple's chosen hardware so i'd do some research that your components are osx compatible.
other than that, you'll be fine
