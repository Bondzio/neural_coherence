i am running a dell dimension dim4600 with an intel pentium 4 cpu (2.66ghz), 512mb of ram, and windows xp home edition sp2.
i am looking into upgrading my ram, so the system will run a bit faster, and for gaming purposes, but i don't know what ram is compatible and what ram isn't.
i want to upgrade to either 2gb or 4gb of ram.
i was wondering if there is a website i can look at that will tell me what is compatible, and what isn't?
thanks, arcelios p.s.
: it would be very ideal if i could find something...less than expensive.
