i have a rather odd question.... would the fan on a video card (specifically the x700 pro) blow air onto the heatsink or blow air away from it.
i don't have the card yet so i can't look.
i was wondering, because i was planning to buy a pci fan to place directly underneath my video card so it would line up with the fan on the video card, and blow the air from the the card, out of the case to help with cooling, so i could overclock the card.
with that said.... the pci fans (go in a pci slot, and have a fan on the inside with a vent on the outside), do they blow air into, or out of the case?
my post is a bit hard to follow, so if you don't understand where i am coming from, i can try to explain more clearly.
