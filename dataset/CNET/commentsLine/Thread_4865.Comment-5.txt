sorry for missing info , i'm new to this whole forum approach , however , i've been building for a while now .
you know how it goes , new config and never encountered this before .
everything was running great .
all my fans volts and rpms great , nothing even close to too hot , no dust build up .
everything was running and performing fine .
i suspected the hdd from the start , just trying other things to keep from the hassle of sending back and the whole go-'round of it all .
