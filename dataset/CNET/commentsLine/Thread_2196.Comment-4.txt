i had an msi motherboard with an athlon 64 3000 cpu and it would hang on boot when it started the ide detection process.
turned out to be a failing/defective cd-dvd drive.
once i disconnected the defective cd-dvd...it booted and worked flawlessly.
ergo the reason it's so important to disconnect (not remove) periperhals when troubleshooting pcs that won't post or boot.
