1.1.1	Hi all I need help I have an hp media center pc its the one with all the connections in the front One group of connections is for analog connections for a VCR , DVD , or analog camcorder .	St
1.1.2	On hps site it says that if you want to convert old home movies or tape recordings to a digital format is what the front analog connections are for .	St
1.1.3	When I connect my analog camcorder to it nothing happens I figure I need some type of software to recognize the front port am I wrong ?	Ques
1.1.4	And if I do need some kind of software what do I need all the software I have looked at says it only reads from firewire or USB But not analog I know that I can buy a separate piece of hardware but that defeats the reason of why I bought the hp media center in the first place I wanted the built in analog ports .	St
1.1.5	I called hp but they dont know what to do ( strange ) Can someone plz help me	St
1.2.1	So let 's start with http : //www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/default.mspx Remember this system may let you record content but will not create a DVD from such .	Sug
1.2.2	For that you have to buy something that will handle the usual DVR-MS files that Media Center creates .	St
1.2.3	The trick is to get the camcorder showing on the Tv settings .	St
1.2.4	http : //www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/using/tv/recordtv.mspx and once there you can record it to the usual DVR-MS files .	St
1.2.5	For me this is far too much work so I move to other software fast .	St

1.3.1	Ok get this I called hp back and asked about the analog connections in the front of the media center and how to get it working .	St
1.3.2	I gave them all the serial numbers and model first the lady try to tell me that the connections arent real .	St
1.3.3	I told her Im starring right at it I finally got her to look on there own website and see that the connections are real .	St
1.3.4	Then she try to tell me that I need a device that would change my analog from analog to digital then back to analog again then send it to the analog connection on the media center .	St
1.3.5	Then I showed her on there website where it say you can capture video directly from analog devices such as vcr , or analog camcorder then she wanted to charge me $ 65.00 to talk to someone who would be able to tell me how the ports ( that she said werent real ) work .	St
1.4.1	This is proper since there is no detection that such were connected .	St
1.4.2	It 's an old electronics issue and not a bug or omission by anyone .	St
1.4.3	If the unit claims you can convert your media and you ca n't find out how then why not ask for every dime back ?	Ques
