Having your link explains alot(thanks).
As Robert offered, replacing the enclosure would be the better fix &quot;if&quot; you can't find another AC wart.
Plus, the cost may push you into getting a new enclosure anyways, if you found one.
I also consider this an unique adapter, because of the dual-voltages, so it becomes harder to replace.
Check these links: http://www.alleletronics.com http://www.bgmicro.com -OR- google away for surplus or used parts vendors.
