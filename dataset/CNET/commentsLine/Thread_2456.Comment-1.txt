i have a host dell desktop with xp and a guest emachine desktop also with xp.
i have a linksys broadband router and a linksys wireless card.
the dell has working internet with no problems.
i have tried to set up a network (many times) and the wireless connection is fine.
however, the local area connection says &quot;the network cable is unplugged&quot;.
???
its wireless, right?
what does this mean?
