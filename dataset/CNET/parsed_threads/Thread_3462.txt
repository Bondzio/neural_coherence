<s> Sorry but this is a second post as I accidentally posted in the laptop forum. </s>
<s> Hello all. </s>
<s> I have a desktop computer that is part of a home network and runs W2000pro. </s>
<s> My drive was zapped in a storm and I had to reinstall. </s>
<s> My adapter will not reconnect with the wireless router without the instalation CD that, naturally,I've lost. </s>
<s> The adapter is a Microsoft MN 510-51. </s>
<s> I downloaded a driver from Drivers.com but it didn't work. </s>
<s> I went into Microsoft's download site and gave up trying to navigate the site after trying for a long time. </s>
<s> I have a feeling that I not only need the driver but I need the instalation disk that came with the adapter Now, after all that, can anyone tell me where I can purchase or otherwise acquire a copy of the installation disk. </s>
<s> Thanks for your patience in reading and any assistance you can offer. </s>

<s> Microsoft Broadband Network Utility . </s>
<s> (It's near the bottom of the page.) </s>
<s> Direct download link (12.7MB): http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=33104 </s>
<s> Or drivers. </s>
<s> Your post is too light on details. </s>
<s> For instance some (most in fact) AMD based machines also require a motherboard driver package before the cards that plug in function. </s>
<s> You've left out the details so members can't see where the issue might be. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I didn't list more details of my rig as the hardware profile is exactly as it was before the crash when the adapter installed no problem with the supplied software. </s>
<s> By the same token I now have less drivers as it is a new install. </s>
<s> I downloaded the drivers from MS as kindly supplied by linkit. </s>
<s> The drivers are presumably up to date. </s>
<s> The only major variable that I saw was the difference between the original CD and the downloaded software. </s>
<s> However I may be off base on that one. </s>
<s> The situation at present is that the new drivers change the error in the Device Manager and show the adapter as being functional. </s>
<s> However all that shows in my task bar is the LAN icon with an unplugged tag. </s>
<s> I have tried to call up the adapter icon by going through the &quot;make a new connection&quot; routine but . </s>
<s> as they say in the trade, To no avail Think I'll leave it for now and hope the muse talks to me in my sleep. </s>
<s> Cheers Stewart </s>
<s> Router firmware updated, too? </s>
<s> Try this: In the list of &quot;Preferred networks,&quot; click on the &quot;Remove&quot; button to remove the stored connection settings for the network. </s>
<s> After you do that, either &quot;Add&quot; the &quot;Preferred network&quot; again, or just try to connect to the detected network. </s>
<s> Any luck? </s>
<s> I don't see a post here about the hardware before or after the crash. </s>
<s> Your choice here, but you may have passed up the chance someone would have noted a driver you need. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the MS driver link Problem is that this is a clean reinstall so there is no connection history. </s>
<s> Also I have no way of calling up preferred networks. </s>
<s> However, thanks for your efforts. </s>
<s> Regards Stewart </s>
<s> What happens when you double-click on the taskbar icon? </s>
<s> Does a window that says &quot;Choose a wireless network&quot; appear? </s>
<s> I open a window &quot;Network and dial-up connections&quot; there is a message &quot;To create a new connection, click &quot;New Connection&quot; but when you try for a new connection you get a choice of two dial-up alternatives a direct cable link to anothr computer,an accept incoming connections, and a connect to private network through the internet. </s>
<s> My adapter is blinking away so it wants to do something and is probably disgusted that I can't oblige. </s>
<s> Cheers Stewart </s>
<s> I thought your MN-510 is a wireless-b adapter? </s>
<s> You are supposed to use it to connect to some type of wireless access point. </s>
<s> Therefore, you need to use the &quot;Network Setup Wizard&quot; and not &quot;create a new connection.&quot; What is your setup? </s>
<s> Do you have a wireless router? </s>
<s> If you need help in finding it, just type &quot;Network Setup Wizard&quot; into Help and Support. </s>
<s> Sorry, you did say Windows 2000 and not XP. </s>
<s> Yes Linkit I have a simple three-computer home network with a wireless router and a modem connection to the Canada Bell Broadband service. </s>
<s> It has been working flawlessly for the past two or three years untill my HDD got fried. </s>
<s> What I don'r understand is that the adapter icon appears unmarked and kosher in Device Manager but can't be persuaded to show up in the network window. </s>
<s> Considering the time I'm spending on this problem, I would ne better off to just buy another adapter with its own install disk. </s>
<s> They're cheap enough but I'm hooked on solving this mystery. </s>
<s> Good night or good morning as the case may be. </s>
<s> Stewart </s>
<s> Hey Linkit. </s>
<s> I found a copy of the original adapter set-up disk that I had burned, in my caotic pile of &quot;stuff&quot; in my bottom drawer. </s>
<s> I ran it and hey pres! </s>
<s> I'm back on net. </s>
<s> It confirms what I suspected: that drivers are sometimes not enough as the set-up disk holds other secrets. </s>
<s> So now I can sleep a bit more soundly:-) Thanks for your contribution. </s>
<s> Regards Stewart </s>
<s> Even though I've been disappointed in Microsoft's support pages for their networking hardware, I'm glad you're in the good. </s>
<s> Happy networking! </s>
