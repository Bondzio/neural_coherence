<s> My dvd burner broke it reads dvds/ cd and will burn cds but when I put in a blank dvd it all the sudden thinks its a cd drive and says that the drive cant be accessed when I try to open the drive through my computer. </s>
<s> This happened to my laptop and desktop when I was burning dvds. </s>
<s> I thought that maybe the drives broke so today I went out and bought an external sony dvd drive and guess what same thing. </s>
<s> I have uninstalled the drivers, windows and just about everything else and in out of ideas so please help! </s>
<s> What is the software? </s>
<s> software are you running ? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> i was using dvd cloner for dvds i dont thinks its a software issue cause i just reinstalled windows on my desktop and it still has the same issue with the dvd drives even with the external one that i plug in through the USB port... </s>
<s> The 4 copies were made and it was game over. </s>
<s> The drives ceased to work. </s>
<s> Research UPPERFILTERS XP on google.com for a possible cure. </s>

<s> i did not reinstall anything i just reinstalled windows and then checked to see if either drive would reconize a blank DVD...they didnt </s>

<s> WinXP natively recognizes and will burn CD but when it comes to DVD, I'd describe WinXP as 'DVD' unaware. </s>
<s> I don't think a CD-DVD burner under WinXP will be recognized as DVD without some DVD SW loaded. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> The main problem is when i stick the dvd in the drive, the drive in my computer no longer thinks is a dvd drive it just says cd drive and when i access it it says that there is 0 free space on the disk (yes its a new DVD) and i already tried the upperfilters and lowerfilters or whatever didnt work... </s>
<s> Why won't my copied DVDRW disc play on the DVD drive, or DVD player? </s>
<s> http://www.dvd-cloner.com/faqs.html The &quot;contact us&quot; tab might be a good idea on this site. </s>
<s> It's there software. </s>
<s> If this doesn't fix the problem you might need a new CD/DVD drive driver. </s>
<s> What brand is it? </s>
<s> See device management in your OS for this information. </s>
<s> Post it here. </s>
<s> Technologies do change and drivers do need up dating from time to time. </s>
<s> I check all my drivers in device manager every 6-9 months. </s>
<s> Just right click on an item and choose update driver. </s>
<s> Sometimes this doesn't work and you have to search them down. </s>
<s> eSupport.com has a tool that might help. </s>
<s> If yes...what happens when you start the DVD SW and then try a DVD disc ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Windows only knows such about partitions. </s>
<s> It can't calculate anything about blank CDs or DVDs. </s>
<s> It doesn't know what kind of disk is in the drive at all. </s>
<s> I presume it defaults to CD because they've been around longer. </s>
<s> Only your DVD software can look at the drive to see if it's DVD capable and attempt to access the disk. </s>
<s> If nothing's on it, it cannot view it. </s>
<s> i thought it might be the drive also so i went out and bought a brand new sony external drive and same problem. </s>
