<s> &quot;Mommy, there's a monster in my computer.&quot; was the first thing that popped into my head. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814121213 This guy (in the review) has 2 of them in SLI. </s>
<s> I'm going to pass out. </s>
<s> Imagine the power needed and the heat. </s>
<s> i wish i had 1400 to drop right now id rock 2 in no time. </s>
<s> ;) </s>
<s> At almost $1800 for the two cards, you could build a decent gaming machine instead. </s>
<s> Although that is pretty awesome, there is no way I can ever afford something like that. </s>
<s> Wow what a card you showed. </s>
<s> These are some monsters I came across Check this card out: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=326030 And this one: http://www.maximumpc.com/2005/10/gigabyte_gv-3d1_1.html </s>
<s> But you can't SLI the card you mentioned, cause it doesn't have an SLI Bridge connector. </s>
<s> I think you mean only one.... </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> need a sli bridge connector anymore </s>
<s> I never knew that newer nvidia cards don't need an SLI bridge. </s>
<s> Are you sure about this? </s>
<s> Then how will the cards get connected to form SLI? </s>
<s> throught the motherboard? </s>
<s> I guess the reviewer was bluffing so it was deleted. </s>
<s> A &quot;Real&quot; Nvidia employee who had the card, said; &quot;Pros: This a very good selection however the poster above obviously does not have this card (I DO)and he is lying about working for NVIDIA because (I DO) it is importaint to know that this card runs in SLI ... on its OWN PCB board NOT 2 CARDS togeather similar to the 3D1 cards by GIGABYTE this card is just not AS limited as those others motherboard wise, what this board does is eliminate the space that hampers two seperate cards by mateing the two on one board wich gives it the advantage of the (to be exact)27,203 score in 3dmark05 the score with a single core enabled is (11,138) you can not run quad cores YET!!!!! </s>
<s> and I think that it is wrong that people are lead to believe you can so the review was not written by a owner of this card so if you are a hard core gamer stick with two 7800GTX's or GT's they are the best choice right now for a two card SLI setup Cons: Have to use the drivers it comes with because until an update comes thats all you can use, This card is rather LARGE because of each core has 256mb DDR3 around it,it is double wide it comes out almos... More t to the window to my case (TT XASER3) thats it besides you CANT RUN QUAD CORES YET! </s>
<s> IT'S HYPE&quot; </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com/2005/12/14/sneak_preview_of_the_nvidia_quad_gpu_setup/index.html </s>
<s> Is that even possible? </s>
<s> What I'm saying is; Is there a game that can take advantage of this power? </s>
<s> I think this is more for bragging rights than actual use. </s>
<s> Hurray for conspicuous consumption. </s>
