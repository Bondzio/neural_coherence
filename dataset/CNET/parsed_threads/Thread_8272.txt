<s> Been thinking of getting a tablet for a few weeks now and am having trouble deciding between the iPad and the galaxy tab. </s>
<s> I've played around with the Note and I quite like the tablet (not sure how different the note is to the galaxy tab other then the specs and a flashy stylus), but it's a little out of my price range, however I have some reservations about the galaxy tab. </s>
<s> I currently own an android phone, the HTC One X and have some disappointing issues with it and because of that I am uncertain if it want to invest in an Android tablet, although I am beginning to think it's an issue with HTC, not Android. </s>
<s> I intend to use the tablet for reading e-books, music, browsing and maybe the occasional video. </s>
<s> The one of the problems I have with my HTC is getting media on to the phone. </s>
<s> I know you can mount them like a disc drive but I used HTC's own manager which is utterly horrible, which is one of the reasons why the iPad seems to be a better as iTunes is a lot easier to use as it's left a bad stain on my experience with android. </s>
<s> With the Samsung, I like being able to add more storage through the use of SD card as I don't really like being locked into just one amount of storage. </s>
<s> In the end, I am stuck in the middle with this decision and cannot decide, so looking for a little advice. </s>
<s> I don't want to repeat the long discussion about media encoding but what I've seeing are folk expecting these tablets to play whatever you can on a PC. </s>
<s> Nothing is farther from reality. </s>
<s> The iPad is a little better at this as you funnel most content through iTunes and it can re-encode content (sometimes) and if you get content from the store, it's encoded properly which makes some folk think it's a better player. </s>
<s> And a runner up is the Kindle Fire. </s>
<s> It's not that expensive compared to the others and with Amazon Prime you get a lot of content. </s>
<s> About the media card. </s>
<s> With streaming and more, that idea is losing ground. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Video playback on a tablet is something I would do rarely, I'm of the opinion that if I want to watch a movie I have a perfectly good TV not far away, it's something I would do say while travelling. </s>
<s> I know the galaxy tab supports more file types but a friend with an iPad has shown me a useful app that will do the same thing. </s>
<s> I know adding/deleting music is so much easier on iTunes, add the song and sync, I tried to add a song (just one) to HTC sync manager and the program tried to add the entire folder. </s>
<s> As for data storage, I agree with you Bob, there are a lot more services out there like the iCloud and Dropbox that I could use if need be. </s>
<s> So far the iPad is seeming a better option for me. </s>
