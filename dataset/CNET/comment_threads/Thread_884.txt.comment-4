The driver for the T3000 should be at HP support website or simply google away for it.
http://www.driversguide.com has been my driver website of choice.
You may need to register but everything is free to d/l.
I had a similar tape drive, maybe it was T3000 or T5000 but gave-up after it took soooooo long to back-up.
