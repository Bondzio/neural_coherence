I had a 40Gb Maxtor external, it went, and I can't use any of my spare HDs with the USB case, I have 2 120 Gb Maxtor externals, both holding the same data, normally diconnected ( I only connect to a PC, for read/write, which has been completely scanned ), a 120GB internal ( which is external most of the time ) holding much of the same data, and the same data is scattered around a few more internal HDs.
I haven't lost any data but it's not easy to find what I'm looking for when I want to check on it.
System, it's not.
Data bank, OK.
I probably have 10 copies of some files (over-over-overkill) but I wouldn't even mention the possibility of cleaning the system up, unless somebody knows of a utility which can sort it all out.
HAH!!!
!
