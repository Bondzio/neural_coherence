I'm from kuwait .
i bought it from Bin Khaldon St. in Hawali.
It's a famous St. where there're alot of computer stores.
I paid 27 k.d for it.
About 81 US Dollars.
But i heard Intel Celeron D is not good for gaming.
So i thought changing the processor may boost gaming.
Speciely HT tech.
i though it might help.
thank u
