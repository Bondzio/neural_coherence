i have been using lexmark z2420, it produced text at a rate of 10.1 pages per minute (ppm), just slightly above average for this category.
when printing colour graphics, however, it posted some very slow speeds.
the lexmark z2420's print quality rose or fell depending on the type of paper.
on the plain paper we use, the black ink faded to charcoal and tended to spread on the page, resulting in slightly faded and fuzzy-looking letters.
color photos also appeared faded and grainy.
on lexmark's own photo paper, the same images brightened and showed improved, crisper details.
but indeed it is a cheap printer with low maintenance jwp -------------- cheap phaser 8560 ink and xerox 8560 supplies from concordsupplies.com.
great deals, 100% money-back guarantee & same day shipping.
