<s> Hi everyone, I'm working on a 7 old dell optiplex. </s>
<s> I've got a 40GB HDD that gets recognized by the Windows XP install cd. </s>
<s> The XP cd formats and begins install on the drive. </s>
<s> The system reboots but the HDD doesn't get seen by the bios. </s>
<s> I tried to run SpinRite on the drive, but it doesn't see that either. </s>
<s> I've reset the IDE cables. </s>
<s> My drive is set to master. </s>
<s> I haven't tried hooking it up to another computer yet. </s>
<s> That is my next step. </s>
<s> Any other ideas or has this 7 yr old dell given up the ghost? </s>
<s> The last time I saw a machine that the BIOS didn't see a HDD but Windows did, involved some SCSI controller card. </s>
<s> But you wrote IDE. </s>
<s> Try the BIOS defaults and another IDE cable and drive. </s>
