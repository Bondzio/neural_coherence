hi all, ok, i bought an ati sapphire radeon 9250 td 128mb.
i have an abit k7 mobo.
128mb ram, 800mh amd athlon using winxp pro.
i used to have an nvidia 64mb riva tnt2 64/64pro and everything worked fine, so long as the games were old.
ask me for any other specs.
ok, ive turned off and deleted drivers of the previous hardware acceleration, put in the new card correctly.
booted on a clean install of windows, run the installer, using catalyst 5.2 or whatever is latest software interface and drivers, but as soon as the drivers are loaded the screen turns black with blinking underscore in the top left hand corner.
so later i run in diagnostic mode, turn off accelaration, and the problem goes away, so i can get a basic display but i cant use acceleration.
also, when running without acceleration catalyst errors and cannot start with mention about there not being a ati card present or its working drivers i would really like to start playing games at my friends pace, is there anyone who can help?
