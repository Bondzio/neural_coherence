<s> Hi, I currently own a Dell Dimension 3000. </s>
<s> I know, I know. </s>
<s> But anyways, it has one CD Drive, which is just that. </s>
<s> Not CD-RW or DVD Drive. </s>
<s> What the weird thing is that when my computer goes into Standby the CD seems to turn itself off. </s>
<s> It is not seen in either the Device Manager or in My Computer. </s>
<s> I have to restart the computer to find it. </s>
<s> I've checked for Virus' and Spyware/Adware. </s>
<s> Nothing found using McAfee and AVG 7.1. </s>
<s> I've done the basics, checked the power cables on the Drive and also the IDE cables. </s>
<s> The weird thing is that the drive still opens and closes when the computer can't &quot;find&quot; it. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> that your computer is just turning the drive off just to save some power... </s>
<s> But to me it might be a virus... </s>
<s> But I'd never heard of a computer shutting down a IDE device to save power. </s>
<s> I've heard of the computer maybe shutting down a USB device, but never of a IDE device. </s>
<s> Either way I scoured the device manager properties of the CD drive to see what it had about power. </s>
<s> It was listed as S3. </s>
<s> But like I said, it still get's power and it'll open and close the drive bay. </s>
<s> I'd thought about virus' but as I mentioned I scanned with two virus' programs... </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply! </s>

<s> Check Dell's suppport website for any FAQ's or details that direct you to frequent problems. </s>
<s> It maybe a known problem with a cure. </s>
<s> I suggest for now to &quot;turn-off&quot; stand-by and see if that alone rids the problem. </s>
<s> Then proceed to what if any cures are provided by Dell. </s>
<s> If none, check MS knowledge base for again any problems associated with CD drives. </s>
<s> You can google away and see what responds as well. </s>
<s> More often than not, someone has already experienced your problem and provided the solution to install or guide you through it. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I've realized that it wasn't stand-by that was causing the problem, but when I exited Age of Empires 2 the CD drive would disappear. </s>
<s> I'm going thru the FAQ's as I type. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
