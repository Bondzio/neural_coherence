With two different Channel, I can still share file and printer..
Right?
i.e.
read/write and print to a laptop that connected in different channel.. As for security, like I mention in my post, the 'open wifi network' is turn off/on as needed (when a there is a guess) As for putting or letting the guess in DMZ zone, this involving AP/router configuration everytime a guess is coming.. correct?
Thank You
