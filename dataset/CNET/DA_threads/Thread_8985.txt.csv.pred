1.1.4	Any ideas on how to get it running again?	St
1.1.5	Also when i reboot my comp with the hard drive pluged in it keeps cycling the restart, gets to the windows xp screen then restarts, but if the hard drive isn't plugged in i get no problems, And ideas?	St
1.1.6	The stuff on the hard drive is important and i need to access it ASAP	St
1.2.1	hard drives are temporary storage only and they can die at the worst moment.	St
1.2.2	Do you have backups on optical disk?	St
1.2.3	If not you can Google data recovery to find a company that might be able to recover your data.	St
1.2.4	In short, the drive is dead.	St
1.2.5	There is the off chance that the case has died.	St
1.2.6	You might try putting the drive into another case or as a slave in your PC.	Sug
1.3.1	Did you try another computer?	St
1.3.2	Do you hear the drive spinning?	St
1.3.3	Did you try the read USB ports?	St
1.3.4	It's not lost yet but in your hurry to post you didn't tell all.	St
1.3.5	Bob	St
1.4.1	Sorry, The drive works fine on other computers, and I'm having trouble on all the ports, my usb mouse works fine in the one its in - scared to try to move it.	St
1.4.2	It gives me the error 10, but on the uub controller I have a error 28- thats whats causing the problem I'm guessing.	St
1.4.3	Also another thing I noticed is on my computer there are no network connections, even tho I can see my printer on the network and have internet.	St
1.4.4	But no way to accsess it	St

1.6.1	Okay sorry I have a gateway laptop, running windows xp sp 2. has the 4 usb 2.0 ports, not sure what else there is, Under device manger Other devices has a yellow &quot;?&quot; then mass storage controller that is under that has a yello&quot;?&quot; with a yellow and black &quot;!&quot; Then at the bottom there is an unknown tab with: 1294 Net Adapter Broadcom 802.11g network adapter - with a yellow &quot;!&quot; blaodcom 802.11g adapter = packet scheduler miniport direct parallel MArvel Yukon 88e8036 pci -e fast ethernet controller Marvel Yukon 99e9036 pic-e fast ethernet controller- packet scheduler miniport WAN Miniport(IP) Wan Miniport (IP)- scheduler miniport WAN Miniport (L2TP) Wan Miniport (PPOE) Wan miniport (PPTP) Also while i am connected to the internet, nothing shows up in my network connections....	St
1.7.1	You can change it back if you need to later.	St
1.7.2	-&gt; Look for &quot;USB LEGACY SUPPORT&quot; and turn that off.	St
1.7.3	Bob	St
1.8.1	It didn't do anything, so i changed it back, my external is recognized now, but I still have the yellow &quot;?&quot;'s and &quot;!&quot;'s and also nothing in my networks folder....	St
1.9.1	As to the network issues, it sounds as if drivers or maybe some firewall like Norton, Mcafee took a dive.	St
1.9.2	But let's start a new discussion on that.	St
1.9.3	Bob	St
1.10.1	Cool, on the new decsussion, but any idea what the &quot;?&quot;'s mean?	St
1.11.1	NIL	St
1.12.1	So today I went to turn on my laptop, and it keeps restarting after the gateway screen, so i unplug my external HD, and it boots up fine.	St
1.12.2	I plug in my external, and doesn't work, ahve the yellow &quot;?&quot; for it.	St
1.12.3	any idea's?	St
1.13.1	1.	St
1.13.2	The bios has usb set to be bootable.	St
1.13.3	2.	St
1.13.4	There is a corrupt file on the root directory of the usb drive.	St
1.13.5	You may solve this soon.	St
1.14.1	If i go in and change that - how would i?	St
1.14.2	Woud that fix the fact that i cant find the harddrive on my computer when its plugged in?	St
1.15.1	Reply to the top when we hit the depth limit.	St
1.15.2	&quot;If i go in and change that - how would i?	St
1.15.3	Woud that fix the fact that i cant find the harddrive on my computer when its plugged in?&quot; First, you would read your Gateway manual on the BIOS changes.	St
1.15.4	Next, the drive appears to be still dead or corrupt.	St
1.15.5	At some point you had it working so that was the time to get your files out and to a safe place.	St
1.15.6	Scanning your discussion it looks like some motherboard or other driver has gone missing.	St
1.15.7	Who installed this OS?	St
1.15.8	Bob	St
1.16.1	All of the stuff on the External HD Is backed up to where I can get it - Just easier on the external.	St
1.16.2	As far as installing the OS, That was done by Gateway, Haven't touched it sense i got it.	St
1.16.3	As for the BIOS changes, I can't seem to find where to go in the BIOS, as I don't have the manual anymore - been about a year now and 2 moves.	St
1.17.1	Above you wrote an answer to &quot;Look for &quot;USB LEGACY SUPPORT&quot; and turn that off.&quot; that told me you had done that.	St
1.17.2	Now you claim you don't know how to get into the BIOS... Something's fishy.	St
1.17.3	The manual is up at gateway.com Bob	St
1.18.1	Sorry I guess I didn't write it correctly, I did turn off USB LEGAcy SUPPORT, But now in the BIOS Menu, I can't find where to turn off the Boot from USB.	St
1.18.2	I can't find the option to turn that off anywhere in the BIOS.	St
1.18.3	Sorry for the mis wording, I will look at the Manual right now, and try to follow it when i get off work in an hour	St
1.19.1	I went through this discussion twice and couldn't spot the model number of this gateway laptop.	St
1.19.2	It's very important to give such details in your first entry so that others can fetch the details.	St
1.19.3	As it is I can't check for a manual or point to a page number, suggest a driver, etc.	St
1.20.1	But really appericate your help, I have the Gateway MX6440 laptop.	St
1.21.1	Sometimes I can't find the right words and people don't understand I'm asking for that.	St
1.21.2	For reference the manual and more is at http://support.gateway.com/s/Mobile/Q106/Blade/1008824nv.shtml I'll be back later when I've read more.	St
1.21.3	Bob	St
1.22.1	&quot;If available, change the BIOS settings for the hard drive sequence, making sure the USB device is at the top of the list above all other hard drives.	St
1.22.2	Not all BIOS Setup Utilities have this option.&quot; I can't find the exact screens for your BIOS so I will not be able to guide you on how to disable the USB boot process.	St
1.22.3	Bob	St
1.23.1	Bob, I tired to find it but I can't find it in my BIOS, I don't think mine has that option, Also It kept turning off on me in the BIOS, the first time I had about 5 min worth of time to look, then it shut off, i figured i hit something, then Had maybe a mintune, then down to lucky to get 15 seconds before the machine turns its self off, but when I boot to windows its fine... well except the missing wireless and External	St
1.24.1	Would it be worth it to reinstall windows?	St
1.24.2	would that fix my problems?	St
1.24.3	As I don't want to do it but its starting to look like i have no other choice	St
1.25.1	I've reread this missive and are we still talking about the external hard disk issue?	St
1.26.1	In the long of it yes, I still can't get the external HD to work on this computer, I also have the problems with my wireless card in the computer.	St
1.26.2	I have thought that reinstalling windows would set it all to the way it was before any of this started as it would get back to factory settings, I would just need to spend a day or two backing up all my files like music and school work onto DVD's = something I don't really have the time or engery to do.	St
1.26.3	and that would be a last resort If you can think of anything else, in the other thread you asked If i have norton = i do not for anti virus I use McAfee and AVG with Ad=aware for anti spyware.	Sug
1.26.4	I do appericate all your help and willingness to try to help find out what is causeing this	St
1.27.1	I work at OfficeMax, and was able to get another External - got a Maxtor one touch and have the same problem with it, So its not the drive as the drive works on the other 3 computers I have access to in my house	St
1.28.1	Have you installed the latest version of that?	St
1.29.1	I haven't touched anything that says motherboard, as I know thats a big deal to the computer and not knowing a whole lot didn't want to mess up something even worse, I will download the driver tonight and see what it does.	St
1.29.2	Can a driver just stop working like that?	St
1.30.1	Let me fish (re-read) your post and I'll see if I can give up a link on the driver I'd install.	Sug
1.30.2	Bob	St
1.31.1	It's at http://support.gateway.com/support/drivers/search.asp?st=pn&param=1008824 Before running that, I'd unplug the USB drives and uninstall the USB ports in the device manager.	St
1.31.2	XP will redetect on the next boot after the driver install.	St
1.31.3	Bob	St
1.32.1	I tired uninstalling the USB drivers, then reinstalled them, but it changed nothing, just when i started up it asked to search for drivers, and didn't find anything.	St
1.33.1	&quot;i started up it asked to search for drivers, and didn't find anything.&quot; That means our motherboard drivers are not installed proper.	St
1.33.2	You can expect a machine in such a state to hang when USB devices are plugged in.	St
1.33.3	Looking again for another driver package since the gateway one didn't work.	St
1.33.4	http://www.randomfix.com/2007/02/08/gateway-mx6440-notebook-modem-and-sound-driver-problem/ is damming.	St
1.33.5	Great scott, they have an unofficial web site with the rest of the drivers.	St
1.33.6	I'll try one more time before I ask you to call gateway to ask them to give you the secret web site.	Sug
1.33.7	http://support.gateway.com/s/Mobile/Q106/Blade/1008824sp2.shtml tells me its the ATI Radeon Xpress 200M Chipset (RS482M).	St
1.33.8	This driver is at AMD now.	St
1.33.9	But where?	St
1.33.10	Try http://findfiles.com/list.php?string=ati_system_drive_mb.zip&size=180256102&db=Mirrors Bob	St
1.34.1	The driver wasn't installed correctly, I think it just had a hicup when installing, I just did it again and its all working now, just now i still have my 2 little yellow friends in the devices manger, as well as no wireless internet and no External support - one more wrench in the thing - my usb mouse and jump drive work fine, but not the Seagate external.... weird huh?	St
1.35.1	Well i did it - i reinstalled windows, I got my wireless driver back, but now my external is still not showing up - not its not even in the disk managment.	St
1.35.2	any idea's?	St
1.36.1	But maybe I missed something.	St
1.36.2	I see Vista is now the OS supplied.	St
1.36.3	Are you using their restore CDs?	St
1.37.1	My laptop came with XP, So I used their restore CD that came with it - lost all my music, and files - i can get them back but it's just a pain, so its back to factory default as far as i can tell.	St
1.37.2	It reinstalled everything, as I only had the options of reinstall(destructive) and restore- which said it would save all files but didn't, but it appears to have reinstalled my drivers for my wireless that had the same problem but not the external.	St
1.37.3	as all my other usb devices that i could find in the house work, But the external works on all the other computers.	St
1.37.4	I think i'm going to try to use another computer to transfur everything to a new external and try that.	St
1.38.1	It could be that note about what you installed.	St
1.38.2	&quot;My laptop came with XP, So I used their restore CD that ..&quot; XP doesn't support over 127GB drives so after a restore to XP I have to get SP1 at minimum installed for big drives to show up.	St
1.38.3	Bob	St
