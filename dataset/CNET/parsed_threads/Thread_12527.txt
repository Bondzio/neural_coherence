<s> I'm looking into buying a Portable external hard drive. </s>
<s> I need something lightweight (&lt;1lb) but would also like the maximum capacity. </s>
<s> I've narrowed it down to 2 options. </s>
<s> 1.Western Digital Passport- 120GB USB 2.0 - 2.5&quot; External Hard Drive OR 2.Seagate Portable ST9100801U2 External 100GB Hard Drive The Western Digital only has 2MB cache. </s>
<s> The Seagate offers 8MB cache and 2 USB connections &quot;for improved performance&quot; but the hard drive is 20GB smaller. </s>
<s> Recommendations?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> One USB connection will likely fail to deliver enough power on most laptops. </s>
<s> I own the 60GB model and have nothing to write about it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> throughput is limited by USB 2.0. </s>
<s> You can also 'build your own' so to speak....pick out an external case of choice and a 2.5&quot; drive of choice and you're done. </s>
<s> On the plus side you've got a much longer warranty if that matters to you...most 'off the shelf' externals are limited to 1 year enclosure and drive. </s>
<s> Most stand alone enclosures have 1 year warranties and stand alone drive warranties vary from 1 to 5 years. </s>
<s> Now some mfgs are now offering 7,200RPM laptop HDDs...again your choice </s>
<s> I've heard that some laptops don't have enough power. </s>
<s> Are there any tips for dealing with this? </s>
<s> It has this cable -&gt; http://www.google.com/search?q=AA2USBPC But this is only needed where its needed. </s>
<s> For me, it's supplied with that drive so that's what I use all the time. </s>
