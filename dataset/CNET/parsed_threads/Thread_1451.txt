<s> I'm going to be building a new system and have about $1200 to spend. </s>
<s> Here's what I've got so far. </s>
<s> Please feel free to voice whatever opinions you may have on what I'm throwing together here. </s>
<s> My last two things to buy are the P4 and the case. </s>
<s> Any recommendations? </s>

<s> NEC ND-3520A Black IDE DVD Burner Please let me know what you see as bottlenecks or future issues to deal with. </s>
<s> After the above I don't have a ton of dough left over to spend on the chip. </s>
<s> I haven't built a system since my 1999 PIII 500, I'm having to learn a few new things. </s>

<s> You usually want to design a system around the CPU you are going to use. </s>
<s> Since you say you are very limited on what you can spend now because of the other peripheral devices on your list, I would go back and reevaluate this first. </s>
<s> Then you would add your peripheral devices LAST. </s>
<s> The motherboard you have chosen looks excellent. </s>
<s> Keep in mind that it only has 3 PCI slots and would be limited for expansion in that area. </s>
<s> It all depends on what cards you want to add in the future. </s>
<s> If you are a hard core gamer, you might want to consider more memory on the video card, depending on what games you are planning to use. </s>
<s> 512Mb cards are out there but cost a lot. </s>
<s> Make sure your CAS rating on the memory is 2.0 for the best performance and make SURE that it is a MATCHED pair for your dual channel DDR to function properly. </s>
<s> An excellent case to consider is the Lian Li case line. </s>
<s> They are very well made and you will be pleased with how easy they are to work with. </s>
<s> I see no other bottlenecks in what you have posted. </s>
<s> It may not have the correct connector for the Mobo main power plug. </s>
<s> See this link for some more info. </s>

<s> Good points. </s>
<s> I left the chip for last and it looks like I'll have to increase my budget by about 300 bucks in order to get a p4 650 3.4. </s>
<s> The graphics card will have to stay in the 256 range for the time being. </s>
<s> I'm also mainly going to be doing video editing on this system. </s>
<s> Any other suggestions with this in mind? </s>
<s> PCI slots could be an issue at some point as well in the future. </s>
<s> I guess a new mobo in a couple years would fix that. </s>
<s> The PCI slots should not be an issue in the future. </s>
<s> The Asus photo shows you are getting a mobo with: 1- PCI-Express x16 (for the video card) 2- PCI-Express x1 (small white bus) some mobo's with x1 &quot;Express PCI Technology&quot; only have one instead of 2. </s>
<s> 3- PCI (regular standard large white bus). </s>
<s> The PCI-Express is the wave of the future, and look for more mobo's to have less regular PCI as time goes on. </s>
<s> I don't see you having to get a new mobo for some time (years). </s>
<s> http://www.asus.com/products/mb/socket775/p5ad2-e-p/overview.htm The cheapest P4 650 3.4GHz is $411 at PriceWatch. </s>
<s> Newegg is $419. </s>
<s> Don't forget $'s for a case, and the WinXP Operating System...Home complete $187, or Pro Full version $276 Please see my post at the Hardware forum suggesting you might want to look at Monarch building it for you for $49. </s>
<s> Why go thru the hassle of doing something wrong, or time if you are short of,or headache's ... with no warranty other than what you get along with parts purchase. </s>
