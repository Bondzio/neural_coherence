i was an early adapter of htpc.
i bought a dedicated pc, added an hd tuner and used it as my dvd player.
the hd tuner allowed me to record off-the-air hdtv.
the dvd player allowed me to do up-sampling and provide an analog output.
but, the dvd player was difficult to control with my universal remote, the httv couldn't support directv, and setting up blu-ray would have required a new computer.
even with a new computer, it was unclear that i could buy a video card able to output 1080p thru hdmi and play hdcp protected discs.
for all these reasons, i decided to go to an all digital system, a dedicated blu-ray player and a new directv dvr which also supports over-the air hdtv.
it's wonderful
