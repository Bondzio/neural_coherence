I have got a similar set up as yours and the same problem.
I can't see a computer through my network neighbourhood, although I can ping it.
It used to work before, but for some reason has stopped working lately.
I have tried restarting both the computers, but it still doesn't work.
Each of the computers can see themselves in the network but they can't see each other.
Can someone help
