sorry, i couldn't follow what you just wrote.
but if i were to connect from my pc to one vpn and then try to connect to a second vpn the entire thing comes flying apart (and should.)
vpns are a bit tough to get one's head wrapped around at first but once you get the idea that your lan vanishes and you are magically transported onto the host's vpn and must think as if you were at that office and plugged into that network then it all makes sense.
