maybe i worry too much!
i have the disc for windows vista, and the disk for expression web.
i believe that is all i need to register those programs on a new drive.
the reason for me not wanting to mirror my old drive to the new one is because of all the junk that accumulates after time.
i did a mirror copy when i upgraded from windows xp to vista, also with a new drive.
when i loaded vista, i didn't select &quot;clean install&quot;, so a bunch of crap was left on the new drive.
now i want to get a good start with windows 7. i still have one more month to worry about getting it to work.
thanks... ken
