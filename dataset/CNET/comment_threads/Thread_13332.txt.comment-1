My Laptop says its getting signal from the router, but when I look at the connection status, it shows that its sending but not recieving &quot;packets.&quot; My other laptop's wireless connection works fine.
I think I may have activated the &quot;Share Internet Connection&quot; function by accident, which the Help Menu says is a no-no.
Can someone help me out?
