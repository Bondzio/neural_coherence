<s> You removed the stickers and tape from the bottom of the ink cartridges. </s>
<s> For help, refer to the setup documentation. </s>
<s> The paper is loaded correctly. </s>
<s> You installed both of the ink cartridges. </s>
<s> The Dell AIO Printer A920 will only work if you have both cartridges installed. </s>
<s> &quot; Sadly this printer has NO self test button. </s>

<s> &lt;&lt; It has. </s>
<s> Keep the paper-feed button pressed while turning on the printer. </s>
<s> A short test will be printed. </s>
<s> No need to be connected to a pc. </s>
