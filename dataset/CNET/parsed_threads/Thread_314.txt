<s> card. </s>
<s> Next thing I know, regardless of what else is in my computer nor where it is, my computer will not boot up with the soundblaster in. </s>
<s> Even with the little crappy one taken out, still no. </s>
<s> There are no errors or anything. </s>
<s> Nothing happens at all on the monitor. </s>
<s> No beeps, nothing. </s>
<s> I can boot up fine with whatever I please in, just as long as the soundblaster's not. </s>
<s> I hear my fans start up, but nothing happens. </s>
<s> Help? </s>
<s> try removing both cards, resetting the bios to defaults, and clearing the ecsd. </s>
<s> then save settings, turn off your pc, and reinstall your sb live. </s>
