Today I bought myself a macbook pro (running version 10.6) and have had trouble with my connection. My router is a WRT54 GS ver.6, i have had it around a year. I have a ps3, xbox, 2 wired windows PC and a windows laptop all connectiong to it, (Windows XP) without any problems. I plug the macbook in via an ethernet cable and it recognises it but cannot connect. I have an unprotected belkin router near my house which the macbook can connect to with ease. any ideas on why my macbook wont connect with the linksys, if you need further information just ask. Thanks Jk.

When you say that the macbook recognizes it, what do you mean? Does the MB have an IP address that starts with 192 or 169? (169 is not good) After not being able to load a page, does Safari display the Network Diagnostics button? If so, what happens when you proceed with the diagnostics? P

It accepts the key althought still wont connect to the internet. The status of &quot;AirPort&quot; in the network diagnostic is yellow, and underneath it says &quot;no ip address&quot;. It has something to do with my router because my macbook can connect to a belkin router nearby. I have tried turning the firewall and airport on and off but no luck. Im also sitting right next to my router. &quot;After not being able to load a page, does Safari display the Network Diagnostics button?&quot; Yes it displays that and says it cannot fix the current networking problem.

Turn OFF any wireless encryption, on the router, make sure that Airport is expecting an address via DHCP and reboot the Mac. P

Usually it is humorous. When I read your post question and got to the line that reads, &quot;I am also sitting next to my router,&quot; I read it as, &quot;I am also sitting next to my mother!&quot; So, ask her!

Did you try to change the port on the router for the ethernet cable? I hope your router can run g/N protocol, or N. You might like to see that it is not just b or g in the settings.
