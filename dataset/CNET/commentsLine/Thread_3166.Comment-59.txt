the life of any magnetic media type of hard drive (aka not flash) was studied by google.
hard drives less than 2 years old have a 2-3% chance of failing at any time.
after that the failure rate jumps considerably to 7-9%.
it is almost completely unlikely that drives will last longer than 15 years.
there are some things you can do to reduce your drives chance of failure, the most effective of which is running grc's spinrite on a regular basis.
it will keep your drive in good shape and is likely to warn you of imminent failure.
i would also recommend using an uninterruptable power supply to prevent sudden power losses which can damage drives or the contents therein.
the final and most important thing to do is backup.
one copy is no copies.
