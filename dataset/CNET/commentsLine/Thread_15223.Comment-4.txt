thanks kees_b and vapcmd i have already seen the information on the southbridge link you have provided.
an excellent article to be honest but it does not answer my question.
i actually am not sure what is happening whether its the bios sends the signal for the sb to check if there is a master and slave on the drive or is the sb which is doing the work and supplying the required information to the bios?
the issue will help me reduce some confusion that i have.
i am starting to believe that its the bios that checks the primary channel and the sb is simply a means to an end.
i just would like to confirm this.
the drives are all ide.
apparently that article does indicate thats the ide controller is rolled into the sb chipset.
the jumper is fine it just tells the bios/sb that the drive is a master or slave on that channel.
but then how does the bios know that its detecting a hd ide on the primary versus the secondary channel ?
how does it know this ?
what is the role of the sb when all of this happening ?
hope the above clearifies anyone's question and if it does not just please ask me again.
