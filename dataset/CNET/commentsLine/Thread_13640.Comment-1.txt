hello my name is marcelo, and i m planning on buying a pc for video editing, gaming, and i work with raphic programs like photoshop and illustrator; so i would need a pretty powerfull pc, besides i love computers and i would like a powerfull pc, because some people tell me that i dont need that much of a powerfull machine, but i want one anyway.
so my budget is kind of thight, well i'm planning on spending less than $1500, (just in the tower).
because i'm from uruguay, and i am an international student on the srjc in santa rosa, ca.
so i'm planning to take the computer back to uruguay with me, and i cant take the monitor, keyboard, speakers, etc.
this is a quote i was given here in santa rosa, that i tought it was pretty good but somebody else told me it was pricy, and that i could get a much better and cheap pc if i build it myself.
&quot;xtreme pcs&quot; cpu: intel core 2 duo processor e6400 2.13ghz ($266-$292) 1066mhz 2mb (i would like the 2.66ghz one, or at least the 2.40ghz one) ram: geil 2gb (2x1gb) 240-pin ddr2 sdram ($188-$206) ddr2 800 (pc2 6400)unbuffered dual channel kit system memory model (i would like at least 3 gb) video card: ($156-171$) xfx nvidia geforce 7600gt 256mb 580mhz 2dvi/hdtv pci-express video card (i really dont know about this) sound card: (not inclded in quote) we didnt specify one but, i would like to get one maybe a soundblaster?
(i dont know how much are them) hd: ($183-201$) hitachi deskatar t7k250 hdt722516dla380 250x2 gb 7200rpm 8mb cache sata 3.0gb/s hard drive-oem (i know this is a lot of storage space, but as i gonna be working with video and .pdf files i will need it) (i dont know if i should get a fastet rpm for such a big amount of storage space) cd/dvd: ($38-$42) samsung 18x double layer dvd+/-rw internal drive i would like 2, both with lightscribe and that burn all kind of cds and dvds.
motherboard: ($105-$115) intel bulkd946gzissl core 2 duo/946gz/ matx motherboard case: ($85-$103) i would just like a good looking one with a lot of ports in the front, like at least 1 firewire, 2 usb 2.0, and stuff for video and audio.
so that is the quote they gave me, in the prices the one on the left is the actual price, and the one on the right is what they charge me for it (they charge 10% of the hardware), and they charge me $100 to build it.
so in total this would be $1464, (without sound card, and maybe one more gb of ram).
i would really appreciate your help, any suggestions are welcome.
ps&gt;i cant really buy stuff online because i dont have a credit card, and i dont like doing it either.
