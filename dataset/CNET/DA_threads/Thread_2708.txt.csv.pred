1.1.1	Hi !	St
1.1.2	I just bought the above .	St
1.1.3	Have some questions .	St
1.1.4	1 ) which USB 2.0 hard disk should I buy ?	Ques
1.1.5	I need a hard disk of 300GB for home surveillance video recording and from Netgear 's website there 's no such compatible hard disk capacity .	St
1.1.6	take 100GB for 7hrs of video recording .	St
1.1.7	2 ) Can I just use any USB 2.0 casing with any 300GB hard disk for this purpose as it is cheaper than say to buy Maxtor OneTouch II 300GB ?	Ques
1.1.8	BTW , is the Maxtor OneTouch II compatible with the router ?	Ques
1.1.9	3 ) Is it true that even if you have a compatible hard disk the USB 2.0 performance fall very short of expectation ?	Ques
1.2.1	At the office we have 10 cameras and the 40GB drive holds 4 days of surviellance for all 10 cameras .	St
1.2.2	We take one frame per second on all time and use a lightwieght compression setting .	St
1.2.3	What are you using ?	Ques

1.3.1	Hi !	St
1.3.2	Thanks for the reply .	St
1.3.3	Actually , my quote of 100GB for 7hrs of video recording was taken from the box of the Maxtor OneTouch II 300GB hard disk at the shop .	St
1.3.4	So , I 'm not very sure too .	St
1.3.5	May be 300GB is too large for my home use .	St
1.3.6	Are you suggesting that , say , 80GB would be adequate for a day or 2 video recording via 2 nos x 24hrs of wireless internet cameras ?	Ques
1.3.7	I 'm open to suggestions .	St
1.3.8	Thanks again	St
1.4.1	The compression chosen .	St
1.4.2	Since we get many days on 10 cameras at 1 frame per second , I think there is hope your recording will fit .	St
1.4.3	But not revealed in your post are your settings or test results .	St
1.4.4	I 've shared mine .	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	Hi !	St
1.5.2	Frankly speaking I 've not bought my DLINK wireless internet cameras yet .	St
1.5.3	My first step is to get a storage router which I have now .	St
1.5.4	Next is to buy an external hard disk follow by the DLINK wireless internet cameras .	St
1.5.5	I 'm intending to set up a simple home surveillance system whereby I can see remotely and record for say 24hrs a day .	St
1.6.1	I had the DLINK Wireless Camera and there is a FATAL FLAW in that design .	St
1.6.2	Here 's the flaw .	St
1.6.3	Set it all up as the wireless link and start recording .	St
1.6.4	Hunkey dorey and all is well .	St
1.6.5	Now , remove power to the camera , count to 10 and put the power back to the camera .	St
1.6.6	The software locked up on the PC and no more recording .	St
1.6.7	This is not worth buying .	St
1.6.8	Bob PS .	St
1.6.9	I 'm sure you 've read the Forum tip .	St
1.6.10	If you can , in the future tell more about what you are doing and with what parts , forum members can be very helpful .	St
1.6.11	As you can see , I found the camera to be a & quot ; dud & quot ; .	St
1.7.1	Hi !	St
1.7.2	Thanks again .	St
1.7.3	I 'm not sure which DLINK camera you used but I intend to buy the DLINK DCS-6620G , here : - http : //www.dlink.com/products/ ? pid=411 BTW , can you help with the Netgear Storage Router and hard disk issue ?	Ques
1.7.4	Thanks	Polite
1.8.1	As to the storage issue .	St
1.8.2	I already noted that we get many days out of a 40GB drive and 10 cameras .	St
1.8.3	If we get that , would n't this be a good answer to your 2 camera recording ?	Ques
1.8.4	If you wo n't take my warning about the software issue , at least get it in writing what your return options are since it 's likely you may not believe this issue till you experience it first hand .	St
1.8.5	Good luck with this .	Polite
1.8.6	Bob	St
