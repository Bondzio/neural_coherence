i'd like some suggestions as to what a decent pc for various video operations would be.
for example: capturing & processing video with a pci pvr card.
ripping & processing & burning dvd video.
price is flexible, but i am interested in best bang for my buck this will be a dedicated unit that sits down by the home theater.
i'm even open to building it myself.
although i've never built one before, i have a bs in ee & i work full time as an embedded software engineer.
