1.1.1	Just curious , what cpu ( based upon the cpu 's out there now ) would run Vista faster , better , etc ?	Ques
1.1.2	An Athlon FX ( X2 ) or an Intel Core Duo ?	Ques
1.1.3	I am definitely not going with Vista for at least a year or so after it 's release , I know what the hardware requirements are now for Vista and was just curious .	St
1.1.4	All opinions are respected and appreciated .	Polite
1.1.5	Rocco	St
1.2.1	if u need a cpu for vista this second i sugest go with the x2 but if u can wait for a few months .	Sug
1.2.2	go for conroe that is even faster than the fx62 .	St
1.2.3	it will cost u a pretty penny but it will be worth it .	St
1.2.4	as for the x2 do n't go for anything lower than a 4200 .	St
1.2.5	4400x2 is recomended	St
1.3.1	I 'm personally in the middle of building an X2 4200+ system .	St
1.3.2	If I was going to go with a 4400+ , but since the AM2 versions are no longer being made/sold , I 'm stuck going cheaper since I capped my own price .	St
1.3.3	Anyway , enough about me .	St
1.3.4	I agree with the other guy .	St
1.3.5	If you can wait a good 3-4 months , I 'd build a Core 2 Duo/Core 2 Extreme-based system .	St
1.3.6	It will be expensive , but as of right now , the most expensive chip will still be cheaper then the afforementioned FX-62 by around $ 300 .	St
1.3.7	It will also destroy the FX-62 .	St
1.3.8	Of course , if you 're like me and you want to build something immediately , go with an AMD processor of your choosing , whether it be FX or X2 .	St
1.3.9	And I 'd also go with an AM2 socket processor , just so you can upgrade down the line if you need to .	St
1.3.10	DDR2 667mhz memory runs about the same speed as DDR 400mhz , so there 's plenty of good memory if you need it for cheap .	St
1.3.11	Just make sure you have a graphics card capable of jumping through hoops if you 're wanting all the fancy effects of Vista .	Sug
1.4.1	If you can wait and have the extra cash , then go with the Core Duo 2 becuase it seems to be the best deal at the moment .	Sug
1.4.2	Right now , it 's the X2 .	St
1.4.3	As for the video card , the minimum requirements I found is a GeForce FX 5200 , Radeon 9550 , or Radeon X300 .	St
1.5.1	I am not going to build one now or in the next month or so , but I was just curious about what cpu might be the best right now considering that Vista will be 64-bit and..the virtual ocean of cpu options .	St
1.5.2	I am not a 'gamer ' so I wo n't need a top of the line system , but I do have a level of performance that I expect from my pc .	St
1.5.3	Right now I have an athlon64 3200 with 1gig of pc3200 ram and a 128mb agp 8x video card .	St
1.5.4	I would like to experience the next level of performance in the next year or so being as my system is only about 1 year old now .	St
1.5.5	Thanks much for the opinions and recommendations .	St
1.5.6	Ciao , Rocco	St
