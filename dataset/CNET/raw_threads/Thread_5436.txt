On the machine it used 512MB DDR (1 512MB), 400MHz (PC3200). http://www.emachines.com/support/product_support.html?cat=Desktops&subcat=T%20Series&model=T3312 I am going to buy SuperRAM DDR-400, BUT I WILL ONLY HAVE ONE 512MB RAM NOT TWO (Part Number - MPXC22D-38KT3R) http://www.cdrinfo.com/Sections/Reviews/Specific.aspx?ArticleId=15049 After googling I found this as a compatible specs for ram on the T3312. http://www.upgradecomputermemory.com/ram.cfm//memory/E/eMachines/eMachines-Series/eMachines-T-Series/eMachinesT3312/512MB-eMachines-184-pin-PC3200-DDR400-nonECC-DIMM-ABGAEG.html The T3312 ram and SuperRam are both DDR Ram, 400 MHz (PC3200), 184-pin, unbuffed, and non-ECC. The difference is their voltage (T3312 - 2.6v, SuperRam - 2.5v), CAS Latency (T3312 - 3, Superram - 2-2-2-5 / 2.5-3-3-7), and type (T3312 - 184-pin DIMM, SuperRam - 184-pin DDR SDRAM) &lt;I am not sure about the last part&gt; Can I install the SuperRam into this computer?

When it	comes to RAM...I do all possible not to mix brands, speeds, timing or voltages ...I prefer to eliminate as many of the problem possibilities or incompatibilities as I can. VAPCMD

I strongly recommend getting the max you need when you originally buy the system thus avoiding the upgrade and the potential mismatch conundrum. Let us know how it turns out. VAPCMD
