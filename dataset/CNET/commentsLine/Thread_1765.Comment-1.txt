inspiron 1521 amd turion, 1.80 ghz 1918 mb ram vista, home premium zyxel p-330-w router cannon ip4300 printer (on network) ok guys - i've been kicking around here ever since i first got my router back in late '07 - some days i think i'm getting it, and others - like today - i'm lost again.
admittedly, i have more lost days than getting it days.
but i think i can verbalize my current confusion so that ya'll know that i'm a complete 'puter illiterate or i have one of my rare good questions - ok, here's why i'm confused.
if i want to print from my laptop, most days i can do so - however there are days when no matter what i do, i can't get anything to print from the laptop - the network printer has a usb connection to a dell dimension 2400, and there is never a problem printing from that machine.
what i don't understand is on the very best days for laptop printing, my network and sharing center settings on the laptop say that there are no printers installed on that machine - that just don't seem right to me (seems to me that somewhere along the way in my research/learning, i thought i heard that you had to have the newest vista print drivers installed in order for the network printer to function - isn't that a part of installing a printer?).
and yet, the very best functioning for my network printing come when there are no printers installed on my laptop.
i really don't like doing stuff that i don't understand, just because that's the only way it'll work - so i'd sure appreciate it if someone could explain to me why my laptop print function works best when there is no printer installed on the laptop - or if the truth is that i have just not yet discovered how to properly install the network printer on my laptop.
many thanks to all (and i hope this was not a dumb-ass question!).
john
