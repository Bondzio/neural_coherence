i was about 4 years old, and while i can't remember what that first computer was specifically, i am pretty sure it was an ibm.
a couple ???
of years later we got a tandy 1000, and then we had many different upgrades, new(ish) systems and accessory add-ons in the years after that (another approx.
12 or so years while i was still at home with my parents).
