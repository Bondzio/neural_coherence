I haven't a clue as to what to get, the computer specs all read like tech jargon to me. I would like to purchase a computer for my son; he's getting into web design, animation (2D and maybe 3D) and has mentioned video editing as well. What type of computer system should I be looking at? how much memory, what type of memory, what type of video card, processor ???? PLEASE, help! Thank You

To kick up the graphics I went with the 1GB Nvidia GT240 since I didn't have to upgrade the power supply. That card was on sale for 99 bucks. Added Windows 7 from the 3 license pack for Home and I came in with a very nice machine for 569 bucks. It's still running fine. Bob
