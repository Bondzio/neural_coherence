Is this a good deal? Windows Vista OS Intel Celeron D352 CPU 512 DDRII RAM 160GB SATA HDD Slot-in DVD RW Optical

It would of been a different story a few years ago, but with the current technological advances and higher-end multi-core CPUs becoming increasingly cheaper, you might think twice about acquiring a system that is quite inferior to today's standards. But if you intend to stick with XP or use a Linux distribution that utilises low-end hardware, then the PC might get the job done. But if you want Vista, even basic, it will be a constant struggle. And with the ridiculously low amount of RAM, working with multiple apps is going to slow things down a lot. Steven
