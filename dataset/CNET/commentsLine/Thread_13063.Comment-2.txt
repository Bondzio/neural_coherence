to fix this we'll have to create an entirely new communication system.
as it stands you see how the current systems work.
to really fix this we'll have to have 2 radios or more and an entire rewrite done of how ip works.
for now i hope you have your basic grasp of how the ip stack works and we can't leave an open tcp/ip connection and move it from one interface to another.
and your apps will need a complete overhaul as well.
that is, if my app could buffer more than the transition could be less apparent to the user.
in fact, that's how it seems on the kindle fire hd if i can mark a video for play later.
it's buffer is huge.
