1.1.1	I have three PC's with XP Pro.	St
1.1.2	Only one PC correctly recognized a K-Byte 128 mb Thumb drive when connected to USB port.	St
1.1.3	How can I force the other machines to see the drive?	St
1.1.4	Isn't recognized as new hardware and no drivers are needed or available.	St
1.2.1	Widely noted at http://www.usbman.com is the need for the (person!)	St
1.2.2	installer of XP to have: 1.	St
1.2.3	Current BIOS.	St
1.2.4	2.	St
1.2.5	USB in BIOS enabled.	St
1.2.6	3.	St
1.2.7	Motherboard and possibly USB drivers installed.	St
1.2.8	None of these items are performed by Microsoft for most machines and certainly not items 1 and 2.	St
1.2.9	In closing USBMAN notes many issues with some onboard chipsets that can result in mis-identifying an USB device or failure.	St
1.2.10	If you can tell the make/model of the motherboard or chipset, I'd point to more specific USBMAN articles.	St
1.2.11	Bob	St
1.3.1	One of the machines I'm using is a brand new HP with a current BIOS.	St
1.3.2	USB works with every other device I've tried -- card readers, digital cameras, hubs etc.	St
1.3.3	Just no the thumb drive.	St
1.4.1	http://www.usbman.com notes not only the issues I noted that XP Pro without latest updates may have issues with USB 2 devices or ports.	St
1.4.2	Both &quot;USB 2 devices&quot; have issues without SP1 and I've seen issues with USB 2 ports working with USB 1 devices.	St
1.4.3	One workaround was to use an USB 1.1 Hub inbetween.	St
1.4.4	Without you give explicit details on chipsets, SP status of the XP Pro and more, I must leave you to research the USB site.	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	One person found the front USB plugs were non-operational.	St
1.5.2	Some BIOS allow enabling of front/rear seperately.	St
1.5.3	Again, YOU get to check this.	St
1.5.4	Test the device in a port you know works and not just the one that's empty.	St
1.5.5	Bob	St
