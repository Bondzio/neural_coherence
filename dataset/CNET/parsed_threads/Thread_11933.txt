<s> I have three computers, two of them have been networked already using a hub, but aren't connected to the internet. </s>
<s> I also have another computer hooked up to the internet. </s>
<s> If I have a router in between the internet and the non-networked computer, can I connect the hub and the router to connect the other two computers to the intrernet? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> The cable/dsl connection can be shared to all computers by plugging into the router. </s>
<s> Plug all computers into the hub, plug the hub into the router. </s>
<s> Just connect them all to a router. </s>
<s> The two computers that have previously been networked are right next to each other. </s>
<s> The other computer and the internet connection are about 50 feet away. </s>
<s> I probably will go the wireless route at some point, but for right now, I'd like to get something going. </s>
