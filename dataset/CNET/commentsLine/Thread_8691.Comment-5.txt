i tried all the suggestions.
none helped though, but i appreciate the very quick response to my dilemma.
i then contacted hp tech support and after an hour and a half of trying their thoughts they concluded that my driver was fried and believe it or not they shipped me a new drive the next day.
i hope i can help you someday.
thanks again.
