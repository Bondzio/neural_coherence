<s> cuz every benchmark i find has minimum resolution of 1600 x 1400 or something and doesn't show if it's skirmish etc </s>

<s> can u just tell me if it'll run in those condition since i'm planning on ordering computer in like two days just a last minute thing to see if i'd have to drop any quality settings for 8 player skirmish </s>
<s> CoH is intensive, but that hardware can handle it and will give you top tier frame rates. </s>
<s> To host an 8 player skirmish plus play it will overtax just about any machine today. </s>
<s> You'll have to look at splitting the game server and your playing machine up. </s>
<s> How do I know this? </s>
<s> Just from experience on other multiplayer game servers. </s>
<s> The office did the usual lan game thing once in awhile and we found out quickly to split off the server onto it's own machine. </s>
