1.1.1	Just purchased a Lexar USB 2.0 256MB JumpDrive .	St
1.1.2	Anyone know of a password protection program ( FREE would be ok also ) , that can be installed on the USB JumpDrive to proctect data ?	Ques
1.1.3	I want something that can be installed on the JumpDrive itself so there 's no need to install a program on every computer the drive is used on , that would not be a practical option for me .	St
1.2.1	Instead of trying to find a program to 'lock ' the JumpDrive , how about just using a small program to encrypt the data ?	Ques
1.2.2	These programs , that I 'm about to name , are all under 1Mb ( some are Lots !	St
1.2.3	under ) and you can place it on the JumpDrive and use it on whatever computer you need the data decrypted on .	St
1.2.4	All these programs , and their descriptions , I was able to find on NoNags .	St
1.2.5	You can also go to the authors web location for more info and the programs themselves .	St
