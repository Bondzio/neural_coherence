the recovery techniques with failed electronics to switch boards and chips are known to work.
if not, there may be a higher level of failure requiring lab facilties and trained technicians.
i work for actionfront data recovery labs and have seen first hand hard drives with failed electronics and destroyed read/write heads.
some times there is physical media damage possibly created from the end-users attempting to power up the drive.
extensive platter damage usually means all opportunities for recovery are lost.
