...an eight inch personal fan, i have no side panel fitted on one side of the case because i test many configurations and swap out quite a lot.
as to the direction of air flow in an open case i see no difference if the processor fan is reversed, whichever direction the air flows its...air flow.
any moving air is cooler than still air.
i see the point when the case is closed when air needs to be pulled away from the processor but in the open case and personal fan situation like i have reversing the processor air flow makes sense because at the moment the processor fan is fighting against the incoming air flow from the personal fan.
i am also toying with the idea of buying a four inch persoanl fan and suspending it inside the case over the processor heatsink and removing the processor fan.
this i think would be an excellent cooling option.
by the way my processor overheating is set to its lowest 60c and i only get the beeps warning when gaming and turning on the personal fan stops the beeps.
