Hi!
I M very much new to this forum.
I've problem while using DWL 2100 Wireless access point.
I've installed DWL2100 AP installed 1.5 yrs back, it works fine but now I found w lan link down so I checked AP its rebooting continiunly i.e.
power led lite up, but as soon as it detect Ethernet link It restarts.
(It gave same problem before but at that time it was under warranty, but now it out of warranty).
