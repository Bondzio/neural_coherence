I am looking to log on to the internet if I am traveling and not at a Wi-Fi hotspot.
I guess I am confused on the difference between Wi-Fi and wireless internet provided by a phone company like Alltel or Verizon.
If I buy a laptop that says it has 802.11g, is that just good for Wi-Fi at a Starbucks or some other &quot;hotspot&quot;, or will 802.11g also work for providing wireless internet access with a phone provider like Alltel, Verizon, etc?
Maybe I should also ask if 802.11g is a card built into a laptop, and if you must have another type of card for wireless internet service?
