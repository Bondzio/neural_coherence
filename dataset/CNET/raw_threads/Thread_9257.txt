So I figured it was the memory. Uped voltage and made sure ram timings were where they were supposed to be, still BSOD randomly... then I put different memory in from another PC which has been running stable, still BSOD on this machine.. switched the power supply.. no luck. Updated video drivers.. and yet still no luck. all tempuratures are cool.. I have no idea what the problem could be. Is it possible its software related? I installed Steam, WoW, and UT3, first 2 days they ran stable.. should I just reinstall windows with totally different drivers? what could this be? btw, eventlog had some warnings about TCip or something not quite sure, but they were not the same time it BSOD? my motherboard is a BIOSTAR NF61S TE AM2

Be sure to ask the makers, suppliers for support or exchange of any, all parts involved. -&gt; I wonder if this is a home built. If so tell me about the CPU heatsink compound you used and how you knew to up the RAM voltage. Did the BIOS get the setting wrong? How did you know? Bob

I figured it out though, it was service pack 2, I reinstalled windows, this time X64 edition, loaded drivers, been running stable since, did memtest overnight no errors, then prime 95 for 5 hours no probs. thanks
