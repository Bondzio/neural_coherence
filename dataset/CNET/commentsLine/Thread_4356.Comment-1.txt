my dvd burner on my computer is a pioneer dvr-106a.
the fastest for dvd-r's is 4x.
i'm running winxp and using nero to burn it.
i have used generic blank dvd-r's in the past which works very well, but i ran out so i got new ones which are memorex dvd-r 16x.
firmware for the burner has been updated.
when i burn an dvd iso image onto the blank dvd-r, nero does it without errors.
but when i look at the disc that i just burned (through windows/mycomputer/drive), it says it is a cd instead of a dvd and it has 0 free space/0 used space.
my guess is my pioneer burner is too old to work with a 16x (even though i thought a firmware upgrade would have fixed it), but i dont want to throw $100 at a new burner if i dont have to.
can anyone tell me what is wrong?
