1.1.1	Hi , I hope this is in the right section I recently upgraded my AMD socket 939 Mobo from an Athlon 3500 and Radeon X1650pro to a dual core AMD 4200 with a Thermaltake Blue Orb2 fan and Radeon X1950pro .	St
1.1.2	I also installed a fresh copy of my Windows XP Home and it 's fully updated ( this was a few days after I installed the new stuff , hoping it would fix the problem ) .	St
1.1.3	Problem : The old system ran fine , no crashes whatsoever .	St
1.1.4	After I installed the new components and installed the catalyst 7.10 & quot ; driver only & quot ; on the system , it would just randomly crash ( with the old XP ) .	St
1.1.5	Whether is be trying to install software , playing a game , looking at pictures and videos or browsing the net .	St
1.1.6	So I then installed a fresh Windows and the catalyst 8.2 control centre and driver , which is what i 'm using now .	St
1.1.7	It has fixed it to some degree , so I can now play games and install stuff .	St
1.1.8	But on a random website or trying to save a random picture or even watching a youtube video , it will either freeze or the monitor will turn off or it will say & quot ; out of range & quot ; and then restart .	St
1.1.9	It is a clean install of Windows , 2 weeks old .	St
1.1.10	And the BIOS settings are exactly the same as with the X1650 which worked fine .	St
1.1.11	I know it may be a stability issue or a setting I must change in the bios , but I have no idea what the problem actually is .	St
1.1.12	My system is as follows : ASUS A8V deluxe M/B , AGP 8x , socket 939 , bios 1017 ( latest ) AMD Athlon X2 4200+ ATI Radeon X1950pro Windows XP Home SP2 fully updated 750Watt TT PSU I would really appreciate any help .	St
1.1.13	Games fly , but I surf the net just waiting for it to crash .	St
1.1.14	I 'm lucky I could write this message !	St
1.1.15	Thanks PS .	St
1.1.16	I was just about to press submit post and guess what it did ...	St
1.1.17	This time it said & quot ; non-preset mode & quot ; and just froze .	St
1.1.18	Thank goodness for Firefox 's restore	St
1.2.1	Take them out and put them in again .	St
1.2.2	Double check that you put the ram in the right way .	Sug
1.2.3	Do they match ?	Ques
1.2.4	Do you have the right one in the right slot ?	Ques
1.2.5	Run this diagnostics check : http : //oca.microsoft.com/en/windiag.asp The CPU did you install it correctly ?	Ques
1.2.6	Is it the right one for the board ?	Ques
1.2.7	How about the power supply is it big enough ?	Ques
1.2.8	This one is tough to diagnose : http : //www.efficientpowersupplies.org/pages/Generalized_Internal_Power_Supply_Efficiency_Test_Protocol_R5.pdf 500 watts is the upper limit for most systems .	St
1.2.9	Anything more then this is & quot ; over kill & quot ; .	St
1.2.10	If you have a $ 5,000.00+ system this may apply .	St
1.3.1	If you have a $ 5,000.00+ system this may not apply .	St
1.4.1	Thanks for the reply I did n't think about re-seating the RAM and video card , I will try this and let you know what happens .	St
1.4.2	The CPU is in properly and matches the M/B , so that 's fine .	St
1.4.3	I also have 2GB of Geil DDR400 RAM ( 4x512MB ) , I 've had these for over a year now and seem to work fine .	St
1.4.4	The PSU is a ThermalTake 750Watt and is brand new .	St
1.4.5	I 'm beginning to think that the video card may be faulty ... .	St
1.4.6	I hope that 's not the case .	St
1.5.1	I 'd check the RAM thoroughly first .	St
1.5.2	Run a memory test utility .	St
1.5.3	Vista has one within it .	St
1.5.4	There are others as well .	St
1.5.5	Two tests might be advised .	St
1.6.1	I 've been thinking It ca n't be a problem with the memory or GPU because I can play games , listen to music and watch videos for hours without any problems .	St
1.6.2	? / ? -.- Thanks though , I 'll do a memory test soon .	St
1.7.1	oiling the fans is a good idea also .	St
1.7.2	Might be heat .	St
1.7.3	Try this software : http : //www.almico.com/speedfan.php	St
1.8.1	Never thought of that , so thanks .	Polite
1.8.2	The temp is running pretty good , CPU is at 40 to 45 degrees and mobo at 23-27 degrees .	St
1.8.3	The case is an Antec 900 which helps alot .	St
1.8.4	I also changed the resolution colour to 16 bit , down from 32bit and it seems to be working fine , no crashes and I 've been all over the web .	St
1.8.5	So it might be fixed although it now looks pretty average , there might be some colour distortion .	St
1.8.6	I 'm not game enough to go back to 32bit Thanks guys	St
1.9.1	Sorry for the double .	St
1.9.2	I posted the one above and it froze 5 seconds later , lol .	St
1.9.3	I then restarted and tried to change to 32bit colour , hit apply and it froze again .	St
1.9.4	So i 'm either thinking of changing the voltages and see how I go or go back to an earlier catalyst driver .	St
1.10.1	Something its still wrong but you have to live with it .	St
1.10.2	Good luck .	Polite
1.11.1	oil it while your in there .	St
1.11.2	Here 's another tip if you wrap your fan with rubber bands they run quieter .	St
1.11.3	That around the out side of the fan cases not over the top of the fans , most figure that out , most .	St
1.12.1	Run & quot ; dxdiag.exe & quot ; to test your system for porblems .	St
1.13.1	I have run DX Diagnostics and it comes up with no problems .	St
1.13.2	I did change my AGP setting to 4x instead of 8x and it seems to be working ok .	St
1.13.3	I have been on sites that have made it crash without trouble such as youtube .	St
1.13.4	I think I 'll just have to change to 4x mode when I 'm surfing the net for a while and go back to 8x when playing games .	St
1.13.5	Thanks for the help .	St
1.13.6	If changing to 4x does not fix it , then I 'll post here again	St
