well i took the plunge,,,,,,,,,,,,was about to purchase a 5tb Nas drive but opted for a cheaper trial device.............got the seagate goflex 2tb product and have to say thus far NO problems whatsoever....... all my music/movie files are available through any DLNA device that i have connected to my network, happy as can be........................just hope this lasts.......
