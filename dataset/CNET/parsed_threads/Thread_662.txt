<s> I have a Gateway Select 1000 running ME and it locks up continuosly the first 5-10 minutes after startup. </s>
<s> If I let it run for 10 minute and then re-boot or leave it on it works flawlessly. </s>
<s> I've done a complete re-install of Windows ME to make sure it isn't a software problem. </s>
<s> I feel this is hardware problem effected by heat. </s>
<s> Is there a way to check the possibilties without bringing it in? </s>
<s> then it wouldn't get better. </s>
<s> One thing I found about ME. </s>
<s> If you install with less memory, like 64mb. </s>
<s> you get a better install. </s>
<s> then put the rest of the memory back in when your finished. </s>
<s> ME need a lot of ram to run because it has a memory dump issue but, you don't need it all to install it. </s>
<s> You could have a harware issue but, why does it get better after 10 mins.is the question? </s>
<s> doesn't make since either. </s>
<s> Have you cleaned the inside of your case lately? </s>
<s> Maybe the cpu fan is clogged and it takes awhile to get up to speed. </s>
<s> That would make some since. </s>
<s> Give us more details to go on. </s>
<s> Here's a link about the issue. </s>

<s> ME was the precursor to WIN XP home and a few of the features in me should have been left as beta as device drivers written for the other Windows version were not alway friendly to ME. </s>
