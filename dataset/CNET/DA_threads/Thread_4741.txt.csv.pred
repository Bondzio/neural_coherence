1.1.1	Hey , I 'm looking for a burner that wo n't stop working on me .	St
1.1.2	I 've purchased 2 burners that broke down in only a couple of uses .	St
1.1.3	I do n't care about the speed and stuff , I just need recommendations of CD-RW drives .	St
1.1.4	One that can burn hundreds of CDs and not stop burning .	St
1.1.5	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	That is VERY VERY ODD !	St

1.2.3	The case was far too hot .	St
1.2.4	It was cooking the drives .	St
1.2.5	2 .	St
1.2.6	The power supply was fair too out of spec .	St
1.2.7	I 've used from 9 dollar to 30 dollar CDRW drives for years now and they do very well .	St
1.2.8	At this price I 'm very happy as they go past 2 years old .	St
1.2.9	My thought here is that something else is wrong .	St

1.3.1	How do I check if something else is wrong ?	Ques
1.3.2	My first burner was on my old computer - that one was fairly cheap .	St
1.3.3	The other one automatically came on my Alienware computer , so I do n't know how much that one cost .	St
1.3.4	I 've seen searching on the internet on drives for the burner but that has n't worked .	St
1.3.5	Thanks for replying so quick !	St
1.4.1	Windows does n't need such .	St
1.4.2	However you may need software to record onto CDR or CDRW with .	St
1.4.3	I use http : //www.cdburnerxp.se/ a bit .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	I use Ahead Nero .	St
1.5.2	Also my CD-RW is a Lite-ON LTR-48246S	St
1.6.1	http : //www.cdfreaks.com/drive/48 Also , now that you note that drive model , something does not jive with your claims such died in a few months .	St
1.6.2	These models were available in the early 2003 timeframe .	St
1.6.3	This is late 2004 so you may have had this unit for almost 18 months .	St
1.6.4	Given the prices we pay for CDRW drives you may have to pay out 20 to 40 bucks or less every 1 to 2 years .	St
1.6.5	Bob	St
1.7.1	I kind of wondered , based on your hundreds of CDs comment , whether you using the deck for a commercial purpose ?	Ques
