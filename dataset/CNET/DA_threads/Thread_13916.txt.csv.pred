1.1.1	I guess my dreams of a huge LCD is out until I get a new rig .	St
1.1.2	So figured I 'd go with what everyone says it one of the best brands - LG .	St
1.1.3	Anyone know whats the difference between the identically appearing 22 & quot ; models from BestBuy ( L226WTQ-BF ) or the internet ( L226WTY-BF ) ?	Ques
1.1.4	BestBuy Newegg Thanks	St
1.2.1	i ca n't find any info on LG 's website about the L226WTY-BF so it 's probably slightly newer but the BB price on the ... Q-BF is great .	St
1.2.2	both have HDCP ( required for Vista certification ) so you 'll be able to play hi-def copy-protected material on both .	St
1.2.3	if you plan on only using the monitor with your PC ( and never plan on connecting it to a cable/set-top box ) , go with price and get the Q-BF .	St
1.2.4	if you want/need 720p/1080i/1080p ( hi-def TV ) input , then check to see if the ... Y-BF can handle those signals via DVI/component input and decide if the extra functionality is worth the extra $ 50 .	St
1.2.5	also , take a look at the westinghouse LCM-22W3 which is 22 & quot ; and has DIV and component inputs and can handle hi-def TV signals ( often on sale at BB for less than $ 300 ; i 'm very happy with mine ) .	St
1.3.1	Bestbuy regularly orders custom units from manufacturers and lists them with a slightly different model number .	St
1.3.2	I 'm not sure but the cynic in me believes it gives them an out for that famous low price guarantee .	St
1.3.3	These units are often missing a feature or two .	St
1.3.4	So unless you 're into immediate gratification , go with the unit from Newegg .	St
1.4.1	the bestbuy model ( L226WTQ-BF ) is listed on LG 's website .	St
1.4.2	http : //us.lge.com/products/model/detail/computer % 20products_lcd % 20monitors_full % 20line % 20of % 20lcd % 20monitors_L226WTQ-BF.jhtml the newegg model ( L226WTY-BF ) is NOT listed on LG 's website but newegg has a photo of the product sticker .	St
1.4.3	newegg images of LG L226WTY-BF note that the & quot ; product code & quot ; is L226WTY-BF but the & quot ; model no. & quot ; ( under the barcode ) is L226WTQ .	St
1.4.4	so , its them same monitor but has confusing labelling .	St
