<s> Hi, I am a little new to networking, so please be patient with me. </s>
<s> Well, I have a desktop computer running XP pro with 1 ethernet jack which is connected to a DSL modem. </s>
<s> I have a laptop which is running 98 with 1 ethernet jack. </s>
<s> Is there a way I can simultaneously let both computers acess the internet? </s>
<s> If you require any info please, just ask. </s>
<s> Thanx Ibrahim Jadoon </s>
<s> buy a multiport wired/wireless router and attach both PCs to the ethernet ports. </s>
<s> The routers setup guide will explain the details. </s>
<s> Sounds like a Dlink or Linksys &quot;Router&quot; is needed. </s>
<s> That run about 41 bucks. </s>
<s> The product comes with a manual which may be online at linksys.com and dlink.com Bob </s>
<s> Okay, thats what I thought. </s>
<s> But is ther a cheaper way, like something like a ethernet splitter. </s>
<s> But thank You Ibrahim Jadoon </s>
<s> My setup, all D-link: DCM-200 cable modem DI-614+ four port wired/wireless router DFE-530TX+ NICs in three desktops DWL-650 wireless NIC for a laptop Since you already have the modem and NICs in the PCs all you need is the router and cables. </s>
<s> D-link has excellent support both on line and email (don't ask me how I know). </s>
<s> Good luck, Telephony facts, analog/digital explained. </s>
<s> See the CNet faces behind the posts. </s>
<s> I think computer viruses should count as life. </s>
<s> I think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive. </s>
<s> We've created life in our own image. </s>
