my computer was bought in about 2004 and only has 512mb of ram.
it has 2 ports for ram sticks, but im not sure what size to put in to make it faster.
it's a hp725n with a 80gb hdd, and 2 256mb ram sticks.
also, its running xp home.
i'm not sure on the motherboard type, but can anyone make a suggestion based on the age and type of cpu?
