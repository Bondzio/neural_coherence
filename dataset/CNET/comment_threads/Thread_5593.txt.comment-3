Not that worried about the drive itself.
I can replace that.
I need to recover the data if in fact the symptoms are those of a crashed or crashing drive.
Unfortunately I am out of warantee as of last April.
I am hoping that someone else had this misfortune before and can shed some light.
I am trying to open the case and identify the source of the click.
