Hi everyone i need help choosing an antenna, im looking a directional antenna for a project.
So far i found an antenna: http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.37185 But im not sure about the quality of the antenna so im asking you guys.
Also i would like to know how much range i can look at with a 20dBm transmitter and a 36Dbm/4W Amplifier.
(Transmitter -&gt; Amplifier -&gt; Antenna).
Also if someone knows a better alternative it would be great.
Thank you in advance.
