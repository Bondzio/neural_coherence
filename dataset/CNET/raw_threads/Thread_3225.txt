I want to instal a wireless PCI adaptor. It appears that the case is riveted shut. There must be a simple way to open it that is eluding me but idont see the usual screws or anything....

With the case laying on it's side and facing away from you, push in those buttons and open - it opens towards you (the back), the hinges are in the front. If your case design is different from what I've described, I'm just as lost... Good luck!

I would say Gateways have the nicest cases to open, that I have seen. Here is a linky to the directions for opening the little guy. good luck. http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim1100/EN/SM/cvrop.htm#wp1076111

I've even added RAM from underneath the desk, while the operator takes a two minute break. The only tool needed is a flashlight. No unplugging, no screws to lose, just push the button and pop the side cover off. I don't even lay them on their sides.

Use the following link: http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim1100/EN/SM/cvrop.htm#wp1076111 There should be a cover latch on the back of the PC that you slide and hold while sliding the side panel toward the back of the PC.
