The slowness is not uncommon as more devices get on the WiFi and LAN.
Be sure to keep what you can wired and for security have the usual WPA2 AES Personal security and if you can pull it off, schedule the router's WiFi to only work during the hours you use it.
Lastly, is the firmware current in the router?
