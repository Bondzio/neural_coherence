<s> My computer is about 3 years old and this is the first time I'm replacing hardware (this graphics card)... http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814141026 That being said, I've only got a 250W PSU, which is awful. </s>
<s> Can I run this card or will a PSU be necessary... BTW, I don't plan on over-using this computer (I've got a high end laptop I can play games with). </s>
<s> So if a PSU upgrade really isn't necessary, I don't want to buy and install a new one. </s>
<s> Also, if you think i should upgrade can you recommend me a certain Wattage to upgrade to? </s>
<s> And price range? </s>
<s> Maybe a URL link? </s>
<s> Most newer video cards want at least 350W psu, but usually to be dependable get a 400W or even a 500W rated psu to be safe. </s>
<s> Don't buy cheap, you will be unhappy in the long run. </s>
<s> A namebrand will be fine in the 400W range, like Antec or Enermax, etc.., so shop again at NewEgg or other online shop. </s>
