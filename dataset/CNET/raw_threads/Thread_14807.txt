Here's a breakdown. Keeping: Maxtor 120 Gb HDD Samsung 1 Tb HDD WD 500 Gb External HD 4x 512 Mb RAM Sticks (Might upgrade to 4x 1 Gb Ram Sticks) nVidia 6800 GT 256 Mb SoundBlaster Audigy 2 Gamer Case (its light aluminum, with swinging side doors for easy access) Need: New Motherboard New Processor (Thinking Pentium Quadcore) Gonna buy a Blu-ray Drive and DVD-RW Drive I never attempted anything like this, what are the potential problems I will run into? Software, installation etc. Also, I'm not that familiar with mobos, whats a good high end product? Thanks.

(no need to pay extra for things you won't use like dual gigabit lan ports.)
