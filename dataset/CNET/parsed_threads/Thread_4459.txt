<s> Cold boot to operating with XP Pro is less than one minute. </s>
<s> RAID0 may be faster yet (I saw a claim of 19 seconds, but...). </s>

<s> I've used 2 VIA motherboards: Both were crashy, slow, and not worth your money. </s>
<s> But maybe I'm just unlucky.. </s>
<s> But I'd also go with ASUS or DFI... </s>
