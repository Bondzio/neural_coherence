<s> Have a Belkin Play N600 router with Tomato v 1.28 on it. </s>
<s> Both the 2.4 and 5 ghz frequencies often seem to reduce throughput speeds substantially when I use them and then completely disable completely (both bands disable at same time even when I'm using just one). </s>
<s> To get back online, I have to either turn on/off router or manually enable the wireless bands again through a wired connection and the tomato GUI. </s>
<s> What's going on? </s>
<s> Try going back to stock then see if the issue is still there. </s>
<s> Many of the other images overclock the CPU or just have a bug. </s>
<s> When the office see any of those custom images we swap in a stock router. </s>

<s> I'm afraid I'm not computer smart enough to understand a word you just said. </s>
<s> You're saying reinstall the belkin router's original firmware instead of tomato? </s>
<s> What's &quot;other images&quot;? </s>
<s> Folk that install that (these are called images, roms, flash and such) usually are experts at such a thing. </s>
<s> As it stands you have a router that no one could support. </s>
<s> And yes that's what I said. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yes, I didn't install the tomato software onto the router. </s>
<s> I got the router from someone else. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I'll install the belkin firmware back onto it. </s>
<s> It worked. </s>
<s> Things are much better now. </s>
<s> Though sucks I can't get any DDNS services except one that costs money now. </s>
<s> May have to give this router to someone else and get a new one. </s>
<s> That the router hardware is in good to fair shape. </s>
<s> Long ago DDNS was not done on a router so I'm left to guess you wanted it on the router. </s>
<s> But fast forward to today I no longer need DDNS as I solved my need in new ways. </s>
