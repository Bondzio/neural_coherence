The class of machine you are looking at was plagued with far too many issues.
The Athlon core would vaporize in a split second (watch http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCmai6Q9DoM ) and far too many had the BAD CAPS issue.
Unless you can get it all for free it's not a good deal.
It would be a shame to spend one dime and then discover why the machine was stripped and set aside.
If you want something small and nice I'll share I picked up that 350 buck Acer Aspire One.
It's been a hoot.
