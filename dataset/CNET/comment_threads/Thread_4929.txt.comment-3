no.not trying to use it as a laptop.That feature would be limited.
I can still transfer files on the micro-sd,which is ok.If the usb will only recognize certain drives,so be it.I have also tried disabling sd, and enabling only usb.Worse case scenario, i will use the usb drive that it will recognize.I will assume,this device (Tablet),does not recognize external hard drive.
My question should have been be more precise.
Do some tablets recognize external hard drives?
