i have wide experience with both macs and pcs, going back many years.
more people use itunes than any other music syncing program and there is a good reason for that.
it works.
microsoft has published so many software horrors that i am astounded anyone still takes them seriously for anything except windows.
as you mentioned, there is outlook, microsoft activesync, the windows mobile device center, internet explorer and other programs that can be flat out nightmares.
i have spent uncounted hours on the internet trying to find a solution to syncing problems with microsoft products.
now, i am not really a big fan of itunes.
i hate the way apple controls the way you can use their software and hardware products.
but no one can deny that, for their stated purposes, the products work.
bottom line, itunes does a good job with media librarys and is more reliable than most.'
