1.1.1	I have been using an external hard drive as my main storage device and keeping the internal for Vista.	St
1.1.2	Last week the ext.	St
1.1.3	started losing connection to my PC and eventually dropped out completely at the weekend.	St
1.1.4	I've tried updating the drivers, a different USB port and a different USB cable and had no luck.	St
1.1.5	Today I dismantled the ext.	St
1.1.6	case and connected the HDD unit with a SATA cable.	St
1.1.7	When I turn on the PC and go into setup the PC lists SATA 1 IDE WD160 bladdy blah (the internal Vista runs on), SATA 3 IDE WD500 etc.	St
1.1.8	(the ex-external)and SATA 2 which is the DVD-ROM and has nothing to do with anything really.	St
1.1.9	But if I skip the setup stage I get the message 'Primary slave hard disk error'.	St
1.1.10	I know that the old IDE drives could be set as master and slave by changing the jumpers and SATA drives don't have this.	St
1.1.11	But I can't get the second drive to work and really need help.	St
1.1.12	What am I doing wrong?	St
1.2.1	So try this instead.	Sug
1.2.2	Put it in a new enclosure.	St
1.2.3	There is no reason for the internal Sata connection to work.	St
1.2.4	I see no sign that your Vista was installed proper.	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	With the SATA Cable from inside your Computer you will also need the sata power adapter.	St
1.3.2	If you did this please forgive me for asking.	Ques
1.3.3	Question: when you start your PC with it connected does it spinup (can you hear it or feel it?	St
1.3.4	If it does then go to start, All Programs, Administrative Tools,Computer Managment, & select Disk Management.	St
1.3.5	Does your drive apear here?	St
1.3.6	If not the drive is more than likely dead.	St
1.3.7	You can take it to a repair shop, and get their opinion.	St
1.3.8	So time it can be repaired.	St
1.3.9	I use a program called Spinrite.	St
1.3.10	It takes along time but it recovers drives and data that other techs say are dead drives.	St
1.3.11	Hope this helps...	St
1.4.1	like playing Russian roulette with bullets in every cylinder.	St
1.4.2	If the drive is dead you're data is toast.	St
1.4.3	If it's still running, it might work in another HDD enclosure.	St
1.4.4	VAPCMD	St
