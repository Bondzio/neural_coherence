1.1.1	well my new pc came with a brandless PSU , i never leave it on for more than a day , usually around 10 hours max i would turn it off , but i need to download something important and i need to leave it on for possibily long periods of time , something like 30 hours , so my question is : -with the bad psu on my pc , will leaving it on for 30 hours be a bad idea ?	Ques
1.1.2	luckily my pc is n't boiling ... .yet , and i already left it on for 12 hours , however i still need 30 more hours before i can turn it off , and i really do n't want to turn it off unless i have no choice , i do n't want 56k in the first place but broadband require signing a 1 year contract ... . so please , give me some advice , thanks .

1.2.1	least 3 years .	St
1.2.2	Suffice it to say ... I think you 're safe .	St

1.3.1	but surely you have a better psu than me , because mine is just very very bad , i do n't even know where it 's made or its brand .	St
1.4.1	I 'll be blunt , if you know you have a 'bad psu ' then why not replace it at the earliest convience if not sooner .	St
1.4.2	many a generic brand has survived basic demands , just go for one that 's higher wattage .	St

1.5.1	The fact that you do n't know the mfr and where its made is not a reason in and of itself .	St
1.5.2	It might be made in China , but so what .	St
1.5.3	Yes the odds are high that it is not the greatest power supply but as long as it is working , why worry .	St
1.5.4	The 30 hour limit is in your head .	St
1.5.5	The power supply internals have reached its & quot ; stable & quot ; running temperature in ten or so minutes .	St
1.5.6	It may vary a little as the running load on the CPU varies depending on what you are doing .	St
1.5.7	It should stay in that temperature range as long as it is on .	St
1.6.1	I doubt the psu will have a problem with this .	St
1.6.2	If your concerned maybe remove the side cover ... keep things a little cooler ... .doubt that it 's needed .	St
1.6.3	Can you really keep your dial-up connection alive for 30 hrs ?	Ques
1.6.4	That must be some HUGE download .	St
