first, i use laptops.
i don't even own a desktop pc.
second, i just don't have that much data to store.
about the only data i keep are photos.
i burn them to a dvd.
they are much easier to store and use.
i could use an old hard drive as an external drive but i don't even use the portable external hard drive i already have.
