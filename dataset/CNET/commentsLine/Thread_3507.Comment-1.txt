i'm building a pc at the moment, and theres just a few things i need to be schooled on before i turn on that bad boy.
is it possible to run a hdd and a dvd/cd-rom drive configuration through the same eide port given a correct master/slave configuration?
the reason i ask, is because i only have one eide port on my board (evga 680i se).
if you have any additional info, please let me know, cause i would much appreciate it.
