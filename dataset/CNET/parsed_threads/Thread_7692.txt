<s> We have a USB Flash Drive (San Disk 1 GB). </s>
<s> Yesterday it worked fine, but today, after trying from multiple computers (Both PC and MAC), the drive is not recognized. </s>
<s> Furthermore, the USB Drive's light does not turn on, so I suspect there is something wrong with the actual circuitry inside of the drive since it won't even get power. </s>
<s> Is it possible to take the actual memory portion of the drive and get the data off the memory? </s>
<s> I don't think the data is corrupt, just the circuitry inside the drive. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> For 99.99% of those out there you take the drive and put it into the recycle bin and go get a new drive if the old drive can't be formatted. </s>

<s> If this information is important enough to go to this length then you might wish to rethink your back up strategy. </s>
<s> Triple redundancy comes to mind. </s>
