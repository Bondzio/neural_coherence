is when the machine is sata and can't emulate ide.
then when we emulate ide the ide ports can become disabled.
the vicious cycle begins.
my lesson on this is simple.
use an os that supports sata.
yes there are procedures that use a floppy drive but what to do when the floppy drive is broke, missing and the owner won't fix that?
