<s> We are a small office with 5 computers, 4 users, 1 printers, 1 fax, 1 scanner, 1 all-in-one machine. </s>
<s> Sometimes there is a laptop or two added in to the mix. </s>
<s> Currently, we are on a peer-to-peer network with a router. </s>
<s> The system tends to be extremely slow at times. </s>
<s> My question: What are the benefits to going to a server-based network? </s>
<s> Everything I read wants to talk about file and print sharing (we already do), internet sharing (we already do) and similar items that any simple network will accomplish. </s>
<s> What I want to know is if going to a server-based network will make my life easier, in any way, especially if it will speed up my network. </s>
<s> BTW, we have no IT person. </s>
<s> I am drafted because I am the only one who is not afraid to open the box and put the new stuff in or to research these kinds of questions. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for any advice, ideas etc. </s>
<s> If I were you, I would probably try to get the network I already have running as best as possible before I took the plunge into a server based environment. </s>
<s> You did not mention if you are wired, wireless, mixed, what speeds you are operating at, 10Mb, 100Mb, Gb, etc? </s>
<s> You also did not mention what aspects of the network are slow. </s>
<s> Are you experiencing slow file sharing, slow internet, both? </s>
<s> What operating systems are you using? </s>
<s> Do you have a back up (disaster recovery) procedures in place? </s>
<s> I think there are a lot of factors in how and what the network is used for that would determine the benefits of having a dedicated server. </s>
<s> Even in your small environment, a server based solution probably would give you better performance, as servers are optimized to perform things such as file transfers and etc better. </s>
<s> But you would have to consider the cost of the server, cost of the OS, your learning curve, etc. </s>
<s> Besides the performance increase, having a central point for file storage/sharing would make it easier to back up files, apply security settings, and processing print jobs would be better too. </s>
<s> If you are running a slow 10Mb switch, it maybe as simple as upgrading your switch to a faster 100Mb or even GB (although that would probably require you to update the NICs in your PCs as well.) </s>
<s> I'm getting long winded, but I think I would need more information about what you have now, and what you use the network for to give you the best answer. </s>
<s> Perhaps others will have a stronger opinion. </s>
<s> Printing, file access? </s>
<s> It wasn't clear in your post. </s>
<s> While a review of the cable and network &quot;plant&quot; is a good idea (you see that covered in the other reply) the bottom line is one needs to nail down what is slow. </s>
<s> Some may find file browses to be slow but there's a known issue with XP/2000 on that and I can share that if that's the issue. </s>
<s> But until something specific is noted we'll just have to live with our nails, jello, hammer and a wall. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks so much for the information you have provided so far. </s>
<s> Hopefully this answers your questions. </s>
<s> What we have now are the 5 Windows XP professional machines, all 2-5 years old. </s>
<s> I believe the switch is a 10/100 mb switch. </s>
<s> It is not one of the newer, faster ones. </s>
<s> I have recommended changing to those, but my boss is reluctant, thinking that we may need to upgrade to a server. </s>
<s> For background, we are a busy law office. </s>
<s> Main file sharing is to prepare paperwork and we use a calendar, case management program that is also shared. </s>
<s> Obviously, the printer is also shared, as well as internet. </s>
<s> The internet doesn't seem to be slowed much, if any. </s>
<s> Just basically the file and printer sharing. </s>
<s> We back up daily, overwriting the previous weeks backup so that we have 5 days of back ups at any given time. </s>
<s> So far, we back up to a different machine than the files reside on, backing up the files that contain the information, not the programs themselves. </s>
<s> I am not convinced this protects us adequately, but that is for another discussion. </s>
<s> Right now, what I need to figure out is if upgrading to a newer, faster, better switch will be good enough or if we really need a dedicated server. </s>
<s> Cost isn't as much of a factor now that dedicated server costs have gone done considerably. </s>
<s> The biggest factor is streamlining and becoming more productive. </s>
<s> Thanks for your reply. </s>
<s> Some of your questions will be answered in my previous post to the other person who answered my first post. </s>
<s> Slow is basically stopped. </s>
<s> In other words, when someone accesses the case management program residing on my computer, my computer basically stops working while it does it's thing. </s>
<s> It's not a 1 or 2 second stutter, but an actually 1 to 2 minute stop. </s>
<s> It's really annoying. </s>
<s> That is the main problem. </s>
<s> There are other glitches here or there that we could live with, but this one is driving us all crazy. </s>
<s> The case management program is continually accessed by all of us through out the day. </s>
<s> When it stops, we can't even answer questions on the phone or set appointments. </s>
<s> Thanks for your attention to this matter. </s>
<s> That's typical of a almost complete Windows XP install. </s>
<s> Often people don't install motherboard driver packages or don't know to flip the DMA off and on (a nifty XP bug.) </s>
<s> I'm more than patient to wait for full details. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> OK, you totally lost me. </s>
<s> I don't know what DMA is let alone know how to turn it on and off. </s>
<s> As far as a complete XP install, it came installed, and I don't believe I have ever messed with it. </s>
<s> I can give you more complete details tomorrow when I get to work. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> Now before I share the link, I find it amazing that no matter what I write to warn them that this is something we just flip, many will look and not perform the simple flip that does not require a reboot. </s>
<s> I've yet to find kind simple words so I'm approaching the day when I'll don a caveman outfit to point and grunt at it until it's done. </s>
<s> http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/storage/IDE-DMA.mspx The bug is that I find XP to report it's in DMA mode but to be inaccurate about which level. </s>
<s> Fix? </s>
<s> Flip it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Are you saying this will speed up my compter or it's just something I need to do? </s>
<s> Is it something I should do at home as well, where I don't have problems but everyone would like more speed thanks. </s>
<s> Ugg... (pointing at item...) </s>
<s> The Computer is a Dell Optiplex GX270 2.6 GH Pentium 4 Windows XP Professional 5.1.2600 Service pack 2 80 GB hard drive, 44 free. </s>
<s> 256 MB RAM I do realize that the RAM is low, but not sure if it will result in a large boost in speed if I double it. </s>
<s> Not sure what it is expandable to. </s>
<s> Thanks again for all your help. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Points at switch to PIO and back to DMA. </s>
<s> As I wrote before, flip it. </s>
<s> I'll wait. </s>
<s> If you can even find the words so I don't have to ask 3 (or more) times to flip this setting I'd sure appreciate it. </s>

<s> Not sure what it is expandable to.&quot; If you could accomplish the DMA flip, the driver above and get to the more common happy spot of 512M you may see a happy machine. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I have done the flip off flip on thingy you suggested before. </s>
<s> I have installed what you suggested as well. </s>
<s> I have also ordered memory for 512 x 2 (my computer requires 2). </s>
<s> Can I/Should I use the existing 256 in the other two slots to increase the memory even more or just use the 2 new ones? </s>
<s> All of the other computers also only had 256 so I am increasing those to a higher level too, depending on what the computer required (1 or 2). </s>
<s> That brings me back to my original question: Will a dedicated server help us in any way in improved productivity/speed or is it just repeating what we already have? </s>
<s> Thanks so much for all of the advice you have already given. </s>
<s> I have learned a lot. </s>
<s> Or Crucial.com as to the RAM. </s>
<s> I think I supplied a link to the machine but Crucial.com has a configurator that can help. </s>
<s> &quot;That brings me back to my original question: Will a dedicated server help us in any way in improved productivity/speed or is it just repeating what we already have?&quot; It usually helps since the slowdown isn't noted by the user that has to serve it up. </s>
<s> Did the flipflop to PIO then back to DMA and latest drivers give any relief? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It did help, but it's still not the best scenario. </s>
<s> I should have the ram in a few days. </s>
<s> I ordered it directly from Dell, what they recommended for the specific machine. </s>
<s> Cost wasn't bad so I just went with them. </s>
<s> Thanks for all your help. </s>
