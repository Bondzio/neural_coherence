Cooling is fine.
Prescott Celeron D goes as low as 36c degrees.
So I'm good now.
But in order to keep it at that I to have turn all the fans at full blast and its very noisy and not to mention cold.
But lower watts means less power and less heat.
And I can put all my fans on low as soon I get the other cpu ands switch.
Won't be as noisy.
And computer won't need to work so hard to cool.
