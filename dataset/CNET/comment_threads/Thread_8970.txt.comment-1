Hi, everyone i have philips 107e 17&quot; CRT monitor, and below monitor is bass speaker.Is it bad for my monitor because i listen pretty loudly music, and when i volume up speakers i see some lines on screen.And, yes my monitor picture is shaking.Could it because bass is draving power from sistem or it is just electromagnetic field??
Thanx,Fema
