It will come to a screen that indicates that there is no OS installed. When you try to run the recovery system it shuts itself down. I have tried replacing the HDD according to the hp support site and as soon as the system attempts to access the HDD all it will do is shut itself off. Any other suggestions?

If you know: Is anything overclocked? Probably not, just checking. Is there anyway to check if the first HDD works in another comp? If you don't: Visit your local comp shop: If they are nice enough, they'll test your HDD in another PC for free. Power supply dying? Is it under warranty? Try calling HP for help. ~Ibrahim~

I've been in HP.com trying to find a new motherboard, but cannot locate an exact match; Micro-Star International, Gamila/Giovani/Neon series030. Serial Number: 4811472490 Bios: Award Software 3.25 04/12/2005 HP Part Number : P8557-69002. I got this number from the HP website, but they said - Not Available.

I would suggest using a vaccume cleaner to clear all the dust and perhaps a Q-Tip to clean those fan blades. If the system says no OS was found you might want to remove the floppy disk that's in the floppy drive, it usually has no operating system.
