i have the pixama pro 9000. it works great!
i am in the invitation business and it works on card stock.
it is a direct feed.
i have had not problems except on metallics!
it prints on them fine, where the ink jet wont't, but it will smear if it gets damp.
i am looking for a dircet feed laser for the metallics....any suggestions??
?
