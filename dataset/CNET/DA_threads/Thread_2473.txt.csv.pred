1.1.1	I'm looking into purchasing a mainstream type printer for basic text documents as well as the occational colored documents.	St
1.1.2	I'm not looking into a printer that can feed out detailed pictures but if the price was right, I wouldn't mind a high end result.	St
1.1.3	My budget is roughly $150CDN MAX and I've been looking at the HP Deskjet 3845, 3620 (very similar or so it seems), HP OJ5510 4-in-1, Lexmark P6250 3-in-1, HP PSC 1610 3-in-1 and Brother MFC420CN 6-in-1 (Brother; a company I know little about).	St
1.1.4	Which of these, or any others I have not mensioned, is a the best reliable machine I can buy within my budget.	St
1.1.5	As well, which make has the least expensive ink replacements?	St
1.1.6	I am leaning towards HP or Lexmark because I am not sure about Brother (i've only seen commercials on television).	St
1.1.7	Most of these also have scanners.	St
1.1.8	How are scanner/printer-in-1 combinations?	St
1.1.9	The scanner is okay?	St
1.1.10	I'm thinking I might as well get one that has a scanner as it will come in handy in the future.	St
1.1.11	Thanks in Advance - Mo	St
1.2.1	I would receommend HP based upon my past experience.	St
1.2.2	The all in one printers are a compromise at all that they do and if one function breaks your whole machine is down for repair.	St
1.3.1	Do you recommend me getting the printer only models appose to the ones with scanners/fax built in?	St
1.3.2	How is each function a compromise?	St
1.3.3	The printer will not be of the same quality on the all-in-one compared to the regular printer?	St
1.4.1	Depending upon the individual model, the all in one may or may not have as good a printer, but there are compatability issues with all in ones.	St
1.4.2	You can do a pretty good job of faxing with a flatbed scanner and printer, so I would go with that choixce rather than the all in one.	St
1.5.1	Isn't that the all-in-one with fax/scanner/copier/printer?	St
1.5.2	Or are you saying getting a scanner/fax and a printer seperately?	St
1.6.1	A flatbed scanner is a stand alone scanner.	St
1.6.2	Unless you do a high volume of faxes I would get a printer and a stand alone scanner.	St
1.6.3	If you need color, get an ink jet printer.	St
1.6.4	If not, get a Laser.	St
1.6.5	Laser toner will last a long time compared to ink jet cartridges.	St
1.7.1	Laser printers do not support colored documents?	St
1.7.2	I need a crisp text output as well as decent colored images.	St
1.7.3	PPM is not a big issue but what does the dpi have to do with?	St
1.7.4	These mostly had 4800 dpi resolution.	St
1.8.1	Color lasers are available, but for about 20 times your budget.	St
1.9.1	Any HP printer that I have listed?	St
1.9.2	(Without scanner because you said compatibility issues)	St
1.10.1	NIL	St
1.11.1	NIL	St
