<s> After fixing a hardware issue in my computer, I was in the process of copying files from my D: drive to my C: drive and the computer spontaneously restarted. </s>
<s> It would not boot back into windows and I ended up installing/booting from my D: drive. </s>
<s> Back in windows, I discovered that my old primary HDD did not have any readings inside windows (disk size was 0 bytes), and when I try to browse the drive, it says it is not formatted. </s>

<s> You would have to send it to a commercial data-recovery company, and that is not cheap, so only do so if the data is very valuable. </s>
<s> Since your boot drive was the SATA drive, perhaps your bios settings were altered when it rebooted? </s>
<s> Have you checked there to see if the drive is still set to boot from? </s>
<s> I would start there, and then see if you can get access to it for any files that might be on it still. </s>
<s> Don't forget that you also need to install the SATA drivers (or at least the instructions for it) from a floppy disk by pressing the F6 key during the initial Windows XP install window....it will ask for the disk a little later in the installation and not immediately, so if you need to reinstall XP to that SATA drive look for that. </s>
<s> There are options also available to either install XP to the SATA drive or do a repair which will let you install XP over the top of itself and leave your other files intact that are still there so if there's a chance of doing this, you might still be OK. </s>
<s> There are some recovery tools that are freeware and shareway here: Make sure you check to see which ones work with XP as some don't. </s>
