lets see... deap breath here.. lol.... 1) even tho pc's are as dumb as a mud fence, the ms people have taken care of just bout everything so u have very little to think about.
2) we need to make sure of the type of hd you have.
look at the back of the new hd.
on the left, is there a long line of pins or a couple of sets of short slots.
if its short slots we dont have to do anything to make sure which is which.
3) we are removeing the fear factor here !!...
a) turn off the pc.
connect the new drive.
insert the xp cd.
turn on the pc.
load xp.
when it asks about partitions - yes - make part 1 - c: 20g.
partition 2 - whatever is left (it will probably show up as default) - then let xp do its install thing.
setup ur internet connection.
get back to me.
heres best part.
any problems - turn off pc - swap hd's - and you are back to where u are now - nothing lost.
we will go on from there - hopefully with new drive in tackt lol lol.
ted :-))
