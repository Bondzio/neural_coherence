<s> Hello: When I looked at all reviews of monitors, and I then looked at all manufacturers, I noticed that there were no reviews of iiyama monitors (I have three). </s>
<s> I know that they have no big footprint in the USA, but still, I believe they are quite a big manufacturer. </s>
<s> How come they are not included among the many, many manufacturers on the cNet list? </s>
<s> Would anyone know? </s>
<s> Thanks, Hans L </s>
<s> They didn't make a deal with the big stores or sites like Tiger, Newegg, amazon or others. </s>
<s> As to Cnet, they would have to arrange for product to get reviewed and many makers don't do that. </s>

<s> Okay, Bob, I do understand. </s>
<s> Thanks, Hans L </s>
