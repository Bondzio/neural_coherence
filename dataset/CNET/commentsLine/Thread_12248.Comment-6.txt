a motherboard supporting pcexpress with a video card that pushed your finances in combination with dual channel ram would hedge you for the future as well as a performance demon...... take a look at amd systems at www.gogocomputers.com in the $899.
range to give you an idea.... the video card could be improved to the nvidia 6800 series and the hard drive could be changed to a hitachi for improve hard drive response..... thats what i would do hands down.... i was skeptical of hitachi harddrives until i bought a 160 gig unit 7k250 deskstar not expensive but performance dripping... maybe investigate further .... system startups and file transfers were reduced in regards to time .... you may ask what do i reference this to?
maxtor, western digital, quantum, fugitsu and seagate used on my family system building..... do the research with the net ... google it , use tomshardwarecorner, etc.
hope this is of help .....
