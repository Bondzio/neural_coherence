632	0	172068	1899007	NR	rhsmith	4/25/06 7:20 PM	1.1459928E12	Hard Drives	I have an MSI KT6V Mainboard with 1GB Ram. The MB has two Serial ATA 133 connectors and two IDE connectors. My original configuration had two 120 GB SATA Hard Drives. I upgraded my C Drive (operating system) to a 250 GB Hitachi SATA. (The other 120 MG disk is used for backup.) I now have an extra 120 GB drive which I would like to use for additional backup. But with only 2 SATA connectors on the MB it looks like I am stuck. Is there such thing as a SATA &quot;Y&quot; cable? Can I use my SATA drive through an IDE connector on the mother board? Is there a coversion cable IDE-SATA? Are any Bios changes needed? Both my current SATA drives have NTFS formats, each with a single partition.

PROBLEM: 3 SATA HD and only 2 SATA ports. SOLUTION #1: Attach 3rd SATA HD to an IDE port with adapter. http://www.newegg.com/product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16812156011&CMP=OTC-Froogle&ATT=SABRENT+SBT-STDB+IDE+Ultra+ATA-100/133+to+Serial+ATA+Port+Mini+Converter Careful: don't get a SATA to IDE adapter; get IDE to SATA SOLUTION #2: Add a SATA HDD controller card to a PCI slot. Some models are less expensive than solution #1
