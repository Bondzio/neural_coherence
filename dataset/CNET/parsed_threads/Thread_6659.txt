<s> Trying to re-establish wireless peer-to-peer with desktop and laptop. </s>
<s> Computers were in storage several months. </s>
<s> Can get both to see each other with net diag, but cannot ping each other, and client cannot, of course, access internet. </s>
<s> (cable modem). </s>
<s> Have tried ICS in all its forms, even Sygate cannot improve things. </s>
<s> Cards are seeing each other and associating with other. </s>
<s> What else can I try? </s>
<s> Using Windows 98SE on desktop and ME on laptop, USR wireless cards in both. </s>
<s> Was working fine before my recent move </s>
<s> Are both cards set to ad-hoc mode? </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> Actually, the newer configuration utility offers peer-to-peer rather than ad hoc as a choice, but I assumed that was the same as ad hoc. </s>
<s> The same utility clearly shows them associated with each other. </s>
<s> The puzzle remains. </s>
