Hi, Firstly, I dont know a great deal about wireless !
I have a Netgear MR814 v 3 Router, my sones PC and partners lap top see the connection and signal strengh is good.
Though they are sending packets none are being recived.
I really do now know what I need to do, this is driving me mad....as such I would appreciate any help or guidance.
Many thanks
