I have setup my netgear wifi router and I can access it with my computer.
But what do I need to do to get it working with my second computer.
On my second computer I have already installed the wifi adapter and it is working as it sends packets but dosent recieve any.
Do I need to install any isp software.
I checked my tcp/ip setings and are ok.
I dont know if I have to do anything else..
