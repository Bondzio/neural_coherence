Something I forgot.
I had to recently replace the CPU Fan, I also bought the Maxtor Hard drive as the WD80 was showing a permanet blue screen and installed XP home as my XP Pro wouldnt install, the machine then repaired the fault and I disconnected the new Maxtor 6Y120.
It doesnt make a difference whether both hard drives are connected or the main WD80.
