Not hard but I tried to do it without reading the instructions and it doesn't work unless I followed the directions. I've gone the bluetooth route and it was a dud. Talk about slow... Minutes per page... Bob

I also try to let you do a little work since it's your issues to be solved. Such as I'll let you find the Linksys wifi print server and read up on how it connects. Bob

You plug the printer to the print server and in turn the printer server will communicate to the router wirelessly. Each computer that will use the print server will need the device driver installed and you or somebody of your choosing can install the device drivers (the instructions that each component needs in order for each to talk to each other). Those device drivers are supplied in the box with the print server that you purchased. As the previous poster said, follow the manufacturers instructions and don't skip or &quot;think&quot; you know more than they. Good luck.
