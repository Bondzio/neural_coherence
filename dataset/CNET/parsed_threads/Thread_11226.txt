<s> Hi all, I've transplanted a few CPUs and motherboards in my day... but now I've bought all the components to build my own system from scratch. </s>
<s> I've got and Athlon 64 3700+, a quality heatsink and some leftover Artic Silver 5. </s>
<s> I've noticed that the Artic Silver site ( http://www.arcticsilver.com/arctic_silver_instructions.htm ) when referring to the AMD 64's, it says that it's ''more important'' to cover the CPU core rather than the whole heat spreader from corner to corner. </s>
<s> I've always had very good luck spreading a super thin layer on a processors core in the past... should I really not apply a thin layer to the entire heat spreader? </s>
<s> Is it a bad idea in general, or simply a waste of compound? </s>
<s> If I follow the instructions and simply apply a drop (3/4 size of a bb) to the center of the heat spreader, I'll never see exactly how well the compund was spread when I applied the heatsink, which makes me uncomfortable. </s>
<s> Am I being silly? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> that they did NOT say to not cover the entire heat spreader. </s>
<s> Seems that they want you to know that the CPU chip itself is only about 1 sq inch and thus is only a small portion of the heat spreader. </s>
<s> Seems that they simply want you to know that you MUST get the compound on the specific area where the CPU die contacts the heat spreader. </s>
<s> If I remember correctly the CPU chip is not exactly in the center of the heat spreader. </s>
<s> Thus if you get a nice uniform spread of the compound on most of the spreader you will include the most critical area. </s>
<s> I think the logic is that with Artic Silver 5, they don't want you to &quot;pre-spread&quot; the stuff at all. </s>
<s> This seemed surprising to me at the time. </s>
<s> It's consistency dictates that you add the rice-sized drop and allow the application of the heatsink to do the work for you. </s>
<s> I e-mailed Artic Silver and they said that using this method eliminates &quot;air gaps&quot;... and that if you &quot;pre-spread&quot; the compound before appyling you would most likely have air gaps. </s>
<s> Off I go! </s>
<s> Cheers. </s>
