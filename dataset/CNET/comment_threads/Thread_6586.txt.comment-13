I had a laptop hdd I was using in my old PC that would do this or lose the bootstrap from time to time, that drive failed about a month after I upgraded.
I never found out why it did this but it only lasted 4 months, occuring more frequently as time passed, then no more HDD.
HDDs really should be replaced as soon as errors appear as their engineering doesn't leave much time between the first error and a failure that will stop you retrieving your data.
