<s> I currently have AT&T DSL service, and I am using a Linksys WRT54G as my wireless networking solution. </s>
<s> I also have a second WRT54G wireless router that I would like to add to my network. </s>
<s> I would like to use the secondary unit as a wireless accesspoint on the other side of my house, so that I can connect various wired ethernet devices through one switch without running a cable across the house. </s>
<s> So how would I configure the second router to be a wireless switch or accesspoint? </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> That's not called a WAP to start with. </s>
<s> That would be called an extender or repeater. </s>
<s> It already can be a WAP but you want it sans wire. </s>
<s> Some models have a feature of being a repeater but not this one. </s>
<s> Plus I often find the repeaters at the far end of the house when the PC is. </s>
<s> That does not work either. </s>
<s> The repeater sits about half way to the other PC... Bob </s>
