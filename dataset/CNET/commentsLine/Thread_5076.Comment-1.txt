i was trying to install a new hard disk in addition to the existing one.
seagate sata.
the win xp disk management recognized the hardware.
but when i tried to create a primary partion the system works for some time and comes with an alert &quot;error in making partion&quot; or something similar.
then when i go back to disk management the new hard disk is no longer there.
the same thing happens when i use easues partion manager.
it works for a long time and comes with an error message.
then the hard disk is longer recognized by the software.
please help.
thank you.
