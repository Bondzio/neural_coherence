I see little hope for waking you up.
Most of the Symbios SCSI cards I've seen in over 10 years were discount affairs and some never found support in today's operating systems.
Your post didn't supply make and model numbers so I can't wake you up from the nightmare.
Best of luck, maybe it's just jumpers or termination?
