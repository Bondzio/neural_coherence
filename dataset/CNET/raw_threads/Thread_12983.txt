I'm a very happy new user to the Hauppauge HD PVR ( http://www.hauppauge.com/site/products/data_hdpvr.html )... as I can now, finally make my own HD movie libraries of my Premium HD Content ! The captured files are in the AVCHD format...and can be played back on my PS3, burn to DVD (in AVCHD format) for playback on Blueray players. Hauppauge has been able to accomplish what DirectTV, Dish and all the Cable providers have not... bridging Premium content with the PC world. Thx Hauppauge ! -Rivertrance.

If/when certain entities want to infringe on consumers 'fair use'... their DRM mechanisms can be honored. Looks like Hauppauge is ready to play ball for the long-haul
