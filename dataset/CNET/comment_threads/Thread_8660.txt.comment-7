proposed new as well as upgrade configs where the CPU doesn't go with the MB and more often where the RAM is DDR2 and MB only accepts DDR3.
Also see a fair number of instances where the PSU doesn't support the HW identified or if it worked...it wouldn't have lasted long.
Wonder how the poster's build went ?
