i have a second hand computer that has the following come up in the boot up: ''serial presence detect (spd) device data missing or inconclusive''.
this seems to be an intermittent problem as occasionally it boots up to windows xp no problems.
i had replaced the hard drive when it initially happened but is still occurring.
i'm guessing it's a hardware problem as it seems to happen if the computer is moved or bumped.
the computer has an intel inside pentium iii motherboard, 866 mhz and 256 mg ram.
could anyone please tell me where to check to see if i can fix this?
thanks.
