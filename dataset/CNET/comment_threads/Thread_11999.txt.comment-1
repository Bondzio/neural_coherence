I'm looking to upgrade the amount of RAM I have in my system, but have run into a few technical things which I'm unsure of.
Information was collected from EVEREST Current RAM: DDR SDRAM DDR-333 256mb Unbuffered PC2700 (166MHz) DIMM CL2.5 I want to upgrade to 1GB, with either 1x1gb or 2x512mb.
My motherboard only has 2 DDR DIMM RAM slots, so is it better to use 1x1gb incase I want to upgrade again in future?
are there any disadvantages to only have a 1gb stick?
I've been searching around for PC2700 for the last few days, and just noticed that everest says it supports other types: Supported RAM: DDR-266 SDRAM, DDR-333 SDRAM, DDR-400 SDRAM Since DDR-400 is supported, does that mean I can use PC3200 ram instead of 2700 and have no problems?
I'd rather buy the faster sticks if they'll work.
These are the PC3200 I've been looking at: http://www.savastore.com/productinfo/product.aspx?catalog_name=Savastore&product_id=10279841&pid=44&rstrat=0 http://www.savastore.com/productinfo/product.aspx?catalog_name=Savastore&product_id=10279842&pid=44&rstrat=0 http://www.microdirect.co.uk/ProductInfo.aspx?ProductID=6691&GroupID=1116 Are they any good and will they be supported okay?
My price range is 50-100, so if anyone has other good places to look can they post them (will need to be a uk site).
One of those sticks also says CL3.0, what's the difference between 3.0 and 2.5?
