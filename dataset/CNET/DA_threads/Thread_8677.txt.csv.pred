1.1.1	I brought back a stick of 256MB PC133 SDRAM to Future Shop for an exchange ( since my motherboard was n't detecting it and the AzenRAM website stated it should ) .	St
1.1.2	Upon returning it , there were two girls there .	St
1.1.3	I told them it was defective .	St
1.1.4	One of them said : & quot ; It probably got scanned by a barcode scanner .	St
1.1.5	They make these things defective. & quot ; The other said that was n't true but the girl seemed pretty sure about it .	St
1.1.6	Now I do n't know what kind of merit this has , but I was wondering since it would explain why I 've gotten two different sticks of AzenRAM that do n't work .	St
1.1.7	( The second one was scanned despite the other girl 's warning . )	St
1.1.8	So I do n't know .	St
1.1.9	What do you guys think ?	Ques
1.1.10	Is the barcode scanner really messing up the RAM ?	Ques
1.2.1	My thinking is ... BULL .	St
