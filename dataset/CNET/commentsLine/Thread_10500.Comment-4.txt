&quot;virtual surround sound technology converts stereo sound sources to multi-channel format&quot; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ isn't &quot;virtual&quot; another way of saying, &quot;simulated&quot;?
well, getting 5.1 out of 2.0 isn't all that hard, just get one of those better audio cards.
now, you'll know why they're more expensive.
better cards handle the demands but its included s/w makes it all the better, so review what comes with the card.
if getting into audiophile features, be sure your cpu is capable as tasks get demanding as well as ram issues.
multiple core cpus do fine as well as ample ram.
sorry, not a audio guy but specs sheets pretty much details what you're getting.
