thanks bob--i'll give the worm scan a try.
i've already used chkdsk quite a few times, and although i think it works initially, the problem always seems to come back, or it's not being fixed at all by chkdsk.
i even tried re-installing xp, and uninstalling, then re-installing my firewall software (zonealarm pro).
that's what made me think of a failing hard disk.
do you think that may be possible?
thanx, scott
