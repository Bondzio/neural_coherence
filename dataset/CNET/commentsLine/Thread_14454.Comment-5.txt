yeah, with your comment, you save my print!?!!!
anyway, if everybody stay conservative with windows 98,won't be any progress in the future!it's the price to pay when you want improvment,and there is always a small (i hope) phase where the chaos is taking place...but in 6 month,everythings will run smooth, i'm pretty sure!
by the way i found a thread by epson, the drivers will be released,during march fpr the r800,for some other products should be now already on download-site...yeah i have to wait a little bit...but that's life... viva vista!
cheers
