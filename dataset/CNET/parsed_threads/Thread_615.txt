<s> I'm trying to install this pci card on my work laptop so I can use it at home. </s>
<s> We have this &quot;Cisco security agent&quot; that won't let me run the executible file ( http://www.usr.com/support/product-template.asp?prod=5411 ) I know my company doesn't support this type of arrangement but I know so many people who use it. </s>
<s> Is there any way around this? </s>
<s> Is there a way I can trick the card to work without running this .exe file? </s>
<s> It's a bad idea to go around the IT staff. </s>
<s> It can come back later to haunt you. </s>
