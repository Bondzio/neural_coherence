&quot;BIOS (as per original, not updated)&quot; I know to update it as I get hardware to sidestep issues like these.
There is another possible issue here, but I can't tell in your posts.
You may have tried to install XP onto a SATA drive without supplying drivers along the way.
This rarely works.
The motherboard manual should detail what's needed.
