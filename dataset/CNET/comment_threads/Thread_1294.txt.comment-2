If your toys can connect wirelessly to the router your new computer should -- most new laptops come with wireless as standard.
Suggest you read the router manual and have a look at the networking setup in Windows on the laptop and make sure the laptop's wireless switch (usually on the side of the case) is in the ON position.
If Vista it should be pretty simple to connect.
