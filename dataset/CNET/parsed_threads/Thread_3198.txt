<s> Hi, I know what Tv tuner and graphics card do, but that's about all. </s>
<s> I would like to use my computer (Dell 5150, has a couple of PCI slots) to watch and record TV from cable and also HDTV droadcasts from the air. </s>
<s> Can you recommend a card - I know there are huge quality differences. </s>
<s> Specifiallly, will I get better value if I buy TV tuner and graphics cards separately or will there be problems (such that the TV tuner card wont utilize the graphics card but will use the main processor)? </s>
<s> ALso is there any freesoftware you can recomend for viewing and recording TV prgrams. </s>
<s> Thanks a lot! </s>
<s> Jonni </s>
<s> I've yet to see any from ATI to Hauppaugge in NTSC recordings. </s>
<s> HD recording is a contentious area with the HD providers not wanting such recorded and the hardware makers wanting to provide recording capability. </s>
<s> You may find recording HD limited to a lower quality and this is not driven by make/model. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> First thing to avoid initially is 3rd party software. </s>
<s> You're far better sticking to the provided software that works with the hardware. </s>
<s> Once you get the hang of that, or find it has limitations (who knows, it might well be perfect), you can look at other software. </s>
<s> As far as value and which is best : The all in one combo card often tends to be more problematic and complex software to install, as it's a single device doing hugely complex stuff, however it's a single device, so it tends to be slightly cheaper than two seperate cards. </s>
<s> The obvious downside is when you come to upgrade. </s>
<s> Just say you wanted faster graphics, but were quite happy with TV options? </s>
<s> Both still have to go. </s>
<s> I also doubt for $120, you could get any combo card with HDTV capability. </s>
<s> This is the strength of two cards. </s>
<s> Each can be changed, upgraded, or altered individually. </s>
<s> It's a more flexible option, if not cheaper, and you can find loads of TV cards for around $120 some even have HDTV support! </s>
<s> You also have two cards to setup, which often means less of a gordian knot to install. </s>
<s> Now onto the problems. </s>
<s> You mention ''...such that the TV tuner card wont utilize the graphics card but will use the main processor'', but that is the usual way it's done. </s>
<s> TV/tuners do not utilise the graphics card to any great degree, as basically the TV/video picture is overlaid onto a blue screen the graphics card shows (it's not doing much at all in other words), and the CPU does the rest. </s>
<s> However, the more expensive cards do tend to have video hardware acceleration built in (nothing to do with the 2D/3D graphics card speed), which offloads part of the CPU drain for both watching, and especially when you begin to capture video. </s>
<s> The reason is that video capture is without a doubt the most strenuous thing a computer can do, especially High Definition. </s>
<s> CPU use cranks up, Hard Disks spin full speed trying to store huge gigabyte chunks of video and audio data. </s>
<s> It's a massive strain. </s>
<s> So it's best to look at TV cards which feature Hardware accelerated video input, and dedicated MPEG support for digital TV, and video capture. </s>
<s> Without these, the CPU has to work very hard, and HDTV support will need some hefty hardware acceleration by default, no matter what CPU you use! </s>
<s> As far as makes : Hauppauge Terratec Leadtek (i'm using 2 now) Pinnacle AverMedia ATI (I've had 3 All In Wonder's in the past) All make well reviewed TV input cards. </s>
<s> Try specialised websites such as : http://www.tv-cards.com/ http://www.videohelp.com/ http://dvr.about.com/ For more. </s>
<s> Good luck, GeeBee </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> W/o you pointing out I would not have relized that having separate TV tuner and video card is great if I ever need to upgrade only one. </s>
<s> Thanks also for the list of recommended brands and links. </s>
<s> Based on looking around at dealnews I found the following items that I ma thinking of buying: 1. </s>
<s> VisionTek XTASY Radeon 9250 256MB PCI Video Card (down to $40 at circuitc. </s>
<s> after rebates)It seems to have some decoding support for video (MPEG2 etc) and has a DVI outlet so I can take advantage of my digital monitor 2.a Hauppauge WinTV-USB2 USB 2.0 TV Tuner (down to $40 at circuitc. </s>
<s> after rebates) . </s>
<s> But I don't know if USB is harder for the CPU? </s>
<s> OR 2.b Hauppauge WinTV-PVR-150MCE PCI TV Card (65) OR 2.c K-World USB ATSC HDTV Tuner Box - KW-ATSC-310 (for $50 at buy.com) again, I don't know if there is a down side to using USB port, but atleast I would have more PCI slots free if I need to get a better sound card than the integrated 7.1 Ihave to support the HDTV card. </s>
<s> Also, I don't know about this brand Would be great to get any suggestions/comments (from anyone) Thanks alot! </s>
<s> I read your last reply and didn't see any HDTV card. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It's K-World USB ATSC HDTV Tuner Box. </s>
<s> Please let me know if I am mistaken and that doesn't do the same job as a HDTV card. </s>
<s> While K world is not a big name I've used their video capture cards (8 port) and find their software to not be polished. </s>
<s> It works but you may or may not find it to be as polished as you would like. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> These are snapstream's list of compatible high-def tuner cards: http://www.snapstream.com/products/beyondtv/hdtv-setup-center.asp#tunercard HDTV Tuner Card It is important to get an compatible HDTV/Digital ATSC tuner card. </s>
<s> To capture high-definition content with Beyond TV, your TV tuner card needs to support BDA drivers. </s>
<s> Ask your manufacturer if you are unsure if your card does. </s>
<s> Most BDA-compliant cards will work with Beyond TV. </s>
<s> We suggest the following HDTV tuner cards for use with Beyond TV: ADSTech InstantHDTV PCI ATI HDTV Wonder AverMedia AVerTVHD MCE A180 Dvico FusionHDTV3 Gold Dvico FusionHDTV5 Lite Dvico FusionHDTV5 Gold Plus Dvico FusionHDTV5 Gold USB Kworld ATSC-110 VBox Cat's Eye DTA-151 VBox Cat's Eye USB-A 3560 MyHD MDP-130 is a new card that seems to be generating some interest and is compatible with XP MCE and Snapstream. </s>
<s> Visit http://www.avsforum.com/ since that's a great place for posts on HDTV topics. </s>
<s> To confirm what others have said above, work on the two devices separately. </s>
<s> In fact, I don't think there are any all-in-one cards which support HD at present. </s>
<s> Having recently gone through the home theater PC setup myself, I would suggest shopping for the PVR software first. </s>
<s> The free apps and those bundled with tuner cards are quite often lacking in features, so consider ease-of-use and other measures; after all, this is the piece which will be most visible. </s>
<s> The solution which worked for me was the KWorld ATSC-110 (about $99) - it came with an SE version of Snapstream Beyond TV, which I upgraded to a full version (lifetime guide, etc.) </s>
<s> for another $50. </s>
<s> This combination didn't require any heavy-duty video cards, just DirectX 9.0c compatibility. </s>
<s> You need at least a 1.7 GHz processor and *lots* of disk space - recorded HD consumes over 8GB/hr. </s>
<s> I really like the BTV app - it has a seamless guide for both broadcast and cable/satellite, and can be set up to tune the cable/sat receiver via IR or serial cable (depending on the device). </s>
<s> Everything can be done with the mouse (wireless optical is the way to go), which is even easier than a remote (although that is supported, too). </s>
<s> If you wanted to add a second tuner in the future (i.e. </s>
<s> to record two shows at once, or watch one show and record another), BTV can handle this. </s>
<s> You may have to be more selective about the tuner card, however, since only those with hardware MPEG-2 encoding are officially supported. </s>
<s> I might try this myself, but would need to confirm if the KWorld card meets this spec. </s>

<s> Good luck! </s>
