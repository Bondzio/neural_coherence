<s> I have a hp 550 laptop, been having some issues with the DVD compact disc drive. </s>
<s> &gt; it does not open when i push the button, but opens when i use a paper clip &gt; the light that is suppose to show up on the disc is not on at all &gt;the laptop recognizes the disc drive, but when i try to eject from my computer it gives an error &gt; when i do open it an place a disc in it, it does not read it at all. </s>
<s> can anyone help me please </s>
<s> If this is out of warranty consider removing the drive and slipping back in hopes that's it some simple contact failure. </s>
<s> Then try a new drive. </s>
