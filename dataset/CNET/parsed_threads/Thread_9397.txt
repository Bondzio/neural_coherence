<s> Hey, got a new PC for christmas, upgraded from a Dimension 2350, but i can't get my x1550 PCI card from the 2350 to work, it game with 6150 geforce (onboard), and that doesn't do to well (gets a 3.0 in Gaming graphics score on vista expierience) So i am looking a a set of EVGA's on tiger. </s>
<s> The first is the 9500GT 512mb Gddr2, mem clock on that one is 1000mhz, than their is a 1gb version but the mem clock drops to 800. </s>
<s> Their is also a 512mb version with gddr3, it's mem clock is 1400mhz, and has a better bandwith speed, all the cards have a 550 core, and are 128 bit. </s>
<s> Which would be better 1gb or gdr3 speed. </s>
<s> thanks, bigboy </s>
