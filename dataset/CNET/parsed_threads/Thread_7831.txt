<s> Hi guys, ill keep it quick, im currently using a completely stock Acer Aspire m3201 and have planned to build my own from scratch for mainly gaming... Before I get set on doing so thoe i would love if somebody could just inform me if i could do suffecient upgrades to my Acer as ive bn told some things in my machine are pretty good, or would I be best just starting from scratch?? </s>
<s> any advice with minor explination would be amazing and could save me some money thanks in advance. </s>
<s> here's the specs CPU - AMD Phenom 9150e Quad-Core Processor Ram - Two 1gig ddr2 (it ses dual so i assume its two 1gigs) Graphics - ATI Radeon HD 3200 Im hoping to end up with a pretty solid gaming machine (for say bad company 2 and upcoming BC3) 19&quot; monitor at 1440x900 building from scratch id budget at around 1000 hoping to save if i can update this machine </s>
<s> Don't assume anything, know what you have with 100% certainly. </s>
<s> Then visit the Acer support website and see if anything is offered as an &quot;upgrade&quot; option. </s>
<s> Two areas that can benefit immediately are ram and video. </s>
<s> Understand how your ram is set-up and add more. </s>
<s> Then proceed to better video and here for gaming that's where alot falls on a good video card. </s>
<s> However, once a power hungry card is installed you need the PSU that's &quot;very capable&quot; to support it and whatever else gets added. </s>
<s> Also, cooling is very important so add more cooling if possible and/or upgrade to more fans or liquid cooling. </s>
<s> Since, is to be a gaming rig, cooling will play an important part, so don't dismiss this until later. </s>
<s> Heat and wattage use will increase temps and start to degrade the overall components over time, do this ASAP. </s>
<s> Last, quality does matter, buy the good stuff. </s>
<s> tada ------Willy </s>
<s> The 3200 video is the bottleneck. </s>
<s> What you the about 100 buck GPU from this list to spice it up? </s>
