1.1.1	I am a writer and have accumulated a large number ( into the thousands ) of files over the years that are all very precious to me - songs , poems , parts of my novel - from a number of systems .	St
1.1.2	Two laptops , and three PCs .	St
1.1.3	Before I left for college last year , I wanted to combine all these files into one place .	St
1.1.4	I bought a Western Digital 1 Terabyte MyBook .	St
1.1.5	I put all of my pictures , music , and documents on there .	St
1.1.6	It took up around 200 GB .	St
1.1.7	However , now , most of the files are inaccessible .	St
1.1.8	Some still are , but more than not are causing errors .	St
1.1.9	When I try to open word documents I get the message : & quot ; can not start the converter mswrd632. & quot ; Trying to move or copy documents to another drive : & quot ; the directory or file can not be created. & quot ; Open a picture : & quot ; a suitable graphics importer could not be found. & quot ; What the heck ? !	Ques
1.1.10	Why does NOTHING open , copy , or transfer ?	Ques
1.1.11	These files are very important to me .	St
1.1.12	I thought Western Digital would be a reliable brand - but this is driving me off the wall !	St
1.2.1	That nothing looks to be lost .	St
1.2.2	However the error messages are well discussed so I wo n't tackle them all .	St
1.2.3	Except that one - & gt ; & quot ; the directory or file can not be created. & quot ; This one is common on drives that the top directory has become full .	St
1.2.4	To get around this , remove some file or folder and create a new folder then put your stuff in folders in that folder .	St
1.2.5	-- & gt ; & gt ; But that 's not why I write here .	St
1.2.6	It appears you are repeating the BIG MISTAKE many make and that is to think this thing is STORAGE .	St
1.2.7	It 's not that reliable so keep a few spare copies on other media and locations of what you ca n't lose .	St
