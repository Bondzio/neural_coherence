Brick&mortor stores tend to be better to honor thier warranties if you follow the guidelines, usually within 15 days or less(read fine print) with no hassles.
Otherwise the factory warranty kicks in and you're stuck again with maker's warranty.
If you do buy an &quot;extended warranty&quot; most people I know had good responses, no matter what the store, BUT keep that paperwork handy.
At least in Best Buy, maybe CC too, the system is tested for you and then handed reboxed to you, that way you knew it worked.
One thing, if yuou need XP media center OS, get it, otherwise stay with plain XP.
