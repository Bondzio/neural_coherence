It is almost 2 years old, I believe it was the last 15in TI model they made before the new design. I love the laptop and it still serves me well. I recently upgraded to 10.4 Tiger and love it, the problem is I never purchased an original Apple Airport card and the Airport Extreme cards are not compatable. I don't want to overpay for an original slower AirPort card. I bought the D-Link DWL-G650X AirPlus G because the options that I have found are pretty limited and I trusted D-link. It said on their site it was compatable with 10.3 or higher, but then I got it and now they tell me it is not yet compatable with 10.4 Tiger and they don't know when it will be. The customer service has been a joke and I will most likely never buy a D-Link product again. I have seen a few other 3rd party apple wireless cards, but mainly from companies I have not heard of. I am about ready to give up and sell my powerbook and just get a new one with AirPort Extreme already installed. I don't really want to do that, I like the design the Powerbook I have and want to keep it, but wireless technology has come so far in 2 years when I bought it, I did not even think that much of needing wireless, now its almost a must for a laptop owner. Are there other cards out there that are compatable but they just don't mention it on the box? Or is there any other solutions I am not thinking of? Again, I am running OS 10.4.1 Tiger and that is the reason the D-Link card is not working, but I have heard some bad things about that card since I bought it anyway. I need some help!
