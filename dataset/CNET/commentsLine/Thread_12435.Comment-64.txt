i am having the same problum with one of my hard-drives.
although i have not contacted any of the manufacturers since it is an old system.
the hard-drives are maxtor as well.
a good brand.
but the system is older as i said so i have no need to complain.
or get new ones.
i'll just use the computer till it dies i suppose.
the noise started just recently while running norton antivirus.
i don't think it is a normal sound for the drives to do that.
i would switch brands and give it a try.
after all you wouldn't want to trust that the noise is normal then lose the drive and all of its info.
i would go with western digital.
i have another computer with two 10 gig hard-drives.
they work great.
i run that system 24/7 never turn it off.
hope this helps
