<s> I am upgrading the computers in my office (there are 3 of them). </s>
<s> Currently all of the insurance claim info is done over the phone, but with a new software upgrade I will be able to do it over the internet. </s>
<s> However, I am very concerned about security. </s>
<s> If I buy a wired router with a built-in firewall will this be ok? </s>
<s> The drives on one computer are shared so that the other computers can access the information on it. </s>
<s> I just don't want this to be accessible to the outside world. </s>
<s> I think I remember reading somewhere that it might be a good idea to have 2 network cards, one for the internet, and one for the internal network. </s>
<s> I didn't know if a router with a firewall would allow me to use just one network card. </s>
<s> Also, other than antivirus software, do you have any other suggestions for security? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Firewall. </s>
<s> I use Zone Alarm. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> A browser other than Internet Explorer. </s>
<s> Here's I'm typing on Seamonkey. </s>
<s> I have Firefox and also need to explore Opera. </s>
<s> The 2 network card setup sounds like far too much work for little payoff. </s>
<s> I decline writing the long reason why but it has to do with trojans and more. </s>
<s> In closing, if you preview or open emails that you didn't solicit, all bets are off. </s>
