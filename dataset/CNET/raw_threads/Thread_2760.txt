Hi guys, I have an eMachines T6212, with 512mb dual channel ddr sdram from factory. it has 4 slots total, and 512 is made up of two samsung 256mb pc3200 CL3 ddr memory. i just bought an Ultra 512MB DDR 400MHz CL3 memory which should get me 1gb memory total, but my computer is only showing 768mb memory. can anyone help?

Some machines steal the memory in spite of that. Here's what I do for the machines I can do this for. I get into the bios and reduce the video memory to it's lowest value. This gets us to the best place we can be. Bob
