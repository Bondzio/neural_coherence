<s> I am looking into purchasing some PC Diagnostic Tools, such as tools from Micro2000 ( http://micro2000.com/ ), Ultra-X ( http://www.uxd.com/ ), etc. </s>
<s> Has anyone had experience with these tools? </s>
<s> Are they worth buying? </s>
<s> Any recommendations? </s>
<s> Do you know of any reviews on these products? </s>
<s> Thanks, Jody Wood </s>
<s> ive used them in a friends shop expensive but at times saved me time etc. </s>
<s> Here are options that I have found... #1-PC Diagnostics Company ( http://www.tufftest.com/ ) Micro2000 ( http://micro2000.com/ ) PC Certify ( http://www.pccertify.com/ ) PC Doctor ( http://www.ws.com/ ) Windsor Technologies ( http://www.windsortech.com/ ) Ultra-X ( http://www.uxd.com/ ) I have yet to find any freeware in this utility arena. </s>
<s> Much comes with trial / demo versions, which allow you to perform some tests though limited. </s>
<s> I'm still researching. </s>
<s> Any thoughts and references to these and other similar products would be awesome. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, Jody Wood </s>
<s> I have ever heard somewhat &quot;Qiguan diagnostic cards&quot;. </s>
<s> It is said that their diagnstic cards thoroughly eliminated the &quot;initial codes&quot; and solved problems like wrong codes, redundant codes and omitting codes, which greatly reduced guesswork in PC troubleshooting. </s>
<s> Maybe you can have a try. </s>
