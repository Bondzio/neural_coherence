hi, jb, yes, why indeed the 100-client setting for so few computers?
the router always used to assign ip addresses to the wireless adapters in order, starting with x.x.x.100.
but a few days ago it decided to deny access to all but one computer in the house... until i allowed a greater number of assignments, then it started assigning at x.x.x.151 and up.
in other words, it refused to give those assignments between x.x.x.101 and x.x.x.150.
but updating the router's firmware solved the problem, although this still has me a bit concerned as it simply 'quit working right' for no apparent reason.
all five computers in the house have only wireless access to the router; in fact, the only hard-wired connection to the router is between it and the dsl modem.
the router is in the attic and the computers are sprinkled throughout the house.
even though i once attended a seminar about rewiring pre-information-age homes, punching holes, running wires and patching sheetrock is not my thing.
and thanks for the tip about building a table of mac addresses.
i have done that using the router's built-in utility just for this purpose.
the mac list has only the addresses of the three desktops and two laptops, and should not assign an ip to any interlopers.
before i did this, i was able to see neighbors trying to hop onto the network from time to time, perhaps automatically and honestly, but who knows?
