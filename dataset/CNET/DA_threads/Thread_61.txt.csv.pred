1.2.1	It does make a difference.	St

1.3.1	i will have 2 win xp pro copies, 1 win server 2003 copy and maybe a linux (unknown distro at this time) down the road.	Sug
1.3.2	as for buying the boot manager, if is ts affordable (under 50-60 american.	St
1.4.1	In that case, the XP and 2003 boot manager will be OK.	St
1.4.2	When you get a current Linux Distro, a new boot manager (most likely GRUB) will handle the boot management.	St
1.4.3	If you get some old Linux distro, then you have to deal with it.	St
