i value your input, and thank you for taking the time to help me out.
i tried out the nc10 (nearest i could find easily to the machine i thought i wanted) and although it was pretty impressive in many ways, the shop assistant admitted it would struggle with more than 3 or 4 browser tabs open if anything slightly demanding was asked of it at the same time... i'd been toying with buying a mac book for some time, and as this is a business purchase, that's the way i went this time.
mac os takes some getting used to for a windows user since 3.1, but the capabilities overall suggest it's more up to the job.
i'd have to agree, though, that the netbooks are impressive, and excellent value for money.
were it not for the need to process audio, i'd have gone down that route for sure.
thanks again, folks, for your help.
phil
