ok, i found 2 more 300w psus, they are the best spares i have.
i've tried one and it worked straight away and started normally to windows.
i shut down from windows and guess what?
yep, it wouldn't start again.
then i replaced that with the next psu and again nothing, no fans, absolutely nothing.
i don't get it!
