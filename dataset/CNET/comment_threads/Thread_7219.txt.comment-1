Being reluctant to spend money and of the old fasion opinon that pc's should be as long lasting as appliences from the 70's (yeah I know) I am still using a ATI/Rage Fury Pro Xpert 2000 PRO card.
Does this card support ''Transform and Lighting''?
Probably not and if it doesn't can any recomend an inexpensive card that does.
I have a gigabyte Socket A mother board GA-7VAXP with an AMD Athalon XP 1800 chip.
Also can any one help me with navagating ATI's site.
Can I E-mail them this question?
Where on the site?
Customer support only seems to have a telephone option.
Thanks, everyone David
