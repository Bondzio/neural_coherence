and you don't have any third-party stuff to do this, or a custom compiled kernel?
i had thought i read somewhere, i think on wikipedia, that the gnu/linux kernel had limited support for ntfs, only supporting reads at best.
i'm probably wrong, though, since this will be my first shot at any gnu/linux distro, or building a computer.
or maybe i read an outdated article from somewhere else.
it certainly doesn't help when i'm all alone in the technological world, with only these forums and the internet, not anyone to actually talk to.
once i'm finished my build, i'll just go ahead and try it, and post how it went.
thanks for the help and boost of confidence!
