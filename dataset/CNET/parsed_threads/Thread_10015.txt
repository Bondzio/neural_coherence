<s> I've scanned my hard drive with Western Digital Data Lifeguard Diagnostics and HDTune and they both came back saying my hard drive has bad sectors. </s>
<s> Does bad sectors mean that my hard drive has physical damage to it and is not fixable. </s>
<s> That's exactly what it means. </s>
<s> Now it is your choice to replace it, backup your files or &quot;your choice&quot; what to do next. </s>
<s> I'm sure someone will write about sector sparing and more but if there were spares then the drive would have already done this and you would not be asking. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Now I just need to get a new hard drive and in the mean time I'll backup what I can. </s>
<s> Thank you again. </s>
