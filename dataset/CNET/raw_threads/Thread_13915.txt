8192	0	206537	2209688	NR	Larry Hudson	9/16/06 9:15 PM	1.1584413E12	way to upgrade	Hello Everyone! I think I have thought of a way to backup my current HDD. Would it be possible to buy a DVD Writer, put all my data on DVDs, install the new HDD and put files on? But don't DVDs only hold video files? I have a 9.39GB HDD and I am going to upgrade to 80GB HDD. I am using a Desktop PC. All suggestions appreciated, -Larry

Might also consider going to 120GB...they're almost same price as then 80GB and they're under the size limit where almost any OS would recognize the full capacity (see 48bitlba.com). Check over at Newegg.com ..they've got a wide selection of HDDs and and DVD burner's. VAPCMD

It'll be faster and quieter. You can put any type of file on a DVD as long as it fits. There are good dual layer DVD burners (read and write to both CD's and DVD's) for less than $40 online. What is your computer manufacturer name and model? What operating system?

The issue of hard drives larger than 137GB: http://www.48bitlba.com/ http://www.48bitlba.com/win2k.htm * * * * * Your motherboard may not support newer Ultra ATA hard drives (ATA/66/100/133), so you may have to add an ATA/100/133 hard disk controller card to a PCI slot. Something like one of these: http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.asp?Submit=ENE&N=2000150410+1193212548+119340940+1193512552&Subcategory=410&description=&srchInDesc= Also, make sure you use an 80-wire (not 40 wire) Ultra ATA data cable. See the pictures here: http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/confCable80-c.html * * * * * The maker of your new HD has a free utility to transfer the image of the old HD directly to the new one. This is much quicker than reinstalling the OS, drivers, OS patches, software, and personal files. However, if I haven't performed a fresh installation of everything in years, I like to take the opportunity of a new HD to do just that. It eliminates a lot of junk and fixes corrupt system files. REMEMBER to implement your plan to backup all important file to CD or DVD before you try any of these solutions.
