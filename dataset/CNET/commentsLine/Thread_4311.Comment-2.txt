it all depends on what is taking the space on the primary hard drive.
if music files are the culprit then that should solve the problem, but when an internal hd gets to that situation we often find that other steps are needed, for example, reducing system files like system restore backup files, (if windows), uninstalling un-needed software, etc.
so really it is difficult to say whether what you suggest will work or not.
one thing though, where are your backups?
