i can't tell from your post if the ip is valid.
seem close, but you didn't reveal the rest of the numbers.
netmask, and more.
it's not a public ip so there are no jewels at risk.
another nugget to get network sharing to work is that the firewalls of xp are &quot;off&quot; and that the workgroup names are the same.
if you can't share, i have to leave you to read  and  it's also very important that zone alarm be uninstalled or again, i can't help... bob
