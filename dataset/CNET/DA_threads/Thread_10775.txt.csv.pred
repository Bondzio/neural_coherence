1.1.1	first of all i have a Pentium Intel Celeron processor running at 400MHz and a 66FSB speed.	St
1.1.2	i havent installed anything new recently except a 10/100 MB/s networking card and a new CD-RW drive.	St
1.1.3	the problem is that i go through the normal process of going to Start and clicking on shut down.	St
1.1.4	Everything runs normal and everything shuts off, but i just leave it alone and VOILA it just reboots all by itself.	St
1.1.5	I have gone through the Bios allready and have tweaked the power management options to my liking, but none of the options it gives me relates to the problem i am receiving.	St
1.1.6	PLEASE HELP!!!	St
1.1.7	!	St
1.2.1	You mentioned installing a new network card.	St
1.2.2	If it has a WOL (Wake on LAN) feature, disable it.	St
1.2.3	Some have a cable that goes to the MB and the MB BIOS may have a setting for this.	St
1.2.4	It should only trigger with a special command but who knows what else might.	St
1.2.5	You can also try uninstalling the NIC or other recent hardware to see if the problem goes away...just to narrow things down.	St
1.2.6	Good luck.	St
