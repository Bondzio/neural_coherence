1.1.1	I am currently looking at dual graphic card setup and currently am looking at the: EVGA 01G-P3-N891-AR GeForce 9800 GX2 1GB( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130338 ) with the mobo ASUS P5K deluxe ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131182 ) Does this work or am I going to have to look at a new motherboard, any advice would greatly help.	St
1.2.1	Are you putting in just one card?	St
1.2.2	If so, should be fine if the PSU and such is up to the task.	St
1.3.1	No I would be considering adding a second one and am wondering if it is possible.	St
1.3.2	My PSU is a 850w so I'm fine in that department.	St
1.4.1	Something to ask the board's maker and their support line.	St
1.5.1	there are hacked drivers for dual 8000 series cards but they're flaky.	St
1.5.2	and they definitely won't support dual gx2.	St
1.6.1	I decided to drop the ASUS name then since all they have in the price area is intel chipsets, and went with a EVGA ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813188026 ) Let me know what you think or if you can find a better one for under 200 dollars let me know.	St
1.6.2	I think this should easily support the dual graphics card set up I want to do.	St
1.6.3	Again thanks for the input.	Polite
