i have a lexmark x1270 that is less than a year old.
i usually use ms word but i have several legal documents that are in wordpefect 11 and it won't print anything.
it prints word, wordpad, notepad, excell, images etc.
just not wordperfect.
i emailed lexmark support about this but have not as yet received a reply.
i was able to print wordperfect from this computer when i had an hp printer, which i no longer have.
any ideas.
