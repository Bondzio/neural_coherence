Over the years I found this to be trouble and try to use the stock settings to avoid a future problem. So the answer here is &quot;should be fine&quot; with the added answer of &quot;it depends&quot; on if this machine has a BIOS setting other than defaults that you depend on. Bob

But since you've got the warning and time permits ... why not replace it ? The CMOS battery is usually a CR2032 and they're relatively easy to replace if you follow the PC battery replacement instructions. VAPCMD
