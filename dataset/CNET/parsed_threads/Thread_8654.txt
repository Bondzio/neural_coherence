<s> I was djing a party last night when my computer dyed. </s>
<s> I have had it for about 6 months and it is my 5th computer i have built. </s>
<s> When the power button is hit the power supply turns on runs then fan and about 1 second later shuts off. </s>
<s> There are leds on the motherboard that stay on. </s>
<s> Nothing internally has changed. </s>
<s> I have: Foxconn digitalife mother board Intel quad core processor 800 watt psu 8800gts gpu 120gb 10k rpm hard drive by western digital 2(500) gb hard drives If more specifics are needed I can provide them If anyone has any clue as to what happened to my unit it would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Unplug all IDE cables. </s>
<s> Disconnect all drives. </s>
<s> If it boots then or you can enter the bios, your psu has been overtaxed. </s>
<s> Your stuffed system generates alot heat and cause the psu to degrade and/or become unstable. </s>
<s> the damage is probably already done, but check anyways. </s>
<s> In such cases, swapping the psu is the way to go. </s>
<s> Hi-wattage generic labeled psus may not be stable over time as generic labels aren't reliable, regardless of specs. </s>
<s> A good namebrand is costly but worth it over the life of the system. </s>
<s> Also, think added cooling for continued use. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> i tried the psu (OCZ 700w) and it does it with my other one as well. </s>
<s> it is not anything to do with the ides since they were all unplugged. </s>
<s> if the mother board is still showing leds that would lead to the cpu correct? </s>
<s> It powers up. </s>
<s> everything is removed from it except the cpu and the motherboard </s>
<s> Sometimes you find it's the mounting. </s>
<s> If the mtrbd. </s>
<s> led(one)is lit is only an indication of power present, a visible reminder to the users. </s>
<s> If you have a set of leds, goto the support website(or manual) and locate what those leds means, what pattern may note a fault. </s>
<s> Removing the drives was an attempt to remove some load off the psu and possible drive problem if cause. </s>
<s> Also, you remove those as an issue and reduce the system. </s>
<s> You can further reduce the system to only single ram and video and keybd. </s>
<s> and mouse. </s>
<s> if the problem persists, swap ram. </s>
<s> If the problem still persists, you can remove cpu, ram, and only connect the mtrbd.. </s>
<s> Problem remains, you got a bad mtrbd., if it starts to beep away and fans remain ON, possible bad cpu. </s>
<s> Install cpu and it should still beep but if it remains ON, then add 1 ram stick. </s>
<s> Be sure to power OFF before doing so. </s>
<s> Reboot, find a usable ram combo or otherwise the bad ram or combo of ram. </s>
<s> Its very possible to have multiple problems. </s>
<s> Its important to understand, if a mtrbd. </s>
<s> problem(or start to build another system) and you replace it, don't install a whole system again and boot-up. </s>
<s> A 2ndary(old parts) problem will come back to crash or take down the system due to its limitations and/or cause limited service. </s>
<s> Since, you already got 5mo. </s>
<s> out of it, it maybe heat related issues that degraded the componets and finally &quot;poof&quot; it went. </s>
<s> That's why cooling is important and notice of shutdowns, reboots, or freezes is a sign of such an issue. </s>
