1.1.1	After uninstalling Boot Camp ( uninstalled due to incorrect xp cd ) , my MacBook now boots slowly than before Boot Camp was installed .	St
1.1.2	Before it would boot up in around 20 seconds .	St
1.1.3	Now , when I push the power button all I get is a light gray color screen for about 25 seconds and the hard drive is not being accessed during that time .	St
1.1.4	Then , the apple logo appears and booting finishes normally .	St
1.1.5	The whole process now takes around 50 seconds to complete .	St
1.1.6	That is the only thing I can think of that would cause the problem .	St
1.1.7	If anyone can help , it would be appreciated .	Ques
1.1.8	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	If you use Parallels , than you probably know that Parallels uses a partition of Boot Camp to boot Windows under the Mac OS .	St
1.2.2	If you use it , which I do n't know if you do , your Boot Camp files may still be intact somewhere .	St
1.2.3	I doubt that my theory is correct though .	St
1.2.4	I think that this could have happened : XP did not correctly install .	St
1.2.5	Boot Camp modifies Macs to be able to switch from Tiger to XP or Vista upon booting up .	St
1.2.6	XP did not install properly , but maybe some remnant of Boot Camp on your hard drive thinks it did , giving you extra time to choose between your operating systems .	St
1.2.7	But since you uninstalled Boot Camp , you ca n't switch to another system .	St
1.2.8	Your system still works properly afterwards because it thinks you have chosen to run the Mac OS , the default OS .	St
1.2.9	In conclusion to this theory , Boot Camp has modified your Mac to think it can still run Windows when it ca n't .	St
1.2.10	To fix it , you could try searching for hidden Boot Camp files , reinstalling Boot Camp and XP , or taking your Mac to your local Apple Store .	Sug
1.2.11	I think that this may be the most logical answer , supposing it is true and Boot Camp files still exist somewhere on your Mac .	St
1.2.12	Otherwise , it may be due to lack of usage , power , or corrupted files/viruses , all unlikely .	St
1.2.13	Try these solutions and maybe you 'll fix it .	St
1.2.14	Good luck .	Polite

1.3.1	When you removed Boot Camp , did you use the uninstaller or just drag XP off into the trash can ?	Ques
1.3.2	Use Disk Utility to see if your HD is still partitioned .	St
1.3.3	One HFS+ and the other NTFS .	St
1.3.4	FWIW , Boot Camp gives you the option of booting into Windows before the machine actually begins the startup process .	St
1.3.5	That 25 seconds may be the period that it spends checking to see where it should go P	St
