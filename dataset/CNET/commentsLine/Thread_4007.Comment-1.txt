hi all first, i would like to thank you all for the help in the past.
was so far very helpful.
the problem i'm sitting now with is that i'm trying to split a ethernet cable.
what i have so far is a switch set up and working 100% with 11 computers.
now there is another pc comming in and i need another ethernet cable to that pc.
but my problem is that i have to go through walls and other obstacles.
i want to save some time and money on this, so i thought of splitting the cable.
what i have tried was, one cable that i know is working.
i took that point, and plugged it in to a wallbox, and then took 2 fly leads and punched them into that same wallbox.
now when i connect the 2 fly leads comming out of the wallbox to the 2 pc's, the light on the back of the cards, goes on and off, and the connection shows &quot;limited or no connectivity&quot;.
this tells me that that method of splitting is not working.
all i need to know is why not??
i'll be putting in another switch and work it from there, which i'm busy with, but i would like to find out why my trick didn't work out.
thanks
