I've got an emachine T5026 with this integrated setup.
It says it supports Pixel Shaders 2.0, but when I try to run my 7 year old's &quot;Lego Star Wars&quot; it won't run and gives me a mesage that it requires Pixel Shaders 1.1.
I understand this Intel GMA is not a gamers setup, but &^*$@ why won't it run?
I have installed the latest drivers...
