A cheap case that I like is the ThermalTake Soprano. DVD burners are cheap; $60 or less gets you a dual layer. Since you have an SLI ready motherboard, it makes more sense going with nvidia. If you want a tivo type thing, then get a seperate tv tuner. ATI all in wonders are good since it doubles as a t.v. tuner and graphics card. They are however bad because they do have problems when you are trying to burn a show to DVD, or are trying to record a show. As I said, get a graphics card and a seperate t.v. tuner card, or an external t.v. tuner. As for the graphics card, you have such nice specs on your system that you should get a better graphics card, and also your motherboard is SLI ready. As I said before, you should get a Gefore 7800GT, but if that is to expensive then get this http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1648482&CatId=0 You can also put the 6800 GS in an SLI configuration.

Don't forget windows or arctic silver 5 thermal compound. Suggest getting new creative xi-fi extreme music card instead. Get a 6800gs gfx card and tv-tuner card. 250?GB sata hd or larger. NEC 3550-A DL DVD+_RW Burner. Other than that, looks good. Case-wise, w/e you want
