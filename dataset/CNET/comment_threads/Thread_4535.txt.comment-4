I have a PowerPC G5 running 10.4.11 I connect to the internet via Ethernet at my college, no access to switch/router.
So I was able to get internet sharing working for my cellphone, and set a password to get on, but when I start my firewall it blocks all traffic from the cellphone.
I've tried many of the checkboxes to attempt to allow the connection with login, but nothing seems to work.
Currently I only have Personal Web Sharing selected on both Firewall, and Services.
Do you guys know this stuff well enough to help walk me through this step by step?
I need connectivity with my cellphone as my Google Voice Phone is run through the internet.
