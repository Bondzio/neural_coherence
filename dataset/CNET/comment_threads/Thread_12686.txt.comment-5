Getting the spyware removers is a good start as others suggested.
Review again what you want in pgms.
to be running and then delete, entirely rather than stopping them.
Sadly, after doing all this and maybe some other suggestions, it maybe better to start from scratch and reload the OS, after a clean format, save all data, etc.
you deem necessary.
If your system is capable looking into the XP OS maybe valid upgrade if only to get beyond the Me headaches as its more stable.
The only cavet in either case is a memory upgrade, 512mb is great for Me and XP, but more mbs for XP is far better.
good luck -----Willy
