i don't know exactly what it is you are looking for in a home computer, but this looks like it should work for what you seem to be looking for, but you have buy a seperate monitor and speakers, but it will still end up cheaper than 2,000 here is what i think might work for you  there are other desktops on that website too.
good luck
