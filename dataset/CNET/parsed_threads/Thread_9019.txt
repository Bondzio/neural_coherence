<s> Experiencing repeated paper jams. </s>
<s> I have thoroughly inspected for any obstructions and have plenty of paper in the feed tray. </s>
<s> The paper feeds ~ 1 1/2 inches before jamming and I have to remove the paper by removing the back cover and pulling the paper out backwards. </s>
<s> Any thoughts are appreciated. </s>
<s> While you can try RUBBER RENEWAL products (see amazon.com) the repair usually and always costs more than a new printer. </s>
<s> Are you saying the machine itself has a life expectancy of two years? </s>
<s> If so, why doesn't Brother disclose this and further, does this apply to any make and model of an &quot;all-in-one&quot; machine? </s>
<s> What specifically are you referring to when you say Rubber Renewal products at Amazon.com? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> You haven't lived through the years of thousand dollar dot matrix printers and the move to lower costs and shorter life spans. </s>
<s> Your reply is one that I'd expect from today's newer owners. </s>
<s> This assessment and statement is what I apply to all &quot;consumer&quot; printers. </s>
<s> The business class machines fare better but you don't see those at the retail venues. </s>
