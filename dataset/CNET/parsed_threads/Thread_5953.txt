<s> Does anyone know where I can learn what the ideal CPU temperature is? </s>
<s> I've heard 45 deg C when not being used and 65 deg C when heavily active. </s>
<s> I've been annoyed with my fan running at 80% all the time to ensure that my CPU stays cool. </s>
<s> So I just lowered it to around 65% and now my temperature hovers around 65% when I'm gaming. </s>
<s> I want to make sure I'm not going to blow the darn thing up. </s>
<s> Thanks ahead of time. </s>
<s> heatsink fan you're running...kinda difficult to provide any further response. </s>
<s> Download and run CPUZ...then repost specifics. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I still have a prescott p4 3.6ghz and it idles at 52-57 C, but than the local temp is in the high 80s F. My P4 has gone up to over 100 degrees celcius, w/ no fan because for some reason, the automatic shutdown failed on me , and nothing happened to the processor...I'm using that computer right now to type out this response. </s>
<s> Highly not recommended to try at home. </s>
<s> CPUZ is a great program by the way. </s>
<s> Processor(s) Number of processors </s>
<s> Maybe you need a better, higher performance CPU heatsink fan ...one that's quieter. </s>

<s> I have just completed the setup of my new vista HTCP. </s>
<s> I am using the il-90mv. </s>
<s> Core 2 Duo 2 Ghz. </s>
<s> Nmedia 200A case. </s>
<s> Install went pretty well, I even got the Viiv software installed and working correctly. </s>
<s> My issue is the CPU temp. </s>
<s> The nmedia case has two temperature sensors that display CPU and Case temp on the VFD.The CPU temp starts around 75 F and within 30 minutes heads up to about 93F. </s>
<s> It will then stay at 93 F for as long as I have it on. </s>

<s> Thanks again </s>
<s> I have an Athlon 64 3200+ Venice on socket 754 (its ancient but it works for me along with Vista) connected to a Thermaltake Golden Orb II with no fan control but running at 2200RPM tops and Arctic Silver 5 grease. </s>
<s> It is very good if it runs 20^C but anything under probably may be sensors incorrection up to what you said. </s>
<s> Anything higher, you should probably turn off the machine and check if the heatsink is properly attached or if the Thermal grease needs to be wiped and freshly applied. </s>
<s> If there is no grease but a tape, buy a small pack of Arctic Silver 5 which is usually around 5 bucks and apply a bead size or a specific amount that Intel/AMD recommends. </s>
<s> Whoever told you 45^C needs to do some more research... </s>
<s> If those temperatures are in Fahrenheit, then it should usually be around 35^C for 75^F and 40 to 50ish for the 90s. </s>
<s> I'm just guessing these conversions but I assure you if those are fahrenheit and not celcius then it is fine </s>
