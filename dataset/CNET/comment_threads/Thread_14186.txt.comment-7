Your 160 gig drive will format at something less and 149 sounds about right.
Ghost should not, however, need a formatted drive.
It should want all free space as it does not copy file by file.
I cannot explain the drive letter changes.
What you normally would have done is clone the drive and disconnect the old when when the new one boots up for the first time.
I cannot confirm this but I have heard stories that XP may be unhappy seeing a mirror of itself on the same system and might not boot properly.
If the old drive was C: the clone should be C:.
XP will, however, note the hardware change and could require reactivation.
As far as using the old drive for backup, you can do so for data storage by formatting it but keeping a mirror of another XP volume might be a problem.
