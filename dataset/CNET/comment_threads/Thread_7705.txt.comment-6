I'm considering buying the D-Link DIR-655.
Has anybody tried it on WildBlue Satalite?
Also, I would like to print to it wireless.
The DIR-655 has a USB port on the back but I haven't seen anywhere where it specifically states that you can plug in the printer and do this.
The printer is an HP 1310 series.
