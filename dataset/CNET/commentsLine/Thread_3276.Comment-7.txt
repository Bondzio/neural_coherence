i am trying out an acer aspire with 1g ram & 250g memory.
it is very, very slow; the touchpad is very skittish no matter how i adjust it; and it simple is not powerful enough to have multiple screens open.
i'm extremely disappointed and am returning it (i purchased on a tv shopping channel that gives me that ability to return with no restocking fee).
but, i do like the portability and long battery life.
there is an hp pavilion dm1z that has an 11.6&quot; screen, 3g ram, 320g hard drive, and you can select a turion dual core processor for about $525.
it only weighs in at 3.25 lbs.
according to specs.
i'm seriously considering this purchase since i would be able to multi-task, not be so frustrated by slowness, and still have portability.
