I've been able to install programs to other partitions without much trouble, but not necessarilly to ''X:\program files''.
Feel free to try, but be aware that not all programs will do this willingly.
If it fails, you'll have to install the program to the local drive.
However, if your HD/OS crashes, you'll still be out of luck...almost all programs are tied into Windows, to at least some degree.
The registry and a lot of files used by the programs are still stored on the local drive, and this can't be changed.
Thus, you'll still have to reinstall the programs after you reinstall Windows.
(This is only useful for storing your personal files.)
The only way to avoid such tedious work is to create an exact duplicate of your entire hard drive (others can recommend software for this), so that you can simply pop in the other drive (or upload from CDs/DVDs) and continue on as usual.
Hope this helps, John
