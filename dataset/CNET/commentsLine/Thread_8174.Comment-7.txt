to the best of my knowledge, you cannot mix sata and pata ide drives in the same raid array.
most of the configurations i've seen recommend using the same make, model and capacity drive when you're building a raid array.
re raid...help me understand why you want to use raid at all ?
sata hdds....take a look at storagereview.com, tomshardware.com, anandtech.com, etc.
then look a newegg.com and see the buyer comments on the specific products you're interested in.
in real life sata drives don't give you much more performanvce if any over the corresponding pata drives.
the major benefit is they allow addition of more drives to the system, they don't require jumpering and they use less cumbersome cabling.
