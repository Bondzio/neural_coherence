since you built your own tower you probably already know this..but i 'll mention it just to be sure.
prior to and ending in 2007 a popular connection cable for the hd was ata/ide type vs the now standard sata.
please verify your connection before you buy.
if the former type you may want to consider bringing your entire rig inline with newer technology although not required to enjoy the benefits of a ssd.
have fun with your diy project.
