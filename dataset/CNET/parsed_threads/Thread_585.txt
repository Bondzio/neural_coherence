<s> Hello all, my brother has just bought and installed a pc memory stick that gives me around 75GB extra memory. </s>
<s> I have no idea about the internal workings of a pc so he bought and installed the stick for me. </s>
<s> He has told me that the stick has been installed properly. </s>
<s> How can I access that new memory from my pc? </s>
<s> Does the stick automatcally create a new disk drive in 'My Coputer?' </s>
<s> Where can I find the memory stick memory information on Windows xp? </s>
<s> How do I save things to the stick instead of the my harddrive? </s>
<s> To be sure it is installed properly, your brother must have tried it, so it seems logical to me he showed you that it worked correctly and how to use it. </s>
<s> I assume it isn't a flash drive, but something with a (rather large) hard disk inside. </s>
<s> And I assume it's just a drive letter (maybe d:, maybe g:) in My Computer. </s>
<s> So saving or moving anything to it can be done by selecting the g:-drive in stead of the c:-drive. </s>
<s> And you can move or copy anything to it using My Computer or Windows Explorer like you copy or move to any other drive. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>

<s> Hello again, my brother is on vacation for two weeks and I have no way of contacting him. </s>
<s> I have no idea what type of memory stick he used or what brand, I don't even have the manual. </s>
<s> I have just checked My Computer and there is no new driver listed. </s>
<s> Has anybody got any ideas? </s>
<s> Has it installed correctly? </s>
<s> shane </s>
<s> I'm afraid it is impossible to say more about it with the information you give. </s>
<s> It might even be a second internal hard disk in stead of an external device. </s>
<s> And it might be, for example, that it still has to be partitioned and formatted using Disk Management. </s>
<s> That should be in the manual. </s>
<s> Nothing much to do but wait till your brother returns. </s>
<s> Or bring it to a local shop and let them fix it. </s>
<s> If they see it, they will know what to do with it to get it up and running. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> The info you have given us is rather confusing. </s>
<s> You keep referring to a memory stick, also known as RAM or random access memory which(very briefly) only increases the working area for running programs and other functions it is not for storage. </s>
<s> so my question is did he install extra RAM or an internal hard drive. </s>
<s> do you see any components outside the computer like sitting on the desktop somewhere with wires going to the computer. </s>
<s> If not he installed an extra Hard drive internally. </s>
<s> right click MY Computer and click Manage. </s>
<s> On The windows that opens click Disk management and see if there is a new drive there. </s>
<s> Right click the drive and click initiate. </s>
<s> when that is done you will need to format the drive. </s>
<s> Hello again, there is no new external hard drive sitting anywhere on my pc. </s>
<s> I have just tried the 'Manage' option on My Computer and it only lists my original c hard drive and dvd player. </s>
<s> It looks like I will have to wait for my brother to come home. </s>
<s> Shane </s>
<s> Hello again, I have just solved the problem! </s>
<s> My brother actually installed an updated graphics card that came with its own memory. </s>
<s> That's why I could not find any new hard drive info on my pc. </s>
<s> Thanks for all the help Shane </s>
<s> That's a pretty interesting discovery. </s>
<s> The Larger video card will not give you any extra storage space but it should give you a little better performance for video functions. </s>
