first thing, install new cmos battery, just do it.
then if you truly have a floppy but hardly use it, disable it in the bios area.
otherwise, its a true fault, nothing can be done.
if possibble try another floppy drive.
again, if that doesn't fix it, the fd port is kaput.
if you need a fd port, install a fd card for that option.
rseat or replace fd cables to test that.
