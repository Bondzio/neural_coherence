I have a wireless network with 2 PC's on it - a desktop running WinXP and a Laptop running Vista. I would like to add an old PC running Win98 to the network. I am willing to wipe the HDD, and purchase and install a fresh copy of Win98SE if necessary, as I have discovered FE isn't supported by anything I have found. The computer doesn't have the specs to run WinXP, so that's out. It also doesn't have any USB ports, so a PCI card will be needed. I just want it to be able to share my broadband internet connection at minimum. Any suggestions on a wireless PCI card for a Win98 (or Win98SE) PC? Thank you for your input!

I'm partial to D-link for all networking parts. Get one of their wireless PCI cards, it'll come with the install CD with the drivers for W98SE.
