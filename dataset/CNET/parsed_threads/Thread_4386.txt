<s> I have an old Compaq desktop computer that I would like to add wirelessly to my home network. </s>
<s> The computer is running Windows 98 (not 98SE). </s>
<s> I need to buy some type of wireless adapter for the computer to connect it to the network. </s>
<s> Do you know of a product that is compatible with Windows 98? </s>
<s> I solve this with ethernet wifi clients. </s>
<s> I don't know what country you are in so I'll give one example so you can start looking. </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?q=DWL-G810 There are others by other makers but this neatly sidesteps the OS issue. </s>

<s> Thanks for the information. </s>
<s> Something like that will work perfectly. </s>
<s> However, the D-Link DWL-G810 that you pointed me to didn't receive good reviews on Amazon.com. </s>
<s> Do you know of a similar product that you would recommend? </s>
<s> By the way, I'm located in the United States. </s>
<s> I use them without issue but I'm a little technically inclined and even with such reviews I've still made these ethernet bridge units work just fine. </s>
<s> I'm going to decline researching or searching for all such units in the US. </s>
<s> There are far too many. </s>

<s> ...and I'm using a NETGEAR MA401 that I picked up on ebay. </s>
<s> Check out it's support page. </s>
