emachines are kick ass computers, u can turn the t6212 in a formidable super computer (exagerating).
i really dont think the path you choose whether it be amd or intel really make a difference, they each have certain tasks that they can finish faster than the other.
amd obviously beats intel in gaming, but does that mean that people with intel cpus cant play intense pc games?
the answer is no.
so what if an amd will get a few more fps in a game, big woop.
intel is extremely good at multitasking, i never see any amd fans mention this ever, because they know that intel is the most advance cpu that can multitask efficiently.
but now that dual cores are out, its a little more even, except the dual cores with hyper threading with each core, similiar to have 4 cpus.
the like wise is for amd.
intel is great at video editing and what not, but does that mean that amd cpus cant do that?
no, intel will just perform these tasks slightly faster.
so my big answer is, what ever cpu you choose whether it be intel or amd, can perform the exact same task that the other is either better at or weaker at.
now im off to play the bf2 demo on my intel p4 3ghz machine konny
