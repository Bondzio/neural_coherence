hi i have a new (to me) 6 months old computer.
it was built by a friend of a friend.
it has a asus mainboard and as i say the main drive shows as removable hardware.
it works fine i'm just worried i accidentally hit remove device!
would i then be in loads of trouble trying to start my pc.also i would like to know why it shows like this.
many thanks j j
