9702	0	262224	2573244	NR	gaston55	8/29/07 5:11 PM	1.18840746E12	Need advice on what size PSU to get ?	Just bought a new EVGA e-GeForce 7900 gs video card. The card requires a minimun 450w with +12 volt current rating of 22 amps. I currently have only a 400w with 16 amps. My system is a Gateway DX430X. Core2 DUO 2.13GHz 3GB DDR2 SDRAM 500GB 7200rpm SATA DVD/RW 52x CD ROM PCI sound card PCI modem 1 to 2 devices running on USB ports Keyboard/mouse Tower fan CPU fan Will a 500w be sufficient? Or should I go with a 550w or even higher? I dont want to go to high, but I dont want to go to low either.

If you decide to pick cheap, then expect cheap results over time. I tend to buy a good brandname and offering dual fan cooling along with wattage and rail volts(depends) required. Also, a good rule of thumb is the stable and dependable output on a constant basis is 75% of rating, others may quote higher than that, but 75% is a safe bet. A decent 500W+ psu should suffice for your needs provided a generic psu fits in your Gateway. Check out http://www.geeks.com and others, FYI, got the Logisys(575W) psu for $39, recently and does well. tada -----Willy

By the way, what's your criteria for a 'good brand name'? $39 for a 575W PSU sounds too cheap to be something I'd want to put into more than a minimum system. Looking at the web below makes we wonder why you 'recommend' the Logisys http://www.overclockers.com.au/wiki/Power_Supply_Unit#Trusted_Power_Supply_Makers VAPCMD

Even those that were a few yrs. no longer are or don't provide what has become a leader. Coolmaster as an example didn't make psu or at least under thier own bage, but rather fans and heatsinks. They grew and now offer psu but even so, may not be of their own manufacturing factories but rebadged psu from another provider. That is very much what has become of some psu suppliers. Thermalke as another example wasn't around suppling psu but is a big player now. Also, some brandnames may fail when pushed too, but they seem to provide a tolerance far above true cheap units and that's to include real(dependable) build-in safety features. As for my recommending Logisys, it has proven so far to deliver the goods. At the same time, I don't make a point of testing batches of psus but can certainly recommend what has worked for me. Sounding cheap and finding a good bargain at the time and when previous offering were higher priced of the same model. I did mentioned, to look at the specs and find other vendors. You can look at http://www.pcpowerandcooling.com and see if many jump to pay those prices, even though they're very very good. I don't have a minimal system and the Logisys is doing well. tada -----Willy
9702	6	262224	2574006	2573947	VAPCMD	8/30/07 5:30 PM	1.188495E12	Willy ...just seems a little strange talking up	the better quality PSUs and then recommending a total NO NAME that turns up on someone else's NOT RECOMMENDED list. Except for some PSUs that came with cases many many years ago, I always use Enermax, Antec, Fortron-Source, Seasonic or most recently Corsair. Leaving my main system on 24-7, I want something very very reliable. Whether it's luck or just better quality stuff I've never had a PSU failure in over 20 years of building, upgrading and repairing PCs. Knock on wood and keeping my fingers crossed too. VAPCMD
