hi everyone, i'm back from my short holiday and have tried a few things as suggested.
the replacement cpu i was using throughout, works fine in another pc and restarts without problem, as does the floppy and psu in lots of combinations, all together and alone with other hardware.
however, i managed to find and tried another cpu on the problem board and guess what?
yep, it started once and then wouldn't restart.
so, it looks like it is the motherboard after all.
thanks so much to everyone that helped with this problem, you have all been very informative and if nothing else, i have learned a lot from you.
thanks, minskin
