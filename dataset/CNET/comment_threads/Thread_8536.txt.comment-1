I have a Wall Street G3 PowerBook that ran MS Office 98 with an 8.6 OS.
I recently bought an appareently new OS 9 DISK online.
It installed OS 9.2, but I cannot open the apps in Office 98 anymore.
I get an &quot;unexpectedly&quot; after it crashes while starting to load.
Something about error 3 message.
Can anyone help or is it too archaic a problem?
