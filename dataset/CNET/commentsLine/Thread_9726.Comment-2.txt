for the ribbon cable for your old pata drive??
nowadays we must use pata and sata because both are actuall ide drives as well as ata drives.
the data cable for pata drives are the 40 pin ribbons.
sata data cable is much smaller.
the sytem should see the older drive if you have it jumpered properly for how it is plugged into the new computer.
{probably need to jumper the drive as cable select (cs)].
