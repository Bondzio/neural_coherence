<s> I recently purchased an Acer AL1916WABD LCD monitor which is a widescreen 19&quot; monitor with digital DVI-D connector. </s>
<s> Before that, I owned an LG Flatron L1720P 17&quot; LCD monitor. </s>
<s> The aspect ratio of the LG is the standard 4:3 and the Acer is 16:10. </s>
<s> The Acer is nice for playing videos and movies on which are starting to become mostly widescreen oriented, but much software is not especially games. </s>
<s> My Acer's 'biggest' widescreen resolution to where text is still somewhat easy to read is 1440X900. </s>
<s> However, I still find this kind of small for webpages. </s>
<s> I play a lot of the Grand Theft Auto games which do support widescreen, but I notice game performance takes a hit when running the games in widescreen mode as opposed to 4:3. </s>
<s> Then there are the physical sizes of the monitors. </s>
<s> The 19&quot; Acer is about .75&quot; shorter than my 17&quot; LG, but the Acer is about 3&quot; wider than the the LG. </s>
<s> The LG is 10.75&quot; tall and 13&quot; wide and the Acer is 10&quot; tall and 16&quot; wide. </s>
<s> At this point, I think I am going to exchange the Acer WS for another 17&quot; 4:3 monitor. </s>
<s> Might anyone have thoughts or opinions on the subject of widescreen and standard LCD monitors? </s>
<s> OK I figured out something. </s>
<s> Since I have an NVIDIA video card and the latest drivers, I was able to create a custom resolution of 1280x800 so webpages and text is much easier to read. </s>
<s> The directions are here... http://tinyurl.com/g4ehk But you have to use the CLASSIC NVIDIA Control Panel to do it. </s>
<s> Here are some standard aspect ratios for 16:10 computer monitors... 2560x1600 1920x1200 1680x1050 1440x900 1280x800 1024x640 800x500 </s>
<s> I went from a 19&quot; 4:3 Phillips monitor to a 20.1&quot; Viewsonic widescreen and I love it. </s>
<s> I am a pretty heavy gamer, and fortunately, many games support widescreen. </s>
<s> Some don't, but they don't look too bad being stretched out. </s>
<s> Most new games will support widescreen. </s>
<s> I increasingly see promo screenshots and E3 booths usiing widescreen for games, which leads me to believe they are developing more for it. </s>
<s> Movies are in widescreen, many types of applications can be viewed better in widescreen, and I am slowly noticing some websites starting to take advantage of it. </s>
<s> I would suggest that you keep the widescreen. </s>
<s> Use the native resolution, and adjust font sizes and magnification accordingly. </s>
<s> As for your game performance issues, it is probably because of the change in resolution. </s>
<s> Yes I have decided to keep the widescreen now that I was able to make the custom resolution and therefore make my icons and text bigger. </s>
<s> I think widescreen monitors are indeed the future, but it would be nice if video card manufacturers made drivers that supported standard resolution sizes I listed in a previous post in this thread. </s>
<s> With my 256 MB NVIDIA GeForce FX 5700LE, the only one listed was 1440x900, but once I found out how to make custom resolutions, 1280x800 looked much better. </s>
<s> I went from 17&quot; to 19&quot; Proview (both 4:3) and begun to love the big screen of 1280*1024, temporary I use my son's 17&quot; Flatron 795T which is a fantastic monitor, but I'm spoiled by the 19&quot;. </s>
<s> So now I'm looking for a widescreen 19&quot; or 20&quot; (the Acer seems nice), to fill my appetite. </s>
<s> If you are text orientated please check if the monitor can handle that on the resolution you're normally working with, at the other hand if you're a gamer, take a look at tiniest details that's important. </s>
<s> that's all... </s>
<s> I also went from a 19' to a 20.1' Viewsonic widescreen. </s>
<s> Its awesome! </s>
<s> Like the previous post said, most new games will support widescreen. </s>
<s> And best of all, if your a huge World of Warcraft gamer then you cant go wrong with a widescreen. </s>
<s> Looks amazing! </s>
<s> Dont forget that you must have a video card that will support the widescreen monitors. </s>
<s> The better the video card, the better performance. </s>
<s> I sure hope not, because I prefer a standard monitor! </s>
<s> Well tough luck because they are the future... HDTVs is definitely widescreen, and only a handfull are 4:3... Those who prefer standard monitors probably like watching videos in weird formats... With a widescreen monitor, I am able to have 2 web browsers open (or one webbrowser and one quarter TV (PIP) and one quarter webcam... With a 4:3 20 inch monitor, it really doesn't look so good with all the open windows... </s>
