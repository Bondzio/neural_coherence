i just built a pc with sata.
it has a thiner wire and is quiet.
it is the way to go.
with the default drivers etc.
it had a weird look in &quot;device manager&quot;.
it had some kind of crosslinked thing.
the speed of data transfer was unbelievably fast.
then i updated everything.
the bios, the motherboard chipset, and everything else i could find.
it looks normal now in &quot;device manager&quot; but now i'm lucky to get above ata66 speeds out of it.
