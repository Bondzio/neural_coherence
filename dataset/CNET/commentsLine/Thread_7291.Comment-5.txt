if you are only going to use it for email and internet and a few basic programs (no games or hd movies etc).
try a compact desktop or net top.
they sell for around 200-350 here in the uk which is about $300-$500.
however, if you want to spend slightly more and have a pretty good spec pc.
i have just custom built a pc with an amd athlon 2 quad core 2.6ghz and 4gb 800mhz ram for about 400 (~$600) minus hard drives and cd/dvd drives which i took from the old pc, because there is nothing wrong with them, and im guessing you could do the same (although you have to be careful because if they are ide, most modern motherboards only have one ide connector so you either have to buy an expensive sata-ide connector or try and find a motherboard with 2 ide connectors (unless you only have 2 drives, 1 ide cable has 2 other sockets on it), but i suspect you could buy a small hard drive and cd/dvd read/writer for about $100.
if you find an external drive thats cheaper than an internal drive, you can usually open them up and find a standard 3.5&quot; hard drive or 5.25&quot; disk drive.
i bought an external memorex cd/dvd burner and opened it up and found a standard 5.25&quot; drive with standard connectors.
