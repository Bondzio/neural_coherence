There are no user serviceable parts and we can't change the OS. If it's busted then its busted. I can only guess you are new to Windows Mobile/CE. I'm just a programmer (and more) and took the classes and seminars on Windows Mobile, Embedded XP and more. As I am not the person who created this image, I can't do much other than help you learn a bit about this issue. Bob
