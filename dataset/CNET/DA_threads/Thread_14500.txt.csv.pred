1.1.1	Hi , I was able to port forward for a long time until I got a new modem from comcast .	St
1.1.2	I never had to mess with the router settings until I recently found out that I could n't port forward any more .	St
1.1.3	When I try port forwarding on the router website ( 10.0.0.1 ) , I get an error message that states & quot ; Server IP Address is n't in LAN IP address subnet ! & quot ; What I enter : Common Services : Other Other Service : Minecraft Server Type : TCP/UDP Server IP Address : 192 168 1 13 ( My IPv4 address ) Starting Port : 25565 Ending Port : 25565 Any help would be appreciated !	St
1.1.4	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	It should not work .	St
1.2.2	I fear you have not read enough about IP networking but change your server at 192.168.1.13 to something in the 10.0.0.x range .	St
1.2.3	Maybe x is 13 ?	Ques
1.3.1	10.0.0.x is your LAN .	St
1.3.2	192.x.x.x is not .	Res
