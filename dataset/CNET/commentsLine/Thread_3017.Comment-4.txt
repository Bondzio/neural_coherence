i'm not sure of the difference between standby and sleep on the mac.
you can set the preferences to put the screen to sleep while still keeping the computer awake (under system preferences/energy saver).
in this scenario the jobs will print and you still save screen life.
if you send a print while the mac is asleep, it does save the jobs in a queue.
it will not automatically print them when you awaken the mac.
you need to go into the printer software and tell it to resume the print jobs.
(system preferences/print & fax/print queue...) one more thing i forgot to mention, the mac must be awake while running the setup wizard for bonjour on your other computers, or the pcs won't be able to find the printer.
there probably are other ways to set this up.
but just like you, i wasted hours trying to get windows and my router software to do the job with no success.
bonjour had it working in minutes.
and it's been reliable from day one.
try it and post your experience.
i doubt you'll be disappointed.
