1.1.1	I have an RCA cable modem ( Time Warner ) and a Netgear router which work flawlessly when I have the WiFi disabled .	St
1.1.2	In this configuration I have two computers wired to it - one Mac & one PC ( running Windows XP ) .	St
1.1.3	I 've been running this connection for over a year without any problems .	St
1.1.4	Recently I attempted to enable the WiFi but the modem and router would crash after a few minutes .	St
1.1.5	I was able to isolate the problem as being related to the PC ( at least I think so ) .	St
1.1.6	I discovered that with the WiFi enabled and only the Mac connected , the system will work fine .	St
1.1.7	But when I connect the PC , the modem & router will crash again .	St
1.1.8	I am restarting everything in order : modem - router - computers .	St
1.1.9	One thing I noticed it that , when the PC is turned off and the network cable is plugged into the router , the port light is on .	St
1.1.10	Not sure if this has anything to do with it , but it seems to be the only unusual thing I 've noticed .	St
1.1.11	Any help is greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	Why did n't you share the router 's model number ?	Ques
1.2.2	Maybe all you wanted to read was to go get a new router ?	Ques
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	The sarcasm is n't necessary .	St
1.3.2	Notice I did n't indicate the model number of the modem , either .	St
1.3.3	Maybe that implies I just want to hear & quot ; get a new modem & quot ; ?	Ques
1.3.4	For others reading this who may be able to offer helpful advice , the model number is WGR614v7 .	St
1.4.1	I 'm left to guess what your goals are when you post without the pertinent details .	St
1.4.2	NO SARCASM was intended but I tend to lay it out plainly since some need to hear ( read ) & quot ; get a new router. & quot ; - & gt ; The 614s are well known to me .	St
1.4.3	Here 's what I find works .	St
1.4.4	1 .	St
1.4.5	Use their latest firmware .	St
1.4.6	2 .	St
1.4.7	Use the default settings .	St
1.4.8	THEN ! ! !	St
1.4.9	3 .	St
1.4.10	Use WPA for the security .	St
1.4.11	Do not deploy with WEP , MAC filters , etc .	St
1.4.12	Stick to the basic 3 items I listed .	St
1.4.13	Consider locking the WIFI to just 802.11g since the mixed b/g mode is known to be less stable .	St
1.4.14	In closing , do not run any TORRENTS over wifi .	St
1.4.15	Good luck !	Polite
