Anyway, I hooked my PC to it with an S-Video cable but it's pretty blurry. Video looks terrific but anything else in Windows is terrible. Is there anything I can do to drastically improve quality? Is there a software to increase the quality or will my quality increase at all if I connect through YPbPr? if it will could you give me a link for a cheap yet good VGA &gt; YPbPR converter. Thanks, Maynard

Well I've found a few VGA &gt; RGB converters but I'm not too sure if that would resolve my issue. If anyone has used these before and could give me some insight on them that would be great.
