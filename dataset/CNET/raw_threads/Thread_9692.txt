When switching on I get the following message on the monitor. &quot;2. Digital Input In Power Save Mode, Press Computer Power Button Or Any Key On The Keyboard&quot; I press various keys and nothing happens, I connected our laptop to the monitor and the monitor is working. Do I need to replace my graphics card or is something more serious going on.

More clues such as the machine beeping, fans whrring or more would be needed but nothing of that is here. All it means is the PC didn't produce a signal. It can't be used to diagnose it further. Bob
