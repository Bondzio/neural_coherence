1.1.1	Hi , I am not able to come into one conclusion about the terms Provisioning and configuration & quot ; in networking/telecom .	St
1.1.2	Can you please anyone can help me to understand about the differences with some clear explanation .	Ques
1.1.3	My understanding : Configuration means : Setting systems or devices with some parameters Provisioning means : Giving/Getting the configuration information Please make me clear .	St
1.1.4	Regards , VenkatG	St
1.2.1	The reason you are having issues is it depends on the size of the project and the size of company .	St
1.2.2	When you have a single person doing both functions it is very blurry which function falls under which title .	St
1.2.3	When you have large complex project different people do different parts of the work so it is a little more clearly defined .	St
1.2.4	When you deal with a huge company say ATT you get whole organizations with those titles so they break this up even more .	St
1.2.5	So your definitions are correct for larger projects/companies .	St
