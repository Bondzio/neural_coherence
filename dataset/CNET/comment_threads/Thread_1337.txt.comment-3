Many years ago I used to use the do-it-yourself refill kits.
I always got great print quality and found they lasted just as long as the original manufacturer ink cartridges.
I can't find those where I live anymore so I've gone back to using the HP cartridges.
I don't do much printing so I don't mind paying the modest cartridge prices once or twice a year.
I've had everything from Epson to Lexmark and I won't own any printer other than an HP because they are cheaper to purchase cartridges for and I've always gotten excellent results with the many printers I've owned throughout the years.
