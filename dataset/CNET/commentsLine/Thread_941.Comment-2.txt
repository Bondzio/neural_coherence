i loaned my dsl modem to a neighbor for troubleshooting.
so while hookup is a breeze sometimes they must do that step if a wiring change is required in some external box.
but you should be able to install the thing.
but back to setup.
i can't count how many know knowthing about pppoe.
if you don't you may not be ready to install.
