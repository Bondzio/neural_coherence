my brother-in-law is getting dsl installed.
his dell computer doesn't have a nic card and instead of hooking it up usb i was going to install a nic that i have.
the question is, the dell site says that it uses a 120 pin nic card.
the ones i have are all 116 pin.
the people i have talked to, say they have never heard of the 120 pin.
is that just a type o or does dell have special card they use?.
thanks wayne
