I have already been advised about the canon pixma, so I will definitely check it out.
I live a little bit north of you in southern Spain!&quot; - Even so I should be able to get a reply about it when I check, Completely as an aside, I spent some time in Australia back in the 50's for a while and again in the 60's.
Down the East coast, visiting the G.B Reef, Townsville, Cairns.
and a survival course lasting 6 weeks from Rockhampton down to Gympie and on to Brisbane.
Enjoyed Surfers paradise etc etc) Regards, Colinito
