I'm not sure what info you'll need so this is all the info I can see on it. On the RAM: HYUNDAI KOREA HY57V658020B 0024B TC-75 on the sticker: HYM7V631601 HYUNDAI BTFG-75 BA KOREA PC133U-333-542-A1 0028 This was taken from an older model Dell Dimensions...1000 I believe. Most likely a fairly minimal amount of RAM, but some data I'd like to retrieve. Any help appreciated, thanks.

The PC133 line will reflect the speed and I presume the 333 afterwards might be the timing. This will be older...possibly 168 pin RAM. I'm thinking P-3 vintage maybe. In any event, it won't be of use to find another PC to plug it into for data retrieval. It will be referred to as &quot;volatile&quot; memory because, once power is withdrawn, all that's stored is lost.

I took it to a shop and they said that it wouldn't be worth it to fix it. So is all lost or is there any other way to retrieve just from this?
