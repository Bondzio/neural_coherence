It's the most common failure point for this machine.
The Duron is now fairly cheap compared to scrapping the machine.
Also, you did not tell if you are relying on Microsoft for motherboard drivers.
I can assure you that what's on the XP CD or at Microsoft is not proper.
Try a scan with EWIDO and HOUSECALL.
Leave nothing they find on the machine.
Best of luck, Bob
