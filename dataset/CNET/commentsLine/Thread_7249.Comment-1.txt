hi, i'm running vista on my new laptop, and trying to connect to my family's secured wireless network.
it won't connect unless i reboot the router while my laptop is up and running.
if the connection is interrupted for any reason, including turning off or hibernating the laptop, i can't get back on unless i unplug the router and plug it back in again.
two other computers on the network, 1 xp and 1 vista, have no trouble establishing connection at all.
has anyone heard of this problem before, and if so, how do i fix it?
