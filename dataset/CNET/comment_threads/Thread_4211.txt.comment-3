Robert, pretty much pointed out buy brand name discs.
Don't be cheap maybe on a sale or two, buy what you need.
I tend to favor Philips and TEAC though many other names do fine.
DVDs are in the 4.7gb range for now, unless you get into Blu-Ray, etc., but that's a costly alternative.

DVD will do fine.
Remember to treat critical DVDs like your new born, with care.
besides writing the data, be sure to verify!
