i experienced such case 3 months ago.
this is what i did: 1. make sure all hardware all ok. 2. connect the external hd to another pc (xp may have a greater chance.)
3. start &gt; run &gt; type cmd to go to command mode.
4. type chkdsk /f x: where x: is your external hd.
5. follow the instructions from chkdsk command.
that is it.
good luck.
