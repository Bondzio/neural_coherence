1.1.1	I have a model 5100a HP Photosmart Scanner which worked fine until I got a new computer .	St
1.1.2	Now the SCSI card that came w/the scanner wo n't fit this machine .	St
1.1.3	I have looked quite a few places on the net plue my own computer person - no luck .	St
1.1.4	HP wants to sell me the complete kit for $ 80.00 - I said no .	St
1.1.5	Here 's what I need : SCSI PCI 50 pin card - it goes inside the computer & attaches to the motherboard - which in my case is on the side of the computer tower not the bottom .	St
1.1.6	Someone suggested I get a used HP Photosmart scanner which is USB compatible - that would be truly easier however I do not have money to buy another scanner ( this one does my slides & negs & up to 5x7 prints - is NOT a flatbed scanner ) .	St
1.1.7	I really need this scanner - have lost business because I can not deliver scans for comp images .	St
1.1.8	I expect to pay between $ 15 .	St
1.1.9	to $ 25.00 for this card ( probably ) if it can be found .	St
1.1.10	Thanks to anyone who can help !	Ques

1.2.1	Most will have to find an older computer to scan with and network it over to the newer machines .	St
1.2.2	The pair of network cards and cable to do this is abotu 20 dollars at places like Fry 's .	St
1.2.3	Othere will scream at the cost of the SCSI card kits and then will get & quot ; really mad & quot ; when they learn that the scanner is not supported on the new OS or find another problem .	St
1.2.4	I 've learned to never help a person move a SCSI scanner to another machine .	St
1.2.5	While that sounds mean , it 's better to have the person mad at HP or someone else .	St
1.2.6	I hope you understand this issue .	St

1.3.1	You could probably buy something like the Adaptec 2906 controller , that is PCI and works with almost all scanners ... .BUT ... .the cable you have may or may not work and between the cost of the controller and a new cable a replacement scanner may be the same price .	St
1.3.2	The 2906 has an end connector that looks just like a parallel port connector ( 25pin Female ) what cable comes with the 5100 .	St
1.3.3	You might find a used 2906 on Ebay in your price range .	St
1.4.1	As Bob indicates , migrating scanners to new OS can be very problematic .	St
1.4.2	First check the HP site and see if they have drivers for the scanner for your new OS which you did not mention .	Sug
1.4.3	If they do , download them and move on to aquiring a PCI SCSI Host Adapter or something like the USB TO SCSI-2 ADAPTER CABLE offered at Cables to Go ( you can locate similar adapters at various prices by other manufacturers ) or a SCSI to parallel port adapter Jeff 's suggestion to browse eBay for a host adapter is good too because even old SCSI Host Adapters are not cheap .	St
1.4.4	Here is one place where you can sometimes find older adapters cheap - http : //www.hitechcafe.com/eShop/default.asp Once you have found one do not be too upset if it does n't work with your particular scanner because SCSI can be very & quot ; picky & quot ; .	St
1.4.5	Check the manufacturer of your old host and chances are that a Host made by them that can be fitted to your new compter will work .	St
1.4.6	Bob 's suggestion of retaining your old computer and keeping the scanner atached to it for use is probably the cheapest and most certain of success .	Sug
1.4.7	Good luck .	Polite
