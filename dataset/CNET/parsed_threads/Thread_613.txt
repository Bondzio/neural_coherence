<s> What's your opinion on defragging RAM memory? </s>
<s> Seems to be a lot of utilities out there for it, but is it necessary? </s>
<s> Does it really work? </s>
<s> The era of Ram-doublers and such were pretty much shown to be nothing but a scam. </s>
<s> Instead, simple reading of the Optimizing Windows or the Memory articles at http://www.aumha.org/articles.htm would pay off well if you run Windows. </s>
<s> Linux has its own memory management and has improved steadily. </s>
<s> Even with that, some may find such to be useful, but I've never used any except to debunk the software. </s>

<s> If you have win98 or better, you really don't need any &quot;ram managers&quot; or such as the benefit isn't worth loading the pgm.. Actually, when you remove the pgm. </s>
<s> the ram space it used is returned to the system is a plus. </s>
<s> If you run win95, you should get some improvemnt and even then, why are you using win95. </s>
<s> Unless, you system uis so screwed-up or being doggy, get a systems ultiies that clean the registry and defrag the HDs for a better result of overall system performance. </s>
<s> If you haven't already, increase &quot;physical ram&quot; while costs are very low as a true system benefit. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> Kind of what I was thinking. </s>
<s> Not as knowlegeable on memory as I should be. </s>
<s> I am running Win98, 224MB RAM. </s>
<s> Not really doggy, but seeing all these downloads made me wonder. </s>
<s> Thanks for the replies! </s>
