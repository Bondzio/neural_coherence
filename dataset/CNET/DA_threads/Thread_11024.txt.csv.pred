1.1.1	Hi, I have a hard drive IDE , but I cant access to my data so I decided 2 format it and recover it after that,but I cant format it .	St
1.1.2	please help to solve this problem.	Sug
1.1.3	Thank U.	St
1.2.1	I assume you know that once you have reformatted a hard drive there will not be any data to recover?	St
1.2.2	Or did I not understand your post correctly?	St
1.2.3	Tell us more.	St
1.2.4	What are you attempting to do, and why?	Ques
1.2.5	Which OS, and what make/model computer?	St
1.2.6	Is this hard drive the one with your Operating System, (OS), on it?	St
1.2.7	If so, how are you trying to reformat it?	Ques
1.2.8	Generally, you cannot reformat a hard drive which has the OS installed, whilst you are logged in to that OS.	St
1.2.9	The OS will not let itself be deleted like that.	St
1.2.10	You will need to format it using tools with the OS not loaded.	St
1.2.11	Why can't you access the data?	St
1.2.12	What error messages do you see?	St
1.2.13	Mark	St
1.3.1	You offer nothin in how or what the PC is.	Ques
1.3.2	If you simply plan to format, I suggest now you google and then use KILLDISK or DBAN pgms.	St
1.3.3	that totally wipe out the HD.	St
1.3.4	Then, reformat using the windoze OS disc, I suspect to reuse the HD.	St
1.3.5	There will be no data to recover unless, the data is on another HD or partition(?).	St
1.3.6	tada ------Willy	St
1.4.1	Is this an EXTERNAL hard drive?	St
1.4.2	Very confusing post.	St
1.5.1	Now I have XP but the speed is very low so I wanna instal 98 and I need the driver.	St
1.6.1	Today if you want to do that you research using google.	St
1.6.2	Sometimes you find drivers, sometimes you don't.	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	Your question seems unrelated to the subject of this thread.	St
1.7.2	Please start a new thread and be sure to tell more about your hardware and what driver you need.	Sug
