really shouldn't be oozing out but???
thethermakl paste coating should be very thin.
too big a glob can cause to impede heat transfer rather than help it.
maybe get another hsf with a larger hs and faster fan [more noise lol][make sure it will fit.
it just seems that possibly the fan might not be running fast enough.
the micro atx case is rather small so i can see why cooling can be a problem.
the fact that case open and external fan didn't keep it cool enough, does sound unusual.
don't have too powerful a fan [your house fan] blow directly at the cpu's hsf because it could actually slow the hsf down.
have it blow on the video card and memory sticks.
there are other reasons for a system shutting down.
one is the bulging or leaking capacitors.
