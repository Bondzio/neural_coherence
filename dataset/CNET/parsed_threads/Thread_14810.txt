<s> Please, I would like to have some assistance for my hard drive that is no longer being recognised by my computer. </s>
<s> One thing before you offer advice - please give advce in simple English. </s>
<s> This is not an ego trip or an exercise in how much big noting you can do - if you want to help, then help. </s>
<s> If you are going to speak in double dutch, then move on. </s>
<s> I know this sounds harsh, but I am sick of reading web sites that say they offer help, but I end up more confused. </s>
<s> I have a HP Presario Computer operating Windows XP. </s>
<s> I bought what I think is a Maxtor 200gb External Drive. </s>
<s> The inside shows it is a Diamond Max 10 Model: 6L200p0 200GB PATA 133 HDD. </s>
<s> Recently the drive when turned on starts to click rather loudly, like it is trying to turn over or be recognised. </s>
<s> Now sometimes it does get recognised but only fater a very long time. </s>
<s> When it doesn't get recognised, it clicks ever say 8-10 seconds and the blue light at the opposite end to the power cord stats to go light pink/purple colour. </s>
<s> When I go into My Computer the drive does not show up at all. </s>
<s> When the system does recognise the drive it will eventually stop working or stop the computer from functioning. </s>
<s> When the computer sense the drive it slows down and actually prevents other pages opening up and stops other applications from commencing. </s>
<s> Now I read somewhere that this could be due to a recent upgrade that Microsoft had recently. </s>
<s> I have removed the upgrades that happened in August. </s>
<s> So any help would be appreciated, and as I said and think - no program to test errors will work, given that computer doesn't recognise the machine. </s>
<s> The cords all work too, as I have tested them on other machines / devices. </s>
<s> Cheers </s>
<s> A HD should be silent, or almost. </s>
<s> Any audible &quot;clicking&quot; is, to me, evidence of a damaged or worn head and/or arm. </s>
<s> Has the unit been bounced or mishandled in any way? </s>
<s> My thoughts: replace the drive. </s>
<s> If it's in warranty, send it back. </s>
<s> If you have any critical data on the drive, send it back as Maxtor may be able to recover it for you. </s>

<s> The drive has likely died. </s>
<s> The good news is that you often can replace the drive inside for not much. </s>

<s> Only consolation ... might be drive replacement if still under warranty. </s>
<s> Here's hoping you had copies of any important data elsewhere. </s>
