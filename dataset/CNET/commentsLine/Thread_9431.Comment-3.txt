did not change anything.
i do use msi afterburner and my temps never get higher than 70 running any game.
so temperature is not an issue.
plus this happens the moment i get into the game, so there is a very small window for my gpu to reach overheated temps, which i don't think is happening.
i really can't find anyone else who has had this exact problem in my video before.
highly frustrating!
