<s> I just hooked up my new Dell 9100 with the 1704fpt ultra sharp monitor and have a few questions. </s>
<s> What steps do you take to set it to clear type? </s>
<s> How can I adjust the screen so that certain items fill the whole screen, such as Internet Explorer and mostly when I am web surfing? </s>
<s> I currently have it set up with DVI and resolution set at the max 1280x1024. </s>
<s> I am guessing that if I reduce this, this may get my picture to full screen but will I reduce clarity alot? </s>
<s> Also, by using my DVI connection, do I put a big drag on my video card (Radeon 256mb x600)? </s>
<s> Thank you for any help </s>
<s> Right click on desktop and hit Properties/Appearance/Effects. </s>
<s> If set to &quot;standard&quot; select &quot;Clear Type&quot; and make sure box is checked to use that setting. </s>
<s> This will improve text dramatically on an LCD. </s>
<s> As for IE web pages. </s>
<s> You can customize some things with the Tools functions but not everything. </s>
<s> You can adjust the desktop icon size if you find them too small. </s>
<s> There are also &quot;Accessibility&quot; options designed for certain impairments but probably not useful. </s>
<s> LCDs have their learning curve as they don't have the ability to do much with screen resolution without degrading the image. </s>
