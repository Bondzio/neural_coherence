hi, recently i turned on my pc and found that it wont read the zip disk it had inserted.
i tried to put another blank zip disk and still no recognition of having a disk inserted.
i was told it may be because its dirty.
i was told to get a zip cleaning disk, but so far i havent seen one for sale.
could you guys help me on this one?
by the way i got a pc with windows me.
thanks for any help provided
