is the pc xp home or xp pro?
this is too much for me to get into here, but basically, you want to create an account for the laptop on your desktop pc.
setup an account on the pc for the laptop, example: laptop give the account a password!
setup a user account on the laptop called ''laptop'' and give it the same password as the account on the pc!
from the pc you will need to give ''laptop'' permission to access the folders in question.
that's all i can really get into online.
if you need help, invite your local 7 year old over for milk and cookies.
