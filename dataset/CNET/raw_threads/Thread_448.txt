I'm looking for the following features: 1. Right side window (which means the mobo will be inverted) 2. Four USB connections (preferably near the top) that can be accessed without opening a door/panel 3. Two 3.5 external bays (one for a floppy for SATA & one for a card reader) 4. Black, Silver or 2-tone 5. Price range up to $139 6. Power supply is optional 7. Oh, and something unique, but not TOO flashy or dorky! LOL I've found a few, but nothing that matches perfectly. Two of the AeroCools come close, the Masstige and the Spiral Galaxies. The Silverstone Temjin TJ06 comes mighty close and the Enermax CS-718 looks VERY good. Since you guys are the experts, I thought I'd turn to you and see if there are any deals to be had out there that fit this criteria. Thanks!

Thus the force to move the heated air is generated in the vertical legs of the heat pipes. Inverting them would cause the flow in the wrong direction.
