Two links with some info: http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/helpandsupport/learnmore/systemrestore.mspx http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306084 Note that this feature (if enabled, which it is by default) takes a seizable amount of hard disk space in a 'folder' called System Volume Information.
You can't see how much it is using the standard tools.
To delete everything and start anew (but that means you can't go back before now) turn it off and on again, as described in http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 Hope this helps.
