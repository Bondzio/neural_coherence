a friend of mine, has been checking out my hp compaq and he says that my hard drive is fried.
he took my hard drive out and exchanged it for another which worked fine.
now it looks like i either need a new computer or a new hard drive.
i don't really want a new computer; i love this one.
but my friend says that if i get a new hard drive i will have to replace my os with another windows xp.
is this true?
why can't i use my replacement disc's on a new hard drive?
