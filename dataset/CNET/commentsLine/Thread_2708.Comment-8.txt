as to the storage issue.
i already noted that we get many days out of a 40gb drive and 10 cameras.
if we get that, wouldn't this be a good answer to your 2 camera recording?
if you won't take my warning about the software issue, at least get it in writing what your return options are since it's likely you may not believe this issue till you experience it first hand.
good luck with this.
