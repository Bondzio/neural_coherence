Hi guys, My drive gets corrupted and unreadable repeatedly and it's driving me nuts.
I was never able to format this hard disk successfully through disk management or the command prompt window.
So i ran the HITACHI Drive Fitness Test (disk in good condition), had the disk erased, and used Maxtor's Maxblast to partition and format.
But now whatever files i transfer into this particular drive gets corrupted instantly.
It either doesn't play or open fully.
And after moving some files into the drive and restarting a couple of times, either of the follow messages shows when i attempt to access the drive: - The file or directory is corrupted and unreadable - The disk structure is corrupted and unreadable I'm not worried about recovering the data now... i just want the damn drive to stop getting corrupted/unreadable/unstructured.
Anyone know what's wrong?
