hi, i have a custom built computer with an intel pentium d processor, ati radeon x800 video card, a 250 gig hdd, and an intel mobo.
my computer worked for 3 months until one day, upon turning it on, both my mobo and my power supply fried.
i replaced both, and it started working again.
however, 6 hours after it started working, it just turned off.
it had no response to anything.
i replaced the power supply with a more powerful one from a amore reliable company, and now, wheenever i turn on the power supply the computer's case fans and the video card's fan will click on for a second.
at the same time, there is a strange clicking noise that the computer makes.
what could be the problem?
is it a grounding issue?
or is it something else i haven't thought of?
