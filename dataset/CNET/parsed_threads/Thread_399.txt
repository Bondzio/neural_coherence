<s> I bought a computer from Cyberpower. </s>
<s> It keeps killing video cards. </s>
<s> It seems like a cooling problem. </s>
<s> The case temps range from 22c to 24c. </s>
<s> It came with 2 cooling fans in the case. </s>
<s> Would more fans help? </s>
<s> Do you think it might be something else? </s>
<s> (Motherboard, bios, etc..) Any suggestions? </s>
<s> (5 times) NVIDIA Geforce-4 TI4200 128MB DDR 8X AGP w/ TV-Out & DVI (Current) Albatron Ti4280EP (This one lasted almost 1 year)but it's failing now </s>
<s> Have you replaced the power supply? </s>
<s> the computer is only a little over a year old. </s>
<s> I just pulled up my invoice. </s>
<s> It's an ATX 430W P4 POWER SUPPLY WITH DUAL FANS. </s>
<s> Retail is approx 80 bucks. </s>
<s> I wouldn't think it's going bad already. </s>
<s> If the computer were 5-6 years old, and it was a cheap power supply, maybe. </s>
<s> I am getting no indications (random reboots, smell, sounds, etc) that it's going bad. </s>
<s> You are in a situation where you have to swap hardware until you figure out what is wrong with the system. </s>
<s> the most likely cause of a video card going bad, over and over, is incorrect voltage from the motherboard, and that is most likely due to a faulty power supply. </s>
<s> You can get something like a Sparkle power supply, 450Watts or so, for around $50. </s>
<s> That is the first step in trying to figure out where the problem is. </s>
<s> The only other thing to replace is the motherboard. </s>
<s> Those are the only 2 things that really could cause what you are seeing. </s>
