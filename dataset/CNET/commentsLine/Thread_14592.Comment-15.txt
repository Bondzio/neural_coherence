i don't know how much you can afford to do, but if there's any way you can, get rid of windows me.
microsoft gave up on it a long time ago.
people with windows 98 second edition are better off.
if you could afford to buy a windows xp home upgrade version on ebay that would be the best route.
i hope you are using the 30gb hard drive as your primary hard drive; if not, install the xp on it (using ntfs file system), install your applications, then copy your data from the 6.4gb drive onto the 30gb drive, then low level format the 6.4 and remove it from your system.
your motherboard probably supports ata66 or ata100, and the 6.4gb drive only supports ata33, at best, and it's not going to give you optimal performance.
make sure the cd-rom or cd-rw drive is on the secondary ide channel by itself, not sharing a cable with the hard drive.
second, upgrade your memory to 512mb or more, preferably with matched memory (2 identical sticks of 256mb or 1 512mb)- you could start with 1 256mb stick and buy a second later if you buy a commonly available brand like crucial, kingston, pny, etc.
third, buy a faster video card on ebay- your motherboard probably supports 4x agp so look for a 64mb or 128mb video card that goes up to 4x, which should be pretty inexpensive since most common video cards now are 8x agp or faster.
if your board has integrated video, buy a fast pci video card of a model similar to the 4x agp cards you see on ebay, and disable the onboard video.
lastly, if you have the money you might research your motherboard and upgrade the cpu to the fastest model supported.
of course, if you're not a particularly diligent shopper, you can spend enough money doing these things to buy a new system, so do your homework and shop wisely.
