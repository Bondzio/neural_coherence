any ram speed (in your case 4200) lower than the motherboard bus speed (&gt;4200 which happens to be ddr2 667 vs your ddr2 533) is going to create instability, lots of crashing is going to happen... it's like your ram a souped-up car, running on a 1 lane street (the motherboard) which will mean frequent shutdown, bsod, etc.. i tried running slower ram on faster bus speed board, never realising it until i've checked the specs of the board minimum bus speed for ram, and when i took out the slower ram, the system became stable... here's the link regarding ram and their bus/ i/o speed so you'll know which ram model to lookout for
