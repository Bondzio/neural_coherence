1.1.1	Win98SE P3 800 Mhz 256 RAM ; Mitsumi CR4804te CD/RW This has been a sturdy machine -- but a couple of lock ups and one blue screen happened.	St
1.1.2	could only restart each with the longheld press on the power button.	St
1.1.3	Now I can not play or explore a CD, though the D drive is visible in My Computer, and device manager sees no problem, functioning normally.	St
1.1.4	have already dealt the *.vxd's that can cause conflicts.	St
1.1.5	I searched for newer drivers but there is nothing newer than version 3.0d as far as I can tell.	St
1.1.6	What else can i check?	St
1.1.7	Faldown	St
1.2.1	My dad's machine had from memory that same drive.	St
1.2.2	Its dead now and while dieing would cause lockup.	St
1.2.3	Windows also thought it worked.	St
1.2.4	Try another drive.	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Hi Bob (When the machine locked up the first two times, the D drive was not in use.	St
1.3.2	I was trying to open a CD when it did lock the third time.	St
1.3.3	Now it is working.	St
1.3.4	I did not do anything much; just tried to scan the registry for errors -- none.	St
1.3.5	Then i thought to use the soundcard to play the CD -- Creative Live!	St
1.3.6	has a Playcenter which can find music sources.	St
1.3.7	The CD/RW drive played.	St
1.3.8	Then I re-installed WMPlayer 9 (which uses very little resources on this machine)and it started to find the songs too.	St
1.3.9	-- I can not explain the inaccessibility -- it was not just WMP because I could not open the drive through My Computer either.	St
1.3.10	You still believe that the drive is dying?	St
1.3.11	I don't play CDs much on it, nor use it as a ROM, but I do burn occasionally, with excellent results.	St
1.3.12	I realise it's now 5 years old, but it has not done that many miles.	St
1.3.13	Cheers Faldown	St
