As the subject title says, I'm trying to build a good gaming computer, and I don't meant top of the line, just something that will allow me to run games such as oblivion/call of duty 4/bioshock with ease.
Only problem is, I don't know a whole lot about computers as far as compatibility goes with the hardware.
So I'm getting my computer off a site and I'll just list what I have in the works and if anybody has free time, I'd appreciate the input.
