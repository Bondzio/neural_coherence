''agu'' slot?
i think you mean ''agp.''
what is the manufacturer name and model name of your motherboard?
what are the rest of the components in your computer build?
you won't use more than 2gb of ram for gaming, so getting a 4gb motherboard is not an issue.
if you pay more for a motherboard with a pci express x16 expansion slot, you likely can get a more powerful pci express x16 video card for a price less than a comparable agp video card.
