i have a 500gb seagate external hard drive (part number: 9cz2a3-501) that i wish to partition to transfer about 6gb of files from my windows 7 home premium laptop to my home built ubuntu 10.04 desktop.
however, whenever i try to shrink the 465gb (formatted) partition down 10gb to 455gb, in the windows partitioning tool in disk management and other third party programs, i always get an error, and i cannot partition the drive.
the windows tool even took away 100gb of storage, which i had to gain back using partition wizard home edition.
using this program, i was going to try to shrink the volume and format as ext3.
i know i have enough room; i am only using about 100-150gb for a system backup, with few other files on it, so i have about 300gb free space when formatted.
i get an error (in partition wizard), something like 'not enough memory', and in disk management, something like not enough space to complete this.'
can you recommend what i could do to partition this drive?
or do you have a better (yet free) idea to transfer these files?
thanks.
