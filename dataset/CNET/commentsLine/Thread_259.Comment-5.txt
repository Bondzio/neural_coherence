the two ways to see if this is a windows issue or a hardware issue: - try to boot from a windows xp cd (be sure the bios is set to boot from cd) - if that doesn't work, it's hardware - if your machine is able to boot from usb, you can find a linux distro to put on it (i don't know which one, but they do exist) and see if they work from linux and generally, there's no need to format.
the windows xp setup offers 3 options: (1) on top of the existing installation, (2) delete windows folder, keep data and (3) delete everything (= format).
generally, #2 suffices.
there are known causes for disfunctioning cd's.
they include a history of packet writing software or install and incorrect uninstall of burning software and upper and lower filters that came into the registry somehow.
if you tell more, somebody might be able to help.
