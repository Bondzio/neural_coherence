1.1.1	Hi, I have just built myself a new computer system.	St
1.1.2	Everything works great except when I try to watch DVDs on it.	St
1.1.3	I put in a DVD, and sometimes it gets as far as letting me choose a program to open it with (e.g.	St
1.1.4	WinDVD) and other times it doesn't even get that far, then the computer freezes and displays the blue screen of death which includes &quot;bad_pool_header&quot; while it does a memory dump.	St
1.1.5	The windows &quot;problem reports and solutions&quot; page says that it is a problem with the device driver, which I'm assuming is the driver for the DVD drive?	St
1.1.6	But how would this be the problem if windows installed it automatically when I setup the computer?	St
1.1.7	The DVD drive is a Sony NEC Optiarc and is connected by a normal IDE cable to the motherboard.	St
1.1.8	I was thinking about trying to see if everything would work ok if I installed Windows XP instead, but preferably I don't want to have to dual boot each time I want to watch a DVD!	St
1.1.9	It is annoying.	St
1.1.10	Has anyone seen this problem before?	Ques
1.1.11	Could it be a damaged motherboard/cable/DVD drive or is it more likely just to be a software problem?	St
1.1.12	Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated!	St
1.1.13	If anymore information is needed just ask.	St
1.1.14	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	This is more likely to be an issue with the DVD player software or other drivers for video, sound card or chipset.	St
1.2.2	To help figure out which try to play the DVD with VLC PLAYER (google.com) Bob	St
