i built my own home theater pc back in 2003/2004 when windows mce was in its infancy.
it is presently connected to my philips 42&quot; lcd and my 5.1 technics stereo receiver.
i bought a beautifull piano-black htpc case, a small asus p4b-533 motherboard, a 2.4ghz p4 processor, a hauppauge wintv tuner card and couple of hard drives.
i use it with a wireless keyboard and the media center remote cotrol.
i've upgraded it recently (windows vista home premium, 2gb ram, newer video card.
my suggestions?
do your homework and buy a case that &quot;doesn't look like a computer&quot;.
that's what i did.
it will blend right into your living/family room.
get a decent video card that can connect to the back of your tv.
use the best technology possible (dvi or hdmi).
if your tv doesn't have a dvi connector, you can buy a dvi to hdmi cable.
that's what i did.
if you want to use your computer as a tivo to record and playback recorded tv, do your research and buy a tv tuner card.
mine is old but still works.
the downside is mine only displays regular tv resolution when recording tv shows.
newer one will allow you to record hdtv programming.
for audio, connect your soundcard to your stereo or tv.
