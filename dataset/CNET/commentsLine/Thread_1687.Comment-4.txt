your response shows that dealing with scrambled hard disk contents may outstrip your current pc repair skills.
in short, installing an os is a series of steps that for microsoft windows is vaguely documented and doesn't seem to be repeatable across your machine and others.
in the end, the result is usually you flip the machine on and you see &quot;windows.&quot; or the os you elected to install... what you do next depends on what you need to do and your capability.
in your first post, it was unclear if the machine finally died.
