getting that motherboard is a bad idea.
try downloading the nvidia drivers from the chaintech website?
are you sure you downloaded the drivers for the motherboard right?
if the motherboard did not have the driver cd, return it.
it could be because you ordered the oem version that&#347; why.
when you should have gotten the retai.
