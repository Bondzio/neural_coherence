<s> hey whats up guys? </s>
<s> i got alittle problem on my hands that i knew you all could help me with and that is if i should get a new 7800 GTX to SLI since i alrdy have one or get this physx card which looks pretty amazing. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> ...you really need either one of them. </s>
<s> Are your framerates so bad with a 7800GTX that you need another one? </s>
<s> I wouldn't buy a physics card until there are quite a few games that support it, and until the price goes down. </s>
<s> The 7800GTX is still a good card; wait until Vista comes out, and then get a DX10 card. </s>
<s> remember that if you get the physx card it will slow down your games framerates. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> ....I've yet to see a single FPS test, where during an in game explosion, a PhysX equipped system didn't slow down hugely. </s>
<s> http://www.behardware.com/articles/622-5/preview-ageia-physx.html http://techreport.com/reviews/2006q2/physx/index.x?pg=5 Maybe they need to drop the &quot;accelerator&quot; tag (slower with, than without) and adopt an &quot;additional sofware features with our hardware&quot; label. </s>
<s> I'd hate to think what will happen when Unreal 3 multiplayer arrives and rocket lauching frags fests are the norm, when current (limited) testing shows even a single explosion has a negative impact on frame rates. </s>
<s> Screen shots with bits fying everywhere look nice though....even if those bits fade after a few second and don't stay as game litter. </s>
<s> Maybe thing might pick up when M$/nVidia/ATI/Havoc also get into the physics game.... GeeBee. </s>
<s> Unless you're going to take advantage of them. </s>
<s> The PhysX card only makes a difference for games specifically designed to support it. </s>
<s> If you don't have those games, then you will be wasting your money. </s>
<s> SLI is normally only useful for those people with mid-range cards who want to get extra performance or for extreme power users who actually push their graphics beyond what the existing card is capable of. </s>
<s> If the rest of your computer is as &quot;beefy&quot; as your video card, it's unlikely that you typically push the capabilities of your high-end video card, so SLI would be a waste. </s>
<s> Sure, you could go from 120 fps to 150 fps for some games, but so what? </s>
