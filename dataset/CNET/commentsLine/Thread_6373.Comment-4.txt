to manually pop open a cd drive, take a small pin or a small safety pin (open), or a very thin paper clip, unfolded, and insert it into the tiny little hole located somewhere on the cd drive's face.
look carefully, almost every cd-rom/writer drive has one for opening the drive manually.
when you locate the hole, press the pointed object into the hole carefully, while at the same time, pressing the button you press to pop open the cd drive normally.
it should pop open, no problem.
i hope this helps.
(the exploding cd in drive has happened to me too, i feel your pain...)
