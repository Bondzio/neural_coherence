a friend has a laptop and wants me to add an external hdd (via usb) to it.
it's a relatively old system (166 mgz) running win98.
48 megs of ram my question is what would be the limit of hard drive this system could detect.
he's looking at buying a 6 gig drive.
is there a general rule of thumb to determine this systems' hd limit or would i need to provide more info?
thank you
