According to all the graphs I have seen XP Pro's performance peaks at between 310 and 320 meg of RAM. Save yourself some frustration and stuff as much RAM as you can into your system. I am running 2megs of DDR2 and absolutely enjoy having RAM to burn.

I am going to buy a new pc with maybe 256 Mb of Ram and a P IV 2.6 Ghz intel processor.In a reply to my post in the newbies forum, I was told to upgrade to 512 Mb.I personally think it is a great solution.But I am going to use my pc for programming and all that stuff.Would the RAM make much of a difference given the processor speed and OS being XP home ?
