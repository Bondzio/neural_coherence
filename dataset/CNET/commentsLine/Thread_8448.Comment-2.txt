while you can use the /3gb switch to tell xp or vista to let applications use more than 2gb ram the brutal truth is there is so little payback that i'd not do this.
and yes you get to (in most machines) buy a pair of 2gb sticks and live with 2.9 to 3.5gb being reported or usable with the windows you have.
i wouldn't.
