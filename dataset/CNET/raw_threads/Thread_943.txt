Windows Media Centre Edition works fine without any TV tuner(s) installed. For those who do want a Media Centre OS, and may wish to add some TV functionality later, it can handle up to 4 tuners (2 analogue + 2 digital). Conversely not all TV tuner's need MCE, and ship with W98/XP software and drivers. There are also those TV tuners which only ship with MCE software too, so consider check carefully, if anyone's thinking of doing so. GeeBee.
