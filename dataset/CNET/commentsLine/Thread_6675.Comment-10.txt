usb legacy devices turned on, i can use the keyboard via adapter to choose safe mode or normal mode.
so the adapter working.
i turned off uac, restarted the computer.
windows recogniozed the adapter but couldn't install it from internet or from the computer.
in the device manager it's named: &quot;ps2 to usb converter&quot; with yellow exclamation mark.
in the properties under general tab: &quot;a driver (service) for this device has been disabled.
an alternate driver may be providing this functionality.
(code 32) click 'check for solutions' to send data about this device to microsoft and to see if there is a solution available.&quot; driver tab: driver provider: &quot;unknown&quot; driver date: &quot;not available&quot; driver version: &quot;not available&quot; digital signer: &quot;not digital signed&quot; when i press on &quot;check for solutions...&quot;, i get message to download: &quot;update for windows vista, 32-bit versions (kb940199)&quot;.
i downloaded it, and nothing happened.
