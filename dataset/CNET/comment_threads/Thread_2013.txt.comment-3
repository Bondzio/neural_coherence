I go through all the diagnostics, but they all assume the drive shows up in the disk utility (it doesn't).
There is one trouble shooting section on what to do if it doesn't show up in the disk utility: go to system profiler and check to see if the machine sees it plugged in.
I go to the system profiler in the USB section and the drive doesn't show up there, either.
The lights are on and blinking (at least for a while).
Just plugging in one of the USB's results in beeping, which is normal, I've been told.
I'm taking it back and trying another brand.
This is ridiculous.
