My problems are that I can't connect to my DSL connection, I might be picking up the neighbours broadband connection and I can't file and print share.
As well, when I created a netsetup file (with the Network Setup Wizard) on my Windows XP Laptop my Windows 2000 computer told me that netsetup was not compatible with Windows 2000.
However, I finally got Windows XP so I'm going to install that and then reset the router.
Hopefully then I will be able to set up the network.
Thanks for your help anyways.
