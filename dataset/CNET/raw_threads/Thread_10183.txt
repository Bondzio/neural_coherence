My Inspiron 8200 laptop is a few years old, so no USB 2.0. Instead, I use a PC card with firewire ports to connect to the HD. The computer recognizes the device and it pops up as a drive in the device manager, but it doesn't display an accessible icon in My Computer. Does someone know a way that I can get into this thing? Thanks, Bryant

I have exactly the same problem with a Maxtor 250 Gb HD in an ICY BOX enclosure, XP, firewire-access and motherboard doesn't support USB2 either. The disc is still an active disc in my system managment and disc managment but I had no access to it. But NTSF/FAT32 isn't recognised ... A quick format solves the problem temporary. But the problem will occur again soon. I guess the problem is on a driver-level or BIOS-level, recognising the disc. If you find a solution u can mail me .. christianblock01@yahoo.com.
