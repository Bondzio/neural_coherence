The part number for the power supply in your system is P/N 3N200 Power Supply, 160 Watt, Power Factor Correction, 3.3V, 20PN, 1 Watt, KILLERBEE The number to spare parts at Dell is 1-800-357-3355.You can also go to the link below. http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/DellPartsFamily.aspx?c=us&cs=19&l=en&s=dhs&redirect=1 Thanks, Jesse

I am a little hesitant to do that because I was told that the Dell power supplies for that model have a flaw. The flaw is that they run hot and burn up the copper wire. I was hoping to find a better power supply that does not have that issue. Thank you again at least the dell power supply is better then none at all right.... Thank you again and have a great day!!
