In short, I just go to http://www.crucial.com so it's not my problem if it doesn't work.
Or I just get it from the vendor of the rest of the parts.
Piecemealing it out like this often results in a pile of parts you get to figure out which is the wrong part or if you flubbed the Power Supply rating.
