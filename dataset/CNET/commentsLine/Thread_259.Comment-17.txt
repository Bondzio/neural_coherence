now that it sounds like the usual, i have now shared a try this but in your reply you don't note the outcome.
we have 16 posts here.
how many to see if this is the real issue?
yes, there is a difference between a self help forum (here) and a technical support forum.
most of it has to do with the owner having to get out and push to the solution.
tech support sites would take control of the issue.
