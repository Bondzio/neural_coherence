<s> I have a problem. </s>
<s> I have a few Hard Disks (no OS's, storage only) that need good compression but I was wondering if there are any better programs/utilities that do a better job then windows built in one? </s>
<s> I have managed to remove all absolute non essential files, and still am low on space. </s>
<s> Any suggestion ? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> http://www.malayter.com/compressiontest.html You can find more if you wish but Windows disk compression isn't that great. </s>
<s> Nice, easy and fast but it's main goal is not &quot;space&quot; but time. </s>

<s> it's really hard to recommend compression. </s>
