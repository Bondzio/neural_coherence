had a 9 y.o compaq presario with a 4gb seagate drive in it, which was my first ever computer so i lived on that thing for years when i first got it.
installing games, uninstalling them to make room for new games that were meant to run on a system with more ram (so the hdd went crazy reading/writing to the swap file), stuffing the o/s up and re-installing that... that was one hard working hdd, i finally gave that pc to my mum 2 years ago for word processing and web surfing and it still refuses to die, i did an error check on it recently and there is not one bad sector on that hdd.
when i build my next pc it will have seagate in it for sure.
