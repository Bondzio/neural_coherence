There is a difference between cards that are &quot;Built by ATI&quot; and cards that are &quot;Powered by ATI&quot;.
In many instances, cards that are &quot;powered by&quot; often contain &quot;enhancements&quot; that are specifically engineered for their brand of card.
Pipelines and/or shaders my be disabled or there may be overclocked functions that the manufacturer has determined are &quot;optimal&quot; for their version of the card.
In my experience, it has always been best to download the drivers from the card manufacturers website, although I have had mixed success with using the drivers offered from the ATI website.
nVidia on the other hand has no such issues.
After being a longtime ATI user I now have a new pc with an 8800GTS and will probably never go back to ATI powered cards.
Also, CCC (Catalyst Control Center) tends to be a resource hog and takes longer to load than nVidia's control panel.
