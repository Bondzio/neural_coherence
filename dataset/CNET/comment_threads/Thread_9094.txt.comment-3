You said the wireless network is fine so shall we presume this one is wired?
If so, how far from the device is from the router doesn't much matter.
If wired, have you tried to ping the gateway?
If not, you could try that but first check to see if you have a proper IP address.
If using Windows, you type &quot;ipconfig&quot; (without quotes) from the command prompt.
It should show several sets of numbers.
One will be the gateway address and another will be the IP address of the network adapter(s).
If ping returns and error, the easiest thing to do would be the try a new cable.
See what more information you can provide and post back.
