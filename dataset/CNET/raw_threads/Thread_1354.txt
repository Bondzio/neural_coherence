Recently purchased the browser for the DS. So I set it up and then poof! My connection for my notebook is non-existent. Took my husband and I some time before we got my notebook back online, which of course, took her DS offline. Anybody know where I can find some step by step instructions to tell me how to set her DS up so that I don't lose my own internet connection? The only help I get from Nintendo is to change my internet settings, which I think makes my connection less secure. To what extent, I honestly don't know though. Does anyone know if this is indeed the case? If I set up my settings so we both can connect, will my internet connection be open to major problems or would it be ok? Serious responses only, please. Thank you.

To get secure is only a few steps on the router which are: 1. Change the router's password. 2. Set the router's SSID to something else than stock. 3. Set the wifi security to WPA-PSK. 4. Leave SSID broadcast enabled. That's it. I have a longer discussion about WEP being dead at the next link but you may want to skip that if dark details are not what you want.
