six year old pc xp with three packs,p4,x1300/1550 series video card, has been working fine until recently, out of the blue the usb would not work to use my printer, epson photo stylus 340, it works with other computer.
got in touch with the computer supplier firm in yorkshire,uk.
they build and sell.
by a remote session he helped me to put the software disc and reload the drivers.
after all that, he assumed the problem solved and went off.
i restarted the computer : well, it still did not solve the problem.
i went on the video card manufacturers website to download more recent stuff re.the card but no joy.
apart from going back to the supplier, any suggestions, the device manager shows yellow question marks on the video controller and pci.
stumped for the moment.
