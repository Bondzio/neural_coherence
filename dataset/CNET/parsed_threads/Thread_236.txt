<s> As one of many being totally confused as to which Tablet to buy, after all the usual attempts to eliminate potential &quot;bombs&quot;, the one question I have been unable to have answered, properly is when looking at machines available how do you know if it will have an up-grade from ICS to JB. </s>
<s> What has further confused me is just one hour ago reading a punter,s review of a Samsung machine with ICS and he was able to up-grade to JB himself using Kies. </s>
<s> So, before buying a particular machine which only carries ICS, how can you tell if an up-grade is possible? </s>
<s> Do not buy an ICS tablet if you want JB. </s>
<s> It's that simple. </s>
<s> You are never sure if the maker will issue that update. </s>
<s> There is no reason to repeat what others have learned about this. </s>

<s> Buy either a Nexus 7 or Nexus 10 by Google. </s>
<s> I believe they both come with Jelly Bean. </s>
<s> I just bought a Nexus 7 to use in my car as a GPS/entertainment system and I know that has Jelly Bean. </s>
<s> You can buy direct from Google or from a store. </s>
<s> Baybreeze. </s>
<s> Many thanks for your responding in a pleasant way, something laking on here of late. </s>
<s> In fact I have looked at your suggestions and am interested in buying one but thare are a couple of other machines which also interest me, other than them not having JellyBean. </s>
<s> I am still left with the question as to how you can know, in advance, that a machine which only carries ICS may be upgraded to JB soon or at a later date or, if in fact, never. </s>
<s> This is really the hub of my question which I would really love someone to answer me. </s>
<s> Many thanks. </s>
<s> Is put to the maker of the tablet. </s>
<s> Anywhere else and it's unofficial. </s>
<s> I know the question well and as you suspect, some folk have learned the answer first hand. </s>
<s> Are you ready to learn this first hand? </s>

<s> I bought myself a Samsung galaxy Tab2 at Xmas, and after a couple of days it started updating to JB. </s>
<s> It warned me I might &quot;lose&quot; some of the apps i'd installed,so I held my breath, but all was ok. Can't say I noticed any change after the upgrade(it told me it had updated successfully), but am still getting used to it anyway. </s>
<s> So far i'm loving it! </s>
<s> Here my update happened on a well known model and Flash is no more. </s>
<s> Ouch. </s>
