you may update the firmware as a first step in troubleshooting.
from inside the setup program you can check things such as: 1) mac filtering (on or off) 2) dhcp status 3) user names and passwords if required by the isp 4) dhcp client list 5) dhcp release and renew buttons has this router ever worked with this setup?
