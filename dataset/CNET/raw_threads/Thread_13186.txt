When I try and boot, nothing shows up on the monitor. I have tried the monitor on different computers and all the parts are new. When I turn on the computer, the fans start (case and CPU), the led on the MB lights up and it makes regular booting up noises. I have tried booting up without the RAM and/or the video card and here NO beeping (I even tried with speakers plugged in) I have also tried booting with nothing but the MB, CPU and PSU Like I said, all the components are brand new. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks
