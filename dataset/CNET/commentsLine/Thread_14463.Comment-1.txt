i've been having an issue with my computer lately, it started out happening very little, now its happening basically each time i start, and wake up from sleep mode on my computer.
here's the issue, if i put my computer in sleep mode, it wakes up, the fans come on, but there's no display on the monitor, i have to hold the power button down and reboot.
the computer doesn't have any display after i reboot.
i have to keep rebooting the machine, like 20 times to get it to work.. any idea on what the problem is?
i'm thinking it's the video card, or maybe the motherboard.
sometimes the screen flashes black, and a message pops up saying &quot;video card driver stopped responding, but recovered.&quot;, or something like that, also, the computer freezes at times, and the same thing happens with no display.
oh, and sometimes when this happens, there's no beeps when attempting to start the machine.
thanks oh, and here's the specs.
