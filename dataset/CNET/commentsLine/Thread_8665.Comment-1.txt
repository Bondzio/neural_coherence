i gave my old computr to my son when i bought a new system.
the problem is he has started playing the online game runescape but he say's it is always lagging and runs too slow, when i gave him the pc i reformatted so he was left with a clean computer (well cleanish) ive run antivirus +anti spyware well everything really.i wanted to know if it was worth me upgrading components or just putting up with me having to go on the old pc when he wants to play games.
