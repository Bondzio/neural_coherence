It's been working fine for several months, and now all of sudden its giving me problems. I can see all the files on the hard drive, and can delete them occasionally, but anytime I try to copy or access the files windows slows to a complete stop and nothing happens until I pull the plug. I've tried 4 different USB cables, I've tried plugging it into a different computer, and nothing has worked. I've tried defragging the hard drive several times, I've run chkdsk a bunch of times, and everything comes out normal. I've tried running chkdsk in deepscan mode, but then it just tells me that for a bunch of files it doesn't have the space to replace the bad sectors, even though it has about 20GB free. Any suggestions?

Every once in a while i can get a file off, but almost never.

And every time i run checkdisk it just give me lots of errors like this: The disk does not have enough space to replace bad clusters detected in file 3248 of name \Music\Artists\PHANTO~1\PH0781~1.WMA. Anything I can do to fix that? I still have 20 GB free space on the drive. Is it fixing the problem?

I've run into corrupt volumes that chkdsk never could repair. Look up PC FILE INSPECTOR as well, but stop writing to the drive since it usually makes it worse for getting the files out. Bob
