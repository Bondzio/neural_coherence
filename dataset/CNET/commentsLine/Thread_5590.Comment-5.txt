1. the file system will only support 127gb (or 137gb) in total on that drive.
i don't want to duplicate all that is known about this, so catch up about this at  2.  notes the usual usb 2.0 issues.
but in a laptop it gets worse.
very few can install windows properly.
they'll forget some motherboard or other driver.
support is waning for this old os, but by this time you should be an old hand at corraling the motherboard drivers, reading usbman and more.
this os hasn't been offered for 5 years so it's not seen as much and ... people seem to be forgetting how it works.
