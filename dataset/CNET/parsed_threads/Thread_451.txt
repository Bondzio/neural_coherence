<s> If a firewall is installed, that's a common complaint. </s>
<s> And to pre-emptively note such, even when disabled, Zone Alarm still interferes with this. </s>

<s> I've run into similiar problems, particularly with my Pro system (have 1 98, 1 XP Home laptop, and my main system with Pro). </s>
<s> Bob mentioned ZoneAlarm, which I use. </s>
<s> In the firewall configuration, I added the ip addresses of all the computers, AND the full range of addresses, e.g, 192.168.2.1-192.168.2.40. </s>
<s> In addition, and this seems to have caused me the most problem, XP's firewall often automagically turns itself on, so in in the Local Area Connection Properties&gt;Advanced, I disable the XP firewall. </s>
<s> I have the most problems with my Pro system. </s>
<s> The 98 system NEVER has a problem, lol. </s>
<s> So much for 'upgrades'. </s>
<s> Hope this was of some help. </s>
<s> Also, I've turned off all power management and screensavers, as I've read this can be an issue with a network. </s>
