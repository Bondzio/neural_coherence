Recently it turns itself off after a few seconds of switching it on. The symptoms goes like this: After a long period of dormancy, when I press the on button, it switches itself on for about 20 seconds before turning itself off. Subsequent tries to switch it on, it will switch off by itself after 1 - 2 seconds. I have tried the following: 1) Changed power supply 2) Changed Power supply cable 3) COnnect to different power sockets, (i.e. different rooms in the house) 4) Only connect using the power supply cable (i.e. monitor, speaker cables are all not connected) All the above failed to resolve the problem. However, the annoying thing is, whenever I bring the computer over to the technician's place, it works perfectly well! It can switch on and remain switched on for hours. The moment I bring it home and try to switch on at home, it failed. Does anyone know what can be the cause of this? Any help will be greatly appreciated, thanks.

I will probably change a new motherboard as a last resort but as of now I am thinking of alternatives since a new motherboard is expensive. Essentially the problems goes like this, the computer keeps switching off after 1 seconds when it is in my house, but it works perfectly well in the technician's place. This is a very reproducible problem. Since the problem began (about a week ago) I have not had a single occasion that the computer did not shut down by itself after a few seconds, when it is in my house. But when I moved it to the technician place, there is not a single time that the computer shut down after a few seconds. I've been to the technician's place twice and in both occasions I did not see it switch off by itself. In fact, the 3 days in the technician place, the technician also claimed that it did not switch off at all. The technician also says it is unlikely to be motherboard and initially diagnosed it as a case of overheating. He added some hardware adjustments, but the problem remains unresolved to now, whenever the computer is in my house. Hence is there any other cause of this problem? Please advise, thanks.

Sorry but I think you want this written so I will. The old works at the shop syndrome is often traced to not the AC (unless we are talking really bad third world areas) but something the owner is not taking into account. They get home and (here it is) hook up their USB drives, printers, phone and what else that is not the same as the shop. Some of them will not place the machine in the SAME ORIENTATION as it was at the shop. But it sounds like a flaky board to me. Bob

But if it is really easy to learn I will go and read up on my own regarding this. I have considered all the possible factors said above. The connection I did is just a bare bones Power Supply to main socket connection. I didn't connect the monitor, the speaker, the printer etc. to imitate what it was done at the technician's place. Further, I did place the computer at the same orientation as what I saw placed in the technician's area, and at the same time, I blasted the fan full speed at the motherboard but still the problem persisted. I guess then it probably really is the motherboard. Thanks for the help.
