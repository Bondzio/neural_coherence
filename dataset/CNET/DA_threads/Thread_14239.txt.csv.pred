1.1.9	-Kevin	St
1.2.1	They came from a locked media , CD , or because the ownership of them has changed .	St
1.2.2	You initially told us that you were only the & quot ; manager & quot ; on your OS X server , where the files on the CD were created .	St
1.2.3	Now that you are the owner and administrator of the OS X machine , things have changed as regards those files on the CD .	St
1.2.4	Just drag them onto the HD of your machine , select them all , get info and remove the check mark from the & quot ; Locked & quot ; box .	St
1.2.5	Close the window .	St
1.2.6	Everything should be alright now .	St
1.2.7	If , on the OS X files , you still find yourself unable to read or write to them , drag them to the HD , select them all , get info and then change ownership by changing the Read/Write status of the Owner .	St
1.2.8	Read everything in the get info box and you will see this option towards the bottom , on the left hand side .	St
1.2.9	If the options are grayed out , click the padlock and enter your administrators password when prompted .	St
1.2.10	Let us know how you get on P	St
