1.1.6	It will not disconnect , but the page will stop loading and lead me to the can not display page .	St
1.1.7	When I posted my problems before , here were some of the responses : 1 ) Reset your wireless router to factory settings , then set it up again .	St

1.1.13	There is a webpage that lets me log into my router , and it says I am FIRMWARE 1.00NA .	St
1.1.14	4 ) Try unplugging for 30s and plug back in .	St
1.1.15	-- -Tried it , still problems .	St
1.1.16	Here`s something else that might help , I am not sure : When the internet does cut out and I get the error webpage , I click the `troubleshoot` button and Windows does its scan for errors type thing .	St
1.1.17	This is usually what happens .	St

1.1.32	Thank you in advance for helping me out forum ...	St
1.2.1	Has suggested settings .	St
1.2.2	I ca n't find your router settings so here they are again .	St
1.2.3	1 .	St
1.2.4	Router defaults .	St
1.2.5	2 .	St
1.2.6	WPA security .	St
1.2.7	That 's it .	St
1.2.8	Bob	St
1.3.1	That 's what you said last time , and I just stated again in this topic that I 've done that , and it has n't fixed anything .	St
1.4.1	When I log into my router , and try to make changes , and save , it says & quot ; This feature has been disabled on this emulator. & quot ;	St
1.5.1	This tells me you are not changing the router but the netgear or other emulator page .	St
1.5.2	SHARE THE URL of that router setup page for confirmation .	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	http : //www.support.dlink.com/emulators/dir601/100NA/login.html I login as ADMIN and try to change the settings , but anything I click will give me a & quot ; This feature is disabled ... & quot ; message .	St
1.7.1	This explains why you have n't made the changes to your router .	St
1.7.2	Sorry but I would be guessing if your router is at : http : //192.168.0.1 This can vary but that 's a common one .	St
1.7.3	Thanks for telling what you were doing .	St
1.7.4	It explained a lot .	St
1.7.5	Bob	St
1.8.1	Thanks for taking the time to find/type that link for me , Bob .	St
1.8.2	I entered the settings from that URL , and found that I am using the newest firmware and using WPA .	St
1.8.3	I changed it to WPA2 because it said something about stronger connection with it .	St
1.8.4	So..	St
1.8.5	I guess everything looks good now .	Polite
1.8.6	I hope so anyways .	St
1.8.7	Thanks again for your help .	St
1.9.1	http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-7589_102-0.html ? threadID=372566 & tag=forums06 ; forum-threads Given the new attacks it may not be long till I have to upgrade the forum sticky from WPA to WPA2 .	St
1.9.2	There is no need to panic yet but I do see the biggest problem is that not everyone wants to be their own IT STAFF GURU and dust bunny collector .	St
1.9.3	Hope all this helped you out , Merry Christmas , Bob	St
1.10.1	Hey Bob , it 's happened again .	St
1.10.2	My laptop disconnected twice tonight , about an hour between the two times .	St
1.10.3	My roommates laptop did n't disconnect at all .	St
1.10.4	Do you have a suggestion for a next step.. ?	Ques
1.11.1	1 .	St
1.11.2	See if your machine has newer wifi drivers .	St
1.11.3	2 .	St
1.11.4	Replace the wifi card .	St
1.11.5	If you are running P2P downloads , wifi is known to buckle .	St
1.11.6	Not much you can do for those that have n't learned to get wired for that use .	St
1.11.7	Bob	St
1.12.1	Got this router for x-mas , sigh , nice thought , but total absolute junk .	St
1.12.2	To fix the constant disconnect : 1 go into your router settings 2 click & quot ; advanced & quot ; tab up top 3 click & quot ; advanced wireless & quot ; tab on left 4 change the beacon period to 20 This will slow down the connection speed somewhat ( about 20 % ) , but will enable the router to hold a steady connection .	St
1.12.3	Wonder what is an adequate time period before I & quot ; accidentally & quot ; break it and get a new one .	St
1.12.4	Seriously total junk , D-link never should have put it on the market .	St
