i upgraded the memory to full capacity, so i guess it's got 2 gigs in there.
hard to remember, lol!
i looked at some all in ones but wouldn't go in that direction aside from imac.
the gaming thing, eldest son, 17, is utterly uninterested and is never going to be interested, he's into guitar and the only thing he does on computer aside from school stuff is facebook, 24/7 if we'd let him.
youngest son, 14, plays my wife's mahjong game on pc, angry birds on kindle fire, still uses an nintendo ds and his favorite wii game is just dance ... that ought to give you an indication of where he's coming from as far as gaming ... and he basically has no use for his peers who do anything more substantial or &quot;out there&quot; gaming-wise.
if it changes, it changes, but both of 'em are getting close to the point where they need to be buying their own %#^&@* computers if they want something more, lol!
