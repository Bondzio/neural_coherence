<s> When I requested DVDs of my photos- the DVDs came back with a nice label with the name of the shop, date created etc. </s>
<s> It seems to be &quot;painted on&quot; and from some shops, it seems to be printed on paper and then glued on.... How are these labels created ? </s>
<s> What program(s) are used ? </s>

<s> But as label making program goes, there are many out there and there are three other method of labeling; lightscript (labels are burned in), paper labels (print then stick), and &quot;painted on&quot; (label surface are painted on the cd/dvd). </s>
