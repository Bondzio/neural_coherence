It has an integrated Wireless Adapter Intel Pro/Wireless 2915ABG . I have noticed that its been acting up sometimes, finds signlas, drops them, the status bar going up and down all the time. Im not sure if this is a software issue r hardware. what I want to know is if an NCI or Cardbus wireless adaptor is better than the integrated one, range and stabitily wise. thanks

Distance = SAME OLD STORY of &quot;it depends on the situation.&quot; But the reason I fit those cards is that while sometimes replacing the internal card fixes it, it usually fails again so I never bother anymore. This is not a design bug. Laptops have a life span and it's from 3 to 5 years so again, not a bug or omission in the design. You have the right idea to fix this common issue. It's how I deal with it.
