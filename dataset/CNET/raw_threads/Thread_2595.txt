5015	0	381670	3240272	NR	Ol Rod	2/5/10 8:59 AM	1.26536034E12	Video Card; two Questions ......	Well, I did search some. And I hesitate because someone will say not upgrade this old rig. Abit AN8 (ultra), socket 939, Athlon 3500+ @ 2.47 Ghz, DDR400 ram, 4 Gig Matching Corsair XMS, nForce4 chipset, I'm running W7 64 and it runs Areo. I was thinking to upgrade my 6600le NVidia. I was sorta looking at Radeon HD 4850, or maybe a 56xx or 57xx series. THE QUESTIONS: 1. Can I over kill on vid card so much as to cause problems?? 2. Since everything about this mobo is Nvidia, will this old hardware &quot;like&quot; a new Radeon card as well as it might &quot;like&quot; a new NVidea? You wonder why spend money on old set ... I dunno, I LIKE my old box, I guess I just want to see how far I can max it out. My retirement income is such that I can find extra $100 once in a while, but if I build new, I would not be content to go low end. And long as this box runs well, I can't justify spending that much. Anyway, please Advise, Criticize, or Insult. I want to hear it.

Both installed in machines exactly like yours so comparisons are doable and maybe interesting to you. 1. A Nvidia 9500GT with 512MB. The socket 939 box tops out at 120 Watts in total and idles at 70ish Watts. I tried an ATI card but it pegged the CPU so I went with Nvidia. 2. A Nvidia GeForce GT 220 1024 MB DDR3 PCI-Express Graphics Card http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SG7LUQ/ref=oss_product I chose this because of the Watts but also because the next model up had complaints of fan noise. The GT 220 on a HP d4999t w/4GB RAM, etc tops out at 140 Watts and is very nice. I'd consider item 2. Bob

5015	3	381670	3246856	3240268	Ol Rod	2/13/10 7:45 PM	1.2660903E12	Done it!	Bob, if you are still tracking, I bought that one. EVga, 1 Gig, DDR3. Got it in without a hitch, ran the provided CD, then went to their website and got latest driver. The monitor picture is maybe just a little sharper, and some things happen faster when I click. Thanks, again.

A HP d5000t quad core was found cheap so we moved his old Nvidia 6600 card over and he is settling in. No hurry but we'll see about getting another card like this for him later. Thanks for the report. Sounds like it worked out well for you. Bob
