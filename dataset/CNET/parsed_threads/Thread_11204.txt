<s> If I have four slots in a row, and two already contain cards, can I plug my ethernet card into either free slot? </s>
<s> What are the two cards already there, sound and video? </s>
<s> Will Windows configure even if we're at home and not on the college LAN yet? </s>
<s> New at this, but I have added RAM before. </s>
<s> Compaq Presario 2.8G about 3 months old. </s>
<s> The PCI network card will go in any PCI slot without much ado. </s>
<s> BUT WINDOWS may not support this card. </s>
<s> Have the drivers handy. </s>
<s> And NO! </s>
<s> It will not configure the card for use away from home. </s>
<s> Just asking. </s>
<s> How is the Home connection? </s>
<s> Ethernet? </s>
<s> If so, don't add this card. </s>

<s> Understand you to say we can't configure card until plugged into college LAN. </s>
<s> We have dial up at home, no network. </s>
<s> Are you saying Windows doesn't have drivers to support card and that we will have to find driver at a website? </s>
<s> College recommends SMC or 3COM cards and sells them and cable at the bookstore. </s>
<s> I was hoping to get the job done at home before the move. </s>
<s> While you can install the card if there is no ethernet connection in the machine, an unused ethernet can result in 10 minute or so &quot;freezes&quot; that confound owners. </s>
<s> You also may not be able to test the card, but absolutely can install it, the drivers and then disable it to sidestep the freeze and thaw that may happen. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Where do I go to disable the card. </s>
<s> I think I've seen the list and you remove the check, but I forgot how I got there. </s>
<s> There is either a checkbox or dropdown to tell Windows to use or ignore the device. </s>
