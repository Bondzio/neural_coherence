<s> lots of RAM and a slow gfx card or... small amount of RAM and a fast gfx card? </s>
<s> (obviously it would be better to go in between, i wanna know out of personal interest. </s>
<s> so those are you only two choices ;)) </s>
<s> Most games perform just fine on 512M to 1GB RAM. </s>
<s> Since that's cheap, you only need to review the card. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> For example if you try to play games on XP with just 256 RAM the video card likely doesn't matter. </s>
<s> Similarly, borderline minimal requirements on either may not be good if the game is graphic intensive. </s>
<s> Meanwhile you could have all the memory in the world but an integrated video with limited memory, e.g. </s>
<s> a 64 MB integrated video configuration, would also limit gaming experiences. </s>
<s> Regards, JB </s>
<s> as close to the graphics engine as possible. </s>
<s> So a video card (graphics engine) with a lot of memory will be able to handle the most graphical processing. </s>
<s> On the other hand, if your graphical interface is on the motherboard (and not separate card) lots of ram would greatly increase its performance. </s>
<s> Depends on optimal requirements for the most rigorous game you plan to play. </s>
<s> Usually somewhere (often the bottom end) on the game software box is a list of the system requirements to run the software. </s>
<s> Often there will be two sets of specs: the minimal hardware required to run it (in its lowest graphical modes), and also the preferred or &quot;optimal&quot; system specs that would allow you to set the in-game graphics parameters to the higher or max variables. </s>
<s> Also, the DirectX minimal version the game requires is important (software wise). </s>
<s> The newest released is DirectX 10, which is vastly different than 9 and the previous versions. </s>
<s> However at the present time, DirectX 10 video hardware is just emerging and so is kind of rare to find, and can cost BIG bucks, often over $600 USD. </s>
<s> The prices will drop predictably over time, as earlier versions did, so most people wait on new standards until they are affordable. </s>
<s> For Windows 98, ME, 2000, or XP Home/Pro, all these operating systems run great games with 512MB of RAM with a graphics card, either AGP or PCI Express with 128 MB of memory on board. </s>
<s> Right now, technology is at a crossroads, the new operating system; Vistaaaaaa, ugh, supposedly uses a 1GB or RAM, so it might be a good idea to have 2 GB or more just in case, getting back to graphics; Go with Nvidia or ATI for a graphics card, make sure your motherboard supports either AGP or PCI Express before you buy one. </s>
<s> Nvidia has already released their new line of graphic cards, ATI is about to release theirs around April. </s>
<s> I suggest waiting till ATI releases theirs, has the best graphics, or go ahead and get a Nvidia graphics card if you can't wait. </s>
<s> Remember, in terms of graphics, very few games even use 256MB of memory for both the computer and the GPU of the graphics card; like the saying &quot;If it ain't broken, don't fix it!&quot; </s>
<s> Like someone else said, check game requirements. </s>
<s> Obviously, the more RAM you have, the better some games will perform (Battlefield 2/2142 eat RAM alive). </s>
<s> Both are pretty important, since a good videocard with no ram won't really help you, and a lot of ram with a junk video card won't run some games. </s>
<s> my comp. </s>
<s> as of now has 2 gigs of RAM and a 128mb ati standard video card that came with the desktop. </s>
<s> I'm thinking about upgrading the video card now but I have no problems running games like counterstrike or battlefield on it. </s>
<s> But with Vista now out, 256mb video memory is the standard it seems. </s>
<s> having borderline amt of RAM to run the OS won't get any decent performance, or even ability to run games. </s>
<s> Having somewhat higher than the min will allow u to play lower-end/older PC games better, but which probably won't end up using the might of the muscular vid card since those games aren't likely to have great textures, graphics, lighting/shading, and other visual effects having a crappy vid card but lots of RAM, again probably limited to flash games and lower-end/older PC games. </s>
<s> Ditto if the vid card were slightly above low-end. </s>
<s> U'd actually be able to play higher end games decentl, but with features and details turned off/down. </s>
<s> If it came down to these 2, I would go latter for work, as generous RAM is certainly a performance/productivity booster. </s>
<s> For home, the former, as i would just upgrade RAM right away, which is the easier of the 2 to upgrade. </s>
<s> I play The Sims2 a lot. </s>
<s> I started with the base game, 256MB RAM, and an on-board video card with 64MB shared. </s>
<s> The base game was not too bad, but it took a player a while to cross a room. </s>
<s> When the expansion packs started coming out, I crashed lift, right, and center, until I added a 1GB stick to my computer. </s>
<s> What a difference in speed, until the game ate up all of my CPU resources, so I knew it was time for an independent video card. </s>
<s> I went to the website for The Sims2, and printed out their requirements. </s>
<s> I then ran the Direct-X to see what I actually had. </s>
<s> I took both papers into the place that custom-builds my computers for me, showed them the list, and told them how much money I had to spend. </s>
<s> I walked out with an ATI Radeon 9250, with 128 MB of RAM, and the game runs very smooth, and I can actually see blades of grass, fine patterns on furniture, and actual patterns on wallpaper. </s>
<s> Total cost for the 1GB RAM=$70.00 CDN; video card was $40.00 Cdn. </s>
<s> Soon, for the next EP (Seasons), I will need a better processor; mine is 1.2 GHtz, which is 0.2 GHtz over the latest EP (Pets), so that is when I will fall into trouble. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> xp will run good with 1gb. </s>
<s> If you already are a gig or more, go for the video card. </s>
<s> WHY? </s>
<s> XP 'likes' about 1gb of memory to stay out of the swapfile. </s>
<s> Any time xp reads/writes to the swapfile, everything stops... A 8800gtx won't help here... </s>
<s> It will just look great while waiting for the swapfile to finish. </s>
<s> If you have LESS than 1gb of memory, forget about the video card and buy as much memory as you can afford (and what your computer can use). </s>
<s> 1gb is my minimum, with 2gb being a sweet spot. </s>
<s> BOTH! </s>
<s> You can't really choose between RAM and a good GFX card for excellent gaming experience. </s>
<s> Both of those two work together to deliver great graphics. </s>
<s> For example, I have 1gig of RAM and I used to have a GeForce 6600 128MB. </s>
<s> Playing the Sims 2 was sweet, even with the expansions installed. </s>
<s> There was very little lag, and I spent hours in front of the computer. </s>
<s> When I would play Counter-Strike: Source, it looked great. </s>
<s> I even used that HDR (I think, you know that stuff where it was featured in Half-Life: Lost Coast) and it was playable with no lag. </s>
<s> So you really can't choose. </s>
<s> :P </s>
