I have always recommended the Antec and Enermax psus.
They have provided decent service if a good match is found the more wattage the better.
However, Enermax also makes I believe the PowerMax series of psus and is trying to leviate those models to a premium level which it maybe, but generally if you have the wattage and build-in cooling most do well.
If you like the bells and whistles sorta thing, remember that is usally just that it really do much to cool or maintain a stable output, so look beyond LED lites, dials, and too fancy cabling.
I suggest it should have at least 2 fans for best operation, the quieter the better.
