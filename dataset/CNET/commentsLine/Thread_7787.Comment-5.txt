i am running at hp pavilion zv6000 with xp home, sp2, an amd athalon 64 processor 3200+ with 994mhz, and 1.25g ram.
and this 100% usage thing happens all the time.
it will happen at what seems to be random intervals, but obviously it's not random.
it will also do it for hours at a time.
actually, it's doing it right now.
looking at my processes in task manager, i have 86k from firefox, and 48k from thunderbird (and a few other programs are running from 48k to 20k).
nothing too intense.
the problem rarely alleviates itself after i close the programs down.
it makes the whole system drag, and makes opening and closing programs really slow.
i have no clue what to do.
these are all common programs, and updated norton, spyware doctor, and ad-aware aren't finding anything.
thanks for taking a look at this... anxious to see what you all think.
