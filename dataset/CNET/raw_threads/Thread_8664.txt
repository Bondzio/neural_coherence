Scenario: short preamble option in capability = 1 Barker mode in ERP IE = 1 As i understand the barker mode preamble is set if currently long preamble has to be used in BSS and the short preamble option if usage of short is allowed. This would mean that AP uses long preambles while sending frames and ERP STAs being able to decode the ERP IE can also start using long preambles. But the question is how 11b STA already using short preamble come to know that they have to start using long preamble when the short preamble option is still 1!!!

At the consumer level this is all done, done and done. Your post doesn't reveal the problem you are trying to solve and you can use google.com to research your engineering needs. Besides your first post was a bit off in reference to Barker mode and code. Bob
