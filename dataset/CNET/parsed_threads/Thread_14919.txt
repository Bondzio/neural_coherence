<s> I just purchased a Epson Stylus Photo R320 printer. </s>
<s> Followed all the instructions when loading the software. </s>
<s> When I connect the cable into the USB port I get the following error message. </s>
<s> &quot;cmdnist has caused an error in KRNL386.EXE cmdnist will now close. </s>
<s> If you continue to experience problems, try restarting your computer.&quot; I have restarted my computer and no luck. </s>
<s> I am running WindowsME on a Gateway. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?q=cmdnist+has+caused+an+error+in+KRNL386.EXE finds no hits and that's telling. </s>
<s> Usually I find that some trojan/virus/spy has install a too-similar filename and has upset the OS. </s>
<s> If that was a typo, then http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;q277994 is interesting and points to motherboard and USB driver issues. </s>
<s> You can research this further at http://www.usbman.com Bob </s>
<s> Have you tried to hook up different USB device? </s>
<s> like mouse, external hard drive... etc. </s>
<s> Do you have any error number? </s>
<s> Yes I have. </s>
<s> My mouse and keyboard work. </s>
<s> I can hook up my digital camera thru the usb port with no problem. </s>
<s> Also I have hooked up an external hard drive in the past and it worked. </s>
