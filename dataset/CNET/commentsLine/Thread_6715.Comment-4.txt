the internet.. without a computer??
'therefore, if none of the computers connected to this network are on, i still have access to my mass storage device.'
maybe you mean, you can access from other places .. via internet .. using other people computer..??
or you want to store your data online??
so you can access it from anywhere via internet, using other people or even your own computer.
maybe this is similar to what you mean?
