1.1.1	http : //h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/genericDocument ? lc=en & cc=us & dlc=en & docname=c00006476 Never moved a Mobo before , considering instead of modding the HP case , to just move to a larger case .	St
1.1.2	No idea how to make sure this mobo will be able to screw down into a new case or not .	St
1.2.1	Would Antec cases advertised as & quot ; up to standard ATX & quot ; mean that it will have screw mounts for a mATX ?	Ques
1.2.2	or a uATX ?	Ques
1.2.3	( they are the same thing correct ? )	Ques
1.2.4	I really like the Super Lanboy and P160 ( especially the removable mobo tray )	St
1.3.1	Decent new cases provide multiple mounting post ( s ) as NOT all are needed to conform to whatever mtrbd .	St
1.3.2	is out there up to a point .	St
1.3.3	You may get lucky and use enough mounting posts to align and maintain postion of the mtrbd .	St
1.3.4	or be OK regardless .	St
1.3.5	I suggest whatever case you get has a & quot ; removable & quot ; bulkhead an area where the ports are located .	St
1.3.6	That way , you swap a proper bulkhead to fit what the mtrbd .	St
1.3.7	is configued for , this is a physical item .	St
1.3.8	If unable to match , then leave & quot ; off/open & quot ; and still have access to all ports .	St
1.3.9	Also , decent cases provide a selection ( usually 2 ) bulkhead panels to choose from .	St
1.3.10	If not , various online vendors can provide that if available .	St
1.3.11	This is the curse of OEM type systems , as they 're made for thier needs and not necessarily conform to generic offering .	St
1.3.12	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	in the mounting plate for the Micro ATX , et al .	St
1.5.1	panel for the I/O 's .	St
1.5.2	They may not be standard overall dimension .	St
1.5.3	If they are you should be able to take the one from the old case and snap it in .	St
1.6.1	NT	St
