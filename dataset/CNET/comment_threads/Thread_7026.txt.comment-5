I was having this same issue.
What I figured out was by using &quot;safely remove hardware&quot;, I was basically turning off that drive.
Problem was it didn't come back until I rebooted.
My work around was to skip the &quot;safely remove&quot; and just wait a few minutes for the memory card to finish it's work before removing from the slot.
That took care of the problem.
