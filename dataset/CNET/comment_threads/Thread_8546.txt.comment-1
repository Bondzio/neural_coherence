Just got cable internet installed a week ago, and now I can't use my pc labtop( my roomate's) to get on the net, but my mac is able to be online.
A few days I ago i reset my router, because it had blocked my school website, but nothing else.
I reset the router, and I was able to get on my school website, but I wasn't able to use my pc.
My computer is attached to the modem, (don't have internal modem) The cable goes into the modem, then I have a cat 5 cable, that connects to the router, and then had another cat 5 cable connect to the pc.
I don't have the any information on the router, other than its a netgear wireless router mr814v2.
A friend of mine suggested I had bad cables, (wasn't a problem), type ipconfig in the cmd, but didn't do anything.
Please let me know if anyone has any suggestions.
I have a g4 mac 10.2, 867 processor 768mem compaq presario labtop, Xp HomeEdition, amd 4, proc 489, 496 memory
