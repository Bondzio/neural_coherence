<s> I am currentlly putting together a computer with a quad core processor and want to be able to add two video cards and a physics accelerator so I expect the computer to get pretty hot. </s>
<s> I have looked at the Asus Arctic Square ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835101010&Tpk=asus%2barctic%2bsquare ) and the Zalman CNPS9700 Led Fan ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835118019 )and they both have good reviews. </s>
<s> I plan on having a case with clear sides and in the case there are a few blue LDS so I would prefer if it went with the style, looked nice, and wasn't out of place but it also has to be good at cooling the system because I would like the computer to be as QUIET as possible. </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be great! </s>
<s> Thanks, Chris </s>
<s> is the clear winner. </s>
<s> But before I'd buy....I'd see what some of the tech sites say. </s>
<s> I'm sure products reviews are referenced/linked on the mfgs site. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Alright, that is great. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>

<s> i don't have experience with the asus cooler, but i prefer coolers with side mounted fans that blow the hot air out the back of the pc rather than downward and back onto the mobo. </s>
<s> but if you don't have good airflow in the case, downward airflow is probably better. </s>

<s> Alright, this review has some great info on it and will come in very useful. </s>
<s> in two of my computers and they both worked great and looked pretty cool with the copper fins and blue LED. </s>
<s> It does help to have good air flow in the case though, specially with that many graphics cards. </s>
