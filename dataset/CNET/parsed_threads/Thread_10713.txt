<s> I would need help on the following problem: One of these scenarios can happen Scenario 1: During boot my HDD is not recognized and the boot sequence finishes with 'Ultra100 Bios not installed, because there are no drivers attached' Scenario 2: However sometimes the HDD is recognised and the PC powers up and starts Win2000 as normal. </s>
<s> Everthing is running fine for a while until suddenly the HDD stops to 'operate' and the PC 'crashes' and subsequently returns to scenario 1. </s>
<s> Firstly I am puzzled why I get this Ultra100 message because no controller Ultra100 is actually inserted in one of the PCI slots. </s>
<s> Secondly I wonder why the HDD is sometimes detected and the other time not. </s>
<s> During the faulty boot sequence I've also received the message 'check cables' - which I did but with no idea what to do - everything looked fine to me. </s>
<s> Listening to the HDD it sounds like it sometimes simple stops 'turning' the disk. </s>
<s> My motherboard is a Asus Cubx-E with a primary master / slave and secondary master / slave. </s>
<s> Please note: I am not a Hardware Person - but I understand what to do if the answer is not written in techy language. </s>
<s> Are my bios settings screwed?? </s>
<s> (and why what that be - have not made any amendments to hard- or software - problem occured out of the blue). </s>
<s> Your help is appreciated. </s>
<s> Are my bios settings screwed?? </s>
<s> Not unless you changed them. </s>
<s> Presume this just started happening. </s>
<s> Look to a power problem and, or possibly controller / drive fault. </s>
<s> Do the standard things like run an external fan on the open case and see if it runs longer before a fault - could be drive cooling. </s>
<s> Remove unecessary devices and see if it runs longer (less power consumption) Check the connections - both sides - drive and at controller and controller and PCI slot. </s>
<s> Try changing slots if necessary which will require re-installing drivers etc. </s>
<s> Back everything you need ASAP </s>
<s> Thanks a lot for this prompt reply. </s>
<s> A lot of ideas - I will start checking what you have suggested in the next couple of days and come back letting you know what the situation is. </s>
<s> Your support is appreciated. </s>
