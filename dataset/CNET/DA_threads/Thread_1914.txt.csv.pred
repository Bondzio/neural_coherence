1.1.1	Ok , I 'm going in the opposite direction as most people here .	St
1.1.2	I have a cable modem which is connected directly to a DLink wireless router .	St
1.1.3	Every PC in my house has wireless cards , so I have had no real use for network cable in a long time ... however , what I 'd like to do is add a wired hub/switch to my existing wireless network , but I 'd like to do it in an area that is nowhere near my wireless access point .	St
1.1.4	How can I go about doing that ?	Ques
1.1.5	I do have LAN cards in the PCs in the area I want to add this wired switch if there 's the possibility of connecting one of the PCs to the switch in order to join it to the network .	St
1.1.6	otherwise , do I have other options , or is that even an option itself ?	Ques
1.1.7	So to recap : cable modem - DLink wiress router on main floor of my house .	St
1.1.8	Multiple PCs with wireless cards , all with good connectivity to my network .	St
1.1.9	I would like to add a 4 port wired switch to my ''office '' area in the basement so I can network other devices without continually buying USB network adapters ( for instance , my DVR or a printer ) or by figuring out some other workaround .	St
1.1.10	This switch would then handle traffic from my existing wireless network just as if my network were entirely wired .	St
1.1.11	Thanks for any input .	St
1.2.1	ethernet ports available for wired expansion .	St
1.2.2	If feasible , simply run a cable from there to the switch .	St
1.3.1	But that 's not feasible .	St
1.3.2	the whole point of the wireless network in the first place was to avoid running Cat5 through my house , which this would obviously entail .	St
1.3.3	I just need a switch downstairs , where there 's a concentration of equipment , some with WiFi capability and some without .	St
1.3.4	And also , just for the record , it 's also not feasible to move the cable modem and wireless router downstairs .	St
1.3.5	thanks for the response though	Polite
1.4.1	You can install another wireless router in your home office .	St
1.4.2	This router can be configured to forward dhcp requests to your main router .	St
1.4.3	Most routers come with a built-in switch with 4 to 8 ports .	Sug
1.4.4	You can run patch cables to the switch from the devices .	St
1.4.5	The cable drop from the other route can still be a back-up method .	St
1.4.6	But you would still need a switch to split the connection with either method .	St
1.4.7	Joe Fox	St
1.5.1	do n't the wireless routers have to be the same brand in order to accomplish this ?	Ques
1.5.2	I had an old 802.11b wireless router and I tried adding it ( mainly for the extra broadcast point ) to my D-Link and they could never see each other..	St
1.5.3	I do n't think I still have that old one , but I could certainly buy another DLink if that would work.. that would also help my signal issues I have down here as well ... . if I knew it would work .	St
1.6.1	I have an old Netgear router , could I just add that ?	Ques
1.6.2	or what would happen if I just ran a crossover cable from my PC into a hub/switch ?	Ques
1.6.3	the problem with the Netgear router is that there is only one port on it , so I would have to go straight from the router into a switch anyway	St
1.7.1	It 's not the brand .	St
1.7.2	It 's the particular wireless router model with a particular firmware version .	St
1.7.3	Some routers have firmware that support WDS , but most do n't .	St
1.7.4	Some routers have 3rd party firmware available that can add WDS support .	Sug
1.7.5	WDS example : http : //www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,1934577,00.asp	St
1.8.1	Maybe I 'll check ebay for a cheap used Wireless AP or router and see if I can get WDS to work..	St
1.9.1	If you try with two WDS capable routers , essentially they both have to be the same ( or similar ) models .	St
1.9.2	The alternative is a bridge connected to some type of switch .	St
1.9.3	Internet -- - modem -- - wireless router ~ ~ ~ Bridge -- - switch -- - computers KEY : -- - wired ~ ~ ~ wireless For more info , look at the user manual for the Linksys WET54G or another wireless bridge from the company of your choice .	St
