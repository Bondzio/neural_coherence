i have a belkin n+ wireless router for the convenience of our guests.
a couple of our guests aren't able to connect to the internet, and the common denominator is that they are using apple products.
one is an i-pad.
other guests with windows laptops are getting on the internet okay.
i have the network set up with wpa2-psk security.
does anyone have an idea as to what could be wrong?
i feel bad that these people can't connect.
