1.1.1	I have a modified HP Pavilion 533w.	St
1.1.2	I think i have a S3 Trio32/64 video/graphics card, and around 512 ram, wondering if anyone could give me a few suggestions to help me out with upgrading, bare in mind though that i have little available cash to spend on it.	St
1.1.3	Any help would be wonderful, thanks.	St
1.2.1	http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/product?cc=us&lc=en&dlc=en&product=90862 I can only guess why this needs upgrading.	St
1.2.2	For now, read http://forums.cnet.com/7723-6122_102-510824.html and see where we avoided overclocking and found out why it ran slowly.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	As for the comment of &quot;only guessing&quot; why i need to upgrade i am not sure if you are being sarcastic lol or if my system seems to have enough to run correctly.	Ques
1.3.2	All i can say about the link there is that i have a more or less bare system, i have gone through and deleted almost all of my programs that didn't have anything to do with web browsing or e-book reading, as for protection the only i have on my system is Spyware Doctor, and most often it is disabled, i scan my comp once a day then disable it.	St
1.3.3	It just seems that my computer is constantly dragging.	St
1.3.4	web browsing takes ages, bringing up any programs on my comp takes ages, i honestly don't know what to do, i am only ( and i mean on the second lowest rung of the ladder) mildly tech savy.	St
1.4.1	To avoid any other offenses, can I remove my reply?	St
1.4.2	You may want to repost your reply since it does tell more about the upgrade needs.	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	I'm not offended at all, relax.	St
1.5.2	hell i even tossed a &quot;lol&quot; in there, cause it made me chuckle when i read it.	St
1.5.3	I wouldn't care if you called me stupid and told me my comp was junk, i don't take offense to things online, plus you weren't offensive.	St
1.5.4	Just tell me when is in your mind for helping to remedy my dino comp problems.	St
1.6.1	Did you want to share the HIJACKTHIS log to see if you have any known conflicts?	St
1.6.2	As to upgrades, the usual is get 1.0GB RAM (see crucial.com) and pop in any 50 buck or less video card.	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	Turns out i don't need the info anymore, while trying to put in my reply to this on my desktop, it burned out completely, i think the mother board fried, but i am going to go and try to get a decent used one from a guy that builds cheap ones.	St
1.8.1	Sometimes these things have ears.	St
1.9.1	NIL	St
1.10.1	What do you mean if burned up completely?	Ques
1.10.2	Did one component just good bad and it keeps system from loading?	St
1.10.3	What happens when you try to boot?	St
1.10.4	Keep in mind that if you are on a tight budget, it might be better to try to fix this system and have a few dollars left over to upgrade - say memory and video card - then to purchase another under powered system.	Sug
1.10.5	Regarding previous problem - did you check all the basic things first: 1.	St
1.10.6	Verfied the download issue was not with you ISP by testing internet speeds?	St
1.10.7	2.	St
1.10.8	Run a common system review program to check for issues - such as the free test at PC Pitstop?	St
1.10.9	3.	St
1.10.10	De-fragmented hard drive 4.	St
1.10.11	GAve system - especially fans - a thorough cleaning 5.	St
1.10.12	Checked to see if any driver updates were available from Dell for system or the video card manufacturer?	St
1.10.13	6.	St
1.10.14	Run another free anti-virus and anti-spyware program to see if you might have some infections missed by the first Beyond that the memory upgrade would definitely help - and the video card two.	St
1.10.15	That old card you are using is going to be a lot slower than todays integrated graphics.	St
