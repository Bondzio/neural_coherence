The router I have is a D-Link WBR-1310. It is currently using the 1.04 firmware upgrade. Changing the DNS server does not work using this firmware. But I saw somewhere that 1.02 will work. It is not on the D-Link web site, and I was wondering if anyone had any clue where I could find the 1.02 firmware? Or if there is another solution (other than configuring it on every machine) Thanks as alway.

But you can turn off the DHCP function in that router and have your own DHCP server to hand out the IP and more information. I decline to write how here since that's in the TCPIP 101 course. Bob
