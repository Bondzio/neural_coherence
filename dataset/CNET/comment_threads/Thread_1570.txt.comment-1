Home computer, general internet, email, some Excel, Word, basic photo editing, light video streaming, NO GAMING.
Will I notice a real world difference between an Intel 2.5 ghz core 2 quad Q8300 running 6 mb DDR2 and an AMD 3.0 ghz quad Phenom II X4-945 running 8 mb DDR2, both Windows 7 64bit?
The AMD computer is $100 more and large, the intel is small form factor, which I like.
Thanks for your input!
