1.1.1	The other day I was toying around with my computer ( an HP Pavilion p6310y Desktop with an ATI Radeon HD 5760 and a Tt TR2 RX 750W power supply added ) I decided to get my second monitor working which had n't been working for a while ( due to out of date drivers ) .	St
1.1.2	I updated my drivers and got the screen up and running and decided to experiment with some other features of the new AMD VISION Control Center .	St
1.1.3	When I came across the Overdrive section I had a general idea of what overclocking was and that it was dangerous but i figured using the & quot ; Auto tune & quot ; feature I would be fine .	St
1.1.4	Now I 'm thinking , differently .	St
1.1.5	I ran the auto tune and it set my card up to 775MHz ( GPU Clock ) and 1000MHz ( Memory Clock ) .	St
1.1.6	There were no issues or peculiarities but just out of timidness i decided to disable overdrive and stay on the safe side ( thus , turning off overclocking ) .	St
1.1.7	The next day ( today ) I decided to play some Dirt 3 , and at the peak of my race ( and therefore when my card was most likely being pushed ) the computer randomly shutdown .	St
1.1.8	Upon booting it up i got a messege somewhere along the lines of & quot ; this computer has shut down to prevent damage due to excessive environmental heat .	St
1.1.9	Service Immediately & quot ; Then it started up fine .	St
1.1.10	I decided to start up the game again , same issue ( about 5 minutes in ) The next time I restarted i decided to check Overdrive settings to assure it was turned off , it was turned off and the CPU temp was up to 71 degrees C. I 'm now continuously having this issue even when not stressing my GPU with games ( IE browsing the internet , typing in notepad , etc . )	St
1.1.11	I 'm worried I 've done some permanent damage to my GPU and apologize for the Extremely lengthy Explanation .	St
1.1.12	Id rather explain it all now than leaving a bunch of unanswered questions .	St
1.1.13	Any insight would be FANTASTIC !	St
1.2.1	It 's probably more of an coincidence that the OC'ing and now the warning are popping up .	St
1.2.2	I would just clear it all up by checking the defaults are truly set .	St
1.2.3	You can use the & quot ; restore feature & quot ; of your OS to return to a day before it all changed with updates , etc.. Once that is done , then check the overall operation for some time and then update if necessary again .	St
1.2.4	Your experience is why its best to do one step/item at a time rather more too closely as then you 'll doubt what 's happened or confronted by possible multiple areas to check .	St
1.2.5	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	Try reinstalling overclock utility and reset all settings to default in CCC , reboot full	St
1.4.1	Yeah its doing it alot less lately , is it possible that it could have actualy been that it was too hot outside ?	Ques
1.4.2	Unfortunately i dont have a restore point recent enough to be logical , but ill be sure to set that to automaticly update those for now on and rollingback/reinstalling my drivers will hopefully clear it up for good .	St
1.4.3	Its certainly nice to have some outsidehelp .	St
1.4.4	Thanks guys !	St
