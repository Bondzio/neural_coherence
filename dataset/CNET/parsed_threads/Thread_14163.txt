<s> I just recieved my Sapphire x1800gto today and installed catalyst 6.4, restarted, then loaded call of duty 2 after about two minutes of playing multiplayer, vpu recover came up and forced me to shutdown call of duty. </s>
<s> Sometimes I will be at the menu to start a server and it will vpu recover. </s>
<s> Tried on other games, same problem. </s>
<s> I have tried the following drivers, uninstalling the old one first: Catalyst 6.3 Catalyst 6.4 Catalyst 6.4 Beta X1800GTO Crossfire Remember that this is a fresh installation of windows and call of duty. </s>
<s> It will never VPU recover when I am using an application or on the desktop, only 3D games. </s>
