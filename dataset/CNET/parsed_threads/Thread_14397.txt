<s> I have a brand new macbook and I used bot camp to get windows to run. </s>
<s> The problem is that I can not right-click in windows. </s>
<s> Ctrl+click doesn't do anything. </s>
<s> Can anyone tell me what I need to do to be able to right click or at least where I'll find a hotkey menu to change my setings to allow for this clicking? </s>
<s> This from the Apple site/Discussions/Boot Camp there's an article in MacWorld that walks you through a little bit of this. </s>
<s> http://www.macworld.com/2006/04/features/winmacfaq/index1.php -to get a delete key... download the resource kit from microsoft ( http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9d467a69-57ff-4ae7-96ee-b18c4790cffd&displaylang=en ) and install that. </s>
<s> -run the command &quot;remapkey&quot; in the &quot;run&quot; command under the start menu. </s>
<s> -from there you can remap your entire keyboard. </s>
<s> i remapped the delete key on the right command key (this is the &quot;right windows&quot; inside the mapper despite what the image shows). </s>
<s> save, exit, and restart. </s>
<s> -delete and alt+ctrl+del should both work now. </s>
<s> -right click... &quot;apple mouse utility&quot; is a program that you can run to get a right click, just drop it in your startup folder. </s>
