i read and followed the suggestions of kaufmanmoore - at first i couldn't get the host desktop to create a new local port, but then, being a basically paranoid guy, i uninstalled both instances of network magic (came with the zyxel router)from each machine, and backed up each to a date prior to nm's initial install.
worked like a charm!
now i'd hate to be left thinking that the folks at network magic slipped a gremlin into their software that causes newbies like me to think nothing will work except buying that expensive solution, but, ... i do anyway.
only problem left is i'm still getting a message each time the laptop prints that says the printer driver needs updating - however, i did dl the new needed driver, but since there is no actual printer to install in the laptop, i had to manually install the driver, and it installed into the same folder in dl'ed into.
i suspect that's incorrect.
any final suggestion on how i can get it into a better location?
thanks rick - i appreciate your invaluable assistance.
