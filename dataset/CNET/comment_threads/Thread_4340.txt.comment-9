Folk made such things.
They were awfully expensive as each card was essentially a PC on a card.
Since it was not made in the volumes of your common PC or laptop the prices were always more than your PC.
But folk always tried such things.
Today I rarely seen a Citrix or Windows Terminal system because the PC is too cheap.
