hey guys , glad i joined the cnet community .
i have a question , i recently bought gateway sx2840-01.
i would like to know if these things are possible tower : i am not the fan of the current tower , is it possible to change the tower ?
i am not a computer genius , haven't yet received the pc , its in shipping.
so i dont know if the inside hardwares are same size like normal pcs , is it ?
can anyone point me to tower that can be used.
graphics card : i read in various forums regarding the concern about graphics card, so i have some money , whats the best graphics card that i can upgrade to ?
i am not much of the graphics person either but i do use photoshop and fireworks usually , logos, banners etc.
i wont be playing any games in the computer as i got game consoles.
thank you
