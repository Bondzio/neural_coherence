in the summer of 2004 i purchased a new camera and photosmart bundle from hp.
i sent my rebates out with 1 week.
i checked the email status several times which stated &quot;it was being processed&quot;.
after multiple communications with hp, i received a notice that this rebate had expired.
go figure?
i have 3 hp pc's and 1 sony vaio (i have grandchildren, say no more).
i also presented hp with the online documentation which i printed every time i checked my rebate status.
they simply continued to state &quot;sorry, rebate expired&quot;.
