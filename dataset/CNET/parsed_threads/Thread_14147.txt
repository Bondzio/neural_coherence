<s> I forgot my Vista Password on my Dell so I am trying to run system restore so I can just restore the settings. </s>
<s> But everytime I try and do so the keyboard freezes up and I can't choose any of the options. </s>
<s> I was told to try a PS keyboard instead of a USB port keyboard but there isnt an outlet in the back for this type of keyboard. </s>
<s> So I tryed a converter but that isn't working either. </s>
<s> The computer is a Dell Dimension E521. </s>
<s> Please help .. </s>
<s> See what NTPASSWD at google.com finds. </s>
<s> -&gt; It's what I use. </s>

<s> Thanks for the reply... Well I have this one disc I got to try and get the password but I can't even set the boot menu to run on that drive so that it will work at startup. </s>
<s> Since the keyboard freezes up... </s>
<s> I moved the hard disk to a properly working machine and booted NTPASSWD to reset the passwords. </s>
<s> I NEVER BOOTED THAT HARD DISK IN ANOTHER MACHINE (very important!) </s>
<s> Put the hard disk back into the original machine and I was done. </s>
<s> Sorry to hear your machine needs repair. </s>
<s> Did you call Dell while it was in warranty to have them correct this error? </s>
