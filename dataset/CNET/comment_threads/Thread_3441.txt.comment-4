I don't have the discs of the driver.
Search the service tag on Dell website brings up nothing to download from (not a single driver).
Where can I get it then?
Also, I believe the board is what makes the difference.
Using software like Everest, I know that the board is Intel with 865gv chipset.
So I go to Intel website to get the lastest driver.
All the drivers work perfectly except for the AC97 which cause BSOD on installation.
What should I do next?
