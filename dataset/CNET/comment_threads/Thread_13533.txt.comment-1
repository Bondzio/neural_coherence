I have heard somewhere that there is a size limit to HDD when used with a P2 or P3 computer and wondered if anyone knows because I am about to purchase a new HDD and don't want to get the wrong thing.
Maybe it was a limit on HDD size with the OS system used, I have no idea.
I have a P2 350mhz 256 ram and a 4ghz HDD and I also have a P3 400mhz 128ram and a 8gb HDD using Windows ME and XP.
These are my backup computers and still very functional and I would like to spruce them up a little so any help would be appreciated.
