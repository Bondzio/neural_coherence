Sorry thats a pun...my query is about memory, i currently have 1 stick of memory in my machine - Kingston 256mb 333Mhz DDR PC2700 - What i'm confused about is the 333mnz and the PC2700 parts, i'm looking for more memory but i'm not sure if i need to buy the same i.e PC2700 and 333mhz, can i mix and match?
for instance the one i'm looking at is 512mb 400Mhz PC3200, will this have any effect.
Rnning: P4 2.4Gb and XP Pro.
Thanks Goofs
