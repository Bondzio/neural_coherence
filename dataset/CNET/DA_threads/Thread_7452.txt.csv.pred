1.1.1	I have an AOPEN cd burner(CRW1632) that I want to put in my computer-It is a Vision PC-model P6STP-FL,intel celeron processor-1.00ghz-376mb of ram.How do I go about installing it,do I need other cables?It is an older computer(2001)Any help would be appreciated	St
1.2.1	The Vision website wasn't very helpful.	St
1.2.2	But this shouldn't be too much of a problem.	St
1.2.3	I do need more info before I can give you the proper instruction.	St
1.2.4	Expecially if you aren't used to getting into your machine.	St
1.2.5	I need to know how many harddrives and cdroms are installed on your system.	St
1.2.6	Also, tell me a little bit about your experience in taking apart systems.	Sug
1.2.7	Let me know.	St
1.2.8	and life goes on... Jack	St
1.3.1	Hi,thanks for the reply.I am a relatively capable installer.I have installed memory,and can take the side off the computer easily.It has one CD ROM(52x max),one harddrive (I guess)	St
1.4.1	OK. Take the side cover off the system and lay it on its side with the motherboard on the bottom.	St
1.4.2	If there is only one ribbon (flat) cable leading to the motherboard, determine that there is a &quot;secondary&quot; IDE connector on the motherboard.	St
1.4.3	Earlier motherboards place these connectors side-by-side.	St
1.4.4	If only one ribbon cable is used: Obtain another ribbon cable and install it with the new drive in an empty bay.	St
1.4.5	Either put the jumpers located in the rear of the drive at &quot;master&quot; or &quot;cable select (CS)&quot;.	St
1.4.6	Power up the system.	St
1.4.7	Install the CD that came with the drive, using the other CDROM.	St
1.4.8	Reboot and your new drive should be ready to go.	St
1.4.9	If two ribbon cables are used: You should connect the new drive on the same cable as the current CDROM.	St
1.4.10	Determine how the old drive is set by the jumpers.	St
1.4.11	You have a choice here.	St
1.4.12	Either make them both CS or one Master and the other Slave.	St
1.4.13	Do not make one CS and the other Master/Slave.	St
1.4.14	Windows doesn't like that.	St
1.4.15	Always make sure the system is unplugged when you do anything with the motherboard.	St
1.4.16	Hope this helps and let me know if you are confused about ANYTHING!	St
1.4.17	and life goes on... Jack	St
1.5.1	HI,me again.I put a memorex Forty Maxx in my computer,and am lost as to what to do.I think I have it all hooked up correctly,but I do not have an installation cd with this device.Any suggestions.Thanks	St
1.6.1	memorex.com and download the driver software and install it.	St
1.6.2	That should get the drive working.	Sug
