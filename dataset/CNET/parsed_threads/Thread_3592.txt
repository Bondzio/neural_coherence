<s> I am having windows 7 64bit and downloaded newest driver from nvidia Thanks In Advance </s>
<s> vga or dvi? </s>
<s> What is the video card resolution set at? </s>
<s> I am using vga and whenever i try to set 1600x900 resolution and error comes &quot;not optimum resolution. </s>
<s> please use 1600x900 mode&quot; currently i am using 1280x800 Thanks </s>
<s> if you like the 1280x800 and there isn't any setting that's closer to 1600x900 that you might like then I would just ignore the error message. </s>
<s> Their is 1600x900 setting present and when i choose that setting not windows but my moniter says that not optimum resolution it is an error message given by moniter not by system </s>
<s> If it does, try installing the driver to the computer and see what happen. </s>
<s> I am just guessing here because I have not run into problem such as yours, I have 2 such monitors also but not Samsung though. </s>
<s> I have installed driver even from cd and even also from website but not got a solution i had purchsed this moniter 2 yrs back and that time their was no problem with moniter everything worked fine but a few days ago when i reinstalled my windows 7 the problem stated also i have tried jolicloud webos and chrome os on same pc . </s>
<s> in both os everything worked fine so this problem is caused due to windows 7 ?? </s>
<s> any patches available for it? </s>
