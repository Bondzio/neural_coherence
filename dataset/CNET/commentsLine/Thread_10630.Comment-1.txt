hello, i recently started using a geforce fx5500 256mb ddr agp 8x graphics card, the problem is, whenever i open a game, the whole computer restarts when the game reaches the menu!
until now, i tried freelancer and age of mythology.
my specs processor: p4 1.7ghz ram: 256mb pc133 sdram agp: geforce fx5500 256mb ddr agp 8x os: win xp sp3 this might look like a thread from the stone ages by the looks of the game and specs, but please help me someone!!!
thanks.
