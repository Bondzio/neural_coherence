1.1.1	I'm getting a IDE cable to cut down on dust and I need to know if IDE cables are also compatible with dvd/cd drives.	St
1.2.1	Did you plan on getting round cables?	St
1.2.2	If so, they work just fine with CD/DVD drives.	St
1.2.3	I don't know about cutting down on dust but I suppose it makes sense as they reduce clutter.	St
1.2.4	Also a big help for cooling as they permit better airflow.	St
1.3.1	thanx alot	St
1.4.1	You're welcome.	St
1.4.2	C J	St
1.5.1	the IDE drive, be certain to not get one that is too long.	St
1.5.2	It can cause problems because some of the round ones have more cross talk and noise than the flat 80 conductor cables.	St
1.5.3	The flat ones also should not be any longer than necessary.	St
1.5.4	This does not apply to the ATAPI [optical/DVD et al] drives because their data rate is substantially lower.	St
