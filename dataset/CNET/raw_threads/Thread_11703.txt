I am putting together a new computer: ASUS P7H55-M LE mobo Intel i3-550 CPU Corsair XMS3 4GB ram Seagate Barracuda 1T HDD Liteon 24X DVD/CD writer Ultra 600W PSU All is assembled and plugged in, including the DVD/CD writer and the hdd. I am now testing hardware (Ubuntu live disk in the drive), and the system begins startup. It gets as far as giving the message: &quot;Reboot and select proper boot device or insert boot media in selected boot device and press a key&quot; Rebooting returns the same message. Same results with both Win 7 and Ubuntu 10.04 disks. Going into BIOS set up and looking at SATA devices shows nothing on SATA 1 (HDD) and on SATA 2, &quot;[ATAPI iHAS524 ] (the Liteon). The HDD does not show up in the list because the power connectors will not reach the HDD (thank you Ultra!) and I have an extender power cable on order. First question is should the lack of an operative HDD keep the CD from booting up? I think not, but just want to eliminate the obvious. Second, what would keep the Liteon from loading the Ubunutu CD? (I don't have another SATA optical drive to substitute test.)

One would imagine that booting from an iso that boots in another computer, and from a genuine Windows CD would be sufficient. But just on the off chance that both might be &quot;dodgy&quot; for this computer, I tried another CD (this a genuine Ubuntu CD) and it booted right up. I think that problem is solved, but I'll come back if any further hiccups. Thanks for your help.

What is the number of pins on the SATA cable that goes in to the back of an optical drive or a HDD? I hope it is 15.
