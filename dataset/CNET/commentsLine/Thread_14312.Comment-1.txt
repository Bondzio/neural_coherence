hey guys, i'm trying to get a clear answer here so i hope you can help me.
i'm about to change from a past decade old 17&quot; crt to an lcd for the first time.
going to get a 19' standard this time around and when more applications support widescreen then i'll upgrade.
for the moment though i know that the size of the lcd will give a 1280x1024 reso.
i've been told that lcd worked best on their native resolution and even though that is obvious i would like to know how it responds to lower settings.
i'm an old school gamer.
i play games like master of orion 2 and i still love my starcraft and diablo to name a few.
how would these look on an lcd?
i would be really disapointed in getting a screen that couldn't show some decently my all time fav games.
if brand helps in this query.
i'm currently looking at the samsung 932bf and the lg l1900r - both at 2ms and at 2000:1 and 3000:1 respectively of contrast ratio.
thx
