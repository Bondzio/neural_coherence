With your hardware, how can it get any better?
As was mentioned, over one Gig is overkill unless you're producing, ripping, converting, and burning DVDs.
Maybe your monitor is not up to the task.
Most people never consider upgrading the monitor.
If the pitch is .28 or above, a Terabyte of ram won't help.
How about your graphic card?
A bare bones card is the easiest to replace, and with a good monitor the results can be spectacular.
Just some thoughts.
