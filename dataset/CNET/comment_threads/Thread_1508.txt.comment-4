Hi Melati, when I plug in the airport express unit I always get the flashing yellow light which means that its out of range or something's not right.
Anyway when I run the airport express assistant it says that it can't find an existing network.
This is weird since on my PC there clearly is a network yet it doesn't show up on the Mac.
I'm puzzled as the manual is no help at all.
Ta.
