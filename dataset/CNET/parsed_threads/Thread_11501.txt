<s> I have a laptop that contains important information and a few older computers. </s>
<s> I want to standardize all computers with the same operating system, software, and files. </s>
<s> I want complete consistency with all computers. </s>
<s> These are all personal machines. </s>
<s> I have Norton Ghost but am not familiar with it. </s>
<s> How do I migrate disk images or my laptop's information for other computers, so they are all the same? </s>
<s> What you are asking for is currently not a feature of Windows or Ghost. </s>
<s> You should do more research why this is so. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> They don't have the same hardware, but all run Windows XP currently. </s>
<s> Just try it. </s>
<s> Take a hard disk from one machine to another. </s>
<s> It fails to boot. </s>
<s> Now take Office 2003/2007 from one machine to another. </s>
<s> It wants you to activate it. </s>
<s> There's a sign here that this OS and many applications are designed to fail when you do this. </s>

<s> I just want to know how to create a disk image and then deploy those to my other computers so that everything is standardized. </s>
<s> This is all I want to know! </s>
<s> Sorry but what you want to do can't be done today. </s>
<s> Unless the computers are identical in almost every way, the OS fails. </s>
<s> Then small differences in the ethernet MAC address, the hard disk serial number and such can cause XP to want to reactivate along with any other software that employs &quot;activation.&quot; What you want has been disabled at far too many levels for anyone to get fixes today. </s>
<s> There is a way if you were to move to a non-Windows OS. </s>
<s> Is that an option? </s>
<s> There is also the Virtual Machine method. </s>
<s> Look at VMWARE's offerings. </s>
<s> You could have a standard issue virtual machine. </s>
<s> But the time lost on deploying that could be a few man years. </s>
<s> Hope this sheds some light on the issue. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply Bob. </s>
<s> I do have Vmware server and access to the workstation version. </s>
<s> How could I wrap my current laptop disk image into a vmware image so that I can just run that off my other computers? </s>
<s> To get going. </s>
<s> It's too deep of a discussion for this small space but the product documentation should do and if not the price you paid included a few calls. </s>
