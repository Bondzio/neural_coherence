Specs A7N8X-E motherboard 512MB CMX3200 Corsair RAM Geforce4 TI 4200 AMD Athlon 2600+ Windows 2000 Pro I hope someone might be able to help me with this.
About 4 days ago my computer froze twice, the third time I restarted it would not go pass the POST screen, the one that shows A7N8X-E Deluxe screen.
I decided to clean out my computer with compressed air I had.
I removed most components to clean them.
After putting them back and turning up my computer now I couldn't see the screen or anything and there was no beep.
I'm not sure if I damaged something or something else is to blame.
I resetted my CMOS and still wasn't able to see anything on screen, the fan from my video card doesnt spin but works fine in this current computer.
I don't know what else to try or to have one of the parts be replaced.
Please if anyone can help me with this problem.
