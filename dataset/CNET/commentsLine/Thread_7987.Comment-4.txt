hey mike, i tried that out today but it didn't work as well for me as it did you, in fact it didn't work at all.
i pulled out the lithium battery to clear the cmos.
when i put it back in and restarted my pc i was still in the same boat as where i started.
any other ideas?
i'm about ready to just give it up.
