lenovo vs velocity same cpu speed (3ghz) same ram quantity (4gb) 250gb vs 320gb intel integrated vs 8500gt graphics an 8500gt is not a gaming video card.
a good video card (8800gs or hd3850) would cost about $120.
60 extra gig isn't that much... a 160gb external drive is about $80.
so, for $200 you could upgrade the lenovo to be much better than the velocity.
if you're not a gamer and don't need the extra 60gb, stick with the lenovo and enjoy your savings even more.
