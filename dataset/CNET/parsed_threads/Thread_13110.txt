<s> Hello All, I have a HP 1020 printer. </s>
<s> There are times when I'm not able to print to it. </s>
<s> When I look in the printers folder I see a &quot;copy 1 hp1020&quot; along with the hp1020 printer. </s>
<s> When I try to print to the &quot;copy 1 HP1020&quot; I'm then able to print. </s>
<s> I'm not sure how or why &quot;copy 1 hp1020&quot; is installing or why I'm not able to print to the original &quot;hp1020&quot; It usually happens after I reconnect my laptop when returning home from work. </s>
<s> I've had this happen with my HP 1100 printer also. </s>
<s> I'm using XP pro. </s>
<s> Thanks Bruce </s>
<s> Set the original as default and remove the copy? </s>
