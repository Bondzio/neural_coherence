hi, i've got a gateway desktop that i've upgraded the operating system to windows 7 64 bit.
it worked fine for the past month and all of a sudden, it started turning itself off as if someone has pressed the off button.
when i turn it back on, it asks me if i want to reboot in safe mode.
i've recently tried installing a new printer but the same issue occurs when i have unplugged my printer.
it does the same thing whether it's actively being used or being left unattended.
i don't think it's an overheating issue because it's located in a relatively cold room.
thanks
