1.1.1	win XP home edition with all the updates printer is Lexmark X-1150 all-in-one with both new ink cartridges My printer suddenly will not even try to print in black ink ... if I have a page to print of just words..it runs the paper through quickly without even trying to print ... if I change the color of the words it will slow down and actually print the words in color I have uninstalled the driver and got the new updated version of the driver and reinstalled it and it still will not work I called in to their tech people and the guy I talked to ... his best advice is to buy a new printer ... I would except I just bought two new ink cartridges for THIS printer ... a printer they no longer make by the way He did offer me a web site that had several other printers at a reduced price but of course the cartridges that come with them are the tiny ones with barely any ink in the cartridges and the cartridges I already have do not fit any of the special printer deals It can not be the cartridge because they did work for a couple of weeks before stopping printing also the color one I just got still works I cleaned the black ink cartridge as per his instructions ... I cleaned the printer where the cartridge plugs in but it is not even trying to use the black cartridge Why would my printer suddenly not recognize the black cartridge ?	Ques
1.1.2	This is an all-in-one device and everything else works perfectly BTW It does know there is a black cartridge in the printer because there is a window to troubleshoot the machine and it shows it knows both cartridges are correctly inserted and are both still full So why the heck does n't it try to print in black ink ? !
