<s> I have XP and Ubuntu in one machine. </s>
<s> I bought the machine a year and a half ago and it came with XP, then I installed Ubuntu 10.10 and have been using that -- getting familiar with it -- for the past two weeks. </s>
<s> I have the computer and all peripherals plugged into a power bar with a switch. </s>
<s> At night, after shutting down the computer, I usually turn off this switch, cutting all power to everything. </s>
<s> This has been my routine and I've had no problem with it for over a year. </s>
<s> Now, since I started using Ubuntu, pushing the start button does not start the computer on the first try if I follow my old routine. </s>
<s> I turn on the main power (power bar switch), and push the Power On button, but nothing happens. </s>
<s> Only after turning the main off again then on again, will the computer start normally. </s>
<s> Or, if I turn off the power at the back of the computer instead, then on again, it will start. </s>
<s> Or, if I shut down the computer normally and do not switch off the power bar, the computer starts by pushing the button as it should. </s>
<s> It's as if the computer doesn't like being disconnected from the main power source. </s>
<s> (This surely sounds ridiculous -- I feel ridiculous writing this...) So I must ask: Is there any reason for this behavior? </s>
<s> Do computers with dual boot or Ubuntu have some power setting or something to explain this? </s>
<s> Or does this mean that some doom awaits on the horizon? </s>
<s> Any light would be most appreciated. </s>
<s> Check in advanced power setting to see if you have one for what to do when power is lost. </s>
<s> If so, see if there is an option that says something like &quot;Return to previous state&quot; rather than remain off. </s>
<s> I remember having to do this with some ASUS builds if I wanted to turn the PC back on by just turning the main switch on rather than just bring up the PS control voltage. </s>
<s> I looked around and can't find that option. </s>
<s> It works fine as long as I don't unplug it, so that's what I'll have to do for now. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
