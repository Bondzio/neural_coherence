I decided to drop the ASUS name then since all they have in the price area is intel chipsets, and went with a EVGA ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813188026 ) Let me know what you think or if you can find a better one for under 200 dollars let me know.
I think this should easily support the dual graphics card set up I want to do.
Again thanks for the input.
