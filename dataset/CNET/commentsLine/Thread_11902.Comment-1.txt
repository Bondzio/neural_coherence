hi, i just formatted my hd and tried to install the vga drivers downloaded from the nvidia site.
the dowload goes ok but when running the setup it gives an error 'cant find drivers for your hardware'.
im certain i dowloaded the right drivers for my card.
i've done this 10 times or so and this has never happend.
any help apreciated.
the manufacturer of the card is eagle.
system: pentium iii 733mhz 256mb ram windows xp eagle nvidia geforce2 mx400
