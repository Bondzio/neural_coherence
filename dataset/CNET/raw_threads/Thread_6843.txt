Or does this just mean I should get 800 and I can overclock it up to 1200... or what? I'm thinkin I can put the 1066's in there because one the reviewers says he did... Sorry never built a computer before, still trying to figure this all out. This is the motherboard http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813188013 Thanks -Hendrik

I was on the verge of buying a pair of g.skills that wernt listed on the evga supported-ram site &gt;:-| Probably woulda caused a major headache im not in need of. At any rate, as I was saying, not new to computers but kinda new to buildin em from scratch. So heres bout what I came up with in my attempt to build a high-end multi-purpose pc on a mid-range budget. Please let me know your thoughts!

GSKill is good RAM in fact I have 4GB of the PC1066 in a GigaByte MB. Re the MB...I'd recommend looking for something with a newer chipset. If I recall correctly at one time there were problems with the 680i and the Q6600. Maybe the 780i Re the HDD...take a look at the WD6400AAKS...640GB Re the PCP PSU....you'll like that ! VAPCMD
