See, it's just that kind of talk (reveal if the DHCP address is valid) that makes me feel like an idiot!
I can only tell you at this point that if I open look at the ZA &quot;zones&quot; on the other three computers (yes, I have it installed on all of the systems) there is an &quot;adapter subnet&quot; that does, indeed, start with 192.168 They seem to be associated with the wireless adapters on those computers.
On the &quot;main&quot; computer (the desktop I have re-installed ZA on, and which is the one that is actually connected physically to the Linksys) there is a listing for a Realtec Fast ethernet NIC.
(Could this be the built-in Ethernet adapter?)
Sorry I am such a dummy when it comes to networking stuff.
