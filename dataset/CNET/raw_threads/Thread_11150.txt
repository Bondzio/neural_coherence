Network must be fine if I am able to download apps and watch online ?

Samsung has had server issues (they don't like to read that, they call it something else.) And we know that the time it takes the new server address time to get the addresses out to the DNS at the ISPs. I'm going to break my rule about acronyms here and ask you to google acronyms that are new to you first, then ask if you can't find them. With that out of the way, Samsung network issues are plentiful and vary depending on the country. Since governments mandate that certain content does not flow freely (a discussion on its own!) we have to hear more about what country this is in as well as try a few things. My favorite easy fix is to set our router to use the Google DNS (see google and type in Google DNS for info.) I'd start with that as well as setting the date and time on the BD 5300. Bob
