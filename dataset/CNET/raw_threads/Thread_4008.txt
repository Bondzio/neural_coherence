On powerup the computer does absolutely nothing. Nothing appears on screen... The hard drive light doesn't blink, the PC appears to be frozen. What I have done so far: Tried HD on another PC - works fine Tried working monitor on this PC - still no image replaced 420W power supply - still no system response I am not sure what else to check... RAM, motherboard, CPU? The CPU fan is spinning on powerup. Any suggestions?

Such machines exhibit this &quot;hard starting&quot; issue. (or non-starting.) Here's an article with pictures for you to check your motherboard for this issue -&gt; http://www.pcstats.com/articleview.cfm?articleID=195 The other repeating problem source are PCs with too small power supplies. While the machine may work fine for months, eventually the &quot;just big enough&quot; power supply starts to age and the symptom is one like yours. I'll supply an article about how to select the size and then another about how they lie about the rated size. http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/ http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20021021/ The too small power supply can accelerate the capacitor issue. To dive in deeper, remove all cards, memory, IDE cables and see if it BEEPS in protest. If not, you are looking at the possible bad parts. Even the CMOS battery is suspect. Bob
