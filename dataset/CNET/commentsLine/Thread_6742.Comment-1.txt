a friend gave me a stick of ram that he wasn't using anymore.
i would like to know how to tell if it will work in my computer.
my computer is a dell dimension 2100, running windows me.
it has one 128mb stick of ram in it.
i think it uses sdram but i'm not positive.
any help anyone can give me would be appreciated.
thanks!
