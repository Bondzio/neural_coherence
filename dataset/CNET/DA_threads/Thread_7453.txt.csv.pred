1.2.1	http : //reviews.cnet.com/eMachines_T6524/4505-3118_7-31556305.html notes this has the x16 PCI Express slot so you ca n't go get some AGP card .	St
1.2.2	You 'll have to pick an PCI Express card based on how far out you want to go .	St
1.2.3	ATI has a dual GPU video card with 1 gigabyte of video RAM but that is on the extreme side of upgrades .	St
1.2.4	Your choice is usually determined by a budget .	St

1.4.1	Many of the Graphix Card manufacturers can scan your system on line .	St
