I`ve no idea what I did; today the blasted thing is listed under Apple Profiler as fully enabled and burns anything I want.
I still can`t start up in OS 9; even the Norton disk won`t start up; it hangs up after the startup screen.
I did put in a new Sonnet processor back in September (Sonnet Encore/ST G4), but on the box it states that the upgrade requires OS X and OS 9.2 and that 9.2 IS supported.
I`m getting OS 10.4.2 Monday and will upgrade; I hope it helps.
I still have a ton of legacy software, or I`d give up on OS 9.
