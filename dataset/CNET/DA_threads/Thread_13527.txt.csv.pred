1.1.2	I have decided I want to try to build my first computer .	St
1.1.3	I know a pretty good amount about computers compared to the normal person , but not nearly as much as most on this site ( from reading peoples posts ) .	St
1.1.4	I thought I might try to take a stab and see if people out there could help .	St
1.1.5	Situation : This computer is NOT going to be for gaming it is going to be for work purposes .	St
1.1.6	My work is 100 % on a computer .	St
1.1.7	I am an architect and use it all day .	St
1.1.8	I use Auto CAD , Photoshop , Illustrator etc ... At any given time I have 5-10 programs open all working together , surfing the internet and listening to music .	St
1.1.9	The computer I have now ALWAYS freezes and it drives me crazy .	St
1.1.10	Sometimes I lose info I am working on .	St

1.1.15	Thank you for your time and advice in advance !	St
1.1.16	!	St
1.2.1	How much RAM are you shooting for ?	Ques
1.3.1	Of the software you are using or may use in the future which softwares system requirements are the most demanding ?	Ques
1.3.2	Once you determine that then these requirements would be your new computers minimum system requirements .	St
1.3.3	A software program has a footprint of resources it uses so if you are using more than 1 program at a time your new computer will need to walk with all its feet .	St
1.3.4	The point is you need to figure out what your new computers total system requirements will be .	St
1.3.5	The software becomes your guide as to what you build .	St
1.3.6	By 2 monitors do you mean you want a continuous desktop or 2 monitors displaying the same thing ?	Ques
1.3.7	Because your are running so many apps at the same time do you feel you need a bigger desktop ?	Ques
1.3.8	If that is the case you need to pick a video card that can do a continuous desktop .	St
1.3.9	Then make sure the card comes with connections that will hook to the monitors you want to use .	Sug
1.3.10	The resolution and refresh rate of those monitors and video card must be high enough to allow you to work comfortably .	St
1.3.11	Because you use your current computer for work can you afford to scrap it for parts to build the new one ?	Ques
1.3.12	I would recommend keeping it in a fully functional state while you build your new computer .	Sug
1.3.13	I often find that during a build I need to get drivers , check specs , and get advice/support .	St
1.3.14	So having a working computer around is very handy .	St
1.3.15	The perfect PC is just a compromise of what you want and what you can get .	St
1.3.16	With more info from you , I can recommend components with more confidence .	St
1.3.17	At this level of input I can only be very general as to what to begin to look for .	St
