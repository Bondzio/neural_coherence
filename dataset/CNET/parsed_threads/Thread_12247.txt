<s> Ok guys when I first bought my comp I hooked it up to my 42&quot; HDTV screen through the vga cable. </s>
<s> Back then I didn't have a vid card and now I do. </s>
<s> My vid card is a XFX 7600 GT XXX with DVI and S-Video outputs. </s>
<s> I hooked up my comp to the big screen through the dvi cable and its not working. </s>
<s> I also tried through the s-video but no signal was being produced. </s>
<s> What could be the problem? </s>
<s> Does my comp need special drivers from it? </s>
<s> please help </s>
<s> stick with the dvi connection and right click the desktop, select display properties, and click the settings tab. </s>
<s> your tv should be monitor #2. </s>
<s> crap man i activated the hd feature on the card. </s>
<s> it restarted and now no signal comes out. </s>
<s> i plugged in the hd screen and no signal nor does a signal come out on my regualar screen. </s>
<s> what can i do man? </s>
<s> i turn on the comp and the windows logo and a few other windows pages load but after the last windows logo the screen doest get a signal. </s>
<s> i think the card is looking for hd screen. </s>
