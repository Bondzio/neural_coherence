ok. i download movie torrents and the cinavia is having a big impact on my streaming to my ps3.
should i buy a set top box with streaming capabilities?
or a video card with hdmi out and buy a really long hdmi cable?
i like the ability to control what i watch from the couch.
the set top box would let me do that.
if i go the video card route, is there a way to control my pc from the couch?
