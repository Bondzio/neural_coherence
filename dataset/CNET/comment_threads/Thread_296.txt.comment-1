hello, i just did a clean reinstall, abit kd7a mobo, soundblaster live!
5.1 win 2000, but now my audio sounds like its underwater-- I think it's out of phase somehow.
I recall having this problem before but can't remember the fix!
creative labs site says my driver is up to date.
any ideas on how to fix?
thanks!
