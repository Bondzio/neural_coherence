<s> I'm going to upgrade my computer soon. </s>
<s> So i'll have: AMD Sempron 3300 2GHZ 1GB RAM Sony 16x/48X DVD ROM Drive Nvidia GeForce 6600 I'm wondering what games I could run smoothly with these specs? </s>
<s> I've heard that Sempron is better than Celeron for gaming. </s>
<s> I'm particulary interested in playing FPS's, Half Life 2, Far Cry, Halo etc. </s>
<s> Could I play these smoothly? </s>
<s> (I'm doubting I can play F.E.A.R?) </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> All. </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> I would only need to trim back on the display pixel count or size from x by y to 800 by 600 or maybe a few less effects. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Not all. </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> Many of those games are programmed to take advantage of hardware that has yet to be designed. </s>

<s> Thanks Bob, very.. </s>
<s> In depth. </s>
<s> I'm still deciding on what graphics card to get, and the RADEON X700SE seems appealing.. </s>
<s> Still, could all change. </s>
<s> Any other opinions? </s>
<s> But I'd skip the sempron and head to any 64-bit CPU offering. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'm on a budget </s>
<s> havent played far cry but i have played halo, half life 2 and splintercell chaos theory on a system built around a AMD 64 3200+ and an x700 pro and they've all done quite well. </s>
<s> so do i surmise from your post that the 6600 isnt the GT model or above? </s>
<s> if it is a Gt model most would reccomend that over the x700 pro. </s>
<s> half life 2 i run into some issues with parts of the HUD display being out of place if i use i think anything more than 2x anti-aliasing. </s>
<s> the other one i can run without too much trouble. </s>
<s> as far as perfornance goes, i run 1024x768 and there's only 1 spot in half life 2 where the graphics lag any and that's a spot where the game is having to render the sky as well as a swirling fan underwater. </s>
<s> aside from that spot all the rendering is quite good and doesnt affect gameplay at all. </s>
<s> have yet to try the game with HDR as i cant remember if that's a possible option in the game but in the small episode valve released to showcase it when it was on i had some studders in the display but we're talking very intensive graphics rendering here. </s>
<s> sunlight reflecting off wet sand and off moist rocks those sorts of things... chaos theory i've also got at 1024x768 and occasionally when i've got night visions on it'll studder a bit. </s>
<s> havent had any problems with halo as i dont think it's really pushing my hardware at all. </s>
<s> as far as f.e.a.r goes you should have no problem playing it at the lower end of the graphical spectrum. </s>
<s> the min requirements are well below your specs so you should be safe. </s>
<s> it takes a 1.7 celron you're more or less 3ghz equiv sempron, 512ram you're 1024, 64 vid memory, you'd be 256 with an x700 pro. </s>
<s> not sure aobut the sound but i would imagine any audigy 2 card would do the trick quite nicely </s>
