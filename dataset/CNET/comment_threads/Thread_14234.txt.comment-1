I am in need of a upgrade for my main computer.
I mostly use that computer for gaming and graphic/web design.
I have never used AMD so I am not sure if I want or can come up with a good system based off their CPU's.
However, if someone can come up with some ideas for highend AMD system that will work with what I have in mind; I may take a look.
I will list the parts I have come up with so far and I would love to hear any feedback.
Also, I have a limit of about 2300 to spend.
