The era of Ram-doublers and such were pretty much shown to be nothing but a scam. Instead, simple reading of the Optimizing Windows or the Memory articles at http://www.aumha.org/articles.htm would pay off well if you run Windows. Linux has its own memory management and has improved steadily. Even with that, some may find such to be useful, but I've never used any except to debunk the software. Bob

If you have win98 or better, you really don't need any &quot;ram managers&quot; or such as the benefit isn't worth loading the pgm.. Actually, when you remove the pgm. the ram space it used is returned to the system is a plus. If you run win95, you should get some improvemnt and even then, why are you using win95. Unless, you system uis so screwed-up or being doggy, get a systems ultiies that clean the registry and defrag the HDs for a better result of overall system performance. If you haven't already, increase &quot;physical ram&quot; while costs are very low as a true system benefit. good luck -----Willy
