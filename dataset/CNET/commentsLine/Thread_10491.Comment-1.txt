i'm trying to find the best bang for the buck configuration for a 4 monitor desktop.
my desire is to use 4 viewsonic vx2025wm's (which received high marks in its review here) running in their native resolution (1680 x 1050) turned 90 degrees (portrait orientation).
i'm considering using 2 xfx geforce 8800 gts (320mb) cards to drive them.
i have a dual pci express slot motherboard with a core duo processor and i'm running xp sp2.
i believe my most demanding application will be video editing.
i use the xbox 360 for games.
i have a few questions that i can't seem to get a straight answer to: 1. is changing the output orientation from landscape to portrait a video card software issue or an xp issue, i.e.
does xp sp2 support this directly?
2. does this xfx card support running in a dual card configuration?
3. should i upgrade to the 640 mb card?
