Everything I have was working fine until last night but now isn't. I have a Linksys Cisco wireless router, WRT54G2. On the other end of the house I have a D-link DI-604 router that I had set up to act as a hub. I don't know why it stopped working and I can't get it going again. The Linksys is set up with DHCP enabled. Its local IP address is 192.168.1.1. The starting IP address is 192.168.1.100 and the maximum number of users is 50. As I understand it, this means the Linksys will assign IPs from 1.100 to 1.149. As far as I can tell, the Linksys is working fine. It has a wired Apple and a wireless Windows laptop connected to it, both internet connections are working fine. The default IP address for the D-Link is 192.168.0.1. According to what I can find, I need to change the default IP of the D-Link to be in the network range of the Linksys, disable DHCP in the D-Link, connect a cable from a LAN port on the Linksys to a LAN port on the D-Link, and the rest of the LAN ports on the D-Link should simply act as if they were additional LAN ports on the Linksys. I want to be sure what my options are for changing the default D-Link address. It can be anything from 192.168.1.2 to 1.99 or 1.150 to 1.255, correct? It just can't in the range the Linksys DHCP assigns to its devices, 1.100 to 1.149. Correct me if I'm wrong. I've done that several times but when I power-cycle the D-Link or reboot my Windows PC (different from the laptop) I can no longer log into the D-Link at the address I assigned to it and I get a 'Limited or no connectivity' message. I don't know what else I need to do. The WAN setting on the D-Link is Dynamic IP, I don't know if that matters. I have tested the D-Link by connecting it directly to my modem and it works fine so I know it's not broken. Please help!

You'd probably want to put it within the same range as the Linksys but outside of the DHCP allocation range so what you're suggesting is correct. I suspect you cannot log into the D-link because your PC is out of it's range. What you can do is disconnect your PC from the rest of the network and connect it to the D-link only. If it's still DHCP enabled, it will give you an IP address and you can access its web interface. If it's not DHCP enabled, you just give your PC a static address within the range of what you've assigned to the D-link. This should allow you to configure it and save the settings. Of course, you only get to do this once until you re-enable DHCP and put both your PC and the D-link back on the LAN.

I don't understand why I can't log back into the D-Link from my Windows PC using the address I assigned to the D-Link. I -can- do that, but only until the D-Link or the Windows PC are rebooted, then it doesn't work.

(&gt;_&lt;;) Looks like that port on my Linksys is fried. Thanks anyway, all.
