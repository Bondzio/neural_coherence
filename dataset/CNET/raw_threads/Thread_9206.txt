The computer choice is fairly easy till I get to the GPU. Planning on getting something like Corel Draw, but I haven't used any more hardcore programs of this type yet, so I have no idea what to look for. One configuration is an i5 760 with a 1GB NVIDIA GT330. There are other more GPUs offered, but to get a better choice of more &quot;pro&quot; oriented cards, I have to look more at a Precision line for more money. Does the combo I'm looking decent for running something like CD? The main thing is I don't want to spend all the money on a box where the MoBo won't accept a useable card. Thanks!

I'm looking at Dells because I think their Pro Support is decent and this being for work, I want someone I can rely on to call for support and get it fixed quick should something go haywire. Rob

Yes I see the newer PCIe power connections but only a person from a decade ago might call them proprietary. The motherboards (most) take standard PCIe video cards so not much to write there but the motherboard do tend to have the Dell 4 LED diagnostic lights but how else to deliver hardware diagnostics for all?

11592	9	512696	5061236	5060989	Rob10	1/8/11 6:28 PM	1.29451128E12	It's not like a small form factor case...	but it's not as big as a Studio XPS 9100. I don't need that much HP. I realize I won't be able to go with a monster 3D card, but I don't need to. Just one that's big &quot;enough&quot;. (I believe tha Precision workstation T1500 doesn't have a bigger case, and it's AutoCAD certified) Starting to see I really don't need that powerful of a card.
