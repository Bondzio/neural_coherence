on a few machines i run the seti program in the background.
that program loves l2 (and l1) cpu cache.
when i had 2 nearly identical p4's of the same clock rate but one had double the l2 cache, the one with double the cache was finishing many percentage points ahead of the other unit.
there are benchmarks you can run to discern the differences and you have to run your game or such to see if you can feel it, but the nod to more l2 cache is always there.
i hope this is a good enough explanation.
if not, there is this howstuffworks web site that disects computers and most parts so you can see how it plays in the big system.
