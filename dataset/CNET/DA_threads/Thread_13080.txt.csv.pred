1.1.5	I am planning on using the following fan : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16835118116 Thank you .	St
1.2.1	The fan that you want to replace is pretty good for the card , but keep in mind that graphic cards these days demand huge amounts of power , thus creating huge amounts of heat .	St
1.2.2	If you want to keep your video card stable and keep it cool , then I suggest getting a water cooling system for your PC , and a water block cooler for your graphics card .	St
1.2.3	You can find some good deals at www.tigerdirect.com or www.newegg.com Good Luck !	St
1.3.1	At the moment , I can not afford water cooling .	St
1.3.2	My power supply is also at the bottom of my case , so if it leaks , there will be a big problem .	St
1.3.3	Am I correct in assuming that I have to unscrew the black frame off of the graphics card ?	Ques
1.3.4	Would that damage anything ?	Ques
1.4.1	As for damage , well , be careful .	St
