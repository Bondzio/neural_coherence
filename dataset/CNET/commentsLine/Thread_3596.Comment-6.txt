you can move between the screens if you can run the game in a window.
some games like wow allow you to do that.
you just have to select that in the games video options.
for the games that run in a window it's great so that you can im or run other apps at the same time as playing.
after you go with dual monitors you'll never want to go single again, it makes so many things so much easier.
also, i use a crt and lcd combination.
