<s> Hello all, I'm building a new pc and I was looking at which CPU i was going to use. </s>
<s> can some one go to the link below (a comparison of two I am looking at) and tell me why the price is different by so much? </s>
<s> Intel Core2 Quad Q9450 2.66GHz Socket LGA775, 1333MHz, 12MB, 319.00 Intel Core 2 Quad Q6700 2.67GHz Socket LGA775, 1066MHz 8MB, 448.99 http://www.komplett.ie/k/kcp.aspx?sku=344758&sku=338086 Thanks for reading. </s>
<s> The faster chip has lower yields so you pay more. </s>
<s> I'm glad you provided the web link, as I used that to compare. </s>
<s> You'll find the manufacturing process is 45n vs 65n. </s>
<s> The newer 45n means you pay for the new machinery and you got the latest and greatest cpu under that process. </s>
<s> Also, the attached cache, etc. </s>
<s> make for improvements overall, but if they can fitted in the same amt. </s>
<s> of limited die space and more for later cpu releases, you're supporting the newest cpu effectively which is always higher in cost. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> the Penryn CPUs (45nm) are selling for less than 65nm parts because Intel is determined to take block AMD's Barcelona from establishing a toehold in the mainstream PC & server markets. </s>
<s> Seems to be working and AMD had to drop back to tri-core for Phenom to make money. </s>
<s> You are getting an incredible deal for the price of the 45nm Yorkfields. </s>
<s> Less energy, cooler and same performance as higher clocked Kentsfields. </s>
<s> Read these if you so care about differences. </s>
