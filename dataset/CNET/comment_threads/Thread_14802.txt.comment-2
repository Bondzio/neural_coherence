When you add a second disk normally the Bios does not ask for boot order every time you run the PC.
I have 3 hard disks on my computer and my Bios does not asks about this because it has not an option about this.
Check your Bios if there is an option that every time you run your PC to ask about boot order.
I think that there is an option somewhere in your Bios.
Check it again.
