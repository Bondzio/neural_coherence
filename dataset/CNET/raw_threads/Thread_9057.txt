I have two OS on my system, windows xp professional and windows vista business, when starting the machine, cold boot, we usually come across the initial screen where RAMs are counted and then comes the screen where we have to choose between the two OS systems, now here's the catch, during all that time, no matter how much I tried to use my keyboard to choose an operation system or even go into the boot screen, using the del or esc keys, nothing happens. I end up connecting another microsoft keyboard that has both a USB and serial connection, through the serial connection only, where the system responds, and moves on to open the OS windows for me. can someone tell me why does this happen, why doesn't the system respond to my bluetooth keyboard?

If your BIOS does, it's in some menu and may have words like USB, Keyboard, Mouse and/or Emulation. But you elected to tell nothing about the host machine so this is all I can offer. Bob

When I connected a USB keyboard to the computer it worked fine, but when I connect the bluetooth keyboard through the shingle it doesn't work at all. so the question is does a keyboard that connect to the computer using bluetooth shingle, should work like a USB keyboard connected directly to the PC? regards ashraf kadry

Thank you again Bob, truely appreciate it.. regards ashraf kadry
