bob, thanks again, i got a little farther and i did have an sp2 version to try, but when it asks for the driver it only wants it from a floppy drive, which on the dp35dp mb, i don't have.
i can install an eide drive and load windows on it, then install the 500gb sata drive and partition etc?
more help would be great.
thanks tom
