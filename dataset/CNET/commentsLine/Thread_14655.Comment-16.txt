motherboard: gigabyte ga-z77x-ud5h.
recently i had &quot;power surge on hub port a usb device has exceeded the power&quot; issue.
solution for me was to flash bios from version f4 to the latest f14.
this is easy procedure even for begginers thanks to q-flash.
read motherboard manual for procedure steps.
