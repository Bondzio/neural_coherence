1.1.1	Hi, I was thinking of buying a good mouse.	St
1.1.2	I would usually use it for portable use with macbook.	St
1.1.3	Any mouse is okay, as long as you don't need a power socket.	St
1.1.4	I have big hands so ergonomics counts alot.	St
1.1.5	I also care about the features of the mouse too!	St
1.1.6	My choices so far: Microsoft Arc Mouse Microsoft Explorer/ Explorer Mini Logitech Vx Nano You guys are welcome to give more suggestions.	St
1.1.7	I mainly want to see the other people's opinions about these mice and any problems that may have arisen after usage, since I don't want to encounter the problems with a mouse AFTER I buy it.	St
1.1.8	Thanks alot	Polite
1.2.1	It has one and only one quirk.	St
1.2.2	It sleeps a lot.	St
1.2.3	That is the first millimeter of movement when it's been sitting still might be ignored.	St
1.2.4	It's there but not a killer reason for me to change it out.	St
1.2.5	I'd buy it again.	Sug
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thank you for the advice.	St
1.3.2	I have seen the v450 nano.	St
1.3.3	It would be one of my choices as well.	St
1.3.4	However, I was really looking for a prosumer kind of mouse, like the vx nano (different from v450 nano)	St
1.4.1	Our family now has 3 of the 450 nanos.	St
1.4.2	I'm unsure why I'd get the other one today.	Sug
