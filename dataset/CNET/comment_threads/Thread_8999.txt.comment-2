If your flash drive is larger than the HD, you may be able to copy it over but this isn't going to make it bootable or save you from a hard drive failure.
As well, if your HD is NTFS, you may have trouble getting larger files to copy to the flash drive.
These tend to be formatted in FAT32 and you'd need to change that to NTFS.
You'd really only copy your data and not your programs to the flash drive anyway.
They won't run from the flash drive and only take up space unnecessarily.
