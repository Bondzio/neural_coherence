14803	0	270421	2621301	NR	panja57	11/3/07 7:52 AM	1.19407632E12	Connection keeps dropping	I have a Netgear WGR614v3, and ever since I've set it up, the connection drops every few hours (sometimes more than that). Restarting the router does the trick, but it's a big problem. I have a Comcast cable connection, and there's no problem when the modem and computer are directly connected. My main computer is connected to the router via ethernet, and then about 3 or 4 of my housemates connect over the wireless. I've updated the firmware, enabled WPA, broadcast the SSID. Any idea what's causing the constant disconnections? Is this an interference problem? Something to do with IP addresses? Or is Netgear just unreliable?

If the interference is due to a microwave or something like that, is there anything that can be done? Or should I just switch to one of the different wireless bandwidths? Thanks for your speedy reply!

I'm not kidding. Read http://forums.extremeoverclocking.com/t254852.html The links at the bottom lead you to possible fixes. But this is not the router to have if you use P2P. Bob
