<s> My parents have an eMachines desktop which was working fine until a couple weeks ago when Windows XP started shutting down almost as soon as they turned it on. </s>
<s> Sometimes it completes the startup and is on for a few minutes before it shuts down. </s>
<s> Other times it starts shutting down before the startup is complete. </s>
<s> What's really bizarre is that it also started coming on by itself after being off for several days. </s>
<s> They had to unplug it to get it to stop booting up in the middle of the night. </s>
<s> Anyone ever seen this problem before? </s>
<s> The first thing I do is remove the cover to see if the heatsinks are still where they belong and then I do the yearly dusting and cleaning. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Tried that, but it's still doing the same thing. </s>
<s> What would make a computer power on by itself? </s>
<s> It's not just in hybernation mode, the switch had been turned off when it came back on... </s>
<s> Besides motherboard defects you can set many machines to power up at a specific time or by mouse or keyboard in the BIOS settings. </s>
<s> I'll let you research those settings. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Go in the bios section and verify &quot;no wake-up&quot; setting is enabled plus any power setting whatever they should be. </s>
<s> Verify all bios setting and save regardless, if change or not before exiting. </s>
<s> Next, I strongly believe the PSU/power supply is going kaput. </s>
<s> It has been compromised in some way and basically only a replacement will do. </s>
<s> If there is no surge protection, get some as possible outside AC line glitches can reek havoc on a pc's psu. </s>
<s> Going on/off suggest a psu problem but as a bios offering wake-up can do the same on a remote level. </s>
<s> Power spikes/surges, or lulls can be at fault too, so if experienced look for electrical pros to handle that side if need be. </s>
<s> I've seen these types of problems due to various causes and nothing can be taken for granted and its a hit-or-miss fix sometimes. </s>
<s> good luck tada -----Willy </s>
