1.1.1	Hello!	St
1.1.2	I'm new to the forums and i've been having massive problems with my new LG GGW-H20L Blu Ray/HD-DVD internal SATA drive!	St
1.1.3	i installed the drive, plugged in the SATA power connector from my PSU, and connected the drive to the motherboard.	St
1.1.4	BIOS and Windows XP SP3 both recognise the drive, but when I put a disc in (even a DVD) the blue LED on the drive flashes but the dvd wont play!	St
1.1.5	when i try to open it in My Computer it normally just crashes my PC.	St
1.1.6	Any ideas?!	St
1.1.7	Any help would be greatly appreciated!!	St

1.5.1	I have one of the drive and as far as using it as a dvd drive, no special hardware/software was needed.	St
1.6.1	I have submitted the problem to LG UK so i hope they get back to me.	St

1.6.3	its got the latest firmware too.	St
1.6.4	I have read that it could be a conflict with the nforce chipset of my motherboard?	St
1.6.5	if so, how could i fix this?	St
