I am looking to buy a bluetooth device that can be connected to a desktop computer and used to send out text messages and multimedia to cell phones within a range of 500 meters or more.
I am not familiar with this type of technology, so I'm not sure what type of device I need to purchase or where I could purchase it.
Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.
