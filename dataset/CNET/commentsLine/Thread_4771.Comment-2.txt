take the the watts your computer is using then divide that number by 1000. this will give you kw (kilowatts).
multiply the kw by your current electrical charge.
this should be on your electric bill and is read in cents per kwh (kilowatt hour).
that will give you the cost per hour of running your computer.
example of your computer running at 450 watts: 450 watts / 1000 = .45 .45 x $.065 (charge per kwh) = $.03 per hour of use
