I'm sure I read here somewhere (can't find the link)that CloneCD deletes crucial files and causes this problem...does anyone know how to remedy it? My DVD drive is a Samsung SD-616-T, and yes, i've tried Samsungs site but couldn't find a cure. All help greatfully appreciated!

Excuse my ignorance, but i've used the windows search function for the file name HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318} but I just get a message saying that it is not a valid folder...
