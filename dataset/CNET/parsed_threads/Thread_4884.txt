<s> I have an 1100a with the attached scanner. </s>
<s> Worked fine on my old PC (400mHz P-2, w2k). </s>
<s> Moved to a newer PC (3gHz P-4, w2k) and the scanner doesn't work. </s>
<s> Gives error: &quot;! </s>
<s> UNABLE TO LOCATE SCANNER Unable to start a scan session. </s>
<s> Device is disconnected.&quot; Tried to query HP support, no reply, probably because 1100a is no longer supported. </s>
<s> Bought a CD which I hoped would be a newer driver but when installed, fails in the same way. </s>
<s> And it was the same 4.3.2.50 release even though the part number on the CD was different. </s>
<s> I installed the software on my laptop (500mHz P-3, w2k) and it works fine although if I unplug the parallel port cable I get the same error message. </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be appreciated. </s>
<s> These tend to not work on new machines (port speed changed) or the OS isn't installed proper (motherboard drivers). </s>
<s> You didn't share the gritty details. </s>
<s> If you supplied just what you did in your post above, HP and others may just write you off. </s>

<s> Its on a parallel port (tried LPT1 & LPT2) and except that some of the older ones were not bidirectional am not aware of any settings it can do. </s>
<s> Of course it could be flakeyness in the MB/BIOS as I have found other glitches in this MB (ECS 848P-A) and I am considering scrapping it and putting in a better one. </s>
<s> I selected it because it was on sale together with the P-4. </s>
<s> What would I look for in the BIOS? </s>

<s> The new screamer machines are just too fast on the parallel ports. </s>
<s> I did have a few clients that would never say die and the fix was to install a PCI LPT card. </s>
<s> The timing appears to be the older centronics speed then. </s>
<s> But it cost as much as a new USB scanner! </s>

<s> Sorry for the delay getting back to you Bob. </s>
<s> As a matter of fact I have already done that with a PCI card from SIIG with identical results. </s>
<s> I already have another scanner, not a USB but on a parallel port (shared with another printer). </s>
<s> It works fine on LPT1 (haven't tried it on the SIIG card (LPT2)). </s>
<s> What I like about this scanner (and I suspect that any new scanner would be different) is that its a sheet feed, which scans a page in seconds and I am able to feed additional sheets in which is especially handy when I am sending a multi-page fax. </s>
<s> The flatbed scanner takes several minutes per page and can only do one page at a time. </s>
<s> A multi-page fax takes too long and must be saved as multiple winfax attachments to send as a fax. </s>
