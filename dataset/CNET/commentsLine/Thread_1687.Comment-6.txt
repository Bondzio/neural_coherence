in no uncertain words, i would not put a stick into a machine i am not willing to sacrifice to test the stick... if the machine works, then you can just use it.
my note about defragging being a dangerous idea swirls around other people that had bad ram and during defragmenting (with known bad ram) they ended up with a nonbooting system.
after such problems, defragging is best just put off till you know the system is healthy.
