Personally, I prefer Nvidia graphics cards as a result of the technical issues and lousy support I have received from ATI in the past.
However, others have had a flawless experience with ATI and it will likely get better with AMD's acquisition of ATI, so don't rely solely on that for the decision.
Anyway, anything above, say, the Radeon 9600 and GeForce 5200 is OK for running Vista with Aero enabled, though obviously the more powerful the better.
Right now XP actually receives better performance ratings when running games than Vista does with the same graphics card because the drivers have not been fully optimized like those for XP have.
Nvidia is particularly behind at this point, failing to match lower-performance ATI cards in some instances.
However, that should change in the next few months as the drivers are tweaked, increasing performance in the near future.
As it stands the graphics cards will work now, but flourish later.
The three you're looking at will all do well with Vista, so just watch the user ratings and snag the best deal available.
