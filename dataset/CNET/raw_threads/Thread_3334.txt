Problem is the same networks Iam using is provided by companies that I am auditing. Simply put what can these companies see when I plug in? What would keep them from eavesdropping (software). What about installation of snooping software without my knowledge? I have to use IE 8, my audits are done on a live database and is not supported by other browsers. I use in private browsing, encrypt email.Have an external hard drive, use truecrypt. I'm running w7 in virtual box, not sure if this helps. Not sure about VPN, does this allow for open ports on home computer? I run windows firewall with no exceptions PC tools antivirus updated Super anti spyware updated Keep windows vista and the w7 updated I have goggled this without success. Thanks for your assistance!

I know this is basic, but thanks for your comments

Sounds like your a professional, If i understand you correctly, you can log any web address to your server. Is there a way for someone to circumvent you recoding this to your server, say by a proxy server? I am only trying to keep my audits confidential. These audits can affect how my client(s) views this company for future business both positive and negative. As in the previous post audits are performed by an online database accessible only thru IE8.

If they could put a client application such as NETOP on your computer, they could see everything you see on your laptop including controlling anything they want. We do this kind of thing in the classroom to monitor student's work. But there are applications that will allow you to monitor without the client. Since you are not using the company's computer, not likely that they could put a client app on your laptop. If you want a secure connection between two computers, you might check out Hamachi. Here's an article from Lifehacker http://lifehacker.com/software/vnc/geek-to-live--secure-vnc-with-hamachi-228862.php .

The network admin with my company did not recommend anything of this nature. About 2-months ago I proposed securing our data, he has not offered any suggestions, other than using the supplied cellular air cards? However these cards do not work in all areas, thus this posting. Will the connection to my home computer using the hamachi vpn be visible to the server? This would be disastrous. I am definitely in the right forum, I can tell the posters are experienced, very well.

Read up on the Hamachi security at: https://secure.logmein.com/products/hamachi/security.asp It encrypts all your messages. It would be hard for another system to intercept the messages and be able to decrypt them. LogMeIn has many different products of which Hamachi is just one of them. Check them out. You can try out their products and see how they work. If you have two computers that has internet access, install hamachi on both, set the accounts and see what it can do for you. I'm here in the west, and I used the free hamachi to control my daughters computer who is in Missouri.

Try running it through http://www.samspade.org/ or http://www.myipaddress.mobi/ when you're on the network.
