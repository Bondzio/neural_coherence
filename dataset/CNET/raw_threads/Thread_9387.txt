Only one PC correctly recognized a K-Byte 128 mb Thumb drive when connected to USB port. How can I force the other machines to see the drive? Isn't recognized as new hardware and no drivers are needed or available.

USB in BIOS enabled. 3. Motherboard and possibly USB drivers installed. None of these items are performed by Microsoft for most machines and certainly not items 1 and 2. In closing USBMAN notes many issues with some onboard chipsets that can result in mis-identifying an USB device or failure. If you can tell the make/model of the motherboard or chipset, I'd point to more specific USBMAN articles. Bob

Both &quot;USB 2 devices&quot; have issues without SP1 and I've seen issues with USB 2 ports working with USB 1 devices. One workaround was to use an USB 1.1 Hub inbetween. Without you give explicit details on chipsets, SP status of the XP Pro and more, I must leave you to research the USB site. Bob

Some BIOS allow enabling of front/rear seperately. Again, YOU get to check this. Test the device in a port you know works and not just the one that's empty. Bob
