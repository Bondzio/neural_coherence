hi guys, a bit of a tricky question.
i will be traveling to the us over the next month and given the usually lower prices compared to the uk, where i live, i would like to do some shopping.
i was thinking about the kindle fire hd, but apparently it doesn't work as well outside the us (unless of course you buy it directly in your country).
i don't really need 3g/4g as i would like to mainly use it at home with wi-fi to watch movies, listen to music, play some games, surf the net and manage emails.
does anyone know which tablet could be good for me, possibly allowing me to buy apps or other stuff with an english account and credit card?
many thanks!
cheers, fede
