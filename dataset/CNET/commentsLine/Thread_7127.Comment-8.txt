just got a response back yesterday from the vo-tech center & they agree also the motherboard was indeed bad.
i had already suspected the mobo for being bad but thought it would be a good for the students to learn more about them.
i dought they could tell me whats up with the board & what componants are bad.
capacitors i am told are the #1 componants that go out on mobo's.
i just wished i new what internal componants resistors,capacitors,relays,switches,regulators or what ever was was bad on it so i can learn to repair these boards.
thats what my goal is.
to learn more about them & go into the business repairing them.
did a search for motherboard repairs & comes up with companies that repair them.
