hp personal media drive model no.
hd7500s hp hdx18t cto laptop 4gb ddr2 ram 119 gb ssd hard drive c: 465 gb analog hard drive d: usb2 ports when using my &quot;back up&quot; drive command my laptop does not recognize my hp personal media drive.
it offers me to back up to my d: drive which is alrealy almost filled up with movies.....and a e: drive which is my dvd player .... my hp personal media drive is simply not recognized on a drive even under the windows explorer which recognizes my devices.
...should i check my ports?
they do work with my wireless platronic headphones and targus chill mat both is which use the other usb ports.
what am i doing wrong.. even my easeus todo back up program does not recognize the hp personal media drive.
