hello,I have known people that have put XP on and then reinstalled it and later reinstalled it again,only to find that it did not take the first install off so the drive was full.the only thing was to download all that he wanted on to CDs and then format the drive and get rid of all that was not wanted.then install XP and this did clear the drive.
Regards Yohan.
