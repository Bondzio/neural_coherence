How much would the SAPPHIRE HD3850 512MB help? I've been told that it wouldn't help much due to my slow RAM and old processor, but I've also been told that it would &quot;run circles around my 7600&quot;. I'm not sure what to think though. Considering my current specs, would the HD3850 REALLY be enough of an upgrade for when I buy a whole new PC?

I play games like Call of Duty 4 and Rainbow Six: Vegas that demand better parts, therefore I'd like to play them on a decent resolution and settings, not on low like I already do...

This is what my question is about: I have an old system, hence my: 2 GB PC3200 Single Channel memory PNY Verto 7600 GS AGP Pentium D dual core @ 3.4 GHz I do not have any PCI-E slots, and I'm wondering is: What kind of gain (fps) I would get playing games like Call of Duty 4, Rainbow Six: Vegas, and Left4Dead, and other newer game out by replacing my 7600 GS with an HD3850. Why am I wondering this?: I've been told that since my outdated single channel memory can't feed info to my CPU (vice versa) fast enough, I'm already severely limiting myself. However, since I'm a heavy gamer, the best AGP card out (SAPPHIRE HD3850 AGP) might help me get higher FPS. I've ran benchmarks and I'm pretty sure my GPU is the weakest link, however, 2 GB of single channel and a Pentium D @ 3.4 GHz isn't too hot either. So bascially: CONSIDERING MY CURRENT SPECS, how much of a gain in FPS would I get with a SAPPHIRE HD3850 AGP

I have seen 120FPS and played the same at 60 so for me this is not something I would be doing. HOWEVER the 3850 is ON THE LIST at http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card,2064-6.html Let's stop with this -&gt; &quot;this is the most powerful AGP card you can get&quot;! Bob

While we can answer that it's a fine choice, it's on the list and more, NO ONE CAN TELL YOU THE FOLLOWING -&gt; &quot;How many frames per second ...&quot; That can only be answered by installing it on the host computer and running a benchmark. Some may find this a bad answer but it's the truth. Bob
