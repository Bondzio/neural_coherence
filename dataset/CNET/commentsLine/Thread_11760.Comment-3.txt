thanks for the info.
but i can add to a partially completed cd on my other computer if there is sufficient space.
it asks me if i wish to erase on an rw and when i reply &quot;no&quot; it allows adding data or music.
the computer that won't allow adding to a partially filled disk has lots of dvd/cd burning software on it so there may be a conflict somewhere.
