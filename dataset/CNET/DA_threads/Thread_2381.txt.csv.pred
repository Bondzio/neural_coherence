1.1.2	I have a SMC2804WBR 2.4GHz 54Mbps Wireless Cable/DSL Broadband Router that apparently is not powerful enough to broadcast the wireless signals through the walls in my house and would appreciate any advice / recommendatiosn / suggestions / ... . , that will allow me to wirelessily connect 2 WindowsXp PCs that are about 150 feet from each other but with several rooms and maybe 10 walls , between computer & quot ; A & quot ; and computer & quot ; B & quot ; ?

1.2.1	Even moreso with walls .	St
1.2.2	Try using some AC Powerline pairs such as http : //www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite ? c=L_Product_C2 & childpagename=US % 2FLayout & cid=1166859566539 & pagename=Linksys % 2FCommon % 2FVisitorWrapper Now put a wifi router at the other end and viola .	St

1.3.1	You might also look into getting a wireless range extender that you would place somewhere in between the place where you have your router and your PCs .	St
1.3.2	All that would be required is a power outlet once the initial configuration is setup in the range extender .	St
