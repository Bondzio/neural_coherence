i keep getting a timeout page every time i try to access a domain i recently purchased (  i assume that since the first time i tried to access the domain it was unresolved the router cache the domain as being unassigned and so this is a simple issue of clearing the dns cache, but i cannot figure out how to clear it.
i have tried resetting to factory defaults, updating firmware, and telnetting into the router (which apparently is not an option with this router), i even tried using a hacked di-624 firmware because it supposedly gives you more options in the control panel than the 524, but i still can't find anything useful.
removing the the router and connecting directly to the modem yields no problems at all so i am positive the error lies with the router.
below is my set-up.
any help would be appreciated.
