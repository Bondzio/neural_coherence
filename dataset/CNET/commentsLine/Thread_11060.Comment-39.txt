when i was upgrading to windows 7, i had to retire: 1. my adsl router: it was connected to usb port and had no driver for windows 7; neither 32-bit nor 64-bit.
2. my sound system: it was a soundmax integrated sound chip on my asus p5ld2 se motherboard.
there is only beta driver available for it that works with windows vista and windows 7 but is very quirky.
windows update immediately updates to microsoft high-definition somethin' and takes away a lot of its features including recording.
3. my old ide hard disk.
this hard disk was too slow for windows 7. my hp scanjet 3128 also lost its enhanced driver which was not compatible with windows 7 and is now using a basic wia driver.
i also had to retire my diskeeper and kaspersky internet security because they were incompatible with windows 7.
