Hi, I know it's a question being asked over and over, but I'm stumped as to what to get. I need a new desktop. I use some graphics packages and applications like dreamweaver. But nothing too hungry. I mainly use web apps to run my business and 'surf'. I use spreadsheets etc. I like to work fast (like everyone) so I'd like a PC with some uuummffff, even if it's just half a dozen browser windows open etc. I'm not sure whether to stick with XP pro or move onto Vista. My laptop is Vista and I have had no problems so far. I don't think any apps I'll be using rely on XP, as I use mainly web based apps. So that isn't an issue. I'm also torn between getting another Dell or trying HP. I've always used Dell... I'd really appreciate any input into the spec I should look for (or avoid), with regards to processor (Dual core?) and memory (I was looking at 4GB my current machine is 2GB and I'd like to move up!). I use dal monitors and need a hardrive setup I can rely on (I'd like to have two drives mirrored). Any and all advise appreciated.

My current two have the P4 3 GHz HT processors and a Gig of ram, with the Gigabit LAN. http://www-132.ibm.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?categoryId=2576395&storeId=1&catalogId=-840&langId=-1 Don't waste your money on four Gig of RAM. More than two is overkill and will not be used by 99.99% of all applications including XP. Two Gig is all that is needed. Trust me here. Unless you want bragging rights.
