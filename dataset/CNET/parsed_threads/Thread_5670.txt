<s> Hi, I have a strange issue... Last month or so I noticed that the battery level (when the adapter was plugged in too) indicated 99% and didn't go over that level... </s>
<s> However, if I disconnected the adapter and let the battery level fall under 95%, when I plugged it in again it did go to 100% again. </s>
<s> After hibernating though it fell to 99% again... </s>
<s> I thought I might try to calibrate, and now it shows 98% and won't go over that level (with the adapter plugged in)... Is there an explanation? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> PS: I have a Gigabyte netbook. </s>
<s> You see that as the batteries get old. </s>
<s> Old is over 18 months. </s>
<s> This confounds most owners but not most shops. </s>

<s> Thank you for the reply. </s>
<s> It is just 12 months old this month and I have not used it much on its own. </s>
<s> Is is better to keep it out when I am using the power adapter? </s>
<s> At the office we've had batteries in for 5 years and found they sometimes get about 50 percent of new batteries. </s>
<s> You'll see some odd advice about pulling batteries but this one looks to be a fretful user. </s>
<s> Nod a lot and let them do what they want. </s>
