<s> I'm trying to find a webcam with the following features: - 1080p at 30fps, minimum. </s>
<s> - internet interface. </s>
<s> Wired or wireless, I don't care. </s>
<s> I just want to be able to access and control the camera from anywhere. </s>
<s> - Zoom via web interface. </s>
<s> - Start/stop recording via web interface. </s>
<s> - SD or microSD storage - Good picture, at least as good as a midrange webcam Not required, but pan/zoom/tilt would be great. </s>
<s> There are plenty that match 75% of what I want, but either the video is only 720p or you can't control the camera via the web or the picture stinks, etc. </s>
<s> I won't say price is no object, but I'd spend up to $200 for the right camera, which is pretty good for a webcam these days. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> HDMI out and then google BLACK MAGIC HDMI CAPTURE for capture. </s>
<s> Yeah, I thought that might be the case. </s>
<s> It's weird that the market still lists 640x480 as a great video resolution on $250 cameras, when my cellphone can do 1080p and 8 megapixel stills. </s>
<s> It would almost make sense to buy some cheap phones and never activate them. </s>
<s> Just keep them wireless only and remote in to them. </s>
<s> Well at any decent frame rate at 1080p is 10x or more the usual WiFi speed. </s>
<s> Even USB 2.0 is getting soaked at 480 megabits per second at 480p or 720p. </s>
<s> If we could drop the frame rate, sure we can get 1080 across but then what? </s>
<s> The last time I had this dicussion they wanted to do a live 1080p feed to webcast and they didn't have all the hardware and no internet connection fast enough. </s>
<s> 480p is great for webcam talks. </s>

<s> I just want to control the camera. </s>
<s> The camera can have an sd card or microsd card in it to capture the data. </s>
<s> The only thing that needs to get transmitted via wireless is the start and stop recording commands, pan right/left, etc. </s>
<s> And you're talking to the right person as I have traveled to the makers to help correct the code in security DVRs. </s>
<s> That's not a webcam at all but a surveillance device. </s>
<s> There are some cheap units that do such but fail as a web cam (because it's not a web cam.) </s>
<s> They also fail your remote requirements. </s>
<s> -&gt; There are some HD CCTV units that come close and possibly are out there that I don't know about but the prototypes I encountered were still North of a few thousand. </s>
