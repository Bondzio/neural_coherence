Michael- Thanks for your response and link- as I read it ''a motherboard that supports 1.5V (AGP 4x) video cards should work ok with a .8V video card (AGP 8x), however in the later example the video card would only work at the fastest speed the motherboard supports (AGP 4x).''
-- my interpretation is that I can purchase an 8x card if it fits in the slot but it will only run at 4x.
As I look in the slot in my computer, I don't see a divider to preclude the insertion.There is only one divider 2/3 of the way down.
However, I am confused by what I think is a conflicting statement earlier in the link-'' If a motherboard requires a 1.5V AGP card and you place a AGP card in it that is not 1.5V, you will physically damage the motherboard and probably the video card as well.''
Is this a conflict with the earlier quote?
Any comments regarding this would be appreciated.Also any recommendations for cards.
Thanks, Mike
