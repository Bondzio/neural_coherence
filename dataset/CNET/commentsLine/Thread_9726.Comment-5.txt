usually, you can feel a drive spin up.
put your finger on the top (smooth) side of the drive and cold boot your pc -- you should feel a difference.
if this came from an old pc, put it back in that pc and see if it still works.
if so, network the two and copy the data.
i'm sorry, but i can't think of anything else that might help figuring out why it won't work in your new one.
