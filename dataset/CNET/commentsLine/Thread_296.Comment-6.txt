frank: glad to hear you solved the problem.
it seems that all to often on a new install, that windows will install some outdated version of the driver.
when you check in device manager it says that the device is working properly, when in reality it may not.
i've been in that circle before, myself.
not a lot of fun, but a good learning experience.
