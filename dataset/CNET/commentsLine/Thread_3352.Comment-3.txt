ok i think i follow, however i don't know much about these things.
i have the motherboard already (an intel 915gux).
see pic (warning it's quite large):  the main power socket has 24 pins (left of pic).
there is also a square 4 pin socket and a rectangle 4 pin socket (right of pic).
is there any special requirements i should look out for in the psu?
