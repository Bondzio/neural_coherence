i do not use ones with fans or external ac adapters.
all hard drives run off dc so i prefer to let the usb power them.
i have always like and used seagate and western digital hard drives and found both to very reliable.
seagate is my drive of choice at this time.
i do not leave them powered up, i just plug them up and make my backups and then remove them from the system and treat them as if they are a new born baby.
it is my humble opinion that most external hard drive failures occur by how they are handled.
i even go so far as to wrap them up before i store them.
i should tell you that i also use thumb drives and dvd for backups to.
it depends on just how important the data is.
i break it down into three levels.
critical, important, oh well it will not kill me if i lose it.
images of my c drive are kept on dvd's, thumb drive and external drives.
critical data is kept on thumb drives and external drives.
everything else is on external drives.
it all depends on how you view what your backing up.
the point to it all is that i have multiple backups of everything and stored in different locations so i am pretty much covered no matter what happens.
