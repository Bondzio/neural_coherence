<s> If I backup my Toshiba Satellite L305-S5885 laptop 250gb hard drive to an external 250gb hard drive and then restore my laptop hard drive back to Day 1 (Brand New Status), can I selectively put files back on the restored hard drive? </s>
<s> So I can get rid of unnecessary files. </s>
<s> The reason for the restore is an error message that I get EVERY time I reboot my laptop that requires me to put the Windows disk in the CD Drive which came with the laptop which I bought brand new. </s>
<s> I'm hoping to eliminate this error message and &quot;spring clean&quot; my computer's hard drive. </s>
<s> &quot;, can I selectively put files back on the restored hard drive? </s>
<s> &quot; Please don't take this wrong but it's too likely that the clone would fail in new and wonderful ways. </s>
<s> It is time to backup what files you can't lose then restore the machine with the restore dvds you made when the machine was new. </s>

<s> The external hard drive is an &quot;all or nothing backup&quot; procedure. </s>
<s> So I need to delete the files I don't want before the &quot;all or nothing&quot; backup, then backup the laptop hard drive, then do my &quot;restore to original state procedure&quot;, then sync the external hard drive with the laptop and put all my &quot;keeper&quot; files back on the laptop hard drive? </s>
<s> Is that correct? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Why is that external an all or nothing procedure? </s>
<s> The failure you note is not uncommon but any full copy would have the same problem when you restore from it. </s>
<s> So that plan is flawed. </s>
<s> What works well is to copy our files out to 2 or more places then use the restore media. </s>
<s> I then reinstall my basic applications and copy my files back in. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Sounds right, that's what I will do. </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
