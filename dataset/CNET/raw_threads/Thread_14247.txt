After a while a timer came up and would restart my computer. I thought it was an administrative command, so I looked for steps to stop this from happening. Eventually I realized this was actually a sympton of the gaobot/agobot virus family! I had to download various anti-virus programs to remove it. Variants of this virus kept infecting my computer despite my attemtps to clean my laptop. I had lots of spyware and malware in addition to the nasty viruses. I contacted the seller and he said there were no viruses on it when he shipped it. (Did I really expect him to say yes?) I can not burn cds or play dvds, but the listing stated there was a cd burner and CD-RW drive. A LIE. A few days ago I left my computer on and napped for a few hours. When I woke up my laptop restarted itself and was stuck on the opening screen. I turned it on then back on again to see what was going on. I tried to start firefox and a message about an .xml document popped up. I wasn't wearing my glasses so I couldn't see it. Firefox closed immediately; I knew something was VERY wrong. I opened ad-aware to check out the problem. Lo and behold my virus definitions had been corrupted or missing. Uh oh. My computer turned on! I rebooted it into safe mode and ran ad-aware then. I opened spybot and a message popped up indicating the program had been changed, which doesn't occur unless there is a trojan or spyware. My computer turns off AGAIN. I rebooted it a few times for only to see a black screen reading your memory has been or changed. Other times the black screen was BLANK. Now I can't even power on the thing. I call Dell and try different methods to fix the problem. I am told this laptop was ordered 6 years ago and is a 98 system. The ebay listing stated it was windows XP but did not mention an upgrade. The seller said he could try to fix it but depending on the problem it might cost. What do I do?!? A)Toss the laptop and get a new one elsewhere or B)Let the seller fix it C)Something else. I will not purchase electronics from ebay again. That was a dumb decision which cost me in the long run. I should have spent the extra few hundred dollars for a new laptop. You get what you pay for.

Have you thought about finding the drivers for the laptop then buying a fresh copy of W98SE? I mention 98 because a machine that old may not have the guts to run XP. If you like the machine and want to keep it, I think I'd try to do a format and reinstall the OS and system drivers.

941	4	161525	1794012	1793923	Coryphaeus	3/7/06 5:54 PM	1.14175404E12	There are some minimums for XP. . .	If you can get the specs on the laptop, here is what microsoft says: Here's What You Need to Use Windows XP Home Edition PC with 300 megahertz (MHz) or higher processor clock speed recommended; 233-MHz minimum required;* Intel Pentium/Celeron family, AMD K6/Athlon/Duron family, or compatible processor recommended 128 megabytes (MB) of RAM or higher recommended (64 MB minimum supported; may limit performance and some features) 1.5 gigabyte (GB) of available hard disk space. Super VGA (800 600) or higher resolution video adapter and monitor CD-ROM or DVD drive Keyboard and Microsoft Mouse or compatible pointing device. More here http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/home/upgrading/sysreqs.mspx I consider the above the absolute bare minimum. I wouldn't even try it on a machine like the above. It's probably worth fixing, but now with XP as the OS.
