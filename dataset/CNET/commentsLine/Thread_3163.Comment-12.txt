...i have installed the virtual pc, and created a virtual pc.
how do i add a new os to it?
all the tutorials on the net say things like: &quot;step4&quot; just install the new os... however they don't tell me how to do it.
i have setup the new virtual pc, chose xp as the os type, changed the ram settings, added a virtual hdd and now it's in my virtual pc console as &quot;not running&quot;.
how do i got about installing the os on this?
