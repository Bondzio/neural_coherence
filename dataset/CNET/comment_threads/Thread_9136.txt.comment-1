My 3-year old motherboard (Soyo K7VTAPro with an AMD Athlon Thunderbird 1.33ghz processor) recently died.
I have purchased an ASUS MB P5P800 865PE and a P4/2.8 GHz LGA775 processor to replace the old system.
I would like to re-use my old HD (running XP Home)which is fairly new.
What is the best way to get the HD to work in the new system?
Should I reformat and start all over again?
Thanks for your help!
