<s> I have a IBM thinkpad i-series. </s>
<s> It has 6GB hdd which is not reliable as it makes noise and has more than 2000 bad sectors. </s>
<s> I have a sound knowledge of PC hardware and I think I can change the HDD but i dont know how to open the laptop case. </s>
<s> Need step by step help regarding my this problem, Please. </s>
<s> Thnaks ! </s>
<s> Out of all the vendors/makers out there, IBM is the most helpful. </s>
<s> They have a support website and provide the details you need. </s>
<s> They really do, check there. </s>
<s> Since laptops vary, I &quot;assume&quot; this maybe one where you lift the kybd. </s>
<s> up by unlatching a 2nd set of locks where you lift the lcd up(when latched), check there. </s>
<s> That's a guess... Next time, give *FULL* details of what your model is. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Willy's idea of going to the website is good. </s>
<s> Where the HD is hidden varies from model to model and make to make. </s>
<s> On my Toshiba flip it over a couple of small screws and it's done. </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> has its screws on the bottom also. </s>
<s> The tricky part is disconnecting the keyboard from the motherboard. </s>
<s> Make sure you have small fingers. </s>
<s> After that, replacing the HD is fairly simple. </s>
