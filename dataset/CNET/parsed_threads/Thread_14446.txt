<s> does a retail amd athlon 64 3000+ come with thermal paste or a thermal pad or should i buy some? </s>
<s> i beleave yes it comes with either </s>
<s> unless AMD has downgraded their processors (whyyyyy would they do that? </s>
<s> ha) then yeah it does, thats why the box is so big, it comes with a fan :P and I've heard of cases where it comes with either a thermal pad, or heat sink glue, so you'll get one or the other :P </s>
