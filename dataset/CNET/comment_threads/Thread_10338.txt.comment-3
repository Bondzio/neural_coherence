There's a few ways to set-up multi-boot systems.
All of them will require some sort of way to select which operating system to boot.
With a single HD, you'll need to partition it into at least a seperate Server 2003 and a Windows XP partitions.
I've used Acronis multiboot manager, is ok.
It comes with the disk director suite, which will handle partitioning, too.
I haven't done Server 2003, but in principle there's no reason it can't be the same re multibooting as any other OS.
