how do i format a sd memory card ( erase all data) that keeps giving me a &quot;write protected&quot; message.
this was a blank card to start with onto which i installed maps while in a garmin gps ( not me, the card.).
i would like to change the configuration.
i've erased memory sticks before with no problems.
in other words i need to defeat the write protection.
