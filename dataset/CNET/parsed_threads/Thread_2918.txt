<s> I have a PC running Win XP Pro and a laptop (acer aspire) running Win XP Home. </s>
<s> Both have wireless adapters installed and working. </s>
<s> When I connect them via crossover cable it all works wonderfully. </s>
<s> File sharing and internet works great. </s>
<s> Outlook, messenger and everything works fine. </s>
<s> The PC connects to the internet through ethernet adapter which connects to a cable modem. </s>
<s> The internet works fine on my PC. </s>
<s> HOWEVER, when i set up a peer to peer 'ad hoc' wireless network, the file sharing works fine however the internet does very strange things. </s>
<s> Certain websites work fine (such as google, bbc.co.uk and certain others), however others just don't load at all. </s>
<s> Messenger doesnt work, outlook doesnt download e-mails and no videos or programs will download. </s>
<s> I have tried this with my friends laptop too (same make) and the same thing happens!! </s>
<s> I have tried pinging several websites.....google, bbc work fine, but ebay, msn, natwest all time out. </s>
<s> I have tried changing the MAC address and playing around with the ip addresses, but not being an expert i dont really know what i am doing!! </s>
<s> If you have heard of this problem and know how to sort it, please let me know, cos this is driving me insane!! </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> linksys, netgear, smc, d-link.... etc make affordable wireless router. </s>
<s> you can easily pick one up for under $100. </s>
