1.1.1	Ok long story short my employer downsized and moved their office into their basement to save costs .	St
1.1.2	I moved their network from the office to basement .	St
1.1.3	I made not IP changes or config changes to server .	St
1.1.4	Only difference is the DSL line that the network will share has a dynamic IP going into the netopia modem/router and not a static IP as before .	St
1.1.5	Will this work .	St
1.1.6	Also a Linksys wireless router is connected to the netopia to provide wireless access in the house .	St
1.1.7	So netopia router - linksys router - wireless PCs and the existing network Netgear smart switch - 2 servers ( both windows 2003 server , DHCP server on and clients/workstations assigned an IP reservation through it ) - 3 workstations - 2 printers My question is how do I share the internet connection with this exsisting network setup ?	Ques
1.1.8	The servers are on a 192.168.200. ?	Ques
1.1.9	The netopia is giving me a 192.168.2. ?	Ques
1.1.10	and has DHCP server on and the linkys a 192.168.1. ?	Ques
1.1.11	I got so frustrated that I bought a wireless NIC for the workstations ( which already had wired NICS setup to access the existing network-and working just fine ) and tried to connect the wireless NIC to the wireless network .	St
1.1.12	That worked temp but how can I plug in manual IP etc on a dynamic DSL network ?	Ques
1.1.13	Help I 'm so confused and really want to learn what I am doing wrong .	St
1.1.14	I 'm looking for the most cost-effective and easiest route for this today .	St
1.1.15	Thank you so much .	St
1.2.1	I should add that the netopia has DHCP server turned on - should this be acting as & quot ; relay agent & quot ; ?	Ques
1.2.2	Are there some settings in the netopia or the linksys that I should change ?	Ques
1.3.1	Why not try it our way ?	Ques
