1.1.1	I got a fresh copy of Windows XP pro a few days ago , and just got around to installing it today .	St
1.1.2	All was going well until I needed to make it recognize my SATA hdd .	St
1.1.3	I hit F6 , waited on it to finish up , and it went to the specify drive screen , I pressed s , and stuck the floppy disk in ( that I had used before , and it worked ) and it had the 'Please wait ... ' down in the corner , and then it came back up to the 'Insert blah blah blah disk into drive A : ' .	St
1.1.4	Well , I was thinking maybe I had hit enter before I had pushed the disk in on accident , so I pressed enter again ... . and one again it went back to the screen that it was at before .	St
1.1.5	I was just wondering if maybe the floppy drive is to blame for this , or what ?	Ques
1.1.6	When I start the PC , the light on the drive comes on BTW .	St
1.1.7	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	but I only have a fuzzy idea what you are seeing on the screen or doing .	St
1.2.2	Why not tell us what configuration the system was in before you decided to do something with the new CD ? ?	Ques
1.2.3	Was something already on the SATA drive and working ? ?	Ques
1.2.4	Maybe the SATA drivers were already recognized .	St
1.3.1	notice you are taken back to add more files if you wish .	St
1.3.2	Just continue past this and the install should procede .	St
1.4.1	The drive is completely formated , and partitioned .	St
1.4.2	I tried to install Windows without going through the process of pressing F6 to 'Insatll aditional RAID drivers ' ( or something close to that ) .	St
