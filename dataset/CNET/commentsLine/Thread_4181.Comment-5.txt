it is supported.
xp 2800+ 333 is supported and even 3000+ 333 is.
and if i set the board to 5:1 i can use 133 ran and 333 cpu.
or i can set both cpu and ram to 133. i just don't want to buy new ram since i already have 1gb.
so i guess i'll just try it and see how it goes.
now i just need a new fan capable of supporting a 2800+ socket a. ivnj
