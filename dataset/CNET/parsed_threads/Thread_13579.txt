<s> I really enjoy bass but i don't necessarily need my teeth chattering. </s>
<s> I want to hear and feel the thump from the bass but not so heavy that it drowns out the mids and highs. </s>
<s> Ive done some research but i get mixed reviews on whether or not the Gigaworks can provide a clean heavy bass (not exactly sub-woofer quality but still great). </s>
<s> Also Klipsch is a known high quality brand and i'm hoping to use these speakers for a long time. </s>
<s> If anyone here has owned or heard both i would love your input, if you haven't then any advice can help. </s>
<s> I've also selected the Bose companion 2 series 2 as a possibility. </s>
<s> Promedia 2.1 and it's served me well for quite some time. </s>
<s> I don't game but I do enjoy music at reasonable quality. </s>
<s> It's really a matter of adjusting the bass to the right level as any sub-woofer can get muddy sounding. </s>
<s> My main home speaker system is still a pair of old JBL L65s ( a studio monitor series) that spoils me but the Klipsch are nice on my PC. </s>
<s> I don't need or want more than 2.1. </s>
<s> Good luck in your search but it's your ears that should do the judging. </s>
