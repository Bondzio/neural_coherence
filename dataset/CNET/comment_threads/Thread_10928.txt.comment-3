That's why i am asking here.
The key to this question is the SIZE of the paper (A1/4bar/3 1/2&quot;x4 7/8&quot;) AND the thickness of 80# or 216GSM.
I have been on the phone/online chat with HP, Xerox and Dell and seems most of the people answering the phones cannot understand what 3.5&quot; wide means, let alone 4 7/8&quot; in height.
Does ANYONE know of a laser printer that can print on an A1 flat card (3 1/2&quot; x 4 7/8&quot;) size piece of coverstock (80 lbs or 216 gsm).
Thanks!
