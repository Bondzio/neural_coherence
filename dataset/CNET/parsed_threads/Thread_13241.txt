<s> I am having some strange problems connecting to the internet on windows xp. </s>
<s> A while ago i could connect to the internet through a few things. </s>
<s> I used both the Opera and Firefox web browsers and occasionally internet explorer. </s>
<s> I also have yahoo widgets that I use a weather forcast widget that gets its info from weather.com. </s>
<s> It has been a while since my problems began, so i dont remember when, but all of a sudden firefox claimed that there was no internet connection, yet all my other options were still functional. </s>
<s> For a while i only used opera. </s>
<s> Then a few weeks ago I tried internet explorer and found that it too had gone the way of firefox. </s>
<s> Well then i wanted to see if it was Opera that was doing it, so i uninstalled opera and tried both, but they didnt work. </s>
<s> Then I reinstalled opera and found that now IT didn't work. </s>
<s> The reason i wanted this fixed is because my creative zen mp3 player isnt working and i got a recovery tool to try, which needs the internet, but was also not finding it. </s>
<s> At this point the only thing that seems to be able to access still is the widget for some reason...I am really stumped. </s>
<s> I am using a wireless card, and tried swithing to LAN, but that didnt work either. </s>
<s> I tried spyware scaning with DR.web, but after i deleted the files it found, i still don't have a connection. </s>
<s> Any help is appreciated. </s>
<s> using any type of peer to peer programs, like Limeware, Kazza, etc.? </s>
<s> If so, this can be your problem. </s>
