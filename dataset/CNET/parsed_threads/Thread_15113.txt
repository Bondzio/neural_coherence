<s> I have had this pent iv two years. </s>
<s> The generic cd-rw will read but will not burn a cd after working before. </s>
<s> I have uninstalled and installed. </s>
<s> I have tried using nero and microsoft burners. </s>
<s> Nero creates a virtual image while media player just says it cant burn file. </s>
<s> I disconnected and reconnected cables. </s>
<s> Any suggestions or has the burner gone bad after two years? </s>
<s> Have you used the burner much??? </s>
<s> I've had one for over 2 years and it still works knock on wood but I only use it on occasion. </s>
<s> I used it to make a few music cd and to back up my system monthly. </s>
<s> A replacement isn't expensive but I want to make sure it is a hardware problem before I replace it. </s>
<s> I boot a KNOPPIX CD on the other drive, then use K3b to test the CDRW. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Please explain what a KNOPPIX CD is and what K3b is. </s>
<s> When using Nero to try to do a copy disk nero still doesn't see the burner and creates an image on my hard drive. </s>
<s> -&gt; http://www.google.com finds KNOPPIX and pages about KNOPPIX in no time at all. </s>
<s> Plus said pages will tell you about KNOPPIX in many ways. </s>
<s> I can't guess which method works for you and as such will not write much about KNOPPIX except to share it's how I test a CDRW before I replace the drive. </s>
<s> K3b is the CD recording software included in the KNOPPIX CD and ... very easy to use. </s>
<s> Again, with all the documention on K3b plus it's help pages, I see no need to repeat that content except to share it's the tool I use. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, If you didn't write that your NERO is something bundled with another drive then you are trying to use if with a newer CDRW, then that's your loss. </s>
<s> That results in the scenario you have presented. </s>
<s> Just so you can burn CDR/W media the nice software from http://www.cdburnerxp.se/ is free and may help you get by until you fix your issue. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> would be SystemRescueCD http://distrowatch.serve-you.net/?distribution=systemrescue You can place it on a shirt pocket size mini cd-r (only 110 meg) and perform just about anything Knoppix or MEPIS does except Office production work using OpenOffice which is absent. </s>
<s> very handy. </s>
