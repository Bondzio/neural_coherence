If you have an &quot;under-powered PSU&quot; it will eventually die. It may also become stressed just by wear&tear as heat is a culprit all too often in these cases. Just consider you got your money's worth. Replace the PSU or any other part as necessary. If you feel the PSU is putting out too much heat, then replace it will fry itself and *maybe* take something else with it, if not already. You have an iffy situation where all items together cause a problem, thus test elsewhere alone. Let's not forget that a possible &quot;bad caps&quot; can be had if poor power was at fault or the famous bad caps manufacture. Check: http://www.badcaps.net for clues/tips. tada -----Willy

You want to find out what is causing the supply to shutdown or run hot. If you want to see if the supply runs hot when not connected to anything. Simply jumper the green wire on the connector that goes to the mobo to any of the black wires, and the supply should turn on [as noted by the fan turning][also tells whether the power switch is defective]and stay on as long as the jumper is present. The supply will have no external load, and thus if it blows out hot air the supply itself is bad.
