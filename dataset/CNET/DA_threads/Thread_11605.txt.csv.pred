1.1.2	Apparently dvd drives can only have their regions changed 4 times then they are stuck like that ?	Ques
1.1.3	I never knew that .	St
1.1.4	Anyone know the reason why ?	Ques
1.2.1	They are regionalized mainly for pricing , costs being much lower in the lower economy areas.. To reduce piracy due to copying or simply price differences the movie industry started this and somehow got the law to limit the number of times that a drive can change regions .	St
1.2.2	The four times were some idea that if one was a traveler they would have a legitimate reason to be using DVD 's from a different region .	St
1.2.3	I have read that there are ways to get around this , but not sure how .	St
1.3.1	http : //www.gocyberlink.com/english/products/powerdvd/tips_tricks/Region/rce.jsp	St
