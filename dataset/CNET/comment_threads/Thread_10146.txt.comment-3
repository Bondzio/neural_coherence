Yup, took your advice and asked my school to which they replied by sending me this link, http://www.cae.wisc.edu/site/public/?title=onetoone and by telling me that the engineering department runs Windows and Unix machines.
Sorry but I'm a (soon to be) first time Mac user, shouldn't a Mac be able to work since its based on Unix?
Anyways, as mrmacfixit asked, I think it's going to be the 2Ghz MacBook and I'll throw in my own 2GB of ram.
