2314	0	225279	2357082	NR	lisa_blakey	12/26/06 3:08 PM	1.16714568E12	I am buying a new computer. . .	and I want to take the files (i.e. music, pictures, word, games, etc) from the old computer and put them on new one. Is that possible? If so, how do I go about doing it without bringing viruses for the old computer to the new one? I basically want all of my old information on the newer, faster machine. Both computers are Gateways, both desktops, both run on XP. I don't know what else you would need to know to solve this problem, so just ask I am basically upgrading as I have had the old one for over 4 years. Oh and step by step directions (like you are telling your grandmother) would be great.
