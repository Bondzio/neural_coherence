It currently has athelon x2 5000+.
But it supports 8GB of memory so i somewhat have a hard time believing athelon is it.

I Emailed help with the question But the response seemed to be from a scripted & & typed by someone with little grasp of the English language completely ignoring my request for above question.
possibly pay support if i can't get a definitive answer.
