<s> I think I have all ready messed up this new thread countless times. </s>
<s> My wife says to keep trying. </s>
<s> I have to start by saying that I am a combat veteran with some comprehensive and memory problems. </s>
<s> I understand a little about computers but probably not too much if any. </s>
<s> I use my computer primarily for FPS gaming. </s>
<s> I guess that I like to shoot things or people without anyone really getting hurt. </s>
<s> I did have a Dell Dimension C521 with a 80 GB hard drive and a what I consider to be Dell's standard TSST DVD drive. </s>
<s> Obviously it lacked tremoundsly. </s>
<s> I was lucky and married a wonderful woman and recently talked her into buying 'us' a Dell XPS 625. </s>
<s> No criticism for buying two Dells in a row please. </s>
<s> From what I read on the net and the sizing of the case, power supply potential as well as for expansion capability (and also a payment plan) made me a buyer. </s>
<s> I want to take the 80GB hard drive out of the old computer and put it into my new one. </s>
<s> There are expansion slots for extra hard drives in the XPS complete with cabling and after suffering with such a previous small capacity hard drive I feel that every GB matters. </s>
<s> I need to know how to do this. </s>
<s> Stats for my current computer are as follows: XPS_XPS 625 AMD Phenom 9850 Quad-Core Processor 2.46 GHz RAM: 4.00 GB System Type: 64-Bit OS Vista Home Premium ATI Radeon HD 4670 Hard Drive: 500 GB (2) DVD Drives I took the DVD drive out of my old computer and stuck it into the new one two have to DVD drives in it. </s>
<s> With the Hard Drive how do I reformat it to completely blank it out? </s>
<s> I don't want anything from the old drive. </s>
<s> Just extra storage compacity, maybe all music, maybe just for (anything). </s>
<s> Do I need to install my current OS to my old drive to make it work? </s>
<s> I'm using Vista Home Premium now but the old OS was Home Basic. </s>
<s> Do I need any OS at all if all I want is data storage? </s>
<s> I don't know. </s>
<s> I have a million questions but if one knowledgable person gets the drift of what I am asking for then please give advice. </s>
<s> IMHO, you really don't need two DVD drives installed. </s>
<s> Unless you plan to do alot of copying and even then it maybe too slow. </s>
<s> Its actually better to use a HD and DVD in such cases. </s>
<s> Also, the power burden of a DVD drive that does nothing until needed is just that a burden. </s>
<s> Save it as a spare. </s>
<s> As for the HD itself, mount the old HD and use either master/slave setup or CS. </s>
<s> If SATA type then mount in next available port. </s>
<s> After bootup, goto &quot;disk management&quot; and format the old HD. </s>
<s> Be 100% sure you are addressing the old HD and proceed. </s>
<s> Here's the MS link on the topic: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/309000 Once done the prepared HD is now ready for data. </s>
<s> All previous data is gone and effectively you have a blank HD, recognized by the system as letter, &quot;?&quot;. </s>
<s> gain, while 80gb may seem alot, it too places power burden. </s>
<s> I mention this as most OEM type systems tend to be power deficient until proven so. </s>
<s> A new 500gb HD on sale are available at $99 or less if you want alot extra storage. </s>

<s> XP install is pretty much the same as Vista procedure. </s>
<s> It maybe described differently, though the same steps. </s>
<s> Here's Vista procedure: http://www.windowsreference.com/windows-vista/how-to-use-disk-management-in-vista/ You can always google for various system tasks or procedures as they frequently available for Vista based queries besides these forums. </s>
