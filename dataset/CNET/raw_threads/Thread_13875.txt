Also download ccleaner (free) and use that to clean your c-drive. Or did you do that already (you didn't tell). Together, this might make a difference, already. Then there might be other folders on the c-drive you created yourself, that could just as well be on the d-drive. That's different for everybody, so I can't tell. You can. If the e:-drive is still empty, and you don't use it for backup (let's assume that you have another medium to backup to, which is better), you can: a. Leave it empty as long as the c and the d are big enough. b. Move data to it (like you move data from c to d) c. Find a partition utility to combine d: and e: into one big d: partition. Totally your choice. Kees

If you have installed pgms. to it more than likely any data will also reside there. Thus, it all adds up over the long run. At the same time if you save or back-up to it as well to include any restore points. You can if there are no other problems, simply turn off the restore feature for the time being, save that setting and reboot. Again, provided there are no problems other than what you mentioned, the restore points and thus all its space used can now be deleted. Once done, you can then trun back the restore feature and restart the saving points again. Hopefully, that will use less space. Using any proper cleaner, like CCleaner or similar run it it and also do the std. cleaning and return the used space back. That's one item, you can also once you saved any data to a peculiar pgm. do a deletion as well. Re-install on the D drive. Make sure it stores it data there as well. Hopefully that returns some space to the C drive. The saved data can be returned and be used as before. The real solution provided the C drive was small to begin with, replace it with a larger one, rather used or new. Since you have 3 partitions, it suggest you really have one physical hard drive. Alas, since the back-up partition is empty you never actually used it for that purpose -OR- have backed-up to yet another partition, most likely C drive. You system info is sparse, so do tell exactly what do you have installed. can't you open the case and check it? You can use the pgm. PC Wizard and run it to display the details of your system as well, once space is available to install. tada -----Willy

Your PC hard drive was partitioned to left a specific portion free for your OS, the c: partition. Nothing else should be installed there. What this means is that every time you install a new program, you will have to tell the setup software to choose the d: Data Partition path to install to. Almost all setup programs will automatically choose c: by default, so you MUST change the path to d: before you install new programs. Having a full hard drive partition is very bad because nothing new, such as updates to the OS, can be installed. Too, there is absolutely no room for a defragmenting program to work. A partition needs at least 10% free space to work properly, and for Windows virtual memory to use. You should allow more space if you know you will need to install more data in that partition, such as updates. Your e: Back-UP Partition is just that - space set aside to backup your d: Data Partition. A good backup software program should be used from time to time to do this, unless you have nothing important on your data partition. Win7 may come with one built in and might be found somewhere on your c: Boot (OS) Partition. If you use the current Norton Security Suite, there is such a program built in to it for customer use. (Comcast ISP customers are able to install this great software for free and use on up to 7 PCs. It also has tools for cleaning the registry and deleting temp files not needed any longer, as well anti-virus, anti-malware, and anti-spyware functions.)

Your pagefile.sys (hidden) should be moved onto all three partitions. Boot Partition: 512 MB, Data: 1024 MB, and the backup partition should let Windows decide. Don't use Windows backup. I use Cobian (freeware), but might look at others too. In Window, there is a lot of rubbish. Get a Linux boot-cd, remove Adobe (use Foxit), games, lanuages you don't use, Norton or whatever other firewalls/ anti-virus you have. Put your &quot;Program Files&quot; folder onto Drive DATA, use a good registry/ operating system cleaner (&quot;Advanced System Care&quot;). Get a &quot;chkdsk /f&quot; to remove any partition & disk faults on all your drives. If you can, use NTFS (not Fat32) on all your drives; self-healing, less waste space. On my Bott drive, I NTFS-COMPRESS every folder on the drive. But do not NTFS-compress the files on the boot drive; only the folders. Retired (medical) IT Consultant, Australian Capital Territory
