Either the USB port is broken, or the case, or the disk itself.
Assuming you tested the USB port by using it for some other device and by testing the case/disk combination on another PC, the conclusion should be that the port is OK and the case or the disk broken.
Next step: mount the drive in a new case and try again.
With some luck it works.
If it doesn't work in a new case on another PC either, the disk itself is broken.
Then it's time for a new hard disk also.
A data recovery company might be able to get your data off it.
