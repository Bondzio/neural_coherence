please help.
after struggling with an range expander that didnt work.
i unplug it and reset the thing to toss.
the trouble is now i have 2 ssid with same name but one is secured and the other is not.
i tried to upgrade the old router with a new one, and the unsecured ssid still lingers on, besides having weaker signals.
now i cant connect to the new router.
when i tried go back to the old router and created a new ssid with different channel... why is the old ssid (non-secured one) still shows up on my list of network??
and the new ssid keep disappearing and i couldn't log on to it?
old router wrt54gs (using it ) new router wrt300n (ready to return to store) range expander wre54g please help
