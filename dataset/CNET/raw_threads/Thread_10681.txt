I have a lan-plus machine that runs windows xpsp3. amd athlon xp 25000+ processor,250gb hd and 1.2 gb ram. after downloading it would not install. the message was that it could'nt find suitable hardware. I reinstalled the old driver. After installing the old driver,I rechecked the updater and there was no update notice for my video card ! Can someone clue me in on this situation ? thanks

This is how things are today. What I am seeing are more people getting upset over this. Maybe, someday all makers will see fit to tell more or issue more detail. Bob
