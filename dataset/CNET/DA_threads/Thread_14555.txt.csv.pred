1.1.1	Just build a new system but I can't hear the single beep during POST I've check the speaker polarity even changed the speaker with working one still no beep.. P4 2.4B, ECS 648FX-A, DDR 333 256MB, XP Pro SP1,PSU 350Watt,40G HDD.but anyway the system is working fine any ideas ?	Ques
1.1.2	TIA !	St
1.1.3	Arnold	St
1.2.1	Just a thought.	St
1.2.2	Look in the mobo manual.	St
1.2.3	Does it say the bios should beep for ok post?	St
1.3.1	I've read the whole manual but nothing says about the OK' beep I think it's an issue for all System builder without that OK beep' first time turning the system on Thanks...	St
1.4.1	I have the same problem with an abit va-10.	St
1.4.2	runs fine, but no beep.	St
1.4.3	as best I can tell, it's how they built it.	St
1.4.4	but very aggravating of them to build it that way.	St
1.4.5	does it beep when you try to POST with no memory installed?	St
1.4.6	mine does.	St
1.4.7	--fj	St
1.5.1	systems using PC Chips mobos.	St
1.5.2	They didn't beep.	St
1.5.3	The case that I used supplied a little device that was the speaker.	St
1.5.4	It had the four pin connectors with two wires.	St
1.5.5	The mobo shows a function for three of the four mobo pins [Vcc, common, and signal] I tried all combinations with two wires.	St
1.5.6	Wasn't smart enough to try it without video to see if it beeped then.	St
1.5.7	Seems that the Beep would be a BIOS function.	St
1.5.8	So pull your video card out and see if you get lots of beeps [and let us know.	St
1.5.9	LOL]	St
1.6.1	Yes it does beep without the memory intalled,are you using the same processor as mine 'P4 2.4MHZ(B)?	St
1.6.2	It all happens from the old board a GA-8SR533P no beep but the fan is turning no POST just a blank screen butit also beep without the memory, after checking I found that the board is toast so I replace it with this ECS-648FX-A board, does it got to do with the processor?	St
1.6.3	Cheers!!	St
1.6.4	!	St
