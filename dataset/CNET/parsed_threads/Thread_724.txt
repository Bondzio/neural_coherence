<s> Hello, I'm having a little harware problem with my computer. </s>
<s> Everything was fine last week, and then my interent got blocked for a few days. </s>
<s> after it was working again, i couldn't get my mouse and keyboard working toegther. </s>
<s> both are fine. </s>
<s> If i restsrt my compouter, and i press the delete key IT WILL go into the bios at that point. </s>
<s> HOwever if the computer then loads up, neither the mouse nor teh keyboard will work. </s>
<s> If i restart the computer once i pass the sccreen which checks to see if the keyboard is present, if i unplug it then the mouse works perfectly so i know there's no prob with the mouse. </s>
<s> since i can press F1 at the start up screen, i know that there is no problem with my keyboard. </s>
<s> But when both are plugged in, neither works when windows loads. </s>
<s> Can anyone help? </s>
<s> Thanks, Dan p.s. </s>
<s> sorry about the awkwardness of this typing. </s>
<s> since my keyboard is not working my brother is typing this on MSN and i am copying/pasting it here </s>
<s> USB or PS/2? </s>
<s> Wired or wireless? </s>
<s> It's ps/2, and wired. </s>
