a single copy on one drive or even two copies on the same drive no matter how reliable fails folk all the time.
raid is interesting with the drobo (see google) but is no cure for having no backup.
if you can't lose them, get two drives and keep them synced.
here i have 3 drives that i sync but then i really don't want to lose my stuff.
