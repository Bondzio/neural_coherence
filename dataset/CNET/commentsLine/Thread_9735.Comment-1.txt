specs a7n8x-e motherboard 512mb cmx3200 corsair ram geforce4 ti 4200 amd athlon 2600+ windows 2000 pro i hope someone might be able to help me with this.
about 4 days ago my computer froze twice, the third time i restarted it would not go pass the post screen, the one that shows a7n8x-e deluxe screen.
i decided to clean out my computer with compressed air i had.
i removed most components to clean them.
after putting them back and turning up my computer now i couldn't see the screen or anything and there was no beep.
i'm not sure if i damaged something or something else is to blame.
i resetted my cmos and still wasn't able to see anything on screen, the fan from my video card doesnt spin but works fine in this current computer.
i don't know what else to try or to have one of the parts be replaced.
please if anyone can help me with this problem.
