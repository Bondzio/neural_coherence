i just tried to connect 2 laptops (windows xp) with communications cables.
each cable plugged into a usb port on the laptops.
the cables connected to usb to serial converters.
the computers indicated that the cables were connected to com ports.
this setup had been working, but i upgraded some software and i think that some settings got overwritten.
i kept getting messages that the computers were not connecting.
what should i do?
any help would be great.
thanks.
