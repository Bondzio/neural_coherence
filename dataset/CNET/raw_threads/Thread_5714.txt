The issues I am having are: I can't connect to the internet, I have no sound, all USB ports don't work. Also, when I open device manager the dialog box is empty. What happened? How can I fix it?

I tried rebooting the modem/router and pc several times and that didn't work. I then tryed running the easylink connect from the linksys web site and it said the network device was disabled. I went into device manager and it is enabled. What do you think?
