hi stephen & rick, i do not have a cordless 2.4ghz in my office where the router is and do not have any other type of wireless devices in my office.
i wanted to tell you did.
i went to the linksys website and did the following: 1)updated firmware 2)checked ssid broadcast and it is enabled.
3)checked settings and it is on mixed.
4)changed the security from wep to wpa personal 5)changed the channel from 11 to 6.
6)turned everything off and waited then turned everything back on.
i turned on my cable modem first & waited for all lights to turn green then turned router on & when all of those lights were green turned on desktop then laptop.
7)tried to connect to laptop and there is a red x in toolbar and it says wireless network connection not connected, right click here for more options which i did and it does not show my wireless network.
any other suggestions or do i need to return it and get another laptop from circuit city?
also in case you need to know my wireless router is only 2 weeks old and is a linksys wrt54g2 ver.1.
thanks so much for trying to help me.
at least i can get internet access from the desktop while i try to fix this problem since its wired to the router.
renee
