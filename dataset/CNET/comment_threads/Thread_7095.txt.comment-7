Read &quot;New Problems&quot; First So it doesnt have everything to do with the ipod, b/c it just shut down again a few mins ago when i was just doin email.
And unlike i said before, i dont have to wait any time to reboot.
(It always follows this pattern:) 1.Randomly shuts down after a while 2.I reboot.
3.
I do a hard shut down by holding power for 8 secs.
4. i reboot and it starts up with ease.
