an external drive consists of an enclosure and the drive itself that you put in, connect and fasten with a few screws.
both can be gone south.
if it's the enclosure, you can mount the drive in a new one and everything will be fine.
if it's the disk, you'll have to buy a new disk and put in in the old enclosure or buy a new set.
you can only find out by trying.
if you don't feel confident to do it yourself, a visit to a nearby computershop might be useful.
they'll be happy to check it for you provided you buy the replacement with them.
