Hi, i've bought a new pc, and it only recognises some of the dvd's I put in the drive. I have burnt loads of back up dvd's off my laptop, howver lately when I pop them in the drive, the &quot;Autoplay&quot; feature asks if I want to burn anything to them saying &quot;It's a blank DVD disk&quot;.. ..I put the dvd back into my laptop and it shows the files on the DVD no problem. Am I going to have send it back?
