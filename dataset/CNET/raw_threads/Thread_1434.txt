Proffitt	3/12/04 6:03 AM	1.07907138E12	Re:Printer Problem	Just to rule out a certain software issue, perform the printer self test and if it picks up 6 sheets, then the printer has a failure. If you can't vacuum the dust and paper bits out (you didn't reveal if the simple cleaning was done) and use some alcohol soaked paper towel to clean off the rubber rollers, then you may find repair costs exceed new printer costs. In closing, if the printer is over 2 years old, go shopping. Bob
