However, those that were done, suggest that the printer comes &quot;pre-loaded&quot; and was replaced. I haven't seen one programmed out in the field. The process maybe easy to do to transfer the logo, but not the make-up of the logo, so alot is in the air. At best, you may get by with some &quot;text message&quot;. On top of that some special s/w or standalone h/w would be needed to deal directly with the ptr. at hand. tada -----Willy
