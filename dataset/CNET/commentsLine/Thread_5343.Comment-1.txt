hi, i can't seem to figure this one out.
pc specs: asus p4s800 motherboard pentium 4 2.8ghz 512mb ddr memory i don't think anything else is relevant.
it was a barebones kit.
i put everything together back in april i think and everything was working fine.
i haven't experienced any problems until recently.
suddenly one day the computer would not boot.
i would turn it on and it would power up but nothing happened.
no beep, it would just hang.
so, i opened it up and started disconecting parts(hd, cd drives, etc) one by one.
no change.
then i started to check connections on everything else(video card, memory, etc) and nothing.
now for the part that really confusses me.
i unlocked the cpu fan to try to take it off.
i had difficulty getting it off so i decided to give up, reattached the fan and just for kicks turned it on.
it booted and went straight to system bios with a message next to cpu external frequency(i think).
it said something about the setting being too high.
i think it was at something like 200/33.
i could be wrong about that value.
i have it written down somewhere.
anyway there wasn't a lower setting.
so i left it alone and exited for the bios and let the pc boot.
after this, anytime i wanted to use my computer i would have to unlock the cpu fan, lock it again then boot.
otherwise the system would just hang without booting.
also, the computer would freeze if i had it on for too long.
now it will not boot no matter what i do.
could this be a problem with the power supply unit?
i thought it might be the processor overheating maybe.
i am really lost here and hope someone might be able to help.
thank you.
