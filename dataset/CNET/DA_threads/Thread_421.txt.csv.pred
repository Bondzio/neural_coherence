1.1.1	I 've got an HP Pavillion ZT1175 that eats batteries .	St
1.1.2	This machine worked great for more than a year on its first & quot ; factory & quot ; battery .	St
1.1.3	The operating time on that battery eventually got down to minutes , at which time I ordered a new battery from one of the large www supply places .	St
1.1.4	That battery worked fine at first , charging and discharging normally .	St
1.1.5	After about a month , however , the computer just completely shut down in the middle of a task while working on a partly charged battery .	St
1.1.6	After that , the battery would not charge at all .	St
1.1.7	The orange light came on when the charger was re-connected and remained orange for about 12 hours , indicating that the battery was charging , but the light eventually turned red , indicating that the battery was no good .	St
1.1.8	Though it worked find on the charger/power supply , the computer never ran on the battery , even briefly .	St
1.1.9	I returned the new battery under warranty and got another , which almost exactly duplicated the behavior of the first replacement .	St
1.1.10	The battery manufacturer reluctantly supplied a THIRD replacement , with a strong statement that the problem must not be in the battery but in the laptop and a refusal to provide another battery .	St
1.1.11	The third replacement , of course , has followed exactly the same pattern as the first two .	St
1.1.12	The charging circuit on the laptop appears to be working correctly .	St
1.1.13	As noted , the orange light comes on when the battery is installed and stays on for a normal charging period ( ~12 hours ) .	St
1.1.14	Then , however , the light turns red , indicating a bad battery .	St
1.1.15	After the first month of normal operation , the machine will not operate on the battery under any circumstances .	St
1.1.16	It works fine on the regular power supply , but the battery does n't appear to charge at all .	St
1.1.17	The machine gets normally warm when it 's operating , but the battery does not get warm at all .	St
1.1.18	It appears to me and the local gurus I 've talked to that I 've just gotten three bad batteries and that a good battery will solve the problem .	St
1.1.19	Since the manufacturer refuses to provide another under warranty , I 'd like some assurance that the problem is n't in the laptop .	St
1.1.20	I 've cleaned the battery contacts , which look fine , with all kinds of super contact cleaners , with no improvement at least with the remaining apparently dead battery .	St
1.1.21	In order to check further , I need the & quot ; pinout & quot ; for the battery connector .	St
1.1.22	None of our local computer shops have been able to find that info and I have n't found it on the web either .	St
1.1.23	Previous experience with HP help ( their only answer to this problem is , of course , replace the battery ) has led me to conclude that I 'm more likely to get a source for the pinout and a possible real answer to the problem by submitting the question to your online gurus .	St
1.1.24	I welcome suggestions ! !	St
1.1.25	Aloha from Kona .	St
1.2.1	Your model might be newer , and thus , the batteries do n't need to be recalibrated , but some do .	St
1.2.2	This is necessary when the battery has a large charge , but the computer thinks the battery has little or none life left .	St
1.2.3	An excerpt from HP 's manual for that computer : ''To maintain maximum battery capacity and accuracy of the battery gauge , perform this calibration procedure every few months : 1 .	St
1.2.4	Click Start , Programs ( or All Programs ) , Hewlett-Packard , Notebook , HP Battery Optimizer .	St
1.2.5	2 .	St
1.2.6	Follow the displayed instructions to test and condition your battery .	St
1.2.7	The process could take 4-6 hours or more per battery .	St
1.2.8	You can use the computer during the process .	St
1.2.9	If you interrupt the process , the battery might be left with a low charge . ''	St
1.2.10	Also , sometimes this battery recalibration option is found in the system BIOS menu .	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the suggestion , but I already tried the calibration .	St
1.3.2	When I go to the & quot ; HP Battery Optimizer & quot ; in the & quot ; Power Options & quot ; menu , I get an initial message that & quot ; the selected battery is not supported or is not working properly & quot ; .	St
1.3.3	If I click & quot ; OK & quot ; and then click on & quot ; battery details & quot ; , the resulting table says that the & quot ; static data & quot ; are & quot ; not available & quot ; , the & quot ; historic data & quot ; are & quot ; cycle count=9 ; Max error=100 ; Full charge capacity=4000 mah & quot ; and the & quot ; Dynamic Data & quot ; are & quot ; current = 0 ma ; voltage = 11264 mv ; Remaining capacity = 250 mah & quot ; .	St
1.3.4	It wo n't let me test or calibrate the battery , I presume since it 's & quot ; not supported & quot ; .	Sug
1.3.5	Since the system is apparently reading a voltage on the battery , I took the battery out of the computer and checked with a small-probe DVOM .	St
1.3.6	Sure enough , there IS about 11.4 V between what I assume is the ground pin ( separated on the right from the others ) and the fourth pin to the left of the separation ( logically , these might be pins 1 and 5 ? ? ) .	Ques
1.3.7	I guess I 'll now try to find if I can draw some current from the battery through a suitable resistor .	St
1.3.8	The strange thing is that the computer has not worked using this remaining battery for several months , so I had just assumed that the battery is bad - as indicated by the red light on the charging circuit .	St
1.3.9	Maybe it is just a bad battery/charger connector - either on the computer or on the battery , or maybe just the connection between them , though I cleaned them pretty carefully , which usually would solve such a problem at least enough to give some intermittent indication of an improvement - and that has n't happened .	St
1.3.10	Sure would help to have a schematic of the charging/monitoring circuit including a pinout of the connector !	St
1.3.11	Thanks again for the help !	St
1.3.12	Still seeking !	St
1.3.13	Aloha !	St
