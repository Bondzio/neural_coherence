1.1.1	Perhaps you recall the Startrek show that featured aliens called 'The Borg ' .	St
1.1.2	Each alien member on the spaceship was connected to a network in a way that their brains combined to make something superpowered .	St
1.1.3	Let 's say you have a small LAN of 50-100 PC workstations and each of these PC 's has a 1TB SATA hard disk .	St
1.1.4	Let 's also assume that users only use about 25 % of that 1TB disk for applications and data on the local PC .	St
1.1.5	So a 100 PC LAN has 75TB of unused disk space .	St
1.1.6	Is there any software that would allow one to take unused disk space from each PC and add that capacity to a pool of storage space ?	Ques
1.1.7	It would seem you could even use striping and mirroring of data over multiple PC 's for performance and reliability .	St
1.1.8	In other words , could each PC contribute unused storage space to a big pool that a designated server could treat as one big storage space , as in a storage area network ?	Ques
1.2.1	Is this that old idea that is new again ?	Ques
1.2.2	Google Microsoft DFS and see .	St
1.2.3	The problems are such that anyone that wanted to do this would just do it .	St
1.2.4	Those that ca n't deal with it , wo n't .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	From what I understand of DFS it can not utilize all the unused storage space that lives on Windows 7 or Windows XP workstations .	St
1.3.2	It can only distrubute/replicate data between Windows Server 2003 , 2008 , 2012 .	St
1.3.3	I would like to utilize all that unused storage space on all those workstations .	St
1.3.4	It appears DFS ca n't do that .	St
1.4.1	Your post sounded as if you were going to write code , drivers to make this all happen .	St
1.4.2	At no point was Windows listed in your top post so I thought , hey , that old idea .	St
1.4.3	These ideas were kicked around for years but as disk space costs dropped , the idea went with it .	St
1.4.4	You seem to want to try it again so why not ?	Ques
1.4.5	In other words , you 'll have to create it .	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
