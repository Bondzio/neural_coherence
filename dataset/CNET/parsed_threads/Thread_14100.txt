<s> I have an HP D2430 printer that I use with my Compaq V6444US notebook when I'm away from home. </s>
<s> Yesterday, a Dialog Box appeared with &quot;Solution Center The feature you are trying to use is on a CD-ROM or other removeable disk that is not available. </s>
<s> Insert the &quot;Solution Center&quot; disk and click OK.&quot; Since I was not trying to &quot;use anything&quot;, I don't know why this Dialog Box appeared. </s>
<s> This printer is just that ... a printer only which works great. </s>
<s> How do I keep this message from reappearing? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Try the Microsoft Installer Cleanup Utility. </s>
<s> Found with google.com it can delete those pesky &quot;pending installs.&quot; </s>
<s> &quot;Backup the machine first&quot;, do you mean to back up all critical files to a flash drive or a disk or something else; i.e., backing up the entire pc using something like Norton Ghost, Acronis, or PC Backup? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> While I have never had an issue with this tool some get squeamish over the tools warnings. </s>
<s> Your choice on this one. </s>
<s> for your responses. </s>
<s> I had this same problem a few months ago, and no idea what caused it then either, but I'm drawing a blank about what I did to resolve it. </s>
<s> Thanks again for your help. </s>
