i'm don't consider myself very tech savey, and i have added ram and a second hard drive to my computer twice now with no problems.
if you are running win xp sp2, it should be a snap.. lay the computer on it's side, open it up, find the second drive slot, put it in, plug it in..done!windows xp does a good job of recognizing, and helping you install the new drive using the new hardware wizard.
after following a few steps you'll be up and running in no time.
installing ram is kinda the same... open up the computer, find the ram slots, line up the pins, gently, but firmly push the ram module into the slot until it clicks in place.
close up the computer turn it on, and windows should go through the wizard again with you.
of course, i shouldn't have to mention this, but make sure everything is unplugged, and that you ground yourself before doing any of this stuff.
oh and since you will have your computer opened up, it would be a good time to clean all the fans etc.
of dust.
hope this helps you.
