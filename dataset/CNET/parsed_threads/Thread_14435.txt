<s> Hey people, I have a little problem. </s>
<s> I found this really good external hard drive and its nice, sleek, and best of all CHEAP! </s>
<s> and its from LaCie so thats a plus. </s>
<s> But anyway, I'm a little concerned because this particular hard drive that i want does not have a fan in it. </s>
<s> I really don't want it to die on my any time soon. </s>
<s> And i am more than likely going to have the hard drive running all the time, as i am going to be putting some frequently used media on it. </s>
<s> So, this questions is mostly directed to people who actually own this model, but do you think that it will die on my quickly because it doesnt have a fan. </s>
<s> It has a little ventilation system on the back of it, but i guess it's just holes to let air in and out. </s>
<s> Here's a link from amazon with the description. </s>
<s> Scroll down a little and you can see what the ventilation is like. </s>

<s> Passive Cooling and I've never been a fan (pun intended). </s>
<s> The interior of the case is probably aluminum to draw heat from the drive. </s>
<s> But, again, I don't trust passive cooling. </s>
<s> Excellent design as far as looks go. </s>
<s> I own three external drive cases: A Bytecc with a fan, another something brand that is all aluminum but no fan, and a 2.5 inch drive case for laptop drives with no fan. </s>
<s> Guess which one I keep running. </s>
<s> I use the other two for backups and such where the drive will not be running for long. </s>
<s> Just my thoughts. </s>
