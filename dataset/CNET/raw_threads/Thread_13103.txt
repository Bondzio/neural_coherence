I am running about 8 computers in my home business, and my web guy tells me that he can't make my combination of Macs and PCs &quot;work together.&quot; The current method of printing is to email him all documents so he can send them to the printer. He's also telling me he can't create multiple email accounts, so all the business emails come into one account which he then reads and passes along. Now I am no genius when it comes to computers, but I possess a basic understanding. Can't I just use a wired router and create a network? I realize there may be potential issues with SATA vs. USB ports on the printers as one is older, so worst case scenario would be two separate networks, right?

Your wifi router is the same technology as what your hotspot uses. -&gt; There are issues with some OSes as you go past 5 machines. XP has connection limits so a shared printer or files will only allow the first 5 machines. Read http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314882 which notes the XP Pro and Windows 2000 (Professional) limit. No need to create 2 networks. Show them your working network later. Bob
