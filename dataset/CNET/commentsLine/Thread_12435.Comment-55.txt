i have just lost my samsung 80gig hdd that came in my new hp pavilion only a year and six weeks ago.
no clicking, no grinding, nothing to suggest imminent failure; it worked for my husband at 7:00 pm and couldn't find its mbr at 9:30!
i'm using spinrite on it at the moment, which promised to be a very s-l-o-w process (predicting another 2000 hours a few minutes ago) but is now going lickety split, jumping from 1% complete to 45% in about the last half hour.
so i have some hope of data recovery fairly soon but don't know what to do about the drive itself.
trash it as unreliable?
i started reading this thread because i've bought an 80gig maxtor but now don't know whether to even unwrap it or return it after all the complaints on this board.
i've been pleased with many maxtor drives over the years, but notice they now have 1 year warranty rather than 3 as in the past, which makes me doubt...
