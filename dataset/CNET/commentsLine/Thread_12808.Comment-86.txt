i have had a dell desktop and a laptop.
i love them both.
tech support has been awesome.
lightening got my desktop, and i am relying on my laptop now...with no problem.
a close second would be hp.
all of my hp's have lasted for 4+ years or more before needing upgrades.
toshiba is dead last.
everybody i know that has one has had nothing but problems.
