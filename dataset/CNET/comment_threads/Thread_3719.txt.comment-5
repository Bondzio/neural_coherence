All, Since I am looking for a large LCD (19-21&quot;) that I will run at non-native resolution (1024 x 768 or possibly 1280 x 1024), will I get better image quality from a screen with more dots per inch?
That is, will smaller dots create crisper text when the text is scaled larger, or would fewer dots per inch be better, since its native resolution would be closer to what I'm using?
Thanks for any thoughts on how this works, Brian
