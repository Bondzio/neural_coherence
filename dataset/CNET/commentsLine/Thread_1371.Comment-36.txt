i have seen a lot of posts that mentioned socket 939, but had no idea why that was an adavantage until you just posted the reason, so thanks.
but then my question now is what is dual channel memeory?
is that the same as having more than 2 slots available for memory cards?
example i bought a dell 3000 that only has 2 slots, so if i want to &quot;upgrade&quot; i have to toss my old and buy new biger memory cards(i assume).
but the 4700 has 4 slots, so i could add 2 new cards in addition to what i have now.
i will not need to upgrade (i have 512 and that is more than enough for the uses i have for the pc) so it is not a concern to me but in the future i may be buying a pc for me that i will want options.
anyway, what is dual channel memory, and is that really the advantage of the socket 939?
