i linked the wireless netgear router from my ethernet router by linking from ethernet to the wan port in the wireless, thereby creating an access point that allows me to connect to the net, but i can't browse my network.
my network populates, but i'm denied access to any other computer except the computer that has the wireless adapter.
i was able to even send a print job.
what i don't understand is, why can't i link lan to lan ports (with the idea of being able to browse my network).
when i link lan to lan ports, i get neither net access or ability to browse network.
any ideas?i'm thinking there must be some kind of advanced settings or something, or 1 or both of the routers is somehow firewalling.
if i could get my network to populate, i'd trade in this 802.11b router for a 802.11g, but i don't think it's worth it just to access the net which is fine using the &quot;b&quot;.
just a side question regarding speed: when something is rated at 11mbs, that's 11 million bits, correct?
there's 8 bits to a byte, 1024 bytes to a meg, so 11 million divided by 8, divided by 1024, gives about 1.34 megs/sec.
am i correct in my thinking?
i've googled this, and i get &quot;it depends&quot; kinda answers- depends on binary or some other standard; forget which.
tia.
