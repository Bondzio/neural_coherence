7738	0	22803	247090	NR	Whit804	5/14/04 5:25 PM	1.0845555E12	Microsoft Wireless Keyboard and Mouse	I am running XP w/ a ASUS A7V8X-X motherboard. When I shutdown and restart my PC, my Microsoft Wireless Multimedia Keyboard and Wireless Optical Mouse do not work. I plug in a regular wired kb and mouse, test them to make sure they work, then plug in the wireless kb and mouse, they start to work again. They only stop working when I shut down my PC. Any ideas?

Try latest Intelli(insert_words_here) software. 4. Make it a warranty issue. Pack up and return as defective. Hint: &quot;Doesn't work for me.&quot; Bob
