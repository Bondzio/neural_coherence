I installed a program called SpeedFan 4.32 just to check my computer temperature.
When I installed it and it first ran, the temps were: CPU 51c Ambient 37c HD0 41c HD1 39c When I turned the computer off for the night and restarted it, the temps were: CPU 42c Ambient 23c HD0 20c HD1 19C I let the computer on while I was out today and when I returned, all the fans were running in the computer Normally, the computer is almost silent.
With the fans running, the temps were: CPU 38c Ambient 28c HD0 32c HD1 31C Should all of the fans be running 100% and is it possible that I lost a hard drive because it overheated?
