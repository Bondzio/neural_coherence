I currently own a computer from CyberPowerInc (3 years old) which has been a great computer overall but their customer service sucks. Still, I have still been unable to beat their prices. Keep in mind, I am not looking to buy a computer that includes Windows or a monitor (since some vendors make you purchase Windows). I am looking in the $500-$600 range. As a side question, is it worth it to get a AMD 64bit processor now? Also, any recommendations on the best value brands for motherboards, harddrives, DVD burners, ect. are welcome. Thank you.

Check www.newegg.com Good AMD (non 64) board would be the shuttle AN35N Ultra Good AMD proc would be the mobile 2600+ (can easily overclock to 2.5Ghz, which is what mine is at now) Memory - Mushkin about 79 bucks for 512MB (get 2 to run in dual channel mode) Hard drive - any brand should do, get at least 80GB DVD burner - I always recommend Lite On, but newegg has an 8x optorite for about 48 bucks. Video card - cheapest I would get is the 9600pro, mid would range from the 5900xt, 9800pro The motherboard I listed has onboard sound which is fine, and onboard ethernet. The processor lacks a heatsink/fan, so be sure to get one. I have the Thermaltake TR2 from CompUSA for 27 bucks. Benchmarks show my proc beats a 3Ghz P4 EE. I just put the 9600pro into a budget machine for a friend and it ran UT2004 beautifully. I have the 5900xt and it runs Doom3 on high smoothly.

Newegg.com like the other gentleman said but also look at www.pricewatch.com. Look at the barebone packages and add on from there. brand name products are almost double in price for what you get. I would wait another year for a 64 bit. the prices will be cut in half. Skip

Mainly the problem isn't knowing what I want but knowing which are the best but cheap brands. I know I want an AMD, but 32bit vs. 64 bit is in the air. Motherboards I have no idea about. Memory, I assume I should get the PC3200 400Mhz DDR kind. I actually don't need a video card and choosing a harddrive shouldnt be that hard. Finally, I dont know anything about overclocking and that kind of stuff, but I will check into that &quot;dual channel&quot; mode you mentioned about the RAM. Thanks again.

If you want to run games, multimedia, CAD, Photoshop, etc. then you should get an Athlon 64. http://techny.com/articles.cfm?getarticle=606&go=0.53769656
