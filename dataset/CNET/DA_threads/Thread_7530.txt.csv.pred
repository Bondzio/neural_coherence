1.1.1	I have two Maxtor Diamond plus 9 HD 's 80gb and 160Gb .	St
1.1.2	I am changing my Amd XP CPU to Amd 64bit Venice core 3500 and Asus A78NX motherboard to DFI Lan Party SNli 4 -DR. What is the likelihood of my hard disks being accepted by the new system ?	Ques
1.1.3	I 've got Acronis True Image for backups in case.Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	A flat out swap wo n't work because too much was changed , so it wo n't get up and run ( s/w wise ) once you power-UP .	St
1.2.2	Of course back-up or safe guard whatever data you like .	St
1.2.3	The system will see the new HDs and all , but the XP OS just ca n't accept the change , you still need to install the new h/w , re-install mtrbd .	St
1.2.4	patches , drivers , then swap data to new system etc .	St
1.2.5	to proceed forward .	St
1.2.6	I find it best to have a newly reformatted blank & quot ; C & quot ; drive to get the XP OS on and proceed from there .	St
1.2.7	If the C drive was used only as the OS , no problem but usualy s/w wants it as defaulted HD .	St
1.2.8	Do you get the picture ? ? ?	Ques
1.2.9	You can try , but it 'll probably sit at the boot-up screen for awhile ( give it time ) and see what it does , it may ask for whatever to proceed forward .	St
1.2.10	safeguard data before doing that ... tada -- -- -Willy	St
