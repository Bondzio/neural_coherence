Hi: I just came upon your message of some years ago.
If its any help, I'll do what I can for you.
You can help me out too.
I just pulled the router & card out and went to install them on a different laptop but discovered I didn't have the power plug.
I have other plugs, but need to know the voltage and polarity.
Can you help me?
Thanks, John
