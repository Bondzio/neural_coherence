<s> I'm wanting to build a low-end graphics workstation. </s>

<s> All I need is a bare bones set-up: case motherboard CPU video card Memory Power supply I've already got drives, and monitor, etc This isn't supposed to be a dream machine, all I care about is comfortable performance: I want be able to work big, and in multiple layers without freezing-up, that's it. </s>

<s> all prices are estimates from web stores and include shipping. </s>
<s> shop around and you might be able to save a bit more. </s>
