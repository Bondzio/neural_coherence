I never would buy a monitor without having seen it in a store.
I think both brands are great although I have a slight personal preference for Asus.
When you buy on ebay, I assume you're buying a used monitor which is something I would definitely avoid.
I've seem too many refurbished ones go bad.
` Good luck.
