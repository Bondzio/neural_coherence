I want to be able to use this on my mac and windows 7 computers. So I want to be able to switch between the two easily (I used to have a WD that was capable of doing this). I read that it needs re-formatting to work on a mac, is this true? What simmilar external hard drive could I buy that would allow me to easily switch between the two OSs?

Older versions only supported FAT32 and why you read about re-formatting. That advice can be outdated. In closing be sure this is not the only copy of your work. This forum is testament to this. Bob
