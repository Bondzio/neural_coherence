With the system stripped down to board, processor and power supply there are three beeps, which I presume indicates a base 64K RAM failure.
Upon insertion of ram (the ram is good, and has been checked) then it's back to square one, and no beeps no POST.
The processor is good as it works with other boards.
So.....the system does respond to no ram with a beep code but goes dead with ram installed.
