i was backing up some of my dvds recently and noticed that it took an extremely long time to burn them.
lets just say it usually took about 40min total to copy onto the harddrive and burn a dvd.
now it takes over 80 min!
this was pretty abrupt.
ive defragged, & scanned for everything.
not sure what else to do.
dont know if this matters, but theres about 30GB of space left on my 120GB harddrive, but this never prevented a faster burn before.
