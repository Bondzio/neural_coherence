The memory is mix by shared and dedicated. I think the dedicated memory is 64mb and total will be 511. It is good enough for Vista? If I upgrade the system memory, I will have 1023 mb totally. Is it better? more shared memory will help the performence?

When it comes to 3d &quot;performance&quot; we have speed, features and the number of 3d things it can do. -&gt; No it will not get more Frames Per Second. -&gt; Yes it will perform better since it will have more texture memory and the video can be richer.
