hey, i have setup a static ip address through windows xp, and i am trying to forward ports to my xbox 360 (to avoid strict nat settings).
the problem right now is that i cannot access my routers set up page.
i am using a d-link wbr-2310, which is not installed on the pc, but runs a password-protected wireless network.
i have run ipconfig, and have obtained the ip address and default gateway.
when i type either in my web browser (tried firefox/ie) i am led to my dsl modem's setup page and not my wireless router.
i have tried every ip address possible (from the default router address to the ipconfig) and i cannot access my wireless router setup.
through the d-link website, i have also tried to use an emulator, but i am unable to make any changed regarding port forwarding.
once again, my wireless router is not installed, and the installation is not working because &quot;the router is not detected- error 322&quot; i have been trying to solve this problem for the past 4 hours with no luck so i would appreciate any help!
thanks in advance
