<s> I recently upgraded from 256MB to 1GB of regular DDR RAM. </s>
<s> Both the bios and DirectX Diagnostic say that there is 1GB RAM, so it is installed correctly. </s>
<s> The thing is, the computer really doesn't seem faster. </s>
<s> As far as page filing goes, the system is managing it. </s>
<s> It says that the recommended is 1486MB while 1487MB is allocated! </s>
<s> Why is a gig and a half allocated when I should have more than enough proper RAM? </s>
<s> My processor speed is something like 1.8GHz and I have gotten rid of all but the required start up programs. </s>
<s> It's so annoying when iTunes takes 25 seconds to load! </s>
<s> Arrg! </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>

<s> One question is what processor do you have? </s>
<s> If it is a Celeron or Sempron then you may have your computer needing more processing power which isn't the same as speed. </s>
<s> The idea with more memory is that for memory-intensive tasks things may be done in shorter time. </s>
<s> Generally I don't think it'll seem that much faster. </s>
<s> As for the 1486 MB recommended allocation this is likely due to windows wanting 1.5 times the physical RAM which is common. </s>
<s> I have 2 GB of RAM and windows recommends I have 3069 MB of virtual memory that just seems unnecessary to me so I have it set to 0. </s>

<s> virtual memory. </s>
<s> The 1400 number is simply telling you how much hard drive space is being allocated for virtual memory. </s>
<s> As far as normal running of XP not much improvement when one goes above 500 Mb. </s>
<s> There are some specific areas where a little more will help. </s>
<s> High level gamers know what they are. </s>
