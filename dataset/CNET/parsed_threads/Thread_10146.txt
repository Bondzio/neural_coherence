<s> Hi, I'm about to start my undergrad this fall and hopefully major in Industrial Engineering. </s>
<s> Every living fibre in me is telling me to get the new MacBook but I can't help but wonder if a PC would be much more suitable for my studies. </s>
<s> I'll be using the laptop mainly for music, movies and work. </s>
<s> So, Mac or PC? </s>
<s> what programs you will absolutely have to use for your course. </s>
<s> Then check to see if there is a Mac equivalent. </s>
<s> If there is, go get a Mac. </s>
<s> If there isn't, go get a Mac, load Boot Camp, load Windows and only use it for that one, absolutely have to use, Windows program. </s>
<s> The rest of the time, enjoy OS X Would that be the MacBook or the MacBook Pro? </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> Yup, took your advice and asked my school to which they replied by sending me this link, http://www.cae.wisc.edu/site/public/?title=onetoone and by telling me that the engineering department runs Windows and Unix machines. </s>
<s> Sorry but I'm a (soon to be) first time Mac user, shouldn't a Mac be able to work since its based on Unix? </s>
<s> Anyways, as mrmacfixit asked, I think it's going to be the 2Ghz MacBook and I'll throw in my own 2GB of ram. </s>
<s> that the Productivity software is MS Office. </s>
<s> Available as Office 2004 for Mac, Student & Teacher edition ($125) has everything except MS Access. </s>
<s> Check out the On Line Software Catalog, they sell Mac stuff! </s>
<s> Also note that their &quot;recommended&quot; computer purchase is a Windows box. </s>
<s> The fact that the engineering department runs UNIX machines does not mean that require students to have a computer that will run Unix. </s>
<s> I am not aware of a UNIX/Windows dual boot machine, Bob will comment if there is, but you have an advantage as your Mac has a form of UNIX already, if you actually need a UNIX machine. </s>
<s> Your lovely new 2GHZ Macbook will do admirably and, with Boot Camp, will even run Windows. </s>
<s> Good luck P </s>
