Installing Windows (all versions) is a long painful hunt for drivers for the machine and all accessories.
There is NEVER a step by step procedure for each machine from what I can tell.
Only guides.
And there must be thousands out there making a fine living installing Windows.
What I would do is to recreate the machine just like Dell delivered.
Use dell's restore media and all their CDs supplied or ordered from Dell.
I do know some try the &quot;CLEAN INSTALL&quot; or want that but I find many just get upset over the days and weeks of efforts to do that.
