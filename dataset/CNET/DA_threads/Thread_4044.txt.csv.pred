1.1.1	Hello , I have a Sony Vaio with a Pentium II processor , 320 Mgs of RAM , I put a new 60G Maxtor ATA hard drive in about a year ago and installed Windows XP and have been very happy with the setup , with the exception of the slow processor .	St
1.1.2	I recently aquired an IBM PC with a Pentium III , a 30G hard drive and 256 MGs of RAM .	St
1.1.3	My question is , how do I move the 60G hard drive that 's all set up with XP , then make the 30G hard drive a slave ?	Ques
1.1.4	I tried just removing the 30G hard drive , putting in the 60 , then going into BIOS and & quot ; auto detecting & quot ; hard drives , but it would n't boot up .	St
1.1.5	I tried several different things , manually changing the setting in BIOS to make the new drive the master , etc , that did n't work .	St
1.1.6	Then I gave up , put the 30G drive back in the IBM and decided to try installing XP on the 30G drive ( successfully ) , then transfering everything over via serial cable using the & quot ; Transfer files & settings & quot ; wizard that comes with XP and neither PC could detect the other after a couple of hours of trying .	St
1.1.7	After I tried that , I restarted the IBM with the 30G drive with the recently installed XP and it says that I have to activate XP , or I wo n't be able to log on to Windows .	St
1.1.8	There was a message that would come up saying that I had 30 days to activate , right before I attempted the transfer .	St
1.1.9	I am wondering if the reason I ca n't transfer everything , is because I have XP on both PCs installed from the same disk .	St
1.1.10	I do n't plan to ever use the Sony again , other than for parts , so I should n't be violating Microsoft 's policy on having XP installed on more than one PC .	St
1.1.11	After rethinking everything , I think that the optimal setup would be to use the 30G drive as the master and the 60G as the slave for storage , but at this point , I would settle for anything that gets the IBM up and running with all of my settings , files , etc , from the old PC .	St
1.1.12	I ca n't afford to take them to a repairman to have them switched ( that 's why I am upgrading to a PC with a Pent III in the first place ... boldly stepping into the 90s !	St
1.1.13	) , plus I 'm a DIY type of a guy and want to learn to do it myself .	St
1.1.14	BTW , I changed the jumpers on the drives to the appropriate position with each attempt .	St
1.1.15	Any advice would be much , much appreciated ! !	Polite
1.1.16	!	St
1.2.1	While the hard disk will function , this OS will fail to boot .	St
1.2.2	To add insult , the OS may not work after you put it back !	St
1.2.3	No version of Windows has moved with grace from machine to machine .	St
1.2.4	XP is definitely to worst of the lot so far .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thankfully , it still worked when I put it back in the Sony , or I would n't be able to post on here now , lol !	St
1.3.2	Any suggestions on how to transfer the files & preferences to the new PC ?	Ques
1.3.3	One of the things I did is I put the 30G drive from the IBM into the old machine ( Sony ) as a slave ( it had ME on it at the time ) , then I did a & quot ; government wipe & quot ; with Norton utilities , because I figured it would be best to start with a fresh , empty drive .	St
1.3.4	That worked just fine , I then put the drive back in the IBM , then installed XP which went just fine also , I was able to log on to XP on the IBM just peachy ... until I tried to transfer my files and preferences ... then it said I needed to activate XP on the IBM , or it would n't finish booting up .	St
1.3.5	I figured I could do the same thing again with the wipe , but when I put it back in the Sony as a slave , it recognized the new hardware , it showed that the drive was working properly , but I could n't access it , therefore , I could n't wipe it again .	St
1.3.6	I suspect that 's because I have XP on both drives , so it wo n't allow me to access the slave in an effort to prevent a conflict , am I right ?	Ques
1.3.7	I have thought about just backing everything up on the 60G drive , then putting it all in the 30G drive in the IBM , disk-by-disk , but that would take approx .	St
1.3.8	20 CDs ( around 25 gigs ) , which would get fairly expensive , not to mention very time consuming !	St
1.3.9	I think I may break down and call Microsoft and see what I need to do to get the files transfered .	St
1.3.10	This has been a very frustrating exercise in futility at this point .	St
1.3.11	All I 've seemed to accomplish is to raise my blood pressure and give myself a headache !	St
1.4.1	& quot ; Any suggestions on how to transfer the files & preferences to the new PC ? & quot ; Read http : //aumha.org/win5/a/fast.php which explains this .	St
1.4.2	& quot ; I have thought about just backing everything up on the 60G drive , then putting it all in the 30G drive in the IBM , disk-by-disk , but that would take approx .	St
1.4.3	20 CDs ( around 25 gigs ) , which would get fairly expensive , not to mention very time consuming ! & quot ; This is not nearly as espensive as how much it costs to get your files back when a hard disk vanishes .	St
1.4.4	Data recovery still runs about 1,000 USD and 20 CDs cost me about a dollar so that 's a winner .	St
1.4.5	Also , I see many people that never have a copy of what they can never lose .	St
1.4.6	Its sad how ill prepared people are when the hard disk or entire machine vanishes .	St
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	I have used this in the past .	St
1.5.2	When you put the 60GB HD in the IBM machine boot the PC with your XP install disk and do the repair fuction on the XP install , choose the the no recovery diskett option and just let the install program & quot ; fix & quot ; the nessary files for the new hardware setup .	St
1.5.3	John	St
1.6.1	That sounds simple enough , but how much risk is there for losing data ?	Ques
1.6.2	I am in the proccess of backing everything up right now , but of course , I am hoping I wo n't need to use the back up disks .	St
1.6.3	It would sure be nice to be able use your suggestion and have everything work just the way I have it now , but with the newer PC !	St
1.6.4	I really appreciate those that have taken the time to help me with this problem , it 's good to find a place where I can get advice from those that are more experienced than I am .	St
1.6.5	I get the feeling that I will be spending a lot of time on these boards in the future !	St
1.6.6	I may attempt using your suggestion tonight , if you do n't hear from me for a while ... well , lets just hope it works the first try !	St
1.6.7	Thanks again for all your help !	St
1.7.1	Only a few in a thousand will lose the hard disk data .	St
1.7.2	You have to decide if you will roll the dice .	St
1.7.3	It may be even less than that , but when a person loses it all , they usually post somewhere like here asking how to get it back .	St
1.7.4	Those who backup , just shrug and figure they were lucky .	St
1.7.5	Bob	St
1.8.1	I think I will roll the dice on this one , it sounds pretty straightforward and I 'm in the process of backing everything up right now , so I will be about as prepared as I can be .	St
1.8.2	Hopefully , by this time tomorrow I 'll have everything working properly on the new ( er ) PC !	St
1.8.3	It 's a lot more reassuring to have good folks like you to give me advice than when I just try things on my own , hoping they will work out .	St
1.8.4	Of course , I will probably still do some things on my own and when I mess things up , I 'll be back for more help , lol !	St
1.9.1	OK , I put the 60G drive into the IBM , booted from the XP setup CD , selected the repair feature , selected the drive ( C ) to repair , but it needs an & quot ; administrator password & quot ; to continue .	St
1.9.2	I tried the one that I use to logon to Windows , I tried various others , such as & quot ; 11111 , & quot ; & quot ; 12345 , & quot ; & quot ; 00000 , & quot ; etc .	St
1.9.3	I even tried just hitting & quot ; Enter & quot ; but I ca n't get past that point .	St
1.9.4	So I put the drive back in the Sony and thankfully , it still works and here I am !	St
1.9.5	Is there a default administrator password , or a way to bypass it somehow ?	Ques
1.9.6	I even went into BIOS and reset the 2 passwords ( 1 & quot ; Supervisor , & quot ; 1 & quot ; User & quot ; ) that are in there , but that made no difference .	St
1.9.7	This is very frustrating !	St
1.10.1	In your last post you did n't tell if this OS was from some HP and you are moving it .	St
1.10.2	Frankly , the license does n't allow it .	St
1.10.3	I offer NO FIX for this issue .	St
1.10.4	Read : 1. http : //www.petri.co.il/forgot_administrator_password.htm 2 .	St
1.10.5	Read http : //support.microsoft.com/kb/312149/EN-PASSWORD-EH !	St
1.10.6	and use it on XP Home too !	St
1.10.7	Bob	St
1.11.1	No , I bought the full home version of XP about a year ago ( at Staples , I think ) and installed it on a brand new Maxtor 60G hard drive that I put in my Sony Vaio .	St
1.11.2	I had the understanding that as long as I was just upgrading to a newer machine and I used the same hard drive from the old PC and the old machine would not have that same version of XP , it would not violate the license agreement .	St
1.11.3	Of course , I could be wrong about that though .	St
1.11.4	I do n't even plan to use the Vaio for anything but parts , in fact , it wo n't even have a hard drive once I get this problem worked out .	St
1.11.5	I hope that does n't violate the agreement , because it does n't seem fair to me that I paid around $ 250 for the full version of XP and a year later , I have the oportunity to put a better PC together using the same drive that version of XP was originally installed on and I may be expected to shell out another $ 250 ( or more ) for another new OS .	St
1.11.6	I think if that 's the case , I 'll save my money and get a Mac , just so I 'm not putting anymore money in Bill Gates ' pocket !	St
1.11.7	If I have to buy another OS , that will put the total for this little project almost high enough that I could have just bought a brand new PC that would be much better anyway .	St
1.11.8	I 'll check out those articles you posted and see if they will help , if not , I guess I 'll just have to break down and call Microsoft and see if they can help me get it worked out .	St
1.11.9	The problem with that is , I understand that they charge something like $ 35 for that call and that does n't neccessarily guarantee the problem will get solved .	St
1.11.10	I REALLY do n't have the money to do that , that 's why I came here for help instead .	St
1.11.11	I just had a thought ... Is there a chance that the password it 's asking for is actually the product key code that comes with the Windows Disk ?	Ques
1.11.12	Maybe I 'll give that a shot , I 've got nothing to lose but the time it will take to do it .	St
1.11.13	Anyway , I really do appreciate the help you have given me , it 's very nice of you to take the time to help somebody else out like that , thanks .	St
1.12.1	You do n't even have to keep it on the same hard disk ...	St
1.12.2	If you activate too many times a week or some such thing , you get to call the 800 number but even then it 's fast and you just say your machine had a problem ... Best of luck in your repairs !	St
1.12.3	Your welcome , Bob	Polite
1.13.1	I 've been meaning to post an update on here , but just have n't been able to find the time until now .	St
1.13.2	I wound up calling Microsoft tech support and they told me that they were n't even sure if what I wanted to do would even work .	St
1.13.3	They suggested uninstalling XP SP2 and all the other updates , as well as my Norton Internet Security and Norton System Works then trying the transfer , but there was no guarantee that it would work after all that and I still might wind up losing some data .	St
1.13.4	So what I decided to do , is activate XP on the 30G drive in the IBM , then just run a restore on my backup ( 12 CDs ) into that drive and then do a wipe on the 60G drive and use it as the slave .	St
1.13.5	This worked quite well , it was a bit time consuming , but well worth it !	St
1.13.6	I am now on the IBM , I now have a PIII processor , 384 mgs of SDRAM , the 30G drive as the primary and the 60 for storage .	St
1.13.7	It has a built-in DVD ROM as well as a built-in CD writer , which is nice , since with my old setup , I had an external CD writer .	St
1.13.8	This is a vast improvment over my old system with the PII !	St
1.13.9	And I only spent slightly over $ 200 in the process ... not bad for a stupid plumber , eh ?	Ques
1.13.10	Lol !	St
1.13.11	The best part about doing the transfer the way I did , is that I was never down , I always had a functioning PC to access the Internet ( 2 of them at one point !	St
1.13.12	) , which is good , because I sell on Ebay and ca n't afford to be down for very long !	St
1.13.13	In fact , that 's what worried me the most , if something went wrong , I would have to go down to the local Public Library and use the public PCs to take care of business on Ebay .	St
1.13.14	That idea just does n't sound good to me for some reason , lol !	St
1.13.15	Anyway , I just thought I 'd let those that took the time to post and give me advice know that it all turned out well in the end and I really appreciate the help you gave me , thanks ! ! !	St
