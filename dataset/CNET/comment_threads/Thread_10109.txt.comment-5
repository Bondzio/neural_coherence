Upgrading the case would mean a new motherboard as it will not fit properly.
a new motherboard will mean a new operating system.
I suggest to upgrade to 2x512sticks of PC3200 ram.
And get a decent card that will not take up too much cpu power.
Maybe the 9600xt or w/e, definitely not the 9800pro which is very good, but not sure if the psu can handle.
On nvidias side, maybe the 6600 not gt.
