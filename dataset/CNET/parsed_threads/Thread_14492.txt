<s> I was wondering if it is possible to see DISH Network channels on a PC. </s>
<s> i know that it is possible with the regular cable (like comcast) with a TV Tuner card, but i am not sure whether it would be possible to do it via a DISH receiver. </s>
<s> can any1 help me? </s>
<s> cause i was about to buy a TV tuner card and this just struck me. </s>
<s> -thanks </s>
<s> The issue is similar to multiple receivers for the DISH. </s>
<s> A cheap solution is to get your PCI TV card and connect the composite input to the output of the DISH decoder box. </s>
<s> There may be an internal PC Card for such, but I don't want to know the price. </s>

<s> Put the tuner card on channel 3, connect the RF/coax dish output to the RF/coax card input and watch. </s>
<s> I have a USB Tuner that I connect to laptops and desktops. </s>
<s> Or you can spend some bucks on a tuner card with S-video inputs. </s>
<s> But the resolution of a PC monitor is nowhere near a good TV. </s>
<s> hey thanks man, i called up the DISH support and they could not help me with this. </s>
<s> cause i was thinking since the DISh in goes into the receiver and the out goes into the TV (which is the same connector on the tv tuner card) i figured it should work. </s>
<s> about the quality, will the &quot;Hauppauge WinTV-D Digital TV Tuner Card&quot; also give lousy quality? </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> Can you hook up Dishnetwork satellite box to tv and computer at same time? </s>
<s> Can you watch different channels on each? </s>
<s> Would I need a router? </s>
<s> I have 2 tv tuners in my computer. </s>
<s> I tried everything that is talked about here and it worked great, I can watch my dish network programming on my tv and record. </s>
<s> As for your tuner card, I tried Hauppauge 1196 WinTV HVR-1250 PCI Express Hybrid High Definition TV Tuner Card and it worked great. </s>
<s> I dont know if that is the version you tried but good luck. </s>
