I want it mainly for my computer, so I just want to mainly put movies on it. I might do music, but I mainly need all the videos off my desktop. I've looked at the Western Digital drives, but their network ones have a very low score. I was just wondering what my best bet would be for this, and I'm looking to spend under $200 for 250+GB, even if I need to use my own hard drive. Any positive help is useful. Thanks!

This becomes a great indictor of dependability for the drives. At less than $100.00 for a 500GB drive, add another $30.00 for a USB external case and your problem is solved.

And I have an external USB/1394 case somewhere, but I was having issues with it due to not wanting to clear the drive. Also wanting the networking capability to share family photos over the LAN.
