new to this wireless thing...our local cable company helped me set up the security part....not sure what info you need, but something happened he couldn't figure out.... i was unsecured for a few weeks...called them up..now my internet connection is secured, but i can only get on if im hooked up (ethernet)..if i'm wireless, the pop-up immediately shows indicating it cant connect..no asking for my key or anything..but if i try to connect to a neighbors secure...the key question does come on.... its also interesting that i can connect to another neighbor's unsecured network, but not my own...any thoughts would be appreciated.
