DVD writers are created equal.
Learn the difference between +R, -R. +-RW both on the dvds and the writers.
Make sure you have the correct mix.
Most of today's writers do it all, including CDs.
Then there is the issue of each writer's laser alignment.
If either is off just a little bit, you'll have the same problem.
Good Luck!
Let us know.. and life goes on... Jack
