My advice is to do a clean install of XP, assuming: 1) You have all your data files backed up.
2) Your system is new enough to recognize and boot with the CD only.
3) You have a broadband connection so you can perform all the necessary updates after installing a fresh Operating System.
Using dialup to fetch updates will take HOURS!!!!
Downloading SP2 with dialup is an overnight job (266MB).
When you install XP, you have the option to do a &quot;clean install&quot; or a re-install which leaves all the drivers, programs and data.
Delete all partitions and create a new partition for your C drive.
This can all be done right from your XP disc, no extra software is needed.
With SP1 and SP2, the space taken should be less than 3.5 GB.
