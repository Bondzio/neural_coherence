<s> My computer is 5 years old--p2/550--would an new soundcard (and speakers) make for better sound or is audio through a computer inherently poor? </s>
<s> I listen to college radio (the ones that stream @ 128k), mostly, and cd's. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Your computer is quite old, it is barely worth spending money on a system that old, but, YES, you could definitely improve the sound dramatically by getting something like a Soundblaster Live with Quad speakers and a subwoofer, the difference would be dramatic and pretty incredible if you bought good speakers. </s>
<s> You can always use the speakers on a new system when you upgrade in the future. </s>
<s> Speakers like the Cambridge SoundWorks run $100 or less for some pretty incredible quadraphonic sound. </s>
<s> Thanks for the advice. </s>
<s> I bought some speakers and it improved my music quality tons. </s>
<s> I purchased Ev Sonic Xs THe tend to be alittle expense depends on where you find them. </s>
<s> With a 120 watt Subwoffer and 2 60 watt speakers you cant go wrong. </s>
<s> 240 watts best clear sound they can cost from 100 to 150. </s>
<s> But Bose speakers which are really small and have little base but a really really crisp sound. </s>
<s> I have purchased both but i enjoy the ev sonic because of the power. </s>
