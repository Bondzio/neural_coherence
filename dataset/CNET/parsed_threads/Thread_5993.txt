<s> I just ordered a bunch of parts from TigerDirect and they arrived in good order. </s>
<s> They are as follows: 2x2 sticks of Patriot Sector5 Ram (4 Gigs in total DDR3) Running dual channel with two slots open. </s>
<s> PC3-12800 MHZ The motherboard is Biostar A770E3 AM2+ Compatible. </s>
<s> Processor is AMD 6-Core 2.86 GHZ Phenom II. </s>
<s> (1055T) Video Card is a GeForce GT 430 (1024 MB of DDR3 RAM.) </s>
<s> 1 Terabyte Sata-II 7200 RPM Hard drive. </s>
<s> (Old IDE DVD drive as temp-Ordering new one soon) So, the problem is: On boot up it won't boot from any discs or usb drives. </s>
<s> I haven't installed anything to this computer, I've never built a computer from scratch, but I have put them together hundreds of times before. </s>
<s> The only thing that the computer displays after boot is this &quot;Hardware Monitor&quot; It tells me the specs of the system. </s>
<s> Anything that might help is appreciated. </s>
<s> And if I find the answer, I'll be sure to post it. </s>
<s> eww biostar, anyway have u gone into bios and set the boot order , recheck all the cables / power n data connected ? </s>
<s> Is your cd drive IDE ? </s>
<s> Is it cbl select or set as master or slave ? </s>
<s> Usually set the cd as master alone with 1 hdd sata connected. </s>
<s> Or if hdd and cd are IDE , use the same cable with hdd as master and cd as slave. </s>
<s> I've checked and rechecked each of the cables in the computer. </s>
<s> Yes, I've gone into the bios and changed the boot order, I've also pressed F9 and selected which device to boot from. </s>
<s> The drives are set properly~I'm not really a novice at this. </s>
<s> I've actually never asked a forum for help before. </s>
<s> Your sure the cd IDE is master by itself on end of chain ? </s>
<s> Some cdroms only like cbl select with some mbs. </s>
<s> Did u enable sata in bios too ? </s>
<s> The IDE cable is definitely a master, with the end of the cable used. </s>
<s> The hard drive isn't the problem, as I've never installed anything onto it before. </s>
<s> In order to install something on it~I need a disc drive that reads discs. </s>
<s> Right? </s>
<s> I've tried a USB memory stick and it didn't boot either. </s>
<s> I've got someone to lend me a Sata DVD burner. </s>
<s> As the motherboard is naturally SATA-II anyway. </s>
<s> Thinking on it, I've come to the conclusion that it must be the ancient technology that the motherboard simply doesn't recognize without the drivers. </s>
<s> If there is anything in between that might help~ Like, I haven't installed the BIOS drivers yet, because it can't read the discs to get the drivers. </s>
<s> Don't think your wanting to solve your problem. </s>
<s> As I already asked ..... Is the jumper on CDROM set to master? </s>
<s> Maybe &quot;cable select &quot; if not noticed when on master. </s>
<s> Did u enable sata in the bios. </s>
<s> Bring it here I'll fix it or tell u what broke in 10 minutes !! </s>
<s> Now your forcing my hand lol I have to ask what this exactly means &quot;I've never built a computer from scratch, but I have put them together hundreds of times before.&quot; </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Uh, I believe that the motherboard is SATA-II and therefore as I've said, the SATA ports work just fine :P I think you wouldn't be able to fix it in ten minutes xD Yes, again, I said the CD drive is set to master. </s>
<s> As well It means, I've taken apart and rebuilt already built computers hundreds of times. </s>
<s> But I've never purchased a mobo and all the parts and put them together and installed everything. </s>
<s> I think you're starting to sound arrogant. </s>
<s> It's not appreciated. </s>
<s> But youve missed what I suggested, Try this .... Make sure you remove the power cord from the back first. </s>
<s> Unplug all hdd and CDROM Unscrew the CDROM and take it out, now check where it says the lil jumper should b to make it master. </s>
<s> Now put the CDROM back in and make sure it's on the end of the IDE cable. </s>
<s> Now see if u can boot the cd, if not, remove the CDROM again and put the lil jumper on cable select. </s>
<s> Put it back in and see if u can boot. </s>
<s> If the it does boot either as master or cbl select then try another IDE cable and/or CDROM If you get the CDROM working reconnect the hdd , go into the bios and find where it enables sata and make sure it's enabled. </s>
<s> If neither the Ide or the sata don't work I would think bad mobo or maybe although less likely the psu or try switching ram I would also check the temperatures inside the bios Last hope reseat the CPU Computers eh </s>
<s> I wanna know what beeps it makes. </s>
<s> If this your mobo and it may not be updated http://www.biostar.com.tw/app/en/mb/memory_report.php?S_ID=450 That ram is not on the qvl list. </s>
<s> I NEED 2 know what's wrong here </s>
<s> It doesn't make any beeps. </s>
<s> I know that the mobo isn't updated~No discs or memory sticks work on this computer. </s>
