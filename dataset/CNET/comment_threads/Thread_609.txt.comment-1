I was looking at motherboards featuring the Intel 965 Chipset.
I have heard of problems with this chipset working well with DDR2 memory above 2.0v Is there any truth to this?
I wouldn't want to decrease my memory voltage, but run it at the voltage the manufacture specifies in order to keep the performance that I am paying for.
