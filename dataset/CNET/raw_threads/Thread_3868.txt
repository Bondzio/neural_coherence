Proffitt	8/16/09 2:36 PM	1.25043336E12	And I don't understand your reply.	&quot;i set the motherboard to boot from the CD ROM, save the changed and insert the windows cd,&quot; This makes no sense to me. But let's look at your top post. You say you installed Windows. Fine, that's done. Now tell me what MOTHERBOARD DRIVER PACKAGE you install next. In your top post you supply four motherboard models of Intel d865glc/ d865peso and d865pcd /d865pck. I wish you could pick one but I've lost count of the times people post such and you discover later it's a HP model v6790 desktop. Don't hide details like that. -&gt; Said motherboards come with a driver CD which looks like will be un-useful at this point. When this happens I reload windows and check my work. But here's the driver from INTEL.COM for that chipset. Good luck!

In another forum, a guy mentioned that it could be as a result of blown or leaking capacitors, i check all the caps and none are leaking or swollen.

All you can do: remove all unnecessary hardware. Keep only necessary hardware (one harddisk, CD, (PS/2) keyboard, (PS/2) mouse, video). Then try again. If it's still failing, it's one of remaining components. You already excluded the hard disk, it seems. That leaves the fans to check (can be a temperature issue) and the motherboard, the RAM (try it with one stick if that's big enough), the CD drive, the keyboard, the mouse, the videocard and the PSU to replace. Choose the sequence you like most. Kees

Proffitt	8/20/09 8:05 AM	1.2507555E12	The really hard rule of thumb repeated.	&quot;If original holographed Windows XP CD won't install, it's a hardware issue.&quot; Yep, that's true. Nothing in your post reveals what could be busted here. It could be bad anything to issues like someone trying to format a drive ahead of time to too much RAM for the XP in question. Or simply trying to use a Dell, HP, Gateway XP CD. Bob
