<s> Hi All, I own 3 80GB drives (Model - ST380011A) purchased at different times, Due to some problems in the SMPS one of the drive had burnt one of the IC on the circuitry and now I can not access the drive completely. </s>
<s> My office IT ppl suggested to remove the burnt circuit and put the circuit of a working drive and try booting the drive again.. </s>
<s> I tried but the drive did not detect. </s>
<s> However I could find that the platter is rotating freely (from the sound). </s>
<s> So i guess the Head and internals of the drive are fine. </s>
<s> Can anyone help me with that. </s>
<s> Let me know if you require more details. </s>
<s> looking out passionately for a response. </s>
<s> Thank you in advance, Kritz. </s>
<s> One suggestion is to look carefully at the old and replancement (new) on-board controllers and make sure the &quot;new one&quot; is configured exactly the same way as the original. </s>
<s> Look for jumpers, dip switches, etc. </s>
<s> and set them the same way as they were on the old one. </s>
<s> You might also verify that the drive that had the replacement controller was visible to the OS before swapping the cards. </s>
<s> Good luck, -Ron </s>
<s> I have no idea what you mean....the word &quot;burnt&quot; does not exist. </s>
<s> Do you mean &quot;burned&quot;? </s>
<s> If swapping boards fails you move to the usual names in the business such as Ontrack and Drive Savers. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The word &quot;burnt&quot; cerainly does exist. </s>
<s> It is in fact an older and somewhat more cultivated word for &quot;burned.&quot; </s>
<s> Hello Kritz, As your Hard drive is not being detected, you need to contact some data recovery service provider, such that they can recover your data back. </s>
<s> As you said that your hard drive head is alright, I think the changing of IC board will do the job and you will recover 100% of your data. </s>
<s> You can contact Stellar Information for the data recovery service. </s>
<s> http://www.stellarinfo.com/data-recovery-services.htm Stellar provides hard disk data recovery services worldwide through its well equipped Data Recovery labs (Class 100 Clean Room) and experienced professionals. </s>
<s> The recovery techniques with failed electronics to switch boards and chips are known to work. </s>
<s> If not, there may be a higher level of failure requiring lab facilties and trained technicians. </s>
<s> I work for ActionFront Data Recovery Labs and have seen first hand hard drives with failed electronics and destroyed read/write heads. </s>
<s> Some times there is physical media damage possibly created from the end-users attempting to power up the drive. </s>
<s> Extensive platter damage usually means all opportunities for recovery are lost. </s>
<s> If you would like to discuss this, takin' is free at 1 800-563-1167. </s>
<s> Best of luck! </s>
<s> Some time back I had an major hard drive crash and at that time i contacted Stellar ( http://www.stellarinfo.com ) .. As my hard drive was making sound, they suggested me take the hard drive to their data recovery clean room. </s>
<s> And my Good Luck! </s>
<s> They were successful in recovering my data.. then I went through the successful data recovery stories & testimonials of stellar I came to knew that these people have recovered the data from burnt hard drive also... </s>
<s> They are really god for lost data... www.stellarinfo.com </s>
<s> Hi,maybe you have some explanation!!! </s>
<s> I had two hard disks,system and data.Few weeks ago I saw a message &quot;secondary hard disk error,press F1 to resume&quot;,which I did and everytime when I turn on pc it was ok. System red from secondary /data/ hard disk. </s>
<s> I checked it few times with system tools/xp/,everything was ok. And... Once,when I chehcked,jumper and cables /on secondary hd/,after that,when I turned on pc again,I saw same message but I didn't see hd! </s>
<s> Sometime bios see hd /when I put it to find it manually/ but system doesn't. </s>
<s> There weren't any strange sounds or &quot;clicks&quot; or bad sectors and hd is spinning as I can notice. </s>
<s> Cables and contacts are ok. </s>
<s> I gave it to some good boy to change electronic board ,he did but it without any results?! </s>
<s> That's the story! </s>
<s> Regards Zoran </s>
<s> You could try freezing the drive. </s>
<s> I don't know about a burnt out circuit, but drives with heat problems can be used by sticking them in the freezer for a day or two and work for about 20 minutes or so before crashing again. </s>
<s> (this usually one works 2 or 3 times in a row then *dead*.) </s>
<s> Chances are you will need to take it to a repair shop and have them get the data off of it. </s>
