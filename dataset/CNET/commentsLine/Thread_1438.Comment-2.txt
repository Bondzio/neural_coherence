cheapest and simplest upgrade would be 1gb pc3200 (2x512mb) ram.
corsair value ram will set you back $90 and a ati 9600gfx card, will set you back another $93.
total $183 ~$200 upgrade.
if you really want a 6600 or 6600gt, you would a better psu, a better psu would be to burdensome, and you might as well get a new computer.
