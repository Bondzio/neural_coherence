depends on the paper stock.
not bad enough for me to complain here but your old litho operator will pan it.
that is, i have to use a magnifying glass to see it.
it's not up to the 3 dollar cards you see at hallmark.
as to ink costs.
i have used the 1 dollar per page metric for years and after paying for ink, paper and printer it has been too close for me to change it.
if your clients won't pay the buck a page then it's time to cost out the printing at a print shop.
