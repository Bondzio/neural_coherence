No links offered about TAA but it has something to do with government contracts and something called TAA compliance.
I have found that this may have had something to do with a lawsuit against a major government supplier...that being CDW(G).
I now see that, at the same link I provided in the OP, that HP offers TAA compliant toner cartridges.
These cartridges carry both the &quot;g&quot; suffix and a higher price tag than those not labeled TAA compliant.
You'll see the difference in price in this link but find no difference in the actual product.
Your tax dollars at work.
