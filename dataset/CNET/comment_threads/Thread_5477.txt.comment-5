Thanks, Kees, I did a system restore to 5 days ago, and the Internet access was working again!
I never figured out how to totally remove a network connection, but it looks like it's a moot point now.
As for what caused the problem, I don't know if it was McAfee; I'd read that a recent McAfee update caused people to lose Internet access.
To be safe, I installed AVG on the problem desktop and uninstalled McAfee.
Who would have thought that after all the connection settings I changed and commands I entered, something as simple as System Restore would solve the problem?
That's a lesson I won't soon forget!
