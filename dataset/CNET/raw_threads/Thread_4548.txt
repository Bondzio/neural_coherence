I have uninstalled and reinstalled it, but it doesnt print, message says to check cables, but I see it still isnt in the device manager. Any ideas for a non advanced computer user? Thanks, Sarah

I'm in the dark too. Bob

I uninstalled in the programme in the control panel, and used a CD rom to reinstall the printer. I use a parallel interface to plug in the printer. Is this any clearer? Thanks, Sarah

Since you noted it is connected to the parallel port, a boot with your DOS diskette and tapping PRINTSCREEN a few times may be a good test to see if it's an OS issue or just a dead cable or printer. Again, you need to tell if the printer self test works, what lights blink and more. Bob

Select the command prompt. After that stops. You should have a C: prompt. Tap printscreen and tell what happens. If nothing, then you may have a dead printer, printer port or cable. I'll leave you to read your printer manual for the printer self test. Tell what happens. No manual? Go to epson.com and fetch it. Bob

I remember this problem starting when I switched off the computer and the printer hadnt finished switching off. I tried PRINTSCREEN, printscreen, but the command is invalid. Should I just type C:\&gt;PRINTSCREEN then enter? Sorry, I'm not very DOS literate. My computer is French, so windows is in French, but I guess MS DOS is universal? Sarah
