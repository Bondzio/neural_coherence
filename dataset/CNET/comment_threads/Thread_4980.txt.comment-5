I have this R3000 laptop that can go from 70 to 40 Watts just by the throttle.
Now I do have to cheat by using SPEEDSWITCHXP to kick the CPU to high gear instead of dynamic switching.
And I can carve another 10 watts by dimming the screen.
That's better than 50% difference from full throttle to full power save mode and it's still usable.
