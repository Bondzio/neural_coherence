13161	0	54868	654108	NR	Dinahd	1/3/05 1:08 PM	1.10475768E12	Computer Won't Turn On	I have a HP computer and lately I've been having trouble getting the computer to come on. I've checked the outlet and made sure all the connections were tight. The green light on the monitor is on so I know it's receiving power but nothing happens when I try to turn it on. Any ideas?

Power off, remove the case and reseat all the cards and cables. Try again. 2. The fans don't come on. Depending on your expertise, downsize the machine all the way to just motherboard and power supply. If no power up (the monitor is not an indication here), then you are looking at the 2 possible bad parts. Bob
