It is designed for daily computer tasks, and still have the ability for HD digital content. It has a very stylish design and you would have a hard time putting it under a desk. Also like all of our systems it has a life time labor warranty. Link to system : http://neospc.com/nyx.html The one in this link starts at $799 ( free shipping ), but contact our sales department and we can design one much closer to your target price.

There are many discount computer stores online that sell what your looking for in your price range. Not to advertise for them but a company to get you started would be tigerdirect.com. Bestbuy and office depot would be other choices too. I would recommend you buy a computer for your work use first and personal use needs second. HP, Dell, Lenovo, Systemmax, etc. all have computers in your price range.
