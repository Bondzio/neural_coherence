I have a customer that recieved his modem from SBC and I need to have him open port 5631 and 5632 for PCAnywhere and SBC's support tell him that they are open but they are not.
I googled and downloaded the manual for this but it is not the software that SBC had him install and the logon is not the same.
Does anyone know how to open these ports from the SBC installation.
Thanks
