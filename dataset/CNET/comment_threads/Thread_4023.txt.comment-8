You are needing a High Gain Directional Antenna.
You would probably be best going with the same brand as the router, but any one should do.
The D-Link I've linked to below is about $150, but says it will go about 2.5 miles!
I know you don't need that distance, but that should be strong enough to punch through some trees.
