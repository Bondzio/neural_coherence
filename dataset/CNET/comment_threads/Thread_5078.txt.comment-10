Yeah i think im good with one gig, the reason why is the latency...2-2-2-5 on the twinX's would be lowered if i added more.
And a good latency is one of the things you need for quality gaming.
On another note, i just saw the ''OC'' version of the 7800 GTX that runs at 460 MHz rather then 430..Is it worth it?
