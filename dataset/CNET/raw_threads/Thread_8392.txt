If you find your way to the XP RECOVERY CONSOLE, then FIXMBR will overwrite it. In closing, a proper XP install does NOT use the old DOS format command. Those who don't learn the new ways tend to suffer a little. Bob

I tried to install XP after formatting the drive (via XP cd) and...low and behold...all of the old user files were still there. What I am used to.... With the OX install CD you have the option for 3 levels of erasing: quick, zero, zero then write random. I assumed this was standard.
