Any thing go wrong with the hardware? Thanks a lot for your help!!

Back then the render time was 6 hours on the 512MB RAM. We wondered what would happen if we ran the render on both machines then swapped RAM, did the test again and see the results. The results were identical on both machines with the results tracking the installed RAM. The machine with 512MB RAM rendered the work in 6 hours (almost exactly). The machine with 1024MB RAM finished 5 minutes earlier. For that time or year of the PC this showed the bottleneck was not in the RAM for this render. Fast forward to your machine. The faster machine was 16% faster which shows that the 31 percent faster clock rate wasn't directly affecting or a factor. Remember that I don't want to write that the i5 is only 2 cores with 4 threads dive into computer design. I won't do that here. --&gt; The results are as expected. If you wanted more payback you might have checked out transcoding using the GPU or asked if there was a way to be sure that all cores are at work. BEWARE that many CODECS will crash on multi-core, multi-thread calls so when that happens I can't help you as you must talk to the author/company of the CODEC. My answer? Yes. Seems right to me. In other words, nothing funky with those results. Bob
