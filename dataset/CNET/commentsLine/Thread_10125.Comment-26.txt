legalbob- i dont recommend filtering your fans because of dust build up.
cooling performance could whind down because the filter will collect dust and wont be able to suck the dust out through your exausht fans.
you'll be changing or cleaning filters more offten than using an aircan to clean you componets.
those preciouse moments when the filters clog up before you clean them could cause unwanted damage.
i only say this out of personal experience and research.
you'll also notice that computer companies only use small mesh grilles at most.
not because the companies want to rip you off, its because the companies know the danger of dust clogging airflow.
dust can also start fires.
remember always that filters are ment to do one thing- and that is to trap dust!!!!
trapped dust = poor airflow
