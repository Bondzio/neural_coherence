hello i'm a student mct at howest belgium.
and according to what we've seen in class, i can only conclude that there is a life expectancy for both usb hard drives, flash drives, ssd, ... this is due to the fact that most datastorage devices are based on the same theory, to isolate electrons.
they use different isolators in each hard drive and the life expectancy of the hard drive can be &quot;calculated&quot; knowing the isolators used in the hard drive.
though most of the time the malfunctioning of a storage device isn't due to the isolator material, but due to some other factor, ... there is one advice i can give you.
which is to never try to save money on storage devices, seriously don't.
cause i've heard people say &quot;ooh look a 500 gb hard drive for only 50 euro !&quot;, but when you read online forums about those hard drives, you're more likely to find hundreds of topics listing failures and malfunctions, etc ... i myself have been using packard bell hard drives for quite some time now and they're very easy to use and hardly ever malfunction.
if you are keen on having a good hard drive, i'd advice you to spend a couple 100 extra and buy a solid state disk.
they're the best of the best out there and are a lot faster.
