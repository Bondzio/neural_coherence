1.1.1	Hi guys , My desktop PC has two SyncMaster 940N 19 & quot ; LCD monitors .	St
1.1.2	Lately ( noticed it for the first time a couple of days ago , and it 's happening again now ) I 've noticed an problem with the right hand one only .	St
1.1.3	I 'm not sure how to describe it , but it seems as if high contrast things leave a & quot ; shadow & quot ; ( darker or lighter depending on how the contrast is ) to the right of them .	St
1.1.4	I 've taken screenshots and added the shadow in how I see it - it 's something wrong with the monitor itself displaying things , hence the shadow does n't show up in screenshots .	St
1.1.5	http : //members.westnet.com.au/gbaatard/monitor1.jpg The bars of shadow have been added to the right hand column which is meant to be solid blue .	St
1.1.6	Here 's the original page : http : //www.techspot.com/news/29994-mpaa-demands-154-million-from-the-pirate-bay.html As you can see , the shadow lines up with lines of text / buttons , and is darker where the blue & quot ; Techspot Pricewatch & quot ; bar is .	St
1.1.7	http : //members.westnet.com.au/gbaatard/monitor2.jpg This one is more obvious ... the background is meant to be solid black , yet there 's a lighter section to the right of the notepad window .	St
1.1.8	In the past I 've very rarely ( total of 2 or 3 times over a couple of years ) had one monitor ( im sure it was the right one most of if not all the times ) go entirely solid bright grey - the pc keeps working fine , but nothing can be done to make the grey go away other than rebooting .	St
1.1.9	I put this down to an occasional wibble in the powersource or videocard ...	St
1.1.10	In both the current issue and the greyscreen , turning the monitor off and back on does n't help .	St
1.1.11	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.1.12	The PC was built by a friend ( who I 've lost contact with ) from parts he got wholesale , so it 's not under warranty ...	St
1.1.13	Thanks , Kefka Some PC Specs , although I doubt they 'll be too relevant : Processor : Intel ( R ) Core ( TM ) 2 CPU 6600 @ 2.40GHz ( 2 CPUs ) DirectX Version : DirectX 9.0c ( 4.09.0000.0904 ) Video Card : NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTS 640 MB	St
1.2.1	Swap monitors around , if the problem persists in the same side , think the video card is faulty .	St
1.2.2	If not and appears on other side then monitor .	St
1.2.3	You should also use a monitor testing gauge/pattern to check results and fine tune output and make as best as possible beforehand , to help in these matters .	Sug
1.2.4	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	Sometimes the shadowing problem can be attributed to a faulty video connection between the PC and monitor .	St
1.3.2	Try these simple things first .	St
1.3.3	Reseat the video cable at both ends first , and make sure they are securely fastened .	St
1.3.4	If the cable is poorly shielded , you may have to separate the cable from other nearby power cords in order to isolate interference problems .	St
1.3.5	If the above actions do not fix your problem , then try swapping the cables between monitors .	St
1.4.1	Thanks , I tried that briefly the other night when it was happening , and it may have helped a bit - it 's not a permanent problem , and when it does happen it 's often very subtle and barely noticeable ... At least , until I notice it , after which I ca n't stop noticing it : P Will fiddle with the cables properly and see if it helps .	St
1.4.2	If no luck with that , will look into it further as suggested by Willy and try to isolate the problem .	St
1.4.3	Thanks !	St
1.5.1	Reseated the plug in on the monitor end , no help ...	St
1.5.2	But noticed the shadowing got a bit better/worse when fiddling with the cable ... Reseated it on the video card end , and shadowing disappeared .	St
1.5.3	Yay !	St
1.5.4	Thanks muchly .	St
1.6.1	Great job !	St
1.6.2	Glad you were able to fix it without too much trouble .	St
1.7.1	I was going to say that it is a common problem , Happens with VGA cables , fidgeting is a short fix , if it returns , replace the VGA cable .	St
1.7.2	I have seen it dozens of times .	St
1.7.3	I think thats what your problem is .	St
