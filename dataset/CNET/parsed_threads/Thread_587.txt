<s> Hi There can someone point me in the right direction of a web site that shows how to test a ATX PSU ie what voltages etc should be coming out of what leads etc. </s>
<s> I realize it should be under load conditons, MOBo and at least one hard drive but the rest I have no idea. </s>
<s> So your informed help would be greatly apreciated. </s>
<s> Kindest Regards Tony B. </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20021021/powersupplies-15.html shows a test rig for testing a power supply. </s>
<s> Such are rarely needed for most of us. </s>
<s> In fact, a new power supply with Watts to spare will cost much less than testing. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> [OSHA will hate you. </s>
<s> LOL] You can probe the rear of the power connector on the mobo. </s>
<s> The black leads are all common [ground in most peoples terms]. </s>
<s> The main 5 volts is on pins 4 , 6, 19, and 20. </s>
<s> The main [once] 12 volts is on pin 10 [now there is also a separate 4 pin 12 volt connector, 2 pins 12 V and 2 Gnd, it is now spec'd to be provided by a separate set of rails in the supply]. </s>
<s> The 3.3v is on pins 1,2, and 11. </s>
<s> The pins run from 1 thru 10 down one side and 11 [next to 1] thru 20 down the other side. </s>
<s> The 11 thru 20 side has 4 black wires the other row only 3 black wires. </s>
<s> 5 volts are virtually always Red. </s>
<s> Minus 12 and Minus 5 volts are virtually no longer used. </s>
<s> Testing an ATX standalone means you have to learn how to turn the supply outputs on. </s>
<s> Robert's link probably shows that. </s>
<s> I chuckle over some stories. </s>
<s> Why do you need to test it? </s>
<s> Pwr supply fan runs=+12 good. </s>
<s> Processor fan and other fans=+12 good. </s>
<s> Hdd spins, Cdrom drive opens=+5 good. </s>
<s> Need meter (Harbor Freight ~$5) for -5 -12 -3.3, which I have found burnt out a few times because the current rating is small. </s>
<s> www.duxcw.com/faq/ps/ps4.htm is a link to describe the voltages of typical ATX supply. </s>
<s> do with a voltage scale????? </s>
<s> They draw virtually zero current. </s>
<s> That's the point of a voltmeter. </s>
<s> The old D'Arsonvals were usually 10,000 OHMs per volt. </s>
<s> Modern digital are multimegohm. </s>
<s> Meter burnouts occur when one tries to measure 120 VAC when on an OHMs scale [does it every time]. </s>
<s> Just a thank you to all who have contirbuted to this discussion. </s>
<s> Regards Tony B. </s>
<s> -12, -5 are rated at about 300-400ma, while other voltages are rated 5a-20a. </s>
<s> The point being that the minus voltages can be easily burnt out. </s>
<s> I don't think they have the same interupt as the + voltages do. </s>
<s> Short out the +5v and the pwr supp will restart instead of burn out. </s>
<s> Lightening or other way excessive surges can more easily burn out -voltages, as has been my experience. </s>
