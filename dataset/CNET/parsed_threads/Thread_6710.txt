<s> Hi Thanks In advance for any help. </s>
<s> I recently tried to upgrade my Dell C521 4GB 32-bit, Radeon x1300/1550 graphics card with this: SPARKLE SX98GT512D3L-NM GeForce 9800 GT 512MB 256-bit GDDR3 PCI Express 2.0 x16 HDCP Ready Low Profile Ready Video Card - Retail from Newegg It was a bit difficult to insatll but i pluged it in and turned on the pc....the button usually green is yellow and only the the fan and dvd drive come on..the pc dosent boot up. </s>
<s> I was thinking i need to replace the power supply which was 280Watt. </s>
<s> My warranty recently expired and I'd like to avoid paying $50 only to be told to order a power supply. </s>
<s> Thanks -T </s>
<s> appears to have a separate power connector on the rear side. </s>
<s> It needs a direct connection to the power supply in order to work. </s>
<s> Did you see it and plug in the connector? </s>
<s> yes I did see it but was not clear what pluged into what. </s>
<s> plus the cords didnt strecth. </s>
<s> But about the power supply..do you think I need to replace it...is there a &quot;reset&quot; button? </s>
<s> All my product doc is on the hard drive, so I cant look anything up. </s>
<s> and it may not have the 6 pin PCI express power connector that the video card needs. </s>
<s> No, there's no reset button. </s>
<s> You may not have zapped the PS but it's a good bet it's under powered for your system now. </s>
<s> So you mean I will have replace power supply? </s>
<s> SO then I'll have to replace? </s>
<s> I don't want to sound rude but, if the answer is &quot;No&quot;, the answer to your question should be obvious. </s>
<s> If it does have the connector and you haven't plugged it in, the next step to take is also obvious. </s>
<s> That's all I can offer. </s>
<s> Best of luck. </s>
<s> Sorry I wasnt clear....I actually pluged in the video card turned on the pc and it ran bu didnot boot up. </s>
<s> Seconds later i kind of smell a burning smell and tuned it off. </s>
<s> the smell was comming from the power supply. </s>
<s> I tried to turn it on and and then the fan would only start, and dvd drive. </s>
<s> So this is why I'm thinking the power supply? </s>
