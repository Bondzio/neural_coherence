1.4.2	To that I 'll add Kingston and Corsair also offer RAM for most PCs and armed with the manufacturer name , series and model number of your PC ... you can go to their websites and see what they offer and recommend .	St
1.4.3	The good thing about buying from Crucial , Kingston or Corsair is they guarantee compatiability with your PC if you buy one of their products recommmended for your PC directly from them .	St
1.4.4	Some of their products are also available at NewEgg.com ZipZoomFly.com , etc. , You could buy generic RAM and hope it works but in my experience you 're way ahead by going with good quality brand name stuff unless you 're a glutton for pain and punishment .	St

1.9.1	and look at the TAB called ... & quot ; Mainboard & quot ; ... give us the exact manufacturer NAME , MODEL NUMBER , and REVISION NUMBER .	St
1.10.1	AMD Sempron 1200 MHz is the CPU that is installed .	St
1.10.2	The SIS 741 mis the chipset that the mobo uses .	St
1.10.3	Many mobosof different mfrs use SIS chipsets .	St
1.10.4	You really need to find the mobo model to be sure of the speed memory that it is designed for .	St
1.10.5	It is true that one can use faster rated memory in a slower bus and it will simply run fine but simply at the lower clock speed , and you could get away with PC 3200 DDR 400 , although that seems like a rather older CPU .	St
1.10.6	But it is best to be safe before wasting money getting unsuitable memory .	St
1.10.7	Buy from outfits such as Crucial and Mushkin , will give lifetime warranty and replacement if it is the incorrect type	St

1.13.1	Under the Mainboard tab , the only information present is as follows.. Motherboard -- -- Model : SiS-741 Sensor : ITE 8712 Bios -- - Brand : Phoenix Technologies , LTD Version : 6.0 PG Everything else in this tab is grayed out .	St
