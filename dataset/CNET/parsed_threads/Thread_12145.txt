<s> My old computer caught on fire and I'm hoping that the HD still has it's programs and documents on it. </s>
<s> I was told to go and get a HD enclosure for my old IDE drive. </s>
<s> I am a novice at this... My new computer is running Windows 7 and the old one was running Windows XP Professional. </s>
<s> Can I still use the HD enclosure with 2 different systems? </s>
<s> Is there anything I need to know before I go buy one? </s>
<s> Also, will I be able to take programs off of the old HD i.e. </s>
<s> Photoshop CS2, MS Office? </s>

<s> Programs NO! </s>
<s> Programs have since about 1995 been designed to never be transferred from machine to machine so nothing new here to report. </s>
<s> I'm unsure why people continue to try to move programs after 14 years of failures. </s>
<s> So the files should be OK but not the programs. </s>

<s> Will I be able to use the old drive as an extra drive and access and use the programs on it? </s>
<s> I have MS Office Suite so that isn't a problem to download on the new computer, but somehow CS2 came up missing when I moved. </s>
<s> Use the programs on that drive = NO! </s>
<s> Again, it's been nearly 15 years and this has never been supported or worked. </s>
<s> Hope I'm being clear enough. </s>
<s> About CS2. </s>
<s> One thing I learned over the years is to REGISTER MY NAME with the software makers. </s>
<s> It's a treat when I get the software replaced for a pittance compared to a new license cost. </s>

<s> Bob, I hope that my question didn't irritate you near as much as your response seemed that it did!! </s>
<s> If so, I apologize. </s>
<s> As I said, I'm a novice at this... your first email indicated that I couldn't move the programs, but that was different than my second question. </s>
<s> I took all the steps to register CS2, so I will try to contact Adobe and see if I can get either CS2 replaced or the current CS4 at a reduced rate. </s>
<s> Thank you for that advice! </s>
<s> Karen </s>
<s> I kept it short and blunt so there would be no misunderstanding. </s>
<s> Sometimes you find folk that won't state the answer clearly YES or NO and you read the member asking again and again. </s>
<s> I wanted to be crystal clear about it and hope I didn't offend you. </s>
<s> Let's hope for the best with CS2. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
