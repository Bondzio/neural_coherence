Windows 98SE recognizes my Kensington serial trackball as a generic serial mouse, and it works OK when I first plug it in.
The problem occurs later, when I reboot, and no mouse is recognized at all.
There does not appear to be anything wrong with the connector.
Should I get an adaptor and try it on the PS/2 port.
Is it any better than the serial port, or is there no difference at all?
Although I have another USB mouse that works fine,I like the Kensington because the size of the trackball makes it easy to move around.
Any suggestions?
