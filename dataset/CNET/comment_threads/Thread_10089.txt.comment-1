by sugarbear246 - 8/25/10 10:51 PM I have a Pioneer DVD-RW DVR-107D--(DVD/CD Rom Drive) (Burner).
I AM TRYING TO UPDATE THE (FIRMWARE TO THE LATEST VERSION V1.22) I successfully downloaded the (Firmware) and KNOW THE COMMAND TO RUN AT THE:&quot;COMMAND PROMPT&quot;, AND I HAVE THE FIRMWARE DOWNLOADED AND INSTALLED IN THE (PROPER DIRECTORY TO RECEIVE MY COMMAND)!
GOT ONE PROBLEM THOUGH, THE COMMAND PROMPT TELL ME (I NEED THE &quot;KERNEL&quot; THAT GOES ALONG WITH THE FIRMWARE UPDATE, BUT I'LL BE DARNED IF I CAN FIND (&quot;WHERE TO DOWNLOAD (DVR-107d V.122 &quot;KERNEL&quot;?
Anybody out there got any ideas?
Boy what a Bummer!
Thanks; Sugarbear246
