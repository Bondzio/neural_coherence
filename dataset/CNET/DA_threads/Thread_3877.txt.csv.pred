1.1.1	I am creating a new system with a Chaintech 478 board 3.06 cpu, it has 2 Promise raid slots on it, I am not planning to use 2 drives, But can I hook up a single drive to one, or wll I need to install a PCI card (which I have) to run it.	St
1.1.2	I have all the other ide's used up with the main drive and zip cd dvd&lt; I wish to hook up my old drive from this system, to download the programs and files I want to keep.	St
1.1.3	The paperwork doesnot say if you can hook up a cd or zip?	St
1.1.4	J Fretwell jacf@jacf.com	St
1.2.1	You can usually select these ports to operate as standard IDE ports for hard drives but not ATAPI devices such as CD ROMs, ZIPs, etc.	St
1.2.2	Your best bet is to find a manual to confirm this, however.	St
1.2.3	If you can add a single drive, you will find a change in the BIOS necessary.	St
1.2.4	I have an ASUS board with a RAID controller that works either way but, again, no ATAPIs allowed.	St
