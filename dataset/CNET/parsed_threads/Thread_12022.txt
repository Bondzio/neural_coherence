<s> There is a website called chinavasion.com that advertises the subject tablet at a low $200s pricepoint. </s>
<s> Does anyone know about this website? </s>
<s> The tablet has decent specs, dual core 1.6ghz, 16 gig, 1024x768, dual cameras, etc., etc. </s>
<s> At this point is the hardware secondary to the operating system? </s>
<s> Would it be foolish to purchase this over the smaller nexus 7 which has a higher pricepoint? </s>
<s> Are we at a point with tablets, which PCs reached some time ago, that branding shouldn't matter? </s>
<s> And is about 200 bucks as well. </s>
<s> There are a bazillion Chinese tablets which you can get today. </s>
<s> Here I would only get one if I paid nothing for it and counted on ZERO support. </s>
