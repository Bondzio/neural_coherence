if the video port is ashew then yes you can replace it.
you will need to &quot;disable&quot; the build-in mtrbd.
video and install a new video card.
the new card should contain instructions for all this or at its support website.
place electrical tape to prevent the video port from moving to possibility cause a short or whatever, just keep it from moving.
