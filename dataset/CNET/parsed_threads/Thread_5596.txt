<s> Have a Dell Dimension 3000, running XP and have a Ms Pacman game installed. </s>
<s> Using the keyboard is kind of a pita. </s>
<s> A joystick would be easier. </s>
<s> I have a couple of usb ports available. </s>
<s> Can I just get a plug and play joystick? </s>
<s> Where do you suggest I find one? </s>
<s> Does anyone even use a joystick anymore? </s>
<s> I feel old fashioned by even asking the question. </s>
<s> But I know my 5 year old (and I too) would be happy playing the game with a joystick. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
