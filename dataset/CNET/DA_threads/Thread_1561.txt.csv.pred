1.1.1	Hey guys , I purchased a new Seagate 500gb SATAII 7200.10 16mb hard drive .	St
1.1.2	It 's my first time with a SATA drive .	St
1.1.3	I installed XP on it , everything was working good .	St
1.1.4	I then went to restart , when I noticed that the pc wont boot all the time with this new hard drive .	St
1.1.5	Sometimes when I reboot , it 'll boot right into windows.. Then , other times when I reboot , on the last page before displaying the windows loading screen , it 'll just sit , with the little underscore in the top left corner .	St
1.1.6	Sometimes I have to reboot 5 times before it 'll boot up .	St
1.1.7	Other times it 'll boot up right away .	St
1.1.8	I do not get any messages or errors , and no weird beeps .	St
1.1.9	Any idea what I can do to fix this ?	Ques
1.1.10	It 's simple enough to just keep rebooting , but it does become a pain ...	St
1.1.11	Thanks alot ! ! !	St

1.2.1	jumper HDD to SATAI ?	Ques
1.2.2	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	Not sure..try scanning for bad sectors maybe ?	Ques
1.3.2	Just throwing ideas out there .	St
1.3.3	Try maybe a different SATA connector on the mobo and see if that helps .	St
1.4.1	The jumper was removed , making it SATAII .	St
1.4.2	I ran SeaTools for Windows , and it passed .	St
1.4.3	My mobo supports both SATA and II .	St
1.4.4	I have plugged it into all of the other SATA connectors to make sure , and it still does the same .	St
1.4.5	Thanks guy.. any other ideas ?	Ques
1.5.1	If that does n't work ... I 'd try setting the HDD back to SATA ... retest .	St
1.5.2	How current is the MB BIOS ?	Ques
1.5.3	VAPCMD	St
1.6.1	I have never updated the BIOS .	St
1.6.2	Should I give it a go ?	Ques
1.6.3	If so , how does the program for windows by ASUS work for upgrading the BIOS ?	Ques
1.6.4	I 'd prefer to do it that way , then via DOS , or whatever it would be .	St
1.7.1	Go to the ASUS site and post your question/scenario in the forum for your motherboard .	St
1.7.2	Much easier to get specific you need there .	St
1.7.3	I 've never used anything other than the DOS version to update a MB BIOS ... suggest seeing the BIOS notes for your MB to see if they address the problem you 're experiencing .	St
1.7.4	VAPCMD	St
