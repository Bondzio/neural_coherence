Unfortunately it didn't come with a modem installed. I installed a &quot;NetoDragon 56k Voice Modem&quot;, but am for some reason unable to connect to the internet using MSN 8. I installed MSN 8 and chose &quot;I've already signed up&quot;, and was immediately greeted with the following error message; &quot;We're sorry, we cannot sign you up for MSN because there is a problem with your computer or the MSN service. Please try again later.&quot; The driver for the modem is installed, and I can use the &quot;Internet Connection Wizard&quot; which successfully connects to the &quot;Microsoft Internet Referral Service&quot;, so apparently the modem is working. I've never had to install a modem on a computer, having had them already installed when I bought them, and thus have absolutely no idea what to do here. Can anyone help with this problem?

Note: If you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem. My first guess is that Windows 2000 isn't properly installed. Try installing the latest motherboard chipset drivers. I copied the forum note since without those details I can't be more specific. Bob

But it seems there was never any problem with the modem to begin with. After a bit of digging, I managed to find an old trial CD for a different ISP, and installed it. It worked. I was able to connect to the internet, and visit websites without any errors. I used the guest sign-in feature in MSN 8 after going online, and that even worked. Apparently the problem is on MSN's end, not mine. Even while connected to the internet, the sign-up wizard was saying I was offline. Now all I have to do is hope MSN customer service doesn't put me on hold and forget about me.. again.
