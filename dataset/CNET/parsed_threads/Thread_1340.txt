<s> I don't want to spend $800 for something I'll hate. </s>
<s> I looked at an iPad and Amazon Fire but I wasn't sure if either supported Youtube and Netflix. </s>
<s> I learned Samsung has Bluetooth and both Youtube and Netflix pre-installed. </s>
<s> How easy is it to get connected when traveling? </s>
<s> Also, I looked at two models at Bestbuy and I'm not sure what the difference is between the GT-N8013EAVXAR for $499 and the Model#: GT-P5113TSVXAR for $299. </s>
<s> Can anyone more tech inclined explain it? </s>
<s> I'd appreciate any recommendations as this is my first tablet purchase and I want to get the right one the first time. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
