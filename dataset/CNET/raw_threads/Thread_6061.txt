Those you list add up to about $932.98 from Newegg. On the Corsair RAM, your Mobo accepts DDR2, 240Pin, 533 (PC4200). Assume you have selected the correct Corsair Value Select Dual channel 1024MB kit. The 1GB should be enough. If not add more later. You may also want to add a internal Card Reader Floppy combo for around $20-$25. Also consider a Modem, Router, or Network card. I also like to have two optical drives in seperate bays, like a DVD/CD burner in one (your BenQ) and a inexpensive DVD-ROM in another. You may also be able to get the GeForce 6600GT graphics card instead of the GeForce 6600 and stay within budget.

I didn't look up the Asus board, but I assume that it does have firewire ports. Video rendering speed is processor 1st, memory 2nd, HD speed 3rd. 1gb of dual channel memory should work OK. John
304	7	110914	1262075	1261431	ksoiehawo	6/24/05 1:28 PM	1.11961968E12	is there such thing as a 6600GT 256MB?	I was thinking of maybe getting a 256MB video card if it would still fit in my budget, but I could only see one from XFX... is ther any other manufacturers that make 256MB GT's? and another question, how does VIVO work? Does it stand for Video In/Video Out?

304	11	110914	1265520	1262075	ozos	6/26/05 4:05 PM	1.1198019E12	uh, it's essentially a gimmick	XFX is an excellent brand, so if you want the 256MB go for it but 256MB was not a reference design by nVidia for the 6600GT (128MB, however, was) it doesn't meant it won't work, it just means the RAM has been added for marketing reasons, it won't provide a speed benefit due to the 6600GT's performance just consider, a 6600GT isn't slow, but it doesn't kill any game at 1600x1200, as in with all the settings maxed, the extra 128MB of RAM would help it if that were the case (extra RAM means more room for textures, and resolution data, it keeps it from off-loading to the AGP or PCIE buffer, but that doesn't happen that often) a card like the 6800GT has 256MB because: A) it's targeted as a top end part and B) it can make somewhat better use of it but in most tests comparing a 128MB card to a 256MB card, the performance increase (if it's using the same GPU) isn't noticeable such as the X600Pro 128MB vs the X600Pro 256MB the performance difference is like 1% if even
304	12	110914	1265523	1265520	ozos	6/26/05 4:08 PM	1.11980208E12	forgot about the VIVO question...	VIVO does stand for Video In/Video Out on the video card you normally have an S-Video output (either between the DVI-I and VGA, or to one side of both) with VIVO you need an adapter to plug into that, usually a small breakout box, but some OEM's just use a multi headed cable here is a 6600 with VIVO http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814127164 and here is a 6600GT http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814127150

People who do a lot video editing in the Mac fromat keep their projects on externial firewire HDs. This way they can switch easly from one project to another. If you go the AMD64 route get a scoket 939 and a chip that has Vience core. John

I have read that the 955X requires a newer type of power supply, is this correct? and if so, would the Antec that I chose work with it? Also, what is the difference between the 955 and the 945 chipsets, cause I found an Asus 945 for about $50 less...
