I have several old computers - everything from 386 to Pentium III and a HP Pavilion 6535. I no longer have space to store them and so will be getting rid of them. I want to strip out the components worth saving. I 'm keeping the hard & floppy drives and the DVD/CD-Rom drives. The batteries - most of them still keep excellent time. IDE cables and removable power cables. What about the following for the Pentium 1 and up? PSU (power supply unit) fans mother boards video card sound card anything else? (I know that these components in the 386/486 aren't worth saving. Or are they?) If you're scratching your head wondering why I think a Pentium 1 component may be worth keeping, it's because I'm using a Pentium 1 (Windows NT 4.0) for non-internet use. Would be perfect if not for the paltry 2GB hard drive. One final question: how does HP Pavilion 6535 compare to the Pentium 1? I have searched on the internet, but can't find the year the HP was released. I will say this, though - the hdd is in an upright position and everything is jammed together to make it impossible to remove and insert cables, power supply cords, etc. Several times I wanted to take this particular computer out onto the street and smash it apart. Thanks!

In fact I like to freecycle old gear like this because it costs a lot to take them to the e-cycling centers. 120 bucks one time for the dead RPTV! So if you can find folk to take such off your hands, big savings. Bob

That would include Pentium 1,2, and 3 for sure, and most Pentium 4s as well. When it comes to hard drives, I wouldn't want anything less than a 200 GB SATA drive. Floppy drives? I've kept one just in case, but haven't had reason to use it in probably 2 years. Old psu? Probably not worth keeping. The HP Pavillion 6535 specs at http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?cc=us&lc=en&dlc=en&docname=bph05116 say it has a 466 MHz Celeron processor. The old sound cards probably aren't worth keeping because new PCs likely have better onboard graphics, and the old cards won't be PCIe which is what most new desktops are using. An old psu isn't something I'd want to save because even though they don't have moving parts (except for the fan), they do age. Most of this older stuff would never be suitable for Windows 7 or 8, but if you're throwing together to give to a charity or the like, you might be get something working with a Linux OS like Ubuntu or Mint. ` Good luck.

Those old boards used the good kind of solder with real lead in it until it became unpopular with the environmental crowd. Sadly I'd say that the recommendation to give this stuff to charity isn't a good idea. You wind up handing over your disposal problem to then. I do some volunteer work for a small school and plenty of well meaning people have wanted to donate their old computers but we can't take them. Schools need to mimic what kids have at home and also can't afford to deal with troublesome PCs. I'm also doubtful that older hardware can still run newer versions of Linux. I've a P-4 mobile laptop that won't take Ubuntu 12x due to the processor's RAM limitations...something about PAE. It will run 10 and below. To the scrap heap is my suggestion. Good luck.

I recycle all the time and truly strip it down. I cut wire for copper, teardown HDs for aluminium and metals and I keep the magnets, all other drives get tossed for iron metal. Large plastic is trash canned. PSU are stripped for metals and copper wire, etc.. Now, if you want museum pieces that's what you have. HDs that old just aren't woth keeping unless *you* have a need for them. tada -----Willy
