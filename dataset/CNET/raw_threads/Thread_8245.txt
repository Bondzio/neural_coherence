Normally I run the one 20&quot; Dell LCD monitor that came with the system years ago. I recently acquired a friend's old KDS 17&quot; square LCD monitor and figured I would set up a dual monitor configuration. The 17&quot; KDS monitor has only a VGA cable running from it. The 20&quot; Dell monitor uses a DVI-D cable. The GTX+ card has two DVI-I slots, so to connect the VGA cable I bought a DVI-I (male) to VGA (female) adapter. When the DVI-D plug is in slot1 and the adapter plug is in slot2, the computer boots and displays on the Dell monitor only. Both the Nvidia control panel and Windows display settings recognize the KDS monitor, and when set up to run dual with extended screen, I can even drag my mouse or other program windows off screen as if it were functioning. However, the KDS monitor remains black and on standby as if there was no input to it (no signal). When the DVI-D plug is in slot2 and the adapter plug is in slot1, the computer boots but both monitors wremain black (both appear to be on standby and have no response). If I unplug the adapter plug, leave the DVI-D plug in slot2, and restart the PC, the Dell monitor displays at the boot as normal. Because of these odd responses, and because the computer is detecting the second monitor, I'm having a hard time believing it's simply a bad adapter (which I bought here , with all positive reviews). Any thoughts or ideas?

What you may have to do is to have this setup for you the first time. The old OS XP is getting to be more and more trouble as time passes so with those comments out of the way it may be time to not use any adapters but look again at if that output has the needed VGA signals. As you can research this, DVI-I does not mean it has the analog signals so all this could just mean that there is a single RAMDAC on that video card.
