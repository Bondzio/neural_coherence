1.1.1	What is it and how do u do it ?	Ques
1.1.2	Will my pc think it is 1 GHz ?	Ques
1.1.3	Is it dangerous ?	Ques
1.2.1	It 's usually OK , but never expect people to support your efforts since it can result in lost hard drive contents ( all ! )	St
1.2.2	or a burnt CPU or other components .	St
1.2.3	It is much like extreme sports .	St
1.2.4	Your choice .	St
1.2.5	Try http : //www.overclockers.com/ Bob	St
1.3.1	Since , you did n't mention diddy about your system it hard to fathom what you 're up against .	St
1.3.2	Let me point out , if you push it too hard , expect problems , throttle back until you reach a happy medium were all componets and such work at a & quot ; stable rate & quot ; .	St
1.3.3	Best , to check pc modders websites for tips/hints , etc .	St
1.3.4	on the topic .	St
1.3.5	My only warning , *make darn sure the system is well cooled and power supply can handle demands* .	St
1.3.6	Feliz Nuevo Ano -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	Would a user even notice any & quot ; extra speed & quot ; from their computer ?	Ques
1.5.1	My old Dual Pentium Pro 200 system actually ran great at 233 MHz on each CPU .	St
1.5.2	That 's 66 more MHz on 400 combined and it was a noticable step up .	St
1.5.3	But that was from the days where Intel and others left wide margins for timing and more .	St
1.5.4	Bob	St
1.6.1	Provided everything is cool and stable , whatever benefit is better than what it was before .	St
1.6.2	Whether you see it or not is n't by leaps and bounds , but there is some benefit .	St
1.6.3	To what extend relies on the componets involved and the cost to & quot ; life cycle & quot ; of those same componets .	St
1.6.4	You tweek abit and get alittle more than what you paid for .	St
1.6.5	For some that 's enough for others they 'll push it until it breaks and throttle back if they can .	St
1.6.6	I remember users tweeks to old 4.77mhz systems with resistors and cystals and what have you , so people are going to do it if it means alittle more pep out of the system .	St
1.6.7	The choice is up to the end user .	St
1.6.8	-- -- -Willy	St
1.7.1	What you need .	St
1.7.2	1 a chip that you can overclock .	St
1.7.3	2 a MB that will support your new setting .	St
1.7.4	Overclocking is changing the voltage and frequency of the components so you get a faster CPU .	St
1.7.5	More voltage means more heat .	St
1.7.6	Yes , you can melt the CPU or at least important parts of it .	St
1.7.7	Cooling and monitering of the CPU tempurature in critical .	St
1.7.8	There are a lot of forums that would discuss these issues .	St
1.7.9	But for the cost of a new MB and a hotter chip you can save yourself some work .	St
