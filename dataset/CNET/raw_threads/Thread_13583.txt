With G adapters and B devices, you will only achieve the lower speed of the two standards. In most home scenarios with a broadband throughput of 6 mbps max, this is of no issue. It becomes an issue during LAN transfers (transferring files for one PC to another). MIMO will give you more distance and a speed bump on the LAN, Internet will stay the same.
