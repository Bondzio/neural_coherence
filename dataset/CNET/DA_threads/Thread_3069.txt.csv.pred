1.2.1	The 5.8GHz should be unaffected by the 2.4GHz devices .	St
1.2.2	It may get flightly at some distance from the base , but in the same room should be fine .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	These phones should be fine .	St
1.3.2	I had a problem with 2.4 GHz phones causing my wireless connection to drop given they work at near identical frequency of the router .	St
1.3.3	Wireless network uses Netgear Rangemax and Netgear USB .	St
1.3.4	Even though computer signal was strong the 2.4 GHzphones would kick it out whenever a wireless 2.4 GHz was anwered .	St
1.3.5	It did n't matter if the phone was not even near the router or USB .	St
1.3.6	I have 4 wireless phones throughout the house now on 5.8 GHz including one near ( & lt ; 8 ft. ) to the router and another within a foot of the USB .	St
1.3.7	No problems at all now with phone interference either for the router or the phones .	St
1.3.8	I believe ( I may be wrong ) 5.8 GHz phones may have more range than other phones so your interference may relate to other phones in your area .	St
1.3.9	Jim	St
1.4.1	... that the 2.4GHz frequency band of wireless networking gear has ever caused problems for a cordless phone , only the other way around .	St
1.4.2	We frequently get the question of ''Why does my wireless connection to the internet disappear whenever I answer my ( 2.4GHz ) cordless phone , '' but I 've never seen asked ''Why does my cordless phone go dead/have burst of static whenever I send an email from my wireless laptop . ''	St
1.4.3	It seems whenever there is a conflict , the microwave ovens and cordless phones always win .	St
1.4.4	Adding to that , your problematic phone is a 5.8GHz model .	St
1.4.5	That 's a completely different frequency band .	St
1.4.6	If there is a radio signal conflict , it should be with a device on the same band , not the 2.4GHz band - unless there is a defect in the radio emitter of one or another specific device that is spilling a whole spectrum of garbage frequencies into the air , but that 's a different kettle of fish .	St
1.4.7	Shifting now to troubleshooting mode - what happens when you turn off your wifi equipment ( all of it - router and computer ( s ) ) ?	Ques
1.4.8	Do you still get the static on the phone ?	Ques
1.4.9	What happens if you put the 5.8GHz unit downstairs and the 2.4GHz unit upstairs ?	Ques
1.4.10	Do you still get the static ?	Ques
1.4.11	Can you take the problematic set to a friend 's house , plug it in there , and make a call ?	Ques
1.4.12	Is there still static ?	Ques
1.4.13	Just some ideas to narrow down whether the unit is bum , or the location you are using it in is bum .	St
1.4.14	I do n't think there is interference from your wifi , it is something else .	St
1.4.15	dw	St
1.5.1	I had just sent the following message to CNet , when I did a cordless phone search through CNet and found your answer .	St
1.5.2	You sound like you might know a thing or two about cordless phones .	St
1.5.3	The only additional information I can give you in addition to the following not is that I am currently using a 5.8 GHz cordless .	St
1.5.4	I STILL GET STATIC .	St
1.5.5	It is so annoying ! !	St
1.5.6	''Although it 's not really a computer or network question , I 'd like to know what your subscribers think the best cordless phone is .	St
1.5.7	I 've had bad luck and the expensive sets do n't seem to be any better than the cheap ones .	St
1.5.8	They all wind up having static breaking in on my conversations .	St
1.5.9	It 's very annoying .	Polite
1.5.10	I keep them charged up , should I be letting them run down ?	Sug
1.5.11	The only really good cordless phone set I have ever used belonged to a friend .	St
1.5.12	It was a Seimens .	St
1.5.13	By the time I could afford to get it ... I saved for quite a while ... they were no longer available anywhere .	St
1.5.14	Phones with cords do n't even seem to be much better .	St
1.5.15	''So , would you consider helping me out here ?	Ques
1.5.16	''Could you ask the readers what they think for me , please ?	Ques
1.5.17	''Or if you have some good info ... I need some .	St
1.5.18	''Thanks a million !	St
1.5.19	''Kitty Ichelson '' If this gets to you and you can give me some insight ... brands , prices , GHz 's , nothing seems to make a difference .	St
1.5.20	Except I never heard static on my friend 's phone , the Seimens and they ca n't be found anymore .	St
