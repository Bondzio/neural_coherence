My computer is Win XP SP3 with USB 2.0 ports. I have Norton Ghost v 15. I've researched and have seen both good and bad for both Seagate and WD drives. Realizing individuals wants/needs/opinions are specific to an individual, I would like some feedback on what people think of the above manufacturers and the various drives they produce. I'm leaning towards a Desktop external rather than a portable, just for the sake of the Desktop having a connection to a power supply that's not the computer. This drive would be used once a week, explicitly for backing up the internal drive. However, I am not adverse to purchasing 2 drives and doing a 'double' backup every week. Any comments are appreciated. Thanks

All three Seagate external drives I had failed within 9 months &amp; started behaving erratically well before that. By contrast, my WD replacements have given me no trouble at all.

Found on a the second trip I could not drag or copy anything off it. Had I/O error had it checked and told it was not going to work. My brother is advising me to get a 1t seagate passport as he thinks WD's are rubbish but I see the consensus is divided. I have been looking at the WD My Book Elite 1t but I am so confused what to get. I am not tech savvy just want to back pics and family history records. thanks appreciate any advise
