<s> I have a pretty new Westell 6100 DSL modem and it overheats it's not anywhere within a few feet of my computer, the only heat generating hardware near it is a router is there anything i should do to keep this thing cool enough to work? </s>
<s> Sounds defective to me. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I've thought about attaching a cpu fan to the modem or putting it inside my computer case to get the benifit of its fans, will either of these work? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> true, but do i really need to open the thing? </s>
<s> i was going to put it in an old power supply box with a fan in it </s>
<s> Or use of a teleport machine. </s>
<s> I wonder how you know it's heat related. </s>
<s> My di-524 would lock up and I suspected heat at first but some googles found it was bad firmware. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> i don't KNOW it's heat, but it can't be good that the thing runs hot enough to cook an egg, can it? </s>
<s> So we don't know if it's heat yet. </s>
<s> I'll repeat the story that my router locked up too, but new firmware saved it. </s>
<s> -&gt; To test your theory, you'll have to take a crack at cooling it. </s>
<s> Why not some small fan pointed at it? </s>
<s> you should buy a fan like a case fan for a computer and put one on or on the side of the modem. </s>
<s> it really works. </s>
