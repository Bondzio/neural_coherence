<s> How important is the performance of your computer's video card? </s>
<s> --It's one of the most important hardware components of my system. </s>
<s> (Why is that?) </s>
<s> --Very important. </s>
<s> (Why is that?) </s>
<s> --Somewhat important. </s>
<s> (Why is that?) </s>
<s> --Not important at all. </s>
<s> (Why not?) </s>
<s> --I don't understand the importance of my computer's video card. </s>
<s> I'm not a gamer and I don't even usually watch videos on my multimedia PC, so video performance is good to have but hardly essential for me. </s>
<s> It's a lot more important on my notebook, on which I do occasionally watch DVDs when traveling. </s>
<s> But, even then, it's a lot less important than CPU speed, RAM, and HDD capacity. </s>
<s> I like to edit video and especially with HDV I have to have a decent video card.I have an older pc (1.8 ghz)and couldn't even begin to edit HDV without it.It also gives me a much needed second monitor. </s>
<s> Really, the entire question is somewhat meaningless unless you specify what the computer is being used for. </s>
<s> Gamers need the fastest, most powerful card available. </s>
<s> Servers need only minimal capabilities. </s>
<s> Most people can get by very well with the Video built into the motherboard, or fairly low-end boards. </s>
<s> I do a little video editing and some fairly-sophisticated perl and java animations of my own designs, and do these with the built-in video card on my (2GB, Athlon X2) system. </s>
<s> I suspect, but don't really know,that the performance of both would be enhanced by a little better video card. </s>
<s> At heavy loads, the PC did not quite keep up with the animations till I added the second GB of memory, and I am thinking to go to even-more sophisticated animations in the future. </s>
<s> It's hard for me to understand why anyone except an extreme gamer would need more than a $100 video adapter. </s>
<s> This is somewhat of a silly question, because the results of this poll don't prove anything given that the &quot;computer&quot; isn't defined as to its kind or usage. </s>
<s> For a desktop PC being used to play video games, view and edit digital video, etc, most people would want the most powerful graphics card they could afford. </s>
<s> For a desktop PC being used to run business applications, a low-end graphics card--or even an integrated graphics chipset--would suffice. </s>
<s> And of course for a laptop, integrated chipset graphics are the way to go. </s>
<s> High-end graphics cards use a lot of power and generate a lot of heat, which would result in poor battery life, loud fan noise, and possible discomfort to the user. </s>
<s> Most people want a laptop primarily to run business applications, and would prefer long battery life and lower heat dissipation. </s>
<s> That is why the best quality laptops usually have very basic graphics capabilities. </s>
<s> It's one of the most important hardware components of my system because we can only see what is on our monitor not which electron is going where inside our CPU! </s>
<s> The question ask how important is &quot;your&quot; video card and not &quot;the&quot; video card. </s>
<s> This automatically implies that it's for your purposes and not just general ones. </s>
<s> Sorry, couldn't resist throwing a Bart Simpson quip with the use of double negative. </s>
<s> I was surprised that my answer was not listed as an actual option on the polls above. </s>
<s> A request to the CNET Administrators - When you put the poll in the forums for discussions, please also include the link to the actual poll. </s>
<s> I chose to receive plain text newsletters and I can't actually exercise my vote anywhere because the link is not provided either in the newsletter or here. </s>
<s> and will suffice with integrated. </s>
<s> Graphics cards are important for gamers and if you work with graphics/modelling/3d animation for a living. </s>
<s> No really - thanks! </s>
<s> I dissect media headlines all the time! </s>
<s> I think you have to specify what the laptop or desktop computer will be used for. </s>
<s> If you are going to use it for multimedia or games, obviously a video card with more power is necessary. </s>
<s> Now if youre just after the browsing, you can settle for less. </s>
<s> I voted somewhat important. </s>
<s> I don't play games or edit video so I don't need the fastest thing out there. </s>
<s> I like to watch movies on my PC so I need something a little faster than the cheapest. </s>
<s> And I don't like the video using my RAM either. </s>
<s> So I spend about $50.00 and for the most part I have been happy with what I get. </s>
