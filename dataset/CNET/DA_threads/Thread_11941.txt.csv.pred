1.1.1	Although not a newbie with computers generally , I 'm a total numptie when it comes to networking .	St
1.1.2	My son set up our home network of 4 PCs and 2 laptops ( OTT , or what ! )	St
1.1.3	and I came home when it was safe .	St
1.1.4	All the PCs are self-builds ( my son again ) with adequate RAM and storage .	St
1.1.5	One runs Vista , the rest , including the ICS host PC runs XP-ProSP2 .	St
1.1.6	What I want to do is set up an independent mini network with no Internet ( there is n't any where it will be used ) using just the two laptops .	St
1.1.7	Basically I want to move my liberally scattered data from my old , trojan-riddled laptop to my new one then reformat the old one for my wife to use .	St
1.1.8	I know I could do that here using the existing 'big ' network of which they are already a part but I 'm just too busy and there are too many distractions so I thought it would be a good idea to take just the laptops away with me at the weekend , set up a network , and do it there .	St
1.1.9	Both the laptops are wireless enabled , though I could always get a LAN cable to connect them directly if this is how it would work best ?	Ques
1.1.10	I also have a spare Linksys Wireless-G 2.4 GHz Access Point which I could take with me if it was needed .	St
1.1.11	I 'd appreciate any simply-worded help with the easiest and quickest way I could do this .	St
1.1.12	So far I 've tried standing the laptops next to each other and switching them on in the hope they would see each other and make friends automatically without any input from me , but both showed the No Networks Detected message in the tray .	St
1.1.13	I knew it could n't be that easy !	St
1.1.14	Many thanks .	Polite

1.3.2	A brief read looks as though it might be the answer to a maiden 's prayer .	St
