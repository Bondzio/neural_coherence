hi- i'm running a 2006 hp with xp.
i bought my daughter a game for it called zoo tycoon- the ultimate.
it installs alright, but then claims i need a graphics card.
it's not 3-d or anything fancy.
what kind of card do i need?
the ones at best buy are $100 and up.
can i get something cheaper?
also, how do i install it?
any help is so appreciated!
!
