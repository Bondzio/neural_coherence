if you have an AthlonXP or Sempron for Socket A (or Pentium 3) and are using a TIM (not a pad) ensure that the TIM is only the die (The reflective purple-ish thing in the middle of the chip) and not touching any of the bridges (basically if it's not isolated to that part, and it touches contacts on the chip it can cause issues)
