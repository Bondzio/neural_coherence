would suggest you avoid it.
in the early days of 802.11 (11mps), one manufacturers equipment would not work with another (or sometimes their own).
after a year or so, this stopped being an issue.
the same thing then happened with 802.11g (54mps).
many manufacturers launched equipment that was designed before the standard had been finalised, and so all worked slightly differently.
this has now mostly been solved.
802.11n (108mps) has not yet been finalised, which is why everything you see will be called pre-n. it means people are building to what they think the standard will be.
even if it all works now, it may not if ou try to upgrade other kit later.
also, you would need to upgrade your notebook card to see any advantage.
stick with 54mps, and whatever you pick make sure it has the wifi certified logo- it porves it's been independently tested to meet the specs.
if you do this, any manufacturer should be fine, and it comes down to personal preference of the interface personally, i use belkin and have not had any problems in the year i've been running.
