<s> 9watts (nominal) Motorola SB4200 I was looking into getting an uninterruptible power supply, and I was wondering about what I should get. </s>
<s> I was thinking of putting my computer, CRT monitor, Internet modem, and router on the UPS. </s>
<s> In addition, maybe I'd have it set so that the computer shuts down five minutes after the battery power kicks in, just in case it wasn't a 1 second power out. </s>
<s> If the powerout lasts longer, then the computer and monitor go off, and I have my modem and router plugged in. </s>
<s> From there, I could use a laptop to connect to the wireless. </s>
<s> So, besides the five minutes the computer & monitor are on, what do you think I should do to get something that will last the modem and router about twenty minutes? </s>
