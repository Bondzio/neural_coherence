hi thanks again, sorry for late reply.
um i always find it better to have double or triple confirmation because this whole process will be costy, with the console, dvi-d adaptor, and the games.
and yeah, thanks for that advice, probably won't be buying anymore in the future as i already have one thats hdcp now.
thanks once again.
is there a way to mark this as solved?
