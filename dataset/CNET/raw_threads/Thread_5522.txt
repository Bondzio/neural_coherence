I have just bought a Seagate 320GB Expansion portable drive as I couldn't get my hands on a WD portable soon enough for my needs, I have formatted that drive as OS Extended Journaled and all is fine, however when trying to use both Carbon Copy Cloner or Super Duper to clone my MyBook HD it tells me as it is formated as MS-DOS (Fat32) it will not run HFS+ files. I have done the old drag and drop of all my files/folders I wish to keep including system files such as autorun, documentation, memeo, recycled, system volume information etc which i don't know is necessary or not. My main problem is all the folders copy across fine by the look of things but I have 290.41GB on my WD MyBook and when copied over it is only showing 283.44 on my Seagate....I am wanting to re-format my MyBook to set up my time machine but don't want to do it until I am sure all of my files are copied over..... Can anybody help please? Many thanks for taking the time to read this. Cheers

FAT32's &quot;slack space&quot; or large clusters (sorry but I decline to write a dissertation on file systems) is assuredly larger and therefore I can safely bet that a FAT32 system would report more used space than HFS+ even if the same files were on each. To dissect this more we've need to spend a few weeks reading and learning about file systems but I hope the short answer works. Try the other way to compare. Let's say the old drive has 2,010 files. If the new drive has 2,010 files and the space used is that close, I bet we're done. Bob

I will give a couple of the options for file/folder size comparison a quick try just to be sure! Thanks again for your advice and help
