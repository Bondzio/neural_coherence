<s> Hi everyone, just want to thank everyone in advance for reading my post. </s>
<s> I'm considering buying a new hard drive and i have options of a hd with a 8 mb buffer and 16 mb buffer. </s>
<s> The price difference isn't that large BUT if the 16 doesn't perform that much better than the 8, I'm gonna get the 8. </s>
<s> Can someone give me a quick and dirty regarding the differences in performance between these two options? </s>
<s> If the performance difference is depenedent on components in my computer, please let me know what those dependencies are. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Let's say we have an OS with a better disk cache system. </s>
<s> This renders this drive cache not so big a deal. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Does Windows XP have a good file system cache? </s>
<s> Thanks for your help </s>
<s> XP, Windows 2000, Linux all have pretty good disk cache systems. </s>
<s> If I look at my system, it's 283 megabytes of disk cache which the difference of that 2, 8 or 16 MB on the disk drive would not make much difference. </s>
<s> www.tomshardware.com may have some benchmarks if you want to look further. </s>
<s> The RPMs seem to be what you can't skimp on. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> last thing i promise =). </s>
<s> Any idea on how to check how much disk cache i have like you did? </s>
<s> And i'm assuming the amount that you have 283, is a pretty good set up to not really need the 16mb cache from the HD. </s>
<s> Thanks!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Look at the System Cache entry. </s>
<s> Cheers, Bob </s>
<s> Thanks so much for your help. </s>
<s> I think i'm good with the 8MB buffer HD. </s>
<s> Take it easy! </s>
