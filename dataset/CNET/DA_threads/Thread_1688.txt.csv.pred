1.1.8	Can someone recommend a little cheap , free utility like some sort of keep alive to ping something every once in a while ?	Sug
1.2.1	if so , and you have it set to automatically lock after a set time or when the screen saver activates , then you will see a gold or red lock at the bottom , next to clock .	Sug
1.2.2	If you right click , then click on engage internet lock or stop all internet activity , it still might not connect .	St
1.2.3	Try turning off the radio and wait about 10 seconds then enable the radio .	St

1.4.4	Usually a second attempt will get on line , but sometimes not .	St
1.4.5	It 's all so random other than the fact that after it sits , it wo n't get on line .	St

1.6.2	This was wife 's PC and had a 20 Gig HD .	St
1.6.3	Because she was saving a lot of music for her iPod , I cloned an 80 Gig drive using MaxBlast .	St
1.6.4	The clone went perfectly and have had zero problems .	St

1.6.13	Unless someone can point me to a keep alive utility .	St

1.10.1	It 's my web server for my site , it 's on 24/7 .	St
1.10.2	I do n't surf often , just for updates and such .	St
1.10.3	But it 's a pain to reboot whenever I need to update XP and my Anti-Parasite Suite .	St
