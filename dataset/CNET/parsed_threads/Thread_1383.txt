<s> Recently I moved into my new student appartment and the only internet that was available was wireless. </s>
<s> I have a wireless BT hub at the only port in the house and then a linksys router by my PC. </s>
<s> By flashing the linksys router I was able to turn it into a receiver and so it goes straight into my network port in the back of my PC. </s>
<s> Out of 100 pings to the router from my PC I get about 6-10 which are in the range of 70-130ms. </s>
<s> The rest are either 1ms (mass majority) and 2ms. </s>
<s> This is causing me problems ingame as I get about 3-6 ping spikes a minute which interupts my play. </s>
<s> Anyone who can help? </s>
<s> I'm using WEP encrpytion, and the linksys model is a WRT54GL. </s>
<s> Sorry but no need to write again that WEP is dead and with a kiddie script you can be smacked down. </s>
<s> Move the security up one notch to WPA and read this forum's sticky. </s>
<s> Again, I must be harsh on this. </s>
<s> I will not discuss WEP as it is dead. </s>

<s> That's a bit annoying really as I tried WPA and the latency was horrible (60-180ms) between the router and receiver... WEP seemed the fastest. </s>
<s> Despite the poor security. </s>
<s> However I always use our forum sticky settings. </s>
<s> Tell if you did something other than the forum sticky settings. </s>
<s> Again, WEP is not a solution as the kiddie tools swat the connection down and more. </s>
<s> But that's been covered enough times. </s>
