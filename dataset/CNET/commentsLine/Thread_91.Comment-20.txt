this is a last ditch effort to try to get the drive spinning to copy the data.
the reason behind this is the principle of heat contracts and cold expands.
if the mechanism inside the dirve is jammed this could unjam it.
it won't work if you have a fry circuit or crash heads on the platter or the mechanism is to far gone for this to work.
