so is it worth the trouble of going p4?
i don't have the money to get a new pc.
i've already upgraded to 512 ram, bought a new dvd burner, 160mb external hd, and 2.0 usb pci card.
so i'm pretty much at a point of no turning back to buy a new pc.
if i could upgrade my processor i'd be good for a long time and have saved some cash.
so mother board, power supply and the processor i understand, but you say i need a new tower case?
that's sound like some work transfering everything over, or did i misunderstand.
