1.1.1	We have a cable modem (roadrunner service) and can have up to 5 additional connections.	St
1.1.2	We tried a wireless router (asante friendlynet FR1104-G), but the signal strength seems only strong enough to reach one floor up or down from the router location.	St
1.1.3	The floors are concrete, and the walls are concrete/brick with metal frames.	St
1.1.4	Hardwiring from modem to other floors is a very last (and expensive) option.	St
1.1.5	Any other solutions?	St
1.2.1	someone wanted to know if they could string a Cat5 cable down the outside of a concrete building to extend their networks reach.	St
1.2.2	The concensus was positive.	St
