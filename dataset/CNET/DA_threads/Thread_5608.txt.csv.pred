St
1.3.4	This is about what our budget will allow .	St
1.3.5	Of course , you could always go with a less expensive case in order to get more memory , better gpu , or better cpu .	St
1.3.6	Good luck .	Polite
1.4.1	that 's a good setup except it looks like you 're sticking with on-board sound .	St
1.4.2	you can find an x-fi gamer for about $ 40 and it will give you better sound quality and higher framerates when compared to integrated sound .	St
1.4.3	http : //www.anandtech.com/mb/showdoc.aspx ? i=2964 & p=12 http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16829102016	Ques

1.6.1	http : //sourcedesktop.com/ It is pretty close to what you want .	St
1.6.2	and about $ 1900 .	St
1.7.1	replaced the E6600 with an E6750 and kicked up that psu , that would be pretty good right there .	St

1.9.1	Firstly , its impossible to build a computer to pre-empt unreleased games Secondly , DirectX 10 was made obslete at the announcement/release of DirectX 10.1 , not to mention that game development for the PC has become questionable at best ( due to the popularity and equality of consoles , contrasted to the massive performance delta between the average PC and the performance PC ) .	St
1.9.2	Thirdly , nVidia and ATi are planning to release new graphics processors in about 5 or 6 months , replacing GeForce 8 and Radeon HD 2xxx .	St
1.9.3	Also , theres no real advantage to having a Creative card ( do n't really care what anand says ) over integrated audio , in regards to quality , performance , etc	St
