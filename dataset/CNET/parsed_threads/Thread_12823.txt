<s> I have a sony vaio laptop computer running windows vista home premium service pack 2. it has two physical hard drives that are identical (toshiba mk1637gsx). </s>
<s> the primary drive is almost full. </s>
<s> I would like to merge the two physical drives into one without reformating my primary drive to create more space for programs. </s>
<s> Is this possible? </s>
<s> If so please give me instructions on how to merge the drives into one. </s>
<s> Your help in this matter would be much appreciated. </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> No, that can't be done in Vista. </s>
<s> But you can move a great deal of the content of the c:-drive (your Documents folder and everything it contains and the other subfolders of the rootfolder you created yourself) to the d:-drive and start using that. </s>
<s> Windows and Users (except for the Documents part) can't be moved. </s>
<s> Program Files can't be moved, but you can install most (not all!) </s>
<s> programs onto the d:-drive also. </s>
<s> To move your Documents folder, right click and find the Move command in it's properties. </s>

<s> I have already moved my data and documents to an external drive. </s>
<s> Since it is not possible with vista, is it possible with windows 7 pro? </s>
<s> When it comes time to restore the machine they tend to recreate the same setup. </s>
<s> As there are TWO PHYSICAL DRIVES there is no other way than to RAID the two but unless you are comfortable with this I feel you should use the other drive for some files and keep the C drive tidy. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Certainly in Windows 7 (and possibly in Vista also, although I've never done it), you can use junction points. </s>
<s> Then that whole d:-drive becomes a folder in the c:-drive. </s>
<s> I'll leave it to you to research the details. </s>
<s> Did they ever tell you that external drives are slow and unreliable? </s>
<s> Only store documents on them if you either have a good backup or don't mind losing them. </s>
