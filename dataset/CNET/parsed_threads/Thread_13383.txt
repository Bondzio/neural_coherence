<s> Hello, Hoping someone can help here because I definitely can't afford pro data retrieval. </s>
<s> Have an ext. </s>
<s> HD I sadly dropped a while back. </s>
<s> Ever since, it's been fading. </s>
<s> Today when I turn it on it sounds like it's spinning louder and faster than it should. </s>
<s> The files appear for a few seconds and I can click through just a folder or two before it freezes and a message box says I 'need to format' or something very close about formatting. </s>
<s> Have lots of files on it. </s>
<s> Anything I can do? </s>
<s> I'll gladly provide any more info that might help, and any suggestions will be tremendously appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks so much! </s>

<s> Get the disk out off the enclosure and see if it works in a new enclosure. </s>
<s> If you're lucky: it works. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> If you aren't lucky (which is the most likely situation): try the usual DIY data recovery programs from http://forums.cnet.com/7723-7588_102-354911.html . </s>
<s> This might get your data back on your internal hard drive. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> If you still aren't lucky: let it do by a professional data recovery company or accept the data is lost. </s>
<s> Your choice. </s>
<s> PS. </s>
<s> Why don't you have a backup copy of that data? </s>
<s> Not making a backup means &quot;I don't mind to lose it&quot;. </s>
<s> So why mind now? </s>

<s> Sadly, because you dropped the ext. </s>
<s> HD there is very probable physical damage. </s>
<s> Do what Kees suggests and go at it. </s>
<s> However, full success is limited to the damage caused. </s>
<s> So, don't expect a too happy outcome just be happy with what you can get. </s>
<s> Plus, continued operation and trying to access *all* files will touch everything and with physical damage produce more damage accessing everything as all areas become touched. </s>
<s> Once you got everything you can, see if warranty applies and use it. </s>
<s> FYI- As always, learn from this lesson, ext. </s>
<s> HDs aren't meant for permanent storage. </s>
<s> Critical files should be better stored on quality discs of CD/DVD/BD. </s>
<s> The ext. </s>
<s> HD should be thought of as working temporary storage. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I just look at the inside of one of those thing (my brother-in-law dropped it). </s>
<s> Good thing it was only movie videos. </s>
<s> I was going to swap the storage plats but after looking at how it was put together I decided it was a total loss. </s>
