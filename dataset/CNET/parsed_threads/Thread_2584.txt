<s> These all use uses an intergrated video thingy, and BF2 wants 256MB of RAM on a seperate video card to run. </s>
<s> For gaming, I would recommend a system that has a dedicated video card (not integrated and no shared memory). </s>
<s> ...or add an upgrade video card with dedicated video memory to an existing system. </s>
<s> This often requires an upgrade to the PSU as well. </s>
<s> so whichever monitor u want...or the 2nd to the last one the a1350n...unless u want the tv tuner which would be the last one then. </s>
<s> i agree with video card upgrade needed for any of them. </s>
<s> imo...i would suggest the emachines t6216, athlon 64 3200+, 512mb ram, win. </s>
<s> xp home. </s>
<s> upgrade to 1gb of corsair value ram 70 dollars, put in better psu 80 dollars, and 6800gs 160 dollars. </s>
<s> to total of around 800-900 dollars. </s>
<s> You're looking at a wide range of PCs including media center PCs. </s>
<s> You should decide the top 3 things you want your PC to do, then pick a PC that's good at those things. </s>
<s> For instance, don't spend the extra cash on a media center PC unless you want it to be your media center and you'll be watching TV/movies, timeshifting TV, recording TV/DVDs, and listening to music on it all the time. </s>
<s> A regular PC can do these things with a few upgrades, but if you want to put a PC in your living room to do these things often, then get a media center PC. </s>
<s> If your top 3 things you want to do are &quot;play the sims&quot;, &quot;surf the web&quot;, and &quot;download music&quot;, then just get an inexpensive PC. </s>
<s> If you're top three things are &quot;play battlefield2&quot;, &quot;convert DVDs to DivX&quot;, and &quot;edit videos&quot;, then get a PC with an AMD X2 or P4-D and a fat video card like an ati X1800 or geforced 7800. </s>
<s> One thing to remember is that for gaming a RAM above 1 GB and a PCI-e GRAPHIC CARD and AMD 4000+ processor </s>
<s> I just upgraded from 1gb to 2 gb of RAM and BF2 runs much smoother, even playable on my crappy 128MB RAM 9800 pro. </s>
<s> Ever considered building it yourself? </s>
