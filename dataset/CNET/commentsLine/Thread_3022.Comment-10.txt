you wrote that the video appeared on the new radeon card so we have no reason to &quot;check&quot; the bios.
as i previously wrote, your selection of card and machine is not assured to work.
you can read many horror stories about it, but i have supplied what i do to get the ones that will work to install.
if it doesn't, then you won't see any magic fix from me.
