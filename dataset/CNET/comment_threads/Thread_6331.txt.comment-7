OK, so having the proper expansion slot is only part of the compatibility concern.
I see your point too regarding the 7 series.
I have a little extra money, so I don't mind paying in the 200-250 range, was thinking that when I do get a newer computer, I would be able to transfer the card I buy now into the newer one.
Was looking around in shops near me and unfortunately not many carry the 7xxx's that would be better than the 8600 GTS (which is the card I was originally going for).
Hence I guess I'll probably get the 8600GTS.
Anyway, thanks for your help.
