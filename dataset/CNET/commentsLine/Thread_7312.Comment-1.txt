its one run, from a to b about 150 feet.
at the termination is the problem.
i will describe the run.
it starts at the router (a), then goes to a wall jack (1), then from the wall jack to a switch (2), from the switch to a rj45 connector to another switch (3) from that switch to a wall jack (4), here lies the problem, after checking the cable for connection, everything is green up to the last wall jack (4), i added another short cat5 cable to go to the computer and i checked the cable for green.
everything is great.
however, when connected to the computer it did not work.
now, first thing i did was recheck my lines again and again, all good.
the second thing was to bypass each section starting at the end (b).
so, i tried other cables with no luck, then i ran a cable from switch 3 directly to the computer and it worked.
my thought was something wrong with the last part of the run.
i rechecked and redid the line, no luck.
i disconnected at (b) the wall jack.
i connected an rj45 to it instead, retested and ok. i then put on a coupler to extend the reach to the computer, still did not work.
the coupler is good and works great.
so my next step was to connect the computer directly to the last rj45 at the wall and see what happens.
it works!!!!!
so, at the termination end, no matter if it is a wall jack or an rj45, it won't allow me to add another cable from the 45 or the wall jack.
however, i was able to hook up another switch to the end point and connect a cable from the switch to the computer.
no problems at all.
so, what is wrong, does anyone have any idea.
all the cables are working the connections are good, i just cannot go from the wall jack to the computer.
