1.1.1	I'm trying to find somewhere that sells a small power supply as I need a replacement for the PSU in a MEGA 180 PC (Made by MSI).	St
1.1.2	http://www.msi.com.tw/program/produc...il.php?UID=546 The PSU is a FSP250-60MS.	St
1.1.3	These look like a special made for MSI by FSP However FSP do a FSP275-50BW http://www.fsp-group.com.tw/english/...d=56&proid=395, which looks like it'll probably do the job but I can't find one anywhere and FSP and MSI don't seem to want to reply to any of my mail/posts.	St
1.1.4	Has anyone found anything else that'll fit this type of PC?	St
1.1.5	Dimensions need to be around 140 x 105 x85mm which is quite a bit smaller than most standard XT PSUs.	St
1.2.1	Try PC POWER AND COOLING as well as MSI for a replacement.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	Doh!	St
1.3.2	PC description is at: http://www.msi.com.tw/program/products/slim_pc/slm/pro_slm_detail.php?UID=546 Possible replacement PSU is at: http://www.fsp-group.com.tw/english/1_product/2_detail.asp?mainid=1&fid=56&proid=395 Thanks for pointing that out.	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	I agree, but its the closest I've found so far.	St
1.5.2	I would have thought that there must be a lot of these type of compact PCs on the market.	St
1.5.3	Sureley there must be some sort of alternative.	St
1.6.1	If PC POWER AND COOLING doesn't have it, contact the place that sells these boxes.	St
1.6.2	MSI should sell spares.	Sug
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	There are a bunch of FSP250-60/61s for about $30 shipped (Item #6853658293 includes 2 of them for that price)!	St
1.7.2	Take a $30 chance.	St
1.8.1	NIL	St
1.9.1	Aren't they always out of warranty when they go wrong!	St
1.9.2	This one still works but cuts out after a couple of hours.	St
1.9.3	The motherboard still thinks it's switched on.	St
1.9.4	It can't be heat as I've run it with the lid off.	St
1.9.5	Might be something obvious but don't fancy delving into switchmode PSUs.	St
1.10.1	Unfortunately I'm in the UK.	St
1.10.2	There have been a few FSP250s on Ebay but nothing of the same size, ie.	St
1.10.3	140 x 100 x 85.	St
1.11.1	I wonder if many of the FSP250s have the same guts?	St
1.11.2	I could try a PSU transplant!	Sug
1.12.1	shipped to the UK for $26 (USD).	St
1.12.2	it seems to be long and narrow... maybe the seller has the actual dimensions are or more pics.	St
1.12.3	good luck on your search.	Polite
1.13.1	One of thje critical dimensions is the depth.	St
1.13.2	It has to be 80mm or less as the back of the case to the processor heatsink is 80mm.	St
1.13.3	The GTA PSU is 86mm.	St
1.13.4	It looks like I'll have to try and get one from MSI.	St
1.13.5	Thanks for the help though.	Ques
1.13.6	I'll start polling the ebay.com as well as ebay.co.uk, might turn up something.	St
