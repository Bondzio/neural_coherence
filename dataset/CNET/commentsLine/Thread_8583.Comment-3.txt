well, i just updated the motherboard drivers, still no change.
here's all my information that i do have.
(sorry that i didn't include it before) operating system: windows xp: home edition ram: 2542 mb processor: intel(r)pentium(r) 4 cpu 3.00ghz (w cpus) system model: d65gbh (it's a custom computer put together at the store) also just discovered it can't detect the sound card either.
or the ethernet controller so it's most definitely a driver problem
