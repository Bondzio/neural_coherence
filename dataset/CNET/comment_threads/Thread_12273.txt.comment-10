These boards have been out of production for a very long time.
In fact, in a move to reduce costs that part is usually soldered in.
I can't answer if you will find the part and have the tools and skills to replace it.
If there is a chance, close JP11 and then remove JP11's jumper.
Maybe it will reset and work for a bit longer.
I don't see the old option of another battery to stand in.
