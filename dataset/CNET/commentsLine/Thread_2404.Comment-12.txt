&gt;&gt;does anyone know of someone who regularly does what i want?
yup, i do it all the time.
with both my thinkpad and my role-ur_own athlon.
i simply choose the hard drive to boot with in the bios setup.
you say you have the choice of booting 'a', 'c' or 'd'.
'd' should be your hd1, second hard drive.
so... try 'd' and see what happens.
if you have two hard drives on an ide cable with the proper jumper for master and slave (or cable select) the bios will see both hard drives 'c' will be hd0 (master) and 'd' will be hd1 (slave).
if the bios sees your cd drive as 'd' when you have two hard drives physically installed in the pc... they are not cabled or jumpered properly.
