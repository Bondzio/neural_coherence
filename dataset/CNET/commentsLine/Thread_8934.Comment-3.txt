is the ipad really the closest i can get to what i'm looking for?
the keyboard functionality is a nice extra but like i said not 100% necessary and with the extra cost and the pita of using itunes i'm not sure if that would be the right choice.
the reason i'd like it to be able to charge from the usb port is that i have a couple different usb battery powered chargers that i'm hoping to use to extend the battery life with does the ipad have a sd card slot?
