The last few months when I turn it on it is really dark for about 1-2 minutes, then it's normal. Now the last few days when I turn it on, it flickers for a few minutes, then it is normal again. It's fine after it seems to warm up(?) if that makes sense. I read somewhere the backlight(?) may be going out. What is this and can I replace it myself? Or is it best to say bye-bye to the monitor? What else could it be? It does the same on my other computer, so I know it's a problem with the monitor. Thanks for any advice.
