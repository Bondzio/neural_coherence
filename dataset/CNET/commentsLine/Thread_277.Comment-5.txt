bought a cd lens cleaner from radioshack.
inserted into drive but couldn't run it.
don't have nt/2000/xp cd to boot.
have winme.
gateway sent 3 restoration disks with system.
any of these?
i tried disc 1 (hardware drivers, partial backup of applications, nt4.0 driver locator utility) in the drive.
it opened once, but then i couldn't get it to open again.
i can get it in the system through the external cdrw.
would it help to run the restoration?
if drive is no good, why do dvds work fine?
