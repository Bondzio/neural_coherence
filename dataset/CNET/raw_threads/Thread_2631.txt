It has been displaying a message that says no color supply. I have reset the printer, removed the battery for about 6 hours, replaced the cartridges, and sprayed electronic cleaner. Still nothing. Have any suggestions???

Since you have decided to attempt repair you should already be in the thick of it and scouring the mainboard for this. If not, why not? Bob
