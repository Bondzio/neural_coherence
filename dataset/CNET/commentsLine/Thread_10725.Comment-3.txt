good day all, thank you very much for taking the time to read my post if you did.
i have solved my issue.
in the event that other might benefit from the solution i found, here it is.
after trying a whole lot of googled suggestions with luck, this evening i started going through the wd knowledge base, long story short i found a fellow with a similiar issue, he apparently was on the phone for about 2 hours with a microsoft tech, i guess after sorting through/verifying some other settings the tech had the guy to the properties of his network adapter and verify he had the client for microsoft networks client installed, he did not, once he added this client and with some other settings he was able to do what he wanted to do, so i went into my network adapter properties and sure enough it was not there, i installed the client and a little while later everything worked the way i wanted it to.
who knew lol.
hope this helps others.
