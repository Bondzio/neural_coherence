<s> I bought a Belkin G Wireless Router, and a Belkin 54G Wireless USB Network Adapter. </s>
<s> I got everything installed. </s>
<s> The desktop computer wired to the router and modem is in a different room from the wireless desktop, but still only about 30 feet away. </s>
<s> My wireless desktop is picking up the network with Windows default stuff, but not with my Belkin software, which doesn't matter to me. </s>
<s> But, when I type in the Net Key and try to connect, it waits a couple seconds and then tells me about there being available networks again, but doesn't connect me. </s>
<s> Could this be an interference issue? </s>
<s> It's only like 30 feet away. </s>
<s> Anyway, any help is appreciated. </s>
<s> Check the second post of our forum sticky. </s>
<s> Anything different? </s>
