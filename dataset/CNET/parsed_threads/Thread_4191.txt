<s> I have a Pentium 4 HT 2.80Ghz LGA775 (Pretty much a brand new CPU) Socket, With a PCI-E card. </s>
<s> (Nvidia 9400GT) and I need a new motherboard. </s>
<s> I don't want to have to buy ALL new parts. </s>
<s> here is the motherboard in question: http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3991769&CatId=1533 And I have G.Skill DDR2 PC2-4200 I was wondering if my RAM Will work with the motherboard in the link? </s>
<s> It seems to be the best board in question for it's price. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> have ? </s>
<s> There's somewhere between 20 and 40. http://processorfinder.intel.com/List.aspx?ProcFam=483 VAPCMD </s>
<s> I have this one http://processorfinder.intel.com/details.aspx?sSpec=SL8HX I'm wanting to find a motherboarc compatible with this CPU, my G.Skill DDR2 PC2-4200 RAM with sata, and a PCI-E 16x slot </s>
<s> Any ram speed (in your case 4200) lower than the motherboard bus speed (&gt;4200 which happens to be DDR2 667 vs your DDR2 533) is going to create instability, lots of crashing is going to happen... it's like your ram a souped-up car, running on a 1 lane street (the motherboard) which will mean frequent shutdown, BSOD, etc.. </s>
<s> I tried running slower ram on faster bus speed board, never realising it until I've checked the specs of the board minimum bus speed for ram, and when I took out the slower ram, the system became stable... here's the link regarding RAM and their bus/ i/o speed so you'll know which ram model to lookout for http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR2_SDRAM </s>
<s> That looks like what you might recycle out of your common Dell, HP or other name desktop. </s>
<s> When changing the motherboard from a name brand the OS license fails on the new board. </s>
<s> Is that an issue here? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> news is, the RAM required DDR2-800 is faster than what you have and it's inexpensive. </s>
<s> Get a kit with 2 DIMMs 1GB each to take advantage of dual channel memory architecture. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> slow ram does not cause memory issues because the motherboard chooses the proper divider. </s>
<s> it will autoconfigure itself for any standard speed: ddr2-533, ddr2-667, ddr2-800 and some handle ddr2-1066. </s>
<s> slower ram can result in a more stable system since it doesn't push the mch hardware to its limit. </s>
<s> this is why many small business servers still come with ddr2-667 as the base memory option. </s>
<s> It came out of a Dell computer that the motherboard died on. </s>
<s> I don't have alot of money, and all the RAM, Video card and harddrives were pur chased just last year to upgrade the Dell. </s>
<s> now I'd like to swap over the parts into a new board and in a new case so it's no longer dell. </s>
<s> If yours has a DVD drive you could look at Windows 7 RC to run until next year for free. </s>
<s> But don't count on Windows that came with the Dell to run. </s>
<s> It might, it might not and we don't have a leg to stand on to demand a new license. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'm just trying to replace the motherboard using the existing parts I have, The CPU, RAM, Video card, Hard drive, PSU, etc. </s>
<s> All I need is the motherboard, I have everything else. </s>
<s> I have a copy of XP, And Vista. </s>
<s> tl;dr. Dell motherboard died, Has all new parts, Want to use parts out of the Dell (which aren't Dell Branded) Need motherboard compatable with a Intel Pentium 4 2.80Ghz Hyper threading Socket LGA 775, 04A CPU. </s>
<s> I have PC2- DDR2-4200 RAM. </s>
<s> PCI-E express video card, Sata harddrive. </s>
<s> I know many get confused over OEM, Dell, HP and the Windows license. </s>
<s> Let's just say it's onerous. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yes, All the parts came out of a Dell. </s>
<s> I just want a motherboard to use with the existing parts. </s>
<s> My Pentium Four Hyper-threading LGA-775 O4A CPU, With my G.Skill DDR-4200 RAM. </s>
<s> 2 x 1gb. </s>
<s> My 9400Gt 512mb PCI-E card. </s>
<s> That's all I ask. </s>
<s> Will the motherboard I posted work with it? </s>
<s> Some may insist this means it's like a car. </s>
<s> You change the tire and then get in and drive off. </s>
<s> In this case it's not simple. </s>
<s> You change the motherboard and while it does work the OS will not run. </s>
<s> Your PC will not work as before. </s>
<s> Windows is not running. </s>
<s> The computer works but will likely need a fresh install of Windows but that OEM Windows may fail. </s>
<s> I hope you see the problem. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I've got the disk to fixed that. </s>
<s> I have a Store-bought copy of XP and Vista. </s>
<s> While in theory it will work, in reality there is always something. </s>
<s> It looks like you'll be OK but will you be upset if there is some issue? </s>
