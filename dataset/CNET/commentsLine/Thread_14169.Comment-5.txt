that wasnt very kind...anyways, my question is about how i can speed up a mac that is clearly slower.
your mac may not be slow, but you probably know more about how to alleviate those symptoms than i do.
therefore, i ask those that would kindly point me in the right direction... as for those that can help me, what causes them to be slow in the first place?
i know much more about pc's and i am able to tweak a pc with various tools and cleaners to get it optimal.
i do not know of many ways to speed up a mac and the like.
if anyone knows more on this subject, i would greatly appreciate help and not criticism on a subject that i am clearly trying to find the answer for.
thanks in advance for your advise!
