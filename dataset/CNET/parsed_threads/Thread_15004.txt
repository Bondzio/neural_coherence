<s> Hi i use a P4 2.4GHZ intel original on a 865GBF motherboard.I have a 300watts powersupply a 160gb SATA HDD and a 256 Mb DDR RAM (One stick).the problem is that my system restarts after 5 to 10 mins when ever i switch it on.And once is restarts it wont show any display & there is no activity of HDD and its a hectic job to get it started.And once it gets started then it wont get restarted for a very long time.I came to know from some one that its a processor overheating issue.So to solve it i brought a new fan(Box Fan) a new sink and a collent cream...This helped but only for 5 days or so and then again it started to restart like usual.I have been using this system for the past 5 years and i clean it up once a week i also keep my CPU casing open for full ventalation but its still no help...Any one with some idea that could help... </s>
