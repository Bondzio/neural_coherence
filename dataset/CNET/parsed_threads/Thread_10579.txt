<s> Hi, We can't keep the wireless connection working on this PC: HP m1270n Windows XP Sp2 IE6 sp2 LAN - Linksys Wireless-B PCI Adapter WMP11 ISP - Grapevine Connection status shows limited or no connectivity. </s>
<s> This is the main PC: HP m11297c Windows XP Sp2 IE6 sp2 LAN - Linksys Router 802.11b SBC DSL - SpeedStream 5360 ISP - SBC Yahoo I went to Linksys' site and used their quick connect program and got it working but it loses it again. </s>
<s> Have done this several times. </s>
<s> If I use Linksys program should I disable the Windows wireless program? </s>
<s> There seems to be a conflict between them, maybe? </s>
<s> Or is it better to use one over the other? </s>
<s> Please keep in mind that I'm a novice at this but will follow instructions. </s>
<s> If I left anything out let me know. </s>

<s> but your lost connections can be due to outdated firmware for your various devices. </s>
<s> Hop on over to Linksys for the latest. </s>
<s> I should have mentioned we've only had these PCs about a month. </s>
<s> I also need to make a correction on the number for the network adapter, the tech put in WMP55AG but it is still supposed to work this router. </s>
<s> I went to Linksys and downloaded the driver update utility. </s>
<s> It won't run when I click setup. </s>
<s> Error says ''Cannot open file .\License.rtf'' There is a file ''License.rtf'' but I don't know where the ''.\'' came from. </s>
<s> And if I click ''License.rtf'' it opens so don't know why set up can't open it. </s>
<s> Have found and disabled 'Wireless Zero Configuration'. </s>
<s> Will let you know how it goes tomorrow. </s>
<s> Thank you so much for responding. </s>

<s> for the product. </s>
<s> Try clicking on the Setup icon. </s>
<s> Michael, I had clicked Setup first that is how I got the message that it couldn't open the RTF file. </s>
<s> The good news is that we are connection sharing again. </s>
<s> Don't know for how long because I went through all the same steps over and over and it just started working. </s>
<s> I did go in and disable the Windows Zero manager right after you said not to use both. </s>
<s> Maybe next time I'll enable it and try just depending on it to fix it. </s>
<s> Thank you for your help. </s>
