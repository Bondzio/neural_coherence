<s> I have a new Dell 4600 computer with the SoundMax integrated audio card, ADI 198x. </s>
<s> While attempting to upgrade to a Soundblaster card the sound devices got switched to the soundblaster devices. </s>
<s> Due to hardware conflicts I had to uninstall the software and remove the soundblaster card. </s>
<s> When the computer rebooted, and identified the integrated soundcard all drivers were installed. </s>
<s> However, none of the devices was picked up in the active device boxes on the sounds and audio devices menus in my control panel. </s>
<s> The volume tab shows &quot;no audio device&quot;. </s>
<s> The audio and voice tabs show &quot;no devices&quot; in the drop down menus, and all those sections are grayed out so they can't be changed. </s>
<s> But, on the hardware tap all the audio components show as working properly, and enabled, but not activated. </s>
<s> I have downloaded and zapped the chipset, refreshed the Windows XP operating system, installed the updated driver for the audio card, and have been on the phone, and in email contact with Dell Tech Support for almost a week. </s>
<s> Nobody seems to have the slightest idea how to restore the volume control mixer so that it's functional, and nobody seems to know how to restore the system to factory defaults. </s>
<s> I'd appreciate any help. </s>
<s> I read through this and see no hardware issue. </s>
<s> Maybe drivers or how to install the OS from scratch. </s>
<s> You also didn't reveal if you were ready to return the machine to its factory setup which Dell will know how to guide you. </s>
<s> As to the volume control, you may be nonplused to find out that if system restore fails or other items fail that your average support will have you wipe the disk and reinstall from scatch. </s>
<s> This does work, but you didn't reveal if you can't do this. </s>
<s> In closing, Microsoft doesn't make an easy to repair silly things OS. </s>
<s> Sometimes you get to re-install the OS when it gets too far off the support map. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> I didn't mention the Control Panel item to show volume control since after a week with Dell, they already noted that. </s>
<s> Or did they? </s>
<s> Your post didn't reveal that dialogue. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> What does it show in Device Manager, I don't notice you mentioning anything about those settings under Control Panel/System/Hardware. </s>
<s> Does everything show it is operating normally in there? </s>
<s> You didn't go into the CMOS setup and disable the sound card when you tried to use the Soundblaster, did you? </s>
<s> Was it re-enabled? </s>
<s> Did you download and install the Soundmax driver that is found at the Dell web site for your model of system? </s>
