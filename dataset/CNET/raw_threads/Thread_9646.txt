I went back and noticed that I hadn't pushed the little suckers in all the way (even though I thought I had), so I pushed them in with more force (more than I had expected) and rebooted. It could be that one of your might have the same problem. If that's not it, I've read that sometimes there's a BIOS setting you have to tweak, although I've never personally seen it. Since you say it's a new computer, I don't suppose there's a 4 GB hardware limit, but I'd check that just to be sure. Good luck.

Proffitt	12/15/12 10:24 AM	1.35556704E12	Read this recent discussion.	http://forums.cnet.com/7723-6122_102-580216/additional-memory-installed-not-showing-in-system/?tag=contentBody;threadListing We cover a lot of ground including a setting that limits the OS to 4GB as well as using the BIOS to see what the PC sees before Windows starts. What does the BIOS show? And before you answer, Windows will never show more than what the BIOS shows. Bob
