<s> Just curious, what cpu (based upon the cpu's out there now) would run Vista faster, better, etc? </s>
<s> An Athlon FX(X2) or an Intel Core Duo? </s>
<s> I am definitely not going with Vista for at least a year or so after it's release, I know what the hardware requirements are now for Vista and was just curious. </s>
<s> All opinions are respected and appreciated. </s>

<s> if u need a cpu for vista this second i sugest go with the x2 but if u can wait for a few months. </s>
<s> go for conroe that is even faster than the fx62. </s>
<s> it will cost u a pretty penny but it will be worth it. </s>
<s> as for the x2 don't go for anything lower than a 4200. </s>
<s> 4400x2 is recomended </s>
<s> I'm personally in the middle of building an X2 4200+ system. </s>
<s> If I was going to go with a 4400+, but since the AM2 versions are no longer being made/sold, I'm stuck going cheaper since I capped my own price. </s>
<s> Anyway, enough about me. </s>
<s> I agree with the other guy. </s>
<s> If you can wait a good 3-4 months, I'd build a Core 2 Duo/Core 2 Extreme-based system. </s>
<s> It will be expensive, but as of right now, the most expensive chip will still be cheaper then the afforementioned FX-62 by around $300. </s>
<s> It will also destroy the FX-62. </s>
<s> Of course, if you're like me and you want to build something immediately, go with an AMD processor of your choosing, whether it be FX or X2. </s>
<s> And I'd also go with an AM2 socket processor, just so you can upgrade down the line if you need to. </s>
<s> DDR2 667mhz memory runs about the same speed as DDR 400mhz, so there's plenty of good memory if you need it for cheap. </s>
<s> Just make sure you have a graphics card capable of jumping through hoops if you're wanting all the fancy effects of Vista. </s>
<s> If you can wait and have the extra cash, then go with the Core Duo 2 becuase it seems to be the best deal at the moment. </s>
<s> Right now, it's the X2. </s>
<s> As for the video card, the minimum requirements I found is a GeForce FX 5200, Radeon 9550, or Radeon X300. </s>
<s> I am not going to build one now or in the next month or so, but I was just curious about what cpu might be the best right now considering that Vista will be 64-bit and..the virtual ocean of cpu options. </s>
<s> I am not a 'gamer' so I won't need a top of the line system, but I do have a level of performance that I expect from my pc. </s>
<s> Right now I have an athlon64 3200 with 1gig of pc3200 ram and a 128mb agp 8x video card. </s>
<s> I would like to experience the next level of performance in the next year or so being as my system is only about 1 year old now. </s>
<s> Thanks much for the opinions and recommendations. </s>
<s> Ciao, Rocco </s>
