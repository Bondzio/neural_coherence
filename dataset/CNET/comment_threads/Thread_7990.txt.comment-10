I have the Emachnies T6212.
I upgraded the grphics card to a 6600 GT OC and threw in 2 512 sticks of ram and the thing kicks ass!
I can play Half Life 2 with all of the graphics turned up no problem.
Same with Far Cry.
I also bought a $20 soundblaster card, and a 450 Watt power supply, but you don't &quot;need&quot; these last two items.
Nice to have though.
AND when you decide to go SLI all you have to do is buy a motherboard!
It's a no brainer dude..
