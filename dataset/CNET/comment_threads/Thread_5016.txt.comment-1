i have an apple Ibook G4.
i am trying to run the smackbook program on it.
i get all the way through the process until it comes time to change out the line of code in the &quot;smack.pl&quot; file.
once i change it, i run the terminal correctly, and it says that there are a few errors, but it doesnt say how to fix them.
help please?
