Since the reformat the shortcut keys like skip to the next song or open up the internet, Extra keys not on a standard keyboard for quick commands, have not been working. I've checked the driver, it is up to date and installed and i've even looked in the keyboard setting in control panel and couldn't find the tab labeled something like key settings that is usually there in XP. So, question is... Where does Vista hide the settings to change key functions? How do I get the keyboard shortcuts to work?

I read your post twice and can't see a make and model of the PC so I'll offer HP's download but it's likely the wrong one -&gt; http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/SoftwareDescription.jsp?lang=en&cc=us&prodTypeId=321957&prodSeriesId=447369&prodNameId=447345&swEnvOID=228&swLang=8&mode=2&taskId=135&swItem=ob-31502-1 If you look at your machine you could find the one for your machine at its maker's web page.
