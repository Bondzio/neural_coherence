<s> the conection works for the internet, but when i bring in a laptop with a wireless conection to pc1 it wont let me print. </s>
<s> i cant connect pc2 to the router. </s>
<s> i shared the printer and files when i went thru the wizard. </s>
<s> i checked the printer and its shared. </s>
<s> not sure where to go. </s>
<s> If I have this new laptop and I logged in as bob then I need an account on the machine with the printer called &quot;bob&quot; as well as the printer driver on my laptop. </s>

<s> the laptop could print before i connected the cross over cable. </s>
<s> when i connect the cable, then the laptop cant print. </s>
<s> Sorry, but crossover cables and connections to the PC with such are simply hack jobs that require whoever does that to keep notes about how they did that. </s>
<s> I'm going to share that it all works fine in the normal way of connections from the internet to the router and then to the computers. </s>

<s> &quot;the laptop could print before i connected the cross over cable. </s>
<s> when i connect the cable, then the laptop cant print.&quot; Don't do that. </s>
<s> i need the cross over cable from pc2 to pc1 so i can connect to the internet. </s>
<s> There is an issue with Windows network shares in your setup. </s>
<s> They may not work &quot;all the time.&quot; Good luck with that setup. </s>
