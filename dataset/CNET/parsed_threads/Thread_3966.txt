<s> Guidance and advice please: I have a rather old desktop, with PC2100 2600 MHz DDR memory. </s>
<s> I cannot find a good deal for this obsolete memory, but I can find many good deals for later RAM versions such as PC2700 or later versions. </s>
<s> QUESTION: will a PC2700 DDR memory card work when installed into the memory slot of my desktop's motherboard? </s>
<s> Thank you in advance for any advice, thank you. </s>
<s> In general, you can put faster DDR memory modules into motherboards that have RAM slots running at slower speeds. </s>
<s> The faster memory will run at the slower speed. </s>
<s> There are some other things to watch for, such as compatible voltages, and maximum size (density) of each module. </s>
<s> I just put a 512MB PC3200 module into a Dell motherboard that specified PC2100 as its fastest speed. </s>
<s> Works great! </s>
<s> Enter your computer make and model at crucial.com to see what they advise. </s>
<s> Then, shop around for the best price on memory that meets those specifications. </s>
<s> Best to give us make/mfg, series and model #. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
