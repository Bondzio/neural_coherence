1.1.1	ok , a friend has an old emachine with windows 98 on it , and every once in a while it just magically powers up all on its own .	St
1.1.2	any ideas on how to trouble shoot this ?	Ques
1.1.3	would this be a problem with the mobo or other hardware or is it a win 98 thing ?	Ques
1.1.4	any advice would be appreciated - fj	Polite
1.2.1	Bios feature ?	Ques
1.2.2	Look around in the bios ( power section ? )	Ques
1.2.3	see if you have something like 'wake on lan ' 'wake on ring ' 'wake on ... .something ' .	St
1.2.4	I never tested any of these things as I do n't use the bios or windows P.M. feature .	St
1.3.1	I have an old Win98 machine that comes on in the middle of the night too .	St
1.3.2	I have assumed that it is doing maintenence which is scheduled to be done by the program which you set up to do these things ( forgot the name -- I do n't use the pc much ) .	St
1.3.3	Check the program list -- I think under accessories .	St
1.3.4	& quot ; Scheduled Maintenence & quot ; or some such .	St
1.4.1	i dont think the computer will start itself for maintenance since automatic update and virus software are run by the windows os and not by the hardware ( windows software does not boot ) on the other hand , the bios has a setting for starting the computer at a certain date , at a certain time .	St
1.4.2	i also dont think the & quot ; wake up & quot ; options work for a full boot , i thing they are to wake from soft off .	St
