i hope my question is not seen as too remedial, but i have been using cable internet access for over a year, and have only just discovered that i can get my wife onto my account for free.
she currently struggles with aol, and i've been advised that i can get her using my cable connection - without no inconvenience to me (i work from home) - if i just network her to my computer, using a wireless router.
could somebody advise?
she has 2 usb ports, but no ethernet port, so i'm assuming i need to get a usb to ethernet adapter, but then what?
what other stuff do i need to buy, and what do you recommend that is inexpensive but works well enough: she just needs to be able to go online to check her emails, and very rarely browse some online store or other!
many thanks, in advance, for your feedback and advice.
