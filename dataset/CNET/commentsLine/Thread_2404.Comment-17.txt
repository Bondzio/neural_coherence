part ii bill gates suckered me in the first time with windows 2.11 (if youre reading this i still want my money back) with the promise of tomorrows interface today.
gem desktop was better by the way better than win 3x and that was long before it) the whole idea that the os would recognize hardware was exciting.
but, after all these years i can now depress &lt;cntrl&gt; &lt;alt&gt; &lt;del&gt; from across the room with my eyeballs.
its frustrating that os/hardware issues are still the bane of my existence.
but back to multiple hard drives.
well when windows gets cluttered and it starts taking longer for windows to boot than my old coffee maker to spit out a pot of go juice i revert to my thrilling days of yesteryear format and start over.
i do it on the tp just cause.
it has the spare hard drive bay and instead of messing with cd coasters i just mirror over a few directories as a quick backup before i plop the restore cd in.
on the athlon let me just say that i have three teenage boys.
you have no idea the crap that finds it way onto that hard drive.
uh no dad i dont look at websites like thati dont know why those popups keep happening or i didnt open any email attachments with a pif extension.
in reality i always do the tp with bios.
its kinda weird when you put in the spare hard drive module (takes the place of the cd) if you just reboot it will reverse the drives and make the second hard drive c and the first d. gets really weird when the drives have multiple partitions.
its easy to lose track of which drive is which.
