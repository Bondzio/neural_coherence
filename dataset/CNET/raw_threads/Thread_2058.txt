When I plugged it in, it doesn't do anything. The computer doesn't recognize it.. nothing. At least I know it's not the power because the light turns on. We called Simpletech and they said that it was probably dropped. They said to open it and try connecting it to the computer directly. My PC is IDE and not SATA so is there another way to do this. I know it's not my USB ports because I have two external hard drives myself and it works just fine. My friend wants me to recover it since GeekSquad charges alot and I know it's something simple. I've recovered internal hard drives before but not external. Simpletech External Hard Drive has a Mitshubishi Hard Drive. If you are shopping for one, I would highly recommend not getting this one. I have a Seagate Free Agent and it works great. No problems for me and I use it alot. Platform: Windows XP

The led light is connected to only 1 of the 2 power supplies so it is NEVER a test you can rely on. After you replace the case, then you replace the drive. There are only 2 parts to such things. Bob
