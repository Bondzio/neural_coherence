When I insert it into a usb slot I get a message that one of the usb devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned, and windows does not recognized it. I have tried the drive on several computers and get the same message. Is there some way to recover the data or is it trash time?

Proffitt	9/3/12 10:19 AM	1.34666754E12	Try the usual tools noted at link.	http://forums.cnet.com/7723-7588_102-354911/lost-and-found-or-the-storage-forum-sticky/?tag=contentBody;threadListing One of those tools is to boot a LiveCD called Ubuntu. This is a no-install way to see if we can get at the files. Also try the rear USB ports of a desktop.
