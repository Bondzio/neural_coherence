you need to verify under your manual or latest info from the vendor/mtrbd.
support website what memory can be installed.
then, proceed to get some benefit from faster ram, however it also ties in with the cpu as well as a good match with fsb/speed.
even, if the cpu won't help, the benefit will be there but don't expect a &quot;gee whiz effect&quot;, in other words, &quot;wow&quot;.
good luck -----willy
