As before, it is going against my grain to even move on with this.
In my opinion, something is beyond wrong here.
The last thing I will attempt to ask you is, do you have an older pci or agp card to test in the machine?
I read some specs on your MB and it will run an older AGP just fine, according to the specs that is.
That would be my very last suggestion to you since I think your motherboard is in trouble and as I suggested before, I wouldn't even try to start it.
After this,I will bow out and leave it to someone else, but I can say, IF another vid card won't work, it's trashed.
Either way, good luck.
