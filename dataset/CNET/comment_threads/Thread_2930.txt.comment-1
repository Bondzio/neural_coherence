I want to build a pentium system on a budget of about $2000.
The uses will be heavy microsoft office functions, possibility of engineering CAD applications in near future, and moderate gaming.
I would also like something failry media capable.
No need to include OS or office in this budget but I would like a decent set of 5.1 speakers as well as a monitor(19inLCD?).
What are my best hardware options here.
I'm mainly curious about what CPU, motherboard, video card, and RAM to use.
Also any speacial comments on good tv tuner, monitor, and speakers would be helpful.
Feedback would be appreciated.
