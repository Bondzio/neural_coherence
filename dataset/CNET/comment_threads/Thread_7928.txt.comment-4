Safe mode boot failures are now a solid sign of malware damage.
Over in the Storage Forum at the top post are ways to get your files out.
And a last chance.
DO NOT PLUG IN ANY USB OR OTHER THING.
Try safe mode again.
And I know what your question.
Can you fix Safe Mode boot failures?
I can but on pre-installed Windows I can't since they remove all the tools to fix it.
We get the files out safe then reinstall the OS.
