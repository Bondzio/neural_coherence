the link i supplied was epson.com and i put in sx405 and they said they couldn't find it.
another overhead media type i used years ago had a full white paper backing sheet.
again this sort of stuff is best dealt with by talking to epson.
i can't even start because i can't find the sx405 at epson.com help others help you with the model number epson calls it or a link.
