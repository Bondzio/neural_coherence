my last hp (which i mean literally unless hp ever makes good on that one) was 3 months old, and after 8 hours on the phone they took it in.
it returned in a week and never ran for more than 5 minutes then lock up.
all calls ended with &quot;we've done all we can&quot; and after 9 months i called it quits then share the story here.
you don't want it fixed.
you want a refund.
