I have read the exact links several times but still the question that I am asking is, since my raid crashed before I knew anything about raid, I used a restoral disk that restored the system, however, I don't know how the remaining drive is configured.
How do I replace the dead drive without running the risk of losing the data that is on the remaining disk.
I agree that the raid array is not the way that I want to configure the system with the new drive.
Should I just set the new drive to slave and the old remaining drive to master?
Like I said before, the primary master and primary slave are not even listed as detected in the bios.
I'm sorry if I'm having a hard time explaining exactly what my delimma is, as it may not be a delimma at all but I don't want to lose my data and I need to add space.
