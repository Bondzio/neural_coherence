<s> We are in need of a MultiMode 120 port approximately 2 inches in width, with the teeth measuring 1.5 inches. </s>
<s> Picture available if necessary. </s>
<s> We were given monitors, and the port that comes with them is unusual as far as we can tell. </s>
<s> As such, we are unable to connect the monitor to the tower we would like to use it with. </s>
<s> We are looking for anyone with experience or knowledge to assist us in connecting them--whether we need a special video card or an adapter to connect them. </s>
<s> See http://www.digibarn.com/collections/monitors/sigma-multimode/index.html It's for older equipment like old unix boxes. </s>

<s> Well, according to our information, the monitor can be used with either Mac or PC... or at least was intended to be. </s>

<s> It's from a time long ago. </s>
<s> It's going to be too rare today to find someone to make this part for you. </s>

<s> We just wanted to say that we were actually able to locate a graphics card that supported the monitor, but thanks anyway. </s>
<s> I haven't seen that card in over 10 years. </s>
<s> The knowledge is out there on the internet but not in my braincells. </s>
<s> It still required me to make a custom cable... Bob </s>
