<s> I am planning to buy a bluetooth donlge for my laptop, but then wondered: Would it be possible to connect my phone to my laptop (via the cable or infra-red) and then use the bluetooth on the phone, making my phone itself the bluetooth dongle. </s>
<s> Unleashing it's power to my laptop. </s>
<s> I have a Nokia 6230, a Toshiba Equium Laptop (with USB and infra red), a Nokia Connectivity Cable and Windows XP Home SP2 Any tech-wizard up for the challenge? </s>
<s> Will Nokia reveal how to talk to the phone? </s>
<s> These areas are what I call closed source and not open for most if not all tinkerers. </s>
<s> The amount of time to reverse engineer such can be too high except for those that want to invest the time. </s>

<s> Thanks for your help </s>
