<s> I have an internet access by cable connected to my workstation, and everything was fine. </s>
<s> Then i got a server (actually an usual computer: P4 3.0HT, ASUS P4P800-X, 1GB DDR, 2x100Mbps NIC), set up the Win2003 Server and configured Routing&Remote access, so i had i small network. </s>
<s> Then i discovered the speed was decreased when surfing internet. </s>
<s> Made a speed test on server, it shows 600-900kbps, then plug a cable into workstation, and test result was 2000-2200kbps. </s>
<s> The NIC on server are ok, replaced with new one. </s>
<s> Routing&remote acces was turned off when testing, no network applications& extra services running. </s>
<s> What may be the problem? </s>
<s> What can cause Windows Server to decrease the speed? </s>
<s> Why not put a router in there and be done with it? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> well, because the server is also a database server, web server and file server. </s>
<s> I need it for development. </s>
<s> So you say that it's a bad idea to user PC with Windows Server as a NAT router? </s>
<s> Set up the server to serve such. </s>
<s> Adding NAT is going to frustrate people that actually look at the numbers. </s>
<s> The speed you noted was fine years ago but as rates climbed... What I'm writing is to use what works best where it works best. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Great idea, i can buy a router and put a server+workstation behind that keeping internet connect to both machines almost direct. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
