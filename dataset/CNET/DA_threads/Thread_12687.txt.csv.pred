1.2.1	and found this combo package, it's a little bit more money, but a better AMD processor (plus you save $25 in the process) http://www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealDetails.aspx?ItemList=Combo.335042 Note: this motherboard uses DDR2 memory (a bit cheaper than DDR3 at the moment) Also some G-Skill memory (for about the same price as you're planning to pay) http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231136 And a slightly better video card http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814161320 while on Newegg.com, check through the specifications of each TV tuner to see if it will perform the functions you want, perhaps this one will do: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16815116036	St
