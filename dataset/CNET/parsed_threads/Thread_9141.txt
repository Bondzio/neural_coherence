<s> I have a Dell PC without internal USB Headers. </s>
<s> i am looking for an internally installed All in One Media Card Reader with a method of connection for a PC without an internal USB Header. </s>
<s> Does anyone know if such a device is made or any work arounds? </s>
<s> Maybe your common external can be mounted internally then run the USB cord through the machine and out the back to a port. </s>
<s> Then again I just used an external and velcro'd it to the machine. </s>
<s> they're usually called X+1 cards where X is the number of external usb ports and the +1 is an internal port. </s>
<s> you can pop the internal usb connector off to access the header. </s>
