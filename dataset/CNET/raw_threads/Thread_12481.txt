Me too! I am wondering if a way to combat this frustrating problem might be with a sound pod - I'm considering Byterunner UA 580 (USB 5.1 Channel Audio Adapter). Anyone have any experience or advice regarding this? Many thanks!

Do you have Microsoft Media Center 2005. I was told by a Creative tech the sound card is not compatable Microsoft Media Center. Im going to call bak and see if it's compatable with SB Live. If not I will return it.

Tech support at Creative tried some software fixes with me, but wasn't able to solve the problem. I'm going to try a higher end microphone with the sound card and also a USB microphone. Anyone find any other fixes?

Only thing I can't get USB mic to work with is with the &quot;speakerphone&quot; cabalities of my modem. This is probably a different issue, however. Mic works great with sound recorder, and all other programs using voice input.
