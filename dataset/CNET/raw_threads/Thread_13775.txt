7976	0	163557	1810038	NR	the7ftman	3/15/06 1:20 PM	1.1424288E12	Another OS question	Im getting ready to build a new computer. I currently have an external drive and intend to take it out and use it as my primary drive in my new comp. I was wondering if i could take it out and install it where my current internal hard drive is, and install the operating system on it so it will be ready to go when i put together my new comp. Would this work? Will it still be loaded and ready when i put it in the new system? Any help is appreciated, the7ftman
