1.1.1	I got a &quot;Qwerty&quot; keyboard problem that I discovered this morning.	St
1.1.2	When I attempt to type a capital &quot;O&quot; by holding the left shift key down, nothing happens including typing a &quot;blank&quot; character.	St
1.1.3	The keyboard in question is a Logitech wireless unit.	St
1.1.4	The left shift key works for all other keys except the capital O.	St
1.1.5	However, holding the right shift key down does allow me to type a capital O.	St
1.1.6	Anyone have an idea as to how to fix this short of getting another keyboard?	St
1.2.1	(Doctor) Don't do that.	St
1.2.2	...	St
1.2.3	Sorry but try new batteries and another keyboard.	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	Don't ask me why, but I found the F7 key stuck &quot;down&quot; and for some reason, this stopped the capital O using teh left shift key.	St
1.4.2	All other keys worked with the left shift key.	St
1.4.3	GO FIGURE!	St
1.4.4	PS FWIW, the F7 key on this keyboard has a printer icon on it.	St
1.5.1	the key in question is &quot;dirty&quot; or the contact membrane under the actual key.	St
1.5.2	Clean out the keyboard and membrane.	St
1.5.3	It will work then.	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
