1.1.1	This is a pretty old argument , that I had n't paid any attention to , but I want to explore it , again .	St
1.1.2	I 've been with Microsoft from the very earliest versions of Windows 3.1 .	St
1.1.3	Long time , to say the least .	St
1.1.4	My current machine is a Dell 8400 , with WIN XP , which I fear is reaching old age .	St
1.1.5	I 'm encountering increasing & quot ; blue screens & quot ; of death despite increasing memory to 3 gigs , repeated scans of Norton 's AV , repeated scans using Iolo System Mechanic , and disk defrag .	St
1.1.6	The system still slows down .	St
1.1.7	I 'm spending more time keeping it healthy rather enjoying .	St
1.1.8	I want a & quot ; no muss , no fuss & quot ; system that I do n't have to babysit .	St
1.1.9	I 'm ready to move on .	St
1.1.10	I 've contemplated moving over to Apple .	St
1.1.11	I 've often heard that iMac is superior is all aspects , but how ?	Ques
1.1.12	I 've never seen MS Vista in action and only tinkered with the iMac at Best Buy .	St
1.1.13	So , I 'm horribly deficient in product knowledge .	St
1.1.14	What I want is an unbiased discussion , the technical merits , strengths/weaknesses of each platform , so I can make an informed decision .	St
1.1.15	I have no allegance to the MS OS and I 'm intrigued by the iMac capabilities .	St
1.1.16	But I can easily be swayed to stick with MS .	St
1.1.17	I 've searched the CNET website , but could n't find anything that really talks to this topic .	St
1.1.18	Maybe I 'm not looking in the right place ?	Ques
1.1.19	Can anyone provide me a link/URL ?	Ques
1.1.20	Thanks , Vince in Leesburg , Va .	St
1.2.1	It slows with time as well .	St
1.2.2	I 'm betting its the same stuff that gums up the works on the older versions .	St
1.2.3	I too use the Mac from time to time but my software development system is still on Windows so for now I just live with it .	St
1.2.4	The wife will be going to a Mac very soon so I do n't have to be tech support .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	... because I 'm in the same boat .	St
1.3.2	We bought our Sony Vaio desktop 6 years ago and have spent thousands over the years to keep it from becoming obsolete .	St
1.3.3	It 's fair to say that I 've pushed this PC to it 's limit .	St
1.3.4	I 'm ready for something new but am not sure what I want .	St
1.3.5	My husband is pushing for a laptop but I keep going back to a desktop .	St
1.3.6	I 'm drawn to the All-In-One 's such as the HP TouchSmart or the iMac but I 'm still not sold on either .	St
1.3.7	I 've always had a Windows PC so admittedly moving to a Mac is a little scary .	St
1.3.8	Especially when we just invested several hundred dollars in Office 2007 for my husbands laptop .	St
1.3.9	I 've been told that you can run Windows on an Apple- which would make the transition much more appealing .	St
1.3.10	Does anyone have an opinion about that ?	Ques
1.4.1	I will come out straight with it .	St
1.4.2	I am 100 % on the PC side of the war , for several reasons .	St
1.4.3	They are highly versatile , they can be upgraded in numerous ways ( now more than ever with most modern motherboards supporting at least 16 GB of ram , depending on the CPU they support ) , and they have MULTIPLE operating systems written for them .	St
1.4.4	A few that come to mind are linux ( which comes in some 140+ different flavors to choose from ) , unix , windows , and openBSD ) .	St
1.4.5	I have been using computers for a straight 5 years ( but started 8 years ago in middle school on the Apple iMac ) .	St
1.4.6	To answer the question above me before I get to ranting , Windows can indeed be run on an Apple computer , but you may need to download special drivers offline to support some of the Apple specific hardware you are sure to find in one of their computers ( As I had to for one of their notebooks ) .	St
1.4.7	It runs good on either platform however .	St
1.4.8	My reasons for being on the PC side of things are the following .	St
1.4.9	I built ( 6 months ago now ) a $ 600 POWERHOUSE PC , quad-core AMD PhenomII 2.6ghz cpu , 8 gigs of DDR3 ram ( PC10666 speed ) .	St
1.4.10	My motherboard supports 16 gigs of ram , my graphics card is the ATI RadeonHD 4890 ( 1 gig ram mem ) , a 1TB WD Sata HDD , a backup 250 gig samsung Sata HDD , and a DVD multi burner .	St
1.4.11	I even threw in a TV tuner card ( for those superbowl games ) .	St
1.4.12	This computer tears through EVERYTHING I throw at it , and it only cost me 600 , not including the OS ( I had a previous XP disc from my old laptop that I used , and also dual booting with a few Linux distros , which are free operating systems ) .	St
1.4.13	Even WITH an OS , it would have hit 700 .	St
1.4.14	Now I present you with this .	St
1.4.15	WHY go and pay upwards of 1000 ( in some cases 2000 ) for a computer with very limited functions and hardware ?	Ques
1.4.16	I have seen the inside of a lot of apples , and I got ta say , I am not impressed .	St
1.4.17	Sure the hardware is arranged cool , and they have some shiny outsides ( G5 anyone ?	Ques
1.4.18	) , but really , they are all show no go .	St
1.4.19	And before you go believing the hype that & quot ; apple has no flaws & quot ; , I am staring at the aforementioned G5 right now , and it REFUSES to boot into the OS .	St
1.4.20	I have replaced the HDD , the RAM ( all written on apple support forums for my error code ) , and even bought a new OS disc to try .	St
1.4.21	It still fails to work .	St
1.4.22	I can not place the issue , even though I am A+ certified to work on these machines ( which sadly , does not say much , as the Apples are not covered in A+ certification material ) .	St
1.4.23	An Apple machine is just as flawed as a PC , although I do rather enjoy their Hierarchical File System ( HFS ) , for its good handling in the fragmentation department .	St
1.4.24	Now as for windows slowing down over time , there are a few simple fixes for that .	St
1.4.25	Download a program called CC cleaner .	St
1.4.26	Its from Piriform , and it will fix most of your speed based issues .	St
1.4.27	Windows attempts to make calculations based on your activities within the OS , and will store data to call commonly used programs faster .	St
1.4.28	However , overtime , you may not use these programs , but those files will stick around .	St
1.4.29	This can cause slow speeds .	St
1.4.30	Another issue may be your Hard Drives Read/Write speeds .	St
1.4.31	You may be using an old IDE based HDD instead of Sata .	St
1.4.32	IDE is a paralled based technology , which is slower to retrieve/send data , where as Sata is serial in nature , and much faster .	St
1.4.33	If you want a sata HDD , sadly , if your Mobo has no ports for it , you will need an upgrade .	St
1.4.34	The computer industry is CONSTANTLY advancing .	St
1.4.35	What was popular last year is now near obsolete this year .	St
1.4.36	Think about it for a minuet .	St
1.4.37	Quad core CPU 's came out what ... .3 years ago ?	Ques
1.4.38	Now we are already looking into 6 and 8 core cpus , and Intel is researching a 48 core cpu ( if I read correctly , they have already made it , and are testing it in a few areas ) .	St
1.4.39	Things become fast outdated in the computer world .	St
1.4.40	The same applies for Apples .	St
1.4.41	It boils down to your opinions , and how deep you are willing to dig .	St
1.4.42	You can get a quality PC for about half the cost of a & quot ; quality & quot ; apple .	St
1.5.1	I 'm going to stay out of this one , but figured you would be interested in what I believe is the latest desktop buying guide from Cnet .	St
1.5.2	Note this guide includes both Macs and PCs - http : //reviews.cnet.com/desktop-computer-buying-guide/ ? tag=resourceLeftContainer.0	Ques
