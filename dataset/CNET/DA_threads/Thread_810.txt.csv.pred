1.1.1	Ok so I have a dvd box set that I stupidly ordered from a seller located in the UK.	St
1.1.2	Problem is that they are a different region as the US.	St
1.1.3	This wouldn't be such a problem but it seems like everything is equipped with these lame region restrictions.	St
1.1.4	The most problematic at this time is my DVD-RW drive.	St
1.1.5	Apparently you can only change it's region a limited number of times and I have reached the limit.	St
1.1.6	My question for all the geekier people out there than myself is what can I do to beat the region problem?	St
1.1.7	below is link to a screen shot of the driver region status for the DVD-RW which is basically saying I'm screwed.	St
1.1.8	BTW I have a eMachines T6410 (I know it's lame) Any help or advice at all would be greatly appreciated!	Ques
1.1.9	Thanks, Paul http://lh3.ggpht.com/Pkr8ch/SAqgLXsb9nI/AAAAAAAAAM0/x_JHFrhOgj0/s400/screwed.jpg	St
1.2.1	The drives are cheap.	St
1.2.2	Under 30 bucks for a nice sata dvdrw.	St
1.2.3	CHEAPER than what they charge to reset the count.	St
1.3.1	do you know of any particular drive or software that would allow me to view dvd's regularly from multiple regions without lowering my allowance of region changes?	Ques
1.4.1	It has to do with a national agreement.	St
1.4.2	You only find these in Australia and other few countries.	St
1.4.3	Why is this a big issue at such a low cost part?	St
1.5.1	Well to most people $30 here and there is nothing but I'm kind of broke.	St
1.5.2	That's why I was looking for a permanent solution to the problem that would allow me to basically forget that there was a such thing as different region codes.	St
1.6.1	It's an agreement made in most countries.	St
1.6.2	As I must obey the local laws I can't comment on breaking said law.	St
