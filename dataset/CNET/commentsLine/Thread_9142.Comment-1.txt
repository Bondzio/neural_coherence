i'm quite interested in purchasing a desktop pc in the slimline form factor, but have read some negative reviews on at least one vendor.
are there any brands that you can recommend that have a history of reliable operation?
i'd also be interested in any other comments such as service considerations, restrictions on add-on cards, and power supply capacity.
