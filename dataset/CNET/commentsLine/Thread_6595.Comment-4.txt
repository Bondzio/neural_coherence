replacing the cpu is not hard.
just be careful.
the worst thing is that you need to make sure your motherboard can support the right cpu.
before you replace the cpu read up on it.
the best thing i could find to explain it is at this article:  back to the actual cpu--the best(and most expensive)that your mobo will support is probably the amd athlon xp 3000+.
probably the best thing for you to do is just read up on it, or get help from someone who can show you.
hope this helps, any questions just post!
