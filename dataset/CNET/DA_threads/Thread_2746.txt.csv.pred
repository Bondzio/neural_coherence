1.1.1	Hello all , I just purchased a Buffalo Linkstation 250gb NAS , and one of my machines can not map the drive .	St
1.1.2	I connected it to my D-Link Wireless Router and installed it without an issue .	St
1.1.3	My laptop -also running Win XP pro- can see and map the drive .	St
1.1.4	( whether wired or wireless ! )	St
1.1.5	My desiktop can not map the drive .	St
1.1.6	The software included with the drive runs and shows the drive and the IP address .	St
1.1.7	I can log-on to the drive via a browser and change any setting .	St
1.1.8	But , when I Select Run from the Start Menu and type in \\BIGDRIVE and press enter ..	St
1.1.9	I get & quot ; The Network Path was not found & quot ; I tried searching for the drive , but it was not found !	St
1.1.10	I called Buffalo tech support and they said it was a Windows problem and I should unmap any other drives and then map this one first .	St
1.1.11	I disconnected my card reader because that occupies drive letters , and even uninstalled my iomega zip drive , but it did n't work .	St
1.1.12	Please help !	St
1.1.13	Terry	St
1.2.1	Hi , I have EXACTLY the same problem.. Any help would be appreciated	St
1.3.1	But let 's share how windows finds \\BIGDRIVE .	St
1.3.2	Windows has to resolve that name to some IP address .	St
1.3.3	Sadly there is no detail about how you set up Windows to resolve names to addresses .	St
1.3.4	But you could find the IP address of said drive and try ... \\192.168.0.101 instead but use the IP of BIGDRIVE .	St
1.3.5	Bob	St
1.4.1	I 'll do my best to explain .	St
1.4.2	I spoke to a networking person I know and they said the problem was with the way I initially setup my home network .	St
1.4.3	My desktop computer was initially setup without a router .	St
1.4.4	A direct connect to the cable modem .	St
1.4.5	When I later added a router , everything seemed to work fine .	St
1.4.6	I did , however , have trouble seeing other computers and drives on the desktop machine .	St
1.4.7	I worked around this by accessing the desktop from the other computers .	St
1.4.8	I should have paid more attention to this problem because it was an indication that my network was in a somewhat limited configuration .	St
1.4.9	This is the part I do not explain too well ...	St
1.4.10	If I ran IPCONFIG from the command prompt , it would show 192.168.0.0 as the IP address of my computer .	St
1.4.11	But the router 's IP address was also 192.168.0.0 .	St
1.4.12	I am not sure how this happened , but it had something to do with the initial configuration ( before the router ) .	St
1.4.13	When I added \\BIGDRIVE to the router , it grabbed an IP address and was only visible to other , newer machines added to the router .	St
1.4.14	The desktop could not see it .	St
1.4.15	WHAT I DID TO FIX IT : I forced the IP address of the router up to another number : 192.168.0.1 Made sure the desktop was another number : 192.168.0.150 Also , I made sure that \\BIGDRIVE was yet another number : 192.168.0.101 .	St
1.4.16	After that ( and a number of restarts of the desktop , router and \\BIGDRIVE , and suddenly everything was available .	St
1.4.17	I hope my somewhat weak explanation helps !	St
1.4.18	Terry	St
1.5.1	Thx for the posts .	St
1.5.2	However , I 've tried IP Changes ... Treid \\IP address of my Linkstation ... .Any other ideas that may help ? ..	Ques
1.5.3	Oh , and I checked to ensure I was running the correct firmware.. i.e 2.05 ... ?	Ques
1.5.4	?	Ques
1.6.1	http : //www.windowsitpro.com/Article/ArticleID/43166/43166.html notes the 3 ways Windows can resolve a name to an IP address .	St
1.6.2	If you combine this article with the fact that many install a firewall you see a recipe for lookup failures .	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	I had a similar problem .	St
1.7.2	My Linkstation is plugged into a Linksys switch .	St
1.7.3	I could ping it and open the configuration page through a web browser .	St
1.7.4	But when I typed \\Linkstation , I got the message 'network path not found ' .	St
1.7.5	Buffalo tech support asked me to turn off my Firewall ( I Use Norton ) temporarily and retry .	St
1.7.6	I was then able to access the drive .	St
1.7.7	I then entered the IP address for the Linkstation in the trusted site tab in Norton and turned the firewall back on .	St
1.7.8	I have not had problems since .	St
1.7.9	Good Luck	St
1.8.1	I 'm experiencing the same problem that others have noted here ie when I try to access my Buffalo LinkStation 250gb network drive , I get the dreaded & quot ; the network path was not found & quot ; message .	St
1.8.2	What 's so frustrating is that my LinkStation has been installed and working on the same system for over a year , no real problems .	St
1.8.3	This problem just cropped up in the past week or so .	St
1.8.4	I 'm able to access all the drive settings via the web interface , and the IP Configuration Utility immediately scans and finds the drive .	St
1.8.5	I 've received a couple of responsed from Buffalo Tech Support , but none of their suggestions has worked for me so far .	St
1.8.6	I 'm running XPMCE on a Dell 8400 , cable modem .	St
1.8.7	My LinkStation is attached to a D-Link 614 wireless router .	St
1.8.8	So far I have tried : * using the \\IP method to address the drive * manually changing the IP address to a fixed value * disabling firewall software ( Sygate ) * disabling AV ( Norton v2005 ) * disabling Windows Defender * renaming the drive * runing the disk scan/repair utility * moving the LinkStation away from other equipment * removing/reinstalling Client for MS Networks and File and Printer Sharing * Changing the TCP/IP WIN/Advanced setting to Enable NetBIOS I use the drive mainly as a backup source , and I do n't think there is too much on there that would be lost , but not having the frequent ( nightly ) backups of my essential data files is causing me concern .	St
1.8.9	Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.9.1	After the 3rd round of communications from Buffalo tech support I arrived at the following solution : I turned FTP filesharing on in the Linkstation and was able to access my data folders one at a time using an explorer window and the address ftp : // & lt ; ip address & gt ; .	St
1.9.2	Using this method , I backed them up to my HD .	St
1.9.3	( took some time ) I installed an updated firmware file ( v1.47 ) from the Buffalo tech support website using the & quot ; /force & quot ; install parameter .	St
1.9.4	( this also took some time ) .	St
1.9.5	My original files were intact after this process was completed .	St
1.9.6	After this was done , everything was working as it should be .	St
1.9.7	Apparently , the binary files somehow were corrupted .	St
1.9.8	I just wish I knew how/why this happened so it could be avoided in the future .	St
1.9.9	The LinkStation lives a sheltered life , in a place where it does n't receive any bumps , and is powered by a filtered , battery backed UPS of considerable capacity .	St
