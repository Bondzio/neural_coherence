first go into your bios (press del to enter setup when your pc is starting up).
see if the hard drive is detected correctly there.
if it comes up as the right size then the problem is with windows.
if it comes up as the wrong size update your bios by going to the motherboard manufacturers website.
if the problem is with windows firstly make sure you have windows updated, sp2 and all that (assuming you have xp).
then go to the hard drive manufacturers website and there should be a downloadable utility on there that allows windows to detect large hard disks (called big drive enabler or some such...) hope this helps tim
