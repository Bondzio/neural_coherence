1.1.1	lots of RAM and a slow gfx card or ... small amount of RAM and a fast gfx card ?	Ques
1.1.2	( obviously it would be better to go in between , i wan na know out of personal interest .	St
1.1.3	so those are you only two choices ; ) )	St
1.2.1	Most games perform just fine on 512M to 1GB RAM .	St
1.2.2	Since that 's cheap , you only need to review the card .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	For example if you try to play games on XP with just 256 RAM the video card likely does n't matter .	St
1.3.2	Similarly , borderline minimal requirements on either may not be good if the game is graphic intensive .	St
1.3.3	Meanwhile you could have all the memory in the world but an integrated video with limited memory , e.g .	St
1.3.4	a 64 MB integrated video configuration , would also limit gaming experiences .	St
1.3.5	Regards , JB	St
1.4.1	as close to the graphics engine as possible .	St
1.4.2	So a video card ( graphics engine ) with a lot of memory will be able to handle the most graphical processing .	St
1.4.3	On the other hand , if your graphical interface is on the motherboard ( and not separate card ) lots of ram would greatly increase its performance .	St
1.5.1	Depends on optimal requirements for the most rigorous game you plan to play .	St
1.5.2	Usually somewhere ( often the bottom end ) on the game software box is a list of the system requirements to run the software .	St
1.5.3	Often there will be two sets of specs : the minimal hardware required to run it ( in its lowest graphical modes ) , and also the preferred or & quot ; optimal & quot ; system specs that would allow you to set the in-game graphics parameters to the higher or max variables .	St
1.5.4	Also , the DirectX minimal version the game requires is important ( software wise ) .	St
1.5.5	The newest released is DirectX 10 , which is vastly different than 9 and the previous versions .	St
1.5.6	However at the present time , DirectX 10 video hardware is just emerging and so is kind of rare to find , and can cost BIG bucks , often over $ 600 USD .	St
1.5.7	The prices will drop predictably over time , as earlier versions did , so most people wait on new standards until they are affordable .	St
1.6.1	For Windows 98 , ME , 2000 , or XP Home/Pro , all these operating systems run great games with 512MB of RAM with a graphics card , either AGP or PCI Express with 128 MB of memory on board .	St
1.6.2	Right now , technology is at a crossroads , the new operating system ; Vistaaaaaa , ugh , supposedly uses a 1GB or RAM , so it might be a good idea to have 2 GB or more just in case , getting back to graphics ; Go with Nvidia or ATI for a graphics card , make sure your motherboard supports either AGP or PCI Express before you buy one .	St
1.6.3	Nvidia has already released their new line of graphic cards , ATI is about to release theirs around April .	St
1.6.4	I suggest waiting till ATI releases theirs , has the best graphics , or go ahead and get a Nvidia graphics card if you ca n't wait .	Sug
1.6.5	Remember , in terms of graphics , very few games even use 256MB of memory for both the computer and the GPU of the graphics card ; like the saying & quot ; If it ai n't broken , do n't fix it ! & quot ;	St
1.7.1	Like someone else said , check game requirements .	St
1.7.2	Obviously , the more RAM you have , the better some games will perform ( Battlefield 2/2142 eat RAM alive ) .	St
1.7.3	Both are pretty important , since a good videocard with no ram wo n't really help you , and a lot of ram with a junk video card wo n't run some games .	St
1.8.1	my comp .	St
1.8.2	as of now has 2 gigs of RAM and a 128mb ati standard video card that came with the desktop .	St
1.8.3	I 'm thinking about upgrading the video card now but I have no problems running games like counterstrike or battlefield on it .	St
1.8.4	But with Vista now out , 256mb video memory is the standard it seems .	St
1.9.1	having borderline amt of RAM to run the OS wo n't get any decent performance , or even ability to run games .	St
1.9.2	Having somewhat higher than the min will allow u to play lower-end/older PC games better , but which probably wo n't end up using the might of the muscular vid card since those games are n't likely to have great textures , graphics , lighting/shading , and other visual effects having a crappy vid card but lots of RAM , again probably limited to flash games and lower-end/older PC games .	St
1.9.3	Ditto if the vid card were slightly above low-end .	St
1.9.4	U 'd actually be able to play higher end games decentl , but with features and details turned off/down .	St
1.9.5	If it came down to these 2 , I would go latter for work , as generous RAM is certainly a performance/productivity booster .	St
1.9.6	For home , the former , as i would just upgrade RAM right away , which is the easier of the 2 to upgrade .	St
1.10.1	I play The Sims2 a lot .	St
1.10.2	I started with the base game , 256MB RAM , and an on-board video card with 64MB shared .	St
1.10.3	The base game was not too bad , but it took a player a while to cross a room .	St
1.10.4	When the expansion packs started coming out , I crashed lift , right , and center , until I added a 1GB stick to my computer .	St
1.10.5	What a difference in speed , until the game ate up all of my CPU resources , so I knew it was time for an independent video card .	St
1.10.6	I went to the website for The Sims2 , and printed out their requirements .	St
1.10.7	I then ran the Direct-X to see what I actually had .	St
1.10.8	I took both papers into the place that custom-builds my computers for me , showed them the list , and told them how much money I had to spend .	St
1.10.9	I walked out with an ATI Radeon 9250 , with 128 MB of RAM , and the game runs very smooth , and I can actually see blades of grass , fine patterns on furniture , and actual patterns on wallpaper .	St
1.10.10	Total cost for the 1GB RAM= $ 70.00 CDN ; video card was $ 40.00 Cdn .	St
1.10.11	Soon , for the next EP ( Seasons ) , I will need a better processor ; mine is 1.2 GHtz , which is 0.2 GHtz over the latest EP ( Pets ) , so that is when I will fall into trouble .	St
1.10.12	Good luck .	Polite
1.11.1	xp will run good with 1gb .	St
1.11.2	If you already are a gig or more , go for the video card .	St
1.11.3	WHY ?	Ques
1.11.4	XP 'likes ' about 1gb of memory to stay out of the swapfile .	St
1.11.5	Any time xp reads/writes to the swapfile , everything stops ... A 8800gtx wo n't help here ...	St
1.11.6	It will just look great while waiting for the swapfile to finish .	St
1.11.7	If you have LESS than 1gb of memory , forget about the video card and buy as much memory as you can afford ( and what your computer can use ) .	St
1.11.8	1gb is my minimum , with 2gb being a sweet spot .	St
1.12.1	BOTH !	St
1.12.2	You ca n't really choose between RAM and a good GFX card for excellent gaming experience .	St
1.12.3	Both of those two work together to deliver great graphics .	St
1.12.4	For example , I have 1gig of RAM and I used to have a GeForce 6600 128MB .	St
1.12.5	Playing the Sims 2 was sweet , even with the expansions installed .	St
1.12.6	There was very little lag , and I spent hours in front of the computer .	St
1.12.7	When I would play Counter-Strike : Source , it looked great .	St
1.12.8	I even used that HDR ( I think , you know that stuff where it was featured in Half-Life : Lost Coast ) and it was playable with no lag .	St
1.12.9	So you really ca n't choose .	St
1.12.10	: P	St
