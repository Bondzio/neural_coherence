os 10.3.9, 1.07 ghz ppc g4, 256 mb ram.
on ata-3 bus is the matshita cd-r, dvd rom drive that came with the ibook.
my dvd 109 is enclosed in a macally 500bc enclosure, firewire.
system profiler shows it on the firewire hardware.
when i insert a blank cd, however, and drop files into toast titanium 6, & clik burn, i get word that the tray is open, even though it's closed.
any ideas?
thanks.
