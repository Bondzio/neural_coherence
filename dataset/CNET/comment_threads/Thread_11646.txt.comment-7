What you'd want to do is go from the wall sockets to a patch panel and following the proper wiring scheme.
Generally, I use and see most often is the &quot;B&quot; scheme...and it needs to be the same on both ends of the cable.
When you buy standard patch cables, they are almost always made in this fashion.
A crossover cable is simply a &quot;B&quot; at one end and an &quot;A&quot; at the other.
My guess is that you've got this crossed at some point and can possibly verify this by using a crossover cable from your PC to one of your &quot;dead&quot; wall outlets.
If it works with a crossover cable, something got wired backwards.
Good luck.
