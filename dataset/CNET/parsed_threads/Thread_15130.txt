<s> We are running WinXP we have a cable connection to the Dlink DI-524 router. </s>
<s> Our LAN consists of two desktops wired to the router, one wireless laptop, and a wireless Xbox Adaptor model: MN-740. </s>
<s> The Xbox adaptor only has WEP security (not WPA). </s>
<s> I live in a densely packed neighborhood and at any time there are strangers using my wireless router because I have no security enabled. </s>
<s> I have tried to secure the network, following the Dlink instructions, but always end up with one problem when I enable WEP security: The Xbox Live cannot access the internet, even after adding the WEP key into the XBox security section. </s>
<s> Please tell me very simply how to enable my Dlink WEP security and how to make it work with the Xbox adaptor. </s>
<s> One more thing, when I look on the DI-524 info on the HOME, DHCP page, only the computers are listed, the Xbox is not listed, is the the cause of my problems and if so, how do I add the XBox to this page? </s>
<s> Sorry to add to my question, but would MAC filering help solve this problems, and if so, how do I do it? </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> the way the Forum Sticky suggests. </s>
<s> Rick </s>
<s> please tell me where in the sticky it explains how to get the XBox live to work while securing the Dlink router. </s>
<s> I see it says Mac filtering is a joke, and Wep isnt very much better. </s>
<s> How to I add the ip address of all four of my systems to a safe zone so I can lock out everyone else? </s>
<s> I cannot figure out how to add my 3 computers into the firewall rules list--funny the Xbox IP is already listed. </s>
<s> I read Di-links instuctions on setting up the di-524 firewall but they did not include much details and I got lost, for example, what do I chose for my Destination? </s>
<s> What are my port numbers? </s>
<s> The TCP ports seem to be 1033-51652 but that doesnt sound right. </s>
<s> I need to be walked through the steps as I just cannot get it. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> Wait, that's worse than trying to block by MAC address. </s>
<s> The sticky is our hard earned advice won from far too many calls in the field. </s>
<s> Please set it all up with WPA now and you'll not find anyone mooching on your connections. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You download and install the firmware for your wireless router, make and model, from manufacturers website http://support.dlink.com/products/revision.asp?productId=DI-524 Since you already made an attempt to do this, Change your SSID(this will make it easier to connect) Broadcast SSID Use WPA security Use mixed b and g mode(n if applicable) Use channels 1, 6 or 11. </s>
<s> Most devices work better on these channels, like Xbox and other game systems. </s>
<s> Now save and exit. </s>
<s> restart your computer. </s>
<s> Now each computer needs to go to available networks connect and enter your passkey/password. </s>
<s> This also has to be done for the game system. </s>
<s> You're secure and every can connect and be happy. </s>
<s> If usinf a wireless printer or print server, you'll also have to change this. </s>
