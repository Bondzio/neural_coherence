However, I'd like to be able to have a wireless network in my apartment, but somehow use the wireless internet throughout my building. So, basically, I'd like to be able to have a wireless network in my home so that I could share files from my ps3 and my two computers wirelessly, but with those on that same network still be able to access the internet connection through out the building. Is this possible? Thanks in advance! Matt

If the wireless system at your apartment does as well then you might be in business. Note I said might. Check with the property manger. Wireless ethernet comes in two forms external that requires a cable and internal that is a PCI card. This second form does not. If you have a 56k modem in your machine you can take it out and put the ethernet card in this slot. Make sure you disable the 56k unit in &quot;hardware devices&quot; though. Doing this will safe you a slot you may need later and reduce energy demands on your machine. While you have the case open, buy a can of compressed air and clean out the dust inside your system, especially in and around the CPU. This doesn't sound important but it is, do this. Try to keep your hands off metal parts while inside the case. All of these items are fairly simple to do and require no tools and should take only a few minutes to perform. Go internal it will save you the price of the cable. Go external if your computer is still on warranty.

I was thinking i might be able to get the signal from my desktop's wireless and then connect to a seperate router wired and then bridge the connections. I dont know how stable that would be, plus how much of a pain in the butt it would be to keep my loud desktop on. I know they have wireless bridges such as the linksys wet45g but that one you have to connect it wired to the other wireless router before being to bridge them wirelessly

I'll supply an example monetarily. That unit would be placed where it gets the best signal. Porch, wall, closet (wherever). Now we have a client we run that to our usual WIFI ROUTER's WAN port. Now it looks just like any common internet service. Bob

I just dont know if the speed i get will be fast enough, especially for gaming... 1500 kbps down and only 100 kbps up. let me know what you think.
