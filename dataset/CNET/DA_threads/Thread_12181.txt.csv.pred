1.1.1	I dumped DSL internet for Cable internet.	St
1.1.2	I have a 3 story house.	St
1.1.3	My old setup was: Telephone DSL to modem to Wireless &quot;N&quot; Router w/ 4Ethernet ports.	St
1.1.4	Wired connection to Main computer(Top floor), Powerline connections(House wiring) to other Desktops down stairs(1st., 2nd.	St
1.1.5	floors).	St
1.1.6	And a few wireless iPods, Laptops/Netbooks on all 3 levels.	St
1.1.7	Good wirelss signal in center of house(all 3 levels).	St
1.1.8	I had some Blind Spots at the far end of the house on bottom floor.	St
1.1.9	My NEW setup: Cable Company's Cable modem and Wireless Router connected to Main computer(3rd.	St
1.1.10	floor).	St
1.1.11	Powerline connection to down stairs desktops like before.	St
1.1.12	Same Blind Spots as before but now I have my old &quot;N&quot; Router collecting dust.	St
1.1.13	QUESTION: Can I add my old &quot;N&quot; router to my new network down stairs to get rid of the Blind Spots?	St
1.1.14	Kind a like a WiFi Repeater?	St
1.2.1	Maybe but most likely not as simple as just using it as a repeater.	St
1.2.2	Most cannot do that, it takes 2 radios to do it one to receive and another to transmit.	St
1.2.3	Your best bet is to try to connect it with a cable.	Sug
1.2.4	Next option is to connect it to your powerline connections.	St
1.2.5	You want to use the LAN ports, check out the sticky in the forum for comments about using 2 routers and how to connect them.	St
