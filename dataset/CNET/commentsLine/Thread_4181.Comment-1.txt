i getting a used 2800+ 333 of ebay.
i know its not the latest.
but it is 333mhz.
my board will take it.
but i'm still using 266 ram.
i forget do i have to get 333 ram?
or can i use the 2 512mb 2100 266 ram i have?
it'll be a little bit slower.
but will it still work or do i have to get 333 ram?
or i can under clock.
the bios allows me to set the cpu at 100, 133, or 166. don't know if under clocking is safe.
i know overclocking is not but under clocking?
