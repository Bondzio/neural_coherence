hello everyone, i'm in the process of configuring my first custom build.
this system will be used for 3d graphics.
i hope to configure a system that will be able to be upgraded with newer parts as prices fall in the future.
i can't justify spending more than $1100.
can you computer gurus out there have a quick look and let me know if i am mismatching.
or, if you have any suggestions, i am more than happy and greatful to know what you think.
thanks allot guys!
