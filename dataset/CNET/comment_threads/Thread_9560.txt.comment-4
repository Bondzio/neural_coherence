Since most OSes have a scheduler it seems that all we need is to write the script to do the work then put it in the scheduler.
That could be as simple as one line of script and one scheduled event.
-&gt; Why would we turn this into some app with GUI and maybe add some skeuomorphism on top?
That's why I think this is something of an app you may want to have written just for you.
