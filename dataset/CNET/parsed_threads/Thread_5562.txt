<s> I have two laptops; one is a Mac and the other a PC. </s>
<s> My wife and I have a good collection of music together, but each of us has our own iPods and playlists. </s>
<s> Therefore, with my modest knowledge I thought it would be a good idea to have an external shared drive where we could store all our files and access them from either or both laptops. </s>
<s> The idea is to use that external hard drive wirelessly as you would use an internal one, in each of the laptops. </s>
<s> My question is, is this possible? </s>
<s> If so, which one would you recommend? </s>
<s> We are looking into buying something with 500GB. </s>
<s> I was especially interested in a Western Digital, but I have read so many bad reviews, and as you could probably tell by now I am not enlightened with computer knowledge I appreciate all the help! </s>
<s> My Linksys WRT350N has a USB-2 port. </s>
<s> I plug my external USB-2 &quot;stuff&quot; drive into it and it becomes a network drive. </s>
<s> It is seen by all my PCs (4, one wireless laptop) and is exactly what you're looking for. </s>
<s> Drives? </s>
<s> I'm partial to Seagate. </s>
<s> I have an 80 Gig unit in the USB case, it's perpendicular recording is fast. </s>
<s> I just purchased this 160 Gig http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16822148212 as I'm running out of space on the 80. </s>
<s> Seagate has many choices here http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=50001305+40000014&Manufactory=1305&SubCategory=14&SpeTabStoreType=0 up to a TeraByte. </s>
<s> a nas is basically an external hard drive that you connect to over a network. </s>
<s> since you want to go wireless, that will drive up the price a bit. </s>
<s> here's a linksys unit without hard drive for $120: http://www.buy.com/prod/linksys-nas200-network-storage-system-with-2-bays/q/loc/101/205689222.html here's a dlink version for $90: http://www.buy.com/prod/network-storage-adapter-usb-2-0-to-fast-ethernet/q/loc/101/10381289.html it needs an external usb drive so once you add the usb enclosure to the price it's not really cheaper than the linksys which has 2 internal bays. </s>
<s> where have you read bad reviews about western digital? </s>
<s> i recommend them almost exclusively. </s>
<s> but here's a 500gb hitachi for $99: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822145137 </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Thanks to all who posted answers to my question. </s>
<s> I think I made up my mind and I will buy a NAS from LaCie and plug it directly to my modem. </s>
<s> That way it will solve my problems, hopefully. </s>
<s> I might ask for help when installation happens... </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
