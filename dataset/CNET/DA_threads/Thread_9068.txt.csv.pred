1.1.1	I am going to start building a gaming PC and I want to know what you guys think about some of the things that I might get as of right now.	St
1.1.2	Here they are: Video Card: XFX PVT84GUDD3 GeForce 8600GTS 256MB GDDR3 PCI Express x16 HDCP Video Card -($224.99) Processor: AMD Athlon 64 X2 6000+ 3.0GHz Socket AM2 Processor - ($169.99) RAM: WINTEC 2GB (2 x 1GB) 240-Pin DDR2 667 (PC2 5300) Dual Channel Kit Memory - ($77.99) Hard Drive: Western Digital Caviar SE16 500GB 3.5&quot; SATA 3.0Gb/s Hard Drive - OEM - ($109.99) Motherboard: ABIT IB9 ATX Intel Motherboard - ($86.99) All of this is from newegg.com and that is just a start that I have going right now.	St
1.1.3	I was just wondering what you guys thought of that stuff and if you have any ideas of things that I am going to need to play some awesome games.	St
1.1.4	I am going to play games like F.E.A.R., Rainbow Six Vegas, Battlefield 2142, Call of Duty 4 when it comes out, and other games like that.	St
1.1.5	Help me out please.	St
1.1.6	THANKS everyone!	St
1.2.1	http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/07/03/the_best_gaming_video_cards_for_the_money/page2.html writes about a DDR3 8600GT for about 100 bucks less.	St
1.2.2	I'd be surprised if you are getting 100 bucks more performance.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	i know it's factory OC'd to 730mhz, but it's still not worth $230 considering most 8600GTS's will easily OC to 710mhz.	St
1.3.2	here's one for $165 with a $15 rebate.	St
1.3.3	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130084 the 8600GTS won't play most dx10 titles at acceptable framerates.	St
1.3.4	http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.aspx?i=3029 so why not stick with a dx9 card that will run outperform it... like the geforce 7900GS or radeon x1950pro.	St
1.3.5	$165 will get better performance in the games you mentioned.	St
1.4.1	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127286 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130085 I'm sure there are a few more out there.	St
1.4.2	Bob	St
1.5.1	I didn't really know if I needed a high priced, top of the line video card since those games are pretty new and pretty high graphics.	St
1.5.2	All I really want is to play all of those games VERY smoothly.	St
1.5.3	Everything else is good though?	St
1.5.4	Or what?	St
1.5.5	Anything else that you would suggest?	St
