the wireless access point have be connected to the modem .. since the modem only have one port, you need a router, to be able to connect your brother pc and your wireless access point... unless its a modem/router combo.. modem --&gt;&gt; router --&gt;&gt; pc and wireless access point (each connected to the router port)
