Hello, i was hoping someone could help suggest what kind of ram i should be using with a Gateway Intel Core 2 Quad Processor Q6600 (2.4GHz,1066MHzFSB,8MB).
The ram i have in it is value ram and it sucks and is super slow still with games and other programs.
So if anyone can help me out i would appreciate it.
Thank You.
