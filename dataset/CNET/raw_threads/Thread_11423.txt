The perfect one for my needs seems to be the sx2840. It is a great computer for the price and performance you get. But, since I have $600 in Bestbuy gift cards and they do not carry this Gateway model, I am having a hard time deciding what to do. They do however carry the DX4831-01e for a great price. Both computers seem VERY similar (CNET gave the SX2840 slightly better reviews) so my question is, what is the main difference between these computers? And am I going to be dissapointed with going with the DX instead of the SX??? Any advice would be great. Thanks, Chris

Proffitt	4/17/10 8:53 AM	1.27149438E12	Hmm, the DX4831-01e looks	To be a bit beefier with more weight, larger power supply, more PCI slots, one more USB port and such. The rest is identical. The i3 CPU is a nice choice over the older core 2 duo and even older machines. Sounds like a nice machine. No 3d card but there is a slot for one! Bob
