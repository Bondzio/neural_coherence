Can connect each individually through USB with no problem. If ipod is plugged in while external hard drive is connected, Windows XP indicates &quot;USB Device not recognized&quot;. Likewise if ipod has been connected by itself working fine, then connect external drive, ipod no longer recognized. Can someone help??

With XP SP1, USB 2.0 started to function but we couldh't run CHKDSK on the USB 2.0 hard disk. Finally with XP SP2 we could run CHKDSK on out USB 2.0 hard disks. Your post didn't note the SP1 or SP2 and many won't install SP2 (their choice). I can only share that some fixes were in SP2 but I can't find a document revealing what Microsoft fixed. This is not an offer to fix your issue, but a comment about SP1, SP2 and how it matters in USB 2.0 Bob

My problem was intermittent in that sometimes my computer could recognize both USB devices at the same time, but most of the time it couldn't (very infuriating). I believe I've fixed it by uninstalling Itunes and Ipod updater, installing the latest Bios Update and the Dell Notebook System Software, and reinstalling itunes and ipod. Go to http://support.dell.com/support/downloads/ select you computer and OS and find both updates under the following: FlashBIOS Updates Dell Latitude D610 System BIOS System and Configuration Utilities Dell Notebook System Software Hopes this helps I finally came upon this solution after trying everything else on the apple website.

I tried updating my computer by installing &quot;USB 2.0 driver version 2.7&quot; but when i restarted the computer the problem still existed. I would appreciate it greatly if anyone knows what to do.

The same goes with DX 10, why not release the driver for xp? Well, mr bill wants you to buy vista, thats all. Anyhoo, USB 2.0 is supported with any service pack, please go here http://support.microsoft.com/kb/329632

In XP SP1 some of our external hard disks would mysteriously need a chkdsk. After SP2 that problem vanished but we never could tell exactly where in the release documents Microsoft tweaked that.
