sorry i thought i had posted that info.
i also was wrong on what dell it is.
it's actually dimesion 4550 not a inspiron (that is my laptop).
not sure if it's any help as i didn't post it but the audio device is unimodem half duplex audio device.
i'll give dell a try and post whatever results i get.
