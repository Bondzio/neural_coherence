1.1.1	I 'm living temporarily in an apartment complex where one of my neighbors has thoughtfully installed an open WiFi access point , which I am happy to use .	St
1.1.2	But it does n't work all the time .	St
1.1.3	Sometimes it 's fine , and sometimes there 's no signal at all .	St
1.1.4	( But even if I get no reception in my apartment , I know the transmitter is on because if I take my laptop down the hall , it picks up the neighbor 's signal loud and clear . )	St
1.1.5	Is there a stronger *receiving* antenna that I can install in my apartment so I can always pick up the neighbor 's signal ?	Ques
1.1.6	All the repeaters and extenders I see advertised seem to apply to the sender 's location .	St
