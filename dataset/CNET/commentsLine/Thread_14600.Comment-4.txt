take a can of air or air hose and with no ac power applied, simply whirl the fan with the air.
if it makes the noise, then you have a bad fan.
if you recently got this new, then see what the warranty issues are, return it.
, etc.. however, if the that poster is correct then i suspect that brand psu model may have noisy fans and even the replacement one is going to be noisy.
so consider yet another in its place, providing you get credit, etc and buy a better psu or just another brand of similar rating.
