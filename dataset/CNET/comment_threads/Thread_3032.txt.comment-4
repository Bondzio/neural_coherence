I once had a similar problem.
The issue was not with the physical set-up but with the firewall software (e.g., Norton Security, Black Ice, etc.)
I had installed on the machines.
If you're running one of these programs, you should go into the scren that allows you to allow or add &quot;friendly&quot; IP addresses.
Just type in the IP address of your printer (e.g., 192.168.1.100) and hopefully you'll set up program will now be able to &quot;see&quot; the networked printer.
Good luck...
