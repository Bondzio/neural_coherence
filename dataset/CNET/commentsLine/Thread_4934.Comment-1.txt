i see that this card is not listed on creative site as being compatible with xp.
i find this hard to believe.
can i use this card with windows xp?
the onboard sound i have sucks and i am contemplating buying one of these from ebay cheaply.
i do not have it yet so i need to know this ahead of time.
tick tick tick.
