hello, i am new to this forum, and building computers.
i just finished my first build, and there is no picture, the fans just whirr and the motherboard led lights.
here are my specs: mobo: asus m5a78l-mx cpu: amd athlon ii x3 3.3ghz case: cit recon matx case ram: kingston valueram 2gb ddr3 1333mhz hdd: wd1200jb 120gb 7.2k rpm (this is rescued from an old dell dimension pc and fitted with an ide to sata adapter.
everything apart from the hdd is new.
i am using the integrated ati radeon 3000. they can be returned within 14 days as they are from amazon (.co.uk) and ebuyer.
i have tried removing the sata for hdd.
same problem.
i removed the ram and hdd.
same problem.
i reformatted the hdd in the old dell.
if i get the build working, it should display the no os detected bios message, like it did in the dell.
i will try any other suggestions.
thank you.
