1.1.1	I recently aquired a DELL Demension 8100 1.3mhz P4.When I opened it up and found there was no memory installed and after futher examiation noticed it used RDRAM.Now this PC will be used for everyday computing and The Sims 2 game.My question is how much RDRAM should I install it this PC ? I dont want to drop a whole lot of cash in this thing I jsut want it to run smoothly .	St
1.2.1	If Windows 2000 , maybe 256MB will do , but XP I 'd have 512M as the minimum .	St
1.2.2	FYI , the reason the poor machine was abandoned is likely due to what happened when the former owner learned about the cost of RDRAM .	St
1.2.3	Be sure to get PAIRS or the RDRAM since ... it 's installed in PAIRS .	St

1.3.1	RDRAM must be brought in & quot ; pairs & quot ; if you did n't know .	St
1.3.2	You probably have 4-slots of ram , but being pairs , you quickly fill half of that .	St
1.3.3	Dell , orginally shipped that system with 128mb -OR- 256mb as RDRAM was expensive and still is .	St
1.3.4	For all practical reasons , 256mb is a real must but 512mb is just dandy .	St
1.3.5	Cost for 1gb of RDRAM maybe too high , but ebay should have some reasonable vendors .	St
1.3.6	For the cost of RDRAM alone , you maybe better off buying a cheap entrylevel NEW system like eMmachine or Compaq , that 's pretty close to similar amounts of $ .	St
1.3.7	tada -- -- -Willy	St
