<s> I was thinking about getting a new PC for gaming and found this Lenovo http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883108591 and http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814162085 because its GFX card isn't good for gaming. </s>
<s> Is that a good gaming PC or could I get a better one in the $800-$1000 price range? </s>
<s> I also had my eye on http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883229283 but it got sold out last night. </s>
<s> That's not a gaming machine. </s>
<s> Your looking at an immediate swap of the psu and the gpu. </s>
<s> 300 extra bucks just to get it to a mid-range gamer. </s>
<s> Keep shopping. </s>
