usually somewhat more expensive.
They have the dual BIOS, but at least on the one that I use at work, the CMOS chips are soldered on the board.
I'm not certain that I would rather have a single BIOS on a plug in CMOS chip.
In emergency one can get a new chip.
The good thing is that their ITE gigaraid chip allows rhe ports to be used for ATA drives or ATAPI drives.
Don't get dual bios and dual channel memory mixed up.
The way to go from dual chamnnel memory setup would be to open the case and move one of the memory sticks to the non dual channel slot.
taint automatic.
