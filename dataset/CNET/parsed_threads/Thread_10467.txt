<s> I just got my router/modem today. </s>
<s> I hooked it up in one room and put the wireless connection on the other computer which is in the room next door. </s>
<s> The internet works fine on the computer that has the router/modem. </s>

<s> Sometimes the connection is there and sometimes it is not. </s>
