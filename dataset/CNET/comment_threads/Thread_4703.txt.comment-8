I agree with your points regarding the need for many to learn fundamentals and that many offer solutions which trade one problem for another.
My initial reply in this discussion was not an attempt to berate you or ''act as a self righteous ass.''
I was simply using a common English metaphor to respond to a set of statements that seemed either to be an orphaned reply or a frustrated rant.
I have no problems with either, especially since I have done both in one forum or another.
I thank you for clarifying the nature of your post.
