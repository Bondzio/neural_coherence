for work i'm using a dell precision m90 notebook with a nvidia quadro fx 2500m video card, and they just gave me a plug and play acer v223w 22&quot; lcd monitor to use with it.
in the display settings, the max 16:10 widescreen resolution is 1680x1050, with 1440x900 being the next step down.
when i set the resolution to 1440x900, the display fits on the entire screen and is not distorted, but i want better resolution.
when i switch to 1680x1050, the display fits vertically, but i lose some off the right edge of the monitor (the clock plus 1 tray icon).
when i move the cursor over there, it slides into view, but pushes the left side of the display off the screen (so i can't see the &quot;start&quot; button).
i've messed with the display settings in both the windows interface and the nvidia controls, but i can't get it to fit.
why would two resolutions with the same aspect ratio (16:10) produce different results?
is there anything i haven't tried to adjust it?
