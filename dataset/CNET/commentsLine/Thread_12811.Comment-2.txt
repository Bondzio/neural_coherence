or did this start out of the blue?
what cpu do you have and what memory speed.
if you set the memory speed too high for the cpu's fsb that would be your problem.
where did you get the cpu, possibly it is misbranded.
[a lower speed than advertised].
what is the amd model?
is it 2000+ or is it a 2400+ plus that runs at 2000 mhz???
i assume that you know how amd names their processors.
waiting to hear more.
