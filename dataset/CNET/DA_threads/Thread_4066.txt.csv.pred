1.1.1	Well , about ten minutes ago , I thought my rig was finished .	St
1.1.2	The CPU and soundcard came in today , and I was so excited .	St
1.1.3	To my shock , I found out that my mobo sports an older 9-pin analog video connector , called a DE-9 .	St
1.1.4	My flatscreen uses DE-15 pin .	St
1.1.5	My motherboard is an AM2 socket one with no integrated video .	St
1.1.6	I have a BioStar nVidia 8600 installed right now .	St
1.1.7	It has the traditional VGA 15 pin and DVI connections .	St
1.1.8	But when I plug my video cable from my monitor into the card , I get a & quot ; No Signal Found & quot ; error .	St
1.1.9	I KNOW the card is operating , because the fans are on .	St
1.1.10	I REALLY want to get this hooked up so I can install my OS .	St
1.1.11	Which leads me to my second problem , my disc drive wo n't open .	St
1.1.12	I have a traditional Molex power cable connected , and it 's receiving power from the PSU .	St
1.1.13	The ATA ribbon cable is connected to both the drive and the mobo , yet IT WONT OPEN THE DISC TRAY .	St
1.1.14	I really need help here .	St
1.1.15	I 'm panicking .	St
1.1.16	Have I done something wrong ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.17	Specs : BIOSTAR NF520-A2 SE AM2 NVIDIA nForce 520D ATX AMD Motherboard - Retail BIOSTAR V8602GT51 GeForce 8600 GT 512MB 128-bit GDDR2 PCI Express x16 SLI Supported Video Card - Retail Acer AL2216Wbd Black 22 & quot ; 5ms Widescreen LCD Monitor with HDCP support 300 cd/m2 700:1 - Retail	St
1.2.1	I have a correction to make , my disc drive is working now , as long as the ATA ribbon is n't plugged in .	St
1.2.2	As soon as I plug it in , it stops working .	St
1.2.3	I MUST be the mobo , or something related .	St
1.2.4	Are n't drives supposed to open as long as they have power ?	Ques
1.3.1	It sounds like no MB activity .	St
1.3.2	BTW , your 9 pin connector is likely comm port and not a video port .	St
1.3.3	Can you remove the MB from the case and put it on a tabletop ?	Ques
1.3.4	Connect the minimum components needed to attempt POST .	St
1.3.5	You 'll need RAM , the CPU and video card .	St
1.3.6	Make sure all power is connected including any additional connectors that might be needed for the video card and CPU .	St
1.3.7	Common causes of problems are pulled pins from connectors and unneeded standoffs on the MB panel that short out something on the back of it .	St
1.3.8	This is why we try it outside of the case first .	Sug
1.4.1	I 've done the POST multiple times , and I still get no beep codes .	St
1.4.2	Everything seems to be working fine .	St
1.4.3	Should I get another mobo ?	Ques
1.5.1	Pull it out hook it up as has been stated here in these forums many times ... with minimum hardware attachment and outside of the box .	St
1.5.2	It 's easy to make mistakes and , if you 're lucky , they wo n't be fatal .	St
1.5.3	Beep codes indicate an attempt to POST but errors were detected .	St
1.5.4	No beeps can mean POST did n't even start .	St
1.5.5	This could be a missing voltage level .	St
1.5.6	A simple DVM would be helpful if you have access to one .	St
1.5.7	Check and recheck your work .	St
1.5.8	Look for pins in the PS connector to the MB that pushed out of their socket .	St
1.5.9	Pull the CPU and see if any pins have been distorted .	St
1.6.1	changing the connection on your monitor settings , i bought two brand new hd3870 's running two monitors and there was no signal i then changed the signal on my monitor settings and got the picture back .	St
