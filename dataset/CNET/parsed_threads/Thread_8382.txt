<s> i have a DVD drive that is now only recognised as a CD-ROM when i select &quot;My Computer&quot; in Windows XP.It is recognised by Neros disc info tool as a DVD - it says it can play DVD- etc and if i uninstall then reinstall i get a message saying DVD-ROM found.So why isnt it recognised as a DVD, it will play CDs no problem.I have reset the CMOS , uninstalled then reinstalled the secondary IDE in Device Manager but to no avail,any advice how i can get this drive to play DVDs again? </s>
<s> This is OK if the item works, but it doesn't... </s>
<s> THERE IS NO HARDWARE ISSUE HERE. </s>
<s> What I usually have to do is to install the motherboard driver package... but you post didn't supply make or models numbers for the forum to work with. </s>
<s> Try that. </s>
<s> &quot; if i uninstall then reinstall &quot; WHAT? </s>

<s> OK , the motherboard is a pcchips m830lr.I have been to the website for drivers but could only see audio ,LAN and AGP drivers. </s>
<s> In short, without that chipset driver package its likely you will get reduced functionality. </s>
<s> Your board supplier should have given you the CD with the SIS 735 drivers. </s>
<s> If not, fish at http://www.sis.com/products/chipsets/oa/socketa/735.htm Bob </s>
<s> This is getting very strange ..... the DVD drive will now play DVD movies , but will not read DVD-R discs that have been burned on a friends machine ( these DVD-R discs do play on other PCs ok though),Nero info tool says it should play them.Now when the DVD and my Samsung SW-252 CD-RW are both connected the Samsung will not work - there is an exclamation mark in Device Manager and it does not show in &quot;My Computer&quot;.When it is connected on its own it is fine , but when both are connected the CD wont work.Why wont both work when both connected? </s>
<s> One must follow the IDE &quot;rules&quot;. </s>
<s> If not, IDE devices do not work together. </s>
<s> As to the DVD-R, not all drives read/play recorded media. </s>
<s> Reasons abound, but the most usual is... the drive is getting old or had dust on the laser lens. </s>

<s> The DVD is set to master and the CD is slave ( i have also tried the other way round) , the IDE cable came with the DVD and was fine before.Oddly when the CD was master and the DVD was slave the CD showed as a &quot;Local Disc&quot; in &quot;My Computer&quot; and with a big red question mark on it </s>
<s> I found that when such don't play together, one of the drives has failed or just is incompatible with the other drive. </s>
<s> But a magic procedure I use is: 1. </s>
<s> Set drives to Cable Select. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Use a shiny new 80 conductor cable. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Update each CDRW and DVD drive FIRMWARE per the maker's instructions. </s>
<s> For me, this works well. </s>
