many times the online manual has additional information that the printed manual didn't include at the time as new issues arise for their products.
as long as you are at the manufacturer sites (both mobo and video card), check for any updates to the hardware that there might be available such as newer drivers or patches that correct issues and problems they have discovered since the hardware was first sold.
