<s> hi guys, i was wondering if you can help me. </s>
<s> the problems started when i was was using my old motherboard which was an abit AN8 32x. </s>
<s> i couldnt boot my pc. </s>
<s> i replaced the motherboard and everything worked fine for about about 4 months now. </s>
<s> today i was browsing the net and i installed some software that needed a reboot. </s>
<s> i clicked restart and no response. </s>
<s> (this has happened intermittently since i first build my pc) so i pushed the power button and it eventually closed down. </s>
<s> once i booted the machine started.. my graphics card hsf stayed on a high rpm and didnt slow down which it usually does after 5 seconds, no display on the screen. </s>
<s> the power button on my monitor was flashing. </s>
<s> i unplugged it from the mains and disconnected my mobo for 1 min then reset the cmos, reconnected the mains and switched the power switch on and off and eventually it booted, with great difficuilty. </s>
<s> when it started to boot i got a screen saying overclocking failed, i pressed f2 to load defaults and it booted. </s>
<s> (this isnt the first time and i dont alter BIOS setting except boot device when i reformat) no running problems at the moment apart from a few things. </s>
<s> i have just done a fresh install of windows about a week ago and since ive had 'new hardware found.' </s>
<s> one for my plug and play monitor and another for pci device. </s>
<s> i have installed all the drivers for these obviously after the format but it still comes up. </s>
<s> the problem is with my old motherboard this is exactly what happened before it stopped working. </s>
<s> my system spec is as below. </s>
<s> Windows XP 5.1 build2600 sp2 AMD Athlon 4000+ ASUS A8R32-MVP 32 Delux (Bios Version 2.3, as of 29/3/06) ***My current mobo. </s>
<s> Hitachi Deskstar T7K250 250GB (HDT722525DLAT80) ATI Radeon x1900xtx Viewsonic VSC0F1C X-Fi Blaster card v5.5 is there any suggestion on what can be causing this problem? </s>
<s> as it seems to be happening with two different types of motherboards. </s>
<s> also if its any use i hear the mobo i got needs a bios update, which i havent done yet. </s>
<s> im relatively new to pc's so go easy guys =) </s>
