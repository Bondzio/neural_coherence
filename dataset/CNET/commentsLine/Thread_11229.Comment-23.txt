just as a test, i used the stock ram and the 512 ram by themselevs and for both, the computer has never shut down or a game closed.
i think it is because the mhz difference.
the crap stock 256 ram is 266 mhz and the good $150 kingston 512 ram is 400 mhz so now i will just leave the 512 in until i buy another one.
