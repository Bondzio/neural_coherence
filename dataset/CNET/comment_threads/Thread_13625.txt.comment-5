That didn't fix it..
I think it is because the modem is also a router itself (if that is the correct way to call it).
Based on another suggestion, I turned my new Wi-fi router into a WAP and now it works (connect the modem cable into one of the LAN ports), though the speed seems to be reduced...
IT is weird because with my old Wi-Fi router I there was no prblem ....
