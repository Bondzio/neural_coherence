While Symantec has articles on this such as http://service1.symantec.com/SUPPORT/powerquest.nsf/docid/2004050915514062?Open&src=sg&docid=2004050915325762&nsf=powerquest.nsf&view=docid&dtype=&prod=PartitionMagic&ver=8.0&osv=&osv_lvl=&seg= it sometimes is worth asking if you lost the manual or are using a TRIAL VERSION.
