<s> http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareList?os=228&lc=en&cc=us&dlc=en&product=1843728&lang=en Yup, no motherboard driver package. </s>

<s> Read http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7587_102-0.html?forumID=69&threadID=271360&messageID=2699006#2699006 and notice that HP may hide the drivers we are looking for off the main site. </s>
<s> You make the call. </s>

<s> HP support basically came to the conclusion that the laptop needs to be seen by a professional to determine if the ports are actually fried. </s>
<s> I have done everything drivers, bios and chipset wise that I could short of just totally wiping the OS and starting fresh. </s>
<s> That shouldn't be necessary. </s>
<s> I was looking @ some of the POST motherboard test cards. </s>
<s> Any thoughts? </s>
<s> I boot up my handy LiveCD of Linux. </s>
<s> Currently I use the latest UBUNTU and see if some USB mouse works. </s>
<s> The &quot;other&quot; test I do is to slip in a new hard disk. </s>
<s> Then use the restore CDs. </s>
<s> Sometimes we find the OS is so damaged that no one will pay for the hours or days to hunt down what's busted. </s>
<s> Booted into Knoppix Linux and plugged in the usb drive. </s>
<s> Said &quot;Port 1 reset error - 110.&quot; &quot;hub_port_status failed (error - 32).&quot; &quot;Cannot enable port 1. </s>
<s> Maybe the usb cable is bad?&quot; I'm not a Linux person (headed in that direction though) so I'm just guessing that it's saying that there's a problem with the usb ports (tested all 3, same result). </s>
<s> Any other opinions? </s>
<s> The USB ports were disabled in the BIOS. </s>
<s> Knoppix actually gave us a fine clue! </s>
<s> I must have the cheapy bios because I don't have any mention of the usb. </s>
<s> The closest thing is the LAN. </s>
<s> That's it. </s>
<s> I checked Component Services in Administrative Tools. </s>
<s> The &quot;Universal Plug and Play Device Host&quot; is running and set to start automatically. </s>
<s> I plugged a usb wireless adapter in and the system shut down again. </s>
<s> I immediately suspect a bum OS install. </s>
<s> The motherboard driver package is the one I seek out and install. </s>
