<s> I have a fairly new desktop and a lap top, but I decided I wanted to try to fix up my 10 year old computer to use as a back up (for basic internet & word processing). </s>
<s> I decided to upgrade from the painful Windows 98 to XP, but now I can't install internet security or any sizable program. </s>
<s> I want to add memory but I am technically challanged. </s>
<s> Dad took it into Staples for me today but they didn't have anything for a computer that old & they didn't tell him what I would need. </s>
<s> I could look for something on ebay if I know what to look for. </s>
<s> I found the info that came with it: - Intel FC-PGA Plll 600 MHz Processor - 256K Cache - 64 Megabyte SDRAM (PC 100)! </s>
<s> - Western Digital 10 Gigabyte Hard Drive The motherboard was replaced several years ago. </s>
<s> I still have the box, it is Micro ATX. </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be appreciated. </s>

<s> Crucial.com , ebay, and more. </s>
<s> Some are cheap but take my advice and stick with 128MB or smaller sticks unless you get them for free. </s>

<s> You already know what ram to get, its SDRAM, in your case PC100, though PC133 can work as well. </s>
<s> You do need to know exactly by your mtrbd. </s>
<s> model specs just how much is ram is supported per ram slot and total amount. </s>
<s> Offhand, I suspect yours is 256mb per slot but again you need to verify that. </s>
<s> Check with the Intel support website for those details. </s>
<s> You can still find such ram but it maybe expensive as it NOT made anymore. </s>
<s> Though you should check: http://www.crucial.com for possible source and what you system is allowed. </s>
<s> For a win98 system, it would be best with 512mb(if applicable) but anything above 64mb is going to help. </s>
<s> To get XP installed on such a system with 64mb is a plus for you, but the real addition of more ram has to be done for XP. </s>
<s> I would shoot for 512mb but if possible 1gb, again provided it is supported. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> go to crucial.com and let them figure out what you need. </s>
<s> when/if you're ready to buy, check here for cheaper alternatives: http://www.geeks.com/products_sc.asp?cat=719 </s>
<s> Thank you, that was perfect. </s>
<s> Crucial.com told me everything I need to know and more! </s>
<s> That was too easy. </s>
<s> I think I'll upgrade my newer computer too. </s>
