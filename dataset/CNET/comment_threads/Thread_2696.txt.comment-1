I have a Western Digital 80gb drive that i was using as an external drive.
I took the drive off for a bit and I believe I even placed some of my friends files on there so that I can back up his drive.
WEELLL now that I have placed the drive back into the casing to make it a external hard drive again, nothing picks up, i made sure all the jumpers where in place correctly and nothing.
when placing the drive into my pc as a slave this is what i see WDC$WD84VFB-04CEA6 $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ 17.47W17 and then my machine will not boot up.
I take the drive off and i am able to get into my computer.
I have alot of pics on that drive including of my late mother that just recently passed away and some of my exfiance, yeah i know shes my ex but I still like too see her pics and I have other personal pics on there.
Is there ANYTHING that can be done????
Please let me know
