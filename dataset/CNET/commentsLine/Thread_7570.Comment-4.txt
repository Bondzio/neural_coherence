alot depends on the game involved, it will do one of these things: not install, autoselect a lower setting, or if installed, not allow any higher setting until the requirements are fully meant.
some games offer clues to resolve problems and continue to play but don't expect the best performance when your system is meeting only minium levels and certainly if not that, some problem will arise.
