<s> I have a Netgear wireless router model WGR614v4. </s>
<s> Recently I signed up for SBC DSL service, the modem that comes with the plan has 1 lan port, quite ridiculous was my first thought. </s>
<s> Anyway, I want to connect my wireless router (which also has 4 lan ports) to the DSL modem, and make the wireless router a DHCP server (as a desktop has to connect somewhere, right?). </s>
<s> My current planned setup (which has not worked) is telephone cable from wall to DSL modem - cat5 cable from DSL modem to Netgear WAN port - cat5 cable from Netgear port 4 (main configuration port) to Desktop computer. </s>
<s> Any ideas on what settings I need to change would be much appreciated. </s>

<s> NetGear's bridge mode did not work for me. </s>
<s> I tried all the fixes NetGear posted and none of them work, I sent the WGR614 back. </s>
<s> I tried a different solution. </s>
<s> First, connected the computer directly to DSL modem, I disabled the PPPoE feature from the DSL modem, enabled bridge mode. </s>
<s> Then I connected the DSL modem to Negear router, and from the router to the computer, and enabled the PPPoE sign-in feature in the WGR614 into DSL. </s>
<s> At the log-in for PPPoE in the WGR61 screen, put in your SBC ID and password (SBC ID is something like twocats@sbcglobal.net). </s>
<s> The WGR614 was still set to be the DHCP server. </s>
<s> I enabled the DHCP feature. </s>
<s> Keep in mind that after making each connection, I waited for some time (about 2 minutes). </s>
<s> After restarting the pc...it should take a few moments to start working. </s>
<s> When you go to 192.168.0.1 address it should go directly to the netgear router's admin page if you need to make any changes. </s>
<s> It worked for me. </s>

<s> This kinda normal for SBC Yahoo. </s>
<s> You need to connect with a PC first to setup the account, then logoff hookup the router and configure the router with your account info and then have the router logon to SBC. </s>
<s> Also about once every 3 months or so I can seem to get a conection. </s>
<s> So I logon with a PC then logoff and hookup the router again and it's fine. </s>
