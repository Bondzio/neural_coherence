I think I dropped my WD Passport, it was about a week ago and I was running around at work, and since then I can't get the drive to be recognised fully. Setup ACER 6950 Laptop - Vista HP SP1 Symptoms Under disk management, Vista can find a drive it calls Drive 1, Unknown, at first when I tried to reinitialize it said cannot find the sector requested, now I just get improper function error Not very scientific but I get the bing bong tones when it's plugged in and there is a drive to &quot;safely remove&quot;. It sometimes appears under disks in device manager and a USB mass storage device under USB I can also change the drive from performance to quick remove in the device properties Solutions I've tried Lying it on various sides, apparently that was a fix elsewhere Different USB cables, though no new ones but the symptons are the same and I can't believe that 3 cables would all have the same problem Any help or forum pointer would be amazing. I'm currently volunteering in Tanzania with no local expertises, slow internet connection and limited funds, but I need to get some important research papers off the drive and am considering paying for data recovery. Lesson learned not to leave important docs on drives. Cheers in anticipation. Trying all of the above on XP desktops

Beyond what's in this forum's top post about this you remove the drive from the case, place in a new case and hope. I won't duplicate the forum sticky contents here and for each new post. Then off to http://www.drivesavers.com Bob

Its not just some s/w corruption or glitch, true physical h/w is more likely at fault here. The other posters offered fixes but it still depnds on the HD itself has any chance of recovery. I include damage to the ext. case, its ports and/or electronics. Once you swap the HD itself to another ext. USB case, that's your LAST CHANCE as a end-user fix. If it does work then, then contact the pros to do this. Also, let's be clear as well, ALL ATTEMPTS at getting any data recovery under physical damaged condition may further corrupt or cause data damage beyond what was initially incurred. So don't proceed until you have some ext. case or kit to try it on. Don't be mislead into voodoo fixes as these can only further damage the ext. HD more, which is why I posted. good luck -----Willy
