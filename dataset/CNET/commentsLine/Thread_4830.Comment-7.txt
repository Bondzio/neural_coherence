we are building 2 towers, i am going to be using the cpu & psu from the tower that has been giving me problems.
i have other spare parts here, but i believe that is all i'll need.
and when did they change the oem?
why did they change it?
if your buying all the parts, have the knowledge to put it together, then why can't you use oem?
i don't understand why you can't use something you purchased.
that's almost like going out, buying a brand new car, but then told, you can't drive it or anybody your related to can't drive it.
anybody?
