<s> Hoping someone can help. </s>
<s> I've got a KV8-MAX3, it had been hanging intermittently and finally wouldn't boot the other day. </s>
<s> I popped open the case and found that the Northbridge fan had burnt out. </s>
<s> I replaced the fan and am still having the same issue. </s>
<s> The computer comes on, displays the Abit splash screen and just sits there. </s>

<s> After close to five minutes it proceeds to a 7F and displays a screen that says CMOS checksum error, defaults loaded. </s>
<s> Asks you to push F1 or delete. </s>
<s> The system doesn't repsond to any key presses. </s>
<s> I have tried clearing the cmos, replacing the battery and pulling memory modules. </s>
<s> I'm out of ideas here! </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>
<s> I jump in here because I see that no one has come to your rescue. </s>
<s> I am not really a &quot;techie&quot; and my mobo is an8 ultra, a very plain jane. </s>

<s> Much information there, I didn't read it all, but you might get some clue. </s>
<s> If you get it fixed, please post back and let us know what works </s>
<s> Got it fixed, turns out it was my ! </s>

<s> Bizarre symptoms, I was very close to buying a new board.. </s>
<s> I had an MSI motherboard with an Athlon 64 3000 CPU and it would hang on boot when it started the IDE detection process. </s>
<s> Turned out to be a failing/defective CD-DVD drive. </s>
<s> Once I disconnected the defective CD-DVD...it booted and worked flawlessly. </s>
