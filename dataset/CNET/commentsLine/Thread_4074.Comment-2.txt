all capital letters are too hard to read.
for 3 to 5 year games you best use a machine from that time.
an intel 2.8ghz dual core should be fine with 1 or 2gb ram and a newer video card.
i think this dell has a pcie slot so let me offer a card i would use -&gt;  this moves the video card up to game play standards without having to replace the computer's power supply.
be sure to see if the card mechanically fits.
