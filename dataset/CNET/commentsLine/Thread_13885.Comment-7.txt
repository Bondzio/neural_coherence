robert explained level 0 and 1; each of these require 2 (or 4 for more space) drives.
raid 0+1 is a combination of striping and mirroring and requires at least 4 drives -- two for the striping and two more to mirror the first two.
some mobos only support these choices.
raid levels 2, 3, and 4 are seldom used today, so i will not discuss them.
raid 5 is very popular; it is striping with distributed parity, and requires at least 3 drives.
raid 10 is another combo of striping and mirroring, but far superior to rsid 0+1.
personally, i would stay away from raid 0 -- the chance of a disk crash is doubled, and there is virtually no chance or data recovery.
i do not think the increase is speed is worth the risk.
although i use raid 1, be aware that it is not foolproof and is no substitute for regular backups.
this site provides excellent discussions of the various raid levels hope this helps frank
