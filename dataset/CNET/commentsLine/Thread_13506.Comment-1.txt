i am going to be setting up a wireless network for my daughter with 3 computers.
qwest will be supplying a dsl modem with a wireless router.
the first computer will be connected to the computer with a cat 5e patch cord.
there will also be a laptop and a desktop with wireless connection.
my question is, can the two wireless computers be configured to use the printer that will be hooked up to the wired computer?
i have done printer sharing before, but all computers were hard wired to the router and a network port on the printer.
can it be done?
and if so how do i set the computers up.
thanks in advance wayne
