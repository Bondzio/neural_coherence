<s> I just removed a laptop hard drive (HITACHI_DK23DA-30), and put it into an usb external enclosure. </s>
<s> When I plug it into a usb port of my Dell XPS M1210 machine (OS: Vista Home Premium), I was told the driver cannot be found. </s>
<s> But when trying with XP and Linux, the driver can be installed automaticaly without a problem. </s>
<s> Could anyone here give me some help on this issue, like where I can find the driver. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> The Vista is not installed by Dell. </s>
<s> Ask Dell for the &quot;other&quot; drivers for that laptop. </s>
<s> Or if you don't want to call it in, check dell.com for what Vista drivers they offer. </s>
