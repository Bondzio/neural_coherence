But what you need is to configure this is one thing and a google. Here's the thing -&gt; http://www.amazon.com/TRENDnet-Wireless-4-Port-Bridge-TEW-640MB/dp/B004FMI3DA Now you have 4 ethernet ports and if you want to add your router as a WAP (can't see why if you get the thing) then google this -&gt; How do I use a router as a WAP.

Since all I'm asking about and all I want to do is provide internet to my non-wireless equipped home computer using my Verizon mobile broadband device I'm wondering why I can't just buy a USB wireless adaptor and plug this into my home computer and send wireless to the computer from my Verizon device? or is there a reason to buy something else? thanks

If you want to add WiFi to your machine, yes that works but means we are not using the router. Bob
