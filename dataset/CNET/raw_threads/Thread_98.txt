I'm not upset but the IP routing and configuration seems to be the IP camera's downfall. That is, I find most folk don't want to learn all about routing and more. So for the time being there are NO units that avoid that learning curve. Folk either have to dive in and learn it or have the work done. --&gt; You noted only one or two criteria and my reply is about where I've seeing/hearing the complaints. Bob
