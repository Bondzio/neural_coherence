<s> Im wondering what will happen if you use more than 4gb Ram memory on a 32 bit OS? </s>
<s> Will the system crash or will the extra memory just be 'cut off' so the computer cant use the extra memory? </s>
<s> And if I buy 4x 1024mb RAM that will add up to 4096mb will that be counted as more than 4GB? </s>
<s> Sorry, but in today's Intel architecture machines it won't do any good. </s>
<s> In fact due to the design you find machines that hand 2.0 to 3.5GB to said 32bit OS. </s>

<s> Google away for the more than 3.5gb ram edit to your system. </s>
<s> That way you can boot your 32-bit with more than 4gb. </s>
<s> However, the OS will only use upto 3.5gb of ram, though under another MS patch it will report the full amount. </s>
<s> If not, then get the patch BUT it only reports the amount not its usage. </s>
<s> Without the edit, your system may hang or be slow, freeze, etc. </s>
<s> or simply work as the bios(maybe) also comes into play, but the OS is the main culprit. </s>
