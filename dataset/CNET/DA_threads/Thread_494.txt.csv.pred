1.1.2	I had to leave and shut it down the way I always do , properly .	St
1.1.3	When I attempt to reboot now I enter my password , my desktop background image appears and then it immediately says & quot ; saving settings & quot ; and returns to my password screen .	St
1.1.4	I have atempted to reboot in safe mode & quot ; Last known good starting point & quot ; , regular safemode and I get the same thing .	St

1.1.6	I am running a : SONY VAIO PCV-RX650 WinXP_SP2 Nvidia TNT 2 64/Pro GPU with 32mb 's of on board ram 512MB 's of system ram 80GB HD with 68 GB free space .	St

1.1.8	Would greatly appreciate it !	Polite
1.1.9	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	For example , the hidden 'administrator ' account ( default : no password ) you only see on the Safe Mode welcome screen .	St
1.2.2	Things like this are exactly the reason why it 's recommended to have 2 admin accounts available ( and reachable ) on a machine .	St
1.2.3	If one is corrupted ( that could be the case here ) you can use the other to make a new one , transfer files and continue as if ( practically ) nothing had happened .	St
1.2.4	Of course , if the corruption is on a 'deeper ' level , this wo n't help .	St
1.2.5	Kees	St
1.3.1	Only one Administrator account .	St
1.3.2	But problems occurs with all accounts created on machine .	St
1.3.3	Never read anything on that .	St
1.3.4	Thanks for input , will remember for future reference .	St
