<s> i'll be brief. </s>
<s> i have an emachine t 6216 with stock 300 watt psu. </s>
<s> want to upgrade psu. </s>
<s> found out through e machine tech support that my stock psu has a 90 mm fan. </s>
<s> i was going to purchase a new psu with a 120 mm fan. </s>
<s> now, i find many fans at tigerdirect with 80 mm fans. </s>
<s> will an 80 mm fan work for me? </s>
<s> will a 120 mm fan work for me? </s>
<s> what's the difference? </s>
<s> also, i do not have a SATA drive, but an IDE based hard drive, will a new psu include a cable for an IDE drive? </s>
<s> would love some closure on these questions. </s>
<s> thanks so much in advance, richard </s>
<s> I too have an Emachine. </s>
<s> Here's what I've learned: 1. </s>
<s> The T-series Emachines case is an odd size. </s>
<s> &quot;Generally&quot;, a regular ATX power supply will fit. </s>
<s> So look for just ATX. </s>
<s> The best thing to do is take some meaurements. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I purchased a Rosewill 450watt with a 120mm fan from Newegg awhile back. </s>
<s> The larger fan moves the air alittle better. </s>
<s> So, an 80mm or 120mm fan will work. </s>
<s> Doesn't matter. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Other thing, I noticed you were looking at a very popular Thermaltake powersupply. </s>
<s> This powersupply is alittle longer than most ATX power supplies and may not fit in your case. </s>
<s> I barely had clearance for my Rosewill when I installed it. </s>
<s> So the best thing to do is to take some meaurements. </s>
<s> Chances are an ATX powersupply will be alittle longer than you stock Emachine unit, and the Thermaltake will be even longer than that. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> You may notice there are different pin types, either 20 or 24 pins. </s>
<s> This is the connection that connects to your motherboard. </s>
<s> Most newer powersupplies will connect to both. </s>
<s> These feature a 4 pin section that will detach from the connector, making it a 20 pin. </s>
<s> So either way you're covered. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> Powersupplies will include connections for IDE and SATA drives. </s>
<s> Some are only IDE, however rarely do you find those that are just SATA. </s>
<s> 6. </s>
<s> If your buying a cheaper brand powersupply, like mine, do yourself a favor and buy a unit with more wattage than you need. </s>
<s> Most of these powersupplies are not making any where near the advertised power and ALL will deteriorate over time. </s>
<s> I'd say buy an extra 100-200 watts of power, just for some headroom. </s>
<s> 7. </s>
<s> Also another note on the cheapo supplies. </s>
<s> If you plan on using a power hungry Video card, make sure you buy 1 with a 12v rail and check the Amps on the rail to the specifications of the vid card. </s>
<s> That's about all. </s>
<s> clear, crisp, and concise. </s>
<s> brevity is genius. </s>
