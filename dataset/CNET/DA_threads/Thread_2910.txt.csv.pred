1.1.1	i installed windows server 2003 without realising that it would conflict with my main system which is windows xp 2002 are there any ways of removing the server version , as i can only find it after the bios boot up page appears then the system asks me which program to run on for about 10 seconds ?

1.3.1	there could be an answer .	St
1.3.2	try loading XP in the opearting system loader ( if the server runs without asking you , press F8 after boot ... ) In XP go to System Properties - & gt ; Advanced - & gt ; Starup and Recovery- & gt ; Settings .	St
1.3.3	There you could opt the operating system you need to load .	St
1.3.4	Press edit and delete the line wherein Windows Server 2003 is written .	St
1.3.5	Be Careful , for you can delete XP.. ( and if you did so , go to the same place in Win Server 2003 ) .	St
1.3.6	After deleting it from this bios line , you can easly delete it from the directory you 've installed it ... FYI , it 's not fully ! !	St
1.3.7	deleting it ... there are many places where WIN Server places itself , such as c : \Documents and Settings and many more ... . if you really need the space in your harddisk , take a day off and delete all of those appearances ... Bye	St
