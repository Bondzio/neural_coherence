<s> But i'm thinking in a year and half or two years am I going to wish I spent a little more and got the better system, faster CPU and better graphics card??? </s>
<s> Is it worth it spend that much more on the processor? </s>
<s> The socket for the i5 is actaully newer, so does that mean it will be more upgradable? </s>
<s> which one will likely be more upgradeable??? </s>

<s> dollar difference is about 600, and i will be doing some gaming </s>
<s> Don't over spend on these. </s>

<s> ?&quot; I'd bet that, if you spent the extra cash how, in a year and a half or two you'd be looking around at what's new and still be wanting a newer faster system. </s>
