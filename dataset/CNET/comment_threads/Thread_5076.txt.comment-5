My OS is Win XP pro with SP3.
I have a Sata disk 160 GB already where Win XP is installed.
I was installing an additional hard disk with a higer capacity for Data and back up.
According to the Seagate site, their Seatools will not detect a hard disk if it is not recognized by the Bios (mine does) or the drive does not spin up.

He has promised to replace the disk immediately.
A slightly higher price is worth it.
Thank you all.
