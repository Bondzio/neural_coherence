I just use my comp to play some halo I can play it now on meduim settings, and its fine. and maybe some other games like sims 2 this vid has alot of trouble with it, battlefront maybe (not much of a star wars fan) thx for ur help.

If you have XP uping the mamory to 512mb will help a lot. What MB do you have???? The swicth on the power supply is a voltage switch. There should be a label on the PSU that has it's rating. A 350w should be fine. A new card will run between $25 and $70. Most are ATI chipsets. But since this and older machine don't spend a alot on it.
