The other model number it goes by is PCG-2F1L. I have looked on Sony's webpage but they only offer a Users Guide and not a Reference Guide. I have removed a total of 18 screws (14 on the back, 4 on the bottom of the bezel.) However, the case is still firmly in place. Does anyone have any experience with this case or Sony AIO desktops in general? Any information that could help me get this case off is very much appreciated. Thank you so much for you time!

What that means is sometimes there are hidden screws that are revealed by removing some bezel or case molding. Usually, that includes usually the frt. cover or that around the display. This is all guess work, as you have to play with it. I use a thin steel ruler or nail file to help reach under the case molding and pop-out in order to reveal those screws. Other times, there are small &quot;rubber bumpers&quot; which the screws are located under. You have to pry those out and save them for return. googling helps here as it may give generic clues as to what to do as well. tada -----Willy
