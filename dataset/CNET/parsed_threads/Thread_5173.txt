<s> I'm trying to install an STLABS A-171 SATA controller on a FIC AZ11 motherboard. </s>
<s> The SATA card will provide me access to SATA disks, while the system needs to boot from an existing IDE disk or CDROM. </s>
<s> The system boots properly without the SATA card. </s>
<s> When I install the card after the BIOS, and the SATA card BIOS, I see a listing of all the devices. </s>
<s> The first showing is &quot;Mass storage controller&quot;, this is the SATA card, since this line does not show without it. </s>
<s> The controller is assigned IRQ 11 (same IRQ is also used by the network card, but I don't think this is a problem) What happens then is &quot;Verifying DMI pool data ...&quot; and that's it. </s>
<s> The system does not boot - it does not seek the CDROM nor the IDE HD. </s>
<s> It looks as if the SATA card blocks the system from using the IDE. </s>
<s> The IDE controller is the second device, and it is assigned IRQ 14. </s>
<s> I have tried installing the card at various PCI slots, but as long as it is recognized as a MASS storage controller, the system does not proceed to boot. </s>
<s> I'd appreciate any suggestions. </s>

<s> Those may be from the days before SATA and the BIOS not able to handle such. </s>
<s> It's going to come down to the BIOS, a bum SATA card or something this machine can't do. </s>
