i have been very happy with the color prints produced on the r800, until recently.
i'm getting a blue/green tint to all black and white prints, regardless of whether or not i &quot;remove color&quot;, take saturation to &quot;0&quot;, or do both.
i've always used the epson ink.
at this point, i've exhausted the traditional options to correct the probelm (ran all the utility clean-up prodcedures).
any suggestions?
