Is this a used hard drive with a previous installation of Windows?
If so, from XP and upward, it's not going to run on hardware other than that it was installed on.
Your best bet is to erase the drive by deleting all partitions first.
Then, boot from your Windows CD to begin the installation.
It will create the partition, format the drive, and install itself.
As long as the hard drive is recognized in the BIOS and compatible with your version of Windows, this should get you started.
Of course you'll need to have driver disks handy including those for the motherboard.
