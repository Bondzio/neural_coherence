1.1.1	Hello and thank you in advance for whatever help can be offered for us, we can't think of anything else to do... OK so my husband and I have many computers and work on a wireless network.	St
1.1.2	We live in a very large multi-unit building in a very large city.	St
1.1.3	We hadn't had any issues with connectivity for a while, but recently the PCs in the office cannot stay connected for more than a minute or two.	St
1.1.4	It happens to our two desktops and one laptop; the only computer that seems immune is the lone apple laptop.	St
1.1.5	The PC laptop has much less difficulty staying on when I sit in the room with the router.	St
1.1.6	The office is literally the next room over, less than 20 feet.	St
1.1.7	The network still shows up as an available network, it just won't connect.	St
1.1.8	All the impacted computers will be fine for maybe a minute and then will all drop out at the same time.	St
1.1.9	Rarely (like once in the past month) there will be no issues at all, and we can stay on all day.	St
1.1.10	We have changed the channel of it a few times, but there are at least 15 other networks nearby.	St
1.1.11	The router is relatively new, it is a Netgear Rangemax Duo wireless n-adapter.	St
1.1.12	We have gotten to the point where we have no idea where to go next.	St
1.1.13	My hubby is fairly tech savvy, but at work, and I am essentially clueless and frustrated.	St
1.1.14	I'm not sure what else would be helpful in understanding the problem.	Res
1.1.15	I would think it is somehow a router issue, since I can stay on ok while next to it, but then why is the apple immune?	St
1.1.16	I've scoured the forum for an hour or so, but I haven't seen anything related to multiple computers having issues simultaneously...Any ideas would be very helpful!	St
1.2.1	well this is kind of a rare issue.	St
1.2.2	it might be the apple is having the problem than the windows based PCs because its 2:1 but on your case its the other way around.	St
1.2.3	given the fact that you have changed the channels multiple times i bet you have tried this.	St
1.2.4	change the channel on the router from 6 to 11 or 1 and also try : changing the tx rate, lock it to 54 mbps each of the wireless device for windows based.	St
1.2.5	just try, then re post if it didn't work.	St
1.2.6	hope i help	St
1.3.1	I don't know what &quot;tx rate&quot; is, so I have no idea if it is locked at 54 mbps.	St
1.3.2	How/where do I check?	St
1.3.3	Tried just about every channel for the router; we are currently on &quot;4&quot; since it is the only channel that doesn't have anyone on it, but there are a few on 2 and a few on 5 and 6, so it's probably interacting... At least this is &quot;rare&quot; and not just us being stupid!	St
1.3.4	Thanks!	St
1.4.1	This is getting to be a more and more common question on this forum.	St
1.4.2	All I can do is guess the more common issues.	St
1.4.3	First make sure the firmware on your router is current there have been a number of bugs that can cause this but there are so many models of routers it hard to say if yours has any issues.	Sug
1.4.4	Next make sure you are using a different SSID than anyone else and you have set your PC to ONLY use your SSID.	St
1.4.5	A PC will always use the strongest signal for a SSID even if it is not yours.	St
1.4.6	It can also be configured to use the strongest signal no matter the SSID.	St
1.4.7	Needless to say if it switches you will lose your connection.	St
1.4.8	After this it is more than likely interference from all the other neighbors you can see.	St
1.4.9	You will definitely get interference from channels near the one you use.	St
1.4.10	The signal bleeds over multiple and if someone is using one of the new 450m routers it uses ALL the channels.	St
1.4.11	Since you have a dual band router you could try to use the 5G band.	St
1.4.12	There are many more channels and it is blocked by walls much easier (good if you want to block your neighbor bad if it blocks your signal).	St
1.4.13	You PC's would of course need dual band adapters but many newer machines have these.	St
1.4.14	The dual band USB adapters have come down in price a lot lately.	St
1.5.1	Thank you for any help I can get.	St
1.5.2	I am so not a computer person... in fact I'm sort of stuck in the stone age.	St
1.5.3	Here is my problem.	St
1.5.4	Every time I try to get on line, I have to reconnect.	St
1.5.5	My laptop is old, but has been upgraded, and I'm told it's actually a good machine now (dell inspiron 1200, now sporting 80 gig, and windows 7) My router and modem are both new, provided by Cox with the phone bundel.	St
1.5.6	Sometimes I have to attempt to erconnect several times, and it's a pain.	St
1.5.7	Any one got a simple fix for the untechy??	St
1.5.8	?	Ques
