have purchased 2 @ 512 to take advantage of dual channel architecture but i'm not sure i agree with .

.
'in order to use the ram in ddr2 mode, you need actually 2 ram sticks, thus another 1gb ram stick is required to quiet the beeping.'
another stick is not required and it's not consistent with what's stated on the crucial site...see below.
&quot; q: do i have to install matching pairs?
a: no.
no, you can install modules one at a time, and you can mix different densities of modules in your computer.
but if your computer supports dual-channel memory configurations, you should install in identical pairs (preferably in kits) for optimal performance.
q: does my computer support dual-channel memory?
a: yes.
to benefit from the performance advantages offered by dual-channel systems, you should install memory in identical pairs.
installing a kitted pair is the best way to ensure that your modules are identical, right down to the chip count.&quot; vapcmd
