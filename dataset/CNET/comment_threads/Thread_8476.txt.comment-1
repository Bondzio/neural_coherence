Hi if someone could help me i would gratly apprecite it.
Ive just bought a see thru case for my pc and need a cooler for my 2.7ghz celeron skt 478 cpu.
I bought a coolermaster DP-102 but it doesnt fit both fans due to the layout of my mobo, have tried it with 1 fan and my cpu runs at 65-75 degrees c (is this too hot ?).
I want to get this a lot cooler without using water cooling.
The heatsink also has to be attractive as i've spent a lot of money buying a see thru case, uv lighting, see thru psu, uv reative cables etc.
If you have any sugestions i would gratly appreciate this.
Thanks Paul
