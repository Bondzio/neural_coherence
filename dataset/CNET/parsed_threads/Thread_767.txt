<s> I was thinking of buying a 60 dollar new AMD XP 2000 or 2200 and putting it in place of my current t-bird. </s>
<s> Nowadays they run pretty cheap (60 or so). </s>
<s> Is it worth it since my ram is so slow? </s>
<s> WOuld this be an easy install? </s>
<s> Ive never done a processor replacement but I've done pretty much everything else. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> You didn't say what you were doing this upgrade for. </s>
<s> I'll gues it has to do with gaming. </s>
<s> If so, the video card is very dated now. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The upgrade is for various reasons, general performance and gaming as well. </s>
<s> I would disagree with the videocard statement...as it is still well above the requirements for the very latest games and usually on par with the recommended specs. </s>
<s> The 4200 is the most efficient of the geforce 4s and runs better than a fx5200 </s>
<s> But I did replace such a card with a FX5500 w/256MB RAM and the kid's machine is now much better. </s>
<s> For &quot;today's&quot; games, this one is dated. </s>
<s> Look at the test results. </s>
<s> I should address the CPU on SDRAM. </s>
<s> Yes, an over 2GHz CPU would benchmark poorly with SDRAM. </s>
<s> It's much like a boat anchor or drag chute on such a CPU's performance. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I agree that the video card is not optimal, but I would maintain that it is still mid-range. </s>
<s> Would an xp2000 be dragged down significantly by the ram? </s>
<s> Also, how easy is it to replace the processor/heatsink Thanks! </s>
<s> EPOX 8KTA3+ won't work even with AMD Palomino. </s>
<s> See supported CPU list. </s>
<s> So, the CPU upgrade is not possible. </s>
<s> However, by chance if yours is 8KTA3+ PRO revision 1.0 (and not 0.1), it is possible. </s>

<s> 1. </s>
<s> It's dragged to almost 1/2 the speed. </s>
<s> I have some P4 1.9 GHz that is on an i845 chipset and SDRAM and it benchmarks about the same as the 800 to 1200 MHz speed of a P4. </s>
<s> It's a big deal. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I think it's easy work. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the help guys. </s>
<s> I think I'll hold off and just build a new system in a year or so. </s>
