<s> Hello Hope some one can give me some help on setting up . </s>
<s> Here is what i am trying to achieve, i want the Satellite receiver to be wireless. </s>
<s> i have a I-Link 9000 Plus Satellite reciever which has an ethernet port , where the buffalo router will be connected. </s>
<s> (Buffalo WHR-HP-G300N Firmware: DD-WRT v24SP2-EU-US My main router is the Linksys Wireless G router WRT54G2 V1.5. </s>
<s> If anyone needs any moreinfo just let me know . </s>
<s> Modem Siemens 204A Gigaset </s>
<s> maybe the manual? </s>
<s> My thought on this is...why would the satellite company want anyone to be able to do this wirelessly? </s>
<s> &quot;ethernet adapter to allow you to hook your receiver up to the internet for automatic updates.&quot; It seems that this ethernet port doesn't do much else. </s>
