moved to a new place some weeks ago and didn't bother reconnecting the my home built computer.
decided to replace my seasonic 550w power supply with a new 750w antec ea-750 power supply.
i then reconnected my viewsonic vx2025wm monitor and turned on the computer and got the dreaded &quot;no signal&quot; on the monitor.
not only that, but my gtx 260 graphics card fan is really loud for some reason.
i tried a different monitor, a vx2433wm, on the computer and still got no signal on either of the dvi ports on the gtx 260. i connected the vx2025wm monitor on my parents' dell computer and it worked.
could the new power supply have damaged my video card?
i have no idea whats going on!
