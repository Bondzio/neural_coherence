when you oc, you're pushing things.
you have to find a happy medium and then it'll settle down.
cooling is very important as well as adding a slight voltage increase for the cpu to be oc'ed.
this is a go or no go process, until you finally get there.
as you increase cpu voltage then cooling even in a default system is critial it becomes even more so with an oc'ed one.
so you take your chances as it wre.
good luck tada -----willy
