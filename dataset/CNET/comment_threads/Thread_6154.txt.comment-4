Go back to the old power supply and video card..
If that works, replace the P/S first and I suspect it won't work.
The fan on the CPU comes on fast at first but should be reduced quickly when the BIOS loads, otherwise it will run at full speed.
This tells me the 5 volts has failed but the 12 volts is okay.
