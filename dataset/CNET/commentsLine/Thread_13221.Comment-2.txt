ram costs money because it takes some thousands of people to design the chips, the machines that make the chips, the machines that make the printed circuit boards, people who put it together and so on.
if you step back every year for many years, today's memory is cheaper per byte than before.
you will pay a premium for latest and fastest.
which is true for cars as well.
in this case, the memory looks to be something that is special.
i see ecc and a specific make/model machine.
it's possible that this machine can't take a generic module and that a special reserve of sticks has been set aside.
since memory modules for such may have been made years ago, the price of the memory doesn't follow today's prices but gets stuck at the 2 year ago price plus inventory carrying charges.
older machine memory often zooms up in price (or at least it feels it.)
my example is memory for my old dual pentium pro overdrive machine.
the memory costs more than your example per byte today.
