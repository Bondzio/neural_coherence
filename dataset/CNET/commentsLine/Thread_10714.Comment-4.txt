i also have ati.
an all-in-wonder radeon 7500. i've had it about 3 years and it hardly ever runs right.
i can get it just about right, and then the next time i want to use it nothing works.
i want to watch my dvds on the tv, but the desktop is not displaying on the tv.
i got it to recognise the tv display, by uninstalling and reinstalling the tv monitor in the control panel&gt;systems&gt;device manager, and the boot screen displays on my tv, but the desktop doesn't.
also the ati remote control doesn't work.
maybe it the canadian stuff, if a us company had anything like this i would have gotten it here.
i know it is a complicated system, but i don't have these kinds of problems with anything else in the computer.
i've had it running about 4 different times but it always messes up.
their customer support isn't much help either.
sorry to complain so much.
