1.1.1	Hi , everyone !	St
1.1.2	I have a feeling that you ppl may LOL so hard cos the stupid question Im going to ask .	St
1.1.3	Its okay to LOL cos I can take it !	St
1.1.4	LOL !	St
1.1.5	Okay , I have a 2.4P4 533FSB Northwood , I need a new motherboard .	St
1.1.6	Does any motherboard accept this CPU if it states & quot ; Supported CPU , CPU Socket Type Socket 478 , CPU Type Intel Pentium 4/Celeron , FSB 800/533MHz , Supported CPU Technologies Hyper-Threading Technology & quot ; ?	Ques
1.1.7	As you can see I dont have any clues about PC 's .	St
1.1.8	So go ahead and LOL im not watching !	Sug
1.1.9	LMAO !	St
1.1.10	Always LOST in space w/o my CNET buddies out there to save me !	St
1.1.11	Brandon	St
1.2.1	I took a look at your profile first and you show owning a Dell .	St
1.2.2	Though plenty of socket 478s are still out there , putting one in a Dell case might be a problem .	St
1.2.3	Is this the PC you are speaking of ?	Ques
1.2.4	If so , the task of replacing the MB becomes more complicated .	St
1.2.5	As I said , socket 478s are plentyful .	St
1.2.6	Most of these should support your processor if it 's working ok .	St
1.2.7	I wo n't offer specific recommendations as that depends much on what you want to do and what features you need .	St
1.2.8	As for myself , I like ASUS boards .	St
1.3.1	Dell also uses a non standard ATX MB and power connector , so it you get a non Dell mb and use the Dell PSU everything will go up in smoke .	St
1.3.2	So you may be looking at new MB , case and PSU .	St
1.3.3	John	St
1.4.1	Okay , my motherboard on my DELL is no good , so I want to buy a new one , a new case .	St
1.4.2	So I was just wondering when I look for motherboards if it states supports 533FSB that it will work with my CPU .	St
1.4.3	Btw , tks for the reply on which motherboard you like .	St
1.4.4	Thats a plus my dear old bud !	St
1.4.5	Brandon	St
1.5.1	Most list the prescott now , Norwood was the predicessor .	St
1.5.2	John http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16813128238 http : //www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.asp ? submit=PROPERTY & SubCategory=280 & propertycodevalue=705:9907,706:9985 & bop=and	St
1.6.1	but I 'd suggest waiting for and getting as many replies as possible as others may have advice to offer .	St
1.6.2	It sounds as if your processor will work in any of a number of boards such as are offered at NewEgg as already suggested .	St
1.6.3	You can plug your CPU information into their MB options and get lots of hits in lots of price ranges .	St
1.6.4	Many are jumper free and will detect your CPU 's capabilities and configure it for you .	St
1.6.5	You might or might not be able to use the memory that 's on your Dell .	St
1.6.6	This is something else to consider .	St
1.6.7	Make sure you get a board that 's socket 478 and not 775 .	St
1.6.8	If you need a new case , get one with a power supply of 350w or higher .	St
1.6.9	Some folks will recommend more but your processor should run ok at that wattage .	St
1.6.10	Good luck .	Polite
1.7.1	You have not turned on the feature to allow e-mail through your profile so I can not respond to your query that way .	St
1.7.2	Here 's my thoughts however .	St
1.7.3	It 's best to keep questions inside the forums where someone with some knowledge of the problem can address them .	St
1.7.4	My own competence is limited to specific areas or situations .	St
1.7.5	Many others here are far more advanced or have expertise where I do not .	St
1.7.6	When you pose a question , you may get lots of responses and not all will be of value .	St
1.7.7	Sometimes subtopics break off .	St
1.7.8	Browse the forums and just read about other folks problems and the suggested solutions .	St
1.7.9	If you do enough of this , I can almost guarantee you will read about a problem you do not have now but will have in the future and BINGO ! !	St
1.7.10	you will already now how to handle it .	St
1.7.11	Now , while I do n't mind carrying certain conversations away from the forums , I think it 's best to limit these .	St
1.7.12	The forums can get cluttered by one way conversations and that might be a time to move to e-mail .	St
1.7.13	But , for security reasons , I will not give out my personal address .	St
1.7.14	If you want responses through the forums , you need to edit your profile to allow this .	St
1.8.1	Okay this forum is close please dont respond to this forum cos I know what to do .	Sug
1.8.2	Thanks to the couple of ppl that helped me out .	St
1.8.3	I found everything that I needed .	St
1.8.4	So thanks again .	Polite
1.8.5	Btw , Steven trust me I wont e-mail 24/7 cos I dont often have problems with PC 's to begin with .	St
1.8.6	It was just this one .	St
1.8.7	The reason why I asked you cos it might be so simple that its not worth posting on the forums .	St
1.8.8	Plus I 've been reading posts from this website , most of the time it goes off topic .	St
1.8.9	Thanks again .	St
1.9.1	NIL	St
