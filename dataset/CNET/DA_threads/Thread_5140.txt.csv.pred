1.1.1	I recently help a friend of mine to format and re-instal windows XP home edition to his Dell dimension desktop .	St
1.1.2	On completion the pc is working perfectly but for one snag , his pc is n't recognising his connection , he has a cable/ethernet connection with blueyonder , his modem etc is connected but yet he ca n't seem to get online .	St
1.1.3	In his device manager , he has a yellow question mark where ethernet controller and PCI modem are , is this the cause of it and what can be done to resolve this problem ?	Ques
1.1.4	Any advice regarding this matter will be greatly appreciated , as he is driving me mad with phonecalls every five minutes .	Polite
1.2.1	reinstall of XP is incomplete .	St
1.2.2	When Device Manager reports a disabled device , you likely have yet to install all the required drivers to make your PC functional .	St
1.3.1	You need to put the resource CD in the drive to install the chipset drivers .	St
1.4.1	Great , that did the trick , i now have a happy friend thanks to your advice , Thank you .	St
