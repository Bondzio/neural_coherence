If we test it in notepad typing any keys just seem to tab without words. There are small windows that will popup also when trying to type. This is a brand new PC and it says there is no conflicts showing. And also you know how when you bring up new things they usually show up in the bottom task area. His has now switched to the upper area on his screen. I hope all this makes sense and I am sure this has a very simple solution. So I will thank everyone for your time and understanding. Diamond Rose

Is that what it says? - Can he drag the taskbar to it's usual place with the mouse (pick it up at the small bar next to the start button) - Did you already try another keyboard. If that works correctly, it's a keyboard issue. If it doesn't work correctly, it's some other issue. Kees

But sorry to see you didn't answer my other three questions. Maybe go back to the shop with it, and let them have a look. Kees

If you end up taking it in and tell their folks you tried all sorts of stuff suggested by Cnet users, you risk your chance of getting a free repair job. If you can't fix it by just taking apart and reinstalling the same parts you did when you unboxed it, something is probably broken. Attempts at self repair carry risks as well as rewards. Don't risk your warranty.
