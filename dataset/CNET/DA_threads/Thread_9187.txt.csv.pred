1.1.1	Hello , yesterday i installed a brand new XFX radeon HD5450 card , the main purpose of this is so i could have a nice sharp HD display on my pc , I recently got myself a 32 inch toshiba HDTV and needed a graphics card to get the most from my new display , after installing all the latest drivers and the catalyst control centre from the XFX website i swapped over to the HDMI connection and the picture was just not nice at all , no matter what i changed the resolution to i could not get a sharp display , i was up til 4 am going through all the settings in the catalyst control centre and i could not get it sorted , text and pictures where fuzzy and hard to read , I am now reverted back to VGA with a nice resolution and a sharp display but i want my HD to work , i thought it would have been as simple as installing the card and switching it on , i am running windows 7 64 bit with 8gb of ram and a phenom 9950 quad core cpu , i dont know what to do now other than re-install the card but im not sure that would solve it , anyone else that i know with a similar set up said it worked fine with them through a HDMI connection ... any help is appreciated a lot ... .

1.3.1	and refresh rate of your screen must match the output of the PC .	St
1.3.2	Try setting the screen to factory default and see if your card/PC automatically adjusts to its rez/refresh .	St
