it's seen better days i think.
i thought i would just check and see whether it would have been worth doing something with it before i got rid of it.
someone gave it to me a while ago but i never realised it was so old!
theres a lot to learn about pc's for me.
i thinking of maybe buying seperate parts and over time and making a newer one or if i can just get a low range and build on that.
i've got another pc which is is high spec so im not desperate for another one anyway.
thanx for your advice, its very helpfull.
