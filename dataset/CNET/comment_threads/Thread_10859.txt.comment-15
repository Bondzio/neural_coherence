My brother who lives in another state called me earlier tonight to inform me that he had received his laptop which I dropped in January 2008 and damaged and he has decided to buy another one rather than spend the money it would take to fix the other one.
He told me to get a few configurations together for a replacement laptop I'd like and send the information to him soon and he'd try to get me another laptop before Christmas.
Should I configure the next laptop to have wireless &quot;g&quot; like the other one had or should I switch to wireless &quot;N&quot;?
I've looked at Dell's Inspiron 1525 laptop which comes standard with a Dell wireless &quot;g&quot; card or for less than $50.00 I can upgrade to a Dell wireless &quot;N&quot; card.
Is wireless &quot;N&quot; what everyone's now going with or is &quot;g&quot; still popular?
I looked at some Linksys routers for &quot;N&quot; and new models for &quot;g&quot;.
If I switched from &quot;g&quot; to &quot;N&quot; I would have to make a change in my router I would think.
Is Linksys still considered the best router brand to go with or are there other brands out there I should consider?
My current Linksys router, a WRT54G is over 2 years old.
