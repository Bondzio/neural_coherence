1.1.1	Can ANYONE tell me if it is safe to buy a monitor on ebay and how in the world can they sell them so much cheaper that Dell does .	Sug
1.1.2	Some guys have 25 of the same monitor .	St
1.1.3	I know this is not a technical help question but I wonder how they do it .	St
1.1.4	Guess my main question still is whether it is safe and will Dell honor the warranty ?	Ques

1.2.1	I bought my 17 & quot ; CRT on E-Bay about 4 years ago and still using it daily .	St
1.2.2	I never had a problem .	St
1.2.3	Just like shopping anywhere , read the customer ratings and make your choice , I have no idea if Dell will honor a warranty , I expect not if refurbs .	St
1.3.1	If these monitors are stolen ( could be ? )	Ques
1.3.2	the SN # will disallow any warranty .	St
1.3.3	In fact , you 'll probably get a call .	St
1.3.4	Of course , monitors are mass produced and some models are n't always needed , thus dumped in order to generate revenue .	St
1.3.5	If Dell does this and & quot ; an agreement & quot ; is made between seller and vendor to honor a warranty , its usually posted .	St
1.3.6	Also , do n't expect a generous warrnty .	St
1.3.7	Many a monitor gets returned for repair/problem and ca n't be used as new , thus sold to 3rd party sellers .	St
1.3.8	Read the fine print and any eBay seller history .	St
1.3.9	The choice is yours .	St

1.4.1	I bought a new dell computer and lcd monitor on Ebay for a price that I could n't get it for on the Dell website .	St
1.4.2	It arrived in perfect condition .	St
1.4.3	After a week , the hard drive stopped working .	St
1.4.4	So , I called Dell and they sent out a tech person to replace the hard drive and it all was covered under their warranty .	St
1.4.5	The person I bought it from had purchased it under some discount program available only to educational institutions and then used all of the rebates to get the puter for a price that is n't available to the general public .	St
1.4.6	I got a great deal , he made a little money and everyone is happy .	St
1.4.7	It is just frustrating to see someone abuse the educational discount system that Dell so generously makes available .	St
1.4.8	The computer and monitor were packaged in the original Dell packaging and arrived in great condition .	St
1.4.9	Boxes were n't damaged nor was the monitor .	St
