I use the Epson Stylus Photo R800.
I have had the cartridges (all 8 of them) in there for over a year and like you, I don't print all that often either.
I have yet to have a problem.
The quality of ink has everything to do on its clogging ability.
On the cheaper side, I use the Brother MFC 210C without the clogging.
and life goes on... Jack
