So can I buy two new internal drives and just swap them over? I wish to keep everything as is on the original 80's and if ever I need too just re-plug them back in to access the information. Sound feasible? Also, I believe I can add up to 4 hard drives on a media raid... My question is do they all have to be the same size? Or, could I put 2x 40's or 2x160's to sit alongside the other 2 x80's I already have installed. I've tried an extra 20GB drive but got freaked when it asked me to do new BIOS settings or something.... needless to say, I could not get it to work. However, this is an option I would be very interested in looking into. I also figure I'd need some PCI (I think that's what it's called) cable to link them together? Anyway, thoughts/dialogue/advice would be most appreciated. Thanks in advance...

SATA,PEIDE or SCSI, so it is hard to say what you can do to change dirves. I have put in a few links to give you an idea. 2 160bg drives would be about $170 plus all the hassle it would that take to set them up. An externial 160gb about $160 and just plug it in. Check the paper for sales with a rebate at BB,CC,FRY's, Microcenter,etc. I have seem them with $50 or better rebates. Also you by a 160gb HD $86 and an externial case for about $40 . Your choice.
