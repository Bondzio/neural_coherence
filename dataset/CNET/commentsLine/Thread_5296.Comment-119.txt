if this new computer is a laptop, then you'll be trapped with the card, if its a desktop then you might be able to upgrade to a real video card later.
my advice would be to do abit of research, find out exactly what model the store is selling and look it up online, see if it has any extra sockets for additions ie: pcie x1, pcie x4, pcie x16, keep in mind those are different socket sizes used by different cards.
usually most storebought ones come with a dialup modem card which can be removed and replaced with a different type card.
just pay attention to the type of card slots your new system will have, and what kind of card slot your new video card (if/when you decide to invest in one) requires.
same if you intend to go wireless or look into a tv tuner, better sound card, etc.
another recommendation would be to check out reviews on the system your interested in just incase there's alot of complaints/issues with the make/model.
wish ya luck with the new compy once you find one you like.
