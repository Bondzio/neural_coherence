7300 GT I believe (I'm at home now so I'm not 100% sure about this one, its 7300 for sure, not sure about the GT) As for HDD, the Master is a 250GB WD SATA2, and the slave is an IDE (160GB WD) drive with a adapter thing to convert to SATA (even though I don't like this, he's stuck with it until he can afford a SATA drive...soon) 2 Opticals are DVD burners, IDE, using the 1 IDE connector the mobo has.
We have a firewire card in a PCI slot for fun Proc is a Core 2 Duo E6300 (1.86 Ghz, 1066 FSB) The memory is CORSAIR ValueSelect (2x512) DDR2.
The PSU is 500W.
