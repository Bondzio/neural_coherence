arbee makes a good point.
my setup is a complete hodgepodge: motorola cable modem, linksys voip telephone adapter, 2wire hardware firewall, netgear wireless router, netgear, linksys and apple airport wireless cards.
the airport wireless card is inside a macintosh powerbook.
everything works together very nicely, except when the netgear card occasionally loses touch with the netgear router.
i did run into a bit of a problem when the powerbook was new and would not connect with the netgear router.
when i called apple support, the tech told me that he did not know anything about netgear routers.
then, he had me try a simple alternative method of establishing a connection and everything worked fine.
if all hardware is the same brand, no support person can pass the buck to another company.
i see no need for 108 mbps for the purposes you describe.
a standard wireless g setup will provide far more speed than you will get from any internet connection.
if you are trying to span large distances, you may want to consider one of the new routers that employ mimo technology.
these systems promise far greater range than any 802.11g systems.
of course, they are currently far more expensive.
