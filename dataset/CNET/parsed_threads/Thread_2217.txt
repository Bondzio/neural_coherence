<s> Hi, Need some help here. </s>
<s> I can't seem to turn on the computer sometimes, although I keep pressing the power on button. </s>
<s> Sometimes, it works, and the computer works fine. </s>
<s> What do you guys think is the problem? </s>
<s> Im a newbie at this, so I 'd like to know what is the likely cause before I take the thing to pieces. </s>
<s> Thanks for replying!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Some power-ON switches do go bad, its not that common. </s>
<s> The ATX power supplies when pushing the power button takes time to react and its best maintain pressing until the system starts to power-ON. </s>
<s> The frt. </s>
<s> panel power sw. is usually has a wire harness to the mtrbd. </s>
<s> it maybe not seated fully or the crimps of connector pins are flimsy, check all that by opening case and inspect. </s>
<s> The power supply itself maybe flaky and starting to fail. </s>
<s> If this is a new system, use the warranty or call-in the problem. </s>
<s> You may have other problems, but if you feel uncomfortable in fixing it, it maybe best to allow a pro at it or a &quot;trusted, but knowledgable&quot; friend at it. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> How old is the computer, what brand and model, processor type...etc. </s>
<s> When you can't get it to start, if you unplug the power plug and put it back in does it make any difference. </s>
<s> How often does it not stat up? </s>
<s> When you power up the PC, watch the fans and especially the PS fan. </s>
<s> If it twitches and stops and the PC does not boot, this usually means the PS has detected an improper load and has shut down. </s>
<s> If the fans do nothing, it could be the mentioned momentary switch. </s>
<s> A marginal PS can do this because the startup current is higher than the run current. </s>
<s> This could explain why it sometimes works and sometimes does not. </s>
<s> Of course make sure the PS can supply sufficient current for your hardware configuration. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
