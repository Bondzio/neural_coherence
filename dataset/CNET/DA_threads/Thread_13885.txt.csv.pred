1.1.1	I have an intel p4 processesor , 512mb ram and i am using asrock 775vm800 motherboard .	St
1.1.2	i want to implement raid-1 on my computer .	St
1.1.3	the motherboard manual says this motherboard has built in support for raid-0 and raid-1 .	St
1.1.4	what does this mean ?	Ques
1.1.5	Does it mean that i do not have to buy a seperate raid controller card to implement raid-1 on my computer ?	Ques
1.1.6	if so how do i go about it .	St
1.2.1	Baically what this means is that the output ports on your motherboard are configured for RAID - I know , mine are .	St
1.2.2	All you need is a normal IDE or ATA or SATA cable to conncect to your hard drives , and you 're away .	St
1.2.3	By the way , if you can , add extra RAM , XP takes 512Mb on it 's own , you really need iGb or better .	St
1.3.1	RAID-0 is ''stripping '' data between 2 or more hard drives .	St
1.3.2	It gives you more speed , but no security .	St
1.3.3	RAID-1 is mirroring data between 2 hard drives .	St
1.3.4	It gives you a backup in case one of your hard drives fails .	St
1.3.5	You should be able to configure it in BIOS setup w/o any extra hardware .	St
1.4.1	Motherboard manuals usually have detailed instructions on how to implement RAID for that MB .	St
1.4.2	If you ca n't find the manual you can download it from the motherboard manufacturer .	St
1.5.1	You 've explained Raid-0 and Raid-1 fairly well .	St
1.5.2	I 've seen some differ other numbers as well ( I believe up to Raid-5 ) What are all these other specifications ?	Ques
1.6.1	I 'm build a new system .	St
1.6.2	The part 's have been ordered .	St
1.6.3	I spent a bunch of time at the Agus site tonight reading the manual for the MB .	St
1.6.4	I 'm still confused as to the Raid 0,1,1+0 and JBOD .	St
1.6.5	This is a Agus A8N-E MB 2- Seagate 80G ST380013AS SATA/150 7200RPM	St
1.7.1	Robert explained level 0 and 1 ; each of these require 2 ( or 4 for more space ) drives .	St
1.7.2	Raid 0+1 is a combination of striping and mirroring and requires at least 4 drives -- two for the striping and two more to mirror the first two .	St
1.7.3	Some mobos only support these choices .	St
1.7.4	RAID levels 2 , 3 , and 4 are seldom used today , so I will not discuss them .	St
1.7.5	RAID 5 is very popular ; it is striping with distributed parity , and requires at least 3 drives .	St
1.7.6	RAID 10 is another combo of striping and mirroring , but far superior to RSID 0+1 .	St
1.7.7	Personally , I would stay away from RAID 0 -- the chance of a disk crash is doubled , and there is virtually no chance or data recovery .	St
1.7.8	I do not think the increase is speed is worth the risk .	St
1.7.9	Although I use RAID 1 , be aware that it is not foolproof and is no substitute for regular backups .	St
1.7.10	This site provides excellent discussions of the various RAID levels Hope this helps Frank	St
1.8.1	Thank You Frank , I am currently using a program called Avronis 's True Image .	St
1.8.2	This is on a 3rd HD in my current computer .	St
1.8.3	Each Fri after a full virus scan , it automatically run 's to take a snapshot of my ''C '' drive for a backup .	St
1.8.4	So the mirror feature would not be needed .	St
1.8.5	With that in mind , do you have suggestion 's as to the way to set the Raid on the new computer ?	Ques
1.9.1	I cant make any really definitive suggestion because I dont know the details of your system .	St
1.9.2	What are the drives and what is stored on each ?	Ques
1.9.3	Some RAID configurations require almost identical drives ; others permit drives of different sizes , but then they operate at the size of the smallest .	St
1.9.4	The general recommendation for multi-drive systems is to put the OS , program files , transient data and perhaps some relatively unimportant files on the C drive .	St
1.9.5	As these items do not change much and/or are not so important , this drive does not need to be backed up very frequently just when there is a major change .	St
1.9.6	Important data in newly generated or modified files needs to be backed up much more frequently ; all this should be stored on drive ( s ) separate from the C drive so that backups are faster and simpler .	St
1.9.7	You say that since you image your C drive weekly you dont need mirroring .	St
1.9.8	Your backup scheme is good , except that it should be your data drive , not your system drive that you are backing up ( unless you are storing your data on the system drive ) .	St
1.9.9	But now lets consider this scenario : It is the morning of Friday April 14 , 2006 , and the scheduled backup has not yet occurred .	St
1.9.10	Like a million or so Americans , you have spent the past several days gathering your financial data for the year and putting it into spreadsheets to consolidate it and calculate the totals and subtotals , etc .	St
1.9.11	etc. , needed for Federal and State income tax forms .	St
1.9.12	Suddenly , your disk crashes badly so that there is no way to recover the data in a hurry .	St
1.9.13	Your last backup was last Friday , so none of your work for the week is on it you must start all over , and the deadline is tomorrow .	St
1.9.14	Had you had RAID 1 ( mirroring ) it is unlikely that both of the drives would have failed , so all your data would be intact on the good drive ; you could recover it and proceed in filing your 1040 and state forms .	St
1.9.15	This is , I think , is the proper role for RAID 1 to provide automatic redundancy for important data generated between regularly scheduled backups .	St
1.9.16	With RAID 5 , I might rely more heavily on it and reduce the frequency of scheduled backups -- but not eliminate them .	St
1.9.17	These are , of course , my ideas and how I tend to operate ; I know that not everyone agrees with me .	St
1.9.18	I do suggest you go to the link I provided in my last post for more detailed information on RAID and its advantages and disadvantages .	Sug
1.9.19	Hope this helps .	St
1.9.20	Frank	St
1.10.1	It was very imformative .	St
1.10.2	I did go and read the link you posted + several more that I found .	St
1.10.3	You point about the Tax deal made perfect sence , but alas I do n't use my computer in that fashion .	St
1.10.4	It 's mostly consumed with pix 's , movies and a bunch of bookmark 's .	St
1.10.5	The computer I 'm asking this about is not built yet .	St
1.10.6	Asus A8N-E MB Muskin 1G [ 1 strip ] PC 3200 184 pin 2-Seagate 80G ST380013AS SATA/150 7200RPM -	St
