Asking others to ID the proper M/B / CPU / chipset for you is like asking which is better .. Ford or Chevy.
I prefer Intel chips and boards..dual memory 533MB min/ 533 or 800 fbs/ 2.4 or 3.0 CPU depending on system use.
AMDs' in some cases are a better choice.
I have found using a slower CPU to a fast M/B the AMDs' will smoke an Intel.
I just don't like the small footprint AMD presents for heat dissipation.
