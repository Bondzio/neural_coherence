<s> I cant do it. </s>
<s> INFO: My laptop has a wireless network connection Dell Wireless WLAN 1350 WLAN Mini-PCI card. </s>
<s> It also has a Local Area Connection Broadcom 440x 10/100 which is currently disconnected. </s>
<s> My desktop has a 1394 Net Adaptor and also a Local Area Connection 2 3com gigabit NIC It is also connected to a Linksy router by an ethernet cable which in turn is connected to a DSL modem, also by an ethernet cable. </s>
<s> Now, I have no trouble accessing the internet, but everytime I try to run the &quot;set-up network wizard&quot; it stops in middle and tells me something is wrong and it wont say what. </s>
<s> Furthermore, I created a shared files folder on my laptop, which APPEARED in the Network places folder on my Desktop, but wouldn't let me access it, saying that it didn't really exist. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> the broadcom connection is not currently unplugged like I thought. </s>
<s> It is terminally unplugged. </s>
<s> It says: &quot;A network cable is unplugged.&quot; Well, what cable is it talking about? </s>
<s> and where would I plug it in? </s>
<s> and while I'm at it, what is a network key? </s>
<s> manually configuring the network. </s>
<s> 1) What OS is being used? </s>
<s> 2) Workgroup name should be the same on both machines. </s>
<s> 3) File and Print sharing enabled and a folder or more set to share. </s>
<s> 4) Firewalls down until you have a working network. </s>
<s> 5) XP/2K may require you to set up a user account for the each machine to log in to. </s>
<s> An unplugged Network cable message is just that, the NIC does not see a cable attached to it. </s>
<s> Which in your case seems right for the laptop not having a cable plugged in. </s>
