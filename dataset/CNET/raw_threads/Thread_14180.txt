Stuck in safe-mode and Qttask error	I'm pretty sure my computer got a virus, trojan, etc. I have a cable modem with no firewall nor anti-virus (I know... I'm getting them both now). My computer would bout on in the middle of the night, some of the settings were changed, clock was hours off, but everything ran fine. I disconnected the cable, and thought all was fine. Then, when I blew a fuse, the computer rebouted, scan disc found an unusually long file name, and everything is in Safe Mode. (Although it doesn't state it is in Safe Mode, it looks just like it-- 12 color). Error Msg: &quot;Qttask caused invalid page fault in module KERNE32.DLL at 015f:bff9dba7&quot; I can still use it for basics. Is there anything that would find and fix the problem (Scan Disc locks up around 50%)-- free or retail? Or do I have to wipe the hard drive clean and reinstall everything? Oh, yeah-- I have Windows 98. Thanks, Kristin

Boot to the DOS PROMPT (use the boot menu by F8 or Control Key) and run... SCANREG /RESTORE Pick the time just before the error. If all the driver files are still there, you might not have to find the video driver and install that. Bob PS. If I were you and this doesn't work, post in the Windows 98 Forum for a bigger support group.
