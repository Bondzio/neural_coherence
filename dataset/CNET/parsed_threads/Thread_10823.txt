<s> I was reading over the post from the fellow who recommended building a box from scratch based upon an AMD CPU and it put me in mind of the fact that, in spite of the fact that I think I finally found all the parts to build the generic equivalent to a Gateway 825GM: http://axinar.blogspot.com/2005/03/building-your-very-own-btx-tower-box.html that there is still very much the possibility that no known form of Linux will be able to use the built-in network card on the Intel motherboard. </s>
<s> So, if we were trying to build a really excellent dual-boot box (which was my original intent but ended up having to give it up ultimately due to financial constraints), what would you all suggest? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> First they are many other MB that will do the job and cost less. </s>
<s> C-net is running a course right now on how to build your own PC and one on building a MCE PC. </s>
<s> Since nic cards are cheep just get one that linux will see. </s>
<s> check out www.newegg.com for prices. </s>
<s> BTX MB and PSU are just starting to come out, but a 300W PSU for this P4 processor is lacking, should be a 400W or better. </s>
<s> In this price range you migth want to look at AMD64 processors also. </s>
