I put a Windows XP trial program on a PC which was supposed to have a 90 day trial period and it has locked me out of the computer in 18 days and won't let me reload the Win 98 SE back on.
How can I delete the XP trial program so I can reload the Win 98 SE program?
Any help would be appreciated as it is not my computer...
