<s> hey everyone, I'm replacing the power supply in an older computer, and the color scheme on the dead power supply wires (where it connects to the on/off switch on the front of the machine) is different than a normal ATX power supply. </s>
<s> On the old PS, the wires are as follows: two white wires on the left, and two dark grey wires on the right, whereas an ATX PS has a white, brown, blue and black wire. </s>
<s> Can someone tell me what type of PS this old one is, and is there a way to wire up an ATX PS to this old machine without frying it? </s>
<s> thank you for your help. </s>

<s> Unless you are trying to save something like my old DUAL Pentium Pro with overdrives, there is almost zero reason to do this. </s>
<s> Walk around your neighborhood and ask if they have an old PC that they can give you. </s>
<s> If you lucked out and found me, I'd open the garage door and give you something. </s>
<s> This stuff is out there. </s>
<s> Go ask. </s>

<s> Yeah, Proffitt is right. </s>
<s> If you can, you may get lucky and find an old one in your neighborhood. </s>
<s> Hey, I think I still might have my old AT power supply!! </s>
<s> I'll have to check when I get home. </s>
<s> I'm currently at work. </s>
<s> connect to the power switch at all. </s>
<s> As Robert et al say you have an AT Supply. </s>
<s> Just that various mfr's use different color wires. </s>
<s> With four wires, they are USUALLY switching both the hot lead and the neutral lead. </s>
<s> [ Can deduce which is which with an ohmmeter. </s>
<s> If you want to put an ATX supply in, you can get an ATX to AT adapter cable at www.cyberguys.com Items 113 0273 and 161 2200 </s>
