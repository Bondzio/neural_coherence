<s> I've got a friend who's made an usual request. </s>
<s> His wife has an old Compaq Presario 5095cl. </s>
<s> Seems she want to keep it but he's talked her into upgrading the machine. </s>
<s> I've made several suggestions that should occur such as a new power supply and HDD along with a new MoBo, memory and CPU. </s>
<s> The specs are a 200Mhz bus and she has a 900Mhz AMD duron chip. </s>
<s> I'm not finding much on the MoBo online. </s>
<s> I suppose it's just too old. </s>
<s> The husband and I are not in the same location as the computer, so I have no means to &quot;climb inside&quot; and take a look. </s>
<s> I feel it's safest to ensure the new board is the same size as the old one and the holes line up to mount the thing. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any suggestions on boards? </s>
<s> I've tried endlessly to talk them both into buying a new computer, but that has fallen on deaf ears. </s>
<s> Suggestions on boards anyone? </s>
<s> (buy one with embedded sound and video) with new CPU and memory, combined with a new PSU and a new hard disk, in essence is a new PC in an old case. </s>
<s> Why not add a DVD-burner to replace the CD-ROM? </s>
<s> Then all is new! </s>
<s> It might be cheaper to buy everything new, including the case, if you can get a nice deal. </s>
<s> And it certainly is less work. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> That thing is from 2001. </s>
<s> Wally-mart...400 bucks....10x the machine. </s>
<s> If the user insist on keeping the machine. </s>
<s> Consider a ram upgrade. </s>
<s> Waste of money in my opinion...but it might make the user happy. </s>
<s> HP says that machine comes with 128MB of ram with a max of 768MB. </s>
<s> If the user is running w98 bump the ram to 256. </s>
<s> If the user is running XP bump the ram to the max. </s>
<s> Kees, thanks but I'm more after brands or types. </s>
<s> Abit versus Gigabyte, for example. </s>
<s> I have no clue what the board is inside, but I can't make a suggestion to my colleague without know what's inside the case. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> I am guessing that the lady in question has become very familiar with her Presario. </s>
<s> She knows where her files are, she knows how to plug her camera and mp3 player into it, she nows how to install a new CD program into it. </s>
<s> SHE KNOWS IT. </s>
<s> That is why she wants to keep it. </s>
<s> Upgrading it is NOT a waste of time or money. </s>
<s> As a matter of fact her machine will do pretty much everything a new one will. </s>
<s> It can download off the internet at 100MPS if she likes. </s>
<s> It can send email. </s>
<s> It can display photo ablums, it can play cds and mp3s. </s>
<s> It can display in svga. </s>
<s> It can accept a DVD burner. </s>
<s> Will XPsp2/3 with all of its heavy and burdeonsome network interfacing, security for such, and background services, most of which she will NEVER use, be slower on her machine? </s>
<s> Sure. </s>
<s> Will Vista with its shiny display but ram killing requirements be more than her system can handle? </s>
<s> Undoubtedly. </s>
<s> But so what. </s>
<s> I don't put a Ferrari v12 in my Honda because I'm not racing in a Grand Prix. </s>
<s> As a matter of fact, most of the users here that have high end machines will admit they do so primarily to PLAY GAMES. </s>
<s> Maybe she has other games she plays besides those on a computer (soccer with kids, candyland with pre-schooler, etc...) Max out the Ram. </s>
<s> Find a decent graphics card. </s>
<s> Max out the CPU for its socket type. </s>
<s> All three won't cost maybe $175.00 total. </s>
<s> Double check HP\Compaq's site info against the motherboard's own site. </s>
<s> I have found several discrepancies in the past, especially with FIC produced boards. </s>
<s> A good air clean for the power supply, maybe add a system case fan, and perhaps drop &quot;themes&quot; setting to a performance stance from appearance, and her husband gets his upgrades, she keeps her computer, they stay married! </s>
<s> Use the scheduled tasks to automate computer maintenance and software upgrades for her machine. </s>
<s> The casual computer user (i.e. </s>
<s> email, photos, mp3, websurf-casts, and solitaire) believe their machine to be slower than it used to be, or perhaps slower than the one their friend has, because it is broken or infected. </s>
<s> In fact, most often it needs only to have its scheduled tasks set up to self maintain the HDD, Registry, and Antivirus protocols. </s>
