<s> First off I would like to say this is not a power supply, BIOS, or bad connector problem. </s>
<s> The short version...I had a hard drive start clicking last year, instead of backing up everything I shut the computer down. </s>
<s> After that I reboot and get an error primary 0 hard disk not found. </s>
<s> So I bought a new hard drive installed it works fine. </s>
<s> I tried setting up the clicking hard drive as a slave to get files I need. </s>
<s> All this did was give me an error primary 1 hard disk not found. </s>
<s> So after 4 hours of setting the working and non working hard drives as master/slave...changing BIOS to auto detect/off...and so on, I always get the clicking hard drive...and no hard dick found. </s>
<s> So I thought if it could power the hard drive to make the clicking why would in not see the hard drive? </s>
<s> Since the info is not critical to me and everything I have read says you have to have a &quot;clean room&quot; to open a hard drive, I would see what I could do to fix it. </s>
<s> I bought another hard drive swapped the platter from the old hard drive with the new one, all new head and such turn on PC...same thing click, click, click. </s>
<s> So I downloaded Hard Drive Mechanic Software it also said no logical drive found. </s>
<s> So my question is how can the hard drive power up and start make a clicking noise and still say no hard drive found? </s>
<s> Is there anything out there that can just read the platter from a hard drive outside of the case? </s>
<s> How can the platter be causing the problem, I would have thought the actual moving components of the hard drive would have failed? </s>
<s> Is there anything someone knows I can try other than the freezing thing...I am just trying to get a few pictures it is not worth spending more than 50 bucks plus I have probably corrupted most of the data anyway. </s>
<s> http://datacent.com/hard_drive_sounds.php I think it's done for. </s>
<s> Do backups routinely. </s>
<s> Use redundant (3) methods of back up. </s>
<s> Maybe CD/DVD, second hard drive, USB, online, RAID, there are others. </s>

<s> It has a controller with firmware on it. </s>
<s> That's what IDs the drive and it properties. </s>
<s> The controller could be good and the platters bad but the drive show in the BIOS just fine. </s>
<s> You can't expect to successfully replace the platters either. </s>
<s> In fact, removing the originals yourself is likely to reduce the probability that a drive recovery service can get your picture for you as well. </s>
<s> If the controller on the HD is bad, it's sometimes possible to find an exact replacement and swap that part. </s>
<s> No opening of the shell is needed. </s>
<s> How do you find a new controller, what is the actual controllewr, and how is it replaced without opening up the shell? </s>
<s> I know this is probably a lost cause but I am thinking maybe this can help me, or someone I know, out in the future. </s>
<s> And if the platter is bad is there any software that you know of that can search the hard drive with the read/write head or arm on its own without any assistance? </s>
<s> I bought a new drive of the exact make, model and even lucked into the same PCB and FIRMWARE revisions. </s>
<s> It was a bargain for 129 bucks since data recovery was north of 600. </s>
<s> I won! </s>
