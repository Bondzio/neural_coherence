1.1.1	I have a new office and my monitor cable is too short to connect to the CPU.	St
1.1.2	I have an HP Pavilion f1903 (flat panel LED 19 inch.)	St
1.1.3	I have purchased 3 different VGA extension cables based on what the sales staff provided me at 3 different computer stores.	St
1.1.4	None worked.	St
1.1.5	All 3 caused much distortion, flickering and other interference.	St
1.1.6	I contacted HP support 3 times and have received wrong/bad advice each time.	St
1.1.7	On my third attempt to get help, they said to ''buy a VGA signal cable that has blue connectors.''	St
1.1.8	The ones I previously purchased had black connectors.	St
1.1.9	I can't believe that the color of the connectors makes a difference--but if it does, where can I get such a thing?	St
1.1.10	None of the local stores has a VGA monitor extension cable with blue connectors.	St
1.1.11	They laugh when I tell them that's what the HP experts told me.	St
1.1.12	I checked with Cables to Go and they suggested I need the Pro Series HD15 M/F UXGA Monitor Extension Cable.	St
1.1.13	Before I order this, is there anyone out there who could tell me if that sounds right, or is there some truth in what HP support is telling me regarding the blue connectors?	St
1.1.14	I never thought buying a new office configuration could cause so much trouble!	St
1.1.15	Thanks for any help provided.	Polite
1.2.1	The VGA signals are in the MegaHertz region so adding/changing the cables is not an easy thing.	St
1.2.2	Try this.	St
1.2.3	Since it's an LCD, drop the refresh rate to 60 Hz which will ease back on the MHz and lighten up on the specs of the cable.	St
1.2.4	There are varying qualities of VGA cables.	St
1.2.5	&quot;Stores&quot; are now tending to go for the lowest price with Monster Cables being an exception.	St
1.2.6	I will not enter into the Monster Cable &quot;is it worth it&quot; debate, but they are well made and worth a try.	St
1.2.7	Next time?	St
1.2.8	Try the DVI connection.	St
1.2.9	Bob	St
