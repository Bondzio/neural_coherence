for some reason, when i attach my external hard drive via usb 2.0, windows(xp w/ sp2) installs the driver(s), tells me the hardware is installed and ready to use, but when i open my computer to access my files in the hard drive, there is no f: drive present.
all that shows up is my cdrw/dvd drive, c:, and memory stick drive.
what can i do to access my information?
it is vital for work, and every second i'm without the information on it is costly.
