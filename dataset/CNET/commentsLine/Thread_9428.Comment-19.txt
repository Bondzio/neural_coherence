that can be a tough question, but if consider a few factors you can usually come to a decision.
first, does the computer you have now meet all of your needs or at least enough of them to satisfy you?
second, if the answer to the first question is no, then what is your budget for buying a computer?
third, make a list of the specs you require or want and compare it and your budget to the various deals you find either in a store or online.
finally, when you found some that fit into those parameters, check out what various forums, review sites and even friends to see what they think about them.
then weigh all of these factors and see which one or ones come out on top.
sometimes you may have to compromise a little either on specs or budget to get the computer that best meets your needs.
also, keep in mind that spending a little more money on a system that is more readily upgradable can prove worth your while in the future when technology changes.
hope this helps.
