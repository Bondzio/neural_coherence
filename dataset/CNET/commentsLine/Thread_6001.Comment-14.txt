last night i see there were two warning messages: the system failed to flush data to the transaction log.
corruption may occur.
the time service has not been able to synchronize the system time for 49152 seconds because none of the time providers has been able to provide a usable time stamp.
the system clock is unsynchronized.
this morning i got black screened, and upon manual shut down and restart i got the following message: memory read/write failure at oa824364, read 8260882d expecting 826d826d.
decreasing available memory.
memory address line failure at )a380000, read 00000000 expecting 7c7c7c7c.
decreasing available memory.
the amount of system memory has changed.
when i asked it to start normally, it behaved like a computer with limited memory - working very slowly.
i restarted and got the same message as last time: amount of system memory has changed.
i started normally.
although the computer appears to be working at normal speed again, my task bar is white and the text is another font.
the temperature is about 75 degrees.
i don't know if the temperature yesterday would have anything to do with it, but it was working fine when i went to bed.
my gut is giving me a bad feeling about this - that it may indeed be the memory sticks.
hope you're still tracking this discussion and would be grateful for any input.
thanks.
