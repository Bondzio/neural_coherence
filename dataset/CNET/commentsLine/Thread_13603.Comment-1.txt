budget: around usd 850 (total) looking for: a pc with a full hd monitor (around 22-inches) and if possible, a discrete graphics card (256mb vram is enough but optional) with a total budget of around usd 850. needs to have at least: windows 7 home premium os, 2gb-4gb ram, 250gb-500gb (or more) hdd storage, intel or amd processors will be fine with me - just as long they can run windows 7 and hd videos with no problem.
additional details: this pc will be used primarily for surfing the web, playing facebook games, watching videos on the full hd monitor and streaming video from the pc to a 42-inches hd lcd monitor.
inquiry: are discrete cards really necessary if i want to play 720p or 1080p video without any lag with media players like vlc?
or will an integrated graphics card do the job just fine?
i will be buying a pc by mid or late april so i'm asking for opinions now.
thanks for the feedback.
