my 2002 hp pavilion desktop computer has been 100% problem free.
it has never required a single repair, and has never had any problem of any kind.
i don't know if hp technical support is good/bad, because i have never needed them.
my previous computer was a high-end dell desktop.
it was dead-unrepairable after three years.
in addition, i found dell consumer technical support to be completely clueless.
i guess if you want a dell technical support person with a brain, you have to be a business customer.
