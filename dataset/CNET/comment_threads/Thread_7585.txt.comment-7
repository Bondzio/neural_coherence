I ran a program that identified the motherboard, so now I'm confident about what ram I need to get.
Unfortunately from everything I've read, Win98 doesn't run very well with more than 512mb, but 768 can be used with a MS workaround.
Can I mix a 512 stick with a 256 stick, or do I need three 256's to make the 768??
Thanks.
