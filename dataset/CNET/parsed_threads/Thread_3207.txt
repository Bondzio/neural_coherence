<s> i have a mesh pc, athlon 64 3500 + 256mb nvidia 7800 gtx 2 x 512mb DDR RAM PC3200 (200MHZ) im looking to get some more ram, preferably 1gb ocz or crucial, something fast... i just need help to know if it will work. </s>
<s> I see ram that says pc3200 400MHZ, will that work??? </s>
<s> im mainly looking for something to improve my gaming, my motherboard is quite old.. its a gigabyte ga-k8 pci express. </s>
<s> if anyone can give me advice on any other essentials to upgrade like processors thats appreciated. </s>
<s> Look at your MB manual, the MB manula on the mfgs website; or check the RAM mfgs websites such as Crucial.com; Corsair.com; Kingston.com; etc., From the websites above, select the MB mfg, the MB model # and the RAM selector will show you what RAM they offer for your MB. </s>
<s> You can buy direct or go to resellers like Newegg.com, ZipZoomFly.com, etc., to buy. </s>

<s> pc3200 runs at 2x200mhz and is commonly called ddr-400. </s>
<s> so the ram you're looking at will run just fine except if you fill all 4 slots. </s>
<s> in that case, it may slow down to ddr-333 speed but will still run fine. </s>
<s> i've sort if read up and i think i know what to get, there is only 1 more thing i need to know, if i get dual-channel memory, what happens to my old 2 x 512mb memory?? </s>
<s> do i just have to sell it on or something? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> PS....no such thing as 'dual channel memory'. </s>
<s> But there is memory that operates in the motherboard's dual memory architecture and for best results it takes matched pairs. </s>
<s> To avoid the RAM from going from 400MHz to 333Mhz...get 2 DIMMs @1GB each and place them in the first dual channel dimm slots. </s>
<s> Test the new DIMMs thoroughly with Memtest86+. </s>
<s> If they test OK....then add the 2 @ 512MBs and see how it runs... be prepared to obeserve the impact and tradeoff of the RAM speed reduction and the extra 1GB RAM. </s>
<s> Then make your decision what to do the 2-512s. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> im a bit confused now, i read that you put the dual ones in at the first slot and 3rd slot. </s>
<s> take advantage of dual channel architecture. </s>
<s> I meant place the new DIMMs in first channel vs 2nd channel. </s>

<s> There are many Gigabyte &quot;GA-K8&quot; motherboards: http://www.gigabyte.com.tw/Products/Motherboard/Products_List.aspx?VenderType=AMD&CPUType=socket+939 Which one do you have? </s>
<s> i have the gigabyte GA-K8N51GMF -9 ,according to cpuz. </s>
<s> i have found out that my 2 x 512mb actually runs in dual channel currently, now im not sure if adding a 1gb stick will effect that. </s>
<s> VAPCMD gave you an excellent plan of action to learn how to add more RAM to your motherboard. </s>
<s> According to the manual, having three modules installed &quot;will cause system unable to boot.&quot; I'd stick with what you already have or replace your existing modules with two identical 1GB modules. </s>
<s> You want to believe these folks. </s>
<s> http://www.crucial.com/ And IF that mobo # is correct. </s>
<s> You MUST install ram in pairs. </s>
<s> Your mobo does NOT support dual channel. </s>
<s> Crucial.com says the motherboard does not support dual channel mode. </s>
<s> VS. </s>
<s> The motherboard specifications say it does indeed support dual channel mode. </s>
<s> The manual goes into detail with a table showing which configurations of filled memory slots will enable dual channel mode. </s>
<s> http://www.gigabyte.com.tw/Products/Motherboard/Products_Spec.aspx?ClassValue=Motherboard&ProductID=1939&ProductName=GA-K8N51GMF-9 Whom should we trust???!! </s>
<s> I usually go with the motherboard specifications over Crucial.com. </s>
<s> I'd also make sure that the motherboard BIOS is up to date. </s>
<s> Since Crucial.com takes pride in the accuracy of its information, I guess one could contact them to help clear the fog. </s>
<s> http://www.gigabyte.com.tw/Support/Motherboard/Manual_Model.aspx?ClassValue=Motherboard&ProductID=1950&ProductName=GA-K8N51GMF and I can't find where it noted dual channel memory operation. </s>

<s> many motherboard will activate dual channel if each bank has the same amount of ram. </s>
<s> so you could put your 2 existing 512mb sticks in one bank, and a new 1gb stick in the second bank. </s>
<s> (see your mobo/pc manual to identify which bank a slot is part of.) </s>
<s> if 2gb is your goal, that's probably the best way to go since all 3 sticks will be running at full ddr-400 speed. </s>
<s> thanks, btw..if my memory doesnt run in dual channel why does it say &quot;memory runs at dual-channel&quot; when i boot?? </s>
<s> i no this is a bit of-topic but, if i upgraded to an am2 motherboard and got a x2 am2 processor, will i need to get ddr2 memory or can i still use ddr on a ddr2 motherboard??? </s>
<s> thanks in advance </s>
<s> RE: you question... thanks, btw..if my memory doesnt run in dual channel why does it say &quot;memory runs at dual-channel&quot; when i boot?? </s>
<s> Not sure I follow the question...sounds like you ARE taking advantage of the dual channel architecture with your 2-512MBs DIMMs in DIMM slots 1 and 3. </s>
<s> It simply takes 2 DIMMs ...usually matching (same capacity, same speed) to complete the circuitry design. </s>
<s> i no this is a bit of-topic but, if i upgraded to an am2 motherboard and got a x2 am2 processor, will i need to get ddr2 memory or can i still use ddr on a ddr2 motherboard??? </s>
<s> thanks in advance Don't know of any AM2 MBs that use DDR..the design is for DDR2 and if you found such a MB, you'd suboptimize system performance. </s>
<s> The only good new is DDR2 has dropped in prices rather dramatically since Christmas. </s>
