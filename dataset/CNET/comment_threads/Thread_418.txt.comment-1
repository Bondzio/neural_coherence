WinXP all updates dell latitude I have a wired LAN and a wireless network both can be active at the same time.
Is there a way to tell a program which one to use, becasue sometimes the speed on one may be more than the other.
Specifically i want my browser (opera) to exclusively use the wireless and other browser (IE) to use the cable LAN (but i think it already does that on its own) So the main question is, how to set opera to use the wireless all the time?
