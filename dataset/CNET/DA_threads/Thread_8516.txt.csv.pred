1.1.1	I have a USB Memory Bar USB Device Flash Drive which I got recently.	St
1.1.2	I was able to use it for a few times but after that when I click on properties it has 0 bytes capacity and the file system is RAW.	St
1.1.3	I could not format it because it says &quot;write protected&quot; but I know that it is not write protected, since it is not the type with a write-protect notch/switch.	St
1.1.4	I always safe-remove it whenever I use it.	St
1.1.5	Please help, thank you.I am using Windows XP Service Pack 2	Polite

1.3.2	My flash drive of 2GB stopped writing at under 1GB and I got the usual write protected message and tried a number of things on the internet.	St
1.3.3	In the end I started the PC in safe mode and right clicked the drive to format it.	St
1.3.4	It started but then near the end came up with a cannot complete this action message.	St
1.3.5	Having restarted the PC normally I right clicked the drive again and this time it began formatting normally.	St
1.3.6	Problem solved I hope!!	St
