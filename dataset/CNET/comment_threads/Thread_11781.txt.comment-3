It appears your flash drive isn't supported by the 'school system' as it wasn't installed on it.
It just isn't generic enough to be accepted, though I'm sure a plain flash drive is.
See, if the school will allow an install so you can proceed, if not see what products are supported.
It may mean the school system needs to be updated as a possible another source of the problem.
