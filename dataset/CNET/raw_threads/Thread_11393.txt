Now, it seems that the CD/DVD drive doesn't work anymore. You can't see it on 'My computer' and when you put a disk or a DVD in, nothing happens. Everything else seems to be ok, all other drives are present, and all USB devices are recognised and work fine. Does anyone have any experience of this happening, or have any ideas on how to fix it? Cheers, Ray
