i have the 8560 too.
the waking up is really annoying , but that is how it keeps the ink from getting too solid if you don't use it.
i do see the issue with ink scratching off on stardream.
if you print and then cut through it, it will flake right off.
so, now i don't design with bleeds which kills me!
i hate that it dictate how i need to design.
i bought the xerox 6180 laser to do envelopes since the solid ink doesn't mail well (smudges off), but stardream doesn't handle too well.
the colors separate so you can literally see cmyk as separate pieces.
i think ultimately, laser is the way to go cause it doesn't come off, but i haven't found a good one yet with good enough quality or that can handle envelopes (tried an oki and sent it back).
on another topic, anyone found a good paper cutter?
i am constantly realigning mine and it still cuts crooked!
so if i'm lucky enough to get a good print job, half the time it gets messed up by the darm cutter.
ahhhh!
if only the printers and cutters would cooperate!
