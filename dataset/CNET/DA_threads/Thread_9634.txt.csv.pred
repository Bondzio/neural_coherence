1.1.1	Hello everybody, n00b here!	St
1.1.2	I've been having a very annoying problem with my computer lately, and I'm hoping someone here might be able to help.	St
1.1.3	Basically I have an Emprex-make DVD Rewriter in my computer (running Win XP Pro), and I never used to have any trouble with it.	St
1.1.4	However, a few months ago I installed Norton Systemworks/Antivirus 2006, and ever since then there's been some serious rebooting issues.	St
1.1.5	From what I can gather, it only seems to happen when I put in a CD-R/DVD-R (whether blank or already written onto), &quot;commercial&quot; discs seem to work fine.	St
1.1.6	Occasionally it may read as normal and I can use it, but more often than not the computer will just reboot itself as soon as I put the disc in.	St
1.1.7	It will continue rebooting until I take the disc back out.	St
1.1.8	I don't know if the Norton programs are the cause for any of this, but it has only been happening since they were installed.	St
1.1.9	Would anybody have any suggestions or advice on why this is happening and how it might be solved?	Ques
1.1.10	I'm happy to supply any other system specs if necessary.	St
1.1.11	Any assistance is greatly appreciated.	St
1.1.12	Thanks in advance.	St
1.1.13	DF	St
1.2.1	Uninstall Norton.	St
1.2.2	That will tell you if it indeed is causing the problem.	Sug
1.2.3	It sounds unlikely but one cannot be sure until you try it.	St
1.2.4	If that does not cure it, then you have to look further.	St
1.2.5	My guess is that it is something else.	St
1.2.6	Maybe an update somewhere.	St
