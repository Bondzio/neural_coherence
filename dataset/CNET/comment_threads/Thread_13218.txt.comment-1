I have a wireless UPnP device on my home network, and it stopped accessing media from my main PC's (Vista Home Premium 32 Bit) WMP all of a sudden.
So, I checked Media Sharing in the Network and Sharing Center, and I found that it had been turned &quot;Off&quot;.
When I click &quot;Change&quot;, it opens up the WMP Media Sharing window, but the UPnP device is set to share media, and the &quot;Allow&quot; button is greyed out.
Clicking &quot;Ok&quot; at this point only closes the window, and takes me back to square one (Network and Sharing Center).
I Googled this issue, and found that many people had similar issues with XBox360 or PS#.
However, I could not find a definite solution.
Does anyone have a solution to this problem?
Windows Vista Home Premium 32Bit (SP1) AMD Athlon 64 Dual Core 3800+ 2MB RAM
