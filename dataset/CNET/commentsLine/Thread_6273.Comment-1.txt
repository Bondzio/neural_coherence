hi, i just bought a samsung syncmaster 710n.
everything with this monitor is quite satisfieing to me, but there is a big problem: it seems like windows 2000 (sp4 actually) has a big problem displaying things right through this monitor.
i actually can not really believe that it is the monitor's problem, because i tested it for 45 minutes in the shop before buying it, but that was with a windows xp machine.
it is hard to explain what it looks like, for me mostly like low color quality.
i made a shot of an icon to show you what i mean, but i can not assure that what you see will be the same as what i see:  when i looked at an icon before installing this monitor, it has not looked like a cheap gif,.. it looked like a normal high quality icon.
now this icon i have taken a shot of, shows a lot of single pixels, it looks raw, it does simply not look like it should.
i installed the samsung monitor driver, i have reset the colors, i have auto adjusted several times, i have switched to other resolutions (this tft's optimum is 1280x1024) and switched back again of course - no change at all.
some pictures look really bad.
not like usual tft quality, they look a bit pixelated).
i launched unreal i and had a look at the direct3d performance, same there, strange pixelated graphics and partly unluminated surfaces... i am really out of ideas, solutions or whatever.
i noticed this problem at a friend's place too, quite the same tft (some older samsung) and windows 2000. please do not suggest me to upgrade to xp, i will not do this.
i am running 2000 on a notebook at work and everything is fine, i know it is possible - so please - if you bring ideas, let them be solutions, because there must be one.
thank you for reading and for any suggestions, ideas, solutions.
cheers, leo (ps.
