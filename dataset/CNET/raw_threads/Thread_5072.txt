You'll have to look and find SATA DVDRW drives and cases. http://www.plextor.com/english/products/716SA.htm is listed at 143 bucks so that's one piece of your budget and then you'll get a SATA housing from newegg.com to finish it off. Sorry, but by going external you need to consider the issue of the link speed. Bob
