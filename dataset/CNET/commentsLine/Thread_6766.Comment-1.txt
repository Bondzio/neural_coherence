soundblaster live 24-bit eax console - device supported not detected i just installed a soundblaster live 24-bit 7.1 sound card and logitech x-530 5.1 speakers in my 2ghz celeron 512 mb ram xp home emachines which came with avance audio apapter on the mboard.
i get good sound through the front speakers and subwoofer, but nothing through the rear and center speakers.
when i try to run the creative mediasource player's eax console through the tools menu in organizer (there is no green eax button), which i believe is what i need to turn on surround sound for this card, i just get an error message, ''the audio device supported by this application is not detected.
the application will exit''.
and it won't run.
i also installed the dfx master pack of audio plug-ins for winamp, win media player and others, but when i try to use them i get no sound at all in those programs.
when i originally ran the install program for the soundblaster live, as it started i got this error:'' setup could not detect any soundblaster live!
24-bit on your system.
please ensure that you soundblaster hardware is properly installed before running this setup program.
setup will now exit''.
but then the install runs as if normal and ends with: ''congratulations!
your sound card was successfully installed'' then i reboot as asked.
i've done this 3 times ending up with the same problem i described above.
i've checked the card position and the speaker wires several times and they all are correct.
the sb live is thedefault sound card on the system.
can you please help?
