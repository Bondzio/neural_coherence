so, the windows 7 installer couldn't see your hard drive?
make sure your computer actually sees it: when you start up your computer, try poking around the bios to make sure that it can see your hard drive.
you can access the bios by hitting whatever key is next to setup when you start up your computer and see the manufacturer logo.
if it does not specify a key, try f2.
make sure you do not change anything.
if you mess up something here, it can seriously screw up your system.
the drive listing may be under &quot;devices&quot; or &quot;boot devices&quot;...sorry, i don't know your particular motherboard.
