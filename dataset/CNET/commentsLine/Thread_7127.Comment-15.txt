just to let you all know i successfully installed a new athlon barton core 3000+ socket a cpu & an addional 2 gb of low density memory in both slot's & it went off without a glitch & very fast too.
didn't even have to re-register the wxphome os to ms. no messages popped up in the system tray asking me to do so with a 30 day waiting period.
the only problem i have now is a unknown device yellow exclamation mark in device manager is present & all hardware is working fine.
installed the driver's for the asus mobo as well at the first.
at first when i installed the mobo i had no sound but fixed that by loading soundmax driver's & rebooted & it works fine now.
the last thing i have making me scratch my head is when i went to instaling ms updates, it would not install all that was needed & sent me that message telling me they could not be installed.
it had about 90 to install & 30 of them could not be installed relating to ms office 8 software.
i went ahead & installed ie 8 & that's where it all began.
ms office was where it started & not installing all the software ms office software.
my dad only uses this machine to play games & nothing more cause he has no internet connection & no package deal with his service provider to do so as of yet.
he said he has no intensions of getting on the net.
i had it home in my computer workshop to do all the updates & installation of the mobo,memory,cpu,driver's & such.
