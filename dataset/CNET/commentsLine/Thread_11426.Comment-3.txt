network = two or more computers connected together.
lan = local area network = just another name for a smaller network (such as the one you will create in your home).
you could connect two computers with one crossover network cable to form a two computer network (no hub, switch, or router needed).
not very versatile, though.
today, the simplest way to create a network is to get a router and connect all computers to it with network cable (not crossover cable).
if you get a broadband router, you can plug your cable/dsl/other into it, so that all connected computers may share the internet service.
get a wireless broadband router (and compatible wireless network adapters) to add wireless connection capabilities.
if the linux distribution has a proper driver for the network adapter installed in the computer, you shouldn't have problems.
just connect all computers to a router.
