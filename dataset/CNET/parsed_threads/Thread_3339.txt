<s> What do you rate this computer? </s>
<s> I am not one to recommend all in one units unless that is the only way you can go with a puter. </s>
<s> They are just laptops on steroids and if it needs to be serviced after warranty it is going to cost you more. </s>
<s> That is a good price for what your getting but you could very well lose the money your going to save if it has problems after the warranty expires. </s>
<s> Did you read the reviews, they were all one stars. </s>
<s> I would keep looking. </s>
<s> Worry if you would be upset by repair costs later. </s>
<s> It's not like a desktop where you change this or that. </s>
<s> But with the Nvidia GPU and the nice CPU you may find a gamer using it. </s>
