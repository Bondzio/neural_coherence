i'm surprised no one mentioned this.
everyone loves the lower cost external drives, but most like to buy the units that power off the usb port.
problem is that many laptops and older desktops do not supply enough power to run them.
even newer laptops sometimes only carry 60 watt power supplies.
older desktops often only have a 200 watt power supply.
if this user has an external drive that does not include it's own power source, find someone (maybe even a pc store) that has 300+watt power pc and see if that works.
he may need to replace his power supply unit.
