you system is few years old and you have 64 mbyte and 128 mbyte installed so that also tells me it is a few years old.
since you have to match ram, it probably is cheaper with the rebates offer to throw out the old and replace with new boards.
you have to check, crucial site may tell you or check your motherboards manual.
see if your motherboard will support 1 512 mbyte ram board....you will get a good deal 512 mbyte w/ rebate....if it does not support 512mbyte then get 2 256 mbytes.
unless of course you want to try a 1 gig.
but 512 mbyte provide the most beneficial, noticible results.
dimm boards you push straight down.
the old simm cards (sdram) were inserted at an angle.
pry apart the clamps on each side of the ram board and left it out and yes it takes a good force to put in a new board
