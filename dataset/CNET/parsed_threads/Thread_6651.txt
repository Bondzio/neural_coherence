<s> I am looking at buying a new monitor and am wondering whether to get a CRT or LCD monitor. </s>
<s> Which is more reliable, recommeneded, or is likely to last the longest? </s>
<s> http://ergo.human.cornell.edu/Pub/LCD_vs_CRT_AH.pdf is a professors view on the issue http://www.displaymate.com/crtvslcd.html contains great information http://www.esreality.com/?a=post&id=998525 is a discussion on the subject http://www.it.canterbury.ac.nz/department/newsletters/nlaug03/monitor.htm is just an advice All of this comes from a google search for crt versus lcd or crt versus lcd -tv to exclude information on TV's. </s>
<s> Happy reading! </s>
