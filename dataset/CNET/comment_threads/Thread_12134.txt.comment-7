Since this would be the first webcam I'm getting obviously I haven't any experience with them.
I'm not panning your lighting tips though.
Sorry if you got that impression.
What I was getting at though, was you said that the camera I saw was no different from the ones you owned.
So I'm asking, what would be different?
Thanks for the link.
Unfortunately, I am at work now so I can't view Youtube links.
But I will check it out at home.
