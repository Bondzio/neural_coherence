i want to thank everyone for their input.
my problem was solved by a telephone call from my isp.
they don't support fiber optic connections so the whole thing is moot.
i still think the problem can be solved by some kind of switching hardware.
after all, isp's surely don't have thousands of physical lines to the internet.
rather they probably only have one or two and route their customers through them.
anyway, thank you again.
