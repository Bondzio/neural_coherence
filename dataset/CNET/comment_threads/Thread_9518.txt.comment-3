and you probably know more about this than me, but I wonder if this is something we can all do manually in Firefox, in the browser's about:config ?
HTTP Pipelining and HTTP max-connections.
Have a look at what is said here; http://techfragments.com/news/538/Software/The_12_Best_Firefox_AboutConfig_Performance_Tweaks.html I don't know how this would be done in Chrome, and if configuration is disabled in that browser then it is possible these may already be set higher by default.
Just a thought.
