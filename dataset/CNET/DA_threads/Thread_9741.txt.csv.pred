1.1.1	I'm in the process of upgrading my old p3 processor and I'm a bit confused.	St
1.1.2	I have a p3 600 (coppermine), does that mean my motherboard is a slot 1?	St
1.1.3	or a slot 370?	St
1.1.4	thank you	Polite
1.2.1	It could be either.	St
1.2.2	Open the case and look.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	it says 600eb/256/133/1.65v s1 can I safely assume that s1 means socket 1?	St
1.4.1	The form factor for me is a gimme.	St
1.4.2	The slot one has a big ole BRICK unit for the CPU and the 370 is pretty square with the usual heatsink and fan on top.	St
1.4.3	Did you look?	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	it's pretty rectangular it has a heatsink, no fan though	St
1.6.1	To see what can be done, the make/model of the motherboard is needed to find what CPUs can be fitted.	St
1.6.2	It's rare to find a fanless P3.	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
