I was excited about it because it has an eSATA port, and so does my mobo. So thinking I'd finally get to utilized my computer's eSATA capabilities and that backing things up would be so much quicker, I spent the extra money on the drive and an eSATA cable (drive didn't come with one ). I got everything up and running and started to transfer some stuff to the drive, but it seemed to me the transfers were going a lot slower than they should. After all, eSATA boasts speeds of 3GB/s. So I downloaded a little app called HD Tune to test my transfer rates, and here's what I got: with eSATA connected - 20.5MB/s burst with USB2.0 connected - 25.6MB/s burst What the hell is going on here? Not only is the eSATA not moving very fast, but the USB is actually faster than it! The only thought I had is that either my computer doesn't have it's eSATA configured correctly, or I bought a bum eSATA cable. Here is the cable I bought: http://www.amazon.com/36IN-Esata-Signal-Cable-7PIN/dp/B000IAJZ76/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-1416624-5455203?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1178737372&sr=8-1 and here is a link to my mobo info: http://www.neoseeker.com/Articles/Hardware/Reviews/p5wd2/ Does anyone know what might be going on?

497	3	247198	2485542	2484101	djbeema	5/12/07 7:35 PM	1.1789985E12	yeah	Yeah I just flashed the latest BIOS and the Sata drivers haven't been updated in 2 years according to the asus downloads page, so I have all those. Seems odd that the mobo would have an eSATA port just because, and not actually have it working to eSATA standards

If set as such, DON'T hot-plug/unplug or you risk losing data. Also partition the disk as extended and format the logical drive in NTFS for better security and data integrity.

In addition to my onboard SATA II 3.0 Gbps ports, I am using a Promise SATA150 TX4 PCI adapter, which only has a 1.5 Gbps transfer rate (long story why I am using the old controller, so I won't go into it). I attached two drives to this adapter: a Seagate 320 GB ST3320620AS SATA II 7200.10 internal drive, and the Seagate FreeAgent Pro 500 GB drive via an eSata back panel adapter. I am using Linux on a Core 2 Quad Q6600 system, so raw power is not likely to be a limiting factor. I first noticed the speed differential when I ran a large copy (31 GB) to each drive. The FreeAgent drive was a LOT slower, IIRC, 23 minutes vs 10 minutes. I then ran timings, with all OS buffering disabled, using the Linux hdparm utility. I decided that I would time the transfer rate from the disk on-board cache, to factor out variations. The command I used was hdparm --direct -T /dev/sdX I was very disturbed to see that the FreeAgent Pro consistently did read transfers about 46% slower than the 320 GB drive - ON THE SAME CONTROLLER. Specifically, about 86 MB/s for the 320GB and about 68 MB/s for the FreeAgent Pro. Now this is supposed to be reading directly from the drive's cache, which should return the maximum transfer rate of the drive electronics, regardless of the disk's mechanical characteristics. Just for comparison, I ran the same command for the same 320 GB model, but on a SATA II 3.0 Gb/s on-board internal port. The transfer rate for that was 200 MB/s!! I have not tried the FreeAgent Pro on a SATA II port, but I suspect it will not fare a lot better. Finally, I ran some diagnostics on the drives, and the FreeAgent Pro does not have NCQ (the 320 GB model does). I don't know if this would make a significant difference. It *is* a SATA II 3.0 Gbps drive, so that's not the issue. One way or another, I am sorely disappointed and am going to return the drive. Pity - it is pretty looking, and big, but why is it so slow? I am wondering if Seagate decided to save on costs and is using the same (slow) back-end circuitry for both the USB 2.0 and eSATA connectors? Maybe their marketing people thought it was a good selling point to include eSATA, but who uses eSATA anyway? By the time enough people were actually using eSATA to notice, they would have brought out a new model that really does run at SATA II speeds. Maybe I am just being too cynical.

Could you explain to me how you set it up so that it's doing 68mb/s? even that is better than what I'm getting right now. all I know is seagate just lost a customer

That could make a difference?&quot; Are you leaving the drive connected to the USB port, while you're trying to use the eSATA connection? If so, it might be defaulting to the slower connection, or somesuch. If you've already tried only connecting one port at a time, then I don't know what else to try. This might be in the same category of questions as &quot;is it plugged in&quot;, but I can see how someone might not think of this as a potential issue.
497	8	247198	2504012	2483661	shot34ever	6/3/07 8:12 AM	1.18085832E12	Many causes!!	The problem may be with your external hard drive. First, be sure you have your Operating system up to date with the latest updates, latest bios update, etc, and check to see if your system recognizes the sata mode of the drive. I would also think that the file systems should match, HTFS file system of your computer to HTFS file system of your External hard drive, not sure if this would make any difference, but it may. I have a WD my book and am debating switching from USB 2.0 to eSATA.
497	9	247198	2504018	2483661	Kees Bakker	6/3/07 8:47 AM	1.18086042E12	What exactly is inside?	A standard drive with some electronics to have USB and eSATA ports? Or a SATA drive with some electronics to add a USB port? http://asia.cnet.com/reviews/pcperipherals/accessories/0,39053287,40574900p-2,00.htm didn't test the eSATA speed, but they 'expect' it to be much higher. http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,129566/article.html notes 80 seconds for 3 Gb of files and folders in eSATA mode, but doesn't mention USB speed. And just a bunch of files isn't the best speed test imaginable, of course. Anyway, you've got a perfect point when returning it. The product data sheet on their website ( http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/products/external/freeagent_pro_data_movers/ ) just mentions the theoretical maximum (480 Mb/s for USB, 3 Gb/s for eSata) under the heading &quot;performance spec&quot;. They surely can't deliver that, so whatever it is, it's not a performance spec, as your measurements show. Hope you find the problem, however. It's a nice looking drive. Kees

It's been much longer than that, so I don't really think I have any recourse. Just stuck with a mediocre drive that sucked me in because it was flashy.

I upgraded the firmware using http://support.seagate.com/rightnow/downloads/FA_Pro_eSATA_Update.zip and it helped a bunch. Now I get 40MB/s average and 79MB/s burst rates (as per HD Tune). Make sure you follow all the steps given in the PDF. Also, I had to turn off the drive for like 30sec before re-using it after the upgrade. Any other solution around?

After 2 hours on phone with level 2 support (half of the time I was on hold)... the stupid level 2 support rep. suggested that I go out and buy a eSATA controller and not use the one that's built onto my motherboard (Asus A8R32-MVP Deluxe). I asked him about the firmware upgrade and he said that it probably would not help and I should take his advice and buy a dedicated eSATA controller and give support a call back if I am still experiencing the same issue. I told him he's an idiot and hung up on him. Anyways... my FreeAgent's firmware is currently at 40.0A. What's the new firmware version? And what transfer rates are you getting with it?

I do believe you would need to work from a SATA drive to get the full speed (300MB/s). When I get some time I'll try to use an older IDE drive on a SATA converter and see if it improves anything. I do believe the max speed for IDE is 133 as opposed to 300 for the SATA, but my guess is most of the slow speed problem comes from the conversion from one standard to the other. If anybody has tried that already (or simply has a SATA drive), please let me know!!!

I have to really push hard for it to actually stay connected... with HDTune I was getting about 50Mb/sec initially but again with having to hold the connector in is NOT the way to go for me.

There's some weird stuff they cannot account for with that bracket. If you want to achieve the drive's full potential... you will need to get a true eSATA controller. I didn't like that answer... but I caved and went out to my local Fry's and got a PCI Express x1 eSATA controller (SI3132 chipset). Sure enough... it worked out for me. I had a Foxconn 6150B motherboard and was using a bracket. I was getting 30MB/sec sustained transfer rate and the drive was erroring out after waking my computer up from sleep. Connected it to the PCI Express x2 eSATA controller... I get a sustained transfer rate of about 49 MB/sec and it works just fine after waking up from sleep.

Please use HD Tune so we start from a common basis and list your internal hard drive type (IDE, SATA, magnetic tape?!), average speed and burst speed and same for your FreeAgent. Because after messing around with my FreeAgent on a SATA to eSATA bracket, I get: 45MB/s average, 82MB/s burst. My IDE drive gives me: 52MB/s average, 91MB/s burst. I also ran HD Tune on a laptop (VAIO with Intel T5500, 1GB RAM, 80GB HDD) and got: 32MB/s average, 92MB/s burst. Not really sure it's comparable since I don't really know how laptops work.

I do some video editing and 3 - 10 GB files are not unusual. My primary interest was eSata - USB2 and FireWire are ok, but...... This thing flat out sucks. I read these postings, tried the firmware upgrade, and no joy. See www.precise.ca/esata for test results. I thought after the firmware upgrade it started to look pretty good, but then tried my real world test - transfer 2 large .avi totalling 3.3 GB. Took 2:22 on USB2; 2:04 on FireWire, and an astounding 12 minutes and 44 saeconds with eSata......that's after the firmware upgrade. I was so puzzled I ran HD Tune again, and totally different results - 2.5 MB/sec min, max, avg AND burst. I don't know where to begin to look at this point. System is a 4 year old Shuttle SB65G2 with on board sata support - I have a 160GB Seagate Sata as my main (and only) harddrive in the box. I'm connecting to the FreeAgent with one of those adapter dealies that connects to the Sata connector on the main board and out through the case to an eSata connector. Drive seems to work ok, and seems to be recognized, but sloooooowwwwww. Any ideas? Thx.....Randy

He jumpered his drive to SATA I (1.5 GB/s) and that made a big difference. This explains why buying a separate eSATA adapter works better. It's apparently not Seagate's fault at all (the drive in the above article is a WD). It seems that the onboard SATA connectors often just don't have enough grunt to drive the bracket/second cable properly. I wonder if anyone makes a bracket that has a built-in signal booster?

My computer has an eSATA jack built directly into the motherboard that I plugged my drive into. So I don't know if that makes a difference? I'm a bit confused figuring out exactly what you mean.

I had to also buy an esata bracket and cable. I connected the esata bracket to the internal sata ports. It was very quirky. Sometimes it would work and other times it would completely lock up my system. I tried using the USB connection and that worked fine. But I purchased an esata drive specifically for the speed. I returned the drive to buy.com where I purchased it. I'm still waiting for a refund. The drive was to be used exclusively for system backup. In the meantime I purchased a WD internal 500G hard drive for backup. I don't know why I didn't think of going with a second internal drive in the first place. ~eddie

One problem is ....what if your system is hit by a lightening strike and takes out both HDDs ? Or if your dwelling home goes up in smoke ? Sometimes we don't think of such events but to be sure, they can happen and the best backup plans address them. I backup (image copy) to an internal and copy the images to an external HDD which I (sometimes) take to work. VAPCMD
