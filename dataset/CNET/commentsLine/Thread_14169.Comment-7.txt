thank you for the response you gave me.
as you've mentioned about coming into a mac forum and complaining about macs and the like, it was obviously not my intention to step on anyones feelings about their macs.
just like giving an elbow to a fellow raver and not meaning it, the struck raver shouldnt get too upset because it was not an evil intention.
the struck raver shouldnt exaggerate the events and make a mountain out of a mole hill.
the real problem is a misunderstanding of intentions.
if it was perceived that i wanted to challenge mac users, telling them that their macs sux, then i was obviously massively misunderstood.
i hope that you can understand my sincerity that i want to be educated and not get involved in a demeaning war.
ive read forums about how other people bag on pcs (and are doing so incorrectly) but i kindly direct them to informative info so that they can fully understand the full picture.
i would assume that if it is the case that macs are very good machines, you would be able to set me straight (which you have attempted to do).
hopefully there are no hurt feelings, but i would hope that the struck raver would initially &quot;think the best of another&quot; so that these &quot;fights&quot; dont emerge like they so often do.
so... i apologize that there is always that level of misunderstanding and miscommunication that comes with language (especially over the internet).
help me to love macs as you do and maybe i can be on the other side of the fence in the future.
have a great day!
