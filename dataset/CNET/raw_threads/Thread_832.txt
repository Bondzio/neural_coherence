I bridged it fine... i think xD it says its all connected but the other computer still doesnt get internet, and when i try to repair i get an error on both the computers that says something about conflicting ip adresses... i read another post about this but it completely threw me(im not exactly the best when it comes to computers :P). i tried ipconfig to check if they were same ip but one of the computers just gave me a bunch of gibberish in the ip section(EX: fe80::2e0:18ff and so on....). think anyone could explain simply how i can fix this(if you need any info about 1 of my computers i prolly wont know it but ill try my best to tell you lol).

Here's some fodder for you to work with. Note; Since ICS is finicky and you must get it right I won't offer much support for it. You can swap the internet to the WIFI connections for ICS so here's the article. http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/networking/expert/bowman_02april08.mspx
