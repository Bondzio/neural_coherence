<s> I'm getting a new computer soon, and I was wondering what is the best gaming PC I could get for under $700. </s>

<s> The only good gaming PC I've found so far that fits in my budget is the Dell XPS 7100, but since this is a year old, I didn't know if better ones had come out. </s>
<s> Gaming continues to lean heavily on the video card. </s>
<s> Here's a link of cards that I always suggest checking out when shopping for such -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-gaming-graphics-card-geforce-gtx-590-radeon-hd-6990,2879.html If you took your XPS 7100 and popped a nice card into it, you'd have a nice gamer machine for most of us. </s>

<s> Our review in http://reviews.cnet.com/desktops/dell-studio-xps-7100/4505-3118_7-34117339.html mentions $1149. </s>

<s> I haven't actually bought the XPS, so should I buy it and then put a new video card in it, or should I buy a newer computer altogether? </s>
<s> Gamers tend to be a finicky bunch. </s>
<s> Some must have the high end cards. </s>
<s> Some must have a machine that &quot;looks&quot; a certain way. </s>
<s> Here we have 700 bucks so you have to search what's out there at that price and see what fits. </s>
<s> Unless you get some ready to use machine 200 bucks could be used up just on Windows. </s>
<s> So the budget is much less than what you may be happy with. </s>
<s> Share with the forum what you found so far. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> The world is a big place. </s>
<s> So it's not possible for me to find the 700 dollar unit in most countries. </s>
<s> That review was a year ago, and the price has dropped to $550 for the least expensive model. </s>
<s> But don't try to save on the video card. </s>
<s> And I think 4 GB RAM is the minimum for a gaming PC. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> The &quot; 1GB ATI Radeon HD 5870&quot; is way up there on the GPU list so GAMING should be nice and fine. </s>
