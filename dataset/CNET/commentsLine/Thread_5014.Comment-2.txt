1. buy a usb cable to connect the printer to your laptop.
2. don't configure the printer to use the college wireless network (see chapter 2 of the user manual how to configure it, so just don't do that).
then the printer can only be used from your laptop.
3. tell your buddies to use the guest account on your laptop and put the files they want to print on a usb-stick.
no need to use wireless connection here, i think.
