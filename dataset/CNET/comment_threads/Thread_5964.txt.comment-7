The same thing happened to my 15&quot; MAG LCD.
It is not the Power Supply; it is rather the Backlight Inverter Module to blame (see picture linked below).
On my Inverter board one of the high voltage transformers shorted out and the backlight would turn on for two seconds, slightly dimmer than usual, and then will go off.
A skilled technician may fix the module on the component level if you find exact replacement miniature HV transformer (good luck with that!
), or you may simply buy replacement inverter board for about seventy bucks a pop.
It may not be worth to repair since LCD monitors are cheap these days.
Here's a link with picture of the inverter board: http://www.lcdpart.com/Products/qpwbgl9931dldmss.html I'm not affiliated in any way with the above, just posting what I found out.
