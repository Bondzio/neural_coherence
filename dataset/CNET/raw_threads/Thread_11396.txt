So yes, the drivers will still work after 30 days, but how do I transfer files without a manager/file transfer app? I must be missing something... All I want to do I transfer files between my cell phone. I'm thinking the USB cord is faster and more efficient...

Here I didn't install the &quot;manager&quot; but use Vista's native Bluetooth manager. Sorry but I don't duplicate web content or help content included with the OS. I only fill in the hard to find items. Bob

I have a Dell Studio 540 I purchased recently, and it's running 64 bit Vista Premium. When I go to control panal/hardware and sound, all I get is Bluetooth Local COM, which is NOT a bluetooth wizard, just a list of COM ports. If I search for bluetooth wizard, I get no result. It is also not in the accessories file like everyone says. When I run fsquirt.exe, I get an error saying windows cannot find it. How do I not have the wizard/where can I get it?
