when i check for a firmware update i am told it is &quot;up to date&quot;.
the unit is also outside the warranty period.
i did purchase a netgear wpnt834 rangemax 4-port switch 240 mbps mimo 802.11g/b wireless router, since i found it for around $75 (which may have been an error).
i will see if that works any better, though having a spare is not a bad idea either.
