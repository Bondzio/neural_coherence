Since this is just IDE all that I can suspect is that the BIOS is not showing the drive either.
More about popping in the old XP Boot Manager at http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=REINSTALL+XP+BOOTLOADER I agree with the command set of: bootcfg /rebuild fixboot fixmbr Be at the ready with a backup clone of that hard disk as there was a BETA OS installed so all may just vanish without notice.
