1.1.1	Hello I have a very weird problem here , concerning my UPS .	St
1.1.2	And this is the second UPS !	St
1.1.3	The first one was a & quot ; Orbit & quot ; 600 VA model , and now i have a new & quot ; Street Line & quot ; 1000 VA one .	St
1.1.4	Both of them show precisely the same strange behaviour .	St
1.1.5	When my PC is on , and the power goes out , the PC goes off too !	St
1.1.6	The UPS wo n't back up as it is supposed to do .	St
1.1.7	When i turn the UPS then off and on again , it wo n't start - just beeps short and stays off .	St
1.1.8	If i unplug the computer ( !	St
1.1.9	) , i can start the UPS !	St
1.1.10	I can then even plug the computer back in , and boot it - so the battery in the UPS is fine and has certainly enough power to keep the computer going for more than half an hour .	St
1.1.11	I tested it with several other electrical devices - all of them stay on when i simulate a power failure by switching off the breaker .	St
1.1.12	I tried with a fan , my home stereo , a small washing machine ( 600 watts ) and my 21 & quot ; CRT television plus satellite receiver .	St
1.1.13	All of these devices nicely stay on when the power goes .	St
1.1.14	So why does n't the computer ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.15	My computer consists of a 365 watts ENERMAX PSU which is only about a year old , a ASUS A7A-133 MoBo , ATHLON XP 1800+ CPU , 2 HDD 's , 2 CD drives , every PCI slot used etc and a 17 & quot ; LCD monitor which is just 2 months old .	St
1.1.16	The computer itself works absolutely perfect , no power problems whatsoever .	St
1.1.17	I apreciate any help i can get , because i can ; t just keep buying UPS 's until i find one that does the job - i already have two that work just perfect with everything except my PC , and i ca n't refund those because they , well , work .	St
1.1.18	The fault must be with the computer - somehow .	St
1.1.19	Kind regards ... .. Thanh	Polite
1.2.1	may be fussy about the waveform being generated by the UPS is the computer .	St
1.2.2	Some of the early UPS 's simply made a somewhat square wave , the newer [ better ? ]	Ques
1.2.3	ones make something that more closely approximates a sine wave .	St
1.2.4	Never heard of the two brands that you mention .	St
1.2.5	Maybe try one by APC , or go to their website to read up on the subject .	St
1.3.1	of UPS 's .	St
1.3.2	One is always using the battery to power the output while the battery is constantly being float charged .	St
1.3.3	The other actually transfers from one to the other .	St
1.3.4	If this transfer is the problem , it may be possible to go into the PC 's BIOS and change the Power Management settings .	St
1.3.5	Maybe set it so that the power off button has to be held in for 4 secs before it will turn the system off .	St
1.3.6	One thing about an ATX system is that if you shut it off , you must wait a short time [ maybe 10 or so seconds ] before you can turn it on .	Sug
1.3.7	Has to do with the discharge of capacitors in the power control circuits .	St
1.3.8	Possibly the UPS causes it to momentarily shut off and then the voltage comes back before the turn on logic will work properly .	St
1.3.9	Of course , this still means a reboot which is not at all what the purpose the UPS is supposed to do .	St
1.4.1	Could be as simple as having the PC plugged into an outlet that is NOT battery-protected .	St
1.4.2	On my APC , all plugs are surge-protected , but only half are battery-protected .	St
1.4.3	chuck	St
1.5.1	Hello , and thanks for all replies Since my PSU is rather new and of a renowned brand ( Enermax ) i suppose it is a good one ?	Ques
1.5.2	I do n't know about wave forms tough ... ... ... . what can be done in that regards ?	Ques
1.5.3	About the & quot ; handover & quot ; , both of my UPS units are of the type that switches to battery when the AC power goes , you can hear the relays clicking when that happens .	St
1.5.4	And all of the outlets ( there are only four of them ) are battery covered , yes .	St
1.5.5	I describe the problem a bit more exact : If the AC power goes out ( failure , or i switch the breaker ) while the computer is on , the UPS along with all connected devices shuts off - it bvriefly beeps and clicks , and then dies as if the battery was empty .	St
1.5.6	It will then refuse to start again , exactly as if the battery was flat - when i turn the UPS switch off and on again .	Sug
1.5.7	However when i unplug the computer ( only the machine , not monitor , printer or anything else that 's on the UPS ) i CAN switch the UPS back on !	St
1.5.8	And once it 's on i can even connect the PC again , it will stay on ( this is while AC power is still off ) .	St
1.5.9	I can then proceed to start the PC , boot normally and keep it going for quite some time before the battery REALLY goes flat .	St
1.5.10	If there are other devices connected to the UPS , such as a TV , a stereo or even a rather power-hungry small washing machine , these devices will stay on ( along with the UPS ) when AC goes off .	St
1.5.11	So it 's definitely only the actual PC that 's causing this UPS shutdown .	St
1.5.12	And i have two different UPS 's which show exactly the same behaviour , despite being of different brands and different power ratings .	St
1.5.13	The issue with the & quot ; wave form & quot ; sounds logical to me , but what can i do about it ?	Ques
1.5.14	Shield the wires somehow ?	Ques
1.5.15	Add grounding ?	Ques
1.5.16	( my apartment has no grounding , as most electrical outlets in Bangkok are fed by only two wires ) .	St
1.5.17	I appreciate any help i can get Kind regards ... .. your Thanh	Polite
1.6.1	you have things plugged wrong .	St
1.6.2	A washing machine ?	Ques
1.6.3	That should be on a wall plug on a different circuit than your electronics if possible .	St
1.6.4	The TV , stereo , etc should be on the surge-only side .	St
1.6.5	The PC and anything that will lose data or be harmed by suddenly being shut off should be on one of the battery-protected plugs .	St
1.6.6	If you do this and still have the same problem , I would say you may have a battery that 's not taking a charge .	St
1.6.7	chuck	St
1.7.1	Hello Thank you very much for reply .	St
1.7.2	However you did n't read it all ... . - UPS has only four outlets , and all are battery-backed .	St
1.7.3	No surge-only outlets available .	St
1.7.4	- Washing machine is small , portable model - 600 watts only .	St
1.7.5	- Washing machine , TV , stereo and fan were connected only for testing purpose , one at a time , to see if the UPS would work with them .	St
1.7.6	- Battery is perfectly ok , after diconnecting computer i can restart UPS , then reconnect computer , and use as if normal .	St
1.7.7	Normally connected to the UPS are computer , monitor , printer and power adaptor for external DSL modem .	St
1.7.8	Problem occurs even when computer is alone connected - so problem MUST be with the computer .	St
1.7.9	Kind regards ... . Thanh	Polite
1.8.1	Go to control panel , poerformance and maintanence , power options , and select the UPS tab , and select your UPS 's manufacturer .	St
1.9.1	I forgot that part .	St
1.9.2	Never saw a UPS with all plugs being battery-protected .	St
1.9.3	I 'll take your word since you are looking at it .	St
1.9.4	That being said , Sgt brought up an important issue .	St
1.9.5	Did you run the set-up program that came with UPS ?	Ques
1.9.6	Unless you did , the computer is not tied to the UPS and will act as it has .	St
1.9.7	Good luck .	Polite
1.9.8	chuck	St
1.10.1	Hello Again thank you for replying and trying to help me .	Polite
1.10.2	I have only once , EVER , seen a UPS here which had a serial sort of port to be hooked up with a computer , and that UPS did cost more than my computer .	St
1.10.3	The only connectors that mine ( both ! )	St
1.10.4	have are four electricity outlets , of which two are three-prong and two are two-prong , all four are backed up by the battery and have a surge protection .	St
1.10.5	Further there are phone - line in and line out , which provides a surge protection as well .	St
1.10.6	And that 's it .	St
1.10.7	No other means of connecting it to the computer , and no setup program whatsoever .	St
1.10.8	When i go to the power options as suggested , it will ask for the serial port in use - narda , do n't have that .	St
1.10.9	This UPS is supposed to simply switch to battery power in the moment the AC goes , and it DOES that - for every device except the bloody computer .	St
1.10.10	I think i am ready to give up on the whole issue and just thread is at a surge protection - better than nothing since once i had a PSU go up in smoke when they operated major welding machines at a neighbouring construction site , which luckily has become a finished apartment building meantime .	St
1.10.11	With kind regards ... ... your Thanh	St
1.11.1	First thing I would look at would be to ensure the switch over rate for that UPS is fast enough .	St
1.11.2	In other words , you may need a 8 millisecond rate to keep the computer going but the UPS is only switching at 10 millisecond .	St
1.11.3	( these rates are not actual , just used as example ) I would suspect you will find your problem there .	St
