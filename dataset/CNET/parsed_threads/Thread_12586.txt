<s> Hi, I recently deleted an autorun.inf, and some other worm-like files from my 500gb Western Digital &quot;My Book&quot;. </s>
<s> I noticed the mystery files when my permissions would not allow me to write to this usb drive. </s>
<s> At the time, I tried to create a folder on my external hard drive and save data in this newly created folder. </s>
<s> The write failed and consequently I was unable to delete the folder I just created. </s>
<s> Then I deleted autorun.inf. </s>
<s> I also have a &quot;System Volume Information&quot; folder and several sub-folders which I cannot delete. </s>
<s> QUESTION: How can I clean up this external hard drive so it acts normally long enough for me to get my data off this drive? </s>
<s> Currently, my system recognizes the drive, but will not let me open it to see the folders or files. </s>
<s> It also seems like my read/write permissions are still screwy... </s>
<s> Thanks, for anything... btw, I'm running Windows XP Pro on a MacBook, using Parallels. </s>
<s> When I mount the external hard drive on the Mac OSX v10.5.6, it opens, I see the folders, but many of the files are not accessible. </s>
<s> It also looks like some of the data within some folders has been deleted This is driving me crazy, hopefully someone can help? </s>

<s> For Windows there is no fix it tool to go back to before the DAMAGE. </s>
<s> At best we hope we save the owners files, reload the OS then restore their files. </s>
<s> Someday we hope for better. </s>
<s> It seems odd you would attempt to delete the System Volume Information folder. </s>
<s> It's part of this OS. </s>
