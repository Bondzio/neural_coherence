The price of the iMac 20&quot; is in my range, but I would rather have a tower configuration to make adding RAM or switching out drives easier. The current G5 tower is beyond my needs and price range,(and from what I understand, being discontinued as Apple moves to Intel chips). Any chance Apple is considering a mid price, mid power, tower?

The next line of Power Macs will be Intel driven and will almost certainly be the same price as the G5 versions. You would be surprised how easy it is to add RAM and change out HD's on an iMac. The current G5 is only $300 more than a 20&quot; iMac. P

That doesn't include a monitor, so add another $400+ or so. A cranky woman at Apple said I could add RAM or change HDs on the iMac myself (but not add a second HD if I wanted extra storege later or a RAID config.), but that it was a pain in the you-know-where to do. I'm not expecting Apple to be Dell, but I'm wondering if an iMac is not going to be flexible enough down the road and $3000 is a bit out of my budget for the Power Mac.

Your savings on spyware, pest control, firewalls, antivirus and ongoing battles with virus, spyware, etc. may be where those other savings come from to make the Apple more affordable. I won't mention anything about PCs, Windows and the great driver hunts. Bob
14651	4	182706	1996386	1996105	Rob10	6/11/06 12:16 PM	1.15002816E12	Yes	I know about all the junk that comes along with a Windows-based computer, though as Apple becomes more popular, that stuff will be written for the Mac OS too to some extent. Right now the only thing I pay for is anti-virus ($30/year for NOD32). I use Spyware Defender and AdAware for spyware, ZoneAlarm personal for a firewall, all free. The main reason for my wanting to switch is I have never cared for the Windows multi-step, counter-intuitive way of doing things. Sometimes I just give up trying to do something. I don't know how much easier things will be to do on a Mac until I have the opportunity to try one.

However, changing out a HD or adding memory is reasonably easy and if you are adept at prodding around inside any computer box, you should have no problem. The raid would not be internal but a Firewire raid is no problem. Sorry to hear that you got the cranky woman at Apple. At least you got the one who had an idea what RAM was I've just read an article about the Intel processors in the iMac and Mini. They are in a socket and the newer versions of the Intel chip (mermon?) fit into the existing socket. An unexpected upgrade path. You are stuck with the existing Video card in the iMac, it is surface soldered in. Your choice of PM is Top of the Line so a cheap machine is not what it is. Do NOT be tempted to get a discontinued PM G5 when the Intel G5's are announced. You will be sorry. P

I am toying with the idea of TV ala a Tivo type setup (I assume that precludes the iMac) or a music server for home intertainment. I am currently using a Dell that I will then move to my business. I assume I can still work with photo and Word or Quicken files from one machine to the other?
14651	8	182706	1996594	1996432	Rob10	6/11/06 2:32 PM	1.15003632E12	PM	Yes, I did hear about the impending change over for the PM, as well as the issues with non-native software running slow on Intel Macs until the third party software companies finish their upgrades. I don't plan on a purchase right now, just setting the groundwork. The PM I was looking at was not the top, the slower processor actually. Just an upgrade of RAM and HD size, and a wireless setup. Don't forget, I still would need a monitor with the PM.
14651	9	182706	1996601	1996591	mrmacfixit	6/11/06 2:52 PM	1.15003752E12	Aaah, the usual stuff	A 20&quot; Intel iMac would suit you down to the ground. Nothing you have mentioned here demands a PM G5/Intel. The &quot;ala a Tivo type setup&quot; does not preclude the iMac. You may be underestimating the capabilities of the iMac. It is a fully functional, powerful machine with all the normal full sized parts inside. The iLife suite will allow you to deal comfortably with all your photographs, iPhoto, all your music, iTunes, all your Digital movies (HD or otherwise), iMovie and all your DVD creating needs, iDVD. All these programs work together which allows you to easily use any music, pictures or film in any of your projects. (such does not exist in the Windows world). MS Office for Mac, if you must, is available with no cross platform concerns. Open Office (free but kinda flaky), AbiWord (free) all work well with MS Word. Guess what we call the equivalent of Quicken? Yep, you guessed it, we call it Quicken and the files cross over. Based on your stated use of a new Mac, you have not convinced me that you actually need a PM G5/Intel. For $2374 you get yourself a fully tricked out Intel iMac with 2Gb RAM, 500Gb HD, Bluetooth and wireless, OS X, iLife a beautiful 20&quot; LCD and NO viruses. Just a thought P

I guess that's what I meant, adding a TV tuner card that allows watching and recording TV (and eventually HDTV). It's not a primary concern, but something I would consider adding if I decide to build a PC. Is it true that the fastest speed you can burn a CD is 24X and no dual layer DVD burning?
14651	11	182706	1996822	1996773	mrmacfixit	6/11/06 5:27 PM	1.15004682E12	Your objections are melting away.	Check out http://www.elgato.com/ for the tv tuner for OS X. I'm guesing that you have not been to the Apple store, on line, and actually looked at the specs for the iMac. Yes, the CD burning speed is 24X but remember that this is a drive that does everything: &quot;8x SuperDrive (DVD+R DL/DVDRW/CD-RW) installed; writes DVD+R DL discs at up to 2.4x speed, writes DVD-R and DVD+R discs at up to 8x speed, writes DVD-RW and DVD+RW discs at up to 4x speed, reads DVDs at up to 8x speed, writes CD-R discs at up to 24x speed, writes CD-RW discs at up to 8x speed, reads CDs at up to 24x speed&quot; Oh no, the Dual Layer DVD myth has been busted. Next! Oh yes, if you feel the need to go much, much faster, you can always attach a firewire device, really easily. P

I know, the Superdrive handles everything, but so does my Plextor, which can burn CDs at 48X. I know, nit pick! I guess the main apprehension I have is the whole compatibility issue between my PC, which I would take to work, and the iMac. You said I wouldn't have any problems moving Word or Quicken documents, and photos, in an editible form back and forth between machines, without any kind of conversion?
14651	13	182706	2002911	2002718	mrmacfixit	6/14/06 8:35 AM	1.1502741E12	Yes, without any form of conversion	Office for Mac files are the same as Office for PC files. A picture will open on any machine provided you have a program that will open that file type. IrfanView will do. Check with Quicken but I have moved PC quicken files to the Mac and used them. P
14651	14	182706	2007451	1996773	bigduke	6/16/06 7:30 AM	1.150443E12	TV in macs	I have a 7500 that is over a decade old with 3 display boards one of which is a TV tuner. They were closeouts many years ago from Other World. The drivers are for system 9 and earlier, and I have not tried to run them in Tiger. Three monitors side by side, one over other and any other stacking you wish to come up with. Now if our miniMac had all that i/o it would be hog heaven. The old set is still functional, but with three TIVO's in the house it is much less used now. And with only 1 G hard drives it can't store many minutes of video. On multi-screens, it makes Photoshop really 300% better with two full screens separating the controls on second port. No, I haven't tried three with PS. Alternative is one of the really huge ($$$) displays. duke

He could do what I'd do and that is buy the basic 20&quot; iMac for $1699, and then spend $450 at someplace else (newegg.com) and wind up with More hard drive and More memory for $225 less. You can get a 400GB SATA drive and a USB2 SATA drive enclosure for $210, which would allow using whichever drive he chose to put in the enclosure to be used by Both computers if he formatted it in FAT32. You can also get excellent memory for at least $100 less than Apple would charge, with the benenfit of having the 512 stick leftover. He sounds like he knows enough about computers in general to do this stuff without much trouble. What I've found is that even though Macs can be intimidating on the outside, they're pretty much the same once you crack the case. I'm a longtime PC guy (my job) who's been exploring the Mac world for a while now. I have a B&W G3 (now G4) as well as a DualCore Mini that I maxed out the RAM on. Fun Stuff.

All of the same software that comes with an iMac also comes with a Mac Mini. You can get a Mac Mini with a Superdrive as well. I currently use my Mini for audio editing, creating movies with iMovie, graphics work with Adobe Photoshop Elements, Flash animations, and of course word processing, browsing the web, email and the other common things we all use our computers for. I've got the old Mini with 1GB RAM, and an external 320 Gig firewire drive, as well as an external Lacie DVD burner with Lightscribe. The little Mini just chugs right along. It never crashes and never gets a virus. I've even heard of people installing and using Apple's pro software, Final Cut Pro on these little Minis. Now, granted, you can't upgrade the internal hard drive to 500 GB (unless you can find a 500 GB laptop drive?). But all of this just goes to show you how much you can actually get done on the less expensive Macs. But just imagine what you could do if you bought 2 of these Mac Minis, put them together, and hooked them both up to one screen using a switch. You could have 4 GB of memory, up to 240 GB of drive space, and a major multi-tasking capability. For example, encode your DVD on one Mini, and then switch to the other to browse the web or check your email. Or in your case run Mac OS X on one, and Windows on the other. The possibilities here are endless. And it would all take up less than 7 inches of desk space. Hope this information helps. Have fun with your new Mac! ~Cliff Mac user since the 1984 Apple Lisa II.

Awesome machine and once you see and open it you know why it is that bit more expensive.Checking out the Apple refurbished site is a good option to save a lot of money. and Buying a rather basic (still powerfull though) tower leaves you the update options for later using non-apple memory (Crucial has a great support site) etc. Overall I have no regrets buying this machine.

I work professionally for a newspaper group and use a Mac Mini since Jan. 2005. The Mac Mini out-performs any G-4 in our department also. Memory is 40 Gigs and our hard drive is set at 1Gig. I am sure that more is available working with Apple. We run OSX10.4.4 currently. OS10.4.7 is available on an update. This little bugger is just awesome. One of my co-workers uses a dual Mac Mini at his home since the intro and loves it being so fast. $699 for a dual Mac Mini is inexpensive. The Mac Mini will be here for a long time. It is amazing how many older Mac users do not want to even try out a Dual Processor Mac Mini and only want a tower iMac. You and I could link about a dozen of these little buggers in the framework of a tower. Just Awesome!!! Something to think about. Cliff, Thanks for your info. -Kevin

Why are you not running 10.4.7 on your Mini? P
