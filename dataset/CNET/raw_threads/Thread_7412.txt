9585	0	330696	2981330	NR	sunsites	2/16/09 2:15 PM	1.2347937E12	Type of Wi-fi adapter	My daughter is moving into an apartment complex that is supplying wi-fi for the whole complex. She has a 3-4 year old Dell desktop and has been using cable for her internet. What is the best way for her to connect to the wi-fi, USB adapter or a pci card also, would it pay her to purchase 802.11n draft or 802.11g.

They're easy to install and configure and they stay firmly parked in the laptop. 802.11g should be fine. There won't be an advantage with the n draft...especially if it's not implemented in the apartment complex.

That said, get a PCI wireless NIC for the desktop, stay away from USB units. He is correct in that unless the complex provides -N, just stick with -G. Unless you can find a -N unit on sale as they are backward compatible.
