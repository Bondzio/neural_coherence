<s> I have the above model of Linksys router and I am finding that I lose the wireless signal from the router several times a day. </s>
<s> My laptop states it is receiving an excellent signal, but the internet just goes down on me. </s>
<s> I have tried repairing the connection and it doesn't work. </s>
<s> I have to run upstairs, sometimes as many as 2-3 times a day, pull the power cord on the router, immediately plug it back in and by the time I get downstairs, I am connected to the internet again. </s>
<s> I contacted Linksys who gave me a series of instructions for fixing the problem (reset) and it didn't work. </s>
<s> Anyone else having this problem out there that was able to fix it? </s>
<s> Just so happens I have the page to start at handy. </s>

<s> What am I supposed to download from the Linksys site? </s>
<s> The driver option is grayed out. </s>
<s> Most routers don't need drivers. </s>
<s> Since you didn't supply what version router you had, I can't be specific. </s>
<s> Maybe you should call it in? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I e-mailed Linksys months ago and they gave me step-by-step instructions (since I am a computer novice) on how to reset the router, and I did and it did not solve the problem. </s>
<s> When I look on other postings here on C-Net, it seems other folks are having problems with the same Linksys Model number. </s>
<s> Dear Moderator: I don't know a lot about computers but I have found that when I go on to this website, more often than not, I can find fixes for my computer problems here. </s>
<s> I'm sorry if I misunderstood what you wanted me to download but when I went back and reviewed it, I noted that you said &quot;firmware&quot;. </s>
<s> I went back to the link you provided and choose firmware and I am getting a box that is cautioning me about downloading the firmware. </s>
<s> Should I just go ahead and do it? </s>
<s> Without exact details I can't do much but note where to start. </s>
<s> The next most common drop reason is some combination of OS and a firewall. </s>
<s> Again, the details are lacking in your posts. </s>
<s> Also, the OS of the machine that drops. </s>
<s> Sometimes we can use EWIDO from download.com to wipe out most pests, but details... Bob </s>
<s> Download the firmware. </s>
<s> Download the BEFW11S4 User Guide from here . </s>
<s> Look at ''Appendix C: Upgrading Firmware'' of the User Guide. </s>
<s> I have the same router as you. </s>
<s> I recently updated the firmware to version 1.52.02. </s>
<s> You have to open the linksys configuration tool to do this. </s>
<s> Save the file to your desktop and use the tool button that says update firmware to browse to your file on your desktop. </s>
<s> You can't just click on the file to update. </s>
<s> Your enter the linksys tool just like you did when you set up your router. </s>
<s> http://192.168.1.1/ enter admin in password (default) That said your problem may not be in the router. </s>
<s> It may be your ethernet connection. </s>
<s> Set it to full duplex if you have it set to auto detect. </s>
<s> I would try the ethernet connection first. </s>
<s> The only difference I can tell in the firmware update on the router is it adds a gaming settings. </s>
<s> I have had my router for a couple years now and no problems. </s>
<s> I think it is a pretty good router. </s>
<s> I'm sorry, I don't know a lot about computers so I don't know what you mean when you say &quot;open the Linksys configuration tool&quot;. </s>
<s> If I can get there, I think I can follow your instructions from there. </s>
<s> Also, my desktop never has a problem disconnecting from the internet, it is just my wireless laptop that does this. </s>
<s> If you can instruct me on how to set whatever you want me to set to full duplex, I will try that as well. </s>
<s> Any help you could give me would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> I have Windows XP Home Edition on all three of my computers. </s>
<s> I have Norton Anti-Virus and my firewall is Norton Internet Worm Protection. </s>
<s> I've found EWIDO from download.com to find other pests that your list of tools didn't find. </s>
<s> But maybe it's time to call the router's maker for a fix or exchange? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> In your first post you stated that you kept losing the internet connection at the router. </s>
<s> Anyway if you want to change the ethernet to full duplex(it may already be set that way). </s>
<s> Your ethernet controller may be different than mine but many are intel. </s>
<s> I get to the ethernet control panel by going to: Start Programs intel Network Adapter Inel Pro set This will open up the ethernet configuration. </s>
<s> Click the advanced tab In the setting box look for Link speed and duplex Set the value to Full Duplex Click Apply Click ok </s>
<s> Rist off, thank you so much for your expertise and patience with me. </s>
<s> I tried downloading the firmware and I am running into a problem that I hope you can talk me through. </s>
<s> This is what I have done. </s>
<s> I went into the Linksys Downloads website and entered the type of router I have and began the firmware download. </s>
<s> I get a box that asks if I want to save this file, which I do (I save it to desktop). </s>
<s> When I do that I get a box that shows it is downloading, then a box that says download complete. </s>
<s> With the download complete box I get three options, Open, Open Folder, Close. </s>
<s> When I chose Open Folder, absolutely nothing happens, not even a window opens. </s>
<s> When I chose Open, I get a box that says I am attempting to open a BIN file that could damage my computer or my operating system. </s>
<s> When I ask to open it anyway I get a box that says Windows cannot open this file. </s>
<s> To open this file Windows needs to know what program created it. </s>
<s> What do you want to do? </s>
<s> and it give me two options and they are 1) Use the Web service to find the appropriate program OR select the program from a list. </s>
<s> When I click select the program from a list a box comes up that states &quot;Choose the program you want to use to open this file&quot; and it has Recommended Programs with Internet Explorer highlighted. </s>
<s> Under that are other programs such as Microsoft Word, Notepad, Wordpad, etc. </s>
<s> and then under that there is Browse button. </s>
<s> When I hit the Browse button it goes to Program Files with a bunch of folder in it and none of them are Linksys. </s>
<s> When I change it to go to desktop, the downloaded firmware is not there until I change the option to search all the files and then it is an option. </s>
<s> When I click on the download, a box comes up that states it cannot be opened. </s>
<s> That is where I get stuck. </s>
<s> Am I doing this completely wrong? </s>
<s> Typed in 192.168.1.1 in address bar and went into Linksys configuration from there. </s>
<s> Went into the Administration page and firmware updates and found the file on the desktop and downloaded it. </s>
<s> Thank you very much everyone for your help and lets see if it works. </s>
<s> The file that you saved to your desktop needs to be opened with your linksys configruration tool. </s>
<s> From the host computer(the one that the router is attached)open the linksys tool. </s>
<s> Enter this into your web browser address bar. </s>
<s> http://192.168.1.1/ Hit enter This will open a screen that asks for your password in the second box enter admin(your default password) Hit enter Your linkysys configuration window should now be open. </s>
<s> You will see several tabs. </s>
<s> Click on Administration. </s>
<s> You will see new tabs under that One will say firmware update. </s>
<s> Click on that tab. </s>
<s> A new window will open. </s>
<s> Now it needs to know where the file is that you downloaded. </s>
<s> Click browse. </s>
<s> Browse to the desktop file that has the update file. </s>
<s> Open it. </s>
<s> You should see a little progress bar that shows the download progress. </s>
<s> Wait for it to complete. </s>
<s> You have now updated your firmware. </s>
<s> This is the only way you can update the firmware for your router. </s>
<s> If you can you may want to print this out. </s>
<s> Good luck BTW, did you check your ethernet controller for Full Duplex option from my earlier post. </s>
<s> All of these options can only be done from the host computer(where the router is hooked up) </s>
<s> Glad to see you got your firmware updated. </s>
<s> Looks like I posted a little too late.. You may want to check the status of your other computers if you have not done so. </s>
<s> Using your linksys tool Click on status Click on local network Click on DHCP Clients Table All the computer names should be listed. </s>
<s> Good luck </s>
