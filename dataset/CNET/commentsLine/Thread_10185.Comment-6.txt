ok; this is in no way to reprimand the author of this article, and i have used newegg for years.
rosewill is obviously a named newegg brand.
i would never buy a side brand oem for products that are vital to the operation of anything.
as a rebrander newegg takes these failures as a hit, but the forum is so controlled that it does not really matter.
i know, i know, most of this is stated in the article, but my point it this a psu is basically the most important part in a computer as nothing at all will run without it.
so it should be treated as such and i would never buy a side brand psu period.
the same can be said for a motherboard and as such it should really be treated the same.
as far as it goes though there is value in rosewill as well but not in major components.
housing (desktop towers etc), fans, lighting and products like dvd drives i would use if branded by rosewill.
why you will ask i am sure!
the reason is relatively simple.
fist they are cheap and second generally there made by a large oem but sold off and rebranded.
i can guarantee you rosewill makes no fans, dvd/blueray, cathode tubing etc etc, they just buy overstock for pennies from the major oems, rebrand them and sell them.
my rule is this if it cost 1/3rd to 1/4 the price of a major oem components but physically look the same i may buy it.
i also generally try to verify very specifically elsewhere for reviews since it is newegg's rebranding company so the reviews on ether (newegg, or rosewill's) website would most definitely be flawed.
then i would buy very specifically by the product number of said rosewill product i was considering a buy of.
once again i would never buy a major (psu, mb) product from a rebrander.
the reason for that is it will be of questionable origin and have no literal holder of said warranty.
