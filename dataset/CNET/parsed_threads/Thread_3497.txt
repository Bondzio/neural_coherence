<s> Just wondering if there are any external hard drives that will automatically update files on your hard drive? </s>
<s> I own a business and would like to auto save all my files in a designated area at the end of each work day. </s>
<s> For example... set it to save all my files in my C:/My Documents/TJdavisInc/ drive at 6pm every night. </s>
<s> Is this possible? </s>

<s> This drives are all hardware and would need SOFTWARE to do this. </s>

<s> Is there any software already developed for this? </s>
<s> Read http://learn.quinnipiac.edu/at/atdocs/tut/syncback/syncback.html for an example. </s>

<s> First write a batchfile with the right xcopy-command(s). </s>
<s> Something like: xcopy &quot;c:\documents and settings\&lt;myusername&gt;\my documents&quot; e:\backup /m /s /y This copies all files in your My documents folder to the e:\backup folder including all files in subfolders (/s). </s>
<s> It only copies new and changed files (that have the archive bit set) and resets the archive so the file is copied only once (/m). </s>
<s> And it doesn't ask questions (/y). </s>
<s> First time run it without /m to copy everything to have a base for the &quot;incremental backup&quot;. </s>
<s> Then use the task scheduler in your OS to run a batchfile at a certain time each day. </s>
<s> This is the Windows XP version: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308569 Or activate the job via a shortcut on the desktop if you want to do it at other times. </s>
<s> All of this comes with Windows, and is totally free. </s>
<s> It might take 15 minutes to set it up, and that's your whole investment. </s>
<s> You can use My Computer or Windows Explorer to get files back, if needed on any Windows PC: the files aren't encrypted or packed into archives. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>

<s> A lot of units come with software that you can set up to do what you're asking (assuming you're XP/Vista) Some of the applications are limited to backing up either only My Documents or the whole disk, whereas others will let you do specific folders. </s>
<s> You can schedule it, or set it to go manually. </s>
<s> Personally I can't stand when a backup comes on while I'm tryin to finish my work. </s>
<s> One example (not a plug, just a product I'm familiar with) is Seagate's One Touch. </s>
<s> You buy the drive and it comes with the program. </s>
