In particular, if a fax comes in, I would like the option of it &quot;printing to file.&quot; Also, if I have a fax to send, I would like to be able to &quot;print to fax&quot; and also &quot;dial fax&quot; from my laptop. In short, I would like to be able to do everything but change paper and ink REMOTELY with FULL multifunction functionality...from my laptop. Is anybody aware of a multifunction printer and/or software that offers this kind of total control? Thanks a lot, Mikey

That's in addition to its Ethernet connector, which means you can attach it to either a wired or wireless network to print, scan, or access memory cards across a network&quot;
