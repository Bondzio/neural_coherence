757	0	143277	1605697	NR	Cluchetti	12/15/05 1:31 PM	1.13465346E12	Can I reuse a Hard Drive.....	with windows on it and reformat it for a new computer I am building. The hard Drive is a 40GB Maxtor IDE - 133 Hard Drive. The only problem is that the computer it is in says there is a problem with the ide channel 1; which has the hdd on it. Can I still use the hard drive in a new computer?
