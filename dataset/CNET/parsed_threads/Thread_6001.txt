<s> I have been having intermittent problems with my computer - stop errors for several different things, I uninstalled new programs that I thought might be causing the troubles, and often that solved the problem. </s>
<s> Not sure if these are all related. </s>
<s> I installed a demo version of stuffit to open a file someone sent me, and it created some conflicts - so I took it off. </s>
<s> Then webroot began having some problems with definition updates. </s>
<s> Then began doing sweeps when I didn't ask it to, and didn't log that I had already done one two days ago. </s>
<s> Yesterday, my computer crashed and I got messages of address line failure and that the system memory had changed. </s>
<s> Then I got cryptic message that a valid definitions file could not be located. </s>
<s> I looked at the event viewer and discovered that Webroot perhaps was the culprit, so I removed it. </s>
<s> The system memory error messages stopped, and it appeared that things went back to normal. </s>
<s> I did scans with avast and alwil they have found no viruses or problems with the system memory. </s>
<s> My computer crashed again while I was working on photoshop (the only program running other than avast and zone alarm) this morning, and in the event viewer saw that there was an ftdisk error. </s>
<s> Microsoft claims that they don't have any information about it and googling the error brings up too many different fixes that involve a lot of work - I'd like to see if I can narrow it down a bit. </s>
<s> There are suggestion from memory stick to power supply failure, to boot-sector viruses. </s>
<s> The power supply and mother board battery were replaced within the last year. </s>
<s> I am working with XP on a Dell Dimension 8200. </s>
<s> I realize that it's an older model, and will be buying a new computer next year - I just can't do it right now. </s>
<s> And yes, I've backed up. </s>
<s> Many thanks, Adrienne </s>
<s> Yesterday (didn't see this) The system failed to flush data to the transaction log. </s>
<s> Corruption may occur. </s>
<s> Today x2 Configuring the Page file for crash dump failed. </s>
<s> Make sure there is a page file on the boot partition and that is large enough to contain all physical memory. </s>
<s> The causes are many from heat, bad ram, bad motherboard, failing hard disk and of course various infections. </s>
<s> You didn't tell how long it's been since you cleaned the inside of this PC so let's take a shot at the heat issue. </s>
<s> Does leaving the cover off help? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Was cleaned about 4 months ago. </s>
<s> Will try taking the cover off while I'm working today. </s>
<s> When I googled the entire error message, Microsoft spit out a page saying to increase the virtual memory (mine was at 2000MB, and I increased it to the maximum 4000 something), and to to turn off the memory dump file. </s>
<s> While increasing virtual memory doesn't seem like it would be a bad thing, I'm not sure why I have a memory dump file. </s>
<s> Is there anything hurt by either? </s>
<s> I guess I don't really understand about dump files and page files, in other words. </s>
<s> Sadly a failing hard disk. </s>
<s> Or something that is causing disk reads or writes to fail (heat does that as well as power supplies, etc.) </s>
<s> The current wisdom with XP and beyond is to &quot;let Windows manage it.&quot; Read more about this at http://www.aumha.org/win5/a/xpvm.php Bob </s>
<s> I opened my box as you suggested, and then decided that increasing the virtual memory at the same time would not tell me whether it's a heat problem. </s>
<s> But not before I opened photoshop and did some work (I forgot I'd changed it). </s>
<s> When I put the memory down to what it's been at, photoshop hung. </s>
<s> No crashes, but I could barely get out of PS. </s>
<s> So then the question is, for a memory-intensive program like photoshop (or running several different things like computer protection, skype, firefox, etc., is 2000 MB too little? </s>
<s> Could that be the problem? </s>
<s> Would that maybe point to a problem with one of the memory sticks? </s>
<s> As a note, I replaced my hard drive about a year ago after it died. </s>
<s> If another drive goes, I wonder if there's something going on with the mother board that could corrupt a drive? </s>
<s> As I mentioned, the power supply was also replaced. </s>
<s> This was a good computer for about 4 years. </s>
<s> But maybe I won't go with Dell next time around. </s>
<s> Golems in the gears. </s>
<s> For XP, Vista we let it manage it. </s>
<s> Even with your noted application. </s>
<s> As to the Dell comment, ALL makers were hit with the issue noted at http://news.cbsi.com/PCs+plagued+by+bad+capacitors/2100-1041_3-5942647.html so to pan Dell for a machine past 4 years old... </s>
<s> There are other issues such as fans that slow with time, etc. </s>
<s> But no maker would be immune here. </s>
<s> Sorry but so far the clues only point to possible heat issues. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> No crashes yesterday! </s>
<s> Yay! </s>
<s> My fresh start this morning produced no errors. </s>
<s> However, after about an hour Microsoft gave me updates, and I restarted. </s>
<s> Got the following errors: Configuring the Page file for crash dump failed. </s>
<s> Make sure there is a page file on the boot partition and that is large enough to contain all physical memory. </s>
<s> The Eplpdx02 service could not be started. </s>
<s> DCOM got error &quot;The service database is locked. </s>
<s> &quot; attempting to start the service netman with arguments &quot;&quot; in order to run the server: {BA126AE5-2166-11D1-B1D0-00805FC1270E} DCOM got error &quot;The service database is locked. </s>
<s> &quot; attempting to start the service iPod Service with arguments &quot;&quot; in order to run the server: {063D34A4-BF84-4B8D-B699-E8CA06504DDE} And actually two of the last three are driver errors that I get intermittently (dont' know what netman is). </s>
<s> Although I've followed directions to try to get rid of them, I've had no luck. </s>
<s> I have the computer open and still getting the ftdisk error this morning - but it could be heat related. </s>
<s> Thankfully, no crashes since I opened the box, even though I've deliberately not held myself back from opening programs as I need them. </s>
<s> If there is one silver lining, increasing the virtual memory has erased the problem I had with photoshop and page maker being finicky to use at the same time. </s>
<s> Any ideas about the error messages being related or not? </s>
<s> Many thanks. </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?q=Eplpdx02 If you can live without iTunes I'd uninstall that till the machine issues fade. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Well, maybe someday they will fade. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help - I guess I'm on the road to some sort of answer now. </s>
<s> Perhaps ultimately to ditch this computer and get a new one that doesn't hiccup every time I look at a new program. </s>
<s> (Though I imagine that's a perennial problem with all computers.) </s>
<s> Thanks again for your help. </s>
<s> At least I got the newsletter out without my computer dying - and that's a good thing! </s>
<s> Adrienne </s>
<s> Last night I see there were two warning messages: The system failed to flush data to the transaction log. </s>
<s> Corruption may occur. </s>
<s> The time service has not been able to synchronize the system time for 49152 seconds because none of the time providers has been able to provide a usable time stamp. </s>
<s> The system clock is unsynchronized. </s>
<s> This morning I got black screened, and upon manual shut down and restart I got the following message: Memory read/write failure at OA824364, read 8260882D expecting 826D826D. </s>
<s> Decreasing available memory. </s>
<s> Memory address line failure at )A380000, read 00000000 expecting 7C7C7C7C. </s>
<s> Decreasing available memory. </s>
<s> The amount of system memory has changed. </s>
<s> When I asked it to start normally, it behaved like a computer with limited memory - working very slowly. </s>
<s> I restarted and got the same message as last time: Amount of system memory has changed. </s>
<s> I started normally. </s>
<s> Although the computer appears to be working at normal speed again, my task bar is white and the text is another font. </s>
<s> The temperature is about 75 degrees. </s>
<s> I don't know if the temperature yesterday would have anything to do with it, but it was working fine when I went to bed. </s>
<s> My gut is giving me a bad feeling about this - that it may indeed be the memory sticks. </s>
<s> Hope you're still tracking this discussion and would be grateful for any input. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> That memory failure could be the real reason for all your troubles. </s>
<s> If you added memory then remove those sticks. </s>
<s> The &quot;time service&quot; entry can be ignored. </s>
<s> I'll decline a long explanation. </s>
<s> Back to memory. </s>
<s> Try this test -&gt; http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=MEMTEST86&btnG=Google+Search bOB </s>
<s> Memtest 86 can be had for about $11 and you have to wait for it in the mail. </s>
<s> Memtest86+ is free and down-loadable. </s>
<s> Do they do essentially the same thing? </s>
<s> They don't know how to create the boot CD or diskette. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You just install it to the CD or DVD. </s>
<s> Or is there something I don't know? </s>
<s> Remember that there are all skill levels out there. </s>
<s> There are those that can't use downloads at all since it may require one to unzip, install or make a diskette or CD. </s>
<s> This is why you see such for sale. </s>
<s> Hope that clears that question up. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> What a great program! </s>
<s> It was bad memory. </s>
<s> I couldn't find a page that explains what all the data was (if you know of a link, I'd be interested in reading it), but it was clear enough that something was awry with 3-7000 errors per sweep and at least 20 notations of bad ram. </s>
<s> Instead of trying to figure out which stick was bad though, I decided to replace. </s>
<s> Given that I will not be able to buy a new computer in the next year or at worst maybe two or three, I decided after seeing the RDram prices that buying without upgrading would not be so smart. </s>
<s> 2.2 GHz is still a pretty decent speed for an old model, and I found a semi-okay price for a 2G set. </s>
<s> Throwing $500 into an old computer might seem excessive, but I can't tell you how pleased I am - I'm working on an image-packed publication right now, and this computer sings! </s>
<s> I don't have to reinstall or transfer anything, I can sit back while the rest of the world works out the Vista bugs, and I'm not adding to the mountain of discarded hardware (yet). </s>
<s> God willin' (if something else doesn't go wrong), someday we can make this sweetie into a server or have an extra computer for someone else to use. </s>
<s> Thanks for all your help. </s>
<s> Adrienne </s>
