<s> I have a custom built machine, which I put together in September. </s>
<s> I have been using the soundcard built into my motherboard, in device manager called &quot;Realtek High Definition Audio.&quot; The other day I had a microphone plugged in and it was turned on. </s>
<s> I turned the switch on the microphone to the off position, and as soon as I did, all hell broke loose. </s>
<s> I got about five dialogue boxes pop up with errors saying something about being unable to reset or detect the Wave Controller or something like that. </s>
<s> It was a few days ago, I don't remember the exact error. </s>
<s> Ever since then, my computer does not detect when I plug in speakers or a microphone and I get absolutely no sound. </s>
<s> I have tried everything. </s>
<s> I've tried updating the soundcard driver, I've tried doing a system restore to two days before this incident, and there is no change. </s>
<s> I'm wondering if it's possible that I somehow shorted out the circuits in the sound card. </s>
<s> Is there anything else I can try to restore my sound? </s>
<s> If you had a DVM you could do a continuity test across the mic plug with the switch in both positions. </s>
<s> A dead short during an attempted higher current output from the sound card's final amp stages just might damage it but I'm surprised they're not better protected. </s>
<s> As well, if you used a mono mic in a stereo jack that could have some strange effects. </s>
<s> You might be better off to disable that sound device in your BIOS and get an half way decent card. </s>
<s> I did use a mono mic in a stereo jack, so yeah, maybe that's what happened. </s>
<s> I ordered a cheap soundcard so, when it gets here I'll be able to install it and see if that fixes it. </s>
<s> Thanks for the input! </s>
