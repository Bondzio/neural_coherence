<s> Good day I am trying to connect a computer to my network and this is the problem. </s>
<s> The lan cable I have is too short to reach the dsl router that I have and was wondering if I could do one of two things and if I can how to do it. </s>
<s> Maybe I can do neither but here is my thought. </s>
<s> First way: I have a d-link model DI-524 so could I plug in the cable from my dsl modem to the d-link wan plug and then run a cable to the computer, or Second way: I have 2 built in lan ports on my Asus P6T-Deluxe so could I run a lan cable from the second lan port to the other computer. </s>
<s> I have long enough cable to do either one of these, just don't know if it will work. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> I really don't want to string another cable through if I don' have to. </s>
<s> Thanks Sean Hope this is clear and enough info. </s>
<s> it would still seem to me that getting a longer cable is the best way to go. </s>
<s> If bridging between the ports on another computer is possible, so is getting the right length of cable. </s>
<s> They aren't that expensive. </s>
<s> While it's probably possible to bridge two Ethernet ports on one PC...and I've not done that...there is going to be a downside. </s>
<s> Is a longer cable not an option? </s>
<s> The computer that has the 2 lan ports is halfway between the dsl modem and the second computer and I have a cable long enough to reach the second computer. </s>
<s> The computers are on the same floor so easy to run a cable. </s>
<s> The dsl modem is on a different floor and at the othe end of the house, running a cable would not be easy so I thought maybe with equipment I have I could cheat and make it easy. </s>
<s> Oh well, just a thought. </s>
<s> Thanks very much Sean </s>
<s> In this forum in the top 2 posts you find POST 17 that gives you an overview of how to use your d-link model DI-524. </s>
<s> I don't know the specs of that model but it should have at least 4 ports. </s>
<s> A router also offers another measure of security. </s>
<s> Even if I had only one PC, it would connect to the modem through a router. </s>
<s> modem &gt; router &gt; computer. </s>
<s> you can connect as many computer as you want to the open ports. </s>
<s> if you run out of ports, you can connect a switch to the router and connect some more computers </s>
