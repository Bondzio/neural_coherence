<s> How much do you think my computer is worth? </s>
<s> Well I mean I know how much I paid for it back in December 25, 2004 but I'm just curious if it has lost much value as of yet. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance Compaq Presario Desktop Windows XP Home Edition 3000+ AMD Sempron processor 512 MB PC2700 DDR SDRAM Memory 120GB 7200RPM Ultra DMA Hard drive CD-RW/DVD-ROM combo drive 48x32x16x48x max speed Processor speed 2.00Ghz 512MB L2 cache 333Mhz Front Side Bus Built in front access 9-in-1 memory card reader, USB 2.0 and FireWire Ports 17inch Flat Pannel CRT Moniter JBL Platinum Series Speakers Standard Keyboard and Mouse ( http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/product?dlc=en&lc=en&product=438014&lang=en&cc=us& ) Just a curiousty question of course. </s>
<s> And while I'm here I was just curious when should I UPGRADE my computer to add more memory (expandable to 2GB (looked at it from specs from website) ) Not worried about Harddrive cause I use this for my Ipod Mini and just regular Aol Instant Messenging and Internet, Microsoft Office and such. </s>
<s> Also, when it does come time, is it easier to buy a new computer or upgrade the CPU? </s>
<s> (For instance for 64BIT) As in time and cost wise. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance again. </s>
<s> $300 max, and that's if you sell it to a friend... Roger </s>
<s> not, i say its more than dat. </s>
<s> about $500. </s>
<s> No way it can be $300 with the monitor, speakers, keyboard, mouse. </s>
<s> and with 512mb ram and a pretty decent processor. </s>
<s> dont worry. </s>
<s> With a better video card and more ram (1gb) is enough it will be a good machine. </s>
<s> I wouldnt worry about 64-bit as there arent many out there so far and in the future 64-bit will probably be more used by designers, gamers, business ppl, etc. </s>
<s> I'd say about $350, on average. </s>
<s> This week HP has some complete packages with similar specs for around $500 after rebates, but they've gone as low as $350 in the past month or two. </s>
<s> It may be worth closer to the $500 mark, but resale value is always lower because the system is used. </s>
<s> Personally, I'd rather pay a little more and get a new rather than one with a &quot;questionably background.&quot; Thus, you'd probably have to lower your price enough to convince someone to &quot;take the risk,&quot; even if your's doesn't have a flaw. </s>
<s> As far as upgrading your RAM, it's pretty much up to you. </s>
<s> If you use a lot of intensive programs (such as video editing and high-end gaming), or like to multitask a lot, you should upgrade as soon as you can. </s>
<s> Otherwise, I'd hold off until Longhorn (next version of Windows) is released late 2006. </s>
<s> The system requirements increase with each version: Windows XP requires 256MB, and recommends 512MB. </s>
<s> Longhorn will require 512MB and recommend 1GB unless you decide to run it in &quot;reduced graphics mode.&quot; By then, however, you'll probably have considered buying a new computer anyways. </s>
<s> Finally, you'd probably be better off just buying a new computer to get 64-bit processing rather than upgrade. </s>
<s> It would be quite a hassle, assuming your motherboard can support a 64-bit processor (not all can). </s>
<s> In addition, it would be wiser to just buy a new system than upgrading the CPU, followed by your RAM, HD, graphics card, etc just down the road. </s>
<s> It's similar to buying parts for printers... it's almost cheaper to buy a new printer than the ink cartriges. </s>
<s> My 64-bit ramblings: Windows XP x64 was released yesterday, but most drivers and compatible software won't be available until later this year. </s>
<s> Until the software vendors start producting 64-bit software, you won't see much, if any, of a performance boost. </s>
<s> Again, if I were you, I'd wait until Longhorn comes out and but a new computer with it preinstalled. </s>
<s> By then most, if not all, computers will be 64-bit, and its power will be completely supported by software vendors. </s>
<s> Plus, it would prevent you from having to upgrade your OS, and possibly your hardware, to meet the standards at that time. </s>
<s> (However, being the geek I am, I have a 64-bit processor and am eagerly awaiting the OS upgrade CD to arrive in the mail ;)) Hope this helps, John </s>
