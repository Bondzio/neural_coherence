<s> My dell 8300 is a year and a half old but now does not turn on. </s>
<s> Both the power supply and mother board check out ok. Now the problem seems to be between the on/off button to the mother board. </s>
<s> Is there a way to check for this or get around it? </s>
<s> Where would I be able to fine a replacement if needed? </s>
<s> I have check ebay (can replace the whole case) but nothing. </s>
<s> Dell customer service takes to long and will charge a fee just to tell me that I should send it in. </s>
<s> Any help will do thanks. </s>
<s> &quot;Both the power supply and mother board check out ok.&quot; How did you test them??? </s>
<s> The power switch is a momentarty push switch. </s>
<s> The easest way to check this out is to CAREFULLY short out the pins on the MB whet the power button plugs into. </s>
<s> If it powers up then the switch is bad. </s>
<s> then you can have fun getting a replacement from DEll. </s>
<s> Or juryrig a small switch. </s>

<s> The power supply and mother board was checked by an electrican. </s>
<s> I will check the switch myself and you are right about getting anything from dell. </s>
<s> Ebay has a case and power supply for $50 that I am looking into. </s>
<s> Have you heard of just removing the battery for a few minutes so the computer can reset? </s>
<s> Blankster, Have you ever tried Delltalk ? </s>
<s> They can be pretty helpful and you might find someone who has had the same problem and has a fix. </s>
