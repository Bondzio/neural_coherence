<s> I have just purchased a Power Sentry 2200va UPS with a RS-232 cable interface. </s>
<s> I connected it all up but when I turned everything on, XP did not find any new hardware. </s>
<s> I went to &quot;Power Options&quot; then UPS tab and set up the UPS as Generic using COM1 as the connection as per my mother board diagram but I can't seem to get any communication between my PC and the UPS. </s>
<s> When I unplug my UPS from the wall socket and my PC starts running on battery power I can go into the UPS tab again under power options and it still tells me that I'm running off AC. </s>
<s> Does anyone know how to get the UPS to communicate this the PC when using the RS-232 interface? </s>
<s> Is there some special software that is required? </s>
<s> Thanks mtree MS Windows XP Professional V2002 SP 3 AMD64X2 Dual Core </s>
<s> It comes from the UPS maker. </s>
<s> That is the problem. </s>
<s> There is no contact info. </s>
<s> The Manual just says &quot;Contact your sales reprsentative&quot; Another statement it makes is &quot;Some computers may need special UPS monitoring software. </s>
<s> Contact your dealer for details on the various interface kits&quot;. </s>
<s> I bought this new from a discount store and was wondering if anyone here had any knowledge on this model of UPS. </s>
<s> I have see quite a few on sale. </s>
<s> Power Sentry 2200VA with an RS-232 interface. </s>
<s> thanks mtree </s>
<s> I've seen such land in the fire or discount sales places because drivers and software were never developed. </s>
<s> Keep in mind I didn't look for this software. </s>
<s> You could do that on your own with google, etc. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Tried Google. </s>
<s> I have been in this position before and Google has always come through for me. </s>
<s> Not this time however, which I find surprising considering how many places seem to be selling this product. </s>

<s> A company crashes. </s>
<s> This isn't the first time for such. </s>
<s> Maybe it's good enough to just have an UPS? </s>
<s> The fact that it uses RS-232 connection suggest this is an older model and/or discontinued one. </s>
<s> Most newer UPS that have links to the system for s/w control are USB based. </s>
<s> If you google and find such s/w available, it needn't be directly provided for that brand name. </s>
<s> It *MAY* work as a generic type setup, it just needs A UPS to work. </s>
<s> So, if you find a newer s/w it *may* work also using a RS-232 to USB adapter then again, once you get into deviated manufacturer setup, it could falter as well. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Ok I'm getting somewhere now. </s>
<s> It seems that Powercom makes these UPSs. </s>
<s> Could be one of those cases where they produce a bunch of them and then relabeled them for some reason (maybe quality or age). </s>
<s> The whole thing is crazy. </s>
<s> It came in a Philips box, was labeled Power Sentry, but was manufactured by Powercom. </s>

<s> I sent them an email and got the correct version of the software. </s>
<s> Just a version of UPSMON which I already had from one of my old UPSs. </s>
<s> Still did not interface with my main PC as it would not connect using com1,2,3,4. </s>
<s> Had to go in the BIOS and switch the addresses to AUTO for COM1 & 2. </s>
<s> Connects now and everything to work. </s>
