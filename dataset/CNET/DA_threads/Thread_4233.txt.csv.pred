1.1.1	I just had a self-built ASUS/ANTEC tower machine die on me ( I think due to lightning power surge , even tho ' it was attached to an APC UPS ) It was an ASUS P4T533C with 3Ghz INTEL , 2G of RAMBUS PC1066 RAM , an nVidia Quadro4 900XGL ( 128MB DDR - AGP4X ) video card and a WD HD .	St
1.1.2	I sold the RAM , but kept the video card and HDD and use it as my & quot ; d : / & quot ; in what was my secondary CAD workstation , but now my only .	St
1.1.3	It is an ASUS P4C800 with a P4 3.4Ghz INTEL , 2Gb of DDR2 RAM and a WD Raptor SATA HD for the system drive .	St
1.1.4	That mobo replaced an ASUS P4P800E that died while back and ASUS replaced under warranty .	St
1.1.5	My print/BACKUP server is also an ASUS , a P3V4X with a P3 866Mhz , 2Gb of pc133 RAM and two ( WD and Maxtor ) 40Gb HDDs .	St
1.1.6	I would like to wait till the prices of solid state HDs come down to earth , but am also tempted to go with DELLs Precision line since I have not had too much luck with building my own machines .	St
1.1.7	ANY SUGGESTIONS ?	Ques
1.1.8	also looking to replace my HP 11x17 printer , an HP2500C ( which while it works ok , when it works , it is a poor example of HP printer design and can really raise my BP some days ) : & gt ; (	St
1.2.1	Why would anyone want those ?	Ques
1.3.1	I 'll guess you 're looking for cooler drives than those Raptors , other old WDs and Maxtors .	St
1.3.2	Well , new drives of 500 GB or higher run a lot cooler ( and more reliably ) than those old ones , so try them .	St
1.3.3	And make sure you route all internal cables carefully in the case for adequate airflow .	Sug
1.3.4	With those 3+ GHz CPUs , install a system exhaust fan in addition to the CPU and PSU fans .	St
1.3.5	Luck never hurts , but oftentimes building a reliable system requires some skill too .	St
1.4.1	the p4t533c based pc had to be six years old , no ?	Ques
1.4.2	a 3ghz p4 puts out enough heat to warm a small room so if that was you everyday work machine i 'm surprised it lasted this long .	St
1.4.3	your current workstation looks to be 4+ years old so it 's not doing to bad either .	St
1.4.4	you could go with the precision line but you 'll be paying more for the same equipment you could build yourself ( and you obviously know how ) .	Sug

1.4.7	for comparison , a dell precision t3400 525w would be $ 2458 and slower in many areas .	St
1.4.8	http : //configure.us.dell.com/dellstore/config.aspx ? oc=bwcw7zz & c=us & l=en & s=bsd & cs=04 & kc=productdetails~precn_t3400 Dell 's CPU is a Q6700 , 2.66ghz , 1066mhz FSB , 2x4MB cache which is about 10 % slower .	St
1.4.9	Dell 's RAM is 2x4GB DDR2-667 vs DDR3-1600 .	St
1.4.10	Dell 's hard drive is 320gb 7200rpm vs 300gb 10,000rpm .	St
1.4.11	Dell 's power supply is 525w vs 650w .	St
1.5.1	I appreciate your faith in my PC luck , but ... the P4P800 was built in the Spring of 2005 http : //mdwebneck.com/jimc/antec+p4.html http : //mdwebneck.com/jimc/cadwkstn2.xls And yes while my home office on the 2nd floor of my townhome does get a bit warm , ( typically in the low 80s ) , that is not my concern because I have enough fans in this ( Antec SLK3000B ) Mid-Tower case to make it fly if not hover .	St
1.5.2	Likewise , I used rounded cables for both my IDE and power to improve air flow .	St
1.5.3	I have my CPU temp threshold monitor set at 140F and it has only given alarm twice in three years .	St
1.5.4	( current room temp is 82F , CPU is 113f , mobo is 86F ) My first CAD workstation had two Mobo failures and while the first one was covered under warranty this second failure most likely by power surge ( despite being connected to an APC UPS ) could not be repaired/replaced .	St
1.5.5	I 've also had two motherboard failures of the second CAD machine one with the P4P800 and another with the P4C800 , one of those being covered by warranty .	St
1.5.6	So not wanting to look forward to tearing apart my computers at least every couple of years to replace motherboards , I find myself asking for assistance .	St
1.5.7	As to complaints regarding the Solid State HDs , I have not seen any flaming reviews of them , but then again as I am hoping this current workstation will hold out at least another year , it will give the solid state gurus a chance to improve on some of the shortcomings , including the outrageous pricing .	St
1.5.8	my own observations :	St
1.6.1	ditto with a 32-bit OS ... you need x64 to let the hardware reach its potential .	St
1.6.2	and a fx570 is probably the wimpiest quadro available ... why would you pair it with an 8 core setup ?	Ques

St
1.6.4	and you 're at $ 3,173 with twice the ram , a larger and faster hard drive , a 64gb SSD , a faster video card , and 24 & quot ; ( vs. 19 & quot ; ) monitor .	St
1.6.5	as for reliability , if there is indeed some type of problem with your wiring or your enivironment is too warm , a dell will probably die also .	St
1.6.6	you 'll just watch someone else do the hardware swap .	St
1.6.7	also , businesses usually depreciate desktops on a 3 year schedule now .	St
1.6.8	the pc will still 'work ' after 3 years , but it will be far behind the curve and not able to keep up as well as a new machine .	St
1.6.9	if you make your living from a fast pc ( and it seems like you do ) , you need to schedule upgrades at least every 3 to 4 years .	St
1.6.10	i 'm a software/database developer and i upgrade my server and workstation every 2-3 years so i can assure my clients that the software will perform on their servers as well as it does on mine .	St
1.6.11	the faster i get stuff done , the sooner i get paid .	St
1.6.12	i 've got a 3.4ghz p4d server that will be upgraded to a q9450 at the end of the month .	St
1.6.13	rebuilding it is a pain but necessary .	St
1.6.14	if you can wait 6-8 months , Intel 's Nehalem processors will be available .	St
1.6.15	they 're hyper-threaded quad-cores and 25-40 % faster than a core2quad/xeon5000 clock-for-clock but will sell for about the same price .	St
1.7.1	& quot ; and a fx570 is probably the wimpiest quadro available ... why would you pair it with an 8 core setup ?	Ques
1.7.2	& quot ; I did that on purpose , did n't like what they had available , so that would be the one thing that I would shop for and install on my own and just sell the Dell OEM on ebay .	St
1.7.3	As a CADD Engineer , I occasionally do 3D drawings , but the activity that really has my CAD software choking is raster refresh , it is such a VM hog that , if it is bottlenecked somewhere between HD access and the video card 's bandwidth , the application ( at the office ) will crash nearly every time I pan/zoom on a CAD file that has a referenced raster image larger than 3mb .	St
1.7.4	I 'm not sure my application 's manufacturer 's have adapted to x64 yet and I 've heard an awful lot of flak about x64 non-compatibility , elsewhere , as well .	St
1.7.5	I have an old license of autocad 2000 and a current license of Bentley Microstation .	St
1.7.6	( most of my clients still prefer acad and unfortunately , I 've been using it so much more than bentley , I 've gotten a bit rusty at microstation .	St
1.7.7	I still prefer the MODEL space and PAPER space environment and some of the measuring/dimensioning tools in Autocad , but Microstation 's mouse tools are so much faster in every element modification activity .	St
1.7.8	The newest upgrade to Bentley 's softare , Microstation XM may have made the leap to x64 , I 'll have to look into it , but am disgusted with Autocad 's 2-3 year version expiration policy that I refuse to buy another of their licenses .	St
