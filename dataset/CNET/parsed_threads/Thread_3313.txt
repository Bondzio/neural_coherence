<s> I shut down my desktop computer last night and a few hours later went to start it back up. </s>
<s> When I hit the button to turn it back on nothing happened. </s>
<s> I've checked the surge protector, outlet, power cable to the back of the tower, and the connection to the surge protector. </s>
<s> There is a green light on the back of the tower located by where the power cord plugs in and when I push the power button on the front of the computer it lights up but the computer doesn't seem to start booting up. </s>
<s> Also when I shut it down last night it didn't make any odd noises and I didn't smell anything like an ozone smell or a burning smell. </s>
<s> Any ideas and or help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thank you all. </s>
<s> You didn't say anything about computer type, hardware, etc. </s>
<s> But from the description of the issue it sounds like a PSU failure, that would be my first guess. </s>
<s> You can purchase a tester or take it to a shop, it is an easy test to do with the right test equipment. </s>
<s> If it is a PSU failure it is usually a fairly easy fix, just replace PSU. </s>
<s> Unless it is a very old system it is typically worth doing. </s>
