Simply jumper it as Slave and attach to the Primary IDE cable.
Then start you PC and check in the bIOS that the new HDD is recognized and then boot into XP and go to Disk Management.
Right-click the new HDD and create a new partition and then format it to NTFS before you can start using the HDD.
If you want to you can create more partitions to suit your needs.
If the drive letters are assigned after that for your CD-RW drive you cna use Disk Management to change the drive letters as you see fit.
