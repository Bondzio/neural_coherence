<s> Hey, alright so i've been having this probelm for awhile but now its really not working. </s>
<s> The first time it happen was when i restarted my computer one time, it just shutdown and didn't turn back on, then it wouldn't turn on. </s>
<s> What the computer does is the power light turns on, i can hear my fan getting a lot of air. </s>
<s> The probelm is, my computer has a HUGE fan so it doens't always run at full speed. </s>
<s> Just when it starts up for about 2-3 seconds, then if it gets hot. </s>
<s> When i turn on my computer and i get the probelm my van just keeps sucking in air. </s>
<s> Its like my computer is working fine and it turns on, but its only working right for abut 1 second. </s>
<s> After that second it like freezes or something it just sits there. </s>
<s> My lights turn on, my DVD rom trys reading my cd's, but my montior just stays black. </s>
<s> The computer some times after awhile turns on normal, but only after i turn it on and off many times, each time it always a differnt # of times, and this time it wont just turn on. </s>
<s> If any one has any ideas please thanks -Mythraz </s>
<s> 1. you may go for check connecting a different monitor. </s>
<s> if it works then after start deleat all driver files of earlier monitor. </s>
<s> then reconnect earlier monitor and put correct driver and set correct setting of monitor ( i.e. </s>
<s> 24 or 32 bit and 800X600 or very apropriate which monitor can sustain/see the monitor manual). </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> If 1 above does not work then please post the number of addon cards present in your PC and also video detail (i.e. </s>
<s> onboard or AGP or PCI). </s>
<s> Will try then after. </s>
<s> most monitors do not require a driver, your problem might be the monitor itself or a connection for the monitor but not a driver. </s>
<s> In most cases as yours, replacing the psu with a good one of equal wattage or *better* is the 1st step in a repair process. </s>
<s> However, it maybe possible the mtrbd. </s>
<s> or another compoent has failed. </s>
<s> The fans, etc. </s>
<s> turning on only suggests that at 12V is working, there are other voltages and likely one rail(V-outputs) has failed or been stripped of the amps it needs to turn things on. </s>
<s> The clue is repeated attempts may get the system going. </s>
<s> The mtrbd. </s>
<s> may have a failed capacitor(cap) that blown or leaked, etc.. A user can reduce the power demand by reducing the system, thus a possible clue if it boots-up. </s>
<s> That's no cure it just points int he right direct, replace psu. </s>
