Is it best to or more cost effective to get an internal drive and enclosure set up or a designated external hdd? I will need to add sata or usb 2.0 to the computer. The more information I read the more confusing the issue becomes. Thanks in advance for the help.

If you know how to use a screwdriver you can make your own. For most, a SATA connection is not viable. If you ask then it's not for you and you'll use USB. Bob
