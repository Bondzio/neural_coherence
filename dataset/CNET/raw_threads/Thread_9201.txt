I use a normal microphone headset with my laptop to communicate to my contacts via Yahoo. This setup is pretty good apart from the fact that i cannot move around my home whilst using it. I recently came up with the idea of connecting my bluetooth headset that i use with my mobile phone. This would free me up from me desk and allow me to easily move around. All went well with the connection, i.e. pairing up the headset to my laptop, then nothing. At this stage i cant use it. I was wondering if it was indeed possible to use a bluetooth headset with a bluetooth enabled PC so that you can communicate. Anyone had similar thoughts about this? Any help would be most appreciated. Regards......

The PC recognises the bluetooth device (WindowsXP Pro SR2) but I can not get any communication established to use it on my VoIP program 'SKYPE' it will only communicate with my mobile phone. If you, or anyone knows how to get this to work it would be a great breakthrough. Regards, Bob.

Ive spoken to a few people regarding this and they think it would be easier just to get a normal headset. That still doesnt solve the problem. I want to be able to move around freely and without cables.

I think the problem with using internally-built Bluetooth connection in the laptop is that the VOIP software (or in my case, my mapping program with voice prompts and voice command recognition) is looking for input/output from the microphone and speaker ports, not the Bluetooth port. Jabra makes a Bluetooth adapter for non-Bluetooth phones that plugs into the handsfree mini jack on the phone. I think some sort of adapter to split the phone connector into one input and one ouput that plugs into the laptop would provide the connectivity to Bluetooth headset you want. Of course, right now that probably means a home-built signal splitter made from parts from the Radio Shack or other electronics store. I have the Jabra Bluetooth adapter, I guess I will run down to Radio Shack and try to cobble up a splitter in the next few weeks (gone on vacation in the interim).

If you installed the Bluetooth support properly and ensured that the headset connects to the laptop, to make this work you need to tell the software (Skype, for example) to use &quot;Bluetooth Audio&quot; as the Audio In and Audio Out devices. I use my Sony Ericsson Blueetoh headset with Skype: go to Options, then to Sound Devices; for Audio In I select &quot;Bluetooth Audio&quot;, and the same for Audio Out. For Ringing I selected the laptop's sound card.

I have a Jabra BT200 which has been paired with my Desktop PC and recognised. However, I can not get any Audio in or out. The Bluetooth Radio Device setting does not recognise the Jabra BT200 - is this device not compatable with PAN (Personal Area Network) ? My Skype audio settings only show my soundcard (SoundBlaster) and the Windows Default as the two only choices of i/o. I have also tried to find that driver &quot;WidComm&quot; (or something) as a replacement driver for the Windows Bluetooth driver but I can only find discussion forums for it - Not the actual driver. To conclude I am using WindowsXP Pro SP2, Skype and a Jabra BT200 headset but no way can I get these to talk to one another never mind to me and my contacts. In the age of Blootooth technology, why is this proving to be such a problem. there must be thousands of of users trying to get this VoIP link to work wirelessly. All ideas welcome, please continue to research and help on this issue. Hutchy.

The general idea about Bluetooth is that it is just a wireless wire, a connection just like a simple cable. If two devices have bluetooth ''plugs'' then the magic bluetooth cable will connect them. Not so it seems. I have a Plantronics M3000 bluetooth handsfree which I bought for use with my mobile. It works fine with the phone. Like others I got a bluetooth USB adapter (A-link) for the laptop and it didn't work with the handsfree. I tried a D-Link product and didn't work either much to the confusion of the in-store technical department guru. After digging it appears that there are two protocols for these things: one is called Handsfree Protocol (HFP)the other Headset Protocol (HSP). Some USB adapters only support HSP. Hence the problem? The Belkin F8T012/013 USB adapter ''should work with all headsets which support either or both the HSP (Headset) or HFP (Handsfree) bluetooth services'' according to their technical support staff. Bluetooth versions are backwards compatible as you probably know so v.2.0 will work with v.1.1 and v.1.0. Having said that, I have yet to get hold of the Belkin adapter. They do not have a supplier in Nordic countries I am told by stores here in Finland, even though the Belkin web site says they do! To make matters worse, hardly anyone seems to know of this protocol issue so it's very hard to find out what protocols are supported by any particular USB adapter. The wondrous world of consumer electronics! Does anyone else know anything about this?

I got a Bluetake BT400GL headset for my girlfriend. it's very small and specially in PINK color. =) it has 15 hours talking time, and a recharging dock. also, it has vibration alert. it's around $70 bucks their website is www.bluetakeusa.com

I bought a Cardo Scala 700 BT headset since it can pair with two devices (cell phone and computer). Yahoo IM has a feature Actions&gt;Call Setup that allowed me to ensure the speaker and mike signals were re-directed from my computer to the BT headset. Really cool but I want all audio to be transferred to my headset - and I cannot get it to work. Found some excellent suggestions at http://www.bluetoothpcheadsets.com/audioproperties.htm but it did not make the connection. Everyone is talking about this functionality - has no one got this to work? Thanks.

After having my headset identified by my laptop. I went to quick connect and disabled the connection while my headset was still on. Then I enable the connection through the quick connect and I got a sound from my headset like I was getting a call. I answered through my headset and then the headset worked as both speaker and microphone. Hope this helps =)

I have an Inspiron 9300 by Dell that I am trying to connect to a Motorola h300 BT headset for phones. First things first, how do I put my laptop into &quot;search&quot; mode for the bluetooth? I have a bluetooth light on my keyboard (that isn't lit) so I assume my laptop is already BT enabled, but I have no idea how to &quot;turn it on&quot; so that it can then seek my headset. Can anyone help?

The bluetooth headset that you use to talk on your phone isn't the same as a bluetooth stereo headset in which you can, listen music thru it. From reading the previous posts no one mentions this fact. So for example, if you were trying to use a non stereo headset for let's say gaming purposes, unless it is a stereo bluetooth you won't hear any audio on it. To test this try listening to music from your phone with a non bluetooth stero headset, it won't work. It can't stream the audio from it. My suggestion would be to invest in a bluetooth headset that offers stereo on it. You should then be able to use it on your computer(as long as it has bluetooth or bluetooth adapter)
