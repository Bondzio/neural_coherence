hello, my laser for my dvd drive has burned out, it is unable to read dvds.
anyways, i recently looked online for possible solutions and found out i can transfer a dvd drive from one of my old computers into the burned out one.
so i thought of my toshiba laptop.
then i started to think if it wouldnt work since laptops are compressed hardware and you cant upgrade them etc.
so my question is; is it possible to extract my dvd drive from my toshiba laptop and place in my desktop computer (windows xp professional edition) if so please explain the steps.
thank you
