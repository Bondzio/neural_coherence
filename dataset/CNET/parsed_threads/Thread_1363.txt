<s> Hello all... Once again I have a question about a Mac. </s>
<s> I have a B&W G3/350MHz machine that I received a NewerTech G4/400MHz processor with. </s>
<s> The problem is this: To run this processor, it requires a Firmware Update that originally came with the processor (when it was new). </s>
<s> I do not have this needed Firmware Update. </s>
<s> Is it possible to get this update online somewhere or do I have a processor that is no good to anyone? </s>
<s> Thanks, Jason </s>
<s> have the simplest answers. </s>
<s> What exactly did you find at the Newer Technology Website? </s>
<s> I found a link to another site where all the Newer Technology drivers and firmware updaters were available. </s>
<s> As long as the processor still works, the machine will run OS 10.4 quite comfortably, albeit a little slowly. </s>
<s> Tip: You have the manufacturers name, try their website first. </s>
<s> newertechnology.com P </s>
