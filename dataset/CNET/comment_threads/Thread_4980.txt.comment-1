To elaborate, is there a feasible way to downclock(?)
the GPU in order to still have it &quot;in reserve&quot; for when I need it?
Basically, I'm looking to know if it's worth getting a GPU only to use some of the time---so if I can't turn it down or otherwise minimize the excessive battery drain, then I will just stick with the Intel GMA.
I don't do too much away from AC power, but having some semblance of battery life is good to have.
