<s> My printer, HP LaserJet 4, recently just stopped working. </s>
<s> My computer is using XP. </s>
<s> I have been through the trouble shooter and did everything it told me to do, but it is still not working. </s>
<s> It will print a test page, so there is nothing wrong with the printer. </s>
<s> I would uninstall and reinstall it, but can't find where to do that. </s>
<s> The printers don't come up in the add/remove hardware. </s>
<s> Also when I click on &quot;Find Printers&quot; I get an error message (Directory Service is unavailable) I am not savvy enough to know what printer drivers to delete manually. </s>
<s> Sigh.... </s>
<s> I NEED my printer desperately. </s>
<s> You said it will print a test page. </s>
<s> Do you mean from it's built-in feature or from your PC? </s>
<s> If it's just from your PC it won't work, it could be a driver, faulty port (parallel usually). </s>
<s> Give more details about how it's connected. </s>
<s> I'm fairly certain these required an enhanced printer port setting in ones BIOS. </s>
<s> Assuming that you loaded the printer software it should appear in ADD REMOVE PROGRAMS in control panel and should be removable from there. </s>
<s> If you find it and can remove it (from control panel) try reinstalling the software from the CD. </s>
<s> When you said test page, from where did you print the page? </s>
<s> If you can run a test print from WORD PAD or NOTE PAD, the printer is functional, that is a very easy test to run. </s>
<s> If not, back to square one. </s>
