hey guys there was a post on here earlier about this, but its been deleted for some reason.
anyways... any of you guys heard about intellipaper?
they have information stored on a paper that goes into your usb drive.
they have a website but it doesn't show much of what the usb is capable of holding on it.
has anyone out there used it?
