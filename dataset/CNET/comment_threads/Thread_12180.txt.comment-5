Thanks Willy, I've given it plenty of time, while having a meal myself, but it just stands there.
And I've fed it a floppy &quot;CD-ROM Setup Boot DIsk&quot; and left it both as Press &lt;DEL&gt; to enter SETUP or as Entering SETUP ... but it doesn't even try to read the floppy.
(I also got a floppy with Dell Dimension Vxxx/Vxxxc A08 FlashBIOS but as long as floppies aren't read it's not of much use.)
I reseated the memory chips earlier to exclude that they were causing the error but it didn't change anything other than the amount of memory being counted.
Suggestions?
Is there a point in removing the CMOS battery again?
