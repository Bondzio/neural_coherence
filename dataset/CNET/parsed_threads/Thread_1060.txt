<s> Hi everybody, I have a very frusterating issue with my webcam, about a week ago a friend gave me a logitech quickcam for notebooks pro. </s>
<s> All that he could find was the webcam itself, no intruction or cd software. </s>
<s> so i went to the logitech website and downloaded the latest driver and software and THEN connected it to my desktop computer. </s>
<s> So then i go to test it out and it does everything its supposed to exept that thier is know picture! </s>
<s> all that i see is black with a white bar along the left side of the screen. </s>
<s> I am pretty sure its not broken or anything because my friend siad that it worked fine when he had it. </s>
<s> So is thier anything that i can do to get it work? </s>
<s> PS. </s>
<s> I am assuming that notebook webcams are compatible with desktop computers. </s>
<s> Thanks, COnnor </s>
<s> You tried on 2 machines and neither worked. </s>
<s> Looks dead. </s>
