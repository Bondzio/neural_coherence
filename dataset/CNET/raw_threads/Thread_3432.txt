My pc specs are Galaxy Nvidia 6600GT, 1 GB ram. I just want to know is there way to configure a lcd screen because I look at the displaying lcd it is more lively, but for mine it just like a usual flat panel monitor except u can look from whatever angle.. or maybe it's just my illusion... thanks...
