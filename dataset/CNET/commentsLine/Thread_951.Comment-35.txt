sure, you can leave it as fat32 as it is compatiable with all major versions for windows (98/me/nt/2000/xp).
since ntfs is more secure but compatiable only with windows nt/2000/xp.
however you can have some ntfs and some fat32 drives, for this purpose you can use powerquest partition magic software.
its a user friendly and easy-to-use tool.
