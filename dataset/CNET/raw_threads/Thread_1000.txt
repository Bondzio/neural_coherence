It's been working fine but recently the message &quot;wireless network connection not connected&quot; has appeared. We can no longer connect through wireless. I've tried re-enabling it but no luck. I've tried the windows repair option but no luck. I've tried setting up the network again but still nothing. when i try to view available networks it says none in range. Is this a hardware failure? Can anyone advise me?? More Info We normally have to press a button for it to search the wireless networks and now when we press it nothing happens. Also if i right click the monitors and click view avaliable wireless networks its blank and nothing comes up!! Although there are at least 3/4 networks around my area including ours.

Lookup WINSOCKFIX and run that. Some laptops have a button to disable the wifi (aka Flight Mode) so be sure you don't have it in that mode. Bob

Have you tried the usual removal of battery, AC power and wait a few minutes, slip the battery in, the AC and try again? Bob
