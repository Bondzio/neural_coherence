8036	6	566060	5325488	5325487	r. proffitt	6/20/12 5:38 pm	1.34021388e12	it's a computer design decision.	i strongly suggest the designer answer any and all questions. you put your trust in them so they deserve the questions. here i have my reasons for finding the total amperes and getting a single rail psu. but this is not my design so let's hear from bit-tech. bob
8036	7	566060	5325495	5325488	darkicegb	6/20/12 5:42 pm	1.34021412e12	already posted	i've already posted a help thread on the forums, so hopefully they'll read it.
8036	8	566060	5325510	5325492	darkicegb	6/20/12 5:42 pm	1.34021412e12	forgot!	sorry i forgot that it also didn't work with the 750 watt psu in the 16x slot, so it's probably not the 450 watt psu. it's strange how it works in the 8x, when it says it should be in the 16x slot.
8036	9	566060	5325512	5325510	r. proffitt	6/20/12 6:02 pm	1.34021532e12	actually that is a clue.	i can't be sure of much given the story so far but if i saw this and all was good hardware the x16 slot can tap the psu just a little harder and cause a psu to fault or drop out. but this is just speculation and nothing more since i can't see the machine. the builder of the machine if they are seasoned may mention such to you. bob
8036	10	566060	5325521	5325512	darkicegb	6/20/12 6:10 pm	1.3402158e12	8x cut too	but the gtx 670 was cutting out in the 8x slot too. if what you speculated is the case, is the the fault of the gfx card, psu or motherboard, and would there be any way of fixing it? if this is true, then that would probably mean that neither of the psu's were faulty.
8036	11	566060	5325508	5325521	darkicegb	6/20/12 6:12 pm	1.34021592e12	ignore	ignore the last line above that starts with &quot;if this is true&quot;, i meant to remove it but can't edit anything!

8036	13	566060	5325542	5325509	darkicegb	6/20/12 7:11 pm	1.34021946e12	terrible	those reviews are pretty bad. what should i do about it all?
8036	14	566060	5325585	5325542	r. proffitt	6/20/12 9:57 pm	1.34022942e12	i see the maker is responding.	at the very least call it in and get it exchanged.
8036	15	566060	5325634	5325585	darkicegb	6/21/12 3:11 am	1.34024826e12	maker?	what do you mean the maker is responding? if i bought half of the parts from scan and the other half from dabs, but the antec psu's from scan damaged the parts, how am i going to get a refund for all of the parts? also, if i plan to overclock and sli later, will i need more than a 750 watt psu?

8036	17	566060	5325653	5325634	darkicegb	6/21/12 3:26 am	1.34024916e12	rubbish	had a reply from asus support: &quot;it seems to be a vga card in compbale issue. please check the bios is the latest.&quot; total rubbish.
8036	18	566060	5325655	5325635	darkicegb	6/21/12 3:41 am	1.34025006e12	who?	who's terms of sale? i've asked both scan and dabs. it should be scan - i'm not going to stop emailing them until they do and if they refuse then i'll take further action. it is their faulty psu that damaged it.
