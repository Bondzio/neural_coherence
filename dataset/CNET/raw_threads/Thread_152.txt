Can I use the Dlink Des-1105 port switch to do this? it has an input port and 4 other ports to plug ethernet cables into. I tried doing this and only 1 of the computers was working.

More importantly, you need to do some work at each PC to get them talking. You'll need to deal with TCP/IP protocol which requires a unique address for each PC. You'll need to configure a network name and names for the PCs. You'll need to set up shares on each if you want to move files back and forth. What have you done so far in this regard?

These switches are made to connect to a router that hands out DHCP TCP/IP addresses. That being said, you could still use them as long as you manually set TCP/IP addresses on each computer manually that are on the same subnet.
