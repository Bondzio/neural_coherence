<s> I tried to burn the cd 2 more times. </s>
<s> this time i was watching the light on the burner (external) and the writing light never came on at all, however the screen tells me that it was successful. </s>
<s> Maybe somthing wrong with burner? </s>
<s> I bought it almost 1 yr ago from Radio shack and have just recently tried to burn with it. </s>
<s> any other suggestions. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help </s>
<s> wow, that's odd. </s>
<s> so Nero says &quot;write/ burning process (whatever) successful&quot; but you can't read the disk . </s>

<s> hmmm . </s>
<s> I would try another blank disk, burning it again (maybe at a much slower speed? </s>
<s> ), but this time, after you click &quot;write CD&quot; and then click &quot;burn,&quot; look at the bottom of the window that appears and put a checkmark where it says &quot;verify written data.&quot; after the burn process it will eject and reinsert the disk automatically and compare the disk to the files you copied. </s>
<s> try that and lemme know - fj </s>
<s> Well I tried this 2 more times and each time it came up complete, but on the cdrw the witing light never comes. </s>
<s> I called Radio Shack today since thats where I bought it from and they ran me through a few things and they determined there was something wrong with the unit itself since the write lite dosent come on. </s>
<s> they suggest that I just buy a new one since this one is outdated it was a 6x4x6 and it probably be cheaper just to replace. </s>
<s> This really sucks since I've had it a year and a half and it had never even used since i bought it. </s>
<s> Until this past week. </s>
<s> thanks for all your help Nancy </s>
<s> If I run up NERO and select some &quot;image recorder CD/RW&quot; it will ask for some filename and go through all the motions, but the CD is blank. </s>
<s> Be sure you don't use the &quot;image recorder CD/RW&quot; </s>
<s> well sorry we couldn't get it to go -- but a 6x4x6, I say, time to upgrade! </s>
<s> you can get an internal burner for less than $50. </s>
<s> for brand names, (and I am not an expert) you can get a liteon or a plextor (I have one of each) and they haven't given me any trouble at all. </s>
<s> put the old one up on ebay, you'll be amazed at what people will buy --fj </s>
<s> I collect dead parts in hope of a cheap repair for someone. </s>
<s> When my pile of hard disks (years ago) was over 50 pounds and the likelyhood of scavenging a circuit board or cable to fix another was diminishing, I took the whole lot to some electronic flea market. </s>
<s> The boxes were marked &quot;DEAD HARD DRIVES 2 BUCKS&quot; The units were sold out in 15 minutes. </s>
<s> There's a lesson in there somewhere. </s>

<s> good idea, might just try that. </s>
<s> Thanks for all your help. </s>
<s> &quot;no one ever remained poor by underestimating the intelligence of the american people.&quot; he also said, of course, &quot;there's sucker born every minute.&quot; In some marketing book I read a story, someone had run an ad, &quot;ugly cats-- $100 each&quot; . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> they sold out in an hour. </s>
<s> if I may so bold as to suggest, next time, mark them as &quot;vintage&quot; dead drives and charge double. </s>
