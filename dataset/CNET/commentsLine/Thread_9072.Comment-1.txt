i recently installed a third harddrive in my comp for more storage space.
after turning the comp back on and formatting the partition, i have had nothing but trouble.
the comptuer is going slow.
(eg, playing winamp, if i try to open firefox, it will start stuttering...it is truly horrible) is there any way to find out what the problem is?
my system: 512 ram 2.4 ghz pentium 4 the harddrives: 80 gig primary, 2 secondary at 200 gig and 160 (the 160 is the new one) any help would be greatly appreciated!
