<s> A couple things 1) Don't get a MicroATX case because all the components will be close together, and there will be a lot of heat. </s>
<s> Get an ATX Mid Tower 2) I'd get a better PSU; I like the Antec True Power II 550 watt for $80. </s>
<s> 3) You forgot a video card 4) Why the IDE hard drives? </s>
<s> 5) Why only 512MB of RAM? </s>
<s> 6) Wait for Conroe to come out; AMD will lower the prices of thier dual-core CPUs by about 50% 7) Please change your formatting; leave lines between all the components, and just copy/paste the URL in so that it will be displayed as a link. </s>
<s> Your whole post is a formatting disaster, making it very hard to read and understand. </s>
<s> Thanks for all the help. </s>
<s> 1.) </s>
<s> Yeah I always buy normal ATX cases. </s>
<s> 2.) </s>
<s> The PSU works fine in my dads system, I've used it for years. </s>
<s> My dads computer also has a gig of ram. </s>
<s> Will the 400 watt PSU I have be enough for my AM2 system, I'm not planning on SLI or an extremely expensive video card. </s>

<s> Yeah sorry about that. </s>
<s> I usually post on Gamespot and they allow HTML tags there. </s>
<s> Also I don't know how to edit these posts. </s>
<s> Thanks again also is the Biostar motherboard any good? </s>
<s> AM2 motherboards require a 24-pin main connection. </s>
<s> Mine has the 20 + 4 main connection that fits together and a seperate 4 pin for the CPU will that work? </s>
<s> Thanks again and I'll stop using HTML </s>
<s> For my computer I'm swapping out the Biostar mobo for this http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813127236 Abit mobo. </s>
<s> Anyone know if this is a good mobo or not? </s>
<s> Thanks for all the help. </s>
<s> Aight, here's the deal. </s>
<s> The new mobo you're looking at didn't exactly get the best reviews on newegg, at least. </s>
<s> I know, most of the posts people make are negative usually anyway, but it's just a thought. </s>
<s> Second, that mobo doesn't have integrated video, so you'll have to get a videocard, too. </s>
<s> Low-end GeForce 7 series cards are near or under $100. </s>
<s> If you're not looking at eventually going SLI, drop down to an Nforce 570 Ultra board. </s>
<s> It might be hard to find one that will support more than 2 IDE devices, though. </s>
<s> You will need more ram, even if it's not necessarily DDR2 800 speed. </s>
<s> I went with DDR2 667, and it runs like a dream. </s>
<s> Definitely use a dual-core processor, it's the only way to go. </s>
<s> --chedrz </s>
<s> 3.} </s>
<s> My dads computer has integrated and I still haven't decided which PCI-E card I want for my main computer. </s>
<s> How much can you spend on the video card? </s>
<s> The 7600GT is the best choice for less than $200, the X1800XT and 7900GT tie for the $200-300 class, and the X1900XT is the best for $300-400. </s>
<s> The X1900XTX and 7900GTX are the top-line cards, but it's hard to recommend them when an X1900XT performs so closely for $100 less. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813127236 Abit mobo. </s>
<s> What about this one? </s>
<s> Also I'll probably go for a cheap 7300 at least for now. </s>
<s> All I need it to do right now is run Soldier of Fortune II decently. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I'll probably get a 7600GS after my 7300. </s>
<s> Thanks for the suggestions. </s>
<s> I play a lot of older games and currently have little interest in todays games. </s>
<s> I probably will later though. </s>
<s> A lot of people are having issues getting OCZ memory to work on AM2 motherboards, at least on this one. </s>
<s> 2 or three of the seven posts say something about problems with OCZ RAM. </s>
<s> Honestly, if you're not wanting SLI, I'd go with something like this Asus. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813131022 If you're looking at eventual SLI, I'd get the Asus M2N-SLI Deluxe board. </s>
<s> I know I'm selling Asus big, but that's cause they're good. </s>
<s> I bought this board, and the only issue I have is a BIOS issue involving CPU temps that hasn't been ironed out yet. </s>
<s> I think a few people have had OCZ probs with this board too, though. </s>
<s> I was actually looking at the Asus M2N-E mobo and the only thing that I didn't like was that they said it was extremely finicky about RAM. </s>
<s> Thoughts? </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> :) I have been having a lot of trouble finding a good AM2 mobo. </s>
<s> Well, I bought the M2N-SLI Deluxe. </s>
<s> The list of RAM it supports in the manual is short (a chart on one page with maybe 30 entries). </s>
<s> However, I bought all my stuff at once (thank you, student loans!!!) </s>
<s> and didn't have a chance to see that my Mushkin eXtreme performance ddr2 667mhz ram wasn't supported. </s>
<s> And I didn't read the book, either. </s>
<s> But, I dropped it in, cranked up the voltage to where it should be, and I have yet to have a problem. </s>
<s> The only RAM that I'm really seeing a problem with from anyone is OCZ sticks. </s>
<s> You'll have no problems (99.99% sure on this) with any Corsair ram, since they have a little partnership going on with Nvidia. </s>
<s> Mushkin should be fine, as I found out, also. </s>
<s> I would assume the same applies to the M2N-E as well, since it's basically the same board, minus a PCIe slot and Firewire, if I'm not mistaken. </s>
<s> That's great I really wanted to get a Asus or MSI board but they both seemed to have problems. </s>
<s> I'll be switching my RAM to http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16820145566 . </s>
<s> Will there eventually be a bios upgrade to fix the RAM problem though. </s>
<s> Also would there be anyway to update my bios without using a floppy drive? </s>
<s> Thanks again, you have been very helpful:) </s>
<s> I'll probably get a 7600GS after my 7300. </s>
<s> Thanks for the suggestions. </s>
<s> I play a lot of older games and currently have little interest in todays games. </s>
<s> I probably will later though. </s>
<s> Get a 7600GT for a couple bucks more. </s>
<s> You won't regret it. </s>
<s> eVGA 7600GT $135 after rebate </s>
<s> That RAM should be fine. </s>
<s> I wish I could tell you if Asus would be releasing a BIOS update to fix the RAM issues, but I don't really know. </s>
<s> I'm sure they will, they still have a few bugs to work out. </s>
<s> Right now, my mobo is reporting my CPU temp in the 60's, which is easily 20C higher than it actually is. </s>
<s> Again, another BIOS issue that has to be worked out (at least that's what AMD's telling me.) </s>
<s> If you happen to get rediculous CPU temps, just check to see how hot your heatsink is, and judge by that. </s>
<s> Anyway, back to your question. </s>
<s> Yes, you should be able to update the BIOS without a floppy. </s>
<s> I'm assuming that Asus will be distributing the same software with most Nforce 500 chipsets, on this. </s>
<s> My mobo came with a few options, most notably being that you can download the BIOS updates and flash them WHILE IN WINDOWS!!! </s>
<s> No floppy required anymore, which is good, because I don't have one. </s>
<s> You can use that software, Phoenix BIOS utility, or a USB drive. </s>
<s> And, if you happen to mess something up, just slip the mobo driver cd back into the computer, and you can reflash the BIOS upon startup. </s>
<s> Asus is making things really simple, which I appreciated a lot since this was my first build. </s>
<s> Anyway, if you need anything else, just let me know. </s>
<s> --Chedrz </s>
<s> Thats good news about being able to update the BIOS in windows. </s>
<s> Also thanks again for pointing me in the right direction for the mobo. </s>
<s> I'll definitely be getting the ASUS mobo. </s>
<s> I just have one more question and then I'll stop bothering you lol This PSU http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817104953 has a 20 + 4 pin main connection however I can't seem to connect them together. </s>
<s> I have a second 4 pin connector that is presumably for the CPU. </s>
<s> I was wondering if the 20 + 4 was supposed to clip together or if I could just put them in seperately. </s>
<s> Thanks again for the help. </s>
<s> Can't wait till Conroe hits. </s>
<s> :):) </s>
<s> You're not supposed to be able to connect the 2 together. </s>
<s> The plugs are separate. </s>
<s> The 20 pin connector is on one portion of the board, and the 4 pin connector is somewhere else. </s>
<s> So this is no problem, it's actually how the mobo is set up. </s>
<s> --chedrz </s>
<s> Good news about the PSU. </s>
<s> thanks again your help was exactly what I needed. </s>
