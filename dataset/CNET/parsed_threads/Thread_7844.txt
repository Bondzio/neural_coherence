<s> How can I connect my WD hard disc to access this over my home wifi network. </s>
<s> The wifi is Airport Extreme </s>
<s> http://www.apple.com/airportextreme/features/harddrivesharing.html I'm left to guess you are asking folk to duplicate the Apple support on this. </s>

<s> It's not completely clear to me what you mean. </s>
<s> Assuming you have a bare hard drive not installed in anything, you can buy an enclosure for it for about $20 and connect to your computer via a USB cable. </s>
<s> But then I don't know why WiFi would be a factor. </s>
<s> If you're talking about connecting a PC to a network via WiFi, you can buy a USB adapter that does that nicely for as little as $10. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> the hard disc is connected via usb to airport extreme but can not see it on my pc. </s>
<s> Despite trying not successful so far. </s>
<s> when the disc is connected to laptop via usb cable then it is ok. </s>
<s> But if possible I would like this disc to be available to my laptop using my home wifi </s>
<s> You mentioned Airport Extreme in conjunction with WiFi, so it sounded like this was a wireless router. </s>
<s> I don't know how you could expect to connect a hard drive to that - I don't believe that's possible. </s>
<s> Is this Airport Extreme some kind of server? </s>
<s> Please elaborate. </s>
<s> &quot; Windows users, a simple-to-use AirPort Disk Utility provides a variety of setup options, including setting the disk to become available whenever you connect to the network.&quot; </s>
