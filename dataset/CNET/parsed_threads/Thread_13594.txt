<s> Hello, I have a abit ai7 motherboard. </s>
<s> I've owned it for about 3 years know. </s>
<s> Recently I've noticed that I would get no sound out of the right speaker when using headphones. </s>
<s> To solve this I would have to pull out one of the audio plugs connecting the desktop speakers to the back of the motherboard and plug it back in for it to work. </s>
<s> Is this the beginning of th end of the on board sound? </s>
<s> Should I start looking for a sound card? </s>
<s> Or can I fix this? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> ...but have you tried using a different pair of headphones or speakers to confirm the problem isn't specific to a specific pair/set? </s>
