I installed a mobo and everything exept for processor, first without spacers and it did nothing. I noticed and I removed it, put spacers and now all the fans turn on. But no video or beeping. Mobo is supposed to recognize when there is or isnt processor. Did I fry the mobo? What are tell tale signs of a burnt mobo? thanks

I havent received the processor yet it is being shipped and the reason I put it together with what I had was because I got a really good deal on the mobo and wanted to see if there was some reason for it being so cheap before the return deadline got here.

The will NOT work without a processor. &quot; Did I fry the mobo?&quot; Only time will tell!!! When you get your processor, make sure that you MB is CORRECTLY insatlled and only putin the componets that arer listed in the link and see waht happens. John http://www.duxcw.com/faq/mb/minboot.htm
