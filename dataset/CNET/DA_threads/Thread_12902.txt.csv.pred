1.1.1	I thought it was the power supply at first after updating nvidia drivers , but I decided to try msi 's kombustor benchmark software and ran the fuzzy and furry stress test .	St
1.1.2	My pc did not shut off for the whole 10 minutes I ran it while my graphics card was under 100 % load and 101 % power draw .	St
1.1.3	This threw me off completely and now I do n't know what is going on .	St
1.1.4	This did n't start happening until I reinstalled bf3 and punkbuster .	St
1.1.5	( PB is for connecting to servers in bf3 ) I also would like to add that updating my nvidia drivers only made it shut off instantly when graphics were loaded instead of a few minutes after .	St
1.1.6	I have had the same setup for about 4-5months and I have never had this problem until now .	St
1.1.7	i5 3570k z77a-gd55 2x4 gskill 1600mhz cas 8 256g samsung 830 series MSI gtx 670 Power edition Corsair HX750w 80 Plus gold with 90 % efficiency	St
1.2.1	It looks to be in warranty .	St
1.2.2	Have the maker fix this machine since you can crash it on demand .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	I built the system myself .	St
1.3.2	The power supply is still under warranty .	St
1.3.3	I am just trying to make sure it is n't something else before I send it out for an RMA .	St
1.3.4	When it did fine during the benchmark it baffled me .	St
1.4.1	You seem to created this when you updated the drivers .	St
1.4.2	Go back to what worked ?	Ques
1.5.1	I said it had already been shutting off when playing games for a few days .	St
1.5.2	I figured updating the drivers might fix it , but only made it worse .	St
1.6.1	I guess I did n't clarify that actually my mistake .	St
1.6.2	The problem did n't start until I moved into a new place and reinstalled bf3 and punk buster .	St
1.6.3	I tried updating the drivers to see if it would fix the issue a few days later .	St
1.7.1	Sadly you have to use what you 've learned so far to make your best guess at what to replace .	St
1.7.2	From my lessons in the field I find it 's usually the video card if the machine is fine in respect to power , cooling and such .	St
1.7.3	The hard part is the owner .	St
1.7.4	Most paid dearly for the video card and will second guess you every time .	St
1.7.5	That 's fine but you have to base your decisions on either a hard fail , swap a thing or what you 've seen over the years .	St
1.7.6	In this case I give the nod to trying another video card given the story so far .	St
1.7.7	HOWEVER ! ! ! ! !	St
1.7.8	Be sure to research that BF3 game forums .	St
1.7.9	It would not be funny to find folk with lockup/reboot/freeze issues in that forum and then find a patch there .	St
1.7.10	I did not do your research for you on that topic .	St
1.7.11	Bob	St
