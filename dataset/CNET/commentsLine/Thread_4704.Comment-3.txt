to store photos, documents, etc.
but i thought that an external hard drive would be a better solution.
&quot;external hdds are not reliable for single source data storage.
having read the posts in storage ... that should be pretty obvious.&quot; yes, that's why i posted here as i am now completely unsure how to keep my digital photos and documents &quot;safe&quot;!
now, would using a dvd be a better option that a cd-r or an ext hard drive?
