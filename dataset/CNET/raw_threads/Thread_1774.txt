After it was put back together it won't boot into Windows. The power shuts off completely as soon as it gets past the BIOS screen. The power stays on no-problem in Setup Mode...but it seems as soon as the CPU is used the machine shuts down. This is a 2.4 gig Intel machine. Is it possible for the CPU to cause this problem?

Some don't put that back on, or don't know that some HEATSINK COMPOUND will have to be added. Tip: Even the Radio Shack heatsink compound may do fine here. Bob

You can look up what light code you get at the Dell web site to see what may be the cause of this problem. You should also make sure to reseat the memory and any cards installed in the system, something loose could cause this.

Newer Bios lets you change these in the BIOS setup. The multiplier takes the motherboards speed (i.e.if motherboards speed is 66mhz, you need a multiplier of 3 to get a CPU speed of 200mhz (198 rounds off to 200). Maybe one of these were changed.If the voltage switch or setup config is off, DON'T BOOT ANYMORE TILL YOU FIX IT (unless ofcourse you have to to enter BIOS setup and reset it)It cound fry the CPU. If the voltage/multiplier is OK, try starting in Safe Mode (hold F5 when booting)and go into control panel/systen and look for any problems.Go to Start/Run and load Dr Watson (Drwtsn32.exe for WinXP, Drwatson.exe for Win98)then try to reboot. Dr Watson will log exactly what happens during the boot and will show whats happening (as far as software goes). It actually reminds me of a power cable disconnected from the hard drive (or the data cable) Check all cables. Let us know what happens. DCO
