i just purchased the linksys wrtsl54gs router.
after many many calls to them just to get it able to get online, i now want to be able to use it for network storage.
i have a dell inspiron 6000 wirelessly connected to it, and a maxtor 100gb hard drive connected to the router via usb.
following linksys' instruction manual, i can ftp to the drive.
however, i can't see it in my network places.
can someone please help?
