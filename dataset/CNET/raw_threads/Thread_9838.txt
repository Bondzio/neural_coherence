However, I recently changed some settings for IE6.0 due to security concerns that I read about on CNET, and after making those changes (disabling the active scripting) and my yahoo mail page changed drastically after that! My page used to have a box on the left side of the screen showing my folders etc. and now when I hit the mail button I go to my inbox and can't even get to the other folders! I can't seem to find a way to get back my old mail page and even after resetting the security items in my IE 6.0 security tab, the old page is gone! The new page does not appear to be the most modern version of the mail inbox page and I am trying to put back the old controls! HELP!!
