I recently discovered the SMC Barricade broadband router I use does not allow me to log the IP addresses of external clients accessing an apache web server which sits behind the router.
Is there some special protocol or feature I should look for in a router so that I can log external IP addresses, or can anyone just point me to any SOHO routers that can do this?
thanks.kah
