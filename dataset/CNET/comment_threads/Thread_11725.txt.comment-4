I don't really want to have a hard drive on the bread board.
So even if I put a small op sys on the keychain drive, I guess that I could put a version of DOS on it, and the Win 98 type boot floppy programs, I still have a problem.
But Tucson, think about a mobo where it allows booting from USB.
It seems that Windows doesn't get involved during the inital boot.
[I realize that this mobo doesn't mention booting from USB].
I'll check to see if there is a BIOS update.
I haven't got the CPU for the breadboard yet, really surprised how well the prices on the older AMD XP CPU's has stayed up.
Thanx for your interest.
