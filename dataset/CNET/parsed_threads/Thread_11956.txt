<s> My 120 GB WD was working normally, i format it from a while and accidentally deleted all manufacture drivers/folders that comes originally with it. </s>
<s> After that i continued to work properly for a couple of weeks and now suddenly i can see it anymore! </s>
<s> I connect it to my laptop or desktop - i tried different USBs and machine and different operating systems (xp & vista) but no result. </s>
<s> It shows in the tray bar that i have an external connected, it shows in the device manager inside the &quot;disk drives&quot; a &quot;WD&quot; icon but with no specifications so i can't see it in my computer neither in computer management---&gt;disk management !! </s>
<s> So please tell me what i can do?what is the solution?now i don't mind to loose my data on it but i want it to work again. </s>
<s> I hope to receive a helpful answer from you and thanks in advance. </s>
<s> If u need to know anything else i am ready. </s>
<s> Seems broken. </s>
<s> Essentially, an external drive has 2 parts: 1. </s>
<s> The case 2. </s>
<s> The drive I'd start with buying a new case and mount the existing drive in it. </s>
<s> Then see if it works. </s>
<s> Could very well be. </s>
<s> If it doesn't, buy a new drive also. </s>
<s> That probably leaves you with one broken disc and one spare case for future use. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Thx for the quick reply, maybe i have to add that it's a passport size external not the normal size one that can be opened easily and checked on another case or even used as internal to check. </s>
<s> By the way i know about the externals but thx anyway for the explanation. </s>
<s> I hope that there is some solutions out there. </s>
<s> the options are: - have it repaired by a repair shop - buy a new one without caring about repair Kees </s>
<s> I just picked up a wd 500 gig for 89.00 at best buy if its any help </s>
