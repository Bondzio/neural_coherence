However, many flat cables have two drive connectors, not one, a point which the narrator did not cover. Also, the Windows propaganda preceding the video is obnoxious. Can it be removed?

Did you have a question there? One connector or two, it doesn't matter. If you have only one drive, put it on the end of the cable. I have round cables on my home built. One cable, two connectors for my two HDs, and aonther for my two optical drives.

You can also buy floppy cables with only two connectors either round or ribbon, big deal. Of course I have no idea what video you are talking about.
