I want to do all Roxio jobs on this harddrive because when I do it on my C: drive it is painfully slow. Can I do this? How can I install Roxio on my WD drive? Thanks

But USB drives are not too quick compared to internals. Nice place for a backup copy but not a true backup. Think of USB drives as extended but a little slower storage space. Bob

Given only the details you elected to share so far all I can note is that you can't be given more than a generic answer because the details are not in your posts. I don't ask for such since that is asked for every time you make a post. That is, &quot;the words in red.&quot;

Those came with either sata or ide drives so the exact model number is called for. If these can't be found then it's a trip to a service counter to get it done. Bob
