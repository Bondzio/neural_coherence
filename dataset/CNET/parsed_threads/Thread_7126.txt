<s> I seldom use my Lexmark Z52 to print in color, maybe once every few weeks, but even after a few days the color cartridge won't print all the colors. </s>
<s> The yellow clogs up soonest, then the blue. </s>
<s> (You can go weeks without the black cartridge clogging up.) </s>
<s> Cleaning the nozzles from within the Lexmark control program does not unclog the yellow and blue inks. </s>
<s> The only way to fix it, which is not just a hassle but expensive inkwise, is to remove the cartridge, soak the bottom in hot water, wipe it with alcohol, then use the printer software to spray out the nozzles. </s>
<s> Does there exist a printer with color inks that do not dry out so fast? </s>
<s> I use the Epson Stylus Photo R800. </s>
<s> I have had the cartridges (all 8 of them) in there for over a year and like you, I don't print all that often either. </s>
<s> I have yet to have a problem. </s>
<s> The quality of ink has everything to do on its clogging ability. </s>
<s> On the cheaper side, I use the Brother MFC 210C without the clogging. </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> If you don't then please use the &quot;proper&quot; shutdown procedure for any printer, suaully hitting the printer's own power-OFF button. </s>
<s> Don't use a power strip, you didn't mention. </s>
<s> Infrequent usage is common problem for many printer's as the &quot;capping mechanism&quot; is very simple and truly places a rubber cap upon the printhead to seal against the outside. </s>
<s> Wear&tear plus any ink build-up can allow a small gap to appear and increase the lilelyhood of dried nozzles. </s>
<s> The best defense against this is to actaully power-ON the printer even if not used to allow it to &quot;cycle&quot; through as a basic reflooding of the ink pathways and/or simple complete test printout to &quot;refresh&quot; nozzles, otherwise intense cleaning and actions as you've stated are required. </s>
<s> The Lexmark Z-series are simple printers so you get what you pay for. </s>
<s> There are better designed(expensive to Lexmark) printers though still simple that do a better job but they too fall prey to infrequent usage, again the advice applies above. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I have only turned it on when needed, hence have always shut it off manually. </s>
<s> Are you saying that merely turning it on every day or two should repressurize the nozzles and keep them from drying? </s>
<s> It would seem that the nozzle surface would need to be warmed up also to redissolve whatever was beginning to precipitate out. </s>
<s> Does powering it on also warm it up? </s>
<s> In the case of this poor Lexmark (which I bought on the recommendation of a widely-read computer magazine), the longer between uses, the more encrustation is visible on the nozzle surfact. </s>
<s> It would seem then that the rubber seal has lost its pliability, but the printer has been this way since the beginning, about 5 years ago, so either it was defective to begin with or this is a design defect, perhaps cost related. </s>
<s> The Lexmark Z-series had or is being sued for issues not of ink dryouts but rather the &quot;paper media feed jams&quot; that are constant or appear during the life of the printer. </s>
<s> regardles, that's not your issue(is it?). </s>
<s> Turning on the printer does not warm-up the ink nozzles itself, only actual printing or cleaning does. </s>
<s> It does usually go through a cycling which wipes the ink cart print face and by going by the amount of usage/time from the monitoring s/w or build-in h/w(not sure) it will spray to clean and refresh the ink pathways. </s>
<s> Yes, ink crud does build-up and overtime causes its own problem and transfers alot of ink to the wiper and parking cap. </s>
<s> The printer itself can be easily served by the user, provided you're capable of removing the skins(covers) to access the printing mechanism fully exposed. </s>
<s> Don't try this while skins are on, it will be too hard and may cause problems itself. </s>
<s> I forget exactly but only a few screws hold it together and maybe a snap-on/off parts. </s>
<s> Once done access the parking station area when the printhead rests after shutting-OFF and power removed, lift the prthead and slide away and clean the area with a damp(water) cloth or paper shop towel and remove all ink residue/crud from cap&wiper, etc.. </s>
<s> The wiper is a simple rubber blade, thus you see how simple overall all this is but its what protects the inkcart when parked. </s>
<s> Consider yourself well off still using a 5-yr. old Z-series printer, but expect these problems on any inkjet printer as it does effect all of them some more than others. </s>
