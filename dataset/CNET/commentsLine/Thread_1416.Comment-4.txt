2gb of ram is flawless for modern systems, even with vista, and the rest of your system seems to be decent, i'd go for the graphics card, the 8800 is in no way required, marketing and nvidia will tell us that you can't game without 8800 sli, specialist press, years of experience, and other proof will tell us that a 7600gt is easily sufficient for modern games and an 8600gt is even better i'd go with the 8600 for two reasons: a) vista will slow slow your (any) computer down compared to windows xp, because vista uses more resources, not to mention vista's known issues with, oh, about every software application in the known universe that isn't from microsoft, and even some that are from microsoft b) the 8600 will be a large performance jump from your 7300, and will match nicely with your x2 4200 and other hardware (it'll achieve a balance, performance/price wise, which will give you a better experience from the system).
i'd look for the 8600 online, should be able to be had for around $110-$130, other considerations, graphics card wise: radeon hd 2600pro radeon hd 2600xt geforce 8600gts they're all in roughly the same performance arena, all dx10, the reason i bring up the radeons is because of his and msi (board vendors) putting two slot cooling solutions on those boards, while the 8600 series is generally regarded as faster (by a few % here and there) than the hd 2600 series, the hd 2600 series is available with better stock cooling, which is always a plus (and it doesnt add $20-$30 to the price like aftermarket would add to an 8600)
