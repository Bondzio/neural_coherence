Already downloaded and installed, but without the video card in the slot, they are not active.
Still put video card in slot, no video, and yes I have the monitor plugged into the PCI video card or the onboard video (APG) and no video signal, but as soon as I remove the PCI video card I get signal over the onboard video (APG).
I only have 1 PCI slot.
