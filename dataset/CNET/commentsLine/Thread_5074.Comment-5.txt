there are tons of good pc's.. go to circuit city to make a purchase..circuit city has a good customer service policy.. i just built my first pc/but the lenovo brand seems really interesting.. .. dell makes great pc's and laptops..but you fairly well get stuck w/the configuration you intitally purchased..upgrades are risky.. .. toshiba makes great products.. .. sony/is expensive....i quess there are sony fans out there..i have a sony burner drive(its excellent).. .. panasonic makes laptops called tough-books..take a look there.. .. acer...i saw an acer at circuit city-a laptop...didn't need a laptop but was vert tempted..nice priced laptop.. .. $$5000.00 will get you one heck of a pc.
