<s> I was just wondering how fast my ram should be running at. </s>
<s> I got dual256 sticks but my computer is running at 448 because of an undecided reason, i would like to know how fast my ram should be running without any programs working, my computer seems to only work at 30-40% of 448 and i was wondering if that was normal or if i should perhaps try to change something. </s>
<s> is &quot;clocked&quot; at motherboard level and is accessed by devices that need it. </s>
<s> It's speed is not independent of the rest of your system as it must work with it. </s>
<s> You might have some control over clock speed through your BIOS or MB jumpers in some cases (mostly older boards). </s>
<s> You should be able to see your processor speed setting in your BIOS. </s>
<s> Your RAM modules should have an SPD component which is used by your BIOS to determine it's capabilites and optimize their performance. </s>
<s> Check your BIOS to see if these setting have been set manually. </s>
<s> If so, set them to something that refers to SPD. </s>
<s> I am not seeing what you are saying, could you please re-explain or maybe more in depth? </s>
<s> You cannot clock RAM independantly to gain speed. </s>
<s> Your MB clocking determines this. </s>
<s> You might have some control over this clock through BIOS or jumper settings but change such with extreme caution. </s>
<s> Go into your BIOS by interrupting the boot process and look for RAM settings. </s>
<s> See if you find anything about SPD and set your system to use the information from this. </s>
<s> If you set such things as wait states and latency manually and these are not within the performance range of the memory modules, you may wind up with an unstable system. </s>
<s> Hello Note that if you deduct the 448 from 512 (256x2), you are left with 64. </s>
<s> This will very likely have been assigned to on-board graphics. </s>
<s> The amount memory assigned to your graphics can be seen/set in the BIOS. </s>
<s> I trust this answers your question. </s>
<s> Kind regards. </s>
<s> so should i increase or decrease this, could i decrease this to zero and then it will run on its own without using memory or would that cause it not to work? </s>
<s> Sorry for the late reply. </s>
<s> Your BIOS settings will dictate how little or high you can set the amount of memory to assign to on-board graphics. </s>
<s> I don't suppose you will be able to set this to zero. </s>
<s> If you were able to, you wouldn't be able to display anything unless of course you had an additional graphics card installed. </s>
<s> Some boards, in network systems for example, may have a default allocation of 1Mb which you will not be able to change. </s>
<s> Ordinarily you can function reasonably well on as little as 1Mb, albeit a little more might be better... 8Mb for example. </s>
<s> However, if you play computer games then you will perhaps have an idea from these, how much graphic memory is recommended. </s>
<s> However much memory is assigned to the on-board graphics will be subtracted from the total RAM installed, e.g. </s>
<s> 512-32Mb=480Mb. </s>
