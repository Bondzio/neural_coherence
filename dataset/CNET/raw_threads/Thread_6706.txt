I was wondering what would be better: a Wireless Access Point or a Wireless Desktop Card. I do have one free PCI expansion slot for the Card. However, I was wondering if one was better than the other when it comes to speed, coverage (distance from router), etc. Anyone have any thoughts? Thanks!

For some reason I thought a WAP received a wireless signal (from, lets say another wireless item, like my router). I did not realize a WAP actually creates (pushes) a wireless signal out from a wired network.
