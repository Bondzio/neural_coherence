go back to the corsair list and pick one that's 750w or bigger.
with a 125w cpu and a 250w gpu your going to be producing some serious heat.
it should not take very long to figure out if the case cooling system is adequate.
sometimes an easy fix is to just take the side cover off.
did you notice how your getting closer to that 1000 buck mark i mentioned?
