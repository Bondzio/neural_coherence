Beware, your DVD writer will need s/w to burn any CDs or DVDs which may or may not be included with your DVD package. I also suggest you place the DVD on the 2nd IDE port a nd be sure if you have a CD drive already install that you &quot;jumper&quot; for correct install under master/slave setup. As a last note, you may want to increase your ram installed in the future. good luck -----Willy
