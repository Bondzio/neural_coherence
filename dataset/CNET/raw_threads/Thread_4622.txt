My computer detected signal from my neighbors house as well as from my own router. What prevents my neighbor from accessing files on my computer? The firewall? Are there any precautions I should take for added security? Also, the router is less than 50 feet away from the computer, yet the signal strength is poor. How can I increase the signal strength? Any help is appreciated.

Proffitt	12/9/04 9:59 AM	1.10258634E12	Re: Newly installed home wireless network (802.11g)	Both these terms and items are either in the router's manual or the maker's web site. Since I don't see the make/model in your last reply, I leave it to you to look at the maker's web site for the FIRMWARE update and how to enable MAC filtering.
