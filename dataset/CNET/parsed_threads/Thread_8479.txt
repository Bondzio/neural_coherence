<s> When more and more games that are featuring DX 10 become available, will this render the DX 9 cards totally useless? </s>
<s> And do you have to have Windows Vista to run DX 10? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> Yes, you guessed it. </s>
<s> DX10 is Vista only. </s>

<s> DX10 is the breaking point to get Vista. </s>
<s> Well, it seems MS wants users to be more Vista ready and pony up the $. </s>
<s> Don't look for DX10 capable games to under XP, unless they provide a solution with their s/w bundle(not likely). </s>
<s> But heck, it still early since Vista was released and all the issues it imposes. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks for the info. </s>
<s> I was planning on upgrading my video card to DX 10 to play &quot;World in Conflict&quot; thats coming out in September. </s>
<s> No way I'm gonna fork over the cash for a new OS, DX 10 card, power supply, and probably a cooling unit to boot. </s>
<s> There's still a lot of DX 9 games out there to keep me satisfied for awhile. </s>
