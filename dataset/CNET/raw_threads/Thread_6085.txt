I was under the impression that a video card, graphics card, and video adapter card were all the same thing, but now I think I'm wrong. On my PC, whenever I'd run software to detect what video card I had, it would say this - &quot;ATI 3D Rage Pro AGP&quot;. It's been called a video card or a graphics card by different software I use and when listed under my device manager, it's called an adapter card. That's why I thought those were all the same thing. However, I recently purchased software that says I don't have a video card. I checked the requirements and it said I needed a video card that was directx 9.0 compatible and could handle up to 32-bit color and a resolution of 1024x768. As far as I've been able to tell, that 3D Rage Pro meets all those requirements, but I could be wrong. Can someone clear this up for me?

As for the directX thing, Some of the newer graphic cards have directx chips built-in (I think). I don't think rage pro meet that requirement.

Gigabyte, When refering to &quot;graphics controllers&quot; they can come in many flavours, onboard, PCI graphics adapters, AGP graphics adapters, and the new PCI-Express format. All of these are &quot;graphics controllers&quot; The difference and what is confusing you is simply terminology. A graphics &quot;card&quot; is an add on board that fits into pci or agp or pci-e slots that have an onboard video processing unit or &quot;GPU&quot; A video card or video adapter is the same thing really, just different terminology. If a software application states that you must have a directX 9.0 compliant card to play, that card you have will definitely not cut it. Your card is directX 8 compatible. This simply means the GPU chiset is not directX 9.0 compatible. Only the newer cards on the market are &quot;truly&quot; directX 9.0 compatible. The game may still play, but with a degredation in graphics quality. You do have a graphics card, but whether the software application will detect it is another story. Those rage 3D cards are terribly out of date, and it wouldn't much suprise me to see a directx 9.0 game not recognize it. Do you know if the rage card is AGP or PCI?
