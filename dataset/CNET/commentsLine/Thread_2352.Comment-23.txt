i recently had a problem with my monitor as well it is just like all the posts that describe the problem and i did the online help with hp and they basicly said i need to by a new monitor i was not aware of the problem with the 1503 and 1703 until a coworker said somthing to me about how hp replaced his 1703 monitor after he brought it to their attention that he knew that they were having a problem with them.
has there been any results for the 1503 getting replaced or fixed by hp
