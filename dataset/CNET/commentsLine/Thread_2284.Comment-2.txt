flatpanel imac.
i use a 17 inch 2ghz g5 (about two years old) and edit high definition (1080i) video pretty regularly... consider bumping to 2 gig ram.
for your external drive, firewire is better.
a macmini will work - but it would be more like driving a go cart in a formula 1 race... you get there, it will just take longer than a flatpanel ot tower (or laptop).
