i agree with robert, on many a cd/dvd drive issue when they don't burn/r/w in some fashion.
my question is, &quot;why did you update the firmware in the 1st place&quot;?
if it was to correct this problem or did you do it because it was there?
if it ain't broke, don't fix it, is a highly wise decision for repair people.
in my experience as well, it's far simpler and quicker to replace the problem drive with new or *known* good one in order to proceed.
the time and effort spend becomes practical then.
understand wera&tear on drives become evident when used over a yr. or alot and newer drives aren't made as good as they used to, simply cheaper.
as noted the media itself if using some off brand bulk can be very unforgiving.
