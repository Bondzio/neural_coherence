<s> I have an eMachines T3522. </s>
<s> It's horrible, I know. </s>
<s> So, why not upgrade? </s>
<s> My essential question is: &quot;What is the best way to maximize performance (on high settings, preferably) in World of Warcraft with this computer on a 22-inch monitor at full (1680x1050) resolution?&quot; I believe the computer has a power supply of only 300W. </s>
<s> Here are the rest of the specs: - 1GB DDR2 (?) </s>
<s> RAM - Integrated graphics (woohoo!) </s>
<s> - 3.33 GHz Intel Celeron CPU - 1 PCI-e x1 slot - 1 PCI-e x16 slot - Windows XP I need to play at full resolution. </s>
<s> I can't stand it otherwise. </s>
<s> Also, I'd like to bump up my settings. </s>
<s> I'm currently on lowest, and the game looks much worse than if it were at higher settings. </s>
<s> Even at lowest, I'm &quot;cranking&quot; out no more than 20 FPS (ever), mostly hovering around (and below) 10 FPS. </s>
<s> With a 300W power supply, how much can my computer take? </s>
<s> I looked at the NVIDIA GeForce 9400 GT, which is the most powerful card (to my knowledge) that my computer can support. </s>
<s> All the other cards are above 300W. </s>
<s> To be honest, I'm not exactly sure about this power issue. </s>
<s> What else would I be able to throw into my computer before it is overloaded? </s>
<s> I'm open to all suggestions. </s>
<s> I have $150 to spend. </s>
<s> Go. </s>
<s> Firstly the processor does not lend itself to being much for gaming. </s>
<s> By the time you get done doing any upgrades to that system, you may as well have purchased (or built) another system with better capabilities. </s>
<s> All I would do would be to pump up the memory and install a video card, of course if you could find a more substantial PSU that would be a plus. </s>
<s> But the Celeron processors are noted for being wobbly when it comes to anything tricky. </s>
<s> Shop around, you may be able to do your component upgrades for close to your 150.00 budget. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> get a new power supply then come back to us </s>
<s> Sorry, you need a new computer, unless you want to get rid of your processor, first post it right, that chip is garbage to be honest, and if you get a new chip, video card, and PSU, then you may as well buy a whole new computer, if thats what you do, BUILD YOUR OWN. </s>
<s> Find a custom build shop in your area, and they will assemble and install O.S. </s>
<s> for you if you don't know how. </s>
