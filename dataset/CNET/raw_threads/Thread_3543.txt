So obviously, it will be running while I sit at home and listen to music. My rocket pod just died, but it was very loud and got louder each day until it croaked. For my next drive, I want to find the quietest, sexiest external drive on the market. 250GB minimum. Western Digital claims whisper quiet. Do they back it up with a quality product? DOES ANYONE HAVE A STRONG OPINION? IS THERE A DRIVE THAT IS CONSIDERED THE ABSOLUTE BEST??
