I have a 5 year old sound card that has started to give me issues when it is in my computer.
Its a sound blaster audigy 1.
I am running vista 32 bit home premium and whenever I try to use this card windows locks up and gives me a blue screen.
Does this sound like a driver issue or maybe the card is going bad?
