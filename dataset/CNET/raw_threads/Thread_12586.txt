Hi, I recently deleted an autorun.inf, and some other worm-like files from my 500gb Western Digital &quot;My Book&quot;. I noticed the mystery files when my permissions would not allow me to write to this usb drive. At the time, I tried to create a folder on my external hard drive and save data in this newly created folder. The write failed and consequently I was unable to delete the folder I just created. Then I deleted autorun.inf. I also have a &quot;System Volume Information&quot; folder and several sub-folders which I cannot delete. QUESTION: How can I clean up this external hard drive so it acts normally long enough for me to get my data off this drive? Currently, my system recognizes the drive, but will not let me open it to see the folders or files. It also seems like my read/write permissions are still screwy... Thanks, for anything... btw, I'm running Windows XP Pro on a MacBook, using Parallels. When I mount the external hard drive on the Mac OSX v10.5.6, it opens, I see the folders, but many of the files are not accessible. It also looks like some of the data within some folders has been deleted This is driving me crazy, hopefully someone can help? _____ Windows XP Professional external 500gb Western Digital &quot;My Book&quot;

At best we hope we save the owners files, reload the OS then restore their files. Someday we hope for better. It seems odd you would attempt to delete the System Volume Information folder. It's part of this OS. Bob
