Internal notebook wireless	Which is better or is it simply a matter of preference, a wireless usb adpator or an internal wireles card? I'm thinking of linking my notebook from work to my home wireless notework. Any opinions. Thanks.

PCMCIAs Tend to have better performance, and are usually More Expensive... if you haven't Bought a Router/Card yet, I suggest Getting Same Brand name (Even though it won't matter) It will help if you have to call for support.

I already have a Motorola Wireless router in the house (model WR850G). That's about all I know about the router, and I had planned to just buy a 54Mb PCMCIA card at Walmart for about $35.00. I wonder if I would be better off with the 108Mb card, or if with my router, I should just stick with the 54Mb card. I don't want to spend a lot of money, especially since I'm putting this in a computer owned by my employer. Thanks again. jdi

You also need to be in fairly close proximity to the router. I took a look at the specifications for your router, and it looks to be a standard wireless-g router (up to 54Mbps). An enhanced wireless-g network adapter will work with the router, but its connection speed will be limited to 54Mbps. If you had a MIMO router, you would see a range and speed boost with either the standard or enhanced wireless-g adapter.
10118	7	149512	1669308	1669032	linkit	1/13/06 5:10 PM	1.1371722E12	terminology	PCMCIA card = PC Card While ''PCMCIA'' is really the name of the standards organization that governs such card technology, many manufacturers and retailers use that name instead of the more proper ''PC-Card.'' As for for PC Card vs USB wireless adapter? I see it as more of a convenience issue. Using a PC card in a notebook frees the USB 2.0 ports for other uses; however, a USB 2.0 adapter can later be used on a desktop if the need arises. I have used both kinds. These days, I just get the inexpensive wireless-g USB 2.0 adapter and have no regrets.
