hello, i installed a couple of pci 2.2 compliant devices (adsl modem and ethernet adapter) on my old win95 pc and i can't make them work.
i'm sure drivers are right for my os, so i think it's because my pci slots are 2.1 compliant.
now, i'm looking for a bios upgrade.
here are informations about my mobo and bios bios type: award bios date: 01/16/98 bios id string: 01/16/98-i430tx-ali5135-2a59itjac oem signon: it-586tx1 ver:1.31n fighter tx italiana technologie chipset: intel triton 430tx rev 1 super i/o: ali m5133 rev 0 found at port 3f0h i know my mobo was produced by totem but their website (  ) is no more online.
so i asked a bios upgrade to esupport.com (  ) and they told me they have the right one for $24.95.
could any of you please answer my questions: - will the bios upgrade make my pci 2.2 devices work with my mobo?
- have i any other way to get the right bios upgrade without paying money for it?
thanks in advance andrea
