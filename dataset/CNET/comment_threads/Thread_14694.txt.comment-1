I am looking for a recommendation for a PCI express or PCI x SATA Raid controller card for a nonprofit group I am helping.
The received a brand new server but it only came with one 73GB SCSI drive.
We want to run RAID 1 and need at least 160 GB drives for storage/OS.
I figured we could add in a SATA controller card and get the drives for the price on one high capacity SCSI drive.
So does anyone have a recommendation for a card/drive combination that is relatively fast but also affordable (around $400 or $500).
Is having cache on the card really important?
Thanks in advance.
