I disconnected my primay drive because I did not want to make any mistakes. When I run fdisk I get these questions asking if I want to enable large disk support. I chose yes. But after that It just goes to a black screen with the line just blinking. Is something wrong with the disk or should I just be more patient.

I won't teach how to use FDISK since we have web content and it's been around for a few decades. But it is a rather old program and doesn't work with misconfigured machines. Even if you did that on purpose. Bob

Start, Settings, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Computer Management, Disk Management, Your system is probably hanging 'cause it's jumpered as SL and there's no MA. VAPCMD
