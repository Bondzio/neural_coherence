That blue screens don't mean there is a hardware issue.
Same for wake up issues.
Windows is still easy to damage in what some won't think that would cause any issue.
For example, those registry cleaners, installing more than one antivirus or let's not discount how much malware is out there.
Given the problems the only thing a maker can do is reload the machine if the owner can't or won't.
