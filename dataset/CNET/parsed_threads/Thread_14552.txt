<s> Good Day, I am building a new PC and I purchased an AOC LM760 LCD 17&quot; LCD. </s>
<s> However it has a D-sub connector only and my Video Card has both VGA and DVI-I connector. </s>
<s> The package contains a DVI to VGA adapter. </s>
<s> My question is will my LCD show an improvement once I have used the adapter to the DVI-I rather than the VGA connector. </s>
<s> I know that some LCD's do the conversion from analog to digital within their electronics, however in this case will the LCD know that it is a digital input it is connecting to or will try to use the analog circuitry. </s>
<s> Will I see a difference. </s>
<s> the lcd will probably auto-switch to the proper input. </s>
<s> if not, enter the menu and manually aim at the appropriate input. </s>
<s> as soon as i hit submit, i finally understood your question. </s>
<s> you shouldn't see any improvement using the dvi connector with a dvi-vga adapter, so just plug the monitor directly into the vga (analog) output. </s>
