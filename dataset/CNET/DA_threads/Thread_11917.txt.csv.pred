1.1.1	I recently had my MacPro upgraded with the Airport Extreme N chip.	St
1.1.2	When I purchased the system I chose not to get it because I never envisioned using it on a desktop.	St
1.1.3	However, I recently relocated and the condo construction and location of the cable feed prevented me from using Ethernet as my connection.	St
1.1.4	The strength of the signal is only 1/2 of the one I get with my MacBook Pro.	St
1.1.5	Also, while the MacBook Pro remembers my network and automatically connects to it when I turn it on, the MacPro does not and I must either leave it in Sleep mode or enter all of the parameters for my wireless security each time I turn it on.	St
1.1.6	I use WPA2 and AES on a DLink DIR-655 Wireless N Router.	St
1.1.7	I have the SSID set to not broadcast.	St
1.1.8	While I was thinking that might be the problem, I don't understand why it would work on the laptop and not the desktop.	St
1.1.9	They are both running the latest version of Mac OS/X Leopard.	St
1.1.10	Any ideas or suggestions would be appreciated.	St
1.1.11	Thank you.	St
1.2.1	Use the settings we have found to work best in our Networking forum.	St
1.2.2	It's in that forum's tip or sticky at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7589_102-0.html?forumID=62&threadID=264135&messageID=2584349 As to signal strength, I'm still unsure how to tell owners that the number of bars or percent is not calibrated from machine to machine or such.	St
1.2.3	How would you tell them that?	St
1.2.4	It's a dead end to look too close at that.	St
1.2.5	As to working here and not there, etc.	St
1.2.6	You are not set up with the settings we have found to work well, be secure and not cause trouble.	St
1.2.7	Good luck, Bob	St
