<s> Currently on a Pre-N Wireless Small Home-Office Network, running WindowsXP SP2, HP psc 2410c printer, Dell notebook thanks. </s>
<s> Several people make them, D-Link, Linksys etc. </s>
<s> you'll have to check compatibility with each of them but don't expect anything other than the printer to work. </s>
<s> Most will not support the rest of the fuctionality of the MFC. </s>
<s> I am awaiting a new Brother MFC-420CN which has built in eithernet. </s>
<s> It was $129 after rebate + a $30 store credit and should support full functionality accross the network. </s>
<s> The print servers I looked at were all sort of around $80. </s>
<s> I'll have to report back after I get it set up. </s>
<s> All will turn the PSC into a printer... Bob </s>
