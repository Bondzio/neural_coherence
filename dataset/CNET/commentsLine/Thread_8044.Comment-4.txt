yes i just read your posting on the blitzz wireless router and was just needing the exact same thing that you were needing in your posting?
i recently moved and i was living with roomates and for some reason unknown to me during my stay in this roommate situation one of my roommates or their friends decided that they needed the driver disc for this router more than i needed it???
so now i have moved out and to a new place and have no drivers and i have a new computer i am wanting to install this router on as well.
the model number of the blitzz wireless super g router i have is bwa 711 but i might think that some of these routers will work using the same drivers??
so if you dont mind can you tell me what you used to install yours??
and if you could email me the file to jwvinson2000@yahoo.com it would be greatly appreciated and if you live anywhere near houston texas i would be glad to buy you a drink or dinner or gift certificate or what ever you choose for helping me out??
thanks jay
