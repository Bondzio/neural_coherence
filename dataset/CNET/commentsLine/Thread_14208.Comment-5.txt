i don't care about price, as most gamers are, since i have $488 in the bank and little more during the holidays, and plus, i want to run both fsx and call of duty 4 with slightly more than decent frame rates on high settings at 1024x768 or 1280x1024 (depending if i can afford a 19' lcd), and im also a evga fan (from last year)\nvidia fan (from 2003\2004)
