im using windows xp.
i replaced a motherboard from an hp computer model # m7640n with an msi 785gt-e63 model # ms-7551 and i am wondering what programs are necessary to run.
i am at 50 processes right now and the cpu usage keeps going up and down a lot ( i do not have a virus ).
the computer is mainly used to play world of warcraft.
please help me
