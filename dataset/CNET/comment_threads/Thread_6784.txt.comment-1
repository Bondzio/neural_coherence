I'm running a wireless network for 3 computers (2 XP and one Me) and all 3 computers are able to access the internet via the wireless router.
However, I haven't been able to setup a working home network for sharing files, etc.
I've made several attempts to use the MS XP software (Setup home or office network) to setup a network without success.
I wondering if anyone can recommend a reasonable software package that would support XP and ME in setting up a home network.
I DON'T want to upgrade the ME computer to XP because of hardware issues.
