i concur with ikjadoon.
if you can wait 9-months to a year, and are interested in buying an amd system (which is generally faster, cheaper, but only from much less common vendors) with microsoft windows vista installed as the os, then you should definitely wait.
new graphics cards are coming every couple of months, so there is that plus to waiting.
the only really good reason not to wait would be if you don't care about amd or windows, or if you need a new pc immediately.
if your desire to upgrade is only to play better games, then i would counsel waiting 9 months - year.
there may be some good new games developed for vista when it comes out at end of year, another plus.
