I thought it was the Power Supply at first but didnt think it would have an effect on my Bios Settings, but I will try that first If I do change the MB how do I delete the current MB drivers such as the 4 in 1 drivers so that I can install the new MB drivers, I am looking at a different brand of motherboard.
