4442	3	284542	2708446	2708322	bob b	2/19/08 8:13 AM	1.20340878E12	Question.	Will the user's 4x slot be a limiter? Will going too far up scale be a waste as the slot can not feed the card?

4442	5	284542	2708894	2708444	kovans	2/19/08 5:45 PM	1.2034431E12	decided	ive decided on the 2600xt b/c it only needs 300 watt psu and the 7800 needs 400 so i think the 2600 is a better idea or way to go thx for the help guys ill be back soon with another question
