I am planning on building a PC for 3 reasons: cost effective, experience, fun!
The computer should be able to handle HD video and multitasking, no gaming, maybe some video editing, and I want something the will not be obsolete in at least 7 years.
Here are links to components I have selected: Case- http://tinyurl.com/43pfv5f CPU- http://tinyurl.com/3k75fsk Motherboard- http://tinyurl.com/3t9glpr Graphics Card- http://tinyurl.com/3ttpurj Power Supply- http://tinyurl.com/3wuw64n Heatsink- http://tinyurl.com/3zuwjgc Any suggestions?
What kind of optical drive should I get?
What can I do to save money?
How much RAM and HDD do I need?
Any compatibility issues?
Thanks for your time!
