It's my understanding that a particular 802.11 standard may include a lot of features, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they all are implemented in every wireless device.
An example: If I implement WPA encryption on my wireless router and my wireless network adapter in my computer only supports WEP, then I can't connect.
Unfortunately, some adapters don't have firmware updates that add newer abilities, such as WPA or WPA2.
