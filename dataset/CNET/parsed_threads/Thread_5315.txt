<s> I need a computer for mostly word processing and web browsing. </s>
<s> I'm considering getting a netbook and docking it to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse so when I do need to carry my computer, it's not a problem. </s>
<s> My concern is the computer performance. </s>
<s> Do netbooks get slow after some time? </s>
<s> It's a run of the mill 8.9 inch unit. </s>
<s> Be aware that Windows seems to slow over time so it's not a Netbook issue. </s>
<s> A netbook with Windows 7 would fit your needs quite well. </s>
<s> I would highly recommend getting a full size keyboard as you seem to have planned on. </s>
<s> Small Keyboards= pain to type on for long periods of time. </s>
<s> Also, if you are mostly working with Word like documents, it is easy to just save them online. </s>
<s> This also makes it easier to reformat should you notice any slow downs. </s>
<s> there is no reason any computer should slow after time if it is maintained correctly. </s>
