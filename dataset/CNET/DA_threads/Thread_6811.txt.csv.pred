1.1.1	Hello everyone, I have a Sony Vaio F Series laptop (Model VPCF111FD/B) which runs Windows 7 and came with a Wireless N network adapter, Atheros AR9287.	St
1.1.2	I also purchased a TRENDnet 652 Wireless N router, for my home network.	St
1.1.3	When I look at my Wireless Connection Status, it has always shown my Speed as 54.0 Mbps.	St
1.1.4	I thought this was the speed of Wireless G?	St
1.1.5	Does anyone know how I may troubleshoot the network adapter or router to figure out why I am not connecting at Wireless N speeds?	St
1.1.6	I have ruled at range as an issue, and I believe my drivers are the most current.	St
1.1.7	I don't know what to check from here.	St
1.1.8	Any ideas?	St
1.2.1	Look at the router setup, specifically the 802.11 mode, or something similar.	St
1.2.2	Most routers are selectable for the specific mode, B, G, or N.	St
