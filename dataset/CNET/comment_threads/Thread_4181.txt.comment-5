It is supported.
XP 2800+ 333 is supported and even 3000+ 333 is.
And if I set the board to 5:1 I can use 133 ran and 333 cpu.
Or I can set both cpu and ram to 133.
I just don't want to buy new ram since I already have 1gb.
So I guess I'll just try it and see how it goes.
Now I just need a new fan capable of supporting a 2800+ Socket a. ivnj
