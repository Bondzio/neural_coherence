i can't pick between the d-link di-624 and the linksys wrt54gs for my wireless router....laptop magizine rates the d-link as the top performer out of the wireless routers they tested....however i have my wired network on linksys parts and have liked their service and support.... *question is*: would it be better to go with d-link, on its performance rating, then hook up the computers with matching d-link or other company adpaters *or* go with linksys and matching linksys adpaters making the network on all one company's product, hoping to gain performance this way?
thanks for the advice
