Ok I have an ABS system full of spyware.
I don't know how, but it recenty got messed up with the BIOS, etc.
Ok I want to reformat the whole thing, start all over again with the hard drives.
I do have a full version of the Windows OS.
I inserted that in the PC, but I can't boot the system.
It tells me to insert a floppy as the boot disk.
I want to insert a cd, and the floopy won't work.
How do I set the BIOS to read the CD.
I have never touched or played with the bios before, so what do I do?
