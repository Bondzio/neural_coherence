you never revealed the use for this pad.
i'm watching folk rush in and learn the lessons the hard way about apps and more.
if you are jazzed about all this, don't buy until you can get past the jazz.
as to your comment about if this will bring out this or that, let me comment about ice cream.
some folk are waiting for that but developers i know won't use its new features because most folk are not that yet.
they seem to be in agreement that in 6 months or a year they might have an ice cream feature app.
