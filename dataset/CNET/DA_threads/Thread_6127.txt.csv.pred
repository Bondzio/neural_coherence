1.1.2	I reset the bios and originally the core clock started up at 2.66Ghz like its supposed to.	St
1.1.3	But all of a sudden when i check my temps and clock speeds, it says that its running at 2.0Ghz flat.	St
1.1.4	But when I go into my BIOS before my PC starts, it goes back to regular 2.66.	St
1.1.5	I just cant figure out why its underclocking itself.	St
1.1.6	Also, I know its not a heating problem, it runs at 42C Regularly after being on for a while.	St
1.1.7	Help me?!	St
