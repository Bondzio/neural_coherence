i formatted the drive in my sons's gateway laptop after backing up all data.
after installing xp pro and office 2003 and running all updates i discovered the same wavy screen.
the device manager showed the vga graphics drivers missing.
the correct driver would not download to this workstation.
i downloaded and transferred across the network.
the file extracted.
i then pointed the driver reinstall to the cab files for this download and it installed falwlessly.
no more wavy screen and the device mgr shows the drivers to be intact.
he also runs a second monitor (crt flat screen)and it works fine.
one neat trick is if you do not want the laptop monitor on, crank up the resolution where the laptop monitor cannot perform and it will shutdown.
now you can use only the crt external if need be.
