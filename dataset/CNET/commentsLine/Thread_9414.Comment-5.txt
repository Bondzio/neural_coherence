just as you want to sync the laptop and acer.
premise1: your laptop has a wsxga+ (1680x1050) native display.
not just windows setting at 1680x1050 but the panel itself has that native res.
premise2: &quot;using only the auxiliary monitor&quot; - means you toggled the display output to only the acer so that laptop display is extinguished.
not just closing the laptop lid.
premise3: you set the windows res of laptop at 1680x1050 @ 60 hz and you set the windows external res at 1680x1050 @ 60 hz.
not different refresh rates.
premise4: acer is hooked up to laptop's vga port directly.
not thru some kvm.
and you still have the problem?
