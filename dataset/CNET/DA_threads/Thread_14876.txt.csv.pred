1.1.1	hi, i am in the process of moving my PC's components from an old case to an antec p180.	St
1.1.2	The problem I'm having is that after hooking everything up as described, I can't turn the system on.	St
1.1.3	Strangely, the power supply is whirring away like it's on, but there is no power going to the machine to turn it on.	St
1.1.4	I tried pressing the front power/ reset buttons on the case and they do nothing.	St
1.1.5	The noise and no response got me worried; I was afraid I may have bricked my PC, so I moved everything back to the old case and turned it on and it was all working fine, no harm seems to have been done.	St
1.1.6	So, could the problem be the antec p180's front bezel connectors are defective?	St
1.1.7	Everythng works when connected to the old case, technically all I'm doing is moving my components to the antec so the case must be the cause, and the only impact the antec has on the operation of the PC really are just those front bezel connectors.	St
1.1.8	Sorry if this doesn't make sense, it's a bit hard to explain.	St
1.2.1	Check that you don't have extra motherboard standoffs in the new case.	St
1.2.2	That will cause an electrical short in your motherboard.	St
1.3.1	no there are no extra standoffs or anything like that lying about.	St
1.3.2	I was also very careful when setting everything up, i didn't directly touch any connectors or anything like that.	St
1.4.1	hi, i was wrong i did have an extra standoff in the case, under the mobo, it was the only one.	St
1.4.2	However it was positioned under a screw hole and I had used it, without noticing it was there.	St
1.4.3	It's possible this standoff came from the old case and was still attached to a screw while moving the mobo from the old case to the new case, this could have put the mobo at a slight angle in the new case.	St
1.4.4	Could this have caused the problem?	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	I had a similiar problem last week.	St
1.6.2	I moved my working components from an old case to a new Antec P180 and it would not boot the system.	St
1.6.3	I spent a week trying to solve this mess!	St
1.6.4	The power supply was working, the fans worked and the light on the motherboard was lit.	St
1.6.5	The reset button on the case did not work, but the power button worked.	St
1.6.6	I went crazy testing all my components and they were fine.	St
1.6.7	Then I reinstalled everything back into the old case and it worked.	St
1.6.8	I returned the defective case and got a new one that works just fine.	St
1.6.9	The wiring in the case was obviously bad.	St
1.6.10	Return your defective case.	St
1.6.11	After solving the problem I am very happy with my P180.	St
1.7.1	return to new case and verify any/all standoffs for mtrbd.	St
1.7.2	are proper if/not used.	St
1.7.3	No frt.	St
1.7.4	panel connections need be made at first other than power-ON.	St
1.7.5	If all that works, you can then add connections, just be sure of location, etc.. Further above all else, verify the 115v/230v sw. on psu is in proper volatage selection(yeah, it happens).	St
1.7.6	tada -----Willy	St
