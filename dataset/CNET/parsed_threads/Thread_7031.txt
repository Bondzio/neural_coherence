<s> I recently purchased the microsoft wireless desktop set. </s>
<s> Wireless Comfort Edition Wireless comfort keyboard 1.0 Wireless optical mouse 2.0 The keyboard has been excellent. </s>
<s> The mouse on the other hand is a different tail. </s>
<s> I have updated the mouse drivers. </s>
<s> I have also Tried to contact microsoft both via phone and email with no help. </s>
<s> The email did not work because they don't have my model on the hardware list? </s>
<s> Strange but okay. </s>
<s> The left click works when it wants. </s>
<s> I have tested the right click and mouse movement with no problems. </s>
<s> The left click will work after about three times of pressing it. </s>
<s> What I want to know is anybody else encountering this problem with any of the new wireless mice available from microsoft or did I get a bad pick. </s>
<s> Sounds like you have a bad mouse. </s>
<s> Microsoft keyboards and mice most always work well with a Microsoft OS. </s>
<s> Check Device Manager and see what it says your mouse is. </s>
<s> Also, check to see if you have other mouse drivers loaded on your computer, if you do remove them. </s>
<s> I did check that but after careful review to the problem I found out my wireless routor's signals were the actual problem. </s>
<s> Interference. </s>
<s> Could not beleive it funny huh? </s>
<s> thanx again. </s>
