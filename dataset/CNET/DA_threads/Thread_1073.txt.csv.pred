1.1.1	I 'm going off to college in the fall and I need to get myself a good MFC ( All-in-one ) .	St
1.1.2	I would kind of like to stay away from HP because of all the crapware that comes bundled with their printer drivers .	St
1.1.3	I 'm a little afraid to get a printer at all because of some of the reviews I 've seen .	St
1.1.4	I would like to be able to print good-quality photos and good-quality text , which it seems are rarely found together in a printer these days .	St
1.1.5	A balance of quality and price is really what I 'm looking for .	St
1.1.6	If anyone can aid me in my search , that would be great .	Polite
1.1.7	Thanks for any help , drummerboy	Polite
1.2.1	Sorry , but I have n't noticed such .	St
1.2.2	Do you mean that thing that offers to sell you ink when low ?	Ques
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	The HP software is just unnecessarily bulky .	St
1.3.2	It slows system performance by loading a whole bunch of unnecessary apps into system memory and going in and cleaning that up is not something I 'm interested in doing .	St
1.3.3	The install for one of the HP printers I have was about 700mb .	St
1.3.4	What in the world do I need 550mb of printer drivers/utilities for ?	Ques
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	And not so much on the install .	St
1.5.2	The units work just fine here and I opted out of the paint and other applications .	St
1.5.3	I do run into people that are aghast at & quot ; code bloat & quot ; but at the risk of igniting someone like that I have to write & quot ; get used to it. & quot ; Here 's an article why this is happening in Windows .	St
1.5.4	http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk : Software_bloat If you are looking to escape from bloat , jump out of Windows .	St
1.5.5	Bob	St
1.6.1	If you need one that does text along with a decent job on the photos , look at the iP4300 printer or the MP530 AIO or MP600 if you do n't need the fax .	St
1.6.2	Individual cartridges , small droplet size , fast print , plus duplexing .	St
1.7.1	Its a shame that there 's a bunch of s/w loaded when you install a new printer , but that 's the way it is .	St
1.7.2	Understand , that all such s/w can provide function for tasks you *may* want of the m/f printer as times goes on .	St
1.7.3	You of course can ( if applicable ) de-install or reduce some functions .	St
1.7.4	Those functions are to email any pictures , fax s/w , OCR s/w for scanning , and s/w for cropping & manupitation before printing , plus monitor s/w for ink levels and not to forget the drivers of the OS being used .	St
1.7.5	There should also some management of any pictures and/or copied documents , etc.. Hope this helps in your quest .	St
1.7.6	May i suggest you look into the new Kodak 5xxx series of printers which offer reduced costs of ink , plus offer more permanent inks than usually provided from other vendors .	St
1.7.7	Check out ther support website .	St
1.7.8	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.8.1	I know what you mean !	St
1.8.2	I have an HP all in one , there is a boatload of crap on the disc .	St
1.8.3	Try going to the HP support site and finding just the latest driver and download/install and do n't run the disc ; this will give you the minimum .	St
