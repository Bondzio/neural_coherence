Thing is, i'm not really sure whether the card would be able to fit into my case as the heatsink is kinda big. please advice thanks in advance

And unless somebody answers who owns what you have, has already added the GPU in question and reads this message answers ....you're research and calculations will be as good as any. My recommendation ... measure the space inside the case, compare it to the dimensions (length, height and width) of specific units (GPUs) now available, check the PSU requirement (your current PSU may be inadequate) and make your decision.
