Why must it be exactly 9 or 10 dB?
Something is not being told here.
If that performance is that important wouldn't we get out our RF NETWORK ANALYZER (see http://www.testequity.com/products/960/ ) and test this setup?
Tipping my hand here.
I wrote software for antenna testing years ago and used this and other gear to test these things.
But at 10 bucks this is something you should just get and try.
It's cheaper than time in the lab.
