your prior post did indicate you didn't follow my suggestions.
but it doesn't matter.
i also noted that hp often has a &quot;cleaner&quot; software to remove the traces of the scanner software so you can start over.
i leave it to you to find it.
just fyi, again, this is just someone thats done this many times and doesn't get a dime for offering direction to the issue.
sorry, no step by step.
