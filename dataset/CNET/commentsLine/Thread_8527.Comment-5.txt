&quot;i put the same jump drive back in the same usb slot or even a diff.
usb slot and it just hangs or i get device not recognized.&quot; i just helped someone cure that in this xp forum discussion.
read  but for the 875p i'd use intel.com's offerings such as:  item 1 is dated 11/21/2006 plus there may be some dell bios update that addresses the issue.
-&gt; one last thing is that bum usb devices can hang windows.
i have no cure for that one but to test the usb drive on the rear usb ports and on another machine.
