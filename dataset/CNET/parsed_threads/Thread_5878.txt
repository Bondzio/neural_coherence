<s> I have recently changed ISPs because my kids said our connection was too slow. </s>
<s> I proved to them that the old connection we had was faster...by three times. </s>
<s> However, their &quot;ultimate test&quot; is downloading maps for Starcraft. </s>
<s> When I connect to my DSL modem directly (Ethernet Cable) everything is great...the maps download in a second or two. </s>
<s> When I go through our Belkin Wireless Pre-N router, it can take a minute, if we're not booted off. </s>
<s> My kids say the same problem exists when they play XBox 360 online...a latency issue which allows them to be killed because of a delay in the connection. </s>
<s> DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT I'M TALKIN ABOUT HERE? </s>
<s> Even if I connect to the Belkin via Ethernet cable (not directly to the DSL modem), I still have the latency issue. </s>
<s> So, the Belkin Wireless Pre-N router is the issue. </s>
<s> How can I configure the Belkin Wireless Pre-N router so we can get the through-put as if we were connected via hardwire? </s>
<s> &quot;How can I configure the Belkin Wireless Pre-N router so we can get the through-put as if we were connected via hardwire?&quot; This is not possible since the AIR WAVES are shared space so interfering signals from other networks, cordless phones and more can ... interfere. </s>
<s> Sadly many tech support people won't explain this to the buyers. </s>
<s> If lag time and more is that important, get wired. </s>
<s> And for gaming you still want to turn off the wifi and maybe forget sharing the connection on the router for best effect. </s>
