I have a P4 2.8 gh, 1 gb RAM, and a FX 5700 LE 128MB video card. I might need to upgrade my power supply to accomidate the new card. I do not know the wattage rating of it. I have a AGP slot. My current choices are: A Diablotek GeForce 6600 LE/256MB DDR for $95 from Tiger Direct, a Diamond Radeon X1300 / 512MB DDR2 for $130 also from Tiger Direct, and these Newegg cards: An Apollo 6800 Geforce 6800 128MB 256-bit DDR for $130, an ASUS 512MB Geforce 6800 128-bit GDDR2 for $180, A BFG Tech Geforce 6800GS 256MB 256-bit GDDR3 for $200, A DIAMOND Radeon X1300 512MB 128-bit GDDR2 for $114, A eVGA Geforce 6600 256MB 128-bit DDR for $100, eVGA Geforce 7800GS CO 256MB 256-bit GDDR3 for $270, and a PNY Geforce 6600 256MB 128-bit DDR for $112. I would prefer to stay below $200, around $150ish. I want to be able to play Oblivion at decent settings on a 17&quot; moniter, and some other games like it. Any other video cards that I have not listed here that you recomend would be fine as well. Thanks!

I got the BFG 256 6800 GT AGP in January, which replaced the XFX 256 5700 LE. A week or two latter the 7800 AGP cards came out. I am not planning to upgrade the video card any more. as far as my mobo is concerned it is maxed with the bigest Socket A CPU AMD XP 3200 you can put in it & 2 gigs of PC3200 memory duel channel. Power Supply Thermaltake 680. Get a bigger power supply. I would say get one of the 7800 AGP cards. the specs on them are realy nice. (That is just my opion) Good Luck: Wendell H

I know that most people with newer computers have the ability to use the PCI-e cards, but for those of us with older, can't afford either new computer or new mobo/chip and have the AGP slot, there is still a market. It may be smaller, but it exists. My older Althon XP 1800+ uses AGP. Do I want to upgrade my mobo, etc.? You bet. Can I afford to upgrade? No way, not this year at least. I recently bought from newegg an eVGA FX5500 256mb 128-bit AGP card for under $50. Notwithstanding that I am having weird problems with errors and freezes (could be the driver?), I'm getting a beautiful clear screen for general use.

In general, it's not that one shouln't get an AGP card for an older system. It's that investing so much (about $300 for the 7800GS) on an AGP video card is not advisable. If you get a new system, which gamers tend to do more frequently than gereral purpose users, then you can't transfer your $300 investment to the new computer's PCI-Express X16 slot. IMO, a big waste of money.

My system has been glitching a lot, and I am thinking of getting a new one. That way, I won't have to waste that money that would go toword a new system. Thanks for the advice!
