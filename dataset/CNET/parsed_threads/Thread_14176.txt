<s> Problem with Epson 4490 Scanner & Vista : I just reinstalled Vista Business on my Dell Vostro 420 desktop computer to clear up some nagging software/hardware glitches. </s>
<s> [Dell Support suggested and walked me through the process.] </s>
<s> The Epson Perfection 4490 Photo Scanner worked fine on my Dell Latitude D820 laptop (using Windows XP Professional). </s>
<s> It even worked on the Vostro that originally came with Vista Business installed. </s>
<s> After the Vista reinstall, I reinstalled the Epson and the system crashed soon after, came back with a lengthy Microsoft error message about a USB driver problem, and offered corrective suggestions. </s>
<s> One of these was to disconnect any recently installed USB device(s). </s>
<s> I unplugged the USB, while leaving the Epson program files installed. </s>
<s> End of USB driver problem. </s>
<s> So it seems I need to download new driver(s) for using the Epson 4490 with Vista Yes? </s>
<s> Whats the step-by-step procedure here please? </s>
<s> Do I leave (1) the Epson program files installed, (2) download the latest driver(s) from Epson, (3) reconnect the Epson USB cable, and (4) reboot? </s>
<s> Or do I uninstall everything Epson 4490 first and start for scratch? </s>
<s> If so, at one point do the new drivers come into play? </s>
<s> Sorry but Ive never had to update XP Pro-era hardware (or software) with updated drivers for a new operating system. </s>
<s> BTW, Ive also heard that Epsons 4490 drivers can be problematic with Vista i.e. </s>
<s> they dont always work. </s>

<s> Thanks, shamrock838 </s>
<s> Installing Windows (all versions) is a long painful hunt for drivers for the machine and all accessories. </s>
<s> There is NEVER a step by step procedure for each machine from what I can tell. </s>
<s> Only guides. </s>
<s> And there must be thousands out there making a fine living installing Windows. </s>
<s> What I would do is to recreate the machine just like Dell delivered. </s>
<s> Use dell's restore media and all their CDs supplied or ordered from Dell. </s>
<s> I do know some try the &quot;CLEAN INSTALL&quot; or want that but I find many just get upset over the days and weeks of efforts to do that. </s>

<s> Actually Dell did guide me through the install over the phone and we went through the Dell CD's one at a time. </s>
<s> With the &quot;Drivers and Utilities&quot; CD he followed a set procedure of which drivers to reinstall when. </s>
<s> I'm assuming he knew what he was doing. </s>
<s> So -- per my original post -- where might this leave me re the Epson driver(s) and how to install them? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Repeat what you did last time. </s>
<s> Sadly I see no reason to do it any other way. </s>
<s> If that fails, it's time to decide if a new scanner which you can ask for install support is the cheap exit. </s>
<s> Any shop counter will run more than a replacement scanner. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Since I don't have the lengthy Microsoft error message about a USB driver problem to work with I can not address this here. </s>

<s> Actually, the Vostro desktop came pre-installed with Vista Business from Dell. </s>
<s> I never did the original Vista install, nor would I even have attempted doing so. </s>
<s> At first I was torn between staying with XP Pro and advancing to Vista. </s>
<s> I finally went with new technology rather than old. </s>
<s> Perhaps my last resort should be to contact Epson directly re this matter. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I printed out this Microsofr message that's entitled &quot;Problem Caused by USB Driver.&quot; It's four pages long and I can e-mail a photocopy to you if interested. </s>
<s> Alternately, I did I Print Screen of the first page into a Word .doc file. </s>
<s> If this forum allows attachments, I can send it that way. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Reading http://support.microsoft.com/kb/925528/en-us it appears they still have some bugs to pound out. </s>
<s> That is NOT the only KB article they have on this problem. </s>
<s> Dell and MS however should get you moving. </s>
<s> In closing, be sure to use the rear USB ports if on a desktop machine to avoid another issue. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> My Vostro 420 desktop has (6) rear USB ports and another (4) in the front. </s>
<s> Why are rear ports to be preferred over their front counterparts? </s>
<s> And what if I need additional USB ports? </s>
<s> I've heard conflicting reports about external USB hubs. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Why are rear ports to be preferred over their front counterparts? </s>
<s> It has to do with the wiring used. </s>
<s> For years I've encountered issues with front ports. </s>
<s> To avoid this I use the rear ports when there is trouble. </s>
<s> Sorry but it's late so I'll stop here and not answer why the industry is in a fine mess. </s>
