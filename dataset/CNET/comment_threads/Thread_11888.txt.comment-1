I am running XP Pro with latest updates.
While surfing web today using Firefox 2.0, PC all of a sudden started to reboot and hung up at Dell logo screen and won't go any further.
Tried rebooted numerous times, no POST beeps that indicate any issues.
I can't get to BIOS or boot from diskette or CD.
Any ideas?
Dell xps Pentium III w/512 ram, single hard drive Thanks
