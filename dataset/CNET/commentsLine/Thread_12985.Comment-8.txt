the silicon production capacity of the smaller micron sizes is booked at about 99% capacity for the next year.
larger feature micron is still in the 95 or higher booked capacity.
while this may not seem to mean much to the current discussion, it certainly is impacting being able to get the gigabyte flash parts that would make some interesting &quot;hard&quot; storage in the coming year.
in spite of cost issues, flash drives revel in enviroments that hard disks wilt and fail.
if no one has been watching, the usual 0 to 70c operating range of hard disks is now in the 10 to 50 or 55c area of today's drives.
not that the drives don't work at 60c, but there is no assurance from the vendor it will function for the rated lifespan, if at all.
meanwhile flash components can be found in extended temperature ranges and higher g shock ratings that make this technology a viable substitute.
