okay, one last thing.
on windows xp pro, it still says that this connection is not secure.
is it?
should it still say that?
i went and did an automatic mac address update in the mac filter.
it found the connection on it's own, and added it.
is that how it should have been done?
thanks again.
sorry for all the questions.
