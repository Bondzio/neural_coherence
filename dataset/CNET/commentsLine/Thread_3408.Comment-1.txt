i bought a lg dvdwriter on ebay.
i cannot get this thing to show up on my system at all.
my motherboard is all sata devices so i bought a ide to sata connection and nothing.
so i bought a pci card that has the ide connections on it.
nothing again.
i thought it might be that i needed the drivers but i can't find them anywhere.
lg's website has nothign on it except for tech specs.
