Now I can't do anything with it - I can't even format it and start over again. (There was nothing critical on it at the time.) It was a 2GB Coby. I have a generic computer at home, using Windows XP. I also tried taking the flash drive to work where I have a Dell, also Windows XP. When I check the drive, it says it is functioning correctly. When I try to move info to it, I'm always asked if I want to format it, but then it says formatting not possible. What else do I need to do? Or is it lost forever? Thanks - Mom70x7
