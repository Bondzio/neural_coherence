all pc [ibm compatibles] are.
i was wondering who ibm sold their drives to i couldn't remember whether it was hitachi or fujitsu.
the &quot;star&quot; bit sounds like ibm.
i remember them for the class action suit against them for the poor performance of their 75 gb et al drives.
forgot the model names but it did have star in it.
of course ibm vehemently denied that the drives failed earlier than any other type drives.
but they did sell the business, now the pc's to the chinese.
i hope that your drive is not defective.
i'm eastern time.
ne pa.
