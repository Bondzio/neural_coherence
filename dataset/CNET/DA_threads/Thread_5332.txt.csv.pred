1.1.1	I was at Office Max yesterday and saw two routers on sale.	St
1.1.2	They appeared to be exactly the same router, except that one was &quot;draft&quot; N and the other was just &quot;N&quot;.	St
1.1.3	The draft N was about $20 bucks cheaper.	St
1.1.4	I live far out in the country and the beavers and turkeys out here are of the non laptop carrying types, so I really have no need for security and encryption, but I do have a tremendous need for RANGE.	St
1.1.5	Is there anyhting to fear from the draft N vs. N?	Ques
1.1.6	I think both were Dlink routers.	St
1.2.1	older (less than 6 mo.)	St
1.2.2	technology than &quot;n&quot;.	St
1.2.3	The W3C has a final version of the standard (&quot;n&quot;) but, as of now, has not given it its blessing.	St
1.2.4	It will.	St
1.2.5	and life goes on... Jack	St
1.3.1	Since Wireless N (802.11N) specs have not been finalized, there is no gaurantee 802.11N routers from one company (eg Linksys) would work together problem-free with 802.11N adapters from another company (e.g.	St
1.3.2	Netgear or D-Link).	St
1.3.3	As long as you buy the matched pair (Wireless N Router and Adapter), you should just look for which pair gives you the best range.	St
1.3.4	With unmatched pairs (even within the same brand)you may end up having to run both in basic 802.11G mode.	St
1.3.5	The $20 price difference is nothing compare to the hassles you can get with incompatible router's and adapters when non-final wireless specs are involved.	St
