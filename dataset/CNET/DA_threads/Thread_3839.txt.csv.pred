1.1.1	I recently bought an 80gb Zune .	St
1.1.2	Using my old ipod 's plug that connects the Zune to a TV , I attempted to connect the Zune to a friend 's TV .	St
1.1.3	However , it did not work and I lost ALL of the directional buttons and touch-features on the directional pad .	St
1.1.4	The play/pause and back buttons work fine .	St
1.1.5	HOWEVER , I can not restart it because this involved pressing up on the pad and back , and this is obviously impossible with the pad out of commission .	St
1.1.6	Is there any software I can download to refresh the Zune ?	Ques
1.1.7	Additionally is there any other way to manually reset it ?	Ques
1.1.8	I 've held down the play/pause button many times and the Zune software is up to date .	St
1.2.1	Call it in and see where they want you to send it .	St
1.3.1	If this is a recent purchase , do call the support or repair side of Zune .	St
1.3.2	Pssst ...	St
1.3.3	I would n't mention you used a non-Zune ( non-compatible ) cable with it and the problem appeared .	St
1.3.4	Afterall , I suspect the Zune and iPod cables are different at least *assume* they 're not interchangeable .	St
1.3.5	tada -- -- -Willy	St
