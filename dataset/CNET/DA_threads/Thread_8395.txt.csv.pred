1.1.6	Thanks in advance Pam 50	St
1.2.1	We have a paltry 4 MB ATI RadeonGO card on on DVD rendered box after we tested with some 2 hundred card and found no difference in performance .	St
1.2.2	It seems to be all about the CPU , CPU CACHE and memory speeds .	St
1.2.3	Next in line are hard disk speeds .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Most video editing software is extremely dependent on CPU and RAM .	St
1.3.2	I 'm not sure which way to go on the RAM question - I personally have n't put a lot of stock in RAM speed differences .	St
1.3.3	I use an AMD Athlon 64 CPU and PC 2700 DDR RAM ( 1.5GB ) running Avid Xpress Pro editing software .	St
1.3.4	I have basically no problems with rendering , layers , etc .	St
1.3.5	I also am running ( internal ) ATA/IDE drives and connecting both USB and Firewire external drives .	St
1.3.6	Access of the externals is sometimes a little slow , but not enough to affect the editing performance .	St
1.3.7	The video card requirements depend on the software requirements .	St
1.3.8	For example , Avid - and many other high end programs do n't require more than about a 64MB video card in most cases .	St
1.3.9	I run an NVIDIA 128MB card in my system .	St
1.3.10	I 've been told not to waste my money on a high end/high RAM capacity video card for editing - the current softwares wo n't use most of the onboard video RAM anyway .	St
1.4.1	look here 4 the ram ddr2 is better but the site backs me up .	St
1.4.2	hav fun http : //www.alienware.co.uk/news_pages/news.aspx # DualDDR_0621 btw:4 this site may need to press refresh a couple of times till it is all loaded , also look here for your graphics card question aswell .	St
1.5.1	Pam , Use the faster memory , min 512MB - & gt ; 1 gig better .	St
1.5.2	3.0 Intel P4 800Mhz CPU will have enough power on a dual channel M/B .	St
1.5.3	Visit the Video Guys here http : //www.videoguys.com/system.htm Lots and lots of information on systems and video editing Bill .	St
