when you have an integrated video card, the memory it uses is subtracted from your main memory.
also, the stated amount is the maximum amount that can be reserved for the video part, there is absolutely no way it can be set higher.
the real problem comes when the video circuitry and the cpu have to access the memory.
there is only one data bus.
the video part need absolute priority access to that buss.
that means that, whenever the video part is sending data to the screen or treating it, the cpu just have to wait.
that can reduce your computing performance by up to 80%, maybe more in some extreme cases.
the system you are contemplating is definitively not up to the task when it comes to newer games, and even some older games may not work acceptably.
and, no, 256mb is not exceptional.
unless the system can accept another card, you can't upgrade that kind of card.
those systems often don't have any pcie nor the older agp slot, and may not have a pci slot available to connect a real video card.
if you are mostly into web surfing, emailing, text editing, simple games and other low performance applications, that system is enough.
if you want to do heavier stuff, you'll soon regret that choice.
the other options are: discreet video card and having an actual video card.
the discreet solution is a built-in video card that have it's own ram and internal buss, totally separated from the main ram.
you can't change that &quot;card&quot; as it's a physical part of the motherboard.
then, there is the actual video cards.
both of those solutions don't interfere with the cpu.
as you are on a tight budget, i can suggest you to build your new computer.
that way, you can save by reusing some of your older components, like the case, keyboard, monitor and possibly your disk drives.
