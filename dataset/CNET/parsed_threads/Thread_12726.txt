<s> Hi, I have a Western Digital 120GB 7200RPM Hard Drive 8MB Cache and I am looking to purchase a case for it. </s>
<s> I have absolutely no idea which sort I need or which size. </s>
<s> My hard drive measures 6&quot; by 4&quot;. </s>
<s> Could someone please advise me. </s>
<s> Thank you, Helen </s>
<s> 6&quot; x 4&quot; sounds like a standard 3.5&quot; form factor internal hard drive for a desktop. </s>
<s> To confirm this and other details, please tell us the model number of the hard drive. </s>
<s> Will this be used for a Mac or Windows computer? </s>
<s> I've been doing my PC Parts shopping at http://www.newegg.com .. </s>
<s> Excellent Service..great website..lots of info..great prices.. .. </s>
<s> I think BELKIN makes really great products and I use them.. </s>
<s> So I would suggest you try the BELKIN Ext. </s>
<s> Enclosure.. .. </s>
<s> But recently I came across some discarded HDD's that I wanted to use.. </s>
<s> I purchased from NEW EGG two External Enclosure KITS: ....EXT ENCLO ANYWARE[ME-325U2-SV RTL]....and I'm very surprised at the Excellent Quality for the PRICE.. .. </s>
<s> They loaded easily/did not need the enclosed CD.. </s>
<s> I suggest you have USB 2.0/ Comes w/the CABLE..externally powered by 120vAC. </s>
<s> Thank you so much. </s>
<s> The hard drive is for a PC and the model number is: WD1200JB-00REA0 Thanks. </s>
<s> Helen </s>
<s> Thank you kindly, I will take your advice and purchase a Belkin. </s>
<s> Cheers </s>
<s> I bought it to go into my desktop PC to automatically back up everything I do. </s>
<s> However the person who was going to fit it has a serious drink problem and after 5 months waiting it is still not installed. </s>
<s> I decided to use it as an external hard drive for backing up my data but I have no idea how to do this. </s>
<s> It has been suggested that I use a Belkin, but I think I need more information and help before I go and spend more money. </s>
<s> Any help you can give me will be very much appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> The WD1200JB is an ATA/100 (Ultra ATA) hard drive. </s>
<s> It is a standard 3.5&quot; form factor desktop drive. </s>
<s> What you need is an external enclosure with the following: - a 3.5&quot; external enclosure (not the 2.5&quot; or 1.8&quot; enclosures for notebook drives) - IDE (may be listed as Ultra ATA or ATA/100/133 or UDMA5 or UDMA6) internal interface. </s>
<s> (Not SATA.) </s>
<s> - USB 2.0 external interface (Firewire would be better if using a Mac) - external power supply Alternative: - a 5.25&quot; external enclosure that can fit a 3.5&quot; hard drive Optional, but recommended: - metal case material to dissipate heat better than plastic - external enclosure with fan to better dissipate heat 3.5&quot; external enclosures with internal IDE and external USB 2.0 5.25&quot; external enclosures with internal IDE, external USB 2.0, and fan (For these, make sure the specifications say that it will take a 3.5&quot; drive) </s>
<s> This information is perfect. </s>
<s> Thank you so much. </s>
<s> Best wishes. </s>
