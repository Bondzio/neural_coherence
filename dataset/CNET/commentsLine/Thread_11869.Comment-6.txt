duh, i'm embarassed i never considered that there would be video in action.
i think the parallels on the mackbook (non-pro) w/ 2 gb ram running photoshop was all i needed to set my mind at ease that the 2.2 w/o the ram upgrade should be fine.
now i just need to wait out the rumor of new mb pros coming out the end of feb. even though my initial question of what to buy has been answered i do still wonder which is better bang for the buck - ram vs processor upgrade...
