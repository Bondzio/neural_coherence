<s> Hello All, I am having a problem installing this Linksys Wireless Adapter WUSB100.. First off, I have this old HP 750n using XP that I am hooking up to my TV in my loft. </s>
<s> My router is a Linksys WRT320n connected to my Dell XPS420 using Vista Ultimate....with no problems. </s>
<s> Every time I try to set this adapter up, it shuts the PC down or has a hardware installation error come up saying that the Adapter hasn't passed Windows Logo Testing to verify it's compatibility with Windows XP. </s>
<s> The HP passes all of the requirements for this to work and is fully updated. </s>
<s> The box says this adapter is good for Vista, XP or even Windows 2000... </s>
<s> Does anyone have any ideas on what the problem is.... </s>
<s> If you need additional information I am more that willing to give it.... Any help will be greatly appreciated.... </s>
<s> Thanks Flu </s>
<s> run the installation CD first? </s>
<s> I think the drivers have to be on the system before you plug in the card. </s>
<s> If you must have products that pass this then for this device you must return it now as many makers do not bother with Windows Logo Testing. </s>
<s> There are fees and more to be paid to get that testing done. </s>
<s> Try another product. </s>

<s> I ran the cd first and everything seems fine until I get to the part to put the adapter in....that's when everything bad starts to happen.... </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply...any other suggestions? </s>

<s> your adapter may be DOA out of the box. </s>
<s> Take it back and get another brand. </s>
