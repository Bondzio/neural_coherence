<s> Canon i455 a few years old. </s>
<s> Was connected to my PC and shared across my network. </s>
<s> A few months ago I got a NAS and connected the printer there, still shared, worked perfectly (didn't have to turn my PC on for others to print). </s>
<s> Tried to print a text file this morning, no text. </s>
<s> Print head moved but no black ink (yes, new cartridge). </s>
<s> Did a nozzle check and all colors and black printed. </s>
<s> Tried text file again, everything moved but no text. </s>
<s> Moved the printer back to my PC and did a nozzle check. </s>
<s> All OK. </s>
<s> Tried to print the document, no text. </s>
<s> Created a document in Word, same-same. </s>
<s> Changed the color of the text to blue and voila! </s>
<s> So, it's not printing black. </s>
<s> All printer tests work but no black on any document. </s>
<s> Time for a new printer? </s>
<s> If this happened after you replaced the ink cart, then its an ink cart issue. </s>
<s> Especially, if this is a refilled ink cart or generic type. </s>
<s> Newer inkjets use all ink to print its output its really not black unless you have &quot;mono output&quot; selection. </s>
<s> They do this so all inkjets get used and not become clogged due to non-use. </s>
<s> I exclude any possible electronics issue here or introduced s/w glitch. </s>
<s> I would suggest you do an alignment, etc test and check results, etc.. if fails or never corrects then replace printer. </s>
<s> Its probably the cheapest fix, when new ink carts become involved. </s>
<s> You could try this printer on an entirely different system that never had it and install it to test. </s>
<s> If you buy new printer look into similar model or Canon that uses same ink carts to help in that area. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> It prints black, and colors on a nozzle check. </s>
<s> New cartridge, and I used it about a week ago. </s>
<s> I do not use recycled/generic/refilled cartridges, only Canon fresh out of the box. </s>
<s> I'll install it on my laptop and see what happens. </s>
<s> It was out of ink. </s>
<s> And I found out something useful. </s>
<s> When connected to the NAS the ink monitor does not work. </s>
<s> Installed it on the laptop, and after a few times of going through the tests and checks, I looked at the levels. </s>
<s> DUH!! </s>
<s> These levels do not show up correctly when connected to the NAS. </s>
<s> Put a new cartridge in and voila! </s>
<s> The NAS is nice but it will not display the printer monitor. </s>
<s> I'm glad you sorted it all out. </s>
<s> Remember the &quot;ink monitoring pgm.&quot; is nothing more than estimate or approx. </s>
<s> of ink level. </s>
<s> Defeating or ignoring the new ink cart install(align.) </s>
<s> starts sometimes this issue and/or get out of whack and keeps wanting attention. </s>
<s> Even if not displayed, it has become a sore spot. </s>
<s> I wish the times i could carry another system with me on calls as laptop sits at home. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
