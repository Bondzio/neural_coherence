First: Can anybody tell me how to figure out which drive is master and which slave? In bios, it always jyst says a cd device boots up after c: . (I have cdrw and dvdrw). I can't tell if the 40pin ide cable's grey (middle) pin is the master or is the black (end) pin master? I thought it was the grey, so I set the dvrw jumper to master, plugged it into the grey pin (middle) of ide cable and started the computer. I think the cable is the 40(line/pin) type. I can't tell how to tell if it is regular or the 'y' shaped kind of cable.Either way I plug in, black or grey pins , the cdrw drive blinks first (by like a tenth of a second though), the cdrw jumper is on slave, the dvdrw on master. ((I also have an I think 80?pin? ide cable, it has a blue connector as well, I could try that one?)) But again which pin is which master/slave? And in computer properties it does'nt tell you which drive is the first boot?! Please help. soloebe@yahoo.com

Proffitt	12/6/03 3:13 PM	1.07072358E12	Re:ide cables and master pin settings. 40 conductor cables use M and S.	80 conductor cables just assign M/S by placement and you set all drives to CS or cable select. No mystery, but you just be able to tell the difference on the cable. Since you have BLUE, BLACK and GREY connectors, we'll call it an 80 CONDUCTOR cable. ALL the drives on such a cable will be jumpered to CS. In closing, you don't want to know that I still find NEW CDRW drives that won't play with other drives until I update the CDRW drive FIRMWARE. This is asking far too much of consumers, but once I mention it, then most will go &quot;aha!&quot; and fix it. Bob
