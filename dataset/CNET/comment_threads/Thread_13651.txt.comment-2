It's Amperes if you are designing a machine.
Watts is a little easy for consumers to deal with so while I think this machine is stock I'd forgo the power supply and ask it's owner about the yearly maintenance.
Example at http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-11319_7-6240575-1.html If this was my machine I'd replaced the heatsink compound since it's cheap and often helps.
