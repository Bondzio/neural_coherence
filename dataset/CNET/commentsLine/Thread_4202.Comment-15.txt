ok, so i've reduced it right down to the mboard, cpu/hsf, psu, pwrbtn and speaker.
this is the first try since i switched it off approximately 3 hours ago and still nothing, absolutely nothing.
i also tried 2 other batteries but again nothing.
i'd tried swapping the battery before but have checked with another just in case... the board was sold to me as new (as in never used) but still could be a couple of years old.
got it from ebay and can probably get my money back without problem, not that it cost much.
trouble is i'm away now 'til friday (which is just as well as it probably won't be ready to start again 'til then!)
so i won't be able to try your suggestions and test all parts independantly until then when i can drag out a spare working and willing pc as a test bed.
i'll check back in when i return and let you know how i get on.
thanks for the insight into the workings of a mboard willy, very informative and thanks bob for talking me through this and making me see just how small a pc can really be.... minskin
