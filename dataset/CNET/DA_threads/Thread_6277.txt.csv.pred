1.1.1	My network admin has told me that a wireless access link takes up more bandwidth off of our network then a regular router .	St
1.1.2	does anyone know if wireless takes up more bandwidth then a regular lan network ?	Ques
1.2.1	I have n't heard this one before .	St
1.2.2	You may want to just nod and move along .	St
1.2.3	Or ask for a web article showing such .	St
1.2.4	Sounds like another urban legend .	St
1.2.5	Best of luck , Bob	Polite
1.3.1	Due to the fact that the connection uses RF ( Radio Frequency ) there is probably more overhead .	St
1.3.2	Which could equate to a little more bandwidth .	St
1.3.3	But unless you have several hundred wireless connections , it 's probably not noticeable .	St
