<s> I am considering purchasing an HP desktop for home use. </s>
<s> I am not a gamer, just need a reliable home computer that I will not need to replace in a couple of years. </s>
<s> I mainly will use for business which includes standard word processing, spreadsheets, email etc. </s>
<s> I also do some video and audio burning. </s>
<s> The basic configuration is shown below and the cost of this machine is approx. </s>
<s> $1100. </s>
<s> It seems like a pretty good machine for the price, but I am not an expert. </s>
<s> I am also looking at VelocityMicro, but for a similar config. </s>
<s> they are more expensive. </s>
<s> Thoughts. </s>

<s> Not worth it, get emachines t6212. </s>
<s> this doesn't have a pci-express slot. </s>
<s> You can get the same performance for half the price. </s>
<s> don't get fooled by ddr2, its not faster, amd's with its integrated memory controller still beats it. </s>
<s> I'd pay the extra (which should be discounted anyway) for XP Pro, Home has petty annoyances, I found. </s>
<s> Thanks for your input. </s>
<s> I will look into the emachine. </s>
<s> I did do some brief research awhile back on this machine and I kind of remember it getting a somewhat average review. </s>
<s> I will look further into it. </s>
<s> Thanks again for your suggestion. </s>
