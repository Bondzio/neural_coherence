I suggest you remove the HD and mount(jerry-rig) in another PC and do a OS reload there. Do the basic OS reload and then swap back. DO NOT install all SP patches, do that once the HD has been returned. Hopefully, it will see the need for a correction and ALLOW you that option to &quot;repair&quot; Otherwise, try again to boot from CD(if you can) and find the repair option&quot; from the menu and do that to help fix your problem. Boot into &quot;safe mode&quot; hitting F8 during boot-up and select the repair option if present. If not, then see if you can run the CHKDSK /R (DOS level) using the networking menu option being loaded. It should then allow the CD be accessed. Having the old PC bios if not truly updated, you're SOL w/o CD access. If this seems odd, then google for the above options for far greater details. If no CD boot, then you're left with possible USB boot, which can be as difficult as well under its own issues. I see your problem as a &quot;catch-22&quot; type issue, not having this or that to proceed. What happens when you hit F1 or F2 and give it plenty of time to react? tada -----Willy

The owner of such a machine usually learns how to do this but some forget. Let's find a refresher on this -&gt; http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310994 Good luck in bringing the machine back. Bob
