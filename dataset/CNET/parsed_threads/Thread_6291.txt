<s> This morning when i turned on my old desktop computer, my acer LCD monitor was displayed nothing. </s>
<s> The only thing i can see is the light on the bottom of the LCD keep flashing. </s>
<s> Normally, last time when i pushed the power button i can see the acer logo appeared on the LCD screen but now no more acer logo appear, it just no response. </s>
<s> My pc can POST with a single beep sound and i can heard the melody when my computer enter windows. </s>
<s> what happen to my computer? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I can't see in your post you checked the video cable/connection. </s>
<s> Best case it could just be a loose connection, so unplug the video cable and plug it back in, making sure the screws are tightened. </s>
<s> If that's it, it could be either your monitor has died or your video adapter has. </s>
<s> If you can plug in another monitor, you can see if it's your video adapter. </s>
<s> If the adapter is working, that narrows it down to the monitor. </s>
<s> I have an Acer monitor I bought a couple of years ago that has a light below the lower right corner. </s>
<s> FWIW, when it's not receiving a signal the light is amber, when it is, it's blue. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Based on the Acer lcd I'm looking at. </s>
<s> If I disconnect the monitor from the pc and then power the monitor on I see the Acer logo. </s>
<s> If I use the OSD....on screen display buttons I can view and play with stuff. </s>
<s> If I did not get a logo and the OSD did not function I'd take a guess the monitor is &quot;borked&quot;. </s>
<s> With the monitor disconnected from the pc or the pc turned off. </s>
<s> I turn the monitor on......I see an Acer logo then a no signal message. </s>
<s> The OSD does not function. </s>
<s> If the OSD didn't work, the test told us what to swap out. </s>
