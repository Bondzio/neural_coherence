my first home network was set up with a netgear router.
never had any problems with it.
i later went to a linksys - don't remember why - and i've never had any problems with it.
i think you'll generally be okay as long as you deal with a reputable company.
everybody has experienced good and bad things with all the top companies, but the main source of horror stories usually come from the fly-by-nights.
one thing i would recommend as a general policy - connect like equipment rather than mixing brands.
had a lot of success with the mixing, but over the years have had more successes without mixing.
