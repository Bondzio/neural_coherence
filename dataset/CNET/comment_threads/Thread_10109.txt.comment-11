i'd get a 9800Pro and a PSU as a 9800Pro is around $20 or $30 cheaper than the 6600GT, and should handle as well as the 6600 and then for a new PSU i'd suggest ensuring that you can install it in an HP computer (Dell for example uses a proprietary PSU design, my old HP uses a normal ATX design, what does yours use?)
