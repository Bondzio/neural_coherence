I'd go with one 1GB stick.
1.
Many motherboards lose the dual channel benefit if more than two matching slots are filled, so your question may be moot.

You will have to swap out a module(s) if you want more than 1GB total RAM, leaving you with unused (wasted?)
modules.
Add the second 1GB module when you have future upgrade funds.
