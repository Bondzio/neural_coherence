so it's a perfect drive.
but: - it's unpartitioned (raw) - recovery stops after 5 minutes if you trust that diagnostic, you simply repartition it, loose all your data and hope for the best.
but you said you want to recover your data, so maybe that wouldn't be your preferred idea.
all i can offer: try the other recovery programs from  maybe one works.
maybe none work.
you'll only know when you try.
