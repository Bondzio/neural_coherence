i personally have tried this twice.
the first time was when i bought a mach speed board and all new parts after instillation it would not no matter what i did load windows xp.
i at first thought the problem might be within the hard drive itself.
after sometime i got fed up with it so i took the hard drive out and put it in my other system, installed xp, then put the hard drive back in the mach speed machine.
it worked flawlessly.
i tried this again when i was having about the same problem with another board, it would not work, all it would say was due to hardware changes the hard drive could not be acessed.
well i hope this helps, but if i was you i wouldnt do it due to that fact it may or may not work.
