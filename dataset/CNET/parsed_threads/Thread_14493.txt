<s> Hello this is what I am looking for, I have a labtop computer so I need some type of combo pcmcia card for esata and maybe like usb2.0 or firewire if you could send me a link to one that would be cool. </s>
<s> Also someone said that I should get an esata combo with active cooling does anyone know of any good ones like that if you could send me a link to that also I would really appreciate it. </s>
<s> I have been trouble finding stuff with esata and have no idea about any of the manufacturers I have come across so far. </s>
<s> thanks for your help. </s>
<s> Even at trade shows. </s>
<s> As to cooling, a laptop cooling pad may be today's answer. </s>
<s> And while I've found SATA PC-Cards and USB 2.0 cards, none have &quot;active cooling&quot; so the only hope is the cooling pad. </s>
<s> The e on ESATA stands for external which is by nature of being a PC-Card will be automatic. </s>
<s> Therefore you just need to get a SATA card and you're done. </s>
<s> To get the USB 2.0 card and SATA to fit in the 2 slots you'll have to pay a bit more for those USB 2.0 cards built with dongles. </s>
<s> Sorry, I will not search for these products for you but have in the past and they are still available in the US. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Im sorry bob i am not the best with wording. </s>
<s> I was going to get a pcmcia card with usb2.0 and sata connection for my labtop so i could hook up a esata hard drive, the guy i talked to said to get the esata combo drive with active cooling( i dont know what that is). </s>
<s> I can find the pcmcia card but was wondering what your take is concerning the esata drives and if you could lead me to a good manufacturer of them 200-300gb with this active cooling, is this for the hard drive or for the labtop as you suggest? </s>
<s> &quot;I was going to get a pcmcia card with usb2.0&quot; You may have written this incorrectly but there has never been a PCMCIA card with USB 2.0. </s>
<s> God knows people wanted them. </s>
<s> You also need to know that the e in ESATA is just denoting it's external so don't be discouraged if you find only the usual SATA PC-Card. </s>
<s> I've declined in helping you search for exact products for a simple reason. </s>
<s> You may be in Peru. </s>
<s> Besides you can look at the usual sites like google, newegg and more. </s>
<s> ACTIVE COOLING in an external hard disk case is ... &quot;a fan.&quot; Again, the fancy words with such simple meaning. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> that solves all my questions thanks for being so helpful. </s>
<s> What OS are you running and does your laptop have USB 2.0 ports ? </s>
<s> i am running windows xp and my labtop still has 1.1 ports. </s>
<s> thats why i asked if there was a usb 2.0 and sata pcmcia card available. </s>
<s> i just found this http://www.pcconnection.com/ProductDetail?sku=6809388&srccode=cii_5784816&cpncode=10-24485416-2 and i think this might be what i will go with. </s>
<s> Under constant use the cases without fans have shown a tendency to overheat. </s>
<s> NCQ is not exclusive to this make so I'd take the marketing geewhiz words with a grain of salt. </s>
<s> -&gt; It fails at first glance to meet your spec. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> that indicated active cooling not to mention the cost...YIKES. </s>
<s> If it was mine, I'd try to find a PCMCIA Card that gives you USB 2.0 and buy that. </s>
<s> Generally speaking external HDDs are really quite inexpensive ...see Techbargains.com for weekly ads. </s>
<s> You can also 'build your own...you pick the external enclosure and the drive and put them together yourself. </s>
<s> Let us know if you find the PCMCIA USB card...USB 2.0 is plenty fast for most HDDs. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> compatible with USB 1.1. </s>
<s> Good buer reviews too. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16815104803 This would give you the hardware interface to use any USB device including you choice of USB external HDDs, external CD/DVDs, Flash drives etc., You can buy prebuilt or put together your own depending on need preference and budget. </s>
<s> If you buy prebuilt ...I'd avoid Maxtor as post for failures 'seems' higher than most. </s>
<s> Let us know. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> hello bob, i know it does not meet what i was looking for in the specs but i wonder what you mean by ncq is not exclusive to this make also thanks for letting me know about the overheating thats probably why i was told to get one with a fan, it was just something i was looking at and posted a link to see what response i might get about the possible choice. </s>
<s> @vapcmd thanks for the help but i didnt have trouble finding the usb 2.0 solutions just stuff concerning the sata drives. </s>
<s> thanks again bob and vapcmd. </s>
<s> But a good ad writer will grab anything to make their product sound better. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> way less than $280 ... and if you build your own vs buying prebuilt...you can get a much better drive warranty ... most are 3 to 5 years. </s>
<s> Packaged units only come with 1 year warrantys. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> After bob pointing out about the overheating and you pointing out about the price and warranty that I could gain by just builing one I will start my search in that direction , thanks. </s>
