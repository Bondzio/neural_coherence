I have a slightly older laptop that has XP and I'm thinking of upgrading to Vista Home Prem. I ran several tests to see if my laptop is &quot;Vista Ready&quot; including the one from MS and they said my laptop passes in everything BUT the Nvidia site told me no because of the following: Mobile intel 845GM express chipset family (Intel GMA950) Video HW Transform & Lighting Required (don't have) Vertex Shader Ver Required 2.0 (my ver is 0.0) I should note that MS upgrade advisor told me it was ok to move to Vista Home prem which is what i want. Based on my intel chipset specs do you think it could run Aero i/f? Thanks in advance.

That wasn't the problem. The problem is none of them told me WHICH version of Vista I could use (except MS - see below). The part I'm angling for is support for Aero. In my original post that portion was given to me by NVIDIA's own Vista readiness test. I think I had to install some plug in. With NVIDIA being a graphics company they for sure took a hard look at my graphics chip. If I interpreted their results correctly it meant to me Vista ok but just use Vista Basic. MS Upgrade Advisor however I think told me I was good for Vista Home Premium. So I'm getting conflicting information. I could of course go to the store and try it out but what if Aero doesn't work. I'm stuck with a copy of OS I can't give back. Finally looking at link a previous responder listed for me http://www.intel.com/products/chipsets/gma950/ it states in there the WDDM model is supported with updated drivers but for a certain Vista build only. Though pixel shader is supported I don't know if this is enough. Pretty confused here. Help!

Not all owners can find the drivers (for this one I go to intel.com) And a few GMA's that should do Aero (Microsoft said so in the test) failed to ever show it. No one is sure why on those cases but it was early GMA hardware that likely needed a motherboard BIOS change. Bob

Words from you: . slightly older laptop . has XP . upgrading to Vista Home Prem . run Aero i/f . what if Aero doesn't work Is this an academic exercise or are you spending $100 for frustration to prove that if you got it, flaunt it? Lots of consumers buying laptops today would give an arm and leg to have XP on it and you are going the other direction? Is MS giving a better deal for Vista to W7 upgrade than XP to W7 that I don't know about?
