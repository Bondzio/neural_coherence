10866	0	238032	2428365	NR	OldRetiredGuy	3/12/07 6:10 PM	1.173723E12	Help upgrade old graphics card please!	I have a four+ year old Dell desktop with a Geforce3 Ti 200 graphics card. I want to upgrade to a card with more dedicated memory preparing for adding Vista later. Don't play graphics intensive games. Could anyone please confirm my old card is in an AGP slot? 2x/4x or 4x/8x??? Any recommendations for models,brands or store would be appreciated. Thanks.
