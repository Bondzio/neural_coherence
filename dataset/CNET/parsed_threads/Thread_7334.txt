<s> I have an old Windows Vista system with the C drive capacity of about 76Gb. </s>
<s> I have Unallocated space of 5Gb and then next to it the C drive of 70Gb but the Unallocated space is listed before the C drive. </s>
<s> Have tried to extend volume from the C drive partition but it's grayed out. </s>
<s> Have tried to make the unallocated space into usable space and then giving it a hard drive name to see if I can then delete it and then see if I can extend the volume at that point but that didn't assist me. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Would appreciate any help </s>
<s> And if you delete the C partition you won't have an OS to boot to. </s>
<s> If you have a good backup copy and a backup copy of that you can try GPARTED to move the partition. </s>

<s> With the size of today's hard drives, 5 GB is nothing. </s>
<s> You'd likely do more harm than good since that partition was probably put there by your manufacturer for a good reason. </s>
<s> It may contain recovery info or it may be used for security or other purposes. </s>
<s> Windows provides a disk management tool under the Administrative Tools applet of the Control Panel, but I just remind you that &quot;if it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot;. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> is a pittance and you'll be back need more in a month or less. </s>

<s> Such as they have one of those early 10,000 or 15,000 RPM drives and paid dearly for it and want to eek out that last GB. </s>
<s> I can see that (and wonder if such drives do fly.) </s>

<s> to regain use of 5GBs says 'nah'. </s>
<s> Keep up the good work ! </s>
