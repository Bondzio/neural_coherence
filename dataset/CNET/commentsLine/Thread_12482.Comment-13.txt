prior to hurricane katrina there was one computer custom builder sales and repair shop in my town; katrina destroyed his business; he moved and now there is not one custom computer shop anywhere along my mississippi gulf coastline although office depot; office max, circuit city are now back and a best buy has come into the area since the hurricane.
wal-mart is now also back.
