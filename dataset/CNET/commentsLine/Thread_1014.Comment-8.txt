first off, i do video editing and i think i can offer some useful thoughts... if you really want to switch to a mac for video editing, consider the fact that imacs use a mobile version of the core 2 duo processor, and a slower laptop (5400 rpm) hard drive.
on the other hand, getting a macpro is much more expensive.
if you really want the pure performance of a core 2 duo -- not a mobile version -- i'd actually recommend a new pc over an imac.
with your current rig, you still do have some potential.
first of all, get yourself a video card (even a 256mb model is fine for video editing).
i use an evga geforce 7900 with 256mb on my editing rig, and never have a hiccup or lag.
second, max out your ram.
you probably have a 32 bit os, so put 4 gigs in it (32 bit version of windows can't use any more than that -- actually only uses 3.5 gb).
that should make a huge difference.
if it's still not enough, upgrade to that 2.6 ghz 5000 processor.
most video editing software now is optimized to use multiple cores, and a 2.6 ghz dual core processor is still pretty respectable!
btw, my rig (for reference) - core 2 duo e6400 (2.13 ghz) 1.5 gb ram (more would be better, but with the video card and intel processor it hasn't been a problem yet.)
