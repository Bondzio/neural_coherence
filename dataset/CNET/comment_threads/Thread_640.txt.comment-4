I was actually at Best Buy the other day and asked why the 840GM was $200 more and the salesman told me because of the slightly newer/faster processor and because it had the TV tuner card where the 835GM did not (he even turned the thing around and checked).
I thought this was totally retarded for a thousand dollar ''media pc'' to not have the card already.
After all, isn't being able to watch and record TV the biggest feature of using XP Media Center?
