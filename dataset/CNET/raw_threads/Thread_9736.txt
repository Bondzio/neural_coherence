Two keys, the down arrow key and the page down key, are sticking. But they don't actually stick. i have had keyboards with sticky keys before, and that is not what this is like. The keys do not appear to be physically sticking in any way. The computer acts as if i am holding the keys down. i don't think it's an issue with dirt because i have removed and cleaned the keys several times. The keyboard is in great shape and has never had anything spilled on it. So what else could it be? This can be a very frustrating problem when it happens at just the wrong time while web browsing or playing a flash game. Any help would be appreciated. jason

You're flexing the domes on the top layer of the keyboard. They're supposed to pop back into position but they get weaker with age and use. Eventually they don't return to proper shape and the electrical contacts stay closed...or open...whatever the case may be. You don't fix these but you replace them. You can get very good keyboards made for heavy use. If you're interested, you can try those made in Germany by Cherry. I've got one...very nice but has a feel that some won't like.
