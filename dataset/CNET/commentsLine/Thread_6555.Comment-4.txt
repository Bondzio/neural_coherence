i think you have a good handle on the problem.
if you can't connect to the wifi router (this one is an airport) with any machine then it's the airport with some 98% certainty.
i take out my spare router for the final test as sometimes you find the owner has repeated the same mistake on all machines (too many to list here.)
the old hide the ssid issue is coming back to haunt owners again.
this old advice is making my friends lots of money as they make house calls to unhide the ssid.
sometimes you wonder if there is a reason for the bad security advice.
