The enclosure is a USB 2.0 PM-350-U2. I hook it up to my computer and the drivers install and report no problems. I have 3 USB 2.0 ports and tried them all. I also have Windows XP Pro SP2. The disk also does not appear on the disk management utility. Can someone please help me.

No mention about the machine make/model and if you installed the motherboard driver package or it's USB 2.0 supplement. Some boards require this. http://www.usbman.com has more about USB 2.0 Be sure to see if the USB drive works on another machine. It could be dead. Bob

Every time I hook up the hard drive to my computer the safely remove hardware icon appears. In my device mananger, all my USB drivers are there and working properly. The host controllers and USB mass storage device is also there and working. I hooked up the hard drive to another computer and the same things occur.

5889	6	55605	664979	664942	R. Proffitt	1/7/05 5:10 PM	1.1051178E12	There are many reasons.	The hard disk isn't supported in the case. The hard disk is unplugged in the case. The hard disk is dead. The case has a fault. The cable has a fault. There isn't enough of a clue train here to nail this one. But if it's not working with any machine... then it's dead. Bob
