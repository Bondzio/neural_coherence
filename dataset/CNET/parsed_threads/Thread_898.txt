<s> hi.. i wanted to ask if i tune tuneup my PC what is the result, like it will only work faster than before. </s>
<s> i have an AMD 2000 (PVCLE266M-L) it has a win XP, 800mhz processor, and 768mb ram (512+256), 40gb hd. </s>
<s> so can i ask how will you tune up your pc. </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> Probably the most bang for your hardware upgrading buck would be to install a PCI video card with its own dedicated memory. </s>
<s> HOWEVER, I wouldn't put any money into such an old system (Pentium III). </s>
<s> Just enjoy it as is for what it does well--word processing, email, Web browsing, and other less resource intensive tasks. </s>
<s> Maybe even try a couple Linux distributions (some will run faster than XP on that computer). </s>
<s> If you really feel the need to open your wallet, I'd put my money towards one of today's inexpensive desktops or notebooks. </s>
<s> In terms of software, you can streamline XP by getting rid of a unnecessary programs and services that run in the background. </s>
<s> Clean it of all viruses, spyware, malware, and P2P clients. </s>
<s> Burn those videos and pics to CD/DVD and remove them from your hard drive if it is getting full. </s>
<s> Google: make XP run faster </s>
