<s> I have read it was possible to connect an xbox through a laptop or pc's wireless connection. </s>
<s> Every time i give it a try i run into diffrent problems, but the one that keeps stopping me is: Windows - Sytem Error There is an IP addres conflict with another system on the network. </s>
<s> I am running XP, i have bridged the connections; Wireless Network Connection, Local Area Connection (Xbox 360). </s>
<s> With the connections bridged i am still able to connect to the internet with my laptop, but i lose contact with my Xbox. </s>
<s> Here's a link about using ICS to do such but I decline to try it since there are too many reasons for failure... -&gt; http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/networking/expert/bowman_02april08.mspx </s>
