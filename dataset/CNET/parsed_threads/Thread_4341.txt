<s> I have finally got a hold of the mobo that I ordered from Newegg.com. </s>
<s> It was quite easy to put in, thanks to Ray's heads up regarding the jumpers. </s>
<s> But I have problems already. </s>
<s> The new MB is a PC Chips' product, and its model # is M811LU. </s>
<s> I have put in everything onto the MB and into the new case without any problem. </s>
<s> And the MB recognizes every components quite easily. </s>
<s> But then problem came up, when I plug the ethernet cord into the RJ 45 jack, the screen went to the good old &quot;white text with blue background&quot; telling me either the hardware does not have the latest driver or it's not installed properly. </s>
<s> Though every card in the PCI slots were found and installed properly, and I am certain they all have the newest driver. </s>
<s> I have double checked over and over again, still no luck. </s>
<s> At first I thought it's just the on board LAN's not acting correctly, therefore, I disabled it and put in my own NIC. </s>
<s> Still, same blue screen with white text appeared when I plugged in the ethernet cable. </s>
<s> Can someone please help me verify and solve the problem, it'd be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Sincerely, Joe </s>
<s> But can only guess you moved some hard disk with an installed OS onto this new machine and &quot;Windows&quot; needs to be installed. </s>

<s> What's at the other end of the ethernet cable? </s>
<s> I had enough of it, therefore, I formatted everything and reinstall what I had one by one. </s>
<s> And that's when I found out it was my Kerio Firewall was playing tricks on me. </s>
<s> Anyway, my problem is fixed now, and the MB is pretty decent as of now. </s>
<s> Thanks, Joe </s>
