I have not attempted to do this but am sure that they dont design it to make it easy.
Though since I did buy it legitimately and am just trying to use it on one computer still it doesnt seem like it should be a big deal but I guess it is.
That was the whole point is my ex's husband had put this computer and I dont know how my daughter foudn out it was not a legal copy but that is what we are trying to do just like I have done scavanging the other parts of the computer since it was not worth having fixed.
So what would be the least expensive legal way to get a copy of XP on to her computer and delete the illegal copy?
Her computer is about 10 years old and not worth spending money on obviously but until she can afford a new computer we just want this one to run until then.
I have a super multi drive that was not SATA so I am sending her than an a 1 Gig memory card I bought for my old computer, so those will help make it run a bit better until she can afford a new one.
But I just need to know the least expensive way to get the OS on there.
Thanks Much.
