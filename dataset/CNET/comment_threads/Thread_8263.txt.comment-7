i'm not rejecting a server by name, but i don't need more than 1 bay etc.
i just need 1 drive that is at least 500gb up to 1tb that can plug into my router so i can access it from any pc and from the wireless on my laptop, and that i can map to my network drive on my laptop, that is reliable and can run 24/7 for a long time.
my WD ran for a little over a year 24/7 and now works intermittently, mainly i can only have it on for an hour or less before my laptop can no longer find it as a mapped drive, but the blue rings are lit up, the drive is spinning, but no luck accessing it anymore..............
