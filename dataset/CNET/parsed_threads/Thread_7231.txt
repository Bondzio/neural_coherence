<s> I bought a Samsung MP3 for my son, age 8. </s>
<s> It had a higher customer rating than Ipod. </s>
<s> So did alot of others. </s>
<s> It has more functions and memory than Ipod. </s>
<s> Never skips, cracks or jumps like some of the Ipod reports I've read that say Ipod does. </s>
<s> We never had a problem of any kind. </s>
<s> It's easy for my son to us and for me to load. </s>
<s> And priced 25% cheaper for Ipod's same type. </s>
<s> YU-11 player is fabulous compared to the rest. </s>
<s> When my son stated it had to be a MP3 and not Ipod, I was a little confused. </s>
<s> I thought there only was Ipod. </s>
<s> He said everyone had Ipod and it was crap. </s>
<s> He wanted a good one. </s>
<s> Come to find out he was right. </s>
<s> But if you go to a retail store, you would think Ipod is all that exists. </s>
<s> Why is this? </s>
<s> Are we such a &quot;shop faddy socity&quot; that we don't &quot;care to compare&quot; anymore? </s>
<s> Or is there a retail corruption, tring to steer our purchases? </s>
<s> Where is your networking question? </s>
<s> A high percentage of people like that model. </s>
<s> If you don't, then buy something else. </s>
<s> -&gt; Where's the network or wireless question here? </s>

<s> While I tend to agree, the fact is Apple owns the market for MP3 players. </s>
<s> My first player was a Dell DJ, and it was good, if not great MP3 player. </s>
<s> But if you want any versatility with from a player, the iPod is the only way to go because there are literally TONS of accessories available. </s>
<s> Although, the DJ is well represented in terms of accessories, most are only available on-line from Dell and a few other vendors. </s>
<s> But you can go to almost any type of store and find iPod accessories. </s>
<s> From docks to cases to car stereo integration to boom boxes, there appears to be no end to the options and versatility for the iPod. </s>
<s> Nothing beats having my music library with me at all times, whether that be in the car, while shopping at Sams, or while working out - all with the same player. </s>
