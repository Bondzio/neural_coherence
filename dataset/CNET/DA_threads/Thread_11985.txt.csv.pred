1.1.1	I was wondering which multifunction printer is better?	St
1.1.2	Also was having a hard time finding out, how much memory Epson 4540 has?	St
1.2.1	http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/jsp/Product.do?sku=C11CB32201 The memory is usually enough to perform the tasks given.	St
1.2.2	As such, few printers offer how much ram is in the printer.	St
1.2.3	Can you share with the forum why this matters?	St
1.3.1	According to a conversation with Epson, the Epson Workforce Pro 4540 do not have memory like other printers.	St
1.3.2	They also didn't want to comment on how it works either.	St
1.3.3	About comparing the two Epson Workforce Pro 4540 vs HP Officejet Pro 8600 Premium, which one would you lean towards and why?	St
1.3.4	My findings so far: according to just specs sheets the HP 8600 looks good but according to videos the Epson 4540 looks pretty good =\	St
1.4.1	Since Epson won't talk to you about your concerns, the other models wins by default.	St
