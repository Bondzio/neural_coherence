A few weeks ago I used it to do a bit of batchfile stuff to show people what it looked like in 'the old days'.I've just fired her up again and got '1790 - disk 0 error' which I believe to mean hard disk failure. Is this the end of the the computer without perhaps major surgery? Can I get into the BIOS? Is there a BIOS to get into? Any thoughts would be most welcome.

WAG, it's hitting F2 or F10 key during boot-up. You would need to repair it as more than likely the error 1790 is a &quot;hard error&quot;. if you have access to the OS floppies and yet another HD, you should be able to recover. Compaq back then provided &quot;diag floppies&quot; that covered everything that needed to be done. Having access to this is going to be your problem. A bootable floppy that had the required files is required is going the old fashion raw method. The bios access requires it boots from &quot;floppy&quot; 1st as the main boot device, thus the required bootable floppy and/or diskette. While you're dealing with DOS3.1, it can very well use any latter released OS like 5.0 up to 6.2(from memory). of course, you still need the bootable floppy/diskette. Compaq support may have details on all required diags, check the &quot;legacy side&quot; of things to see if provided but that's a long shot. tada -----Willy
