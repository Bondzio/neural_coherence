hello, i just removed a very full internal hard drive (seagate ide) and replaced it with a new 160gb (western digital) hard drive.
i thought it would be a simple swap, just needing to change jumpers as i was slaving the old drive.
however, none of the drives are booting up i am getting a clicking sound from both drives.
what went wrong we simply unplugged and followed the directions that came with the new drive?
windows xp o/s.
