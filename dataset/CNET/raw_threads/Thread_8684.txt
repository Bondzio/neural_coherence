Most PC speakers have a dedicated preamp input to control volume and EQ on the subwoofer and they're almost always unique for different manufacturers. Most of the time these preamps are hard wired, or at least integrated into the enclosures of the speaker system, and can't be removed. Assuming that you have a system in mind that has a dedicated preamp (I know Logitech and Bose have some models with dedicated preamps) you'll have to make sure that your speakers connect to your amp. Also, many newer systems use digital inputs on the preamp and may not be compatible with certain amplifiers. Most speakers use standard speaker wire and a 3.5mm mini jack to connect with the amp, but not all. If you're really serious about using different components instead of a mass produced system, I'd suggest a self powered subwoofer (or invest in a component sub and plate amp), home theater style receiver, and speakers of your choice. Even car speakers/subwoofers will work assuming you want to build enclosures for them.
