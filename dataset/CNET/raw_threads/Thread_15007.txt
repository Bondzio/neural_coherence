Unfortunately, she threw away the CDs and floppies that came with the computer including the replacment sound card. I've tried everything I know to try identify the sound card and download the correct drivers without success. Does anyone have some advice or suggestions on how I can find the brand and model of the sound card? I have not removed it from the tower but will if that is what's needed. Thanks.

If it is not the you will have to pull the card. Look for a Mnf name and model on card or on the largest chip. Then you will have to do a Google search. Post back what you find for futher assistance.

I didn't know she had the sound card replaced so I was trying to install drivers from the manufacturer's web site for her model. Unfortunately, I never did find any utility that would identify the sound card for me. Had she not come up with the name and CD, I don't know if I would have ever figured it out. Since I didn't need to remove it, I didn't have a chance to look at it. Do sound cards have the name written on them anywhere? If you really didn't know which one was installed, how would you find out?

I use aida32 and Belarc. Both are free and can be downloaded at different sites. Just type in Google search. The mfg. of the chipset on the card is of primary importance. In many instances they are the same mfg. For example, the mfg. may be Creative, Turtle Beach,CMI, etc. While this may be a clue to chipset identity, you can not rely solely on this info. You must identify the chipset. For example, CMI8738 or ES1312, etc. Each chipset has its unique model number. Another way to identify is to visually inspect the card. The id is usually printed on the chipset. Then you can go to the site of the chipset mfg. and search for the proper driver for that chipset. Hope this helps.

Had the owner not come up with the CD, I would have needed to remove the card and inspect it. The computer is now up and running great. Thanks for the help.
