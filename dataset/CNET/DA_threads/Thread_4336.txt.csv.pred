1.1.3	Is there anyway I can recover the data .	St

1.3.1	This was my back up drive ! !	St
1.3.2	I have almost all my files on the 2 other drives I have .	St

1.5.5	You can if possible buy another similar HD itself , replace the old with new of the enclosure , just buy the right type , even a larger one if you like .	St
1.5.6	All too often as stated here in the storage forum , you wo n't recover much or all of it should you persist in doing so .	St
