i have a pentium 3 550mh, windows xp, and 256 mb of ram.
my pc constantly lags and i have problems of programs not responding, and it seems to take forever to boot.
i defrag once a week, constantly delete my temp internet files, run spyware and anti virus scans.
how can i speed up my cpu without having to buy a new pc
