<s> I just purchased a new laptop and since it has no parallel ports, I tried purchasing a usb to parallel printer cable. </s>
<s> After hours of installing, uninstalling drivers I've run out of ideas trying to get the printer connected. </s>
<s> After a re-boot, if I print a test page, it turns the printer on, but never prints the document. </s>
<s> Anyone have any experience with this printer on a USB port, workcentre xd130df? </s>
<s> Anyone have any ideas how I can connect to this printer with the laptop? </s>
<s> Print Server have a better shot? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> Dell Vostro 1500 XP Home </s>
<s> Mine were from belkin and a no-name. </s>
<s> Worked find with XP. </s>
<s> However the Vostro is fairly new. </s>
<s> I wonder if you or Dell installed XP? </s>

<s> Dell installed the XP. </s>
<s> I named the make of an adapter I used. </s>
<s> It worked but I don't have your printer. </s>
<s> http://www.netgear.com/Products/PrintServers/WiredPrintServers/PS101.aspx is another thought. </s>
<s> Try other parallel adapters. </s>
<s> And finally a parallel port for your laptop? </s>
