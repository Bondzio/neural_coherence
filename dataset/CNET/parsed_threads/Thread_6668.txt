<s> I'm looking for a 20&quot;/21&quot; wide-screen LCD monitor for Graphic Design purpose. </s>
<s> My most concerned are image quality, color fidelity & graphics control capabilities. </s>
<s> Macintosh OSX platform, price range from $400-550. </s>
<s> I would apreciate if anybody can make some suggestions. </s>
<s> Million Thx! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> The 2 will work great together and the color on yours will be almost exactly like another Apple setup. </s>
<s> For color correctness you'll get the Pantone Spyder if you are truly serious about that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thx Bob! </s>
<s> I realize Apple's monitor is one of the best choices but it's a bit too expensive to me (I'm planning to buy 3 monitors). </s>
<s> So I'm searching for some other options with good performance at more reasonable cost. </s>
<s> Thx anyway! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> There goes color correction too. </s>
<s> Now that we've tossed out that, you just need to find your price. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> for quality, price and design the VX2025wm is the most recommended for you. </s>
<s> take a look ate their site and enjoy. </s>
<s> XD I was about to get one 32&quot; LCD but the resolution for those is so small... instead of gain you lose workspace... 1280x768... bah! </s>
<s> better to have a 23&quot; max. </s>
<s> Honestly, my first choice would be the Apple monitors. </s>
<s> Sure, they're pricey, but they are great! </s>
<s> Two of the three choices of their monitors also work with Windows-based PC's too (provided you have the right type of video card). </s>
<s> If you want to choose something other than Apple, then I would recommend Viewsonic's Pro Series. </s>
<s> There are 3 series that Viewsonic puts out and there is a difference in how well they perform -- so pay attention to the little VX, VA, etc. </s>
<s> in front of the model numbers. </s>
<s> VA is the value series... VX is the pro series. </s>
<s> They, too, are pricey, but well worth it if you are a pro graphics person. </s>
<s> Lastly, Samsung makes a pro series as well... again the same notes apply as above. </s>
<s> For the most part, the pro type series of monitors are not going to be available at most stores. </s>
<s> So, I recommend starting at each manufacturers' web site to get the choices/specs, etc., and then do some comparitive shopping online. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>

<s> This monitor is awesome. </s>
<s> Check out toms hardware page for recommendations. </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com/2006/03/27/the_spring_2006_lcd_collection/ I bought the viewsonic VP191b and have been very happy with it. </s>
<s> i don't sell these yet so don't think this is just spam. </s>
<s> most/all phillips monitors have a three year warranty and some come with a &quot;perfect panel&quot; designation. </s>
<s> it means just that, no dead pixels! </s>
<s> plus a quick turn-around in case something does happen. </s>
<s> they're not cheap but...... viewsonic would be my second choice but their HUGE list of part numbers make it difficult to find the exact product that you are looking for. </s>
<s> i as a dealer can even get a little overwelmed with viewsonic. </s>
<s> weeding through all of the offerings and then checking with different vendors to find my choice gets old. </s>
<s> then having to do it all over in three weeks because that part # is no longer stocked. </s>
<s> don't get me wrong they make a good product!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> I have been using Microtek 815C 18&quot;, for the last 3 years. </s>
<s> The picture is crisp and clear. </s>
<s> My son has used autocad with it. </s>
<s> His friend bought one earlier this year, and plays Oblivion and Doom, with great graphics. </s>
<s> Based off of our 18&quot; LCD's, I bet their 20 & 21's, will be just as good. </s>
<s> They're only good for movies. </s>
<s> They stretch the picture on everything else and looks terrible, unless you like 2 black stripes on either side. </s>
<s> Costing you 4&quot; of horizontal screen size. </s>
<s> (17&quot;) </s>
<s> If you use this monitor vertically it's very slick. </s>
<s> Imagine a dual monitor display (2) operating vertically. </s>
<s> That's some real graphics power. </s>
<s> Nvidia's driver will allow rotation. </s>
<s> No one mentioned Dell. </s>
<s> I've used them at work, and was considering buying a 19&quot; monitor for home. </s>
<s> Any opinions? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
