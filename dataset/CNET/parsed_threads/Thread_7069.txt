<s> The USB ports on my laptop (for some reason) do not work any longer, I think they got fried. </s>
<s> I need to hook my digital camera up; is there a device out there that I can plug into my serial port that will allow me to use the usb plug on my camera? </s>

<s> Serial ports no longer have the sway of the computer world. </s>
<s> You can google away and try to find such an adapted, but you're better served is you have PCMICA type ports to install USB ports that way. </s>
<s> Make sure your orginal USB are done-in, they may not as the &quot;driver&quot; may need to be re-installed. </s>
