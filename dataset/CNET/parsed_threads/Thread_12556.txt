<s> I'm building a new computer, will be using Win XP. </s>
<s> What is the most efficient, most powerful Intel processsor I can buy, money is no object? </s>
<s> On the other end of the spectrum, where money is a concern, maybe up to $200- $250, what is the best Intel offering? </s>
<s> I won't be doing games, photoshop mostly. </s>
<s> the top end consumer choices are now the core i7 which has 4 CPU cores and hyperthreading. </s>
<s> to the OS, it appears you have 8 processors. </s>
<s> since you're sticking with xp (and thus 32-bit photoshop), they're probably overkill for you. </s>
<s> (if you're a pro that edits extremely large content, vista 64bit + 64bit cs4 + 6-8gb of ram are an ideal combo. </s>
<s> read this link for more info: http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=kb404901&sliceId=1 ) core i7: core i7 920, 2.8ghz, 1mb/8mb L2/L3 cache, $300 core i7 940, 2.93ghz, 1mb/8mb L2/L3 cache, $570 here are intel's mainstream quad and dual core processors. </s>
<s> note that the core i7 920 will outperform the q9650 in most intensive photoshop tasks (things that take 20+ sec to finish). </s>
<s> if your photoshop work is less taxing, a q9400 will give you great performance. </s>
