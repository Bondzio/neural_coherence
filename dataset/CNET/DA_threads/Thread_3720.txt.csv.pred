1.1.1	Hello , and thanks in advance for your time .	Polite
1.1.2	I 'm running a Dell Latitude E6500 , and ever since I pulled it out of the box a few days ago , the disk drive will not recognize new disks .	St
1.1.3	If an audio CD is in the drive , and I switch it to a data CD , it will not change the icon or name of the disk in the drive .	St
1.1.4	For example , if CD A is in the drive on boot , and ten minutes later I replace it with CD B , when I open Computer I still see the information for CD A instead of the information for CD B .	St
1.1.5	When I hit & quot ; explore & quot ; , however , I see CD B 's data .	St
1.1.6	Even after I have done this , CD A 's information remains displayed .	St
1.1.7	I run Windows Vista Ultimate , and the drive is an & quot ; HL-DT-ST DVD+-RW GSA-U20N & quot ; .	St
1.1.8	I already checked for driver updates , loose contacts , and autoplay issues .	St
1.1.9	Any help would be greatly appreciated , and as you can see , this is my first post on these forums , so if I left out any necessary information , let me know and I should get back to the thread within a short time .	St
1.2.1	I would reseat the connections at both ends , several times .	St
1.2.2	Verify that any addressing jumper is present or is proper .	St
1.2.3	Why , did you pull the drive in the 1st place , to access something or replace it , etc ?	Ques
1.2.4	Did you use proper & quot ; static & quot ; handling ?	Ques
1.2.5	If not , then you now have the result from improper handling .	St
1.2.6	If this is SATA type connection , these can be awful when reconnecting as it is possible to break or spread the contacts from touching 100 % .	St
1.2.7	Verify all this and come back with results .	St
1.2.8	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	The Latitude is a laptop , it shipped with this issue , so static is out .	St
1.3.2	But yes , I own an antistatic mat and wrist strap and utilize both when working with internal components ( I 've been called paranoid ) .	St
1.3.3	And I did not remove the drive & quot ; in the first place & quot ; , I did it in response to this problem .	St
1.3.4	Thanks !	St
1.4.1	I pulled and reseated the drive in order to ( potentially ) solve this problem , which arose before I did so .	St
1.4.2	That 's better .	St
1.5.1	If this is a new laptop , use the warranty .	St
1.5.2	However , you may have voided the warranty , depends .	St
1.5.3	if this is used and can return it as it was n't stated having that problem , if possible .	St
1.5.4	Because , this is a laptop , a repair from a proper shop maybe the only cure .	St
1.5.5	Other than a HD swap , could you begin suspect something else .	St
1.5.6	Your options become very limited as user repair .	St
1.5.7	I have laptop adapter/kit to see if the HD works elsewhere .	St
1.5.8	You can use USB ext .	St
1.5.9	case as well to check out HD .	St
