<s> I have a Linksys WRT54G running as an access point in mixed mode. </s>
<s> One machine on my network is approximately 40-45 feet away from it and behind 2 walls, and running 802.11b. </s>
<s> It seems that the machine in question can only see and connect to the network intermittently. </s>
<s> At first i thought it was a low signal strength issue but the level of reliability seems to vary, and when it DOES connect it appears to have a decent signal. </s>
<s> There is a moderately high amount of traffic here, we can usually see at least 5-6 networks. </s>
<s> I've tried several frequencies to no noticible difference. </s>
<s> Any ideas what may be the issue? </s>
<s> Bad router? </s>
<s> Bad card? </s>
<s> Just need more signal? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> &quot; approximately 40-45 feet away from it and behind 2 walls, &quot; And you'll not get a good solid 11 mbps connection. </s>
<s> Try 1.0 mbps. </s>
<s> It's a radio. </s>
<s> You are shielding the radios so that's the way it works. </s>
<s> What to do? </s>
<s> Get closer, put a repeater in between. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'm still curious why it would be so intermittent though? </s>
<s> It's either a great signal or no signal... </s>
<s> To determine why requires a few million bucks of equipment in some radio site survey truck. </s>
<s> For well under 100 bucks, a repeater will likely just cure it. </s>
<s> Let me share that a microwave oven cohabits this frequency space and is some 1000 Watts. </s>
<s> It's not supposed to leak much but I have seen them interfere with Wifi operation. </s>
<s> If you want to know why, I must bow out now. </s>
<s> If you want to fix it, the repeater will likely cure it. </s>
<s> It has so far. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> INSTEAD OF SPENDING THE MONEY FOR A REPEATER, AND SURE THAT WILL WORK JUST FINE, I SAVED MONEY AND BOUGHT EXTENDED ANTENNAS, AND FOUND THE GAIN JUST ENOUGH TO SOLVE THE SAME PROBLEM THAT I HAD. </s>
<s> I BOUGHT THE ANTENNAS FROM BEST BUY..... GOOD LUCK DONT BUY A GENERTIC BRAND, I TRIED, AND DIDN'T WORK, LINKSY HAS A DEDICATED PAIR THAT WORKED FOR ME MODEL: HGA7T </s>
