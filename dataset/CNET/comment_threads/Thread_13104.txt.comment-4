I have a side business doing home networks and after having many of the same problems your having, I gave up on Linksys and started using Netgear N wireless routers.
I had used Linksys B & G routers for years without any problems, but once they started making them in that Pancake configuration, things seem to have gone downhill.
If you want duel band look at the Netgear WNR 3700.
I have put several in without a problem.
I am sure there are other brands that work as well, but I stick with what works for me.
One thing I would like to add, no matter what brand you choose and it is at all possible, put the router in a central location on the main or middle floor.
