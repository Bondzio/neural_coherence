<s> I'm trying to find the best bang for the buck configuration for a 4 monitor desktop. </s>
<s> My desire is to use 4 ViewSonic VX2025WM's (which received high marks in its review here) running in their native resolution (1680 x 1050) turned 90 degrees (portrait orientation). </s>
<s> I'm considering using 2 XFX GeForce 8800 GTS (320MB) cards to drive them. </s>
<s> I have a dual PCI express slot motherboard with a Core Duo processor and I'm running XP SP2. </s>
<s> I believe my most demanding application will be video editing. </s>
<s> I use the Xbox 360 for games. </s>
<s> I have a few questions that I can't seem to get a straight answer to: 1. </s>
<s> Is changing the output orientation from landscape to portrait a video card software issue or an XP issue, i.e. </s>
<s> does XP SP2 support this directly? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Does this XFX card support running in a dual card configuration? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Should I upgrade to the 640 MB card? </s>
<s> Just recently we discussed and I disclosed no payoff in highend GPU cards at this link -&gt; http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7582_102-0.html?forumID=28&threadID=236651&messageID=2420463#2420463 So at the office we use simple dual output cards (ATI or Nvidia) and see no speed loss during edit or rendering. </s>
<s> We also save bucks on power consumption. </s>
<s> Just my answers to your questions. </s>
<s> 1. </s>

<s> does XP SP2 support this directly? </s>
<s> It's done with the drivers that come with said software. </s>
<s> Microsoft is not keen on driver development. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Does this XFX card support running in a dual card configuration? </s>
<s> From what I've read, yes. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Should I upgrade to the 640 MB card? </s>
<s> For video editing? </s>
<s> I'll write no. </s>
<s> Gamers would. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I actually got someone knowledgable at XFX that agreed that I could basically get two 7900 GS cards for the price of one of the 8800 GTS cards and accomplish my objective. </s>
<s> And there's another benefit... apparently the 8800's are real power hogs, requiring one 500 watt power supply EACH! </s>
<s> The other issue I guess is the distinction between Extended Desktop and Desktop Spanning. </s>
<s> I was looking for Desktop Spanning, which is not possible with rotated displays I've been told. </s>
<s> Extended Desktop is able to rotate and use all 4, apparently, &quot;with a little tweaking&quot; but not as one continuous desktop. </s>
<s> i just tried rotating both my displays using the nvidia control panel and only the first/primary display wound up being rotated -- the second display remained in landscape orientation. </s>
<s> this may be due to my dual monitors having different resolutions (primary is widescreen, secondary is 4:3) but you should confirm this functionality &quot;in-person&quot; since it wouldn't be the first time a tech support rep has made an misleading claim. </s>
<s> if you're not going to do any gaming, a geforce 7300 is more than sufficient. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> He said it would take some tweaking. </s>
<s> Could you have missed a tweak with their software? </s>
<s> rotation is on a different tab than the monitor selection window, but regardless of which monitor i selected, only the primary monitor rotated. </s>
<s> again this could be due to my setup (1 widescreen with DVI, 1 4:3 with VGA). </s>
<s> still, enough folks have dual displays that you should be able to find someone who can confirm it for you. </s>
<s> Speaking with XFX, they said do not use the nvrotate utility. </s>
<s> That only rotates the primary monitor. </s>
<s> Instead, using the classic nvidia control panel (not the new one), go into nview, click display settings, highlight the monitor you want to rotate, right click, then rotate. </s>
<s> They tested that in house and said it worked. </s>
