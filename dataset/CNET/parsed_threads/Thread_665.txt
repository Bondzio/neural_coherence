<s> Hi everyone, my question is pretty straight forward. </s>
<s> The cell processor that is used to power the Playstation 3, does anyone know if I could purchase that processor as a stand alone and not as part of the PS3. </s>
<s> It is an awesome processor and a gigantic step forward, I would like to build my new PC around it, if it is available for purchase. </s>
<s> Thanks and happy thanksgiving. </s>
<s> but I am curious. </s>
<s> Could you load an OS to it? </s>
<s> If yes then why not try it that way. </s>
<s> If this processor is not of Intel or Amd, then you will have lots of problem getting a motherboard or design your own. </s>
<s> Is that what you are going to do? </s>
<s> So good luck and have fun. </s>
<s> you can get the linux os for ps3 and turn that into a &quot;pc&quot;, but you can't get a cell processor and motherboard to create a cell based pc. </s>
<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_microprocessor at the end supplies references and links of interest. </s>
<s> Personally I'd just look into (cheap) x86 SBCs. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Right now as a PS3 the cell processor is capable of booting the Debian Linux Kernel, with just some configs. </s>
<s> Although I use Linux and Windows in tangent I prefer Windows, in which case if I built a Cell based pc I would have to do some extensive configuring in order to allow Windows to boot, but it is possible. </s>
<s> In my opinion for the processor it is well worth it. </s>
<s> I am going to get a quad core x86 possibly either Xeon or Phenom architecture. </s>
<s> But looking at the Cell article I read, I was amazed at the the architecture and ability of the chip, and wondered if it was available. </s>
<s> You should skip it for some x86, a PS3 or if you are really wanting to get embedded, the ARM family. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ARMS were powerfull processors. </s>
<s> I thought that they were embedded for Pocket PC's and what not. </s>
<s> As for the dev kit, x86 emulators are available online for the Cell Processor, so you can run Windows in the emulating enviroment. </s>
<s> Which of course I know would limit the power of Windows over the hardware, but the emulator is open source and I thought maybe I could tweak it. </s>
<s> If not I could boot the debian Kernel then run a Virtual Machine or emulator program directory from the kernel. </s>
<s> As for a PS3 I wouldn't buy one for two reasons the first being I wouldn;t use it as a PC, it's a game console. </s>
<s> Second I wouldn't use it as a game system, I am an XBox fan and as such already have an XBOX which I enjoy. </s>
<s> All this was just a far off option one that I would have to consider when I came across it. </s>
<s> It was always my intention to go with an x86 processor, but I was curious if it was available for purchase. </s>
<s> If &quot;power&quot; is what you want why not skip right to the SUN (.com) platforms? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> But your reply is talking about ARM Embed Processors, correct? </s>
<s> As for the Sun comment, I do not follow. </s>
<s> Are you speaking of the Sun architecture or Solaris OS? </s>
<s> The Cell processor is something of a mystery to those that are new to embedded computing. </s>
<s> I wonder if you are aware of this subject as well as what a SBC is. </s>
<s> If not, I need to adjust my replies. </s>
<s> I'm getting the feeling you are not into such and should be (gently) shown more x86 gear. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> However I am aware of enough information on the topic. </s>
<s> The Cell processor itself is not an embedded computer chip it is a full fledge microprocessor connected to the board via a socket, not soldered on like an embed. </s>
<s> As far as SBC that is a Single Board Computer, it means everything needed to make a device a computing device is put onto one Circuit Board. </s>
<s> I am not interested in SBC, but I am pretty sure that the Cell Processor is not an embed. </s>
<s> You are looking for some &quot;system&quot; like we have in PCs where you get your CPU in some stock form for boards, etc. </s>
<s> This is pretty much a PowerPC and x86 phenom. </s>
<s> I suggest you dive into &quot;that other market&quot; and attend a few &quot;other than x86&quot; shows to get your feet wet. </s>
<s> Your replies mean that you should look at x86 gear. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> No Cell is not an embed it is a microprocessor that's why I asked if it was available for purchase. </s>
<s> Therefore I could buy the processor and then the corresponding socket motherboard, to build a PC. </s>
<s> And yes the cell processor is a Power RISC platform, not x86. </s>
<s> But I am able to get Windows to run on RISC without any problem that is why I am curious. </s>
<s> Some label the PS3 an &quot;embedded&quot; system. </s>
<s> And today people are using x86 for embedded systems. </s>
<s> This means the cell processor is not so limited to be this or not but let's skip to why I noted the embedded market. </s>
<s> It's where you would find your cpu. </s>
<s> Remember it won't work in your common x86 board so by itself it is pretty much like a paper weight. </s>
<s> Why isn't a SBC, PS3 or dev kit the answer for you? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Well I had read an article that stated that IBM was beginning to put Cell Chips in High End Servers, non embeded. </s>
<s> So I figured someone might know if they were available yet. </s>
<s> This was the reason for my posting. </s>
<s> SBC is not an option for me because it limits the design of my syswtem, in ways which would take to long to explain. </s>
<s> As for actually buying a PS3, I don't want one, I don't want to use the console as a PC and I am an XBOX fan and very satisfied with my 360. </s>
<s> Besides the PS3 to me says game console not computer, it may for other just not for me, I prefer to build my machines. </s>
<s> And like you said a dev kit costs thousands of dollars. </s>
<s> Therefore my question was answered the processor is not available, and I will stay within the x86-64 world. </s>
<s> No other Power RISC processor impresses me. </s>
<s> Thanks Bob </s>
