13997	0	345161	3056470	NR	SkittlesX333	6/5/09 8:34 PM	1.24423404E12	Motherboard Questions, Important!	I have a Pentium 4 HT 2.80Ghz LGA775 (Pretty much a brand new CPU) Socket, With a PCI-E card. (Nvidia 9400GT) and I need a new motherboard. I don't want to have to buy ALL new parts. here is the motherboard in question: http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3991769&CatId=1533 And I have G.Skill DDR2 PC2-4200 I was wondering if my RAM Will work with the motherboard in the link? It seems to be the best board in question for it's price. Thanks!

I tried running slower ram on faster bus speed board, never realising it until I've checked the specs of the board minimum bus speed for ram, and when I took out the slower ram, the system became stable... here's the link regarding RAM and their bus/ i/o speed so you'll know which ram model to lookout for http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR2_SDRAM

That looks like what you might recycle out of your common Dell, HP or other name desktop. When changing the motherboard from a name brand the OS license fails on the new board. Is that an issue here?

13997	5	345161	3056799	3056538	VAPCMD	6/6/09 7:32 AM	1.24427352E12	Should work but ....you may need to get new RAM. The good	news is, the RAM required DDR2-800 is faster than what you have and it's inexpensive. Get a kit with 2 DIMMs 1GB each to take advantage of dual channel memory architecture. VAPCMD

I don't have alot of money, and all the RAM, Video card and harddrives were pur chased just last year to upgrade the Dell. now I'd like to swap over the parts into a new board and in a new case so it's no longer dell.

But don't count on Windows that came with the Dell to run. It might, it might not and we don't have a leg to stand on to demand a new license. Bob

I'm just trying to replace the motherboard using the existing parts I have, The CPU, RAM, Video card, Hard drive, PSU, etc. All I need is the motherboard, I have everything else. I have a copy of XP, And Vista. tl;dr. Dell motherboard died, Has all new parts, Want to use parts out of the Dell (which aren't Dell Branded) Need motherboard compatable with a Intel Pentium 4 2.80Ghz Hyper threading Socket LGA 775, 04A CPU. I have PC2- DDR2-4200 RAM. PCI-E express video card, Sata harddrive.

13997	11	345161	3057186	3056937	SkittlesX333	6/6/09 9:58 PM	1.24432548E12	...Do what?	Yes, All the parts came out of a Dell. I just want a motherboard to use with the existing parts. My Pentium Four Hyper-threading LGA-775 O4A CPU, With my G.Skill DDR-4200 RAM. 2 x 1gb. My 9400Gt 512mb PCI-E card. That's all I ask. Will the motherboard I posted work with it?
13997	12	345161	3057292	3057186	R. Proffitt	6/7/09 4:23 AM	1.24434858E12	Define &quot;work.&quot;	Some may insist this means it's like a car. You change the tire and then get in and drive off. In this case it's not simple. You change the motherboard and while it does work the OS will not run. Your PC will not work as before. Windows is not running. The computer works but will likely need a fresh install of Windows but that OEM Windows may fail. I hope you see the problem. Bob
13997	13	345161	3057268	3057292	SkittlesX333	6/7/09 4:43 AM	1.24434978E12	Yes, I do	I've got the disk to fixed that. I have a Store-bought copy of XP and Vista.
13997	14	345161	3057303	3057268	R. Proffitt	6/7/09 4:54 AM	1.24435044E12	As you know.	While in theory it will work, in reality there is always something. It looks like you'll be OK but will you be upset if there is some issue? Bob
