thanks for the quick and helpful answers, bob!
i will move everything over to the new drive, and then make it the master.
is there a need to change anything in bios, or do i just switch the jumpers around and let the system boot up?
as far as transferring data, the new drive is a western digital and came with data lifeguard tools, which should do the trick, i believe.
i will then use the old drive as my back-up drive.
is it okay to just leave the old drive in as a slave, and back-up to that on occasion?
or is there a chance that if the system crashes, both drives could be obliterated?
and thanks for the tip about preferably limiting movie files to 1 hour.
sorry to ask more questions on top of my questions!
much appreciated!
