brandon: did you ever get an answer to this question.
i have searched high and low for the same capability, but all the cell phone makers and specialty stores give you a blank look.
surely, you and i are not the only geniuses on the planet?!
even with a blue-tooth enabled phone (mine a motorola v551) and blue-tooth pcoket-pc, i still need to go through an external modem to connect to an isp.
i would be interested in an update (dropbox999 at hotmail dot com) thanks.
