that type of behavior is what happened to my laptop burner just before it died.
fortunately, i had a 3 year warranty and it died in month 35. if your's is still under warranty, call it in.
otherwise, laptop burners are usually attached with a single screw on the bottom of the laptop.
unscrew it, pull out the drive, and push it back in to make sure its connector is seated firmly.
if that fails, a replacement drive is about $80.
here's an example:  determine the drive you have now, and make sure the replacement has the same dimensions.
