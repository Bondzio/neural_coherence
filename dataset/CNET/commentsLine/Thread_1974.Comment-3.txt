before you process this procedure, you need to modify the ip of your new dsl router, you can change it to 192.168.1.254, meanwhile pls disable the dhcp function.
the final step is manual configure your ip for your computer, set your set your ip as 192.168.1.250 and your gateway as 192.168.1.254. hope it can help your out!
