Hello Ive done something really stupid.
I sent my computer off for repair (Apple Powerbook G4) but as it was not going to be ready before I left on my travels I asked the repair company to send me my hard drive (60GB).
I put the hard drive in a caddy and connected it to my friends Mac (heres the stupid bit) I put an AC power source and not DC as it said on the caddy and now my friends (ex) USB port dosnt work nor does my hard drive.
I have tried it in a new caddy but it still does not work.
Does anybody have any ideas?
Cheers Lee
