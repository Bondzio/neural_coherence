hello - here is an odd problem that i appear to have temporarily fixed.
i have a 4-5 year old quad core dell inspiron.
i added 2 hard drives and set it up as raid 1 for the c: drive.
it came with 1 gb ram, i added 2. it had onboard video, i added a $50ish ati radeon.
it only has a 350 watt power supply, so i knew i was pushing it a bit - but it's ran fine for 4+ years.
typically i only shut the computer down once every week or two.
about two weeks ago, when i tried to power it up i only got a faint puff of energy and fan spin.
i pulled the power supply and had it tested - no problems.
i pulled all the hard drives, video, and memory out.
when i tried to power it up, it failed 1-2 times - but kicked on and issued mother board warning beeps.
i started adding hardware back and retrying.
it worked after every piece of hardware.
eventually, i had everything back and it was working fine.
it ran for a week or so, but for some reason i shut it off.
when i tried to turn it on the next morning - same problem, faint puff.
this time, i pulled the hardware piece by piece and retried.
it didn't work until all the memory was out (last step).
but again, it fired up and beeped warnings.
i re-added the pieces again and it worked.
so, my problem is temporarily fixed.
if it happens again, i'll pull the memory first... but obviously that's not a long term solution.
the other weird part is that when i initally rebooted it and it worked - it forgot my sata boot order.
i have 2 hds raided for c: and a spare d: for junk.
i'm not sure if this got hosed just because i disconnected the hard drives or if there is a problem in the bios or &quot;intel matrix storage manager&quot; that manages the raid.
i was wondering if anyone had ideas.
i can only assume there's something hosed up on the motherboard, but i can't see how plucking out and putting back the hardware magically fixes it.
thoughts?
