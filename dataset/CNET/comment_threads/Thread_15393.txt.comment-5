Go to Belarc.com and download Belarc Advisor.
Once you've installed and run Belarc Advisor...use the info from Belarc and go to Crucial.com.
Enter the info about your system and it will tell you exactly what RAM is available for your system and it's guaranteed to work.
If you do need more RAM ...and it must be installed in pairs you could get 2 DIMMs with 256MBs ea for 512 or 2 DIMMs with 512MBs for 1GB.
If you get 1GB..I recommend you put those in slots 0 and 1 and the old RAM in slots 2 and 3.
