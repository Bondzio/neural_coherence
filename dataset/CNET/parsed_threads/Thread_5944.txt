<s> I have a zr80,i want to connect the camcorder to my pc running win98,has a firewire port.Do i need additional software?Canon says no.But I am not getting anywhere.Help! </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Yes.I have found that win98 doesnt support firewire,but SE does.Is it true? </s>
<s> Could be wrong. </s>
<s> I had to load the software from a disc when I got my PCI Firewire card. </s>
<s> At the time 98se came out, Firewire was mostly Mac only. </s>
<s> If the motherboard came with Firewire plugs, maybe its not turned on in the BIOS or you didn't load the drivers from the motherboard disc. </s>

<s> You r righ,i installed it, but it still doesnt detect. </s>
<s> The zr80 has native drivers according to canon so i have not installed driver for the cam.Is this Ok. </s>
<s> You will have to install the drivers with Win98se. </s>
<s> With XP you would not have install the drivers. </s>

<s> Everything uses Windows XP as the default now. </s>
<s> If still using 9x Windows(like me), you have to manually load the 98 or ME drivers. </s>
<s> Happened to my Fuji also. </s>
