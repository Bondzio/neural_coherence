i have data still on my drive, i wanted to make a clone backup of the drive so i put the drive in a computer which had nothing but another blank drive tried to boot up with a drive cloning program which wouldn't recognize the drive anyway and ended up shutting it down.
from there the drive nolonger want to boot.
the drive pass all diagnosis test, and spins up ok. i now trying to find a way that i can plug this drive into a os that will recognize the data on it.
