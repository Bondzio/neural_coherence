<s> I recently changed my printer to a Samsung CLP 325 wireless model and it will not print from my Epson scanner. </s>
<s> I am thinking of buying a new Canon Canoscan Lide 210 scanner to replace the Epson. </s>
<s> Does anyone know if the Canon scanner is compatible with wireless printers? </s>
<s> Unless I put a PC in between I see the old idea of direct scan from a scanner to a printer to be a thing of the past unless you get one of those all in one units. </s>

<s> Thanks Bob, I have contacted Cannon support and they are unable to confirm if their scanner will definitely work with my Samsung Wireless printer. </s>
<s> Epson say their print untility feature on their scanners is only compatible with Epson printers. </s>
<s> Rather suggests that the technology is there but the software is not! </s>
<s> Thanks Glynn </s>
<s> It's pretty simple why this is. </s>
<s> Look at the mess that printers are today. </s>
<s> You find yourself installing drivers for each model. </s>
<s> There is rarely a time you find that the driver for the model 860 works with the 850. </s>
<s> (fictitious numbers) To cure that I would have to put a PC in the middle. </s>
<s> Why isn't the usual all-in-one a solution for you? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hi Bob I agree with your view on multiple drivers. </s>
<s> Maybe now outdated but I prefer the seperate scanner and printer configuration and for really good quality photo scans I think a dedicated unit is better. </s>
<s> For the moment I am just trying to find a decent scanner that will be compatible with my wireless Samsung printer. </s>
<s> The manufacturers support depts aren't much use as the reply is more often than not &quot;a definite maybe&quot; eg canon. </s>
<s> Not really much use unless you buy on a sale or return basis. </s>
<s> Hesi </s>
<s> I fear that such is long gone. </s>
<s> Given the mess this is, I think we are stuck with a PC in the middle. </s>
