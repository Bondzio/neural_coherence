<s> How is it going, my PC is making me ponder. </s>
<s> I have a 256 MB DDR 400 CL3 stick in a 3000+ AMD Sempron, my Q is why is my available physical memory only showing 30MB yet my total physical memory is 256MB. </s>
<s> I am running XP but the computer is only 1 month old and I am only running internet explorer on it, also if I want to upgrade my ram to hopefully solve that issue and have it run quicker, do I have to buy same brand or can I get any other brand as long as it is 256MB DDR 400 . </s>
<s> I have 4 slots on my memory area how much can I upgrade to? </s>
<s> a million thanx for being there... PS: Is there ever going to be the perfect computer? </s>
<s> 512 MB. </s>
<s> No need to buy the same brand. </s>
<s> If you have four slots, it makes me suspect that the mobo provides support for Dual Channel memory. </s>
<s> Are the four slots all the same color. </s>
<s> Maybe tell us what mobo you have. </s>
<s> Do you have the manual for the mobo? </s>
<s> That should tell you the maximum amount of memory the mobo will support and the largest size stick that you can put in one slot. </s>
<s> For me, re Dual Channel, I don't know if the Sempron's support Dual Channel. </s>
<s> Possible the mobo supports it for the big brother CPU but not for the reduced capability Sempron. </s>
<s> What Type CPU socket does the mobo use, 754, 939, or 940??? </s>
<s> The 30 MB memory issue is referring to memory not in use at that moment. </s>
<s> The Operating System will use as much memory that it needs at any moment. </s>
<s> When it runs low it uses Virtual Memory [page file][the hard drive] which then slows things down a little. </s>
<s> You can always check in task manager to see how much of each is being used. </s>
<s> Identify the memory type and upgrade options at Crucial.com by your computer brand and name. </s>
<s> After you find the type of memory and amount of memory each memory slot can handle, shop around. </s>
<s> -nklein </s>
<s> You may be using a virtual memory Operating System (OS). </s>
<s> Linux, Windows, MacOSX should use every scrap of RAM since RAM wins on speed compared to disk access. </s>
<s> When more RAM is needed, it's freed or something is swapped out. </s>
<s> The concept of &quot;free memory&quot; is something you worried about in non-VM OSes such as DOS. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Either Socket A or 754, thus they will NOT support dual channel. </s>
<s> If you have a socket 754 mobo, the only way you can use dual channel with it is to use a FX51 CPU and registered memory. </s>
<s> Thus no specific rules re putting in more same type memory. </s>
<s> Thanx for your message, regarding the memory slots I looked that up and it seems I have 4 total 2 blue color and 2 black color I cheched crucial.com and it seems I am only allowed DDR modules 400 CL3. </s>
<s> I am not sure what my mobo is since the PC was open box and it didn't come with any manuals nor discs. </s>
<s> Thanx for your help... </s>
<s> For some reason they were talking about you in the Speakeasy forums. </s>
<s> I personally don't like the Speakeasy forums, as I have issues with the people in them. </s>
<s> If you have that information ... see what the mfg recommends. </s>
<s> You could also go to Corsair.com and Crucial.com and see what they say works with your PC. </s>
<s> If it says you need DDR400/PC3200 unbuffered ...just go to NEWEGG.COM and buy this. </s>
<s> You'll never regret it and thank us forever....or at least for a while. </s>
