<s> Hello, I am looking for a washable, flexible, 109-key, USB full sized keyboard with, preferably, normal placement of the arrow keys, an enter key that is of a decent size (and is the backwards L type), a full sized backspace key, the full top row of f# keys, etc. </s>
<s> etc. </s>
<s> I don't know which brand of &quot;Flexible and Washable&quot; keyboards to get, or which model to get if I *do* decide. </s>
<s> Has anyone done a comparison of any of the keyboards from Seal Shield, Tripp Lite, Adesso, Grandtec, True Touch, Modtek, Targus, etc.? </s>
<s> Also, how can I figure out if one of these is just a rebranded version of another? </s>
<s> Which of these companies is still alive and supporting their product? </s>
<s> Do any of these keyboards have anything physically different with the f and j keys, to find the home keys by touch? </s>
<s> If so, which? </s>
<s> Which brands have the lowest incidents of stuck keys for their latest models? </s>
<s> I am in the States, and would like to pay under $40 for a keyboard (these seem to be relatively inexpensive, which does help! </s>
<s> ), and I don't know what to get. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated! </s>
<s> I have identified these models of being 'of interest'. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any thoughts on any of them, or any comparisons? </s>

<s> Pre-script: I took the liberty to clean up the detour. </s>

<s> Adesso, Targus are still in business. </s>
<s> The others I'm not so sure of. </s>

<s> That particular keyboard is REALLY hard to find on their webpage, but that does seem to be the model number! </s>
