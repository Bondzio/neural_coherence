Will any laptop optical drive fit my computer? Alienware recommended a site, but I was hoping to find better prices somewhere else. http://reviews.cnet.com/5200-7588-0.html?forumID=70# Submit

I wonder if the drive is just suffering from heat. In the US, try NEWEGG. Sadly, the Alienwares when they begin to degrade do tend to upset the owners. I wouldn't invest much in this. Bob
