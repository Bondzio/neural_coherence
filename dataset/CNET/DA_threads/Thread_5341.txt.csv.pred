1.1.1	I bought myself a 1 GB stick of RAM for an old Tower I had been using , but it has since died ( I 'm hoping the RAM stick did n't have anything to do with it ... ) .	St
1.1.2	I believe the RAM is DDR 1 .	St
1.1.3	So I 'm wondering , if I go and buy myself a new 3 GB equipped computer that uses DDR3 and I put the old stick in one of it 's spare slots ... will that helpmate computer in any way ?	Ques
1.1.4	Or would it just hinder it ?	Ques
1.2.1	I think the technical term for what I 'm asking is backwards compatibility .	St
1.3.1	*will that help the computer*	St
1.4.1	you can not put a DDR1 ram in a DDR3 socket .	St
1.4.2	It wo n't fit .	St
