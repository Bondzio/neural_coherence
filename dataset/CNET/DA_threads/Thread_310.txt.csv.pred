1.2.3	With the manual you v , it might take some time , bt I am sure you could decipher it .	St

1.3.1	I found a similar board manual that I am fairly sure has the same pinouts for switches/ leds etc .	St

1.4.1	with that vintage series .	St
1.4.2	They were actually proprietary mobos used in proprietary computers and poorly documented .	St
1.4.3	Found five varitations , compared item/location by item amd none acvtually matched .	St

1.5.1	If you intend on using the GA-6eX , to build a system it will be difficult if you do not have all the information .	St

1.5.4	http : //www.giga-byte.com/Products/Motherboard/Products_Spec.aspx ? ProductID=1495 But to get hardware for it will be hard it would be cheaper to get a barebone kit and start from there .	St

1.7.3	Again thanks	Polite
