Processor: Intel Core2 Quad Q9400 95W ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Produc...82E16819115131 ) Motherboard: MiniATX Intel BOXDQ45EK ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Produc...82E16813121358 ) Display: On-board Intel GMA 4500 (may upgrade to a high end nvidia card later) RAM: 4GB DDR2 800 HDD: 500gb SATA @ 7200 RPM + USB powered 500gb external drive (WD Passport) CD/DVD Burner: Yes Could you tell me what should be the minimum power supply wattage I should be looking at ? .. My guess is 375W. Also, I want to put this in a mini ITX box, but most miniITX boxes come with &lt;200W of PSU, so I'm going to have to buy a PSU seperately. Would a regular PSU fit in the miniITX case? .. or do they have a special powersupply size for them. Your comments on my chosen configuration and decision to go for MiniITX for this configuration are most welcome. thank you, regards, Puneet

11014	4	339329	3026593	3026332	ramarc	4/17/09 11:05 AM	1.2399663E12	consider a barebones instead	Asus P3-P5G33 it comes with a 220w power supply and a low-profile heatsink/cooler that exhausts hot air out the side vent. it can acommodate everything you've mentioned but it does get a bit loud with cpu-intensive activity. these asus barebones are getting hard-to-find however so you may want to look into msi's alternative. also consider getting a western digital &quot;green&quot; drive (5400-7200rpm adjustable). if you want to stick with a mini-itx combo, any unit with a 250w power supply will be adequate. (dell studio slim pc uses a 250w power supply for a q9550 quad core.) as for upgrading to a better video card, you won't find many that are low-profile and you'll have to measure the power supply of your case to determine what replacement alternatives you have. there is no mini-itx power supply standard size.

Cool, I love the barebones idea ! .. atleast that'll guarantee I do not screw up in PSU selection. as for the graphics card, I think I can let that go .. not going to game .. just going to use it as a media center PC with a 52&quot; TV .. i guess the GMA graphics chipset should work well for that ?
11014	6	339329	3026838	3026577	ramarc	4/17/09 6:23 PM	1.23999258E12	yes, the barebones i linked to has dvi output	the msi may have hdmi outputs. i've used the amd version of of this asus as a workstation/guest room pc with a 26&quot; lcd tv so i know it will work great as a home theater pc. i let my subcontractors/clients rdp into the it to do their work/see demos, and i let my neices/nephews use it as their pc when they spend a weekend.
