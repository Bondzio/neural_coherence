1.1.1	Hi , I am trying to understand something about IP addresses and subnets , say I have 3 computers , , , , all attached to a switch ... ... The first has a static IP address of 192.168.1.10 the second an IP address of 192.168.2.10 and the third an IP address of 192.168.1.11 , all have the subnet set as 255.255.255.0 , If I use the 192.168.1.10 machine as a master and ping the other 2 machines I have no problem getting a reply from 192.168.1.11 but I can not get a reply from 192.168.2.10 , i either get host unreachable or a time out message , depending on what I enter as a gateway IP address ( either 0.0.0.0 or 192.168.1.1 ) .	St
1.1.2	Without any other hardware and without changing IP addresses , ( subnets can change ) is it possible for me to ping both boxes from the master and get a reply .	St
1.1.3	If not what hardware would I need to use to make this possile .	St
1.1.4	Thanks a lot ,	St
1.2.1	If I want to ping a x.x.2.x .	St
1.2.2	machine from the x.x.1.x machine I change the mask to 255.255.0.0 or in the ROUTER set that up .	St
1.2.3	Since you did n't share what router I 'll go with easy .	St
1.2.4	There is no need to ask about subnet calculations given we have google .	St
1.3.1	Thank you , Which machine will I need to put the subnet 255.255.0.0 into , would I just put it on all 3 ?	Ques
1.3.2	What should I have the default gateway set to ?	Ques
1.3.3	I have no router just a hub that all 3 machines plug into !	St
1.3.4	Is n't 255.255.0.0 a class B mask which would mean that the IP address starts with something different to 192 ?	Ques
1.3.5	Thanks again ,	St
1.4.1	You do not have a router to route the packets around the subnets so in your case the subnet is simply 255.255.0.0 for any machine that needs to get from here to there .	St
1.4.2	Do n't over analyze this .	St
1.4.3	Do read up about it .	St
1.4.4	Let me be clear I am not offering any tutorial .	St
1.4.5	Just what netmask I 'd use to get the ping and more to work .	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	for what reason ?	Ques
1.6.1	I was trying to simplify my question and put it in a format that I would understand the answers .	St
1.6.2	Which I believe is what has happened so thank you .	St
1.6.3	The top and bottom is that I am trying to configure a number of TCP/IP devices that all need to talk to each other .	St
1.6.4	One of the devices a remote telemetary unit ( RTU ) has 2 ports which I have found out need to be configured on different subnets ( I did n't know this before , hence no router ) , these need to communicate up to other pieces of equipment which must be configured on the same subnet .	St
1.6.5	I have tried numerous combinations of IP addresses and subnets to get this to work without success , basically all the items ping round the system to check the other bits are alive , when/if they do n't get a reply an alarm is generated .	St
1.6.6	I ca n't clear the alarm because the items on one subnet ( 192.168.1.x ) can not communicate to the one on the other subnet ( 192.168.2.x ) , when I used one of the many subnet calculators available on the net they came up with 255.255.255.128 , I never got subnet 255.255.0.0 , guess I 'll give this a go on Monday when I get to work Thanks for the interest , any further comments or advise are welcome , Cheers ,	St
1.7.1	Thanks for the help .	St
1.7.2	This all works with a subnet of 255.255.0.0 Much appreciated ,	St
