<s> Hi, I'm in the market for a DVD+/- writer. </s>
<s> Given the newbie tag i've given myself, hopefully someone will heed my S.O.S </s>
<s> For all my cd/cd-rw/dvd/dvd burners i have only gone with Lite-On. </s>
<s> Very fast. </s>
<s> Reliable. </s>
<s> However if you want an extremly silent computer, sometimes these can be a little noisy when loading extreme amounts of data. </s>
<s> Not too loud, because i can tolerate it. </s>
<s> Try this one and see if it is what you are looking for: http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=27-106-961&depa=1 Tyler </s>
<s> and I like it a lot. </s>
<s> note i got a big discount from cirtcuit city by buying it thru their website and picking it up at their store-- buying it at the store was $40 more! </s>
<s> - fj note you may need nero burning rom for some things but the bundled software works very well. </s>
<s> Nero is great. </s>
<s> I most of the time find it cheapest online. </s>
<s> The one that i previously linked includes the Nero software and PowerDVD. </s>
