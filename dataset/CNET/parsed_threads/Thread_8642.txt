<s> Hi I'll explain what I want to do: I have a laptop running Windows XP that has a wireless card inside. </s>
<s> I have a Single Board Computer (SBC) running Linux that has an 'wireless access point' connected to one of it's Ethernet ports. </s>
<s> I want to be able to transfer data between the laptop and the SBC wirelessly (cabling is not an option) How do I achieve this? </s>
<s> I think most of the work will be involved configuring the wireless point and the SBC running Linux (Fedora). </s>
<s> The 'wireless access point' I am using is the EnGenius EOC5611P - it can be configured for: 1. </s>
<s> Access Point 2. </s>
<s> Client Bridge 3. </s>
<s> WDS Bridge 4. </s>
<s> Client Router I don't know which one of these I need,so working that out would be a good start! </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> You have quiet a few options that will work. </s>
<s> I would set it up as a access point so that if you ever want more wireless stuff to hook up it will be all set. </s>
<s> This is also the simplest to setup. </s>
<s> Still just to get started I would cable you pc to you other machine to get all the file sharing stuff working before you add a wireless layer to it. </s>
