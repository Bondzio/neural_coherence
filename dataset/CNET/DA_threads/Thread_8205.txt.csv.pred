1.1.1	Please / Thanks : Windows XP 5.1 SP3 ; just got the HP printer noted above ; it 's been sitting in an office for about five years , lonely ; worked fine , she says ; downloaded/installed what I could e-locate for the model ; my PC tells me all is well with the newbie , but when it comes printtime , the paper moves through appropriately , the appropriate sound of the ink mechanism moving back and forth is heard , but the grand result is , merely , a blank sheet of paper .

1.1.3	Shall I conclude that the souls of the ink cartridges have flown the bodies after having been unattended and unused for such a length of time ?	Ques
