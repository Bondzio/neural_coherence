Look at Intel.
Otherwise, you're better off saving the money and working with what you have.
A processor upgrade isn't a big deal, and even a 4200+ would be able to handle whatever you throw at it.
I know; I use one and have a 7900GT, and I have no problems running games at all.
Except Oblivion, of course...but who doesn't have problems with that?
Anyway, look at the X2 4x00+ line.
You won't be disappointed.
