<s> I'm home from college with my laptop (Apple Powerbook) sitting in my room without any internet. </s>
<s> My brother, one room over, has Road Runner. </s>
<s> I am confused as to what to buy if I want to share that internet connection with him wirelessly. </s>
<s> Do I get a router/gateway or an access point? </s>
<s> I'm a little confused. </s>
<s> Should I just buy a cable modem/wireless router all in one if I am planning on moving out anyway? </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> offered here&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.macworld.com/2002/07/reviews/routers/ will do. </s>
<s> Adding a wireless adapter to the Mac is all that's left. </s>
<s> I don't know about having to add an adapter to most of the new laptops now a days, unless I have been confused about this as well. </s>
<s> For most of the new laptops if it says they have wireless AirPort technology(Apple) or Wireless Centrino built in, doesn't this mean that the notebooks are ready to go? </s>
<s> For instance, I know my Powerbook has an 802.11 g and b capability built in. </s>
<s> I don't need to buy a receiver along with the router and plug that into the notebook do I? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> get an access point with a router capability (its a combo) Yes your laptop is already have a wireless adaptor built in... </s>
<s> Having a powerbook and wanting to go wireless, I figured this would be a good device to go with. </s>
<s> My question is this: If my brother has a PC that is connected to his cable modem, do I merely place the apple airport express in between his cable modem and PC, and then reap the benefits of having internet in my room wirelessly? </s>
<s> Is it that simple? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Modem --&gt;&gt; Router --&gt;&gt; PC in one port, and your airport express in another port. </s>
<s> You configure the airport express through an application/a utility in your powerbook. </s>
<s> Remember to disable dhcp in the airport express, let the router be the dhcp server. </s>
<s> If I don't necessarily want to create a network, but rather just want an internet connection can I just place a wireless router (I have wireless capability) in between my brothers cable modem and computer? </s>
<s> My concern is if incorporating a router would mess with his internet connection? </s>
<s> I assume I could do all this and then just set up the router on my computer. </s>
<s> Any input would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> the wireless access point have be connected to the modem .. </s>
<s> Since the modem only have one port, you need a router, to be able to connect your brother pc and your wireless access point... </s>
<s> Unless its a modem/router combo.. Modem --&gt;&gt; Router --&gt;&gt; PC and wireless access point (each connected to the router port) </s>
