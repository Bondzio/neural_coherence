There have been attempts to do so in software or via file systems, but this doesn't work like the solid switch or slide on floppies (remember those) or tapes.
CDR/W and DVDR/W are rendered unwritable by placing such in a DVD or CD drive that can't write.
This area is full of solutions but no one can agree on best.
The usual office backup is a central server to store the files that need backup, then some tape drive to cart the data off site in case of a disaster.
This all starts when the person responsible writes... &quot;My business's Disaster Recovery Plan&quot;.
The drive you spoke of will do in a pinch, but is not &quot;backup&quot;.
It's a volatile copy.
