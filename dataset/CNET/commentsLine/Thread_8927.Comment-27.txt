i have that monitor and love it.
i am not a high speed gamer myself, but i let my son hook it up to his computer.
he is a gamer, as a matter of fact he makes his living in the development of such games for one of the big companies in the field.
his report: it's the first time he could play at full speed and high resolution on an lcd monitor without experiencing &quot;ghosting&quot;.
