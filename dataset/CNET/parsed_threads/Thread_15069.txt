<s> Hello, I do graphic/web design, and wondered if there was a specific Gateway laptop that works best for this purpose. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I would say the Gateway M520 only because it has a P4 for your purposes. </s>
<s> But maybe a Centrino might work? </s>
<s> Idk. </s>
<s> Anyone out there? </s>
<s> The Pentium M(Centrino can be Celeron M or Pentium M, go for the latter) has been known to outperform the Pentium 4 in performance, battery life, and heat. </s>
<s> The 600 series of P4 can heat the surface to 140F. </s>
<s> Ouch. </s>
<s> However, have you looked at other brands as well? </s>
<s> I tend to go toward AMD processors because they are faster for a lower price. </s>

<s> http://abspc.com/app/config.asp?mono=1884 pentium m = greatness even outperforming pentium 4s in games. </s>
<s> ddr2 = slight performance gain over ddr nvidia 6600go = while not as powerful as a 6800go, this gpu will still tackle anything you throw at it asus z71v = one of the best barebook/notebook on the market today. </s>
<s> gamers prefer this notebook for its superb overclocking ability with both the cpu and the gpu. </s>

<s> There are posts in these forums lamenting such decisions. </s>
<s> Backup your advice with where the support comes from as well as the spare parts issues in year 2 and 3... Bob </s>
