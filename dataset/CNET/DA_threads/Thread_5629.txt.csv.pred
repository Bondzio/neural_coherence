1.1.1	Help !	St
1.1.2	Ok , simple PC-PC network for file sharing and maybe internet access .	St
1.1.3	My old WINME is set up fine and is connected to the same workgroup as my new WINXP machine .	St
1.1.4	The underlying connection is fine , since a steady green light indicates this with both NIC cards and WINXP says it is & quot ; Connected & quot ; in the & quot ; Network Connections & quot ; screen .	St
1.1.5	However , when trying to ping test , the & quot ; Request timed out & quot ; is shown .	St
1.1.6	Both have unique IP ADDRESSES , tried 10.10.0.1 and 10.10.0.2 and tried the other 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.0.2 but no success .	St
1.1.7	The computer names are unique , workgroups identical , including CAPS .	St
1.1.8	What is weird is that the ME machine shows the shared files in the Workgroup , but the XP machine gives me an error , like & quot ; ( workgroup ) not available..check with your system admin if you have rights.. & quot ; .	St
1.1.9	This does n't make sense , I 'm the only one and I am a system admin .	St
1.1.10	Also , I 'm connecting via a CAT6 crossover cable , since a hub is not necessary for PC-PC .	St
1.1.11	I thought this would be the quickest and cheapest way to access , but it looks like it is causing more headaches .	St
1.1.12	Any suggestions ?	Ques
1.1.13	Thanks .	Polite
1.1.14	Also , note that I have another ethernet connection ( on-board connector , not another NIC card ) to my DSL which works fine and is set up to auto configure IP address and there does not seem to be any conflicts between the two devices .	St
1.2.1	Still the number one gaffe is the firewall is installed or if the XP Firewall , enabled .	St
1.2.2	Zonealarm has no true disable .	Res
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Well , I turned off the Windows Firewall and still would not connect .	St
1.3.2	I 'm using Norton , not ZoneAlarm .	St
1.3.3	Any other suggestions ?	Ques
1.3.4	Unless the Win Firewall is still on .	St
1.3.5	How do I check for sure ?	Ques
1.3.6	I believe it is in the control panel , but I 'll have to check later .	St
1.3.7	Thanks .	Polite
1.4.1	Still remains the number one cause of this issue .	St
1.4.2	I offer no support for the Norton product since ... that 's their job and my choice .	St
1.4.3	All I can do is note the issue .	St
1.4.4	Look over these site for more clues - & gt ; http : //www.networkmagic.com/ http : //www.practicallynetworked.com and http : //www.wown.com Bob	St
1.5.1	Makes sense .	St
1.5.2	I 'll try pinging to each computer itself using the loopback address to see which one is the culprit .	St
1.5.3	But , was wondering if NetBios over TCP/IP should be disabled or if that setting does n't matter for this connection type ?	Ques
1.6.1	The firewall blocks sharing or browsing so you have to rip the firewall out or learn how to allow/trust your network .	St
1.6.2	NBT or Netbios over TCP/IP should be enabled by default .	St
1.6.3	If you research how the stock sharing over TCP/IP works , you 'll run into this .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	XP Pro on standard install does not include PTP networking .	St
1.7.2	Go to the control panel , add windows components and add the PTP .	St
1.7.3	On the XP , Run ... CMD to get a DOS window .	St
1.7.4	Enter IPCONFIG /ALL and ensure that your dsl is not on the same IP subnet .	St
1.8.1	I did n't add this to some hundred machines this year ... and it works without me doing such a step for XP , home/pro and more .	St
1.8.2	Why ?	Ques
1.8.3	Bob	St
1.9.1	Well , thanks for all the help guys ...	Polite
1.9.2	The firewall was modified to only allow my two computers to be in the trusted zone .	St
1.9.3	I attempted pinging each to the other PC and it was successful .	St
1.9.4	However , now , I can see only my workgroup computer for the ME machine ONLY on the ME machine and the shared folders I set up .	St
1.9.5	But , on XP , no folders at all when I try to view the workgroup , not even the XP machine is shown .	St
1.9.6	Instead , I get an error like & quot ; Ca n't access , not allowed to see computers on this network.. & quot ; or something like that .	St
1.9.7	Is that due to not allowing PTP networking ?	Ques
1.9.8	If so , should I try the above fix ?	Ques
1.9.9	Thanks .	Polite
1.10.1	is when you try to share the the internet connection , your computers become a part two totally different networks .	St
1.10.2	You may share folders when you are on the same network .	St
1.10.3	I believe one of your computers is getting its address from your dsl connection on one nic , and the other nic crossed over to the other computer , when internet connection sharing is enabled , is setting a default address of 192.168.0.1 which is typical of windows .	St
1.10.4	Your computer with two nics is a part of the dhcp enabled network and your other computer is a part of another network created when you enabled ICS .	St
1.10.5	Two totally different networks , but your second computer can now have internet access .	St
1.10.6	You just sacrifice the sharing abilities .	St
1.10.7	Get a router with a four port switch and your problems are solved .	St
1.10.8	Both will share printer and files and internet connection and the router becomes additional defense to others attempting to access or & quot ; see & quot ; your local network and computers .	St
1.10.9	A kind of hardware firewall .	St
1.11.1	First : In two NIC and ICS running , usually there is a configuration for each NIC ( in IE , Tools , Internet Options , Connections , LAN Setting ) one for file sharing and the other for internet access ... You have to know which NIC for each .	St
1.11.2	Second : prior to windows XP days , you might have to uninstall and reinstall ICS and remove and add TCP/IP protocol .	St
1.11.3	Third : Check your TCP/IP binding.. ( in windows ME , tcp/ip should be 'binding ' to client microsoft network and file and printer sharing ) -- ( in stand alone win 9x/me , this should be unbind ) .	St
1.11.4	Again its only a few thought ...	St
