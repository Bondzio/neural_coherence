I don't usually duplicate the Ubuntu site.
Use their site and tutorials and it's usually fine.
That is, I usually find folk are making up something undocumented and wondering why it doesn't work.
There is a clue &quot;I tired to eject the usb and message said the file was in use by system but could not see anything&quot; as that tells me you did not boot from the USB drive.
