Is this one of those old Socket A systems?
As they age you might find some BAD CAPS (see google.com) and the fix is to replace the boards with the bad caps.
I can assure you the reason for the crash is not revealed in your post.
The clues are not there.
Keep telling more and try to tell about your PC since you may not have 1 GHz of memory.
