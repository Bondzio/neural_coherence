Hi I want to buy a portable hard drive (2.5&quot; inch external with casing). 250 GB seems appropriate capacity for me. I have used two portable hard drives (Hitachi Travelstar, 80GB and 160GB, bought without enclosure and fixed into one later). Both of them seem to be working fine still. One for about 2 years and another one for 8 months. Now I am not too sure which company to rely on. Hitachi don't make drives like WD and others which come packed into the casing. Is it a better idea to buy a hard drive and its enclosure separately ? OR the ones (that come with enclosures) sold by manufacturers are 'more' reliable? I am looking at Toshiba, WD, LaCie, Iomega. Not too sure which one to go with. Any advice or personal experiences will be really helpful. Thanks

This way you know the thing works or don't work. If it doesn't work then just return it; no decession as to which part of the unit is bad. Personally I always build mine (3.5&quot;) and I have used maxtor, WD, etc. which ever give me the best bargain. I found these thing are fairly reliable. Just my thought.

Only choice because &quot;Costco is cheaper&quot; is what my parents say but in the end I choosed between 150 and 250. Pros: -Comes with WD syn -Small -From 60-250GB Cons: -The wire is small I got mine around 90$ to back up my dad's music one day when the music was missing due to system recovery long time ago.
