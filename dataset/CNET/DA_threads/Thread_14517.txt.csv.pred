1.1.1	When attempting to install windows XP on a recently built computer , i get the message that the hard disk and BIOS are not installed .	St
1.1.2	I can access the BIOS without any problem , but how do i tell if the HDD is installed properly ?	Ques
1.1.3	The HDD is connected and powered on , so why is it not recognized by windows ?	Ques
1.1.4	Any help would be appreciated .	Polite
1.1.5	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	While you did n't share the message about the bios not installed , there is a common message like that but it is not a failure but informational .	St
1.2.2	I often disable the message so the owner is n't confused by it .	St
1.2.3	Many do n't know a new drive will have to be prepared for use .	St
1.2.4	With XP we use the DRIVE MANAGEMENT tool noted in XP 's Start , Help and Support .	St
1.2.5	This preperation is not optional .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	The XP Drive management whatever you said probably wo n't help since XP wo n't install .	St
1.3.2	I believe the problem is that a RAID Driver needs to be installed from a supplied CD , but the computer in question has only one CD drive .	St
1.3.3	When the XP cd is taken out , it wo n't continue with installation , even to install the drivers from the supplied CD .	St
1.3.4	It looks like another CD drive is going to be in order .	St
1.4.1	I was under the misimpression this was a new drive added to a working system .	St
1.4.2	- & gt ; Here 's the deal .	St
1.4.3	With your new information it appears you have some custom machine that you placed a hard disk on a nonstandard RAID IDE connection .	St
1.4.4	Since you do n't have multiple drives this is a mistake in setup .	St
1.4.5	Also your post is void of all makes and models so I can only offer the best move is to move the drive to the normal first IDE channel and attempt a normal setup .	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	i 'm not the one building this computer , i 'm just posting questions since the builder ca n't .	St
1.5.2	( obviously ) is there a good guide that will take us through installing a hard drive , including both physical installation and partitioning and formatting the drive ?	Ques
1.5.3	I would like to go back and double check that everything has been done correctly up to this point .	St
1.5.4	If possible , i would like a guide that goes into detail about some problems we might encounter ( like the current one ) as well .	St
1.5.5	thanks again .	Polite
1.6.1	There are hundreds of sites on how to build a PC , none could cover what could go wrong .	St
1.6.2	I 've learned that going with the plain setups is best for new builders .	St
1.6.3	That is , using the plain IDE port the first time .	St
1.6.4	RAID , in this case is not called for since we have one drive .	St
1.6.5	Best of luck , Bob	Polite
1.7.1	If so , you may indeed need to install a third party driver to get XP to recognize the drive .	St
1.7.2	This is usually done by hitting F6 when prompted during initial installation and then installing the driver from a floppy .	St
1.7.3	I would check with the motherboard manufacturer and see if they provide SATA/RAID drivers that you can put on a floppy , or perhaps copy them from the provided CD .	Sug
1.7.4	There should be instructions either in the mobo manual or online .	St
1.8.1	this is the conclusion i have come to as well , after looking through a few guides and such .	St
1.8.2	unfortunately , the builder had decided not to put in a flopy drive at all .	St
1.8.3	that will obviously be changing .	St
1.8.4	i will post an answer if this turns out to be the problem .	St
