my 802.11g connection on my toshiba a-35 notebook (xp) allows me to drink beer in my back yard and surf the internet as it communicates with my 802.11b linksys wireless 4-port router that provides cable modem access.
but now, i want the same mobility that will allow me to sit on the beach at galveston; or sit on the river bank in big bend nat'l park; or as a passenger in a car driving to dallas; and i want broadband fast connectivity.
is this possible yet?
details....?
