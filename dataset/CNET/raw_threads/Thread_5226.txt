To determine this, launch the Printer Setup Utility. (Given the lack of requested information, I'm assuming OS X here) Highlight (Select) your Epson r200 and then click on the Show Info button in the tool bar. In the resulting window, you should see the Driver information. If there is a number like 5.x or the word Beta, then you are not actually using the Epson driver. Let us know P

Failing that, select your printer and press the Apple Key (Next to spacebar) and the letter I [+]

The machine is standard and there are no additions except for a Bamboo tablet. I'm sorry I did add this information to the end of my last post but probably not the way to work it.
