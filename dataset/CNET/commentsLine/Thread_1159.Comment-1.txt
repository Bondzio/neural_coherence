hello, i finished building my system, installed windows, etc and everything was running fine.
suddenly the power shuts off.
when i tried to turn it back on, the power, fans etc would all turn on for a 1 sec and turn back off.
then it finally stayed off.
long story short, i ended up buying a new psu and mobo.
same thing happens.
i isolated the problem to the atx 12v 4 pin connector.
when it's plugged in, the mobo won't turn on but when i unplug it, the mobo will turn on.
does this mean my cpu is fried?
any help would be appreciated.
thanks.
p.s.
this problem occurs on both identical mobos.
troubleshooting with just the 24 pin and 4 pin connected.
specs: mobo: ecs gf7100pvt-m3 psu: thermaltake purepower 500 atx 12v 2.0 cpu: pentium d 3 ghz ram: 2gb
