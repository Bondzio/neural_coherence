I am thinking of buying a new Canon Canoscan Lide 210 scanner to replace the Epson. Does anyone know if the Canon scanner is compatible with wireless printers?

Epson say their print untility feature on their scanners is only compatible with Epson printers. Rather suggests that the technology is there but the software is not! Thanks Glynn

You find yourself installing drivers for each model. There is rarely a time you find that the driver for the model 860 works with the 850. (fictitious numbers) To cure that I would have to put a PC in the middle. Why isn't the usual all-in-one a solution for you? Bob

Maybe now outdated but I prefer the seperate scanner and printer configuration and for really good quality photo scans I think a dedicated unit is better. For the moment I am just trying to find a decent scanner that will be compatible with my wireless Samsung printer. The manufacturers support depts aren't much use as the reply is more often than not &quot;a definite maybe&quot; eg canon. Not really much use unless you buy on a sale or return basis. Hesi
