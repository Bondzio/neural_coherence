<s> My wife has a Compaq 2596US laptop running WIN XP Home, which came with a wireless Broadcom adapter (card? </s>
<s> what do you call it?) </s>
<s> built in. </s>
<s> We have a D-Link DI-624 router and cable internet. </s>
<s> If the laptop is connected via cable, everything is fine. </s>
<s> However, if we try to use wireless connectivity, the laptop reports &quot;excellent&quot; signal strength. </s>
<s> After about 2 minutes, however, it reports that there is NO signal. </s>
<s> A few seconds to a minute later, it tells us &quot;Oh, look; I've detected a wireless signal with 'excellent' strength.&quot; This on-again off-again cycle is repeated until we give up and run a cable. </s>
<s> We have the latest firmware for the NIC and the router. </s>
<s> The &quot;help for idiots&quot; supplied by the ISP says the computer cannot obtain a valid IP address from the server, and says the problem might be in the cable connections, the modem, or the NIC. </s>
<s> The laptop says the wireless NIC is just fine, thank you. </s>
<s> HP/Compaq has a wireless setup wizard, which we attempted to run. </s>
<s> It told us that it couldn't help us because we didn't meet the &quot;minimum configuration&quot;, but didn't mention what it found lacking. </s>
<s> Via e-mail, HP takes one of three routes: either 1] download and install the patches for the wireless NIC; 2] it is the router's fault; or 3] they don't respond at all. </s>
<s> D-Link says they can't see anything in the router, and suggests that we either call HP/Compaq or get another wireless device and if IT also has problems, to call them back. </s>
<s> If anyone can suggest a fix, we would be very appreciative. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> The router has current (latest) firmware. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> You've tried it without WEP, WAP, MAC filtering. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> You've tried another router. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> The machine has no spyware. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> I'm afraid that I need more help: 1 -- router has latest firmware 2 -- I don't understand this one: what are they and I do I try it without them? </s>
<s> 3 -- No: I don't have another router to try. </s>
<s> 4 -- Correct, per Spybot A&D and Hijack This!. </s>
<s> Thanks, Mark </s>
<s> These are settings in the router and ... written about in its manual. </s>
<s> For a test run, I always turn such off (see manual or http://money.howstuffworks.com/wireless-network5.htm ). </s>
<s> I've run into routers that don't work with all cards. </s>
<s> It's becoming a fact that the person servicing such networks will &quot;have a spare&quot;. </s>

<s> Hi Mark3316, I just purchased a Compaq R3000Z laptop with the built in Broadcom wireless. </s>
<s> I received it yesterday and have been having the same issue. </s>
<s> I spent 2 hours on the phone with tech support tonight. </s>
<s> We went thru all the normal things with no luck. </s>
<s> The tech put me on hold for about 10 minutes. </s>
<s> When he returned, he told me that this is a known bug with the built in Broadcom wireless and Windows XP SP2. </s>
<s> Do you have SP2 installed? </s>
<s> Mine came with it pre-installed. </s>
<s> Unfortunatly, the tech could not find the 'patch' he wanted. </s>
<s> We tried one but it did not help. </s>
<s> He's going to do more research and call me tomorrow around 4pm Eastern US time. </s>
<s> I'll post the results in case they help you. </s>
<s> I just so happen to have 2 R3000's with the broadcom cards and ... SP2. </s>
<s> It works just dandy everywhere I go. </s>
<s> Very odd. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> This is my second R3000. </s>
<s> I bought one about 6 months ago and then a new one 2 days ago. </s>
<s> From what I can see in the system information (Sandra), it looks like the Broadcom chips are different. </s>
<s> The first R3000 has worked perfectly since I got it. </s>
<s> I'm expecting a call from HP tech support around 4pm today, so we'll see if the tech knows what's talking about. </s>
<s> I was suspecting a bad wireless card until I found the posting from Mike and talked to tech support. </s>
<s> I'll keep you informed. </s>
<s> I worked with a tech tonight who had me make a change to the boot.ini file. </s>
<s> Once I did that and rebooted the machine. </s>
<s> The problem seemed fixed. </s>
<s> The change was to add the /execute=optin parameter. </s>
<s> I've heard of such an issue, but in every case it shows faults in the driver code for the product and not a flaw in XP. </s>
<s> I agree that its a valid fix till new drivers arrive. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I wouldn't be surprised if it was the driver. </s>
<s> At one point the tech had me load the newest driver he could find which was dated March 16th,2005. </s>
<s> It didn't help, but it certainly indicates that they are upgrading the drivers. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help Bob. </s>
<s> Jim </s>
<s> Hi : could you tell us exactly which boot.ini file, and does that go on a line by itself or at the end of some other line? </s>
<s> I have a new R3430US with XP SP2 and it can see the neighbor's Linsys router but not my Netgear one... Dave </s>
<s> Hi Dave, I don't have the details with me right now, but I'll try and post them later. </s>
<s> I can say that the parameter is on a pre-existing line that specifies the operating system also. </s>
<s> The symptom I saw was that the tcpip service kept stopping and restarting. </s>
<s> I could always see my router. </s>
<s> I just could not stay connected to it. </s>
<s> Sounds like your problem may be different. </s>
<s> Is your router set to broadcast it's SSID? </s>
<s> I found HP's support to be very good. </s>
<s> This was the first time I used them, but they didn't give me the run around and got to the problem. </s>
<s> I had to have them call me back because they couldn't find the solution right away, but they did have something within one day. </s>
<s> Jim </s>
<s> My problem probably is different: my new R3240US can see the SSID from my neighbor's Linksys router, but not the one from my own Netgear WGT634U, which I know is working with another notebook with a Netgear wireless card. </s>
<s> HP did answer within an hour, but only to suggest I check the router to be sure it is compatible with the Broadcom b/g card in the notebook, which of course it is. </s>
<s> I thought if your fix was easy, I'd try it. </s>
<s> Gagco, thanks for the information. </s>
<s> The folks I got hold of at HP tech support were obviously heading down the driver path, but when I told them that I [at that time] had the newest drivers, they lapsed into &quot;well, then it isn't our problem&quot; mode. </s>
<s> My wife currently has the laptop and she is off giving presentations at a couple of seminars. </s>
<s> She informs me that at the seminar sites and hotels she has stayed at, she has stayed connected to the various wireless networks without problem. </s>
<s> Of course, at the seminar sites there has been a &quot;tech guy&quot; to get her connected, so I don't know what setup they are using. </s>
<s> RProffitt, I'm sure that people whose occupation involves servicing networks have spare routers they can swap in. </s>
<s> Since I don't do that for a living, I can't see going out and buying extra hardware to use as a test bench. </s>
<s> It is hard for me to believe that many people would have &quot;spare&quot; routers, wireless cards, or whatever if they are just trying to get a home network set up, and I assume that from my posts you didn't mistake me for a network administrator or IT professional, so I am puzzled by the assumptions you seem to be making, and the unexplained jargon you use, in your posts. </s>
<s> Regarding your first response to my original post, I did have WEP, WAP, etc turned off. </s>
<s> Hi, I had exactly the same problems, due to SP2. </s>
<s> What's strange is that the problem only manifested itself on certain routers. </s>
<s> Ok anyway, the solution was to go to My Network Places, and on the left click &quot;Hide icons for networked UPnP devices&quot;. </s>
<s> There is probably another way to disable this constant searching, but using the common task pane worked for me. </s>
<s> Hope it helps someone. </s>
<s> Also had to switch my router (by visiting 192.168.0.1 in the browser) to use the correct channel. </s>
<s> My previous laptop wireless card was intelligent enough to switch/scan channels. </s>
<s> This one kept reverting to 11 when the router was set to 10. </s>
