same drive, Ritek DVD-R 4x blanks (same pack i'd used last summer to burn 40 discs without a single coaster), and Nero.
i get errors using Roxio 6 Classic too, so i don't think i can blame the apps, although i still can't eliminate XP as the cause (may be the first time i've tried burning DVDs since i installed SP2...) but maybe i'm clutching at straws.
at this point, i'm about ready to drop $40-$50 for a 16x drive :^O
