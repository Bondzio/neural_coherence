<s> I have a old &quot;Thumb Drive Trek&quot; it is about 4 years old and I cannot use it without driver installation. </s>
<s> I cannot use this drive with any other computers without installation the driver It is very inconvenient. </s>
<s> So is there any possibility to use this Thumb Drive without driver? </s>
<s> Looking for your help and advice. </s>
<s> Windows XP has built-in drivers for most thumb drives, but it is possible they may not work for some particular drives. </s>
<s> Win 98 does not have such drivers built in, so you must load it yourself; and yes, you must have a driver installed. </s>
<s> However, you only need do that once for each machine, so it should not be a big deal -- unless you are working with a lot of different systems. </s>
<s> If XP does not support this drive, then the answer for Win 98 applies. </s>
<s> Or you could get a new thumb drive that is supported; they are quite inexpensive now. </s>
<s> Hope this helps Frank </s>
<s> My OS is Windows XP SP 2 with latest updates. </s>
<s> My Thumbs Drive is an old one so it is the cause of this problem I think.I have checked their website also but they have only the new products and cannot find any solution of my old Thumbs Drive. </s>
<s> I think it is time to change a new one. </s>
