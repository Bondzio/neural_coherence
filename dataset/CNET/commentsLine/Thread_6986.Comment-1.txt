im having issues with my video card.
awhile back it just started flickering and freezing up on me.
so i assumed it was the card itself.
i switched to the onboard video and have no problems.
yet when i uninstall the driver for my plug and play card i can then put that card back in and as long as i dont update the card and use the default monitor it does not do any flickering or freezing.
so im not exactly sure its the card because as long as i dont update it and use default driver for it, it works fine just without any 3d.
by the way its a nvidia geforce4 mx420.any suggestions would be appreciated.
