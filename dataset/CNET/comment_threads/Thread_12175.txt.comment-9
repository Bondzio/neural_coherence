As a Storage/Backup Engineer for a large international company, we have a running joke.
No one cares whether you do backups.
All they care to see are successful restores.
Point is - unless you are doing something to ensure that whatever method you are using to backup/copy your data is &quot;reversible&quot;, i.e.
unless you are capable of getting that data back in a usable format, then all the backups in the world are of no value.
So don't just backup - perform test restores of that data on a regular basis.
