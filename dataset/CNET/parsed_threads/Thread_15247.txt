<s> So, I have an approximately 13 year old Toshiba infinia, and I want to make it the best pc it can be.It was originally designed for windows 95, though it was later upgraded to windows 98. </s>
<s> Now, given how quickly stuff gets outdated in the world of computers, I am assuming that even the best stuff that was ever made for computers of its' day are going to be woefully outdated, and subsequentally, dirt cheap. </s>
<s> first off, I want to give it more ram. </s>
<s> I am not sure which model of the infinia series it is, so I am not sure how much it can take. </s>
<s> What will happen if I put more in than it was designed to have? </s>
<s> It currently has 64mb. </s>
<s> Second, I want to put in a better video card. </s>
<s> It currently has a . </s>
<s> Then, if it is possible, I would love to put in a faster processor. </s>
<s> It currently has the Pentium MMX. </s>
<s> what I want to know from you guys is how new can I can go before stuff will be incompatible with my machine. </s>
<s> For instance, there is one particular line of nvideas's video cards that will work with my modern pc. </s>
<s> Which line (and what brand) would work for my infinia? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> GRRR! </s>
<s> There is no edit feature here! </s>
<s> Oww well, I just wanted to say it is windows 98SE, and the current video card is unknown, as there is a bunch of stuff in that category in system information. </s>
<s> I have a 10 yr old machine running w98...it works fine. </s>
<s> Would I put any money into it?...no. </s>
<s> Even if you find parts that will fit...you might be shocked at the cost. </s>
<s> The second problem is MS does not support the OS and utils that support that OS are getting scarce. </s>
<s> Your call. </s>
<s> Yes, I want to do it. </s>
<s> If, after I price the parts, I don't think it's worth it, then I won't proceed. </s>
<s> and if you want to upgrade get a new computer. </s>
<s> 13 years is more than twice the life-expectancy of what most consumers keep computers for. </s>
<s> The computing power of that machine is far below even the iphone i think. </s>
<s> Okay, let me clear this up. </s>
<s> Yes, I really want to do this (unless it is just ridiculously expensive), no I can't just get a new computer. </s>
<s> I have a modern computer. </s>
<s> It is the family computer. </s>
<s> The one I want to fix up is my computer. </s>
<s> I use it for my music, and to play old computer games that are not compatible with the computers of today. </s>
<s> I want to upgrade it so that it does these two things better, and so I can use to for any other off-line stuff I need to do. </s>
<s> So, with that out of the way, I would be eternally grateful if someone would be so kind as to answer my question. </s>
<s> Lets start with the ram. </s>
<s> Go here..... http://www.crucial.com/ Let it run it's ram finder scan. </s>
<s> That should give you an idea of how much ram the machine can take and what the cost is. </s>
<s> 256MB seems like a sweet spot. </s>
<s> Next we need to know the make and model of the machine so we can try and find a vid card that will fit. </s>
<s> Here I see free PCs being discarded on freecycle that are much faster than yours. </s>
<s> You could scavenge parts or use one of those. </s>
<s> Your question is well understood but since the budget looks like zero look to freecycle (see google) to see what people are giving away. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I am in the USA. </s>
<s> I actually got this computer from freecycle, lol. </s>
<s> I'll look around for other computers to cnanabalize, but, like I said, I want to try and get the best stuff possible for it. </s>
<s> This method will give me much less control.......And what about the ram? </s>
<s> (see original post) </s>
<s> Go get more. </s>
<s> You can see at crucial.com what is compatible but DO NOT exceed 512MB for Windows 95,98 and ME. </s>
<s> okay, the pc is not connected to the internet. </s>
<s> Do you know of any sort of downloadable tool that will give me the information I need? </s>
<s> I found a nice little tool that ells everything about my system. </s>
<s> It created a web page file thingy with all the info. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I cannot add attachments tot these posts, and I am not sure if this link will work for you, but please give it a shot file:///F:/Belarc%20Advisor%20Current%20Profile.htm </s>
<s> Hear ye, hear ye! </s>
<s> I just created a web-page. </s>
<s> http://www.freewebs.com/mypcinfo/Belarc%20Advisor%20Current%20Profile.htm If you have any questions about my system, the answers are there. </s>
<s> http://www.activewin.com/tips/hardware_5.html In short you should stop at 64MB RAM on this beast. </s>
<s> Not only does the speed nosedive (actually crash is more accurate) but finding the tag ram today is nearly impossible. </s>
<s> -&gt; Time to hit freecycle for ANYTHING being tossed today so you'll get away from this anchor. </s>
<s> Oops, this machine doesn't make a good anchor!!! </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It says intel pentium with MMX technology. </s>
<s> I have also learned that mine is 200 mhz. </s>
<s> I googled it,and it appears to be completely different from the one you are talking about. </s>
<s> Please look at the page. </s>
<s> It has four sockets for ram, and it says nothing about a tag ram socket, so hopefully that won't be an issue. </s>
<s> I have decided to go with two more 32mb ram cards (I just made the name up, as I didn't know what to call them) giving me 128mb of ram. </s>
<s> Now, the next item on my list is a video card. </s>
<s> I really am in need of assistance on this one..... </s>
<s> The mainboard is the bad old Intel HX. </s>
<s> Do not spend a dime on this one. </s>
<s> I know this board very well as I wrote web pages about it years ago. </s>
<s> If you can't read your Belarc report then you should ask others to read them for you. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> http://www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx?model=TC430HX Your call. </s>
<s> This is truly the old timewarp issue. </s>
<s> Way back when those FPM machines were left in the dust when we moved to EDO. </s>
<s> The owners that &quot;invested&quot; in FPM sticks were miffed over the memory technology advances. </s>
<s> Anyhow, you see the &quot;maybe&quot; word here and there on this board. </s>
<s> And again I think this is a DON'T DO IT machine. </s>
<s> You can find better, for free on freecycle. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I expressed my opinion in the beginning....Don't Do That. </s>
<s> The user WANTS to do this. </s>
<s> It's the user's money. </s>
<s> It's the user's headache. </s>
<s> Looks like a Money Pit and a Can of Worms to me. </s>
<s> Maybe it's a LABOR of LOVE. </s>
<s> Sorry, the moment I saw intel I thought &quot;proccessor&quot;. </s>
<s> Okay, so I might not be able to get more ram, (though I will search around for that tag ram thingamijig) but what about getting it a better video card? </s>
<s> At the vere least, I want to do that. </s>
<s> In other systems being dumped on freecyle or dumpsters. </s>
<s> Again, a friend scored a Pentium 3 complete and moved their hard disk over. </s>
<s> For just watching the freecycle. </s>
<s> Be aware that even with the tagram many of this boards behave just like the fellow that did the high dive into the empty pool. </s>
<s> It's not pretty. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
