i just had another one of these on a different forum.
my pc came with only 1gb of ram.
i'm running vista business on a pentium d 820, dual core processor.
it would not run properly without a second gb of ram (tow gb total).
this seams to also apply to most other pcs as well.
if this is correct and the 32bit systems only go to 3.5gb of ram then there short .5gb of ram if your running a quad core processor.
it might be necessary to upgrade to the 64bit version to get the full 4gb to run the os.
understand?
looks like an ms ooops to me.
....................................................... 64bit oss are available here if you meet the requirements for the upgrade you can receive it for the price of shipping and handling.
