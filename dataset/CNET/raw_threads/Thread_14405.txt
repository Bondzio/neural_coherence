Sound card = 82801BA/BAM AC'97 Audio Controller w/legacy drivers. The sound is yuk, scratchy, hissy. When I plug speakers into my Toshiba Satellite A35-S159, it sounds perfect. It has Realtec AC97 Audio with legacy audio drivers and Audio Codecs. I don't understand all the tech spec's, but my hunch is my HP Pentium is an old PC and probably needs a better sound card; or, probably needs to be decommissioned and get another. But, any ideas (reasonable priced) that I might consider that would make my music sound good from my old HP PC like it does on my Toshiba laptop?
