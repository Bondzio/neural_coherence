<s> I want to format my hard drive and reinstall Windows 98. </s>
<s> However, my primary disk drive does not work. </s>
<s> I have a CD-RW attached to my computer by USB. </s>
<s> If I format my hard drive, will my CD-RW work (since the drivers will presumably be erased)? </s>
<s> If so, can I make my computer read my CD-RW instead of my non-functional primary disk drive, so that I can use it to install Windows 98? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, Scott </s>
<s> There were very few machines that came with Windows 98 that supported such an install. </s>
<s> I'm going to write that the chances of your success is slim. </s>
