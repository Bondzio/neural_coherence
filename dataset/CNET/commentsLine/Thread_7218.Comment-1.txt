during reformatting of a desktop pc (pentium d 3ghz, p5gc-mx asus motherboard, 80gb hdd), i noticed that the fixed 8mb unpartitioned space is showing only 2mb.
the pc is working ok but the speed is a little bit slow.
moreover, it is showing errors during installation of some softwares like adobe reader, nero, etc.
what is the actual problem?
