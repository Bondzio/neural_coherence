the modem and your ISP as the source of the problem, you are left with the router, cables, NIC's and software issues as the possible culprits.
I would first upgrade to the latest router firmware.
If that proves futile, you may wish to engage the help of a friend's broadband and try out the router there.
What's left are software disruptions caused by the various malware residing on the PC's.
