<s> I've built a number of PCs without ever experiencing this common problem, here's what happened and how I fixed it. </s>
<s> I built a micro-ATX machine for my wife, all moderate components. </s>
<s> I researched their power requirements and figured a 150-watt Antec power supply should do the job. </s>
<s> After installing Win 2K, I always install chipset drivers first, then ZoneAlarm, then Norton AV and hit the 'Net for updates. </s>
<s> When I tried to open IE, spontaneous crash & reboot. </s>
<s> Hmmm. </s>
<s> After several repeats, I booted into Safe Mode, all was well, but when I booted normally and tried to run an app the crashes returned. </s>
<s> Figuring the machine was underpowered, I schlepped off to Fry's to get a 350W ATX PSU. </s>
<s> After shoehorning it into the case, imagine my surprise when the same incident occurred. </s>
<s> I had purchased the mobo with the CPU installed and figured the assembler might have messed up the install, but before I went to that extreme (there was a piece of tape saying Warranty Void if Removed) I re-traced my steps and realized my problems started when I installed NAV. </s>
<s> I re-booted into Safe Mode, removed Norton, and voila! </s>
<s> Problem solved. </s>
<s> I re-installed Norton and updated, machine ran SiSoft Sandra's burn-in routine with no problems. </s>
<s> I guess there was some conflict between ZoneAlarm and Norton, or just a bad software install, for whatever reason. </s>
<s> I've heard of bad drivers, bad PSUs & bad CPU installation causing this problem, never a bad install of software. </s>
<s> Keep this info in the back of your head for the future. </s>
<s> Anyone wanna buy a PSU? </s>
<s> Symantec program has created many problems. </s>
<s> LOL </s>
<s> i have had good luck with norton, it is that other program, mc affee er something. </s>
<s> i installed that on my old sony, the computer would freeze, freeze freeze. </s>
<s> i reformated the hard drive and didnt install it again. </s>
<s> tried it on my sony laptop. </s>
<s> it worked fine. </s>
<s> tried it on the emachine. </s>
<s> caused this to freeze freeze freeze. </s>
<s> i had to stop the process before it could cauze it to freeze, then i uninstalled it, and it worked perfectly. </s>
<s> anyone with similiar problems with that virus scanner program? </s>
<s> konny </s>
<s> I have tried norton on a few computers and found it very intrusive. </s>
<s> Imho avg works just fine and doesn't take over your machine. </s>
<s> Well I allwise keep a spare. </s>
<s> But if it's within 30 days you can return it to FRY's John </s>
