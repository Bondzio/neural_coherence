i have found over many years of it work, that both internal and external drives can last for months or last for years.
i have had brand new drives die within 1 year, yet have had others that have been in service for 6-7 years and have yet to even start to hum.
that can be attributed to both manufacturing and operating conditions.
modern drives seem to be much more durable and last considerably longer then those produced 5 years ago.
they handle shock and temperature extremes rather well.
i have several computers which operate in mechanical rooms that at certain times of the year have 100% relative humidity and temps ranging from 45 degrees to well over one hundred degrees with not a single failure.
so it is a costly gamble.
if you, like myself have gigabytes of personal photos, music and video files that are difficult or impossible to replace, then i would suggest backing up to more than one place.
if you want greater protection, consider backing up your valuables to dvd's for greater security.
personally, in addition to hard copies - i use network storage (d-link ds321 and wd mybooks are very cost effective) each consisting of dual drives which mirror each other for even greater security and reliability.
the choice is yours, but with all of the options out there, there is no reason to ever say &quot;i should have backed up more often&quot;.
once you say that, you know it's already too late.
