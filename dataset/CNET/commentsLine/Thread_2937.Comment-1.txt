i divided my hard drive into two partitions, c:/ which contained the os, and d:/ which would be for storage.
some time later the windows 7 installed on c:/ became corrupted to the point of no boot.
i backed up everything necessary, formatted d:/, and installed a fresh copy of windows 7 there.
it works fine, and when booting, boot manager gives me the option to boot windows 7 or windows 7, and selecting the first one boots the fresh install without a problem.
note that the 217gb storage partition previously known as d:/ is now known as c:/, containing the fresh functional os, and the 80gb partition with the old corrupted os is now d. i don't know why they switched.
a screenshot from disk management captures the problem:  i want to (safely) format d, containing the old corrupted windows, but cannot do so as it is the primary partition and the system partition.
after formatting i wouldn't mind merging the partitions either.
