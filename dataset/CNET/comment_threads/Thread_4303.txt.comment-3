No, I can't move to the window and do any better.
As thick as I am, I'm smarter than that (if I could have done that I'd not be in this pickle).
The antenna is in - or in the case of the Hawking, connected to - my laptop, and it's not sufficient to see the APs available to me - but might well see some device on the pole outside (mounted well above me, directly overhead, basically), to which I can't connect physically.
The Senao gear doesn't have repeater function - or at least, their manual and the URL-based setup makes no mention of it.
And, I can't rely on knowing the AP MAC in advance.
The Netgear rep claims their software will display that info - but having been burned once already I'm not anxious to run out and buy a couple hundred dollar item before having confirmation that it will, in fact, do what I need, particularly since there will also be some installation effort and costs.
So... *Without* physical connection to my computer or the physical access to the APs available (see original for expansion), can it be done; does the Netgear do it (who's done it with that item), or failing that, what else?
Thanks.
