Unless that drive has a write protect switch and you have more than one drive like it, it fails basic tests for backups.
Let's say your machines fall prey to http://www.theregister.com/2006/09/21/ie_exploit/ and you think you'll hook up your restore drive.
What stops the pests installed by this exploit from damaging the backup copy?
