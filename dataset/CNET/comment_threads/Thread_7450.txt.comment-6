I am located in the US as well, so finding a drive I think is a rather easy feat.
The question had more to do with I did not know what I could replace the drive with and was looking for recommendations (size, type, manufacturer, etc.)
Can I replace an IDE drive with a SATA?
As for transferring the data, if the original drive worked, then I would have no problem in transferring data myself.
So, I figure if the data is recoverable, then I will happily pay to have the data recovered and transferred.
Thank you to everyone who has replied thus far.
It has been very helpful.
