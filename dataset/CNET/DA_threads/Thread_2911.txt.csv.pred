1.1.1	When my computer is connected to my cable modem my WAN IP shows as 24.164.XXX.XXX.	St
1.1.2	When I connect my Linksys router to the cable modem my my WAN IP changes to 69.200.XXX.XX.Since the router changes the IP, can I change that IP or does each router generate it's own static WAN IP?	St
1.2.1	The router doesn't/can't change an ISP assigned IP address.	St
1.2.2	Don't worry about it.	St
1.2.3	Connect the router to the modem and configure it.	St
1.2.4	Don't worry about the IP address.	St
1.2.5	Cable will have a dynamic IP address that will change about every six months or so.	St
1.2.6	But the router will see this and adapt.	St
1.2.7	You can change the IP address on your LAN, 192.168.xxx.xxx to each PC, but that can and will cause problems.	St
1.2.8	Let the router assign IP addresses and leave them alone.	St
