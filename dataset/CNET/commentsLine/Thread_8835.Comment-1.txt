i have a yamaha crw3200e cdrw...until about a month ago it worked great.
decided to use it today and nothing..dead.
i have it set as the slave and my dvdrom as the master.
when i open 'my computer' it is detected and i can even click on it and open it when there is a cd in the drive, and it opens to a blank screen.
i can even go as far as ejecting the tray from nero,the unit is detected in device manager with no conflicts, i updated the firmware of the drive.
i have also uninstalled/reinstalled the drive, used multiple ide cables, and nothing.
i tried my winxp cd in the drive to see if i could boot from it, and it couldn't, but the drive is detected in the bios.
help me please, my computer is filling up fast...
