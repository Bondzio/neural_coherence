i think it's great they are doing that.
i personally think a 17 inch laptop (their macbook pro model) is hideously large and looks ugly.
i prefer the smaller models and i'm definitely all for this.
not having a drive internally is not a big problem.
my winlaptop strangely doesn't have an internal floppy or cd.
but instead i have an external matshita dvd-ram drive, that burns and reads just about anything under the sun.
it's great.
it boots up xp from a cd just fine, however windows 2000 had a boot error and so i had to do a horribly difficult method (involved usb, ntfs, free/opendos and a lot of patience) but i eventually got all things sorted.
i mean heck, most computers can even boot usb flashdrives these days.
internals are old news, imo.
i just hope that apple appropriately drops the price given what features will be missing.
might even look into one of these...
