Is there any advantage going from vga, to vga to dvi adapter, then to dvi input on monitor? Or the same as going straight vga to vga on monitor? Is there bigger advantage if i get a new vid card with dvi out? Currently my machine has onboard Radeon X300/X550 series.

The adapter is just wires to send the signal to the proper pins. &quot;Is there bigger advantage if i get a new vid card with dvi out? Currently my machine has onboard Radeon X300/X550 series.&quot; I want to lump these two questions into one. Almost any video card can outperform onboard video. So there is an advantage there. Bob

I just did a search and found that the benefit of DVI is that digi signal goes straight to monitor whereas vga converts it to analog first and thats where the quality is lost. So in my case I just stick with VGA or upgrade my vid card.

For an average Joe user like me (surfing, doing a little video stuffs, etc.), vga should do just fine; I won't go out and spend big bucks for dvi hardwares. But if hi-def video is your thing, then dvi will be needed. So how's the new year been treating you so far? Hopefully better than last year. -Art-
