hello.
i just replaced my comcast rental modem with a motorola sb6141.
i called comcast to have them add it to my services.
this worked fine, and i am able to connect a computer via ethernet to my new modem with no problem.
however, when i go to connect a router to it i get no internet signal.
are there any addition step(s) that i need to take to get my router to work?
any help is greatly appreciated.
thanks.
