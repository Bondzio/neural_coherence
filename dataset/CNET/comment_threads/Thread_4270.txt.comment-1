Hi, Buying my first camcorder, for use with a Powerbook G4 (which will probably be replaced with an iMac with Leopard next year).
I don't plan on buying anything fancy and hope to keep it to around $300-$400.
Is there any camcorder in that price range that seems to work better than others with Macs?
Or, is there any reason to think the JVC GR-D650, which seems to suit my needs, wouldn't work?
thanks.
