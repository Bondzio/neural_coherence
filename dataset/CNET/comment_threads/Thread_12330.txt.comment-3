Another thing, Bob, is he may end up HAVING to change operating systems.
He will if his XP machines are using NTFS.
That, or reinstall those OS's and switch it to FAT32.
A system using FAT32 will not be able to &quot;see&quot; any system using NTFS.
And, of course, Windows 98 cannot use NTFS.
So, he may end up having problems anyway.
