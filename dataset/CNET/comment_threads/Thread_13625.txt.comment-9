It's at the maker's web page on their product and usually on the web admin page of the router.
I compare the two.
As to bought last month, I've had no router arrive with current firmware.
Why that is, is simple.
They make it, fixing bugs as it floats across the ocean and no company can afford to open them up to update as they go to the shelves.
