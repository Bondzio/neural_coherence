Hi all, I will start with describing the situation: 1) I have WiFi connection and local network installed.
2) I can connect my laptop (and other devices) via WiFi to the network and browse the local network as well as the internet.
3) I have two other desktops that are wired (connected via wire) to the network and works fine (can get to the internet) The problem: ~~~~~~~~~~~~ I conneced one additional desktop to my home network via WiFi and I can browse the local network but I CANNOT CONNECT TO THE INTERNET Do you have any idea what can be the problem?
(I already reinstalled the computer and restarted the wireless router) Thanks for any idea.... Shai
