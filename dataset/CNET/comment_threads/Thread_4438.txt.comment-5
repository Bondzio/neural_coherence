Thanks!
I have tried disabling the antivirus and that didn't work, plus he's had it on his PC for years and he does update it.
Also he is using Windows XP, not Windows 7.
I just checked the Events Viewer logs under all items, but didn't find anything that showed any problems.
I wish I could figure out what is causing the problem.
