The message I normally get is: one or more of your components is not recognised. When I run the cursor over the Maxtor icon it says MAXTOR STATUS ICON NO DRIVE CONNECTED, so at that moment I have to switch around the components attached via USB ports, because at that time I cannot access the Maxtor. so could you assist with eradicating this problem

Not to duplicate all that's been written about USB powered drives such as http://www.chipchick.com/2007/10/another_addition_to_the_portable_hard_drive_-_maxtor_one_touch_mini_4.html and more the troubles are sadly a fallout of USB supplying only so much power and an industry willing to sell stuff that may work 98% of the time. To improve your odds do this: 1. Only use it when the AC cord and AC power is used on your laptop. 2. Use the dual USB power cable. No, it's not a new issue. Same old one. Bob
