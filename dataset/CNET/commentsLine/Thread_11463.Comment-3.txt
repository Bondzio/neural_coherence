hp's site doesn't give any info on your power supply but it's probably less than 250w and it may be smaller than a standard power supply.
standard atx: 6&quot;x3.5x&quot;5.5&quot; miniatx: 5&quot;x3.5&quot;x5&quot; microatx or sfx: 5&quot;x3&quot;x4&quot; (or 5&quot;x2.5&quot;x4&quot;) once you figure out the size, i recommend you get a 350w-400w power supply.
if you need a microatx, 350w will be the max that's available.
