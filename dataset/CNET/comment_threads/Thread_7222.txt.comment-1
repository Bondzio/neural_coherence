For some reason my screen size always resets to 640x480 when I startup my machine.
Then when I go to Control Panel and resize it, I am told I must restart my computer.
So I have done that, but the setting never adjusts back to where I need it.
Therefore, everything on the screen is blurry all the time.
Can anyone please help????
I am completely at a loss for what to do.
Thanks...
