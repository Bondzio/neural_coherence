there are people who mooch off unsecured networks to download via p2p networks.
some routers will behave oddly like yours when the moochers are using your network.
looking in the router logs won't help.
the test i use is to leave the router set as the customer left it (insecure) and turn off all the owners pcs, etc.
if we still see the lights blinking like mad uploading and downloading then we know we have a moocher.
