right now you are rapidly reaching that point of upgrading would be more cost effective.
specifically your cpu is 1.8ghz so to upgrade your cpu you are looking at a couple hundred $$.
ram is almost always, more is better if you have a 64bit os, if your os is 32bit you have reached your limit.
you might get a ssd drive those are fast but the price is still pretty high.
looking on new egg i found machines that would be an upgrade for the sub 500 range.
of course you could pay a bit more and get something more.
hope this helped.
