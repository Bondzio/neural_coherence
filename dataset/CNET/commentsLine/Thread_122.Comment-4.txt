hi rick thanx for your reply and sorry for the delay in responding.
the solution you suggested has not borne any fruit.
in fact, i've done that donkey times.
everything runs until &quot;detected new printer.
please wat.............&quot; it freezes there.
the hp website suggests in that case, pulling out the usb cable and back again.
it responds to the usb, then the message &quot;installation operation failed&quot;.
at times i go thru the process you suggested and it works.
most tho, especially when i really need the printer, it fails.
don't know what to do now.
