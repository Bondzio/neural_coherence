Excluding warranty issues, the seller provides the condition and real value if they don't honor it or just push out less than desirable product. There's always been a market for these products but it seems to have grown way too much. Further, some vendors offer such product as new, so the reconditioner *MUST openly state* it on the box or somewhere obvious to the seller. The cost itself is a real plus and overall, I have found no trouble in the end use of these products. However, it seems as i stated above when a problem crops-up some sellers drag their feet and/or make less than a happy sale after the fact. tada -----Willy

At this point, I can generally get a new machine for equal or less cost -- and a full warranty. To be green, I'll just run mine into the ground.

It is good for other people to surf and use than on my main one where I keep the important things that I dont want lost or bumped off. Also by doing this I am able to know what is in it..go green..and keep one more computer going in landfill. Its a great idea. As for the comparisons to price...that can go both ways..for some not getting the higher price outfits..it can be cheaper just to rebuild your computer to your personal needs.(I find some just go for looks anyhow).

The hard drive had errors immediately. I was working away from town for 3 months, and returned to find within 2 weeks a crashed hard drive, so real use was less than 2 weeks, called HP, alas a 3 month warranty. Asked me if I wanted to extend the warranty to have a hard drive paid for, but it was worth 3 times the cost of replacing the hard drive to buy this extended warranty. Rip off!! Had to replace the hard drive myself, at my own cost. The original was riddled with errors all over, hard to believe they wouldn't have known. Junk. Not ever ever again. I've purchased Dell computers and HP computers plus built many myself, personally but a new Dell, good price and quality. Refurbs are junk.

Besides, because the paperwork says 'refurbished' doesn't mean that it actually was. For all we know it was put back on the shelf with the box taped shut. As a person that has been burned dramatically by HP in the past, I think it would be prudent not to be saddled with someone elses trouble. Go buy new.

No problems that had to do with hardware yet, and a few minor problems with Vista (SP1 RC1), which were fixed with a system restore. I would definitely buy another refurbished computer/printer/monitor, but not any form of internal hardware such as PCI cards or Hard Drives.
1335	18	286028	2718385	2718149	PaulTercier	2/29/08 7:34 PM	1.20431364E12	Refurbished computers	One of the lesser known things is that most big box/large dept stores with a generous return policy do not resell any returned computer equipment. Even if it is just a buyer's remorse return they get sold as open box/return units. Since the savings can be in the 40 to 60% range there is a substantial bit of change. As a long time technician and service department person, I've found that the refurbs are actually less costly than what I can build one for using the same quality of components, not counting any software. So YES, I would buy one, and have done so several times.... and I do like the HP/Compaq systems, but Gateway, IBM come a close second especially the IBM website for off lease units.

I would definitely have to think long and hard. I, too, have built many pc's and bought numerous refurbs ... I have never felt financially flush enough to buy the top of the market system I always wish for ... the saving grace is the knowledge that the top is a moving target ... even if I bought at the top, the day I did it would be old already ... anyway, while I've never been totally satisfied, I must admit that the closer-to-the-top machines I have had issued by various employers have often given long and satisfactory service ...

But I dissagree about their customer service. After getting the P.C. back for the second time, and still had hard-drive noises, I wrote to HP. A couple of days passsed and a customer service rep. called me at home and arranged to send me a NEW P.C. to replace the refurbished one. I have also worked on other H.P. computers for friends and am very satisfied with the customer service response to any questions or problems I had. So yes I did have problems with the refurbished P.C., but H.P. did take care of it.

Knowing how quickly computers become 'old', I can see no good reason for buying a used or refurbished computer. Considering that a new computer can be obsolete before it leaves the store, the thought of buying refurbished is a waste of money. New computer prices are getting cheaper all the time and if you can't afford the best, just buy the best you can afford. If money is still too tight to buy new, refurbish your own old computer bit by bit and you can get much better value for money than buying one someone else has done up. Buying old, not for me.

The poll did not specify what type of computer systems. I never bought a used personal computer and doubt that I would unless it was less than a year old. The systems that I have bought used were primarily Unix systems such as Sun, IBM, HP, Compaq, Stratus, and Tandem. In these Unix systems, the applications do not often change and the system may run for five or more years without any significant changes. That scenario is not very likely for a personal computer where software is often changed every 18-24 months and each change requiring more computing resources..

At the time it saved me about $500 off of a new one with the same options, this was about 2yrs ago now. I would only buy one from an OEM outlet myself as I trust them more than 3rd party sites. It has had no problems and even came with the same warranty as a new one, most OEM outlets have this policy but it's a good idea to check and make sure. Since prices of laptops have come down so the savings may not be as much now but there are bargains if you do some research and don't have to have the latest components.
1335	25	286028	2718402	2718149	rbsjrx	2/29/08 7:52 PM	1.20431472E12	It depends on a lot of things	Specifically, 1) what is it for, 2) who is it for, 3) what type of machine is it, 4) what brand is it, and 5) who's selling it. If it's for me and it will be used for Windows, then yes, probably. I mostly use Windows for work and so the time to build up a new machine has a direct impact on my bottom line. Buying refurbished FROM A REPUTABLE SOURCE means I can save some money and isn't much of a risk. Buying refurbished may also mean I can avoid getting stuck with Vista on a new machine and then having to invest more money to buy an OEM copy of WinXP to replace it. If it's for me and will be running Linux, then I'm more likely to build one from scratch. The last computer I bought was for my wife and it was a refurbished HP a1450n that I bought from the HP web site. It came with WinXP MCE and has been 100% reliable. A great machine and a great deal. OTOH, I've known too many people who've been burned buying refurbished machines from some neighborhood computer store. But then, I wouldn't even buy parts from most of those stores anyway. Their parts are always suspect (often counterfeit or mislabeled, but always cheap - not just inexpensive, but CHEAP), and the skill of the people involved is highly variable. Also, if you buy a refurbished Dell or HP, Lenovo, et al, you pretty much know what you're getting. OTOH, I know people who've bought refurbished off-brand or store brand PCs that were unmitigated disasters. Refurbishing won't turn a sow's ear into a silk purse. GIGO and caveat emptor... Note that all of the above refers to desktop PCs. Laptops and notebooks are another matter entirely. They're flimsy to begin with and refurbished machines are more likely to have been subjected to catastrophic events which no amount of refurbishing can completely fix. I would never buy a refurbished laptop or notebook PC!

My last three laptops have been refurbs and am completely satisfied. Now I will say that the laptops were purchased from the manufacturer and the customer service has been excellent. I did have a component fail in two of the laptops and the parts were replace immediately. If you are going to purchase a refurb, I recommend you do so through the manufacturer to ensure you have warranty.

I bought two refurb PCs, one of them, a TI Windows 95 laptop, was great, and it still works fine. The other one, a Dell desktop, was a disaster. It looked, and even smelled, totally knew. I couldn't see any evidence it was a refurb, except Dell said it was. For about 2 months, it was ok, then the fun began. The first thing was the slot the sound card was in died. I moved it to the remaining slot, and just went on. Then the AGP slot died too, and the motherboard was replaced. Then the sound card, video card, and modem died in a weekly succession of failures. The motherboard had another issue when it suddenly began to not boot, and apparently there was a bad solder joint someplace. That was it, I took the cards and drives, etc, and built a new PC in a new case. The PS, case and motherboard went out at the curb the next trash day. If it was just mine, I would write it off as bad luck, but a friend of mine had similar issues with an almost identical PC, a refurb too. I've built my own dessktops for about the last 7 years, and the Dell laptop I bought 2 and a half years ago couldn't really be any better.

NOT ONE! And they come with original factory warranty, so why worry? AAMOF, I am of the opinion that it is actually &quot;better&quot; than the new. Why? Because the flaw has been found and FIXED already. So whats to go wrong? On the other hand, the new product still has the possibility that it will have the same flaw show up or something else after you buy it. Then you have the down town involved of getting it fixed, whereas with the refurbished, it has already BEEN fixed! Do as you please, but it has been my personal experience with man items that they are every bit as good as buying new. You save quite a bit of money simply because it is an out of box item and you're the one that benefits. I have also purchased &quot;display&quot; items the same way, and never a problem with them either. You get STEEP discounts and original factory warranty also. These items have no or insignificant amounts of usage, which means absolutely nothing in the course of the amount of their existing life.

I've bought new, refurb, used and store return open box (the latter both directly from the big box merchandisers and from liquidators on eBay). I buy for myself, for my family, immediate and extended and a few friends - sometimes with my money, sometimes with theirs. I usually buy 4-6 machines/yr, mostly desktops but about one notebook/yr. Any of the above, other than new, you probably won't get the latest hot new gizmo in your PC, but if you're going to use it more than a few months, you won't have the latest whizbang gizmo anymore anyway, so why bother? Currently, I find the best deals with the store return resellers on eBay. They come and go, but there are always several that honestly describe what they are selling, and will refund or replace if they do make an honest error in a listing. I recently bought a new Dell desktop for a niece since it was her money and she was nervous about buying used/refurb/return. We've had more trouble with that machine (including replacement of the motherboard) than any other PC I've bought in the last 3 years. Not that I would expect that again, it just turned out that way. We've had zero problems with a Dell desktop that her mother has had longer - it was a customer return bought from an eBay reseller. For desktops, currently I usually find I get more for the money buying the store return machines. They often may be missing some of the &quot;accessories&quot; but the OEM mice, keyboards, etc are usually junk, so it's no loss if they're missing. You would want to replace them anyway. For notebooks, it's a closer call. When my granddaughter went off to college last fall, I got her a new notebook (at Best Buy) - I couldn't find as good of value in terms of features for the price in refurb/used/open box as was available in the new back to school specials they were running.

I had fantastic results with this laptop because it did everything I wanted and then some. It was a factory refurbish, so it was like a new laptop. Also it had Windows XP Media Center, which was a huge plus seeing how the last laptop I sold used Vista with slow results among other things.

It had a warranty (1 yr) problem early on, but Compaq picked it up at their expense, did a same day turn-around and I haven't had a problem since. The LT gets rugged, everyday use and has worked wonderfully. A month ago, the 40 GB HD started to go south, but gave me time to do a complete backup. I picked up a 120 Gig replacement, reloaded the data, and expect it to last until I decide to buy a duo. Desktop is different. I'm into building my own, so would not be interested in buying a refurb'd unit. I did buy a refurb'd ThinkPad once, but got rid of it. Not due to the unit, I just didn't like the light weight of the unit... wanted something more rugged.

I work on pcs for a resale shop and we've got alot of namebrands and redone them and they are still being used. You can also save money by buying a debranded pc from some sites that sell them. We bought a couple off ebay that were refurbished and they were great pcs. I mean you don't mind buying a used or recertified car so why should it be different with a pc. It saves ya money and for most people now a days it's a good thing.

I've bought a lot of it with no problems. I've also bought new computers and built myh own computers.

Having done that I've learned not to trust any hdd over 3years old, even if a company refurbished it. As far as cpus and mobo's go, cpu's rarely fail and the motherboards may loose certain functions, but generally, add in cards will fix those issues. However, if you want the best budget systems, just build it yourself. If its all new, age doesn't matter so you can get a high quality slower machine for alot less then a new one. And, if you dont game or deal with vista(waiting on sp5 before i try again), xp runs on p2's no problem if you limit services. However, laptops, stay away from any used one, I've never seen a used laptop that worked 100%, I mean, they work, but all that heat in such a small box is asking for trouble anyway.

My motherboard that I bought almost 4 years ago for $121 dollars at a particular vendor now has it for $289 dollars factory recertified! Maybe &quot;old is gold&quot; in some respects but technology=$=performance need to be summed up and brought into perspective!

The major difference can be that while the new one has the latest, or near latest CPU, it doesn't have much else. Small hard drive, limited RAM, basic graphics, etc. While the rebuilt may have an older CPU it may well have a much larger hard drive, 2 or more times the RAM, a better graphics card, you get the idea. So there are trade offs on the price issue. I recently purchased a used 2.5 Ghz P4 with small (by today's standards) hard drive, CDRom, and basic features for about $50. I am happy with the machine and will shortly be swapping the much larger (medium sized drive on todays list) from my P3 machine into the P4 and adding a DVD writer. The writer was unfortunately specced for P4 at 1.5G or better which is the reason for the upgrade. I'm not a cutting edge computer user but doing tax preparation and bookkeeping doesn't require the latest and greatest. In fact the reason I built my first machine (a 486) from a collection of used parts and a new hard drive was the fact that I couldn't get an affordable tax prep program in DOS and had to migrate to Windoze which wouldn't go on my then XT.

I build most of my own desktops, but I also have bought 3 Dell desktops and 4 Dell notebooks from the Dell Outlet. My first Dell desktop was a brand new P-90, bought in 1994, and cost over $4,000. It still runs perfectly, although it has been retired. I am typing on a Dell Inspiron 8000 notebook, bought in 2000 from Dell Outlet, that has never given me a minute's trouble. Shortly after purchase, I dropped it on a ceramic tile floor and bent one of the USB ports beyond recognition, but the computer has never stopped working, and it runs 24/7! In addition, I have a Dell D600, a Dell E-1705, and a Dell 1521--all refurb notebooks. I bought two Dell Dimension 1100 refurbs, two Dell Dimension 4400 refurbs (one from a thrift store), a Dell PowerEdge 2200 server (excessively used), and a Dimension E-521 (barely used). They all are in service today, and the only problems with any of them have been software-related. In addition, my grandson dropped a Dell CPi notebook (really old) on a ceramic tile floor and totally destroyed the keyboard which I replaced, and it never missed a beat! Somehow I don't believe that the newest notebooks today, from any manufacturer, can withstand that kind of abuse. I have never had to use a Dell warranty, so I never buy any more than the one they come with. I have never needed technical support for a Dell computer problem, but when I had a simple question, I had to talk to people on three different continents! However, Dell's online technical support is the best I have ever seen for any manufacturer, and its Community Forum is another good source for information. I know that some people have horror stories about Dell computers, but those are usually the only ones that get told, because those folks yell the loudest. Here is the other side of the coin from a super-satisfied Dell customer. One last thing: With the specials Dell is running on their new computers, they cost less than the comparably configured refurbs! So, if you want new rather than refurb, you can get a brand spanking new Dell in about 7 or 8 different designer colors! I wouldn't buy anything else--refurb or brand new.

When ever I have wanted to replace my computer I have been lucky that my need wasn't immediate. What I do is pick out the most expensive top of the line computer with the best extra's available and then price it and write all the info down. Then I wait 1 or 2 months and get the exact computer at about half the price. I have found that getting a computer today depreciates so much so fast you only have to wait a month or 2 till it is cheap and that way I never hve to buy a refurbished one.
1335	49	286028	2718635	2718364	splatthewonderfly	2/29/08 10:45 PM	1.2043251E12	I concur! Buying from a manufacturer works well.	In that they are still liable to extend the warrantee as though it was new. If there are problems with the Refurbished system, you end up covered for repairs or replacements. I purchased a Dell when my older system started to fail. It has been the most solid machine I have owned. BUT before buying it, I compared the statistics. a 6% failure rate for new, and 4% rate for refurbished machines. This was because that rather than tearing down the machines and/or scrapping them, they often found the problematic element, replaced or repaired it, before selling it at the discounted price. The other reasons I had for purchasing a refurb. was to buy &quot;yesterdays news&quot; instead of paying top dollar for the current &quot;top of the line&quot; or anything close. When an 8% increase of CPU speed is marked as the next big improvement, I find it unnecessary to pay 4x the cost for that extra 8%... Otherwise, I can get a CPU that runs 25% slower than the fastest machines and run all the applications and games that I will need for years to come. Now, I have 4 systems in the house; 2-P3s for the kids, 2-P4s for myself and the roommate. with XP SP2

I tend to buy the fastest newest processor I can afford because I don't like the idea that we're becoming a plastic and heavy metal world trash heap. The longer I can hold on to my computer, the happier I am. A refurb is already day-old bread, particularly since I can build my own and get what I want for much less than buying a ready-made. With a laptop, I might buy a refurb. Still for the same reason - I like to get as much time out of it as possible. If I were less able to sink the cash into a laptop, I might be tempted to go for a refurb if it would allow me to buy a faster computer. I look at consumer reviews when I'm buying expensive or critical items because I don't want a lot of down time fixing equipment whether it is new or a retread. To me, bargain is only a good deal when it doesn't involve me spending hours in repair or multiple stop-overs on a flight.

After you purchase one you can get it checked out with best buy's geek squad just be sure the company or person is legitimate.most of the time if they are they will walk you through the components and the programs on the computer. take the same caution you would in buying a used car.

If you replace the part, then theoretically it should work - and 99 percent of the time it does. I would say it matter on your opinion of the brand, and then how the refurbisher's 'brand' is with warranties, and any other kinds of proof that they do a good job, as most computers are refurbished by 3rd parties, and not the actual company they were made by (Although some are) I would buy a refurbished product at the right price. I have an Apple eMac that i bought refurbished just lately from a 3rd party...absolutely love it.

(I knew the owner)I paid $150.00 for it a KSD Tiger. It came with a Canon inkjet printer, a scanner, several game, blank cds,a circuit protector w/1800 jewels, and an almost new oak desk. A couple of months after I bought it lightening hit our house. It fried the circuit breaker, the TV, the microwave, and my deep freezer. I thought the computer was a complete loss too. The insurance company olny gave me $100 for the computer since it was old. A friend of mine is a computer wiz kid. He checked it out, put in a new processor and motherboard. That was in 2001, I'm still using it and the printer and scanner. I have a total of $357. in it. Since then I had to replace my mouse and replaced the cd burner with a dvd burner. Please explain why a new one is better. My sister bought a new HP had to have it fixed two months later and my nephew bought a new Dell with all the bells and whistles - its been in the shop 3 times now and is so slow. Oh, I have AMD sempron in mine and run XP pro.

Most people wouldn't know the first thing about building a computer. Just because you're geeks doesn't make everyone one. I wouldn't let my husband touch my computer. I know it would never work again. He's a great guy, but he barely knows how to check his e-mail.

I have waited for off lease, 2 to 3 year old machines, to get fast enough to be desktop capable, for my needs. All Dxxx's computers are graded when they come back and only those graded premium are sold directly. Each unit has new batteries, built in b/g wireless working, with O/S installed on clean hard drive, any remainder warrantee still valid and comes with a full legal Windows XP+ cd at this time. Not a restore disk. Note, business machines can swap out their drives in less than a minute, often at the press of a hidden button. Very happy with both machines. Over this year I upgraded memory and hard drive (Linux-no problem) on first machine. Latest machine came with 1gb memory standard and is still as received. No state tax and quick cheap shipping are another plus. I expect all recertified machines to WORK when unpacked as a real human saw that they worked. Money saved on &quot;each&quot; machine $2000.

On the auction sites I look for a power seller with over 98% approval rates. I also look for someone who is selling dozens of basically the same computer in the range of options I want. Generally it means that they are all coming off of one or two lease programs. Don't be afraid to ask why the seller has so many. There's a difference between a copany re-tooling their accountants and one re-tooling their salesmen in the field. (The latter can get rough on their laptops.)

I have been building and refurbishing old pcs since back in the days of the old 486's (Not enough power to pull a foreskim back sorta thing). A difficult process back then but managable aftwr some swearing and guddelling around inside a box! It is a sight easier now although one bug bear is trying to find drivers for out of date components or components with no Manufacturers stamp or id on them. I also have fould that when refurbishing old pcs, it sometimes help to use Everest, a program which identifies all the components on the system. Takes a whole load of major hassle out of the process. Admottedly, refurbishing doesn't always have the successful or desired outcome but, in saying that, the learning process is always worth it, from dismantling a pc to resurrecting, you alway find something useful and new to know.

I paid $650 for it, which was less than half of what I paid for my desktop four years ago. It works like a charm. My only problem is getting used to Vista. I recommend Gateway products because of their quality, and their customer service. I won't buy anything else.

The older one runs Win98SE, and is kept for private purposes - it does not usually go anywhere near the Internet, and I keep bank details, letters, etc., on it. That was bought from a local shop for 25 (US$50) some 5 years ago. Still running well, but has been modified (memory, changed CD to CD-RW, added this and that) over the years. The other is a Dimension from Dell Outlet - again I have found I needed to add bits and pieces from time to time; but then playing with them as electronic systems is part of the fun. I would have no worry about using secondhand electronic equipment; the discount for secondhand allows you to add/subtract components to your own designs. After all, if a piece of electronics has worked for previous owners it will work for you - most that is going to die will have died for the first buyer!

He gave me a brand new E-Machine from Best Buy for X-Mas and it has been a nightmare. For students, light users, or a mainly document computer I'd definitely go to a reliable source like GIM and no I don't know anyone there or own the place.

Many products such as computers and T.V.'s are returned to stores such as Best Buy, Circuit City by people who purchase on a whim then realize they can't afford to keep the purchase and make payments.

When I have a computer I love it's hard to part with it, so I do whatever I can to upgrade my existing unit as long as possible. When I do have to get a new computer I want to get as much bang for my buck as I can so I watch for sales and read as many professional and user reviews as I can. Thanks to CNET and all the folks who give reviews and opinions I've never been disappointed with a purchase. Even if a refurbished computer is in great shape, I have a tendency to work my laptops to death so I need something that's got all the power and features I need without too many whistles and bells I don't need. If you're getting a desktop for the kids to go to MySpace, go ahead and get refurbished, but if you need something that you're going to put through it's paces, save up, read the reviews and buy new.

They are simple to build and easier than a 386, which is where I started this hobby. My wife bought me an HP 6 years ago. It still works fine, even after several HDD changes! It also still runs XP. That's fine, I wouldn't upgrade the OS on a amchine that old. With all the new hardware still being created, there is a drawback to buying off the shelf - old hardware! Good luck on your decision.

Also, just the fact that it is &quot;refurbished&quot; indicates to me the possibility that there were problems w/ the unit in the past. Additionally the warranty's are often too short. I just don't trust them.

In some cases, you might find that and entire line of computers have been brought back to new conditions..................... I would reccommend doing your research and find the features you want in a model and company that you trust and then................... Refurbish is just fine! If the price is right and features what you need, go for it! I have personally purchased a refurbished computer with many more features than I could afford as new and have never regretted the purchase.

Out of 6, four are still in use and working just fine. The oldest of these is 7 years old now and except for one that got hit with a power surge, never a repair. I also have a refurbished Gateway laptop that's been perfect as well. The only difference I've found between these computers and a &quot;new&quot; one is that they cost half as much or in some cases, less than half. The other difference is a shorter warranty plus the terms of the warranty make it virtually impossible to use it but (knock on wood) I've never had occasion to try.

I figure I got the unit at 1/2 price. its still under warranty, it runs fine, and is the 4th refurnished unit I bought from Dell. While I admit I had to return one, I did so with no hassle.

I&quot;m running MCE with 3gigs of RAM. I had purchased the extra gig from Tiger also. This machine is a speed demon. I've been converting old Hi 8mm home tapes to digital and then burning to DVD with a ADS Instant DVD+DV. I also attended CNET's online course &quot;speed up windows xp&quot; to speed up this computer and two others. All in all this refurb has been reliable and I saved close to $400.00. I usually won't buy an extended warranty. I discovered most bad electronics konk out the first 30 days of usage.I advise to do a little research on the product you want to purchase and read reviews from others that have taken the refurbished plunge. Good luck!!

When I consider buying a recertified desktop I am especially interested in the pieces it contains. For example, instead of paying $139. for Vista, you can buy a recertified computer with Vista, plus a good size hard drive, dvd burner and memory, a newer motherboard, a fair case, keyboard and mouse, power supply, modem, and sometimes even a video card or monitor for much less than the price of the pieces. This holds true if you are not afraid to get inside your unit, or just need the parts. The last one I bought at TigerDirect.com had a loose cable connecting the cd drive, and now runs flawlessly (Dell Optiplex). It cost the same price as a hard drive and operating system (XP Home edition).

I bought one new and a year has gone by and I am now upgrading my own. Building your own is definately something you can do over a little time. Unfortunately, technology is moving so fast, you just can't hardly keep up with the latest and greatest. One great thing about building your own is like any other foundation, where you start, like the mother board, processor, and power supply, it will allow you to do so much more to upgrade. Most new and refurbished you end up having to put in a new power supply and mother board anyway. There are some great deals to be had out there for building your machine. I just bought 2GB of Ram, a really nice video card, and 550w ps for $200. OK!!! You talked me into it. I think I will build my own next time.

We strickly stay with business models, ie dell latitude, compaq evo ect. We have found that staying with these models we have better luck with the outcome. Saying that, we still have about a 1 in 4 ratio of units that aren't worth investing in the repair and are used for spare parts. So in answering the question, stay with high end units from a company that will stand behind their sales

I bought an old dell for my nephew a few years back and it runs fine with XP and I am no longer worried if it becomes out dated with XP anymore. See www.Ubuntu.com... You'll know why if and when you make the switch. You'll never be sorry either. If you can't d/l it due to a slow or bad connection or a cd from them. Free updates, free support. I use it and love it! Winehq.org will answer some compatiblity issues to for all versions! If you guys intend of trading up, and are tossing the old system, drop it off on me. I know people who can use them.

I think this is an important thing to realize. I would purchase a refurbished desktop (maybe a laptop) from Dell, IBM, Apple and maybe HP. It really depends on the reliability of the company behind the product. I would NEVER purchase a refurbished computer from any kind from a budget manufacturer basically because, although they'll give you a warranty, their service is quite likely sub-par (I'm having a hellish experience with a new Averatec laptop at the moment). As for desktops, I would suggest building your own computer before purchasing a refurbished one (or get a friend to help you do it if you can't). The advantage with a a desktop is that the components are more independent than in a laptop so they are easier to recondition. Laptops on the other hand, have most components integrated into the motherboard, so if something goes wrong, there goes the whole thing. So, to recap, here's what you need to consider (if you prefer refurbished over self-built): 1. Brand-are you going to get the warranty and support you need (and is the thing a quality product to begin with) 2. Form factor (desktop vs. laptop) and 3. How much are you really saving over new or self-built.

I have purchased various refurbished items from reputable vendors for the past 10 to 15 years now without any problems. I figure that at least a human had to OK the refurbished item, so it was working when it left the factory this time around.

This is not an advert for Dell, however, in the past ten years I have purchased over 25 Dell refurbished desktop computers for friends, relatives, local animal shelters, and myself - at great savings. They have all performed flawlessly with the exception of one - one I had bought for myself! After the second attempt to fix the problem failed, they promptly sent me another one - no hassle at all. I will continue to purchase refurbished computers with confidence.

However with a laptop it would be a maybe but I would search on the web to find out why it is breaking down and needing to be refurbished.

Though I have built my own computers since the invention of PCs, I would probably trust a &quot;referb&quot; or &quot;recert&quot; computer because it has been thoroughly checked before sending it to a customer or vendor. A new computer is usually not tested to this level. While I have bought several &quot;refurb&quot; or &quot;recert&quot; peripherals over the years with no problems except for technology growing so quickly. I have never purchased a new computer until a few weeks ago, but only because it was a deal I could not refuse for a Duo 2 Quad. Beyond this, I would certainly consider getting a &quot;new&quot; &quot;recert/refurb&quot; computer.

The deals you can get now-a-day's on a used machine is incredible. I'm a software developer so a fast machine is a requirement for me, but I've had nothing but good luck with the used machines I've purchased. The machine I'm writing this on cost me $215 from the computer store up the street. A bit of advice, make sure the place you buy from is reputable and has a good in-store warranty. This machine came with a 90-day warranty, which is pretty good. Also, if the machine had failed in 90-days, they promised to do an in-store swap, another important thing to ask. Sometimes, they will make you wait for them to do a swap with their vendor, which could take days or weeks. If you have some knowledge of how to work on computers yourself (ie, change RAM and Hard Disk drives), then you can really get a great deal on used computers because you can make use of old parts to boost their performance. Always keep your data backed up and follow a good data management scheme, where you information is consolidated in one place. Then if you experience a hardware failure, recovery is easy and cheap.

Just like buying a used car, it is somone else's 'lemon'. &quot;7 day warranty&quot; is the norm on refurbished, are you kidding me! Within 7 days one barely has time to ascertain if there are any &quot;issues&quot;. Give me at least a 90 day unlimited warranty, then MAYBE! I have searched many sites for new and used, and for the minimal difference, I say buy it new, with all the bells and whistles and get a long warranty! I've toyed with the concept of 'leasing' but cannot really see much advantage. I am a small business owner, and shopping for the most bang for the buck for a new laptop. Not the brightest bulb on the Christmas tree and not real tech savvy, so any 'help' from a laptop guru would be appreciated. Your suggestions appreciated. Lots of memory, and FAST!!!!

I had nothing but problems with that computer! In addition to technical issues with it, the hard drve had not been completely wiped. While my daughter was looking for something specific on the computer, I noticed there was still porn (presumably from the previous owner) on the computer. I agree with most of the other comments I've read here from other users: Build your own PC desktop. You get everything exactly the way you want.

Have about 5th pc from the last 10 yrs and find to of gotten out of many jams due, affiliations with programers and those trying or building thier own system fix it types. About the best ever used which saved many an old pc was one called Stealth which come to think about it wonder what happen to Jim. Have a HP now acquired from flea market bought one program thuis far, and had many a person(s) utilize the system and internet thru it, what i run now for a safe upkeep is One Step Maintence, which i failed to upgrade simply, because errors dont only show up on our machines, but they swear the check will be sent out soon. Need i say more. This pc has dual drives and games for the Mrs and the kids corrupted some variable spaces but someday perhaps unloading it all and adding that new memory will still get my cd burner and its other programs within to work just the way they should. By the way anyone selling a copy of XP havent found mine since pickin up this HP. Had tried to free space and few copies of system an programs files deleted themselves making few other rather delinquent. Otherwise yes i would and perhaps will buy another.

I have to buy after market as I don't build my own. I bought her a Dell refurb off of EBay from a power seller. We paid some under $400 for one that is much better than my over $2000 Dell laptop. They allow you to pay extra on EBay for insurance on your purchase price. I will give this a shot when mine wears out. I have a couple sellers bookmarked and I occasionally check out what is available and for what kind of prices. My neighbor who works with computers told me about this. He bought his wife one also. Yes you are always taking a chance. I guess it comes down to your skills and your budget. Thanks

Why go to PC WORLD and have some numpty sell you something you dont want when we could build you exactly what you require!!

You might save some money but, as others have noted, the difference between a new one and a refurbished one is not very significant, and my time is worth more than this difference. Moreover, the small savings are often offset by more limited warranties (some are only 30 days), by the fact that the equipment is more likely to be out-dated or even obsolete and that you will have to replace it more quickly, and, generally, by the unreliability of the refurbishing process. Too often, the manufacturer--even the best ones, acting in good faith (which is not always the case)-- will not be able to reproduce the problem that caused the prior owner to return it to the manufacturer, and it will get the proverbial &quot;sunshine treatment&quot;. By the time you discover that the problem was not corrected, it is too late. Bottom line: you might save some small change with a refurbished model, but personally, I have better use with my time than dealing with a computer that already has a history of problems.

My first new computer cost me a small fortune and would not be worth a dime today. Second new box is still fairly new but was a bit of an impulse purchase. Cost of parts now a heck of a lot less.

The top of the line systems were available for often less than half the price of &quot;name&quot; brands. The systems were also built with off the shelf parts that are easily replaceable if something goes wrong. I have also been able to build my own, and open my system to add or update a part. Nowadays, it looks like the name brands have been becoming more competitive and the Moms & Pops are getting scarcer. We still have Fry's though, and they are similar to the Moms & Pops in that you select your parts and they will build you a computer. I have a seven-year old desktop we updated at Fry's after the motherboard died, with a new motherboard, CPU, and RAM, and added a large hard drive, and DVD/CD burner. I also have a five-year old Dell laptop I purchased to play computer games while I was recovering from surgery. It wasn't the biggest or best, but it served its purpose. I still use it for my income tax and schoolwork. Dell has since outsourced their tech support to India, so I won't buy another from them. I don't like to see Americans put out of work, although I know it is less expensive for the corporations to outsource.

They usually come with markedly shortened warranty periods. That would be OK if they were drastically discounted, but they are seldom -- one can almost always do as well just looking for a sale. In fact, the last notebook I bought was on a great sale and was cheaper than the few refurbished models that were less well equippped. 2. How can one be sure whatever got them returned was fixed (unless of course you believe in the current high quality of tech support and service).

I have always bought new, for a number of reason, but I can see why someone would seriously consider buying a refurbished system. The reasons a person might buy refurbished could include that they: MUST have a replacement computer, but cannot afford a new one. MUST have a replacement computer, but are not willing to pay the price of a new one that is powerful enough to suit their needs. Are knowledgeable enough to not need to rely on the tech support they'd get if they bought new. Are frugal about everthing they spend money on. Have dealt with a particular outlet before and trust buying from them again. Are not changing to a new OS and intend to use an OS and applications they already know will work just fine on the refurbished system they have picked out. The reasons that I have always bought new include: I never buy the least expensive or most expensive system offered. I use my system until something major fails, such as a motherboard, and by the time that happens the parts are outdated to the point of being unavailable at the time. I especially make a point of buying new whenever I'm changing to a new OS, such as now with Vista, so that unusual problems (like BUGS) can be directed back to the dealer's tech support (I think the bugs should be worked out *before* the product hits the market place).

A true refurb (current technology) would be ok if you saved a chunk of change on what you were going to purchase new anyway. I am not afraid of refurbs just rip-offs and most of the time that is what I see is rip-offs.

I also like to build computers which I build all of mine, BUT if I couldn't build them any more, I would buy a refurbished one.

Had great luck with both (still using Sony). Also got 19&quot; monitor (seperate purchase). Sony was 'state of the art' when bought and I saved at least 1/3 of retail price. Got great deals on great equipment & no hardware/software problems.

No major issues and when we had a minor one, Dell rushed us a part overnight! A client needed a laptop three years ago and I recommended Dell Refurbished - when her kids spilled sticky juice on the keyboard, Dell rushed her a new keyboard overnight NO CHARGE! She has since purchased a Dell Refurbished Desktop and another Laptop (she has teenagers). So when I needed a laptop last year, I went with a Dell Refurbished Latitude - excellent choice. Dell stands behind their machines and has provided us with excellent customer service for years! My only complaint is that I prefer not to be speaking with someone in India - HIRE AMERICANS DELL!!!

About 6 months ago I bought an Acer tower with Athlon 64 X2 4200+ / 2.2Ghz , 320GB HDD, 2GB memory, with video, Ethernet, 56k modem, dual layer, +-DVD Burner, USB Speakers, 7 way memory card reader. 7.1 surround, with Vista Premium installed for about $315. This was like a brand new box and I have had no problems at all. Think about this: Refurbs have been QC'd and fully tested by 2 different factory techs. The 2nd time through usually has more intense diagnostics run on the machine to find any problems. Most Refurbs are simply open box items or customer returns.

Some times a refurbished computer is a great deal and you can say a lot of money over a system that came off the shelf. I used to buy all of my systems doing this way. But with the market so fickle hardware proces change so it is also possible to pick up last years model using prices that are close to new. ALso I find that people who pay for home built or refurbished systems often fail to know what they are getting and often have problems getting software keys and ofter hidden issues. People need to research and check warrentee's.

For myself,I generally build my own and spend a lot of time matching specs vs. prices for the biggest bang per buck it can get. I also tend to use high-end parts in my machines (SCSI disks, Graphic cards, sound cards, fast FSB and memory). However, for a client who is primarily going to use the computer for accessing the Internet, work processing and perhaps storing pictures. A refub is a good deal. Typically, I install a new opsys of the users choice and partition the disk for faster access and easier maintainability. Usually add some RAM as most systems don't come with enough. HP is a good choice in that they maintain their machines for longer than most vender's. Which means that even an old system will have current drivers the next time Bill Gate$ decides he wants a new jet and releases a new Operating System.
1335	129	286028	2721214	2718149	inventivemind	3/4/08 5:47 AM	1.20460962E12	Would I buy a 'refurbished or certified' computer.	I have personal experience in this exact matter because I have done this many times. I repair pc's in my community and many of my customers are spanish speaking, mostly mexican men and women. I was very surprised at first but mexican men and women are quite computer savvy people. All my customer's who are Mexican use Skype to keep in touch with family back home. They all have webcams and they talk and look at eachother and it's a big part of their 'coping' here in the USA all alone. The men often work, send money home, and are very lonely so the computer is extremely important. In addition to repairing computers I also help people to purchase a computer, an this is where I come in very handy for the Mexican customer. I purchase laptops mostly for them, and because they need these laptops fast and are willing to pay cash sometimes I purchase them from ebay, other times from refurbisher's. So, I have had many laptops with &quot;refurbished&quot; stickers on them, and before I ever sell any product I go over it from A to Z. I check to make sure it works wirelessly, I check to see if the operating system on the computer is stable, I stress-test it by multi-tasking to see if it crashes, I download programs, run virus scans, I run Scandisk, I check the Device Manager to make sure all the hardware drivers are updated, etc. From my experience, refurbished laptops and computers are very reliable but this isn't to say that a lemon can't come around every once in a while. My personal take on refurbished laptops is that whoever is selling the computer, if they are somewhat professional, will provide a spec sheet and overall condition report. I find these reports to be accurate and honest so read up on the refurbished computer you are thinking of buying before you pay for it. Sometimes a guy/gal will purchase a computer where it clearly said 'The DVD Drive Is Not Working' which was calculated in the overall price of the system, yet when the person gets the computer their lack of knowledge from not reading anything, leads them to believe that refurbished items are all broken and worthless and before you know it there's a false negative reputation floating around. I say if the price is right and you've read up on it, and agree with all that.. BUY, BUY, BUY!! You Won't Be Dissapointed. I never was! Refurbisje

I bought a used Compaq that was refurbished for $99.00 after rebates. It came with a P4 processor at 2.4 Ghz and 512 mb of DDR ram, a cd player and Windows XP. For $50.00 less than I can buy XP Pro at the store, I got a computer with it. The processor is not fast compared to today's dual and quad core 45nm processors and the DDR ram is slower that DDR2 or DDR3, but I got to use some of the old ram I had laying around from earlier upgrades. I now have 2 gb of ram, a dvd burner and a 256mb video card for less than $200.00. The new NVIDIA and ATI video cards that I bought for my newer computer cost as much as what I spent of this whole unit. I am completely satified with my purchase.
1335	132	286028	2722549	2718149	smokee	3/5/08 5:45 PM	1.2047391E12	Would I buy a refubished computer?	Yes, this is one I am on now. I had cash in pocket to buy the parts to upgrade my Athlon 2500 to a dual core Asus board, a gig or so RAM etc. I had already bought a 320 GB SATA hard drive. However, I got to the city late (Vancouver, B.C.) and the parts place was closed, and so instead found myself at Future Shop, where I found a refurb'd Hewlett Packard for a few bucks more than I had budgeted for parts, with the same specs I desired. So I bought it. I have two complaints, however. First is the most common one: the computer comes loaded with &quot;bloatware&quot;, and, although I am a computer nerd, I guess, I still have had some problems figuring what can go and what can't. The other problem is that this computer has no disks included. Instead it has a restore partition that one is supposed to made restore CD's from. Well, I was hesitating because I don't trust the process - I think you get only one shot at it. Also, it seems to me that the restore process probably reformats the harddrive, blowing away any and all files (songs, videos, pictures) that you may have on that drive. So then while I was thinking about it, and finding some way to backup my files (I sent them over the network to that 320 GB drive which is on my old Athlon), I was installing a new program on the computer, and inadvertently installed it on the restore partition. Now before some smart one starts scorning me out for making me out for making such a mistake: that's easy to do here. All my other computers have multiple partitions, and all programs that can be installed to other drives are sent to the D: partition. Well, after that the restore disk-making process wouldn't work. So here I am with no way to make my system like new if I start to have trouble with it. I would not be likely to buy any computer from a company that doesn't include proper system and program disks, refurbished or not.

In my capacity as a delivery driver i saw MANY returns of previously discounted refurbished computers. As i was interested in and shopping for a computer myself, if available, i would discuss with the receiving or sending-back customer, the reasons behind the delivery/return. Inevitably the answers led me to this conclusion: delivery companies have many employees who WILL roughly handle the boxes despite any of their claims to the contrary. The supervisory personnel WILL inevitably stress speed over careful handling. i have witnessed sorting areas in which proper handling (which ought to be, at minimum, conscientious and respectful to the value and relative fragility of the contents) is nearly non existent. i have witnessed this same kind of attitude among my fellow delivery drivers of other competing delivery companies. They are penalized if their expected handling times are not met, ignored if they drop or bang a few packages about. The fault may lie with the contracting supplier always looking for a cheaper way to enhance their own bottom line. A refurbished computer or TV is hand-handled as an individual box. A new item is in a group of like-items strapped to a pallet and largely untouched during the delivery process except by fork lift. Delivered these pallets are unpacked at their destination by employees who know the sales value of the item and are thus mindful should it be dropped violently or mis-handled. And a personal experience of my own sealed the deal for me. i returned a damaged (but new) VCR to the appropriate refurbishing destination. It came back to me even more damaged than when i sent it. i returned it again and got the same result.

1335	137	286028	2808738	2718149	GeekInside	7/9/08 11:22 PM	1.21564572E12	Depends on the situation	This is a very tricky situation that can be looked at many ways and each side can have a valid point. I prefer now to build my own Desktops as it is a way to control the quality of every component in your system and eliminate potential problems from manufactures including but not limited to, bloatware, low-end/cheap components, and my most hated situation, partitioned hard drives with backup OS restoration/installation images. Again, building a desktop is not fullproof, as I can speak from experience at having received DOA motherboards and components. It can be very trying at times, but when utilizing a reputable parts distributor and having patience, I have never ran into a dead end and have always been satisfied with my end product. Besides, it can be a creative process that involves critical thinking to come up with problem solving solutions. In all reality, the best answer to this situation is education. I have purchased a refurbished desktop in the past, one for my girlfriend which had a 3-Month limited warranty on it. Died after 3 months of use and even sent it back to manufacturer as they extended support on it and the system still had problems. At first I really couldn't figure it out myself and finally turned it into a Linux box as the retarded factory installed partitioned OS restoration never worked, restoration disks never worked, and it was just driving me batty. Linux worked great (Amen for Ubuntu). Then we needed a PC for family so I worked on it some more, swapped out the motherboard (~$50.00, installed XP Pro, and the thing works amazingly now. So, I have even had a bad experience with refurbished product and still don't regret having made the purchase as I did get a good deal on it overall. For an average Joe, a refurbished/recertified PC can be much more cost effective. Yes, the cost of PCs have come down considerably, but as a prior individual mentioned, often you can get a system with better components on a refurb deal than a brand new system. Research has been my key to success. Never stop learning about what you are purchasing, and with PC's never stop learning about how they work. I went from a young boy with his first family PC Dell 133Mhz Win 95 (just after 486 disappeared), learning basic DOS prompt commands and knowing literally nothing about the way a system works, to getting a newer PC, and upgrading components to extend it's life, to just diving in, piecing together a system, and building it from board/processor on out. Still, recertified/refurbished products are valuable. I am as of tomorrow expecting a delivery of a Dell Laptop that has been reconditioned from return on executive lease program. Precision M70. Yes, it is from 2005 and it is not the most recent processor, but I know it will do everything I aim to use it for and more than some newer laptops. It carries within it a Graphics card that is still on the second rated list for mid-high-end graphic cards for laptops today with a dedicated 256MBs of Graphic Memory. With 6 rated lists, 1 being top, 6 being bottom rating, that is not bad at all. Includes 1Gig of RAM (Expandable to 2 Gigs), 60Gig Hard Drive (Easily replaced/upgrade or used with a portable external for data space expansion), and does not have VISTA! It has XP Pro, which I prefer and I believe it would match performance and program operation, graphic benchmarking, comparable if not exceeding marks of entry level new laptops available from manufactures today which would cost nearly twice as much as I am paying. In 2005, this laptop retailed for $2000-$3000.00. It was a desktop replacement unit for graphic designers, artists, engineers, and professionals needing full system power in a portable unit. I looked at budget laptops that are newer and they had nothing besides a more recent processor I was looking for. I will never suffice with an integrated graphics card which is standard in roughly 80-90% laptops, even if they have made many improvements. Additionally, I shall never utilize Win Vista as I see it being phased out before XP, and Microsoft has made a determination to support XP till 2012. By then, Vista will be gone. The XP Pro license the recertified laptop comes with is worth ~130.00 if I were to have to buy a new XP Pro installation disk/license today to remove Vista from a new laptop. I see no cons in the matter and I am in no way concerned about receiving a recertified/refurbished product. If you are willing to educate yourself you will find there is always a smart decision to be made concerning purchase of PC's and their components and to simply eliminate financial opportunities without understanding the principle knowledge behind them is foolish. I have purchased new, recertified/refurbished, and built PC's per Spec. Every situation needs to be examined separately and with research the appropriate answer should find its way to an educated individual. Would I buy a refurbished or recertified computer? Yes!

It was a gift to a growing family with 7 kids from grade thru high school that was still working for 4 years. I bought a refurbished Dell XPS, for personal use, for $1000 ($400 off), 5 years ago with first problems last year but still in use. I bought another refurbished Dell XPS 3 years ago, for $1100 (after $400 discount), for the same family, that did not have any issues until recently, but straightened out with-out professional help. In March 2008 I bought a &quot;recertified&quot; HP m9040n, Vista 32, Window Media, TV and Remote, from Buy.com, for $700, that I am very pleased with so far. However, I only got 90 day warranty so am still nervous. I will probably continue to consider refurbished/recertified PC's, because they have allowed me to buy better features, for less money, and at 81 on Social Security good PC's are a luxury
