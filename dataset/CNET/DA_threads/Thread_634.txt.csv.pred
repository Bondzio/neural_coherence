1.1.1	Hi, I am interested in purchasing a wireless router that has a USB port for external storage.	St
1.1.2	I like the idea of having a network attached storage that is always online, but my main intention of having external storage is to do backups.	St
1.1.3	I'm curious if it is feasible to do backups wirelessly?	St
1.1.4	and is there a software or freeware that can do this so that I can recover to a particular date or recover only particular file?	St
1.1.5	Regards	St
1.2.1	Works fine but some will flame that it's slower over the network.	St
1.2.2	Yup.	St
1.2.3	There are file size limits such as 4GG but that's a non-issue for me.	St
1.2.4	As to all your questions, it's &quot;yes.&quot; As to the backup software I use SYNCBACK (see google.com).	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
