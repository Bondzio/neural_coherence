Basically when I restart my computer or stand by for long periods, the monitor fails to communicate with my computer.
My configuration is this: Computer(GFX card w/ dual DVI-D ports) &gt; DVI-D to HDMI converter &gt; HDMI cable to monitor Please help me solve this problem, thanks!
I'm thinking this could be a driver issue, or the hardware isn't right.
Is there anything I could buy (&lt;$50 if possible) other than a new graphics card or motherboard that can give my computer a VGA or HDMI input?
