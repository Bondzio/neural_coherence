1.1.1	just set up a typical 2-PC home network ( a desktop & a laptop ) ... . both PCs running VISTA printer is local to desktop & shared successfully found & added the shared printer on the laptop system problem : when sending a single test document from the laptop , the print queue ( which started w/ zero documents ) now shows a count of 2 documents , but only the job i sent is listed in the pending documents ; and that job never prints on the desktop side , no pending documents are listed ; however , when I print from the desktop , the job shows up briefly on the laptop queue ( as it should ) if I cancel the test document on the laptop , a count of 1 still remains on the print queue , but no documents are in the list what am i missing ? ?	Ques
1.1.2	BIG THANKS TO ANYONE THAT CAN HELP	St
1.2.1	MSFT ( see google ) tends to call these issues COSMETIC as the system works but does what you wrote about .	St
1.2.2	Since it works , the printer prints they may leave such a bug unfixed .	St
1.2.3	This can upset those that have no history with MSFT .	St
1.2.4	Ok , one idea .	St
1.2.5	MANUALLY clear the print queue .	St
1.2.6	Here 's a google on that .	St
1.2.7	But my thought is if it is printing , why fix this ?	Ques

1.3.1	Hi , Bob .	St
1.3.2	Thanks for the reply .	St
1.3.3	I did clear the queue ( cancel the document ) manually .	St
1.3.4	Upon doing so I noted that the printer status window still showed that there was & quot ; 1 & quot ; document , although none listed in the queue .	St
1.3.5	It appears to me that the OS is creating something that is put & quot ; first in line & quot ; before my document Ultimately , MY document never printed from the laptop .	St
1.3.6	( no problems printing from the desktop ) I hope my attempt at this clarification is helpful .	St
1.3.7	Thanks again .	St
1.4.1	Uninstall the printer entirely and make a new instance .	St
1.4.2	Again , a MSFT issue .	St
1.4.3	They really need to make this stuff better .	St
