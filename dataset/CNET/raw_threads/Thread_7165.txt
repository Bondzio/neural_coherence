WD, is offering it as a &quot;bootable&quot; one that being the major point. You need to have these requirements in order to use it. 1) 64-bit OS 2) UEFI and GPT partitioning If you system needs it, WD will provide a small PCB card in order to better i/f the HD for compatibility. The 64-bit OS is very important as it addresses the capacity or volume issue, as 2.19Tb is the limit for 32-bit OS, thus the 64-bit OS need. There are other 3Tb out there but it seems the WD offered one is bootable, other will be storage only. tada -----Willy

Personally, I rather use 6-500G. or 3-1T instead (especially if the price comparison is about the same or not too much higher).

You're own answer offered 3x1Tb as a solution, I'm sure for others it'll be a 3Tb HD. As time goes by, while fairly common now, 1Tb is already starting to give way to 2Tb and that wasn't too long ago, some pie in the sky. While on the subject, persistent releases of SSD's are qrowing as well. So, a typical current 250gb HD maybe replaced by a 250gb SSD as costs go down. tada -----Willy
