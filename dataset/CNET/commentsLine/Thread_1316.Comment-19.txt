i don't have my pc in my entertainment center and my son a computer programmer used to have his hooked in some how because if he downloaded a program on his harddrive he would simply use his mouse to drag the program from his pc across and onto the large screen tv.
i think he just had the audio video card hooked from the pc to the entertainment center.
this way he was able to drag from one screen to the next much like using several monitors to do high tech work using each for different tasks.
i really don't know how he accomplished it but i'm not a programmer.
he is and he didn't seem to have any trouble at except lining up the video on the screen of the tv but that was because it was in a different room.
we would watch tv from pc long ago well at least two or three years.
in computer time its ages.
if you have an a/v card you can hook up your pc to it especially for sound effects and gaming.
