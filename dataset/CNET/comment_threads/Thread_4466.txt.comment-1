Hi guys well I think its finally time to make the jump from CRT to LCD (mainly for space reasons).
My new apt is a bit smaller and I need the room on my desk I cant have my monitors taking up all the room.
Currently I'm using two Dell P991 monitors that have served me well for along time.
I do a lot of video work, premiere, avid, after effects etc.... so let the suggestions start pouring in please.
I would like to stick with two 19&quot; monitors what do you guys recommend?
