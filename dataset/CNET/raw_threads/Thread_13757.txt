Will tell you the processor temp, HD temp, even the color of the shoe laces on the guy that soldered the mother board. Excellent. Free. Better and easier than the others mentioned as I have used them. Then uninstalled them in favor of Everest. http://www.lavalys.com/products/overview.php?pid=1&lang=en Wayne Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach that person to use the Internet and they won't bother you for weeks.
