3452	0	140511	1577064	NR	JMoore_	12/2/05 6:03 PM	1.13354658E12	Building a PC	I'm looking to build a multi purpose PC for gaming, internet browsing, multimedia etc. This will be the first time I have built a computer so I don't have much knowledge on what components to get. I've done a bit of research (reading reviews) but have found it difficult to find information on mid-range PCs. I have a budget of approximately $1200. I am keen on an AMD Athlon 64 CPU and a GeForce graphics card but I was hoping for some help on what components to get. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks...James.

If so do you want to use 2 cheap cards (6600 gt) or get one better card 7800GT and upgrade later? EVGA periodically runs Nforce 4 SLI motherboard + 7800GT packages at a discount. I've seen these at Newegg.com . How large a hard drive would you like? How much ram? Do you care more about silence or about performance? Do you want a multicore system or a single core system? Do you plan to over clock?

I was probably just looking at a single card at the moment and was seriously looking at the 6600 GT. I'm in New Zealand so prices are a little higher than in the US. I was hoping for at least 200GB hard drive and at least 1GB RAM - what brand do you recommend for RAM? will I need DDR2? I was hoping for a quiet system and I think single core will be fine. I do not plan to overclock. What do you recommend? Many thanks...James

I'm in New Zealand, so prices are a bit higher here, meaning I might have to downgrade some of the components. I was looking at Gigabyte GA-K8NXP-9 mobo - is Gigabyte a good brand? Thanks again and any more more suggestions would be greatly appreciated. James.

US$1200. Were you referring to the ASUS mobo or the Gigabye mobo as being to expensive? I may get a raptor for the OS only and corsair HDDs for storage. I'll definately want a PCI-e 6600 GT. Any more suggestins appreciated. Thanks.

Of course you won&quot;t need the Office. Just an example her. Good luck and you'll have fun building it!

Is there anyone in the USA that you would trust running shipping detail with? You could buy at the listed vendors and use their address. They could, then, ship your items to you. You would be able to get those items at the listed cost.

I've heard good things about Gigabyte. Here's my recommendation for video card brands starting with the best: Asus EVGA BFG Leadtek Gigabyte XFX Any of these I believe would make a great card. It is believed by some that Asus gets first pick of nVidia chips. I don't buy Asus video cards but only because of the added cost for the best. I believe, personally, that EVGA or any of these other brands would be more than satisfactory for me and my budget. I do have an Asus video card, a 6200 TurboCache, and it runs great but I got it for no other reason than to get my new build up and running and this was the lowest priced, best brand I could find. I paid $47 for it. You can certainly find a less costly card, and other components but, I listed what I would buy for myself. In fact, Gigabyte has a 6600GT at Newegg for $119.

3452	18	140511	1579210	1579032	martylk2	12/4/05 5:45 AM	1.1336751E12	I checked the local vendors here and came up...	with nothing. I, then, did a Google on the model number of that card you found and came up with a number of New Zealand web sites. So, apparently, it is a NZ card and not available here in USA. If it serves your purpose, go for it. The more memory the better. But I noticed those prices and was shocked. I don't think that, for the cost, 256MB of memory is worth it.

I'm in New Zealand so prices are a little higher than in the US.&quot; I see. If it is anything like Bermuda or the Bahamas, I'm sure that you would pay rather nasty tarrifs in exchange for your view. Do you have to buy from a NZ company, or can your purcahse from an American one and pay import duties? &quot; was hoping for at least 200GB hard drive and at least 1GB RAM - what brand do you recommend for RAM? will I need DDR2? &quot; The Maxtor Maxline III 200 GB and Seagate 7200.8 are good drives. Samsung drives are a bit slower, but are quieter. The current AMD processors do not support DDR-2 memory. Besides the combined access speed of these tend to be higher (ie worse) than with DDR memory. Any decent RAM with a CAS of 3-3-3-6 or better is fine. Damastar55r had a pretty good list of components. &quot;Case-$100? PSU-$50 Windows XP Home-90 Arctic Silver Thermal Compound-$8 AMD Athlon 64 3200+-$142 1GB DDR PC3200RAM (CorsairValue)-$90 250GB Hard Drive SATA-$110 Evga 6800GS-$210 Sound Blaster Xi-Fi Extreme Music-$122 MSI or Gigabyte Motherboard Nforce4 Non-SLI-90 NEC 3550-A DL DVD+_RW Burner-40&quot; However, since you want a quiet system, I suggest the Antec Sonata II as a case. In the states you can get one with a 480 watt PSU for about $110. Unless you are mixing music, I see no reason to have a sound card. NForce 4 motherboards have 7.1 sound. EVGA, Foxconn, and Asus are also good motherboard manufacturers. I would suggest that you get an AMD Athlon 64 4000, which runs for about $330 in the US. It is the fastest non FX chip.
