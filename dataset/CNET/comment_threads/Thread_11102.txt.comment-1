I have just gone from Windows 2000 to Windows XP Professional, full, clean install, and now my graphics card is being recognized only as a PCI card (under the cards properties it says that the location is PCI 1), also I know that it there is a problem because every time I load up Savage, it tells me that my card is in PCI mode and this will cause problems, which it does.
I have tried uninstalling the card, reinstalling it, using an older card (that still came up as PCI), and had no joy with anything.
My PC Specs are as follows: Windows XP Pro SP1 Abit AT7 Max2 Motherboard AMD Athlon XP 2600+ Galaxy Geforce FX 5200 (the other card I tried was an ABIT GeForce Ti 4200) 1GB PC2700 RAM NOTE: I have noticed a few people suggesting that you need to reformat reinstall to resolve this problem, however, seeing as that's what I have just done, I don't see how that would have any effect.
Any ideas or suggestions would be much appreciated.
Cheers Ben
