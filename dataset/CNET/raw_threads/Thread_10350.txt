Can hear a spinning sound like it's trying to move. Was working fine. Have checked all settings and all appear to be correct. Any suggestions? I'm not a techie so simple answers would help greatly. Thanks!

If it can't print a self-test page, then likely the printer is hosed. Check to see that the ink carts are firmly seated and/or if any blinking leds are present on the printer. Until, you do a self-test don't mess with windows at all, you may cause further problems. Also, the support website at HP should explain common problems and resolutions. You can aslo try the printer's &quot;toolbox&quot; if applicable for your model, it should provide some insight and maybe a self-test as well. good luck -----Willy

As Willy pointed out, look for a blinking light. Can mean many things, including a paper jam.
