worked for this large-scale healthcare employer for almost two years now.
actually they had to gift something on doctor's day, and apparently they came out with this brilliant idea of 64mb flash drive (don't know where they purchased them from).
now 64mb is a great size for carrying documents and even pictures (like patient x-ray jpegs etc), but i'm going to use my 8gb flash drive for that purpose.
it's the smallest flash drive i've ever had, and i really want to experiment with it, in that how much &quot;usefulness&quot; can fit into it.
