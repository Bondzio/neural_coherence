A 6150 will &quot;work&quot; for gaming, but is not the best choice given the plethora of cheap cards on the market that will easily outperform low-end cards from the past. - Vr/Z..&gt;&gt;

So make sure you check the video card power requirements before making the final purchase. Otherwise you might end up forking up another $50 to $100 for a new Power Supply too. VAPCMD
