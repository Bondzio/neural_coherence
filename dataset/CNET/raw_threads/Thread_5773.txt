It's a burner. The problem is that it plays some of my DVD movies and some it won't recognize in the drive. The drive also doesn't recongize my game DVDs. The drive thinks that there is no DVD in the drive. This happened after I had installed a No-DVD patch on a game that I wanted to play on 2 computers at the same time but only had one disk.
