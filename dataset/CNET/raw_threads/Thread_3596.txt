If it helps at all, this is my video card: XFX Nvidia 5200 http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=588461 mine is the same except it is 128mb instead of 256. I no this most likely isn't possible but just wanted to make sure. Also, would it be possible with a better video card?

Conect the CRT to the VGA 15 pin D-sub, use the analog adapter (fits on the DVI port and makes it a VGA 15 pin like the other one) connect the LCD, and configure them using the Nvidia drivers. *Note* you may want to update the Nvidia drivers for your card from the Nvidia website. Once you've accomplished this, if you have trouble configuring the driver settings, post back here and I'll try to help you out.

And, i checked the box for the video card and I am 99% sure I can support dual monitor. My question is now, If I am wrong about these 2 statements, let me know. My main question is tho, how would I use dual monitor. Like, would it play the game for example on both monitors, or could I use one monitor for the game and another for another program? Lastly, ius it easy to setup up dual monitor?

Some games like WOW allow you to do that. You just have to select that in the games video options. For the games that run in a window it's great so that you can IM or run other apps at the same time as playing. After you go with Dual monitors you'll never want to go single again, it makes so many things so much easier. Also, I use a CRT and LCD combination. My Desk
14849	6	139397	1567412	1567120	cv4stm	11/28/05 1:00 PM	1.1331828E12	so...	as long as I play the game in a window, I can do 2 things at once. What if I didn't, would it be split across the 2 screens? Also, what about regular programs. Like, say I was using Mozilla and iTunes at the same time. Could I make it so one monitor has iTunes on it and one has Mozilla. Also, whatever I did on one monitor, would it happen on the other? Like, if I am on Mozilla on the CRT, and I moved my cursor to say close the window, would it be moved on the other one as well? If not, how would I switch between monitors? Sorry about all the questions, I am just very new on this whole thing.

Right-click on the desktop and select properties. Select settings. You should see two monitors (1 and 2). Below the monitors should be two check boxes (probably greyed out). If you see two monitors, click on &quot;2.&quot; The two checkboxes should now be available. Select the second box (Extend my Windows...). Full-screen applications like WoW will run on one monitor only, but will change the resolution of both monitors. Maximized apps, like Mozilla will maximize in one screen only, but can be dragged to whatever screen you want. You can also resize them manually to both screens at the same time. (Be aware that, although you can have different resolutions on each monitor, I don't recommend it. It makes screen swapping much harder to get used to.) With two monitors, you will be able to have, say, your word processor and web browser up at the same time. Moving between them is easy; just move your mouse to the monitor of your choice. It's like an extension of your desktop. Gwee

Some one else posted that after using dual monitors you will never go back to one. To this I will agree. Set it up and enjoy.... Bill
