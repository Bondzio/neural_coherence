in the near future i plan to build my own pc, the problem i encounter is the graphics card, i want an ati radeon hd 4770, i life in spain and all that i can find is asus/xfx/club 3d/powercoler/sapphire + radeon hd 4770, and nothing like ati radeon hd 4770, is not even listed on amd spain site, the question is: 1) the only difference between these cards and ati radeon hd 4770 is the name?
the perfomance will be the same on all cards?
2) 128-bit, is it a big problem?
