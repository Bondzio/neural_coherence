Im looking for a web cam that works well with AIM video chatting.
I have the Logitech QuickCam Pro 4000 but that seems to not be working correctly anymore.
A message comes up saying that the &quot;request has timed out&quot;.
So if anyone knows a web cam that works well with AIM please let me know.
Thanks.
