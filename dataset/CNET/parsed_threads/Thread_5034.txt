<s> I recently got a new pc and would like to put the hd from my old one in it. </s>
<s> The new pc is running xp pro, the old one is win98se. </s>
<s> Is this possible? </s>
<s> For 99% of us, you set the old drive to CABLE SELECT and plug that into the SLAVE IDE connection, add a power connection and boot up to explore your old drive's content. </s>

<s> Will I be able to transfer files between the two? </s>
<s> New he is ntfs, old is fat32. </s>
<s> Just got the old hd out and there are only settings shown for master, slave and single? </s>
<s> Ignore my last post. </s>
<s> I have been doing some reading, Cable select requires a special cable right? </s>
<s> Since my old drive has no cs setting wouldn't I just set them as master and slave? </s>
<s> Would this cause any problems? </s>
<s> I don't mean to sound like an idiot but it has been 8-10 years since I have done this! </s>
<s> Somewhere I read that because one is ntfs and the other fat32 there might be problems? </s>
<s> Thanks Mike </s>
<s> Set-up the old HD as a slave </s>
<s> connected the data and power cables ...and GO ! </s>
<s> The question is what can you cable the old HDD to in the new system ? </s>
<s> Is the hard drive in the new system connected to the hard drive by a long skinny cable (SATA) or is it connected to the hard drive by a wide flat cable (PATA)? </s>
<s> Perhaps it would help if you identified new system's HDD...make and model number. </s>
