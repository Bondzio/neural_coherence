Thank you for the link.
I have a 256 mb Lexar jumpdrive 2.0 (I got for $50 on e-bay).
It has worked like a charm with my lap top, even when I used it on a Mac.
I am thinking that a 1 gig stick would be even better and before I went out looking for one, I would see if a particular brand is better than another.
I guess they are really like floppies and all about the same quality.
