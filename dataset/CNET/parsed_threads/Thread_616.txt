<s> I will be going home soon, after finishing up a several year job I'm in. </s>
<s> So, I've been trying to plan out how I am going to have the same setup I have now, with tv, ps3, xbox, printer, network storage, etc etc. </s>
<s> All I have now is a wireless router, with all ports(4) being used, and a lot of things using wireless. </s>
<s> Going home, there will be even more on the network(families computers and such), so I came up with an idea.. if the idea works. </s>
<s> I'm no networking expert, however I will be going to school to learn. </s>
<s> Anyway, my plan if possible is this.. ISP - Switch - 1st port to my families wireless router, and a 2nd port to my wireless router, and each in their own vlan to separate them completely from each other. </s>
<s> I'll will only use those 2 ports on the switch. </s>
<s> And I will connect everything I have to only my router, and the rest of the family can use just their router. </s>
<s> Is this possible? </s>
<s> Or am I way off? </s>
<s> And if I am right do you have any suggestions for home-use switches? </s>
<s> Thank you for your help in advance. </s>
<s> As you will need a second internet IP it usually doubles the monthly fees. </s>
<s> You could do like me and set up your &quot;router as a WAP&quot; (see google) and connect a LAN port on the first router to the LAN port of the second router to get your own WiFi. </s>
<s> WiFi gets clogged up fast so why not your own? </s>

<s> If both routers were having all their ports used, would this be an easy/correct setup? </s>
<s> ISPs Modem &gt; Uplink Port of Wired Router &gt; Port 1 and Port 2 of Wired Router to Uplink Ports for the Two Wireless Routers? </s>
<s> I would not do that setup. </s>
<s> But as you thought it through what will happen, why not? </s>
<s> That is, any setup you want can be done if you want it to. </s>
<s> But here I go with setups we use and support. </s>
<s> I don't see how that setup would be easy. </s>
