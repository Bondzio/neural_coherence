First off, I'll say I'm not a fan of buying computers remotely.
I've done it a lot before (because of where I worked) and had DOA computers from a couple different manufacturers.
If what you get doesn't work, what are you gonna do?
Mess with it yourself to try to fix it?
Or give up the time & expense for a return or shipping for repair.
A refurbished one has already been used and returned once.
Secondly, the poster's handle is softcoregamer.
Is a machine without a dedicated graphics card going to suit your needs?
Lastly, what's the motivation for 4 GB RAM?
