we have the two name brands and the model numbers but the driver would be the monitor driver.
this is not so much a driver but a file called monitor.inf that let's windows know what settings to show for that monitor.
you can google monitor.inf if you want to learn what these files do.
as i noted, i find many don't want to install these so a trip to a good shop is often the cure.
then again, you just bought the machine from who?
maybe they'll fix this for you.
