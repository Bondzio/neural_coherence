<s> I have a hard drive from a computer I used to have which seems to have stopped working after the motherboard in the same computer burned out. </s>
<s> I have since tried the drive in my new PC, configured as a slave and the original (new pc) drive as master; however, configured this way, not even the master will start. </s>
<s> the computer powers up and goes through the BIOS check but will go no further, just hangs at a blank screen. </s>
<s> The drive also failed to work in another, third computer as well. </s>
<s> The jumper settings are correct-- is it possible that the drive was damaged when the motherboard went out, or possibly even got a static zap? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> Your hard drive is sure dead. </s>
<s> It is typical that such failures will stop a good drive working (master in this case). </s>
<s> Forget trying the electronics is dead. </s>
