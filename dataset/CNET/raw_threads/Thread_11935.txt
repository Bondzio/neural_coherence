You should go to the store and ask your question of those that sell these things. If they won't answer, then don't buy there. Eventually you'll get your answers and maybe a nice tablet too. Bob

But I owned the Asus Transformer TF101 and I really liked it, the only reason I sent it back was because I found it cheaper online and I desided to wait for the Asus Transformer Pad 300...tho I do not know if the 300 comes with GPS. I didn't get the Xoom because its the oldest of the tablets, the acer was really heavy and I read some bad reviews on it as far as video playback..plus the asus had the dock which the others didnt.

Asus found other supplies during the difficult time when the TF101 was being released. Trust me, not the same Asus quality we have known for years. I sold the Asus TF101 and all it's issues basically because of the reputation that Asus &quot;had&quot;. So, I bought the Asus TF201 thinking the quality problems would be over come. WRONG !! Where's the quality control? The TF201 best points was that it made a good door stop. For a few extra dollars I will buy a &quot;quality&quot; tablet made by Apple where the quality control is supreme.

Laptop magazine listed subsidized 3g/4g tablets in the top 10 charges you'd be an idiot to pay. They took a Galaxy Tab from Verizon selling for 429 with a 2 year contract (which is 30 a month). They calculated that 949 over the life of the contract and the wifi version is 448. I suggest a Wifi Tablet and use your phone for GPS. Now if you don't have a smartphone thats a different story. I know my phone GPS helped me in Pittsburgh when the cd in the dashboard GPS failed.
