If so some fiber washers on top of the mounting studs can help. http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=MOTHERBOARD+MOUNTING+FIBER+WASHERS&btnG=Google+Search&aq=f&oq=

I used this as an example of how to use what common part I see in most cases or motherboard mounting kits. Any shop that sells PC parts (not Best Bu, Gold Max or such will have such) should have them.

You my need to replace the motherboard or video card. Listen for arching electricity. A sure sign the gap is too wide. Look for a black sooty residue on the AGP/PCI/PCIe slot, this means it's been arching. Arching is bad news. What temperatures is this card running at? Over 70C and you have a problem. Approaching 70C might be a problem for some boards, over 66C or more. check with the manufacturer of the card for the upper temperature limits for this card. High operating temperatures might be a sign of poor connectivity between the card and the board. http://www.download.com/SpeedFan/3000-2094_4-10067444.html?tag=mncol&cdlPid=10834076 The note &gt;&gt;&gt; removing static discharge: http://www.scribd.com/doc/2249041/electrostatic-discharge Care should be exercised whenever dealing with electricity.
