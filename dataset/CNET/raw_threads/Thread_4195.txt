The mobo doesn't boot at all, no beep, giving black screen I already tried these steps: I did the test with minium hardware i.e. 1 RAM, no cd-rom, no HDD -I have tried removing the RAM and the mobo does give me the 3 beeps warning code -From ASUS webpage it suggests that the mobo might need an updated BIOS to run E7400, however even when I tested with a working E6300 it still doesn't work -start without a cpu gives me no beep (with & without RAM, I guess thats normal?) Wondering if my mobo is broken... My PSU is about 3yrs old but working fine on my old pc. not sure if thats the reason either. Here is the spec of my pc: CPU: Intel E7400 Mobo: ASUS P5KL/1600 Ram: Corsair xms2 2G x 2 graphics card: 6600GT (using this old card in case there isn't enough power...) PSU: Antec Neo HE 430
