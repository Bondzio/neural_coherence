The one in my room didn't seem to be working, so I ran a cable to the other jack (my roommate's) and I can access the net fine with that one. I called the apartment complex's tech people and they sent a guy with his laptop. He proceded to connect his laptop to the jack in my room and it worked for him. He then told me I probably had a faulty network card and should buy a new one. But every store I've been to said it's probably a settings-related problem. Thoughts? I'm running WinXP and have had my network card for about 3 years. It's a NETGEAR FA311 fast ethernet adapter. On the box it says it is compatible with XP, but the documentation inside makes no mention of XP-compatibility. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

The thing is, they both seemed to work for the tech guy when he plugged his laptop in. My roommate isn't moving in till Tuesday, so I haven't checked with his computer yet.
