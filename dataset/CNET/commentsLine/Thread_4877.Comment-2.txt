i recently bought an hp media center pc that comes bundled with the f2105 21&quot; lcd monitor.
it is fantastic.
in addition to being a pc monitor, it is also hdtv ready.
i got a comcast hd cable box and hooked it up to the monitor.
fantastic!
i think i spend more time watching hdtv then working on the pc.
the only problem i find with this monitor is that it doesn't have any vidio inputs (s-video, component video) for connecting a dvd player or other components.
otherwise, i highly recommend this monitor.
