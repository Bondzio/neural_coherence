<s> Ok I have a Dell E520 series. </s>
<s> Long story short my old pc died and had to use my student loan money and had to order from dell or HP. </s>
<s> ok so i have 2.8GHz intel core 2 duo 256mb xfx 8600GTS (added) 3gb of ram (added) windows vista home premium 32bit and the crappy mobo they give you is basically bottle necking my proformance so I want to upgrade my mobo but to do that, i need to get a new CPU fan, PSU, and case because Dell make everything just for there parts. </s>
<s> well none of that is the issue, my issue is if I get a new motherboard and plug in the hard-drive i am using right now will my current Vista system work? </s>
<s> Will the Vista Reinstallation DVD that came with the system work? </s>
<s> Ive herd so many un-sure and mixed answers that I want to be 100% sure before I spend money on these parts. </s>
<s> Still a maybe. </s>
<s> It shouldn't work since the license is only for the Dell but you read that some succeed. </s>
<s> Dell's answer should be &quot;no.&quot; As to the bottleneck the only one I see is the 8600 card. </s>
<s> Gamers usually go for the 8800. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Well im not looking to play Crysis and I dont have any need for an 8800 yet. </s>
<s> But the memory speed and PCIe speed on my motherboard are so bad that I cant hit any benchmarks that my computer should be able to hit. </s>
<s> I called Dell and the guy I talked to said it would work but the people they have working there arnt the brightest in the world. </s>
<s> If you get a different brand of motherboard, your current windows won't load, so re-intalling windows is a must. </s>
<s> I have tried to use the XP installation that comes with Dell on my other pc, but the CD's protection didn't allow me to do it. </s>
<s> On another note, keep in mind that a lot of these installation disks that come with dell, sony, or toshiba computers are not actual windows instalation disks; they are image disks. </s>
<s> So, they probably (almost certain) won't work on your new mobo. </s>
<s> The kind of control that you want to have over the different parts in your pc is not easy to accomplish when you are working with a &quot;package&quot; pc built by dell or any other manufacturer. </s>
<s> thank you so much your are the first person to answer my question </s>
<s> You want to upgrade your mtrbd, thus that tells me you want to keep the mtrbd.. </s>
<s> If not, then you replace the mtrbd. </s>
<s> you will have problems. </s>
<s> As the other poster mentioned, you will need a new OS install CD, as most OEM type CDs provide install only for the system or brand they were sold under. </s>
<s> While you can swap much of the old system(h/w) to a new mtrbd. </s>
<s> you're stuck getting the drivers when the new OS has been installed. </s>
<s> Vista, being a PITA if you stay with it, may not have Vista available drivers from their vendors once you correctly ID the proper drivers needed. </s>
<s> If you stay with the old mtrb. </s>
<s> and the whole purpose was to reduce or remove bottleneck, then really what was the point if you blame the mtrbd. </s>
<s> as the bottleneck fault. </s>
<s> Be sure to check Dell's support website for any bios updates that may address some issues and if they apply to you, then you need them. </s>
<s> Hopefull, that may address yopur bottleneck issue. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
