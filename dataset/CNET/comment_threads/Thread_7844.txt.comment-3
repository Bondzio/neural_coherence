It's not completely clear to me what you mean.
Assuming you have a bare hard drive not installed in anything, you can buy an enclosure for it for about $20 and connect to your computer via a USB cable.
But then I don't know why WiFi would be a factor.
If you're talking about connecting a PC to a network via WiFi, you can buy a USB adapter that does that nicely for as little as $10.
Good luck.
