Recently my computer (home built with asus mobo and ultra 400w power supply)was hit by lightning and thus it would no longer powerup no mobo lights. I bought a new power supply ultra 500w to replace it. I put it in the computer and it powered up fine, and I ran it normaly for hours until I went to bed. I turned off the computer and the next time I tryed to use it no mobo lights and no power up. I replace the power supply with an identical from the manufacturer. I plugged it in and again it ran fine until I left the computer off for some time. I guess the mother board is feeding back and burning up the power supply only when the computer is powered off. I would like to know if my guess is sound, but I have never heard of this so alternate theories or suggestions of repair are needed.

I suggest you pull AC plug at the psu next time(5min.), replug when ready for use, it should reboot again. Of course, it can be your HD as well. Otherwise, I normally suspect the mtrbd. is getting flaky and/or the start ckt. is kaput, no fix, but replace. Don't take anything for granted, test elsewhere and rebuild system. tada -----Willy
