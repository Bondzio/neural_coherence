<s> I have a 1.4Ghz Pentium 4 Gateway with SuSe Linux installed. </s>
<s> I would like to network it (as a file server) with my Windows XP MCE05 Sony. </s>
<s> I have both connected to a Linksys hub, but I can't seem to get either to recognize the other. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Also, I have a 1.2Ghz P4 Dell PC running Windows XP Home. </s>
<s> It too is connected to the hub. </s>
<s> On this PC, it can 'see' the Sony, but the Sony does not show the Dell and I cannot access either from the other... </s>
<s> I know I'm doing something tragically wrong here... Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> You should be able to search in this forum for it, since many question and answer already given.. </s>
