hi jm, again, thank you!
i know that computing is still a learning experience, and for this user a day-to-day learning experience.
no matter, when buying any peripheral for the computer including the scanner i know that i need to expect the least and then what i do manage to get won't be so disappointing.
i will most likely be calling on you again, time-to-time for advice.
i really appreciate all that you've done to help me along the way.
have a great day!
:)
