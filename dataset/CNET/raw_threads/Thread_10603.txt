The kid moves around a lot and doesnt stay in front of the webcam and I think it would be convenient if we had a wireless/bluetooth webcam which we can point at the kid wherever he goes. Does anybody have any suggestions for a wireless/bluetooth webcam for this application? Thanks.

Today this would likely be a wifi webcam but nothing seems to fit what I would think a consumer could use. Almost all of them require some networking knowledge and you telling the person on the other side how to view said camera. If you are technically inclined and could rig battery power to such, here's a possible unit. http://www.wifi-forum.com/wf/showthread.php?t=65613&highlight=battery You'll find that the price could kill this idea.
