thanks for the info.
no, i don't have hd capability, and the cable box has only rf and a single rca video connector (composite?).
there is also an rs-232 connector.
i will see if they offer a cable box with a dvi connector.
i doubt that the composite is useable with no scan included.
i have a computer monitor, not tv monitor.
