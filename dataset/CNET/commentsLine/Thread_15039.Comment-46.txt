i suggest you read glenlo's post again.
it wasn't a question imo but a very sarcastic commentary on graham's post.
i stand by my original reply to glenlo.
it appears as of this writing that other astute members agree (12).
however, i realize there will always be those who disagree (3) as do you.
open discourse is what this forum is about and sometimes requires one to read between the lines in order to fully grasp the true meaning of what is actually being communicated.
if, i interpreted glenlo's remarks incorrectly...then my apologies.
i hope you continue to participate in this forum and i look forward to reading your comments/suggestions to graham's and future questions posted in this forum.
together everyone achieves more
