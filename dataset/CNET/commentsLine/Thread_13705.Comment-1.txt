just from reading what i have so far.
wireless networking appears to be an access to the internet/isp, without wires.
it sounds as if rather than having an dial-up access to the internet or a dsl/cable connection you have a reauter.
i am not so sure about my above interpetation though.
because it's called wireless networking so i suppose you must have more than one computer operating off of this reuter; but dont you have to have the reuter near or in the computer (whatever a reuter is)?
i guess my main question is not so much what wireless networking is...i guess i want to know how does it affect the family pc?
is wireless networking replacing dsl and cable isp's in the home?
or is it just a business thing.
second is wireless networking just a connection to the internet; do you still need to have an internet service provider?
o.k.
i know you can tell that i am very knew to using computers and internet service providers.
as i type i'm just switching from dial-up to cable.
so please be gentle towards me &quot;a novice&quot; in your answers.
thank you!
