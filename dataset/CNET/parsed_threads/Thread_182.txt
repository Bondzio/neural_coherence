<s> Hi there. </s>
<s> I thought i would post this question as i am really starting to bang my head against a brick wall at work. </s>
<s> Basically the story goes like this. </s>
<s> We have just got some new work pc's that were built by our local IT man that comes in now and again. </s>
<s> They are pentium 4 3ghz with 1gb Ram ATI radeon graphics etc. </s>
<s> Well the thing is we manufacture printed circuit boards and these are used as design/editing purposes. </s>
<s> There are 4 of them connected together using licence software etc. </s>
<s> My computer decides to restart itself whenever it bloody pleases usually when i am smack bang in the middle of a job ***###f*** From experience i would say the power supply is an issue. </s>
<s> Don't get me wrong i know a fair bit about hardware and have built many systems. </s>
<s> When the computer boots into windows, it says i have recovered from a serious error. </s>
<s> It recommends i update the bios. </s>
<s> I tell my manager about this, who basically thinks she knows everything about computers... she thinks it's a software issue, i just look at her and laugh and just pretend i know nothing just to keep the peace. </s>
<s> Also i have noticed on all 4 computers that they have random freeze ups doing very simple tasks like opening wordpad, excel spreadsheets etc. </s>
<s> Is there something i could do that doesn't involve the bios as i would hate to flash it and it mess up and i get me nuts chewed off. </s>
<s> cheers guys sorry for the long post </s>
<s> They are new and it's time to call the maker to make good on the machines. </s>
<s> That's why some don't build their own machines... -&gt; If you are on the hook to fix it, dive into the Event Viewer for clues. </s>
<s> A recent fix found there was an audio driver that was from the supplied CD. </s>
<s> Updated that and no more random boot. </s>
<s> Makes you wonder why they pack a defective driver on the CD? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> i looked at the event viewer out of interest it is full of red crosses it was like spot the i. </s>
<s> This was both in system and application. </s>
<s> cheers </s>
