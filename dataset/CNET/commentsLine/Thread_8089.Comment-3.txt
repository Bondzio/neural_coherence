i really appreciate you responding... yes they have.
i understand that my intial step is getting a isp or in my case a wisp, they install the satelite which sends signal to the hn9000 modem they have also provided then we have a linksys wrt120n home router which sends the signal to our laptop.
i think i was asking the question wrong.
all this technicality has me a bit confused.
like considering rf principles, 2.4ghz dsss (direct sequence spread spectrum), basic antenna properties, etc.. how to i factor all of these things in my equipment?
i mean i know 2.4ghz max.
bandwidth is 1 watt for the intentional radiator, the only nonoverlapping channels are 1, 6, and 11. i also know that dsss supports 1 or 2 mbps.
i am not trying to give you a lesson or be a wise guy by no means.
i really do appreciate any knowledge you could share with me.
i was just showing you that i am learning, just having trouble putting it all together.
i guess i am trying to make this project more difficult than it actually is.
i am one of those people that has to go above and beyond or i am not satisfied, which in reality is a downfall sometimes.
again, thank you.
