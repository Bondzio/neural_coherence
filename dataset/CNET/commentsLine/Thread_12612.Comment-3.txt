my intentions are to charge correctly, i understand how important it is to not leave the charger plugged in for more than it requires (battery memory).
even if i were to charge incorrectly and in about a year my battery charge is only half of what it should be then that would be an even more reason to get a longer battery life, a battery with 4 hours becomes 2 hours after a year vs a battery with 11 hours becomes 5.5 hours after a year, thats a huge diff.
as far as xp, i read somewhere that you cant install xp after windows 7 has been installed (dont know why or how it makes sense) even if it is possible to install xp, thats extra cash that i dont have to purchase xp.
i wouldnt mind going with the 1005 or any asus netbook that is around 300.00 and has a 8 to 11 hour battery life, but i cant find any that has xp, if it does it has a 3 to 4 hour battery life.
