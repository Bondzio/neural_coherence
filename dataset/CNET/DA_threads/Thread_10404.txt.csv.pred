1.1.1	I have a TSST corp DVD+-RW TS-H653A and it has stopped working .	St
1.1.2	It will let me read a read cd but will not write .	St
1.1.3	Can anyone help .	Ques
1.2.1	Did you try the usual CD/DVD lens cleaner and then swap the drive out ?	Ques
1.3.1	Yes I tried that and it still will not work , any other ideals ?	Ques
1.3.2	Do you think I need to replace .	St
1.4.1	When Bob wrote & quot ; swap the drive out & quot ; he meant & quot ; replace & quot ; .	St
1.4.2	So it 's : no , I did n't yet .	St
1.4.3	Better do .	St
1.4.4	Kees	St
1.5.1	I did n't go down the road or try much else .	St
1.5.2	When I see what you wrote I reach for a new drive so I can remove the failed drive and put in the new one .	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	So everyone thinks I should replace even if the drive is on 1 1/2 years old .	St
1.7.1	case as even a 1 year old burner can still fail to burn after that , that is unless you have another spare one lying around to test it out .	St
1.7.2	Factors includes heavy usage , type of disc used , production fault for some examples .	St
1.8.1	Want to thank all of you will stay away from Dell if this is the problem , you guys are great .	Polite
1.9.1	Dell uses the same drives that you get in most other makes .	St
1.9.2	Why do you think the machine maker is the cause ?	Ques
1.10.1	of being unfortunate batch received .	St
1.10.2	similar to mobile phones in which not all batches are produced with same longivety , and odd ones will slip out .	St
1.10.3	Quality checks are also randomly selected , thus , it may have een missed .	St
1.10.4	One wo n't go checking all million of manufactured ones as it will take ages to complete .	St
1.10.5	Likewise , like some previous battery recalls , some of those with faults have been shipped out , and although not all of the same batches may be affected .	St
1.10.6	I have unfortunate experience before with such stuffs and this is despite my friend have the same stuff from the same batch , his was ok and vice versa .	St
1.10.7	So , yup , that 's why I mentioned it as possibility .	St
1.11.1	The drive to get the costs down to lowest possible has resulted in drives that last about a year or two .	St
1.11.2	I think you expected 5 years of use .	St
1.11.3	Bob	St
1.12.1	I expected to have a drive that at the very least lasted 3 yrs .	St
1.12.2	But yea you are right , just have to watch out .	St
1.12.3	I have had problems with this company before .	St
1.13.1	With these DVDRW drives hitting 20 bucks they last 1 or 2 years under & quot ; use. & quot ; Dell has no exclusive on these failures .	St
1.13.2	You should see them on all make machines .	St
1.13.3	At least we are talking under 40 for most desktops .	St
1.13.4	Bob	St
