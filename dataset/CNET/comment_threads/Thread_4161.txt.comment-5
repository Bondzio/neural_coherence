Found this driver updater on CNET site.
It was just added 6/8/11.
I'd like to think this would be a safe download that wouldn't cause my PC to get the wrong drivers and thus create problems only a PC tech could fix.
Do you have any opinions about this software?

I ordered the PC online from Target and had it shipped to me.
