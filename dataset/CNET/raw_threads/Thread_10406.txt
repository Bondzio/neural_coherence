This is becoming an increasing hard to find but online shops do carry it. I checked crucial.com and it doesn't carry it. If you're lucky a local shop may have it just be sure of any return policy and definetly for Dell 8100 as RDRAM. Beware, it is expensive compared to the typical DDR type ram, etc.. I suggest http://www.newegg.com and/or google for more vendors. good luck -----Willy
