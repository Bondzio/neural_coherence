my system reported a degraded raid array and one hard drive became inaccessible.
the motherboard and hard drive were replaced, but the same problem recurred in 4 weeks.
hard drive was then replaced again, but the problem repeated immediately.
hp proposes trying the hard drive replacement again.
machine is running windows 7 64 bit, and i have made no hardware modifications.
it was purchased in january, 2011. has anyone experienced this problem?
can anything else be done to solve this problem?
