but it's got a decent enough reputation.
Symantec bought out PowerQwest who developed Drive Image and Drive Copy.
They also make Partition Magic.
They were pioneers in developing this sort of technology.
I must admit to being disappointed when Symantec bought them out as they have had a reputation for buying and dismantling their competition.
Others they took over were Central Point (PC Tools) and Quarterdeck who was big in memory management tools and held Clean Sweep for a while.
They are a predatory company.
I am sure Ghost is ok and will get better once they've integrated Drive Image technology into their product.
It will definately be better than WD utilities.
