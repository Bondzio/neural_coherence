<s> My HP laptop of 4 yrs died this last summer and at the time I was pretty sure that something on the motherboard or power supply had burned up because of the awful smell. </s>
<s> I thought I would pull the hard drive out of it and use it for a backup drive. </s>
<s> I went out to Newegg and picked up a NexStar CX external enclosure and put the hard drive in it and connected it to my desktop via a USB cable and my desktop won't even recognize it - its like its not even hooked up. </s>
<s> So then I tried hooking it up to another laptop I have and got the same results. </s>
<s> Is there anything in Windows 7 that I need to do to get it to recognize it?? </s>
<s> Or is the hard drive just dead?? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> If the enclosure is OK and it has enough power (can you use an power adaptor, a powered USB-hub or an USB Y-cable) it most likely is the disk. </s>
<s> Try with another disk to be sure? </s>

<s> Is it an old IDE drive? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Sometimes I find the drive in need of a fresh partition and format. </s>
<s> If no data recovery is an issue I just wipe it and start over. </s>
<s> Some folk forget you don't use Windows Explorer for that step. </s>

<s> Well I guess never mind - I just tried plugging it in again and this time the computer recognized it and I am now able to get in and see all the files. </s>
<s> Thanks for your responses. </s>
