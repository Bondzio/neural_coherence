1.1.1	Hi, I plan on buying a Logitech QuickCam for Notebooks Deluxe (961400-0403).	St
1.1.2	Is the integrated microphone sufficient or should I consider buying headsets too?	Ques
1.1.3	I'll be in Spain for 5 months next winter and my girlfriend will still be in Canada.	St
1.1.4	I plan on talking to her regularly through the webcam.	St
1.1.5	DO you think it would be worth it to invest maybe 40$ in headsets too?	St
1.1.6	thanks a lot Mathieu	Polite
1.2.1	Most laptop built in mics are poor at best.	Polite
1.2.2	I'd just get a ten dollar external mic, and use the laptop speakers for listening.	St
1.2.3	Then again, a proper computer nerd (self) works better with a headset on so the cord will get tangled in my pens in my pocket protector.	St
1.2.4	A headset takes up more room also when not in use.	St
