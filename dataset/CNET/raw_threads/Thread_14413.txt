I can see the other machine in Microsoft Windows Network both ways - between PC and laptop. When I try to open the machine, I have to log on. The PC is called ORANGEROOM and the laptop is LAPTOP28. My log on username for both machines is &quot;cool&quot;. When I try to log on to the laptop through the network, by typing in &quot;cool&quot; with a password, it changes to ORANGEROOM/cool but won't log on. When I try to log onto the PC from the laptop, I again have to log on and I get an error message: The username you typed in is the same as the user name you logged on with. That user name has already been tried. A domain controller cannot be found to verify that user name. I'm running XP Pro SP2 and would really appreciate some help!

I think the logon problem is to do with the way the networking has been set up. At work, the laptop connects to a domain. I asked the administrator to set the machine up to also work as a home network. Would this make a differerence?

Would this make a differerence?&quot; Absolutely, your work machine is looking for a Domain to join. What did your IT guy say?

She seems to have retained the work domain: is it not possible to have a domain and a home network? When I click My network places, I can see my school network &quot;CHschool&quot; and &quot;MSHOME&quot; - my home network.

You need XP Pro to interact with most work networks since they have a Domain login requirement. Your IT should help you with this. Also worth noting is that a VPN connection will have restrictions to what shares you can connect to. This is by design! Bob
