well, after several hours of pulling my hair out i finally got it working.
turns out that everything i had to do, i had done before, just not in the right order.
i reset my router to factory, set up my wireless security, and changed the ip of the router to match that of the modem.
i didn't make any of the other changes that were instructed in the above link (because they didn't work for me).
after disconnecting all of the pc's from the router, i turned off ics in windows (on my main pc), and bridged &quot;wireless connection&quot; to &quot;lan 1&quot;.
next i plugged &quot;lan 1&quot; into the router's &quot;ethernet 1&quot; (and left the crossover cable to the internet port disconnected).
once that connection was made and the ip updated the internet would stop working, and i'd have access to the router and network.
to fix that i disabled the network bridge, then repair the wireless connection.
after the repair i re-connected lan1 to the router, enabled the bridge and waited about a minute for the connection to be established.
the wireless connection icon in my task bar showed that there was no connection, but when i open internet explorer it was working fine (i'm using the app for the wn311t to connect to the wifi modem).
i don't fully understand how or why it worked the way it did, but i can for sure say that my wnr2000 router will not work for both networking and sharing internet when dhcp is dissabled.
hopefully my hours of frustration will save some other sap the time and hair pulling that i went through.
i now have my internet connection, full access to the network on all pc's, including the printer, and file sharing.
everything is working flawlessly now.
