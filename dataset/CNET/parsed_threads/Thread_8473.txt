<s> so I was wondering if anyone knew of any LCD monitors for a computer that has a USB port(s) actually built into the monitor. </s>
<s> I could have swore i've seen some with USB ports in them but maybe i'm just dreaming. </s>
<s> am I? </s>
<s> if the do exist does anyone know where I can find them </s>
<s> Look at the Dell 24&quot;, 27&quot; or 30&quot; wide screen LCDs for a few examples. </s>
<s> Regards, JB </s>

<s> Also NEC and Gateway </s>
<s> I have a Dell 19&quot; Ultra Sharp flat panel digital LCD. </s>
<s> It has 2usb ports. </s>
<s> Very nice. </s>
<s> I have the same monitor but for some reason, the USB ports don't work. </s>
<s> Any reason why? </s>
<s> connect a USB cable from the monitor to one of the USB ports on the tower? </s>
<s> That would be my guess. </s>
<s> Regards, JB </s>
<s> jbking2's reply appears to be correct as the link below states, &quot;As stated earlier in the review, the USB ports are connected to your PC through a patch cable that plugs into an open USB port on your PC and connects to the monitor on the back.&quot; http://techgage.com/print/dell_19quot_ultrasharp_1907fp_lcd_monitor Tufenuf </s>
<s> What does the cable look like and which slot does it go into on the monitor? </s>
<s> I have a similar monitor at work but they didn't provide me with a cable. </s>
<s> The usb is for those memory sticks that plug into the side of the monitor for cameras. </s>

<s> Hello... yes Dell made one model # 1905FP Not sure if its still made...... Howard </s>
<s> I too have a Dell Windows 7 and found a Samsung SyncMaster 205bw monitor on sale that has two USB ports. </s>
<s> Also picked up an LG Flatron for my MAC with two USB ports for my G4 Power MAC. </s>
<s> $25 at the local thrift shop works great too. </s>
<s> Yes DELL produce them. </s>
<s> i have a 24&quot; but dont know how to use it. </s>
<s> can i use it the same way as if on the HD? </s>
<s> Why do some monitors have USB connections or hubs ... do these only work like independent USB hubs, or can you also feed video to such a monitor via a USB cable. </s>
<s> I know USB couldn't feed video before, but is that happening now with 3.0 appearing? </s>
<s> Or what are the uses of these USB ports/hubs on monitors? </s>
<s> Is this only for connecting USB sticks ... and only for displaying static photos/docs from the PC? </s>
<s> I am using a Gateway FPD2185W monitor. </s>
<s> Love having USB on my desktop monitor. </s>
<s> This monitor is old but HD and nice size </s>
