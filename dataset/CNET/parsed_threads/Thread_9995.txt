<s> Hi, Just wondering about the pros & cons of the Vista upgrades that are offered by the stores if you buy a new PC right now ? </s>
<s> If you buy a Media Centre PC, it comes with a free upgrade to Vista Premium. </s>
<s> Sounds like a good deal, but I discovered that the upgrade will be in the 32bit format, not 64 bit... </s>
<s> Question is does it really matter ?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> with 32-bit versions too.lol. </s>
<s> No I don't think so. </s>
<s> having just gone thru. </s>
<s> the upgrade application, they made a point of saying the upgrade would be the 32 bit as opposed to the 64 bit version... </s>
<s> 32bit is the way to go for Vista in the new future. </s>
<s> 64bit drivers will be barebones until the hardware manufacturers catch up. </s>
<s> MS will allow you to switch to 64bit for a small fee (probably $25). </s>
<s> problems getting drivers for anything yet. </s>
<s> I'm running an ASUS A8N SLi Deluxe with an AMD4800X2+, an ATI 850XT PE and 2GBs RAM. </s>
<s> Biggest problem I've had with XP Pro 64 is compatible SW and there certainly should be more 64bit or 64bit-compatible SW coming soon. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> The big thing with the new Vista 64 bit version will be security. </s>
<s> All Drivers & App's will require a signed authenticated certificate. </s>
<s> There will be no opting out if the certificate is unknown as is the case now. </s>
<s> Read or listen all about it at the link below... http://www.grc.com/SecurityNow.htm#71 Look for the Vista security file with Leo & Steve, it's very interesting. </s>
<s> Lets put it this way; until service pack 1 comes out I would not change. </s>
<s> Little to no software is even able to run on Vista and what is out has been thrown to gather to get it out the door. </s>
<s> Remember XP when it first came out. </s>
<s> I would give it 6 months after it is out before I would even look at upgrading. </s>
<s> Yes, Vista is the newest and bigest thing in years from Microsoft, and Yes I think it is a move in the right direction. </s>
<s> If you like to be upset and things not working right, and just like pulling your hare out, go ahead. </s>
<s> Be the first on the block. </s>
<s> I garneted as a computer tech, I will. </s>
