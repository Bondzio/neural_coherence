does it still work?
yes.
sorry, i left it still on this am defragging.
it has come back on each time i tried.
so it is working as far as i left it two hrs ago.
i am extremely inexperienced.
i had installed ram before but i guess you can't win them all.
so istalling a new mb would be a bad idea for me, yes?
well, if i continue to use it until i can get someone to look at it am i causing furthur damage.
should i just leave it off?
