1.1.1	I have recently switched my old components into a new case that I purchased from Newegg.com , and I have encountered serious problems now .	St
1.1.2	First of all , when I put everything back in the new case and connected all the cables , everything else was working ( PCI , drives ... etc ) except my PS2 .	St
1.1.3	Secondly , after messing around with the motherboard for a while , my HD turned out not so good either .	St
1.1.4	I kept receiving a message of & quot ; CMOS error - Defaults loaded & quot ; then it stoped at that point .	St
1.1.5	I figure that I can get the PS2 connection back on by re-installing the motherboard 's driver , but can anyone help me recove my HD ?	Ques
1.1.6	I believe I have made all the right connections , any kind of help will be greatly appreciated .	St
1.1.7	Sincerely , Joe	St
1.2.1	maybe explain what & quot ; messing around & quot ; with the mobo means in a little detail .	St
1.2.2	How is the hard drive and the CMOS error related ?	Ques
1.2.3	What makes you say that the hard drive has problems .	St
1.2.4	Can you boot up and get into the BIOS , or does the CMOS error come up first ?	Ques
1.2.5	Might try a new CMOS battery , just to eliminate it .	St
1.2.6	No chance that the mobo got mounted such that it is shoting to the mounting plate ? ?	Ques
1.2.7	?	Ques
1.3.1	By messing around the mobo , I meant by switching around ( add/remove ) the drives the PCI cards .	St
1.3.2	And I did get the BIOS when I booted it up , it has found the CPU , the DVD+/-RW , the DVD ROM , the HD and everything else .	St
1.3.3	But after detecting the IDEs , a message showed up by saying that & quot ; No keyboard detected & quot ; then & quot ; CMOS checksum error - Defaults loaded , & quot ; and it forze up .	St
1.3.4	I thought it was HD related , apparently it 's not .	St
1.3.5	Sorry if I ca n't get everything straight , I 'm still a newb when it comes down to the hardwares .	St
1.3.6	But any more detailed help would be greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.3.7	Sincerely , Joe	St
1.4.1	And by PS/2 I meant where you can connect the keyboard and the mouse without using the USB port .	St
1.5.1	back on this thread .	St
1.5.2	I would guess that you have continued trying things .	St
1.5.3	The no keyboard MAY be that you haved a USB keyboard .	St
1.5.4	Earlier systems would not detect a USB device until the Op Sys was up .	St
1.5.5	Have you tried a new CMOS battery ? ?	Ques
1.5.6	They are only a couple of bucks .	St
1.5.7	The loss of the PS2 ports , both of them worry me because of the amount of handling the moving of the mobo caused .	St
1.5.8	But is you can use USB keyboard and mouse , no big loss .	St
1.5.9	Can you get into the BIOS or does it freeze before you can hit whatever key it takes to get in .	St
1.5.10	Of course with no keyboard you ca n't push a key .	St
1.5.11	Quite a quandry .	St
1.6.1	I do not intend to mess with that board nor the battery anymore .	St
1.6.2	I am simply going to get another mobo regarding this problem , since this mobo is around 4 yrs old anyway .	St
1.6.3	I saw one mobo that is suitable for AMD athlon XP made by PC Chips on Newegg.com .	St
1.6.4	Can anyone verify for me if that board is considerable ?	Ques
1.6.5	B/c budget is a factor , and that board only cost around 24 bucks w/o shipping .	St
1.6.6	Sincerely , Joe	St
1.7.1	NIL	St
1.8.1	in the last year .	St
1.8.2	No real problems but it is NOT an overclockers mobo which is fine for normal use .	St
1.8.3	[ for their price , one would n't expect anything but a basic mobo ] .	St
1.8.4	They all came with the CMOS jumpers on the pins that keep the CMOS disabled .	St
1.8.5	The manual is correct as far as the pin functions , just that they ship with the jumper in the wrong position .	St
1.8.6	With the jumper in the wrong position , the power supply wo n't even turn on .	St
1.9.1	Thanks for the heads up .	St
1.9.2	I have read all the reviews regarding this particular MB on Newegg.com , there were a lot of positive feedbacks but there were definitely some people just absolutely hated it .	St
1.9.3	Well , it 's too late for me to cancel the order now , since they have already shipped it out .	St
1.9.4	And Newegg is known for their restocking fees .	St
1.9.5	Anyway , I 'll keep you guys posted when I get that new MB .	St
1.9.6	Thanks for all the info by the way .	St
1.9.7	Sincerely , Joe	St
