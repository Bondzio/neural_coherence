where a post was asking about upgrading the cpu on that motherboard.
according to hp &quot;your motherboard('asus a8m2n-la') supports a maximum of athlon64 x2 up to 5000+&quot; so, that is as far as you can go using your present mobo.
but that is close to what you had asked for anyways.
i think the 5000+ runs at 2.6ghz btw: if you do not have an add-on video card, that motherboard uses the integrated geforce 6150 chipset for onboard video (uses shared memory with the system)
