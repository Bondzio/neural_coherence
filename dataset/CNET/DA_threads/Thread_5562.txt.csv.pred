1.1.1	I have two laptops ; one is a Mac and the other a PC .	St
1.1.2	My wife and I have a good collection of music together , but each of us has our own iPods and playlists .	St
1.1.3	Therefore , with my modest knowledge I thought it would be a good idea to have an external shared drive where we could store all our files and access them from either or both laptops .	St
1.1.4	The idea is to use that external hard drive wirelessly as you would use an internal one , in each of the laptops .	St
1.1.5	My question is , is this possible ?	Ques
1.1.6	If so , which one would you recommend ?	Ques
1.1.7	We are looking into buying something with 500GB .	St
1.1.8	I was especially interested in a Western Digital , but I have read so many bad reviews , and as you could probably tell by now I am not enlightened with computer knowledge I appreciate all the help !	St
1.2.1	My Linksys WRT350N has a USB-2 port .	St
1.2.2	I plug my external USB-2 & quot ; stuff & quot ; drive into it and it becomes a network drive .	St
1.2.3	It is seen by all my PCs ( 4 , one wireless laptop ) and is exactly what you 're looking for .	St
1.2.4	Drives ?	Ques
1.2.5	I 'm partial to Seagate .	St
1.2.6	I have an 80 Gig unit in the USB case , it 's perpendicular recording is fast .	St
1.2.7	I just purchased this 160 Gig http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16822148212 as I 'm running out of space on the 80 .	St
1.2.8	Seagate has many choices here http : //www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx ? Submit=ENE & N=50001305+40000014 & Manufactory=1305 & SubCategory=14 & SpeTabStoreType=0 up to a TeraByte .	St
1.3.1	a nas is basically an external hard drive that you connect to over a network .	St
1.3.2	since you want to go wireless , that will drive up the price a bit .	St
1.3.3	here 's a linksys unit without hard drive for $ 120 : http : //www.buy.com/prod/linksys-nas200-network-storage-system-with-2-bays/q/loc/101/205689222.html here 's a dlink version for $ 90 : http : //www.buy.com/prod/network-storage-adapter-usb-2-0-to-fast-ethernet/q/loc/101/10381289.html it needs an external usb drive so once you add the usb enclosure to the price it 's not really cheaper than the linksys which has 2 internal bays .	St
1.3.4	where have you read bad reviews about western digital ?	Ques
1.3.5	i recommend them almost exclusively .	Sug
1.3.6	but here 's a 500gb hitachi for $ 99 : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16822145137	Ques

1.5.5	Thanks again !	St
