<s> Hi Mac users, I have a problem and hopefully someone can put me in the right direction. </s>
<s> I've been a PC user for many many years and I've just decided to gradually cross over to Macs. </s>
<s> I bought an iBook off of ebay and I have a problem with it. </s>
<s> It's an iBook G3. </s>
<s> It had a previous owner and the person who sold it to me told me that I would have to get a new operating system. </s>
<s> The previous owner had a password set up and I cant get into anything to delete the programs and few old files. </s>
<s> I tried contacting the person who sold it to me on ebay but his account is now longer active. </s>
<s> The computer is in good working condition because I can sign on as a guest but not an administrator. </s>
<s> Could someone help me figure out how to solve this problem? </s>
<s> I would greatly appreciate it. </s>
<s> I dont know how to format the hard drive or i don't even know if i need to. </s>
<s> I really don't want to buy a new hard drive because I've heard it's extremely hard to change a mac hard drive. </s>
<s> Thanks so much. </s>
<s> See Mac Forum Thread locked P </s>
