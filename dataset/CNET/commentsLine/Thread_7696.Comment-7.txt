unlike the other people,i suggest u look at buying a computer from cyber power pc because not only is it a lot more exxpensive at other places, they have a huge variety, and you could always chat with a representative if you have any questions on their website ps.
dont buy their laptops they weight too much, and if i were you i would pay an extra 20 bucks and they will connectthe wires for you, their website is www.cyberpowerpc.com
