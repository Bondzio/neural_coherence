573	3	400244	3334233	3333713	ramarc	7/5/10 7:15 PM	1.2783573E12	fine as is but skip the liquid cooling	the 2gb 5870 might be a nice boost IF you're running at 1920x1080 (24&quot;) or higher resolution. anything lower and the 1gb version would be fine. also, don't fret over corsair-vs-adata. unless you're willing to tweak your system by hand, you won't notice the difference. as for liquid-cooling, all phenoms will work fine with air-cooling. you should only consider liquid cooling if you're trying to reach a crazy overclock and are willing to spend the time and effort to tweak-tweak-tweak!
573	4	400244	3335441	3334233	Brechan	7/8/10 1:43 AM	1.27855338E12	I agree with ramarc	in all regards (especially the liquid cooling); please note that if you are building this yourself, many manufacturers won't support liquid cooling leaks as a reason to RMA a component. If you really want liquid cooling for your rig; consider CoolIt Systems http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835227006 or the Corsair H50 http://www.corsair.com/products/h50/default.aspx
573	5	400244	3335927	3333711	ilsmangent	7/8/10 11:59 PM	1.27863354E12	No sound card?	If you're going to go all out on this machine, I would think you'd want more than an on-board card. Have you considered getting a soundcard? What's the purpose of this computer?
573	6	400244	3335953	3333711	Brechan	7/9/10 1:12 AM	1.27863792E12	is a 6 core CPU really necessary?	Or could you get by with an AMD 965BE quad core CPU? I only ask because if this rig is for gaming, there aren't too many games that will utilize a hexi-core CPU. If this is for gaming; maybe put the extra cash into an 890FX motherboard instead http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131644
573	7	400244	3336808	3335953	Tbrown37	7/10/10 9:04 AM	1.27875264E12	thanks for the help so far!	The 1gb card for sure and a-data gaming series it is. This rig is for gaming. I'm not too picky about the sound quality but I 'could' get a sound card if needed it would only be added luxury. I would get the 965BE but for the 1055t it's 26$ more to add on. Thanks for the replies everyone. :] Though with me being in the middle of a move I have to wait till I order my computer about another two months. I am going to save up some more so when the time does come I can get an Intel machine with the rest of the build identical.
