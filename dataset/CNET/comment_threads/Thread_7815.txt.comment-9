You're 99% there.
Select a SCSI ID number not in use, disable termination on the tape drive and install (all power off please.)
The hardware step would be done at that point with one minor issue in the 2940W BIOS settings.
Some tape drives couldn't run at ultra speeds but this may be a non-issue since you don't have the 2940UW.
