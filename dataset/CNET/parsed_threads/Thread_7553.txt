<s> I want to build a Media server for my home theater. </s>
<s> I'm looking at eventually needing several terra bytes of storage. </s>
<s> I'd like to start out with four 400GB drives and add more drives as they are needed. </s>
<s> Is it possible to build a RAID array and then expand it without having to backup and restore all the data? </s>
<s> For both speed and data security is RAID 5 still the best compromise? </s>
<s> The array will need to serve at least two 720 x 1280 mpeg video files at the same time. </s>
<s> I'm not sure what the transfer rate would be. </s>
<s> Would either the size of the array(about 3TB)or the transfer rate restrict me from using an IDE RAID? </s>
<s> Big Ultra-IDE drives are relatively cheap these days. </s>
<s> In my situation is there any real reason to use the more expensive SATA or SATA II drives? </s>
<s> Terry </s>
<s> It was devastating to a would be RAID builder that I pointed out his ultrafast RAID was not needed since his ethernet was all of 100 megabit. </s>
<s> Be sure you take that into account. </s>

<s> I did some estimates and it looks like DVD quality video is around 5Mb/s, 720p HD would be 20Mb/s, and 1080p HD would be 60Mb/s. </s>
<s> If this is right even with 4 TVs playing video from the server at the same time it would most likely never need to supply more than 100Mb/s. </s>
<s> I might still go to gigabit ethernet just for future proofing. </s>
<s> If someone can check those numbers for I'd appreciate it. </s>
<s> They seem low, since I get jerky video playing DVD video over a wireless connection. </s>
<s> My wireless connection usually runs about 30 Mb/s. </s>
<s> A single non-raid drive will easily keep pace with 100BT. </s>
<s> If not RAID 5, why do RAID? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I had planned on using RAID 5 for data security. </s>
<s> We are talking about terabytes of data that I don't want to have to reload from the originals. </s>
<s> If I use a string of independent drives I need to have some way to backup several 400-500GB drives. </s>
<s> Is there a cheaper more reliable solution for this than using a big RAID? </s>
<s> Terry </s>
<s> Some NAS spread it around in another way. </s>
<s> But since you have terabytes to backups, you'll want to get that quantum dlt unit. </s>
<s> RAID 5 still needs backup. </s>
<s> It's not funny when the burglar gets in a shop and they didn't have any offsite backup. </s>
<s> Or other natural disaster. </s>
<s> Those that argue against backups... usually have not suffered or suffered enough. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I can see your point about backups. </s>
<s> I will be keeping all the original media. </s>
<s> That could be considered a form of backup(with one really nasty restore path). </s>
<s> A quick search just got me a ball park price of $1100 for a Quantum DLT drive , 1.5 TB of media and a SCSI controller. </s>
<s> That's almost what I figured the first TB of RAID would cost me. </s>
<s> This is for home use so I may take my chances for a while. </s>
<s> In all likelyhood until, as you say, I have suffered enough. </s>
<s> Everyone seems to be trying to talk me out of a RAID. </s>
<s> Is there something intrinsically bad about RAID arrays? </s>
<s> My original question was what is the advantage of going to a SATA RAID as opposed to an IDE RAID. </s>
<s> Dose anyone have any input on that? </s>
<s> Terry </s>
<s> Want to call in for replacement. </s>
<s> My XP CD on my desk is the copy, the original in the firesafe. </s>
<s> You can take similar precautions. </s>
<s> That's quite a bargain for that much backup. </s>
<s> Again, those that say not may be fresh to this land. </s>
<s> I'm not trying to talk you out of RAID, I merely have watched many dive in and come away upset that no speed was gained on their network server. </s>
<s> Until you get the gigibit LAN, you can see that 100BT can't stress the hard disk system. </s>
<s> The intrinsic bad thing about RAID for some is the lack of redundency in some RAID levels and then as you go to 5 and beyond the owner then complains they don't get all 2.0TB out of the 4 or 5 500GB drives. </s>
<s> A little more research helps them find out why. </s>
<s> In RAID 0 the owners get upset that you lose everything when you have a single drive failure. </s>
<s> And the final killer is I've seen people change controllers and ... the RAID contents are gone. </s>
