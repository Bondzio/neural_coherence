the 430w and it's ok. stable, cool and reasonably quiet.
corsair tx are better but out of your price limit unless they go on sale.
a good compromise on price/performance is this  .
stable, cool, quiet, efficient and modular!
but dual rail.
frequently goes on sale at newegg, et al.
with rebate, the 500w can be had for $35.
