what you could do is to head to tomshardware.com, find the cheapest card on your list and see the test results.
you set a specification of 40 fps and the reviews often show that in games during the test.
seems all you need to do is finish your research.
and about power.
be sure to see if any mention of the power requirement in watts or amperes is noted.
a sad thing i encounter a lot is the new upgrader (the person) buys a card but the machine's power supply is too small.
