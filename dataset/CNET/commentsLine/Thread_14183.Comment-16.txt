i recall paying $4200 canadian for it including free delivery and setup in december 1983. plus another grand for a dot matrix printer that never worked.
but that computer was built like a tank and wordperfect 3.0 worked just fine on that green monochrome monitor.
and it never broke!
if only i'd waited a month i would have been first in line for the first mac.
i suffered through several windows incarnations on a perpetually upgraded pentium pc until dumping everything for mac's in 2002 and i feel i've gotten my original non-breaking pc productivity back.
