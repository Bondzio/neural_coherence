the m7690n has a faster cpu (e6400 2.13ghz vs e6300 1.86 ghz), 1gb more ram, 500gb hard drive (vs. 250gb), hd dvd drive (m7659 does not), and geforce 7600gt graphics (vs. 7500le).
so, the m7690n is certainly worth a $300 price premium.
neither will display hd tv channels because neither has an hd tuner card.
you could add a hd tuner but you'd have to either dump the modem card (no free pci slots) or go with an external usb tuner (my suggestion is the hauppauge wintv-hvr-950 for $110).
the m7690n comes with the necessary software to play hd dvds (hp dvd play hd-dvd 2.2).
as for an hdcp capable monitor, the acer al2216wbd is a 22&quot; widescreen for about $320; the sceptre x20wc is a 20&quot; widescreen and is about $220.
