<s> Hi all, Here is the senario, Planing to share a 1MB ADSL line with 4 neighbours at least 100mts apart from each others VIA wireless. </s>
<s> I was designing the network with a Linksys WAG200G ADSL Router and 3 Linksys Access-Points. </s>
<s> Would the above idea be a good choice for the routers and the access-points. </s>
<s> Are there better routers with excellent distance of coverage. </s>
<s> For a 1MB ADSL line will the Linksys WAG200G Router be enough? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> You may find that signal strength is poor at that range. </s>
<s> These are not very strong signal transmitters, and distance, walls, and other dvices on the 2.4GHz waveband can interfere with the reception. </s>
<s> A better solution would be wire to the other houses. </s>
