In the dining room at the other end of house on main floor only get 1/5 bars and on the back or front deck 0/5..the house is not an open floor plan on the main level so signal will still have to travel thru some walls to reach outside or other rooms on main level

It's basic networking so I'll give the search about the router as a WAP and stop there. Why? Because I've found extenders to be so hit and miss that I no longer use them. -&gt; https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&as_q=how+use+a+router+as+access+point Recipe? Your SBG6580 -&gt; Powerline Bridge -&gt; other Powerline Bridge in a central location for the router as a WAP. Bob
