Whew!
You did not list the Athlon 64 X2 as &quot;yesterday&quot;.
Computers are always gaining in development.
Even tho that some systems are &quot;yesterday&quot;, they will still work as great for the next several years.
This computer I've been considering is an Athlon 64 X2.

What you think?
I compared it with a Gaming computer and found that the Gaming computer I was looking at cost more, because of fancy case design.
