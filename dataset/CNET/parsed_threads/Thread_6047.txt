<s> Folks, I've searched the forums, but can't find any simple directions for my question. </s>
<s> I have an 'old' 19&quot; Dell E193FP LCD Monitor I found in the garage and am wanting to use it to watch tv in my bedroom. </s>
<s> Please keep in mind that I am TOTALLY techno ignorant, so instead of the old clunker I have now. </s>
<s> When I read things about &quot;cards&quot;, &quot;imputs&quot;, connections, etc., I am lost! </s>
<s> I have Direct TV Satellite right now in the bedroom and the tech hooked it up through an old CD/DVD player sitting on the floor. </s>
<s> I have the little satellite box on top of the tv right now. </s>
<s> When I want to watch tv, I just point the remote at the satellite box, click, and it turns on. </s>
<s> I don't think I have any 'speakers' per say to go with the computer monitor. </s>
<s> The speakers are now on the 'newer' monitor on my computer. </s>
<s> Is there a SIMPLE way to connect this all up or do I have to have tech savvy? </s>
<s> Do I need to buy a lot of things? </s>
<s> I am debating whether to try it or just give the monitor to my son. </s>
<s> Thanks So Much! </s>
<s> What type of input does the 19&quot; monitor have? </s>
<s> Unless it will match the output of your satellite box, you're done. </s>
<s> Yep Corey, I am a moron. </s>
<s> Ok, only 1/2 joking. </s>
<s> I think I know what an &quot;input&quot; does, but what am I looking for? </s>
<s> Is is some kind of hole on the back of the monitor? </s>
<s> What would it say, ie. </s>
<s> a number or letters of some kind? </s>
<s> Or is it something the original 'disk' or booklet that came with the monitor would have written down in it? </s>
<s> Thanks for the help, you're the only one. </s>
<s> is what drives the picture. </s>
<s> There will be a plug (not the power plug) that you plug a source cable into. </s>
<s> Like on the back of a TV you have connections. </s>
<s> What type is on the monitor? </s>
<s> Describe it. </s>
<s> Golly gosh, I thank you sooo much for your interest and help. </s>
<s> I just this MINUTE walked in my front door from being out of town for 5 days. </s>
<s> (In Dallas-now back to New Orleans). </s>
<s> Will unpack all the dirty laundry tonight, wash, be too tired and finally get a flashlight and look at the back of the monitor tomorrow...lol. </s>
<s> Will let you know about the back asap. </s>
<s> Thank You and Good Karma Be With You!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
