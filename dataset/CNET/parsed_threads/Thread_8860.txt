<s> My Mom is a 90 year old artist and writer and needs a new desktop. </s>
<s> She has a monitor, scanner, external storage and printer but needs a new desktop that can help her write and publish her poems and her art books. </s>
<s> She uses Microsoft WORD, Microsoft Publisher, BlurbSmart, Picasa and, of course, uses a browser for searching and reading the news. </s>
<s> What computer and configuration of CPU, RAM graphics card, disk drive do you recommend? </s>
<s> She would like to keep the cost down around $500 but preferably below that, if she can get one that handles all the above. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> And you can use most if not all of what you have. </s>
<s> What was the old desktop? </s>

<s> She has now a Dell Dimension 4550 Pentium 4 1 GB RAM Maybe 70 GB Hard Drive. </s>
<s> No graphics card. </s>
<s> Has very little space in her small one room apartment in Assisted Living. </s>
<s> If the old PC provided what she needed, then another newer Dell will do. </s>
<s> Right now, sales and deals are being offered more so than any other time of the yr. Visit the Dell online website and view what's avaialble. </s>
<s> Even an entry level desktop system is better than the old PC. </s>
<s> As for space saving the newer Vestro's should do OK, IMHO. </s>
<s> However, I do suggest you look at the OptiPlex models because these being business models tend to be more robust and *may* offer better support and look into order from the small business side if possible. </s>
<s> Of course other OEM vendors like Gateway, HP, etc., are selling online too, so it would be good to look them over. </s>
<s> Whatever you order if from some OEM vendor, get what you need then, as the warranty will cover all. </s>
<s> If eyesight asnd tactical feel for older living is needed, maybe that assisted living outfit can offer clues to what works for its residents or similar organizations(online) could provide. </s>
<s> I take my cue from say, the hearing impaired, what they offer to those in need. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> All your comments were appreciated. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Will probably go with a Dell 580 with an i3-550 4GB RAM and 750 GB hard drive or a similar Acer with Athlon II x4 640 at Amazon - with 4GB RAM and 1T of hard drive - both under $550. </s>
<s> A nod to the i3 model. </s>
<s> I have too many machines to compare and Intel is doing fine here. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> If you keep your eye on the sales and go with a local merchant. </s>
<s> You buy the machine....if it does not work....you bring it back....done. </s>
<s> You buy the machine....mom does not like it...you bring it back....done. </s>
<s> If you go mail order and there is a problem it could be a hernia. </s>
<s> I would think that just about any 500 buck machine from wally-mart or the like will do what mom needs. </s>
<s> Found an HP Pavilion p6620f Desktop Computer With AMD Phenom? </s>
<s> II 820 Quad-Core Processor 6 GB RAM and 1 TB hard drive for $530 plus tax. </s>
<s> Do you think this will do the job? </s>
<s> But I still give the nod to the i3. </s>
<s> The unit you noted is one I can't give a nod to. </s>
<s> It seems overkill. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> What's the problem with the old machine? </s>
<s> Too slow? </s>
<s> Hd full? </s>
<s> Just want a new machine? </s>
<s> It also freezes up as best as I can tell. </s>
<s> She is 400 miles away so I hear only via email. </s>
<s> Dell has 2 very similar desktops at very good prices. </s>
<s> Inspiron 560 with Pentium E5700 3GB RAM and 640 GB Disc for $370 AND Inspiron 580 with Intel i3-550 with 4 GB RAM and 750 GB disc for $500. </s>
<s> Suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> This is one of intel's best for the price and once you try that or the i5 you'll come back for more. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thank you all for your comments and advice. </s>
<s> My Mom will appreciate the new PC. </s>
