read &quot;new problems&quot; first so it doesnt have everything to do with the ipod, b/c it just shut down again a few mins ago when i was just doin email.
and unlike i said before, i dont have to wait any time to reboot.
(it always follows this pattern:) 1.randomly shuts down after a while 2.i reboot.
3. i do a hard shut down by holding power for 8 secs.
4. i reboot and it starts up with ease.
