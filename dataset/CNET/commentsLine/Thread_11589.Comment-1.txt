hi i have 2 monitors, 1st one shut down mos ago, did'nt know why, the plug that goes into the video card the 1 of the pins looks broken, bigger the other pins, is this monitor shot, or can i go inside and replace that cord.
the other monitor it started with the screen going half the size, now all i get is a line on the top, i can see just a little, i worked on the controls for days, and it won't come back to normal is this one shot also i hope not i hope you can give me good news, but otherwise lol, i'll take the bad as well thanks
