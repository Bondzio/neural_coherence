<s> I bought a 320GB Western Digital Scorpio Blue hard drive (WD3200BEVE) for a laptop that died. </s>
<s> Since then I have gotten rid of the laptop but wanted to use the hard drive externally for my PC for storage. </s>
<s> I bought a Gigaware 2.5&quot; IDE Hard Drive Enclosure. </s>
<s> I set it up and the enclosure light turns blue. </s>
<s> The PC searched for the drivers for quite a while and failed. </s>
<s> From what I see on the WD website they don't offer drivers for external use of the hard drive. </s>
<s> Any help is appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> No drivers is correct. </s>
<s> But I find some forget to partition and format these blank drives. </s>
<s> Did you prepare the drive? </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> I did not prepare it as you mentioned. </s>
<s> How do I partition and format the blank drive? </s>
<s> When I plug it in, the PC makes the sound that it recognizes something was plugged in, but no drive appears in the Computer folder. </s>
<s> Thanks again any help is appreciated. </s>
<s> FYI I have a Dell that uses Windows Vista. </s>
<s> Click the orb, type DISK MANAGEMENT and you should find it. </s>
