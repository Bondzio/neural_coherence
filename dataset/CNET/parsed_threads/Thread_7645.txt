<s> Hi, I'm having constant lag spikes. </s>
<s> I use DPC Latency checker http://www.thesycon.de/deu/latency_check.shtml On both my desktop (using PCI wifi card) and my laptop I have lag spikes. </s>
<s> This is a screenshot of the spikes http://i.imgur.com/cyoLq.png . </s>
<s> Although it says its my hardware problems, I doubt its true, as it happens on both devices. </s>
<s> As a gamer this is truly irritating. </s>
<s> Do you have any idea how to fix this problem? </s>
<s> Maybe it's the router. </s>
<s> Maybe it's interference with a nearby router (your neighbours) operating on the same or an adjacent channel. </s>
<s> Maybe it's a hacker using your unprotected wireless router. </s>
<s> Maybe it's some background program that took a millisecond of the CPU or Windows doing its housekeeping. </s>
<s> For gaming it's adviced to use a wired connection. </s>
<s> With a desktop that's usually easy to do, since it stays on the same position so it's a one-time operation to have a cable there. </s>
<s> The same, of course, if you use your laptop usually at the same place (and not so often at other locations, when at home). </s>
<s> It's worth an experiment at least, because it eliminates all wireless issues (hackers, interference, the wireless logic of the router). </s>
<s> Changing the channel you use, of course, is a very easy test. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> WiFi is in the wide open so a neighbor, another PC or a microwave oven can interfere. </s>
<s> Gamers learn quickly that WiFi is not the connection of choice. </s>
<s> Eventually they move back to the wired connection and even turn off the WiFi in the router. </s>

<s> Absolutely, that isn't uncommon and as you said, if you are gaming, wireless is NOT the way to go, too many variables, can bounce around like a yo yo. </s>
