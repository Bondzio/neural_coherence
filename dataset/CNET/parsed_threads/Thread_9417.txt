<s> If the video port does not workon the motherboard, would a video card work for the monitor? </s>
<s> The motherboard is new, It was givin to me so can't take back </s>
<s> Can you check first to see if it's been disabled in the BIOS? </s>
<s> This is how you would use an alternative board. </s>
<s> If the video chipset has become defective and no other problems are noted, you should still attempt to disable the function in the BIOS. </s>
<s> Then, you will be limited to what's available in the way of PCI video cards. </s>
<s> If this is an old board, you might be able to pick up a used video card to save a bit. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
