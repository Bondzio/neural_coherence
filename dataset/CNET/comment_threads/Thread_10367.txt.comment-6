but using a period in the title is also an annoyance.
So, you're looking for someone experienced but you didn't say in what way.
Do you need to find someone with that motherboard who has tried both models of that RAM to make a recommendation?
You'll wait a very long time then and, if that's true, my experience won't.
My only experience is that I have an Asus P755D series board and I did use the qualified vendor listing to help me select my compatible RAM and what I bought has worked wonderfully well.
That's the best I can offer.
Good luck finding an acceptable response.
