1.2.1	Windows Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) will do it.	St
1.2.2	Just run the Windows Network Setup wizard.	St
1.2.3	HOWEVER...	St
1.2.4	I highly recommend purchasing a broadband router.	Sug
1.2.5	It adds an extra layer of security (firewall, filtering, etc.)	St
1.2.6	between your computers and the DSL modem.	St
1.2.7	Also, a router will allow your laptop to use the DSL Internet connection without having to turn on your desktop, as ICS requires.	St
1.2.8	I recommend purchasing a wireless-G broadband router.	Sug
1.2.9	Most allow you to make 4 wired connections and multiple wireless connections at the same time.	St
