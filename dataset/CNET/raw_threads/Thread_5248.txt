Reading and looking at http://www.amazon.com/FSP460-60GLC-Bestec-ATX-250-12Z-Supply-Replacement/dp/B001AO0MT4 tells me that this is a common ATX power supply. That is, there are some thousand models that can replace this. Here's one for the herd. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817153023 Bob

Once you have that in hand, you compare to any similar or direct replacement PSU. So be 100% sure the model# is what is stated on the decal/sticker located on the PSU. Then do your search. If as Robert states is correct, you maybe lucky and have a common ATX-12V type sized PSU, which many are generic to your needs. BTW, having more wattage and/or connections won't hurt. http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=Bestec+ATX-250-12Z#q=Bestec+ATX-250-12Z&hl=en&prmd=imvnsfd&source=univ&tbm=shop&tbo=u&sa=X&ei=_qRvT4DHAefW0QGP8IzPCA&ved=0CIgBEK0E&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&fp=dcfb21c058468efb&biw=1309&bih=676 tada -----Willy

It's got an inexpensive PSU in it now and this one at $45 net will be worthwhile to have as a spare or a substitute if I decide to upgrade the system. VAPCMD
