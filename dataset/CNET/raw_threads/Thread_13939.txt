Its Properties say &quot;Windows cannot start this hardware because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged (Code 19).&quot; Troubleshooter instructs me to uninstall the device, after which Windows searches for Plug and Play devices. It then says, &quot;This Troubleshooter is unable to solve your problem.&quot; Attempting to update the driver using the Hardware Update Wizard results in the following message: &quot;The Wizard cannot find a better match for your hardware than the software you currently have installed.&quot;

Logitech issued a how to remove it but today we see malware and registry cleaners create this problem. Try the easy fix first. Boot SAFE MODE, head to device manager and remove the device there. On reboot we hope it will straighten it out. Bob

Don't install mouse and keyboard drivers. Read http://forums.logitech.com/t5/Mice-and-Trackballs/Optical-mouse-driver-Win-Vista/m-p/239914/highlight/true?nobounce= Today MALWARE can cause this.

As I understand it, that was about a Logitech optical mouse that was installed and conflicts that occurred with something called SetPoint in a Vista environment. My mouse was manufactured by Microsoft; underneath it says, &quot;Intellimouse Serial and PS/2 Compatible&quot;. Any drivers that are installed on my system are Windows XP's native drivers. I downloaded the malware scanners recommended on the other page to which you referred me, and scanned my system. A few suspect items were detected and deleted or quarantined, but it hasn't solved my mouse problem.

I do not believe there is anything wrong with the mouse I am using or that my actual hardware is the source of this problem. As the message in Device Manager says, &quot;Windows cannot start this hardware because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged (Code 19).&quot; This indicates to me that the problem is with corrupt or incorrect data on my computer. As for hiring a hardware specialist, I think that would cost me more than my computer is worth.
10007	9	404675	3352569	3352407	R. Proffitt	8/6/10 5:15 AM	1.2810717E12	You're right. It is not the Logitech issue but one like it.	The CODE 19 is the clue here. This code has been seen on other mice when the driver messed up. Sadly some will want an exact fit when I supply a link. This may be possible but since this is all volunteer I limit my searches to close enough examples. -&gt; What I try next is to unplug all the mice and boot SAFE MODE. Try it with just one mouse and in SAFE MODE head to the device manager and uninstall all mice found. On the next boot Windows will redetect compatible mice and hopefully cures it. The logitech code 19 often resulted in reloading the OS. And beyond the setpoint the mouse filter drivers were causing CODE 19 and other issues. That history is well, history. I learned to avoid installing such but let's think about today's malware. A keyboard+mouse logger could create this problem. It's why we can't discount malware. Bob
