<s> I have a 500GB Maxtor Hard Drive. </s>
<s> I put all my pics on there shot in Raw format and it still shows that 396 GB is being used. </s>
<s> However It wont allow me access to anything?? </s>
<s> So I created another folder that I know is on my HD and it said already exist? </s>
<s> So I know it is there but wont allow me to see it?? </s>
<s> HELP!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> So are you saying that you have a 500G drive with 396G being used. </s>
<s> And you can't move any files from and to this hard drive? </s>
<s> Have you checked to see if your hard drive has a write protection switch? </s>
<s> Some external drives have them and with it on, nothing can be written to the hard drive. </s>
<s> And that bit about folder creation? </s>
<s> I couldn't even begin to fathom what you are talking about. </s>
