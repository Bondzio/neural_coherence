My question is, do I have to get a make and model specific power supply, or can I buy a generic one in the store and put it into my computer? I have a hp pavilion a520n 3200+ 512 mb pc2700 ddr sdram 160gb 7200RPM UDMA HD DVD+RW/CD-RW CD-ROM 48x

The p/s unit itself is ATX12V class but it is physically different from typical generic p/s. You can check this website for truly hi-quality unit and one that can fit: http://www.pcpowerandcooling.com and yes they're expensive but worth it. Of course, google for any HP ready p/s units or check HP parts surfer website for a better replacement beyond 250W, I believe 320W can be found or better. tada -----Willy

4223	4	97750	1138513	1137608	Willy	4/19/05 7:12 PM	1.11393792E12	Size matters	I checked HP replacement parts and that's the only one for that model. The chancy part is using another model's part# that better wattage to fit, but you're on your own. I checked in http://www.sparklepower.com that shows various p/s uits, I correct myself as yours is a ATX-SFX which means a fan blowing across the cpu or air channel to direct air directly on the cpu, besides any cpu fan itself. Thewy try to better the system. The important thing is the measurements they give for the p/s unit. using that find a replacement which maybe an ATX type w/o a fan, but many are dual fan models, its the size that hurts, it bigger that the HP model, but I didn't do alot of checking. Of course if you &quot;jerry-rig&quot; it, that an option. tada -----Willy
