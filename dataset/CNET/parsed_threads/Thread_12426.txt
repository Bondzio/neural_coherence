<s> As my system was not booting, I re-installed my xp version 2002 SP3 on the same drive in the folder winxp. </s>
<s> After installation I moved all documents (all are encrypted) present in older user to present desktop. </s>
<s> It had few folders, office 2003 files & many office 2007 files. </s>
<s> After installation of all the drivers, I installed Tune Up utilities. </s>
<s> In that I got a message to disable data access on network and disabled it. </s>
<s> From then I m unable to open any of the files on my desktop or copy them to other location. </s>
<s> But still I can open/copy all other files except my desktop. </s>
<s> Those files are very important for me. </s>
<s> How to get back my files? </s>
<s> Please help me. </s>
<s> The good news is that this has been discussed before. </s>
<s> The bad news is that you didn't reveal if you backed up your EFS credentials. </s>
<s> And more good news. </s>
<s> If you didn't then http://www.lostpassword.com has a tool to let you regain access to those files. </s>
<s> This is often where folk stop using EFS. </s>
