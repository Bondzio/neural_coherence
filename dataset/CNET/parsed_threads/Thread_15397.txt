<s> I want to archive an image of a DVD that I made. </s>
<s> I know that when I write to the DVD recorder, the DVD will be written as -R or +R depending upon the media in the drive. </s>
<s> In the future, I want to use a DVD Iso image to write to DVD's. </s>
<s> Is the Iso image of a DVD different if it was made from a -R or +R DVD? </s>
<s> Can I just make an image from a -R DVD and then later write it back to a +R DVD? </s>
<s> I'll write no and share it's never been an issue. </s>
<s> I even put such on RW (both types). </s>

<s> As far as the .iso image is concerned they are the same, the media itself however is different. </s>
<s> It depends on what sort of .iso file you have and what you're going to do with it. </s>
<s> As a back up for a movie which you want to use in any stand alone player, the image must be burned to a +R disc (of course, the .iso file is one single file and won't be recognized as a movie, or music and so must be burned differently), many players will only read the +R and won't recognize the -R format. </s>
<s> If you intend to use the image of an Operating System -R is fine as long as your burners recognize the -R format. </s>
<s> The DVD+R/+RW format offers subtle extra functionality for people who record their own movies and audio. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Instantly eject without having to wait for finalized formatting. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Ability to record one DVD disc partially on PC and partially on television. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Background formatting: while the disc is being formatted, you can simultaneously record on already-formatted portions of the same disc. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Enhanced ability to edit filenames, movie and song titles, and playlists. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> 100% compatibility with all other DVD players, while still enjoying these extra recording features. </s>
<s> Something else to consider is quality of the media. </s>
<s> Many manufacturers produce a &quot;value line&quot; of both formats - these are sketchy at best for archival uses. </s>
<s> Bottom line.... you get what you pay for. </s>
