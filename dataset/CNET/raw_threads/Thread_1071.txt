I am thinking of incorporating gigabit into my network, perhaps adding another 16 port 10/100/1000 switch. I have read reviews of a few switches out there that when a single 100 Mb computer is hooked to them, ALL of the ports on the switch run at 100Mb regardless of whether other computers can run at gigabit. Do all gigabit switches work this way?

In a SWITCHED HUB (or switch) any port can be at any speed but because of the switch's store an forward feature the speed goes up or down as needed to and from each PC. Since no packets are sent to machines who don't need them the overall speed jump from DUMB HUBS to Switched Hubs can be amazing. This is not an effort on my part to teach networking but to clarify this one small item. Bob
