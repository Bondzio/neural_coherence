<s> Ok, so I had a 2.4ghz cordless phone in my kitchen and then I went wireless and installed a DI-614+ router in my living room. </s>
<s> The problem that I'm having is simple. </s>
<s> When using the cordless phone, I notice a pulsing sound in the background, which I'm sure is the routers signal. </s>
<s> That I can deal with. </s>
<s> The real concern here is that sometimes when the phone rings, I'll go to answer it and it won't pick up. </s>
<s> Is a 2.4ghz router supposed to work alongside a 2.4ghz phone (except for the pulsating noise)? </s>
<s> Should I consider paying more for a 5.8ghz phone or can I just get another 2.4 phone that isn't a piece of junk? </s>
<s> Not only your 2.4ghz phone but your microwave oven and any other toys operating in that range will cause interference. </s>
<s> Try relocating the router for one. </s>
<s> If there is no improvement I would consider changing to a 802.11a/g(5ghz/2.4ghz range) router or change the frequency of the phone. </s>
<s> I decided to go out and buy a new 5.8ghz phone. </s>
<s> My router is rock solid and I have no problems with my internet connection </s>
<s> Dont even think about buying a new phone, your router most have a multi-channel selection on the 2.4Ghz Wavelength, try alternating between spectrum channels until you find the perfect one, example: My Cordless phone use 2.4GHz and my Wi-Fi Broadband router is set it up on 2.47 GHz </s>
<s> How exactly do you do that? </s>
<s> Change the frequency of the router? </s>
<s> Enter your router's Configuration Menu (Administration page). </s>
<s> Go to the Wireless settings section. </s>
<s> Change the broadcast Channel (frequency) to another one in the list. </s>
