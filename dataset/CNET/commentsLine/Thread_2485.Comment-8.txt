if you regress from win8, you must be assured that any &quot;secure boot&quot; process has been disabled.
newer pcs, no matter what are becoming locked-in due to bios/eufi issue which in turn can use the secure boot mode.
it may become an issue if you can't boot from anything other than the original hd, etc.
booting from other devices are defeated thus secured from malware attacks, even though not being done.
overall, you need to verify the secure boot is disabled.
win8 is becoming a pita to change from.
not only that but also all the other issues of drivers can they be found for lesser oses?
google for secure boot to find examples of the problem.
this may not apply, but worth looking into.
when, i visited acer, there wasn't much to garner from.
overall, it lacked much, imo.
your best bet is to win7 as the os, rather than xp.
i don't see much support for xp in any form.
plus, as i already stated there may not be xp based drivers.
