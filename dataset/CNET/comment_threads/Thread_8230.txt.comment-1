Asus A8V Deluxe mb Latest BIOS Am getting a 30 second delay black screen from time IDE check screen exits until xp starts.
I reset the BIOS by pulling power plug, removing battery and resetting jumpers as per book.
Still getting same delay.
Machine runs fine after booting.
BTW, there is no such delay if I boot from cd.
Any ideas as to where I should begin?
