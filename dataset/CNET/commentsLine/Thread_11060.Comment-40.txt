the only thing i lost moving to windows 7 was my scsi installation- an adaptec 2960 card plus three peripherals-an hp tape drive hp stopped supporting many years ago, and two hard drives.
adaptec stopped supporting all scsi cards without explanation-typical company behavior-the hell with people who have their equipment.
they are now all sata raid all the time now.
a canny business decision that damns the customer as usual.
windows 7 works okay but like all windows os's it eats fabulous amounts of memory and cpu during normal operation.
if i try to do things like move down a page while windows 'draws' icons on the desktop or something similar-it's blue screen of death time.
not the first windows version with this problem.
