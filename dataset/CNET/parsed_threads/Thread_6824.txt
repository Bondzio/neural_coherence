<s> Issue: Samsung IDE HDD 250GB Is spinning but the needle keeps going to the middle and back, over and over again ( i took it apart to see what could be wrong), But it's not mounting on any PC. </s>
<s> I used a Double USB &gt; Micro USB cable. </s>
<s> so it does have sufficient power. </s>
<s> (the HDD is normally in a casing, which dropped yesterday and is probably causing the issue) Does anyone have ay idea if i can make it work again, and what is causing the issue If anyone is interested, i can upload a movie of the spinning HDD tonight so people can see what i mean. </s>
<s> Ty in Advance, </s>
<s> Too many and none of them apply to home repair. </s>
<s> This is one you send to: http://www.drivesavers.com This is not to sound cruel but the issue is well known, you could research it but if you ask that means you can't recover this hard drive. </s>
<s> Sorry I can't blunt this any further. </s>
<s> If you had the tools and skills you wouldn't be asking. </s>

<s> After investigating the Hdd i took apart, it seems the HDD Reading pins , or whatever they are called, are slightly bent. </s>
<s> i'm going to try and get myself a old similar hdd and put the Hard disk in that one to see if it can still read my data. </s>
<s> And you're right if i had the tools and the skills (got skills but not much on Hardware) i wouldn't be asking. </s>
<s> but that's what forums are for, right! </s>
<s> Be sure you pay little or nothing as that no longer works in modern drives. </s>
<s> The reasons are out there on the net. </s>
<s> Forums are for asking such questions. </s>
<s> If someone asks one that shows they are not ready or didn't do the research then you might get a reply like mine. </s>
<s> I try to blunt the force or impact but sometimes I fail. </s>
<s> If you want your data back I strongly suggest you let drivesavers.com do the work. </s>
