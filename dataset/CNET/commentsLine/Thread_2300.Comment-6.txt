i know this is not the main point of this chain, but since the printer cable was at least brought up earlier i thought i would through my 2 cents in.
yes - you do need a printer cable if you get the dell printer.
i think you may need it for about any printer (they just don't come with them for some reason)but instead of the $25 from dell/bst buy/circuit city - try ebay.
i got a 10 ft one for $2.99 i found for little stuff like cords and cables ebay has great prices.
another example i got a 10 ft ethernet cord for like $5.99 ($30+ in normal stores) again, minor point but still something i thought i would mention
