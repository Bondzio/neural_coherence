wifi mesh using linksys wrt150n 802.11n mimo router im trying to setup a mesh network in an mdu so im shopping for solutions and one idea was to use the linksys wrt150n 802.11n mimo router and flash it using sveasoft firmware.
im being told that if these are connected in a mesh and wireless g is in range these routers will switch to wireless g instead of wireless n anyone know if this is true?
any comments on this are very much appreciated thanks for your time!
