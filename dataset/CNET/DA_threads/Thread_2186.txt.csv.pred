1.1.2	Any suggestions would be appreciated .	Polite
1.1.3	Thanks a lot	St

1.4.1	It will depend somewhat on what type of equipment you have what level of protection is available .	St
1.4.2	But the first step is to setup encryption .	St
1.4.3	Most will support WEP or WPA , with WPA being the stronger .	St
1.4.4	I would also disable the broadcasting of your SSID , and if you are so inclined , you can go as far as implementing a MAC filter if your equipment supports it .	St
1.4.5	Other advanced features will depend on your equipment .	St
1.4.6	I would also make sure you have changed the default password for your router to something stronger , as the default passwords are published all over the internet .	St
1.5.1	Probably the single most important thing you can do to make your WLAN resonably secure ( there is no such thing as bullet proof ) is to use WPA2 if yuor equpitment supports it , and to use a sufficiently complex and random Preshared key ( PSK ) .	St
1.5.2	WPA2 & WPA support the use of a maximum of a 63 character ASCII character PSK or a 64 character hexadecimal .	St
1.5.3	If your equiptment supports the 64 hex , use that .	St
1.5.4	If it does n't , then use a full 63 character ASCII string as your PSK .	St
1.5.5	If you do n't have your own means to randomly generate these values go to www.grc.com and use their & quot ; Perfect password generator & quot ; .	St
1.5.6	While this may seem complex , it is nonetheless important .	St
1.5.7	If you use something like : peanut Then you are going to get hacked .	St
1.5.8	Use something like : 9F53CD8A5F1C5393AF6A5EFFA4B2299E4C8A5A4318743184D0498EC470BD2465 or ; u , PPs $ `Y\Hj\ ; KXdby+++6i0R ? i6K\ & lt ; & gt ; 0rx } # Q~HVa X_~*_ } z.l @ U % IS % o ? Cp And you 'll be in pretty good shape .	St
1.5.9	I also change my PSK on a regular basis .	St
1.5.10	Hope this helps	St
