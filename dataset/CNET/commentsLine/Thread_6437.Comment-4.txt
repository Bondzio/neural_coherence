the goal is to use the monitor without pc for video, and small pc speakers for sound.
i wasn't looking for that when i bought it.
since i am using a cable box, i really don't need a tuner.
i haven't reached the point of wanting tv on the pc, but that may change.
the spare pc i have is noisy (fans, hard drives) and not suited for a bedroom tv.
replacing it would be silly as a pc is overkill for only watching tv.
