Is your original memory a pair?
Thus running Dual Channel?
If only a single, pull it out and with the new pair running at the max the mobo will support, may give you substantially more memory bandwidth and result in noticeably better performance, depending on what type programs you run.
The new memory's latency looks fairly good for DDR2.
Maybe somewhat better than the older memory.
We're only talking maybe totally 15% gains.
