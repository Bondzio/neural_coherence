<s> eMachines T3092 Athlon 3000+ 2.17Ghz 2G RAM, Windows XP Just had put in e-GeForce 7600 GS AGP graphics card, says on the box it requires 400W PSU. </s>
<s> So upgraded my 300W to a 450W. </s>
<s> Was getting error message on boot saying that not enough power was going to the graphics card so it was lowering performance so as not to damage hardware. </s>
<s> So I got a 600W PSU put in there, and still the same thing is happening. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> And what do I try next? </s>
<s> an additional/required power lead to the video card or to a special location on the mobo for that purpose??? </s>
<s> I got that message on a system a few weeks ago. </s>
<s> In one there was a place near the bottom of the mobo to connect a 4 pin molex to. </s>
<s> Thanks, finally had a chance to get the case opened, and it was the extra power connection that was unhooked. </s>
<s> All's well now. </s>
