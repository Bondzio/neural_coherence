i'm a newbie to wireless networking and am looking for some setup and equipment advice.
i currently have a desktop pc, with a wired cable internet connection.
i also have a mac laptop, equipped with a wireless airport card.
is there a wireless router i could purchase that would let me keep the wired connection with my pc (since it is not equipped with a wireless card) but allow my laptop to access the internet connection wirelessly?
would the router be compatable with my current isp?
if so, any recommendation on specific brands/models?
i just need the basics, so something relatively inexpensive would be ideal.
thanks in advance, adam
