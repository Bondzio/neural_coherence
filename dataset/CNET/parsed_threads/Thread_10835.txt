<s> Hello all, I am running windows 2000 pro and I recently moved a computer after getting it all set for a new user.It was fine and connecting to the network and internet until I put it in the new office.Now it wont connect at all and when I check the networking it is not receiving packet.Any help steering me in the right direction would be great. </s>
<s> And does it still work in the old office? </s>

<s> sorry about that,All I did was move the computer from one room to another,that room had a working connection,I was just replacing the computer.I had it all setup and working,then when I moved it I was unable to hookup.My networking card is also blinking like crazy witch I understand as its not getting an IP address from the router. </s>

<s> And you don't answer the critical question: does it still work at the old location? </s>
<s> I agree with Bob: call the IT-staff/helpdesk and let them solve it. </s>
<s> That's their work. </s>

<s> It was setup and running and now will not connect.I was thinking maybe I would be given some things to try and get it going again, or at least for someone to steer me in the right direction. </s>
<s> and have it repaired or replaced. </s>
<s> Probably the stress of moving was too much. </s>
<s> Can happen. </s>

<s> Try the new winsock reset at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/811259 But this sounds more like a dead office connection. </s>
<s> Have them show you it working with their laptop. </s>
