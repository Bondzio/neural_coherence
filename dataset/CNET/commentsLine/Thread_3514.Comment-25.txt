according to the specifications of the upgraded bios on your current mobo, you should be able to upgrade to this slot1 piii 600mhz processor; however i give no guarantees.
for the price, it may be worth the tinkering.
problem is that you will still be limited with the 600mhz piii.
a lot of today's hardware and software needs a faster processor or one with a specific instruction set.
i think you are right--probably the only case items you could bring to the new build are the dvd and floppy drives.
