<s> Have a MAG Innovision P900 LCD Monitor. </s>
<s> Problem is the screen going black. </s>
<s> Running XP Home on a computer (Wintergreen) bought from Tiger Direct last Christmas. </s>
<s> Symptom is screen going black. </s>
<s> Monitor power light remains green, moving mouse will not bring the display back, however if I cycle the monitor on and off display will come back for approx 2-3 seconds and then go black again. </s>
<s> I have display and power settings set to Never for the monitor and hard drive as well as hibernate off. </s>
<s> I did find the fan on the ATI Radeon 9500 video card had stopped running and very hard to turn, so instead of messing with ATI, I bought an Evga Nvidia based card, FX5500. </s>
<s> Refresh is at 60 hz, resolution on desktop set to 1024 X 768. </s>
<s> I know the MB is a cheapo and probably not the greatest with cooling, but that should not cause the display problems, so I am assuming the the LCD monitor is overheating. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> My next step is to swap it out with my used Gateway VX900 beast and see what happens, but would still like some input if possible. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> From your brief description of the problem, its sounds almost certainly like a power suppply problem in the monitor. </s>
<s> The easiest way to test it would be to grab a working monitor and hook it to your existing system, or take your monitor over to someone else's system and see if they are having the same problems. </s>
<s> LCD power supplies can be replaced (~$100, sometimes less) but from my recollection, MAG stuff is quite cheap and youre probably better off buying a new monitor. </s>
<s> But you can certainly stop swapping out video cards, as I really dont think thats whats causing your issue. </s>
<s> Hope that helps. </s>
<s> HooKs- </s>
<s> I have a similar problem with a Sony SDM X73. </s>
<s> I assume it is overheating but it may significant that the problem started to manifest itself after I tried an 'electronic whiteboard' attachment (a 'Sympodium')... to my computer (a Viglem VM4 Cube) In any case, powering the monitor off , leaving, then powering on again works . </s>
<s> I also look forward to any ideas on this one. </s>
<s> In most cases the &quot;backlight&quot; portion or its related power source is kaput or going out. </s>
<s> LCDs rely on such to lite the screen. </s>
<s> If you closely by a outside light source, you should still see abit low light display on the screen. </s>
<s> If so found then that's your problem. </s>
<s> You can have send to be repaired if under warranty or any other reputable source or just replace. </s>
<s> If repair is 50% or more than up to you to replace. </s>
<s> The quickest test is to swap monitors to check video output and if you get display then more than likely the LCD is flaky. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I have the exact same model of monitor and am experiencing the exact same problem. </s>
<s> It only stays on for 2 seconds, goes black, and I must press the power button 4x to get it back on for 2 seconds before it goes blank again. </s>
<s> I called Mag for support, and they said that my monitor was not under warrenty since it was 14 months old. </s>
<s> To get it fixed, it would cost $100 plus shipping. </s>
<s> I'm looking for a monitor from another company with a better support. </s>
<s> Never again. </s>
<s> Sounds like it's a known problem, and they should have been able to provide a fix. </s>
<s> I'm having the same problem with my HP Pavillion F1703 lcd. </s>
<s> It'll go dim for a second, the go black. </s>
<s> The power button seems faint, but still lit. </s>
<s> I can have the pc off all night, turn it on in the morning, and it still doesn't work. </s>
<s> Turn it off, run some errands, turn it on, works for hours before it goes out. </s>
<s> For some reason I was thinking it was a power issue, but not sure. </s>
<s> I bought a used CRT today and it's working fine. </s>
<s> It's the size of my car, but it works great. </s>
<s> The same thing happened to my 15&quot; MAG LCD. </s>
<s> It is not the Power Supply; it is rather the Backlight Inverter Module to blame (see picture linked below). </s>
<s> On my Inverter board one of the high voltage transformers shorted out and the backlight would turn on for two seconds, slightly dimmer than usual, and then will go off. </s>
<s> A skilled technician may fix the module on the component level if you find exact replacement miniature HV transformer (good luck with that! </s>
<s> ), or you may simply buy replacement inverter board for about seventy bucks a pop. </s>
<s> It may not be worth to repair since LCD monitors are cheap these days. </s>
<s> Here's a link with picture of the inverter board: http://www.lcdpart.com/Products/qpwbgl9931dldmss.html I'm not affiliated in any way with the above, just posting what I found out. </s>
<s> On the 1703, such a problem is commonly caused by poorly soldered toroidal coils on the inverter board. </s>
<s> My sister had the same monitor and problem, and I fixed it by popping it open and re-soldering the four toroidal coils. </s>
<s> A guide on how to do this, if you are so inclined, can be found here: http://www.lesliewong.us/blog/2005/05/02/hp-pavilion-f1703-flat-panel-display-blackout-solution/ </s>
<s> I'm now having the same trouble with a Sceptre LCD monitor and also the built-in CRT screen of an old iMac. </s>
<s> The difference with the CRT being that it stays dim for all but a fraction of a second while it's being powered on. </s>
<s> It appears from the response that I got from Sceptre and the identical response others got from their monitor manufacturers - that they fully expect their LCDs to have this problem after the (very short) warranty expires. </s>
<s> That attitude and the fact that they keep it secret from us is frankly, crappy. </s>
<s> While LCDs are more affordable than they were before, I wouldn't call them affordable.. and certainly not so if we're expected to buy a new one every 2 years. </s>
<s> That's ludicrous! </s>
<s> The way they're &quot;breaking&quot; is particularly upsetting and so is the cost of repair. </s>
<s> If something breaks, I don't expect it to flicker in and out of proper operation.. and I shouldn't expect the cost of repair to approach what it would cost to replace it! </s>
<s> What are they thinking? </s>
<s> That we're just made of money and we're fine with throwing away complex electronics that are 90% operational after a year of use? </s>
<s> WTF!? </s>
<s> I am quite angry about this.. particularly so since my second screen (previously mentioned) just got worse. </s>
<s> It previously was only going black when I'd have it off then turn it on again. </s>
<s> This time it's been on the whole time.. then went blank with no interaction from me. </s>
<s> I'm very disappointed. </s>
