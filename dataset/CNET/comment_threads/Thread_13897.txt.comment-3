why not upgrade the CPU cooler?
most are rated to a certain point, but end up running the CPU at high temps can you give us temp readings in C also, in F it really doesn't help i'd suggest the Thermalright SI-97 and a 92MM Panaflo High Speed (i bought the U.
High Speed, because it was the same cost but the noise is a bit louder) i'd also consider the motherboard as the source of the problem the PSU doesn't affect temps you need better cooling i'd suggest this: http://www.sidewindercomputers.com/thsiforamdat.html and either the Panaflo 92MM High Speed or 92MM Ultra High Speed (Their the same price last i checked, so it's really how much noise u wanna deal with) http://www.sidewindercomputers.com/arcemosi.html also get that yeah, it's a lot of TIM more than you'll probably ever use but the price is good, and you NEED A TIM don't not get it GET THAT the SI-97 comes w/o a thermal pad as for a motherboard http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=13-170-113&depa=1 that should work great
