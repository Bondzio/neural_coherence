computer (dell)has been working fine then yesterday i went to watch a video and it played fine but no voice.
so i checked to see if the volume might have gotten on mute but it was on it's regular setting.
the icon is no longer in the tray as it usually is.
then check sounds & devices and everything is grayed out staying no audio device can be found.
i checked everything else and update all the drivers but still no sound.
how could it suddenly disappear.
any help, as always is greatly appreciated.
