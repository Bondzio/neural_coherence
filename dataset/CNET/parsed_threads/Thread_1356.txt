<s> I transfered an old Gigabyte GA7-IXE4 with its AMD thunderbird freind into a clear side light up case, since I was modding and tweaking, I do have a new 64 bit PC, so If I did anything wrong it didnt really matter, which is why I wasnt dissapointed when It failed to work in it's new case, only the fans worked, and no beeps, I presumed it dead, understandeable since I found out my cat had actually been sitting inside the open case! </s>
<s> and knocking things onto the floor, so I guessed something would break. </s>
<s> I tried it today, and for some reason it started beeping, I have no monitor output, but it is going Beep, Beep-----Beep, what does it mean? </s>
<s> It does two beeps quikly then 1 more after a short delay. </s>
<s> With a move comes the possibility of some components being dislodged. </s>
<s> Try reseating the ram/video cards and find that cat a better place to nest. </s>

<s> That site wasn't much help, ive tried different Combos of RAM e.t.c and still no avail. </s>
<s> I think It's an AMIBIOS but the site didnt have 2--1 beeps. </s>
