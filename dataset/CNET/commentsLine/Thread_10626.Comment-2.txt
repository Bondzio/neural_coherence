as it is better to stay in budget, you might want to buy an overclocked version for a speed boost.
and then maybe later on throw in another one.
i wouldn't choose the xt because the gs can be had for a little more, and the clocks are different.
if you can save up the cash, go for the gs, if not the gt is fine.
~ibrahim~ p.s.
remember: you can always oc the cards, unlock pipelines, and even throw in another.
