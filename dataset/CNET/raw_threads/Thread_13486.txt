Is it possible to hook it up with the xbox to recieve the wireless signal that has been set up in my house???

I used my old Hawkings Wireless G USB reciever to plug into my 360 and voila, I could choose to use my network on the reciever. Just go to the network dashboard menu after you plugged it in and you should see the reciever, just highlight it and select use.
