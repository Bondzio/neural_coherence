1.1.1	I installed an Asus A7V8X motherboard, with Via KT400 chipset, about a year ago and have just realised that I only have USB 1.1 and it should be USB 2.	St
1.1.2	The Via CD provided with the motherboard won't allow me to download the USB 2 driver.	St
1.1.3	Their website says they cannot provide a download because of licence agreements with Microsoft.	St
1.1.4	Microsoft say the download is on service pack 1, but as I have service pack 2 installed, it won't allow me to download SP1.	St
1.1.5	I can't seem to find a USB 2 download on SP 2.	St
1.1.6	The Asus website doesn't seem to mention USB 2.	St
1.1.7	Where on earth can I get a driver to allow me to upgrade to USB 2?	St
1.2.1	1.	St
1.2.2	The place that supplied the board will make good.	St
1.2.3	2. Review http://www.usbman.com bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks, R. Proffitt.	St
1.3.2	www.usbman.com is great.	St
1.3.3	I've got USB 2 on one of my connectors for my camera (the most important).	St
1.3.4	Just need to figure out how to get it on the others connectors.	St
