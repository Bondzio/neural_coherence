I am getting the same CHKDSK error message.
My problem is that the output (the error message) was coded by Micro$oft, so they know what conditions precipitate it.
For example, it may mean that the MFT is hopeless corrupt or missing.
Why has M$ not documented the error message of their own utility?
&gt;New users are now demanding functionality that has &gt;not been included or even thought of.
Kinda bogus reply, don't ya think?
Obviously the functionality demanded is to fix a corrupt volume.
And M$ has thought to include the utility for many years - it's just an issue of documenting the error output.
