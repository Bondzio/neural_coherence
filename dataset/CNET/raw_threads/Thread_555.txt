On switching off and replacing the Memory Module, and turning on my PC, it continously makes three intermediate beeps and will not come up. Please what can I do? Now I need help.

I'm guessing the 3 beep code on your mobo has something to do with fried RAM. Check your manual to find out for sure. (if you can't find the manual look for it at mercury-pc.com) If it is bad RAM, then figure out which is the bad stick(s) and don't use it/them.

The risk is yours. If it were me. I won't trust this system to be reliable any more, though you can be lucky. BEWARE - Good ram may fail, if the same ram slot is used and fry every ram stick you install. Also possible the mtrbd. has taken a hit. Usually 3-beeps suggest some ram problem, but investigate your model# mtrbd. and see what the &quot;beep code&quot; refers to. Beeps can be long and short, so note the beep sequence. If you wanted a reason to &quot;upgrade&quot; here you go. tada -----Willy

On this one, just a heads-up -- the DDR ram is not going to work for your next computer, as we're transitioning from DDR2 to DDR3. So if you have to buy RAM to replace the fried stick(s), that investment won't carry on to your next computers in the future.
