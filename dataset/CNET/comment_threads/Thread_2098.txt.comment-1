Hey is there anyone who can help me?
I have an dell dimesion 4400 very old it has a dpt478 motherboard.
I have a 1.6 pentium in it and have just scored a celeron d335+ processor.
I see the cooling fan and heat sinks dont fit but can i still use the processor with my old coolling system?
Do i have to edit and bios ****?
Any help would be much apreciated...
