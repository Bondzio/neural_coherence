I have a network setup in my house using a Netgear wireless N router.
I have a new Dell Desktop with Windows 7 hardwired to the router and a Canon printer connected by USB to that computer.
I have a laptop with Vista and am trying to get that to to print wireless to the Canon printer.
When trying to print from the laptop I get a message which says that the print drivers can not be found on the laptop.
Do I need the drivers installed on the laptop if the print is connected to the desktop?
