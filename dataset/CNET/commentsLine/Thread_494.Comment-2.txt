for example, the hidden 'administrator' account (default: no password) you only see on the safe mode welcome screen.
things like this are exactly the reason why it's recommended to have 2 admin accounts available (and reachable) on a machine.
if one is corrupted (that could be the case here) you can use the other to make a new one, transfer files and continue as if (practically) nothing had happened.
of course, if the corruption is on a 'deeper' level, this won't help.
