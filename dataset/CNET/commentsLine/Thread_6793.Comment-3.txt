for example if you try to play games on xp with just 256 ram the video card likely doesn't matter.
similarly, borderline minimal requirements on either may not be good if the game is graphic intensive.
meanwhile you could have all the memory in the world but an integrated video with limited memory, e.g.
a 64 mb integrated video configuration, would also limit gaming experiences.
