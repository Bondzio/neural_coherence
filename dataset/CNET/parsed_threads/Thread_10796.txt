<s> I have a PC using Windows XP and a Radeon X1950 graphic card and have purchased a VGA cable to connect to my TV. </s>
<s> I have plugged the cable in but am not sure what else, if anything, I need to do. </s>
<s> Please can anybody walk me through, at novice level, as to what I should be doing. </s>
<s> Many thanks </s>
<s> switch it to vga mode. </s>
<s> What happen? </s>
<s> Some video card needs to be set to tv mode. </s>
<s> What does the manual tell you. </s>
<s> Hi, Thanks for your reply, which manual, TV or PC? </s>
<s> I'd say he means the manual of the video card. </s>
<s> But it seems a rather good idea to read the TV manual also. </s>

<s> I do not have the manual to the video card, hence the request for a walk through at novice level. </s>
<s> Excerpt from http://ati.amd.com/products/radeonx1950/radeonx1950xtx/specs.html What's in the Box * Radeon X1950 XTX graphics card * Set-up CD * Composite and S-video cables * HDTV out cable * DVI to VGA adapters * Manuals Display Support * DVI-I connectors for high-resolution digital displays * Xilleon TV encoder for analog output * YPrPb component output for direct drive of HDTV displays * VGA mode support on all outputs TV-out * SDTV (analog): 480i | 525i * HDTV (analog or digital): 480p | 720p | 1080i | Any custom resolution So the manual should have been in the box. </s>
<s> Luckily, most often they put a pdf-version on the install cd also. </s>
<s> Have a look. </s>
<s> With all these possibilities (and cables included) you should be able to make at least one match with your TV, whatever it is. </s>

<s> I didn't install this graphics card nor inherit the manual and installation CD. </s>
<s> As I mentioned, novice level is required, please can anybody explain what I need to do? </s>
<s> Find the right cable, the right connector on your TV, the right connector on your card and the right settings on both devices. </s>
<s> That's all. </s>
<s> Without manuals and CD's it's somewhat more difficult than if you should have them. </s>
<s> The basic rule: try using the same connector on both ends (be it analog, HDMI, Scart, DVI or composite video). </s>
<s> Sorry to be of no more help. </s>
<s> If you can't find out, take your PC and the manual of your TV with you to the shop and ask them for the right cable. </s>
<s> That might be a good start. </s>
<s> Then explore the settings of your video card. </s>
