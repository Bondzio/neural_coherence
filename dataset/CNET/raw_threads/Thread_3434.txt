In the sense asked, or if it does, another solution to pack more data on a disk is to use a Plextor Unit that uses some of the error correction space on the disk for actual writing of data. This might be called &quot;over burning&quot; the disk or over burning might be what you need to google to find other solutions. I don't know if that causes compatibility issues with other players or not. When I looked at this issue, I concluded it was cheaper to buy more media than to spend it on hardware and now I am burning to dvd media which is far cheaper per gigabyte. Good Luck.///bobbo.
