I'm doing gaming on my PC, and I don't need more than 150 GB space. so, I geuss what I'm asking is it better to buy the raptor, or get a 7200 RPM, hard drive? My specs, Asus M2N-E SLI, AMD 64 X2 3800+ thermaltake PurePower 430 watts Xion 4 case, EVGA 8600 GTS

8070	5	290247	2744302	2744295	strongwinds	4/3/08 4:06 PM	1.20723876E12	yah, but,,......	thats proably true, but I can't afford the 8800 series, and I play Battle for middle earth2 and it can run it maxed settings. No lag
8070	6	290247	2753513	2744302	strongwinds	4/17/08 10:54 AM	1.20842964E12	also	when you talk about bang for buck,I payed $90 fro the EVGA 8600 GTS. so its still a good deal for that.
