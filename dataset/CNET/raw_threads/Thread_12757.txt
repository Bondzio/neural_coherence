Whenever I conect a headhone to my jack (which is on my tower in the front) it works then sort of pops out . In other words I have to keep pushing it in and holding it. I tried the headohines on other devices it works. I have tried other devices to the computer and it still doesent work. So I guess its broken? Where could I buy this part. ( the jack)? Is it possible I could insatll it my self? Thanks all help is appreciated. google003
