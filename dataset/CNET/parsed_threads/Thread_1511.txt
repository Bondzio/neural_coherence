<s> Recently I have had some problems with my Presario desktop computer overheating out of control. </s>
<s> It idles at around 60 Degrees Celsius and gets over 80 Degrees Celsius when loading just about anything. </s>
<s> Here are the specs for my computer: Motherboard Name </s>
<s> Here is a screen shot of the madness lol [IMG] http://i28.tinypic.com/2hi2ff5.jpg [/IMG] </s>
<s> Are no longer touched by most repair shops. </s>
<s> The care and feeding of the CPU is well known so I won't write any words about heatsinks or compound as you can google that. </s>
<s> But if the machine just needs to get more life I find disabling the L1 and L2 Cache to cure random crashes at the expense of speed. </s>
<s> It's sad to read you have yet to refresh the heatsink compound. </s>

<s> Have you tried a slot cooler. </s>
<s> I surmised from your specs you have at least one PCI slot open for this addition. </s>
<s> Just an example. </s>
<s> Read the comments. </s>
