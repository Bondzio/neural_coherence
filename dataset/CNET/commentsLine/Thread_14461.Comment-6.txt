yes and no...... vista is creating some strange hardware issues.
as with win9x dissimilar memory would pass diagnostic tests in dos but fail in windows using nsw memory test utility(norton system works.
your original memory configuration proves this to be true using a single stick of ram.
or with dissimilar memory the system would not boot due to the mb support.
couple of other items i have seen: client added 4 gigs of ram to his system, vista 32 bit, for a total of 6 gigs of ram.
task manager reported 2 gigs (no switch on boot.ini)of physical ram, 4 gigs of virtual memory.
upgraded laptops to 1 gig of memory pulled from the shelfs at (you know who).
these systems run doggy and strange, re-order/install the correct ram no issues.
in closing vista is going to force us to re-evaluate what we know of hardware/os relationships.
to answer your first question no vista will run w/1 gig of ram.
2 would be better.
