<s> I'm having trouble pairing my laptop with my desktop bluetooth. </s>
<s> I successfully paired another device only a few days ago so I'm 99.99% certain I'm using the correct pairing key. </s>
<s> How can I check the pairing key on my laptop bluetooth to be sure I'm using the correct key? </s>
<s> P.S. </s>
<s> I changed it from the default key a long time ago, and I have been successfully pairing devices up until now. </s>
<s> I do some BT programming but unless we get lucky and it's one of the usual I think you should change the key to something you know. </s>

<s> I'm having trouble with a laptop running Win XP SP3. </s>
<s> Where can I find what the key actually is? </s>
<s> Or is there a way I can restore it to the default key and then change it back? </s>
<s> But as there are no less than 5 blue tooth stacks, I can't tell you where the controls are. </s>
<s> I've seen Toshiba, Widcomm, MSFT, Blue Soleil, something with Samsung on it and now some Chinese stacks. </s>
<s> Each one is accessed in some different way so I can't answer this one without the final detail. </s>
<s> But do look around. </s>
<s> Here's the Microsoft article about theirs. </s>

<s> I want to have all my devices paired with each other. </s>
<s> I have an Asus Eee Pad Transformer Tablet with Bluetooth that I use to send photos among my devices. </s>
<s> I was able to pair all of the devices with no problem except the Toshiba Laptop. </s>
<s> I have paired the Asus Tablet with the Desktop Computer and the Desktop Computer with the Tablet and a Bluetooth printer. </s>
<s> The Asus Tablet does not support WiFi printing and only supports photos via Bluetooth. </s>
<s> My Desktop Computer is running Win VISTA Premium and my Toshiba Laptop is running Win XP SP3. </s>
<s> P.S. </s>
<s> Since my laptop is rather old and I was using the Bluetooth Stack for Windows which came already installed on the laptop, I just might remove that and get newer Bluetooth Adapter and use that. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> I uninstalled the Bluetooth Stack and re-installed it. </s>
<s> Issue is now resolved. </s>
