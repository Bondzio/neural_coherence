<s> That card plugs into a normal PCI Express slot on the motherboard. </s>
<s> I don't think the power supply has anything to do with it. </s>
<s> Forget about what it &quot;calls for.&quot; Computers don't use nearly as much power as they claim. </s>
<s> a 300 watt supply is more than enough for any system. </s>
<s> Besides, one graphics card hardly makes a dent... What is a normal PCI Express Slot? </s>
<s> You should have said a PCI-Express (x16) slot. </s>
<s> THE POWER SUPPLY HAS A LOT TO DO WITH IT!!! </s>
<s> The ATI X800XL requires a 350Watt PSU, that's including CPU, DRIVES, ETC... And also oem psu (except dell) would never run at their written wattages, maybe when it was new. </s>

<s> Besides, one graphics card hardly makes a dent...&quot; A 300 watt is probably sufficient for a decent Pentium III, but bare minimum for a AMD AThlon 64 or Definitely a Pentium 4 Prescott. </s>

<s> BTW DAGGER, all of your posts were simply hilarious, as it seems you have no ******* clue as to what you're talking about. </s>
