the integrated graphics chip on the new will be far faster than what you have in your old pc.
if you are unhappy with the performance of the new pc you may always add a graphics card later.
if the integrated graphics uses 256 meg of the pcs memory make sure the new pc has at least, preferably 4 or more gig.
ideally the motherboard should allow you to upgrade to at least 8 gb.
