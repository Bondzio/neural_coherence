i have resolved the problem,thanks to you.
i decided to use an 80 wire cable instead of the 40 wire ide cable, as you indicated.
when i pulled the drives out i found a black jumper (not visible while drive was in computer) as well as the white jumper i installed to set the drive to master.
the additional jumper must have been from previous installation of the drive in another computer where the alternate jumper setting was needed.
i pulled the jumper off and re-installed the drives using the 80 wire ide cable.
the drives are working fine now and seem quieter.
