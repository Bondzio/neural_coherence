I installed a FireWire PCI adapter for my DVD burner and the BIOS cannot detect it, even Windows does not. Does this computer support FireWire? Thanks for your help.

You seem to be expecting something that is and was never a feature of your classic PC. Tell more why you expected this to be found in the BIOS. I read your post and see no question. End your question with a question mark next time. Bob

Finally this kind of MB does not have the option of USB/FireWire in the BIOS. Means the BIOS cannot detect the DVD burner from the FireWire port.&quot; There is no question here. As to your first post, almost NO PCs made will do this. It's not a feature of most PCs so nothing busted. Did you need a history lesson on the Personal Computer? Bob

Not from the BIOS view. Almost NO PC made would list what's plugged into the firewire cards from the BIOS. Does this help? Bob
