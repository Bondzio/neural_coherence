i think i misunderstood what you were looking for.
let's try a more focused forum.
start at  and pick the forum that fits.
here we have a discussion forum which is more discussion than support.
at times a new member gets confused about that and is looking for support.
sometimes you get support but there are no paid staffers which means we'll try to get you pointed to the right places.
