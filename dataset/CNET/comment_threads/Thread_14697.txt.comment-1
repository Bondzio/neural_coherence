I have encountered a puzzler.
The Asus SK8V motherboard was designed for the AMD Athlon64 FX-51 processor.
Here's the problem: The registered, tested and recommended memory for the MB is non-ecc.
The processor requires ecc memory.
What do I do?
I suppose I should go with ecc since I plan to fill all of the dual slots with memory.
Correct?
Not correct?
I'm confoozled!
