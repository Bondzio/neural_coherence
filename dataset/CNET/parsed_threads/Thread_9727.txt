<s> I am having a problem with setting up the 2 different networks. </s>
<s> It says I am able to have 2 networks in this 1 router and I was able to set up the 2 networks, but i do not see the second network in my network list. </s>
<s> I have a total of 7 devices that are connected to the router and my main thing I wanted to do was have 1 laptop on its own network and be able to use the 5ghz channel. </s>
<s> Any help would be great and thanks in advance. </s>
<s> must be 5GHz capable or otherwise no go. </s>
<s> Most consumer adapters are 2.4 only, even at N. Suggest using USB 5GHz adapters. </s>
