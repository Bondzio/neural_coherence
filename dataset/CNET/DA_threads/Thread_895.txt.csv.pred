1.1.1	My Epson stylus c-62 printer has recently started printing only part of a page, even if i print a multiple page document, i get only the top part of the pages- sometimes just a few lines, sometimes half the page, sometimes two thirds of a page.	St
1.1.2	this happens no matter what my source is, word, notepad, internet, it does not matter.	St
1.1.3	it worked fine when i was using windows 98, i recently upgraded to windows xp.	St
1.1.4	i can't remember if it started when i changed over or if it was awhile after.	St
1.1.5	my pc is a dell pentium 4,with alot of RAM and a large hard drive.	St
1.1.6	i have tried everything.	St
1.1.7	please help.	Sug
1.2.1	2.	St
1.2.2	Please contact me via my profile.	Sug
1.2.3	I have a few spare ink carts for the c62 Bob	St
1.3.1	Here is the website for the newer drivers, etc for the C-62 http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/supDetail.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=yes&oid=14418&prodoid=22966681&infoType=Downloads&platform=Windows It could also be that there has been a problem for the printer.	St
1.3.2	If the new drivers do not solve the problem, I would explore a different printer as the C-62 is getting old.	St
