I wanted to upgrade it so I bought an XFX 8600GT PCI Express Nvideo card. It worked for about 5 months, then it died. I could still hook up the monitor to the onboard graphics chip and it worked. Next, I bought a Sapphire 8650 PCI Express ATI card. It worked fine about 3 weeks and then it failed. Again I can still hook up the monitor to the onboard graphics chip, but of course its graphic capabilities are slow. Can my motherboard be frying graphic cards? I am afraid to buy another one for fear it will fry after a couple of days. I returned the XFX card under warranty and eventually they will send me another and I can try that one, but who knows how long that will last. Anybody has any ideas?

It rated 300W. Graphics cards like you're describing may prefer 400-450W. It might be heat, too. Keep the insides of your tower clean, and be sure it's where it can breathe ok.

It will list EVERYTHING about your ride, including power supply. Most gateways have a 300 watt PSU. The fx and a few multi-media will have 400 watters.
