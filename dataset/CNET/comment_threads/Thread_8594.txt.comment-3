Hi Bob, I replaced the guest (Win Mn.)
computer only.
I should tell you that a few days ago, I had the system working fine on these same two same computers with a 100% signal.
I then decided to reformat the hard drive on the guest computer.
I did that and then replaced the software etc.
It tells me that I'm getting a 67% signal but won't log on to the Internet.
Valerie
