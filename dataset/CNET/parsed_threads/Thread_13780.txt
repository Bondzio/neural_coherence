<s> I have a Dell XPS 400 (new in 2005) that was shipped with an ATI Radeon X300 SE 128mb HyperMemory video card. </s>
<s> It is incapable of showing my HD videos from my new 18 megapixel Canon camera without the image &quot;jumping&quot; or &quot;stuttering&quot; on the screen. </s>
<s> I want to purchase a new video card that will perform better and that my Dell machine will be capable of using. </s>
<s> I am currently running Windows XP Media Edition Version 2002 with SP 3, but I plan on upgrading to Windows 7 Professional after installing a new video card. </s>
<s> The processor is an Intel Pentium IV, 3.0 GHz with 4GB of RAM. </s>
<s> Can someone please recommend a good to high quality video card for me to purchase? </s>
<s> you've got a 375watt power supply that should be able to handle these cards. </s>
<s> radeon hd 5750, about $155 radeon hd 5670, abut $110 geforce gts 240, about $110 but your power supply is 5 years old. </s>
<s> it may not hold up well with a hd 5750 due to it's age. </s>
<s> i also don't think the power supply can handle a gts 250 (about $140) because they draw too much power. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help </s>
