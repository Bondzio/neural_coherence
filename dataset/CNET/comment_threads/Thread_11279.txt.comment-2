Upgrading motherboard and CPU means purchasing another XP license, too.
Add a video card upgrade and it's likely you will also need to upgrade your PSU.
I'd keep it &quot;as is&quot; and use it as a general purpose machine (word processing, Internet, music/video watching, etc.).
I'd build a new machine centered around an Intel Core 2 Duo CPU as a first choice.
Another option would be to start with an AMD Athlon 64 X2 (socket AM2) CPU.
