I replaced a Lynksys router with Belkin N+ router.
I am having internet connection issues.
I worked with Belkin support.
They updated the firmware, changed channel but the wireless internet speed is 20% of the cable modem speed.
I have 2 laptops with windows Xp.
I also would like to connect my 1TB portable drive to the USB port.
Please suggest the settings for this router.
I will be so greatful.
