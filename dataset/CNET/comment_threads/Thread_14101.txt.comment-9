If an XPS could be shipped &quot;bare naked&quot; to you - that is without any factory installed &quot;free-trial&quot; software, then you'd have no one to blame but yourself for the heartache and frustration that you will likely encounter.
You can expect to spend hours on the phone with the techies trying to troubleshoot issues that, in my opinion, should have been resolved at the factory before the unit was ever shipped.
For this kind of money I expected &quot;plug and play&quot; but was instead frustrated and very disappointed in my $3,000 XPS600.
