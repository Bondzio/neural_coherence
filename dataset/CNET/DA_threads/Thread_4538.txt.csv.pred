1.2.1	You need a PC video card with that resolution and connector output .	St
1.2.2	I did n't research your video card .	St
1.2.3	If it does n't have the proper output you 'll need to get one that does .	St
1.2.4	There 's no way to change the TVs PC input .	St
1.3.1	I am guessing you do n't have 1080p on that TV .	St
1.3.2	If it has 1080p , I am pretty sure there would also be hdmi connection .	St
1.3.3	What kind of contents are you trying to view at 1080p ?	Ques
1.3.4	You have a PS3 or blu-ray player on that PC ?	Ques
1.3.5	I will also venture to say if you do n't have a HD video card you might not have much fun trying to output 1080p contents .	St
1.3.6	Just my thoughts .	Polite
