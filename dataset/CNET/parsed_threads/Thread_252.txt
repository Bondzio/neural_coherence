<s> I have a Compaq PC, 733 mhz, P3, 128mb RAM, currently running an NVidia TNT2 graphics card. </s>
<s> I'd like to upgrade the graphics, now that there are plenty of used G-Force cards on the market. </s>
<s> I play a lot of older games (Unreal Tournament, Riven, Madden 2002, Ghost Recon), but there are some newer games that I'd like to get which require a better graphics card. </s>
<s> Is there a noticeable difference between a G-Force 2 and G-Force 4 card? </s>
<s> Any other suggestions? </s>
<s> To be honest your GFX card upgrade wouldn't do an awful lot without the memory been upgrading too. </s>
<s> I would check out the games you WANT to play and see what the system requirments are. </s>
<s> The GeForce 4 is quite a step up from the GeForce 2, The TNT card were very good in their day like the GF2 Mx 400's. </s>
<s> Do as Matt-Page suggest, add at least another 128MB of RAM before you do anything. </s>
<s> It is not hard to do. </s>
<s> Check http://www.crucial.com for what type you will need for your particular PC. </s>
<s> Here are some old test of Video Cards that show performance rating under different games. </s>

<s> My nephew has a similar system. </s>
<s> But it's a 1Ghz and 256MB. </s>
<s> I fitted a DVDROM drive so he has his own DVD player too. </s>
<s> At 733MHz, that's more than enough for DVD playback, but 128MB will be far too tight. </s>
<s> I'd forget today's games on such a machine. </s>
<s> But 512MB is not a bad idea. </s>
<s> If you find a CHEAP!!! </s>
<s> GeForce 2GTS or there abouts, it will deliver about 2X or better the graphic speed, but with that CPU and RAM it will never be a gaming machine except for old titles (try the year 2000). </s>

<s> A very good card. </s>
<s> Cheap. </s>
<s> Need an AGP slot, I'm not sure if they come connectable to standard PCI slots. </s>
<s> GeForce Ti4200 with 64mb and after 2 years of heavy use it still competes with newer cards. </s>
<s> I benchmarked (3DMarkSE) against a new ATI 9600 (256mb) and beat it handily. </s>
<s> Furthermore this card can be overclocked, however it can get unstable by doing so, so I leave it at the default settings. </s>
<s> Just make sure you have the AGP slot like the previous poster said. </s>
<s> It has a fan so it will drain a bit more power than your old card, I am guessing. </s>
