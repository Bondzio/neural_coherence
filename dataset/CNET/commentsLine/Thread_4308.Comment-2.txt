&quot;wont that system crash with these hardware installed?&quot; i've yet to find any pc that never crashed.
so the answer is always yes, it will eventually crash.
hopefully it's so infrequent that it doesn't become a problem.
&quot;also,can i use a cd writer to play a dvd?&quot; no.
but you can try if you don't believe it.
