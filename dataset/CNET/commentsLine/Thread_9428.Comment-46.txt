i noticed that one of our biggest computer shops is advertising everything at 50% discount.
to me that means there is something in the wind and made me decide to wait until after mid-year before replacing my computer.
when the new stuff comes out give it 4 to 6months and then look around.
being a keen flight simmer i always need the best but i have woken up to the fact that it is better to wait until all the kinks have been sorted out before buying.
