1.1.1	I just purchased a sony 17 in LCD SDMHS75P/B The analog works fine but when I switch it to DVI it says no input signal Ive tried everything the manual said to do even sony support no luck I have a nvida Geforce FX 5200 with DVI I The cable with the sony monitor is a DVI D cable .	St
1.1.2	Could this be the problem or is it the video card .	St
1.1.3	Windows XP is the OS With service pack 2 .	St
1.2.1	Go into the properties section of display , find the default setting or basic VGA setting , accept it and save before leaving .	St
1.2.2	Shutdown system , connect DVI cable , then power-UP , hopefully , if should see new hardware and proceed foward .	St
1.2.3	If not , does the Sony have any CD/floppy with it ?	Ques
1.2.4	it may contain the drivers to better accept the Sony LCD/monitors display ranges , etc..	St
1.2.5	AND/OR under 5200 setting , make sure you select what display is now 1 , or 2 if more than one , if only one , then the other is OFF or not active , though it should do this automatically .	St
1.2.6	5200 display setting can be updated , so get the latest either from the video card maker or Nvida support website .	St
1.2.7	enjoy -- -- -Willy	Polite
