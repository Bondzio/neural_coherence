<s> hello, I have some great cd burning utilites from my plextor drive, but I retired the drive cuz it was only 12x. </s>
<s> can I install and use those programs those on a win 2000 machine with a 52x lite-on drive? </s>
<s> or will it only work with the plextor drive? </s>

<s> OEM bundled software rarely works across drives. </s>
<s> You can try it, but don't get too much hope... Bob </s>
<s> I agree with Robert, bundled s/w isn't a given to work on other drives, but you can try. </s>
<s> Now, maybe a good time to try a &quot;retail&quot; versions and understand they offer alot more than when you got your older s/w. </s>
<s> The most notable are Roxio and Nero. </s>
<s> I lean towards Nero, but you can check your CD/RW burner support website they may provide an OEM for your use. </s>
<s> If you like a very cheap retail version(older), try this website: http://www.pcliquidators.com/ and look for CD Creator v3.x, I believe under s/w area. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> If it is name brand burning software, it probably won't recognize the newer drive. </s>
<s> You may be able to upgrade the drive recognition part of the software for free. </s>
<s> If you have saved burning profiles, some burning software is NOT backwards compatible (yes roxio, I mean you!) </s>
<s> The new drive doesn't have decent software? </s>
<s> well this old plextor has a program called audio capture that is just so EASY. </s>
<s> I still have it running in a win 98 machine. </s>
<s> no muss, no fuss. </s>
<s> I miss it. </s>
<s> with these new programs, I always forget which of the 200 buttons does the one thing I want. </s>
<s> I actually have to write little notes to myself to remind me how to do some simple task that took an hour of digging around in menus to find. </s>
<s> I can't decipher the program that came with my creative sound card. </s>
