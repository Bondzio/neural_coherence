1.1.1	I've been trying to fix up my other pc, getting new parts and such, but I want to see if anyone has any ideas before I go out and buy parts I may not need.	St
1.1.2	I had it working and then I changed out the CPU.	St
1.1.3	It had been months since I had turned it on, but when I plugged in the power, the power supply just blew.	St
1.1.4	I heard the sparks and smelled the smoke... anyway, that's not the question, I think the power socket is messed up and the power supply was cheap.	St
1.1.5	Anyway, I used another power supply, and the PC would turn on as soon as it was supplied with power (no input from me whatsoever), but nothing on the screen would come up and the power/reset buttons did nothing.	St
1.1.6	The CPU fan and the drives and such would all turn on, that's what I mean by the computer being on.	St
1.1.7	So I thought maybe the power supply was faulty, so I got a new one.	St
1.1.8	This new power supply has a on/off switch in the back to control the power supply.	St
1.1.9	Same thing - as soon as the switch is flipped to on, all of the fans and the drives go on (I can even open/close them), but nothing onscreen and no response from power/reset buttons.	St
1.1.10	I have two guesses - one, the case (along with the power/reset buttons) is messed up, or the motherboard is messed up.	St
1.1.11	I think the latter is more likely, since nothing comes up on the screen... but I'm not completely sure.	St
1.1.12	Any ideas?	St
1.2.1	Before you go out & buy a new MoBo, try the power button/reset switch angle.	St
1.2.2	On many systems the mechanical elements are usually the most vulnerable, especially if not used for a while.	St
1.2.3	Power down, remove the power cord and remove the shorting pins connecting the reset switch to the MoBo.	St
1.2.4	Power up your system and see if your system boots.	St
1.2.5	If it does then you will need a new reset microswitch, unless you can live without one.	St
1.2.6	Alternatively, a very small squirt of WD-40 to the microswitch may help (unless it's broken, of course).	St
1.2.7	A new case is another alternative.	St
1.2.8	Good Luck	St
1.3.1	First thing to check obviously is the jumpers from the power/reset to the motherboard.	St
1.3.2	Maybe hit it with a little canned air while in there.	St
1.3.3	That is the easiest solution.	St
1.3.4	From my experience building them, many power supplies turn on the computer once they are plugged in (unless they have the on/off switch on the back).	St
1.3.5	Sometimes I've found that you should unplug and replug everything and clean the gold connectors on all the AGP/PCI slots.	St
1.3.6	Also, if the boot screen isn't coming up at all then that makes me think that either your video card isn't plugged in/working or your system memory (RAM) isn't seated properly.	St
1.3.7	Those are the things I would check before having to buy a new motherboard.	St
1.4.1	Thanks to both of you for your responses.	St
1.4.2	I would've responded quicker, but I wanted to try out the solutions beforehand... and alas, I still haven't tried them yet.	St
1.4.3	But thanks, I really appreciate it Hopefully I'll get to try them out tonight.	St
