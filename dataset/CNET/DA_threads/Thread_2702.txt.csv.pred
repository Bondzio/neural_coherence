1.1.1	Does anyone know a site that can tell me how to set up a wireless network with two different operating systems ?	Ques
1.1.2	Please be specific , give a link or something , do n't just say look around CNET .	Sug
1.2.1	http : //www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/article.php/3111111 For example , here is a Linux based WAP .	St
1.2.2	Since Windows is covered widely I did n't supply a link .	St
1.2.3	there are many ( too many ) articles about this .	St
1.2.4	The killer item however is that in Linux , many fail to research if there is support for their card .	St
1.2.5	That tends to be the issue Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks fo the link , but what I need is a good thoruogh , informative link for networking for Windows .	St
1.3.2	All of the sites I have seen so far have only talked about networking with XP .	St
1.3.3	I 'm trying to network two computers .	St
1.3.4	One has Windwos 2000 and one has XP .	St
1.4.1	You do n't have a WAP .	St
1.4.2	Yes this is rarely covered but you missed it since it 's called by another name .	St
1.4.3	- & gt ; It 's called ADHOC networking .	St
1.4.4	I never had to consult any documentation to set that up .	St
1.4.5	I set the adapters to ADHOC mode and waited .	St
1.4.6	Too easy and maybe why it 's not covered widely .	St
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	If WAP is a wireless access point , I have a wireless router ( D-Link DI-624 ) .	St
1.5.2	THe router is wired to the DSL Modem and my PC .	St
1.5.3	My laptop has an ATHEROS AR5001X+ Wireless Network Adapter .	St
1.5.4	The problem is that , on both the PC and the laptop , when I try to dial into the internet , Enternet says there was no response from the remote computer .	St
1.5.5	As well , although I 'm pretty sure the computers are connected I ca n't get them to share printers or files .	St
1.5.6	Eveything I 've read on networking so far has either been for Windows 98 or XP , never for 2000 .	St
1.5.7	I 'm sure it will be pretty easy to enable file and printer sharing , but my bigger problem is the internet .	St
1.5.8	If know a way to fix this let me know , but if you know any good sites that could help , that would be fine .	St
1.5.9	Thanks for your help .	Polite
1.6.1	Why are you doling out the details ?	Ques
1.6.2	I 've guessed wrong 2 times now and given your useless information .	St
1.6.3	Sorry about that , but it could explain why you are finding it difficult to find help .	St
1.6.4	In closing , it seems you have a normal setup .	St
1.6.5	In that case just read what came with the router .	St
1.6.6	Nothing is out of the ordinary so I bid you well and write that your setup has thousands of web sites of help .	St
1.6.7	Bob	St
1.7.1	All I want is a good site .	Polite
1.7.2	If there are thousands of sites that address my issue , ca n't you give me a one or two ?	Ques
1.7.3	I have n't found any for networking Windows 2000 to XP .	St
1.8.1	99.99 % of the time set the TCPIP settings in XP and 2000 to DHCP then plug them into the DLINK router .	St
1.8.2	Bingo .	St
1.8.3	They are now networked .	St
1.8.4	You have yet to reveal what networking feature is not working or if you ca n't share files or more .	St
1.8.5	I ca n't guess what step is eluding you .	St
1.8.6	You may have done something like installed a FIREWALL and did n't allow filesharing , but this is yet to be revealed .	St
1.8.7	Please take time to tell more .	Sug
1.8.8	Bob	St
1.9.1	http : //support.dlink.com/products/view.asp ? productid=DI-624 and click on the product manual link .	St
1.9.2	Follow the directions .	St
1.9.3	So far , nothing shared here reveals anything other than a stock setup .	St
1.9.4	Cheers , Bob	St
1.10.1	My problems are that I ca n't connect to my DSL connection , I might be picking up the neighbours broadband connection and I ca n't file and print share .	St
1.10.2	As well , when I created a netsetup file ( with the Network Setup Wizard ) on my Windows XP Laptop my Windows 2000 computer told me that netsetup was not compatible with Windows 2000 .	St
1.10.3	However , I finally got Windows XP so I 'm going to install that and then reset the router .	St
1.10.4	Hopefully then I will be able to set up the network .	St
1.10.5	Thanks for your help anyways .	Polite
