<s> No big problem, but even though my other sounds seems to to working, I am not getting the Windows music when I start and shutdown Windows XP. </s>
<s> I went into sounds on the control panel and the music works when I test it there. </s>
<s> I uninstalled my sound card in device manager and then restarted and windows put it back but still no music. </s>
<s> I really don't know what your problem might be, but, just for the heck of it, have you tried using different WAV files for the startup and/or shutdown sounds? </s>
<s> It might help you further diagnose the problem. </s>

<s> Hi, I am guessing that you have installed TweakUI, and if so, check that the option 'beep on errors' is ticked. </s>
<s> For some strange reason unchecking this removes the startup and shutdown sounds. </s>
<s> Let us know Messa </s>
<s> auggief hi try this, also anyone else who has the same problem with there startup and shutdown sounds in xp. </s>
<s> Click start, click run, type regedit and enter. </s>
<s> click on HKEY_CURRENT_USER to highlight it, then in the right plain where it says (default) REG_SZ value not set right click on (default) click delete and your problem hopefully will be sorted Its an easy fix usually happens after a bsod or a faulty download, if your not sure about changing things in your registry than i would recommend you back it up first before doing anything, but like i said before its an easy fix and if you follow what i have said you should be ok. </s>
