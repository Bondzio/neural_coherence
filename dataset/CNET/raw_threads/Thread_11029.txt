I have another computer pc2 with windows me. i hooked up to pc1 with a cross over cable. the conection works for the internet, but when i bring in a laptop with a wireless conection to pc1 it wont let me print. i cant connect pc2 to the router. i shared the printer and files when i went thru the wizard. i checked the printer and its shared. not sure what elese to check.

Instead of using a cross over cable, just use a patch cable and connect it to your router for that computer. You should then be able to share files and printer between these computers.
