Ok so I have a dvd box set that I stupidly ordered from a seller located in the UK.
Problem is that they are a different region as the US.
This wouldn't be such a problem but it seems like everything is equipped with these lame region restrictions.
The most problematic at this time is my DVD-RW drive.
Apparently you can only change it's region a limited number of times and I have reached the limit.
My question for all the geekier people out there than myself is what can I do to beat the region problem?
below is link to a screen shot of the driver region status for the DVD-RW which is basically saying I'm screwed.
BTW I have a eMachines T6410 (I know it's lame) Any help or advice at all would be greatly appreciated!
