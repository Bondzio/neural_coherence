I use Linux and FreeBSD which is a UNIX variant.
I also use Minix and Plan9, both are UNIX variants also.
Again, no manufacturer makes Windows, they install it.
I only know of IBM, Sun, and HP as being both manufacturers and devlopers of software systems; and, even then, the machines have to have the system installed.
The article points to Linux using this feature since 2000.The feature is not new.
