This was my first PC..a P4 1.8GHz..256 MBs RAM..Home Edition Sp1.. a FAT32 System Drive..30-GBs..McAFEE Security..it was a nice PC.. ..
I pulled the HDD first/added a MAXTOR 120-GB DiamondMAX[NTFS]File System..added a second RAM Chip for 512MBs of RAM..and the Microsoft CD came out for SP2..so my Home Edition was raised to SP2..how-ever..I also added the XP-Professional Upgrade CD(SP2)..and this is where I began to develop &quot;complications&quot;.. ..
So..for a DELL Dimension 2350 I would suggest the latest SP2 XP Full Version Operating System..no Upgrades or SP2 CDs.. Then 512 MBs of RAM..that Motherboard runs really slow RAM(133MHz)if my memory serves me..that's a problem in these times with HUGE Updateing Services..My Updates have DOUBLED in 6-years.. ..
So your running all day with a Shut-Down Problem..
I suggest you slow down on Shutting Down.. First..getting to the DeskTop..Signing Off the Internet.. Use the DISK CLEAN UP Program..but wait about 30-seconds before CLicking the ICON(shortcut)..let it RUN..get back to the DeskTop..Click the START-Menu..Click...TURN-OFF Computer..now wait until the DeskTOP darkens before Clicking TURN-OFF COMPUTER..and that should work..otherwise/yes some Device is still running..because of your Hardware Acceleration..the PC can't handle the needs of the programs and hardware..its time to drop some things.. Like a Digital Sound Card(return)to your Integrated Sound Card..
Remove Video Software..your PC is obsolete for VIDEO..and even DVD-ROM..if you had upgraded to DVD-ROM..you might want to put the CR-ROM and CDRW back in the machine.. ..
This was a solution to some of my problems.. My DELL Dimension 2350 was upgraded to a newer Motherboard and Processor and faster RAM..
But I purchased a DELL 1100-series DE051..that had numorious problems because of Hardware Acceleration-due to the DVD Drives..and VIDEO applications..also DELL delivered a machine with the wrong RAM Module..once that was replaced/I pulled the Drives and used the old Dimension CD Drives and used the DE051 DVD Drives in the Upgraded 2350..in the DE051 I dropped the Hardware Acceleration-one notch..viola'..one spectacular Internet PC.. ..
If your DELL Dimension 2350 is all original..I can almost assure you its obsolete..but would suggest you just slow down on Shut-Downs..let your DESKTOP---darken..and then CLICK---Turn OFF.
