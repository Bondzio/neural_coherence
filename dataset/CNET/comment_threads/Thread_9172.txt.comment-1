I've hardly used used SCSI for years but I've kept a beige G3 attached to a scanner via SCSI under System 9.0x, just for the odd bit of scanning we do.
The G3 video card seems to have crapped out, so my first thought was to attach the scanner to a G4 that still has a SCSI card.
But the G4 is now running 10.4 and no longer recognises the SCSI card.
(It doesn't show up in the system profile at all.)
Sorry, I don't know the make of the SCSI card.
I've found a driver/application from VueScan that should get the scanner working.
If I can get the SCSI card working, I should be home and dry.
