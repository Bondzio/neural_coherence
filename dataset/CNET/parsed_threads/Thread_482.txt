<s> A very petite lady friend of mine (4' 10&quot;) is studying to be a medical transcriptionist, but is finding that conventional keyboards require her fingers to stray from the home position a lot. </s>
<s> This prevents her getting up to speed and might well lead to repetitive stress injuries down the road, I'm told. </s>
<s> Is there a keyboard available that isn't a toy that is made for smaller-than-average persons? </s>
<s> It would need to be pretty much a standard keyboard, but with reduced key size and/or spacing - number pad optional. </s>
<s> I'm presently looking at the 83-key Low Profile Mini Keyboard sold by Ergonomic Resources, but I don't know who actually makes it. </s>
<s> Can someone give us advice? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> There are many Chinese manufacturers out there. </s>
<s> Just asking if this is required to buy the keyboard. </s>
<s> I use a few 83 key mini keyboards for servers and at booths to save space. </s>
<s> After picking up one I found more for 20 bucks at game sellers. </s>
<s> It's the one they sell for the PS2 that connects with USB. </s>
<s> While they don't tell you it works with a PC, it does and at under 20 bucks not a big investment. </s>

<s> I'm not a gamer, so I've never heard of this. </s>
<s> Is it a brand name/model? </s>
<s> Chinese characters aren't required here, just plain old European. </s>
<s> Is this sort of thing available at Circuit City, CompUSA and the like? </s>
<s> Thanks - Terry </s>
<s> You asked for the maker and that's what's on one here. </s>
<s> The keyboard has English key tops. </s>
<s> The unit may have been boxed as a PS2 USB Keyboard which had some other name such as KingMax on it. </s>
<s> All this confuses the issues here since it's a generic product with many suppliers and in many packages. </s>
<s> Let me ask if the maker is a needed piece of information to purchase such a keyboard? </s>
<s> I picked these up at EBGames, Best Buy but don't venture to Circuit City so I can't answer that. </s>
