Hey thanks for the suggestion.
I am at work now and I was thinking of the same thing myself.
My biggest problem is the fact that I can't get the cmos to recognize the drive.
I am installing Windows XP Home.
Can I use a Windows 98 SE start up disk to fdisk the drive after I get the drive recognized?
Or will the cd rom be automatically recognized to fdisk the drive.
Thanks again for the help.
