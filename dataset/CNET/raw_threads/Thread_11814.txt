I have seen tutorials where there is one blue plug in which I am assuming is the basic port for monitors. I would be able to have that if I didn't have 2 DVI ports. Will it still work if it has 2 DVI ports? Also, when I right-click on my desktop and go to properties and then the settings tab, it doesn't allow me to pick the choice of having two monitors. My computer is 2 years old and I would be very surprised if it does not support it. Any suggestions??
