<s> Hi myWD800BB-22JHAO just stopped working one day.It came pre-installed in my Gateway pc.It's only one year old.I bought a new HD&quot; WD800JB-00JJAO&quot; & swapped the pcb.It spun up,& showed in bios but I can't see or access it.It shows in device Mgr. </s>
<s> but not in disk management.Its an 80gb HD but in device manager it shows up as &quot;WDC ROM MODEL--SABRE--..7.87 gb&quot;.In bios It shows as&quot; WDC ROM MODEL--SABRE--..80gb&quot; Im a total newbie so I am confused .All I want is the data back.All Gateway & western digital will do is replace the drive.I could careless about the hard drive I just want my pictures & music back.So i have a few questions for any one who may know how I can fix this.I would definately send it to a data recovery company if I had the money ,but Im a student W/o a lot of money & can't afford it. </s>
<s> So my questions are ,is there a way I can access the drive by just finding a similar pcb? </s>
<s> Or am I going to have to find the same or similar pcb & swap & solder a chip from the donor to the dead pcb board? </s>
<s> and last,I was looking @ something called cloning the broken pcb's ROM ?There is a guy on E-bay that claims it will work &quot;Dariusale HDD solutions&quot;I would appreciate any info on this topic Thank You for your time & Patience I'm @ a loss b/c there were no signs or problems b4 it went kaput, no odd sounds,beeps ,or clicking. </s>
<s> I ran a diagnostic program(ontrack easy recovery) 2 try & get the data out (w/ the good pcb ) It spun up smoothly seemed perfect but ,failed the test saying it couldn't go thru w/ the test b/c of bad or errors or sectors or something 2 that effect.. Hopefully you can enlighten me . </s>

<s> Move to DRIVE SAVERS (google.com) since they have the expertise to get this done. </s>

<s> I didn't replace the PCB yet. </s>
<s> I hope to.If I can find a match.& I did call DriveSavers & even W/ a 10% discount It would still cost from 1200-2400 just to swap out the PCB. </s>
<s> What is cloning a boards ROM ? </s>
<s> Is this a real thing? </s>
<s> There is a guy in canada who says he can do this esp. </s>
<s> w/ WD drives & he has an E-bay store called ''Dariusale HDD solutions''.Im a total newbie so forgive my ignorance,but is it really possible to clone a PCB's ROM? </s>
<s> Hi, look at this link and see if it will help. </s>

<s> Don't take this hard but if you ask this question, you won't be doing this very soon. </s>
<s> Besides the equipment to do so can run past 4 figures. </s>
<s> As to finding the PCB, I re-read your first post and you seem to claim you already did this. </s>
<s> If not then you get on google.com and search for who sells said drive, or on ebay. </s>
<s> You might even buy a complete machine that has the drive. </s>
<s> You do the search... As to ebay data recovery. </s>
<s> I wouldn't do that. </s>
<s> I'd stick with the names such as Drive Savers or Ontrack. </s>
<s> Best of luck, Bob </s>
