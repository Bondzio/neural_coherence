I get alot of lag when downloading even 2 bit torrents at once... like ALOT! I would like to be able to download 3 or 4 at the same time and be able to multitask and use other programs on my computer without the lag. I know its not my internet connection, speedtest.net says Im at 30mb per second. If I get a computer with a Intel Core? i3-550 Processor (4M Cache, 3.20 GHz) and 4GB of RAM, will there be much lag when multitasking while downloading 3 or 4 torrents at once?

Most lag is due to the APP and not the CPU for the tasks you are asking about. Then again, the number of times I find malware on torrent user machines is not funny. Bob
