I don't know if this combination is possible, but our office is looking for a multifunction printer with duplexing, network scanning and copying but is also somewhat compact, or at least with a small footprint.
We were using a Laserjet 4100 that fit well in the area available, but it simply wasn't capable of the amount of output we need.
For me, price is less of an obstacle than size and reliability are.
Any suggestions?
