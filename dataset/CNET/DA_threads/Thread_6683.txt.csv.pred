1.1.1	I am planning to replace my cd-rw drive with a dvd-rw drive.	St
1.1.2	I have performed some minor work inside a machine such as adding memory, replacing a modem, etc.	St
1.1.3	Do you think a amateur like me would have a problem with replacing this drive?	St
1.1.4	Also, is there a website where I could get some detailed instructions on doing this?	St
1.1.5	Another stupid question: what is &quot;firmware&quot; and why does it need to be upgraded??	St
1.1.6	Virgil Hummel	St
1.2.1	1.	St
1.2.2	The drive comes with instructions.	St
1.2.3	But here's a pictorial on the steps -&gt; http://www.pcnineoneone.com/howto/cdts1.html 2. what is &quot;firmware&quot; Google answers that one well -&gt; http://www.google.com/search?&q=what+is+firmware 3. and why does it need to be upgraded??	St
1.2.4	In the manufactures mad rush to get product in production they will use buggy firmware, produce the boatload of drives and place them on the ship for your consumption.	St
1.2.5	Along the way, the bug is uncovered and the programmer is fed more coca-cola and chocolate bars until the firmware with the fix appears on the makers web site.	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	FIRMWARE= any chip(s) that can be &quot;reprogramed&quot; thus updated As for theCD drives, de-install your current one and then reboot, when down shutdown.	St
1.3.2	Now remove old drive and install new one.	St
1.3.3	If new drive has an install guide or similar follow it or get one from its own support website(do that before install and print it).	St
1.3.4	About the only cavet is use the 80-connector cable for best performance, re-using the old CD cable may(not) be OK, in most it is but again the help guide should point that out, also it does matter if it is the same type of cable.	St
