Won't the 200Mhz fans work?
Find some typical fans than have 3-ear mounting brackets.
Aren't there any used outlets in your area?
Here's a outlet center than may help or not: http://www.allelectronics.com/ -OR- similar websites, used, off-lease returns, etc.
Also, check with modding websites that custom fit all sorts of items.
Query there and maybe follow-up on some links they provides.
