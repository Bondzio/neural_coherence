That's a little clearer.
Here's what I see happen daily.
People format a drive and install &quot;Windows&quot;.
What they didn't know is that drivers for the MOTHERBOARD, USB and other items are not installed for them or don't exist on the Microsoft CD.
It's become a bad problem in that years ago we were expected to know this.
Today, newer owners are handed working machines and not instructed on how to install an OS.
