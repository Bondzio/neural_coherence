hello, if you are talking about a desktop, then yes, you can buy it with the integrated graphics card, and then add a dedicated graphics card to it later.
if you are talking about a laptop, then no, you cannot, and you will be stuck with what you have for graphics.
also, it is a hard call as to what you should do.
i have laptops with both, one with integrated graphics, and one with dedicated graphics.
personally, it doesn't really matter to me because i'm not a gamer either.
but i have tried playing some latest games on my laptop with the integrated graphics, and they played fine for me.
but a true gamer might notice the difference.
my advice to you is since you are on a budget, go ahead and get the one with the integrated graphics.
computers and their components are changing all the time.
you would be just fine with this type of graphics.
but a serious gamer will tell you differently, and they will be right, too.
we are both right with what we tell you.
but whatever you do decide, and if you are buying a laptop, make sure that it uses intel processors.
amd processors in laptops, especially hp's, have a long and sorbid history of running way hot and damaging the other components, and eventually burning up the computer.
i will never own a computer of any kind with amd processors.
i almost made the mistake and bought an hp tablet that had amd processors.
i notice it got incredibly hot, and so i ran a tester and checked its cpu and gpu temp, and the procesors were running at 80 to 110 degrees celcius.
i immediately took the laptop back, and i just went online and bought one with intel processor.
i have never been anymore happier.
but back to your question: i think you would be fine with a laptop with integrated graphics.
but it hasd to be your decision, so make sure you make the right one for you, because with a laptop, you are stuck with whatever graphics card you get.
