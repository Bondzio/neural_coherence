<s> Hey, I have a dell computer...bottom of the line, we wont even mention it, but anyway...the HDD is only 40GB and well, that isnt that much room. </s>
<s> I went in to disk management and it says there are 2 partitions on my HDD. </s>
<s> One is my normal C: drive which has 34GB, and there are only 5 left haha. </s>
<s> The other is 3GB FAT32 partition and it even says in parenthesis unknown partition. </s>
<s> Is this safe to delete? </s>
<s> that partition contains the restoral files for the computer. </s>
<s> delete if you want to but you'll never be able to restore the pc in case of a failure. </s>
<s> it seems to me u don't know what fat32 is. </s>
<s> i think wikipedia.org will explain it better than i'll do. </s>
<s> maybe after that u'll understand meaning and purpose of it and will change ur mind. </s>
<s> Anyway , if any questions arise do not hesitate to ask. </s>
<s> regards </s>
<s> actually my HDD is just formatted all in NTFS. </s>
<s> I'm not using FAT32 for anything at all except backup files. </s>
<s> And there's no point in deleting my backup files now because I can't exactly merge the 2 partitions. </s>
<s> What is the model number of your Dell computer? </s>
<s> Did the computer come from Dell with the FAT32 partition? </s>
<s> Have you confirmed whether that partition is a restore partition? </s>
<s> A hard disk that full will lower overall system performance. </s>
<s> That is why it may be a good idea to purchase a larger HD. </s>
<s> If you don't want a new one, I would backup all important files to CD/DVD (or whatever external storage you have) and perform a fresh installation of Windows XP. </s>
<s> During the installation, you will have the option to remove all partitions. </s>
<s> Create one partition and install Windows XP. </s>
<s> Mission accomplished. </s>
<s> Do you have the Dell Windows XP restoration CD? </s>
<s> Do you have the Dell driver CD? </s>
<s> You need these discs. </s>
<s> I dont wanna reformat and whatnot. </s>
<s> So, for now I can't really do much, I have cleared up some space though. </s>
<s> One of these days I will grab a new HDD, but that requires money haha. </s>
<s> Maybe I'm confused here. </s>
<s> What is it that you want to do? </s>
<s> If you want to resize or delete a partition, that will always run the risk of damaging the OS installation; and if damaged, it is likely you will need to reinstall EVERYTHING. </s>
<s> If you want to pay money to resize/delete the partition, Partition Magic will do it. </s>
<s> Otherwise, removing the second partition by using the Windows XP CD is free, but you will have to reinstall the OS, drivers, all programs, and personal files. </s>
