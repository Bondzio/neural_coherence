here is a link to a forum about this process.
also included some other links to look for parts.
here are some parts resellers.
here are a few links for product info.
try to buy only &quot;retail&quot; parts and no &quot;oem&quot; parts.
most &quot;oem&quot; parts have firmware and/or drivers made for there designed systems.
also &quot;oem&quot; parts come with no paperwork.
hope this helps...
