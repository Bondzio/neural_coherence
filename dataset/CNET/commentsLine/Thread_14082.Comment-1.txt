i have an external drive which i bought with a notebook 8 years ago; connects via ieee-1394 and worked great for many years.
last year i bought a new pc with xp.
it had no ieee ports, so i bought and installed a card.
worked great for getting all the old stuff into the new pc.
since the new pc has lots of space, i put away the ext.
drive for several months after the new machine was set up.
now i have a use for the ext.
drive again, but xp will no longer recognize it.
i even ran the &quot;helper cd&quot; and tried restarting with the drive on, have tried all the ports, and nothing -- xp cannot or will not find or detect the ext.
drive.
what happened?
is there any trick i can try in order to be able to use the ext.
drive again?
also, is there such a thing as a simple and reliable ieee-1394/usb adapter?
