Going on to a DFI LanParty UT nF3 250Gb motherboard - and I have a choice of two Athlon 64 3400+ CPUs: ADA3400AEP4AX LBAZC 0510APMW or ADA3400AEP4AR CAA2C 0531EPMW From the best info I was able to find - I think the AR is a Clawhammer (it is also the newer chip), and the AX is a Newcastle. (but I don't know this for sure) I am not a big OCer, but if I want to, I would like to have that ability, that is why I choose this particular m-board, and the lead question for picking one of these two CPUs. I will be running XP-Pro (SP2) TYIA for any and all assistance - Dam j

Supsect dual cores will also drop when the AM2 hit retailers too. For the info...the AMD site should give you the info you need. VAPCMD

Besides this is a socket 754 board, so ''Dual Core'' chips will not be of help to me. Do you (or anyone else) know of a reason one of these CPUs should be favored over the other? Thanks again for your attention - Dam j
13226	3	173125	1909373	1908198	ramarc	5/1/06 6:51 AM	1.14646626E12	both are more/less identical	same cache (512KB), same operating freq (2.2ghz). the AR is the newer rev. if you could find a 3400+ with ADA3400AEP5AR or ADA3400AEP5AP OPNs they would be better for OC'ing since they have 1MB cache and a 2.0ghz op freq (more headroom). http://www.thedigerati.us/info/amdcpuchart.html
13226	4	173125	1910951	1909373	Damian_J	5/1/06 10:32 PM	1.14652272E12	&quot;Headroom&quot;	Thanks ''ramarc'' for taking the time to post, and the terrific info site for AMD CPUs... I've looked for something like this for quite some time. I already have these two #4 chips, but if I had a 1GB cache chip, that's the one I'd be using alright. You're correct - the AR chip is about 5 months newer, but it also opperates at 2200MHz x11, while the ''Newcastle'' is 2400MHz x12 - So like you pointed out in your post - ''Headroom'' looks like the deciding factor. Sure wish I knew more about reading the ''Stepping'' codes. Thank you again for your help - Dam j
