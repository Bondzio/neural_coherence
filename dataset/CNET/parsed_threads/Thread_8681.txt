<s> Hi, I'd wait a little while if you want cutting edge, A new slot, PCI Express, is coming out which I understand is going to replace AGP 8x. </s>
<s> That would be a good time to upgrade to a Athlon 64, too. </s>
<s> Personally I don't think you need a new sound card, but I'm sure you have you're reasons Ciao </s>
<s> I don't see any reason why your computer won't run your new sound card. </s>
<s> My question is, why do you need a new sound card? </s>
<s> I too am curious a about the sound card but if U decide to sell your currenrt PC in 6 months let me know. </s>
