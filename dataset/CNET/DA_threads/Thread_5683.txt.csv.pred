1.1.1	For some reason as soon my roommate installed his Roku box I have been having IP conflicts on my laptop, and my laptop alone.	St
1.1.2	I cant figure out how to get them to work together, even after releasing and renewing my ip.	St
1.1.3	I have also made sure that my DHCP is enabled.	St
1.1.4	I am running two routers- one that has a modded DD-WRT, but I dont think thats an issue.. Any ideas?	St
1.2.1	Which OS and did you move to at least WPA?	St
1.3.1	I also see errors in the event log in admin tools.	St
1.3.2	Event 1001- your cpu was not assigned an address by the dhcp server.	St
1.3.3	Do I need to have dhcp activated?	St
1.3.4	Why am I the only one with the problem?	St
1.3.5	Shouldn't messing with my router settings affect all?	St
1.3.6	Ths prob is unfixible.	St
1.3.7	I also don't know what wps is...s	St
1.4.1	No the problem will not affect all.	St
1.4.2	It will only hit the ones with the IP that the roku was handed out.	St
1.4.3	You wonder if someone tried to manually set the numbers in the roku.	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	After disconnecting it, I still had no luck!	St
1.5.2	Is there a way to check the roku settings?	St
1.5.3	it just shows me the IP address listed.	St
1.5.4	Doesn't give me any wireless options.. How do i make it so i stop getting this darn error!	Ques
1.6.1	I often change the SSID of the router.	St
1.6.2	This forces new IPs to be handed out.	St
1.6.3	Then again if someone has hand assigned IP numbers and used one that is in the DHCP range, they created a problem.	St
1.6.4	Fix?	St
1.6.5	Don't do that!	St
1.6.6	I wonder about your ROKU.	St
1.6.7	I can not check mine today.	St
1.6.8	I just moved and I have my ROKU remote but we haven't found the roku unit.	St
1.6.9	I'm left to guess you have not explored all menus.	St
1.6.10	As to the laptop, changing the SSID should help.	St
1.6.11	If not, the OS may have been damaged by malware or registry cleaners.	St
1.6.12	-&gt; I asked for which Windows OS and can't find an answer.	St
1.6.13	This severely limits me since I can not write tcpip resets for all 5 versions.	St
1.6.14	Bob	St
1.7.1	running Windows XP.	St
1.7.2	I will try the SSID switch...	Sug
1.7.3	Doubt it will work... Just dont understand why its just MY computer having problems...	St
1.7.4	Especially since nobody has a fixed IP - nobody in my apartment knows how to mess with that stuff... Any help would be greatly appreciated	St

1.9.1	About an IP conflict and now you write it freezes.	St
1.9.2	That's two different issues unless you meant something else.	St
1.9.3	Review http://www.troublefixers.com/fixed-there-is-an-ip-address-conflict-with-another-system-on-the-network/ and then consider changing the DHCP range in the router.	St
1.9.4	Now that I know .14 is conflicting, we can change the DHCP range to .100 to .200 -&gt; As you are running a modded DD-WRT I have to think this would be trivial for you.	St
1.9.5	If not, supply a link to your modded DD-WRT's manual so I can find the config screen.	St
