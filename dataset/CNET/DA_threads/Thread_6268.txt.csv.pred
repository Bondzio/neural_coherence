1.10.1	It was a new drive that came with software and some autorun function to configure the drive.	St
1.10.2	I wanted no part of that so I wiped, repartitioned and formatted the drive.	St
1.10.3	After that I was experiencing symptoms similar to what you write.	St
1.10.4	I used google to research this and found that I needed something from that original software to prevent the timeout and spin down of the drive.	St

1.10.9	Once done, I uninstalled the software and the drive behaves as I wish.	St
1.10.10	By &quot;spinning down&quot;, I just mean it enters a power save mode by parking the heads and shutting down the motor.	St

1.10.12	Windows seems to want to periodically access all drives and perhaps grows impatient waiting for one to return to a ready state.	St
