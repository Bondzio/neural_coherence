<s> MDD Dual 867MHz CPU Overheating I have noted the large number of problems with this particular model and heat issues, but I just received this stripped MDD to do an upgrade on the cheap for my B&W G3 server. </s>
<s> In hindsight this might not have been the best unit to upgrade with, but for $72 on ebay (seller was unsure it was dual processor--which may have helped lack of bidding), I figured it was worth it. </s>
<s> After putting RAM to 2GB, putting in an ATI 9200 PCI graphics card, and inserting my HDs from the B&W with updated Tiger installed, everything booted fine with no problems. </s>
<s> Dual processors checked out, RAM was fine, and all drives loaded without glitch. </s>
<s> Next go round, after 20-30 minutes it does the sleep/freeze thing everyone has mentioned here and elsewhere. </s>
<s> All fans work and have tested with door open and high speed fan directly over heat sink and it still shuts down. </s>
<s> Temperature Monitor has it rising above 80c and climbing, which I no longer let go until &quot;closing&quot; to avoid any more damage. </s>
<s> The weird thing about this is that during all of this, the aluminum heat sink remains relatively cool, as if it is not making any contact. </s>
<s> Is it possible it just needs a pad or compound to make contact and dissipate the heat through the sink etc., or does this sound like either a faulty sensor or failing CPU? </s>
<s> The compound would be an easy fix (and it sounds logical), but I may just be missing the obvious here. </s>
<s> My hope is that the prior owner just did not bother to find out why it did this and cannibalized the unit. </s>
<s> I could take out all the drives, etc. </s>
<s> to reduce the heat build up, but I want this to function as a feasible house server that can be left on most of the time + because of the cool heat sink the behavior does not seem to relate to the heat in the housing. </s>
<s> Any and all help will be most welcome. </s>
<s> Why wasn't that done? </s>
<s> As to cooling the beast, you may want to entertain fans, etc. </s>
<s> I wanted to get some feedback before I started ripping off heat sinks and potentially damaging the processors--since this will be my first dig into a motherboard beyond RAM and PCI cards. </s>
<s> I am inclined to do this, but I wanted some confirmation first. </s>
<s> From your reply, I assume you feel this is a likely culprit. </s>
<s> Does the fact that it still boots etc. </s>
<s> prior to overheating hint that the processors are feasibly still good? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> I've yet to damage a CPU but I never &quot;rip&quot; off the heatsink. </s>
<s> It's always gentle coaxing and kind words of persuasion. </s>
<s> If you are still in fear then try the old leave the cover off and point a small fan at the box solution. </s>

<s> and it did nothing to abate the overheating. </s>
<s> It is as if the heat sink has no contact point. </s>
<s> Do you mean leave the heat sink off entirely? </s>
<s> I assume the compound (or pad?) </s>
<s> is the route to go next, but my fear is in applying the compound incorrectly. </s>
<s> But at this point, I have a 30 minute machine, so I need to do something. </s>
<s> The method is exactly the same for every situation I've encountered. </s>
<s> Type APPLYING HEATSINK COMPOUND GUIDE at google and enjoy. </s>
<s> I bit the bullet, went to Radio Shack and got Arctic Silver 5 compound, cleaned off the heat sink and processors with a credit card and alcohol as suggested on their site, screwed everything down, kept the door open with a fan pointed right at the heat sink, turned on and prayed. </s>
<s> With the door open and fan on, I am maintaining a 50.5-51.4C temp. </s>
<s> When I close up and let the original (and annoyingly erratic) fan do the work, it maintains between 59.5 to 60.5C. </s>
<s> This suggests I need a better fan, but I guess the old paste was just preventing any heat from conducting through to the sink. </s>
<s> Thanks for building up my confidence to actually &quot;touch&quot; the processor. </s>
<s> Hopefully I am not too fearless now and avoid cracking open my laptop </s>
<s> If I remember the fans are standard size and voltage but I can't guarantee that. </s>
<s> I find fans on newegg.com.. </s>
<s> With the addition of the ATI 9200 PCI graphics card, you need to upgrade your Power supply to a 300 watt unit. </s>
<s> That will solve the problems of the overheating. </s>
