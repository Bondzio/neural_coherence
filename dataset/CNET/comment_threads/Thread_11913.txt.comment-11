The psu is a &quot;switching power supply&quot;, the load is simply the mtrbd.
attached.
If you test with no mtrbd.
or no load attached, the psu isn't capable to turn-ON.
I usggested an ATX type tester as it's safe to use.
There is a trick, but I won't do that for a novice, safety issue IMHO.
But google for such if you like, up to you.
