Hi: I have purchased a Webcam (Model No &quot;SN9C103&quot; make Tevion) in last year.
This Webcam was working perfectly fine with Windows XP operating system loaded on my old laptop.
I changed my laptop, which has &quot;Windows Vista&quot; pre-loaded on it.
Now I am trying to install this Webcam on the new laptop and it is not getting installed.
During installation, I am getting a message &quot;Not enough storage is available to complete this operation&quot;.
Can anybody help in installing this Webcam?
Warm Regards Chandrashekhar S. Joshi
