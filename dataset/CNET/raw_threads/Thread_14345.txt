3631	0	139414	1566133	NR	jan247	11/27/05 8:28 PM	1.13312328E12	No perfect multifunction	Canon MP800/950 - seems to offer excellent quality but no ADF, fax MP780 - excellent set of features but outdated HP 7210/7310/7410 - inks are too expensive Others - so-so quality Will there be an updated version of the canon mp780: a business-like multifunction with photo quality prints? I really want ADF, if only the MP800/MP950 has that feature, or an add-on that can fix that. I already have a Canon ip4000 and since the MP780 is built around that printer, it doesn't actually qualify as an upgrade.

The ip4000 and mp780 have the same printhead and carts so you can be assured that you can interchange them. 2. The MP780 is excellent in text and photos and solid in graphics. The MP800/MP950 is not much better, maybe faster. It does look sleeker. 3. The MP800 has the new nazi carts which means high quality carts from http://www.swiftink.com can't be used. You can still refill but it's turns off the low ink warning and writes a notice to the memory. Also voids the warranty even though this is illegal in the USA. 4. The MP780 has ADF and fax and cost less money, $200 on sale at OfficeMax and: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16828102161R http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16828102161 I would snag the MP780 it's the last of the V8.

And since I'm hunting for a multifunction, it'd better have an ADF, or better yet, and ADF + fax. I just wish canon release a new multif. with an ADF...

I'm only guessing though and the MP950 is already listed at $449 so I would hate to see how much a MP980 model would be. I can't imagine Canon wants their flagship to be the MP780 for very long. http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ProductCatIndexAct&fcategoryid=103 Keep a watch on their site for the MP980.
