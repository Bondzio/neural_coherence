1.ok 2.i wasn't supplied any software with it big mistake.
what many find out is they get laughable support on bare drives.
if it was mine, i'd make sure the firmware is uptodate and see if dvdshrink works with it.
3.how do i disable the imapi and what does this do?
i do not hold hands.
you would type xp imapi into google.com 4.not installed sp2 as i believe at the moment it causes more problems than it cures your choice.
and this may sound bad, but i move quickly to update all drivers, firmware and the os so i know i'm stable.
you haven't.
you picked up a bare drive and that means you are an expert or have great support systems.
i've shared what i would do and you have to decide what to do next.
let me be blunt.
you may eventually find out what's wrong, but without latest firmware, drivers and sp2, i leave you to figure it out.
cheers, bob
