there's never gonna be an ideal air cooled system, whichever way you look at it as long as air is circulating (even round and round in a circle) it's cooler like running water doesn't freeze as easily as still water (remember physics lessons at school).
the best solution is liquid cooling but sorry to say expensive.
if you really want to see how the air in your case is moved around, take off the side panel and hold a lit cigarette inside and watch where the smoke goes or use some kind of smoking device.
or the extremem, extreme solution is submerge the whole case in light oil like the oil used to cook with(have you seen the video where this is done?)
oil doesn't conduct electricity so all components work fine without any fans and its noise free but maybe a little messy.
