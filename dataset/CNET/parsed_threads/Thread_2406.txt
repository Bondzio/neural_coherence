<s> I have a home and shop LAN using a Netgear WGR614v4 router. </s>
<s> (Home and shop are two buildings adjacent to each other and both hardwired and wireless.) </s>
<s> There are currently four PC's on the local area network and one is a server for my CCTV setup using Integral Technologies Master Control software and MSSQL as the server and RemoteView client on my laptop. </s>
<s> When connected to the LAN everything works fine but when I try to connect remotely over the internet from a different location I can't connect or ping the server. </s>
<s> I've set the IP in the server to static using the DNS provided by SBC. </s>
<s> The client software is setup with the same server IP address. </s>
<s> The router Port Forwarding is setup with the server IP and software manufacture assigned ports. </s>
<s> The Port triggering is setup with the same port assignments. </s>
<s> The WAN Setup has the DMZ set with the server IP also. </s>
<s> The SBC DHCP is PPPoE and dynamically assigns the Interne IP address when power is cycled to the router. </s>
<s> My question is if the router is setup correctly (and if anyone knows about Netgear please feel free to jump in) one - do I need a static Internet IP address assigned by SBC, two - is there anything that SBC has to do on their end to make the remote internet connection work and three - does the Internet IP have to be set in the router as well and if so where? </s>
<s> Or you have a firewall up. </s>
<s> But I can't tell what's wrong since you didn't supply any IP PLAN for me to look over. </s>
<s> Since many will not tell such the discussion dies instantly and the poster is left to call in onsite help. </s>
<s> Next time, reveal the firewall settings a bit of the IP PLAN and forget port triggers. </s>
<s> Just port forward. </s>
<s> And again, you didn't tell what ports you forwarded. </s>
<s> All you didn't tell... matters. </s>
