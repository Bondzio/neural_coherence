1.1.1	Hi , I ca n't seem to access the Net when transferring large files between my desktop ( WinXP SP3 , 100Mbps net card ) and my laptop ( Win7 , 54Mbps WiFi ) .	St
1.1.2	I have an EDIMAX BR-6228nC 150 Mbps broadband router to which my desktop is wired and the laptop connects through WiFi .	St
1.1.3	The speeds never go above 2.5MBps , so there should be plenty of bandwidth left for Internet use .	St
1.1.4	My router config confirms that there 's no Internet connection while transferring the files .	St
1.1.5	Can anyone please help me with this ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	I had a similar problem when transferring large files , but I would lose all connectivity and the router would reset itself .	St
1.2.2	I tried every possible solution before giving up and buying a different make/model router .	St
1.2.3	I have n't had a problem since then .	St
1.2.4	Does the router have the latest firmware installed ?	Ques
1.2.5	Have you tried a factory reset ?	Ques
1.2.6	Do you have the same problem when both computers are wired to the router ?	Ques
1.3.1	Since I do n't have the full picture of router and more settings I suggest you try router and such defaults FIRST along with a channel check .	St
1.3.2	What 's that ?	Ques
1.3.3	Read this recent discussion .	St
