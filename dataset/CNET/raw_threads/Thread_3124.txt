I was just wondering if this 9800 gtx ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814133220 ) would be able to stand up to it? Does anyone know when HD 4870's will be shipping again.

I've read internet claims that people have the HD4870 already in-hand, but I remember reading that supplies will be limited for at least the next couple weeks. I've only seen the HD4850 myself (at local Best Buy for $199).
