Try what is in the manual on page 73 or Appendix H. If you do not have the manual, you can download it at: http://file-us.abit.com.tw/pub/download/manual/english/as8_series.pdf If none of that works, I would remove all hardware (including all PCI cards), but the video card, memory, hard drive, keyboard, mouse, and 1 cd/dvd drive.
Not sure of the type of memory you have, but it must be dual channel type and installed in the correct slots.
See page 2-3 in manual.
Also want does the LED (U21) readout show?
See Appendix G in manual.
