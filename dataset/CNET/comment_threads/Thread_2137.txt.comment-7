If you're not a builder, and don't plan on building, DELL is not a bad choice.
I've had 5 and had good service.
I have just completed an E 6300 build.
1 Gig will be fine as long as you choose a very good Video Card with whatever system you choose.
Don't choose Intergrated Graphics as your option.
In my benchmark tests, I have found that onboard graphix will utilize a little too much RAM and elevated the CPU temperature with the C2D systems.
The 6600 is the sweet spot.
You won't be overclocking for two reasons: Intel and DELL.
Believe me, you won't need to overclock with a C2D.
