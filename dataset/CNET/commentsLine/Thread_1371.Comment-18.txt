i just today bought my t6212 package from circuit city - played with it in the store and it was much faster than the old 1ghz p3 laptop i've been using.
evryone on these forums says to upgrade, but i am confused as to what to get.
i bought some memory online:  but it was suspiciously half the price of the pc3200 they had at best buy, tho as far as i could tell it is the same product for half the price.
was this good memory to get?
i guess i need a video card too?
very hard to find recos - any thoughts as to what is the best to get for around $150-200?
plus, i need to hook it up to my wireless network - is pci card or usb best for this, and if so, which one?
thanks!
