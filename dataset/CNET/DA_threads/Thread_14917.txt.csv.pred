1.1.1	Hello, I am wanting to upgrade my video card from a nVidia 8300 GS 128 MB to a card that is good enough to play Half-Life 2 Episode 2 and above.	St
1.1.2	Left4Dead2 Demo did not play that well either.	St
1.1.3	I have a 300 watt power supply, and some claim that the Radeon 4650 , and 4670 will work?	St
1.1.4	I have had others claim that I need to get a (uhm.. crappy) 8500 GT nVidia ?	Ques
1.1.5	Then there are others that say I need to upgrade my power supply before I even think about getting any upgrades?	St
1.1.6	Any more ideas?	St
1.2.1	And it was too much for a 350 Watt supply so without doubt your card will not be happy with 300.	St

1.3.1	Should I try to get a nVidia 9400 GT?	St
1.3.2	nVidia's &quot;help me select&quot; said it was able to be used in a 300 watt.	St
1.4.1	I have the 9500 GT in PCI form and total Watts (I use a Watt meter) for the entire machine tops out at 120 WATTS.	St
1.4.2	I know that sounds confusing since some may hit the wrong button and read 120VAC but I know the diff.	St
1.4.3	The 9400 is not a screamer but the 8400 PCI card in a machine that had no PSU upgrade is running fine.	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
