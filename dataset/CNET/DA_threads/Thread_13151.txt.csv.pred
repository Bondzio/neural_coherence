1.1.1	I have a Toshiba Satellite U305 laptop w/ Vista .	St
1.1.2	I have n't had any major problems with viruses or major shut downs for the past 4 years I 've owned it , it 's been pretty dependable .	St
1.1.3	I purchased a WD Passport External HDD , 500 GB in March,2011 .	St
1.1.4	Oct '11 , out of nowhere , when I try to access the disk I get an I/O operating error and it shows as Local Disk H : , can not be accessed , can not be checked by antivirus software .	St
1.1.5	Same issue on other computers , tried uninstalling , tried the chkdsk f : , nada .	St
1.1.6	Friend tells it 's corrupt .	St
1.1.7	Purchase new 1 TB Toshiba Canvio Basics external HDD .	St
1.1.8	Used once to transfer files , no problems .	St
1.1.9	Second time , plug in , starts clicking .	St
1.1.10	File transfers become slow , then stop .	St
1.1.11	Computer shuts down , get blue screen of death .	St
1.1.12	Reboot , HDD shows as Local Disk H : , windows explorer freezes when I double click on the drive .	St
1.1.13	HDD starts screeching .	St
1.1.14	I know clicking and screeching are signs of actual hardware problems inside the HDD .	St
1.1.15	But , once again it shows as Local Disk , but does n't give the I/O operating error as the windows explorer keeps freezing .	St
1.1.16	Bad luck with HDDs , or could this be from my computer ?	Ques
1.1.17	Also , any suggestions on how to get data from my WD HDD ?	Ques
1.1.18	255 gb , lost !	St
1.1.19	I 'd also like to note I have never dropped either HDD and also remove the drives safely .	St
1.2.1	Were the drives on 24x7 ?	Ques
1.3.1	No , never .	St
1.3.2	I always safely removed the drives after using them .	St
1.4.1	Here 's what i find sometimes and it seems to occur as you stated , it works great for some time , then poof it does n't .	St
1.4.2	Generally speaking , the laptop itself is to blame .	St
1.4.3	USB ports on laptops are just not made for prolonged or demanding usage , especially with ext .	St
1.4.4	HD 's involved because they are the most power hungry .	St
1.4.5	They either weaken the power supplied or the electronics or path provided .	St
1.4.6	That basically means , it being & quot ; over-driven & quot ; and surcomes to physical damage and *may* in the process cause damage to the ext .	St
1.4.7	device .	St
1.4.8	I found this to happen to older cameras too .	St
1.4.9	Actually an older camera works OK , but the port does n't .	St
1.4.10	Since , you stated the ext .	St
1.4.11	HD does n't work elsewhere , you have a 2ndary problem .	St
1.4.12	The fix , is to replace the laptop mtrbd .	St
1.4.13	and proceed to use USB ext .	St
1.4.14	powered hub to isolate future issues .	St
1.4.15	If the problem happens , there is no easy end-user fix , the damage is done as explained .	St
1.4.16	If you want to retrieve the data , then place on another PC and see if it works .	St
1.4.17	If desktop , use direct USB port on mtrbd .	St
1.4.18	at rear or powered ext .	St
1.4.19	USB hub .	St
1.4.20	Still does n't work , it 's damaged .	St
1.4.21	You may then want to try to extract the HD inside and then use an adapter like a ADA-2020 or yet another ext .	St
1.4.22	USB case .	St
1.4.23	If the HD still does n't work , the HD is damaged or its PCB .	St
1.4.24	However , there maybe the chance to re-use the ext .	St
1.4.25	HD if reformatted .	St
1.4.26	I use HP USB format tool , practically works with any USB device .	St
1.4.27	tada -- -- -- Willy	St
1.5.1	I 'll try using the new , screeching one on another computer to see if I can access it .	St
1.5.2	Thanks for the advice !	St
