<s> I just recently got an ACER Aspire E380, and I noticed that the sytem makes a clicking noise almost as loud as an old type-writer. </s>
<s> I was wondering if anyone knew whether this is a system flaw or does there happen to be a setting to turn it off. </s>
<s> I'm more of a power user, but never encountered this type of issue before. </s>
<s> Any and all help would be awesome. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> A wire or cable has slid over and the fan was hitting it. </s>
<s> It was a snap to correct. </s>
<s> Have you opened it up to find it? </s>
