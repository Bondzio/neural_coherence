maybe i am just doing something slightly wrong, but i am trying to make it so that i can be on my laptop and print to the printer that is in my home office, and also have a shared folder that i can transfer files from my laptop over to onto my office pc.
here is my setup: -motorola cable modem which goes into a -linksys wrt54gs router from this point i have the office pc plugged into 1 port and a vonage phone adaptor plugged into another port.
i am able to get the internet access on both the office pc and on my laptop when i connect wirelessly.
i also have 2 printers connected to the office pc.
i figured it would as easy as choosign to share the printers from that machine, but i guess not.
do i need a print server?
do i need to send the cable modem into the comptuer first and then out to the router?
(i don't want to do this becasue i use the router for qos) i would also like to be able to share a folder on the office pc so that if i work on a document on the laptop i can just copy it over to that machine for storage because i also backup everything on the office pc to off-site storage.
any advice on my setup?
thanks tucker
