<s> Just received new laptop and router Connected router to desktop and says it was successful but when I try to connect laptop to desktop (for internet and sharing) the Home network has excellent signal but limited capability (no internet and no file sharing) and netgear network has poor signal so when connected it doesnt allow internet access The desktop is running xp and laptop is running vista--does this make a difference? </s>
