i have an airtel broadband connection in my 2 storey house .
.
but it is at ground floor ( i can run only 1 pc at a time ) .
.
so i wanted to intall a wireless connection over now( cos of laptop ) but i wanted it to be spread throughout the house .
.
intalling one router will cause problems due to concrete walls .
.
therefore i was considering if their was any way i could install a router on each floor so that their is no problem in future .
.
now i wanted to know whether it is possible through one connection ..
??
if yes then how .
.
if you have a better way plzz kindly let me know
