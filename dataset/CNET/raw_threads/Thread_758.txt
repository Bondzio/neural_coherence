I'm currently looking for a lasting budget computer with the power and video card that has the capability to play most games without major graphics/fps problems. Currently, the best choices I have seen were the Dell Dimension E530 and the Pavilion a1130e. Here are the main specs for customized versions of both: Pavilion a1130e Processor: Athlon 64 3400+ (2.2GHz) Memory: 1GB DDR-400MHz SDRAM (2x512) Graphics Card: NVIDIA GeForce 6200SE w/TurboCache 256MB support Price: $579 Dimension E530 Processor: Intel Pentium 4 630 w/HT Technology (3.0GHz) Memory: 1GB Dual Channel DDR2 SDRAM at 400MHz (4x256M) Graphics Card: 256MB PCI Express x16 (DVI/VGA/TV-out) ATI Radeon X600 SE HyperMemory Price: $671 I set other specs such as starter software and HD space/speed to the same on both systems, and I already have a moniter to use with whatever I choose, so the listed specs seem most relevant. Does anyone have an opinion as to which system is better, or have another option in the same price range (other than building a computer)?
