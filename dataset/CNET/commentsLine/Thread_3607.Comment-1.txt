ive just bought a new pc with windows xp installed on it, but i have another hardrive from my old computer also with windows xp on it, is there anyway i can get my old files to the new computer and then use the old hardrive as a secondary drive?
could i install the old hardrive as a secondary drive and boot up the edition of windows xp on there and just copy the files over??
any help would be great.
cheers
