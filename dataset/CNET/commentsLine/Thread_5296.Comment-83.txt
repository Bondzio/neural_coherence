well once you added in that you might want to play some graphics intensive games, the answer, is you will have to have a add-on video card.
there are several reason for this.
1)the integrated cards usually just don't have the necessary processing capability.
they may be able to handle hd video playback, decently, but that's about it.
2) the 256 meg shared memory is not enough, and also way too slow.
games now days often want 512 megs, or more.
this depends on resolution, and how good a detail you want.
also, you will probably want to play the games at the resolution that the lcd monitor is made to run at.
lcd's unlike crt's really only look good at 1 resolution.
it's called their native resolution.
you can make them run at lower sizes, but the results usually look blurry.
19&quot; wants to usually run at 1440x900, a 22&quot; wants to run at 1680x1050.
larger 24&quot; want 1920x1200.
built in video cards can't do that really at anything other than 10 fps if they are lucky, and that won't do for smooth game play.
you want 30-60 fps minimum.
also, the bandwidth of the ram is much higher on a discrete (add-in)video card.
for example, a 2 lane highway, vs a 5 or 7 lane.
you can see what can handle more traffic.
(data to and from the graphics processor.)
2) the power supply for machines like that are very minimal.
often 300 watts or so.
a decent video card will want maybe a 600 watt.
higher if you go with more powerful cards.
look for sli, or crossfire rated power supplies of 750 watt minimum if you go with a really powerful card.
this also gets you extra power connectors to connect directly to the video card.
(some require 2 now) by the way, this is also true for laptops.
lots of them are very cheap now days, and sound very fast.
don't be fooled by them.
they talk about their processor, and that is the lesser requirement for games.
i would take a core 2 duo processor laptop with a discrete video any day over a core i7 laptop with integrated video.
