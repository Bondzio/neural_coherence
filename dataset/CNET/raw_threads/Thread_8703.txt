I have been working on an album for the past year. I recently had some device i/o errors with my Western Digital MyBook Essential 500 GB when trying to access a couple of my song files. I figured since it was an i/o error it must be a problem with the enclosure. So I took out the hard drive (3.5&quot; SATA) and put it in a new enclosure. Now when i look at the folder with the song files, it shows that it is empty, size 0, size on disc 0, contains 0 folders. My other folders still have data, just not this one that I was accessing when the i/o errors started happening. Is my data gone forever? Is there a reliable data recovery program? I'm desperate and would truly appreciate any help. I signed up to cnet just for this. Thanks.

While I like GETDATABACK and ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY your story is one where I'd defer to http://www.drivesavers.com And where was the backup copy? Most of our stuff fits on a 1 dollar DVDR or even a 10 buck USB memory stick. Bob

This I/O error appears in many computers. I think you files should be recovered. To recover files, you may try another product Data Recovery Wizard, which is easy to use.
