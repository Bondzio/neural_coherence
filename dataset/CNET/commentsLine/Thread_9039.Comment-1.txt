plea from a digital artist.
is there anyway you could please, please, make it a point to include in the specs of new tablets if they have pressure sensitive pens.
sometimes its very hard to figure out what new tablets have this and what ones don't.
often it is buried in a review and given little acknowledgement.most times it doesn't show up in the &quot;spec&quot; sheets that are with reviews.
even better if you could tell us levels of pressure sensitivity, and who makes the tech for it (like samsung using wacom).
this info is very important for a digital artist looking into getting a tablet.
even a simple &quot;this tablet has a stylus, with 1024 levels of pressure, uses wacom technology and tablet has enough power for serious photoshop users&quot; you cant imagine how hard it is to find some of this info at times.
