<s> Hi, Does the Lite-On SHW-160P6SU EZ-DUB BURNER support Booktype / Bitsetting. </s>
<s> The software I use is CloneDvd and 1 Click Dvd Copy Pro. </s>
<s> The Media Tayo Yuden +R THANKS FOR THE HELP... </s>
<s> standalone dvd recorder but I never know what type or bitsetting are. </s>
<s> Why is that important? </s>
<s> that you are shopping around for the answer and have received a reply at CDFreaks. </s>
<s> Lite-on drives have been quite consistent with providing booktype support on their drives. </s>
<s> I would expect that this drive will also. </s>
<s> Play on older players. </s>
<s> That's a dead end which I've seen a few hundred by now chase after. </s>
<s> But in closing, it does booktype proper. </s>
