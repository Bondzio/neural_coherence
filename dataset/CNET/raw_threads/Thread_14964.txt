Is there a simple way of doing this? Please tell me how one can keep files private on a flash drive. Thanks, Ken

It does have a password protect feature. However, it also has a feature for surfing the web anonymously. It does not work. It only hides your cookies from a site. There are sites that will report to you what they can see from your computer. I tried that when using the U3 anonymous feature. The test site could still see everything, and could tell me where I had been surfing before coming to them. I then tested the history feature in my IE7, and it recorded all the sites I had visited while using the U3. So, yes, you can password protect, but the anonymous surfing feature is not functional.

Another possibility is to buy software at: http://www.folder-password-expert.com/ Maybe there is freeware that will do the same thing, but I haven't looked into this.

I found very poor support from lexar in trying to recover my data. They acted as though as they care less. The tech support person acted as though I disturbed either his sleep or his lunch. I don't know which. I hung up and called again and got the same response. I never recovered my data. I have not bought any lexar product since that incident. I take my chances in not having a secure flash but at least I feel that I won't loss my data to a failed password feature. Good luck.

I am sure newer pendrives like you mentioned U3 and others can do this as they have some inbuilt feature, but can this capability be added by use of a software preferably a freeware.
