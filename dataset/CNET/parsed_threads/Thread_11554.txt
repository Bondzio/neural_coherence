<s> I am a law student, and I happen to be living in an apartment across the street from the (wireless) law library. </s>
<s> I'm fully permitted to access this signal. </s>
<s> I have an HP laptop with internal wireless antennas. </s>
<s> I can kind of pick up the wireless signal standing in my parking lot, but once I'm inside my unit, it's completely gone. </s>
<s> Today, I went to CompUSA and bought the Hawking Hi-Gain USB Dish Adapter. </s>
<s> It works, but only so-so. </s>
<s> The signal I'm getting is weak, and I have to leave the dish hanging out of my window. </s>
<s> I can't use this permanently. </s>
<s> What kind of hardware do you guys recommend for me to get? </s>
<s> There has to be something more high-powered than the little desk-top dish that I bought. </s>
<s> I'm thinking along the lines of those big RV antennas because they can be left outside in rain, heat, and snow. </s>
<s> Is that overkill? </s>
<s> Is there a brand or a product you have experience with that you can recommend? </s>
<s> Thank you all for any advice you can give! </s>
