after all my ranting last week, i did get the problem solved by hp.
even if you are out of warranty, if your monitor meets the requirement shown on their web site you will get a replaement monitor shipped to you and materials for shipping your old one back to them.
i strongly disagree with their requiement that you give them a credit card number as collateral and really went to town on customer service but did finally give in and give it to them so i could get back up and running.
i was very pleasantly surprised when the new monitor arrived the next day and everything is now working.
i kept calling customer service until i actually got an agent i could understand and who spoke with me instead of reading from a script and putting me on hold - once for an hour.
i also e-mailed the ceo of hp and got two phone calls the next day from his consumer affairs deptartment.
keep at it.
it is a defective product and they know about it.
good luck.
