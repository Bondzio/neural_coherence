1.1.1	I was using my HP Pavillion 7955 and all of a sudden the screen went black .	St
1.1.2	I do n't think it is a power supply problem because the fan is still running and the monitor was plugged into another computer and it is working fine .	St
1.1.3	I think it is a problem with the video card .	St
1.1.4	I had some work done on the computer recently and the technician said that the video failed on boot up and he needed to re-seat the video card .	St
1.1.5	Does that mean that he pulled the video card out and then put it back in ?	Ques
1.1.6	Could this be the solution to the problem that I am experiencing ?	Ques
1.1.7	How do I prevent this from happening again in the future ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	& quot ; Does that mean that he pulled the video card out and then put it back in ? & quot ; While we ca n't tell , my guess is YES !	St
1.2.2	& quot ; Could this be the solution to the problem that I am experiencing ? & quot ; Yes .	Ques
1.2.3	& quot ; How do I prevent this from happening again in the future ? & quot ; The current design of your PC uses some connector , cards that slide into said connector and there 's a design limitation or flaw there .	St
1.2.4	To prevent it from happening , you would have to look over the area of the design and see if you can fix it without impacting cooling or other aspects of the design .	St
