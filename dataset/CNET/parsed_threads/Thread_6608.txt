<s> Wow....what a struggle with Linksys. </s>
<s> I have the WRT300N wireless router in my basement and I get a very weak signal upstairs on my laptops and XBox 360. </s>
<s> So I got online with the Linksys chat and they said I needed to purchase a WAP54G access point. </s>
<s> Got it home and could not get it to work, went back online in chat with Linksys and they said &quot;oh no Sir that is not compatible with your router&quot; and that I needed to purchase the WRE54G Range Expander. </s>
<s> Once I again I got back home with the new equipment, low and behold it would not work!!!. </s>
<s> For the 3rd time now I got back online with Linksys and spent about 1.5 hours chatting with somebody trying to get it to work.....NOTHING!! </s>
<s> and on top of that the person from Linksys I was chatting with suddenly gave up and would no longer talk to me. </s>
<s> The next day I decided that I would not go online but would call directly to the Linksys support. </s>
<s> After I gave them my name and info I explained to them my problem and the first thing they said is &quot;oh no Sir, the equipment you have is not compatible, BUT, I might be able to help you configure it so it will work.&quot; and this is how it went....!! </s>
<s> First of all the computer or laptop MUST be hardwired to the router. </s>
<s> Second, the WRE54G MUST also be hard wired to the router. </s>
<s> Then, reset the WRE54GN by pressing the reset button for at least 30 seconds. </s>
<s> (You probably get a blue and red steady light....that is fine). </s>
<s> Hopefully, if all goes right, this will allow you to now communicate with the WRE54G. </s>
<s> (Auto Configuration is not possible). </s>
<s> Now to test this: Go into your start menu and click on &quot;Run&quot; and type in the comannd &quot;CMD&quot;....This will give you a DOS prompt window. </s>
<s> Now type in &quot;Ping 192.168.1.240&quot; (this is the preset IP Address of the WRE54G.) </s>
<s> At this point you will get several lines of numbers and stuff...ignore everything except at the bottom where it say's &quot;Packets: Sent = 4, Recieved = 4, Lost = 0 &lt;0% loss&gt;. </s>
<s> If this is the case then you are looking good! </s>
<s> Now, open a web browser and type in 192.168.1.240 and wait for the Linksys page to come up from your WRE54G.....when/if this does come up then you have won the battle! </s>
<s> Next, and this is also VERY IMPORTANT. </s>
<s> In the configuration of your WRE54G the SSID MUST be the same as your router!!!! </s>
<s> Otherwise they will not communicate with each other. </s>
<s> Also the channels should be the same. </s>
<s> Now click on &quot;save setting&quot;, and it this time or shortly there after you should have 2 blue lights on your WRE54G. </s>
<s> At this time you can unplug it and place it anywhere in your house!!! </s>
<s> Please note: at the time of all this configuration my security on my router was disabled and later also on my expander. </s>
<s> My signal now upstairs is now &quot;Excellant&quot; and the signal is maxed out on my XBox 360.....Now I have to figure out how to enable my security and at the same time not loose connection to my WRE54G. </s>
<s> I hope this was of some help to somebody out there and I appologize for this being so lengthy..... Michael If you have any questions or helpful tips for me then please drop me a line..... mjdecker0922@yahoo.com Thanks! </s>
<s> Hi Santana0922; what if you try to disable the SSID broadcast in youor router? </s>
<s> at lease no one can connect unless he know the SSID. </s>
<s> Am I right ? </s>
<s> can you try it and feed us back please ? </s>
<s> Thanks for your effort. </s>
<s> Update the firmware in your Linksys router http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_CASupport_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1166859841746&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper&lid=4174637314B337 Broadcast SSID(Change the name this time to make connecting easier) Use WPA security mixed b and g mode, there may be some setting to also include n use channels 1, 6 or 11. </s>
<s> Devices work better on these channels. </s>
<s> Might I also suggest moving the router from the basement. </s>
<s> A basement os no place to get good reception. </s>
<s> Find a nice place in the middle of the house or an upper floor. </s>
<s> You'll be ok. Rick </s>
<s> There is no Linksys repeater for n wifi that I know of. </s>
<s> It is working with the g broadcast from your n router. </s>
<s> Just wanted to clear that up. </s>
<s> With WEP, do not use the installation wizard. </s>
<s> Simply follow the manual set up instructions in Chapter 6 in the manual. </s>
<s> No problem at all. </s>
<s> Ur instructions are like 100 times better than chatting with the online support who simply said: &quot;Sorry its not compatible&quot; It worked! </s>
<s> Basement is all wirelessly &quot;hooked&quot; up. </s>
<s> PS3!! </s>
<s> Whoooooo Thank you. </s>
