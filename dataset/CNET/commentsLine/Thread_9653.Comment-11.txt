hey folks.
i'm back.
i just logged on this morning and the wireless wouldn't connect.
it wouldn't even see the router sometimes.
then when it did it saw two of them.
i haven't changed a thing since it started working again.
right now i am plugged in and its working fine.
in all honesty could it be the router?
my girlfriend is having the same problem on her new e1505 running vista.
i'm pulling my hair out (what little i have).
thank you soo much for all your help.
you have been awesome!!
!
