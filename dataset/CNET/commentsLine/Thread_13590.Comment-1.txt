i have always had a habit of buying kingston memory (no particular reason), but i noticed that on newegg for instance, i can get 4gb of &quot;ocz gold&quot; for $250 whereas 4gb of kingston hyperx is $390.
the kingston also has a high latency of 9. basically, what am i missing about the price difference, since as far i can tell ocz is another great memory maker?
