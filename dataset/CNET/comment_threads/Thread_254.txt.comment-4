I've tried the degaussing already.
It didn't work.
I've tried adjusting the convergence, trapezoid, paralelogram and so on... Several times.
My girlfriend has Samsung SyncMaster 997MB.
It too has a ErgoFlat tech CRT.
I noticed it has the same distortion.
I guess that (distortion) is something any monitor with this tech has.
I'll try contacting Philips on this issue as well.
Thank You, Dejan
