thanks for your help.. i got the compusa usb 2.0 3.5 inch enclosure (the house brand), for $29.99.
everything snaps and fits well... after several attempts, when i finally gave up and unplugged the drive (in the new ecnlosure), it was very hot, don't know if it's normal or not... my main goal is to get my data out... when failing to detect, i followed the prompt, went to device manager, and clicked the universal serial bus controllers - it shows a &quot;usb mass sotrage device&quot;, with a yellow &quot;exclamation point&quot;... double click - message: &quot;can't start the device&quot;, click troubleshoot - it says &quot;code-10&quot;... disassembled everything... put the drive back into the seagate case (hoping some miracle happened)... plugged in... power's on, seems like something is humming (soft vibration to the touch), but i don't think it's the hard disk spinning... that's about it... not a single hit that my laptop is seeing it... note: from the seagate box (unlike the compusa enclosure), it is connected to the computer via firewire... but i don't think it's the problem... i'd love to buy you dinner if you help me out... hehe thanks anyway
