i got a c3180 when i bought my new imac...when i installed it it very definately states when to connect to my mac with a usb cable...my problen is that it identified itse lf as a 3100 series..gave a different serial number..when i got to the part of a setup assistant..it told its name(that i couldn't change) and then congradulated me on a success ful set up!!!!!!!!
!one of the other windows is suppose to give name and something else and installable options..after about a minute it says that it is a empty selection...all of them.
as far as i can tell..it works ok...prints copies haven't scanned yet.
so what is wrongand how do i fix it?
thanks everybody......this newbie, michele 20&quot; intel mac 2.16 ghz core duo, tiger 10.0408, 2gb memory,
