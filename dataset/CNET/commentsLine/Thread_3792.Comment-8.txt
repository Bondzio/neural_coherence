get partitionmagic.
i too have a system that came with xp home installed.
using pm i partitioned the disk abd installed linux to play with.
i go back and forth regularly and have never had any problems.
you need a recent version!
i had a previoulsy -purchased copy of pm v3 and it didn't recognize the xp partition.
i think pm version 8 is current.
