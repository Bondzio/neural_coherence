<s> I have a Microsoft Notebook 5000 Mouse which Ive had for just under a year and up until a week ago it worked great. </s>
<s> I have a HP tx1219 Notebook which has Vista Home Premium and of course its Bluetooth capable. </s>
<s> My issue is I will be using the mouse and then if I stop for 10mins, 30mins, an hour or any other amount of time and when I go to use it again it wont work. </s>
<s> Ive replaced the batteries of course, the only way I can get it working again is to remove it and reinstall it. </s>
<s> Thats really getting annoying so Im hoping someone can give me a fix for this. </s>
<s> Thanks everyone. </s>

<s> Im sorry Im a little confused, I went to the link you posted but it had info on USB ports, could you give me a little more info. </s>
<s> Thank you for your time and advice. </s>
<s> It's an old problem with a common setting we change to see if that cures it. </s>
<s> If trying this is too hard or unacceptable it's time to use another mouse or take it to a service counter. </s>
<s> The links are so you can learn about the issue and possibly fix it yourself. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I appreciate any help people are willing to give me more than anyone would know, but the Sarcasm and rudeness is a little offensive. </s>
<s> Hmmm, really sounds odd, obviously it isn't a battery problem. </s>
<s> It could be just a bad mouse but then again it works (temporarily) once you reinstall it. </s>
<s> Take a look in DEVICE MANAGER at your B/T antenna status, it is possible that it could be an issue with that and if you are lucky maybe a software (driver update) might do the trick, give it a shot. </s>
<s> My first guess would be the mouse and of course the only way to test that is with another mouse but I would still do the update from DEVICE MANAGER just for drill. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> I offered a search page so you can pick the article you like. </s>
<s> If you find such too hard to read and make the change, print out one about the change to try and have the person who helps you with your PCs do this for you. </s>
<s> I'm aware that we shouldn't have to do arcane things but it is Windows so you get to learn about such. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I trying to figure out what the Bluetooth has to do with USB. </s>
<s> Im sorry if I dont get it, but could you put it into sime terms? </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> Sorry my keys are a bit sticky, let me fix the spelling I asked if you could put things into simple terms </s>
<s> It's one setting in some control panel so go do it or get it done. </s>
<s> Some like a longer reply about USB like this one -&gt; http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6142_102-0.html?messageID=3002781&tag=forums06;posts#3002781 If there is something missing from the instructions please tell me which article you are using and which paragraph you are stuck on. </s>
<s> Again, this is Windows. </s>
<s> It has issues like this so we sometimes get to deal with it or just take it in to the shop. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Many bluetooth adapters are connected via USB which is why I suggest you try to &quot;Turn off a usb port power save option&quot; and why I gave you links to articles about how to do that. </s>
<s> Sorry if I don't explain how a PC is built or works. </s>
<s> This is a small box to type into and for that sort of discussion we have to use web pages and more. </s>
<s> Does that clear up why I suggested changing that setting? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I checked the settings in the Device Manager, then USB Root Hub Properties, Power Management and the Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power, was not checked so I guess thats ruled out that being the problem. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any other ideas? </s>
<s> Please </s>
<s> You try it both ways. </s>
<s> Sorry it took this many tries to get to that setting but I see where many would not connect BT with USB. </s>
<s> Sorry, it's a common issue and Windows is known to not work the same all around. </s>
<s> If you try it the other way and it fails, put it back, retest and if it fails start calling the makers of the laptop and mouse for warranty support. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> Not only do I have a BT mouse (logitech v470) which I use on my HP dv6910us but I've written PalmOS PDA BT capable software and now am re-writing my applications for Windows Mobile. </s>
<s> This gives me some insight to bluetooth but as I can see above many will not get the USB BT connection at first. </s>
<s> PPS. </s>
<s> And yes there are issues in &quot;Blue tooth stacks.&quot; I don't want to open that discussion since when you find that, it's a warranty issue. </s>
