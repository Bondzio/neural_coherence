In these 3-4 years it was doing fine, that was untill about 1 mounth ago. A Blue Screen of Death popped up. It was the first time so I really didn't care untill I can't even get 20 minutes on it without shutting-down. I haven't even started it up yet for days but I tried about 1 hour ago and still got them. I'm not completly sure but it talks about Physical Dump of Memory with no option to escape except by pressing the off button. I tried my best in everything my slightly tech-wize side of my brain I could. Do you guys happen to know how to fix this without having it cost a fortune. P.s. I'm new to the forum but love CNET Powered by Optimum.

Watch this one -&gt; http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-11319_7-6240575-1.html After that I either do nothing or run this scan to eject all it finds -&gt; http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php (just download and scan. no need to pay up unless you want the other features.)
