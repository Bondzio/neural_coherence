thanks i'll give it a try.
do you mean the backup copy of stuff i had on the drive?
i was copying everything from a mac to the drive and my other (pc) computer.
so everything is kind of spread out between the three but i didn't finish before this happened.
of course i have hard copies (cd's) of the music files but i've still got a good amount of stuff on that drive that i didn't get to copy...
