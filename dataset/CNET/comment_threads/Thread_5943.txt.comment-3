Ram and resources don't have much to do with each other.
As I recall I gave you a link to the Newbie's forum about the resource issue/startup progs.
Did you follow Griff's advice?
Get BRUTAL in that area, make it so clean it squeaks.
WinME is not a business system, you can't go willy-nilly loading and running masses of things at the same time, it won't work.
You could install 10x the ram but resources won't change.
Resources are the killer.
