i am looking to purchase a notebook for college.
i'm looking into a few offers for a solid work/gaming machine.
i have read reviews and looked at benchmarking tests that with the right memory (ddr400 3200?)
the 64 will perform better in games than a pent3.2.
my question.
given the fact that games are always kicking up the system requirements, will the 2.2ghz speed of the 64 chip itself act as a limiting factor or should i just consider total system performance (better than 3.2ghz)?
