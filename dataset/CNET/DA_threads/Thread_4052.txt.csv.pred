1.1.1	Hi I apologize if this has been discussed before I unfortunately can not find it anywhere on the forum .	St
1.1.2	I am in the market for a new laptop .	St
1.1.3	I run quite a few database intensive programs as well as multitask extensively .	St
1.1.4	With all the new laptops out there my question is should I opt for more Ram ( 12GB ) or would the performance be better with say 8GB of Ram and a 32GB mssd .	St
1.1.5	Thanking everyone in advance for their help	St
1.2.1	Keep in mind that more RAM does not mean reduced times .	St
1.2.2	An example long ago is where we had identical PCs and was able to swap the RAM from one to the other .	St
1.2.3	The job would take 6 hours .	St
1.2.4	So we doubled the RAM and re-ran the tests on both machines .	St
1.2.5	The machine with double the RAM finished 5 minutes sooner without fail .	St
1.2.6	So RAM in that case was not the bottleneck .	St
1.2.7	12GB of RAM on a netbook in my opinion is a bad investment .	St
1.2.8	Nod to the Hybrid Hard Drive .	St
