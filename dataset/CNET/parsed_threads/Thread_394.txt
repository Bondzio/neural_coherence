<s> hi there-- I have two machines with SOYO 6BA+ motherboards in them, I am finally done with various projects I needed them for and can do maintenance on them. </s>
<s> Both motherboards seem to be working fine, but I have the original non-updated BIOS's in both. </s>
<s> Should I flash them or leave them alone? </s>
<s> thanks - fj </s>
<s> I did. </s>
<s> It was my decision since I had the time to update them because I found the changes worthwhile in where the old boards were. </s>
<s> No support for large drives and you can't find under 40GB drives anymore. </s>
<s> If nothing else, download latest and put in the box for that day. </s>

<s> well the reason I ask is, I am afraid of the consequences of screwing it up. </s>
<s> (I am reasonably experienced but I've never done this particular task before, and many people [and BIOS websites] have told me NOT to do it if not absolutely necessary) I guess if the power stays on it should be okay. </s>
<s> are there any tricks to it other than reading the instructions? </s>
<s> will a BIOS upgrade allow me to use bigger than 30 GB drives? </s>
<s> (which I currently cannot use?) </s>
<s> I have a SOYO 6BA+ and a 6BA +III. </s>
<s> fyi, tiger direct sells 30 gb seagates for about $60. </s>
<s> THANKS fj </s>
<s> That's the reason I updated. </s>
<s> 60 bucks gets a new 7200 RPM 80 or larger GB drive. </s>
<s> Why should I give up space over a BIOS update? </s>
<s> No real tricks. </s>
<s> Just get the right BIOS files. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> thanks, I'll give it a go! </s>

<s> hi there well I finally screwed my courage to the sticking place, downloaded the bios upgrade and awardflash. </s>
<s> exe, followed all instructions, and when it asked me if I wanted to save old bios, I said sure, and it's spitting at me . </s>

<s> I don't think I've ruined it yet, but . </s>

<s> . </s>
<s> I guess I can't pick my own filename, I have to type the name of the current bios. </s>
<s> is the OLD bios file the little sequence of numbers I see at startup? </s>
<s> I assume I have to type that in if I want to save the old bios? </s>
<s> -- --fj </s>
<s> hey there well it took me a while to figure out that while I had to not type the &quot;exe&quot; file extension on a&gt;awdflash, I DID have to type the &quot;.bin&quot; extension on the new bios filename. </s>
<s> I am UP and RUNNING -- AND it is recognizing the 40 gb drive now! </s>
<s> hooray! </s>
<s> How big of a drive can this Soyo 6ba+ mobo recognize now with the bios update ya spose? </s>
<s> ==fj </s>
<s> Past that and you may be pressing your luck. </s>
<s> Some motherboard makers have this on their website. </s>
