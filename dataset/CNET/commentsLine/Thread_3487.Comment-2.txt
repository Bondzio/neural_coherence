some larger hd's won't work with older computers and operating systems, but there are solutions available.
what is the model name of the hd?
what is your operating system (and service pack)?
click: start &gt; control panel &gt; administrative tools &gt; computer management double-click: storage &gt; disk management from there you can rt-click any hd and initialize, partition, and format it.
