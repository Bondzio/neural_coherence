<s> My old HP Pavilion dv9207us stopped working and I purchase a new HP Pavilion dv3-2155mx notebook. </s>
<s> The old computer will not start up. </s>
<s> I pulled out the external hard drive (Western WD 1200BEVS) SATA 2.5&quot; and purchased a Thermaltake BlacX docking station (P/N: ST0005U) to transfer data onto my new notebook. </s>
<s> It says it should easily transfer SATA 2.5&quot; and 3.5&quot; hard drives. </s>
<s> I am cannot connect my hard drive to it. </s>
<s> Do you know why? </s>
<s> The dock looks to be the right part but you'll have to tell more. </s>
<s> Itis actually an internal hard drive(The WD 1200BEVS). </s>
<s> The connection &quot;Teeth&quot; on the internal drive do not appear to map directly into the docking station. </s>
<s> Is there any other information I should provide? </s>
<s> The dock looks right to match your SATA 2.5 inch laptop drive. </s>
<s> Now having said that, I found this docks to be rather flimsy and non-intuitive when it slides &quot;home.&quot; You have the right parts. </s>
<s> Here's a cable I use instead of the docks. </s>
