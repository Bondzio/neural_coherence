<s> Just got this as a gift from my employers. </s>
<s> 64mb flash drive! </s>
<s> (Yay). </s>
<s> Now, what can I do with this? </s>
<s> Currently I'm thinking a few options: 1) Make it a bootable drive for emergency rescue operations. </s>
<s> But, which OS / distro? </s>
<s> Is there an OS that can fit within 64mb? </s>
<s> 2) Install Windows portable apps on it. </s>
<s> Thinking of Abiword for sure, what other useful apps you think can fit on it? </s>
<s> But I found my older laptop could only boot from 4GB and smaller memory sticks. </s>
<s> What I did boot was Ubuntu and it did run Abiword https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AbiWord . </s>
<s> Ubuntu is less than 1GB which leaves you a lot of open space. </s>

<s> How long have you worked for him/her, hehe. </s>
<s> Or should that be 64Gb...now that would be nice. </s>
<s> Do as you would any harddrive. </s>
<s> Thanks for your reply, but it's 64 Megabytes only. </s>
<s> That's like 10% of a single CD storage. </s>
<s> I searched around, and looks like Damn Small Linux may be the way to go. </s>
<s> Worked for this large-scale healthcare employer for almost two years now. </s>
<s> Actually they had to gift something on Doctor's day, and apparently they came out with this brilliant idea of 64mb flash drive (don't know where they purchased them from). </s>
<s> Now 64mb is a great size for carrying documents and even pictures (like patient x-ray jpegs etc), but I'm going to use my 8GB flash drive for that purpose. </s>
<s> It's the smallest flash drive I've ever had, and I really want to experiment with it, in that how much &quot;usefulness&quot; can fit into it. </s>
<s> MyBad. </s>
<s> I haven't seen that size in years. </s>
<s> And my oldest stick is 128MB! </s>
<s> Ok. </s>
<s> Damn Small Linux it is. </s>
<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Linux_distribution has the others. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> 11 years ago, it costed $29.99. </s>
<s> never let me down. </s>
<s> now It's a bootable pen for any laptop without CD/DVD drive. </s>
<s> love it </s>
