i've experienced this with at least three machines.
nowadays, new machines arrive without a dedicated video card and an onboard video card that shares the installed memory.
as described in the case at hand, the onboard video card shares 256mb of the installed ram.
it does not have its own ram.
in order to get the full benefit of dedicated video card ram, one must install a video card with its own ram.
this will have two benefits.
first, the ram installed on the motherboard will not be shared any more and will be fully available for other tasks.
second, the ram on the video card can be sufficient for whatever video demands are put upon it, e.g., gaming.
be sure to get a card with sufficient ram for the intended purposes such as hard-core gaming.
