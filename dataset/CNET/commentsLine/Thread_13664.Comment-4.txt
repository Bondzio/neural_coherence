i have called tech support so many times and they don't ever seem to have any clue.
every once in a while, recycling the router doesn't work and i have to recycle both the router and the modem (which i also replaced thinking that could be the problem.
i had a motorola, now a lynksys.... same prob... but i think it is in the router.
