by power saving mode, i really meant sleep mode.
if this doesn't work, can i send a print job to the computer when it is off, or in sleep mode and then print it when i wake or turn the computer on?
i am still not even sure how i network computers so i am probably jumping the gun here- but this is the reason why i want to network- so i would want to make sure it is possible before i go through the work of trying to figure out how to network.
thanks for your help!
