I'd like to be able to record telephone interviews and have it go directly to my computer (iMac G4 desktop 10.3.9). Anyone know of reliable hardware/software to do this?

Before I got rid of my land line I used it every once in a while, and it worked pretty good. It's Shareware, so look for it at the usual places, like http:/www.Download.com Lampie
