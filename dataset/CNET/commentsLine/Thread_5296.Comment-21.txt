two key points in your question.
gamer & shared memory.
shared memory is just that.
the integrated card uses part of your ram for it's memory.
if your a gamer a dedicated card is best way to go.
while you could in most cases shut off the integrated video in the bios & install a dedicated card, low end machines may have limited expansion slots.
if games you play don't require high resources you could be ok.
