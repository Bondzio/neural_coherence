That says 2 things to me; 1] If the original poster was tracking this discussion in 2005, he probably no longer is. 2] The question the OP was asking then has probably been solved, in some way. These forums are not a trading area or market place. You may do better searching elsewhere on the internet for your stand. Good luck in your search. Mark
