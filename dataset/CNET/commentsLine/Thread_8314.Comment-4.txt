i had a little more time to research power supplies and have decieded to get the antec neohe 550 watt power supply.
it does go over his $100 buget, but i will make up the difference as this looks like a very good supply from the reviews.
they have it at circuit city here in town, so we don't have to worry about the shipping.
thanks again.
