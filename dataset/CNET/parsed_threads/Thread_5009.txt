<s> hello everyone, i'm going to buy a tablet soon but i just don't know wich one to choose. </s>
<s> my budget is around 500 dollars. </s>
<s> things that are important to me are a large memory (expendable via micro sd works for me too), a fast device, absolutely zero lag, a great screen and great looks. </s>
<s> at first i was thinking to buy the apple ipad mini 64 gb or the ipad 4 32 gb. </s>
<s> please help me out, thanks </s>
<s> I've yet to see any device with no zero lag. </s>
<s> Can you share why a tablet at all? </s>
<s> It sounds as if you were shopping for a gaming laptop/tablet. </s>

<s> But I'm still on my laptop. </s>
<s> Go figure. </s>

<s> hey, i'm not buying a tablet for gaming and stuff as i already have a gaminglaptop. </s>
<s> i'm just looking for a tablet with fast webbrowsing and short loading times for things like youtube, email, spotify... the tablet will be used at home because i don't feel like booting my pc up every time i want to check my email. </s>
<s> and with &quot;zero lag&quot; i do not mean zero lag, i mean the fewest lag possible (sorry for my english). </s>
<s> The tablet with the lowest lag will not be one we can discuss as even if I noted it here, it would be out of date by tomorrow. </s>
<s> The top 10 are all nice and I have one of those in the 10 and another model of another in the 10. </s>
<s> Why not one of the top 10 models? </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> Correction. </s>
<s> I don't own these. </s>
<s> The office is porting apps so I get to use them a lot. </s>
<s> i decided to buy the ipad mini 64 gb. </s>
<s> just got it yesterday and i love it! </s>
<s> fast response and fine build quality, also a quick tablet overall. </s>
<s> the only downside is that is has no retina display, but the screen is still magnificent! </s>
<s> thanks for the advice! </s>
<s> bye </s>
