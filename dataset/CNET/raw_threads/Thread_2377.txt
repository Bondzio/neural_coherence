Though it says that it occupies 2.38 GB of 4.38 GB, there are no files at all. Ho can I view these files. Please help me as these files are very important for me.

If I use some DVD media as a drive software then when I take this DVD to another machine the files are missing. Back to the machine I created it on and my files show. Why is that? It happens because the machine that it worked on has special drivers (called filters) that enable use to see and write to the DVD media as if it was a slow hard drive. I discourage use of such titles for the very reason you posted. If you can supply the title of software you used or if you used the native OS feature we can look into how to get at the files on other PCs. For now you can look up ISOBUSTER and see if it sees the files. Bob

SOME OF THE DVDS THAT I CAN SEE THE FILES MAINLY PIX AND VIDEO CLIPS READ CDFS UNDER PROPERTIES AND OTHERS SAY UDF. I USED ROXIO EASY CREATOR AND ROXIO INSTALED LIMITED VERSION AND NERO AND EVEN A FEW FREE DOWNLOADED DVD BURNERS. THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA TO USE DIFFERENT SOFTWARE BURNERS AS THEY TEND TO PURPUSELY WANT TO MAKE YOU BUY THEIR REPAIR PRODUCTS.
