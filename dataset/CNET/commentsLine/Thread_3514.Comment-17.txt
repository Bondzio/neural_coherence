seems to me all your problems ly on you motherboard.
if you want new technology, get a motherboard with a socket that can handle fast cpu's, and many of those motherboards come with x16 pci slot for a high end graphics card.
many motherboards also have sli compatibility for 2 graphics cards.
with a new motherboard, new cpu, graphics card, and more memory, your system will be up and running like brand new.
i also highly advise you get a new os, like xp home.
