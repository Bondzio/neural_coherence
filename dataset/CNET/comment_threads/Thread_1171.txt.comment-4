Clean the inside of the mouse.
If this is a standard ball type mouse, unscrew the bottom with a simple twist and take out the ball.
Make sure it's free of dust.
then, take an eraser and clean the roll bars, they may have deposits of grime and dirt that are making the roller ball slip.
you shouldn't have to replace it.
good luck.
