They each have local static IP addesses. For example, my wireless connection 192.168.1.11 is my default - it goes to the web as my default connection. What I would like to do is use this in most cases, but say when I am attempting to get an mp3 file (for example), the wired connection is used. Environment - Windows XP Pro I know this may seem silly to do, but I was hoping there were some great minds out there that might have some ideas on how this could work. Also - the ability to do this at the Application Layer would be ideal. Changing a bunch of Windows settings can be tedious and would need repeated on each different machine. Either way, I am open to any ideas or suggestions. Thanks! Nick

Mind you are probably using Windows so that means the only adjustment you can make is to establish a route to one or the other network based on the IP address. Tell me you understand routing and then we'll move to the next step. This will never &quot;bond&quot; the 2 channels. Bob

What I can't get my mind wrapped around is intercepting the HTTP GET requests and being able to change the interface it goes out on. I read a good deal about &quot;bonding&quot; and not sure if thats what I am looking for. I want to be able to, effectively, choose which interface I use on each request. Most talk about bonding or this type of thing leads into a reply with - you should just by a better router with load balancing. I am not looking for this. I want to write an application that filters the request and chooses an interface based on the content type. I appreciate your fast response. Let me know what you think. Thanks, Nick

The NAT we do with ICS is only going to thoroughly dismiss what you asked to do in your first post. -&gt; So is subnetting the internet going to accomplish your goal? Bob
