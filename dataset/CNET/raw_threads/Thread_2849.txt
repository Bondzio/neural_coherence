Hello, I have an older Intel D845PEBT2 motherboard and it has both the Primary and Secondary IDE channels, but it also has Primary and Secondary channels for onboard RAID. I am not interested in setting up a RAID config, but I want to know if I can just add more drives and run them each independantly. I tried hooking up a 3rd drive but it does not show up under My Computer in Windows XP. I have enabled the RAID in the BIOS (I enabled it only, not set up a config) but Windows still will not show the icon for the drive. I know the drive and the cable are good. Is this possible on my motherboard? Thanks.

Download the &quot;Integrated Serial ATA Driver&quot; from R. Proffit's link. While you're at it, get the PDF manual for that board, as well. If the SATA HD is not SATA150, then you may need to jumper it as such (depends on the model). Attach SATA HD to primary SATA connector. Check to see if the SATA HD shows in system BIOS. Does it? Make sure the HD with XP is still the primary boot drive and boot into XP. Install SATA Driver from XP. Partition and format the new SATA HD in Disk Management (use NTFS). Note that it is common for a new HD not to show in My Computer until you initialize it in Disk Management. If the HD is larger than 137GB, then you may need to update the motherboard BIOS and make sure that XP is at least SP1 (just update to SP2). These issues outlined at http://www.48bitlba.com .
