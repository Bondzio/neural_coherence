Dell uses generic parts.
Most brand names do.
Dell is harder to upgrade.
on the most part you need to use there exspensive products to upgrade with.
If money is no object, find a site like, www.pricewatch.com,www.computergeeks.com, tigerdirect.com, there are other sites but what i'm saying is have a desktop custom built with the products you want or, better yet learn to build your own.
You will have a better quality computer for about the same $ and a lot easier to upgrade.
