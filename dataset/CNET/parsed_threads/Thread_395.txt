<s> Hi guys, Let's suppose I'm connected to a network whose admin asked in a friendly way not to download anything but certain things he specified. </s>
<s> He never came to my machine or setup any kind of client to it. </s>
<s> The question now is, is there any chance he knows what I download??? </s>
<s> Does he know the name and the extension of the file I download if I use Utorrent and magnet links??? </s>
<s> Thanks for your help in advance </s>
<s> Sorry, but we don't help with circumventing employers (or whatever network we talk about) restrictions. </s>
<s> And we certainly don't advise installing and using p2p programs at company laptops. </s>
<s> At work, the admin runs a remote program once in a while to see what's installed. </s>
<s> Although I don't know what program he uses I suppose it can see all files on my disk. </s>
<s> So the most safe option for you is to only do what is allowed and nothing else. </s>

<s> On a company network a good admin installs monitoring apps. </s>
<s> In rare cases they'll watch an employee that has installed torrents for simple reasons. </s>
<s> Do we need to repeat them? </s>
