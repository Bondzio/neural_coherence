<s> I ordered this today to have a TIVO to save shows and sports games. </s>
<s> I have a couple questions 1. </s>
<s> Will It work on integrated audio? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Will this work past the digital tv cutoff date? </s>
<s> I have cable that brings me the channels not an antenna. </s>
<s> The company says they have the digital cable switch covered </s>
<s> Answer to the 2nd question first: More than likely the cable companies that give you that answer are expecting to provide analog channels after the cutoff date or expect you to get a cable box. </s>
<s> It has not been made clear to me which way they are planning. </s>
<s> You might ask your provider which way they plan on going, if they will tell you. </s>
<s> Now the other question. </s>
<s> I see no reason that integrated audio would not work with this if your other components are working properly. </s>
<s> Will continue to have analog service after the cutoff date. </s>
<s> I can't wait for the card tommorow + a refurbished Maxtor 120 GB slave hard drive </s>
