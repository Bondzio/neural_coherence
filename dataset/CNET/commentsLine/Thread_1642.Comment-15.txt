at costco.com these are the video cards i can choose from: integrated ati radeon xpress hypermemory [included] nvidia geforce 6200se w/turbocache 256mb support [add $62.00] 256mb ddr ati radeon x1300 pro [add $153.00] the final price with the ati radeon express which is the basic one is $610 so i need a not-too-cheap-but-okay-video card.
i know i seem to be asking a lot of questions but i really need a good computer so i don't blow all my money on this one and have to buy another in the near future.
