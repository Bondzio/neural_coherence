i would check that the bios is current, and see what the manual notes for jumpers (if any.)
the usual is that the settings are incorrect.
since there was no make/model supplied, then you just need to read the manual on what to set for this cpu.
an out of date bios will mis-report the cpu so if you have such an issue, fix it.
