Had one system that periodically would not boot.
IDE connectiion at HDD would vibrate out just enough to prevent HHD from being seen by the BIOS.
Wound up hot gluing that connection.
You may also want to go to Maxtors web site and download thier diagonstic utility.
Tho I think you will find a loose connection.
