you will need the VGA HD AV Cableto hook this up to the 360: http://www.xbox.com/en-US/hardware/x/xbox360vgahdcable/ Note that this monitor is not a HDTV... it is a widescreen LCD monitor.
It's native res is 1680x1050 but you'll be using the analog VGA inputs and running at 1360x768 or 1280x720.
You should demo the unit first at a local BB to make sure it's scaling is acceptable to you.
