i've wasted money on two pci controllers, the whole night looking up faqs, knowledge databases, bios and driver upgrades from wd, silicon image and vantec... and i was one stop short of rma-ing my external hdd.... thankfully i found this forum!
just a 60-second trick to shave the end off the header and it works!
the thing is... why can't they even get the specifications right in these sort of stuff?
