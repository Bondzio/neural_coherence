i think it's best to buy an inexpensive computer every year and sell the old one (usually on ebay).
i like to buy refurbished machines on ebay, compusaauctions.com, or ubid.
i can save 25% or more over retail.
my current computer is an hp 3800+ that i paid $525 for (retail was $719).
i sold my hp 3400+ for $400.
my total upgrade cost this year was only $125.
