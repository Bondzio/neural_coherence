I was using a very poor quality powerbar and one day there was a power outage... Well, after that it didn't work. I'm sure I can maybe fix it somehow, but I don't feel like it's even worth it.

I've got an Edge DiskGo! 120GB drive that I use primarily to store my MP3 collection and another 120GB SATA drive in a USB enclosure that I use for D2D backup. Like I said - no problems (yet). I happen to agree with the line of thinking that with hard drives, it's not IF they'll go bad - it's WHEN they'll go bad.

I got a new machine two years ago, and then around this time last year, I decided that the 120 GB worth of space was doing me no good if I couldn't readily use it, so I bought an Adaptec aluminum drive enclosure and now I'm using it to expand my storage. So far, so good. Other than an issue with it not coming back to life after standby under Vista, it's been flawless. And even that, Microsoft has acknowledged the problem.

I will never again buy a drive that doesn't have a fan, and I don't care what the manufacturer says. I went through two LaCie drives in short order and went to Avastor which all have nice internal fans and have yet to have any failure. Forget about &quot;convection cooling&quot; or the rap that the external wall wart can't contribute heat so you don't need a fan. There's so much heat coming from the drive itself that it has to be cooled by forced air or your looking for trouble, especially if you use the drive in a hot environment. Now I use Avastor HDX800 series, usually 500 Gigabyte for recording and video editing. They're extremely fast especially on the high speed firewire bus. They're not cheap, but are worth the cost. I won't even go into how much time and aggravation the other drives cost me through lost data. Now I back up each Firewire drive to another Firewire drive just in case. Eventually it'll be time for a RAID system so the backing up is automatic, but for now I'm happy with what the regular FireWire drives are doing.

To begin, let me point out that I was never able to get the OneTouch function the button on the case that can be used to start a backup to work. However, I still used it very effectively for manually-run backups using Norton Ghost. One day it just wouldn't work, period. Yes, the drive did spin-up as normal, but nothing I tried would make my XP SP2 system recognize the drive. I de-installed and re-installed the drivers two or more times, but nothing worked. I know drives can simply die for a variety of reasons the electronics, a corruption problem, or even a major mechanical failure but for some reason, I hesitated to believe it was really and totally dead. The only reason why I didn't just &quot;chuck&quot; the drive was that it cost me a pretty penny. I also had a feeling it might actually not be busted. I was hopeful for two reasons. First - Because I'm very easy-going with my hardware; translation: if a component has high-speed moving parts, I never touch or move it while it's up and running. Yes, I know they can take a certain amount of jostling, but the way I see it, the less jostling, the better. Second - I kept wondering whether one of my recent Windows updates may have included a patch that rendered the drive unusable. Fast-forward a little. I'd occasionally retry the drive, but always nothing ... until one day, I clicked the heels of my ruby slippers, and BINGO, it worked again. I can't prove it one way or another, but I suspect that one Windows patch broke it, and a subsequent patch fixed it. Note that I've since moved this drive to my Vista Home Premium system and it worked without having to install any extra drivers. Make sense? Just my two cents worth.

When I purchased the current computer, I didn't know until I cracked it open, it uses a SATA drive. I've always used PATA, and I keep all my non-operating system files on a secondary drive (WDC 120 gig). I quickly learned that SATA and PATA don't play well together. So, I got one of those kits and mounted and connected the secondary drive through the USB port. Have all my files, and haven't had a problem yet.

I bought my Western Digital 7200 100 GB drive years ago when they were the largest capacity available. Think about that! I have never had one problem that I can remember. It has all my backup files and still runs like a charm. I have a new 320 GB but just haven't gotten around to installation yet. That's on the to do list and I hope that gets done before a creash! I'm still safe though, because I learned years ago to have more than one backup on different media. Flash drives are wonderful for that!

The first was with a 40GB Seagate drive that I installed into an external USB box that was to be used for daily backups at work, this unit worked for some time until I believe a Microsoft update stopped it from working, I replaced the drive, and had the same problem, with the same message, then the exact same problem was encountered with with a different drive a WD 200GB unit installed in the same type of device stopped working after updates to my home computer. I might add that all the units were formated NTFS so that drive images could be backed up, and the software used came with the external box called Vipower and Saturn box. I pulled the WD200GB disk and installed it into another computer formatted and installed xp pro and it worked great untill the power supply failed. in the meantime I purchased a WD 60GB Passport drive, that has twice lost all my backup email details, although I was able to retrieve the information using System Mechanic Pro, it has made wary of External HDD backup units, I have had problems with CD and DVD backups as well with errors like &quot;Cyclic Redundancy&quot; messages poping up from time to time as well so now I keep multiple digital copies of jpegs and mpegs I want to keep

I did not want to loose any of my precious pictures or important data so I put it all on the WD. DUMB MOVE! I did not own the drive very long when it failed to function. I tried to view it on several different computers but they did not recognize it. Once I plug the usb plug in, Windows said it was recognized. Yet it did not show up anywhere, even in the systems hardware - device manager or my computer. At this point I would like to say I think WD CSR are just about useless. I emailed, I called, I did everything I was told to do. It took me way too long to finally get a human - weeks and weeks. I am not confident in Western Digitial hard drives any longer, if they had good customer service I would not be so harsh, after all anything can break. The end result is they say the drive is dead, it does not respond... and it will take hundreds of dollars if I want to sent it back so that my data can be recovered. Not exceptable, poor product, poor customer service. If I may I have a couple of questions. How do I know what type of hd it is? (eeid,sata???) If there isn't sound do you think it is worth trying an enclosure? Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I deleted my data from my computer, very sad. Thanks - Ramona

The first one was showing signs of failure, so I replaced it. The problem area was the folding USB plug which uses an internal stranded cable. After enough flex cycles, it's not too surprising that it would fail. So, after a couple of years of reliable service, I began to experience errors. I bought a replacement, transferred the contents, and am now happily using my second one with no more problems. I also took the opportunity to upgrade from a 40GB drive to a 60GB drive. OTOH, I also use a 500GB Seagate Mirra network backup server and it's been quite reliable baking up 3 Windows machines on my home network 24/7 in the background for the past several years. My only complaint about the Mirra server is that Seagate doesn't offer client software to also back up my Linux machines - despite the fact that the Mirra server runs Debian Linux internally.

First time ,.. now get this &quot;a first 4 me&quot; the hdd started vibrating like hell. The following day i took the whole unit to the store where i originally bought it from, explained the matter and had it tested by the tech's at the store. they were blown away on the behaviour of the unit. At first it was kinda funny cause, they've never seen som'ing like this before, well i booked it for repair/replacement. The sad thing is not the entire drive was backed up, and i lost data that took a year to create, and there was absolutely nothing to do cause it just would'nt start up on any machine. The hdd was returned labeled &quot;certified repaired&quot;. I started fresh again storing, storing and one day again after 2 weeks it just would'nt start up again, the enclosure led displayed a constant flashing but nothing. I got it started a few times after windows updates after a heavy struggle at times yes, but even then it don't last long cause, after some time it gets hot and then led flashes again and makes a strange pinging sound and then freezes up, thats it. it won't start up after that again. maybe the next day or so, if i'm lucky. I suspected the interface and/or component board on it to be faulty cause the content on the drive itself is not corrupted for the time that it works i can store data on it or copy,cut, whatever untill it malfunctions again , what do u make of this??? I have had the drive installed in other units and pc's as well, nothing. Now the power supply is to hell and gone as well, not working anymore.

Because I was not aware that it was necessary before closing the drive to use the 'Safely remove hardware' icon in the system tray. The instructions that came with the drive were minimal to say the least and even after searching their website I couldn't find a reference to the need to take care when closing the drive. As a consequence I lost about 100Gb of pictures. BUT I had already saved all of them to CD-RW's as well but that didn't cushion my annoyance. I eventually found out about the SRH button in a French expats forum!!

Only the first one, a 300 mb or so drive by a now out of business outfit named &quot;Spirit&quot; died on me - but that was after years of faithful service. When it did finally die, it was in use as a backup startup drive. Two of the others - a 1 GB Poweruser Pro and an 40GB APS Drive aren't used much since they're on a backup machine and are connected via SCSI (remember those?). The other two - an APS 120 GB (for digital photos only) and a LaCie d2 160 GB are working fine - the latter has been used for current projects on a daily basis for about three years with no problems. I've used both with USB (on a old machines) and Firewire (on the current one) with no problems. In the workplace, I've lost two over the same amount of time - one LaCie Porsche drive was dropped while running (never a good thing) and died, and an external APS drive that was used for photo storage and temporary backups. The APS ran solidly every workday for five years before causing problems. There was plenty of time to replace it, but the new boss couldn't see why he should bother - and it died, taking the data with it, since he didn't see the wisdom of doing backups. Overall, the Lacie d2 drives have done very well for me - there were three at my workplace (although the oldest one developed formatting issues recently with the OS Upgrade) and I am considering getting another one to replace the old APS drive, which is 60% full now.

What matters most is the &quot;architecture&quot; of one's PC. That is to say, &quot;placement&quot; on any given surface (placement of the drive horizontal, vertical, on a precarious perch?). Related and more important still is the relationship, by definition part of any good architecting, between the drive and the owner and/or the other equipment. I warn here, too, that what is not being said is equally important as anything else related to an external drive. It is not the brand names so much. Hold that info aside for now. Think on this: What are the equipment used for? How often (there is a MTBF for all hardware)? How long? What are the personal care-taking habits (re their pc equipment) of the respondent? These drives mentioned thus far, especially the newer ones, are all competent and reliable. One can get a &quot;lemon,&quot; too, or drop a drive on one's toe, or whatever, of course, shortening a drive's MTBF. In brief, its the way a modern hard drive (external or internal) is used and cared-for (degragmented, tested, low-level operations). In other words, the relationship between equipment and owner matter more than virtually all the other parameters: this is clear from this thread. The thread, then, should move more in the direction of solution, not attribution. As they said, a department mantra, in my old job, &quot;Fix the problem, not the blame.&quot; The problem is in the architecture encompassing the relationships between actors that matters. Drives are commodities, like light bulbs. They're all basically the same. Hence, their low prices, by the way. Good luck.

I purchased a Seagate 300 gig internal hard drive about two years ago. Less than two months later, it died. I went through the rigamarole with the store from which I purchased the drive and eventually had to contact Seagate directly. They sent me a box and some shipping labels to send my drive back to them, which I did. A few weeks later, I was compensated with a 750 gig external hard drive (worth about 3 times what I paid for the internal drive), which I've used for backup purposes ever since. I went out a few weeks later and bought the same internal hard drive I had sent back to them, and it has (again, knock on wood) worked ever since, too. I perform regular backups of everything nowadays, as I lost quite a bit of music and a lot of digital pictures when the drive died in the first place. Like I said, though, I've not had any trouble with the external drive. I've got it partitioned into quite a few different sections (with different filesystems) and run regular back ups (at least once a week, sometimes a lot more often).

I have a lot of external drives storing my online movie collection...and have had a few failures. It is hard to work out why they die...they just stop. Heat seems to be an issue...particularly in the 750-1 TB drives. I now run them on the little USB connected notebook coolers and the problems seem to have stopped. A simple and cheap fix. Keep backups. All drives will die sooner or later....it is worth having a backup of important data stored on another drive stored somewhere else.

I bought a 500 gig Western Digital external drive for storage. I had it about 4 months and it quit working. The computer no longer sees the drive at all. I read on the net that I should break open the case and install the drive as an internal drive in my computer but so far I haven't tried it. The case looks like it would be very hard to open. I just haven't had the courage to break it yet. I have a Dell computer running Windows XP. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

After a while the enclosure gave the drive too much power and fried the motor controller, thereby rendering the drive and data useless. Mad Dog makes good products, I just had bad luck. Do not even try their tech support though, it is a joke. They did not reply for a long time and were unhelpful when they did reply. They only replyed to the first email.

It was a 250 GB Western Digital My Book external hard drive. The drive would not power up on several different machines. I'd get three clicks then nothing. After a lot of reading on the net and giving the drive and data up for gone I put the drive in the freezer. Got back all my data and I'm still using the drive. I don't trust it with anything important but I'm still using it to store CD's I've ripped and files that I already have several other backups of.

Having an expensive (Maxtor/Targus/Western Digital/La Cie) drive die on you after only 9 months and only once/month use(as you indicated) sucks. But all of the writers here have had this brand or that one fail on them. Drives today are like cell phones or light bulbs. If they break, it is cheaper to buy another one rather than to have it fixed. Thus, hard drives are now, at least, a &quot;commodity.&quot; Commodities are, usually, interchangable with eachother. What I mean to say is, at the recognized brand name, fairly expensive drive &quot;level&quot; of those drives mentioned here, there is remarkable similarity in parts and integrity. Many drives use another, hidden manufacturer of their actual drive, then have their logo, etc., silk-screened onto the drive and sell it as if it were made by them. Not too many factories--even in China--have the wherewithal to build positive (air) pressure clean rooms, needed to ensure air does not contaiminate the room (it only flows out) and because, recall, a single speck of dust can ruin a drive/cpu/doped silicon-based device. Look not at the brand of the drive, but at the relationship of the user and the equipment. End users are capable of anything: the dumber the more likely. I have said this before, but it applies to your griping (no offense! please! nothing wrong with griping we all do it and you did get a bad deal with the Maxtor): the major proximate cause, a.k.a., root cause, cause of all causes, when it comes to hard drives is its config and its use. Please do complain, here and to Maxtor, but know that (perhaps not in your case, but ... )it is these parameters that cause drives to fail, not their brand. They're cheap, they're manufactured by the same companies in the same factories, in large part. As I said above, today's state of the art hard drives of all brands are very reliable and very inexpensive. So replace a drive don't fix it (have it fixed), i.e., hard drives have become, like the $500 PC, a commodity.

Last year, due to corrupted MS Office applications, I was forced to reinstall windows and I opted for an external hard drive to backup my computer. I read a lot of information from every source I could find and I opted for a Maxtor 180 GB external drive. I was able to back up my computer files very easily. Only took a few minutes of set up and a few minutes of back up. I used the Symantic restore feature on my Dell 5100 computer, which, in less than 10 minutes, wiped my hard drive and re-installed windows and all factory applications to factory fresh. After re-installing all my applications, I simply had to click and drag &quot;My Documents&quot; back to my desk top hard drive. Now, 8 months later, no crashes, and my external hard drive backs up my documents every week.

Worked for AT&T 33 years as a systems manager in every capacity. So I know how to handle HDs and all sensitive computer components. The thing that bits me is Maxtors lack of response to a faulty product they sold. I find it hard to walk away from a $200 hard drive that failed due to poor quality and not user neglect no matter who the manufacturer. I have 4 machines in my home/lab and about 14 hard drives internal and external. Never had a failure, but then I never had a Maxtor. I don't trust people who don't complain because nothing said nothing gained. So I repeat Maxtor Stinks.

I was able to the information off the HD, so nothing lost but I remember having a history of USB External Drive problems. Is it the USB connection somehow? Also, I have Carbonite back up and they do not back up external HD, so I got another internal for back up and storage. Next time, I will look to the ones with fans. Soon I will need another one, so thanks for the input.

In many situations you engineer your way out of the problem. The failures must be identified then re-engineered so that the &quot;problem&quot; goes away, the complaints. This sounds like common sense, unfortunately it is not. Nearly all &quot;human&quot; and hardware problems can be re-engineered to eliminate a problem. If people unplug there external drives you make them very difficult to unplug. If there moving them around while there running you attach them to the PC tower where they are less likely to move them. If they over heat you add a better fan or other solution. These are engineering problems. It appears from this forum that 50% or more of all external drives fail when they should not. They are unreliable, only 15&lt;&gt;- should fail during there life expectancy (five years&lt;+). I know, &quot;easier said then done&quot; but that's why the Engineers get the big bucks.

They are also constantly monitored by HDD Life and Intel Desktop Utilities. Suddeenly for no apparent reason it will not work. I can't re-format it.

My older extHDD (LaCie) works like a clock and has always done, but my Seagate is being very annoying by stop responding at random times, with the transfer-light just flashing... Sometimes Windows stops responding altogether until I disconnect the drive, and then everything resumes again! I used to be able to use it for Windows Vista's backup system, but I haven't been able to do that for some time now. I defragmented it some time ago and then it worked normally for a while, but then it messed up again, and now it doesn't even help defragmenting it. Perhaps it would help by reformatting the drive...? I'll try it as soon as I have access to a computer with a larger HDD than my laptop's 100GB.

I never bought another one until yesterday. Bought it from a store that has a super liberal VERY user-friendly return policy. I chose the store with care knowing that external hard drives have a sketchy history. Why the poll? Is it because external hard drives are known to die far more often than a lot of other things out there? If you read the reviews at Newegg and Amazon external hard drives have a reputation, a bad reputation. It's not all bad. But there are a lot of reviews where people state that their hard drive failed not all that long after they bought it. I'm one of 'em. As are a great many others.

Just lucky I guess. I am still using a 10 year old Maxtor 80GB drive and I dont believe it has a fan. It has taken a lot of abuse but still keeps running. I also have another Maxtor One Touch external drive that still seems to be working just fine. My other two are in Venus D53 enclosures that do have fans, one has a Western Digital hard drive and the other has a Seagate hard drive. With the exception of the Maxtor 80GB, these hard drives are rarely accessed and are used solely as backups of backups. I have 3 internal hard drives where my regular backups take place.
