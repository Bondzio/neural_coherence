So the Final word is that my current Samsung SP0802N 80 GB hard disk is dying and I should get a new one and transfer all my data on it before it's too late.
Which new hard disk should I buy now.
And is there a drastic price difference between 80 GB and slightly higher capacity hard disks nowadays.
