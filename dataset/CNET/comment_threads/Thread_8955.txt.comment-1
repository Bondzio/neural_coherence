I have a Dell Dimension 4700 and it no longer boots up Windows XP.
After doing some research I learned that Maxtor hard drives have a high failure rate.
I have a Maxtor.
Return code 7 is bad.
I got return code 7.
I have a friend who said she has a CD that may find the hard drive but I thought I'd throw the question out to see what kind of advice I can get.
Thank you.
