i'm getting totally confused by all the different interfaces to monitors and tvs.
composite, component, dvi, hdmi, s video, and so on.
i have a dell 1705fp which i would like to use for watching cable tv.
the only connectors other than the power cable are the standard analog monitor (vga?
), a dvi connector, as well as usb connectors (it can be used as a hub).
the only video outputs on my present cable tv box is a single rca (composite?)
and an rs-232 (comm or serial port) type.
all other connectors (except audio) are std cable screw connectors.
can this monitor be used with some mashup of cables and/or adapters to feed the monitor?
if so, how?
