The USB design is such that you can short out all 4 pins and it will not fry the PC.
However there are always exceptions such as a board that ignored the USB design guide or those USB memory keys that contained a virus/trojan.
For some owners that USB virus/trojan does destroy the computer since the costs of reloading the OS exceed the price of a new PC (for some out there.)
