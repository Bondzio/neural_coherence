I've used a HP PSC 2175 for about 3 years on Win XP Pro,about 4 months ago switched over to Vista Ultimate SP1.
Until today my printer carried on printing as normal.
I'm not sure about scanning as I don't do very much of that, so haven't tried it since the switch to Vista.
This morning I wanted to print a document but got a message saying that I needed to install a printer before I could continue!
I looked in Control Panel&gt;Printers and sure enough there was nothing listed.
I tried re installing the drivers from my original disc but got the message saying OS not supported.
I went to HP's website to get updated driver only to find that the PSC 2175 isn't Vista supported.
Does anybody know why it worked for the past 4 months and if there is a fix that I can try, as I hadn't planned on buying a new printer yet.
Many thanks Mike7P.
