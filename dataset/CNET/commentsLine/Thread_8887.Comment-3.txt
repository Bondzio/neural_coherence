hi, thanks for replying.
they both run xp home.
the compaq 8000t is a build to order pentium 4 2.4 processor.
it has a.llot of the bells and whistles and is 2 years old.
the dell xps is two days old, it's a pentium 4 2.8 processor although it really has no extra ports in the back other than the dvi for the monitor and about 6 usb openings.
how do i know if they have a nick card - the compaq might very well.
i could email photos oth the backs of the pc's as they sit.
i just took some pictures because i just built this desk for the pc's and wired all last night.
thanks litegide24@yahoo.com
