Make sure all the PCs are identified with the same Workgroup name.
If the printer is connected to a PC (versus a print server port on the router/switch), you may need to be sure that each user has an account to which the printer is connected.
I used to have a router/switch with a printer port on it which meant any PC on the network could print to it at any time.
I replaced the printer and my new one only connects by USB to the PC.
I had to replace the R/S, and now the main PC has to be on for the others to be able to print.
