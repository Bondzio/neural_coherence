I boot up a LiveCD of any number of Linux versions.
While I prefer Knoppix, there is also PCLinuxOS and DSL that are worth trying to see if they see the files.
Since you are in some file/drive recovery mode you have to reveal the details.
For instance one person was trying to recover files from a NTFS formatted drive on a Windows 98se machine.
Oops.
In closing see if a demo of ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY sees the files from http://www.z-a-recovery.com/ sees it.
At that point this becomes an economic decision.
Are my files worth this much?
