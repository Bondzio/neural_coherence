I'm going to build a Media Center PC and I bought the Logitech Harmony 880 Universal Remote [ http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/remotes/universal_remotes/devices/372&cl=us,en ].
What is the best HDTV TV Tuner card to use?
I was told that I need to get a TV tuner card that comes with a remote and IR (infrared) receiver so that the Harmony 880 is able to control the functions for the Media Center PC.
Could someone please suggest a good HDTV tuner card that you've used or know of.
Thank You
