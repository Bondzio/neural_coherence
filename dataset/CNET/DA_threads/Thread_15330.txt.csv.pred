1.1.1	I have an almost 10 year old PC that I've kept limping along, but finally seems to have bit the dust.	St
1.1.2	It simply won't turn on.	St
1.1.3	A power supply failure is the most obvious reason; however, I never heard any noises coming from it nor did I get a burning smell.	St
1.1.4	Instead, over the past week on other occasions when it wouldn't power on, I simply unplugged the cord and plugged it back into a different outlet.	St
1.1.5	I did this successfully probably three different times.	St
1.1.6	So I'm wondering whether this sounds more like a power cord issue rather than the power supply.	St
1.1.7	Yes, I could simply purchase a new cord and try it out, but thought I'd ask first since I've never heard of a power cord not working.	St
1.1.8	By the way, I don't expect to keep using the PC, but it would be nice to access a few things that had not been backed up.	St
1.2.1	You probably have access to another AC cord, swap it your monitor one and retry again.	St
1.2.2	I rarely have any incidents of bad AC cords, far more bad PSUs.	St
1.2.3	Since, you mentioned a 10yr.	St
1.2.4	old system, well can be time to replace if you can find another similar PSU if not a better one should you want to repair.	St
1.2.5	As for accessing any data/files, remove the HD and mount in ext.	St
1.2.6	USB case and/or similar adapter in order to retrieve.	St
1.2.7	Google for ADA-2020 adapter or locate ext.	St
1.2.8	USB cases that match your HD requirements.	St
1.2.9	tada -----Willy	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the advice--it didn't occur to me to use the monitor power cord!	St
1.3.2	Unfortunately, that didn't work, so I believe it's the power supply.	St
