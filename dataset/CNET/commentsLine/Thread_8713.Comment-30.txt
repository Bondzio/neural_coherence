ok i have a plexiglas side, and when i see furry critters enjoying the coolness of my fans, which i might add are not shy to reproduce as soon as they can, i go into &quot;operation straw&quot;, yes ive tried compressed air canisters, but the liquid ice worries me more than the fuzz balls, so with just a thought i took a soda fountain straw and blew first into my video card fan and dudes i couldn't believe the chunks of built up fuzz i blew out, then i removed my cpu fan/heatsink repeated the straw procedure and i still don't know how much dust and fuzzy material can claim such a small area and not be noticed.
that said, i disassembled the psu casing and eek that's the mother ship for the reproduction of its fuzz invasion tactics, i strawed them to their nonexistence, smokers you may need to use caution as it takes a long hard exhale to make the straw a powerful force to rid the components of said fuzz/fod and lots if dust.
goodluck, &quot;bravo&quot;
