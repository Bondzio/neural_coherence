Hey friend, I have lost my BSNL DATAONE ADSL MODEM (UTStarcom UT 300R2U) installation CD. Two days back I have reformatted my computer harddisk and learned that I have lost my modem installation CD without which I will not be able to connect to internet. So anyone having the same model BSNL modem please do sent me the USB Driver installation software. Once again the model no: UT 300R2U Manufacturer: UTStarcom I have even searched the manufacturers webpages. It was not helpful and had even approached the customer center, which was of no use. I am in a critical situation. Please help me. reply on reach.anupprasad@gmail.com Thankyou. Anup.
