I have contacte the Belkin help desk, but, after three lengthy emails from them and having followed all their guidance, I still get no contact.
However, taking into account that the Belkin router will not work on either of my two computers (one is a MAC and the others a Windows XP) and also that my old router works perfectly on both, it seems likely too me that the router itself has a fault.
Rather than waste any more time on it, I have decided to cut my losses and dump the router!
Many thanks for you comments Gerald
