even without such, the signal barely works well at tens of meters in a drywall and wood house.
rain and concrete absorb the signal and you need to add range extenders such as  and antennas such as the cantenna (look it up on google.com).
what is worth writing is that the equipment is cheaper than having someone &quot;design&quot; and test out a possible solution... so place the wap or wifi-route on the dsl/cable modem, add extenders where needed.
