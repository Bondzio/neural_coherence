Followed all the instructions when loading the software. When I connect the cable into the USB port I get the following error message. &quot;cmdnist has caused an error in KRNL386.EXE cmdnist will now close. If you continue to experience problems, try restarting your computer.&quot; I have restarted my computer and no luck. I am running WindowsME on a Gateway. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Usually I find that some trojan/virus/spy has install a too-similar filename and has upset the OS. If that was a typo, then http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;q277994 is interesting and points to motherboard and USB driver issues.
