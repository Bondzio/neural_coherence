I have had a Dell Inspiron 1300 notebook for almost a year which I primarily use to surf the web and send and receive emails.
A few days ago I purchased Quicken Basic 2007 and installed it on the notebook.
At the end of the day when I close out my Quicken I'm prompted to back up my data.
I haven't backed it up yet but would like to do so.
On an old desktop PC I used floppies to back up my Quicken data.
This Dell notebook doesn't have a floppy drive but I could buy an external floppy drive to use to back up the Quicken data but are there other ways available to back up the data?
Easier; less expensive ways to back up the data?
