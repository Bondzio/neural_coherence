<s> I've been running an Asus P4P800S-X mobo, P4 2.4c, Saphire Radeon 9600 pro, for a little over a week now with not a single problem. </s>
<s> Yesterday, while I was plugging in a game controller into the front usb port, I heard a loud pop sound just as the plug touched the front usb panel. </s>
<s> The monitor went blank, but the computer fans still continued to run. </s>
<s> I then smelled a strong burning plastic odor and quickly shut down the computer. </s>
<s> I checked everything out and all seemed to be okay, so I thought maybe my monitor fried. </s>
<s> I tried to turn on the computer and got nothing. </s>
<s> No sounds, no lights, nothing. </s>
<s> I pulled out the mobo and found a very small chip,(about half the size of a grain of rice) on the mobo which is burnt. </s>
<s> It is black with some white powder residue on it. </s>
<s> It also discolored the board a little. </s>
<s> I tested the PSU and it seems to work fine. </s>
<s> What caused this to happen and how can I prevent it in the future? </s>
<s> What are the chances that other components may have also failed as a result of this? </s>
<s> That may be an unanswerable question. </s>
<s> However, it is likely (though by no means certain) that the plugging in of the game controller is not co-incidental. </s>
<s> First, replace the Mother Board, and come up with just memory, cpu/fan, ps, and Motherboard. </s>
<s> If you get the post single beep of success, add components 1 at a time and gradually put the machine back together. </s>
<s> Do not however add in the game controller. </s>
<s> Get a cheap USB card, and plug the game controller into that, or get another game controller, if it is bad, you don't want to fry another MotherBoard, now do you? </s>
<s> Consider replacing the USB receptacle on the case, as that may also be the source of a wiring fault. </s>
<s> I had the same problem, except I plugged in a headset in the front audio input. </s>
