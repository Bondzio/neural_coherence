<s> I am trying to find learning material for Decimal to Hex and Hex to Decimal conversion but cannot find any? </s>
<s> Is it simply the case i have to use a Binary conversion as a middle man? </s>
<s> Thanks All </s>
<s> http://www.wikihow.com/Convert-from-Decimal-to-Hexadecimal http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgVc1Tl-JDA The other way around, from hex to decimal is easier. </s>
<s> Last digit + 16 * previous digit + 256 * previous digit and so on. </s>
<s> So DEF hex = 15(F) + 16 * 14(E) + 256*13(D). </s>
<s> By the way, this is mathematics, not networking. </s>

<s> Hi Kees, Yes it is maths but the maths used in networking for M.A.C AND I.P address translation. </s>
<s> Thank you for your answer Paul </s>
