Hey have you guys seen the product they sell for repairing scratches in prescription glasses?
I have seen it advertised on TV here in the US and think I have seen it for sale in a national drug store chain.
Dont know if it will work as I have never tried it.
Just thought I would throw it at you as another option for you to look at.
