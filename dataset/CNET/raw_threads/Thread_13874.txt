It wasnt burning, but was still spinning and making noises like it was. I closed the application in the task manager, but the DVD player just kept humming like it was still burning. I shut down the computer, but the DVD player kept humming along and the computer wouldnt come to a full shut down. After a few mins, I unplugged the darn thing to get it to stop. Which it did. NOW my computer wont boot up. Just black screen. I am using Windows La Vista. I have a 2 month old custom built computer and this DVD-RW player is new as well. I'm at work using the computer to try to get some answers before I go home. Do you think unplugging the DVD ROM cables inside the computer would help and then trying to restart? With the thoughts that the DVD player is the culprit? I have another DVD player in the computer, so do you think it would boot from the La Vista CD and I could attempt a repair? I can usually fix problems if I can get a computer to turn on, but when I cant. Then I'm usually at a loss, as this appears to be a Hardware issue now, instead of a software issue. This is my computer: Jr P45-T2RS Motherboard , with a Intel Duo Core E8400 CPU, 4 gigs of DDR2 800 Memory, and an ATI 4500 Vid card I think it is.

Unplugging the offending DVD player and gonna try seeing if it will boot up now. Yes. It's a crazy homebrew put together with new and old pieces. I only kept the 2 SATA Hardrives and a DVD player..
