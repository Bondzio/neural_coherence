that &quot;i'm canadian, and proud!&quot;...but that would be a fib, john!
however, as far as i know, that is how they count letters up here (at least at the federal level).
it's also the way they count letters in several state and federal departments.
(i thought &quot;civics&quot; was a required subject when you went to school...) i don't believe there are any hard and fast rules as to how many &quot;points&quot; each letter counts for (10,000 seems to be a &quot;standard&quot; number)...but they do count for a lot more than one letter.
and, as i've said, it depends on the department and/or organization.
personally, i believe there are certain segments of government that wouldn't care how many letters we wrote.
(you weren't by any chance a postman...were you, john?)
