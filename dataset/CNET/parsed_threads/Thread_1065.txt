<s> You read correctly; as of the fourth quarter of this year, the brand known as ATI will no longer be present on any Radeon GPU's. </s>
<s> AMD did a survey earlier this year (in several countries); and found that people did not know the brand name ATI, though they did know both AMD and Radeon. </s>
<s> So AMD will be shipping all new GPU's under the name AMD Radeon http://blogs.amd.com/play/2010/08/30/evolving-the-amd-brand-portfolio/ Personally; I am sad to see the logo ATI go the way of the dinosaurs, as I have always bought ATI graphics (and purposely look for that logo), but will continue to purchase AMD Radeon graphics ( if they continue with great GPU's) </s>
<s> and, though drivers were sometimes shaky, the company stayed on top of things and got them fixed. </s>
<s> I always purchased the &quot;Real McCoy&quot; and not the partner products as well. </s>
<s> I don't game so don't care about extended features of graphics cards and don't load up on their software suites. </s>
<s> Just give me good solid and reliable performance and I'm happy. </s>
<s> To add to dinosaur brands, I'm also not happy that HP has taken over 3Com. </s>
<s> I bought their network cards from the days of 10base2 and Windows 3.1 for networks. </s>
<s> They always worked. </s>
<s> I do some volunteer work in a school and all the Ethernet switches are 3Com as are the wireless PoE components. </s>
<s> Never a failure of one device yet. </s>
<s> I've still got a box of 3Com 3C905 series boards that I use when MB Ethernet circuits fail. </s>
<s> Most of these are USA or Ireland made. </s>
<s> They always work. </s>
<s> My home network, wired and wireless, is all 3Com. </s>
<s> I just don't have problems. </s>
<s> I'm concerned that HP will kill the the brand. </s>
