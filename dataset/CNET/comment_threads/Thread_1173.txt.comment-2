because you can connect two of your computers to the modem.. which I suspect that your modem is also a router...
If so, then You should disable the DHCP on the new router (WRT54G) OR you may configured them for using different range of IP address... Also, you may try to connect your Modem router to the WRT54G WAN port or LAN port.
