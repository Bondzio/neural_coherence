there is no Win2k driver for your NIC if the manufacturer does not list one.
TWhen a new device is developed, they do not always write drivers for older OSs.
You should be able to find a PCMCIA ethernet adapter for which there is a Win2k driver -- if you have that slot available.
I would expect, however, that a driver could be found for your firewire.
After all, that was around when Win2k was a pup.
Hope this helps Frank
