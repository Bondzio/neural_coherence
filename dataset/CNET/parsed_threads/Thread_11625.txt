<s> Hello, I have a win CE 6, 7&quot; laptop. </s>
<s> at first i couldnt get online (ie). </s>
<s> i got sent a file to install from the sd card, and it now works fine - except that when using it to browse the web, for no reason i can see, on random pages, it just suddenly goes off the internet and connects itself to the local intranet...meaning i cant view webpages - as i am just a personal user and dont actually have an intranet at all... its not certain sites or pages...because its never the same ones, sometimes i can see a page sometimes i can't... any ideas how i can disable the intranet function entirely or stop this happening? </s>
<s> i cannot click on the icon, and there just doesnt seem to be anyway to stop it...if i hit the back button, it goes back online...if i need to look at a page and it wont let me, if i just keep trying over and over it will eventually let me stay online to see it...but then go off at another random page. </s>
<s> this are just normal sites like facebook, yahoo, etc. </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> Time to get it back to the maker or seller. </s>
<s> Unlike Windows this version is pretty locked down. </s>

<s> Windows CE machines are unlike your common PCs. </s>
<s> There are no user serviceable parts and we can't change the OS. </s>

<s> I can only guess you are new to Windows Mobile/CE. </s>
<s> I'm just a programmer (and more) and took the classes and seminars on Windows Mobile, Embedded XP and more. </s>
<s> As I am not the person who created this image, I can't do much other than help you learn a bit about this issue. </s>
