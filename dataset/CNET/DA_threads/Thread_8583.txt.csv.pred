1.1.1	I bought a computer from my good friend .	St
1.1.2	Before i bought the computer , he had hard drive problems so he had given it in and got a new hard drive for it .	St
1.1.3	It 's definitely not a hard drive problem .	St
1.1.4	I think its most definitely a driver problem because i had the same problem with the modem yesterday , i just needed to get on another computer , and download the drivers for it .	St
1.1.5	But that was a different story because i knew what type of modem i have .	St
1.1.6	This time , i can go to device manager , and it will be under & quot ; other devices & quot ; named Video Controller ( VGA Compatible ) .	St
1.1.7	Along with it in the & quot ; other devices column , is Multimedia Audio Controller and Ethernet Controller .	St
1.1.8	I can type in & quot ; dxdiag & quot ; into Run and go to display , and beside name and chip type and all of that are just & quot ; n/a & quot ; .	St
1.1.9	I have no idea what 's going on here at all ?	Ques
1.1.10	Do i really have no video card ?	Ques
1.2.1	For most it 's Windows .	St
1.2.2	The stock install from Microsoft needs motherboard drivers before some video cards are detected .	St
1.3.1	Well , i just updated the motherboard drivers , still no change .	St
1.3.2	Here 's all my information that i DO have .	St
1.3.3	( Sorry that i did n't include it before ) Operating System : Windows XP : Home Edition RAM : 2542 MB Processor : Intel ( R ) Pentium ( R ) 4 CPU 3.00GHz ( w CPUs ) System Model : D65GBH ( it 's a custom computer put together at the store ) Also just discovered it ca n't detect the sound card either .	St
1.3.4	or the ethernet controller so it 's most definitely a driver problem	St
1.4.1	Sorry but no reason to duplicate efforts .	St
1.4.2	Continuing at http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-6122_102-0.html ? forumID=44 & threadID=280507 & messageID=2682900	St
