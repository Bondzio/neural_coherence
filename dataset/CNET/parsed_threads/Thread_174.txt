<s> Is there a way of resetting a DVD or DVD Burner to it's original option of 5 region changes? </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated </s>
<s> Is when someone updated the firmware in the DVD. </s>
<s> Usually it's the end of the line for the drive. </s>

<s> I have found on the net some progs that reset the Region Change counter to the default 5. </s>
<s> It did work on my friends system. </s>
<s> The drive was either a LG or Samsung DVD drive. </s>
<s> Search the net, you may be lucky. </s>
<s> If firmware upgrade will reset it, then does it mean that when the change counter touches 5, I can get away with a repeat upgrade with the same firmware version? </s>
