<s> My computer currently has two hard drives; 8MB (master) & 2MB (slave). </s>
<s> I removed the 2MB drive and tried to install a new 13.6MB drive. </s>
<s> I plugged the IDE cable labeled &quot;slave&quot; and the power cable into my new hard drive, and when I turned on my computer it failed to boot. </s>
<s> It says it cannot detect a master drive. </s>
<s> What happened? </s>
<s> I never even touched the master hard drive! </s>
<s> P.S. </s>
<s> I'm running Windows XP. </s>
<s> Have you set the jumper on the drive to slave? </s>
<s> Check the jumpers on the 13.6 hard drive to verify that it is set to slave. </s>
<s> Usually the hard drive casing will have instructions etched or labeled as to the correct setting for the jumpers. </s>
