are you running your web page/site out of your home?
is your site a dsn?
is it hosted?
do you have to route through a ip?
questions about telephony on your site are you talking about telephony or tell a phony?
if telephony can this technology be used to improve an ip connection?
i was tinkering with this some time ago seems like it should be able to increase the link speed.
i was running a 56k connection at the time currently i'd using dsl.
i'm pretty sure it will not work with dsl because of multiplexing.
isn't there a link between it and hyperthread technologies?
