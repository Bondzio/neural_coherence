<s> My router seems to be loosing the connection. </s>
<s> We have one computer hooked through a cable modem and it works fine but two others, one by cable cord and one wireless through a wireless broadband router don't receive a connection. </s>
<s> My laptop wireless card doesn't recognize any connection at all. </s>
<s> I have noticed that the router gets really hot, which I don't think is normal. </s>
<s> Whether that has anything to do with my problem I don't know but I was told to contact you, the manafacturer, to see what if anything can be done to correct the problem. </s>
