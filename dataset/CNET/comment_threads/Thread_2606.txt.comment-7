sorry for the very late reply.
Yea canon printers use mostly dye based inks so they don't run into the clogging issues that you get with Epson.
Lexmark printers are so so.
Even with getting new printheads each time I've heard of people still having problems.
And when I worked at Staples I saw more problems w/ Lexmark print quality than w/ Canon.
It is such a same to see the decline in recent quality of Epson products.
I have an Epson cx3200 all in one and it is working great.
Clogs up every now and then but nothing permanent and I've had it for about 3 years now.
