1.1.1	i can get a x800 xt platinum edition ( agp ) for $ 230 , is this a good deal ?	Ques
1.1.2	oh and the product number is 100-435508 the pci is $ 300	St
1.2.1	as the ati x300 , x700 , x800s do not support sm3.0 or fp32 .	St
1.3.1	the prices for the following are dropping pretty fast : GeForce 6800GT for $ 374 CAD ( $ 311 USD ) http : //www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp ? EdpNo=1211889 & CatId=0 or Radeon X800XL for $ 310 CAD ( $ 257 USD ) http : //www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp ? EdpNo=1476859 & CatId=0 both are getting cheaper by the day , but is the GeForce worth the extra $ 64 ?	Ques
1.4.1	as it supports sm3 and fp32 which is needed for future games .	St
1.4.2	if u go circuit city the geforce6800gt is only 290usd but i 'm not sure if its still at that price ... think the rebate expired today or something	St
1.5.1	Thanks for the info , il go with the newer ones	St
1.6.1	some guy on the gamespot forums said that the GeForce is not worth it ...	St
1.6.2	I guess it all depends on the games that are going to come out	St
1.7.1	it 's already known that SM3.0 is going to be a requirement of upcoming games the FP precision thing has n't been an issue for ATi , and probably wo n't be for a long time ( i 'm guessing the game will be overall too demanding/beyond the card 's overall ability before the FP issue arises ) but SM3.0 is going to be a part of upcoming games because it 's a part of current games ( Half-Life 2 and FarCry can use it , and do use it on GeForce 6 cards ) my take is basically this : if your fine buying a $ 300- $ 500 card that you already KNOW will have issues with games due to lack of feature support , go for it , just know that you have to upgrade sooner me personally , I can not justify purchase of a $ 300- $ 600 card that wo n't support things I want it to support in the future i 'd rather be able to play the game at the settings I like 6800GT allows that , I do n't feel that if i 'm spending a fair deal of my hard earned money that I should have to compromise just to say I have a different brand or to get 2-3 % higher in a benchmark	St
1.8.1	I think I will maybe get the 6800GT when it drops even lower but what is fp32 ?	Ques
