I am looking at possibly replacing my NetGear 7230 since it seems to &quot;choke&quot; after too much use. I like the &quot;content filtering&quot; subscription the router allows since I can keep my family from stumbling on certain sites. I did purchase another router that claimed it supported content filtering, but that required entry of each site. I am definitely NOT doing that. Do any other consumer-grade routers support this? I have used a SonicWall SOHO for a several years, but their annual fee for content filtering was much too high for my usage. Brad

See if the WRT54G with the upgrade addresses this. http://lifehacker.com/software/router/hack-attack-turn-your-60-router-into-a-600-router-178132.php As to the 'choke', if I see a router do that I update the firmware and make sure it's not buried under a pile of trash (heat kills). If that doesn't do it, it goes back. Bob

Consider purchasing a SonicWALL TZ150. You should be able to purchase the firewall and the cfs for about the same cost as the SOHO for the first year. The follow-on years should run you about $120 per year. Let me know if you need additional details.

I don't love my NetGear, but it works for about $30 per year for CFS. Does the TZ150 limit the number of users? That was a real annoyance with my SOHO unit. Brad

The unit is also outside the warranty period. I did purchase a NETGEAR WPNT834 RangeMax 4-Port Switch 240 Mbps MIMO 802.11g/b Wireless Router, since I found it for around $75 (which may have been an error). I will see if that works any better, though having a spare is not a bad idea either. Brad
