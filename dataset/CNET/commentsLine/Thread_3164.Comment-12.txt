in your other thread my colleague grif suggested loading drivers from another cd.
and you mentioned something about using a dell disc to load the os to an hp cd.
so you should mention much more detail on what exactly you did.
maybe better start a new thread in computer help, because clearly this is - as you already stated yourself - a new problem.
