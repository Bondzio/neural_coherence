well the reason I ask is, I am afraid of the consequences of screwing it up.
(I am reasonably experienced but I've never done this particular task before, and many people [and BIOS websites] have told me NOT to do it if not absolutely necessary) I guess if the power stays on it should be okay.
are there any tricks to it other than reading the instructions?
will a BIOS upgrade allow me to use bigger than 30 GB drives?
(which I currently cannot use?)
I have a SOYO 6BA+ and a 6BA +III.
fyi, tiger direct sells 30 gb seagates for about $60.
THANKS fj
