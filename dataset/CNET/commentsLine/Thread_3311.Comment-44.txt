couple of things to add?
is that the corsir valueram or xms, xms pro or whatever?
if you can afford it, skip the valueram, go the xms at least.
one with the cas 2 is preferable as well, although you will prob find it will only run at 2.5cl on the amd rig.
another point to make is, try and get the newer seagate hdd's with the ncq feature, this improves hdd performance when used with a compatible mobo.
the nforce4 is the first new generation chipset to support it.
and seagate only recently released the ncq drives, and it seems many retailers still have old stock of the non-ncq drives.
(or at least here in australia, thats true.)
hope it all goes well with the building process, would be great if you could also report back here on how it went and any probs enountered.
happy sys building!!!
