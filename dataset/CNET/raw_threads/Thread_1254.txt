The problem is this...I am currently running dual monitors and the 2 slots that come out of the back of my graphics card are taken up (one slot for each monitor). I used to have an HD cable running from my tower to my TV when I ran one monitor...but I don't want to sacrifice dual monitor viewing. Is there another option, for instance is there some sort of 2 to 1 adapter I can plug into one of the tower slots that will allow a monitor plug in as well as a tower to TV cable? Basically, the two slots that are HD capable in the back of my computer tower are occupied and I don't want to sacrifice dual-monitors. How can I run HD from my tower to HDTV to have my TV show whatever is on the computer monitor? I currently have win xp but this shouldnt matter Thanks.
