i would suggest that you check to see how much space the new upgrade requires as to what the total space you have on your hard drive.
it just simply may be too large for your existing drive.
if that is the case there are only two possible solutions - 1) upgrade to a larger version of the powerbbook which will have a much larger hard drive.
2) get an apple repairmnan to see if he can install a larger hard drive for you that would have room for your new os 10.2 and the other material you plan to use on the hard drive and then get a portable disk drive, such as a lacie (200 gb or less) disk drive, to carry with you to store your material on which you are working.
most of these use either (or both) a usb / usb-2 connector or some use a firewire connector if your computer will accept it.
fire wire is usually faster.
you may need a usb hub if you have only one usb outlet on the side of your powerbook.
good luck in your project.
