since most flash drives come in fat32 format, some glitches apply.
how big is the file being tried to save?
even, if the file is smaller than 4gb, it may allocate a larger size in order to fulfill the final total of needs.
save, all your data and try this.
once that is done, reformat the flash drive to ntfs format and that should help greatly handle large files or data transfers to storage.
i found even 3gb+ sizes can cause problems.
