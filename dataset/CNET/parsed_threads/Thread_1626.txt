<s> One of my old PCs finally died a while back, and the other day I received a replacement I ordered online, which uses Win2kPro. </s>
<s> Unfortunately it didn't come with a modem installed. </s>
<s> I installed a &quot;NetoDragon 56k Voice Modem&quot;, but am for some reason unable to connect to the internet using MSN 8. </s>
<s> I installed MSN 8 and chose &quot;I've already signed up&quot;, and was immediately greeted with the following error message; &quot;We're sorry, we cannot sign you up for MSN because there is a problem with your computer or the MSN service. </s>
<s> Please try again later.&quot; The driver for the modem is installed, and I can use the &quot;Internet Connection Wizard&quot; which successfully connects to the &quot;Microsoft Internet Referral Service&quot;, so apparently the modem is working. </s>
<s> I've never had to install a modem on a computer, having had them already installed when I bought them, and thus have absolutely no idea what to do here. </s>
<s> Can anyone help with this problem? </s>
<s> Note: If you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem. </s>
<s> My first guess is that Windows 2000 isn't properly installed. </s>
<s> Try installing the latest motherboard chipset drivers. </s>
<s> I copied the forum note since without those details I can't be more specific. </s>

<s> Operating System: Windows 2000 Professional (Says Windows 98SE on the case) Model: Case says it is a &quot;Compaq Deskpro EN&quot;. </s>
<s> Under system properties it says; System Microsoft Windows 2000 5.00.2195 Service Pack 4 Computer x86 family 6 model 8 stepping 3 AT/AT COMPATIBLE 261,552 KB RAM </s>
<s> Compaq make hundreds of that model line. </s>
<s> It's not specific enough to find the drivers but you can try compaq.com Bob </s>
<s> I managed to find and download the drivers for the chipset, which had no effect. </s>
<s> Any other ideas? </s>
<s> I don't know the details of the machine so I'm going to call it a dead modem. </s>
<s> Try another. </s>

<s> I had already tried three different modems, all had the same result. </s>
<s> But it seems there was never any problem with the modem to begin with. </s>
<s> After a bit of digging, I managed to find an old trial CD for a different ISP, and installed it. </s>
<s> It worked. </s>
<s> I was able to connect to the internet, and visit websites without any errors. </s>
<s> I used the guest sign-in feature in MSN 8 after going online, and that even worked. </s>
<s> Apparently the problem is on MSN's end, not mine. </s>
<s> Even while connected to the internet, the sign-up wizard was saying I was offline. </s>
<s> Now all I have to do is hope MSN customer service doesn't put me on hold and forget about me.. again. </s>
<s> But the forums work best when the forum notes are followed. </s>
<s> The make/model helps everyone give the best answers. </s>
