<s> Ok, well I have a Dell Dimension 3000 and I am considering a low budget upgrade of the graphics card. </s>
<s> Specs: 2.8Ghz Intel Pentium 4 1 GB RAM Intel Extreme Graphics 2 Windows XP Professional Service Pack 3 No AGP slot, only PCI slots available for upgrade First of all, I am wondering whether the FX5500 actually gives a better performance than Intel Extreme Graphics 2. </s>
<s> Secondly, I want to know if the FX5500 can support widescreen (16:9) resolutions, as the Intel integrated graphics cannot. </s>
<s> My monitor has a native resolution of 1600x900. </s>
<s> Currently I'm using this monitor at a resolution of 1024x768, where I have 2 black stripes down either side of the screen Thirdly, I've heard it's an absolute pain to get a dedicated graphics card to work properly when there is an integrated graphics chip already on the motherboard - if I simply disable to integrated graphics through device manager, is that not sufficient? </s>
<s> Oh, and one last issue. </s>
<s> Will the 250W PSU be able to handle the extra power that's drawn by this new graphics card? </s>
<s> But having used both those cards I can write the neither were acceptable. </s>
<s> The 5500 had issues that I never found resolved and the Extreme was not well done either. </s>
<s> Look around for anything else. </s>

<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Someone said I should use a Radeon HD 5450 available on a PCI interface, which was launched recently. </s>

<s> Do you reckon this would be better than my current one? </s>
<s> You have stepped into today's cards. </s>
<s> While the 5450 is not acceptable to gamers, it's about as far as you can go on PCI. </s>
