i'm not sure there is a simple answer.
last year i purchased 10 1tb drives to augment my 60 hd farm.
so far 4 have failed within the year.
prior to the 1tb drives i purchased my largest drive was a 500gb (i have several of these).
i'll be moving to the 2tb drives early next year but my biggest suggestions are (1) buy the drives with the longest warranty (some have 5 years) (2) backup, backup, backup (3) make sure the drives are running cool (i try to keep my drives below 90 degrees) very few external enclosures will keep your drives cool.
i currently have 10 3.5&quot; drives in my tower, i cut the heck out of the front and installed 3 120mm fans (pushing air across all drives) and one 120mm fan in the back (pulling air out of the case).
i have a friend that uses nothing but 2.5&quot; drives and he has very low drive failure.
btw out of my 60 hd farm i lost 6 drives.
