The printer I have now is an HP1215 PSC three in one, this model does not carry out OCR. Adnan

Proffitt	12/15/07 2:59 PM	1.19773074E12	How to find such a thing.	http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&q=ReadIRIS+BUNDLE+2007 Now go through those and see if those units meet your requirements. I can write that today few to none of the consumer models at the store have OCR since the consumer seems to have cooled on that being something they want. Maybe you'll have to add it later. Bob
