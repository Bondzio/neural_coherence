i'm afraid that i must differ with donna somewhat on this issue.
it's not that any of us necessarily want to deprive others, but let's face facts.
there are evil people out there that given the chance, will do things with your unsecured bandwidth, that most of us would probably not approve of.
as bob so correctly points out, when these people do the evil things that they will do with your unsecured bandwidth, the fine folks with the black suits and sun glasses, will show up on your doorstep, and you will be the poor sucker sitting in a windowless room answering unpleasant questions.
sure, the feds will eventually figure out that you had nothing to do with said federal felony, but why expose yourself to the aggrivation, when reasonable wireles security is not that hard to implement?
