But, unfortunately, it's still best to disconnect the other drive and not let Windows see it.
You'll need to open the case and remove the power and data cables.
Save what you can to an external if you have one.
The reason you don't want the dying on in there with a fresh installation is that Windows will still be accessing it and probably begin complaining about read errors and such.
