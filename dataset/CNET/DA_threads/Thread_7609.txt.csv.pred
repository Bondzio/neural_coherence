1.1.1	Hello!	St
1.1.2	I have a problem, I asked before but maybe I was not very clear.	St
1.1.3	So I have a shared Laser jet 2600n printer on XP based computer, but when I try to connect my Vista based laptop, it gives this error : &quot;Windows cannot connect to printer.	St
1.1.4	the local spooler service is not running.	St
1.1.5	Please restart the spooler or restart the machine&quot;.	St
1.1.6	I dont know even what is spooler.	St
1.1.7	Thank you for your help	St
1.2.1	The discussion in http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7813_102-0.html?forumID=133&threadID=269580&messageID=2766942 might be very helpful.	St
1.2.2	It's about the same printer.	St
1.2.3	If it doesn't help, try the many other ways I found in: http://www.vistax64.com/vista-networking-sharing/16978-spooler-error-windows-cannot-connect-shared-printer-xp-pro.html http://forums.microsoft.com/TechNet/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=1275803&SiteID=17 http://www.vistax64.com/vista-installation-setup/106482-need-help-problem-adding-printer.html Many different ways, and they worked with some and not with others.	St
1.2.4	It's unclear, to say the least.	St
1.2.5	Hope this helps.	St
