you will need at least 512mb of video/graphics memory (dedicated or &quot;shared&quot;) in order to play hd video.
those integrated graphics chips with 256mb of video memory are simply gutless when it comes to rendering high-def video smoothly.
therefore, you must add a video card that can handle it.
check out something like the msi hd4550 (an ati radeon model).
it's passively cooled so no extra noise from a fanm and it has 1gb of video memory.
cost is around $39.99, but we got a mail-in rebate for $20 back so it was a heck of a deal.
good luck.
