Using 3 HP computers - one Desktop PC and two laptops.
Trying to share one printer, an HP PSC 1350V all in one.
Using a Netgear PS121 Mini-Print Server and all the computers are also hooked into a Netgear FVS318 VPN.
All the computers can send things to the printer with no problem, but need to have bi-directional capability for scans.
Any suggestions?
