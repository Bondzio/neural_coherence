if its just flickering reduce the hertz to 60 and see if that works right click on desk top, then properties,then setting,advanced, monitor.
there you should see screen refreshing rate.
set it at 60 hertz and see if it helps.
when it starts blacking out you will know because after about 1 minute when the computer turns on the monitor will blackout
