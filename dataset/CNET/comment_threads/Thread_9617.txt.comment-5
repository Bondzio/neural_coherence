I need space and good graphics because I do game a lot and use space.
I download programs that take up much space and a fast processor would be very good too.
At least 100GB would give me a lot to work with and since I share this with my brother I need the floppy drive.
On top of that I also download videos and music and use my computer to do all my school work (projects, homework, etc.)
