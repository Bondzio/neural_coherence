One question is what processor do you have?
If it is a Celeron or Sempron then you may have your computer needing more processing power which isn't the same as speed.
The idea with more memory is that for memory-intensive tasks things may be done in shorter time.
Generally I don't think it'll seem that much faster.
As for the 1486 MB recommended allocation this is likely due to windows wanting 1.5 times the physical RAM which is common.
I have 2 GB of RAM and windows recommends I have 3069 MB of virtual memory that just seems unnecessary to me so I have it set to 0.
