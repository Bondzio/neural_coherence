1.2.12	Thanks	Polite
1.3.1	Generally speaking ... laptops do n't 'breathe ' or expel heat as well a desktops so making sure vents are NOT blocked during use is critical .	St
1.3.2	Using a laptop on your lap , on a pillow or sitting on a bed often blocks the vents that help laptops breathe .	St
1.3.3	Laptop coolers ... .flat surfaces with fan can also help .	St
1.3.4	Another thing ... .dust often builds up inside laptops and dramatically reduces their ability to stay cool ... .a little compressed air can help eliminate some of that .	St
1.3.5	Having enough system RAM and free hard disk space also helps .	St
1.3.6	VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	That is , clean it out and replace the CPU heat sink compound ?	Ques
1.4.2	It 's an older machine so why not do the usual maintenance ?	Ques
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	How do I get info on changing the heat sink compound ... ie : opening up the laptop ... looks like a lot of tiny screws on the bottom ... .do they all just come out and the bottom pops off ?	Ques
1.5.2	Thanks	Polite
1.6.1	so Disk should be fine..I use the laptop on a flat desk in a generally cooler room ... .	St
1.6.2	I'lll check the venting ... thanks	Polite
1.7.1	compartment for dust bunnies .	St
1.7.2	Might also try installing PCWizard ... .download it , run it and minimize it ... .it will show a series of system temps in the upper right hand corner of the screen .	St
1.7.3	It could help tell you whether it 's a computer component temp problem or not .	St
1.7.4	Keep us posted how it works out .	St
1.7.5	VAPCMD	St
1.8.1	While it may not be this exact laptop , after you have worked on a few they begin to look the same .	St
1.8.2	From your reply this laptop is not being maintained .	St
1.8.3	That is , it was not getting a blast of canned air on the vents every 6 months or even yearly .	St
1.8.4	CNET has a video about cleaning and it looks like a Thinkpad in the video .	St
1.8.5	Here 's the link - & gt ; http : //reviews.cnet.com/4520-3121_7-6679060-1.html Try that and if that does n't help , move to the heat sink replacement .	St
1.8.6	It 's only a few dollars for the compound and I ca n't look for the specific model Thinkpad ( no model number in the posts I could find ) so here 's one of many - & gt ; http : //support.lenovo.com/en_US/product-and-parts/detail.page ? & amp ; LegacyDocID=MIGR-71805 Bob	Ques
1.9.1	Aside from the wonderful hints above , ( as overheating would cause the laptop to do this ) I would try to verify that the laptops are good and clean with anti-virus and anti-rootkit software .	St
1.9.2	If it was just one laptop , sure I could see the above being true more so , but for both laptops ( not out of the question ) shutting down ?	Ques
1.9.3	I am sure you must share files ?	Ques
1.9.4	music perhaps ?	Ques
1.9.5	I just start with easy then dig inside .	St
1.9.6	The difference in hardware also supports my decision .	St
