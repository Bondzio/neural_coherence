It seems to have descent specs and I found it under $400. My goal is to buy a new pc to use as a home media center. I want something with a dual or quad core, good speed, over 2 GB memory, plenty of hard drive space, etc. Do you think this is a good reliable pc? Or do you recommend something else? Thanks for any suggestions and/or advice. Justin

Someone I know had a Vostro and he liked it. p.s. also check the Asus EEE net/notebooks, HP net/notebooks and DELL net/notebooks.
