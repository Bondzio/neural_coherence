If you are going to be compensated then you will need to have receipts anyway.
Replace the power supply and see if anything else is destroyed.
You can do this yourself or take it to a shop.
Fortunately, I have seen many instances of power supplies dying without any other damage, but it is impossible to know for sure until you have checked it out.
