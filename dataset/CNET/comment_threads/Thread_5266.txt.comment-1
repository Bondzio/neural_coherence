I have bougt a marine monitor 10.4&quot; 640 x 480 pixels (VGA).
The navigation software I'm using require a resolution of minimum 800 x 600 pixels.
I have tried to &quot;cheat&quot; the software by changing the resolution after I have started the software.
But then it is not possible to see the whole screen picture.
I have Windows XP.
Is there a software or a hardware that can solve this problem
