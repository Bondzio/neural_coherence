St
1.1.2	www.extreme.outervision.com	St
1.2.1	I tried it and it does n't account for power supply derating or & quot ; lies & quot ; .	St
1.2.2	Tomshardware.com wrote about the label issue where a 450 Watt PSU could only muster 400 or less Watts under load .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	February 8 , 2006 The following changes were made : - added System Type : Single or Dual CPU - added Alphacool AP1510 Pump - added Asetek WaterChill Xtreme Pump - added Danger Den CSP-MAG Pump - added Danger Den DDC-12V - added Danger Den DD12V-D5 - added Innovatek Eheim HPPS Plus Pump - added Laing DDC-1 12V Pump - added Laing DDC-2 12V Pump - added Swiftech MCP 655 Pump - added Koolance Aquian ICM Water Cooling Kit - added Swiftech H20-220 Apex Ultra Water Cooling Kit - added Thermaltake CL-W0020 Tribe Water Cooling Kit - added Thermaltake CL-W0052 TideWater Water Cooling Kit Video Cards update will be released next week !	St
1.3.2	www.extreme.outervision.com	St
1.4.1	Here 's why .	St
1.4.2	It does not take in account the power supply age or the issues such as the label that claims 500 Watts but never delivers such as http : //www.tomshardware.com/2005/07/11/stress_test/ Your calculator only makes matters worse since you will lull users into thinking their 300 or such Watt power supply is enough .	St
1.4.3	Why not put a little more effort into this ?	Ques
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	I keyed in the same profile on three other PSU calculators and this one was the lowest .	St
1.5.2	One even had as much as 90w more required .	St
1.5.3	I 'd stay away from this one !	St
1.5.4	and life goes on ... Jack	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	& quot ; I keyed in the same profile on three other PSU calculators and this one was the lowest & quot ; - because it is the most accurate calculator available .	St
1.7.2	mnemonik23	St
1.8.1	If I 'll put a little more effort into collecting labels from all PSUs available - I probably need another life or so I do not lull users - it is their responsibility to find out about PSU they want to buy , read reviews , etc .	St
1.8.2	- my tool just calculates the recommended watts .	St
1.8.3	It is impossible to predict in such tool which PSU has real 500W ( for example ) or not .	St
1.8.4	Also it is impossible to collect the information about all the PC components power consumption by 3.3V , 5V and 12V rails because not all companies provide it to the public ( video cards for example ) .	St
1.8.5	At least I warn people that amperage is more important than watts ...	St
1.9.1	February 15 , 2006 Version 1.3 of eXtreme PSU Calculator has been released !	St
1.9.2	The following changes were made : - updated Video Cards power consumption based on real 3D tests - added Video Type : Single Crad , SLI or Crossfire - added 9 overclocked Video Cards - added ATI Radeon X700 Pro - added ATI Radeon X800 GT - added Chrome S25 - added Chrome S27 - added NVIDIA GeForce 7800 GS AGP - added NVIDIA Quadro FX 4500 - added CPU Utilization based on TDP - updated SCSI Hard Drives Stay tuned , a few major updates and tools are coming !	St
1.9.3	One of them is a nice surprise ( we hope ) for Liquid Cooling enthusiasts ; ) www.extreme.outervision.com	St
1.10.1	I 'm doing this to purposely rile you into action .	St
1.10.2	I 've seen many power calculators but yours is the worst offender so far .	St
1.10.3	It will create far too many machines that will be unstable and possible even smoke parts .	St
1.10.4	Sorry to pan your efforts so harshly , but having replaced 100 's of PSUs over the years due to such & quot ; calculators & quot ; , I will not be accepting of a calculator that misses the mark by such a wide margin .	St
1.10.5	Bob	St
1.11.1	Strange ... Sites like TomsHardware , DFI and many others recommend this calculator , not any other ones .	St
1.11.2	And it 's funny because real PC tech people called my calculator as & quot ; overestimator & quot ; before because it had overhead by 10-30 % Now almost 90 % of the components have an accurate wattage .	St
1.11.3	& quot ; I 've seen many power calculators but yours is the worst offender so far .	St
1.11.4	It will create far too many machines that will be unstable and possible even smoke parts. & quot ; It 's a very strong statement .	St
1.11.5	What makes you think that those calculators are more accurate than my ?	Ques
1.11.6	Can you provide me with some real numbers for any particular components and why do you think that mine are not correct ?	Ques
1.11.7	Because somebody created a PSU calculator 5 years ago and rest of the & quot ; creators & quot ; just copied his code does n't mean that they have a perfect tool to estimate watts .	St
1.11.8	Let 's discuss it .	St
1.11.9	I 've spent 2 years studying PC components , it will be fun & quot ; Sorry to pan your efforts so harshly , but having replaced 100 's of PSUs over the years due to such & quot ; calculators & quot ; , I will not be accepting of a calculator that misses the mark by such a wide margin. & quot ; You see , I 'm not telling people to go and buy 500W PSU of some made_in_the_basemnet_of_zanzibar brand .	St
1.11.10	As I mentioned in of my previous respond - user is MUST check what is he buying ! ! !	St
1.11.11	For God 's sake - there are tons of online forums , reviews , guides , sites that explain about power supplies .	St
1.11.12	I bet most of those 100 's PSUs died because of amperage lack on a particular rail .	St
1.11.13	More likely 12V .	St
1.11.14	But I do warn people on my website that amperage is more important than watts .	St
1.11.15	Well , you can call this the worst calculator known .	St
1.11.16	It 's your opinion but I respect it .	St
1.11.17	Regards , mnemonik23	St
1.12.1	I keyed in my system at 100 % utilization with my new X1300Pro and it said 223 watts .	St
1.12.2	The sad thing is my vid card did n't even run on a 300watt psu .	St
1.12.3	I had to buy a 450watt to run my system .	St
1.12.4	This calculator is very deceptive .	St
1.12.5	Since there are so many other variables that are not considered in determining wattage needed , such as PSU quality , then this calculator does n't serve its purpose .	St
1.12.6	& quot ; The eXtreme PSU Calculator is provided as-is and we shall not be responsible for any kind of harm , physical defects , equipment damage and other loss or damages as result of using this utility .	St
1.12.7	We do not warrant or guarantee the accuracy , completeness , correctness , timeliness or usefulness of any information provided .	St
1.12.8	Use at your own risk. & quot ; Then what does it accomplish ?	Ques
1.12.9	?	Ques
1.13.1	It also notes it depends on the +12V rail .	St
1.13.2	READ CAREFULLY .	St
1.13.3	Your crappy 300watt probably did n't have the amps for all the devices on the rail .	St
1.13.4	Roger	St
1.14.1	ok , please read the labels on your PSUs and ansfer to this : how much ampers was on your 300W PSU for 12V rail and how much new one has ?	Ques
1.15.1	I think we 're riling the web site 's author about this , but to tout that you can pick a power supply by wattage is incorrect .	St
1.15.2	So far this site only makes matters worse as it does n't do a good job of telling that you need so many Amperes on each supply leg but reports Watts .	St
1.15.3	All power supplies degrade with time and that 's not in the mix either .	St
1.15.4	Bob	St
1.16.1	Bob , you can skip this part and go directly to & quot ; TO STOP ALL SPECULATIONS & quot ; section .	St
1.16.2	-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Just talking , declining everything , now facts , no answers , everything is bad , getting worse , etc. , etc .	St
1.16.3	Now you blame it because & quot ; it does n't do a good job of telling that you need so many Amperes on each supply leg & quot ; .	St
1.16.4	I answered you before - it is impossible to do unless all companies will release the power consumption information for their components .	St
1.16.5	OR somebody ( like some of the existing calculators ) will fake it up .	St
1.16.6	Again , for those who still do n't get it : Calculator just estimates a recommended total amount of watts .	St
1.16.7	It DOES NOT SAY : buy a 500W PSU which costs $ 20 bucks with 10A on 12V rail and made God knows where ( I 'll probably add a note about this on my site ) .	St
1.16.8	TO STOP ALL SPECULATIONS : ========================= 1 .	St
1.16.9	Buy a Kill-A-Watt monitor ( around $ 20- $ 25 ) .	St
1.16.10	2 .	St
1.16.11	Plug your PC power cord into Kill-A-Watt monitor .	St
1.16.12	3 .	St
1.16.13	Plug Kill-A-Watt monitor into wall outlet .	St
1.16.14	4 .	St
1.16.15	Turn ON your PC .	St
1.16.16	5 .	St
1.16.17	Start DVD encoding process .	St
1.16.18	6 .	St
1.16.19	Start CD burning process .	St
1.16.20	7 .	St
1.16.21	Start HDD file copy process ( let 's say 200-300GB OR less - depends on the capacity and shock resistance ! ) .	St
1.16.22	8 .	St
1.16.23	Start Prime95 ( CPU and RAM stress test ) .	St
1.16.24	9 .	St
1.16.25	Start 3DMark06 - Shader Model 3.0 graphics test in a loop at 1600x1200 resolution and with enabled 4x FSAA and 16 anisotropic filtering ( for graphics cards that do not support multi-sampling antialiasing with HDR , do not enable it , for those who do not have SM 3.0 support , the third game test from the 3DMark05 should be used ) .	St
1.16.26	10 .	St
1.16.27	If your PC is still alive - you can check your system power consumption .	St
1.16.28	Well , you have an idea .	St
1.16.29	Many of you will not be able to do all these steps at the same time but at least try DVD encoding , Prime95 and 3DMark .	St
1.16.30	You will be surprised Have fun !	St
1.17.1	While measuring with the Kill-A-Watt is a grand idea , it does n't help determine what size PSU you need ( just Watts . )	St
1.17.2	The conversion efficiency was not mentioned but on average ranks from a low of 60 to top notch numbers in the 90s .	St
1.17.3	This again does n't address Amperes on each supply leg and if said supply is OK or overtaxed .	St
1.17.4	While your effort is commendable , it 's not helping people get the right power supply .	St
1.17.5	Tomshardware did a fine review of power supplies and with 9 out of 21 supplies that could not meet their label numbers , your exacting method of calculation will get more people into trouble than help them avoid the PSU traps .	St
1.17.6	Power supplies are a deep topic .	St
1.17.7	Why not expand your site to cover the whole story ?	Ques
1.17.8	Bob	St
1.18.1	& quot ; While measuring with the Kill-A-Watt is a grand idea , it does n't help determine what size PSU you need ( just Watts .	St
1.18.2	) & quot ; - that 's it !	St
1.18.3	Just Watts - that 's what my calculator does to have at least an idea about approximate amount of Watts you will need and then start reading PSU reviews , labels , etc .	St
1.18.4	AND only after that buy one .	St
1.18.5	My calculator is just a start .	St
1.18.6	& quot ; While your effort is commendable , it 's not helping people get the right power supply. & quot ; - See above .	St
1.18.7	Bob , tell us , how would you start shopping for a new PSU for your new system ?	Ques
1.18.8	P.S .	St
1.18.9	You are right about PSUs : they are a deep topic and actually I 'm working on it It just takes a lot of my free time ...	St
1.18.10	Damn it , people !	St
1.18.11	I 'm spending my free time by doing this and what I 've got ?	Ques
1.18.12	No appreciation at all !	St
1.18.13	I 'm just kidding , you know I love you all	St
1.19.1	Your PC ( or device ) draws only what it needs for power .	St
1.19.2	If we can avoid the & quot ; inrush current & quot ; issue , we can make this quite simple .	St
1.19.3	Let 's say I want to fit a power supply with enough headroom ( spare capacity ) to allow for a few years degradation and not suffer what happens when we tax a power supply .	St
1.19.4	We 'll also reap the benefit of running the PSU at a fraction of it 's full load .	St
1.19.5	The conversion efficiency on most models increases as we move away from full load .	St
1.19.6	It also decreases as we approach and pass the 10 percent mark .	St
1.19.7	We have 2 disparate paths we can take here .	St
1.19.8	The fundamentally correct methods is to tally up the amperes ( max ) for each supply leg and then add about 25 to 50 percent to account for electrolytic capacitor aging .	St
1.19.9	Then we can shop for a PSU that meets that .	St
1.19.10	However the 50 percent over-rating is best since that accounts for most manufacturer 's fibs .	St
1.19.11	The next method is to try the Watts calculation .	St
1.19.12	If we go down that road , then the over-rating would be to double what we added up to overshoot the numbers for the power supply amperages as well as aging effect or label lies .	St
1.19.13	After all that we can go shopping .	St
1.19.14	- & gt ; PC Power and Cooling is great stuff , but even their supplies suffer the electrolytic capacitor aging issue .	St
1.19.15	So we ca n't fit exactly what we need and expect it to be OK in the next year .	St
1.19.16	Bob	St
1.20.1	You know Bob I 'm glad that we are having this conversation because I missed the electrolytic capacitor aging in my calculator already .	St
1.20.2	I like the first method but it is hard to find out the amperes ( max ) for each supply leg ... mnemonik23	St
1.21.1	In the section titled & quot ; ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITORS & quot ; & quot ; Cons : Marginal electrical properties means that these capacitors must be applied with care .	St
1.21.2	The parameters to be watched include leakage , service life vs. temperature , ESR , ESL , and low-temperature performance .	St
1.21.3	& quot ; http : //my.execpc.com/~endlr/ If you look at BAD CAPS on google.com you find the badcaps web site .	St
1.21.4	This is NOT the topic we are on but if you look at the low-temperature & quot ; performance & quot ; you find out why many of those bad cap motherboard owners were able to get the machine to boot after it & quot ; warmed up. & quot ; This is another point where we have to select & quot ; overkill & quot ; on the PSU because someone might turn on their PC when it 's nearly 0C in some basement .	St
1.21.5	Most of your label & quot ; specs & quot ; are for 25C operation .	St
1.21.6	Just another reason why you see many old salts fit the bigger supplies .	St
1.21.7	More surprises as we research & quot ; service life. & quot ; I hope this explains what your correct size power supply may not handle the load next year .	St
1.21.8	It 's not as solid state as people believed .	St
1.21.9	Bob	St
