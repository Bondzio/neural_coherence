(Code 41)&quot; i've tried using system restore to get it back to it's previous state but it keeps saying that it couldn't restore. i was trying to load some copies of programs yesterday and tried to use some patches and cracks on them so i think that's what might've done it. any idea on how i could fix this? thanks, jon

CODE 41 is also noted by http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;314060 Ignore what the KB says and delete the keys to retest. Bob

The culprit was slysoft's anydvd. I would suggest that you check to see if this particular piece of software is on your machine. After going into the registry and deleting all references to slysoft and anydvd and rebooting all 3 optical drives reappeared. Good luck
