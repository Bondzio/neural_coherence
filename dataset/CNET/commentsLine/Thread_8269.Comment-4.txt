the ipad is selling because of the marketing, not because of the product.
it's little more than an overgrown ipod touch.
it's a toy and people will buy it because steve jobs comes out and hypnotizes them with a black turtleneck.
saying, &quot;oooh look, we are going to sell you a technology that we came up with 4 years ago.
it doesn't do anything too useful, but you will buy it my zombies, yes you will..&quot;
