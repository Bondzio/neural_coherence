Hi Bob, Thanks for your quick reply!
My friend has just phoned me (which was rather handy) and told me that her Mac has on it 'Airport Extreme Ready', she's not sure if that means a card is inside the computer or she has to buy one?
I'm browsing Apple's website now to find out - do you know?
The computer she bought is called the IBook G4 with Mac OS X.
Again I'm going to have to look it up on their site being a Windows PC gal She still fancies the idea of being wireless but she's not sure of what bits and bobs she will need, in the meantime I'm going to check out some ISP's for her.
I appreciate your help Bob, thanks again for anything further you can add Lee -X-
