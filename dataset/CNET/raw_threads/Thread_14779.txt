I have some other ports on the back of the printer. Two kind of look like those used to connect up a monitor. Another looks like a PS2 port I think it is called that was used and I guess still is used to connect a keyboard or mouse. thanks in advance for any help, Dave

If the printer software is not compatible with the OS and there isn't a driver package update from the manufacturer (HP)you likely have a sea anchor, good luck!!!
