I've never looked closely at the drive case until now.
It is listed as an LG CDRW CED-8080B drive!!!
Closer inspection shows it as a COMPAQ drive!!!
Son of a B****, I put the wrong drive in the case!!!
I found the HP drive in another box.
The Compaq drive was in the old HP drive box.
The HP drive was in the Sony box.
I feel so, stupid.
Tons of emails and complaints and it was my fault.
Time for a cold beer.
Thanks Robert for making me look closely.
