<s> I NEED help..I have an HP office jetj6480 all in one...if I can get 50 black and white copies and 20 color copies before the ink runs out I am lucky. </s>
<s> I have had this since last december and have gone through 7 sets of ink . </s>
<s> I am looking for a new printer that yields a large number of copies, the printer is less than $100 and the refills are not rediculous. </s>
<s> I hope someone can help me I am sick of wasting so much money </s>
<s> Getting an plain old copier for the black/white copies? </s>
<s> It's about as cheap as it can get. </s>
<s> I have an HP Officejet 4500 Desktop. </s>
<s> I just started using it recently and had to purchase ink right away. </s>
<s> After buying a new cartridge, again it ran out after printing approx 20 black &amp; white pages. </s>
<s> I thought the cartridge was defected and returned it. </s>
<s> I have since bought 3 more and ALL HAVE BEEN THE SAME!!!! </s>
<s> There is nothing wrong with the ink, it is the HP Printer . </s>
<s> It uses WAY WAY TO MUCH INK. </s>
<s> I just replaced it yesterday and printed only 15 pages and it is already OUT again......WHAT PRINTER DO I NEED TO BUY??? </s>
<s> I NEED ONE THAT GIVES ME TOP QUALITY PRINTING WITHOUT COSTING A FORTUNE. </s>
<s> Sounds defective. </s>
<s> Get to hp.com and arrange for warranty or just return it. </s>
