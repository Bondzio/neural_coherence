asus m2n32-sli deluxe am2 motherboard, amd 64 x2 3800+ cpu / 1 stick of 1 gb corsair pro 800 ddr2 ram / 500 watt antec psu .
i have windows xp home sp2 that is installed on a ide drive that was running fine on a older asus a7v 133 system .
i have installed the new components and windows won't boot even in safe mode .
the system goes through post fine with standard 1 beep , i can access bios and all components and memory are recognized without problems .
my skill level is a novice at these problems , any input would be helpful .
thanks .
