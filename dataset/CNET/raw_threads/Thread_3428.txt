But it definitely is a bad place to store your only copy of data, especially if it contains the result of 'hard work'. Although it's better than an external hard disk, your experience proves that it isn't fail-safe. Nothing is fail-safe, by the way. If your work is worth more than, say, USD 1000, you can consider to contact drivesavers.com or some other trusted data recovery company. Kees

Proffitt	9/3/13 12:17 PM	1.37821062E12	Rule of thumb	While I always put it under a microscope I'm encountering a lot of folk that demand details beyond what can be written here. For example solder can crack and under the high power microscope we look for that and touch up the solder work. But nobody that doesn't do this today should attempt this when this is the last copy. For the uninitiated you tell them to contact drivesavers and repeat these are great ways to transport but never a place for the last copy. Bob

Google for rescue/recovery s/w and check the results. However, if it can't even see that a device is really there, you're hosed. ALWAYS have multiple sources stored of your precious data, now you know why. adios -----Willy

I don't know why this works, but sometimes it does. Keep the chill times short, no more than 20 minutes, and check. If no, then set it aside for an hour or so and try again. Don't give up. I managed to get data back after 6 weeks of multiple tries. A drive like this may become usable after a period of time of non-use, but that's not a certain thing. It happened with one of mine. Rob
