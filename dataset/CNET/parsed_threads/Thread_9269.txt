<s> Ok long story short my employer downsized and moved their office into their basement to save costs. </s>
<s> I moved their network from the office to basement. </s>
<s> I made not IP changes or config changes to server. </s>
<s> Only difference is the DSL line that the network will share has a dynamic IP going into the netopia modem/router and not a static IP as before. </s>
<s> Will this work. </s>
<s> Also a Linksys wireless router is connected to the netopia to provide wireless access in the house. </s>
<s> So netopia router - linksys router - wireless PCs and the existing network Netgear smart switch - 2 servers (both windows 2003 server, DHCP server on and clients/workstations assigned an IP reservation through it) - 3 workstations - 2 printers My question is how do I share the internet connection with this exsisting network setup? </s>
<s> The servers are on a 192.168.200.? </s>
<s> The netopia is giving me a 192.168.2.? </s>
<s> and has DHCP server on and the linkys a 192.168.1.? </s>
<s> I got so frustrated that I bought a wireless NIC for the workstations (which already had wired NICS setup to access the existing network-and working just fine) and tried to connect the wireless NIC to the wireless network. </s>
<s> That worked temp but how can I plug in manual IP etc on a dynamic DSL network? </s>
<s> Help I'm so confused and really want to learn what I am doing wrong. </s>
<s> I'm looking for the most cost-effective and easiest route for this today. </s>
<s> Thank you so much. </s>
<s> I should add that the netopia has DHCP server turned on - should this be acting as &quot;relay agent&quot;? </s>
<s> Are there some settings in the netopia or the linksys that I should change? </s>
<s> Why not try it our way? </s>
<s> See post 17 of our forum sticky. </s>
