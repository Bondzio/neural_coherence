1.1.1	I purchased ink for HP Deskjet 3745 from outside and not from the company but on putting that cartridge I am getting an error stating that there is a problem with my cartridge.I tried to remove and reinsert it but of no avail.	St

1.3.1	A new HP cartridge costs Rs.1700 whereas the cost of the printer is Rs.	St
1.3.2	3000 so clearly its not worth it.	St
1.3.3	Refilling cost me Rs.	St
1.3.4	200 but the printer is not accepting the refilled cartridge.	St
1.4.1	In your 1st post, you didn't mentione you &quot;refilled&quot; the old cart.	St
1.4.2	Now, that's your problem.	St
1.4.3	HP keeps track of ink carts, but using a different ink cart even if refilled but NOT used by your system will be accepted.	St
1.4.4	HP tracks upto 3 inkcarts, thus you need 4inkcarts to reset the last value from re-occuring.	St
1.4.5	Saving X-money isn't worth it if the prtr.	St
1.4.6	doesn't work.	St
1.4.7	You need to access other inkcart(s) to continue usage.	St
1.4.8	Google for further details but that covers it.	St
1.4.9	tada -----Willy	St
