Everytime I try to share a folder on a PC I get the following error: An error occurred while trying to share &quot;share name&quot;. The data is invalid. The shared resource was not created at this time. I'm not a newbie - but I can't figure this out!!!

The PC that can't share any folders - DOES have shared folders on it already. The PC acts as a server - so the other PC's access data off of this PC.
