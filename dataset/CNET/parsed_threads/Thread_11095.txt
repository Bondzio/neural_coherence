<s> I am considering buying one of these two cards for gaming purposes: Either the Nvidia 7800 GT, or the 7800 GTX. </s>
<s> Is the difference between the two cards justifies the price of the GTX? </s>
<s> Will I notice a significant improvememt while using the GTX in 'normal' conditions? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> The GTX allows for moire frame rates in higher resolutions, but not that much. </s>
<s> In my opinion, it doesn't justify the price so I say you go get the 7800gt. </s>
<s> Saves you alot more money and you can probably get something else with the saved money like speakers, or RAM. </s>
<s> get the Gt its fast and is like the 6800U and when the prise goes down get another GT, amke sure u have a SLI mobo and PSU. </s>
<s> Good luck </s>
<s> GT, because you can use Rivatuner to unlock the locked pipes on the GT and you'll get the same performance as the GTX. </s>
<s> Then you should consider increasing the core and memory clock speed on your card with Rivatuner to get a card even more powerful than the original GTX. </s>
<s> That's what I like about video cards these days, so much things to unlock..... </s>
<s> NIL </s>
