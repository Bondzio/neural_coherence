When I see such a disaster the first step if I am going to attempt to repair it to clone the drive.
I get a drive of about the same size (not too much bigger) and use G4U's copydisk from http://www.feyrer.de/g4u/ (sorry but I must decline duplicating the manual on how to use this.)
Now that I have a good copy I can try tools like GETDATABACK or ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY to see if they will get the partition back.
I never work on the original drive for the obvious reasons.
