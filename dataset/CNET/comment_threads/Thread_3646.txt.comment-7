You didn't mention where you got it so no one can tell if you purchased from a reputable vendor.
I could wonder if it wasn't a &quot;refurb&quot; drive that had the controller board replaced as the SN and other drive parameters would be burned onto the board's circuitry.
This being the case, you need to confront the seller with the information and see if they'll make this right.
The other option...and if you got a very friendly price...is to keep it and live with it.
Caveat emptor.
