1.1.1	My father has a desktop PC that 's years old already , but normally works just fine .	St
1.1.2	It 's a Gateway Yorktown model connected to a fairly new Samsung monitor .	St
1.1.3	The monitor does n't seem to have any problems , except that suddenly it 's been taking a really long time to wake up from standby .	St
1.1.4	I 'm not sure if it 's a monitor problem , though .	Res
1.1.5	It would normally just take a second or two to wake up after being away from the PC for a while .	St
1.1.6	Touch the mouse or keyboard and it would wake right up .	St
1.1.7	Suddenly it can take almost 20 mintues to wake up .	St
1.1.8	Also , the green light on the monitor will blink green on and off before it wakes up .	St
1.1.9	I 've already changed the power settings for him , but that does n't seem to be the issue .	St
1.1.10	Today this happened for the first time on start-up .	St
1.1.11	; He started his PC and waited for it to finish booting up , but the screen was black and the monitor power light was blinking .	St
1.1.12	He kept moving the mouse , etc , but nothing happened .	St
1.1.13	No images on the screen at all .	St
1.1.14	He forced a shut down and re-started again , then suddenly it worked .	St
1.1.15	I also checked all the drivers on his PC and they are all updated .	St
1.1.16	I shut down some misc programs that started on boot-up .	St
1.1.17	The only thing left that starts on boot is his anti-virus .	St
1.1.18	Does this sound familiar to anyone ?	Ques
1.1.19	Could it be due to an impending hardware failure with a part on the PC ?	Ques
1.1.20	I really do n't think it has to do with the monitor itself .	St
1.1.21	I feel like the PC might be having trouble communicating with the monitor .	St
1.1.22	Anyone have any ideas ?	Ques
1.1.23	?	Ques
1.2.1	but nothing significant .	St
1.2.2	1 ] Is it time for house cleaning ?	Ques
1.2.3	When was the last time the case was opened and all the dust bunnies blown away from the fans , power supply source and vents with an Air aerosol ?	Ques
1.2.4	2 ] Other house-keeping , reducing Processes and Services and any applications that & quot ; Load at startup & quot ; but are not needed all the time and can just be opened when required .	St
1.2.5	They take up RAM .	St
1.2.6	Mark	St
1.3.1	Pc is cleaned regularly , and I 've already stopped a bunch of processes/services that load at start up , but it has n't made any improvements regarding the standby issue .	St
1.4.1	That 's good and it eliminates two possibilities .	St
1.4.2	How about other clues ?	Ques
1.4.3	If you note the time that the display finally appears , head over to the Event Viewer and look at the logs for both Applications and System , and see where the delay , ( time gap ) , is between events .	St
1.4.4	Something there may show what is calling the delay .	St
1.4.5	I do have a couple of other thoughts ; network and anti-virus .	St
1.4.6	My own Win 7 system appears at times to delay desktop display until the network is established .	St
1.4.7	I 'm on a broadband always-on connection .	St
1.4.8	Also some anti-virus utilities might run a quick scan on boot up .	Sug
1.4.9	I know Stand-by is not the same , but does the anti-virus scanner kick in anyway ?	Ques
1.4.10	Mark	St
1.5.1	Thanks !	St
1.5.2	I have tried disabling the antivirus and that did n't work , plus he 's had it on his PC for years and he does update it .	St
1.5.3	Also he is using Windows XP , not Windows 7 .	St
1.5.4	I just checked the Events Viewer logs under all items , but did n't find anything that showed any problems .	St
1.5.5	I wish I could figure out what is causing the problem .	St
1.6.1	If you read Overclocking advice you find a tale of overlapping protection .	St
1.6.2	Maybe you can use this for ideas of what to look for ?	Ques
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	I did n't expect the Event Viewer to show problems ; instead , looking at the & quot ; times & quot ; between each event , perhaps there is some clue as to what is causing this delay between logged events .	St
1.7.2	Bob 's idea is good .	Polite
1.7.3	What running security programs are there on this system besides the anti-virus ?	Ques
1.7.4	For example we find many XP users still using Spybot Search & amp ; Destroy with it 's TeaTimer component running in the background , or Lavasoft 's AdAware with it 's Adwatch component running in the background and with today 's anti-virus scanners those components often cause conflict .	St
1.7.5	Which anti-virus is being used ?	Ques
1.7.6	Are any 'Optmizers ' or 'Registry Cleaners ' being used ?	Ques
1.7.7	We often find those can cause problems .	St
1.7.8	Mark	St
1.8.1	Did you check your belief about it NOT being the monitor that causes this ?	Ques
1.8.2	That 's so easy ( just swap monitor with another PC ) that I would start with that .	St
1.8.3	Kees	St
1.9.1	Thanks , I looked at the EVent viewer again and everything is pretty much seconds to a minute apart in time .	St
1.9.2	As for Anti-Virus , he is running McAffee Anti-Virus and does not have any other anti-virus type program or optimizers , he would n't even know what to do with most of those other programs .	St
1.9.3	I 'm not sure if this would qualify as a registry cleaner , maybe since it gets rid of programs , but he does have Revo Uninstaller .	St
1.9.4	He said he has n't uninstalled anything in months , though .	St
1.9.5	He has been having problems with his USB ports for some time also , which is what made me wonder if his PC is just slowly dying part by part .	St
1.10.1	Actually , I did not swap out another monitor to check if that could be the cause , but it would n't be a problem for me to do so .	St
1.10.2	I 'll just get one of mine and bring it over to try .	St
1.10.3	I should try to rule that in or out for him .	Sug
1.10.4	Once I get to doing this , I 'll post back what happened .	St
1.11.1	I see another good idea from Kees , and note that you will swap out the monitor to see if the problem is there .	St
1.11.2	In fact I was going to type on about ... & quot ; If not , I would wonder about the Event Viewer showing events a minute apart. & quot ; , but re-reading your first post , I now see you are talking about anything up to a 20 minute wait before the display shows .	St
1.11.3	So , now I 'm not at all sure anything in the Event Viewer , or anything else software wise , would be causing this , and it looks like Kees ' suggestion might have hit the nail on the head .	St
1.11.4	Let 's see what you find out when you swap the monitor .	St
1.11.5	Good luck .	Polite
1.11.6	Mark	St
1.12.1	I finally got around to hooking up a different monitor to the PC and sure enough , the new monitor works fine with no stand-by issues .	St
1.12.2	It goes to sleep and wakes up instantly .	St
1.12.3	So the problem lies with either the other monitor itself or the cables attached to this monitor .	St
1.12.4	So for now , I just gave him my monitor that has no issues with stand-by .	St
1.12.5	Thanks again for everyone 's help and suggestions !	St
1.13.1	and thanks for letting us know .	Polite
1.13.2	Mark	St
