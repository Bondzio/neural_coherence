in short.
1. bios update.
it's something i've done many times (2^9 times?)
and for me has never lost a board.
2. if it doesn't list the xp, then it's not going to support it.
but did i look at the wrong board at  since it lists some xp cpus.
3. i don't see a lot of these cpus out there either.
(duron) but you may want to be sure your power supply has the watts and you also will be fitting a new proper sized cpu heatsink and fan (hsf)
