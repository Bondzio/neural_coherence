Looking around the internets it seems that I can get an additional Adapater (PLE200) for about $85. My question is would I be able to buy a Powerline Adapater from a different manufacturer (less $$) that would still be compatible with his system? I think the answer is yes, but I was hoping for a 2nd opinion from someone with a bit more networking smarts than me.
