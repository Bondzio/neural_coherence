It sounds like you need to read and use what you learn about ICS from http://www.wown.com I can't help you because you may have a firewall installed and that is beyond what support I offer.
Many can't control their firewall and as such I withdraw any firewall support.
Besides Zonelabs deserves that priviledge.
In short, set up ICS and control that firewall.
As to cheap routers, the cheapest was 10 dollar belkin unit on sale.
My Wifi-G Dlink router was 25 bucks from compgeeks (plus some shipping) so deals are out there.
