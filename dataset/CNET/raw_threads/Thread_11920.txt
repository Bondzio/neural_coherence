I think you have inadvertently revealed why so many folk build a PC and it results in a machine that just crashes. As to the graphics card, I'll supply the list I like but without knowing about the use of the machine I have no reason to pick one. Nice choice on the SSD. I see less woes with that line. Here's the list: http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html Bob

If so, these tend to come with a thermal pad that heats and spreads during the first uses. It just looks like a square piece of tape on the heatsink. If it's there, you don't want to put thermal paste on top of it. I've not had problems with Intel thermal pads though some will advise to remove them and use pastes with silver powder in the blend. I'd think those same people tend to recommend scrapping the Intel HSF and replacing the entire thing with something heavy duty if the user plans to OC or do heavy gaming.
