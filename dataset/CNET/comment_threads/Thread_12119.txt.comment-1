I have a new Dell Latitude which replaced an older dell latitude.
My old dell had no problems connecting wirelessly to my router.
The new one connects then a few minutes later locks up the router.
I have to reboot the router for it to start working again.
Its using windows xp professionl service pack 2.
If I plug into the wired connection it works fine.
It also connects fine wirelessly at work.
Any Ideas?
