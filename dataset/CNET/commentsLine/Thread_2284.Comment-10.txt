... i am waiting for adobe to send me the cs3 master suite (academic priced) including after effects et al.
i realized when i bought it that i would have to upgrade my equipment.
i had a pc that could run it but i'm just so much faster and happier with my work flow on a mac that i committed my self to the extra expense of buying new equipment (anticipating using it for a few years).
from your comments, it sounds like you have some experience with this stuff.
can you tell me where the best, mac oriented, learning resources and forums are on line dedicated to video editing and fx for web use and dvd authoring?
thanks for any input you can give me.
