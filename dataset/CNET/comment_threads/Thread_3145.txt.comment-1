Hi, I have a Dimension 3000 Pentium 4 computer with 256MB ram.
I would like to upgrade to 2 GB.
I found cheap ram on ebay and I contacted the seller to be sure that the ram is compatable.
The seller replied that my computer only can work with &quot;Low density&quot; ram and s/he refered me to another product that is more than double the price because it is &quot;low density&quot;.
The high density ram page is: http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=310096884056&ssPageName=ADME:X:RTQ:US:1123 And the Low density page is: http://cgi.ebay.com/1GB-PC3200-DDR-LOW-DENSITY-UNIVERSAL-RAM-MEMORY_W0QQitemZ120268766088QQihZ002QQcategoryZ44936QQcmdZViewItemQQ_trksidZp1742.m153.l1262 What do you think?
Thanks.
