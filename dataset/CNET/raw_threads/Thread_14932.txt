I have noticed that in xfire and aim, i get logged off and it says reconnecting in ..... I've come to realize that my router is disconnecting me from the internet for a split second, because it happens alot like once every ten minutes, but i have never fully lost connection from the internet. This is really annoying. Is my unit defective? Have I diagnosed my problem wrong? I really need help. This router is only 6 months old. Thanks in advance.

Since the default could be wifi enabled with WEP for security, I'd follow the forum sticky for setup EVEN IF YOU ARE WIRED. If you don't need wifi, disable it in the router. In closing, if you are running TORRENTS, drops are a sign. Bob

No matter what security setup I have played with, I haven't been able to make it stop disconnecting me. This wasn't too big of an issue until I hooked up my new PS3. It drops connection about every other match. I have been debating just buying a new router even though I can't afford it. I've been looking for a solution for about 6 months now and still havent found one. I'm even up to date on the firmware.

We love to take potshots at hiding the SSID (causes drops) or security that breaks in 120 or less seconds. Bob

No matter what security setup I have played with, I haven't been able to make it stop disconnecting me. This wasn't too big of an issue until I hooked up my new PS3. It drops connection about every other match. I have been debating just buying a new router even though I can't afford it. I've been looking for a solution for about 6 months now and still havent found one. I'm even up to date on the firmware. Not a word about wired, wifi or settings. NO make, model, firmware version. The forum sticky does cover the firmware issue but without the details you may only get &quot;check the forum sticky.&quot; Bob

Looking at your settings you claim wifi is off but your screen shot shows it is ON with NO SECURITY. This is not what we suggest since it will lead to troubles. The firmware version is current so all that leaves us for common drops is the wifi and torrent use. Bob
12188	12	381476	3243924	3243922	chiman2	2/9/10 5:55 PM	1.2657381E12	Sorry...	Sorry..that was an old pic. I just checked now and the wireless is off...I do not torrent so that can not be it.
12188	13	381476	3243926	3243924	R. Proffitt	2/9/10 6:08 PM	1.26573888E12	Ok, what makes you sure its the router?	Let's get rid of another issue. Power and heat. I've found routers and DSL modems buried under books cooking away. Also we are never sure of the power so put it on some UPS. The DSL modem can be the failure point which I used to loan out my old but stable modem to sniff that out. Sorry about the person jumping into your discussion and me missing that you came back. At this point it's something of a mystery what it is. Ok. No torrents. Then again we had that member the swore up and down no torrents. Just Limewire. Ouch, Bob

12188	15	381476	3244012	3239196	chiman2	2/9/10 7:18 PM	1.26574308E12	Um.	It is plugged into a power surge protector and has open air around it. I have another wireless router that my friend let me test my modem with and it never timed out. I tested it for 24 hours.
