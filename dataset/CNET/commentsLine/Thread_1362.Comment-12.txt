i have two dells on my desk.
i leave the cases open and have a small $10 fan blowing on them, and a ceiling fan going all the time.
before i did this they both would really slow down after a couple of hours, but now they don't.
they're on just about 24/7, but they go into sleep mode if idle for 60 minutes.
they're both about 5 years old now, and still in pretty good shape, and i have yet to have one of them stall or crash on me since i opened the cases and added the fans.
one drawback i have is that we also have a spare refrigerator in this room and it generates a lot of heat.
i'm thinking of adding some kind of partition between my desk and the fridge.
can't get rid of the fridge though.
once you have a second one, you'll never want to go back to just one again!!!
