The sound system is an Altec Lansing ADA885. The left/right and surround speakers are working fine, however, no sound is coming from the subwoofer. The subwoofer is on and it does pass it's own diagnostic check (press a button-&gt;makes a sound). All the connections are fine. However, it never makes a sound in any windows application or game. Could it be a soundcard issue? I'm using Creative Sound Blaster! Value card. It's updated to their newest version. In the SB control program, there is an option to select 2 or 4 speaker, but none for subwoofer. Is it supposed to be that way? Thanks for any help, I'm very new to this.
