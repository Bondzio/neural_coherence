<s> I have photos & whatnot saved into my WD Essential external, but I when I try accessing my own photos, I get a pop-up telling me I' don't have &quot;permissions&quot; to open it. </s>
<s> I've already switched the &quot;owner&quot; to my 'name&quot; in the permissions & it's still not allowing me access. </s>
<s> I &quot;fixed&quot; this once before & have long since forgotten how I even did it. </s>
<s> I need to fix it *permanently*. </s>
<s> Sick of going through with that every time. </s>
<s> Using Windows 7 on an hp laptop. </s>
<s> Thx! </s>
<s> SOMEbody has to know. </s>
<s> If changing the permissions doesn't work, you;ve got to take ownership. </s>
<s> Googling for WINDOWS 7 TAKE OWNERSHIP might tell you what you need to know. </s>
<s> Otherwise, find a big enough USB-stick, formatted in FAT32, and use a Linux disk to copy those files to that stick and delete them on the external. </s>
<s> And then you're logon with your id in Windows to copy it back. </s>

<s> It *appears* to've worked. </s>
