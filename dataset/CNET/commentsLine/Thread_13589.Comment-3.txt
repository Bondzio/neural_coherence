bob thank you for your reply, this not my printer, but when visiting my friend yesterday, he showed me the problem.
he was using a4 film with a white strip along one of the narrow edges.
this was the film he used with his older epson printer, he loaded the film white strip first, the older epson ran off the required document, whilst the sx405 just spat out the unprinted film.
we also tried loading the white strip at the opposite end with the same result.
looking on the windows xp printing dialog box there did not seem to be any settings for using film, nor were there any in the printer's own display menu.
i expect the solution to this problem is staring us in the face.
thanks again toolman59
