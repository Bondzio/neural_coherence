1.1.1	Aloha, I need to buy a traveling case for my new LaCie external hard-drive.	St
1.1.2	Can anyone help me find a secure case to travel with.	Ques
1.1.3	I'm a video editor and it would be much better than what I do now (carry around the factory packaging).	St
1.1.4	If anyone can help, it would be greatly appreciated.	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks...	St
1.2.1	http://www.plasticase.com/content.asp?node=7 has some very nice models.	St
1.3.1	I did see that, but I think I'm going to look for a multi-purpose/less expensive case.	St
1.3.2	I found these two Case Logics, if you wanna look and let me know what you think... http://www.amazon.com/Deluxe-External-Storage-Travel-Case/dp/B0016OZ05O/ref=sr_1_17?ie=UTF8&m=A2QHBM8MEN9W65&s=electronics&qid=1232585478&sr=1-17 http://www.amazon.com/Deluxe-External-Storage-Travel-Case/dp/B0016P02WE/ref=sr_1_24?ie=UTF8&m=A2QHBM8MEN9W65&s=electronics&qid=1232585478&sr=1-24	St
1.4.1	I looked at the plasticase because we use such on our gear today.	St
1.4.2	But we make some custom electronics and when we travel we can't replace our gear easily so we put it in cases we can carry on and will survive an 8 foot drop.	St
1.4.3	It's all about the need.	St
1.4.4	Yours is the fine case to avoid small bumps and drops.	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
