Hi, I have a netgear wireless router wpn824 and wa swroking fine till I used it with dynamic IP address with the DSL connection but now when I came on a business trip and am living in a hotel, I have been provided with static IP and DNS servers settings.
If I use the laptop without the router, there is no issue except that I have to sit on the chair everytime I have to do anything.
I tried setting up the router but to see no luck at all.I provided the ststic IP and DNS server info into the router configuration but to see nothing happening, i upgraded network card and router firmware also, I am using 3945 PRO wireless INtel Card.PLease help as it is become very crucial for me to set it up.I can not sit for hours on a chair just to do busines work.Let me knwo if I need to provide any more infomartion.
Static Ip: 192.168.1.8 DNS 202.54.7.96 alt.
202.9.6.54
