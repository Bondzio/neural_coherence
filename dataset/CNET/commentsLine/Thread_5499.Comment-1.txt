i'm building a new computer and am not sure which motherboard to get.
i'm going to be getting an amd x2 4200 or 4400 (not sure yet on am2 or socket 939 any suggestions on that?)
i assume the am2 is newer, so if the opportunity is there to get one for am2 should i jump on it?
anyway, i know this would have to be 2 different reccomendations since i'm not sure on the socket.
i will also be purchasing an ati x1900 graphics card and a hauppauge 500 dualtv tuner.
i saw a couple asus motherboards that received very high reviews, but i saw it talk about sli, which i figure i would not use since i have an ati graphics card and won't be putting 2 in my machine.
one of the cards i was looking at was the a8n sli deluxe which received very good reviews.
another was the asus a8r32-mvp deluxe but i know someone that has had a lot of problems with it.
any reccomendations would be great, thanks, ~j
