(30&quot; ACD)	So I have a few 23 and 30-inch ACD's dotted around my home office, but one 30-incher I just keep having problems with. What it does is the entire display flickers off and on at random intervals - anything between 5 and less than 1 second. If I unplug it from the power brick and plug it in again immediately, the problem goes away until the monitor is turned off. And it doesn't do it all the time. It did it today, which is the first time in about three weeks. It's been away twice to Applecare, during which they couldn't see anything wrong. All devices in my home office are directly plugged in to a socket on APC switched PDU' s which in turn are connected to a redundant APC Symmetra extended-runtime UPS. Current draw, faulty socket, etc are not issues. Power brick has been replaced - also tried bricks from other working monitors, to no change. It struck me that today it was pretty cool in my home office now that I've turned the heating totally off - no timer operation. And having thought about it, the problem only started happening with noticeable effect in Octoberish if I remember correctly. I don't really see though how a few degrees can affect operation that much - especially as the monitor is absolutely fine once it has been unplugged from the brick and replugged (literally replugged, not even a seconds' delay), for the rest of the day. The above is just a hunch though, I don't really have anything. Anyone else have a more concrete explanation to what's happening?
