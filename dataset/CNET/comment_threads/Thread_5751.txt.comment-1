hi, I was wanting to get a new router as i have the 1 supplied by the provider (D-Link DSL - 2640r).
it works well on my computer and PS3 which i use wired connection for but is useless when it comes to wireless and i am moving my PS3 onto a new tv downstairs and my connection will be very poor.
i shall also use network storage on this router for family laptops etc.
So i was wondering if any one could guide me on how to go about setting this product up i.e.. modem, filters etc.
i have done my research on this subject but haven't been able to find my answers.
i have a adsl connection.
would and what modem if any would i need to purchase.
thank you
