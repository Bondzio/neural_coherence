1.1.1	hey im going to buy and new comp pretty soon here and i just wanted to know if i should get one or two gigs .	St
1.1.2	I hear 2 gigs isnt much diff then one in gaming only like 3 FPS .	St
1.1.3	Im getting XMS ram for sure i just cant afford 2 gigs of XMS so if i do get 2 gigs its would only be normal .	St
1.2.1	Most people hardly ever use above 1gb of memory .	St
1.2.2	1gb is plenty for games and it is n't , add a 512mb stick and you will have 1.5gb of memory ; plenty for games .	St
1.2.3	People that use 2gb of memory are doing some intensive projects like photo-editing and video-editing .	St
1.2.4	PCMagazine had an article of how they compared 7 gaming rigs from high-end vendors such as Alienware and Falcon Northwest , and all their systems had 1gb of memory ( except for one system , and you are right , 2gb does n't make much of a difference ) .	St
1.2.5	Yet all those systems still ran games such as Halflife 2 and Splinter CELL in the highest resolutions with AA turned on just fine .	St
1.2.6	1gb will be fine for your gaming rig .	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	know why you 're buying it .	St
1.5.2	if you do not care about the minimal difference between corsair value and xms nor are you overclocking , than the price difference is not justifiable .	St
1.5.3	Besides , you can always o'c your ram , changing the timings would get you where you want to go and buy some memory heatspreaders , and you 've got corsair xms .	St
1.5.4	The fsb speed is the most important anyways .	St
1.5.5	If you really want to o'c just buy pc4200 , pc4800 , etc ... Roger	St
1.6.1	Unless you really have some need for 2 gigs of RAM , 1 should be plenty for gaming .	St
1.6.2	Unless you enjoy running a lot of background apps while gaming , you wo n't really notice a difference at all .	St
1.6.3	Keep in mind that RAM is n't going to affect gaming that much as long as you have enough .	St
1.6.4	If you want to see the biggest FPS increase , consider purchasing a new video card or a faster processor .	St
