It looks like it could get locked in on two corners, but I can't even fit the heatsink into the bracket.
I could force it, but then I risk doing some serious damage and I still wouldn't be sure that there is good contact between the heatsink and the chip, so no dice.
The heat sink that's in there now measures 63mm X 89 mm.
The new one I bought is 68mm X 83 mm.
That extra 5mm is really killing me.
