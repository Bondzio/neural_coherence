<s> My daughter left her iPod Nano plugged into our emachines running XP all night long. </s>
<s> When we rebooted the computer in the morning - we get little or no power. </s>
<s> The computer seems to start up ok, the light turns green, then you can hear the power quieten down & the light fades to a pale yellow. </s>
<s> Nothing works from that point on. </s>
<s> Is this the power supply that has burned out or does someone know what else it could be? </s>
<s> If you read the USB spec, you can short out the USB 5V lines to any other line without burnout. </s>
<s> And at 500mA at 5V that's 2.5 Watts. </s>
<s> This should not strain any machine's 300 and up Watt power supply. </s>
<s> I'd look eleswhere for the cause such as age, etc. </s>

<s> Well, I didn't think it was the nano, but it was a big coincidence! </s>
<s> Should I look at replacing the power supply? </s>
<s> Any other ideas? </s>
<s> To see if that's it, try one more time and when it's failed use your Voltmeter to test the power supply &quot;legs&quot; to see if the supply has died on any of the legs. </s>
