<s> The Dlink router I bought could be connect to only 4 computers. </s>
<s> How can I connect 6 computers using the same router. </s>
<s> My ISP has given me only one IP address. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> 6 doesnt go into 4 Try fitting a square peg into a round hole or nailing a jelly to a wall - its easier ! </s>
<s> The only possible way you could ever do this would be to double up a connection on 2 of your pc's ie. </s>
<s> have 2 machines sharing a connection - BUT the DHCP server on your router will not allocate more than 4 ip addresses, so you,ll be doubling up your ip addresses - so you'll get into all sorts of trouble - try it with something like yahoo chat or msn messenger and you'll see what I mean ! </s>
<s> Getting another 4 port router and daisy chaining them would be easier - or just upgrade to an 8 port - they are not that expensive these days. </s>
<s> I have the 4 port router with a 8 port switched hub and you have written it doesn't work. </s>
<s> Very strange. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You can place switches behind the router. </s>
<s> I have 2 switches behind my Linksys router now. </s>
<s> You can use the uplink port or a cross over cable. </s>
<s> Some of the newer switches will auto detect and uplink for you. </s>
<s> Buy a 8 port switch and plug your computers into that. </s>
<s> The DHCP server should give out more than 4 IP's. </s>
<s> I've been using a Dlink router with (3) eight-port switches to support all the various systems through-out my household. </s>
<s> The router assigns the DHCP addresses to all the systems without a problem. </s>
<s> Simply use the uplink port on each switch to plug into a port on the router. </s>
<s> It's quick and easy. </s>
<s> rproffit's answer was correct. </s>
<s> Add a 4-port hub to one of the router outputs, and now you can connect 7 computers! </s>
<s> If your computers are not all in one place, you can set up your router with a couple of connections going to hubs where the computers are located - it makes wiring easier, and you don't need to replace the router. </s>
<s> And the DHCP server will serve as many IP addresses as you have allocated in its address range. </s>
<s> R.J.G. </s>
<s> nailed it. </s>
<s> As he said, the router's built-in DHCP server takes care of all addressing. </s>
<s> To add more machines, just keep daisy-chaining routers. </s>
<s> You can only hook up 255 machines however. </s>
<s> It's got to do with the address byte size I think. </s>
<s> If you have that many users at one time, one's internet connection will slow down long before 255. </s>
<s> Actually, the ISP will come after you if there are too many users on your system. </s>
<s> It's not that they have any way to &quot;see&quot; all those machines but because of increased bandwidth use. </s>
<s> It is possible to find large hubs pre-owned. </s>
<s> I got an eight-port HP one in a thrift shop for CAN$5. </s>
<s> However, it had no uplink port (if a hub has one it will be clearly marked) so I had to make a crossover cable for it. </s>
<s> Using a crossover to connect a hub to the rout uses one porter uses up a port so my eight-port hub only has seven ports free. </s>
<s> It is clear that you did not get the correct number ports for your project, but the does not have to be the end of it. </s>
<s> By posting this question you must also be out of budget and therefore cannot buy another switch, hub or routing device; and you are looking for a way to make this happen with what you have. </s>
<s> Well we need more information to proceed, but with these things you can see what you have. </s>
<s> Since you did not mention that the DLink you have also has wireless then we will rule out using that option. </s>
<s> What else do you have? </s>
<s> Do any of the PCs have multiple network cards? </s>
<s> If they do then you could connect them to machine and use them as routers, connected with cross-over cables. </s>
<s> Do you have USB ports on these PC's? </s>
<s> Well the get youself connected through the USB. </s>
<s> You could also try some real old school networking with your Serial or Parallel ports by finding some cross-over cable or a ParaLink set. </s>
