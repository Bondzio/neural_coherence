<s> My church was donated an HPdeskjet 990cxi printer with the drivers on a homemade cd. </s>
<s> I cannot install the printer because when I try to install a new printer, the program does not recognize the files on the cd. </s>
<s> I ran Windows explorer to see if anything was in the folder and sure enough, the files are there. </s>
<s> Can anyone help me? </s>
<s> I went to the HP website and got no help there. </s>
<s> Go to the HP web site and download the drivers. </s>
<s> An old system may not be able to read a burned CD, a common problem, you could try restoring the CD on a new system on the network and then copy the files to the system with the printer and install them. </s>
<s> You didn't mention the true nature of files on the CD, are they compressed or as they're needed, uncompressed. </s>
<s> Regardless, see if you made a new dir. </s>
<s> on your system and &quot;copy&quot; them to that dir.. Manually, install the printer and point to either the CD or new dir. </s>
<s> you made. </s>
<s> If it fails on both attempts, then you probably have compressed files. </s>
<s> Get an &quot;uncompesser pgm&quot;, usually called that either a .ZIP .JAR .ARC, etc. </s>
<s> if that what the files maybe compressed as by using WinRar, WinZIP, etc. </s>
<s> similar for such usage. </s>
<s> Also, older install pgms. </s>
<s> may ask for Disk1, Disk2, check to see if such is present. </s>
<s> If none of this makes sense, then just get the install(driver) files from the HP support website for that model printer. </s>
<s> Here is a link to start that process... http://h20015.www2.hp.com/hub_search/taskPageSelect.jhtml?lc=en&pagetype=software&prodId=hpdeskjet921701&sw_lang=en&lang=en&cc=us Select the OS you need it for and follow prompts. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
