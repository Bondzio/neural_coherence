Gateway's website has a driver for newer keyboards and I downloaded one which I thought would work but no such luck. I visited Microsoft's website and they didn't have anything of any use either. Suggestions?

Looking to Microsoft for Gateway support would a frustrating waste of time. Maybe you didn't write what said driver would do? Drivers get things working. In the case of a keyboard, not so much a ''driver'' but a keyboard enhancer (not a driver!) is what some are looking for. The difference is there and be sure you are looking for the right software.

I didn't think about the difference between a driver or some enhancements. The keyboard does work but the internet/multimedia keys won't work since upgrading to XP-Pro. I'm going to visit Gateway again. thanks Denny
