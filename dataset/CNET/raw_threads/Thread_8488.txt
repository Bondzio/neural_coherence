Both are equipped with NIC cards, so I installed my Zyxel Prestige 623 ADSL modem/router on both and connected them both to the router. My problem is that while I can ping the router from each machine neither machine can ping the other. Any idea what could be wrong? Note that the Zyxel ADSL modem/router is no longer connected to an ADSL line, could this be the problem ?
