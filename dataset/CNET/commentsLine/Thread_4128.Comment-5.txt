thanks for the reply.
it sounds like a good idea.
the only problem is that my container will not have a top (open container).
it will look similar to a round ashtray and might be angled a little bit so that the person sitting in the chair can see what's in the container and be able to reach for it.
if i were to go to home depot, i would ask for 2 loops, 2 rods, 2 swivel joints, 2 rubber washers, and a small plate (what kind/brand)?
sorry, i'm not familiar with all this new terminology.
and in case you're wondering, it's for a class project.
and yes, i am in way over my head.
