yeah, the movies are a big chunk.
i've discussed it with my isp manager and he says he watches 3-4 movies per week and is still only using about 30g per month -- well below half of our use.
we average one per week or even per two weeks, so i don't think it's that.
i have unplugged a few devices, including the ps3 and so far haven't seen a decrease, but will continue to try that.
thanks.
