Slightly modded. http://www.wayne2.net/modded.jpg I extended the power from inside the case and connected the eSATA drive to one of the SATA ports on the mother board. Not pretty but it's major fast. 3 Gb/s transfer speed. Seagate 450 Gig PMR drive used as storage for &quot;stuff&quot;. I can save a 1 Gig movie in about 20 seconds. Fan and fan mount from spare junk. I have an external case but it had no cooling fan.

12857	4	300238	2806448	2806397	VAPCMD	7/6/08 3:48 PM	1.21535928E12	I was looking around at Newegg and found	the following enclosure: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817153061 It come with everything you need including the internal SATA to bracket with eSATA connector and eSATA cable to eSATA enclosure Looks like a decent unit from Thermaltake with active cooling for those that leave their externals HDDs on. I only use mine for backup and afterwards remove the cables and turn 'em off. The nice thing about the Adaptec units was they could handle HDDs up to 1TB for the last 3-4 years whereas other USB-eSATA enclosures were capacity limited to smaller drives. VAPCMD

12857	7	300238	2806910	2806773	Coryphaeus	7/7/08 10:25 AM	1.2154263E12	I have that one. . .	it's the one I was going to mod. I've never been a fan of the heat sink cases. I really don't like the one I have for that reason. I gotta have a fan, if for nothing more than that warm and fuzzy feeling. I do remember this. When that drive was in that case, Everest reported the temp as around 137 F. Now, with my new non-case and fan, the temp runs about 120 F.
