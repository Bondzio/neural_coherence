<s> Is Socket 775 and LGA 775 the same thing? </s>
<s> I have a motherboard with a Intel Core 2 Duo E6300 and says my socket is 775. </s>
<s> Am I able to upgrade to Quad Core which requires LGA775? </s>
<s> Not only much the socket match but the BIOS must have Quad Core support. </s>
<s> If only you had supplied the motherboard make/model we might have checked if Quad Core was on it's list. </s>

<s> right or not. </s>
<s> And if not right, it won't work properly. </s>
<s> You need to check the ASUS site for the lates CPU support. </s>

<s> what you've provided, and some information I found on HP's website, the mainboard has the Intel 945 chipset, which is Core 2 compatable in most all cases, and you said you have a Core 2 Duo currently installed (and working I would assume?) </s>
<s> which leads me to believe it might support the Quad Core, however there are other variables you should consider before going for a quad core, like the power supply and case cooling. </s>
<s> Yes I do have a core 2 duo running on it right now but i've only gotten two helpful replies and both are different answers(yes and no). </s>
<s> Can I run the Quad Core? </s>
<s> I need a for-sure answer and if i cant can i get suggestions on what type of motherboard i should buy? </s>
<s> (PSU, COOLING and such i can deal with myself) </s>
<s> Just to clear up, LGA775 and Socket 775 are two differnt things, right? </s>
<s> ASUS P5LP-LE do support dual cores. </s>
<s> That's why I noted it. </s>
<s> Thanks for the correction. </s>

<s> Generics give you full latitude to use whatever parts you want vs. those designed for proprietary systems. </s>
<s> VAPCMD PS....While all socket 775 CPUs physically fit in the LGA 775 socket, it doesn't mean they will work (at all) or if they work, work properly. </s>
<s> Much has to do with the motherboard and the MB BIOS and there are scores of enthusiasts who've purchased the latest MBs only to find their high-end processors won't work at all until they update the MB BIOS. </s>
<s> But without a CPU that the system recognizes, they can't update the BIOS so they often resort to borrowing or sometimes buying an older, cheaper processor just for the purpose of flashing the BIOS. </s>
<s> Once the BIOS is flashed to the newer (or newest version).. it will then recognize and work properly with the C2D or quad-core CPU. </s>
