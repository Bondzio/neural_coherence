about 3 weeks ago i purchased an acer aspire one at costco for $300.
they have a 90 day trail during which you can return it.
it has 1gb ram and 160 gb hard drive.
i want it for travel, checking emails, skype, etc.
i love it.
skype works great and connects easily to the internet.
i am really happy with it.
i have used and hp laptop for 6 years and tis acer is waaaay better!
