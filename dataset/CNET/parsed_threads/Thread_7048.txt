<s> After years of reliable use my old CRT monitor died. </s>
<s> So I bought a new LG 20 inch lcd: 1. </s>
<s> The res/picture qulaity seems about same as my old CRT - I assume due to the following: a) I have res set at 1024x768 (the recommended 1680 x 1050 makes the font really small which I don't like); b) I am connected via VGA not DVI (no DVI slot on my computer). </s>
<s> Does this seem right or is there another reason wht res is same as old CRT? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I found the screen a little bright so turned down the brightness setting from max (100) to around 75. </s>
<s> When I did I found that the monitor produced an annoying hum/buzz (goes away when turn back to brightness max 100). </s>
<s> Is this a defective monitor or do all LCDs do this? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Is it worth upgrading my video card to allow DVI connection (I assume this is how I would do it???) </s>
<s> and buying a DVI cable to get higher res? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> you're going to want to run in an LCD's native resolution which sounds like 1680 X 1050. </s>
<s> Anything else will degrade the image quality. </s>
<s> You can always customize the settings to increase icon and font size. </s>
<s> As for the buzzing, that doesn't sound typical if it's coming from the monitor. </s>
<s> That might be a warranty issue. </s>
<s> If the noise is coming from your sound system, that might be correctable with shielding or cable placement. </s>
<s> &quot;You can always customize the settings to increase icon and font size.&quot; How can I do that? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> and select Properties. </s>
<s> The Appearance and Settings tabs have adjustments for icon and font size. </s>
<s> With an LCD, you're also going to want to use ClearType for the best text. </s>
<s> That will be under Appearances/Effects. </s>
<s> ClearType only helps if you're using the monitor's native resolution. </s>
<s> Otherwise it can get worse. </s>
<s> I have also tried to work around by reducing contrast to 57 and gamma to -50. </s>
<s> Any drawbacks of this? </s>
