I have an almost 10 year old PC that I've kept limping along, but finally seems to have bit the dust.
It simply won't turn on.
A power supply failure is the most obvious reason; however, I never heard any noises coming from it nor did I get a burning smell.
Instead, over the past week on other occasions when it wouldn't power on, I simply unplugged the cord and plugged it back into a different outlet.
I did this successfully probably three different times.
So I'm wondering whether this sounds more like a power cord issue rather than the power supply.
Yes, I could simply purchase a new cord and try it out, but thought I'd ask first since I've never heard of a power cord not working.
By the way, I don't expect to keep using the PC, but it would be nice to access a few things that had not been backed up.
