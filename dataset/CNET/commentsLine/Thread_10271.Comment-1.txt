hello, i'm having a heck of a time trying to find myself a udma mode-6 enabled motherboard to run ssd.
unfortunately, i cannot find the udma mode listed on many motherboard specification sheets.
asus recommened that i check out the p9x79 motherboard.
currently, i am running a asus p7p55d-e lx which is listed as having 2x 6/gbs sata ports.
however, udma 6 enabled ssd's are only being run @ udma 5... any tips on udma mode-6 motherboards would be great.
i am willing to go with amd or intel (preferably intel) cpus along with it.
thanks!
