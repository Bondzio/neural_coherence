1.1.1	Hi , A couple of days ago my computer was working happily , then I left it for a few hours , came home and it had died !	St
1.1.2	If i unplug and plug it in again the orange LED on the mobo lights up for a few seconds , the lights on the keyboard flash and the case fan twitches and thats it .	St
1.1.3	Although the psu would be my first suspect its a $ $ 550w thats only a few months old .	St
1.1.4	The mobo and processor are both 2.5 yrs old and are the only original components I have kept in there since i built it - everything else has been upgraded .	St
1.1.5	Could one of them have blown/died ?	Ques
1.1.6	I have inspected the mobo & all components and there is no smells , damage etc .	St
1.1.7	Is it possible that if the mobo goes it could blow the psu ?	Ques
1.1.8	System : mobo : Gigabite GA7-VAXP , 756DDR , XP1800 .	St
1.1.9	Thanks very much .	Polite

1.2.1	Loads of people warn me about NOT getting cheap ones as when they go they take ALL your tresured hardware too ... ..	St
1.2.2	I rekon you 're using a cheap-takky PSU ?	Ques
1.2.3	I 'm not too sure but that might be your problem .	St
1.2.4	I 'd look at the inside of your PSU and see if they 're is something wrong .	St
1.3.1	Hi , I got a mid range psu originaly , today after i wrote my original post i opened it up and it smelt of burnt electronics .	St
1.3.2	'Theres my problem ' - or so i thought .	St
1.3.3	I have since been to the store and bought a new psu of a different make ( still mid range ) , i have hooked it up to the mobo , cpu & ram and i still have the same problem .	St
1.3.4	The ram LED is lighting up on the mobo , so power must be getting through to it .	St
1.3.5	Is it possible for the mobo to die and kill the original power supply on its way out ?	Ques
1.3.6	Is there a way for me to test the mobo ?	Ques
1.3.7	I have also inspected the other components and there is no smell/damage .	St
1.3.8	Thanks Cat	St
1.4.1	Check the MB closely for bulging , leaking , domed top ( rounded ) capacitors .	St
1.4.2	One is too many .	St
1.4.3	This is a common problem with older equipment and may create all sorts of symptoms with your system .	St
1.4.4	If found , the easy and most practical fix is to replace the MB .	St
1.4.5	Best of Luck	St
1.5.1	I have this model mtrbd. , but regardless you need to closely inspect the mtrbd..	St
1.5.2	The usual suspects are the capacitors or possible bad memory .	St
1.5.3	If you notice a bugling , burst , blown or leaky caps , this is a very likely culprit .	St
1.5.4	Follow your nose for the burnt smell to its componets .	St
1.5.5	YES , a blown p/s unit can take out the mtbr .	St
1.5.6	plus even after replacing the p/s the secondary problem can backfire and take out the new p/s .	St
1.5.7	Thus , you need to inspect .	St
1.5.8	Try reducing the system , you need ONLY the 1 ram , mtrbd .	St
1.5.9	and p/s with kybd .	St
1.5.10	and video .	St
1.5.11	If it beeps like crazy or actually boots up , then some drive ( s ) is bad or even ram if multiple installs , swap around .	St
1.5.12	You can even remove the cpu and fan , and see if it beeps .	St
1.5.13	If it *doesn't* beep then ( it should beep ) , you have a serious mtrbd .	St
1.5.14	problem , replace is the best bet .	St
1.5.15	Check those caps .	St
1.5.16	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.6.1	Hi , Ive gone down to the minimum that willy said to test with and theres no beeps , i enen rotated my ram sticks , so im going to have to get another mobo .	St
1.6.2	Thanks for you help willy & stan .	St
1.6.3	Cat	St
