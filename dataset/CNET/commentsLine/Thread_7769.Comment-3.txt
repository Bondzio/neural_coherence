sorry wired and wireless used linksys model wrtgl about 5 of them but new one is linksys e-300 2 desktops wired 1 laptop wireless.
the router places the connection.
symptoms is slowdown with frequent disconnects which shows up at the isp as an error 1 or user requested disconnect.
so the techs only answer is faulty router as a matter of fact they dropped off another router brand new but the e-3000 is under a month old and under warranty, to tell all of what they said would take volumes and all they did is hooked there laptop and ran oakalla speed test to test there system nothing else.
at any point when i have called always the router thus replacing routers since no other providers in area i have to prove that it is not the router and according to my wife she believes we have been blackballed as a trouble customer due to calling about the trouble.
to many times.
my wife depends upon the internet for work and the slow downs and disconnects wrecks havoc on the online database she connects to.
