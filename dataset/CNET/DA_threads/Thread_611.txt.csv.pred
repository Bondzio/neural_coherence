1.1.1	I have a Dell Dimension 4700 minitower in which I would like to upgrade the video card and add a DVD burner .	St
1.1.2	The existing p/supply is 305 watts and my reading leads me to believe I need a new p/supply of 350w or larger .	St
1.1.3	I am using Windows XP SP3 and use the pc for email , general office work , and web surfing ( no gaming ) .	St
1.1.4	I have maxed out the RAM to 4GB and the drives include a floppy drive , a 500gb SATA hard drive and a DVD-rom drive and CD-burner .	St
1.1.5	The only p/supplies I have seen specifically for the 4700 are from KDM .	St
1.1.6	Can anyone give me any info on this company or recommend any other power supply units I should take a look at ?	Ques
1.1.7	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	I have a Dim .	St
1.2.2	4700 & have installed an Antec 500 watt PS in it .	St
1.2.3	Some good brands are Antec , PC power & colling , Corsair .	St
1.2.4	Just make sure it is ATX type an it will fit in your case without a hitch .	St
1.2.5	http : //www.newegg.com/Store/SubCategory.aspx ? SubCategory=58 & name=Power-Supplies	Ques
1.3.1	Should say PC power & cooling	St
1.4.1	SeaSonic is also good .	St
1.4.2	When you find one you want click on the specification tab & it will say if it 's ATX type or not .	St
1.5.1	here 's a high quality PSU by Corsair that will serve you well .	St
1.5.2	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16817139003 VAPCMD	Ques
1.6.1	fingerlid , Do you know the model you installed ?	Ques
1.6.2	Most of the PSU 's I 'm seeing online have the fan on top of the psu and that wo n't work with the 4700 minitower case I have .	St
1.6.3	Fan would have to be at the back or front to be able to pull air thru the psu .	St
1.7.1	I have the ANTEC EARTHWATTS 500 ATX 12V v2.2 Could n't say if they are still producing that model or not ?	Ques
1.8.1	Here 's my PSU .	St
1.8.2	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16817371007 & cm_re=antec_power_supply-_-17-371-007-_-Product	Ques
1.9.1	The one that VMAC posted will also work .	St
1.9.2	The fan intake would be on the bottom next to your green cpu shroud & would exaust out the back of your case .	St
1.10.1	fan is on the bottom when installed ... not the top .	St
1.10.2	Plus the Corsair has a 5 year warranty vs the Antec 3 year warranty .	St

St
1.10.4	VAPCMD	St
1.11.1	Actually IMO the Corsair would be the better choice .	St
1.12.1	If you buy a high quality PSU you will be able to pull it & install it on your next new computer as long as it has an ATX case .	St
1.12.2	A top quality PSU is always a good investment .	St
1.12.3	It should last for years .	St
1.12.4	After reading reviews for both I would buy the Corsair .	St
1.12.5	The reason I bought the Antec was I needed one quick & bought it at Best Buy .	St
1.12.6	The Antec is good but not as good as Corsair .	St
1.13.1	All good to know .	Polite
1.13.2	What about PC Power and Cooling ?	Ques
1.13.3	I found a Dell replacement p/supply they build at 500w meant for the 4700 ( PPCS500D ) .	St
1.13.4	I like the idea of it being set up for Dell , but also like the idea of taking out the other mentioned p/supply ( s ) later .	St
1.13.5	However , I probably wo n't be replacing this machine for at least 3 years , so do n't know if the portability is a big deal .	St
1.13.6	One thing - can I buy direct from PCC ?	Ques
1.13.7	Anybody know ?	Ques
1.13.8	The list of vendors on their site who supposedly carry their products is long , but every site I tried does n't even mention PPC as someone they carry .	St
1.13.9	Thanks .	Polite
1.14.1	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/ProductReview.aspx ? Item=N82E16817703011	Ques
1.15.1	and the Corsair ( $ 65 after MIR ) , PSU quality and that the PCP is not available 'til Feb 01 at Newegg or elsewhere ... . makes the Corsair look even more attractive .	St
1.15.2	VAPCMD	St
1.16.1	The Corsair has 30 amps on a single 12 volt rail whereas the PC power and cooling one only has 26 amps on it 's single 12 volt rail .	St
1.17.1	The Corsair has 33 amps on the +12volt rail .	St
1.18.1	I am going to check the measurements on my existing p/supply and go with the Corsair if it fits .	St
1.18.2	Thanks to the posters for all info and insight provided .	St
1.18.3	I 'll be back to let you know how things go .	St
