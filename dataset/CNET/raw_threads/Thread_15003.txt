Right click My Computer, select Properties. 2. Click on Hardware tab, click on Device Manager. 3. Expand Modems entry by clicking on the + sign, right click your modem and select Properties. 4. Click the Modem tab and slide the Speaker Volume adjustment to Off (all the way to the left). Click OK and close the window. This should shut off your modem's speaker. HTH, Paul
