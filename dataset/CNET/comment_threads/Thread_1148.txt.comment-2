do a serarch on google if necessary.
You should be be able to run 98 over it (just boot from cd) I was on 98 se and I recomend you upgrade at least to 2000 pro.
that I loaded over 98se.
That way all your files will remain in tact.
Alternatively burn all your files to cd (if u can get in) or load them on to a usb memory stick.
Sorry i cannot help any more.
