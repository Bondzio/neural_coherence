it has a ati radeon xpress 200 video card.
and the only thing i have done since i bought it was to add a bunch of ram to it.
it has xp home.
i am wanting a new lcd monitor maybe 19&quot;, but no more than 22&quot;.
i would like integrated speakers and a 5mm response rate or better.
i also want a swivel/tilt base.)
i know that integrated speakers arent usually very good, but i seldom use them.)
i now have a nec multisync lcd1700m+ (the multisync lcd1700m+ 17&quot; tft active matrix display has a 1280 x 1024@ 60hz resolution with .264mm dot pitch.
it has a horizontal frequency range of 30 - 81 khz, vertical frequency range of 56 - 75 hz, 160 degrees viewing angle, and built-in speakers.
it supports analog inputs and uses 15-pin mini d-sub.
black and white are colors available for this model. )
that i bought new quite a few years ago when they first came out, but it's starting to show its age.
will i need to get a new video card for a bigger monitor?
(im thinking wide screen) i have been looking at some samsung monitors, but i honestly havent had much of a problem with my nec after all these years.
but i am open to suggestons.
i also don't want to spend more than $200 for a new monitor.
i have no problem with a refurbished monitor.
i don't know if all the newer lcd monitors allow me to use a vga cord or not, but i need that also i think.
links to things would be appreciated.
thanks in advance!
!
