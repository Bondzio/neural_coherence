it seems that it may have gotten far enough so that if you start it again you may get the repair option, i think then if you elect repair, one option will be recovery console, but not sure.
i have installed xp in six computers and never had a problem, so i haven't done any of these things.
people in the xp forum should be able to help.
actually robeert proffitt would be a big help, but he may thing that i have things under control in this thread.
i'll ask him to check in but he's an east coaster so may have gone for the night.
