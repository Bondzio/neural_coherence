1.1.1	I recently picked up an imation flash drive .	St
1.1.2	It 's advertised as 8GB , but windows only shows 7.52GB of available space .	St
1.1.3	So I called Imation and asked them what was up with that .	St
1.1.4	They indicated that was normal , so I asked them why they advertised it as an 8GB drive if it really was n't .	St
1.1.5	The tech assured me it was an 8GB drive , so I asked him , if I tried to transfer 8GB of data to the drive , would it hold it ?	Ques
1.1.6	He said , & quot ; No. & quot ; Sound like false advertising to you ?	Ques
1.1.7	Sure does to me .	St
1.1.8	Is this standard for all flash drives , and if so , why ?	Ques
1.2.1	Windows calculates it differently so all we need to do is do the math .	St
1.2.2	Nothing wrong here .	St
1.2.3	Let 's look at your KILO WATT HOURS on your bill .	St
1.2.4	Kilo = 1000 and not 1024 .	St
1.2.5	There are some that want that to change but in a nutshell .	St
1.2.6	Kilo = 1000 Giga = 1,000,000,000 You see where this is going ?	Ques
1.3.1	formatting requires space .	St
1.3.2	Imagine a book with 300 pages .	St
1.3.3	It has a title page , an index , appendix , maybe a glossary , and there has to be space for pages numbers .	St
1.3.4	A certain number of pages have to devoted to keeping track of where data is located .	St
1.3.5	It 's the same way with your flash drive .	St
1.3.6	A certain amount of those 8 GB are dedicated to keeping track of where everything is located .	St
