on the motherboard you're using - some prefer one type of drive some prefer others and yet again you'll get some that are best with any drive, so the question is really irrelavent.
the only way really is to look at the manufacturers website, the only trouble is that they don't always give that information.
that leaves back at sqaure one.
failing any manufactuers information, try pot luck.
i can say though that maxtor drives seem to work well with more or less any motherboard designed for an amd cpu - so possibly it's the cpu that decides what's best!
