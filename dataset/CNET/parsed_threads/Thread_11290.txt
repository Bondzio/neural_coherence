<s> I have a question I was hoping you could help me with. </s>
<s> I have a Netgear WNR854T router connected to a Linksys BEFCMU10 Modem and a Netgear GS602 v2 Router. </s>
<s> I would like to add a wireless access point at the other end of the house. </s>
<s> I have run a cat 5 cable to the other end of the house. </s>
<s> I also have a Netgear WPN824 v2 Wireless router, can this be used as an acees pointand if not what would you suggest. </s>
<s> If I were to try this I'd end up with what they call a DOUBLE NAT. </s>
<s> There are issues which I won't discuss being trouble with network shares but the internet should work. </s>
<s> Just use the defaults except for the LAN IP Setup page. </s>
<s> If your one LAN is 192.168.0.x then your other wifi lan will be something like 192.168.1.x Sorry but I can't teach TCPIP basics here but that should be the only change needed to accomplish a DOUBLE NAT. </s>

<s> You lost me with this answer. </s>
<s> maybe you can make it a little more clear or maybe someone else has better details. </s>
<s> Still need a solution. </s>
<s> I used the EXACT words that this router has on it's setup page. </s>
<s> Since I used the exact words this means this is not going to get any clearer. </s>
<s> Time to buy a real WAP. </s>

<s> That's all I was looking for Bob. </s>
<s> All I wanted to know was &quot;IF&quot; I could use it and if I couldn't what I needed to get to make it work. </s>
<s> I am not an expert like yourself and that why I came here for help. </s>
<s> Sorry If I seem dumb to you. </s>
<s> I took the time to compare your router's manual with my router (nearly the same model) and used the EXACT words you would see on the router's setup screen. </s>
<s> I did this to make it as easy as possible and noted the ONE change I would do to make it work. </s>
<s> All this networking stuff does seem complex but if you need to go beyond the one change I'd try then it's back to the books or get a real WAP. </s>
<s> Hope you see I tried to make it as easy as I could. </s>
