First off clean the internet cache,do this by cliking on start,then clik control panel,clik performance and maintenance then clik on &quot;free up space on hdd&quot; the next two you have stated you have done i.e virus and spyware check just make sure you have the latest definitions for those and maybe install these adaware,spybot,microsofts new spyware app&gt;yes it is a good app,also google for javacoolsoftware =spywareblaster and spywaregaurd(both free and safe as i have an hp also) the progs you no longer use and deleted,make sure they are all gone and have'nt left behind icons and folders lastly defrag the hardrive (it's in the same place as free up space on your hdd = &quot;rearrange items on your hardrive to make programs run faster&quot; one thing i would advise is get norton system works as this will detect obsolete files,icons and clean out your cache plus other stuff it will do for you as chances are your registry is full of crap from installed progs and removed progs that won't be deleted go download registry mechanic and you'll see what i mean(word of caution norton is safe to use to delete registry entries where as reg mechanic and others will delete values still connected to working programs so becareful=bear in mind that this is only so for the full versions not the free trial as the free trial will only do the first 15 so you are safe to delete)
