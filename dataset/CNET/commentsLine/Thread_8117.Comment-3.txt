as bob implied, be sure your motherboard has the latest bios updates.
that chipset has been around for a while and has likely been updated.
check the mfg.
website for the the latest bios updates.
i recently replaced a board (new out of the box) in an old piii machine.
i had to update the bios before xp would install.
best of luck
