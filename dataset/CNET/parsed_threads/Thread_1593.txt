<s> I have had horrible experiences of late with ABS computers. </s>
<s> I was a long-time customer, and had great luck with them prior to the last year... </s>
<s> I bought a high-end notebook and workstation from them about a year ago... </s>
<s> The notebook died within months of purchase... needing a bios and hard drive replacement. </s>
<s> The workstation experienced motherboard failure almost immediately (related to a faulty USB port that seems to be endemic to the ASUS motherboard that was shipped with the unit). </s>
<s> To their credit, they replaced the computer... but its now a year later, and the computer went up in smoke yet again! </s>
<s> The company is dragging its feet with repairs (the thing croaked over a week ago).... needless to say they won't replace the computer (even though it is abundantly clear that the product is defective). </s>
<s> In the past year, the computer has been non-functional for over a month! </s>
<s> The company is utterly unapologetic, and utterly unresponsive to repair requests. </s>
<s> I heard a rumor that they are going under... is their any truth to this? </s>
<s> I'm thinking of buying the ABS Mayhem G4 A78. </s>
<s> I can't find any reviews of ABS notebooks on CNET unless I go back to 2004. </s>
<s> What is the reputation of this company? </s>
<s> but their desktops seem good. </s>
<s> I didnt have a problem with ABS machines. </s>
<s> I got an ABS from 2000 and never had any problems with it. </s>
<s> It even came with a 20 ich CRT which works to this day, but I replaced it with a 19 inch LCD. </s>
<s> The system had a P3, and worked fine until a coupke of months ago when I got broadband, and the whole system was infected with spyware. </s>
<s> That was my fault for not having anything to protect it. </s>
<s> The system works great, but I replaced it because I needed a more current computer. </s>
<s> I even have 2 removable hard drives on it. </s>
<s> I find ABS to be great PC builders. </s>
