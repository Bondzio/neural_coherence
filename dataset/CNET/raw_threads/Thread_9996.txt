The driver may be corrupted or missing.) I've tried running the driver update but a driver can't be located. Here's the weird part; I tried uninstalling &amp; reinstalling (by scanning for new hardware in device manager) the controller and when it reinstalled, the name of the hardware was completely different from the first time I uninstalled it. For example; Before uninstall it'll be something like AQXFHYW2 IDE Controller &amp; after reinstall it'll be a completely different series of random numbers &amp; letters. In the properties of the controller, the driver provider, date, version etc. are all unknown. Anyone ever hear of anything like this? Thanks in advance for any help Here are my system specs HP Pavilion Dv5t 1000 cto Intel Pro Core Duo 2 2Ghz 4GB RAM nVidia GeForce 9200M GS Graphics Card Windows Vista Home Premium 32bt Service Pack 2

Also, CODE 39 is one of the well discussed failures. If it's working don't fix this. Also 4GB on 32 bit OSes tend to do this a lot. Chalk it up to bad choices made years ago. Bob

This is actually a manufacturer replacement for the the first computer I ever owned (that was an older Pavilion series). That one kept crapping out so they finally replaced it with this, &amp; everything, including the RAM, was installed by HP. I haven't upgraded it @ all. That aside, how do I fix this? What will this problem effect? Can I just disable it &amp; forget about it? There is another device listed under storage controllers: Microsoft iSCSI Initator &amp; it's working fine.
