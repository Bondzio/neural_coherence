almost 3 years ago, i purchased a 60gb ocz ssd to use as my system drive.
it worked well, but was a bit small for my needs.
six months later, i bought a 100gb ocz vertex 2 drive and placed the 60gb unit in my wife's computer.
here are the results of this experiment: the 60gb drive has given no problems and is still running just fine in my wife's computer.
unfortunately, the 100gb drive did not work out as well.
the first 100gb drive failed after 6 months.
there was a 3-year warranty, so a replacement was sent in about a week.
the second drive lasted about 5 months.
the third lasted about two weeks, and i quit.
i got the replacement and sold it on e-bay.
it still had plenty of warranty left, but i did not want to keep replacing drives.
perhaps this experience is restricted to ocz vertex 2 drives, but i got gun-shy.
based on research, it seemed that samsung and intel have the most reliable drives.
i bought a samsung 830 128gb drive in july of 2012 and have had no trouble with it.
do your research, read the reviews, and make a choice on that basis.
the speed of bootup for windows is tremendous.
instead of waiting minutes to complete a booup, it only takes 25 seconds or less (depends on your drivers and overhead).
good luck.
