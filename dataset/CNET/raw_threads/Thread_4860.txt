I have my internal hard drive set up with 3 partitions. on the 1st partition I have XP sp1. I use that for a backup operating system. On the 2nd partition I have XP sp3 and I use it as my primary operating system. The 3rd partition is the largest and I use it just for storage. I dont really need it because I recently purchased a large external drive. I really want to try the Linux based Ubuntu operating system. Can I install it on the 3rd partition?

Now, saying that and doing that are two different things. Trail and error is the most instructive lesson you can learn. You already got a difficult setup now with XP sp1 and sp3 both installed. So, if you don't want your hard work wasted, take it one step at a time. The boot.ini file will have to involved during all this, so I suggest you save the current working one and/or NTldr file to return to before if all fails. In a round about way, if you've tried the &quot;live Ubuntu CD version&quot; you get an idea how that OS will work. You can &quot;sandbox&quot; it using a &quot;virtual setup&quot; allowing its install within its parameters and see how things work. Google more for virtual and check it out. I assume you already have some arrangement now to tell which OS to boot, like the startup menu. http://www.dnncreative.com/Tutorials/DNNTutorialsforAdvancedUsers/VirtualPC/tabid/394/Default.aspx tada -----Willy

If not there or unavailable then google away fro linux versions or the Linux world of things. It really makes a difference in that the more common(or popular) a device is the more likely you'll find Linux support for it. tada -----Willy

Not stuff I'm familiar with. I'm going to give it a try in a few days. It's a pain in the butt having to pull my graphics card out each time I want to boot Ubuntu. Otherwise the system hangs up on boot. I'm a single dad with 2 toddlers and my littlest one was diagnosed with pnuemonia today so I'm gonna just spend time with him and come back to it when he's healthy. thank you. sincerely, Steve
