1.2.1	http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-19688_102-0.html ? messageID=3206234 & tag=forums06 ; posts # 3206234 While I think the learning curve is no worse than Windows XP to Vista or 7 can you write specifically what support you are expecting ?	Ques

1.3.1	Support is critical now and as in the past .	St
1.3.2	However , while some users expect all support to come from the vendor as an endless supply should be wary as that has it plus and minus side .	St
1.3.3	Maker support is limited and in general resolves typical h/w and/or some s/w issues .	St
1.3.4	Do n't expect them to cure all ills if you do n't do some of the precautionary methods to help keep yourself from PC ills .	St
1.3.5	In other words , if the PC crashes , you 're in for a long wait or haul to fix .	St
1.3.6	If you like , check out & quot ; local shops & quot ; that supply various levels of support .	St
1.3.7	These of course are outside any vendor support and costs extra .	St
1.3.8	Of course , you can use the typical vendor support until it expires and then move on .	St
1.3.9	I mention this as only in a & quot ; business sense & quot ; it pays for itself , if anything you should have a quicker response and/or help & quot ; on-site & quot ; to resolve troubles .	St
1.3.10	As for Apple vs. IBM , pick one you feel bests serves your purpose .	St
1.3.11	I ca n't quell on real evidence here , but overall I do n't see Apple as leaps and bounds better than any IBM vendor , though I certainly do n't like & quot ; off shore support & quot ; as that alone has caused many a frustration end-user for repair .	St
