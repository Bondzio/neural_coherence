You can install a new larger HD on that computer, but you may have to install a hard disk controller on a PCI card if the drive is larger than 127GB (detailed explanation: 48bitLBA.com or Seagate.com ).
Does your current HD plug directly into your motherboard or into a PCI card?
If a PCI card, what is the name of the PCI hard disk controller card?
BOTTOM LINE: Get a &lt; 127GB ATA/100 or ATA/133 hard drive if you stick with Windows98SE.
You might want to consider upgrading to Windows XP to avoid some complications and have a more stable OS, in general.
