I have the latest drivers, and have allways kept up with all of my system drivers, including my monitor and sound card.
It isnt the RAM, as I bought new RAM to see if that would help, but it didnt help.
I cant afford a new video card, and Im sure there is a fix seeing as I cant be the only person to have had this trouble.
