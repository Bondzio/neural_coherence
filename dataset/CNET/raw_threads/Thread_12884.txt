Is this in line with the transfer rates for a USB 2.0. Here's a copy of the specs from the Buy.Com sight and the URL. Do these fit the specifications for USB 2.0?? in terns of transfer rate or are they trying to put one over on us. Thanks Guys Tcj http://www.buy.com/prod/ACP_EP_Memory_512MB_USB_2_0_Flash_Drive_for_Mac_and_PC_span_class/q/loc/101/10356041.html Standard Warranty - 2 Year(s) Manufacturer - ACP-EP Memory Storage Capacity - 512 MB Interfaces - USB 2.0 - USB Manufacturer Part Number - MY14575 Data Transfer Rate - 8MBps Read Data Transfer Rate - 6MBps Write Form Factor - Hot-swappable Manufacturer Website Address - www.acp-ep.com Product Name - 512MB PowerUser Drive USB 2.0 Flash Drive Compatibility - Supported Operating Systems

I'm assuming the low speed is for the backward compatibility issue with 1.0 and 1.1 here's the two links I found although I'm still unclear if this flash drive is actually compliant with the specifications for 2.0 hoping someone can help.
