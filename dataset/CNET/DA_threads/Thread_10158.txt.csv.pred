1.1.1	Hi all , a colleague at my university is using an Airport Time Capsule 1TB ( Model A1355 ) to share files with his students wirelessly .	St
1.1.2	The machines are running Leopard 10.5.8 and It works well but it will only allow 20 wireless clients at a time .	St
1.1.3	All the client machines log in with a password .	St
1.1.4	When you remove one of the 20 , another can log in .	St
1.1.5	The tech specs on the Apple website just say that it accepts Wireless guest access and there is no mention of a 20 client limit .	St
1.1.6	I looked right through Airport Utility and could n't find where the number of wireless clients could be configured .	St
1.1.7	http : //www.apple.com/uk/timecapsule/ Does anybody know if this is the hard limit for the number of wireless clients for an Airport Time Capsule 1TB ( Model A1355 ) ?	Ques
1.1.8	If it is not a hard limit does anybody know how to change it ?	Ques
1.1.9	Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated !	Polite
1.2.1	While you can call apple , most access points have limits from 16 to 32 so this is right in there .	St
1.2.2	Besides , would n't having that many on one access point be a great way to kill the speed ?	Ques

1.3.1	Hi Bob , Thanks for your reply .	Polite
1.3.2	Having that many clients access the drive to copy files off does n't raise any speed issues but I can imagine it would if we were using it to share internet access .	St
1.3.3	It seems fair enough to limit the number of clients to 16 to 32 , unfortunately our classes average 25 so the 20 limit is a little annoying !	St
1.3.4	A near miss .	St
1.3.5	I 'll contact Apple directly and see if I can get to the bottom of the specs for the Time Capsule in question .	St
1.3.6	I 'll post the results for anyone else who finds this thread .	St
1.3.7	Thanks again for your help and interest .	St

1.4.1	Will be slow when more than a few are copying files .	St
1.4.2	Here 's why .	St
1.4.3	Unlike a wired connection where a switched hub keeps the pipes full and you get as much as possible from the server to each machine , WIFI is SHARED AIR SPACE so as each user is copying out it goes slower and slower at worse than one divided by the number of users copying out .	St
1.4.4	For web browsing the use pattern is such that it 's not as noticeable .	St
