am going to look at a pc @ walmart ... wife works there, we get a 10 percent discount ... zt systems box, i7-2600 3.4 ghz processor, comes stock with 16 gigs of ram, 2 tb hd (although it's 5400 rpm green instead of 7,200, don't really care though) and bluray/dvd/cd writer, comes bundled with hannspree monitor, $950 including extended warranty.
may be best balance between going cheapo and overspending.
have checked zt systems out, seeing pretty much universal positive reviews as no-frills but solid product which is right up my alley.
thanks for input.
