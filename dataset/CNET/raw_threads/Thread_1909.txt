It is not the one recommended for my DEll but it looks exactly the same as the listed one. My question- if it fits perfectly, will it work? Thanks, Bob

You cannot just pick up a RAM stick and expect it to work. It must be matched to the system board, clock, BIOS, existing RAM, etc. Go to crucial.com and use the Wizard.
