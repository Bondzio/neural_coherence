thanks.
i was looking at boxee, appletv, and roku (no internal storage); popcorn hour a-210, dune hdi, ps3, and xbox (not a perfect fit for one or another reason and guis received some complaints); and small form factor htpcs like asus eee 1021, zbox ad-02, and others with amd fusion e-350 apu (expensive for what it can do).
i'm probably going to pull the trigger on the purchase in a few days and appreciate you looking the config over.
