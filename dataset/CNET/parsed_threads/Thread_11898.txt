<s> Hey guys,My computer has been working fine, but the other day i opened it up and pulled out the power supply to see what wattage it had (just bought it and curious). </s>
<s> I did not disconnect it to anything else in the computer, just unscrewed it from the back so i could slide it over and see the sticker on the side. </s>
<s> I put it all back but now the power button on the outside of the case you normally use to turn the computer on is not working. </s>
<s> The only way i can turn on the computer right now is by opening it up, and pressing the power button on my motherboard. </s>
<s> Everything else works perfectly. </s>
<s> 1) So why is the outside power button not working? </s>
<s> 2) what should i do to fix this? </s>
<s> Any help would be thoroughly appreciated -WooDy </s>

<s> The momentary switch that turns on the PC connects there. </s>
<s> You'll need to trace the wiring but it should have a 2 connector plug and the wires are often red and black. </s>
<s> You'll want to make sure you didn't dislodge it when you moved the PS. </s>
<s> I've not seen the front panel harness dressed around PS harnesses but it could happen and moving the PS could be enough to unplug the connector. </s>
<s> Sorry about my lack of computer knowledge. </s>
<s> Trace the wiring up to the power button? </s>
<s> or are you saying trace it to power supply or motherboard? </s>
<s> I tried tracing up to the button on the inside but i have no idea how to get in there. </s>
<s> I didn't see any screws that open that section up. </s>

<s> Most of these just snap on to the metal framework. </s>
<s> You need to remove the side covers first. </s>
<s> I've built PCs using Antec cases and they usually have some barbed projection that passes through the frame. </s>
<s> You need to get to where you can see them clearly. </s>
<s> There will be two or three on each side and you need to push them to one side to release them. </s>
<s> From there you can get to the innards of the front panel connections and one of these will be the momentary switch that powers on the PC. </s>
<s> Note the color of the two wires and trace that through the front of the frame to the motherboard. </s>
<s> There should be an array of pins somewhere on the motherboard that these connections go to and it's usually two rows of about 8 pins. </s>
<s> If you find a disconnect at the motherboard, you've probably found your problem. </s>
<s> If you're not comfortable with doing this, you probably need to seek help. </s>
<s> If you take it to a shop, be prepared to pay a hefty bench fee just to look at it. </s>
<s> I don't know the rates these days but they are probably upward of 80 bucks just to plunk it on the counter. </s>
