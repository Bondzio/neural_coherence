thank you again for all of the help.
i tried running a cat6 cable directly between the router to the ap without the powerline adapters and it started working perfectly.
if i walk around the house while running a constant ping to the main router's ip, it times out only for 1-2 seconds while it seamlessly switches between the router and the ap's wifi zones!
it seems as if the powerlines really cannot handle the auto-sensing feature when a cable is being used for a lan-to-lan connection.
what's weird is that with the powerline the internet still would work, it just wouldn't work if i left that zone and then returned back to that zone (after having connected to the router's wifi zone).
i'm so glad i got this working, but now the nerdy side of me is wondering about the how's and why's of why it wasn't working before.
do you experts think it was just the powerline not being able to auto-sense the cable or did it have something to do with arp tables and ports?
thank you!
