&gt;&gt;set up some remote access like vnc or even windows remote desktop and then you can access it from there.&lt;&lt; this is one option to access it.but how can i access it as http if it is feasible ?
&gt;&gt;it appears you forgot port 20&lt;&lt; yes i did not configure that ,,,,do i need to configure that as well ?
right now it is working without port 20 has been configured.
thanks
