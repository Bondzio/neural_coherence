Hope you don't mind me ask, I am also riddled with a similar scenario after purchasing a MacBook Pro and selling my netback. I have a military grade Maxtor External HD and I CAN NOT even seem to be able to find it when plugging it into my MBP via the USB portals. PLEASE HELP ANYONE!! =( Arnold

Current versions can see NTFS volumes just fine. There is also other solutions like having a friend with a PC copy then out to DVD or another HDD. I've used Linux (Ubuntu to be specific) to connect 2 HDDs, one in NTFS and the other in AFS and drag the files over. MacFUSE is worth some research if your OSX is outdated. Bob
