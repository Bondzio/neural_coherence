&quot;i would be able to keep the wired usb connection and add a wireless laptop via ethernet through the wireless modem?

the ethernet standard (802.3) is primarily used with cat5 cabling, while a wireless connection (802.11) is just that.
ps: try following the advice laid out here (  ) for a more precise scan.
