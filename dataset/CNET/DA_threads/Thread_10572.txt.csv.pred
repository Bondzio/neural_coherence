1.1.1	I 've had my Hyundai Image Quest L90D+ for about 4 months .	St
1.1.2	Yesterday , I was using my computer and I noticed that I have two lines running from top to bottom .	St
1.1.3	One is about an inch from the vertical edge of the monitor , the other is about two inches from the vertical edge of the monitor .	St
1.1.4	I disconnected my monitor and unplugged it .	St
1.1.5	I let it sit overnight and reconnected it this morning .	St
1.1.6	The lines are still there .	St
1.1.7	The only difference is that Instead of one line being blue and the other line being red , one line is now green and the other line is blue with a hint of red around the edges .	St
1.1.8	How can I fix this problem ?	Ques
1.1.9	Anyone else have this problem with the L90D ?	Ques
1.1.10	Anyone else have this problem with the L90D ?	Ques
1.2.1	I believe it would have to be returned ; see also : http : //www.techsupportforum.com/showthread.php ? t=72474	Ques
1.3.1	Thanks for the advice .	St
1.3.2	I 'm working on sending the monitor back now .	St
1.3.3	Just got my RMA number .	St
1.4.1	Change the REFRESH RATE to another supported number and see if the item in question moves left/right or vanishes .	St
1.4.2	If it changes then it 's likely a cable or video card issue .	St
1.4.3	To nail this one , you need to test the display on another PC .	St
1.4.4	bob	St
1.5.1	5 month old L90D+ has nasty line down right third of display .	St

1.6.1	We just purchased our Hyundai L90D+ monitor 2 weeks ago and Im getting vertical lines about 2 inches from the right side of the screen .	St
1.6.2	Started with one line , then 2 and now this morning I see 4 lines !	St
1.6.3	Green and red in colour .	St
1.6.4	Will return as soon as possible !	St
1.6.5	Expected better from a Korean brand ...	St
1.7.1	I sent my montitor back to Hyndai to be replaced .	St
1.7.2	They were fairly quick in replacing my monitor and they gave me no problems .	St
1.7.3	I 'm keeping my fingers crossed as I have not had any problems with the replacement .	St
1.7.4	Maybe it 's just superstition , but I noticed that the lines on my first monitor appeared near the on/off switch .	St
1.7.5	I wonder if the pressure from pressing that button caused the lines , so now , I never used the on/off switch and just let the monitor power down when my computer turns off .	St
1.8.1	i bought mine through tigerdirect .	St
1.8.2	in about 3 weeks , i had the same streaking occur on the right 1/5 of the monitor .	St
1.8.3	i told tigerdirect about it and they replaced it free of charge .	St
1.8.4	now i 'm having the same problems with the replacement ( same model ) .	St
1.8.5	i tried returning it to tiger , but they only accept returns within 30 days , so i 've contacted the manufacturer .	St
1.8.6	unfortunately i have n't heard back from them yet , after emailing twice and calling once .	St
1.8.7	so i 've been stuck with this monitor for maybe 2 months .	St
1.8.8	if you let it go on for a while , it gets really bad !	St
1.8.9	now it almost looks posessed !	St
1.8.10	the right 1/5 of the screen is totally covered in streaks .	St
1.8.11	sometimes you can see through them and it looks like someone used the blur tool in photoshop !	St
1.8.12	sometimes that side just goes white , and then the rest of the screen looks fine , but the worst is when the lines start flickering rapidly back and forth , causing the whole screen to freak out .	St
1.8.13	not fun .	Polite
1.8.14	i 'm glad the warranty is for 3 years , hopefully , if these problems keep occuring , they 'll just send me a better model later on .	St
1.8.15	for now , i 'm just waiting until business hours so i can call again .	St
1.8.16	but i 'm glad to hear it 's not just happening on my system - i was starting to wonder if i had some weird power issue or the graphics card was causing the problems .	St

St
1.9.7	After reading many reivews I decided on the L90D+ , but I have one concern .	St
1.9.8	A larger portion of the recent reviews describe a problem with vertical lines appearing on the right sides of the screen within one to three months of use .	St
1.9.9	I am wondering if this situation has been corrected in the latest production line ?	Ques
1.9.10	Thanks , Drew	St
1.10.1	I bought 2 of these monitors in September 2005 .	St
1.10.2	One went bad within 30 days .	St
1.10.3	Hyundai replaced it .	St
1.10.4	In February the replacement and the other original monitor went bad .	St
1.10.5	All three of the monitors have the same problem of vertical lines on the right hand side of the machine .	St
1.10.6	I am still waiting to find out if they are going to charge me shipping for the replacements .	St
1.11.1	I had 2 different pc 's and monitors went bad on both .	St
1.11.2	I do n't use the on off switch at all and I have had 3 monitors go bad .	St
1.11.3	All same problem .	St
1.12.1	I bought mine from Tigerdirect also .	St
1.12.2	After 30 days they are no help at all .	St
1.12.3	That was the last purchase I will make from Tigerdirect .	St
1.12.4	I ave not had any problem in contacting Hyundai or getting replacements .	St
1.12.5	The number I called was 1-800-568-0060	St
1.13.1	I currently have 2 monitors I am sending back with the streaking symptom , that makes a total of 3 I have had to send back .	St
1.13.2	I have to pay to ship these units back .	St
1.13.3	I understand that once and a while something can go wrong with a unit but this problem is one Hyundai is aware of .	St
1.13.4	I think it is very poor business practices for a company to require customers to pay shipping for a known factory defect .	St
