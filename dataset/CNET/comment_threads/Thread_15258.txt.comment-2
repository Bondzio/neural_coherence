It really matters how much you want to spend.
I would say new motherboard to keep up with the new technologies, you get better performance also.
But if you add up the cost of all the hardware requires(motherboard, CPU, memory, maybe new cables) it would be better to buy a new computer.
PCI will do for maybe a year but then you would need a new computer anyway.
I would honestly buy a new core 2 duo desktop as they have great performandce and are relatively cheap.
