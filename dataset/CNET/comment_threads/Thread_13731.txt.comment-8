to computer room, booted up on battery, plugged in the cable to the router and decided to update AVG,Spybot & AdawareSE and the connection started up PERFECTLY NORMALLY!!!
Now seems to be working exactly as it always has including &lt; 10 sec connection (@ 100.0 mbps thanks)!
Dam_ Wayne, your telepathic skills are amazing!!LOL!
Thanks to all for viewing & considering my plight!
Guess it's time to create a few more restore points!
