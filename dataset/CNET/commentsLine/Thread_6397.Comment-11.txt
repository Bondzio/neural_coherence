you can't expect the graphics card manufacturers to pause their designs for 2 to 3 years.
why would they do that?
judging from the recent trends, diverse graphics functions (shaders etc.)
are given priority over sheer speed.
that is not to say they're slow.
but you must admit, the new models have added bells and whistles than just speed increments.
so there will be games that'll work on your current setup but they might look very different on future cards.
so can you call it future-safe?
these companies have a way of crippling very good systems just because they want to sell more junk.
i come from a computer science background and i strongly feel towards not wasting computing resources.
your quad core with 4gb of ram has a lot of potential to someone who knows what they're doing... but it's nothing if you're going to chase after ideals set by companies that just want to grab all your money... but what's the point in telling you.
really!?
