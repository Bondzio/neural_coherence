My operating system is Windows XP. Has anyone experienced this same problem, if so, what did you do to fix it?
12250	1	307151	2848866	2848865	Kees Bakker	9/3/08 12:30 PM	1.220445E12	I would contact Dell.	Important information to tell: is it a new all-in-one (warranty!) or is it 5 year old already (then probably they will tell you to buy a new one). Anything in between might be interesting. Kees
