I just purchased a &quot;MSX-M4GST/X&quot; memory stick, and I've immediatly got a blue screen of death from it.
After some investigation I've determined this stick is a counterfeit, and a very good one at that.
There is a guide here which explains the counterfeit chips: http://reviews.ebay.com/FAKE-Sony-Memory-Stick-Pro-Duo-MagicGate-Cards-Exposed_W0QQugidZ10000000001236041?ssPageName=BUYGD:CAT:-1:LISTINGS:2 I purchased mine on ebay so I'm going through the process of getting a full refund from the seller.
