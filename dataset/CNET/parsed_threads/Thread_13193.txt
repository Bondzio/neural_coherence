<s> Quick run down of my setup before I get to my question. </s>
<s> Boot Drive: 128GB SSD Media Drive: 2TB internal HDD 1st Backup: 3TB external HDD 2nd Backup: 3TB external HDD I keep most of my stuff on the external now, really only leaving stuff I regularly listen to /watch on the internal drives. </s>
<s> I'm using SyncToy 2.1 to mirror one drive onto the other, I would have liked to triple save it with a third 3TB, but with my budget two will have to do for now. </s>
<s> My question is whether or not I can have the external drives stop spinning while plugged in. </s>
<s> I know that in the Power Options I can set the hard drive to turn off after a while, but I think that's just for when the whole computer goes to sleep. </s>
<s> I've been running Folding at Home continuously for over a month now, and I'd like to keep doing that so sleeping isn't an option for me anymore. </s>
<s> But I worry that these external 3TB drives are kind of cheap (I got them each for around 115$ - 120$), so... when not using them I'd like them to just go to sleep. </s>
<s> I'm not an expert on this, but I imagine less strain and heat will help them last longer. </s>
<s> I looked in Disk Management but all I'm really seeing here is ways of formatting the drives (which is certainly not what I want to do). </s>
<s> I figured I could just unplug them and replug them when needed, but I know that doing that excessively can wear out the ports, which could just as easily kill my ability to use the drives. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> While I read what you want, I've seen this area to be a little out of sight for the makers of the PCs and more. </s>
<s> That is, I found no maker or OS writer to get the band to play in unison. </s>
<s> I've had such drives last for so long with then spinning that what happens is they become too small over time. </s>
<s> My original 200MB external still worked but with a 1GB USB stick hitting you know a Happy Meal price, it had to go. </s>
<s> Good luck in getting the industry to play along. </s>

<s> So... short answer no, there's no way? </s>
<s> Shame. </s>
<s> Thanks for answering at least. </s>
<s> The other tech-help forums I asked seem to have ignored my question. </s>
<s> It may or may not work. </s>
<s> And no one seems to respond about it. </s>
<s> At least the drives under normal temperatures and such should spin for 5 or more years. </s>
<s> Spinning down from what I see (at the office we have some embedded recorders with HDDs) had no effect on aging. </s>
