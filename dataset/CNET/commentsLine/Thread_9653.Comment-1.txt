hi, i'm driving myself nuts over this problem.
i have a belkin pre n router, and a dell inspiron 1505 with the 1500 draft-n card.
i keep dropping connection totally.
i know that the belkin isn't a compatible router using the 802.11n speeds.
when i plug into the router or modem i have no problems.
when i do drop the connection when i go to the available wireless networks list i see my router, but when i try to connect it says that i have a low wireless signal problem.
i have verified with another computer running xp pro tablet edition and the connection doesn't seem to drop out the couple times i have noticed it.
(btw i have vista home premium) any ideas?
if i need to buy a new router that isn't a problem.
these are the routers that are &quot;approved&quot; so to speak: # netgear wnr834b # linksys wrt300n # buffalo wzr-g300n thanks folks.
ya'll have been very helpful in the past and appreciate that very much!
