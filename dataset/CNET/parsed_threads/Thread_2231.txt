<s> 1680 x 1050 is the best setting for this monitor and what I use. </s>
<s> Wrong question!!! </s>
<s> The correct question is: What is the native resolution of your display to have the expected picture quality? </s>
<s> It is recommendable to use always the native resulution of the display instead of an induvidual setting. </s>
<s> Before you purchase a display you have the chance to select the preferable resolution and screen size based on the performance of your video card. </s>
<s> Also here you will find out soon that the variety will be limited. </s>

<s> There are lots of variables: 1) Size of screen 2) Quality of monitor/screen 3) Quality and capability of Video card 4) Personal preference, depending on one's eyes. </s>
<s> Usually, the higher the screen resolution is, the better the image is. </s>
<s> So, the maximun resolution offered by the monitor should be used. </s>
<s> The monitor's aspect ratio is important here. </s>
<s> For gaming and watching HD movies, an aspect ratio of 16:9 is prefered. </s>
<s> For general PC usage, a 8:5 (16:10) aspect ratio is better. </s>
<s> The resolution used for gaming also depends on the power of the GPU. </s>
<s> Putting all these into consideration, a 24 inch monitor with an aspect ratio of 8:5 used at a resolution of 1920 x 1200 pixels is a good choice for general usage, gaming and watching HD movies.. </s>

<s> Indeed, but when it comes to monitors the best resolution will always be the one native to your display (in my case 1920x1080). </s>
