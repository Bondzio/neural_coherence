hello, I just built a new system with an abit kd7a board and an AMD athlon 2200 cpu.
a few questions-- the CPU speed is setting up as 1500 mhz, is this correct or is it defaulting to a slower speed?
(I can't find info on the ghz speed of this 2200 cpu anywhere!)
note i do not want to overclock .
.
.
and, should I bother to clear the cmos memory?
thanks - fj
