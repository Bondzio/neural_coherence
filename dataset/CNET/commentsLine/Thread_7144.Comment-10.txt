the yellow shield is there to tell you your product isn't working, or communicating with your computer, to take instuctions on how to act and respond.
so connect your usb cable.
if you don't have the software,it's ok. windows navtive work just fine.
you just look on the ups tab on your power properties and match the probable ups model.
you can usually find the model number on the back of the ups.
even that isn't as important as telling the ups what to do during a power outage, how long to stay on during power outage, whether to go to hibernation.
hope some of this helps
