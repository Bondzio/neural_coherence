1.1.1	I've been researching network hardwear for three days and can't find a highly rated pci adapter.	St
1.1.2	The Linksys WRT54G router is high up there, but the wmp54G pci adapter has been having problems.	St
1.1.3	Looked at a usr 5416 it lacks WAP, anyone have any ideas on a good combination for a router and pci adapter	St
1.2.1	D-link.	St
1.2.2	Cable modem, wired/wireless router, 3 NICs, and wireless PC NIC for the laptop.	St
1.2.3	Absolutely zero problems, excellent support and free upgrades.	Polite
1.2.4	And because all devices are D-link, they all recognize each other and installaion and configuration is a snap.	St
1.2.5	Whatever you get, don't mix and match brands, you'll be asking for headaches.	St
1.2.6	Good luck, Click here to see the CNet faces, learn a little about internet connections and data, and download free software.	St
1.2.7	Suppose you were an idiot.	St
1.2.8	.	St
1.2.9	.	St
1.2.10	And suppose you were a member of Congress.	St
1.2.11	.	St
1.2.12	.	St

1.3.1	Thanks for your reply.	St
1.3.2	I'm from Montana, and am busy raising lean Angus beef and US #1 hard red springwheat to keep all you US citizens healthy with sharp minds, so I greatly appreciate your helping me.Found a D-Link DI-624 router and DWL-G520 adapter that I think will work, or the DWL-G620 (faster).	St
1.3.3	I read some feedback that said the adapter was a pain to install, so go with DWL-G122 USB adapter, but taking that advice with a grain of salt, can't be that tough can it?	St
1.3.4	I have a system with Windows 98SE and a new Dell with XP Pro that I want to network.	St
1.3.5	The adapter will go in XP system.	St
1.3.6	What is your take on this hardware?	St
1.4.1	Keep it simple.	St
1.4.2	My system is about a year old and it includes a DCM-200 cable modem, DI-614+ router, three DFE-530TX+ NICs (internal), and one DWL-650L1 PCMCIA NIC for the laptop.	St
1.4.3	I firmly believe too many people try to get the most bells and whistles rather than opting for just a good stable system.	St
1.4.4	I'm not familiar with the newest equipment, but if I were to do it again, I'd choose the same type of equipment.	St
1.4.5	Nothing fancy, nothing special.	St
1.4.6	Just a good overall system.	Polite
1.4.7	And keep this in mind when you see all the hype about speed.	St
1.4.8	Any home network will run faster than any cable or DSL connection, so you don't need any Gazillion bit/Byte modem.	St
1.4.9	File transfer speed is another hype.	St
1.4.10	The figures of 1 Gb/s speed are a total lie.	St
1.4.11	Maybe in a testing lab, under perfect conditions, maybe.	St
1.4.12	But files transfer differently.	St
1.4.13	Twenty, 1 meg files will transfer slower than one 20 meg file.	St
1.4.14	It's just the way it works.	St
1.4.15	I've done it, I've tested it, and I've proved it.	St
1.4.16	But I digress.	St
1.4.17	Find a simple system that you like as the prices today are great.	St
1.4.18	It was once said (by me I think), &quot;The best system you can buy is the one you like.&quot; Good luck, Click here to see the CNet faces, learn a little about internet connections and data, and download free software.	St
1.4.19	Suppose you were an idiot.	St
1.4.20	.	St
1.4.21	.	St
1.4.22	And suppose you were a member of Congress.	St
1.4.23	.	St
1.4.24	.	St
1.4.25	But I repeat myself.	St

1.5.1	And keep that beef coming.	Sug
1.5.2	Screw the tree huggers and vegetarians.	St
1.5.3	Give it to me medium, about 20 ozs.	St
1.5.4	with lots of juice and a cold beer from the wheat.	St
1.5.5	Wayne	St
1.6.1	Wayne, thanks for all the help, but I still have some questions.	Polite
1.6.2	I want to print form both computers, d-link says I need a di-707 (router w/ print server), dwl-2100ap (access point), along with the dwlg520 adapter, I want to go with the 520 and just the di624 router.	St
1.6.3	Can I enable windows file&print sharing and get the same job done without any problems?	St
1.6.4	Can I use my scanner with the same setup.	St
