I have a Dell 2350 running a celeron processor at 1.8 GHZ.
Ive upgraded memory, power supply and video and graphics card and now for fun Id like to try a new better processor.
Pentium if possible or a faster Celeron.
As expected Dell told me no way but Im wondering if any one has had any luck with this.Thanks in advance for any response.
