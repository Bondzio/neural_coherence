which routers currently have good content filtering?
i am looking at possibly replacing my netgear 7230 since it seems to &quot;choke&quot; after too much use.
i like the &quot;content filtering&quot; subscription the router allows since i can keep my family from stumbling on certain sites.
i did purchase another router that claimed it supported content filtering, but that required entry of each site.
i am definitely not doing that.
do any other consumer-grade routers support this?
i have used a sonicwall soho for a several years, but their annual fee for content filtering was much too high for my usage.
