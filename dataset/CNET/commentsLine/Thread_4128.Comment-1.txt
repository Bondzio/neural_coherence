hello, i am interesed in attaching small containers/trays (about 2 - 4 inches in width) to my flat screen monitor.
i was wondering if anyone has any suggestions on how to attach the tray to the monitor without it scratching my monitor.
ideally, i would like the option for the container to be next to the side of the monitor or to be hidden behind the monitor.
this would mean that whatever the container is attached to must be flexible enough so that i can slide the tray to the back of the monitor.
any ideas?
thanks!
