A common cause is the video card has come unplugged.
I don't see where you tell us you opened it up to check all cards, connections.
Another 3 beeps is NO RAM.
Just a few months back someone brought one in and we opened it up and there was no RAM.
Good thing we did or I bet they would claim we took the RAM.
