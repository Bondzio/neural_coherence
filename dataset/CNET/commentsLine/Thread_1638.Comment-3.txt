back cover title says it's msi-u210x, and it's not quite mine i could tell you an age, but bios ver - 2009 dec, so i can assume it's about 2-2.5 years.. and, i guess, you'll stand the point of changing mb whatever.. mmm, for me - to change mb is to give someone for repairing.. is here something i could change by myself?
