As you already passed 60FPS anything beyond that is gravy.
I have seen 120FPS and played the same at 60 so for me this is not something I would be doing.
HOWEVER the 3850 is ON THE LIST at http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card,2064-6.html Let's stop with this -&gt; &quot;this is the most powerful AGP card you can get&quot;!
