just wanted to upgrade the drive.
it was working fine until i put the new (known good) drive in.
i've replaced the drives on a lot of the maxtor external drives and never had a problem before.
just this time on the shared storage drive.
the only thing i can guess is that the internal os needs the drive in a specific format before it will recognize it.
