1.1.2	Thank you .	St
1.2.1	I 'm looking for advice about this computer .	St
1.2.2	I 'm looking for e new desktop for digital imaging .	St
1.2.3	How has this machine preformed for everyone ?	Ques
1.3.1	The Gateway GT5032 is a great computer for processor-intensive operations , if you are n't afraid to do a couple of upgrades .	St
1.3.2	1 . )	St
1.3.3	You need a 'real ' graphics card .	St
1.3.4	The cpu ships with an onboard nVidia GeForce 6100 video processor on the motherboard .	St
1.3.5	Good for everyday stuff , but not so good for serious computing .	St
1.3.6	I upgraded to a GeForce 7800 GT OC PCI Express card .	St
1.3.7	2 . )	St
1.3.8	It ships with 1 gig of PC-3200 DDR memory ( DO NOT believe the tech assistance info here .	St
1.3.9	It falsely says the system uses PC-4200 DDR2 , it does NOT . )	St
1.3.10	Install at least one more gig ( there are 4 memory slots each supporting up to 1 gig ) of high quality DDR ( I used Dual channel matched Corsair memory ) .	St
1.3.11	The unit ships with 1 gig CAS 3 memory , you can do much better .	St
1.3.12	After these upgrades I can easily play 2 instances of Dark Age of Camelot on the computer without missing a beat .	St
1.3.13	Photo editing is a breeze , even if my antivirus is scanning in the background .	St
1.3.14	One caveat here , while the Media Center computer has 7 USB2 ports and 2 Firewire ports , it only has one PCI Express slot and 2 PCI slots , one of which is occupied with a useless 56K modem , and the other with the TV tuner .	St
1.3.15	Consequently expandability is very limited .	St
1.3.16	The GT5032 does not have a 3.5 & quot ; floppy drive .	St
1.3.17	On the plus side , thanks to its BTX motherboard/layout this is one very quiet computer !	St
1.3.18	It also has convenient memory card slots in the front .	St
1.3.19	This is a good little computer , that with some cash and a bit of tweaking can be a great one .	St
1.4.1	Bought this computer yesterday , and tv locked up minutes after install ... saw lots of peoples ' reviews at retail stores after purchase , who stated same problem .	St
1.4.2	Found it hard to believe the & quot ; pros & quot ; at Consumer Reports # 1 Retailer - MicroCenter ( KS ) did not have a clue about this problem and recommended this as a great media center computer for tv use .	St
1.4.3	Went back to store next day and they offered to exchange..hahaha .	St
1.4.4	Luckily , searched Google one last time for a solution tonight ... and here it is ... the update from Microsoft provided by & quot ; The Wesker & quot ; fixed the problem asap ! ! ! ! !	St
1.4.5	Have been running tv now for about 2+ plus hours without skips , stalls , freezing , etc .	St
1.5.1	lpaultracy , I noticed that the power supply on the GT5032 is only 300W max .	St
1.5.2	The minimum for the GeForce 7800 GT OC PCI Express card is 400W .	St
1.5.3	Did you also replace the power supply when you tweaked your GT5032 ?	Ques
1.5.4	I 'm getting very flaky results with the standard 300W power supply and the BFG help desk said that it was because of the lack of power .	St
1.6.1	I would also like to know if he had to upgrade the power supply .	St
1.7.1	I did end up upgrading my power supply .	St
1.7.2	However , I am still having problems running two monitors .	St
1.7.3	If I leave the hardware acceleration at ''Full '' then I get both monitors going black , with the only recourse left is to reboot .	St
1.7.4	I have monitored the video card and cpu temperature and they are all in the normal range .	St
1.7.5	It varies from 15 minutes to several hours before it shuts off .	St
1.7.6	I have hibernate and all power saving turned off .	St
1.7.7	If I run just a single monitor , it seems to stay up longer , but even then I have had it lock up .	St
1.7.8	I tried setting the Hardware acceleration to None and it ran for over 24 hours with no problem .	St
1.7.9	I 'm now notching it back up one tick at a time .	St
1.7.10	I am now several hours into the second tick up from None .	St
1.7.11	Has anyone else had these kinds of problems ?	Ques
1.7.12	By the way , I already replaced the BFG GeForce 7800 GT OC card once .	St
1.7.13	The second card exhibited the very same symptoms as the first .	St
1.7.14	Is this a problem with the Gateway , the video card , or an incompatibility between the two ?	Ques
1.7.15	Any ideas out there ?	Ques
1.7.16	System specs : Gateway GT5032 4GB Corsair ValueSelect RAM BFG GeForce 7800 GT OC Video Card Antec SmartPower 2.0 500W power supply Samsung SyncMaster 914v Gateway FPD2185W	St
1.8.1	I actually never replaced the original power supply in the GT5032 .	St
1.8.2	Have had no issues with it even under a load .	St
1.8.3	I have had no problems at all with the BFG 7800 GT OC card out of the box .	St
1.8.4	When I put in the card I did n't notice the manufacturer 's requirements for a 400 watt power supply , but have experienced no issues at all with the stock Gateway 300w PS .	St
1.8.5	I am using the integrated sound card and I do not use the TV tuner card at all .	St
1.8.6	Like I said I have had great luck with this system/card set-up .	St
1.9.1	I have an outside-the-box question for you ... Is it possible that one of your power dongles from the PS to your card are screwed up somehow ?	Ques
1.9.2	This could result in lower than expected current flow to your video card and all sorts of funky problems .	St
1.9.3	I know the Gateway did n't have sufficient power cables on the PS when I got mine so I had to pick up some splitters .	St
1.9.4	It may be possible that one of yours has some hidden damage .	St
1.9.5	If so , this could be a three dollar fix .	St
1.9.6	Just a thought .	St
1.9.7	-- -Paul	St
1.10.1	Paul , That is a good idea .	Polite
1.10.2	Although I have been having this problem even before I replaced the power supply .	St
1.10.3	I have just now used a second PCI-e power cable that came with the Antec power supply and plugged it into a different outlet on the power supply .	St
1.10.4	Another thing that I forgot to mention is that the Hardware acceleration is set independantly for each monitor .	St
1.10.5	The setting for the Samsung has been set on full since the beginning .	St
1.10.6	The setting for the Gateway is the one that I have been varying .	St
1.10.7	I found that either None or the very first notch seems to work ( at least up to 24 hours ) .	St
1.10.8	When I tried the second notch yesterday it failed after several hours .	St
1.10.9	Today I have switched the power cables as described and set the Hardware acceleration to full to see if it fails .	St
1.10.10	Thanks for your suggestion !	St
1.11.1	I have a GT5032..I see you put a new video card in ... How do you install a new video card in it ( PCI-e ) ..I bought an ATI X1600 PRO card..but am a little unsure about installing it..Do I disable anything first ? ..Jumpers..Uninstall drivers..Can you tell me how to install the new video card..into the GT5032 ? ..Thanks ! ..	St
1.12.1	I ended up returning the my Gateway and going for an HP .	St
1.12.2	However , in general , you should follow the instructions that came with the video card .	St
1.12.3	I believe they suggest that you install their drivers first , then instal the card .	St
1.12.4	The one thing you will have to do is upon startup go into the boot settings and change the video from the built in to PCI-e .	Sug
1.12.5	I do n't remember the exact settings , but you should be able to find it .	St
1.12.6	Hope this helped !	St
1.13.1	I 'm going to try a 7600GT in the stock GT5032 .	St
1.13.2	Will let you guys know how it goes .	St
1.14.1	im going to be buying one in the next few days , i have a 400w psu now , someone told me that they require 26 amps on the 12v rail , know anything about that ?	Ques
