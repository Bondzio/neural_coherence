Thanks for the suggestion I double checked the manual and it appears I should be able to run both SATA and IDE concurrently.
While browsing the manual I came across this, &quot;If the hard disk was already formatted on a previous system, the setup BIOS may detect incorrect parameters.
Select [Manual] to manually enter the IDE hard disk drive parameters.&quot; After looking up the parameters for the hard drive, I tried to manually enter the IDE hard disk drive parameters; however, I was not able to do so.
The Sectors, Heads, and Cylinders all had adjustable values but when I set them to the proper values and hit enter, they just reset to the incorrect values.
Any other suggestions?
Thanks
