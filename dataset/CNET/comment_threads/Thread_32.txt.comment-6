As you may find, many prefer to try to get that temp lower.
And with improved case cooling and maybe a better HSF you can get the idle down to 38 to 40 C. It just isn't necessary unless you are a gamer and the running temo gets into the 60 C's.
I only use caes with top exghaust fan and a side fan that blows in.
These in combination with a rear exhaust fan [in addition to that of the power supply].
Most cases come with more locations to locate fans, than fans that they provide.
If you add any fans, get dual ball bearing type, they last longer.
