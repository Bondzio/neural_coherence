<s> The internal CD-RW/DVD-ROM drive (CRX810E) in my older (4 years old) Sony Viao Notebook (PCG-GRX550) recently started acting up. </s>
<s> If I insert any kind of CD or DVD into the drive it thinks it is an audio CD. </s>
<s> If I try to play the CD (even audio CDs) or DVD the drive spins for a while and then fails to read anything. </s>
<s> I looked under the properties for the drive and everything seems to be okay. </s>
<s> I also ran diagnostics and it failed to find anything wrong with the drive. </s>
<s> Has anyone seen this kind of problems before? </s>
<s> Any comments/suggestions/solutions would be appreciated. </s>
<s> They run under 100 bucks if you change it yourself. </s>

<s> Bob, Thanks again for your help. </s>
<s> I thought I might have to buy a new drive. </s>
<s> Any ideas where I could buy a new drive that I could install myself. </s>
<s> Sony is asking for $350. </s>
<s> BTW, I exchanged my external (DRX-710UL)DVD burner (Another posting you had helped me with) for another one and it works like a charm. </s>
<s> That's 1/2 the price of some new laptops! </s>
<s> Nero Infotool noted at http://www.cdspeed2000.com/ and BELARC ADVISOR may dig out what drive that is so we can see if we can find a better deal. </s>

<s> Hey Dgogoi, I have the exact same problem with my Sony Viao (now 2 years old) that you did. </s>
<s> Did you end up getting a new DVD-rom, if so which one and did it work out all right? </s>
<s> I'm also curious if you had any trouble switching them out. </s>
<s> I took a look at mine, and it didn't look like the removal/installation was anywhere near as straight-forward as with most laptops. </s>
<s> Thanks, Steve </s>
<s> I have the same CD R/W / DVD combo drive and have had a hell of a time with it! </s>
<s> From incorrect copying of my files, to not alowing me to R/W my R/W disk, to not recognizing my R and R/W disk, not to mention the failure to play all regions formated DVDs. </s>
<s> I am seriously considering getting an external replacement drive and uninstalling this God Damned combo drive and throwing it in the garbage heap of all the other poorly designed drives and P.C. </s>
<s> devices. </s>
<s> Combo drives at this point in time are imperfect at best useless at worst. </s>
<s> The problem is Laptops and Notebooks rarely can handle more then one CD ROM/DVD ROM Drives, so unless you dare try to find a non-combo drive that will be compatiable with your Laptop and not require A+ Certification to install, an external drive(s) are your best bet. </s>
<s> Windows default drivers are often troblesome and very often not compatiable with your devices. </s>
<s> Sometimes your device(s) will work but not to their full potential because of imperfectly matched and/or outdated drivers (such as the CD part of your drive working but not the CD/R and CD/RW part). </s>
<s> Uninstall your combo drive and get an external DVD R/W drive (if money is an issue try E-Bay or if you prefer new, Comp USA is a good choice http://www.compusa.com . </s>
<s> Good luck and damn Sony and their expensive and buggy computers and devices . </s>
