On one hand the FX 57 blows the XP 4800 when it comes to gaming(single application) but on the other pretty soon games will start taking advantage of the Dual Core. For gamers like me the bottom line is, Frames Per Second, but if the games start taking advantage of dual core procesors I presume that then the single cores will run them a lot slower. The question is, at this time, what's better? Will the gaming industry start taking advantage of the dual core soon, or will it take another year or two? Is it better to buy the XP 4800 and wait for the games to come out, or get the FX 57 and possibly have to replace it in one year? Is the difference in performance large enough to choose the FX 57?

As FX-60 is coming out soon, Januaryish, as is the higher X2's. All, in all: The FX-57 will almost always win with the games, AT THE MOMENT. I assume multi-threaded games will be out, or at least a few before the of 2006. I've been browing around AMDZONE and they are saying that an overclocked X2 could easily be better than their single-core counterparts. Again, I'd wait in January for the new processors..... Look for some benchmarks then, and take your pick. You may need a few more dollars though, as they are saying the price may be over 1k.

AMD uses its power more efficiently and if you go with dual core, well thats just awesome! the only problem with double core is the price... i saw places running the FX-57 up to $2000, but its an investment, and i suggest you do some research on some processors... you never know what new chips will come into play.

Companies are going to take advantage of dual core processors. Also as said in a previous post, in lines of processors are coming out, which most liely means price break for you. So I suggest you wait. Although the 57 will get you more fps, the 4800 still has far more useful value.

I always look at the keyboard and not the screen, so I never spellcheck.

Since my main purpose is gaming and all arrows point out that the FX is a better choice for gaming, at least for the time being and for the next year. Now...anyone knows when the FX-60 is coming out?

What kind of PC, and budget, are you looking for? ~Ibrahim P.S. Best to start a new thread, though.
