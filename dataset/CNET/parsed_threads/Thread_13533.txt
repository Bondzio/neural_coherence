<s> I have heard somewhere that there is a size limit to HDD when used with a P2 or P3 computer and wondered if anyone knows because I am about to purchase a new HDD and don't want to get the wrong thing. </s>
<s> Maybe it was a limit on HDD size with the OS system used, I have no idea. </s>
<s> I have a P2 350mhz 256 ram and a 4ghz HDD and I also have a P3 400mhz 128ram and a 8gb HDD using Windows ME and XP. </s>
<s> These are my backup computers and still very functional and I would like to spruce them up a little so any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> http://www.48bitlba.com notes the common limitations. </s>
<s> You may be running a DOS based Windows so that is a limit to 127GB if the BIOS supports such. </s>
<s> Many will not update a BIOS, but I always do this in my upgrades but your choice. </s>

<s> Earlier versions of Windows don't support hard drives greater than 137 GB, but Windows 2000 (Service Pack 4) and Windows XP (Service Pack 1) do. </s>
<s> Please note that for both OSes, the service packs are necessary. </s>
<s> If you have SP2 (XP), you're in great shape, but if you don't have even SP1, you need to upgrade. </s>
<s> Windows 2000 needs SP4 to support more than 137. </s>
<s> Actually, you could get a 200GB HDD and use it with any version of Windows, you'd just be limited to 137GB, and the rest of the HDD would just sit there, not being used. </s>
