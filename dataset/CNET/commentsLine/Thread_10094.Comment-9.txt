even though what i use now has a long history of things that didn't work out (the old roku hd, some htpc, too many &quot;media players&quot;) i am looking to change this working system some day.
i'm considering the sony google tv since it has a bd player.
just want to test it.
why?
1. the bd player.
2. it's 1080p versus the revue's 720p.
the revue is working well but i wonder if it can be better.
the boxee seems to get good reviews but i haven't tried it yet.
and strange i haven't seen one in the stores here.
