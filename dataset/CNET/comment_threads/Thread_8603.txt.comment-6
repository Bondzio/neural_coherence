So far, Windows 8 will only be on tablets that ship with it installed.
As a software and hardware developer I don't want to slam whoever wrote that but only the current Windows 7 tablets stand a chance of running Windows 8.
As to the lens, I find that for everyday use I head to amazon.com and look at the best selling lists for the items in question.
As to deeper camera questions, I'd ask in the CNET Digital Camera forum.
