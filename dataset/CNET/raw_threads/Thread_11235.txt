I'm curious if it is possible to connect a Wii to my MacBook Pro and use the MacBook as a screen to play my games on. If anyone knows anything about this, please let me know if it's possible, and how or what I need to buy in order to accomplish this.

What &quot;might&quot; be possible is that you purchased a USB TV tuner for the laptop, plug the Wii to it and tune to whatever the Wii puts out. If the Wii only puts out a finished video signal and not a TV signal, this will not work. You may want to consider a cheap TV. I'm sure there are Wii owners out there that will offer other suggestions though. P

Sound and graphics were sub-par I think, but it worked. Of course, a DVD Player vs. a MBP screen is a large difference. If you had a converter cable to combine the audio channel cables (red and yellow cables I believe, assuming the Wii uses those standard connection cables), you could physically connect the Wii to the Mac, but you wouldn't get anything from the Wii on the screen, supposing the Wii works as any other console... Anyway, I agree, with a TV, it would be better. -BMF

I have an EyeTV 250 and this has a console setting that is supposed to reduce latency in game play. As someone said earlier, you hook your Wii up to this and tune it to the TV channel it's using Caveat - I have not tried this and the reviews are mixed. Check out Elgato's site or the reviews on the Apple Store Oh - and if you are off to college and they have an aerial point(or a good signal) you can use the Eye to watch/record broadcast analog or digital TV!
