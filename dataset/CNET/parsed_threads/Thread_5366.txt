<s> Ok, so it is not starting up, i think my problem lies in the front panel connectors, i think i am connecting them wrong. </s>
<s> The name of the connector that turns on the computer is called 'M/B SW' which is something i havent seen before, no matter where i plug it, it wont work. </s>
<s> It will not give a sign of life. </s>
<s> If you really need to know my specs here they are: Intel Core 2 Duo 2.8ghz 2gigs ram 1 stick 500GB green power hard drive. </s>
<s> 9800GT 1gb. </s>
<s> 300w PSU. </s>
<s> I am pretty sure i connected everything right. </s>
<s> This is very frustrating as it is my first build and i thought it was going to be simpler than that, anyways this is why i am posting here. </s>
<s> Any help is appreciated. </s>
<s> But what do the manual say? </s>
<s> When it works, it is simple but when it's not (and there are no indication/s of the problem) then that's a pain. </s>
<s> Any kind of indication at all when that power switch is pressed? </s>
<s> Is there a led on the motherboard that says 5v is on? </s>
<s> i just press the button and here the echo of the click, i really do not know what the problem is.. </s>
<s> take a metal object like the tip of a screwdriver and try shorting the two pins where you insert the power switch wires from the front panel.leave all the other pins disconnected. </s>
<s> if it starts,its a problem with your front panel headers.if it still doesnt start,atleast you know there's nothing wrong with your front panel connections.then we can look at what else could be the problem </s>
<s> &quot;9800GT 1gb. </s>
<s> 300w PSU.&quot; Let's Google the common 9800GT card and what it wants for Watts. </s>
<s> &quot;Minimum Recommended System Power (W) 400 W &quot; http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_geforce_9800gt_us.html Your PSU is 75% of the recommended value. </s>
<s> Missing this by such a wide margin is one likely cause. </s>
<s> Who designed this machine? </s>
<s> I just realized now that you tell me that my 9800Gt requires an extra 6pin connector to be connected to it, directly from the PSU, and i couldn't find it, now i understand.... 300W is way too LOW. </s>
<s> Thanks for telling me. </s>
<s> Is there any chance i might have damaged any components by doing this? </s>
<s> The chances are slim that anything bad happened. </s>
<s> If you had smoke coming from chips and the old Star Trek hit by Klingon fire effects then you wouldn't be asking. </s>
<s> it probably means im going to have to change my case since i do not think it will accomodate a 500-700W PSU. </s>
<s> this is such a waste of money and time. </s>
<s> Luckily you guys are here. </s>
<s> money and time if we don't learn by our mistakes. </s>
<s> Computer cases aren't as expensive as some may think; while you don't want to go the 'el cheapo' route, you don't have to spend $900+ for the ThermalTake Level 10. </s>
<s> You can usually get a decent (starter) case for under $100 http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=2010090007%204026&bop=And&Order=RATING&PageSize=20 and power supplies don't have to put you in the poorhouse either http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=2010090058%204026%201131509966%201409730089&name=80%20PLUS%20Certified&ShowDeactivatedMark=False </s>
<s> thank you for the advice, im going to go buy these this weekend, i will message you when i get them and tell you if it works. </s>
<s> Should i go directly for 600W? </s>
<s> larger PSUs. </s>
<s> Check the measurements of the one you have and check the measurements of the ones you're considering. </s>
<s> Post back if you have a question...we'll be here. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> and it was alsmost 2cm larger in height and width, length doesnt matter. </s>
<s> So i think im going to have to change my case, any suggestions? </s>
<s> Should i get a full sized tower so i can be tranquil? </s>
<s> How much money do you want or can afford to spend on a new case? </s>
<s> See my previous post for (budget-minded) cases from newegg </s>
<s> 150 dollars MAX </s>
<s> There are a number of good cases at newegg for $150 and under; some with the PSU opening at the top (most on the bottom), quite a few with side windows-if that's your thing. </s>

<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> is the antec 900 a full tower? </s>
<s> I'm going for full tower now because i do not want to deal with space problems anymore. </s>
<s> PSU: 500 - 600W that fits in a relatively small case. </s>
