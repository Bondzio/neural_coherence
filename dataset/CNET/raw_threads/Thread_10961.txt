The voltages out of the supply to the devices is precisely regulated for voltage [5, 12, 3.3] thus the devices have no idea how much power the supply could provide. Based on a standard supply, not a proprietary system such as the old Dells which used different wiring in the same connector.

But, installing a higher wattage unit is OK provided the connections are the same type, etc.. Here is ahelpful site that may explain further: http://www.sparklepower.com good luck -----Willy
