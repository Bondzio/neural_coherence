I read these FORUMs regularly and don't see an extraordinary number of complaints or failures on HP machines....regardless of platform.
Most of what I read here is people writing about upgrading the video card or RAM in their HPs.
So what is your basis for saying ...'Their hardware reliability is absolutely horrible.'
?
How many HPs have you had ?
Aren't a fair number of the HP motherboards made by ASUS ?
