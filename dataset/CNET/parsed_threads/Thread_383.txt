<s> I'm trying to decide between getting a 23/24in. </s>
<s> widescreen (probably the dell 2405FPW) or dual 19in lcd's. </s>
<s> I know the picture quality should be better on the widescreen, but I can get the 19in monitors for less (although I'd want a new graphics card that had 2 digital outputs). </s>
<s> Any thoughts, feelings, advice or suggestions would be welcome. </s>
<s> I forgot to say what I'd be using them for. </s>
<s> I am currently doing back-end web programming (using primarily the macromedia studio mx2004 suite). </s>
<s> I also do some design and photo editing with Photoshop (pretty much at a hobby level right now). </s>
<s> Anyway, any advice would be helpful. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Dual monitors are amazing. </s>
<s> I read somewhere that productivity is increased by something like 74%. </s>
<s> I am using dual 1600SW wide screens for school and I love it more than having a huge monitor. </s>
<s> It's much easier to manipulate. </s>
<s> For web design, its easy to have your program on one window while you have a preview of the page on the other monitor. </s>
<s> I have used up to a 30 inch and its not the same, its much easier to have two full screen windows open on seperate monitors than manipulating two side by side windows on one monitor. </s>
<s> Not to mention, it just looks cool when you get two idential monitors side by side. </s>
<s> I highly recomend dual monitors over one large display. </s>
<s> You might find yourself such a big fan that you start thinking about three, or four monitors. </s>
<s> The only gripe I can think about with dual monitors is that you cannot use SLi technology (scalable link interface) I had to seperate my video cards to use dual monitors, which slightly decreases my video quality from 1024 video ram to 512mb. </s>
<s> Not sure if that is something prised in web design but in hd video and animation it can be an issue. </s>
<s> I'd also recommend using two seperate video cards than running both off a single video card. </s>
<s> Set up for dual monitors is also incredibly easy. </s>
<s> Right click desktop, go to settings, and select &quot;extend my desktop&quot; </s>
<s> If you can find a video card that supports pivoting, I'd go with the dual. </s>
<s> I use a 15.4&quot; laptop + 17&quot; Dell ultrashap and it's nice to rotate the 17&quot; to portrait mode--since most code is taller than it is wide. </s>
<s> I'm &quot;borrowing&quot; a 20&quot; Dell ultrashap, and running that in portrait mode is so cool. </s>
