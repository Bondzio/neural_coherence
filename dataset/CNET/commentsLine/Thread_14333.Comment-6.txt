i like to add to what robert suggested... if the problem crops up under 3-different os installs, i would look at more memory(check ram) or yet another cd drive.
i *assume* the os cds are legit and not copies which can introduce problems also.
-or- you maybe better off doing a fresh install if you're upgrading or reloading or trying a dual-mode install with win9x, etc.. maybe, also the h/w just is too old as xp or even w2k become picky on that issue.
you just can't take anything for granted.
