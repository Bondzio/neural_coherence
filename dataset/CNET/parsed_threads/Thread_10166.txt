<s> Hi there I took out the HDD(Toshiba MK1516GAP 15GB ATA-2/3/4 2.5&quot; 9.5mm Hard Drive) from an old vaio notebook and put it into a 2.5 external casing (usb) to use as portable storage. </s>
<s> When all is connected windows recognizes the drive i.e as a toshiba and its size. </s>
<s> Now the problem arises when i try to read from or write to the drive. </s>
<s> For the first few minutes(5min) after i plug in the usb cable i seem to be able to read and write to the drive. </s>
<s> Then after i keep getting the following message: Windows -Delayed Write Failed ------------------------------ Windows was unable to save all the data for the file (path of file). </s>
<s> The data has been lost. </s>
<s> This error may be caused by a failure of your computer hardware or network connection. </s>
<s> Please try to save this file elsewhere. </s>
<s> When i then try to access the drive i get this: I:\ is not accessible The request could not be performed because of an I/O device error Any help given would be very much appreciated </s>
<s> Did you find a resolution to this problem. </s>
<s> cheers Mark mcs@modnet.com.au </s>
<s> I had a similar situation with an external HDD. </s>
<s> My mobo has a USB 1x, I used a USB 2x plugin card. </s>
<s> It worked fine for a few days before this problem cropped up. </s>
<s> It happened on both XP and 98! </s>
<s> Finally, I got rid of the plugin card and started to use the mobo USB. </s>
<s> No prob, no speed. </s>
<s> I think it could have been a hardware failure. </s>
<s> Not sure. </s>
<s> Waiting for more info ...... </s>
<s> I have a seagate 120 GB external hard disk in a sarotech hardbox external casing. </s>
<s> I was able to access the data in my external HD yesterday and today i keep getting the Delay Write Fail error as well. </s>
<s> Any idea how to resolve this problem? </s>
<s> Open a command prompt to run CHKDSK. </s>
<s> For me the command is... CHKDSK T: /F /X If the drive needs to be checked later, answer yes. </s>
<s> -&gt; This will also occur if the drive is full to the brim. </s>
<s> Remove a GB and see if that and CHKDSK helps. </s>
<s> If not, find the drive fitness test and don't trust this drive. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> turns out, the problem lies on the usb wire. </s>
<s> Changed it and it works again. </s>
<s> Thanks for your suggestion though. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> SOLVED (for me, anyway): I also was having the &quot;Delayed Write Failed&quot; issue on XP Pro SP2 with my new Buffalo DriveStation Duo 1TB system. </s>
<s> I tried it in both Fat32 and NTFS modes as well as in RAID1 and as two independent drives, but would continue to randomly get this error message - mostly on writing large (&gt;500MB) files but occasionally on reads as well. </s>
<s> Finally - due to the suggestion in this thread about the USB wire - I switched the connection of this unit from a USB wire to a 1394 wire (fortunately my laptop had this port) and the errors finally cleared up. </s>
<s> I'm having the same error message on my external hard drive as well, but I only have a USB2 port coming from the external case. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Try the above fixes. </s>
