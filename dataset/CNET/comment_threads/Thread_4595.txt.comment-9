The friend of mine actually gave me his old 4350, but he has said I can have the 6670 once he upgrades in about a month.
Conveniently, in a month I can afford a new PSU.
I'm from the UK, so i'm dealing in pounds sterling rather than dollars, do you reckon this would suffice?

Thanks a lot for all the help guys, just wondering if anyone knows why my GT220 fan might not be working?
Its got a seperate fan wire, and I've tried plugging it into something directly on the motherboard, but it doesn't seem to work
