and there's no reason to get an upgraded cpu cooler if you're on a tight budget.
e7500 with stock fan is $120 saving $30.
use the money you saved to get a $75-$85 video card gigabyte gv-r467d3-512i radeon hd 4670 msi r4830-t2d512 oc radeon hd 4830 msi n9600gt-md512 geforce 9600 gt i also suggest gigabyte ga-ep43-ud3l instead of the asrock for the same price.
ddr2 and ddr3 can't be used at the same time so you'd have to throw away your ram to upgrade beyond 2gb.
and the gigabyte ia a proven reliable board.
since you're only getting 2gb, get 1 2gb stick to make future upgrades easier.
the coolmax power supply is mediocre.
if you use your pc a lot for gaming, i doubt it will last more than 18 months.
these $40 power supplies are a bit more but should last 3 years or more.
