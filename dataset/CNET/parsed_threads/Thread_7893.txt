<s> Okay, I know my Alienware Area 51 system is old. </s>
<s> But no machine I've ever owned had this kind of staying power. </s>
<s> Bought in 2001, still running games like Madden 05 without a problem. </s>
<s> Threw in a DVD burner and 250 Gig hard drive. </s>
<s> Since it's still doing what I need it to, I will wait for Vista's full launch to buy my next Alienware. </s>
<s> But I wouldn't mind throwing several hundred into bumping my current machine up in the meantime. </s>
<s> Not an expert though at what will help the most, and what is wasted money because my system can't handle it. </s>
<s> My thoughts would be upgrade the CPU (if my motherboard can handle it) and bump my RAM from 512... maybe replace one of the 4 128s with a gig chip. </s>
<s> Here's my machine, straight from the Alienware's Hive support section. </s>
<s> the 1st number is Quantity (ie: 4 128Megs of memory = 512Megs of total memory). </s>
<s> Would love some advice from the experts. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> i wouldn't advise upgrading your pc. </s>
<s> rdram is obsolete and expensive compared to ddr/ddr2. </s>
<s> likewise, your cpu and motherboard chipset are dead-ends. </s>
<s> vista will be by february and if you buy a dell pc after october you'll get a free/cheap upgrade to vista when it releases. </s>
<s> even if you have to buy vista at full price, it will be cheaper than the cash you'd throw away on upgrading your current pc. </s>
<s> so just a wait a month or so and get a new system. </s>
