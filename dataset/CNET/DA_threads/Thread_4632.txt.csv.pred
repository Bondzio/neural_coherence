1.1.1	Okay here is my story , I brought a 80 Gb hard drive mid January as a second drive to my 20 Gb drive because I was running low on space .	St
1.1.2	My mother board and CPU at that time were 4.5 years old ( PIII 800 MHz ) .	St
1.1.3	When I installed the second hard drive the bios only detected 32 Gb .	St
1.1.4	I could n't find any update for my bios and I did n't want to accidently reck my system so I just partitioned and formated the drive for the 32 Gb because I figured it was 32Gb more than I had before .	St
1.1.5	So this brings up to last week .	St
1.1.6	Last Thurday my motherboard and CPU crashed .	St
1.1.7	Do n't know why , but the end result is I got a brand new motherboard and am now running a P4 3GHz system .	St
1.1.8	I have my old drives in the new system and it is now saying I only have just over 2 Gb left on both hard drives .	St
1.1.9	I am wondering if my 80 Gb drive can be repartitioned so I will be able to get my 50 Gb back that I lost .	St
1.1.10	I know this motherboard should n't have a problem like my last one in reading drives over 32 Gb .	St
1.1.11	So my question is can this be done ?	Ques
1.1.12	And will I lose the 30 Gb of files that are on the drive now ?	Ques
1.1.13	I am running Windows 98 SE if that helps .	St
1.2.1	We only lose what we did n't backup .	St
1.2.2	With DVD recorders being in the sub 90 buck region , and a 10 pack of media som 20 bucks , for 99 bucks you could backup 47 gigabytes of files .	St
1.2.3	If the files are not worth 99 bucks , then you 've revealed how much such is worth to you .	St
1.2.4	Moving a drive is often OK , but the number of posts where people lose it all is telling .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	As Bob says , back up everything first .	St
1.3.2	It was not mentioned that a jumper on the drive could be a limiting factor .	St
1.3.3	Check the jumper/jumpers on the rear of the drive mostly used to configure master or slave .	St
1.3.4	You might find one which limits the size to 32 gigs .	St
1.3.5	This allows larger drives to be used in older systems that can not handle them otherwise .	St
1.4.1	There is a program called Partion Magic that will do this .	St
1.4.2	BUT you still need to back up your data .	St
1.4.3	John	St
1.5.1	I may be wrong , but given the age of his previous computer , it is quite likely that his previous comp .	St
1.5.2	simply created 1 32Gb ( max allowed on FAT32 ( Windows98 ) ) and ignored the other blank space .	St
1.5.3	You should be able to regain it by repartitioning , but , like the others said , always backup before a partition .	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
