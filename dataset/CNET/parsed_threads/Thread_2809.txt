<s> Before receiving Help and Support from Microsoft, I am promped to enter my Product ID #. </s>
<s> I have a valid OEM copy of Vista Home Premium but Microsoft says that my Product ID # is not valid. </s>
<s> My copy of Vista was installed by Hewlett Packard on one of their new machines. </s>
<s> My computer lists the OS Product ID # and says that this copy of Vista is activated. </s>
<s> I have registered my computer through HP but no one there, that I have spoken to regarding this, seems to have even a clue of what I am talking about. </s>
<s> As a for instance, I ask; &quot;How do I get Microsoft to recognize that my copy of Vista Home Premium is Valid?&quot; They answer; &quot;It is.&quot; When I try to explain and ask for an answer, I am put on hold, and/or transferred, and/or disconnected. </s>
<s> So, I thought that I'd ask you folks. </s>
<s> Can anyone help? </s>
<s> OEMs are not supported by Microsoft. </s>
<s> The only support is from the computer company, in your case, HP. </s>
<s> If you had purchased and installed a full retail version operating system it would include some support from Microsoft. </s>
<s> Microsoft will disavow any knowledge or help on this one. </s>
<s> It's beginning to seem to me that it is all set up this way to kind of monopolize the Help and Support area of their business. </s>
<s> However, if this is anywhere near true then why in the world would they have established links to the Microsoft Help and Supprt page - that do not work? </s>
<s> Could it be that they cannot remove them because they are an intrinsic part of the Vista OS? </s>
<s> And if this is indeed true, then why aren't a Lot of folks talking/complaining about it? </s>
<s> Out of the box these things do work or you put it back in the box as defective. </s>
<s> I do not think it's any conspiracy but the rampant virus, malware and other stuff can damage the machine if you don't firewall it from day zero. </s>
<s> Most vendors now understand this. </s>
<s> Sorry to see you struggle but as the story is told so far it's a back in the box and ask for another. </s>
