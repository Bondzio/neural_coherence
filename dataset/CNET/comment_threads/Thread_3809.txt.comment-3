well from what you have said, this is a cheapo PSU and should not be trusted and my other hardware depends on this thing working what would you recommend for under $100?
CPU-Intel C2D E8400 GPU-XFX 9800GTX+ PSU-HEC X-power pro 650W HDD-Western Digital 500gb RAM-Kingston 2gb MB-XFX 780i Case-Thermaltake m5 it will need to run all these things, a rough estimate at the power needed is fine, I just need a decent brand to look for and Ill do all the adding myself note: I would like to run SLI in the future
