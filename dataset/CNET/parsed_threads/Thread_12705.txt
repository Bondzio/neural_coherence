<s> Hello, I currently have a 250gb WD My Book Premium External HD. </s>
<s> When I bought it, it came formatted as Fat32. </s>
<s> I reformatted it to NTFS. </s>
<s> I want to be able to hook this up to a Mac so that I can copy the Mac's music collection onto the drive and then, take the music from the external drive, and put it on my PC. </s>
<s> When I tried this, the Mac would not allow me to copy and paste files onto the drive, but recognized it as Read Only. </s>
<s> What do I need to do to be able to get the files from a Mac, onto the External, and then onto a PC. </s>
<s> Will reformatting to Fat32 do it (if so, how do I do this), or is there an easier way? </s>
<s> Please help! </s>
