i have previously burned a dvd-rw (verbatin) with all of my downloaded software installation programs.
the dvd was previously udf formatted using incd version 4.3.23.2. i have previously used the dvd-rw to write to and retrieve files.
this time, i loaded the dvd in my drive to extract one of the files and the computer rebooted every time that i tried.
ultimately, i got an error message telling me that there was a critical error on the disk and the disk would be marked as read only to protect the data.
however, there appears to be nothing on the dvd now.
when i insert it in the dvd drive, it seems to be labeled &quot;incd auto-formattable&quot; i've tried to read the dvd on 2 computers with the same results.
does anyone know how i can retrieve the lost data?
