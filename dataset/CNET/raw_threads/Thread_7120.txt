Here's the specs: Asus AM2 Mobo nforce 570SLI chipset eVGA GeForce 7900GT (non-OC'd) Kingwin 600W PSU AMD Athlon 64 X2 4200+ (might overclock eventually) WD Caviar 250GB Hard drive Here's my debate: I'm going to buy DDR2 667 or better RAM. Right now, I'm looking at Corsair RAM, 2GB, Latency 4, 4-4-4-12 timings. However, for a little bit more, I could get mushkin Extreme, 2GB, Latency 3, 3-3-3-10 RAM. I know quite a bit about computers, but RAM would have to be my most lacking area. I know the mushkin ram has better timings and latency, but I've also heard a few bad things about mushkin, albeit not much. I need opinions: who's better? Muskin or Corsair? I know a few of my fellow tech heads will help me out on this one. Thanks!

Proffitt	6/20/06 7:50 AM	1.1507898E12	Less is better.	http://www.tomshardware.com/2003/04/01/ram_wars/ covers a lot of ground and benchmarks so you can test which one wins. However I've found such testing to turn up less than 1% speed payback so I've ceased overtesting this area in favor of price per GB and stability. Bob
