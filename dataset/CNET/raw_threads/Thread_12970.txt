C:\ drive (Primary) has: cmldr, boot.ini, NTDETECT.COM, AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS, ntldr, INSTALL.LOG. When I installed XP, I didn't know about the importance of putting XP on the primary partition. Now I know. I'd like to correct this w/o reinstalling XP/SP2 and all the programs I have running (audio/video). Strategy 1: Wipe the 160GB HDD (data is backed up) and create a 60 GB Primary partition plus a 100 GB data partition. Migrate (clone) XP/SP2 from currect G:\ drive to the new partition on the other drive. Add boot files (listed above)from C:\ HDD. Strategy 2: Wipe the 120GB drive (data is backed up). Create primary 60GB partition for XP/SP2 fresh install. Add data on second 60GB partition I would then create. Strategy 3: Clone XP/SP2 from G:\ partition and Boot files form C:\ and back this up to external HDD. Boot into PC. Wipe the 120GB drive. Create 60GB primary partition. Install close here (XP/SP2). Create second 60GB partition and add backed up data. Note: people tell me XP/SP2 needs partitions: 60GB. What say you? I have MaxBlast 5 utility.(Maxtor HDD): Acronis clone / partition software. PC = 1GHZ PIII / 512 Rambus ram / XPPro/SP2 Internal ATA 133 7200 rpm EIDE Maxtor drives are on an ATA 133 PCI Card UDMA6 133MHZ bus 120GB HDD - OS / Data Drive 320GB HDD - Data Drive 160GB HDD - Data Drive 320GB HDD - Data Drive Upgrading Bios to have 1 GB ram.
