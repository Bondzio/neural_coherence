You don't say what Model your LT is, but I assume it has a network plug-in, you may also need to make a change in the bios to initialize the network connection, but if there is no option in the bios you may have to set up a new network connection in Windows.
Also are you testing the connection from the linksys with the same cable as with your PC?
If you are using a separate cable you can check if that is okay, by substituting it with the cable you use for the PC.
