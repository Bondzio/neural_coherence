i have a brand new nexstar 3 case that supports up to 750gb drives.
it's an ide drive, not pata or sata.
i know the case supports partitions over 32gb because i put my brother's 100gb western digital drive in my case and it works fine.
for the person suggesting using smaller partitions like 295gb...that won't work because like i said before...windows will not let me increase the partition size beyond 32gig.
i can create one 32gig partition and that is it...no more.
it's like it doesn't know it's a 400gb drive...it only sees 32gig...should i say it again...32gig...that's it...doesn't see any more...no matter what jumper setting is used.
even unformatted it only sees 32gig.
i downloaded killdisk and reset the drive back to zeros and when i initialized the drive in my computer is shows up as 32gig.
so...if anyone has any new suggestions let me know but if you are going to tell me to format different partition sizes or use ntfs vs fat32 or tell me to get a new case because my case doesn't support large drives or tell me that xp only supports 320gig external or whatever...don't bother becasue i've tried it all.
i'd be more than happy to see 320gig come up but it just doesn't work...32gig and that's it.
let's face it...seagate drives suck and i'll never buy one again.
