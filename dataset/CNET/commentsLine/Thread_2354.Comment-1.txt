hi everyone, i have two questions but i will post them seperately as they'll both have different answers!
a friend called me up as she purchased a mac laptop in the states (we are in the uk), she wanted to know about the best isp for her, so i've left her to think about her online usage for me to find a good deal but she also asked about having the laptop wireless, so she can be in her bedroom, living room etc and still get online - without having wires trailing around the house.
as i've never owned a mac before and also not having anything wireless in my own house i'm a bit stumped!
does anyone have any suggestions or even some websites for me to read up on?
i am also looking on this website for some clues and that's how i found this forum!
any help would be much appreciated thanks in advance lee
