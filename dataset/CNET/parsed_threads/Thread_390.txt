<s> Just had a new computer built (not by me) with an Asus A8N-E motherboard which has up to 10 USB2 ports. </s>
<s> However my machine reports through Device Manager that the USB mass storage device will function at reduced speed and I need to add a high speed USB host controller. </s>
<s> Si Soft Sandra reports the speeds as varying from 1.5 to 12 Mbps. </s>
<s> XP SP2 Professional What is going on please and how do I sort it out? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Ask them for the motherboard driver package. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I have the CD supplied with the motherboard - and don't know if the guy who built it used it or downloaded drivers! </s>
<s> Is it likely that this will be the driver package you refer to and in which case do I simply load it and see what happens. </s>
<s> Any likelihood of screwing things up as I am not competent in this area? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Yes I am! </s>
<s> You paid for this work so decide to install the drivers or call the suppliers (of board or who installed the OS) to get your money's worth. </s>
<s> I install such drivers daily it seems since Microsoft doesn't do it for us. </s>
<s> There is no worry for me about messing up since we can always start over. </s>

<s> Loaded drivers - seems OK now. </s>
<s> Think some of my devices are USB1 so these are still reported as such. </s>
<s> Thanks all </s>
