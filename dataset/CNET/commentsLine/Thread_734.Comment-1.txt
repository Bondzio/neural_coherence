i use a desktop for audio engineering.
the system is about 3 years old.
i'm hoping the few details that follow will be enough to get a discussion started.
thank you.
i was playing a multi-track audio project file (like i have done all day every day for years on this system) when all of a sudden the computer shut down - sorta.
the light on the mobo stays on, the hds are still humming, the fan is still turning, but none of the usb components are receiving power (no lights go on) and i can not reboot the comp using the reboot button (everything just remains 'on').
the dual monitors show nothing, not even a boot screen when i do a full power cycle, as if there is no booting happening at all.
what do i try next to help dissect (and ultimately fix) this problem?
thank you!
