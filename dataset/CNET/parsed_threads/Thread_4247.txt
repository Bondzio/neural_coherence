<s> Hi my CD rom drive has stopped working, when I insert any Cd the yellow light just blinks for a bit, and then stops. </s>
<s> I think I will have to replace the drive. </s>
<s> But first I just wanted to see if this in a common problem, that could be a bug in software. </s>
<s> What you've written is not an indication it has failed. </s>
<s> You didn't note what machine (PC/Mac/Other?) </s>
<s> this was in, the OS and more. </s>
<s> I could guess and guess badly that the CD doesn't automatically play and for some that could be a problem. </s>
<s> Read my reply at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6142-0.html?forumID=5&threadID=16389&messageID=181646 for a simple test. </s>
