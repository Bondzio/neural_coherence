I recently overclocked an AMD X4 965 way to much and fried it.
So, I bought another one and it is sitting here next to me.
What I need to know is, When I put the new CPU in, will the previous CPU's overclocked settings be active?
I would think not, because I'd just end up frying another CPU.
I just want to be 100% sure before I lose another $180.
