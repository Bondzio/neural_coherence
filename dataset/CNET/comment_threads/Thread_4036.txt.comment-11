My dad had an old backup of the last printer drivers and so I re-installed them (2 times already) - but it didn't help.
I'm going to download those same ones myself - maybe his copy is corrupt or something.
May as well try that, since I'm running out of ideas.
And I'm going to contact Compaq.
Maybe they know what's going on, since they made the thing.
Thanks for the driver suggestion/reminder.
