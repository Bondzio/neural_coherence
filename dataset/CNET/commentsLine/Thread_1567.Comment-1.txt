- 2293 mhz celeron - 512 pc2100 ram - windows mce 2005 (no remote) - nvidia 5200 pci - no tv tuners or decent sound card now, first things first for my media centre pc, it'll be used for watching movies and recording off tv and also divxing them for compression, it'll be hooked up to a tv set mostly.
now i need some mayjor upgrades!
new case/psu: antec black minuet ii micro atx case 220w 24pin  new mobo: not sure, maybe that ati one with the xprss chipsets?

gfx: if not onboard, x300 maybe x600, x700 - not a gaming machine!!
hdd: probberly a sata 300 gb or a samsung cpu/ram i'll stick with what i aready have, then upgrade to a 3.0ghz p4 and 1 gb of ram ** also i'll need a mce remote.
