1.8.1	& quot ; Disadvantages : * Youre currently not able to take full advantage of the technology because the software vendors havent made the switch from 32-bit to 64-bit processors. & quot ; Given I have such 64-bit machines running on XP 's 32-bit system and I can use VIRTUAL DUB and it kicks into a 64-BIT mode PLUS XP 's SP2 uses some 64-bit extenstions , that statement needs a rewrite .	St
1.8.2	Also , I have Suse 9.3 in it 's full 64-bit glory .	St
1.8.3	Again , I wonder what your definition of full advantage is .	St
1.8.4	Your passage is much like what was written when we were transitioning from the 80286 to the 386 .	St
1.8.5	In fact it is !	St
1.8.6	Bob	St
1.9.1	Thanks for the Info Bob .	St
1.9.2	I have an XP64 Pro beta on 1 PC now ( waiting for my copy of RC1 from MS ) regular XP SP2 on the other , got Suse 9.3 but have n't had the time to insall it yet , glad to hear that it runs great .	St
1.9.3	One of the reasons I have reg XP SP2 on one of the AMD 64 is it gives me a way to compare same OS on different processors , This will end as soon as I gat a chance to install the Suse or the XPRC1 .	St
