i am another retiree and am still having multiple problems upgrading to a (relatively) new windows xp system, so much so that i recently bought a secondhand 2000 pro machine.
this op sys seems far more user friendly - why did they ever abandon it?
- and it has brought a lot of my old software friends back into reliable use again.
i am now wondering whether to abandon or downgrade (upgrade to windows 2000 pro?)
my compaq windows xp machine.
currently i have not dared trying to use my hp 35mm slide scanner with anything but my very old windows 98se machine, with which it works like a charm.
it would probably work just as well with windows 2000 pro, but i would be very grateful if one of your other readers can tell me if this is so before i even start trying to install the scsi interface board.
