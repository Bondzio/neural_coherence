okay, so i installed everything correctly, but i left something out: the power going from the power source to the video card.
(( i turned the computer on, and when &lt;&lt;giving it power&gt;&gt; i got a screeching sound which sounded like it was coming from around my power source or processor.)
this is where i figured you meant the vid card.
do you have an old pc to try it in?
i remember from last posts, you have nowhere to have it checked by liscensed tech so, all you can do is my above mentioned, a different pc perhaps.
does the motherboard have onboard monitor port?
i still feel you have bigger issues with the motherboard and in my opinion, it's not in good health.
