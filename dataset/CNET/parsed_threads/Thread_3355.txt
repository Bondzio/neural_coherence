<s> It didn't come with any standoffs. </s>
<s> My old PC case standoffs raise the motherboard too high to fit correctly. </s>
<s> The new case has the screw holes raised away from the case. </s>
<s> Does this mean I do not need standoffs? </s>
<s> If you need to see a pic to be sure let me know. </s>

<s> Yes I would think that is true. </s>
<s> But just double check to be sure none of them touch the board where they shouldn't. </s>
<s> If so happen that it does touch then I probably use electrical tape or plastic washer to insulated it. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> The case appears to offer metal standoffs as part of its make-up. </s>
<s> These are screw down, hold it place areas/posts. </s>
<s> But, if this doesn't match what is required for the mtrbd. </s>
<s> as in the mounting areas are off, though these standoffs are there only to prevent moving of the mtrbd. </s>
<s> and proper grounding. </s>
<s> If other stand-offs are required then the h/w is either missing or wasn't include. </s>
<s> There is nothing to keep you from returning the case as its incomplete. </s>
<s> usually some plastic stand=offs are needed to keep the mtrbd. </s>
<s> flexing to touch the metal casing. </s>
<s> Though, when short of some items like this or seemingly lacking a good fit or match, I use foam to help separate metal and mtrbd.. You have to use your judgment of this as the picture while helpful isn't showing just how the mtrbd. </s>
<s> would fit. </s>
<s> A local source of a computer should have h/w kits or spare posts to buy. </s>
<s> also, online vendors offer such items, google for them if you want to keep the case and standoffs are needed for best install. </s>
