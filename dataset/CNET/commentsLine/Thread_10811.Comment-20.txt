that means something is wrong with the data on the disk.
i don't think that connecting it to the mb it came from will magically recover it, but - of course - it's worth a try.
if it works, get all your data off, delete the partitions on it and make new ones.
if it doesn't work, try the same.
if partitioning or formatting programs you try then give the same crc error, you can try to zero the disk and start all over.
