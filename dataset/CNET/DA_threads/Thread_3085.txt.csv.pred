1.1.1	I have recently had 2 Maxtor HDDs shown to be & quot ; Failing & quot ; when tested with PowerMax .	St
1.1.2	One had already completely crashed ( failed - see below ) , and the other is still going , but on its last legs ... ( Its data is now backed up , of course ) .	St
1.1.3	One was 5 months old , 250 giga , and the other was 18 months old , 160 giga .	St
1.1.4	Thanks to a ( fairly recent ) backup of the 250 giga , I 've still got most of the data , though some was lost .	St
1.1.5	I think it 's scandalous , particularly in view of the fact that the 250 giga one was my main HDD containing Win XP and all that that entails .	St
1.1.6	Is this normal behaviour for Maxtor HDDs ?	Ques
1.1.7	Thanks , Chalkbel .	St
1.2.1	I usually find such in overheated cases .	St
1.2.2	The lifespans drop as the temperatures climb .	St
1.2.3	I 'd look at that issue from the case and power supply angles .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Were both of these HDs in the same system and one mounted on top of the other ?	Ques
1.3.2	This is important , as closely mounted HDs tend to create a & quot ; hot spot & quot ; and heat in general just is n't good for any electronics .	St
1.3.3	Plus , large HDs are usualy stuffed with platters and they 're gettin the most out of the HD space and that can be tense as heat build-up can cause aureal drift and/or wear out the mechanicals faster due to tight tolerances .	St
1.3.4	It can be one or all of these problems , but they 're closely related .	St
1.3.5	For the most part , I do n't see a rash of Maxtors failing more than others .	St
1.3.6	I do suggest you cool your system as best as possible , when you request warranty replacement , if valid still .	Sug
1.3.7	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	and one is 4 years+ old	St
1.5.1	Thanks to all of you for your help .	St
1.5.2	Bob & Willy , both of these HDs are indeed in the same system and one mounted on top of the other , so overheating looks like the problem .	St
1.5.3	In that case , I can expect it to happen again if I do n't take action , which I will .	St
1.5.4	nerdyboy1234 , I think you 've reassured me as to Maxtor 's durability .	St
1.5.5	So I can stop looking at other makes ...	St
1.5.6	Thanks again , Chalkbel .	St
