<s> Anyone know where or if i can get a USB adaptor for a kensington mouse/keyboard combo? </s>
<s> i lost it when i was moving. </s>
<s> Any help is greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> Do you have any model information or anything we can use to identify the mouse? </s>
<s> When you say adaptor, what do you mean exactly? </s>
<s> Was it just an adaptor to work with the USB port, or was it the receiver? </s>
<s> If you're talking about the receiver, they don't usually sell them separately. </s>
<s> It was the receiver, but I found it in a box of junk since I moved. </s>
<s> Thanks anyway! </s>
