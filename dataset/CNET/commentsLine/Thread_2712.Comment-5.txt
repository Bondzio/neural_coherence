i would say to leave the computer off in a storm just incase, but you should check inside the computer for dust.
try to get as much dust out of the computer as you can, an air can is really good for this.
dust can heat up the computer a lot but acting like a blanket on the motherboard.
it can also get on wires and create a connection to make a spark and fry the motherboard.
