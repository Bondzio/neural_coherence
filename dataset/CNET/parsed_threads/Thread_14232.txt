<s> HI, I just purchased a Western Digital Hard drive (WD Caviar SE 80GB). </s>
<s> I want to use it as a second hard drive to install Linux on it. </s>
<s> Once I connected everything and I am starting my computer windows home edition doesn't boot. </s>
<s> The Computer also doesn't see the new Hard Drive?? </s>
<s> Bios: p4vma-m </s>
<s> That would be my initial quiestion to things. </s>
<s> Also, how do you plan on controlling which O/S will boot? </s>
<s> Some people use utilities for this though I think one could use the BIOS settings to change this. </s>
<s> Regards, JB </s>
<s> It's Sata so I do not need any jumpers. </s>
<s> I didn't get as far as installing linux. </s>
<s> The system is hanging as soon as I connect my hard drive... </s>
<s> I Have a Sata drive and had a lot off issues with it. </s>
<s> But when I installed the correct drivers, and set all the settings inside Bios every thing worked fine. </s>
<s> I also had a second operating system on one off the 3 hard drives I have in my system. </s>
<s> To get to my second hard drive with the XP on it or what ever, I had to go inside (Bios) and then inside off (Advanced Bios Features) and make a change from (HDD 0) To (SCSI)or HDD 1, HDD2, HDD3. </s>
<s> Thats how you access your second operating system on your other hard drive. </s>
<s> (A lot OFF Fun) Good Luck Wendell H </s>
<s> I made all kind of changes with bios, but windows doesn't boot properly. </s>
<s> It ishanging right in the beginning? </s>
<s> Some settings could be wrong inside Bios or you may have somthing wrong with your operating system. </s>
<s> Inside Bios there is a settings that will set you back to Load fail-safe default settings or Load optimized default settings. </s>
<s> You could try either one off them, and if that does not work you may have to reinstall windows. </s>
<s> Good Luck Wendell H </s>
