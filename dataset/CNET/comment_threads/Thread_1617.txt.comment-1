SO I have a 16gm sandisk jump drive, it has maybe 3 gbs on it.
I tried saving a picture off my face book to it and it says that the disc is full.
I had 12 gbs of music on it - and pulled that off, onto an external, restarted the system so now its back down to only 3 gbs of pictures on the drive, but i'm still getting the error, The folder I'm saving it into has 38,xxx files on it, could that be the issue?
Oh and using windows 7, same issue on firefox and chrome, I can open word and save a doc into the folder as well no issues
