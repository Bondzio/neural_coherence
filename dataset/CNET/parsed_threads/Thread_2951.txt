<s> My friend encountered a strange problem: double-click My Computer, IE always opens a window. </s>
<s> Has anyone seen this before, how to solve this problem? </s>
<s> Even double-click My Documents icon is the same! </s>
<s> Appreciate for the ideas. </s>
<s> Remove all BHOs from the system. </s>
<s> What's a BHO? </s>
<s> See google. </s>
<s> What do I use to remove them all? </s>
<s> I use HIJACKTHIS. </s>

<s> Thanks Bob. </s>
<s> I know what you mean. </s>
<s> I have tried similar tools, but failed. </s>
<s> After tried the tool you mentioned, it is the same. </s>
<s> Maybe the principle is the same, but the tools failed to find it/them out. </s>
<s> Thanks, anyway. </s>
<s> Funnily enough I tried doing the following: Boot your system in Safemode Open cmd (start, run, cmd). </s>
<s> Type &quot;c:&quot; and then press enter. </s>
<s> Type &quot;attrib&quot; -H -R -S autorun.inf and then press enter. </s>
<s> &quot;attrib -H -R -S autorun.inf&quot; </s>
<s> Also post that hijackthis for a peek under the hood. </s>
<s> Sometimes I see the other item. </s>

<s> Thanks Maddogmcree. </s>
<s> As for as I know this command is used for adding/getting rid of the file attribute of hidden, read-only and system. </s>
<s> How could I use this command to solve this problem, would you please say more clearly? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> autorun.inf file on your c:-drive that causes this problem. </s>
<s> This command would make it visible, so you could delete it. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> attrib -h -r -s \autorun.inf Kees </s>
