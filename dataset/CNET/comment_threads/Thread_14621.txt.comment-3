You're not alone in your thinking, recent changes by Apple to Intel processors has opened the thinking of many.
Personally, I like the Mac as well; it's sexy, all in one, etc.
But I have to remind myself the gains you get from a Mac are from the software, not the hardware.
So why buy equipment built to run it's own software and install Windows taking you right back to where you came from?
With that being said, imagine yourself on the phone with tech support about a software conflict and you expain your running Win XP on a Mac and getting errors using their product?
I suspect you'll get a long pause and the traditional ''We cannot support that configuration!''
So, I ask you ''is the climb worth the view?
For my money stay with the Windows product if that is the enviroment you're be working and make sure the new hardware will support Vista when it arrives!
