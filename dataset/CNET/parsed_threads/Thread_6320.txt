<s> I think it would probably be a good idea if I backed up my music, photos, and documents from my laptop just in case but this would be my first time so I'm not sure where to start. </s>
<s> I'm of course interested in Time Machine which seems to be pretty straight forward but I don't want to buy a $200 Time Capsule from Apple. </s>
<s> I really don't think I need alot of space, I only want one copy of everything, I don't really care about what everything looked like last week or the week before. </s>
<s> Is there a way you can have Time Machine back up online? </s>
<s> What should I get for a hard drive? </s>
<s> I would really rather it be wireless if possible. </s>
<s> Please tell me you're opinion and keep it simple since I'm not to tech-saavy. </s>
<s> Actually more but 3 copies keeps me in a state of backup when things go sour. </s>
<s> This forum is full of folk that made one copy and they post here asking how to get it back. </s>
<s> Learn from others. </s>
<s> And why not put what you have on some DVD? </s>
<s> That's 4GB and runs about 20 cents here. </s>
<s> If you don't do that you just set the price on your files. </s>

<s> You're right, DVD's are probably the best way to do it - even if it takes more effort. </s>
<s> Is there a really easy way to do it, other than the manual way? </s>
<s> Are DVD's trust worthy for not failing - I've heard rumors that as they get older than can fail? </s>
<s> Also can you use SD cards - has anyone tried this? </s>
<s> Thanks for you're help! </s>
<s> This is another reason why I have 3 copies. </s>
<s> If these were trustworthy I could live with one spare copy. </s>
<s> About DVD. </s>
<s> Since these are cheap enough I can make new ones, file them away and always put the DATE on them so I can sort the backups by date. </s>
<s> If you want an easier way, look into online backup offerings. </s>
