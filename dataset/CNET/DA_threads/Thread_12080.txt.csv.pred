1.1.1	I own a dell 4550 w/Intel pentium4 running window xp, sp2.	St
1.1.2	I have 1GB of Ram, but am about to add another 512MB.	St
1.1.3	In place I have a NVIDIA GeForce4 MX 420 graphics card and am having problems displaying any decent graphics without lag time.	St
1.1.4	I have been told that my graphics card slot is AGP not PCI or PCI/express.	St
1.1.5	(I am learning here!)	St
1.1.6	Now I've been told that I should install an AGP X4 and not a X8 card.	St
1.1.7	By a salesman.	St
1.1.8	Would like some unbias advice.	St
1.1.9	Is the AGP slot's size different from 4to8?	St
1.1.10	Or would an AGP X8 overpower my PC and that's the reason for the suggestion?	St
1.1.11	Plenty of power, 533 megahertz bus clock, but older PC.	St
1.1.12	(with an AGP slot, no less!)	St
1.1.13	Really don't want to sink too much $$ into it, just want to play one game.	St
1.1.14	Any recommendations on the right, economical graphics card for my pc?	St
1.2.1	slot for 4X or 8X is not different, however the support provided by the mobo anf its chips can vary.	St
1.2.2	Suggest that you go to the Dell website and research by your system number.	St
1.2.3	The info should be there.	Sug
1.2.4	I don't think that a BIOS update can change that but I am really not certain.	St
1.2.5	I'm surprised that the 1 GB of RAM isn't totally adequate.	St
1.2.6	Make certain that the AGP slot isn't limited to 2X.	St
1.2.7	Different voltages used.	St
1.3.1	Adding more Ram won't get you any noticably improved performance (when running a single application) There are very few programs that can acutally use that much memory.	St
1.3.2	The addition of that much RAM will get you improved performance when multitasking but won't provide any noticable difference when only running one application.	St
1.3.3	If you are looking for a gaming video card it's going to have it's own memory, otherswise you are stuck using the systems memory for video (now that will make a big difference) What you should look for is a card that has at least 256MB of video memory, the more you have on the card the higher you can set your level of detail without losing quality or response from the games.	St
1.3.4	I used to design AGP video cards and there is a big difference between in quality between the cheaper models and the ones that cost a little more.	St
1.3.5	Do some reasearch and read some reviews on some of the gaming sites before making a purchase.	St
1.3.6	Look at what cards the game's site recommends.	St
1.4.1	Had to ask my son how much RAM I had.	St
1.4.2	He said w/the 512 that I was about to install... a total of 1gig.	St
1.4.3	With some research, I have found that the game's minimum requirements are just that, minimum.	St
1.4.4	It does not allow the game to operate at maximim, hence the problem.	St
1.4.5	The other problem is my AGP.	St
1.4.6	Since it is an AGP slot, I am having difficulties finding a card, reasonably priced mind you, with 256MB.	St
1.4.7	I believe my AGP slot will not take anything higher than a 4x which creates the problem.	St
1.4.8	Best I can find is 128 4x/8x.	St
1.4.9	Still pricey though.	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	First to address the price, I didn't want to pay $100 or more.	St
1.6.2	I only want the decent graphics for one game.	St
1.6.3	Actually, it wasn't the graphics that was the problem, it's the lag time loading it all.	St
1.6.4	I was actually hoping to solve all this for around $50.	St
1.6.5	I see that's not going to happen.	St
1.6.6	I thought that maybe the memory card would solve the lag time in load.	St
1.6.7	Tried to put in today and it's the wrong card.	St
1.6.8	Matched it to the existing card and the notch on the bottom is in the wrong place.	St
1.6.9	Now I don't know what kind of memory card I'm looking for.	St
1.6.10	I've got to return both the agp card AND the memory card.	St
1.6.11	I swear this computer is killing me!	St
1.7.1	The indicates a MAX 0f 1GB RAM in two DIMM slots for your system .	St
1.7.2	.	St
1.7.3	.	St
1.7.4	might be able to see some video card options here too.	St
1.7.5	Here's a link for the RAM http://www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx?model=Dimension+4550+%28533MHz+FSB%29 Here's the link for the video card...unless you know exactly what you want...you have to have system scan your PC for comptability http://www.crucial.com/store/listmfgr.asp?cat=Video+Card VAPCMD	St
1.8.1	You can get really decent AGP graphics cards pretty cheap.	St
1.8.2	I got my brother who has an old HP pentium 1.4Ghz an AGP Nvidia 6800 extreme for only 150 bucks.	St
1.8.3	And that was many months ago.	St
1.8.4	I'll betcha you can get even better than that for a comparable price.	St
1.8.5	Go to tiger direct and see what deals they got for AGPs.	St
1.8.6	The PCIe's now are about 600 bucks.	St
1.9.1	Wow!	St
1.9.2	Since my problem was understanding and buying the right part, this website solved it.	St
1.9.3	Hopefully, I won't need it again, but it is definitely going in my favorites.	St
1.9.4	So far, I have bought the wrong memory card and graphics card, TWICE!	St
1.9.5	And now it looks like I over paid for the graphics card twice, too.	St
1.9.6	The website won't let me scan for a new graphics card though.	St
1.9.7	Maybe because it knows that at the moment my pc couldn't handle a new one without more memory.	St
1.9.8	Or a glitch in the system.	St
1.9.9	Who knows.	St
1.9.10	But at least now, if I do try to do another upgrade it won't be so frustrating.	St
1.9.11	I can not thank everyone enough for all their help.	Polite
1.9.12	I didn't realize that this kind of expert help was at my fingertips.	St
1.9.13	You rock CNET members!	St
1.10.1	the sound card.	St
1.10.2	Games use directx, and directx improves with good video cards and good sound cards.	St
1.10.3	Hardware acceleration.	St
1.11.1	After cracking open my pc yesterday, I know I have an AGP slot AND a PCI slot.	St
1.11.2	I don't think a PCIe will fit in the PCI slot.	St
1.11.3	Besides, I didn't want to go that high in price.	St
1.11.4	There is still some question in mind as to whether to use the AGP slot or the PCI slot and what would give me the best performance for the price.	St
1.11.5	After using the crucial website offered, I realize that I may need to put the memory card in prior to using the website again and scanning for the right graphics card.	St
1.11.6	I will keep all you wonderful people informed.	St
1.11.7	Thanks!	St
1.12.1	It came out after PCI.	St
1.12.2	And PCIexpress is not PCI.	St
1.12.3	PCIe is a different plugin.	St
1.12.4	I have one gig of memory too, and I was thinking of upgrading to 2 gigs.	St
1.12.5	But I really don't think it'll make much difference.	St
1.12.6	My little brother bought a game called &quot;criminal minds&quot; I think it was, and it wouldn't run with his original card.	St
1.12.7	So I got him that 6800 at tiger direct, and now it runs nice and smooth.	St
1.12.8	And his computers quite old (it's a 1.4 Ghz HP multimedia PC with 512m of memory).	St
1.13.1	you get it upgraded.	St
1.13.2	VAPCMD	St
1.14.1	out there.	St
1.14.2	I have been told that agp is slow, slow, slow.	St
1.14.3	But one has to go work with what they got.	St
1.14.4	My pc new, came w/an agp.	St
1.14.5	I thought it best if I stuck with it.	St
1.15.1	So far, I've installed the agp card and am waiting on the memory card.	St
1.15.2	I am not crashing as much on this website now.	St
1.15.3	That's good!	St
1.15.4	I did not see much change in the graphics though.	St
1.15.5	I really expected an improvement.	St
1.15.6	But that wasn't the priority for me.	St
1.15.7	I think once I get the memory card installed my pc will be able to handle all the multi-tasking within the website and out.	St
1.15.8	My only fear is that I've ordered the wrong memory card.	St
1.15.9	Thanks guys!	St
1.16.1	NIL	St
1.17.1	and I have done exactly what I thought I would.	St
1.17.2	I have ordered the wrong memory card.	St
1.17.3	I am now in the process of returning and ordering the correct one.	St
1.17.4	There is a reason why I call myself &quot;killed by a computer&quot;.	St
1.18.1	NIL	St
1.19.1	with help from the company owner I exchanged the memory card and am now running problem free.	St
1.19.2	The game site now has more problems than I do.	St
1.19.3	And in the process of all this I have learned quite a bit!	St
1.19.4	Thanks to all of you for your help.	St
