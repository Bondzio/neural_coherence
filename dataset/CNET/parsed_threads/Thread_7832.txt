<s> Is there a program I can install to a usb thumbdrive that will search a computer for nasty files ( porn chatrooms... ..) or find passwords and keylog </s>
<s> There is no single program that could do this and get it right all the time. </s>
<s> For example there are porn sites in the registry of Windows and I've seen folk go ballastic when I show them that. </s>
<s> They claim they were never there. </s>
<s> These are in a block list so just because it's there doesn't mean much at all. </s>
