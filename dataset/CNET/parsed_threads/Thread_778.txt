<s> Hi Quandary121, they are talking about Video card memory, not system board memory. </s>
<s> Its an easy thing to get confused with... </s>
<s> I have a Sony that I put a 256 AGP card in, and 2 Mb of memory.Games want to lock up,so I thought I would move up to a 512. </s>
<s> I found out I only have a 200 watt power supply and it did not have the power to run the bigger 512 card. </s>
<s> I was informed I couldn't go any higher on the power because Sony will not let me. </s>
<s> So when people say you can run this or that kind of video card, don't forget to tell them to read the side of the box to see how much power they need, and know how much you have in your computer. </s>
