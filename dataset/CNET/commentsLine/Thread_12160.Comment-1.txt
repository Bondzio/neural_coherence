i custom builted my pc in hong kong, the chasis i purchased isn't very study, in fact i's quite cheap, anywho i've noticed a very serious problem with the power button on the front of my pc.
the power button itself is about the size of a thumb, but what's so bad about it is that it's too sensitive.
i've never noticed it before, but this morning when i turned on my pc, i only *touch* the button lightly, and boom my pc powers on, i didn't even push the button all the way in, i just touch it and my pc is already on, now to me this is very serious and worries me quite alot.
i'm worry that my pc might fry becasue of it, i had an old hp, i rememebr when i push the power button once but my hands were abit shaky so when i push the button once, the button was actually pushed twice causing the pc to rapidly turn on and off then back on again, then before i know it my hp fried up and was dead, it was unrepaiable.
now i'm worried that the sam thing might happen again on my new pc, if the button is so sensitive, if my hands got shaky again when i push it won't my new pc fried like my old hp?
i have a very cheap psu, and that makes things worst and me more worried, below is my pc spec: psu 250 watts p4 2.6 asus mobo 1gb ram 80gb sata hd geforce 6600 liteon dvd rom live on dvd burner tv card so i want to know, if my old hp took 3 rapid restarts to break, will it happened again if my hands got shaky and i push that very sensitive power button on my new pc?
i'm very worried, please help me t_t
