I've had zero issues with brands until others.
As to the speed, I have settled down to giving the nod to 5400 RPM every time.
But yes, since the access times are not set by the OS, any OS would gain advantages here.
If I were to have all brands available I might make a quick study of the Watts and the seek times of the available units.
