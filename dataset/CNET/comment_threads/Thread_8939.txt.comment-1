I have noticed that the audio cuts out randomly.
I will be playing songs on winamp and all of a sudden when the next song comes up it doesn't play.
If I hit the play button it doesn't move.
All the audio then does not work for my computer until I shutdown and reboot.
It is not just winamp either, which i thought at first.
If i use Media player, or another program, or even if i am just surfing the web.
I have checked the volume control and it is still set to high volume.
Any ideas?
