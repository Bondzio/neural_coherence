what do u mean lose firmware... firmware and driver are different... i am thinking that the drivers are missing.
give the spec of ur computer.
if this is indeed an hp or compaq machine visit the site.
what would be much easier would be go out and buy a new dvd burner drive.
it is probably much faster at reading and burning disks than both of your drives and relatively inexpensive and easy to install.
