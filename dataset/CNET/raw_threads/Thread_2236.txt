You need a 'real' graphics card. The cpu ships with an onboard nVidia GeForce 6100 video processor on the motherboard. Good for everyday stuff, but not so good for serious computing. I upgraded to a GeForce 7800 GT OC PCI Express card. 2.) It ships with 1 gig of PC-3200 DDR memory (DO NOT believe the tech assistance info here. It falsely says the system uses PC-4200 DDR2, it does NOT.) Install at least one more gig (there are 4 memory slots each supporting up to 1 gig) of high quality DDR (I used Dual channel matched Corsair memory). The unit ships with 1 gig CAS 3 memory, you can do much better. After these upgrades I can easily play 2 instances of Dark Age of Camelot on the computer without missing a beat. Photo editing is a breeze, even if my antivirus is scanning in the background. One caveat here, while the Media Center computer has 7 USB2 ports and 2 Firewire ports, it only has one PCI Express slot and 2 PCI slots, one of which is occupied with a useless 56K modem, and the other with the TV tuner. Consequently expandability is very limited. The GT5032 does not have a 3.5&quot; floppy drive. On the plus side, thanks to its BTX motherboard/layout this is one very quiet computer! It also has convenient memory card slots in the front. This is a good little computer, that with some cash and a bit of tweaking can be a great one.

Bought this computer yesterday, and tv locked up minutes after install...saw lots of peoples' reviews at retail stores after purchase, who stated same problem. Found it hard to believe the &quot;pros&quot; at Consumer Reports #1 Retailer - MicroCenter (KS) did not have a clue about this problem and recommended this as a great media center computer for tv use. Went back to store next day and they offered to exchange..hahaha. Luckily, searched Google one last time for a solution tonight...and here it is...the update from Microsoft provided by &quot;The Wesker&quot; fixed the problem asap!!!!! Have been running tv now for about 2+ plus hours without skips, stalls, freezing, etc.

The minimum for the GeForce 7800 GT OC PCI Express card is 400W. Did you also replace the power supply when you tweaked your GT5032? I'm getting very flaky results with the standard 300W power supply and the BFG help desk said that it was because of the lack of power.

However, I am still having problems running two monitors. If I leave the hardware acceleration at ''Full'' then I get both monitors going black, with the only recourse left is to reboot. I have monitored the video card and cpu temperature and they are all in the normal range. It varies from 15 minutes to several hours before it shuts off. I have hibernate and all power saving turned off. If I run just a single monitor, it seems to stay up longer, but even then I have had it lock up. I tried setting the Hardware acceleration to None and it ran for over 24 hours with no problem. I'm now notching it back up one tick at a time. I am now several hours into the second tick up from None. Has anyone else had these kinds of problems? By the way, I already replaced the BFG GeForce 7800 GT OC card once. The second card exhibited the very same symptoms as the first. Is this a problem with the Gateway, the video card, or an incompatibility between the two? Any ideas out there?

Have had no issues with it even under a load. I have had no problems at all with the BFG 7800 GT OC card out of the box. When I put in the card I didn't notice the manufacturer's requirements for a 400 watt power supply, but have experienced no issues at all with the stock Gateway 300w PS. I am using the integrated sound card and I do not use the TV tuner card at all. Like I said I have had great luck with this system/card set-up.

Is it possible that one of your power dongles from the PS to your card are screwed up somehow? This could result in lower than expected current flow to your video card and all sorts of funky problems. I know the Gateway didn't have sufficient power cables on the PS when I got mine so I had to pick up some splitters. It may be possible that one of yours has some hidden damage. If so, this could be a three dollar fix. Just a thought. ---Paul

I have just now used a second PCI-e power cable that came with the Antec power supply and plugged it into a different outlet on the power supply. Another thing that I forgot to mention is that the Hardware acceleration is set independantly for each monitor. The setting for the Samsung has been set on full since the beginning. The setting for the Gateway is the one that I have been varying. I found that either None or the very first notch seems to work (at least up to 24 hours). When I tried the second notch yesterday it failed after several hours. Today I have switched the power cables as described and set the Hardware acceleration to full to see if it fails. Thanks for your suggestion!

However, in general, you should follow the instructions that came with the video card. I believe they suggest that you install their drivers first, then instal the card. The one thing you will have to do is upon startup go into the boot settings and change the video from the built in to PCI-e. I don't remember the exact settings, but you should be able to find it. Hope this helped!
