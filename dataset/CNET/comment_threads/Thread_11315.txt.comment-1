I'm shopping for an online backup service for my Mac.
I'm currently trying Carbonite but I'm reading good things about Crashplan also.
Any recommendations?
I'll be backing up around 50 GB of data and once the initial upload is done, the incremental backups will be pretty small.
I have cable internet with pretty good upload speeds.
