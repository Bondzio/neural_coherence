My wife's Dell laptop uses an older DVD-rom and can only read &quot;DVD- &quot;, not the &quot;DVD +&quot;.
Check all of your documentation the came with you unit and it should say specifically what formats it will read.
When my friend and I purchased a 100 pack of the &quot;DVD -&quot; disks to archive a set of various data and entertainment files, we found that they would't play on her laptop or our bargain DVD player.
Had to go back and get some &quot;DVD -&quot; media and all now play on all the afore-mentioned players.
Try you docs first and then check for the format on the disks you want to plsy.
Your only so;ution may to upgrase to new player on your unit ...(if it is possible).
Notebooks and laptops are notoriusly un-upgradable.
