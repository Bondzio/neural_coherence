1.1.1	Well I'm planing on buying a pc with the following specs: Motherboard: Asus Striker II Formula CPU : Core 2 Quad 6600(2.4Ghz) Ram : 4 x 1Gb Hardisk : 320Gb Sata Optical : Asus DVD Writer (LightScribe) Graphics : 8800Gt 512Mb Will a Blue Storm Power Suply (500W) be sufficient?	St
1.2.1	you may want to consider replacing it with something with a bit more headroom.	St
1.3.1	For example...	St
1.4.1	since you've got a high-end mobo and i expect you'll be overclocking, and you could go sli in the future, get a good 700w or larger unit.	St
1.4.2	ocz 700w, $125 before $30 rebate: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817341002 corsair 750w, $130 before $10 rebate: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139006	St
1.5.1	Thnx.	St
1.5.2	Apart from that, do u that ive good specs or is that too much??	St
1.5.3	I mean, isnt a core 2 duo and 2 gigs sufficient?	St
1.5.4	I want my pc to last at least i year.. n i dont know yet if i will overclock or not	St
1.6.1	You didn't include a system builder's license of the operating system in your build list.	St
1.6.2	The components looked good to me.	St
1.6.3	If I were doing it, I'd prob'ly get 2x2GB rather than 4x1 GB.	St
1.6.4	For my recent build I got 2x2 GB fast DDR2 for under $100 and there's also a $30 mail-in rebate (altho I'm still waiting for it, and we all know rebates don't always actually show up in your mailbox...) 2 sticks are easier to manage on a mobo, plus it leaves me the possibility of bumping up to 8 GB if I need to convert my own machine into a work computer.	St
1.6.5	(my work requires good computing power, but home is usually just for gaming/hobby stuff) Of course if the OS license is a 32-bit, then there's no incentive to go to 4 GB, let alone 8, so can't be sure what's best for your rig.	St
1.7.1	that's a $300 motherboard.	St
1.7.2	you're wasting that money if you don't plan on overclocking since it will perform just like a $100 mobo at stock speeds.	St
1.7.3	also, no reason to pay for an sli board if you don't plan on using 2 video cards.	St
1.7.4	it's like buying a z06 corvette and then never getting it past 70mph.	St
1.7.5	yeah, a 3ghz core2duo and 2gigs will be &quot;enough&quot;, but i'd still go for 2x2gb ddr2 since it's only another $40-$60.	St
1.7.6	go with 2 sticks since you'd have to probably have to run your ram slower or increase the voltage to get 4 sticks up to full speed.	Sug
1.8.1	Well i think ill drop the quad and take up the core 2 duo and keep the 4gig ram.	St
1.8.2	i'm planing to use vista 64bit(since i'll be on 4gig ram) and i already own a xp licence, so i shall use both.	St
1.8.3	anyway, like i said, i want a mobo to last at least 1 year and also play games on medium/high settings xcept for crysis of course).	St
1.8.4	the reason why im opting for the striker 2 is for me t be able to upgrade when more demanding games come out.	St
1.8.5	also, is a 8800gt 512mb enough to play cod 4 at high settings.	St
1.8.6	ive already bought the card, so there is no reverting back as far as graphics is concern.	St
1.8.7	n i'll be playing on a 22&quot; monitor.	St
1.8.8	so, is it enough?	St
1.8.9	?	Ques
1.9.1	these 4xAA figures are borderline, so 2xAA will be smooth.	St
1.9.2	http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/video/display/xfx-gf8800gts_7.html#sect1	St
