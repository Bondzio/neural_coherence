But until you decide if its worth asking, this will the the ANSWER. Set it up as ADHOC and you can connect to the PC. But missing from your post is what such a connection would do. What documentation? The link I supplied.

I will NOT help you get this to work but will tell you the articles and methods that were used a few years ago. The problem is that there are so many steps involved and with today's firewalls most owners can't get it to work anymore. Since it's a TARPIT of issues the smart people don't do this anymore. They get a router. So here goes. You will be installing ICS on the PC. You can use this link as example on what to do next -&gt; http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/networking/expert/bowman_02april08.mspx

Some can't deal with anyone telling them a generic answer such as &quot;set the gateway&quot; but need a video or pictures that match the exact screens you'll encounter. I have yet to find a cure for such an issue. Bob

15256	15	291685	2759133	2759039	R. Proffitt	4/25/08 4:42 PM	1.20914172E12	No.	All that we have has been discussed above. Sometimes owners really don't want to dive into it so they move to the router and software like Network Magic. In closing, if there was a clue in your posts I'd point it out but as you present the issues there is nothing amiss unless you didn't do the setup proper or firewalled it. Bob
