My intent is to transcode video from DVD to avi & to backup my dvd's to DVD-R discs (2 movies per disc). On my old system I ripped the dvd's (purchased) to one hard drive F: (not the xp boot drive wich was c: ) then used Nero to combine the main movies onto on DVD - using a temp drive on E:. This is a total of 3 drives. It was reasonably quick. Much quicker than doing everything on a single drive like I used to. My new system currently has xp on the old 40G drive. My question is would I benefit from the sata drive or just getting a cheaper pata drive since I'm mixing sata & pata already? Thanks Danneauxs

Let me be short about this and say if you love Rube Goldberg contraptions you'll understand that if we mix and match we may learn far too much about our machines. Either it will be fine or we learn about our BIOS, the OS and it seems like we just took a sip from a firehose as we sit there and wonder what happened. Then again sometimes you flip the switch and the light comes on, the melody plays. Sadly there appears to be no standards that we could rely on to tell you if you will hear music or find yourself doused. Bob
