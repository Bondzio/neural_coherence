Suddenly one morning my computer was still recognising the drive (but not as the name I had named it), but saw nothing on it. Contacted Maxtor, recommended OnTrack. Ran OnTrack - found 16178 (there should be 18000+) and put up message &quot;Error encountered while scanning partition&quot;. I then don't have 80Gb space on my PC. Is there a way of partitioning the hard drive so I can put the 80Gb on the same drive? Please help!
