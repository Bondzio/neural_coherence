<s> Hello, My company wants to get me a new router for work at home usage, but I am confused on what I should get now. </s>
<s> I currently have Belkin router and Belkin cards at home, but all in the old .11b standard. </s>
<s> I see now MIMO is out and highly praised, but also listed as to be cautious due to the new .11n that will be implemented; a question of whether the MIMO will be obsolete if not used as the new .11n standard? </s>
<s> Does anyone know what is going on with the new standard, MIMO, should I hold off getting a new router at this time? </s>
<s> -thanks, Russ </s>
<s> I found a dlink 834 with 802.11g mimo for not much. </s>
<s> Since N seems to be in the wings of 2008, 9 or later I didn't worry about it. </s>
<s> So for cheap I updated my router. </s>
<s> As to mimo, I thought this was just a way to use multiple antennas and not a standard. </s>
