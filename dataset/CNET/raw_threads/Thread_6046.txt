Wireless network uses Netgear Rangemax and Netgear USB. Even though computer signal was strong the phones would kick it out whenever a wireless 2.4 GHz was anwered. It didn't matter if the phone was not even near the router or USB. I have 4 wireless phones throughout the house now on 5.8 GHz including one near (&lt;8 ft.) to the router and another within a foot of the USB. No problems at all now with phone interference. The nice thing about the 5.8 GHZ is that many can go up to 8 lines. They are pricier than 900 MHz phones. The 5.8 GHz have much better range though. So if moving the router doesn't work out, the move to another phone frequency should.
