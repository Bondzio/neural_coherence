I am trying to use my pc's internet connection that I am getting from a cricket wireless device to go to a linksys wrt54g router. I believe it should be possible to enable ICS and hook up a cable from the nic on the pc to the wan port on the router but have not been able to get it to work so far. OS=Win 7 but would like to know how to do it on xXP also. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks
