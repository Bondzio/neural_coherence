I have had a call from my computer repair chap and he tells me that my computer is riddled with viruses (the problems I had had all the appearances of a virus) I have Norton internet Security and keep it up to date and I scan it all the time but this does not seem to protect he computer, how can you make sure that viruses cannot infect the computer, I thought that Norton was pretty good but I was wrong.
