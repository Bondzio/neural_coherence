<s> so I just recieved some comptuer stuff for my birthday My computer has: AMD AThlon 3800+ X2 dual core 2.0GhZ processor one 250GB hard drive one CD/DVD writer drive x1 512 MB DDR2 SDRAM x2 2 GB DDR2 SDRAM new video card that requires 400W (Geforce 8600GTS) http://reviews.cnet.com/desktops/compaq-presario-sr5130nx-desktop/4507-3118_7-32773948.html?tag=specs (full specs) I got a 400W PSU for the video card but forgot I'd have to power the rest of the system. </s>
<s> So how many watts do you think I should shoot for? </s>
<s> Try the other method of calculating power. </s>
<s> Total up the amperes on each supply as well as the total watts. </s>
<s> See that neither gets close to 400 Watts or the amperage on each supply. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I would go for a 500Watt PSU of quality power for that system. </s>
<s> It also depends if you are going to add another drive, fan and/or video card in the future, so it's good to future proof yourself. </s>
<s> The other posters covered the topic well, i just like to add don't be too cheap in buying a decent psu. </s>
<s> Beware, some psu makers *may* post specs that really aren't that good once heat stress is placed on them and/or severe service, they degrade quickly. </s>
<s> In this regard paying a bit more makes for happy system experience. </s>
<s> The overall best advice is buy the biggest wattage psu and namebrand you can afford and be done with it. </s>
<s> Afterall, there are now 1.5k watts(and related amps) psus offered now, though you won't need that. </s>
<s> If you like use a psu watts calculator and then add 100W to the calculated total for optimum current needs. </s>
<s> You can search these forums for past answers that repeatedly cover the topic. </s>
<s> good luck tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I tried that wattage calc, and it looks like I'm probably running at almost 200W (probably a little high, seeing as I'm using a 250W) without a video card. </s>
<s> I guess I'll be getting something around 600-700W. </s>
<s> WHAT EVER YOU DO DO DONT GET A COOLER MASTER 550W I GOT IT AND IT IS LOUD AS HELL! </s>
<s> LIKE THINK OF A LOUD PC AND THEN DOUBLE IT...YES THATS HOW LOUD IT IS </s>
<s> Buying a Power Supply can be tricky. </s>
<s> You'll find the same Wattage Power Supply for sale at prices ranging from $20 to $220. </s>
<s> Why not buy the cheap one ? </s>
<s> Or use the PS that came with your case ? </s>
<s> Cheap Power Supplies fail, and often they will destroy your Motherboard, Hard Drive, and pretty much everything. </s>
<s> Honestly, it's just not worth it. </s>
<s> Plan on spending at least $80 for a 350W or better Power Supply. </s>
<s> It will be money well spent. </s>
<s> Good brands I've bought are BFG and Antec, There are others that are good, too. </s>
