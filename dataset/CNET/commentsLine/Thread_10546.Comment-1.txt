i have a idotconnect metal gear box 3.5&quot; hard drive.
the box reads 3.5&quot; ide to usb 2.0/1394a i lost the power adapter for this hard drive and all my stuff is on it.. it's 6-pin and it says &quot;dc in&quot; where it plugs in to the hard drive.
i've been googling this company, the product, the adapter.. i cant find anything with this pin layout.. is this a typo??
i found something similar, with the 5v and the gnd reversed.. see pic below
