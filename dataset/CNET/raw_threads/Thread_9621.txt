I would like to hook it up to the internet. I have wireless capabilities on my computer inside the house. What I need to know is what kind of adaptor would I need to get in order to connect the pc outside. Also is there an adaptor that would allow me to connect. I've been looking at the linksys wusb11. Any help would be appreciated

Good luck.
