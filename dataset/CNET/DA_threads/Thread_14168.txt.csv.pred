1.1.1	Hello , My apologies if this question has been asked in the past : Does anyone know if manufacturers are working on technology so LCD monitors can work at multiple resolutions without extrapolation/distortion from their native resolution ?	Ques
1.1.2	I 'd be interested in such a monitor as my work has me working in multiple resolutions .	St
1.1.3	Things are just a bit too blurry when not working at the native resolution ( unlike a CRT monitor ) .	St
1.1.4	Thank you all for your time , Paul	St
1.2.1	There are well defined reasons why LCDs do this .	St
1.2.2	Microsoft and others attempt to clear it up with software like Clear Type but for now , for today you want to run at the native resolution and use the DPI and font size settings to get a clear image .	St
1.2.3	Changing the video display mode is no longer the proper method to enlarge fonts , etc .	St
1.2.4	However it taps some owner 's computer skills to use the new ways so you have to be gentle about it .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
