1.1.1	Hi All , Any recommendations for a good passive wifi antenna that I can plug into the USB port of my Win7 laptop ?	Ques
1.1.2	I want to pick up a weak wifi signal .	St
1.1.3	Thanks !	St

1.2.1	Not sure what you mean by passive .	Res
1.2.2	If you want a USB device to in effect amplify the signal to your internal wireless card I have not see such a device .	St
1.2.3	To be truly & quot ; Passive & quot ; you would have to hook a antenna directly to the internal wireless card .	St
1.2.4	You have 2 options .	St
1.2.5	You can use what is called a signal extender to amplify and repeat the signal or you can use a USB based card that allows you to attach external antenna .	St
1.2.6	Some signal repeaters also can take external antenna .	St
1.2.7	All depends if you must have it USB connected or you can tolerate a second box .	St
1.2.8	The extenders are a little easier to get a store if that is a consideration .	St
