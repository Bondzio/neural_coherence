hi, i have win98 yes the modem did come with the drivers on cd but i have gone crazy trying to fu=igure out why i have this missinf file after installing them.
I have tryed to update the driver in device manager but still receive the error when the computer boots up to the desktop.
the error that i am getting is the msvcp60.dll file is linked to missing export msvcrt.dll_ic_collate_cp the modem never shows up in the device manager only the pci enumerator problem.
