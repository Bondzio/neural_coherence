<s> Ok so I have a dvd box set that I stupidly ordered from a seller located in the UK. </s>
<s> Problem is that they are a different region as the US. </s>
<s> This wouldn't be such a problem but it seems like everything is equipped with these lame region restrictions. </s>
<s> The most problematic at this time is my DVD-RW drive. </s>
<s> Apparently you can only change it's region a limited number of times and I have reached the limit. </s>
<s> My question for all the geekier people out there than myself is what can I do to beat the region problem? </s>
<s> below is link to a screen shot of the driver region status for the DVD-RW which is basically saying I'm screwed. </s>
<s> BTW I have a eMachines T6410 (I know it's lame) Any help or advice at all would be greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> Thanks, Paul http://lh3.ggpht.com/Pkr8ch/SAqgLXsb9nI/AAAAAAAAAM0/x_JHFrhOgj0/s400/screwed.jpg </s>
<s> The drives are cheap. </s>
<s> Under 30 bucks for a nice sata dvdrw. </s>
<s> CHEAPER than what they charge to reset the count. </s>
<s> do you know of any particular drive or software that would allow me to view dvd's regularly from multiple regions without lowering my allowance of region changes? </s>
<s> It has to do with a national agreement. </s>
<s> You only find these in Australia and other few countries. </s>
<s> Why is this a big issue at such a low cost part? </s>
<s> Well to most people $30 here and there is nothing but I'm kind of broke. </s>
<s> That's why I was looking for a permanent solution to the problem that would allow me to basically forget that there was a such thing as different region codes. </s>
<s> It's an agreement made in most countries. </s>
<s> As I must obey the local laws I can't comment on breaking said law. </s>
