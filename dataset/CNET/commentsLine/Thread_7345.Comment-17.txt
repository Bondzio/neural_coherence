i believe i replied to the wrong individual (below) in this discussion, however, my question was whether the problem for the d-link dir-655 router has been solved?
i too am having the same problems.
while i have not tried manually downloading the latest firmware which appears to be 1/28/2010... well pas thist post date (i will), i just thought i'd ask now (before i get home to test this option out) and since i did not see a resolution or &quot;i got it&quot;.
thanks
