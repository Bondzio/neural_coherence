1.1.1	I have an HP 4ML printer ( yes , one that works with a Mac as well as a PC ) that has a little bit of paper stuck on the roller .	St
1.1.2	Actually , a whole sheet of paper rolled around the roller .	St
1.1.3	I 'd really prefer to keep it going until I upgrade both my system and my computers ( a desktop G4 and laptop G3 ) .	St
1.1.4	I managed to pull a lot of the paper out of the computer , but there 's still a little bit in there , and I ca n't get hold of a leading edge .	St
1.1.5	Does anyone know how to advance the roller so I can get at it ?	Ques
1.1.6	I have no guarantee that that will do the whole trick ( a wee bit of the rubber from the roller fell out when I got hold of the majority of the paper ) , but I 'd surely like to try to get the last bit of paper out and see .	St
1.1.7	The only place I know of , here in New York City that might be willing to repair it will charge $ 100+ to do the job ( and if I need a new roller , it will be more ) , and there are n't many printers around , it would seem , that will work with the system I 'm using .	St
1.1.8	( OS 9.2.2 -- I have my reasons . )	St
1.1.9	Please do n't give me helpful advice about why I should n't be using OS 9 anymore .	Ques
1.1.10	I appreciate the good will but could n't act on it right now .	St
1.1.11	Just , please , if you know how to make the roller advance , tell me .	Sug
1.1.12	If I ca n't do that , or if the dear old Laserject refuses to work even after I get the paper bit ( s ) our and clean it , I 'll come back and ask for more help , OK ?	Ques
1.1.13	Thanks so much , in advance .	St
1.1.14	jenny	St
1.2.1	http : //www.google.com/search ? hl=en & q=fix+your+own+printer finds a common site for such endeavors and I would look into my kit with long tweezers with the gripping surface to reach in and get the paper off the roller .	St
1.2.2	Maybe the site above sells a new or slightly used roller ?	Ques
1.2.3	Bob PS .	St
1.2.4	I take it you want to talk about older OSes ?	Ques
1.3.1	Thanks , Bob .	St
1.3.2	I 'll try the link and get back to you .	St
1.3.3	I think that the bit of roller that came out , though , was owing to my enthusiastic efforts with a tweezer , so I may have to forgo that .	St
1.3.4	As for a new or slightly used roller , I 'm not sure where I 'd go with that .	St
1.3.5	I tried , as a prelim , to take out screws on the bottom of the printer , hoping to get at the paper that way , and I hit a dead end .	St
1.3.6	Just could n't get the thing apart !	St
1.3.7	I 'm sure there 's a way to do it , but it may take a pro , and that means major money ( or almost as major as buying a new printer ) .	St
1.3.8	Anyway , I 'm not sure I 'd know how to replace the roller , even if I got the machine apart .	St
1.3.9	No , I do n't want to talk about older OSes.My remark was a tip of the hat to mrmacfixit , who ca n't see why I do n't just go to a version of OS X that has Classic mode ( or better ) but has been solicitous to my needs , all the same .	St
1.3.10	Why I ca n't do that right now is another story .	St
1.3.11	Do n't fret about it .	St
1.3.12	I 'll work something out .	St
1.3.13	I did n't mention that I do a lot of printing in black and white and so have preferred the lower cost per page of a laser .	St
1.3.14	Not sure what I 'd buy if I were to have to get a new printer , but I 'm really hoping I do n't have to make that move right now .	St
1.3.15	Better to wait till I can have OS X , some version of which almost all the printers I saw at J & R require .	St
1.3.16	But then , does n't everything Mac , these days ?	Ques
1.3.17	Best , jenny	St
1.4.1	Bob , I did , at last , get to use the link you offered me from Google and ended up at a fix-it-yourself printer Website , thence to their forums .	St
1.4.2	It turns out that quite a few people have problems with paper jams on their HP LaserJet 4MLs , though none quite the same as mine , so I do n't have a & quot ; fix & quot ; for my problem yet .	St
1.4.3	Hoping for some help in advancing the roller and then , if that ca n't be done or is n't sufficient to fix the old dear thing up , maybe someone can tell me how to open the printer up .	St
1.4.4	I did try before I consulted this forum .	St
1.4.5	I thought that by taking out all the screws that seemed to hold the bottom on , I could get at the roller but hit a roadblock .	St
1.4.6	Oh , well .	St
1.4.7	I shall wait , in hope of an answer from that other group .	St
1.4.8	Did a search for the part ( a roller ) , just in case I needed to replace that , but even that splendid fixit site could n't come up with one .	St
1.4.9	I guess the 4ML is just too old a model .	St
1.4.10	Good site , though .	St
1.4.11	Thanks again for the link .	St
1.4.12	Above and beyond , etc .	St
1.4.13	jenny That , in long , is the tale so far .	St
