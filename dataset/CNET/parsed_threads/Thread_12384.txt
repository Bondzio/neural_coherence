<s> I posted this in Win98 forum but as I look here THIS is probly the proper place for my problem. </s>
<s> When I push the power button on my computer it powers up and if I keep it pushed in the the system will boot up ...but if I release the button the power will shut down...Ideas? </s>
<s> solutions..? </s>
<s> Hi Guess, Not enough info! </s>
<s> Is this a new computer or was it working OK before? </s>
<s> Have you made any component changes before this happened? </s>
<s> If you have made any changes, I would think that you may have used the reset switch wires instead of the power on/off wires. </s>

<s> It appears you have an ATX type powered system. </s>
<s> All you need is to &quot;momentarily&quot; hit the ON/OFF sw. for it to turn on. </s>
<s> If you keep depressing the sw., it will start to shutdown. </s>
<s> That's normal for the system to do. </s>
<s> The only thing I can think if it doesn't do this prorperly is a flaky sw. or one that gets stuck/sticky. </s>
<s> These are simple sw. and shouldn't cause problems. </s>
<s> I suggest maybe a quick squirt of WD-40 or similar at the sw. area if a sticky button, otherwise replace sw. if determined to be bad. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> sorry Roger, The computer is older used ...and I did just reformat the HD and load Win98se....but finished ....booted up thru the process several times...alls well...no problems ....had some problems getting tower case cover back on ...may have jarred the computer a lil...but seemed like alot of wire or componet clearence...finished and...thus THE BUTTON problem </s>
<s> Actually Willy, it's the type of switch that you can actually hear or feel the click in order to turn off the computer you have to depress the switch quickly till it clicks and release...when resetting the computer it dosent shut down automatically...the prompt jus states &quot;it's safe to turn orr your computer now&quot;...Im thinking its probly the switch ...but im not a tech and dont really know how to test it </s>
<s> I got it...I pulled the case front off and the switch worked fine.. so with the front on apparently there wasnt enuff room for the switch to go its full travel...I removed the switch and inserted a washer between the case and switch thus setting the switch farther back.....works fine ...have no idea why it did this tho </s>
