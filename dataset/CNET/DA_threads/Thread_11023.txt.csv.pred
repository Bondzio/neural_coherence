1.1.1	Hi, I have a media raid configuration (1xSystem drive 40GB and 2x 80GB on the Meadia Raid) My 2x80's are completely full and I cannot afford portable firewire drives.	St
1.1.2	So can I buy two new internal drives and just swap them over?	St
1.1.3	I wish to keep everything as is on the original 80's and if ever I need too just re-plug them back in to access the information.	St
1.1.4	Sound feasible?	St
1.1.5	Also, I believe I can add up to 4 hard drives on a media raid... My question is do they all have to be the same size?	St
1.1.6	Or, could I put 2x 40's or 2x160's to sit alongside the other 2 x80's I already have installed.	St
1.1.7	I've tried an extra 20GB drive but got freaked when it asked me to do new BIOS settings or something.... needless to say, I could not get it to work.	St
1.1.8	However, this is an option I would be very interested in looking into.	St
1.1.9	I also figure I'd need some PCI (I think that's what it's called) cable to link them together?	St
1.1.10	Anyway, thoughts/dialogue/advice would be most appreciated.	St
1.1.11	Thanks in advance...	St
1.2.1	Well you have not said what kind of raid you are using.	St
1.2.2	SATA,PEIDE or SCSI, so it is hard to say what you can do to change dirves.	St
1.2.3	I have put in a few links to give you an idea.	St
1.2.4	2 160bg drives would be about $170 plus all the hassle it would that take to set them up.	St
1.2.5	An externial 160gb about $160 and just plug it in.	St
1.2.6	Check the paper for sales with a rebate at BB,CC,FRY's, Microcenter,etc.	St
1.2.7	I have seem them with $50 or better rebates.	St
1.2.8	Also you by a 160gb HD $86 and an externial case for about $40 .	St
1.2.9	Your choice.	St
