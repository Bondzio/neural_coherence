Hi Bob, I have no goverment secrets, so the security level does not have to be very high.
It's more in case of theft, that I do not wish others to access my privat files.
(I'm a photographer, I store mainly digital pictures and video files on it, that are rather large in filesize.
That is why I do not wish to encrypt them, beacause it takes ages...) But I need to access them quickly, without any major time issue.
I wouldn't mind a 'digital key' solution, usually you get 2 keys and I'm not afraid of loss.
Something you would use like a pass through key with some password, that does not encrypt the whole file but just blocks its access.
Thanks, Sidney
