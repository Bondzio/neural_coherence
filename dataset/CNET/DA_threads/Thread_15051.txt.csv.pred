1.1.1	I have an HP e-pc 40 and , if it matters , I 'm running Windows XP Pro SP2 .	St
1.1.2	Some time ago , I tripped over the open disc drive door ( it 's a vertical operation ) and one of the trim guides came off .	St
1.1.3	As long as I 'm careful , I have had no problem , until today .	St
1.1.4	The last time I inserted a photo CD , the tray went in with a little bit of resistance .	St
1.1.5	Now , when I push the eject button , it clicks .	St
1.1.6	Something has become jammed .	St
1.1.7	I unplugged everything and tried to pry the door open , but without success .	St
1.1.8	I am not financially able to send this out to get the door released .	St
1.1.9	Does anyone have any simple instructions for someone who is not computer literate ?	Ques
1.1.10	Any help you can give would be gratefully accepted and appreciated .	Polite
1.1.11	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	Most CD drives have a small pin hole to manually eject the CD on the frt .	St
1.2.2	panel bezel .	St
1.2.3	Its there exactly for that reason .	St
1.2.4	Unfortunately some drives may not have it , but most do .	St
1.2.5	Using that pin hole place a straighten paper clip and push in with some care .	St
1.2.6	This will mechanically unleash the door .	St
1.2.7	Once all this is done , you should more carefully review what is making this stick , it will only happen again sooner or later .	St
1.2.8	There 's also the chance the track that drives the door open/close is cracked or broken , so take into acct .	St
1.2.9	if replacement becomes necessary as you ca n't repair it ( usually ) .	St
1.2.10	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	Thanks Willie - Sorry , but the pin in the hole will not un-jam the door .	St
1.3.2	Anyone else care to try ?	Ques
1.4.1	You have pin hole , correct .	St
1.4.2	OK , use that straighten paper clip and push to meet resistance .	St
1.4.3	Make sure you 're hitting the release mechanism , you may have to play it .	St
1.4.4	Make sure , system if OFF .	St
1.4.5	Otherwise , you will need to crack open case , dismount the CD drive .	St
1.4.6	Once in hand repeat the above steps .	St
1.4.7	If you do this .	St
1.4.8	correct any possible physical bezel problems .	St
1.4.9	Also , if yours does this , the bezel on the actual door itself can be removed , IF ! ! !	St
1.4.10	this is n't part of the fancy system case itself .	St
1.4.11	Once in hand , you 'll see what I mean .	St
1.4.12	The door cover/bezel can snap or unclip off .	St
1.4.13	If none of this works , then you have more than likely a broken track or physical damage , replace CD drive for continued hassle free operation .	St
1.4.14	The decal on the CD drive will denote what model # it is should you order from HP or other source .	St
1.4.15	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.5.1	in the 'normal attitude ' and then you try the eject or paper clip ?	Ques

1.6.1	Thank you to all who have tried to help .	St
1.6.2	Last night , a friend who is a mechanical engineer and used to rebuild jet engines and worked at TVA , called to thank me for something .	St
1.6.3	I happened to think maybe he could help .	St
1.6.4	He just left my house ( 3/15 @ 4pm ) and was able to disassemble the CD-ROM drive , get the door open , straighten the guides , and reassemble everything .	St
1.6.5	The drive loads and plays , the door opens and closes .	St
1.6.6	I am a happy woman .	St
1.6.7	Thanks again everyone .	St
