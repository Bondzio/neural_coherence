i was hoping to get a response from you.
right now i have been using the &quot;jazz&quot; setting on the equalizer.
it's the one that sounds the best when using the included ipod headphones.
i have been shopping around for &quot;in ear&quot; bud headphones, but do not know which ones to get.
any suggestions?
thanks again, chusito1975
