you left out what may be the vital clue.
always share a &quot;quoted&quot; error message without typographic errors.
since you had a trojan, it's possible that the os suffered damaged.
you will have to eject all parasites, run iefix and supply that error message.
if you use kazaa, imesh or such computer unfriendly programs, don't expect anything to ever fix it.
we call those machines &quot;kazaa'd.&quot; it's a codeword that means a lot.
light reading:   optimizing windows at  at the moment, i don't see a hardware issue.
i do see that some behaviour should be changed since it allowed the trojan on the machine.
find and help that user to not catch such, what can be devastating bugs.
