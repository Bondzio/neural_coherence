I really need help how to setup a network between a PC and a Mac (OSX, 10.3). Currently, I have a ethernet cable connecting these two machines together. On the PC side, I have files that I would like to transfer to the Mac. I right-clicked the folder I wanted to share, and made sure the sharing option is chosen in XP. On the Mac side, I typed in &quot;smb://my IP address/&lt;share&gt;&quot;, but I get a bad connection response. I would greatly appreciate it if anyone could please help me. Thanks!

I will not tell you how to do this since it's in the Samba web site. Bob
