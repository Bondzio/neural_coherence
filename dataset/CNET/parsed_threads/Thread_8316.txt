<s> I've been using a GemStar VESA/DPMS-compliant LCD monitor for a couple of years with a Win98 computer. </s>
<s> Now, with a new eMachine XP system, the monitor will not turn off (hibernate) when the PC shuts down. </s>
<s> Also, the panel buttons on the monitor (size, brightness, etc.) </s>
<s> won't respond when it's connected to this system. </s>
<s> Is this a driver problem with the computer? </s>
<s> What can I test to pin this down? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Since the PC is off, it's unlikely and driver on the PC is going to affect this. </s>
<s> A discussion in another newsgroup found their display had suffered a mild, but totally fatal failure. </s>
<s> Try it back on the 98 PC to see if it died. </s>
