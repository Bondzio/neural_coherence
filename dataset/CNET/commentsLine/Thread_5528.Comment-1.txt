i am researching equipment to set up my home network so that i can stream hd video and play ps3 games unline without lag.
does anyone have any recommendations on wireless routers?
i want to get the best of the best.
so far i am looking at buffalo airstation ac1300/n900 gigabit dual band wzr-d1800h.
also, i have been reading up on the usb 2.0 to 3.0 change.
is this transition worth it?
for storage i use two western digital 1 terabyte external hardrives.
with setting up this new network im also trying to see what other external hardrives might be better in terms up uploading speed,to support streaming.
basically i am looking to redo my entire network which consist of two wd external hardrive terabytes/ 2.0 usb and a linksys wireless n router from 2006. any recommendations would be great!
thanks
