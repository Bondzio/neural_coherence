<s> I have a Compaq Presario Intel-P4 with 256MB-RAM. </s>
<s> I have been using a CDwriter-***-DVD combo for several months. </s>
<s> I recently updated to XP-SP2 and also patched my system from WinUpdate site. </s>
<s> I also just updated Nero6-reloaded packages 1 and 3, without yahoo toolbar. </s>
<s> My CDwriter-***-DVD combo drive is suddenly refusing to open the drive, either from pressing the hardware switch on the drive, or right-clicking the drive in MyComputer and selecting eject. </s>
<s> I am only able to open the drive by inserting a pin in the front-hole of the drive. </s>
<s> Is this a potential hardware issue, or some software conflict (driver, dll, etc.)? </s>
<s> Thanks, </s>
<s> A bug in INCD would leave the door locked. </s>
<s> Not a XP issue but in what you added. </s>
<s> Uninstall INCD and delete the upperfilters, lowerfilters as noted http://support.microsoft.com/kb/270008/en-us I did not look up the article listing NERO. </s>
<s> You can do that but the fix is the same. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
