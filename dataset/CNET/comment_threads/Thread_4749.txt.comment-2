Well ATI and Nvidia, you name it as your mobo supports PCI-Express x16.
Assume you also have the 925XE Express Chipset.
The best are Nvidia 6800 Ultra PCIe, and the ATI 850 if you have the $$$.
Visit Tom's Hardware for what they can do http://graphics.tomshardware.com/graphic/20041222/index.html and Newegg.com for going prices.
