Thanks for your reply.
Im using a cable srvice provider.
I set the other computer ip settings the same as my original computer.
But this did not solve the problem because I had 2 network connections open, as soon as I disabled 1 connection I connected straight away.
If I setup the internet on another computer and I double click on iexplorer how can I stop it to go into setup mode ie configure LAN, configure Dial up etc.
