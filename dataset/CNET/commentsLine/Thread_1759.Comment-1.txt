hi all after a little help here, i have a msi k9n2gm motherboard one day while turning the system on via the power unit power switch at rear it crackled and then the system wouldn't turn on.
the light on the power unit wouldn't illuminate and the fans failed to start.
as such i was unable to test any of the systems.
note that the power unit was checked and confirmed faulty however when i connected the new one up there was no power light on the board.
power unit was good quality 'oz' one with several safeguards so im unsure where to go from here any ideas what to try next ?
im hoping the 9850 phenom quadcore black edition & 2 x 2gb 800mhz ddr2 ram are still alive !
!
