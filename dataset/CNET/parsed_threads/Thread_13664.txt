<s> I have a belking F5D7230-4 router. </s>
<s> Everytime comcast changes my ip address (they do it all the time), I lose my connection. </s>
<s> I have to unplug the router and replug to get it to work. </s>
<s> This is a real pain. </s>
<s> Belkin has had me reinstall firmware and even replaced the router. </s>
<s> same problem. </s>
<s> there must be a setting somewhere. </s>
<s> Does anyone have an idea about this? </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> I did not take the time to find the manual for your router. </s>
<s> If you want people to read that for you, please supply the link. </s>
<s> The setting I look for is &quot;lease time renewal&quot; for the WAN. </s>
<s> Example at http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r18994499-Wired-wrt350n-needs-reboot-every-24-hours-at-ip-renewal-time Again, this is all volunteer so I have to let you supply those links if you want me to crack open the manual. </s>

<s> thanks. </s>
<s> the link is: http://www.belkin.com/support/download/downloaddetails.asp?lang=1&download=994 </s>
<s> I have called tech support so many times and they don't ever seem to have any clue. </s>
<s> every once in a while, recycling the router doesn't work and I have to recycle both the router and the modem (which I also replaced thinking that could be the problem. </s>
<s> I had a motorola, now a lynksys.... same prob... but I think it is in the router. </s>
<s> No doubt here. </s>
<s> Lease times are up to your ISP to set. </s>
<s> If they blow it then such things happen. </s>
<s> Read your manual and look for any options for lease times. </s>
<s> Just noting I cured one with a simple timer box. </s>
<s> Those things that turn on/off lights on a time clock. </s>
<s> Since the user was never home or slept during the night we programmed it to power off then on the router during the night. </s>
<s> Fixed. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> As I do not own your router I can only offer ideas. </s>
<s> I see &quot;The Disconnect feature&quot; which if done proper will help out here. </s>
<s> You could set it to 8 hours or so and the last router I had with this would disconnect and then when a PC would need a connection the WAN DHCP would fire and the connection would be all fresh and ready. </s>
<s> Remember I can't know if you are running a torrent or such but ISPs are using IP changes at low hours to trip up the downloading crowd. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> Page 33 of the manual. </s>
<s> the disconnect feature seems to turn off the router if no activity...to save money if you are charged by the minute.. </s>
<s> I need it to reset... but not disconnect... </s>
<s> I may not have given you the right version of the manual... this is the correct link... sorry...this is for my new firmware.. http://www.belkin.com/support/article/?lid=en&pid=f5d7230-4&aid=5999&scid=0&fid=4207&fn=p74559-f_f5d7230-4v8xxx_manual.pdf </s>
<s> My lease time is set to &quot;forever&quot; Is this what you were talking about? </s>
<s> should I change this? </s>
<s> Thx </s>
<s> Think it over VERY CAREFULLY. </s>
<s> Some get confused over the WAN and LAN settings. </s>
<s> You claim above its an ISP changing the IP address so no where should we be tinkering with the LAN settings. </s>
<s> Also, you have to extend your thinking to &quot;how things work&quot; in regards to what a disconnect could do to help us fix this. </s>
<s> I know many that will insist the documentation suggest that this could or should be used to some specific issue but you asked for ideas so here they are. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> forgive me... </s>
<s> I am talking a bit over my head. </s>
<s> Yes, this does seem to be related to the IP address changing and the router not recognizing it... </s>
<s> It fexes by a manual recycle. </s>
<s> I am not sure 100% but the two seem to coincide. </s>
<s> When it happens, it affects my wired and wireless computers... so if lease refers to only the wireless...then I was confused. </s>
<s> any other suggestions on how to get my router to accept the ip address changes automatically or otherwise assess the problem? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> A timer to automatically reboot the router at a time you don't use the net. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Trying the WAN disconnect feature. </s>
<s> So no other ideas unless we change the router. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> an elegant solution... although it won't help in that period between ip change and reboot... but at least, if I am at a remote location for days, I will be able to get back in at some point... thx. </s>
