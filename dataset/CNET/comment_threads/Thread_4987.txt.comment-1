Hello, I am currently attempting to build a media center Server/PC.
About 4 years ago I knew my way around a computer and I could easily pick out hardware and put a computer together but now I am a little out of the loop, so any advise would be very helpful.
I am looking to build a system with 4-6 terabytes of storage (I have a LOT of dvds and I only want to rip them once so I intend to use raid to back it up).
I am going to hook this system up to my TV and I would like to have to ability to play games if I want.
I also am planning on using Windows Vista Home Premium with Media Center.
I have spent lots of time finding the right add-ons and making it work just the way I want it to.
So.....
If you have any suggestions on the hardware I should use to build my server I would be very grateful.
