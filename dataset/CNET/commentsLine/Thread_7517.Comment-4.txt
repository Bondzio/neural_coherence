windows 2000 service pack 4 may recognize that &quot;multimedia controller&quot; (your onboard sound).
if not it may not be supportable on 2000. if not, search for ac97 generic codecs/driver for windows 2000. you will also probably not get usb 2.0 speeds from your pc, win 2000 doesn't support it afaik.
xp didn't until sp1.
