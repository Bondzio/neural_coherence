<s> Hi there, Ever so often my computer would not boot. </s>
<s> When I press the on button the fans would start, the motherboard lights would go on and thats it- no beep, no spinning HDD. </s>
<s> And the light on my webcam woulb be constantly on. </s>
<s> When I press the power button for a few seconds the computer switches off but the webcam still shows the light. </s>
<s> However, when I unplug and plugin the power cable again-everything would boot up o.K. </s>
<s> without any alert messages. </s>
<s> How can I solve this problem? </s>
<s> The computer is home build. </s>
<s> The next link will have pictures and tells about this issue. </s>
<s> http://www.badcaps.net/ </s>
<s> First, the webcam scenerco isn't halepful. </s>
<s> If this is a USB type cam, its always powered by the system even when off, maybe you noticed that whn initial power is just turned off. </s>
<s> Anyways, USB devices with some telltale power LED remain lit even when powered-OFF. </s>
<s> Second, I find a decent psu is the best cure for alot of weird or touchy issues. </s>
<s> In no way does it fix everything but you got a stable powered system to proceed foward on. </s>
<s> All too often, the psu has been over-stressed from system needs or itself was too underpowered in wattage. </s>
<s> Cheap psu's aren't capable for the long haul and/or are misleading in thier wattage decal. </s>
<s> Its better to have a 600W cheap psu than a 500W one at least it may deliever longer even in less demanding systems before it fails. </s>
<s> Namebrand psu's are better to maintain power levels even if lower than cheap one at least they try to deliver stable power up to they fail, not be so wishy-washy. </s>
<s> That's why they cost more but are worth it. </s>
<s> I don't know you're power needs but at least get a 400W+ unit from the likes that: http:www.tomshardware.com suggests. </s>
<s> As for true power needs, try: http://www.jscustompcs.com/power_supply/ and take it from there. </s>
<s> Last, when you unplug/plug the AC cord, that's not really good. </s>
<s> The shock of that can be its own failure later, try the power ON/OFF switch, just press it in longer. </s>
<s> I wouldn't discount what Robert mentions in his post, if you have a 'bad caps' situation, the mtrbd. </s>
<s> has to be replaced for best cure. </s>
<s> Replacing caps can work, too often unexperienced solder work will do damage. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Thank you both for your replies. </s>
<s> Funny enough I never noticed that my webcam LED is on even with the computer off. </s>
<s> Over the last 10 years I have upgraded, build, semi-destroyed quite a few computers. </s>
<s> Most problems were selfinflicted jumpers, leads or similar. </s>
<s> My most recent kockup was to forget the ATX power cable and spent days to find the cause of a &quot;dead&quot; MB. </s>
<s> Therefore I think there is something more or less obvious or simple-again. </s>
<s> Those things are often difficult to spot because its so unbelievable obvious. </s>
<s> The article with the caps is interesting but is seems I never had a problem with that. </s>
<s> This problem happened with the same setup but two different MB's and PSU's. </s>
<s> I have currently a ASUS A8N-SLI Premium (heatpipe no cooling fan), Athlon 64 3400 with a large Copper Zalman cooler, 2 GB RAM, nVidia graphics card (passively cooled) and Wintek TV card. </s>
<s> The PSU is a 580W Hiper-very solid build. </s>
<s> The computer and many peripherals are attached to extension lead with surge protection. </s>
<s> It is that what is switched off to save electicity from all those stand-by power consumers. </s>
