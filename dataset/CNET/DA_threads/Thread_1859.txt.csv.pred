1.1.1	Hey everyone, newbie here.	St
1.1.2	It all started when i tried installing visual studio .net for a programming class i'm taking.	St
1.1.3	At first the installation was going smoothly but then it slowed way down.	St
1.1.4	It took 10 just to copy small files and the cd drive sounded like it was struggling.	St
1.1.5	After 3 hours it was only 25% done and still copying files.	St
1.1.6	So i stopped it and tried to just copy the cd image onto my computer.	St
1.1.7	The same thing happened.	St
1.1.8	It copied fast at first but then slowed down and then all of a sudden it just stopped copying and it looked like explorer quit.	St
1.1.9	I tried using a different ide cable then a different cd drive but the same thing happened so it might be the computer.	St
1.1.10	I wasn't sure where to post this but i hope someone can help.	St
1.2.1	Tip: If you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.	St
1.2.2	With just what you wrote, it appears the machine needs repair.	St
1.2.3	Was there anything else you can share about the machine, the OS, if the case cover off helps?	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Oh yea.	St
1.3.2	Well i'm using windows xp pro(2.2ghz pentium) with an asus p4s8x motherboard.	St
1.3.3	The drive is a 'visiontek' extasy 48x12x48x .	St
1.3.4	I took the case off and still doesn't work.	St
1.3.5	and a 300 watt power supply, i'm not sure if that helps.	St
1.4.1	Read http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/ and see if you have enough POWER to drive what's in the box.	St
1.4.2	Remember that 300 Watt PSU is not really 300.	St
1.4.3	Tom did a nice writeup about this at http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20021021/ in which out of 21 units, 9 didn't meet their own specification or just blew up.	St
1.4.4	By stressing the PSU, it degrades quickly and your issue is very common.	St
1.4.5	BUT the nutty part here is that unless you replace the PSU with a 450 or so Watt unit and re-test, you can't tell if that's it.	St
1.4.6	I also asked you to share what you could about the machine, which is rather slim, but did reveal the PSU issue.	St
1.4.7	Other items would have been nice, but I know people don't always want to reveal all.	St
1.4.8	Best of luck finding the bad hardware.	Polite
1.4.9	Bob	St
1.5.1	Thank you for the link.	St
1.5.2	I'm not sure if i should shell out the cash for a new psu and find it still not working.	St
1.5.3	And as for anything else about the machine, i didn't think anything else i could say would make a difference.	St
1.5.4	But now that i think that power might be an issue - I have 512mb ddr ram, a radeon 9000 video card, an 80 gig hard drive plus a 10gb additional hard drive, 3 case fans and that cd-r drive.	St
1.5.5	Could not enough power be the issue?	St
1.5.6	and is there more info my system that could help?	St
1.6.1	If you read the last supplied articles, you would not be asking if there is enough power.	St
1.6.2	I can state there isn't enough.	St
1.6.3	I can make a fairly safe bet the base machine didn't come with 512M RAM (it does take Watts!	St
1.6.4	), the second hard disk and such.	St
1.6.5	What can you eject?	St
1.6.6	That 10GB drive is 20 Watts or so and 256 M RAM isn't too bad compared to it not working.	St
1.6.7	Did you try that plus set the AGP RATE TO 1X?	St
1.6.8	Bob	St
