<s> what operating system are you getting? </s>
<s> I'd say wait until windows 7 come out, then you should have no compatibility problems. </s>
<s> Also, very nice machine, if that don't purr when you start it up I don't know what will. </s>
<s> This computer will be mainly used for 3dsMax, photoshoping, music production and gaming and I intend to use Windows 7 and bypass Vista completely [using XP now]. </s>
<s> I'll probably use XP until then as well. </s>
<s> Sometimes playing it safe can be ok. </s>
<s> I used Vista myself and I found no problems, but I'm not going to go on about Vista, this is the wrong forum for that. </s>
