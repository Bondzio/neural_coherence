i just bought a new pc with a sata hard drive, fine.
i have an ide hard drive that i wanted to put in to in as a second drive from my old pc.
is there compatibility issues that i don't of?
i tried for a good while to get it to see it but it won't.
anyone have a idea.
the sata drive doesn't connect to the traditional ide port, obviously, so i'm thinking that has something to do with it.
i don't know.
can anyone help?
