I don't record or do movies and games. I've got music, pictures, docs done in excel and word. I'm not sure what to get: -Portable or Non-portable -what size? 1Tb or less than 1Tb -what brand that is compatible to a Mac? I appreciate your recommendation or suggestion. Thanks, jake

I put a 32GB microSD card into this -&gt; http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41v%2Br9RhHmL._SL500_SS100_.jpg It's compatible with their Apple Intel Mac Pro. Bob
