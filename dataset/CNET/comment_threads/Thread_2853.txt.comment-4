If your card has DVI-I (or DVI-D) outputs, a single DVI-D-&gt;VGA (Or DVI-I-&gt;VGA) adapter is usually included in the box (unless it is &quot;White box&quot;, in which case, only the last driver the card manufacturer released will be included in the package, along with no adapters (or cables) other than the card itself.)
ATI has always been good about supplying all necessary cables and adapters in their retail packages.
&quot;White Box&quot; editions are horses of a different color.
You might get lucky, tho, if you went &quot;White box&quot; to save money.
Sometimes, all necessary adapters and cables are included with the card in a &quot;White Box&quot;.
