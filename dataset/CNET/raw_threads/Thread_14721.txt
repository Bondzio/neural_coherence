This wireless adaptor is N class with an ISM Maximum Frequency of 2.4Ghz, and a UNII Maximum Frequency of 5 Ghz. Does this mean it will work in the more stable and faster 5 Ghz band, or is it strictly 2.4Ghz? I have to buy a new router so for $100 more, I'll get one that does both bands, *simultaneously*, but if this adaptor can't run on 5Ghz, I'll save some money and just get a dual band. Thanks for any help!

I'd like to get an N router for the laptop and netbooks around the house and hopefully the TV can run on it too. The only thing that would need the G is the PS3.
