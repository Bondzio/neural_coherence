...is to go to the ms web site and put in the error code.
having done that, i found this at the following link:  .
it says &quot; this error is usually a driver issue and display adapter (video) driver is the most suspect though it could be others.
antivirus/antispyware/security programs, hardware (heat) and major software issues can also cause the error.
when you get to the driver section of the troubleshooter use my generic methods in the next message and then return to the troubleshooter if needed.
&quot; there're other write-ups on this error at:  &lt;span&gt;` &lt;span&gt; good luck.
