Musta been Gremlins.
I did nothing to the pc except turn it off for the night...I just turned it on for the first time and the DVD player is working despite being identified as a cd drive in My Computer.
THe misbehavior of the dvd drive persisted through many reboots, maybe it just needed a goodnights rest.
I wish everything would fix itself.
Bob- you mentioned that Adaptect software may be a problem.
I know you can't advertise here, but is there a program you would recommend?
