<s> I had problems with my hard drive and bought a new one. </s>
<s> I am up and running now and want to see if I can get any files off the old one. </s>
<s> I lost the old hd when doing a De-frag, it stopped responding at about 39 percent. </s>
<s> I waited for hours to see if it would finish and it didn't. </s>
<s> I tried to cancel the de-frag, I couldn't. </s>
<s> I had to re boot the computer and after that it wouldn't start up. </s>
<s> I tried the repair function with the XP Pro cd and it wouldn't work. </s>
<s> I tried to format the drive and it wouldn't work. </s>
<s> So my question is: Should I try to make it a slave drive and see if I can retrieve any files? </s>
<s> Is there a danger in trying to do this? </s>
<s> Thank you for your help, Stan </s>
<s> When faced with this and the owner won't send it to data recovery places I try... 1. </s>

<s> PC FILE INSPECTOR. </s>

<s> I plugged in the old drive and it seems to be all right. </s>
<s> I was wondering if I should delete the old windows folder? </s>
<s> Since the operating system is installed on my new drive I should probably get rid of the old stuff and it won;t be needed, right? </s>
<s> I downloaded the PC Inspector in case I need it to work on the old drive. </s>
