1.2.1	What are the other specifications of the machine ?	Ques
1.2.2	The most I could say would be a 8600GT .	St
1.2.3	Maybe a 8600GTS , but that might be pushing it .	St
1.2.4	~Ibrahim~	St
1.3.1	I have a 19 inch monitor , Intel Core 2 duo E6300 chip .	St
1.4.1	Not too many hard drives/optical drives ?	Ques
1.4.2	How much memory , by chance ?	Ques
1.4.3	Does n't effect power usage hardly any , but good to check , anyways .	St
1.4.4	I assume you 'll be using 1280x1024 or below as a standard resolution , right ?	Ques
1.4.5	I would say an 8600GTS would be the absolute maximum .	St
1.4.6	I 'm a wee bit afraid it actually might be too much .	St
1.4.7	The 8600GT is slower , yet draws less power .	St
1.4.8	Actually , scratch that .	St
1.4.9	The 8600GTS requires external power , which I 'm not sure that PSU includes .	St
1.4.10	Of course , you could get adapters and such , but I 'd feel safer with the 8600GT .	St
1.4.11	& quot ; It [ 8600GTS ] is designed to draw about 71 watts of power during operation .	St
1.4.12	The GeForce 8600 GT is significantly slower , but also uses significantly less power .	St
1.4.13	It is designed to consume 43 watts and ... & quot ; Check out this review : http : //tinyurl.com/2otuuj between both the cards .	St
1.4.14	~Ibrahim~ P.S .	St

1.5.2	Duo 2 Core chip , with nVidia 7300LE card , and 2 GB ram , 300 watt power supply .	St
1.5.3	I wonder if I could replace the video card with the following : nVidia 7800 or 7900 series .	St
1.5.4	thx	St
1.6.1	those cards are pushing the limits of the power supply .	St
1.6.2	I think most if not all of those cards require a external power supply , which means they draw more than the 75W that the slot itself can provide .	St
1.6.3	It is n't a particularly heavily taxed system , but 300W does n't seem like enough .	St
1.6.4	Most those cards require a 350W minimum .	St
1.6.5	I 'm really sorry ... What resolution are you running , per chance ?	Ques
1.6.6	The 7600GT is a great deal right now and the 8600GT is n't a bad card , either .	St
1.6.7	The 8600GTS is not too much slower than the 7800GT , but the 8600GT is .	St
1.6.8	Kind of confusing , but check out these charts : http : //www23.tomshardware.com/graphics_2007.html ? modelx=33 & model1=854 & model2=716 & chart=287 Unfortunately , they do n't include the 8600GT !	St
