when looking for a gaming pc for my son, i relied on the reviews from pc world to select cyperpower pc ( .
they have been horrible.
we purchased two pcs -- one for $3,500, one for over $5k.
the $5k pc arrived and wouldn't stay on for over 1 minute before overheating.
we went back and forth and finally were issued a full refund.
the cheaper pc ($3.5k) has been returned -- the motherboard went out after eight months.
customer service is non-existent.
you will be on hold for hours.
trying email is a joke.
after about a month of communications trying to honor the warranty on the motherboard, we did receive the pc back with a new motherboard.
today, we discovered that the pc won't turn on.
power is getting to the pc, but it won't start.
we've been on hold to technical support with cyperpower pc for hours.
do not purchase a pc from these people.
it is a joke.
it is a shame that pc world would have rated them so highly.
