To achieve the ''up to 108Mbps'' that you have seen advertised on a particular ''enhanced'' wireless-g network adapter, you need to have a router (or wireless access point) that is also ''enhanced.''
You also need to be in fairly close proximity to the router.
I took a look at the specifications for your router, and it looks to be a standard wireless-g router (up to 54Mbps).
An enhanced wireless-g network adapter will work with the router, but its connection speed will be limited to 54Mbps.
If you had a MIMO router, you would see a range and speed boost with either the standard or enhanced wireless-g adapter.
