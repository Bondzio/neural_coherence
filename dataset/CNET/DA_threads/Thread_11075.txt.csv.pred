1.1.1	i was lookin for an LGA 775 micro atx motherboard with sli .	St
1.1.2	i want a small for factor pc that is made spicificly gaming .	St
1.1.3	if i make it i will also need to find a micro atx psu that is 600+ watts ... i dont think they exist = ( .	St
1.1.4	my pc right now is : intel C2D e6600 , 250 , 160 gb hdd , corsair 2 gb ddr2 ram , corsair 620 watt modular psu with 8 phase processor plug , nvidia 7900gtx ima make a new pc soon wen dx 10 games come out ... my pc is pretty damn good right now but wen dx10 comes out it will lag .	St
1.1.5	i was thinkin about a shuttle pc kuz its small and easy to carry .	St
1.1.6	but if i cant make one ill go for full tower .	St
1.2.1	Any of the small form mtrbds .	St
1.2.2	usually are intended for & quot ; media center & quot ; type operation .	St
1.2.3	Any gaming concerns should really best served by sticking to typical mtrbd .	St
1.2.4	sizes and even those are smaller than older mtrbds .	St
1.2.5	You *may* find what fits your needs but overall just everything is going to become a factor or a need to deal .	St
1.2.6	There are 1000W PSUs and 600W can be had as well , just google aawy for them .	St
1.2.7	In this subject you should serious consider more on stable output rather than wattage alone .	St
1.2.8	Thus , a namebrand PSU will deliver more in the long run , unitl breached .	St
1.2.9	All in all , you should have a handle on specs and be crafty and handy as the case maybe .	St
1.2.10	If you put together items just from the shelf , the results are hit & miss , so beware .	St
1.2.11	As for Dx10 , its still in the air , and any current video maybe totally out of the picture , so until its release and firmer known issues , best to wait , unless you know better .	St
1.2.12	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	http : //us.shuttle.com/Gaming.aspx find one that meets your specs and then you can find what mobo and power supplies they 're using .	St
1.4.1	i just want a motherboard with sli that is micro atx for core 2	St
1.5.1	Stick with a case light-weight ( aluminum ) , well ventilated and easy access .	St
1.5.2	VAPCMD	St
1.6.1	shuttle 's p2-3700 and sdxi both supports 2 single-slot crossfire cards : http : //us.shuttle.com/P2_3700_5.aspx http : //us.shuttle.com/SDXi.aspx i do n't know what mobo is in these shuttles , but it 's probably the only microatx board that supports 2 pci-express video cards .	St
1.6.2	the only chipset to support sli and core2duo is the nvidia 600 series and all motherboards based on it are atx .	St
1.6.3	but one 8800gt is faster than any two video cards with the same total price .	St
1.6.4	so if you want a fast gamer in a microatx box , sli is n't a must-have feature .	St
