next to spotmau, these are the best two data recovery products on the market.
the fat32 program is great for sd cards.
i've recovered both photos and video.
even if you've reformatted the disk, you can still get most of your data back.
my android phone, a behold ii by samsung has erased by 4.0 gb micro sd card twice since i received the phone as a replacement for my dead sidekick lx from t-mobile.
after completely dying twice within one year, i didn't give them much of a choice.
the ntfs version is outstanding.
i recently had a volume error on my iomega 650 gb super max drive.
i ran the program and it took 22 hours to recover everything.
i also run a 400 gb iomega and 1 tb iomega super max and was able to spread the recovered data around so i didn't have to lose any of it.
i then reformatted the 650 gb drive and haven't had any problems since.
i only use iolo's system mechanic professional to defrag my drives.
xp sucks for degrag and don't try mcafee.
i also have an iomega 650 gb that won't turn on and have an ongoing issue with iomega about this.
your reply was great.
i recovered over 600,000 files that were on this disk that most people would have cried over when it wouldn't boot up.
itunes has also been blamed for a lot of disk drive errors and apple has been put under the gun to keep this issue to a bare minimum.
using xp's safely remove software app works great but you have to remember to select the actual drive and not the two supporting files or you'll get a 'can't stop drive' reply.
