1.1.6	I have cable that brings me the channels not an antenna .	St
1.1.7	The company says they have the digital cable switch covered	St
1.2.1	Answer to the 2nd question first : More than likely the cable companies that give you that answer are expecting to provide analog channels after the cutoff date or expect you to get a cable box .	St

1.2.3	You might ask your provider which way they plan on going , if they will tell you .	Sug
1.2.4	Now the other question .	St
