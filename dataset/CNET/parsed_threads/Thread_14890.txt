<s> I have a 512 micro i want to load some pics onto it, I did this once before and it worked fine i have lost the instructions on how to do it.help!!!!!!!!!! </s>
<s> the sandisk website has everything except how to use it </s>
<s> Assuming you're using Windows XP or ME, it's very simple. </s>
<s> Just plug it into an available USB port, double-click &quot;My Computer,&quot; and double-click on &quot;Flash Drive.&quot; You're now looking at the contents of the Sandisk Micro, which is probably nothing (empty). </s>
<s> Leaving that window open, browse for your pictures, select all of them (you can select multiple files at once by holding doen the crtl key while clicking each one), right-click on one of them, and select copy. </s>
<s> Go back to the window for the flash drive, right-click the empty (white) space, and select paste. </s>
<s> It may take a minute or two for the files to be copied to the drive, depending on the total size. </s>
<s> And that's it...you can now remove your flash drive, which has a copy of the pictures on it. </s>
<s> (If Micro has light on it, wait until it stops flashing/goes out.) </s>
<s> If you have an older operating system (ie Windows 98SE) , you'll first have to click here to download the drivers for the flash drive, which will allow it to work on your computer. </s>
<s> (Windows ME and XP already have those drivers installed, so that's not needed.) </s>
<s> Hope this helps, John </s>
<s> thanks........kevin </s>
