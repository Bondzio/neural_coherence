<s> I have a Samsung flatCRT monitor and occasionally I'll see orange lines going across the right side of the monitor. </s>
<s> After about 15 seconds all the lines disappear. </s>
<s> What's going on here? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Sounds like your tube is on the fritz--time to get a new monitor. </s>
<s> Could be your video card--have you been able to test it the monitor on another computer? </s>
<s> DESCRIBE SYMPTOMS: - Color? </s>
<s> (Deep orange, kind of faded, light rainbow) - Organized? </s>
<s> (straight lines, constant width/size)? </s>
<s> - Disorganized? </s>
<s> (random dots, segments, waves)? </s>
<s> - Traveling? </s>
<s> (moving from where to where)? </s>
<s> If it's a light rainbow, it could be a magnetic field from an electronic device deflecting electrons from the cathode ray gun (unshielded speakers commonly cause this). </s>
<s> However, there needs to be a dynamic magnetic field for this to occur intermittently, i.e., speaker power needs to be changing or speakers need to be moving. </s>
<s> I suppose a dark orange, but not too dark. </s>
<s> They are straight lines that go from the farmost right side to about half way. </s>
<s> I seem to notice them better when I open a window with a white background on the desktop. </s>
<s> I just bought the monitor about half a year ago. </s>
<s> I have an ATI Radeon 9600XT video card. </s>
<s> I just downloaded the latest Catalyst drivers. </s>
<s> I haven't changed any settings besides the TV out configuration. </s>
<s> Are there any changes I can make to fix the problem? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I'm using Firefox web browser I noticed there's an orange line across the folder tab. </s>
<s> I'm not sure if it's always been there but that's the same orange color I see going across the screen sometimes. </s>
<s> Also I see the orange when I open My Computer and hover over &quot;name&quot; &quot;type&quot; &quot;total size&quot;. </s>
<s> I don't know if that's supposed to happen but that's what I see. </s>
<s> Hmmm...it would be very informative to see if this phenomenon were repeated while connected to a different computer, then you could confidently rule out your computer. </s>
<s> The good thing is that the Samsung monitors I have seen have a 3 year warranty. </s>
<s> I'd check into it. </s>
<s> A shot in the dark: 1. </s>
<s> Check monitor cable for kinks, frays, loose at jack or base of monitor. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Check to see if there are any ATI card diagnostics in Catalyst or downloadable from mfg. </s>
<s> Seems like that orange underlining in My Computer is standard on XP. </s>
<s> Same with Firefox. </s>
<s> So must be the monitor? </s>
<s> But how, it's pretty new! </s>
<s> Just to clarify... Are you saying that the orange lines appear on the monitor when connected to computer one and to computer two? </s>
<s> If the orange appears while attached to each computer it is either the monitor's hardware or you need to install the latest driver from Samsung.com. </s>
<s> Try installing the latest driver. </s>
<s> At no particular time. </s>
<s> I'll try installing the latest drivers then. </s>
