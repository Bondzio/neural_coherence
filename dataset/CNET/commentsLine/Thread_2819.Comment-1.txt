i have windows xp.
i have fdisk'd the hard drive and reinstalled windows xp and at some random point after xp is installed.
i start getting errors on boot up and some programs won't open.
i believe it is a bad sector on the harddrive, but not sure how to fix it with xp.
it could also be bad ram.
i might have an old memory stick to swap out and try.
the processor is an intel p4 3.2ghz (preston chip) if that matters.
