<s> I must replace the hard drive in my IBM i1412 laptop. </s>
<s> The drive being replaced is marked &quot;ATA/IDE.&quot; Question: Must the replacement drive be ATA/IDE as well, or can it be ATA 3, or ATA 4, Ultra, etc.? </s>
<s> Finding a replacement drive described as simply ATA/IDE has been difficult. </s>
<s> Im unable to determine if my motherboard supports any of the variant interfaces. </s>
<s> &quot;or can it be ATA 3, or ATA 4, Ultra, etc.? </s>
<s> &quot; Yes. </s>
<s> ATA 4 drives work in ATA 3 and before controllers. </s>
<s> If they didn't... havoc would be thy name. </s>

<s> Thanks for your reply. </s>
<s> So, if the new drive is IDE plus ATA-XX, I'm in good shape? </s>
<s> Don </s>
<s> I thought I answered that. </s>
<s> If the seller doesn't, I'd shop elsewhere. </s>

<s> Bob, thanks very much for your input! </s>
