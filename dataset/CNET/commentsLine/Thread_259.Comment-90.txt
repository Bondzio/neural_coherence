partitions are similar to folders - except (remember the file cabinet drawers) they are truly separate.
you can format a partition and it does not have an effect on any other partition.
except - when u format the c:drive - all the shortcuts on your desktop go too.
so, you have to run each setup in the other partitions to reset shortcuts and reference points that some things have to have on c:.
some of the simpler programs only need to have the shortcut re done, or copied to the desktop.
to create a partition you just need to know how many gig's u need to have within a partiton.
i suggest 20g for the c: just in case you ever decide to go to vista.
it needs a lot of room.
i will be many years probably b4 i switch.
even if you only do 2 partitions - c: ,, and leave the rest open so its just like u now have, but data is more protected from changes to the c:.
xp install to a new blank drive will ask u if u want to partition the drive and you can tell it yes and enter 20g....simple simon.....said the pieman... of which i make a mean lemon merangue and apple.
lol give it all the thought u need.
like the saying goes - measure twice cut once.
