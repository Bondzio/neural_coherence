Any advice will be much appreciated. So first off, my setup: cable MODEM (22 mbit/s) - linksys EA3500 wi-fi gigabit ROUTER - in-wall cables - linksys SE2500 gigabit SWITCH Pc with gigabit ethernet is connected to ROUTER, while in another room I have ps3 and xbox hooked up to the SWITCH. I checked that PC and PS3 use gigabit, however simple data transer over the network yields 7,5 MB/s, which is somewhat below fast ethernet standard and nowhere near gigabit transfer speeds. Now I know that theoretical speeds are just a specification, but I had hoped I would get faster that the slower standard I had been on before. And at this speed I know it's not the hdd that is slowning things down as it would be at least 50-150 MB/s for sata drive. I am somehow not convinced that there isn't a bootleneck somewhere, but I can't pinpoint it. I did check all the status lights on switch and made sure the settings are right on any device that is configurable, I am unable however to check if router sends out gigabit signal. Any ideas?

If you are copying files with Windows Explorer to/from some other PC or NAS, such speeds you noted are normal even with a gigabit network. Why is well discussed so I'll suggest you try other speed tests. A common gaffe is home made cables. Folk always get the pairs wrong and some are so upset about that that they'll stamp their feet and insist the pairs are 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 5-6 and 7-8. Bob

I know it's not very scientific, but I couldn't find any software that would map the network and test speeds in my configuration. Funny thing is, ps3 media server running on my PC reports reaching speeds of 100 MB/s while streaming over the network. Not sure how reliable that is. So as you can see, I'm getting mixed signals here. I could theoritcally hook up my laptop on the far end of the network, but it doesn't support gigabit ethernet so I'm confused as how to test it all.

A DOCSIS 3 modem, Gigabit router and adapters, N wireless capability in laptop and CAT-6 cables for hardwire hook up (s) and maybe result change and of course bandwidth.Anything in the system (hardwire) that is not gigabit capable will default system back to 10/100

And yes, that was my bottleneck. I had forced ps3 to connect at gigabit speed and this time it said the ethernet cable is not connected, so in other words I won't be getting gigabit speeds without tearing my house apart to upgrade cabling. Or using a really long cable between the rooms, but that is far from neat. Thanks for your help, guys.
