1.1.1	Hi .	St
1.1.2	i just got this new quad core pc and after some research also decided to upgrade the vid card .	St
1.1.3	the card is huge and takes up to slots .	St
1.1.4	The manufacturer recommends a min .	St
1.1.5	power supply of 400w but the hp only comes with 300w .	St
1.1.6	my question is , do i really need to upgrade the power supply .	St
1.1.7	The pc isnt too overloaded with peripherals .	St
1.1.8	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	It 's not unlike driving most cars at 120MPH .	St
1.2.2	Yes , they will go that fast but wo n't last long .	St
1.2.3	Just a lesson I learned over the years .	St
1.2.4	Do n't skimp on the power supply area .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Yes a new PSU is required .	St
1.3.2	PSU=Power Supply Unit You should have ample wattage and enough amps on the +12v railes to get the most performance out of the GPU you have purchased .	St
1.3.3	It should play well with the Quad core you have bought though ... Look at the Corsair 620x series , or the Thermaltake 750w toughpowers , or maybe a 550W sunbeam psu if on a tighter budget .	St
1.3.4	Hope this helps !	St
