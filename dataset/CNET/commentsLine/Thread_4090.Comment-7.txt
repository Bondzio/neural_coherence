i purchased a fairly high end gaming system about six weeks ago from ironsides and i am impressed.
when doing research i came across this very post and told myself that if i am happy with the system i will come back here and put in my two cents.
i was a little nervous about purchasing the system from a fairly unknown company, so the first thing i did was contact customer service.
over the next week i corresponded with them via email and was impressed with the the quick and professional responses.
it took 8 days to receive the system and again i was impressed.
it was packed carefully and securely.
i realize this is my only 'post', but if you are looking for a system i would recommend ironside computers.
