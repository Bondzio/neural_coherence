but you need to say goodbye to agp and most stuff in your compaq.
keep the m-audio, x-fi, 250gb drive, and cd/dvd combo.
your quadro is based on geforce 4 gpus.
a geforce 7600 or radeon x1600 will run circles around it and they're only $120.
also, don't get a pentium-d... its obsolete tech.
a core2duo e4300 is the least you should consider.
here's a suggested self-build for a $1000 pc.
