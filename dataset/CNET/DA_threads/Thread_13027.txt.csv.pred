1.1.1	I have a doubt regarding RAID5 reorganization .	St
1.1.2	Suppose we have a RAID5 group consisting of 6 disks in a storage system .	St
1.1.3	Suppose , one disk ( call it d1 ) is unreachable i.e the disk component does not fail but some component ( for example , some network cable ) to reach that disk has failed .	St
1.1.4	Although the data in d1 is valid , the data in d1 is inaccessible .	St
1.1.5	In this scenario , will the reorganization will start or some field repairperson will try to repair/replace that component ?	Ques
1.1.6	Replacing a component seems to take less time than reorganization because reorganization is very costly with respect to time .	St
1.1.7	Also , data in d1 is valid ( so just repairing that component will make everything fine ) .	St
1.2.1	Adaptec did this for years .	St
1.2.2	The better systems send you an alert and then you hot swap in the new drive and it 's very automatic .	St
1.2.3	HOWEVER you see folk today try to do this with software and it 's not that good .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	you mean & quot ; reorganization & quot ; .	St
1.3.2	But , replacing the failed component by a new one seems to be more easy when the disk component i.e data is valid .	St
1.3.3	Because RAID5 reorganization may take long time and there is chance of experiencing latent-sector error during reorganization .	St
1.4.1	All this occurs on-the-fly and with no loss of access .	St
1.4.2	I can only guess you are using some PC Software RAID ?	Ques
