Thanks for the input.. Im not really looking to upgrade the videocard... the fx5900 still runs fairly well.
A nice sound card isnt really something i want to throw down 100 bucks for either considering i havnt had one before and have been just fine.
I have a nice dual fan 400w power supply so i wont need one of those.
