bum ide cable, port or drives.
it's possible you didn't follow some ide jumper or cable rules but that's easy enough for you to check on the internet.
such as blue to the board and black to the drive and cable select for 80 conductor cables.
i find many are still wrestling with the ide basics.
at least there is plenty of free content to work with now.
another item worth noting is a few builders that have some xp from their hp machine and learn that doesn't work.
sorry but if there is a fault it looks like a bum ide part.
why not find a sata drive?
