1. try to log into the network without entering the proper wep password.
if you can't then it is working.
note: if you logged in at least one time already and the wireless connection utility saved the password in the properties of a ''preferred network,'' the you will not be prompted for the password until you change the password on the router or ''remove'' the preferred neteork from your list.
check the router manual to see if it can provide the added protection of some sort of mac filtering.
2. router firewall should automatically be on.
read more about this in the router manual.
be safer--use the router firewall and at most one software firewall on each computer.
my rule is always to have firewall, antivirus, and more than one antispyware program on each computer at all times.
