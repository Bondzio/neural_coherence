Forget the DOS boot disk.
Just tap F8 about once a second after you power up.
Select the command prompt.
After that stops.
You should have a C: prompt.
Tap printscreen and tell what happens.
If nothing, then you may have a dead printer, printer port or cable.
I'll leave you to read your printer manual for the printer self test.
Tell what happens.
No manual?
Go to epson.com and fetch it.
