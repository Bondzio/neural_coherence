we had an expensive 3 year-old hp printer/scanner/copier/fax.
couldn't find a driver so we called hp support.
the guy's attitude was clearly that they can't be bothered to support existing products more than two years old, so go buy a new printer.
we bought a canon and have been very pleased with it's quality and lower ink cost than hp.
that has saved us a lot of money.
now, we've upgraded to windows 7 64-bit and guess what?
canon had new drivers available for us, no problem.
i wonder how many customers hp has blown off with their attitude?
