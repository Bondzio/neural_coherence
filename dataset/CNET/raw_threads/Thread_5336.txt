I bought a new computer yesterday, and thus had to buy a video capture card (ATI Wonder 650) that is compatible with Vista. I have a $300 outdoor security camera that I plug into the capture cards composite input and have a program I bought that records upon motion detection, and can stream video to a web site (Active Webcam is the program). Everything works fine until I use the TV Tuner on the same card. The cam image then changes to the TV Chanel I am watching. But if I close the cam program and open it again, it changes the TV Tuner channel to display the cam feed. So I can only view one or the other. This never happened before. I don't know what to do. I think it is to do with the way the card sends video to the programs. In the webcam software, it is using Direct Show, the Video Device is set to &quot;ATI AVStream Anolog Capture&quot; and the Video Source is &quot;Composite 1&quot; (from the availible option of TV Tuner, Composite 1, and S-Video [the three inputs from the card]). Any ideas?

Again, it's that simple so I decline to write a tutorial about this. &quot;This never happened before.&quot; Since you changed machines and video capture card you may have to explore redeploying the machine that worked ok.
