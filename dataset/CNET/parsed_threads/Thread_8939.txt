<s> I have noticed that the audio cuts out randomly. </s>
<s> I will be playing songs on winamp and all of a sudden when the next song comes up it doesn't play. </s>
<s> If I hit the play button it doesn't move. </s>
<s> All the audio then does not work for my computer until I shutdown and reboot. </s>
<s> It is not just winamp either, which i thought at first. </s>
<s> If i use Media player, or another program, or even if i am just surfing the web. </s>
<s> I have checked the volume control and it is still set to high volume. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>

<s> I have a dell dimension 2400. </s>
<s> XP home edition. </s>
<s> I don't have anything altered to the default factory settings. </s>
<s> The situation I described is all I know, I have never been able to pin point the audio problem to a specific occurrence. </s>
<s> I never have noticed after i do something it happens, it just seems to occur every so often. </s>
<s> Would it be a driver for the OS for audio? </s>
<s> or a driver for winamp/media player? </s>
<s> Another driver. </s>
<s> Many think they can use a PC as delivered without worry about drivers. </s>
<s> This is sadly not true. </s>
<s> Since you revealed the make and model, here are the 2 drivers I would install. </s>
<s> But first, if you used your service like this... http://support.dell.com/support/downloads/driverslist.aspx?c=us&l=en&s=gen&ServiceTag=9BWV351&SystemID=DIM_PNT_P4_CEL_2400&os=WW1&osl=en&catid=&impid= You would see what they offer. </s>
<s> Notice how some items are in the year 2007? </s>
<s> Are you keeping up? </s>
<s> See item 1 at http://downloadcenter.intel.com/filter_results.aspx?strTypes=all&ProductID=816&OSFullName=Windows*+XP+Home+Edition&lang=eng&strOSs=45&submit=Go%21 Since the Dimension 2400 offered three different audio cards I can't offer which driver I'd use until you tell me a bit more. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I have the same problem and the same machine. </s>
<s> Used to work and now I have to log off and log on to play audio. </s>
<s> Sometimes I can go a long time and other times I can only play one video or sometimes I can't even play one and no sound. </s>
