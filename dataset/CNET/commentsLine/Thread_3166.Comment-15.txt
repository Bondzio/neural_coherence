methinks you are overdue for a drive replacement!
drives do wear out.
newer drives have s.m.a.r.t technology that monitors the drive's condition and can report problems.
routines can check the surface and block bad sectors, moving the data to a good sector, however, this not only reduces the drives capacity, but causes fragmentation problems.
with the cost of today's drives plummeting, your best bet is to spring for a new (probably faster, quieter and cooler) drive and save the old one as a backup, or for test purposes.
i've seen current 1 tb (yes, that's terabyte!)
drives for $75 or less.
smaller drives for much less!
good luck - but don't count on luck!
