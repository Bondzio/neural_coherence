<s> My computer, which I built approx 1 year ago, is suddenly displaying the speed of my AMD Athlon 1.2GHZ as 900MHZ. </s>
<s> How can this be corrected ?? </s>
<s> Thanks, Bob </s>
<s> Verify in your bios setting, the proper cpu setting. </s>
<s> usually the multipler is off and thus reflects a lower cpu rating, look at the FSB, etc. </s>
<s> save it upon exit. </s>
<s> You may have to reboot to be 100% it kept the new setting. </s>
<s> This is the 1st area to look into. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> the multiplier is fixed and even if the mobo offers settings the CPU will simply ignore them. </s>
<s> What has likely happened is that you had a &quot;bad&quot; shutdown as interpreted by your mobo logic so it reset the memory bus speed to the lowest setting as a protective measure. </s>
<s> You should be able to simply go into the BIOS and set the memory bus speed back to the desired setting. </s>
<s> Various BIOS's have different ways of referring to this setting. </s>
<s> Some call it FSB, for DDR memory they may memtion the basic speed or the doubled speed [example 133 or 266, for PC 2700 memory]. </s>
