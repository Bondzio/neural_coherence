1.1.1	Hello , I want to change the SSID on all my APs without it affecting the connected devices .	St
1.1.2	The users should possible not be affected with the connecttion to the wifi network .	St
1.1.3	How can I go about it ?	Ques
1.2.1	Since changing the SSID drops the network connection you ca n't push out a change to the machines .	St
1.2.2	Let 's say no .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	If you actually CHANGE it you will drop .	St
1.3.2	Some commercial AP have the ability to add multiple SSID to the same vlan .	St
1.3.3	You could then run in parallel for a while and tell your uses to use the new one and then remove the old .	Sug
1.3.4	A couple of brands of AP actually have a feature that allows you to not allow new sessions to a SSID but leave it active .	St
1.4.1	IF and that 's a big IF I could have multiple SSID I could have my IT staff push out the change to the new SSID and when enough time has passed ( months ? )	Sug
1.4.2	then we could drop the old SSID .	St
1.4.3	Great idea .	Polite
