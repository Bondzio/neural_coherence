<s> My budget is $1,500 dollars including the case. </s>

<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> So you have a monitor/keyboard/mouse/speakers/printer, etc... That means, you need the following for a pc case psu os memory motherboard hard drive processor arctic silver optical drive fans That's it. </s>
<s> For case, choose what catches your eye. </s>
<s> PSU, look at the +12V rail and wattage. </s>
<s> OS-Either Windows Home or Pro. </s>
<s> Linux maybe? </s>
<s> Memory-on a $1500 budget, 1GB at least Motherboard- PCi-express slot is a must Hard Drive-250GB SATA, look for deals on newegg Processor-AMD? </s>
<s> Intel? </s>
<s> Dual-Cores? </s>
<s> Arctic SIlver 5 thermal compound is required imho. </s>
<s> optical drive- NEC 3540-A DVD+_RW BUrner-$39 at newegg.com Fans- Most come with case, so may not be necessary. </s>
<s> NEWEGG.com is a good website and offers decent prices. </s>

<s> to consider getting a good video card which means avoid ATi's current offerings (Radeon X series models 300-850 lack SM3.0 and FP32, which means they lack features that are good to have, and Radeon X 1300-1800 draw a ton of power and cost a fortune as their just being launched) nVidia's GeForce 6800 and 7800 series are EXCELLENT choices for a processor i'd consider AMD's Athlon64 1GB of dual channel DDR 400 a decent motherboard from DFI or MSI good PSU from Antec, Enermax, or OCZ 200GB-400GB hard drive, depending on what you want to store (honestly 80GB is fine, 2 80GB's is what i've got and it's more than I need) PCIe is a good idea, and beyond that i'm gonna say WindowsXP Home Edition or Pro, Linux won't support as many games/will require more work to get the few games it does support working i'd say just go onto newegg.com, and look around arctic silver isn't required, but it's a really good idea find a parts configuration that you think works post it back and i'd be happy to comment, and i'm sure so would damasta </s>
<s> go for a 64 bit processor- and not the lowest one offered either. </s>
<s> (Not the most recent either. </s>
<s> Get a mid-level athlon.) </s>
<s> Get at least 1 gig of ddram, or rambus. </s>
<s> More than 1 cant hurt and will definitely help. </s>
<s> Dont see why you'd need more than 60-80 gig hard drive, really. </s>
<s> How many games can you load on already in one shot? </s>
<s> If you'll be doing heavy duty gaming you'll want a case with a good power supply and plenty of room for fans. </s>
<s> Make sure your motherboard has room to expand. </s>
<s> Make sure it has at least 4-6 USB slots. </s>
<s> There is nothing more irritating then unplugging something so you'll have room for another USB device. </s>
<s> USB and firewire is the future- make sure you have them. </s>
