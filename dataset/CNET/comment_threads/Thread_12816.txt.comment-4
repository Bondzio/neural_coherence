Remember that your transfer speeds will also depend on the specs on the external hard drive.
Firewire and USB 2.0 are pretty close.
If you have a Firewire port on your laptop/desktop go for it.
USB ports can be finicky and there are reports of some laptops and desktops having USB port failure for no apparent reason.
That happened to my wife's laptop last year.
We got her a new machine, but luckily the old one HAD a Firewire port, too, so we were able to get her files off the old machine and onto an external drive that way.
