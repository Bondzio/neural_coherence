1.1.1	Ok I am trying to create a wired network between two computers in the same room .	St
1.1.2	Can I use the Dlink Des-1105 port switch to do this ?	Ques
1.1.3	it has an input port and 4 other ports to plug ethernet cables into .	St
1.1.4	I tried doing this and only 1 of the computers was working .	St
1.2.1	You will need the right ethernet cables to get them electrically connected .	St
1.2.2	More importantly , you need to do some work at each PC to get them talking .	St
1.2.3	You 'll need to deal with TCP/IP protocol which requires a unique address for each PC .	St
1.2.4	You 'll need to configure a network name and names for the PCs .	St
1.2.5	You 'll need to set up shares on each if you want to move files back and forth .	St
1.2.6	What have you done so far in this regard ?	Ques
1.3.1	These switches are made to connect to a router that hands out DHCP TCP/IP addresses .	St
1.3.2	That being said , you could still use them as long as you manually set TCP/IP addresses on each computer manually that are on the same subnet .	St
