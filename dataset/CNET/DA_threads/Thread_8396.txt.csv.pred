1.1.1	I currently own a HP media center that came with a HP vs19b 19 & quot ; ( Quite good ) that have a problem now .	St
1.1.2	Problem : When I woke up one morning I always turn my monitor first and my computer second and go off to brush my teeth .	St
1.1.3	Coming back , the monitor was still off it seems .	St
1.1.4	I press the power button many times until I realized that the monitor is possibly broke .	St
1.1.5	If I try to power on my monitor it will either do two things : After a few minutes without power when I press the power button it will make the kind of sound I always hear when its turn on but nothing else Or After a few minutes and pressing the power button I will create that sound and may turn the blue light for a few seconds then gone again .	St
1.1.6	I know my graphic card is n't the problem since it does n't matter if its plugged in or not and I do n't feel like buying another 19 & quot ; ( 200 $ ) .	St
1.1.7	I used my old computer 's monitor on this computer to manage with my daily stuff .	St
1.1.8	If you can help in any way , thanks .	Polite
1.1.9	Wolf	St
1.2.1	I 've had similar happen with monitors having both analog and digital inputs .	St
1.2.2	For some reason they fix on the wrong port and there 's no signal .	St
1.2.3	I would need to use the input select button to make it go to the right port .	St
1.3.1	I have the same monitor and I am having the same problem , did you ever find a way to fix it ?	Ques
1.4.1	Inside there was something burn , not sure what ( I havent looking much about LCD technology ) .	St
1.4.2	Thats what the repair man said and of course it will cost more than the monitor to repair so I just used my old 15 & quot ; and replace my other computer with my cousin 's monitor .	St
1.4.3	Also , he mention it was cause by electricity problems so my parents bought surge arrest .	St
1.4.4	Over all , I suggest you buy another monitor and a surge protector ( The power strip I had sucked ) .	St
1.5.1	http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-7590_102-0.html ? forumID=67 & threadID=62739 & messageID=744233 is a discussion about a model that was sold in the millions .	St
1.5.2	As such I ca n't say it was a defect but given the sheer number of the units fielded it 's population shows a failure that is common in that line .	St
1.5.3	And it 's sadly true that repairs are exceeding replacement costs .	St
1.5.4	I doubt it was some AC power surge .	St
1.5.5	Bob	St
1.6.1	I 've had this PC for less than 3 years .	St
1.6.2	It cost me way too much money to have to replace it after only a few years !	St
1.6.3	I have had to purchase more than 3 & quot ; replacement & quot ; monitors for PCs in the past 15 years and I am tired of it .	St
1.6.4	There needs to be something to protect us as consumers .	St
1.6.5	When you purchase a product , you have to consider the replacment cost in with the original purchase price just so you know you 're getting a good enough deal .	St
1.6.6	If not , then do n't buy .	St
1.6.7	It 's always after the warranty wears off .	St
1.6.8	It 's wrong and if enough people have this problem with the same monitor they should take care of replacing them .	St
1.6.9	People need to keep this in mind before they buy an HP product .	St
1.6.10	It 's like we 're all Beta testing products after purchasing them for full price and someone should consumers when companies like HP do this .	St
1.7.1	The word & quot ; protect & quot ; was left out of the last sentence .	St
1.7.2	It was meant to imply , & quot ; someone should protect consumers who are being ripped off by HP & quot ; .	St
1.7.3	It 's a prevalent problem and I would be willing to participate in a class action suit against HP .	St
1.8.1	I have purchased many of these monitors for repairs .	St
1.8.2	And just like always its faulty capacitors inside the monitor on the power control circuit .	St
1.8.3	The repair guy is just trying to take an advantage of you .	St
1.8.4	As for HP these is high failure piece and some pc 's experience this as well .	St
1.8.5	The older 325ST model pc had capacitors that would exblode on the motherboard .	St
1.8.6	& quot ; note explode by the tops bursting open and the insulators inside busting outwards & quot ; This can be a cheap fix for you at radio shack for 6 $ .	St
1.8.7	If you have a soldering iron it will only take 30 min to fix .	St
1.9.1	replace 1000mf/10V=3pieces with 1000/16V and your HP good work !	St
1.10.1	After all this time I still have n't found anyone who can do this soltering for me , but I thank you for your response .	St
1.10.2	If and when it is successful , or not , I 'll be sure to come back here and update .	St

1.16.1	aptivaa12-I have been reading all these posts trying to figure this thing out .	St
1.16.2	I have taken the monitor apart-and ca n't really make heads or tails of what I 'm seeing .	St
1.16.3	( I am NOT smart in electronics etc ) If you do fix monitors-how much would you charge and where do I send it ?	Ques
1.16.4	Oh ?	Ques
1.16.5	Since I have it opened can I send only the boards ?	Ques
1.16.6	Would that be ok ?	Ques
1.16.7	Thank you for your help !	St
1.17.1	Take as many pics as you can of all boards and the monitor while you have it apart .	St
1.17.2	Mainly the boards off the metal casing both sides of the pcb .	St
1.17.3	Send to aptivaa12 @ yahoo.com I 'll edit the photo to show you what caps are bad .	St
1.17.4	This will prevent you from sending me a board that may not be damaged as well and save yourself some postage .	St
1.17.5	But please make them as clear as possible .	Sug
1.17.6	Thank You	St
1.18.1	Okay !	St
1.18.2	Thanks	Polite

1.19.2	Thanks !	St
1.19.3	Now I 'm curious as to how many other electronic devices ( i.e .	St
1.19.4	LCD TVs ) suffer from similar problems .	St
1.19.5	I suppose now I 'll be tearing apart any junk ones I happen upon for a while !	St
