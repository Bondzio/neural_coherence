1.1.1	I have the Safecom SWBR-5400 found [URL=&quot; http://www.dealtime.co.uk/xPF-eBuyer-Ebuyer-54mbps-Wireless-Cable-DSL-WI-FI-Broadband-Router-4-port-802-11G&quot;]here [/URL] which works fine wired to my PC & Xbox 360.	St
1.1.2	But I'm getting a new laptop soon & I'm going to have a problem as the router never came with an antenna as I bought it off a mate.	St
1.1.3	The router's downstairs & my laptop will be upstairs & I've already tried my mates laptop & it obviously had weak signal without the antenna.	St
1.1.4	So I'm hoping to buy a new antenna for it but can't find a site anywhere that sells antennas specifically for this model.	St
1.1.5	[URL=&quot; http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&sspagename=ADME%3AL%3ARTQ%3AUK%3A1&viewitem=&item=250115496517&rd=1&quot;]This [/URL] antenna seems pretty cheap but I'm unsure as to whether my router has a SMA male connection.	St
1.1.6	Can anyone help?	Ques
1.1.7	If I can't find one that fits it, it'll mean I'll have to fork out another 30-40 on a new router when I know this one works fine bar the antenna problem.	St
1.2.1	Some radios burn out if the antenna is not attached.	St
