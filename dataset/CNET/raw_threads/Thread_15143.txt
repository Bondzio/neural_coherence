I recently fitted an Nvidea GS7800 card which offers a maximum screen display of 1600 x 1200 (I currently have my 19&quot; CRT monitor set to 1280 x 960, which suits my purposes. Games seem to offer a choice of resolution settings, but invariably have their own native setting which imposes itself, which is fine with my CRT. However, I fancy replacing my 19&quot; CRT with a - you guessed it! - larger LCD monitor.... From googling around, I see that there are 21 and 22-inch LCD monitors which seem very attractive, but depending on their format (i.e. how widescreen they are) they max out at either 1600 x 1200 (perfect for my needs?) or 1680 x 1050 ( a more widescreen format?). Am I confined to monitors with 1600 x 1200 or can I still consider 1680 x 1050 with my current graphics card? Also, is it likely that my games will find their own resolution whatever the monitor size? I am not too clear about how LCD technology works under these conditions and would appreciate any advice. Incidentally, how important is a really fast response time of, say 2ms, when it comes to gaming? Will 5ms not do just as well? I understand that measuring systems vary a lot, even within one make of monitor. A number of points here, I know, but if they could be addressed individually or together that would be much appreciated (in fact if anyone can recommend a monitor that would work with my card then great!)

I took the simple MATH approach but it appears the makers lie about the numbers.

As far as response time I could not see any difference with the 5ms response on the Viewsonic and the 2ms on the Samsung that I used for 2 weeks while the Viewsonic was being delevered. I set the resolution at 1680 X 1050 and it looks great in very day use and also games. The only thing I will be doing to improve gaming is installing a bigger power supply and a better, newer graphics card as that seems to be the key with the newer direct 10X games
