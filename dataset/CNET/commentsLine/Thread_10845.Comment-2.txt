get a floppy controller card which maybe hard to find.
i suggest,  and check for them or google for other sources.
you will need to disable trhe hp on-board fd controller via the bios.
check the manual in order to do that.
that should do it, just verify what you're getting when buying the card.
under under hp setup under normal situations the fd itself must be addressed like fd1 or fd2, that maybe a problem if not done by fd cabling.
if you have the fd in hard, it should have a twist & split of cable in order to manually address the fd drives.
otherwise, you may have the &quot;single&quot; straight fd cable whcih doesn't do anything in addressing and that's no biggee today as dual fds aren't the norm any more.
