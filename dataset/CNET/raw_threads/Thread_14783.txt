I have just purchased a INFINITY USB UNLIMITED card reader writer. Can anyone advise me on how to either LIRE/CLONE/COPY/WRITE satcard, sim and other.it is impossible to do anything with the software that is infunltdsetup 2.81: it did indicate &quot;protection&quot;. what to do? I would want advice, thanks

I would be guessing that a &quot;satcard&quot; are those cards to allow satellite TV access. If you check the forum policies you see such a discussion beyond buying such a card and using it as stipulated is not allowed here. Bob
