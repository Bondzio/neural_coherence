<s> Hello - I'm in desperate need of some help. </s>
<s> We have a very small office network. </s>
<s> All PC's are less than 3 years old (6 pc's total), and all are running Windows XP Pro. </s>
<s> We have all the neccesary hardware (NIC's, router, switch, modem, etc.). </s>
<s> Two of the six pc's have very slow network reaction time. </s>
<s> Internet (we have broadband), transferring files, everything. </s>
<s> I can't figure out why this is. </s>
<s> I've replaced the two Cat5 cables with Cat6 cables and the problem still persists. </s>
<s> I've tried switching ports on the workgroup switch and still nothing. </s>
<s> I've also tried replacing the router, switch, and modem. </s>
<s> Nothing solves this problem. </s>
<s> Is there anything else I can try? </s>
<s> Any ideas?? </s>
<s> Thanks a lot for any help. </s>

<s> Please make sure you have current antivirus software on all computers, and you might consider antispyware software too. </s>
<s> Hope Bob's links provide the answer for you though. </s>
