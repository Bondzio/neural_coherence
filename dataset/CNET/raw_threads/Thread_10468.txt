I have a Sony DVD burner, a Sony CD-RW burner, and a Pioneer DVR-108 dual layer DVD burner. You might try PCWorld.com and look at their reviews. They're pretty straight forward and don't pull punches. Good luck, Click here to see the CNet faces, learn a little about internet connections, and download free software.

They work well in any computer and have good software with the burners. They were also one of the first if not the first to have the ability to burn at 8X +. Those are just facts not personal opinions. You will find many who have personal opinions but offer little info at these forums so be careful. dragonlen

I have heard good reports, and I've also had reports of problems from people who knew their business. Just like Wayne obviously likes Sony, many knowledgeable people postively hate them. Get various &quot;hand on&quot; opinions and make your own choice. chuck

Though more expensive, the issue with DVD burners are basically how good are the software and how many discs will be compatible with it. As far as I know, plextor works with a bunch of them. if you always use good disks (ritek) you can buy a cheaper burner. I use Lite-on and ritek disc. Never go wrong. you can check out WhoSave.com storage section, maybe something good is on sale.
