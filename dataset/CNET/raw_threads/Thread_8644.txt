When i download a file, the per second speed starts off high in the 150kbps/second range, then every time falls down to about 30kbpa/second or less. When using the net with a non wireless connection it is fine. called customer support and they &quot;tried&quot; to help but I'm still getting the problem. Is the D-Link defective? Any help would be appreciated. thanx.

Could easilly be the program you are using to dl, or the laptop internet settings, try using a diffent dl program other than ie, like firefox for example, see if you get the same perfomance drop. PS I have a dl link wireless router as well, and use a wireless usb plugin on my desktop to get on the net, and my connection usually starts at about 250 and then usually drops to 150 or lower depending where i am downloading from. Are you sure you are the only one on your network, and that no one else us eating bandwidth (like a neighbor), check that out, and if your network is not encrypted I would recogmend that as well. hope this helps some
