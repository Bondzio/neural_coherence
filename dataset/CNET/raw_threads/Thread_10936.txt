2951	0	310146	2868177	NR	Neskyre	9/27/08 4:39 AM	1.22249034E12	I switched my registry keys but I can't switch back.	My CTRL key was not working the last time on my old keyboard, so I did the registry change by doing this by swapping CTRL with Caps Lock : Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlKeyboard Layout]; &quot;Scancode Map&quot;=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,03,00,00,00,3A,00,1D,00,1D,00,3A,00,00,00,00,00 But now I can't switch it back, I bought a new computer and I have to press the keys the other way round [Caps Lock is CTRL and vice versa] I also changed the registry by adding this : Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlKeyboard Layout]; It still didn't work. So I need urgent help. I'm currently using a Logitech NewTouch 100 now. ~Brandon
