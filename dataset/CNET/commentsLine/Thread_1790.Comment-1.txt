i have a win98se laptop using a belkin wireless g pc card.
i have noticed that in the win98 control panel, network connections, the entry for the belkin adaptor (not the tcp/ip entry), under advanced there seems to be alot of options (mode, power, etc.)
that are not described in the documentation or appear to be accessible via the belkin utility.
i assume these are windows os properties.
what do these functions do, how are they accessible, if accessible would they do anything and is there any documentation?
thanks, harvey
