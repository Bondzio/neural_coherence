Then I use a Cat5 cable from the router to my Mac in another room. That gets me Internet and Network to the PC. I can't seem to get the printer in the other room working from the Mac. I have a Dell PC(OS- XP)and Mac G5 (OSX 3.9)

1740	2	357758	3120095	3120078	EduardoDN	9/5/09 7:28 AM	1.25213568E12	That USB	Do I need to find the address for the printer? It seems like so many choices on the Mac. It will cost about how much to switch over to wireless? I don't think I can afford right now.

Makes for a much more stable network and allows both machines to operate independently of each other and without the requirement to have the PC always on. P
