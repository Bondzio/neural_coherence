here are my system specs: intel q9450 dx48bt2 motherboard (bios at 1782) 2 x 2gb of kingston ram (1.5v each) (ddr3 1333mhz) msi rx3870-t2d512e oc video card v120 (driver at 8.43) 700 watt thermaltake power supply sound blaster x-fi xtremegamer sound card nothing has been touched from factory settings and i have no intention of doing so.
(i originally had 4x 1gb sticks of ocz ram - ddr3 1333 mhz.
i these sticks operating at 1.82v) my computer trouble is that when i boot the computer for the first time after a long period of being off, the computer hangs.
it seems to happen a minute after the computer fully boots.
this necessitates a press of the reset button.
after i press the reset button, the computer reboots and everything is ok; no more freezing issue.
i went through ocz's site and i checked their memory configurator.
the dx48bt2 motherboard isn't listed at all on their site so i ordered the kingston ram.
even after ordering the kingston ram i still get the hang on the cold boot issue.
i have also posted this issue on the ocz boards before i ordered the ram.
it was suggested that i don't have a large enough power supply.
here is a link to that thread:  could this hanging on a cold boot be due to the fact that i don't have a large enough capacity on my power supply?
if not, what might the other possibilities be?
thanks for your assistance
