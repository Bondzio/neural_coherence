<s> Sorry if my question is stupid, but I currently use a cable modem and am interested in networking my other two computers in order to have access to the internet on all 3. </s>
<s> I called my provider and they made it sound as simple as buying a wirless router and hooking it up to my cable modem and that that is all I have to do. </s>
<s> My question is, Is it that simple? </s>
<s> Do I only have to by a router and install it to have access for the other two? </s>
<s> Any help you could offer would be great!!!! </s>
<s> Thanks, Steve </s>
<s> Millions use the router setup. </s>
<s> It's now a commodity or common solution. </s>
<s> It's a little untrue you have to do nothing but hook it up. </s>
<s> You may have to update the router's firmware or even configure it. </s>

<s> First of all what you should do is check with your ISP to see if they allow sharing like you want to do. </s>
<s> I've heard that some providers can detect if you are doing &quot;sharing&quot;, and try to prevent you, or want charge you more. </s>
<s> Other ISPs don't care if you &quot;share&quot; (or at least they don't bother to monitor such activity). </s>
<s> If your ISP will just let you &quot;share away&quot;, a &quot;wireless router&quot; might be what you need, but not necessarily. </s>
<s> If your PCs are located all over your house, yes, that might be adviseable, but then you'd need &quot;wireless client&quot; devices for your PCs, too. </s>
<s> However, if they are all in the same room, you would not need a wireless one. </s>
<s> Setting up a home network is fairly straightforward. </s>
<s> I am taking a class in wireless networking. </s>
<s> Last night, during the &quot;lab session&quot; part of the class we were supposed to setup an &quot;Access Point&quot;. </s>
<s> The one I was given was brand new, never been opened. </s>
<s> It was a Linksys product, but I don't remember the model. </s>
<s> It was an &quot;all-in-one&quot; product which included a router, wireless Access Point, and ethernet switch. </s>
<s> I had never seen, nor laid hands on such a device before. </s>
<s> I just took it out of the box, and started hooking it up. </s>
<s> I thought the instructions left a bit to be desired, but I just messed around with the device. </s>
<s> I think the net result, though, was that I made no changes to it from the default configuration. </s>
<s> What had to be configured was the PCs. </s>
<s> I had two PCs that had previously been configured with wireless NIC cards, and two PCs that did not have wireless NICs. </s>
<s> I won't bother you with the rest of the details for now, but I will say it was pretty easy. </s>
<s> In about an hour and a half I had all of 4 PCs going out onto the Internet. </s>
<s> If I were hooking up a home network for the first time, I'm sure I would feel much more comfortable if I could see one that had already been set up. </s>
<s> If you have children, perhaps they have friends who have home networks. </s>
<s> Perhaps one of them might permit you to visit them, and see how it was done. </s>
<s> One more thing. </s>
<s> If you &quot;go wireless&quot;, be sure to read up a bit on wireless security. </s>
<s> Enter &quot;tips on wireless security&quot; into a search engine, like GOOGLE, and you'll quickly find plenty of good reads. </s>
<s> At the very least, enable &quot;WEP&quot;. </s>
<s> Depending of the vendor, they might call it 64-bit or 128-bit encryption, or something else in their configurations. </s>
<s> There are plenty of folks who just love to drive around neighborhoods with wireless laptops in their cars, and look for houses who have setup wireless networks. </s>
<s> And, if you have left the security features disabled, they will just help themselves to your network. </s>
<s> The security features can be hacked, but at least if you've enabled them, you stand a chance that the &quot;war-driving&quot; hacker, will just drive down a few houses or blocks, and help themselves to a network that is completely open. </s>
