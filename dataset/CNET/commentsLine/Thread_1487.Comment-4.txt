thanks that makes sense.
i did end up calling hp and epson.
epson said no, but the hp guy told me that their officejet 8500aplus can print pdf's and maybe doc files.
he said you can email doc files to the printer.
i don't know, but it makes sense about the fonts and other rendering issues.
if i get one and try it i'll update this thread with the results.
thanks guys (or girls).
