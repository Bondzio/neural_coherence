OK to recap I purchased a Pioneer DVR-109 DVD burner and for a time it worked perfectly in my machine and I was able to do everything with it. All of a sudden in one night though it started playing up in that it would start burning a disk and get almost all the way through then it would come to a stop and say &quot;could not perform end track&quot; and that there was a communications error with the drive. I took the drive out of my machine and replaced it with my old CD burner and that worked perfectly and so far has not played up. As a precaution I took my DVD burner to the place I purchased it they sent it off to be looked at and it came back with a report saying they had no trouble with it.. I put it back into my machine and it still played up. So now I'm about to throw the drive through the window.... Can anyone suggest anything, maybe that I have not tried.

Google for upper/lower filters cure and see if that helps(long shot). Next, if the DVD burner still misbehaves take it back and get another burner replacement, not the same one. Explain, if the burner worked for awhile(30days or less) but longer than that(90days?), it really hasn't provided good service and should be replaced. However, I found many a burner not last longer than 1yr. if used on a regular basis. Make sure any s/w issues are resolved if found. Check with Pioneer support for any possible &quot;firmware&quot; updates. If you haven't already check with Ms for possible updates as well, especially for older XP releases. Last, try another DVD media brand, use a good known namebrand for best results, in fact try that right off the bat. tada -----Willy
