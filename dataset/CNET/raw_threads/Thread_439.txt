I have 2 Western Digital Raptors, SATA, that I've been running in RAID0 (1 as the boot drive, C:, and the other as a data drive, D:). Recently, my motherboard died and I need to get the required data off the drives. My wife's computer is my old PC, which is a P4S8X and has a FastTrack RAID controller. My question is, how do I attach one of my SATA drives to her already-running computer and have it be visible in Windows so I can copy/paste files I need? I do not want to format the drive. I added the drive to the computer, and it was detected by the FastTrack controller and it wants me to setup an array for the drive. What should I do? If I setup an array for the drive, will it be visible in BIOS & Windows, or do I need to do more? Will this erase the data? Thanks!

Believe you should do that first ...then connect the drives ... believe you'll need to connect both drives to make up the RAID and retrieve your data.

This means the two drives are joined as one continuous drive and would only have one drive letter. As such, they cannot operate independently. Is it possible you meant they were on RAID capable channels on the MB but configured as basic SATA? In this case, you normally can just connect them to an SATA channel of another PC and see if it's recognized and readable. Don't try to boot from a bootable partition, however if your OS is XP. It won't work.
