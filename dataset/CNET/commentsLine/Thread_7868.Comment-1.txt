i have this old mb and i'm not sure if it is working.
i am wondering - if i remove everything that is attached to it (hdd, ram, cpu) but the power supply and i turn it on, what will happen?
is it going to turn on in some way?
will it show something on the display?
is it going to be enough to see if it is working or not?
