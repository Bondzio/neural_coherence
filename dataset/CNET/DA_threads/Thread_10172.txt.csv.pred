1.1.2	I have an old 100G HD that I 've been using as a secondary drive for a longggg time that is in FAT32 .	St

1.5.1	Before any utility will work , the hard drive controller MUST have a driver that supports FAT32 drives larger than 137GB ( 48-bit LBA ) .	St
1.5.2	SOLUTION : 1 .	St
1.5.3	You need to get controller 's name from the ''SCSI and RAID controllers '' in the Device Manager .	St
1.5.4	2 .	St
1.5.5	Go to the controller mfg 's website to download a Windows XP driver that supports hard drives & gt ; 137GB .	St
1.5.6	Since you mentioned Seagate , I am assuming you have a Seagate drive .	St
1.5.7	Seagate describes the problem HERE and also provides links to some controller mfg 's at the bottom of the page .	St
1.5.8	If you need help , just post the names of your hard drive controllers in this thread .	St

1.15.2	.	St
1.16.1	Did you actually try the program ?	Ques
1.16.2	It would be pretty useless if it only formatted the & quot ; main & quot ; drive , i.e .	St
1.16.3	the one with your OS on it .	St
1.16.4	It will format any drive you follow the instructions for and map a drive letter to .	St
1.17.1	for HDs larger than 137GB , u need at least SP2+ for winXP .	St
1.17.2	For win2k , i think it 's SP3+ To format a HD brand new w/o windows , as u install windows , u 'll be asked to choose a file system .	St
1.17.3	Choose the file system u want .	St
