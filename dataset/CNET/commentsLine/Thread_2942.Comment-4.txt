i do it.
your printer program will give you a number of low ink warnings and it will eventually ask you to replace the cartridge or if you choose, you may override the safeguards and keep printing.
i haven't done it for a while, but you end up depressing one of the buttons on the machine to enable the override.
the final prompt will instruct you.
just be careful that you periodically inspect the cartridge levels so you don't run out and damage the nozzles/print head.
