xp, even with sp3 does not have native sata support so this is a nightmare of drivers, issues and arcane information for most users.
unless you have a geek guru friend i suggest you forget sata and get another ide drive.
and for the same bucks you usually can get some usb external dvdrw and get a bonus that you can use it on many other pcs.
