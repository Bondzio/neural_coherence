We have a linksys WRT54GS, with a desktop connected to it via cable and my laptop running on wireless. Things were ok until a few weeks ago, when my connection started dropping more often (but it would immediately connect by itself a few seconds later). But now, I cant even connect to the internet. Heres the detail: At first, I couldnt even connect to the router, although my laptop would pick up the signal. The router is set to have a network key (WPA or WPA II), so I played around with the connection properties and changed the network authentication to OPEN from SHARED and left data encryption to WEP. Now this time I can connect to the router, access the routers setting and access the other computer, but cant browse the net. Just for ease, Ive disabled the routers security mode now. Im running Windows XP Security Update 2, and I have a Intel Wireless Network card 802.11 b/g. Did I mention HOW ANNOYING this is? I also had another linksys, the WRT54G, and that thing died on me too a while ago. And yes, I have the latest firmware. Thanks everyone.

The pc worked fine, it was just the laptop that couldn't suft despite being connected to the router. For SOME reason, I was playing around with the connection settings, and even though i didn't change anything at the end, when i disconnected the router and the modem for 30 seconds (I HAD DONE THIS BEFORE AT LEAST A BIZZILLION TIMES) it started working again. I'm guessing there was a problem with my IP????

From there you will be able to have the router through this site, just follow the directions. Or call the linksys tech support at 1-800-326-7114.

Calling linksys about this annoying problem was a waste of time and effort. I have A Dell Demension 3000 and a linksys WRT54GS.

Maybe set up a &quot;trusted&quot; range of IP addresses in that firewall? - or - Is it a network printer that connects directly to the router or via a print server?

It will tell you how stong the signal is and it will tell you all of the other networks within range of your wireless card. It tells you the channel they are using and whether they are encrypted or not. If you are lucky, you will only see devices on channel 1, 6 or 11. Anybody using channels other than this are rookies and need some education on wireless. This is a more scientific approach to choosing a random channel.
