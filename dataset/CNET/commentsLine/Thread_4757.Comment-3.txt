thank you for your reply... when i first had the second line installed i had both 2 wires connected to a netgear dual band router, guessing that is where i made my mistake... both 2 wires are completely separate now, but still having the dropped connection problem.
just had the second line installed about 2 months ago and all wiring was fine then, but guess things could have changed in that time period.
