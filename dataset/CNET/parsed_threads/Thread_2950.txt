<s> I've a problem with the installation of the ps-admin software on WinXp. </s>
<s> The setup do not start. </s>
<s> it does... nothing </s>
<s> Defective products deserve to be returned. </s>
<s> i found on cnet official site the ps-admin software and i've the same problem. </s>
<s> it seems to be incompatible with WinXp (mine is with Service Pack 1) </s>
<s> Today, the market is XP. </s>
<s> If the product is not ready for XP, return it. </s>
<s> In closing, this is not CNET the hardware company. </s>
