<s> i had a hard time with viruses. </s>
<s> so i decided to format C: and reinstall XP.i am using two IDE hards of 40 gig and 160 gig. </s>
<s> i have xp's on both the drives but i am working with the xp on 40 hard disk. </s>
<s> so i booted with an xp CD, although i was supposed to format only the partition C: unfortunately i had formatted the whole 40 gb. </s>
<s> that way i lost all the data on my 40. </s>
<s> (because there it didnt show me the separate partitions of disks) after installing the xp when i open the &quot;my computer&quot; i realised that the volumes on my 160 is not visible there. </s>
<s> so i opened disk mgt in computer mgt wondering there i saw both the disks(40 and 160). </s>
<s> but for the 160 it was visible only a one partition and there it shows, that partiton takes the whole capacity of the disk. </s>
<s> but i had 3 partitions on my 160. my all the important data are on my 160. i suppose the data is still there since i didnt format that. </s>
<s> so can anyone please help me to access the partitions on my 160. thanks in advance. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> XP doesn't support over 127GB drives until SP1 is installed (or later SP versions.) </s>
<s> I've seen your story before and the owner panics and before they install SP2 or such they panic and begin using data recovery programs which only screw up the drive further. </s>
<s> Stay calm and install the service packs. </s>
