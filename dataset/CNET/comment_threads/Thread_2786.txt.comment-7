ASUS is a good brand.
They have a reputation in making computer hardware such as motherboards, and they are one of the best at what they do.
They now make computers, so I have nothing but high expectations from their computers as well.
They know their stuff.
I would choose an ASUS computer over HP/Compaq, Dell, Acer.
They are all garbage.
HP and Dell are so bad!
