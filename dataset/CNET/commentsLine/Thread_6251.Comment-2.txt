1. many of the hard disk testing utilities are data destructive.
2. are you using a damage resistant file system.
if it's fat32 or such, loss is not unheard of.
3. are you using a more reliable os like linux?
4. why couldn't you reveal enough information so the forum can take a guess at a proper sized power supply?
5.
8 drives at about 20 watts each is 160 watts.
since most power supplies fib about capacity, i'd fit something about 4 times that value plus beyond reason ventilation.
6. ide cables will be an issue in such an electrically noisy box.
i would only accept 80 conductor ide cables if these are ide.
