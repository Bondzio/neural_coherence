1.1.1	I'm looking for an external hard drive for an early Intel iMac for general backup duties-nothing special.	St
1.1.2	Any recommendations&gt; Thanks, Tony	St
1.2.1	There are a number of alternatives available which will work happily with your machine.	St
1.2.2	You should be looking for an external drive with a Firewire (IEE1394) connection, rather than a USB one.	St
1.2.3	Firewire behaves well with the Mac and a Firewire drive is also capable of booting the Mac.	St
1.2.4	La Cie make a reasonable external but it is also possible to &quot;make your own&quot; Using a Firewire enclosure and an &quot;off the shelf&quot; ATA hard drive, you can be up and running with a large capacity external for a lot less than an already built one.	St
1.2.5	www.macsales.com have a selection of enclosures and your local BestBuy/Circuit City have regular sales offers for large drives.	St
1.2.6	Those two places also sell external drives but most of them are USB devices.	St
1.2.7	P	St
