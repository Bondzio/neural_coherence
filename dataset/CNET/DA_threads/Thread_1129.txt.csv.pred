1.1.1	I keep having a problem where i turn on my computer but have nothing display on the screen .	St
1.1.2	I can hear that windows is starting up but the monitor will show & quot ; no signal & quot ; ( or something of the sort ) .	St
1.1.3	Ive found that holding the button in till it turns of and then turning it back on usually , eventually , will allow it to start normally but obviously this is not something i wish to continue .	St
1.1.4	I know that it is not the monitor as i have recently changed it and the problem was still there with my old monitor .	St
1.1.5	I assume that it may be the graphics , however i only purchased the graphics card this year and i can remember that it did used to happen sometimes with my old graphics card .	St
1.1.6	Any help with this problem would be greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.1.7	Specs CPU : AMD Athlon 64 3000+ RAM : 2 GB GFX : Nvidia Geforce 6800 GS 256mb PSU : 480 Watts VDU : Philips 17 & quot ; LCD 170C6FS Thanks again with any help	St
1.2.1	When i went onto the graphics to check drivers i saw that one had a little exclamation mark in a yellow circle , this was next to & quot ; Nvidia VDM video capture ( universal ) .	St
1.2.2	Has this anything to do with it at all ?	Ques
1.2.3	Thanks	Polite
1.3.1	Ok , by your own history this problem has appear with Old and new monitors ( so it 's not those ) Old and new graphics cards ( so it 's not those ) What remains is the answer .	St
1.3.2	Try a different graphics lead first , as this is easiest to change and check .	St
1.3.3	After that you get into the more problematic to pinpoint possibilities .	St
1.3.4	It may be that your power supply is not up to the task .	St
1.3.5	As graphics cards advance they also tend to need more power , it might be an indicator that your old graphics only suffered minor & quot ; no display & quot ; problems , but your new more power hungry one suffers greatly .	St
1.3.6	As a test , with power off , unplug as many devices ( such as CD-ROM drives , and case fans , which with the case off are n't really needed for testing ) as possible , to give as much start up juice to the graphics card as possible , and see if this tips it over to indicate a lack of power to be the culprit .	St
1.3.7	After that , plug all those drives and case fans ( never EVER unplug the CPU fan ! )	St
1.3.8	back in , and then consider further options .	St
1.3.9	Good luck , GeeBee .	Polite
