Who is currently making the LCD displays which use AMAT technology and where can an end user buy one of those machines online today ?
Or are you saying that these LCD displays are not currently available but will be in the near future, perhaps February of 2009 which you seem to be implying ?
If these be proportional LCD displays, where both the width and height increase the size of the display, I am interested in purchasing such an LCD monitor for the system I intend to build.
Of course this is predicated on these LCD displays being as reasonably priced as the current wide screen monitors.
