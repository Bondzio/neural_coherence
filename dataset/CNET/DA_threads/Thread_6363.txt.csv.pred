1.1.1	I am considering buying a refurbished video card from newegg .	St
1.1.2	I buy their new stuff all the time with great results .	St
1.1.3	Does anybody have any good or bad experiences with their refurbished products ?	Ques
1.2.1	I never buy refurbished .	St
1.2.2	Though , if it does n't work , newegg will send another one , so if you 're using newegg and you 're buying say a very expensive part , and you can get a refurbished for a huge difference , go for it .	St

1.3.1	sometimes newegg has video cards for sale , especially Radeon 9500 , 9700 and 9800 series , that have been returned since they did n't overclock high enough and the owner wanted a newer or different card ... but what is the card your considering ?	Ques
1.4.1	In either a 128 or 256 MB .	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	Good To know I still know whats what .	St
1.7.1	the 9800Pro wo n't do certain games , such as HL2 or FarCry due to it 's limited SM abilities http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16814145107 ^ that will beat the 9800 AND will run any game you want	St
1.8.1	The age old question .	St
1.8.2	9800PRO ( New or Refurb ) or X800 ( if i can find one in AGP , and refurb ) , or the 6600GT ( New or Refurb ) ?	Ques
1.9.1	the 9800 pro is knocked out by both , the x800 will out perform the 6600gt , in most/all games except doom 3. check out tomshardware , they have a lot of gpu comparisons , or google it .	St
1.9.2	but both the 6600gt and the x800 will do fine for bf2 .	St
1.9.3	i have heard about low fps for the 6600gt , but it is a demanding game .	St
1.9.4	konny	St
