even though hardware makers said they were not going to create drivers for either 32 or 64 bit vista, when you install the peripheral, vista went out on the internet and found drivers that worked just fine with them.
i even installed a 10 year old laser printer that had a regular printer input.
i was able to get an adapter cable that converted from a printer cable 50 pin output to usb.
i was surprised to find that vista actually installed a printer for this old war horse of a printer.
it also installed a printer than i though that i wasn't going to be able to use to work with both vista and windows 7. both of those programs are very user friendly for installing printers and other peripherals that you might think would work with these new peripherals.
