I appreciate your wiilingness to look at the documentation and I really feel stupid asking this question, but i can't find anywhere in this forum thread where I can attach a pdf file of the manual.
I can reply with the instructions in the message body, but the chapter on the RAID controller is 17 pages long.
I have searched the FAQs and every other place on this site, but cannot find where I can upload the pdf.
Please forgive my ignorance, but this is the first forum where I've encountered this problem.
Thanks, jeff
