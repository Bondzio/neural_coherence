<s> I have 6 computers I need networked together (hard wired), and I also want a wireless connection available for guests. </s>
<s> I have the internet connection coming out of the wall (not sure from where.) </s>
<s> I'm running internet into router, 5 servers into switch, switch into router, router into &quot;main&quot; computer. </s>
<s> On the &quot;main&quot; computer I can see all the servers, but cannot connect to the internet. </s>
<s> I'm using Windows 7, and when diagnosing the problem it says the internet from the wall is not reaching the router. </s>
<s> When I hard wire the wall connection directly to the main computer I have full internet. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Am I just connecting something out of place? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I can't start on this. </s>
<s> It's possible you have some work to do with setting the machine IP info or you left the firewall on in the router. </s>
