It's a new Video Card with not 128MB RAM but with 512MB RAM. Does this make any difference? Well you know for future games. Also crossfire only works if you have two video cards and two pci-e slots right, well and a mobo that can handle crossfire right? http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/VisionTek-Xtasy-Radeon-X1300-Video-Card-X1300512PCIE-/sem/rpsm/oid/143571/catOid/-13043/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do

I would suspect that the person could give you further basis for his reasons. I know nothing about tvideo card performance, but have read many threads where a card with a lower amount of memory performed better than one with more memory. There are other factors.

Also the other variable is the clock speed of the memory. However, think of the interface as the bottleneck. You can have a 900MHz memory clock running on a 64-bit interface, it's going to be slow. Ultimately look at the memory interface, 128-bit is fine for lower-end cards. A note on memory size. Most games right now do not use more than 128MB, and therefore 512MB would be considered unnessary at this point. For the future we are seeing games that have more shaders and dynamic lighting for more realism. And alot of games are also depend heavily on the CPU. I would still buy the Sapphire X1600Pro, this card can run with a 6600GT while the vanilla X1300 is performing near a 6200. A 7800GT is overkill for ZooTycoon games. And you will definitely have to upgrade the powersupply to alteast 400watts. A vanilla X1300 may run on a 300watt, but the X1300Pro wants a 350watt or greater. Also the quality of the PSU is also important as well. Make sure you have 12V rails... What computer are you buying?

Consider these benchmarks: http://www.hothardware.com/viewarticle.aspx?page=13&articleid=734&cid=2 http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,1875353,00.asp The x1300 is slower than a 6600gt and x1600xt yet those cards are only $140 (compared to the $200 price for the x1300). To quote ExtremeTech: &quot;We're starting to see a pattern: ATI's new low-end card is slower than all the other cards in its price range.&quot; Every card I mentioned in my previous post will PERFORM MUCH BETTER than the x1300 and cost less than $200. Many articles have proven that 512MB offers no benefit except at super-high resolutions (1600x1200 and higher) with 8xAA. The x1300 cannot support those resolutions. At 800x600 and 1024x768 (which is really all that card can do smoothly), 128MB is adequate and 256MB is more than enough. 512MB is just marketing gimmick on this card... like putting a spoiler on Kia. It may look cool, but it won't make it go any faster!
