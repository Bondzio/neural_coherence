I installed updates for windows xp. I now get a disk failure. I do not have my original disk. I was hoping to be able to switch to Ubuntu as I have a disk for that. Is there a way to get to the safe mode when it shows &quot;DISK BOOT FAILURE, INSERT SYSTEM DISK AND PRESS ENTER&quot;. Then can I boot from my DVD drive from the Ubuntu disk? I have everything backed up on an external hard drive so if I lose some stuff on the way no worries. I hate microsoft with every ounce of my being. Mikep http://fyifixit.com/

And you can use Ubuntu to examine your hard drive too. You probably just need to refresh the MBR (Master Boot Record) on the hard drive unless the drive has totally crapped out. Ubuntu will tell you whether that's the case. Good luck.
