1.1.1	Hi , I 'm going to build my first PC this summer/fall .	St
1.1.2	I have a list of components , but I do n't have a case and power supply .	St
1.1.3	Here 's the list ; does anyone have ideas for a case and power supply ?	Ques
1.1.4	Motherboard : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.asp ? Submit=Suggested & Description=13-152 CPU : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16819103535 Video Card : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16814102601 RAM : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16820145505 Sound Card : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16829102179 DVD Burner/Drive http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16827131264 Hard Drive ( I own this already ; that 's why I did n't include it in the cost ) : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16822144122	Ques
1.2.1	Floppy Drive/ Media Card Reader : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16821104104	Ques
1.3.1	I took a look at specs are new computer build and you may need to chg motherboard as graphics slot is agp and video card you want to get is pci-e x16 and you need a pci-e x16 slot which the motherboard does n't have .	St
1.4.1	And that motherboard was socket 754 ; the CPU is a socket 939 .	St
1.4.2	I was looking at the chaintech VNF4 , but now newegg does n't have it .	St
1.4.3	So here 's another that I found ; good ?	Ques
1.4.4	Oh yeah ; what about the case and power supply ?	Ques
1.4.5	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16813128286	Ques
1.5.1	Only built one but am happy with Antec case and power supply .	St
1.6.1	You want a spacious , but not overlarge case .	St
1.6.2	Do you want something flashy , or more elegant or a mix ?	Ques
1.6.3	For a PSU , though it may be just a tad overkill : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16817153029 This is my personal fav .	St
1.6.4	for a case with a power supply http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16811144004 But you would be a little better off buying each component seperately as combos usually yield lower quality in one part or another .	St
1.6.5	This is my favorite case : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16811133133 But these are just my choices .	Ques
1.6.6	Try this page for some good case ideas : http : //www.newegg.com/ProductSort/SubCategory.asp ? SubCategory=7 For the better quality cases , do n't get a PSU , side windows always look cool , look for with CPU ducts on side or back , make sure there is enough room for expansion and current parts , and make sure it suits you !	St
1.6.7	On the motherboard , so are you going to AGP or using the x800 on PCI-e ?	Ques
1.6.8	Do they make a x800 , of that card , in AGP ?	Ques
1.6.9	Wanting to clarify : IDE is P ATA , correct ?	Ques
1.6.10	This is a wicked deal , if IDE is actually P ATA : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16813131530R Just my $ .02 ~Ibrahim~	St
1.7.1	First of all , thanks for all the advice .	Polite
1.7.2	I agree with you about that power supply , but it 's a little overkill , and it 's out of my budget .	St
1.7.3	Likewise with the case ( which I just love , btw . )	St
1.7.4	I would like a quality case and 500W PSU , but I ca n't spend too much on them ( I still need to buy windows and a monitor ) .	St
1.7.5	About the motherboard : I posted the wrong link ; check my previous post for the right one ( with a PCIe slot ; I would n't got AGP , and the other motherboard was a socket 754 . )	St
1.7.6	About the hard drive : My mom ( I 'm 14 ) purchased it to put in an old dell 4400 .	St
1.7.7	But it did n't work , and now we it 's just lying around .	St
1.7.8	I 'm rather confused about the hard drives , though .	St
1.7.9	I know that SATA/II is the newest interface , and that IDE is older .	St
1.7.10	Will the hard drive work with the motherboard from my other post ?	Ques
1.7.11	Once again , thank you for all your help .	Polite
1.7.12	-Nate	St
1.8.1	The 939 socket board you listed does n't have a PCI X16 slot .	St
1.8.2	Do believe the hard drive will work on that board .	St
1.8.3	Just check the boards specs , PATA IDE/ATA 100/ xx/xx .	St
1.8.4	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16813131569 Scroll down on that page for the specs .	St
1.8.5	Tom	St
1.9.1	Well , I can only find two motherboards , the first one with the 754 and the other was AGP 4x/8x .	St
1.9.2	Did I miss one ?	Ques
1.9.3	( Lol , that case will be my case for my Dream PC , when and how I can make up $ 5,000 is still a mystery to me , though ) Yeah , most all motherboards I found all support SATA and IDE/PATA .	St
1.9.4	So , the Hard drive that was supposed to go in the Dell will work .	St
1.9.5	That actually clears up a matter I was earlier confused about in another post .	St
1.9.6	I would say this case , which has a case w/ PSU , but at least it is Aspire .	St
1.9.7	The only thing is that it looks a little too [ /i [ flashy , but thats just my opinion : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16811144005 Currently , SATA3G is the best , then SATA|| , then finally SATA , I think .	St
1.9.8	Of course there is SCSI , but we wo n't go into that .	St
1.9.9	hth ~Ibrahim~	St
1.10.1	How 'bout this motherboard ?	Ques
1.10.2	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16813131525	Ques
1.11.1	NIL	St
1.12.1	do n't forget to get a tube of arctic silver thermal compound if needed ?	Ques
1.12.2	Also , since you do n't list a monitor/keyboard/mouse/speakers/printer , then i assume you only need the computer and am looking for one that 's around $ 1000 ?	Ques
1.12.3	If that 's the case , suggest maybe a dual-core ?	Ques
1.12.4	Unless you want to save for around $ 800 budget .	St
1.12.5	Roger	St
1.13.1	I own a SiS Chipset , and I 've had numerous problems with it , and drivers are not perfect .	St
1.13.2	Maybe I just have a bad board , just my $ .02 ~Ibrahim~	St
1.14.1	What kinds of problems , aside from the drivers , are you having with it ?	Ques
1.14.2	What other mobo would you recommend ?	Ques
1.15.1	NIL	St
