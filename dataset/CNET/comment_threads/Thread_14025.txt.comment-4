The daunting challange of home repair is that you don't have the spares that a bench technician has.
They may (and often do) have spare board to test the CPU or would check the heatsink or CPU to see if the heatsink was on proper or the CPU was burnt.
The PC was not made with proper diagnostics for us to point at this and say replace this to make it work.
Your story is far too slim to give the nod to one piece over the other.
For instance you could have told that the CPU fan had failed, or it was clogged with dust or any tiny detail but your posts are without stories or details.
I will not engage in long questions since you are the one with the dead machine and this space is for you to write at length and hope someone sees what it is or gives the nod to one part over the other.
As it stands I think the basic parts are under suspect.
What parts can you swap out for test?
