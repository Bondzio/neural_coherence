1.1.1	I'm looking at getting one of Velocity Micro's SX-V desktops after reading great reviews about them all over the internet...but am confused at what their &quot;VideoCool Positive Pressure Airflow System - Speed adjustable, with light&quot; specifically is...they don't offer any mention of it anywhere on their website but it appears to be standard on their higher-end gaming PC's...wondering if it'll be worth the $39.00???	St
1.1.2	?	Ques
1.2.1	there's a lot of heat in there.	St
1.2.2	Many systems use negative pressure, meaning just the power supply is sucking hot air out of the PC.	St
1.2.3	Adding case fans, etc, builds up pressure, blowing hot air out of vents.	St
1.2.4	Either pay the extra or plan on buying some fans of your own, including maybe a video chip fan if there is a heat sink on it.	St
1.3.1	It would have been nice if you would have included a link to the site so others could go and look at it so we could be of more help.	St

1.4.1	Sorry about that, typed it up too quick.	St
1.4.2	Velocity's website is www.velocitymicro.com and the specific configuration i'm going to get is http://www.velocitymicro.com/wizard.php?iid=29	St
1.5.1	Hi Terry, If you are going to go by the basics as configured in your reference, it looks good, but I have two suggestions: You need a Modem to get on the internet with dial-up.	St
1.5.2	If you plan on playing all the current high end games and especially those in the future, the configuration with internal graphics even the GMA 900 will disappoint you.	St
1.5.3	I suggest you get at least the Nvida GeForce 6600 PCI-Express that they list for $100 more which coincides with your motherboard.	St
1.5.4	With the other specs you should be good for high tech games now and for the next several years.	St
1.6.1	Thanks, I didn't quite specify what I was going to go for in my main message, but will be upgrading it quite a bit.	St
1.6.2	Also, I have broadband so the onboard 10/100/1000 will be plenty for me.	St
1.6.3	The changes i'm making to the basics include 3.2ghz processor, 256mb nVidea 6600 card, 1gb generic/Mushkin memory (haven't decided), the video cooling, downgrade to a 120gb HDD, and getting a DVD restore disk instead of keyboard/mouse.	St
1.7.1	Here's the answer from Velocity Micro: Although the video card typically has a fan, the video cool system sits below that card, has two fans, and pulls the heat away from the video card.	St
1.7.2	Thus the video remains cooler.	St
1.8.1	Thanks for that reply, though honestly was a little late, and was my fault for not updating my own thread...I had gone ahead and purchased my computer with it, but have removed it for now as like any fan, it added a little bit of noise.	St
