if you can't run your video card with the new bios update.
have you tried restoring the old bios and seeing if that resolves the issue?
i had a question a while ago about my ati card and i went to their ati.com website support forum.
they were pretty fast in replying.
but anyway, usaully when they update the bios for those boards they back up the old one.
i'd try that first, and if it persists i'd open up the computer and make sure everything was seated properly and working.
uninstall the drivers and update them with the latest (especially if i'm running vista).
and if that didn't work i'd have a very serious problem with my video card.
an expensive problem.
