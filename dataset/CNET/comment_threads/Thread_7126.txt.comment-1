I seldom use my Lexmark Z52 to print in color, maybe once every few weeks, but even after a few days the color cartridge won't print all the colors.
The yellow clogs up soonest, then the blue.
(You can go weeks without the black cartridge clogging up.)
Cleaning the nozzles from within the Lexmark control program does not unclog the yellow and blue inks.
The only way to fix it, which is not just a hassle but expensive inkwise, is to remove the cartridge, soak the bottom in hot water, wipe it with alcohol, then use the printer software to spray out the nozzles.
Does there exist a printer with color inks that do not dry out so fast?
