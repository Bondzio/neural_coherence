St
1.1.20	Thank you all in advance for taking the time to check for me!	St
1.2.1	I'd suggest going for a Linux/GNU or FreeBSD system built for graphics.	St
1.2.2	http://www.freebsd.org/ports/graphics.html You'll have to setup the system and configure the graphics.	St

1.2.5	Security, graphics libraries.	St
