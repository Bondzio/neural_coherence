It is online. the cables are correctly plugged in. the power supply is on. i send a page to print and nothing happens and it comes up printer error. Even a test page will not print from my computer. I have connected it through the LPT1 port. Does anyone know what i am doing wrong. Do I need to clear out some registers or other stuff on my computer. The computer tells me the LPT1 port is working and ok. Please help i've spent hours on this.

I haven't read it yet but leave that to you. Good luck and try the network connection next. Bob
