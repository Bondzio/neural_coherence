1.3.1	On most newer SATA drives , you connect the SATA drive to the motherboard , then you can either plug in the SATA drive using a standard power supply connector ( I do n't know the fancy name for it unfortunately ) Or with a & quot ; Legacy & quot ; Power Connector ( Thin strip like the one you plugged into the motherboard with , only wider ) .
