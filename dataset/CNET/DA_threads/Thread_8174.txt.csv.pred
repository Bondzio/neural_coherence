1.1.1	I have an epox EP-9NDA3J Socket 939 AMD Athlon 64 Motherboard that supports SATA and IDE hardrives .	St
1.1.2	I am purchasing a new hardrive and would like to upgrade to a SATA 80G Drive .	St
1.1.3	I also have 2 60GB IDE drives , one of which I would like to use in either a raid configuration or to store data .	St
1.1.4	My questions are these : Will I have any difficulties using both a SATA and IDE drive in a raid configuration ?	Ques
1.1.5	Will I have any difficulties transfering data from one to the other if I do not use a raid configuration ?	Ques
1.1.6	Do I need to have two operating systems installed on both drives to use a raid configuration ?	Ques
1.1.7	What specs should I look for in a SATA hardrive so I notice a difference in speed ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thanks in advance .	St
1.2.1	I was thinking of purchasing this SATA hardrive .	St
1.2.2	Any thoughts on this drive ?	Ques

1.3.1	What are you using your PC for ?	Ques
1.3.2	What do you think RAID will do for you ? ? ? ?	Ques
1.3.3	How are you backing up your system ? ?	Ques
1.3.4	Why 80GB ... when you get get much more diskspace without spending much more $ $ ?	Ques
1.3.5	For about $ 100 you can get state of the art 200 or 250GB HDD .	St

1.4.1	I do some gaming .	St
1.4.2	I guess I would like to do a Raid 0 configuration to speed up my gaming .	St
1.4.3	My understanding is that I do not need a second operating system installed to do this .	St
1.4.4	I guess then , my questions are narrowed down to these : Am I going to have a problem running Raid 0 configuration with a 80+ GB sized SATA hardrive and a 60GB IDE hardrive ?	Ques
1.4.5	If not , does anyone have any recommendations for a hardrive ?	Ques
1.4.6	Lastly , What steps will I need to utilize in order to implement this process ?	Ques
1.4.7	Thanks ,	St
1.5.1	Oh , I forgot to ad , currently , I really do not have a solid backup plan .	St
1.5.2	In the past I have used a 1gb thumbdrive to back up important documents and other items of importance ; some I would just drop into my second hardrive .	St
1.5.3	I would do this by using the backup utility that comes with Windows XP .	St
1.5.4	Could I even use a 3rd drive as a backup in another Raid configuration ?	Ques
1.6.1	It appears I do not want to set up a Raid 0 configuration ; it looks to risky .	St
1.6.2	Can I do a Raid 1 with a SATA drive and an IDE drive ?	Ques
1.6.3	Lastly , any recommendations for a SATA drive ?	Ques
1.6.4	Thanks	Polite
1.7.1	To the best of my knowledge , you can not mix SATA and PATA IDE drives in the same RAID array .	St
1.7.2	Most of the configurations I 've seen recommend using the same make , model and capacity drive when you 're building a RAID array .	St
1.7.3	Re RAID ... help me understand why you want to use RAID at all ?	Ques
1.7.4	SATA HDDs ... .take a look at storagereview.com , tomshardware.com , anandtech.com , etc .	St
1.7.5	Then look a Newegg.com and see the buyer comments on the specific products you 're interested in .	St
1.7.6	In real life SATA drives do n't give you much more performanvce if any over the corresponding PATA drives .	St
1.7.7	The major benefit is they allow addition of more drives to the system , they do n't require jumpering and they use less cumbersome cabling .	St

1.8.1	As luck would have it ... .here 's something directly from Kim Komando at komando.com on RAID & quot ; Using RAID to backup data Q. I 've lost two hard drives and had to rebuild stuff twice in a year , so the concept of RAID is starting to sound appealing .	St
1.8.2	I only know enough about RAID to be dangerous , so can you explain it ?	Ques
1.8.3	Is this a good way to back up my computer ?	Ques
1.8.4	A. I have a definite position on your question : maybe , but probably not !	St
1.8.5	Before I explain that , let 's talk about RAID .	St
1.8.6	That 's an acronym for redundant array of independent disks .	St
1.8.7	There are a number of ways to set up RAID .	St
1.8.8	I wo n't bore you with that .	St
1.8.9	You 're talking about RAID1 , or mirroring , so let 's focus on that .	St
1.8.10	Mirroring simply means that you have two drives , and they have exactly the same things on them .	St
1.8.11	When you save a document , it is saved on both hard drives .	St
1.8.12	If the primary drive fails , you switch to the other .	St
1.8.13	Mirroring has long been used in Internet servers .	St
1.8.14	With it , a company does n't have to worry about its Web site going down if a drive fails .	St
1.8.15	The secondary drive immediately takes over .	St
1.8.16	That could be helpful to you if you suffer drive failures .	St
1.8.17	However , I do n't think RAID works well for backups .	St
1.8.18	When you establish a backup routine , you should back up your data day after day .	St
1.8.19	That way , you can go back in time to find uncorrupted data , if necessary .	St
1.8.20	Let me give you an example .	St
1.8.21	Say you have an important database file .	St
1.8.22	One day , the file will not open .	St
1.8.23	Something has happened , and the file is corrupted .	St
1.8.24	The data in that file is no longer available .	St
1.8.25	If you have a RAID mirror setup , the file on the backup drive will probably be in exactly the same shape .	St
1.8.26	Instead of being able to go to a backup from last week or last month , which is presumably uncorrupted , you have only a current , corrupted file .	St
1.8.27	So , although mirroring has its benefits , they pertain more to commercial situations .	St
1.8.28	( Some computers , including my office machine , have RAID0 , or striping .	St
1.8.29	This divides data between two hard drives , supposedly making read and write operations faster .	St
1.8.30	Again , I think the benefit is marginal on the desktop . )	St
1.8.31	You should have a backup routine for your data .	St
1.8.32	At home , I copy my data to a second hard drive ; at work , to the server .	St
1.8.33	You could combine your backup routine with an imaging program , such as Norton Ghost .	St
1.8.34	An imaging program allows you to take a picture of the hard drive , which you can use if your hard drive fails .	St
1.8.35	But the image is static .	St
1.8.36	So you need regular backups as you change or add files .	St
1.8.37	I considered installing a RAID setup when I built my home computer two years ago .	St
1.8.38	I intended to use it for backups , but I decided RAID was inadequate .	St
1.8.39	My advice is : Do n't bother. & quot ;	Ques
1.9.1	So I can not use my IDE harddrive with a SATA hardrive as my primary ?	Ques
1.10.1	You 'll have to try that one ... all of mine have been IDE primary with SATA secondary or SATA - SATA .	St
1.10.2	Let us know .	St
