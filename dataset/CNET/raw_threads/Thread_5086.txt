But yes, when it gets about 2 years old and with folk that use it daily I expect these to need a battery but I can't tell from the information whether this applies or not. Bob

This problem started a few months ago. Since I have B&N insurance, I have turned in my original tablet two times for the same tablet with a later manufacturing date. Still have the same problem. I do use my tablet on a daily basis. Would you suggest going to the newer model of Nook or try another manufacturer. I think B&N is leaning toward blaming me with doing something wrong. Model #BNTV250A, software version 1.4.3.
