Hi, Home network with 2 xp pro sp3 towers and an xp pro sp3 laptop.
Attached to one pc is a printer (via usb port).
Suddenly when the other tower pc prints the output font size is about 1 (everything is shunted up into the top left hand corner of the page).
If the document is emailed to the machine with the printer attached then it prints ok. Any suggestions please?
