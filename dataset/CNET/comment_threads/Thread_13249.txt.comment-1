One of my computers is a (hpmx70 with a lexmarkx6150 printer), the other computer on my wireless network is a (dell 8400 with a canon ip6000d printer).
I can access the internet via each computers but cannot do any printer or file sharing.
I have managed to make the printers (SHARED) on each computer, but when I run the (Add Printer Wizard) and browse for other printers on my network, the wizard cannot find any.
All it finds is (Microsoft windows network).
All firewall are off.
Please help.
thanks.
