<s> I'm going off to college in the fall and I need to get myself a good MFC (All-in-one). </s>
<s> I would kind of like to stay away from HP because of all the crapware that comes bundled with their printer drivers. </s>
<s> I'm a little afraid to get a printer at all because of some of the reviews I've seen. </s>
<s> I would like to be able to print good-quality photos and good-quality text, which it seems are rarely found together in a printer these days. </s>
<s> A balance of quality and price is really what I'm looking for. </s>
<s> If anyone can aid me in my search, that would be great. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help, drummerboy </s>
<s> Sorry, but I haven't noticed such. </s>
<s> Do you mean that thing that offers to sell you ink when low? </s>

<s> The HP software is just unnecessarily bulky. </s>
<s> It slows system performance by loading a whole bunch of unnecessary apps into system memory and going in and cleaning that up is not something I'm interested in doing. </s>
<s> The install for one of the HP printers I have was about 700mb. </s>
<s> What in the world do I need 550mb of printer drivers/utilities for? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> And not so much on the install. </s>
<s> The units work just fine here and I opted out of the paint and other applications. </s>
<s> I do run into people that are aghast at &quot;code bloat&quot; but at the risk of igniting someone like that I have to write &quot;get used to it.&quot; Here's an article why this is happening in Windows. </s>
<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Software_bloat If you are looking to escape from bloat, jump out of Windows. </s>

<s> If you need one that does text along with a decent job on the photos, look at the iP4300 printer or the MP530 AIO or MP600 if you don't need the fax. </s>
<s> Individual cartridges, small droplet size, fast print, plus duplexing. </s>
<s> Its a shame that there's a bunch of s/w loaded when you install a new printer, but that's the way it is. </s>
<s> Understand, that all such s/w can provide function for tasks you *may* want of the m/f printer as times goes on. </s>
<s> You of course can(if applicable) de-install or reduce some functions. </s>
<s> Those functions are to email any pictures, fax s/w, OCR s/w for scanning, and s/w for cropping & manupitation before printing, plus monitor s/w for ink levels and not to forget the drivers of the OS being used. </s>
<s> There should also some management of any pictures and/or copied documents, etc.. Hope this helps in your quest. </s>
<s> May i suggest you look into the new Kodak 5xxx series of printers which offer reduced costs of ink, plus offer more permanent inks than usually provided from other vendors. </s>
<s> Check out ther support website. </s>

<s> I know what you mean! </s>
<s> I have an HP all in one, there is a boatload of crap on the disc. </s>
<s> Try going to the HP support site and finding just the latest driver and download/install and don't run the disc; this will give you the minimum. </s>
