every time i start up my computer i get &quot;checking nvram&quot;.
what is that?
i'm not sure when it starting but it takes about 40 seconds to complete and then my computer starts fine.
boot time is longer now and i can't remember when this started or what i installed when it did start.
if i restart my computer at any time it does not do this check.
if i hit escape when starting up it stops the &quot;checking nvram&quot; but am i doing some time of damage when i escape this check?
i can't find anything in my bios set up to by-pass this check.
in other words i have by-passed checking the a drive in boot up but cannot find anything about this nvram thing.
