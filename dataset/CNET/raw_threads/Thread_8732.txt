I was hoping I could just install a sata-esata adapter cable and plug in the new hd and that would be that. Something tells me it's not going to be so simple, and I have a feeling I'm going to need a pci card. So can I just install the sata-esata adapter cable or do I need a pci card ( any references/links to where I can purchase a good cable or card would be helpful ).

Of course, I want to get the best performance so I guess I'll buy/put it the sata-esata bracket. Again my question is: is the bracket all I need to get the best performance or do I need a card?
7127	5	286207	2720017	2720008	R. Proffitt	3/2/08 3:15 PM	1.2044709E12	Never.	I deal with lost data on drives from the public and have to come down with &quot;never&quot; for firewire and a Windows PC. You are more than welcome to try it but my experiences is either it works fine then someday it just loses it all. Stick with the sata or USB plus a damage resistant file system (FAT32 is out!) Bob

I notice they sell PCIxpress cards that will give you xtrnal esata port/s. Is this for those whose motherboard/hdcontrollers don't have an xtra connector for the bracket. Or is the PCIxpress card for better hd performancs?
7127	7	286207	2720065	2720017	bigdavetru	3/2/08 4:45 PM	1.2044763E12	FAT32	Thanks for the tip about FAT32, the drive comes with it preformatted. I guess the first thing I'll do is reformat it into one big NTFS partition (it's a 500gb drive ) with the XP disk management utility. I'm not sure about what will be the best partition size/s. I'll be using this new xtrnl drive to keep a complete backup of my 200gb internal drive, as well as for the xtra storage. Any suggestions would be appreciated, thanks!
7127	8	286207	2720101	2720026	VAPCMD	3/2/08 5:30 PM	1.204479E12	Basically ....yes.	You would really only need a PCI SATA or perhaps a PCIe SATA controller if there were't any free SATA ports on the MB or the MB SATA interface wasn't fast enough for the external HDD. Not sure you'd see a big difference either way. Some of the newer, higher-end MBs have external SATA ports. For those that don't...something like what I recommended is a great alternative. Let us know...it worked well for me. VAPCMD

This is the Intel bios (ver AG91510J.15A.0816.2005.0214.1818 02/14/2005). Is the bios suppose to detect the new hd automatically? Cannot figure out how to manually enter values for new hd. Drive works fine in firewire mode ( remember its a Western Digital My Book Home Edition External Hard Drive ).
7127	10	286207	2726593	2726472	ahtoi	3/11/08 1:54 AM	1.20520044E12	Yes, the bios is suppose to see the drive.	So power on the drive before booting the computer.

7127	12	286207	2726838	2726719	ahtoi	3/11/08 9:21 AM	1.20522726E12	Don't think update is the problem.	try another another connection if you have more than 2. or maybe switch with the internal drive connection just to if it get recognize.
7127	13	286207	2729249	2726838	bigdavetru	3/14/08 12:14 PM	1.20549684E12	bad esata cables maybe?	bios doesn't see it no matter what sata mobo connector is used, even the one the internal drive is using. Any sure way to test the cable(s)? Else maybe I'll try to find a cable that connects directly from mobo to my extrnl drive, just to test things out( I tried the cable from my mobo to my internal drive but that doesn't work ) . If I install an eSata pci card ( which provide esata connections ) will the bios be forced to see it?
7127	14	286207	2729593	2729249	ahtoi	3/15/08 12:26 AM	1.20554076E12	No, pci controller is not going to help.	Sounds like the problem lies with the connection, cable, or the external harddrive itself or maybe the external power supply. Of course the quickest way to test it out would be to connect the drive to another computer.
7127	15	286207	2729835	2729593	bigdavetru	3/15/08 9:26 AM	1.20557316E12	Yeah I need another pc with a working esata port	The drive works fine in firewire mode. I need to find somebody near with a working esata port.
