<s> Ok, I need to know what kinda server I would build if I just wanted to run 2 simple sites on it. </s>
<s> Any recommendations as far as parts or software would be nice. </s>
<s> thanx </s>
<s> Is your goal to learn how to build a PC or to run a web page? </s>
<s> Example. </s>
<s> Our web server for close to 10 years was some Pentium 100MHz with 64MB RAM running an older NT Windows. </s>
<s> It had an 8.4GB hard disk and served up the web pages just fine. </s>
<s> Are you sure of your goals? </s>
<s> As to the software, today I want a LAMP based distro. </s>
<s> Read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_ (software_bundle) Bob </s>
<s> Nah, I've built several pc's I just thought that servers had to be more powerful to keep a site up. </s>
<s> OBVIOUSLY NOT!!! </s>
<s> I am hoping to learn to run a web page though. </s>
<s> Is LAMP totally free? </s>
<s> I didn't see where you said &quot;I want a LAMP based distro&quot;. </s>
<s> I guess if it was free you'd already have it! </s>
<s> Do you know of any setup that is totally free? </s>
<s> Yes, I have a few LAMP servers. </s>
<s> But since web serving takes so little oomph we look for low watt systems. </s>
<s> Today my favorite are those 20 Watt Geode CPU's. </s>
<s> The current web server at the office is drawing under 60 watts at peak use now. </s>
<s> Your goals are still unclear here. </s>
<s> Web site or building a PC? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ok, #1 Is building a server any different from building a pc? </s>
<s> #2 If it isn't what is different? </s>
<s> #3 Is there anything that is free(software) that I can use to keep a site up? </s>
<s> Just layin it out straight so there's no confusion. </s>
<s> #1 Trick Question? </s>
<s> A PC can be a server, as R. Proffit stated, but dedicated servers have multiple, powerful processors, lots of RAM, numerous fast hard disks often in a RAID 5 array, and very fast NICs. </s>
<s> #2 See Above. </s>
<s> #3 Apache is a free web server. </s>
<s> Ok, thanks. </s>
