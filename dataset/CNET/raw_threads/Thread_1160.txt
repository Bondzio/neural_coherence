I've been upgrading RAM and storage as we go, but we've reached the end of the road with this one. I'm considering two different computers for purchase: one is a refurbished from buy.com, and one is a newer tower from Best Buy. Regardless of which one I get I plan on installing a second hard drive (to separate the operating system from the data) which I'm guessing would void any warranty that comes with the machine. So bear that in mind.

Ok, the warranty is split into a few areas. Yes you'll not get any warranty support for the OS. It was not that good anyway as most questions end with &quot;restore the factory OS.&quot; But the hardware is still under warranty with something you must know going in. They won't support you with a hardware issue unless you restore the factory load. Some get upset about that but 'dems the rules'. While the x4500 might be slammed by some, outside of games I find it a great solution. My laptop with a 4500MHD connects to the HDTV with HDMI and plays HD content just fine. And with your i3 you'll scream past my laptop's older C2D 2.0GHz CPU. Bob

Given the nature of desktops and the need to clean them yearly how would we avoid opening the case. Of course they would cover a non-stock setup. But if you do this right you can return it to stock when needed. Hard disks are so cheap that I could remove the supplied drive, slip in a new drive just for my use. Bob

7924	7	388988	3278755	3278679	thegibson	3/31/10 2:22 PM	1.27004532E12	wow	I guess I'm just shocked that there's $160 worth of value in the processor considering I'm going to void the warranty the minute I get home. I wasn't expecting that. Does anyone else agree?

7924	9	388988	3278919	3278885	thegibson	3/31/10 6:34 PM	1.27006044E12	Okay.	... but I don't render video. I might rip some DVD's so I have backups for my kids, but rendering video is not something I know how to do or am looking to learn.

ALL and I mean ALL dvd rippers I've seen render some of the DVD to get an idea of what to do with the DVD. If you want to make a less than great upgrade to a value only box then do that. At least someone warned you. Bob
