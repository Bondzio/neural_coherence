<s> Stay away from this product. </s>
<s> What a nightmare product. </s>
<s> Not only is it as useless as **** on a boar, but they won't refund your purchase! </s>
<s> I spent weeks with the D-Link tech folks, who are as frustrated as their customers. </s>
<s> They can't get a firmware made that will keep the unit online and conflict-free. </s>
<s> What ends up happening, as a customer, you end up as their beta-tester... and you get to pay for the privilege! </s>
<s> If you are thinking of buying this junk-bin item, do your homework! </s>
<s> Read up on all the other users pulling their hair out trying to get their units working. </s>
<s> You have been warned! </s>
<s> Ok, when you bought it was it from Dlink or some retailer? </s>
<s> The refund is not from Dlink but that retailer. </s>
<s> In closing, we see this complaint about many routers. </s>
<s> Can you try it per our forum sticky and reveal if P2P use is part of the problem? </s>

<s> Retailer was NewEgg, who referred me to the MFG for refund... D-Link referred me back to retailer. </s>
<s> SOL P2P is not an issue. </s>
<s> Simply getting the unit to stay connected was. </s>
<s> Rebooting was required every 5 to 10 minutes, and was the suggested remedy by D-link tech support. </s>
<s> That, and trying various firmwares. </s>
<s> All of which made little difference. </s>
<s> Replacing the router was the most effective solution. </s>
<s> Newegg is where to focus. </s>
<s> The product is defective and the money went from you to Newegg. </s>
<s> If by CC, call them and explain that the product was defective from day one and what to do next. </s>
<s> I've used far too many routers but the recurring advice is to use our forum's preferred settings. </s>
<s> If you already replaced it, then back to the CC company. </s>
