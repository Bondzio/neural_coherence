<s> I have an Acer Aspire one netbook with windows xp. </s>
<s> It keeps on checking the file system, it goes in a loop. </s>
<s> So I've declared it useless because it keeps giving me the &quot;blue screen of death&quot;. </s>
<s> I like to experiment and wonder if the netbook can boot from an external hard drive. </s>
<s> The hard drive has windows xp, 40 gb, and use to be installed in my compaq desktop. </s>
<s> Is it possible? </s>
<s> Or is the netbook trash? </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> Microsoft never enabled Windows to boot from USB. </s>
<s> So that's a dead end. </s>
<s> There are versions of Linux the boot from CD, USB sticks and drives. </s>
<s> Our Acer Aspire let us create restore media so I am left to ask why not use that? </s>
