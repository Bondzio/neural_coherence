I am having a problem with my hard drive and am afraid it will fail.
I have a second hard drive in my system that was set up to shadow the C drive.
I disabled that second drive after I received the computer, so this drive is essentially new.
Do I have to do anything to the second drive, since it does have a couple of files on it to be able to use it as a primary drive?
Any help would be appreciated.
I am running Windows XP Home Edition.
