1.1.1	I have had a desktop PC for years and I always left it running in sleep mode when not in use .	St
1.1.2	I recently got the new Macbook and it is my first notebook .	St
1.1.3	When I am not using it should I generally turn it off or leave it in sleep mode ?	Ques
1.1.4	Im not to sure if there are any differences to the hardiness of laptop HDD 's over desktops .	St
1.1.5	Reading online it seems that Laptop HDD 's seem to be a litte more fragile .	St
1.1.6	Also is there a problem with leaving the laptop plugged into the wall for extended periods even after it is done charging ?	Ques

1.2.2	His cat ate the mouse when his computer was in the sleep-mode .	St
1.2.3	http : //img212.imageshack.us/img212/8417/newmouse7tl.jpg : ) Personally , I leave my G4 on all the time and my Viewsonic Monitor goes into the so-called Sleep-Mode .	St
1.2.4	Not my computer .	St
1.2.5	I personally would shut off a laptop every time you close the cover .	St
1.2.6	Why leave the thing on ?	Ques

1.3.1	I believe the default setting for sleep mode on the MacBooks is to also put the HDD to sleep when possible .	St
1.3.2	So , once the laptop has gone into sleep mode , the HDD is no longer spinning and everything is basically in a state of limbo .	St
1.3.3	You should have no concerns about the & quot ; fragility & quot ; of the HDD , although they are smaller and appear less robust than their full sized counterparts , they are designed to withstand a little more & quot ; abuse & quot ; than a drive that will be forever fixed in a permanent position .	St
1.3.4	I have an old iBook that sleeps for 80 % of the time , with the drive shut down , It 's about 7 years old and has the original drive .	St
1.3.5	On the subject of leaving the machine plugged into the wall , not a problem .	St
1.3.6	The Power Management circuit will ensure that a float charge will be applied to the battery , just to keep it tickled up , and push the rest of the power past the battery to the inner sanctum .	St
1.3.7	It is a good idea to discharge the battery fully , once in a while ( see the manual ) and then plug it back in again .	St
1.3.8	Just run it until it shuts itself down .	St
1.3.9	Hope this helps P	St
