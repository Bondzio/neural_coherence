<s> I have a Dell Dimm 4700 Windows7 P4 2.8 4GB Bios A06 Believe it has a AGP Radeon X300/X550/X1050 in it Don't want to spend alot, fry anything, nor do any big time gaming. </s>
<s> My question is; What is a decent cheap low power option, and will I see any difference (will it help at all) Thanks! </s>
<s> 300 watts </s>
<s> Not much choices at such a low PSU. </s>
<s> We can't be sure how many spare Watts are available for the new card. </s>
<s> Yes the old card is sadly unknown so we have to guess a little and hope that the usual PCIe GT220 1GB card will do fine. </s>
<s> Here the total power draw from my kid's HP d5000t is at 100 Watts when gaming so it should be fine. </s>
<s> Look for them on amazon, newegg and such sites. </s>
<s> Example at http://www.amazon.com/EVGA-nVidia-GeForce-PCI-Exp There are far too many dimension models so be sure yours has a full height PCIe slot. </s>

<s> My video card is the old AGP style (not pci) I don't believe I am pulling to many watts, although I may repalce the PSU in the future, maybe at the same time I have been looking for an AGP that can do windows 7 Anyway, my main question is will I see any big difference for everyday computing (surfing / email) or is the video card really just for gaming? </s>
<s> I may do some basic video rediting (cam corder family movies), does it help this? </s>
<s> For video editing, playback even the old fx6200 is OK. </s>
<s> I won't write again about what a video card does but today we have GAMING and we have AERO and then the rest. </s>
<s> Since you just need the basics without gaming let's find some AGP card that's not bottom of the barrel without a big power draw. </s>
<s> How about http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814187122 Read the comments and you find folk do use this on Windows 7. </s>

<s> AGP and windows 7 is the tough part I found ATi Radeon HD3450 512mb gddr2 AGP 8x Windows 7 capatible, does say 64 bit mem bus, my sys is 32 bit Does that matter? </s>
<s> only calls for a 250 PSU but, it's $65, about 20 more than I wanted (beggars can't be choosy!) </s>
<s> Thanks all, will I see a big diffrence visually? </s>
<s> Or is it more the abuility to do things faster etc Just tryiong to upgrade a dinosaur for under a hundred and fifty bucks maxed out ram and bigger HD for $90, and wanted a card for about 40 Is upgrading the power supply only for the vid card, is there any other reason to? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> The 3450 ain't bad but you are pushing your luck on power. </s>
<s> I know that card and it's more juice than the 6200. </s>
<s> And no to the AGP or GPU data bus width. </s>
<s> That has nothing to do with the OS. </s>
<s> As to the visual question I can bet no. </s>
<s> But then again some may pick out this or that to be a flaw. </s>
<s> I can't tell. </s>
