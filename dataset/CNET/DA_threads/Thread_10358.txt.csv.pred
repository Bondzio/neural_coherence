1.1.1	I am a real organize freak and a thing that really bugs me are random files that have been installed on my second harddrive .	St
1.1.2	When i double click on that harddrive it opens it up and brings me with the folders i have put on it , but also things that have been in stalled in the past .	St
1.1.3	Two of the folders on there are just a bunch of numbers .	St
1.1.4	Also there is a file called & quot ; WuTempt & quot ; , and & quot ; msdownload.tmp & quot ; and four ffast files .	St
1.1.5	Is there anyway i can move these without hurting anything .	St
1.2.1	Your choice on the matter .	St
1.2.2	WUTEMP was a windows update temporary directory .	St
1.2.3	I 've seen some delete it without harm .	St
1.2.4	If your post has typographic errors , I 'd show some neatnic tendency and offer a correction .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	lol k i just deleted teh ones with temp and i put the others in a folder .	St
1.3.2	hopefully everything goes well .	St
1.4.1	If you have MS Office , take it 's functions out of & quot ; Startup & quot ; and turn off & quot ; FastFind & quot ; which is what the & quot ; ff & quot ; stuff usually is .	St
1.4.2	Also , if your OS is XP , you can probably turn off system restore for drives you just use for storage because it wo n't save those for you .	St
