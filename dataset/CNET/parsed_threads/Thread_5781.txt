<s> For my graduation project as a senior next year for high school, I decided to build a computer. </s>
<s> Normally I would wait until the end of August to construct it (price drops) but I want to build it sometime in July (that way I have time to make sure nothing goes wrong and I can enjoy it during the summer). </s>
<s> The one thing I'm having difficulty deciding on is picking the cpu. </s>
<s> Because this system is more on the budget side, I'll be using cheaper processors. </s>
<s> I narrowed it down to the Pentium 4 524 (3.06GHZ 1MB L2 cache w/ HT), Pentium D 805 (2.66GHZ 2x!MB L2), or Athlon 64 3500+ (2.2GHX 512kb L2). </s>
<s> I play games, but not at high resolutions and this is my first build so I'm not sure if I should handle an LGA775 cpu. </s>
<s> Any suggesstions? </s>
<s> sry i should have put this in but I'm thinking Athlon 64 due to heat from Prescott and Smithfield, but I'll galdly listen to any other opinions. </s>
<s> CPUs will likely be a bit cheaper when Conroe is out which is supposed to be next month ya know. </s>
<s> Even if you go with something older it may well be much cheaper after the new stuff comes out. </s>
<s> Regards, JB </s>
<s> I have a 3700+ and the 3.0GHz HT the kid has is just a tad faster. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> All the P4's that you're talking about have the 533MHz bus. </s>
<s> If anything, wait until after Conroe is released; AMD will cut the prices of their dual-core CPUs in half. </s>
