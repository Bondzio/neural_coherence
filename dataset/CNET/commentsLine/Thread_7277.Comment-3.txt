i have tried to boot the os from the cd/rom and it will not work.
i can't even hear it turning.
i have changed the boot order to cd and still nothing.
i can't seem to get past this page at all.
i can go into the the system using f11/f12 and f1 and f2 and that is it.
tell me what information you need and i will be happy to give it to you.
by the way, thank you bob.
