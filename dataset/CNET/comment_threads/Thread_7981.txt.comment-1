I would like to upgrade my video card from my Nvidia Geforce FX5200.
What would be a reasonable Nvidia uprade for my system in the $100-$150 range?
I am concerned about compatability and cooling.
System: Pentium 4 3.2Ghz, 3 Gig RAM, motherboard Intel D865GLC.
I am unsure of wattage of power supply.
