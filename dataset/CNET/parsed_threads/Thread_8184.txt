<s> Hi there: I've got a question to ask about my internet set up. </s>
<s> currently, my wireless router is connected to my modem, what I'd like to know is, is it possible to connect my modem to a switch then the wireless router to the switch and still keep everything working? </s>
<s> If I connect one computer to the switch through LAN cable and another computer to the wireless router through WiFi, will both computer be able to go onto the internet? </s>
<s> Sorry about the long question, but it's just that the logistics of the rooms and stuff makes things difficult. </s>
<s> Cheers </s>
<s> ive got my wireless belkin going into my pc like you and my wireless goes into my modem also. </s>
<s> my wifes pc is upstairs and shes also got a laptop and every thing works fine. </s>
<s> i can turn my pc off whenever and internet still works fine. </s>
<s> she has got wireless built into both devices though.i dont see no need 4 a switch as the wireless signal comes from the modem then goes through the wireless 2 her computers.you should have no problems mate. </s>
<s> heres a link that might help. </s>

<s> modem &gt;wireless router &gt; switch-- That's the order. </s>
<s> I take it that the wireless router with several ports. </s>
<s> Connect your switch to one of the ports in the router. </s>
<s> Why would you need a switch anyway. </s>
<s> Do you have more than 3 computers you want to hardwire or are you just experimenting? </s>
<s> This is the wrong layout modem &gt; switch &gt; router. </s>
<s> The modem gives you one ipaddress (unless its a combo) and the router is a NAT that essentially subdivides that one number and sends the message to the proper computer which can be wired or wireless (if it's a wireless router). </s>
<s> Kind of like a veteran mailman who gets a mail that don't have the address. </s>
<s> He knows everyone in town and knows that the mail belong to this house and not that. </s>
<s> The switch cannot translate. </s>
<s> It's like a new mailman and knows virtually no one in town. </s>
<s> Whatever address he sees on the mail, that where goes to put it, but he would be lost if the address wasn't there. </s>
<s> The NAT (router) is a smart device that knows which computer out of 10 computers in your house ask for the message from the internet. </s>
<s> The switch is not that smart. </s>
<s> He dropped out of college. </s>
<s> This is not a technical explanation, but it gives you an idea. </s>
<s> Yea, I thought so. </s>
<s> It's just that the Modem is in my room while the router is very far away (the wiring from the modem to the router is inside the wall), I don't want to have a cable going all the way from the router to the computer so was thinking of some way of hooking the computer straight onto the modem without disconnecting the router. </s>
<s> Thanks for the quick reply, guess I'll just have to go with wireless then. </s>
<s> So the computer is right next to the modem. </s>
<s> Just take the router and connect a patch cable (short cable) to it (WAN side) and plug the other end into the modem. </s>
<s> Take the long cable from the modem that is in the wall and plug it in one of the port of the router. </s>
<s> Take another patch cable and plug one end to your computer and the other to the router. </s>
<s> At the end of the long cable in the other room, get a switch and plug in as many computer as you want (limited to the number of ports, of course). </s>
<s> modem &gt; router &gt; 1st port your computer, 2nd port long cable to the other room &gt; switch. </s>
<s> I just wanted to followup with another query. </s>
<s> I am also setting up a network at home and plan to have modem&gt;router&gt;switch. </s>
<s> However, is it possible to connect some computers and devices to the router's extra ports and the rest of the home's devices to the router? </s>
<s> This is mainly because of geographical constraints (the router has to be in my office room which has only one drop)\ Many Thanks. </s>
