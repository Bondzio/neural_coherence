i can discuss how cable can be a problem.
unlike dsl where each house gets their own connection to a dslam (i'm just an electronics engineer and software author) cable is more like a lan.
so what your neighbors are doing can impact this area's network performance.
put poor programming practices that can't survive a drop in the connection and you have a recipe for complaints.
while slower dsl is painful to some, it's usually the one with less drops.
