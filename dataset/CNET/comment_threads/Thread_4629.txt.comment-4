I installed a WD 10,000 rpm Sata Drive and I had to make a floppy boot drive with the Sata drivers on it.
That was installed on XP.
The other three hard drives or Maxtor IDE 7200 rpm and they did not require boot up Floppy to run them, But I had to set up Bios so I could run raid and Sata.
And I had to get the drivers from the MB disc that came with the MB Raid drivers.
The Raid driver were installed when I got to my desktop.
Good Luck Wendell H
