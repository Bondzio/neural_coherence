Thank you very much so far.
I might have a 2 part problem.
I deleted the reg keys but 1) there was no &quot;Upper file&quot; where it said there was supposed to be.
So I deleted &quot;default&quot; instead because it said &quot;cdrom/dvd drive&quot; next to it.
Upon restarting my disc drive is visible in my computer and everything else seems to work ok so I didn't break anything with the regedit.
2) New problem though is that I can't burn using my drive.
It's like the computer knows there's a disc drive but has forgotten that it's able to burn stuff as well.
Any suggestions?
