I've just plugged in my thumb drive to my computer, to save some document into it. This thumb drive contains all the work I've done for my 4 weeks of tertiary education (today is the 4th week of school in fact) When I attempt to open the thumb drive, instead of the folder that contains all of my data for school work, I see WEIRD files I've never seen before. And the file type: File. Am still shocked by the matter. I've just plugged in the thumb drive in another computer moments ago. No virus whatsoever detected in that computer. And now, the other computer where I found the problem give me plenty of, i would say, crap. Is there a way to fix this thumb drive problem?

The modified dates of all the &quot;File&quot; type files are around 2079/2080! And further more, I've found that the File System is FAT32, not the usual NTFS! Any solutions?

I'm sure that many might edit such on said drive but that seems to push one's luck as these devices have limited lifespans which I can easily multiply by using it my way. So the solution is simple. Format the thumb drive and copy your files back on to it. Bob

Though it's not really a problem, it's quite a bother having to download notes from an e-learning website my school had provided.

The flash chip inside has a limited number of erase cycles and once used up you see odd things happen. You ask if it's fixable but let me assure you that while repair is possible (change the flash chip) the cost is quite high compared to a new stick. Bob

I found some of the cheap flash drives not worth keeping after 1yr.(they die much sooner) they simply crap out. However, name brands do well and if you get a high quality one, then at least it should serve you until you're done with it. Be aware that &quot;static/ESD&quot; is very much part of the shorten life cycle of a flash drive, ground yourself or your flash drive becomes the flash point(no pun intended) to discharge static. tada -----Willy
