And the Nvidia card with the 240 which I have has never given me any sign of trouble but it's on some Intel chipset.
I guess you can google it but keep in mind I can bet somewhere someone had trouble.
And then with each card, someone somewhere reported trouble.
My card has (keeping it to my hardware) been in the HP d4999t and d5000t without issue.
