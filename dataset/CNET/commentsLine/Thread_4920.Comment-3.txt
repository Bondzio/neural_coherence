well, your answer may not have hit the bullseye, but it sure pointed me in the right direction!
the detail i forgot to mention was that i had assigned the g drive designation as a shared network drive.
i guess the sony vaio had by default assigned the &quot;g&quot; drive for the usb ports.
when i remapped the network drive to another letter, i was able to &quot;see&quot; the usb key when i plugged it in.
i didn't need to use tweakui to fix the problem.
thanks again.
