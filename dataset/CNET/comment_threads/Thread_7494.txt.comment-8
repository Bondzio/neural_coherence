I give you a 85% chance that it DOES have 5.1.
I've chatted with Dell, called them, nothing.
Went through plently of sites, yet none can say a YES or NO.
No on can confirm it or not.
BUT, BUT most of ADI's sound cards, the parent company of SoundMax or something, have 5.1.
I do have some, solidish evidence.
The 4700 in past generations have had 5.1 audio and I then assume yours should too.
I'm sorry I could not be of more help.
And sorry that I couldn't reply earlier.
