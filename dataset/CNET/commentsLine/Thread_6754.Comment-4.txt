if wired, this does not rule out the router at all.
there are completely different dynamics involved in sustaining a wired versus wireless connection.
you might try the channel change idea first.
it's simple.
access the router's web interface and look for it's broadcast channel.
it might be set to a specific channel or have an automatic setting.
the automatic setting allows the router to pick the best channel for the moment based on it's criteria.
the &quot;moment&quot; can change.
if automatic, try a fixed channel.
usually 1, 6 or 11 is recommended as these tend to overlap least with others.
if your channel is fixed, change to another.
restart the router and see what happens.
