iam referring to the samsung series 7 slate pc running win 7 professional.
the screen sometimes suddenly stops responding to pen input but continues to respond to finger touch.
i have calibrated (and recalibrated) the screen with the pen but the problem persists.
to get back to pen input i must refresh the screen (go into and out of sleep mode, for e.g).
the problem can occur whether i am browsing the web or using offline app.
does anyone know why this is happening?
