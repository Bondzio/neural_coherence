<s> OK, here is what happened. </s>
<s> I have an external 160gb usb. </s>
<s> I was trying to open a folder and it went into (Not Responding) mode. </s>
<s> I know I shouldn't but I was frustrated so I just unplugged it. </s>
<s> Once I did that I got the bubble for a Write Error, I don't know the exact wording. </s>
<s> Now I had just transferred something to it, but I thought is was done as the transfer notice went away. </s>
<s> So now the computer does not see the hard drive anywhere. </s>
<s> I have check, Disk Management, I have check BIOS and I have done this at home and on my work computer. </s>
<s> Now while I would like to save the hard drive what I really need is some of the data. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any ideas for getting the computer to recognize the drive again. </s>
<s> I have a program to get the data back but first the computer needs to see the drive. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help. </s>
<s> The best cheap strategy is to pull the hard disk out of it's casket and put it into a desktop or new USB ENCLOSURE. </s>
<s> Good luck, Bob </s>
<s> I've read where putting the HD into the freezer and cooling it down temporarily gets it to work sometimes long enough to get data off of it. </s>
<s> The freezing cold changes the metal size and allows the stuck platter to spin again, so i assume. </s>
<s> Good Luck! </s>
<s> It is at least worth a try since nothing else is allowing it to be recognized at this point. </s>
