<s> Hi, Not long ago I upgraded my system's ram from 1GB to 2GB to somewhat improve my system's performance, I'm running Windows XP sp2 2GB RAM AMD Athlon 64 3000+ (1.87 GHz) Nvidia GeForce 6200 512MB Turbocache It's not the fastest system but it's been running fine so far, My question is: I use my system to create my family DVDs and photo albums with the aid of various DVD authoring software but i recently noticed that my CPU usage while authoring was at 100% which is understandable as it's not dualcore and it's not the best out there but my RAM was 1500MB free about 74% free, Is there a way to commit RAM to aid the CPU in processing? </s>
<s> (I would not like to overclock the CPU as I am not too savvy there as i could cause some serious harm to my system) I once used a diagnostics software called SiSandra or something similar and i think it had an option to use free RAM to help the CPU, but i'm not sure how i would go about it, What would you recommend for me to make use of the free RAM instead of the CPU sweating at 100% usage and the RAM lazing about, Many thanks in advance for any replies </s>
<s> When rendering a DVD your CPU should be consumed by the task. </s>
<s> Memory isn't the issue here but the computations needed to render the work. </s>

<s> Write to or read from the DVD will bring delay, so it is different from hard drive. </s>
<s> When you start a new task, CPU will consume part of the resource to calculate and carry out this task. </s>
<s> The best way is opening Task Manager and checking which process tie up too much resource. </s>
<s> If anyone is useless at this time, you may close it. </s>
