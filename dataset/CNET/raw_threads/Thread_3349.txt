The problem i am having is that everytime i turn on the 360 or either one of the macbooks they will not connect to it so i have to unplug the sbg900 and then try to connect to it again. It always connects after i unplug it but it is just extremely annoying having to unlpug the modem/router every time i want to connect to the internet.
