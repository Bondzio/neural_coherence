Well heck, you didn't mention exactly what it was other than a LCD.
Besides the LCD portion, there are electronics that drive lcds of the video display.
These are corona chips, etc.
which are separate items either onboard or elsewhere.
These like a monitor can fail or simply weaken and demise output.
In most cases they are unique to the model involved and only a pro has parts.
But the best an end-user can do is swap parts from a savalged unit, provided they're willing and capable.
If the LCD is that old, it may not be practical other than a learning experience.
good luck -----Willy
