Hi Bob, Thanks a lot for your input.
You're absolutely right about the color control.
Sorry, I forgot to mention, I already have the Spyder 3 monitor calibrator.
So, all I need advice on, is the computer side of things.
Thanks for looking through the list and giving your comments.
What sort of network card can you recommend, or are they all the same?
Cheers...
