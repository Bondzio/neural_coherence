1.4.1	When the eMachine came out with this and other models it was documented that there was a power supply issue that caused this kind of problem ...	St
1.4.2	If your machine is not covered by warranty then you will have to buy a replacement ... should only cost between $ 30 and $ 50 .	St
1.4.3	I just replaced a friends eMachine power supply for the same reason .	St
1.5.1	Thank You jackintucson , I will try changing the power supply .	St
1.5.2	I hope is only that , because if not I do n't know what I 'm going to do .	St
1.6.1	If you see this I 'm trying you help you ( DO NOT BUY ANY eMACHINE PC ) , they are junk !	St
1.6.2	There junk right out of the box I have never had more problems with a computer and its service if you have one or just got one take it and get your money back .	St
1.6.3	I 've had it for three months now and have not been able to use it yet I have a small home business and thought getting a faster pc would help but buying this pace of sh_t was a bad idea .	St
1.6.4	And the customer service is a joke ( No idea what there talking about ) .	St
1.6.5	Like others my PC just reboots at any given time and customer service has no clue .	St
1.6.6	Ive tried reinstalling , replacing the power supply and noting works .	St
1.6.7	They try to sell me the extended service pack but why buy that when the thing isnt working now ?	Sug
1.6.8	I will do all I can to tell every one I can not to buy an Emachine .	St
1.7.1	yeah i would n't expect anything , but if you get their $ 599 and up comps , users do n't usually encounter problems .	St
1.8.1	Stuff like that happens when you either get a virus , trojan , or in some cases spyware .	St
1.8.2	Do you have : A Anti-Virus program ?	Ques
1.8.3	A Firewall ?	Ques
1.8.4	Spyware programs like both : AdAware and Spybot and MS Anti-Spyware All above can be obtained FREE .	St
1.8.5	PS ... hope you are not listening to music from some of those p2p sites that can cause that kind of problem .	St
1.9.1	I do n't think that 's the problem because I am using : Antivirus : McAfee VirusScan Professional 9.0 McAfee Personal Firewall Spyware : Ad-Aware Professional 1.6 SpySweeper 4.0 CounterSpy MS AntiSpyware Also I'am up-to-date with Microsoft Updates on Windows Update site .	St
1.9.2	Definitively is a problem of the computer , but it was the more expensive and the best of eMachines computer 's serie at that time , because now I know that there are some new models with AMD processors .	St
1.10.1	suggest sending it back to emachines cuz it has 1 year warranty thing .	St

1.12.2	Ive done every thing that the tech service told me to do .	St
1.12.3	The T5026 is junk .	St
1.12.4	If you luked out and got a good one , good for you .	St

1.13.2	( I 'll know better next time ) .	St
1.14.1	Emachines have been producing pretty good computers in the last couple years with no more maintenance , problems , or lemons than any other computer factory % wise .	St
1.14.2	You have posted just 4 times since coming to CNet apparently just to rage/rant against Emachine .	St
1.14.3	What kind of computer do you now have , and why do n't you put the stats in your 'profile ' ( click on your name ) .	St
1.14.4	My wife has had a emachine for the past 3 years without a hint of trouble .	St
1.15.1	Nice for you and your wife .	St
1.15.2	The E junk that I have now is not a three year old out of date PC it 's suppose to be one of the best that they have and it did n't work right in the three months since I got it .	St
1.15.3	I do n't know what your WIFE dues with HER computer , but I need one that works .	St
1.15.4	Yeah I got a lemon thats not the point .	St
1.15.5	The Point is that they will not stand behind there product .	St
1.15.6	What good is a PC that you cant do any thing with ?	Ques
1.15.7	You tell me that ?	Ques
1.15.8	You did n't have any problems with your PC so I do n't think your qualified you say any thing .	St
1.15.9	Now when is time for you to buy your WIFE a new PC , You just go right on and buy another E junk and I hope it works for you , But if you luck out like a lot of other people Ive talked to , good luck trying to get it fixed .	St
1.16.1	This entire problem would be fixed if you just asked emachines for a new psu .	St
1.16.2	Either a direct replacement , or the better 350watt psu that costs $ 50 .	St
1.16.3	Not sure , but believe that any psu would fit in that emachines ( motherboard-wise ) , but not exactly case .	Res
1.17.1	will not be replaced with another emachine as she will get one of my other two ( non-emachine ) desktops when and if her current emachine starts to malfunction causing some $ 's .	St
1.17.2	She uses her ( $ 450 ) emachine every day for web surfing , printing , producing photo 's with a scanner , and has even made CD 's with it .	St
1.17.3	She also plays her type games on it , but will use my more powerful desktop for later high end games .	St
1.17.4	I am able to fix just about anything that may go wrong with my computers .	St
1.17.5	Have noticed through the years that the root of the majority of computer problems started with the operator .	St
1.17.6	Sorry to hear about your problems .	St
