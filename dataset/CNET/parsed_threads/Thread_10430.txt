<s> I've chatted with HP support and they suggested I buy a new printer. </s>
<s> It's an HP 1315v all in one and we're running XP. </s>
<s> It will print a full page on 20 lb paper but will only print two inches of the same image (with PSP) on 61 lb matte photo paper. </s>
<s> I've tried all the settings and the printer will pick up the matte paper, and it just stops printing but won't eject the paper itself, I have to push the on button for it to eject the paper. </s>
<s> I've never had this problem before and it's been a really good printer. </s>
<s> I blame the fact that I just spent $$ on new cartridges. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>

<s> But to test if the printer has failed is hard on owners. </s>
<s> We have to test it on another PC. </s>
<s> If the printer has failed then we get a cost estimate and compare that to the replacement cost. </s>

<s> Gotcha. </s>
<s> I've got a laptop around here somewhere I can test it on. </s>
<s> Never crossed my mind (where did I leave my mind anyway) to do that. </s>
<s> Thanks for the kick in the behind! </s>
