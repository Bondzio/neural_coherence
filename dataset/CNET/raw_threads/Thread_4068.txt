Currently the PC's is on a wired network, using router. and each printers are connected directly to a pc. I want to install those 3 printer on the network, so everyone can print without having any pc with a printer have to be on. I have search for USB printer Adapters, but only found 1 USB and 2 parallel adapter... (I need atleast 3 usb port) Questions: 1. Do I need to install printer drivers in every pc? 2. Are there such device available? or any suggestion? Thank You
