i have been trying for the last 2 weeks to get a vpn server going behind a router (linksys wrt100).
the router is connected to a cable modem which is fed by comcast.
i have signed up with no-ip.org to deal with the dynamic ip issue, and i can indeed ping my domain from anywhere and it resolved correctly to the ip i have from comcast.
behind the router i have a win 2003 server r2, which is configured as a remote access server.
indeed, i can use my laptop connected to the router via wifi to initiate and set up a vpn connection to the server.
so, the server should be ok. as soon as i try this from outside, i can't get it to work.
my vista laptop tells me that it found the domain and then that it is verifying user name and password.
after a couple of minutes i get a message that the connection could not be established.
no error numbers.
given the fact that i can do that behind the router, it looks like the requests are not reaching the server.
comcast told me that they are not blocking any ports, so the problem seems to be the router.
i have followed all description on how to set this up (put the server in dmz, enable vpn passthrough, forward ports, etc., but no luck.
anybody out there who has seen this and could provide some input?
thanks.
