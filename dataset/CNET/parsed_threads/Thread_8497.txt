<s> 1. back up the stuffs you can't afford to lose. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Move everything (including hidden files as well) from partition2 to partition3. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Make partition 2 as free space by deleting partition2. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Resize partition1/C: by absorbing all or part of the free space (in this case, it was part.2). </s>
<s> I suggest all of it. </s>
<s> Personally I have not work with this particular software before but seem like it could do this. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> changing/reallocating the disk space should be pretty easy and straightforward. </s>
<s> The first thing to do is backup any data you do not want or cannot afford to lose. </s>
<s> Next run Partition Wizard. </s>
<s> Usually the way to reallocate the space is to first reduce the space allocated from an adjacent partition. </s>
<s> For example....you would normally start by reducing E: from say 220GB to say 100GB. </s>
<s> You would take the space from &quot;E:&quot; from the side of &quot;E:&quot; between &quot;D:&quot; So E: would shrink by 120GBs whereafter you could expand &quot;D:&quot; to use that space. </s>
<s> Reboot the computer and check to see if the diskspace have been allocated as desired. </s>
<s> Assuming that worked as planned, start Partition Wizard and increase the &quot;D:&quot; partition to fill the free or unallocated space formerly allocated to &quot;E:&quot;. </s>
<s> D: would increase by 120GB for a total of 232GBs. </s>
<s> Reboot the computer and check to see if the diskspace have been allocated as desired. </s>
<s> Once you've done that .....start Partition Wizard again and shrink &quot;D:&quot; on the end between &quot;C:&quot; and &quot;D:&quot; by say 50GB. </s>
<s> Reboot the computer and check to see if the diskspace have been allocated as desired. </s>
<s> Last, start Partition Wizard and expand &quot;C:&quot; to fill the vacant space....roughly 50GBs, formerly allocated to &quot;D:&quot;. </s>
<s> Once again.....close Partition Wizard and reboot the computer and check to see if the diskspace have been allocated as desired. </s>
<s> Sounds complicated but it's really pretty easy if you think of it as taking contiguous space away from one partition making it available to the adjacent partition. </s>
<s> Any questions....we'll be here. </s>
<s> VAPCMD . </s>
<s> thank you for all the help managed it with partition wizard thanks again </s>
<s> Did the direction help or did you figure it out before ? </s>
<s> How did you end up splitting up the drive space ? </s>
