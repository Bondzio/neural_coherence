<s> In a previous post I got my CD burner working. </s>
<s> It's an HP CD burner in a BYTECC external USB case. </s>
<s> Was using wrong speed CD media. </s>
<s> In device manager the drive is listed as an LG CDRW CED-8080B drive, not the HP CD12i (12-10-32 speed) drive. </s>
<s> It's apparently the firmware in the case. </s>
<s> How can I get the drive to be recognized as an HP drive? </s>
<s> BTW, zero help at the BYTECC site, I have filed complaints. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I'm using this on two laptops, one XP Home the other 98SE. </s>
<s> &quot;I have HP cd12 cd-writer (software identified as cd12d, HP label marked as C9631). </s>
<s> Firmware version was LKS2. </s>
<s> But it was some problems with modern high-speed media, and I can't find newest firmware from HP (see ftp://ftp.hp.com/pub/information_st...tware/fwrev.bin - newest firmware version is OKS2 version, but it's not present on HP ftp). </s>
<s> Today I download newest firmware LS23 from Lite-On LTR-12101B (because one string on the writer case label is LTR-12101B)&quot; Just one of many examples where the dirty secret is HP doesn't make the drive. </s>
<s> They buy OEM units and re-label. </s>
<s> Your version of the HP CD12 (there are a through f?) </s>
<s> may indeed be this drive. </s>
<s> I'm sure that with some registry magic, you can have it show in the Device Manager as whatever you want, but I avoid such hoop jumping for reasons you can imagine. </s>

<s> I've never looked closely at the drive case until now. </s>
<s> It is listed as an LG CDRW CED-8080B drive!!! </s>
<s> Closer inspection shows it as a COMPAQ drive!!! </s>
<s> Son of a B****, I put the wrong drive in the case!!! </s>
<s> I found the HP drive in another box. </s>
<s> The Compaq drive was in the old HP drive box. </s>
<s> The HP drive was in the Sony box. </s>
<s> I feel so, stupid. </s>
<s> Tons of emails and complaints and it was my fault. </s>
<s> Time for a cold beer. </s>
<s> Thanks Robert for making me look closely. </s>
<s> &quot;Compaq drive was in the old HP drive box. </s>
<s> The HP drive was in the Sony box.&quot; What's in the Compaq box? </s>
<s> (the Sony?) </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The Compaq drive came with the PC. </s>
<s> It was a slow drive like the HP. </s>
<s> Sony 52-24-52 relpaced the Compaq drive. </s>
<s> Too confusing for me, but I've labeled the boxes with what drive is inside. </s>
<s> And now Device Manager in both laptops recognizes the HP drive, and the HP burning software works. </s>
<s> Cold beer time. </s>
