In XP, right click on 'My Computer' and selct 'Properties'. Choose the 'Computer Name' tab and click on 'Change'. Next, on your ME computer, turn on File sharing. Get there by opening 'Network' in the Control Panel. Finally, choose the folder(s) you would like to share: Open 'Windows Explorer' (Windows Key + E). Right click on the folder to be shared. Choose 'Sharing...' Turn on sharing in the window that opens, and your done!
