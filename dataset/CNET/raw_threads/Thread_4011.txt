If you do suspect the hardware then modems die often enough that the tech carries a spare to test with. Some will want tech to fix the old modem by reinstalling the OS, other means but at 120 bucks an hour the new modem seems the cheap exit. Bob

Your post has so little information that I can only offer vague fixes like reinstall the drivers, the OS, etc. Remember this is all volunteer so you get to apply yourself to make great posts with all the needed details. But as far as the hardware goes the only issue that I noted is done. Bob

Have you been the modem's manufacture website and see what they have to offer? what sites are you trying to go to ? Yahoo.com Google.com Cnet.com? If the page doesn't come up can you ping it. you have to go to a DOS prompt and type ping yahoo.com sense if a response is sent back.
