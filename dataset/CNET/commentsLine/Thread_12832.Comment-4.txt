a jet direct or other device will work best for several reasons.
1. cost.
i just purcahsed three intel netexpress print servers for about 15 dollars each.
each has three ports.
how much would a low end pc cost?
2. ease of setup.
the jet direct or net express or any of them really, usually have a nice and simple set up.
windows 2000 and up can usually set these up as ip ports or the device may even mimic an smb server.
in any case, they are diffrent, but still easy to set up.
how long will it take to set up a system devoted to being a prin server.
3. space and location.
a print server device is usually small, has minimal power requirements, never needs to be rebooted, and is in most cases invisible and silent.
i mount mine underneath tables, and you would never know they were there.
pc....not silent nor small.
and lots more cables needed.
************************************************ i could go on and on, but i would use a pc based print server to manage access and the spooler in medium or larger (over 15) user envirnments.
even then it would really be acting as a hub for print server devices.
