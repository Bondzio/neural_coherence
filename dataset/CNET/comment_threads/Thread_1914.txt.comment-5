don't the wireless routers have to be the same brand in order to accomplish this?
I had an old 802.11b wireless router and I tried adding it (mainly for the extra broadcast point) to my D-Link and they could never see each other..
I don't think I still have that old one, but I could certainly buy another DLink if that would work.. that would also help my signal issues I have down here as well.... if I knew it would work.
