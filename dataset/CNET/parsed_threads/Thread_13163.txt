<s> I just finished building a system with an Ultra Tower case, an Intel D975XBX mobo, a Pentium D processor, and an MSI Radeon 1300 video card. </s>
<s> Everything works fine, except for the audio. </s>
<s> I cannot get any sound our of the back panel ports. </s>
<s> Aditionally, the Front Panel audio cables that came with the case are seven cables independently labeled Mic Power, Mic In, Ear R, Ear R, Ear L, Ear L, and GND. </s>
<s> Because they are inidvidual cables, I don't know how they would map onto the motherboard's audio headers, which are label differently: (Pin 1) Port1L, (2) GND, (3)Port1R, (4)Presence#, (5) Port2R, (6) Sense1_Ret, (7) Sense_send, (8) Key (no pin), (9) Port2L and (10) Sense2_ret. </s>
<s> No help from either Ultra or Intel, can someone help? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>

<s> Pin 1 = Port1L = Mic In/Mic2 Pin 2 = Ground = Ground/AGnd Pin 3 = Port1R = MicPower/Mic1 Pin 4 = Presence# = Not Used Pin 5 = Port2R = Right Output/Speaker Pin 6 = Sense1_Ret = Right Output/Speaker/jumper ---------------------------together w/pin5 Pin 7 = Sense_Send = Not Used No Pin 8 Pin 9 = PortL = Left Output/Speaker Pin 10= Sense2_Ret = Left Output/Speaker/ jumper ---------------------------together w/pin9 </s>
<s> Thank you very much. </s>
<s> This is just the info I was looking for. </s>
<s> Right on the money! </s>
<s> Does your microphone work OK? </s>
<s> Typically I have used a boom mic placed on the desktop. </s>
<s> With this mobo I had to hold the boom mic next to my lips to get any pick up at all. </s>
<s> Tried switching to headset and attached microphone and still can only just get faint pickup. </s>
<s> Same problem with front panel and rear panel connectors. </s>
<s> Adjusted everything than I can see and can make it no better. </s>
<s> Machines is multi boot with xp pro and xp pro x64. </s>
<s> Same problems on both. </s>
<s> Wonder if it is some issue with the Intel supplied audio software but there is no way to uninstall that I can find so short of re-installing whoile OS that can't be done - close to doing that as I am a Skype user and this machine cannot be used for that the way it is Any ideas? </s>
