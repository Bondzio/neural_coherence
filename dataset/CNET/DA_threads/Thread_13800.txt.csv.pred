1.2.3	I do n't see it say anywhere that its a removable drive .	St
1.2.4	Hope this helped .	St
1.3.1	in the drive 's Policies ( Device Manager , Disk Drives , Properties , Poilicies tab ) , you can configure the write caching as safe removable as & quot ; optimize for quick removal & quot ; or & quot ; optimize for performance & quot ; .	St
1.3.2	if optimizing for performance , a write cache will be setup in the OS and you 'll need to use the & quot ; Safely Remove Hardware & quot ; icon to save any pending data .	St
1.3.3	the quick removal option will allow you unplug the drive once the activity led turn off .	St
