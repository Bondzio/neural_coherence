There are multiple copies and usually the amount of data is greatly reduced to the current needs, rather than a prolonged storage overs yrs. as example. I do however, like the fact, that once I upgrade to a new HD, I keep the old HD &quot;as is&quot; for several months not only as a safe return if something happens on new HD install but as a back-up version as well. Once safe and sound, that old HD gets re-used. tada -----Willy

Very easy to use. Never done a restore, but there is a restore dvd that I created and should work fine :-/ Restoring a file from backups is just toooo easy. Just dive into the backup file, and browse round to the dated version that you want.

But I am told I should also make a system image so I just bought some DVDs to record one on. Might also try a data backup to CD or DVD.
