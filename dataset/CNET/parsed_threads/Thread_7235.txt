<s> I really don't want to research this, so was hoping for a quick answer from all you techies. </s>
<s> I am going to Europe end of June and want a tablet (Ipad or Xoom) to take as its less bulky than a laptop. </s>
<s> I will be taking videos with my FLIP video camera and want to upload since amount of video is limited to about 3 hours on the FLIP. </s>
<s> I see the Xoom has a USB port, does the Ipad also? </s>
<s> What recommendations can you give me? </s>
<s> &quot;I really don't want to research this&quot; I won't fuss at you too much over this, but to ask someone else to do the work for you because you don't feel like it irritates a fair amount of people. </s>
<s> Trying to find some answers yourself will usually help you learn more and it will make people think more highly of you. </s>
<s> That is all I've got to say about it. </s>
<s> Anyway, I am fairly certain that you don't have to have any special software to use the Flip camera. </s>
<s> I think all you have to do is drag the files off of the device. </s>
<s> the iPad 1 or 2) does not have a USB port. </s>
<s> The Motorola Xoom does, but I am not completely sure of whether it has mass storage support. </s>
<s> The Motorola Xoom has a 32GB internal memory, and part of that is dedicated to the operating system. </s>
<s> I don't know how much is usable. </s>
<s> I should have said, I did do some research and came up empty and didn't feel like pressing on anymore and thought I'd throw it out there for the experts to respond. </s>
<s> Sorry if I offended you, and thanks for the information you were able to supply. </s>
<s> And then quickly note http://androidcommunity.com/motorola-xoom-gets-usb-host-feature-use-usb-drives-and-keyboards-hack-20110310/ in which it's HACKED to give you USB HOST capability. </s>
<s> My advice is to wait till more Android pads roll out. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Waiting &quot;until the roll out&quot; seems to be a never ending story. </s>
<s> I'm a multiply disabled guy who is homebound. </s>
<s> Fortunately for me, my town has blanket-wifi ... </s>
<s> I don' need no frakking 3/4G. </s>
<s> :-P. I don't want an iPad that costs more and has no USB, SD slot or Adobe Flash, a Kindle DX costs so much yet does so little & just 1 to 2 hundred more, sometimes less, gets me allot mores features. </s>
<s> I do my due-diligence and google my froogle in research, but for a 10&quot; Android 3.0 the date of release gets further and further away, &quot;December 2010, OK maybe January 2011, just kidding, it's February. </s>
<s> We lied it's March ... April Fool's!&quot; I'm getting tired of it. </s>
<s> Sure there is the Mortola Xoom, but the price is REALLY high. </s>
<s> I'm looking at the Notion Ink, Asus ep101tc, maybe the cheaper wifi only Xoom that's supposedly coming, but I'm growing impatient </s>
<s> You did find that with a hack you got the Xoom to do that trick but if a month or two is too long why not Xoom? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It took me a year to save my $600, the Xoom, at it's price now, is way to high. </s>
<s> I could buy a laptop for less. </s>
<s> Even if I put the rest on my 25% apr card, it'd still take a huge bite out of my mothly budget. </s>
<s> The only good part of waiting so long is my tablet saving build. </s>
<s> Why a tablet at all? </s>
<s> Why not the usual 399 buck dell laptop? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'm a big reader and with my poor coordination (you should see my typos before I correct) and a laptop is a bit cumbersome to read with comfortably. </s>
<s> Even Large Print fonts now are only 20 minutes a day (PC Kindle now). </s>
<s> They are also awkward to carry at doctors and in the hospitals. </s>
<s> I'm just going to read via kindle, check mail, view the jpg's family sends and maybe, hulu.com and games.com. </s>
<s> I would have bought a laptop as I do the above plus writing, surfing and Publisher. </s>
<s> but someone bought me this Hurl-it Crapperd, and when you make less than 940 a month, free is better and you look for the best bang for your buck. </s>
<s> Like I said, multiple disabilities: 100% deaf, just shy of legally blind, wheelchair bound, partial paralysis and numbness. </s>
<s> After extreme financial & housing abuses by trustees (formerly known as brothers) I now look for the best I can get for what I have to spend. </s>
<s> After all this, the iPad is great and soon, real soon, there will be more droids that will peak everyone's interest. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I just saw the Xoom Wifi-only is supposedly going to be released on the 22 or 27th (I've seen both). </s>
<s> I'll pre order as soon as it's official. </s>
