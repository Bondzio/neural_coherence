Hello my name is Marcelo, and I m planning on buying a pc for video editing, gaming, and I work with raphic programs like photoshop and illustrator; so I would need a pretty powerfull pc, besides I love computers and I would like a powerfull pc, because some people tell me that I dont need that much of a powerfull machine, but I want one anyway. So my budget is kind of thight, well I'm planning on spending less than $1500, (just in the tower). Because I'm from Uruguay, and I am an international student on the SRJC in Santa Rosa, Ca. So I'm planning to take the computer back to Uruguay with me, and I cant take the monitor, keyboard, speakers, etc. This is a quote I was given here in Santa Rosa, that I tought it was pretty good but somebody else told me it was pricy, and that I could get a much better and cheap pc if I build it myself. &quot;Xtreme Pcs&quot; CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo Processor E6400 2.13GHz ($266-$292) 1066MHz 2MB (I would like the 2.66GHz one, or at least the 2.40GHz one) RAM: GeIL 2GB (2x1gb) 240-pin DDR2 SDRAM ($188-$206) DDR2 800 (pc2 6400)Unbuffered Dual Channel Kit System Memory Model (I would like at least 3 gb) Video Card: ($156-171$) XFX nVidia GeForce 7600GT 256MB 580MHz 2DVI/HDTV PCI-Express Video Card (I really dont know about this) Sound Card: (not inclded in quote) We didnt specify one but, I would like to get one maybe a soundblaster? (I dont know how much are them) HD: ($183-201$) HITACHI Deskatar T7K250 HDT722516DLA380 250x2 GB 7200RPM 8MB Cache SATA 3.0GB/s Hard Drive-OEM (I know this is a lot of storage space, but as I gonna be working with video and .pdf files I will need it) (I dont know if I should get a fastet RPM for such a big amount of storage space) CD/DVD: ($38-$42) Samsung 18x Double Layer DVD+/-RW Internal Drive I would like 2, both with lightscribe and that burn all kind of cds and dvds. Motherboard: ($105-$115) Intel BULKD946GZISSL Core 2 Duo/946GZ/ MATX Motherboard Case: ($85-$103) I would just like a good looking one with a lot of ports in the front, like at least 1 firewire, 2 usb 2.0, and stuff for video and audio. So that is the quote they gave me, in the prices the one on the left is the actual price, and the one on the right is what they charge me for it (they charge 10% of the hardware), and they charge me $100 to build it. So in total this would be $1464, (without sound card, and maybe one more gb of ram). I would really appreciate your help, any suggestions are welcome. PS&gt;I cant really buy stuff online because I dont have a credit card, and I dont like doing it either.

Then use that info as guide for putting together the computer. Make sure the computer's power supply will work in Uruguay. You may need to pick up a power filter system just to get it to work in Uruguay. Make sure you can get updates where you live in Uruguay. I bought software that would not work out of the box without being updated. Some computer parts stores will do COD (cash on delivery). Perhaps you can setup an account before you go back. Self build is best if you have the know how but built to order is allot easier. As to the price list in your post I can not say good or bad. In the computer world of pricing a price quote is like a letter written on the sand of the waters edge while the tide is coming in. Price the parts out at a site like NewEgg or Tigerdirect. Then try to beat it at Dell, or HP built to order site. Watch out for the shipping charges.

That processor is available online for $225. $40 isn't the end of the world, but when you're on a budget ALL students are on a budget; lol), every dollar matters. 2) Why 3GB of RAM? By getting 3x1GB sticks, you won't be able to have dual-channel. I'd stick with 2x1GB for now, and then, when Windows Vista comes out, MAYBE upgrade to 4GB. 3) 7600GTs are available for as little as $110 online, on sites such as newegg.com. 4) Get a different brand of hard drive, as Hitachis aren't known for being reliable. Another name for the Deskstar is the Deathstar. 5) For the case, I'd get anything made by Lian-Li or Antec. 6) For the power supply, I'd get an Antec TruePower 430 watt. If you're not up to building a computer, you should look at Monarch Computer , as you can choose every individual component (down to the RAM and power supply), and they'll build it for you and ship it to you.

I bought one 3 years ago and it died in 4 months. It was still under warranty so got another one. It died in 13 months. Got a Western Digital and have not had one problem with it in the last 2 1/2 years. Newegg lists a 250 gig with 16mg cache for less than $80.00. It also shows a 500 gig with 16 mg cache for less than $200.00 if you wanted to go really big.

I'd go for the 2.4GHz one, as it's the cheapest one with 4MB L2 cache. Newegg lists a 250 gig with 16mg cache for less than $80.00. Newegg lists a Seagate 7200.10 320GB (Perpindicular Recording) for $95. It's faster, more reliable, and holds more.
