bare with me guys and gals, i am at work and to not have direct access to my computer but have a slight issue.
i bought a sony vaio new august of 2004. great computer!
i have nero installed with dvd shrink.
whenever i go to burn a dvd, it burns 100% succesful but when i play it it play the first 30 sec broken up than cuts off (stops).
i am using memorex 8x dvd's, is it possible that i just did not adjust the burn settings on nero and just burning to fast(write speed) any help would be great!
