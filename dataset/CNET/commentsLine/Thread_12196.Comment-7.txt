thank you for the input.
i don't think i will need any password management, profiles, software distribution or anything else... since it is a home office i pretty much know everyone who will be on the network... just the nas is probably right for me.
i am looking for just speed and storage, and being that i'm not an expert in networking i want to keep it as simple as possible.
i think i will try to look into those buffalo boxes, they might be exactly what i need.
my only concern with just having the nas would be keeping it off the internet so the rest of the world can't access it.
i need to look into firewalls.
i will do my home work before i buy and set anything up... just off the top of my head i think all i need, along with the computers i set up, would be a router/switch of some type to plug my cable modem into.
2 or more of those nas boxes.
and about 2 printers.
i understand the wireless would not be as fast as a wired connection, but wireless is nice too have outside of the ''office''.
from what you have said i don't think i need a server for anything... just make sure everything is gigabit and my needs should be met.
unless i misunderstood everything you all told me.
lol.
thanks again.
