<s> I recently bought a Seagate 160 GB external HD to use as a backup. </s>
<s> Prior to this I would save any documents on floppies but now with digitial photos and program disks missing (not lost just temporarily misplaced), I wanted to be able to do a full backup. </s>
<s> When I used the XP Backup Wizard I received an error stating that I could not create a file lager than 4GB due to FAT32 formatting on the external drive. </s>
<s> My question is there someway around this in Backup; do I have to reformat the external drive in NTFS or do I have to buy 3rd party software? </s>
<s> Thanks, Rick </s>
<s> What feature does MSBACKUP have that is worthy? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I assume that if a virus struck my computer, that I could just reformat the hard drive, drag and drop back from my external drive and everything would work OK. </s>
<s> I thought that MSBACKUP would compress everything and simplify the restore process. </s>
<s> Rick </s>
<s> MSBACKUP can't restore to a blank drive. </s>
<s> At least with simpler copy methods, all your files are saved. </s>
<s> -&gt; Maybe a solution like ACRONIS should be explored? </s>
