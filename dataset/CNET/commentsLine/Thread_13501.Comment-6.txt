yo guys .. thanks a tonne!
i dint have any encryption software and all my properties in windows and linux were fine.
i contacted apacer however and they sent me a link to this puny low level formatter .. it did de trick and now my drive is working again.. thanks a lot again.. i am posting the link here for anyone else who has the same problem.
it seems to work only on apacer .. maybe only the ht 202 .
read the readme before using it.
