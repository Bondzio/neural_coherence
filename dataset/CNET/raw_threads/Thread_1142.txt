Well see what you guys can make of this.I got my new pc for xmas(X2 4800, GTX 7800, and 2GBs of RAM) and i love it but i have a few problems with some games like battlefield vietnam. I cant play it for more then 5 mins before it just freezes up and i have to alt,ctrl,del. I have tried getting all the patches but it still freezes i even tried BF2 and that worked great and so does FEAR and COD2. Which bring me to my next question.Why on some older FPS games like painkiller and chronicles of riddick do i walk really fast almost like skipping around. my card has the new driver too. let me know what you guys think thanks, nick
