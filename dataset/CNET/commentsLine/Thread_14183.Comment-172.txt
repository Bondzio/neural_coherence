friends and myself had a number of early personal computers- atari 800/800xl, vic-20, c-64, timex/sinclair 1000, commodore 16/+4, not to mention the early video game consoles- atari 2600/5200, magnavox odyssey2, colecovision, intellivision, and the best system at the time- the original nintendo nes.
most of these golden age home computers have emulators available that run pretty well on a pc, you just need to do some searching to find them.
ie: for c-64 try the vice emulator-  and there's good emulators for atari and other computers as well.
