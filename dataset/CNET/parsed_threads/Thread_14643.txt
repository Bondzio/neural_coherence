<s> Hello, I am someone who basically knows nothing about routers in general and need help. </s>
<s> I have a Dell Dimension 8400 with XP and a Macbook on order. </s>
<s> I am looking at the Linksys WRT54GS, but I do not know how the desktop will connect wirelessly. </s>
<s> Do I need some sort of card or adapter? </s>
<s> I dont know anything. </s>
<s> Please be specific. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> Purchase a wireless NIC like this one: http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Product_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1115416826820&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper&lid=2682039789B01 Install it in an open PCI slot and voila. </s>
<s> Where are the PCI slots? </s>
<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_Component_Interconnect has a great shot of what they look like. </s>

<s> So that Linksys NIC will work with the Dell Dimension 8400? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> How do you get inside the computer? </s>
<s> And it's a Dell! </s>
<s> See http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-10163_7-6224085-1.html?tag=viddet </s>
<s> Does anybody know a video showing a NIC being put into a PCI slot? </s>
<s> Besides the video in the previous post. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> But inserting an AGP card is so much like your PCI card that if you can't use the above video I strongly suggest you take it to a shop and they'll install it for you. </s>

<s> I strongly appreciate all of the help. </s>
