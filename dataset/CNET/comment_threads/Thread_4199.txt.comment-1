Help me anyone, I recently had to reformat my computer due to a serious virus and in the process of re-installing my systems I put my HP printer disc into the system.
It used to work, or should I say, respond as soon as you wanted anything to print.But since I`ve got things back and running ok the printer takes about 20 mins to print anything off.
It says it`s printing when I check the status but I can`t wait that long for stuff, seeing as it WAS ok before hand.
I have downloaded Hp software, drivers and stuff to make it as it was but still no luck.. ANY IDEAS???
I`m desperate..
The disc I have with the software doesn`t make any difference.
Both inks are LOW and in need of refilling, will that make it slow down?
Or is it another issue?
Please help Wolfey
