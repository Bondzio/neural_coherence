<s> I have a motherboard that has 4 sata ports and 3 IDE ports for a total of 10 drives. </s>
<s> In order to power 10 drives I would want another power supply and a HUGE case. </s>
<s> I am thinking that making my own case would be the best option. </s>
<s> Any ideas on what I would need? </s>
<s> I need a material that is easy to work with and easy to assemble, as well as cheap and sturdy. </s>
<s> I was thinking of wood sanded with 2000 grit, wet clothed down to remove dust. </s>
<s> However the grounding properties of wood are non existant, this doesnt seem to be too much of an issue since I have seen cases of Lucite wich is also non cunductive. </s>
<s> I am confident wood isnt very 'static chargy' but want to make sure. </s>
<s> BTW, the dimensions of the case interior needs to be at least 40cm wide X 75cm tall X 50cm deep </s>

<s> I started on a wood case but I had to think about cooling. </s>
<s> A server case would handle your needs. </s>
<s> Material I would chosse aluminum, releases heat well. </s>
<s> So when all your equipment is runnig it would not take much to get rid off the heat that is in the case. </s>

<s> Linkit, thanks for the link, that helps me in thinking about how to design it. </s>
<s> The metal bits I can remove from another case addresses the problem of mounting the mobo. </s>
<s> I have looked at ebay and did look through ALL the server cases. </s>
<s> I have tried xiode and zip zoom fly too. </s>
<s> Just not enough room. </s>
<s> I need 10 3.5'' bays for hard drives, and 4 for floppy drives (eei expansions) and 2 for CD ROMS. </s>
<s> I need it like that becuase eventually this 3700 AMD will be a relic but the mobo, with the ability to handle 10 hard drives, will be usefull for years to come. </s>
<s> With 10 400 GB hard drives, I could have a 4 TB server. </s>
<s> Thanks again linkit. </s>
<s> It is still bothering me that I can't think of where I found an even better wood case that I saw a couple months ago. </s>
<s> Will post it if I can get rid of my cerebral cobwebs. </s>
<s> I have finished some initial designs, each pic is perfectly to scale, one pixel= 1 mm. </s>
