if the card is still under warranty stick with ati's overclock programs.
see if documentation states if you overclock the warranty is still good.
i would think that with all ati's knowledge that if they release overclock tools/program you should be all right.
if the programs from ati don't seems to make it happen than go looking, but if you have a warranty still in effect stay with ati programs and drivers.
