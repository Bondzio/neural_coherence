<s> I just read about an interesting font, called &quot;Ecofont.&quot; It supposedly saves 20% of the typical ink used by a laser printer. </s>
<s> The site is here: http://www.ecofont.eu/look_at_ecofont_en.html Anyways, I'm wondering about this claim. </s>
<s> It is made on the basis that the letters in this font have small white circles throughout the letters, which is plainly visible if you print it in a large font size; and barely so at 12 point font. </s>
<s> My question--will this in fact save ink? </s>
<s> I have looked at the Draft mode within MS Word, but that hardly is any different from the normal mode. </s>
<s> My laser printer (HP 1018) has an &quot;economode&quot; setting which obviuosly uses less ink, but is a bit of an eyesore. </s>
<s> I hand out a lot of material that is hard to comprehend and I can't afford folks to be put off by a hard-to-read printout. </s>
<s> This appears to be the only real option I have to save ink, but I'm wondering--will this in fact save any ink? </s>
<s> Or is the mechanics of laser printing such that it really won't save anything? </s>
<s> If not, I'd rather not even bother with changing fonts from Times New Roman to this and then back again. </s>
<s> Any thoughts? </s>
<s> http://falcon.jmu.edu/~johns2ja/illusion/onlywhitecirclesatintersections.gif I think it's a great idea but needs work to avoid the optical illusion and visual issues. </s>

<s> Let me guess...you installed the font but didn't like what you saw? </s>
<s> It looks pretty crummy on a word processor but it prints out just fine. </s>
<s> Or was this your way of saying that this claim of saving 20% is just an illusion? </s>
<s> It may work. </s>
<s> But I'm not going to test it. </s>
<s> The method is as old as the printing press so let's not think this is a new idea. </s>
<s> I see the optical illusion issue and dug up a picture to show the issue. </s>
<s> What I am saying is the font needs work. </s>
<s> But the premise is sound. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> See this link. </s>
<s> He says that any ink savings depends on what font you typically print with. </s>
<s> He calculates (by comparing pixels to dots of ink on a paper) that serif fonts (Times New Roman is the most common serif font) actually consume a lot less ink than this font, though. </s>
<s> However, compared to some sans serif fonts, you can save 20%--but again, the savings depend on what font you use. </s>

<s> EcoFont is a step in the right direction. </s>
<s> Not only ink is expensive, the printers do a great job spending it! </s>
<s> I recently found a software utility, PretonSaver Home, that &quot;turns&quot; every font to eco-font. </s>
<s> It reduces ink consumption by up to 70% and provides excellent print quality. </s>
<s> I did not have to change the fonts I use or change the way I print. </s>
<s> PretonSaver works in the background and very smartly optimizes the ink/toner used by my printers. </s>
<s> Try it for free. </s>
<s> Download PretonSaver from halftheink.com ( http://www.halftheink.com ) </s>
<s> Eco-fonts or control of inkjets isn't new, but the principal is sound. </s>
<s> The basis of using ink in the 100% use of the nozzles will produce ink overrun(excess) which in turn makes for a solid printed output. </s>
<s> What is typical of so-called ink control is the non-firing of adjacent ink nozzles causing less ink usage and the &quot;ink overrun&quot; will still cover the missed spaces and for most fonts being used appear OK or at least for plain text offer reasonable results. </s>
<s> Alot depends on the font being used, the paper, and printer printhead in general. </s>
<s> If a printhead has say, 50 ink nozzles will show better results than one with 40. </s>
<s> The paper itself due to &quot;ink sop&quot; or ink absorbing quality. </s>
<s> As for the font itself, they lend a pattern for output to be done and if less dense, on its own merits becomes less effective is even more non-print pattern is followed. </s>
<s> Savvy??? </s>
<s> To answer your question, yeah they do work. </s>
<s> But, to what degree is up to the ink control(driver) being used. </s>
<s> The eco-font in question is just proving a print pattern(bit map) that is using less ink nozzles to create that font. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
