check the results in this article here: http://www.anandtech.com/casecooling/showdoc.aspx?i=3010&p=3 btw, if you haven't purchased the cpu and mobo yet, look into a p35 based mobo.
they support 1333mhz fsb and will almost automatically OC any 1066mhz core2duo by 25%.
so a q6600 ($500) will hit 3ghz with little to no tweaking.
that's pretty close to your target but saves you $450.
