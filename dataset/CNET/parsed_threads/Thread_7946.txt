<s> Specs : http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c00487776&lc=en&cc=us&dlc=en&product=1140029 Upgraded memory to 2 Gb and added slave I had the same problem a year ago, crashes, freezes, Windows wouldn't load after restart. </s>
<s> I tried reloading XP and it didn't solve the problem. </s>
<s> I ended up replacing the HD and it worked well until about a month ago. </s>
<s> Freezes,crashes and so far, XP is still loading, but it looks like it may be getting to the fail point again. </s>
<s> The computer is not used for gaming or anything like that. </s>
<s> The HP &quot;help&quot; database suggests because I added the extra HD, it is causing more heat. </s>
<s> Is the heat the likely problem? </s>
<s> What else could be causing this? </s>
<s> I have had the side panel of the computer off for about three months, the room is on the cool side, there is no dust. </s>
<s> Is the HD really damaged or can it be fixed? </s>
<s> Many a small case is prone to cooling problems. </s>
<s> Even with proper fan placement, the addition of added devices and their disruptive &quot;air flow&quot; will defeat some system cooling. </s>
<s> In other words, it works great then you add a new device which adds extra heat and is stuffed next to another device which in turn causing the air flow pattern to change. </s>
<s> So, either add an extra case fan or make extra exhaust hole(s), fan or leave case cover off. </s>
<s> With everything giving a certain amount of heat build-up when added exceeds the current cooling applied. </s>
<s> take into account that heat stress will lessen the stability of the psu outputs, which in turn causes stress to installed devices. </s>
<s> Once the stress reaches a certain level its becomes damaged but may work but is too close to a failure level and is easily tripped causing endless troubleshooting and really only device replacement narrows it down. </s>
<s> I usually replace the psu with a dual-fan setup and above the current psu wattage rating. </s>
<s> Next, I try to cool better with more fans and of course clean it out. </s>
<s> Since, you already have cover off, its very possible some device is already damaged and needs replacement, again or another one. </s>
<s> Sorry, too often parts swap is quick and easy for the fix. </s>
<s> If the HD is damaged, try using the maker's diags for demanding tests and if not good, use the warranty if still available. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> make sure PS is adequate to accept more devices. </s>
<s> These packages tend to be thin in that department. </s>
<s> The info also says SATA drive. </s>
<s> I presume you put in another SATA drive. </s>
<s> I've found these cables and connections to be awkward and fragile. </s>
<s> A poorly seated cable....even if just a little stressed to one side or another....can cause the drive to temporarily disappear and Windows will pause. </s>
<s> As an experiment, you can disconnect the second drive and see if Windows behaves better. </s>
<s> If it does not, that rules out the drive. </s>
<s> If problems cease, it's something about the drive. </s>
<s> It could be extra current drain or a poor connection. </s>
<s> As well, as a CPU heats, it will slow down in an attempt to further heat up and damage itself. </s>
<s> the problem is the second HD,is it likly that its removal would solve the problem? </s>
<s> During use, check by touching the HD, if it is really, really hot and uncomfortable to touch, you got heat and a pending HD failure. </s>
<s> BUT, HDs do get warm. </s>
<s> Physical relocate the HD outside(safety route) of the case but still connected and test away or operate that way, if problems lessen or gone, you have a heat issue. </s>
<s> BUT!, understand, if the problem is &quot;iffy&quot; from heat it just doesn't fail diags or only comes under intense usage, the problem has arisen and the HD is at fault. </s>
<s> As known from the other poster, reseat the HD connects as well several times, SATA cables do cause problems, use another to test. </s>
<s> As to replacing the HD outright, that's up to you, if no testing or continued tips/hints/clues seem to help. </s>
<s> Remember, the problem has come back, thus all the previous info should be applied to keep the &quot;new HD&quot; up and running. </s>
