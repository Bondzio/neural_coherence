1.1.1	I heard before that if you add any more memory over 1gig it will not improve performance e.g .	St
1.1.2	games .	St
1.1.3	and that it is usually used for servers .	St
1.1.4	would going from 1 gig to 2 gig make a difference in games like doom 3 hl2 bfv and rtcw : et ?	Ques
1.2.1	today for most games 512 mb is enough .	St
1.2.2	1gb is excellent and 2gb is basically unnecessary right now and a waste of money .	St
1.3.1	Currently 2gbs is useless for gaming .	St
1.3.2	But your money would be best spent on other parts .	St
1.3.3	What parts do you have now ?	Ques
1.4.1	p4 3ghz intel 915g mobo , 512 x 2 dual channel 400MHz , i want to upgrade the ram to corsair xms pc3200 512 x 2 , with lower latency .	St
1.4.2	would this improve performance over stock ram ?	Ques
1.4.3	Thanks	Polite
1.5.1	With your hardware , how can it get any better ?	Ques
1.5.2	As was mentioned , over one Gig is overkill unless you 're producing , ripping , converting , and burning DVDs .	St
1.5.3	Maybe your monitor is not up to the task .	St
1.5.4	Most people never consider upgrading the monitor .	St
1.5.5	If the pitch is .28 or above , a Terabyte of ram wo n't help .	St
1.5.6	How about your graphic card ?	Ques
1.5.7	A bare bones card is the easiest to replace , and with a good monitor the results can be spectacular .	Sug
1.5.8	Just some thoughts .	St
1.6.1	on intel lower latencies barely affect performance .	St
1.6.2	On an amd processor ( which is much faster than an intel on nearly all games in existance ) they benefit from lower latencies .	St
1.6.3	Fortunately if you have 2gbs on an amd you will not have any lower performance .	St
1.6.4	An athlon 64 processor has such a high bus speed ( thanks to hyperthreading ) that it would take many sticks of ram to for it to bottleneck your ram .	St
1.6.5	For example the FX-55 has a clock speed of 2.6GHz , the bus speed would also be 2.6GHz .	St
1.6.6	Perhaps you would also be thinking of a new video card ?	Ques
1.7.1	3 ghz is pretty low by today 's standards .	St
1.7.2	It 's the second lowest speed for intels p4s that run on that chipset .	St
1.8.1	but not AMD , whos processors are all under 3Ghz .	St
1.8.2	Even though it 's the second slowest P4 it 's more than adequate in today 's world .	St
1.8.3	Once again we are accustomed to the American ideal that more is better !	St
1.8.4	But its not .	St
1.8.5	Even Intel has realized that now .	St
1.9.1	NIL	St
1.10.1	x800xl pci express graphics card and sony 17 in flat panel monitor	St
1.11.1	not everything is soley dependant on the cpu .	St
1.11.2	i really dont care that i have an intel .	St
1.11.3	my games run fine with everything on high settings and high resolution .	St
1.11.4	( over 60 fps ) EVEN WITH AN INTEL CPU .	St
1.11.5	i have a very good graphics card ( ati radeon x800xl ) and my monitor works just fine for games .	St
1.11.6	so i really dont care for amd .	St
1.11.7	because i just bought my pc and i am not going to go run out and build an amd system just to get a few more fps .	St
1.12.1	Did i say everything ?	Ques
1.12.2	No .	St
1.12.3	Anyway you cant always look at the clock speeds , a 2.6 ghz athlon 64 will give you more frames per second than a 3.8ghz pentium 4 .	St
1.12.4	Athlon 64s also run much cooler and quieter .	St
1.13.1	sry but heat isnt an issue for me .	St
1.13.2	BTX case and mobo = 2 120mm fans .	St
1.13.3	anyway , i can always upgrade my cpu to a faster p4 with the new 64 bit support .	St
1.13.4	it just is useless now	St
