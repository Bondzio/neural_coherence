I have an Acer AL1916fbd , and I was wondering how I would go about connecting a videogame console with component outputs to my LCD. The recommended resolution on my monitor is 1280x1024. I have heard that I should get a VGA Box, Scan Converter, Transcoder... I dunno , I believe these are different names for the same type of product. Can anyone help me?? Thanks!!

If you've got a classic Xbox, vga adapters were made but they seem to have disappeared -- check ebay If your console has component outputs, ebay has transcoder for about $50 but i don't know how good/bad the picture quality will be. http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=320047652598 (or search for &quot;ps2 vga&quot;)

Don't get me wrong , I get stuff on Ebay all the time, but I want to get something name-brand I can trust. Any other suggestions? Where IS everybody on this board?!? This topic has been on the front page fro 2 days...
