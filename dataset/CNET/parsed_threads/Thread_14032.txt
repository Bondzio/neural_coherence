<s> My system has killed two power supply units in about a year and a half. </s>
<s> This last one was a 800W. </s>
<s> I am only running a dual core AMD. </s>
<s> I am running a higher end video card but nothing 800W wouldnt be able to handle. </s>
<s> I think the other one was a 500W. </s>
<s> Any thoughts? </s>
<s> are you using a good UPS or surge suppessor? </s>
<s> Yeah I have it in a surge protector. </s>
<s> it's next-to-impossible for a PC that's functioning normally to &quot;kill&quot; a power supply every few months. </s>
<s> an electrical problem in the PC would cause it to perform erractically if at all. </s>
<s> however, bad AC power can cause a power supply to fail and a cheap surge suppressor won't clean up bad power. </s>
<s> Having 2 bad psus, isn't the end of the world but can suggest the &quot;outside world&quot; can be having an effect. </s>
<s> Meaning, that bad power AC as Ramac mentioned could be at fault. </s>
<s> A simple surge protector is NOT meant to last forever. </s>
<s> In fact if the surge protector got hit, its good just for &quot;1 time&quot; for its rating. </s>
<s> It may still allow AC to flow but the protection is gone. </s>
<s> Better surge protectors offer a LED showing being active and NOT just AC present. </s>
<s> Further, considering your hi-wattage 800W psu that got pasted, a decent UPS is probably needed as well. </s>
<s> If possible a good &quot;AC line conditioner&quot; too as even more protection. </s>
<s> While psu rating are a good starting point to check the specs, a true decent psu provides also its RMS value or true level(basic) of proper stable wattage output, usually lower than the rating. </s>
<s> Many times the rating offered is &quot;peak&quot; and a psu shouldn't be operating at peak for long periods, again being stressed. </s>
<s> Taking nothing for granted, good cooling is very much desired. </s>
<s> Have ample cooling to the system case so its doesn't set-up the psu to fail. </s>
<s> Lacking cooling and improper venting will cause a psu to stress-out and fail quicker. </s>
<s> Last, psu specs should offer the &quot;rail voltages/amps&quot; as any voltage once comprised will bring down the psu. </s>
<s> Thus, dual rails offer to spread the voltage demands to other components so no lone component(s) is having to do all the work. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
