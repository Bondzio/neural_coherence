Something to note is that people are sniping for college students: there are lots of big markups that you'll encounter.
Avoid AT ALL COSTS the college bookstore.
They will mark you up no matter what.
Get the Mac you get at Pricegrabber or AppleSliced.com, those sites will save you $$$ through easy prices.
As far as which one you get, that depends on the major, as other commenters have said.
