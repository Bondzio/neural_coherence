The Asus P4P400-DLX(865 chipset) can support such, but be sure that your current DDRAM is of the right speed and pairs for dual channel operation or you'll likely get &quot;not much&quot; of a boost.
Also, the power supply has to have spare Watts to make it all stable and you'll get a new CPU heatsink/fan.
And finally the case has to let all the heat out.
