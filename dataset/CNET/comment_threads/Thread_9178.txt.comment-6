But the settings do not work for years.
Here's why.
My best example is how folk used to set up WEP for protection.
That's now broken in less than 2 minutes and for a short time MAC filtering provided a stop gap security measure.
These are now out dated so your settings can be outdated with some kid next door interfering with your system.
Go ahead and buy your new router but it seems a shame we can't update to today's advised settings first to see if we can avoid the replacement.
