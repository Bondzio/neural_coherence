I've updated the driver & had it confirmed on the HP website. I've also reinstalled the printer several times. Will appreciate any helpful suggestions.

Another posted here installed some Microsoft Windows Update and immediately began to have issues. They had taken the offer for a driver. They didn't think much of that, so we had to go a few rounds and eventually they called Emachines. The driver was rolled back. This may not be your issue, but not unheard of. Bob
