<s> I've just been given a solid state drive to test out (2.5 inch notebook style hard disk drive). </s>
<s> Can I use this with any operating system or am I limited. </s>
<s> I'm not sure were to find the information I'm looking? </s>
<s> Which would be the best? </s>
<s> Windows Vista/XP/2000? </s>
<s> Linux (which distributions would work best)? </s>
<s> I have two systems I could install the drive in, either a low-end desktop system or a midrange notebook. </s>
<s> Which would be the better way to go? </s>
<s> (I was leaning towards the low-end desktop over the notebook though I know it's probably overkill for the system). </s>
<s> Thanks for the input. </s>

<s> vista won't install on anything smaller than 10gb. </s>
<s> xp and 2000 will need about 4gb. </s>
<s> for linux, it will depend on the distro and the features you're planning but 4gb should be sufficient for most distros. </s>
<s> i think the notebook will benefit most from an ssd since a) it should improve battery life; b) the ssd's read/write speed may be faster than a run-of-the-mill notebook drive but slower than a recent desktop drive; c) the ssd should be a cinch to drop into the laptop. </s>
