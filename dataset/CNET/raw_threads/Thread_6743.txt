6486	0	341627	3038034	NR	bcrawford75	5/4/09 4:58 PM	1.24145628E12	reconmendation	Recommendation on a graphics card I have a Dell Dimension 4700 2.8ghz Pentium 4 1.75gb 305 watts. As of now I have no graphics card other then the integrated one on the board. I want to run Adobe CS3 (lightly, sketchup, and watch moives on my Dell Ultra sharp 24 monitor. Basically I want the most dedicated memory without upping the 305watts power source. (256mb?) And get the best resolution out of my monitor and cheap! I will eventually be retiring this computer for movies and music. It has a PCI express slot. Thank you very much for your advice. Brian

The Pentium 4 is an old processor using old architecture. Current Core 2 Duo or Core 2 Quad processors not only consume less power but will also give you a significant performance boost. For example, a Core 2 Quad 8300 can convert 29 Hi-res photos into a video slideshow more than 5X faster than a Pentium 4-630 (a 3.0 GHz processor. Also, most consumer software suites out there today are optimized to take advantage of multi-core processors. I realize that you probably cant upgrade your processor with your current MB, perhaps an investment in a new system would be worthwhile. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Full disclosure: TimWoodChip is an Intel employee and consumer PC expert.

The processor is fast enough to do what I want it to do: some graphic but mainly music and movies. With the existing computer I have, what would be the best video card I can put in for cheap that gets me max resolution (1920 x 1200 / 60 Hz)?

If you want a quick, cheap upgrade to accomplish your goals it would be a resonable option just to add a PCIE graphics card. May I suggest a Geforce 8600 based card such as http://www.techforless.com/cgi-bin/tech4less/PVT84JYAJG?mv_pc=google_base&tts=20090507020701 . It is not a power hog and it is not expensive and yet it delivers outstanding performance. Just my $.02 zonzin
