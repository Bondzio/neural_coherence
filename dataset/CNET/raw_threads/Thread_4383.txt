Thats why i come to places like these to get suggestions from people that are far smarter than i am. Anyway, i have a eMachines T2890. Sad, but its still a computer. http://emachines.com/support/product...es&model=T2890 Thats all the system specs for everything. Anyways, im looking to upgrade the computer so i can play some games. Im not talking top of the line games, but like World Of Warcraft and stuff like that. Ive already put a 512 ram card in it, so i have a grand total of 768mb of ram. Im looking for suggestions on other upgrades i should do to make my computer run games better. I was thinking about putting like a geforce 6800 in. Or maybe more ram. Any suggestions are appreciated. Also, with a video card, how do i check if its compatible with my computer? Remember, im not to literate when it comes to computer hardware.

It has no dedicated graphics slots (AGP or PCI Express X16). It does have 3 PCI slots. Bottom line: Looks like the best you can do is to add a PCI video card (not PCI Express X16 and not AGP).
