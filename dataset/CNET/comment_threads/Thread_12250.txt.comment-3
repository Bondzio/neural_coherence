If you're going to reuse it and just want to get rid of whatever is on it, you can just format that drive.
Of course if you're worried about other people seeing what's currently on it, you could always use something like DBAN.
If you do use something like DBAN, you'll need to follow Kees' advice and put a partition on it, format it, and assign a drive letter to it.
` Good luck.
