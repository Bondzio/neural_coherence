somewhere else, suggest backing up soonest.
the fact is ... the (external) hdd will die or fail at sometime and the question is will you have these important, one-of-kind files available on some other media.
take a moment to read thru the many many messages on the storage forum about problems with failed (external) hdds.
the alternative is data recovery services which are not cheap.
