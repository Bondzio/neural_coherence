listen to the proffit!
i learned the hard way.
windows xp does neither recognize nor use much above 2gb.
know this and believe it and then feel free to buy however much memory you think your system can hold and you wallet can afford.
i did (i had been informed previously, but forgot!)
and now i have a really nice storage place for my extra 2gb... they are very happy there in the memory slots doing nothing at all.
if anybody finds a way around that 2gb limit, i'd sure love to hear about it.
