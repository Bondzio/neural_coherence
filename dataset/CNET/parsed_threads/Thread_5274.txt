<s> Can anyone tell me how much importance I should put on an HD Gateway monitor/computer package, versus a similar comparable Hewlett Packard computer package with a regular lcd monitor. </s>
<s> I would prefer to buy the HP computer package, but for the price, I'm wondering if it would be better to stare at Gateway's HD monitor? </s>
<s> The computer deals are about the same, at bestbuy, so I was probably just going to get the better deal. </s>
<s> So since the deals are also about the same, should I just go with the High Definition Gateway Monitor even though I prefer hp? </s>
<s> Examples of possible Monitors: http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=8550551&productCategoryId=abcat0509000&type=product&tab=1&id=1188560797441#productdetail http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=8550551&productCategoryId=abcat0509000&type=product&tab=1&id=1188560797441#productdetail </s>
<s> your links are to the same monitor, but generally an &quot;HD&quot; LCD monitor can properly display a 720p HDTV signal. </s>
<s> if you ever plan to hook your monitor up to a cable box or dvd player, then get the HD monitor. </s>
<s> if it's only going to hooked up to your PC, then HD support shouldn't influence your purchase decision. </s>

<s> I too was about to buy the 30 inch HP monitor (After Reading the TrustedReviews.com) and I happened upon a review of the Gateway HD (At Gizmodo or was it Engadget.com) like yourself. </s>
<s> Did you go for the HP or the Gateway? </s>
<s> You guys are so lucky in the USA the Gateway product isn't even confirmed as coming to the UK! </s>
<s> I'm currently looking for someone who would be willing to purchase in the USA underage International shipping to the UK, so if you know anybody please let me know? </s>
<s> Just got to confirm that Gateway if my warranty would be affected, even though they don't have a base in the UK they do have only two retail partners in the form of Toys &quot;R&quot; Us and Tesco of all places! </s>
<s> Anyway just wondering how you are getting along your 30 inch baby? </s>
<s> Any thoughts that appreciated as I'm going from a 24 inch Dell 2405W so the upscaler tech in the Gateway seemed too good to pass over the HP get such good reviews as well? </s>
<s> it's such a shame that Best Buy do not ship internationally! </s>
<s> They even seem to have stuck in Gateway showed shipping date of the 12th of December is that information incorrect? </s>
<s> Any thoughts appreciated,Optical10 </s>
<s> sorry to tell you, but I haven't purchased anything quite yet. </s>
<s> I'm waiting until the holiday season to pick up a good deal. </s>
<s> I'm still in the hunt for either a decent hp or gateway, but haven't settled on either one yet. </s>
<s> Sorry, I couldn't be of more help. </s>
