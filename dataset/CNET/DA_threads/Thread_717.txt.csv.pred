1.1.1	I work (non-IT) for a company with several computers (98 to XP pro) and I dabble in PC repair on the side.	St
1.1.2	They have asked me to setup a backup system for approx.	St
1.1.3	10 machines.	St
1.1.4	About 20 computers exist on this network.	St
1.1.5	What they would like me to do is backup these computers nightly to a single computer that would solely be used for this purpose.	St
1.1.6	I know it's not the best or safest backup plan and I have expressed this to them.	St
1.1.7	At a subsidiary in another city a tech has done this for them and they seem happy with it.	St
1.1.8	I own 3 software backup programs that are not in use, so I would gladly sell them one ie..Norton Ghost 2003, Acronis True Image v8.0, and Stomp BackupMyPc.	St
1.1.9	I have in the past cloned my own drive, but I have not done nightly incremental backups before.	St
1.1.10	I want to do this for them, but I have no idea exactly how to do it.	St
1.1.11	My questions....I know its probably a detailed procedure, but does anyone feel like walking me through this in simple terms or can anyone direct me to a site that describes this process in easy to understand language.	St
1.1.12	Secondly, would one of my programs be the way to go or should I use Windows own automated backup (this is what was used in the aforementioned 'other' city).	St
1.1.13	It seems to me that either way this should not be such a difficult task, but it certainly has me confused.	St
1.1.14	I hope someone can help me.	St
1.1.15	I really want to do this for them as I could win some brownie points with my employer.	St
1.1.16	I've googled this and have found very little in the tutorial area and what I have found was incomplete or very difficult to comprehend.	St
1.1.17	Most sites do not really recommend this plan as a great backup method, therefore offer little or no help.	St
1.1.18	Also the tutorials/help files in the above programs seem quite vague and again some what incomplete for a novice.	St
1.1.19	My boss may not want to backup 10 machines, I was guessing, however I am certain that he would like to backup at least one.	St
1.1.20	I guess if I can figure out one machine, I can do ten.	St
1.1.21	Again, if someone can help me, with possibly even a vague description of how to do this, I could probably figure the rest out.Any advice or direction will be greatly appreciated.	St
1.1.22	You guys have never let me down in the past and I am grateful for that.	St
1.1.23	Thanks in advance!!!	St
1.1.24	!	St
1.2.1	You are talking &quot;business class&quot; and not what we might use at home.	St
1.2.2	Be sure you understand that you never back up the entire machine, but just user created files.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
