<s> Inspiron 1521 AMD Turion, 1.80 GHz 1918 mb ram Vista, Home Premium Zyxel P-330-W Router Cannon ip4300 Printer (on network) OK guys - I've been kicking around here ever since I first got my router back in late '07 - some days I think I'm getting it, and others - like today - I'm lost again. </s>
<s> Admittedly, I have more lost days than getting it days. </s>
<s> But I think I can verbalize my current confusion so that ya'll know that I'm a complete 'puter illiterate or I have one of my rare good questions - OK, here's why I'm confused. </s>
<s> If I want to print from my laptop, most days I can do so - however there are days when no matter what I do, I can't get anything to print from the laptop - The network printer has a USB connection to a Dell Dimension 2400, and there is never a problem printing from that machine. </s>
<s> What I don't understand is on the very best days for laptop printing, my Network and Sharing Center settings on the laptop say that there are no printers installed on that machine - that just don't seem right to me (seems to me that somewhere along the way in my research/learning, I thought I heard that you HAD to have the newest Vista print drivers installed in order for the network printer to function - isn't that a part of installing a printer?). </s>
<s> And yet, the very best functioning for my network printing come when there are no printers installed on my laptop. </s>
<s> I really don't like doing stuff that I don't understand, just because that's the only way it'll work - so I'd sure appreciate it if someone could explain to me why my laptop print function works best when there is no printer installed on the laptop - or if the truth is that I have just not yet discovered how to properly install the network printer on my laptop. </s>
<s> Many thanks to all (and I hope this was not a dumb-ass question!). </s>

<s> Let me summarize the reasons network shares do not show in rapid fire mode. </s>

<s> They are on Vista and connecting to a XP machine and didn't install the responder we note in our forum sticky. </s>
<s> c. The firewall is blocking MS networking. </s>
<s> d. The USB is set to power save and its in power save mode at the time of connection. </s>

<s> Hi Bob, Thanks for your response I started by checking off your list under #2 as so: a. </s>
<s> c. Checked the firewall exceptions list on both units saw no reference to MS networking would it be listed as something else? </s>
<s> I can't be more specific without knowing which firewall you are using. </s>
<s> d. Tried to track down where one changes USB settings did not find anything where do I find this? </s>
<s> Try this -&gt; http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=DISABLE+USB+POWER+SAVING Just so you know, some just give up and try out a really nice piece of software called NETWORK MAGIC. </s>
<s> It does this all for us without having to know it all. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Again, much thanks - with your added info, I checked the USB hubs - none set to power save. </s>
<s> Sorry, I'm using the internal Windows Firewall on each unit. </s>
<s> And on your last point, Yes, I know of Network Magic - it came with my router, and for the 1st month of the router's operation, N M did it's thing very well - but I guess I'm one of those nuts who consider problems to be challenges, and I figure that if there's a way to make this work w/o N M, then that's the way I'd rather it be. </s>
<s> Some would say that's just being a stubborn fool, but in my heart I know it's the way I learn the few things I do. </s>
<s> And besides, I no longer have the resourses to support the economy the same way I once did. </s>
