released about the same time as my old hp box...except on the complete opposite end of the product line... you got zero agp an 800mhz celeron 128mb of ram (stock, i think yours is at?
384?)
yeah, i'd say it's time for a new pc...at least if your a &quot;power user&quot; of sorts... i'd stay away from machines in that thing's original price range...how about a diy?
