Hi Friend, My Suggestion is better to buy Google Nexus 7 Tablet...which is developed by ASUS Hardware Motherboard.
Nexus 7 is designed to go wherever you go - and now with up to 32GB of storage and the ability to connect to mobile data networks - Nexus 7 can take you even further.
Nexus 7 can now operate on more than 200 GSM providers worldwide.
