I do not have the manual for the motherboard and I cannot figure out which keys to press to enter the bios. I searched google and found many different combinations but none seem to work. I need to get into the bios to disable the on board video and enable AGP. Is there anyway I can track down my bios key? Also is there another way to disable on board video without using the bios? Anyway my Bios is AMIBIOS ver 7 and the numbers at the bottom of the screen are &quot;AMIBIOS-0AAWVP06-Y2KC-F&quot; Thanks
