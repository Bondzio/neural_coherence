hrmm...that is strange!
i've been using the stardream papers and the ink doesn't smudge off.
the only problems i'm having is that the printer takes itself out of powersave mode alot!
when in standby/warm up mode it uses a lot of wattage.
if i power it off/on again, it uses up a lot of ink.
so, the power save option is sort of my best option.
anyway, i don't understand why its waking up by itself..its not even connected to a computer when i don't use it!
