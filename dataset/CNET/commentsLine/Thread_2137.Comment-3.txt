hey there jambeat, here are a few quick note-type thingies: 1) nowadays, i'd say that 2 gb of ram is minimum.
your instincts are right -- a fast processor is useless without memory to back it up 2) i'd add that the speed of your ram is an important factor.
so, check the ram's speed on the configs.
(just in case, disk speed can also be an issue) 3) overclocking: bad.
don't overclock.
i've wound up crying over more broken equipment due to overclocking than i care for.
picture this: a brand new computer that you've just busted because you wanted it to go a bit faster plus, no way you can make the guarantee work... hope this helps, red.
