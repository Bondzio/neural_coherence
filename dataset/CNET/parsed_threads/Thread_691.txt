<s> I'm doing a lot of netwotking at my place. </s>
<s> And I want to clean up the wires at my place. </s>
<s> I need a wall plate with both RJ-45 and COAX Tv in on plate. </s>
<s> Just like this except RJ-45 instead of RJ-11. </s>
<s> http://www.goodmart.com/products/82084.htm I only see plates with RJ-11 and CAT-TV like in the picutre. </s>
<s> Why isn't any plate mate with RJ-45 Ethernet. </s>
<s> Singe RJ-45 are made all the time. </s>
<s> But nothing I see with RJ-45 and CAT-TV in the same plate. </s>
<s> Thanks, Confusimo </s>
<s> Google: keystone wall plates You insert whatever keystone jack or jacks you need. </s>
<s> Your local, national chain hardware/home improvement store should have them. </s>
<s> RadioShack also has them. </s>
