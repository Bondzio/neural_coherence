<s> When I select the sleep button on the keyboard the message says &quot;System Standby Failed&quot; The device driver for the 'Terminal Server Keyboard Driver' device is preventing the machine from entering standby. </s>
<s> Please close all aplications and try again. </s>
<s> If the problem persists, you may have to update this driver. </s>
<s> I don't know where the driver is located and this problem just started a while ago. </s>
<s> The key was working fine prior and I must have done something to cause this. </s>
<s> Dell is no help nor could I find info on the Logitech site. </s>
<s> I have the standby feature working in the power options and it stands by at theprogrammed time but I want to also be able to standby when the keyboard key is selected. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>

<s> This is a not unusual issue with the usual fix to never use the Logitech keyboard software. </s>
<s> My Windows 2000 install strangely just works fine when I tap the sleep key. </s>
<s> Most of the time, the software on the CD is best not installed. </s>
<s> If you must install such, get the latest from the logitech web site. </s>

<s> I had the same exact problem with my Logitech wireless keyboard. </s>
<s> I solved it by going to Control Panel, selecting Add/Remove Programs, and selecting Adobe Type Manager 4.0 to completely remove it. </s>
<s> I rebooted and now it works fine. </s>
