<s> I printed out my .tif file in photoshop onto a sheet paper and the result was amazing. </s>
<s> Colors were accurate to what was on screen. </s>
<s> However, when I loaded the .tif file in the program Epson Print CD and printed to DVD, the colors seem faded and even appeared like some colors were not used or mixed. </s>
<s> Either the Epson program is not very good or the paper quality of the printable DVD does not absorb the ink well? </s>
<s> Anyone having the same problem or have suggestions? </s>
<s> using Epson R220 Verbatim DVD-R 8x printable http://www.thetechgeek.com/content/product.php?pid=6315&cid=69&ovchn=GGL&ovcpn=&ovcrn=&ovtac=PPC&gclid=CLqKtuPwgIQCFSYdSAodllaEig </s>
<s> For example http://www.colorvision.com/profis/profis_view.jsp?id=101 has not only monitor color calibration but can do printer profiling in the better packages. </s>

<s> That program costs more than my printer. </s>
<s> But as mentioned earlier, I can print the .tif file perfectly fine on paper via Photoshop. </s>
<s> I would assume my printer profile has already been set up. </s>
<s> I am not sure why under Epson's DVD label making program can't seem to print the colors right. </s>
<s> My sailboat's extras and fitting cost more than the boat. </s>
<s> The same is true about color management. </s>
<s> Now that we know you don't have any, that explains it all. </s>

<s> As a quick cure, try resetting the CD printout value to low or &quot;draft&quot; mode and check results. </s>
<s> In other words keep it as simple as possible to reduce &quot;hi-quality&quot; output as that alone puts out alot of ink. </s>
<s> Excluding true media(CD blanks) are decent, as I suspect Epson suggested some Epson brand and/or certain product for best results. </s>
<s> I suggest the above as you mentioned &quot;mixed colors&quot; which is a physical result of too much ink being present before the media can do its job if at all. </s>
<s> Epson has always placed in default mode &quot;hi-qulaity&quot; levels as to that product it may also. </s>
<s> As a further note as per Robert's suggestions, you can't take anything for granted as you may have since you used the same .tif file &quot;as is&quot; and expected same results but two different pgms. </s>
<s> were used. </s>
<s> Time to tweak away. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> The paper has a different color and absorbtion so tweaking or color management is the key factor here. </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> But I did read it differently. </s>
