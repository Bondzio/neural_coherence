if you use a generic system or plain build using a generic power supply based on the atx12v model, you can use any wattage.
the higher the better as it uses &quot;what it needs&quot;.
make sure the p/s unit mentions its for intel or and/or amd rated for a better fit on your system.
look should look at the physical size of things, but usually your basic replacement is very swappable, though a &quot;mini&quot; size is present.
also, expect some extra cables to daggle as you may not use all of them.
look here for some clues:  if you have a local shop, take in hand your old p/s and then ask for a replacement, even if it costs more, its a done deal.
however, if you have a oem or big vendor build system like dell, gateway, etc., make sure any replacament is rated for its use and/or model installation, but a higher wattage is still installable.
here sizing, wiring and/or special connects will come into play, so verify that.
