1.1.1	I 've got a 3 1/2 yr old gateway 700xl , p4-2.4gb , 1 gb ram with an Intel D850MV motherboard .	St
1.1.2	I have the NVIDEA GeForce 4 Ti4600 ( gateway ) video card .	St
1.1.3	The video started acting up going to the 640 display and a blue screen error message re .	St
1.1.4	an NV_4 video driver .	St
1.1.5	I pulled the video card and cleaned it and on reassembly and boot the fan ( on the card ) is not running and the card gets very hot .	St
1.1.6	I 'm assuming the card overheated and will replace it .	St
1.1.7	The motherboard specs say go with an AGP 2.0 version card , 4x at 1.5 volts .	St
1.1.8	Are the 4x and 8x cards backwardly compatible ; Are they 1.5 volts ; will they work in my computer ?	Ques
1.1.9	My card has 3 partitions on the insertion tab ; the 8x ones I see have 2- I believe my AGP socket will take the card but are there problems ?	Ques
1.1.10	Any recommendations for a replacement ? - I 'm not a gamer .	St
1.1.11	Thanks for your help .	Polite

1.3.1	Michael- Thanks for your response and link- as I read it ''a motherboard that supports 1.5V ( AGP 4x ) video cards should work ok with a .8V video card ( AGP 8x ) , however in the later example the video card would only work at the fastest speed the motherboard supports ( AGP 4x ) . ''	St
1.3.2	-- my interpretation is that I can purchase an 8x card if it fits in the slot but it will only run at 4x .	St
1.3.3	As I look in the slot in my computer , I do n't see a divider to preclude the insertion.There is only one divider 2/3 of the way down .	St
1.3.4	However , I am confused by what I think is a conflicting statement earlier in the link- '' If a motherboard requires a 1.5V AGP card and you place a AGP card in it that is not 1.5V , you will physically damage the motherboard and probably the video card as well . ''	St
1.3.5	Is this a conflict with the earlier quote ?	Ques
1.3.6	Any comments regarding this would be appreciated.Also any recommendations for cards .	Polite
1.3.7	Thanks , Mike	St
1.4.1	http : //www.ertyu.org/steven_nikkel/agpcompatibility.html The physical damage can occur when you try to force a non-compatible card into the slot .	St
1.4.2	The dividers are positioned to prevent this , however some will try anyway .	St
