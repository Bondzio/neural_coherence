<s> Hello All, I am sure there is a very simple tweak tot his but I can't figure out. </s>
<s> I reinstalled my system recently and since then any video I play, it flickers. </s>
<s> It is a pain to watch any video. </s>
<s> I have refresh rate to max 75Hz. </s>
<s> graphic card ATI Radeon Xpress 200 is installed properly, can't see any conflict in device manager. </s>
<s> Can anyone suggest the problem and the solution to fix it? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Have you tried changing the refresh rate to 60 or 65 hertz?. </s>
<s> Need some more info on system, OS, processor, ram etc..could be settings but also could be hardware. </s>
