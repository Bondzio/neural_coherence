you did not mention whose sound driver is on the motherboard.
for example, mine in soundmax.
make sure you have the latest drivers for the sound and for your operating system.
also check to make sure that you have placed the plug into the correct jack if you are running sound to an amplifier or outside source.
also check to see if your sound card offers analog versus digital output.
sometimes, it makes a difference.
try checking your system within windows and the hardware and device manager to see if the operating system says that the sound card is working properly.
if all else fails try re-installing your motherboard utilities (usually supplied on a cd with the motherboard).
it should contain the install or driver for your sound card.
delete the present one first, then re-install.
good luck.
