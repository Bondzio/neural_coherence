<s> I want to start turning my collection of cookbooks into an electronic version. </s>
<s> I want a device that can view pdf's and be able to zoom in on parts of the pdf if the text happens to be too small. </s>
<s> This being said, browsing cookbooks is the only thing being done on the device so I don't need all the bells and whistles except for a large screen. </s>
<s> Looking at something functional yet inexpensive. </s>
<s> Hope you guys have some suggestions! </s>
<s> It's cheaper than most tablets. </s>
<s> If all you want is a cookbook reader, Barnes & Noble Nook. </s>
<s> Expansion slot is handy. </s>
<s> The downside is it's only a 7-inch screen. </s>

<s> I checked out the kindle dx, but I read that you can't zoom in on a pdf, so if its a big page thats scanned it may be hard to read. </s>
<s> A net book is hard to beat. </s>
<s> Just last week we picked up a refurb at geeks.com for about 240 and it's hard to beat the real thing when it comes to PDFs. </s>
<s> I've used Android tablets but if you look around, some folk demand that all PDFs work so I have to go back to a PC. </s>
