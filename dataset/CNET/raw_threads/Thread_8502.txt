Since there is no line of sight, you'll run afoul of FCC regulations. So the best solution may be a tethered phone. Here I can use a Virgin Mobile android phone (99 bucks at target.com) and it's 35 buck a month plan plus Easytether for 15 bucks. I'm done. NO LINE OF SIGHT means no good cheap solution. Why isn't internet service an option? Bob
