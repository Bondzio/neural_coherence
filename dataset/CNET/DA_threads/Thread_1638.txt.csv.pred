1.1.1	I left the notebook turned on for the night , so and when I have woken up I noticed that it is just was hanged .	St
1.1.2	Anytime I tried to reboot it - it always stayed in the moment of staring up progress running and running for ages .	St
1.1.3	I tried all variants of WIN7 booting up - results are the same , the only thing I could admit was the last string in & quot ; Start with command string support & quot ; Mode , and it was : & quot ; Loading CLASSPNP.SYS & quot ; .	St
1.1.4	This info does n't give me anytinhg .	St
1.1.5	I 've tried to start from Live CD , half of programs do n't boot at all , Mini Windows XP , Mini Windows 7 , acronis , smth else do n't want to start .	St
1.1.6	MHDD says that disk is very well , Memory test likes whole 2GB.. Well , it 's strange , but Live Linux is n't capricious , well.. Ubuntu set up fine without any problems at all..	St
1.1.7	I could save all info from installed Ubuntu ( funny.. ) .	St
1.1.8	Finally , I wiped all HDD , guessing that maybe there were some errors in partitions or elsewhere , but ... Nope..	St
1.1.9	In search of truth I started PC Check , and checked Video Memory , RAM , and.. it hangs between memory test where there is System Mem , Cache mem , I do n't undestand where exactly !	St
1.1.10	So , MB , CPU or BIOS ?	Ques
1.1.11	I 'll appreciate any of your answer , except & quot ; warranty & quot ; , & quot ; guarantee & quot ; , & quot ; service center & quot ; ...	St
1.1.12	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	I do n't see make , model , age , STORY so it sounds like a fried part but since it 's a laptop ( ca n't tell if it 's some netbook ? )	Ques
1.2.2	I 'm going to write to try another motherboard .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Back cover title says it 's MSI-U210X , and it 's not quite mine I could tell you an age , but Bios ver - 2009 Dec , so I can assume it 's about 2-2.5 years.. And , I guess , you 'll stand the point of changing MB whatever.. Mmm , for me - to change MB is to give someone for repairing.. Is here something I could change by myself ?	Ques
1.4.1	And came away with that feeling it 's the common few year netbook .	St
1.4.2	The ATI video in it was not known for its lack of issues ( heat , etc . )	St
1.4.3	Try the generic reset in the forum at http : //forums.cnet.com/7723-19681_102-352085/welcome-to-the-laptop-troubleshooting-forum-at-cnet/ ? tag=contentBody ; threadListing but leave the battery out since it 's likely to be the original and would be too old to be left in the machine .	St
1.4.4	Can cause board failures too .	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	Well , I 've reset the book with the method you described there ( by the link ) ( THANX A LOT ) and it began to work as if nothing was happen..	St
1.5.2	So I inserted USB boot-flash with WIN 7 and before installation decided to find out what 's the temperature of CPU , cause that terrible heat drives me crazy..	St
1.5.3	So , I started AIDA64 ( ex Everest , from the menu below the Installation choice ) , and went to & quot ; Sensor Information & quot ; .	St
1.5.4	I did n't manage to see any info , coz it freezed , but after rebooting I found out that book is yet again do n't want to start , so I RESET it again and it again began to live ...	St
1.5.5	So , one thing I recollected is that I installed AIDA64 about two hours before notebook hanged AT FIRST time ...	St
1.5.6	I do n't think AIDA64 spoils hardware , but.. what can it be ?	Ques
1.5.7	1 ) Book is fine 2 ) Starting AIDA64 , looking for some info ( first time it was Stress-test or Stability-test ) 3 ) Book is not fine , and only RESET backs it to life 4 ) Normal working at all.. O.o 5 ) Again AIDA ( simple sensor look up ) and again failure till RESET ?	Ques
1.5.8	Now I work on it for about a day , installed all drivers , programs , nothing seems to be wrong at all ...	St
1.5.9	Your opinion ?	Ques
1.6.1	Sorry but I only get a glimpse of that machine from what you write .	St
1.6.2	It is a few years old from what I can tell and I do n't write at first about using CANNED AIR because I hope that folk will tell me they did the usual cleaning .	St
1.6.3	Those temp measuring software can fail .	St
1.6.4	Nothing new here and I wo n't start yet another discussion .	St
1.6.5	Please remove such because its probing can cause a good machine to hang .	St
1.6.6	Now about that CANNED AIR .	St
