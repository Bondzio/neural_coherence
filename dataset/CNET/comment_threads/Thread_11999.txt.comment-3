great.
In general, PC3200 [DDR 400] will run in the meory slot, HOWEVER it will only run at the slower speed that the mobo supports [DDR 333 in this case].
Everest says that it supports DDR 400, if so then the only question is whether or not the CPU that you have supports the 400 MHz FSB.
If it does, then then you don't want a mix of PC2700 and PC3200 because all the memory will run at the lower speed.
We really need to know what CPU you have in the system.
IMHO tis very unlikely that you'll notice any difference between 2.5 and 3, However it is best to use sticks with the same CL to insure that the mobo uses the faster timing of 2.5.
Judy seems to detect a noticeable difference.
You'll certainly see a difference running DDR 400 IF your CPU supports the 400 MHz FSB.
