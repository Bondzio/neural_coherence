Thanks Bob, I guess one problem with buying a Dell is their funky proprietary MoBos and PSUs that seem to limit the choice of GPUs (enough acronyms?).
I'm looking at Dells because I think their Pro Support is decent and this being for work, I want someone I can rely on to call for support and get it fixed quick should something go haywire.
