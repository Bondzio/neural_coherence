it happened to me in the last two days.. and have not resolved it yet.
i have several xp pro-sp1, xp pro-sp2, win me, win 98se, connected via ethernet lan, adsl modem/router + a couple of switches... (latest ms updates are not installed in all xps) -- that is the reason why i said its not ms updates is the culprit.-- everything works normally, then suddenly i can not browse the workgroup.. just like you described... '(network unavailable warning - yet the find command locates any computer on the net and grants access, as does the cd\\&lt;computername&gt; command.)'
also printing via network is working normally.
-- so its not 'file and printer sharing has been turn off too -- i would also like to know, if anyone know what is happening and how to solve the problem.
thank you
