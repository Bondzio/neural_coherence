<s> I can't play my MP3 player in my car radio because my radio won't allow me to find a silent FM frequency. </s>
<s> The radio only has a search feature. </s>
<s> Would buying a &quot;cassette adapter&quot; allow me to use an MP3 player through my car radio? </s>
<s> Adapters are available for CD players, iPods, everything. </s>
<s> Be sure to find one that is compatable with your player such as looking at the player's web site. </s>
