<s> I am running about 8 computers in my home business, and my web guy tells me that he can't make my combination of Macs and PCs &quot;work together.&quot; The current method of printing is to email him all documents so he can send them to the printer. </s>
<s> He's also telling me he can't create multiple email accounts, so all the business emails come into one account which he then reads and passes along. </s>
<s> Now I am no genius when it comes to computers, but I possess a basic understanding. </s>
<s> Can't I just use a wired router and create a network? </s>
<s> I realize there may be potential issues with SATA vs. USB ports on the printers as one is older, so worst case scenario would be two separate networks, right? </s>
<s> It's like telling me I can't use a Mac at a wifi hotspot. </s>
<s> Your wifi router is the same technology as what your hotspot uses. </s>
<s> -&gt; There are issues with some OSes as you go past 5 machines. </s>
<s> XP has connection limits so a shared printer or files will only allow the first 5 machines. </s>
<s> Read http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314882 which notes the XP Pro and Windows 2000 (Professional) limit. </s>
<s> No need to create 2 networks. </s>
<s> Show them your working network later. </s>

<s> Thank you Bob! </s>
<s> It looks like I might be looking for a new IT guy. </s>
