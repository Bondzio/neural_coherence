<s> See my earlier thread &quot;How to restore System if MB fails? </s>
<s> ?&quot; started on 12/20/03. </s>
<s> I am convinced I have a hardware problem. </s>
<s> Lockup occurs at random points after boot-up. </s>
<s> I took my system apart before Christmas and really cleaned it out good. </s>
<s> Removed all dust - but system still locks up. </s>
<s> Seems to be locking up more than ever - had to re-boot 6 times today before it became stable. </s>
<s> (Yesterday, had to re-boot 4 or 5 times before it became stable.) </s>
<s> I have the MB and Power Pack part numbers from Compaq. </s>
<s> How can I try to be sure what I have to replace before ordering new parts? </s>
<s> Note: There was no visible sign of bad Capacitors. </s>
<s> Power Pack fan and CPU fan seem to be working fine. </s>
<s> (To repeat: I run WIN98SE with all updates; on a COMPAQ Presario 5838 (500 mhz AMD Athlon cpu); 384 Megs RAM; Compaq 2 button wheel mouse; Logitech Mouseware Control Center version 9.00.99; Mouse Driver version 9.00; Internet Explorer 6.0 + all updates; Norton Anti-Virus 2000 with all latest Virus updates (it has passed all Virus scans including the latest update); Network Neighborhood enabled.) </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Take out a stick of memory. </s>
<s> With Windows 98, you may not notice it from 384 to 256 megabytes of memory. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Leave to case cover off. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Age. </s>
<s> Sadly, even with no visible signs of capacitor issues, they still age. </s>
<s> The power supply, motherboard and CPU are prime hardware suspects if a total reload of the OS doesn't cure it. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> No parasites allowed. </s>
<s> This is my non-negotiable item with five noted scans/tools at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6132-0.html?forumID=32&threadID=1313&start=0 There are more than virus out there. </s>
<s> You don't want these either and Norton does nothing to stop these. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> Unless I could get those parts for under 20 bucks, I would not repair this machine. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for all of your responses. </s>
<s> You are very helpful. </s>
<s> The symptom is that my system locks up within the first 1 - 5 minutes of booting up, then runs fine from then on. </s>
<s> (I have not turned off this PC since yesterday morning). </s>
<s> So as I look for bad components, what kind would exhibit the &quot;bad when cool - good when warm&quot; characteristic? </s>
<s> PS - I ran all the &quot;checker&quot; stuff you referred me to. </s>
<s> No problems detected. </s>
<s> ALL the parts can lead to this issue. </s>
<s> Well, maybe not the speaker, some indicator LEDs and a case (but maybe?) </s>
<s> I mentioned the age of the parts are working very much against us here. </s>
<s> Electrolytic capacitors used in power supplies, motherboards and almost all parts of the PC age and decrease in capacity at an astonding rate. </s>
<s> Chips can exhibit such anomilies and there is no firm test to find which one in any economical manner except to swap out a board/CPU/chip and see if the issue vanishes. </s>
<s> But since it does this with repeatability and you can use the machine, maybe all you need to do is to not spend a dime? </s>
<s> Just turn it on 10 minutes ahead of time, then reboot? </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> If you want some engineering documentation on Electrolytic Capacitor aging, then I can supply some, but it's mostly charts and jargon that shows the aging of time and temperature. </s>
<s> What no-one really tells the consumers is that most machines will fail in some number of years or develop 'issues.' </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> Now I'll go off and &quot;ponder&quot; some more. </s>
<s> I know its time to get a new PC but: 1) I don't relish the thought of the time required to &quot;learn&quot; WIN XP-Pro. </s>
<s> 2) I will have to buy an upgrade to my office suite, and probably spend some time learning it's anomalies (they all have them). </s>
<s> I am hooked on WordPerfect Office Suite - hate the thought of going to Microsoft. </s>
<s> 3} I'll have to re-enable my home network. </s>
<s> This PC is now the hub. </s>
<s> It was a pain to set it up once! </s>
<s> 4} I'll have to buy an upgrade for Drive Image (and maybe for Partition Magic). </s>
<s> All of the above takes much time. </s>
<s> But considering all the time I have spent on the current PC issues, maybe I should have made the jump sooner! </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> I use the following suite on all the machines now that Microsoft Office is frankly getting too pushy about one copy per machine in my house. </s>
<s> I can deal with it at work, but at home, no. </s>
<s> Open Office from http://www.openoffice.org To complement web work, the Mozilla from http://www.mozilla.org XP was not a big move for me, but I ran NT 4.0 at work for far too many years and Windows 2000. </s>
<s> The issues of 64 kilobyte resource pools and 4 gigabyte file size maximums make the 95/98/ME line unusable now that I want to do video work at home. </s>
<s> Be sure to check that the fans are clear and running top notch and your machine may just need a 10 minute warning... One last thought. </s>
<s> If you are inside the box, reseat the cards, memory and such, just to be sure. </s>
