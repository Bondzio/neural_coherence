it really depends on how you configure your monitors, if you set-it up to span two monitors, you actually have one large desktop.
if setup as clone, you'll have two monitors showing the same desktop.
anything you do on the primary monitor would only be ''cloned'' by the secondary a whole new world of computing will open up for you when you go dual-monitor.
and don't worry about making any mistakes, nothing you can do on screen can damage your monitors.
its pretty easy enough to understand when its already infront of you.
try it then tell us how it went.
life is good.
