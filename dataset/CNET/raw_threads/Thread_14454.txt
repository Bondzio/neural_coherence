Anyway, if everybody stay conservative with windows 98,won't be any progress in the future!it's the price to pay when you want improvment,and there is always a small (I hope) phase where the chaos is taking place...but in 6 Month,everythings will run smooth, I'm pretty sure! By the way I found a thread by epson, the drivers will be released,during march fpr the R800,for some other products should be now already on download-site...yeah I have to wait a little bit...but that's life... viva vista! Cheers
