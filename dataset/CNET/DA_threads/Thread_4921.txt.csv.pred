1.2.1	But let's cut to the chase.	St
1.2.2	&quot;including vista theme(crystalxp).&quot; One of the things you learn is to eject any pretty or shiny addons and get back to boring.	St
1.2.3	Your tinkering and prettying up of the OS could have caused this.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Hence...hardware..I would pull the Video card and use the Intergrated Video[Intel].. ..also if your useing a SP2 CD to upgrade your SP1..that might be another problem.. ..your PC sounds like its aged/ I would attempt to upgrade the RAM..and the HDD(NTFS)/ ..	St
1.3.2	If you add up the price of upgrading your PC/ 1./New OS 2./RAM(more like 2 x 512MB's) 3./USB 2.0 .............................. You may find you really need to purchase a New Machine.. .. Also..the fax viewer in XP does contain a BUG/ it was FIXED about 4-years ago.. ..You also need to find the FIX at http://www.microsoft.com ..	St
1.3.3	But I would just pull the Video card and go w/Integrated Graphics..	St
1.3.4	If your useing a PCI-expansion card for sound/?	St
1.3.5	?/pull that also..and use the Onboard Sound.. ..	St
1.3.6	Instead of lowering your CRT-screen Resolution.. considering that you did PULL the Expansion cards.. you can Right-Click your Monitor PROPERTIES/in TROUBLESHOOTING-drop the hardware Accelleration-one NOTCH.. ..	St
1.3.7	If none of that helps..you need a better PC.	St
