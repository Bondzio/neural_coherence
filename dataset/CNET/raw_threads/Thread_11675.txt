Link, comment.	http://www.intel.com/products/chipsets/gma950/ notes the chipset can be moved up to 224M. But for the Apple side it's programmed at 64M. I think I read that with bootcamp they set it to 128M but you can research that. It's an optional setting that is not exposed to the user to tweak. I think that's a good thing. Bob

Combine this information with what the chipset can do and the door is opened. Trouble is, only codemasters hold the keys.
