I have both a Dell laptop and a Dell desktop, both running Windows XP Professional.
I recently purchased a 250GB external hard drive which I would like to use for backing up BOTH computers.
They would NOT be connected to the external drive at the same time (I know that's a no-no), but I would swap the drive between the computers as needed.
I would certainly think this would be possible if the drive was not partitioned (or technically speaking had only the 1 partition), but could I create TWO partitions, one for backing up the laptop and the other partition for backing up the desktop?
If the partitioning were performed, say, using the desktop would Windows on the laptop recognize the partitions, thus allowing the laptop to back up to its dedicated partition?
I thought this type of question would come up fairly frequently, but I have not found this question addressed anywhere yet on this forum (judging by the titles anyway), nor anywhere yet on the Internet for that matter.
I would appreciate any help.
