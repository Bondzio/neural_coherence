<s> Hello, Was just wondering if anyone knew how I can have a wireless network set up with mutliple access points but only show up as one wireless network from any PC that wishes to connect to them? </s>
<s> Does it require a specific type/model access point, if so can anyone recommend any? </s>
<s> Cheers for any help </s>
<s> Every access point has a unique SSID and will be shown as such in the client. </s>
<s> But I might be totally wrong, and would appreciate to be educated by anyone knowing the right details. </s>

<s> so there is no way to get them to show up as one wireless network instead of multiple access points? </s>
<s> But I'm waiting to be corrected. </s>
<s> Can you tell more about the circumstances? </s>
<s> This is unlikely to be a requirement in a normal home environment, like you and me live in. </s>
<s> So I assume it's some business, and then of course, we're talking professional stuff like cingular and t-mobile have for their WiFi offerings, and that might make a difference. </s>

<s> its for a school, just for ease of use by users really </s>
<s> You name the WAPs in some fashion like... SCL01 SCL02 SCL03 This way if one isn't working well they can report it. </s>
<s> If you did name all the WAPs the same (which is not a good idea...) you could be shot or hanged by the people who have to maintain the system. </s>

<s> I can't say for sure what all is out there that will do this, but I know Cisco's wireless products will do exactly what you are after. </s>
<s> They are actually pretty nice. </s>
<s> A user can log in anywhere, and roam anywhere around the building/campus (where they can get a signal) and the signal will automatically move AP to AP with the best signal with no loss in connectivity. </s>
<s> Of course you will pay a premium for Cisco equipment. </s>
<s> There may be cheaper solutions out there. </s>
<s> Depending on the scope and topology of your network, you maybe able to accomplish this using wireless bridges instead of AP's. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> The AP has a connection limit. </s>
<s> (brick wall issue) 2. </s>
<s> All users get to share the single airspace's speed. </s>
<s> (slow bus to nowhere issue) 3. </s>
<s> If you allow 802.11b connections... (let's go real slow) For a public solution it's best to not entertain that. </s>
