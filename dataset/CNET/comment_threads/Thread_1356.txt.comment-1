I transfered an old Gigabyte GA7-IXE4 with its AMD thunderbird freind into a clear side light up case, since I was modding and tweaking, I do have a new 64 bit PC, so If I did anything wrong it didnt really matter, which is why I wasnt dissapointed when It failed to work in it's new case, only the fans worked, and no beeps, I presumed it dead, understandeable since I found out my cat had actually been sitting inside the open case!
and knocking things onto the floor, so I guessed something would break.
I tried it today, and for some reason it started beeping, I have no monitor output, but it is going Beep, Beep-----Beep, what does it mean?
It does two beeps quikly then 1 more after a short delay.
