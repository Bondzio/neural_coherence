if you have only one computer and you want to determine what applications are using the most bandwidth then just load the ethereal sniffer on that machine.
it is free and provides some bandwidth and conversation analasys tools.
if this is a shared connection then insert a hub between the dsl modem and the router.
a cheap switch will not work.
it has to be a hub or a managed switch that supports &quot;port mirroring&quot;.
you can use ethereal the same as before to monitor the total bandwidth being used and which applications use the most/least.
