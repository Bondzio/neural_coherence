Although media seems to play stably, now it seems that my data transfer rates are poor.
I tried to copy an ~800MB file from a USB flash to the external IDE.
Both peripherals are connected through the same PCI, and the flash drive is on a 4port powered hub.
This transfer would normally take me 3-5min and now it takes 30+... almost seems like USB1.1 rather than 2.0 This has me puzzled.
Any ideas?
As always, Thank you!
