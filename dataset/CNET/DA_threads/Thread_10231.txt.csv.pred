1.1.1	Hi I have a problem involving my computer .	St
1.1.2	Recently it turns itself off after a few seconds of switching it on .	St
1.1.3	The symptoms goes like this : After a long period of dormancy , when I press the on button , it switches itself on for about 20 seconds before turning itself off .	St
1.1.4	Subsequent tries to switch it on , it will switch off by itself after 1 - 2 seconds .	St
1.1.5	I have tried the following : 1 ) Changed power supply 2 ) Changed Power supply cable 3 ) COnnect to different power sockets , ( i.e .	St
1.1.6	different rooms in the house ) 4 ) Only connect using the power supply cable ( i.e .	St
1.1.7	monitor , speaker cables are all not connected ) All the above failed to resolve the problem .	St
1.1.8	However , the annoying thing is , whenever I bring the computer over to the technician 's place , it works perfectly well !	St
1.1.9	It can switch on and remain switched on for hours .	St
1.1.10	The moment I bring it home and try to switch on at home , it failed .	St
1.1.11	Does anyone know what can be the cause of this ?	Ques
1.1.12	Any help will be greatly appreciated , thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	Change that and retest .	St
1.3.1	But actually I was wondering if it has something to do with the current ( ? )	Ques
1.3.2	at home .	St
1.3.3	I will probably change a new motherboard as a last resort but as of now I am thinking of alternatives since a new motherboard is expensive .	St
1.3.4	Essentially the problems goes like this , the computer keeps switching off after 1 seconds when it is in my house , but it works perfectly well in the technician 's place .	St
1.3.5	This is a very reproducible problem .	St
1.3.6	Since the problem began ( about a week ago ) I have not had a single occasion that the computer did not shut down by itself after a few seconds , when it is in my house .	St
1.3.7	But when I moved it to the technician place , there is not a single time that the computer shut down after a few seconds .	St
1.3.8	I 've been to the technician 's place twice and in both occasions I did not see it switch off by itself .	St
1.3.9	In fact , the 3 days in the technician place , the technician also claimed that it did not switch off at all .	St
1.3.10	The technician also says it is unlikely to be motherboard and initially diagnosed it as a case of overheating .	St
1.3.11	He added some hardware adjustments , but the problem remains unresolved to now , whenever the computer is in my house .	St
1.3.12	Hence is there any other cause of this problem ?	Ques
1.3.13	Please advise , thanks .	Polite
1.4.1	The power or AC lines are too easy to check so if you suspect that , a Volt Meter is too easy to use .	St
1.4.2	Sorry but I think you want this written so I will .	St
1.4.3	The old works at the shop syndrome is often traced to not the AC ( unless we are talking really bad third world areas ) but something the owner is not taking into account .	St
1.4.4	They get home and ( here it is ) hook up their USB drives , printers , phone and what else that is not the same as the shop .	St
1.4.5	Some of them will not place the machine in the SAME ORIENTATION as it was at the shop .	St
1.4.6	But it sounds like a flaky board to me .	St
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	I do n't have a voltmeter in my place and I am not well-informed in this discipline .	St
1.5.2	But if it is really easy to learn I will go and read up on my own regarding this .	St
1.5.3	I have considered all the possible factors said above .	St
1.5.4	The connection I did is just a bare bones Power Supply to main socket connection .	St
1.5.5	I did n't connect the monitor , the speaker , the printer etc .	St
1.5.6	to imitate what it was done at the technician 's place .	St
1.5.7	Further , I did place the computer at the same orientation as what I saw placed in the technician 's area , and at the same time , I blasted the fan full speed at the motherboard but still the problem persisted .	St
1.5.8	I guess then it probably really is the motherboard .	St
1.5.9	Thanks for the help .	St
1.6.1	Hello friend , your processor could be a course of this mess .	St
1.6.2	please verify the condition of the heat absorber on the processor and refix it , making sure it is firm on the processor then try your system again .	Sug
1.6.3	thanks .	Polite
1.7.1	i have read your post and i think that the problem 90 % is in your cable , becouse you said in the technic place your machine works wery well .	St
1.7.2	I hope i help you with this !	St
