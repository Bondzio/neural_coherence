1.1.1	I am having a problem installing a Geforce FX5500 AGP card in a Compaq Presario SR1420UK .	St
1.1.2	The machine is an AMD 3000 , 512mb Ram with onboard graphics .	St
1.1.3	I have selected AGP/Onboard as the primary graphics in the BIOS but still no joy .	St
1.1.4	With the monitor plugged into the card when I switch on the monitor works while its going through its POST , when it starts to load up Windows ( XP ) the screen goes black .	St
1.1.5	Anyone any ideas from here ?	Ques
1.2.1	Windows looks to be using the drivers for the old graphics .	St
1.2.2	Install the new drivers .	St
1.2.3	Simple enough to move the VGA connector to the other connection for that .	St

1.3.1	Problem there is when I plug the card in there is no output at all from the onboard socket .	St
1.3.2	It just goes completely dead .	St
1.3.3	Can I still install drivers if the card is not in place ?	Ques
1.3.4	I tried and it came up saying it could n't find any hardware to match .	St
