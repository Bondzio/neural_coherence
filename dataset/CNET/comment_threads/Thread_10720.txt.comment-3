I did not put my internet IP because I am not sure where I did not use it in any of the configurations I mentioned.
I thought I only would need the internet IP when I am trying to access the camera from the internet.
Did I draw an incorrect conclusion?
All ip's mentioned are internal to my network.
Thanks for your assistance.
