<s> First let me say that I am new to Wi-Fi - here is my issue. </s>
<s> I have successfully intalled the driver and card and actually had a secure connection to my network. </s>
<s> however after updating to SP2 for XP I have been unable to gain access to my network. </s>
<s> I have tried the 'Hotfix&quot; issue as well as reinstall the product, manually configure and several frimware updates and have gotten nowhere. </s>
<s> I had not problems on initial install - only after SP2 - any help in getting around this - also will I find this to be the case with all WiFi cards and SP2??? </s>
<s> I guess that I should say my issue is that it cannot find IP address - then if I manually configure it will find it but will not allow the connection. </s>
<s> Any hell? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> for a test. </s>
<s> In addition you may want to uninstall SP2 and note the effect that has. </s>
<s> A spyware ladened machine will also have this effect after an SP2 upgrade. </s>
<s> that is posing the issue - I have actually messed around with it some more - I am writing this from my den - wireless. </s>
<s> however I am having to go through a strange set up to get connected. </s>
<s> When I turn the laptop back on I have problem getting the driver to &quot;initiate&quot; so if I turn on the windows utility it sends me to the netgear utility - which then works??? </s>
<s> wierd </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> After trying several configs and reinstalls I finally got one of the newer driver updates to work - not sure why this one did not work the first time I tried it though...Thanks for the help </s>
<s> apparently the software writers have yet to keep up with all of MS's service packs. </s>
