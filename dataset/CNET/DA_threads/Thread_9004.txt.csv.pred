1.1.1	Hello , Currently I have DSL in my room for purposes such as using it for my computer and my Xbox 360 .	St
1.1.2	However , my parents finally decided that they would like to create a network with my dsl , but the dsl is too slow when used with one object and another at the same time .	St
1.1.3	So , we 've decided to pick up with cable , which means I will have to end my subscription with verizon dsl and begin with RoadRunner ( timewarner ) .	St
1.1.4	I heard that cable is much faster then dsl which is a good thing , But when one of the guys came over to install basically ( set up the modem on my moms computer , I asked him a few questions ; because I wanted to know what I needed to look for .	St
1.1.5	Regardless , he told me that you ca n't set up a wired network with the cable .	St
1.1.6	Is this true ?	Ques
1.1.7	Second , he told me that I would have to go wireless , which means that its proabbly going to cost a lot more then if I go wired .	St
1.1.8	( Having to add an additonal $ 80+ for a xbox 360 network adapter ) My main question is that is there anyone with cable that uses a router that is directly connected to all your devices ?	Ques
1.1.9	Thanks for the time .	St
