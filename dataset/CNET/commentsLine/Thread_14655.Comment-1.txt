&quot;power surge on hub port&quot;..... &quot;a usb device has exceeded the power limits of its hub port.
for assisatance in solving this problem, click this message.&quot; saw this perplexing problem for the first time on a client's pc... thought i would see if there was anything out there before i started troubleshooting.
pc has been on a burn in test for several days.
solution to this problem is easy turn off system standby & disable hibernation in control panel - power options -on power scheme tab set system standby to never - click apply then change to hibernate tab and uncheck enable hibernation problem was on a sony viao pcv-rs310 aka pcv-2222 that was fine prior to factory restore and no usb devices were attached..... problem has not re-appeared since and i did not try to change any of the usb settings suggested in the threads i found.
so try this first before you start turning off warnings and changing drivers or registry settings.
