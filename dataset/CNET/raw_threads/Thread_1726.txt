I can see the labels on it by going to the hardware manager, Cdrom drive, clicking volumes, and clicking populate, but I can't read the data. I have tried 3 different Cdrom drives so it isn't my Cdrom. This is annoying because I just got a $70 dollar game that's on 4 Cd's and I can't install it. Thanks for helping me. If it matters, I am using a Pentium III 733MHz

So I start with Cursorcowboy's deep responses on CDROM issues. http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7813-0.html?forumID=44&threadID=36654&messageID=427355 http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7813-0.html?forumID=5&threadID=5490&messageID=65044 http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7813-0.html?forumID=44&threadID=8129&messageID=94841 Maybe your answer is in there, but with so little to work with, you get to sift through this.
