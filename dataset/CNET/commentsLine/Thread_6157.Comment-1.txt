hello, i'm looking to know what the upgrade capabilities are on a dell dimension 3000. it's like a 5 year old computer and i just upgraded to windows 7 but here are my questions: -largest hard drive (hard drive size not that important, more important is rpms) -how much ram can i put in this (i want 6 gigs or more) -what kind of dedicated graphics card -upgrade processor let me know.
my i'm a web developer &amp; my website is current century media if i can't upgrade this system much i'll just continue to use it for microsoft office/notepad editors/xammp i also plan on buying a lenovo ideapad u410 from the windows store... is this a good buy or not.
i want to start working with illustrator &amp; in-design.
thanks, ted cacciola current century media
