<s> Recently been having some serious issues with my computer. </s>
<s> First the SATA HDD would start only occasionally then sometimes fail either a few minutes or a few hours after startup. </s>
<s> My SATA HD contains all my data and software and my IDE HD contains windows and a few other programs. </s>
<s> So far no data has been lost from this drive, it just rarely starts (I have moved the most important files on to my IDE for safety). </s>
<s> Soon after that my computer became painfully slow to start up. </s>
<s> It would take a long time loading windows then the screen would go black for a while before going to the login screen. </s>
<s> Any help would be much appareciated System: Windows XP SP2 AMD Athlon 64 3000+ Asus K8V Deluxe mobo 2gb RAM Seagate 200gb SATA HDD IDE 80gb HDD Geforce FX 5950 Ultra 256mb gfx </s>
