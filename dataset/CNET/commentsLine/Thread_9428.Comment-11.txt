the fact is, a computer is a tool.
if you had a home improvement project to undertake and you needed a new electric drill, would you wait around to get one with better battery life, quicker charging time, more torque, etc.
- or would you just go out and buy one?
it's the same idea, really.
there will *always* be something better right around the corner.
but the &quot;value&quot; in a computer lies in the usefulness you get out of it while using it.
i've been in the computer field for around 15 years now, and truthfully, i haven't seen any real correlation between what a customer initially purchased and how long that customer kept using it.
people keep saying they're &quot;waiting for technology x&quot; to arrive so their purchase will &quot;last them a couple more years&quot; before they need to upgrade again.
still others try to justify buying &quot;more computer than they really need&quot; with the same idea in mind.
but after a few years go by, you see the same thing happening.
the &quot;power user&quot; types (and those who just have to own the latest thing for the &quot;bragging rights&quot; of it) feel like it's time for another upgrade in 2-3 years anyway.
most of the others just get by with whatever they bought for long after other people keep telling them it's &quot;way out of date&quot;.
