excluding the DRM, Sony doesn't make that great of PC's.. Pros: Brand Name Nice Cases blend into anything Very Media Center Oriented (or they used to be) Cons: Expensive Gotta to pick a certain model Can't Customize DRM Scandal (Not realy related) Hard to get what you want Bad Configs The laptops aren't that bad, though.
What kind of PC are you looking for?
Media Center?
Gaming?
Office?
Simple Word processing and Word?
Photo Editing?
