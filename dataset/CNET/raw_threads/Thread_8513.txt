Here is what the Conflicting device list says: Input/Output Range 0000 - 0002 used by: Direct memory access controller I tried removing the SCSI controller and restarting windows in hopes that it would choose a different IO range but it went back to the way it was. I would appreciate any help. Win2k MSI MS-6330 VIA KT133/A Chipset

The person who installed the OS didn't install the motherboard driver package or check for latest version of that package. It's a repeating problem since many expected Microsoft to install such. Bob

The scanner did work before, but I haven't used it in months (updated lots of drivers since) and I don't know if this conflict is the culprit.
