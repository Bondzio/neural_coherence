He thought he could save a few bucks on LD so bought their pitch from TV. He said sometimes it would take 2 or 3 minutes before he could even call out. Not good for 911 calls. They tried 3 different phones. He also said the line was noisy most of the time. He has Comcast 16/2 internet with an SNR of 38.4 so it sure wasn't his connection. He pulled the unit out and tossed it in the trash. This is just one case, but it sure kept me from getting a &quot;Magic Jack&quot;

My only issue is due to the fact that I live in Canada. They give you a list of area codes, choose your # and thats it. I was told that soon, Canadian area codes will be available. Now for the hardest part; Cutting my land line! Plus, I just call forward to my cell. Damn thing really works. Go figure?

He actually purchased five of them!(all for his home). He swears by the things but I often have trouble deciphering what he is saying when he talks, it is an odd type of distortion that I do not know how to describe. Kind of sounds as if the sound waves are passing through water at times. Other times, it works nearly flawlessly but I would not use it as a primary telephone service.

The only problem I see is yhat you have to keep you computer running all the time if you want your house phone working, otherwise transfer the calls to your cell phone. I think it is a good deal for the money you pay for it. It will be a good idea if they get it to work off the omputer, direct to the internet line like Vonage is doing, that way you don't have to keep your computer running if you are no using it.

Reception has been very clear but it does seem to work better with some phones than others. I have the highest speed cable modem which might help. Using on a Vista HP laptop. Again, on some phones, entering data from the phone, e.g., a credit card number, can be unreliable. Seems to work better with a 2.4 Mghz phone than a 5.8. It was worth the money, that's for sure. It's paid for itself in long distance calls many times over.

10161	9	334601	3007303	3007265	Popa41	3/20/09 7:20 PM	1.2375768E12	Works for me...	I've had mine for about six months now. Never had a problem with it. Everyone I talk to on it says the sound quality is excellent. From what I can gather from the complaints people have, I've come to (2) conclusions: either they are using lousy phones, or have lousy internet service. I use a wired phone on mine. Have toyed with the idea of using a wireless but haven't gotten around to it yet. My internet service is excellent. So there you are, the (2) variables. Let me say this. I'm paying $16 dollars a month for local phone service from AT&T. They then charged me $10 a month for (2) hours of long distance service EVERY month, whether I used (2) hours or not (which I don't). So I dropped the long distance service from AT&T and use the Magic Jack for long distance service only. Since I paid $30 for the Magic Jack on e-bay and I've had the thing for (6) months, I'm already money ahead. Would I use it as my primary phone, NEVER. But for long distance service, it's a winner.

Install was easy although instructions were virtually non existent. It works good, as good as or better than much pricier VOIP products I have used in the past. One word of caution: you apparently need pretty good bandwidth. If I am down loading a large file while speaking on the phone on occasion I loose my phone connection. All and all I am very pleased. In my opinion it is a real bargain.

You do have to factor in the cost... you do get what you pay for. The sound quality, customer service, and reliability are not as good as a land line. But for me it's good enough.. I just cancelled my land line a few weeks ago (I do have a cell phone too). Calls sound good most of the time. I had an old laptop lying around so I made that my 'magicjack' computer. I can leave it on and it doesn't use much power. I did read something about it cutting off your calls after an hour (then you have to call the person back again). But overall I'm satisfied.

10161	13	334601	3007450	3002029	richchrono	3/20/09 11:05 PM	1.2375903E12	Had it. Tossed it.	It was hit and miss for me. Worked sometimes, not others. XP or Vista didn't seem to matter. Sound quality was hit and miss, too. A few months into service, the voicemail stopped working. If I didn't answer, the caller would get a voice that said &quot;Goodbye&quot;... click! They never did get it working. When it came time to re-up for another year, I trashed it.

I think it would have worked very well, but for my type of connection, wireless @ 2 Meg down and 450 K upload. My signal bounces off of a neighbor's grain bin and then is sent on to the city, 8 miles away. It dialed numbers correctly and they answered, but could not hear me and all I heard was them cutting in and out rapidly. I really wanted it to work but it didn't. Their tech support worked with me for a good 45 minutes before giving up. As soon as I plugged it into the USB port, it immediately set itself up correctly without any help from me. I was told if I used a cordless phone, it had to be 6 feet away from the computer, and the dongle had to be plugged directly into the PC, and not a hub. Good luck.

Voice quality is inconsistent, sometimes good - sometimes terrible; never excellent. Voice mail sometimes just does not work. Have spent total of a few hours with tech support trying to make service consistent. Finally they just offered me a refund, which I declined because I need the phone for the occasions that i will be on the phone for an extended period of time (calls to public utilities, etc.). I have since purchased a second MagicJack so friends in another state can call me as though I were still local to them. (MagicJack is regularly adding service in new areas) If you have reliable cell phone service or wired home phone, MagicJack can be a suitable auxiliary, special use phone, but not reliable enough for one's primary phone. In summation, while the unique service is worth $20/year to me as an auxiliary phone it, unfortunately, does not replace a reliable home phone.

I bought 3 for my use,1 for home and 1 for my office and 1 for my daughter's room,Fax machines work great also with magicjack and each magic jack has there own phone number!!!I have cable internet and leave my computer online all the time in sleep mode,You only need a live internet for this to work,It will not work with dial-up service!

Sound quality isn't great but voices are perfectly understandable. I connected mine and it immediately trashed my sound drivers. I uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers with the Magic Jack dongle connected to my PC and haven't had a problem since. aside from that hassle, no complaints here.

I have made over 80 hours of long distance calls to my brothers in TX in the first month I've had it. I have also reconnected to many friends and family members now that I can call & talk for 'free'. The sound quality is quite good, there is no difference in performance when compared to land lines. What with my wife and I both having cell phones, even if 'Roadrunner' goes down we still have phone access. That is the only drawback to it. The computer has to be on for the phone to work. I am in the process of rehabing an old computer with a 1 gig hard drive to dedicate to my Magic Jack, and network it, so I can shut down my main computer.

It's performance depends a lot on the quality of your ISP. You MUST HAVE DSL or another kind of high speed connection. You MUST leave your computer on to receive calls. When your computer automatically updates & reboots itself, you may get an error msg saying &quot;broken storage&quot;. This will require you to reformat the drive that MJ is on. When you do this, you lose your stored contact list. Other than these glitches, it works very well & has saved me lots of money.

Although, its pretty sensitive to the internet connection. Often times, the audio quality is poor. It is definitely a money saver. I can call anytime, and it is very efficient.
10161	28	334601	5117554	3002029	MrLucky718	4/15/11 9:08 AM	1.30285848E12	Magic Jack Phone Service	Works great for me. I have used it going on 2 years. You must have a good broadband service if your picky about sound quality. I no longer have a land line. You must set up UDP ports 5060 an 5070 on your firewall for good flow thru or the sound will be choppy. I like it that my phone number is no longer listed, cuts down on sales calls. Forwards all voice mails to your email inbox. I use multiple (5) Uniden dect 6 phone system with mine and it works great. It has caller ID and you can forward your calls to your cell phone or any phone you want to. Free conference calling! Call any where in the US or Canada!
