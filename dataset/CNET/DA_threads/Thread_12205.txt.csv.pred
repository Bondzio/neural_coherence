1.2.1	mbr actually occupy very little space .	St
1.2.2	How did you partition the harddrive ?	Ques
1.2.3	Personally I probably would use 1Gb .	St
1.2.4	for the primary partition and 2Gb .	St
1.2.5	for the extended partition , in which you can form 1 or 2 logical drive , whichever you choose .	St
1.2.6	Try that to see if that would work .	St
