the main reason for these printers as i know it is to provide pc free access to print.
in other words, no pc is needed, it is a &quot;stand-alone&quot; device which is great as you to place some memory card or such and allow the printer to start a &quot;photo print&quot; from that source.
what you want or appears is basically a dual mode operation.
in effect a printer as always attached to a pc but has the provided ports to attach a memory card and start printing , again on its own.
what, if available is entirely should be explained in the specs of the printer reviewed.
if attached as a pc type printer you would think it still prints from the pc side as before but if on a memory card, will it?
that's the question you wanted answered.
this would be a feature they would want listed.
if all it provides is photo output when on memory card, then no docs, etc.., is supported.
