<s> Im looking at buying a AMD I see the athlons are more expensive then the semprons but are they that much better? </s>
<s> thx </s>
<s> if its only for basic word processing, surfing the net, instant messaging, email, etc. </s>
<s> then the sempron will do fine. </s>
<s> and it depends...if u get the low end athlon 3000+ or 3200+, there probably wont be much difference between those and the semprons. </s>
<s> however when u go higher, there is definitely a difference. </s>
<s> alot of photoshop, how much difference when you go higher then 3000 or 3200 </s>
<s> These days, my low end is the AMD Athlon 64 3500+. </s>
<s> Price is good. </s>
<s> If the budget is not so tight, my preference is a dual core CPU. </s>
<s> If you are going to do gaming and photoshop, then the Sempron or low end AMD will not help you there. </s>
<s> I agree that a dual core cpu is the best way for you to go. </s>
<s> If you can't go dual core, I suggest you get an AMD 64 3500+ or a 3700+. </s>
