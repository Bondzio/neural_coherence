I don't want to spend the time with putting together the enclosure. It needs to have at least 1 firewire port. I prefer it to be a quiet model and transfer at a quicker rate than most. Also, I would love a 16MB cache but it's not necessary. I've been looking at the Western My Book. Could anyone that owns it tell me about it?
