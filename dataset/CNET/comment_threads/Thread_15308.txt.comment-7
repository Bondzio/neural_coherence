I was at Best Buy recently.
I never shopped for MAGs.
I had been interested in a Viewsonic VX910 (19&quot;) I had seen at CompUSA.
I thought it was a great looking monitor next to the rest of the Samsungs, NECs, etc.
They have a 17&quot; version (VX710) which is very nice.
I wanted digital capabilites which this series had.
Eventually I took a chance on a Princeton and like it a lot.
The Viewsonic VXs are really nice too.
