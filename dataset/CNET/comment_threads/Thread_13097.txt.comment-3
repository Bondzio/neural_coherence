The Toshiba is connected via DVI-HDMI cable.
The desktop is extended onto this monitor, rather than cloned so I can still use the computer while watching movies.
The problem persists whether I list the Toshiba as the primary or secondary monitor.
I've tried playing around with the video card settings before posting without success.
I do not know how to change the frequency on the Toshiba.
I've checked the manual and did a web search without getting any info.
