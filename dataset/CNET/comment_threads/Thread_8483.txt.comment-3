Thanks for this insight.
I thought, it might have something to do with &quot;N&quot; but not enough to know that my interface cards need to support &quot;N&quot;.
I have not changed any interface cards on the computers and do not plan to.
So, I will be getting the &quot;G&quot; router.
Any suggestions one better than other.
I have ordered the Linksys (As I used to have that).
If there is another suggestion, please advise.
Thanks..
