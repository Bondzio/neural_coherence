1.2.4	Your choice of external enclosure will depend on your answer .	St
1.2.5	Either way , the connection of choice for the Mac is Firewire but USB 2.0 will do at a pinch .	St
1.2.6	( It 's not as fast . )	St
1.2.7	( Yes , I know that 480 is faster than 400 but when it comes to the crunch , USB 2.0 is slower overall ) So , a Firewire enclosure that is capable of supporting the type of connection , data and power , that the HD requires .	St
1.2.8	P	St
1.3.1	Sadly I see 8GB memory sticks which IMHO you can sell off the xbox intact and get 2 of the 8GB sticks .	St
