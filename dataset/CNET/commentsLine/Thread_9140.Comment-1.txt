i have a gateway gm5632e w/intel (schroeder town) g33 motherboard.
(intel matrix storage technology) running vista home premium the system is approx.
2 yrs old.
now vista will not boot.
now when i power on the unit i get a hang at the serial ata bios screen which detects the hdds and gives the following: serial ata bios upsd source 8-24-07 .... ahci bios installed (or) ahci bios not installed the sata bios hangs at this screen, so i cannot get into the system bios(which loads after this) to try to recover the os.
the only option that i get is to press &quot;ctl + i&quot; to enter the sata bios and create/delete the raid volumes.
i have done the following: 1. set the cmos jumper to maintenance (and got into the system bios 1 time) 2. pulled the cmos battery.
3. unplugged the sata drives 4. connected a different sata drive.
none of the above have helped me get past this sata bios post.
the computer hangs at that screen indefinately.
