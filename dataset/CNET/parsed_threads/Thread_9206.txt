<s> I am planning on buying a new Dell Optiplex 980 computer (finally). </s>
<s> The computer choice is fairly easy till I get to the GPU. </s>
<s> Planning on getting something like Corel Draw, but I haven't used any more hardcore programs of this type yet, so I have no idea what to look for. </s>
<s> One configuration is an i5 760 with a 1GB NVIDIA GT330. </s>
<s> There are other more GPUs offered, but to get a better choice of more &quot;pro&quot; oriented cards, I have to look more at a Precision line for more money. </s>
<s> Does the combo I'm looking decent for running something like CD? </s>
<s> The main thing is I don't want to spend all the money on a box where the MoBo won't accept a useable card. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> You skipped the low entry points of 310 and 320 so that's very nice. </s>
<s> Yes you could hop it up but you picked a very current i5 and a very nice GPU. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks Bob, I guess one problem with buying a Dell is their funky proprietary MoBos and PSUs that seem to limit the choice of GPUs (enough acronyms?). </s>
<s> I'm looking at Dells because I think their Pro Support is decent and this being for work, I want someone I can rely on to call for support and get it fixed quick should something go haywire. </s>
<s> Rob </s>
<s> Looking at full size dell desktops I see many standard size power supplies. </s>
<s> Yes I see the newer PCIe power connections but only a person from a decade ago might call them proprietary. </s>
<s> The motherboards (most) take standard PCIe video cards so not much to write there but the motherboard do tend to have the Dell 4 LED diagnostic lights but how else to deliver hardware diagnostics for all? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The reading I did mentioned having trouble with heatsink clearence with some GPUs, and the standard PSUs for the Opti are 300watt, which may not be enough for some higher-end GPUs (which seems like it's going to be overkill for me) and to put in a bigger PSU means messing around with rewiring the MoBo connectors... http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/286257-28-optiplex-minitower-heatsink-blocking-pcie-video-card I don't mind popping the case open to swap a few parts down the road if my needs change, but want as few hassels as possible. </s>
<s> Your example is a minitower. </s>
<s> Sorry but if you choose a small form factor it won't matter which maker you choose. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Only looking at the minitower. </s>
<s> In smaller cases no matter what the maker you get to check dimensions, clearance and power. </s>
<s> Nothing new here and it won't matter what maker. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> performance PCs. </s>
<s> Much better to go with mid or full-tower for such components. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> but it's not as big as a Studio XPS 9100. </s>
<s> I don't need that much HP. </s>
<s> I realize I won't be able to go with a monster 3D card, but I don't need to. </s>
<s> Just one that's big &quot;enough&quot;. </s>
<s> (I believe tha Precision workstation T1500 doesn't have a bigger case, and it's AutoCAD certified) Starting to see I really don't need that powerful of a card. </s>
