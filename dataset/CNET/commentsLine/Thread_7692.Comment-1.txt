we have a usb flash drive (san disk 1 gb).
yesterday it worked fine, but today, after trying from multiple computers (both pc and mac), the drive is not recognized.
furthermore, the usb drive's light does not turn on, so i suspect there is something wrong with the actual circuitry inside of the drive since it won't even get power.
is it possible to take the actual memory portion of the drive and get the data off the memory?
i don't think the data is corrupt, just the circuitry inside the drive.
thanks!
