on the cpu upgrade, id scrap the idea as it pertains to that box and look at other options.
while you can install another cpu, dell pcs are not designed with the idea of user cpu upgrades.
cpu options are made at time of purchase ...they are not like the multitude of motherboard manufacturers who later publish cpu support lists for products manufactured 2 or 3 years ago.
while there are any number of socket 478 intel cpus that will go into the socket....its really a crap shoot as to which ones would work as youd want them to in your system ..... there are issues in a number of areas ... bios, thermal, voltage, power supply, etc., etc.,.
if youve got money and time to burn ... go for it.
if you have a low threshold for pain and frustration, you'd be far better off looking at other options to increase performance.
