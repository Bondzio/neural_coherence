hi nunocruz79, were you able to find a nas that could do this (and dealt with the problems others have mentioned)?
or come up with another idea for how to get your tv's usb port to be able to access files on your network somehow?
i am facing the same issue with my tv - it only has the usb port (and expects a usb mass storage device).
and it's the best media browsing/playing device i've seen.
so it is annoying to think i need to use another (sub-standard) media box because i want ethernet access.
thanks!
