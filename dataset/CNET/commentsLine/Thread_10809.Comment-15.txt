i tried it and just sent it back.
i think it would have worked very well, but for my type of connection, wireless @ 2 meg down and 450 k upload.
my signal bounces off of a neighbor's grain bin and then is sent on to the city, 8 miles away.
it dialed numbers correctly and they answered, but could not hear me and all i heard was them cutting in and out rapidly.
i really wanted it to work but it didn't.
their tech support worked with me for a good 45 minutes before giving up.
as soon as i plugged it into the usb port, it immediately set itself up correctly without any help from me.
i was told if i used a cordless phone, it had to be 6 feet away from the computer, and the dongle had to be plugged directly into the pc, and not a hub.
good luck.
