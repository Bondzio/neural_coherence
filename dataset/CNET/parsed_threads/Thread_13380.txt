<s> My husband has a laptop (I'll get specs later if you need them) that dies only when he runs Norton antivirus. </s>
<s> It dies at different places during a scan so there's no clue there. </s>
<s> I had him run McAfee Virus Scan and guess what...yes, it dies during a McAfee Scan. </s>
<s> Any ideas?? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> Linda... </s>
<s> Try this. </s>
<s> If it has the SPEEDSTEP feature http://www.bay-wolf.com/speedstep.htm then you can slow the machine down and hopefully, if its a heat issue, you can complete the scan. </s>
<s> If not, look to a DOS BASED SCANNER like FPROT to see if it finds a pest. </s>
<s> In closing, NO DETAILS about the laptop, operating system and not much else means I can only offer generic advice which may be unuseful. </s>

<s> presumably you haven't made any rescue disk made by norton!! </s>
<s> - however, with some later versions you can boot to the norton virus instalation CD and run the DOS based virus scan from the CD (thats if you can boot to a cd with your laptop) Also make sure you hard disk doesn't have any errors by running scandisk in &quot;my computer&quot;. </s>

<s> Linda... 1. </s>
<s> Two anti-virus applications (these two) cannot exit together. </s>
<s> Uninstall one of them. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Prop the laptop off the table, anything will do, by a couple of inches. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Boot into safe mode and run your virus scans. </s>
<s> I've had scans stopped by viruses and have found Safe Mode the only way to complete the scans. </s>

<s> I forgot to get the specs of his laptop before he took it to work this morning. </s>
<s> I'll do that this evening and try your suggestions and see what happens. </s>
<s> Of course, he's campaigning for a new laptop :-} I'll get back to ya tomorrow! </s>
<s> Thanks so much. </s>
<s> Linda... </s>
<s> Hi, Well, my husband tried most of what you suggested last night,including trying to run Norton's Antivirus in safe mode which shut it down as it has in the past. </s>
<s> As in the past, as he restarted it, the disk scan said everything was okey dokey. </s>
<s> My husband is not a patient man when it comes to computer things and since the laptop is 4 years old and the case is cracked and the screen flickers (insert list of things to justifiy new laptop here..), he's decided that he WILL buy a new laptop tonight. </s>
<s> I'm hoping to get his 'old' laptop (an HP Pavilion 5400L with 512RAM and a Celeron processor) and then I'll run the rest of the tests! </s>
<s> LOL Thanks! </s>
<s> I shall return but probably not for a few weeks! </s>
<s> Linda... </s>
