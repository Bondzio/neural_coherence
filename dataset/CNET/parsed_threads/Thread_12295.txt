<s> I just gave up on a 5 year-old Thinkpad and need to retrieve the data on the hard drive. </s>
<s> The laptop itself won't boot (even from Linux on a CD). </s>
<s> So, if I get an external enclosure, is there anything I need to know? </s>
<s> I've read that you need to format drives to get them to recognise, but as this is 'recovery mission', that obviously isn't an option. </s>
<s> Any help/advice as to the type of enclosure or the process itself would be greatly appreciated. </s>

<s> The drive's interface. </s>
<s> It's a safe bet it's PATA. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The drive's height. </s>
<s> Usually it's 9.5 mm but while I'd say that I'd bet on it the odds are not as good as item 1. </s>

<s> Also, do a little research ahead of the move with these words in google.com XP TAKE OWNERSHIP Bob </s>
<s> If the drive fits into the enclosure, (PATA drive for PATA enclosure, SATA drive for SATA enclosure. </s>
<s> )you should be able to access your data, after &quot;taking poscession&quot;, if necessary. </s>
<s> As for formating the drive, your old drive with data should have already been formated. </s>
<s> The &quot;formating&quot; you referred to concerns a brand new drive fitted into the enclosure. </s>
<s> Take out the Hard Drive from the unbootable computer and put in enclosure. </s>
<s> Connect enclosure to another computer. </s>
<s> Access data, copy...tranfer to new computer or new HD. </s>
<s> It's definitely 9.5mm, but I'm not sure about PATA. </s>
<s> It's definitely way too early to be SATA though. </s>
<s> I think I recall it being EIDE - is that of any help at all? </s>

<s> It seems you have the usual drive so it's just a matter of getting a case now.. Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> Did get an enclosure, but the interface is wrong. </s>
<s> My drive (an IBM Travelstar) has a wider interface than the enlcosure, with two layers of ~20 pins. </s>
<s> The enclousure (a Dynex) has only one layer. </s>
<s> Did I get a SATA interface for a PATA drive? </s>
<s> As usual, the help is sincerely appreciated. </s>
