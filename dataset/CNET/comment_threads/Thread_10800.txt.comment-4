Where did you find the &quot;Processor shows up as x386.?
I'm almost positive windows 2000 won't run on a 386 and I have never seen a 386 that would hold 250mb of ram?
I'm guessin you probably got a 500mhz or somewhere between p2 to p3 computer.
If it has decent hard drive space then keep it around.
Go to Start/ Run/ and type dxdiag...
If direct x is installed it sould give you a better idea of bios version, os, processor speed ram etc.
