Alright, this may seem like a stupid question, but so far I couldn't find the answer.
Does anyone know what motherboard Dell ships in an XPS 410 if you select a Pentium D processor?
I know the 410 is made for Core 2 Duo and that the 400 was the one with Pentium D, but the 400 is gone now and I don't know the motherboard in either of them.
Help?
