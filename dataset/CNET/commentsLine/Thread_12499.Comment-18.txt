i am still running daily on the system i built in 2001. i first tried a white box package from a dealer.
my apartment building (at the time) had aluminum wiring.
this made the computer very unstable.
i upgraded the power supply to an enermax 350 watt with no effect.
i went back to the dealer and had them swap to a asus a7v266-e motherboard.
all the errors stopped.
i think it has lasted so long because it has an onboard filtered power supply.
it was consistently among the best performing boards on ars technica at the time.
the only changes i have made were to replace the memory stick when it expired with one from mushkin, and the video card when it expired recently.
it has a 40gb hard disk from samsung.
i have no idea why that that has lasted for so long.
i have used win2k ever since and have avoided most of the issues other have reported, first with winxp and since then with vista.
i would love a new system but they are really not much faster than the one i have.
