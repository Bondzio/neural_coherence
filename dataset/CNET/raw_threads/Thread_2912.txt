Installed same, and my old odd noise is gone. Of course this supply has 2 fans, so now listening to a bit more &quot;whoosh&quot; noise. But this is totally acceptable, compared to what I had been hearing, so PS did fix my problem. Just wanted to let you know.

Here'sa link to a post by Robert Proffitt. Keep it in mind if things recur. The result of bad capacitors on a mobo can increase the magnitude of the noise [AC] current being absorbed by the caps in the power supply and eventually cause them to overheat and fail. I am glad this his shop found this. http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7591-0.html?forumID=26&threadID=40719&messageID=477534

After removing old PS unit, popped the top, and found no bulging, or leaking electrolytics, but did see a resistor, about 2 watt job, that the coating, enamel, ceramic, I don't know, had fallen off in a little pile around the resistor. Makes me guess the thing had been overheating. Anyway, the note I wanted to make is that I scavenged the fan from the supply (ball bearing job), spliced in a connector from my pile of other dead things, and now have a new case fan. LOL. Actually this computer only came with a HSF, and the PS fan. No case fans. Wasn't running hot in the first place, about 30 degrees C, but now running at 26. Icicles are starting to form. LOL.
