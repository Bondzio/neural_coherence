I'll keep this contained to my personal experiences.
I have more than one 1.5TB USB drive as I maintain backups and beyond those I have other backups on DVD, USB memory sticks and more.
The machines the 1.5TB USB drives are used on are a collection of machines at the office with Vista, 7 with AMD dual core, Core Duo, Core 2 Duo and i5 CPUs.
It all works so I'd wonder why anyone would write it doesn't.
