personally.
i prefer to build my own desktops but as far as laptops go, i've had great luck with toshiba's stuff.
my wife should be a tester for laptops because she can find the weak point to any system whether it be software or hardware.
she goes through laptops like i change my underwear, which suits me just fine because i get her hand-me-downs and after some simple repairs, most often, i have a great little machine.
shes now testing an hp, which is holding up pretty well except its barely a year old and shes already talking about a new one.
her last gift to me was a toshiba that i had to stick a new hard drive in because she let it sit, turned on, overnight, on the sofa with a blanket covering the vents, repeatedly until it just cooked the hard drive.
amazing how where they place the vents has so much to do with how long they last.
but, i didnt see toshiba on the list so i thought i would stick that one in there.
