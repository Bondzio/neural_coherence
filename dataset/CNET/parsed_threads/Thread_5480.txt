<s> I think I asked this question before and got something of a vague response. </s>
<s> I have a Dell computer from 2006 (An XPS 410) and my video card is an nVidia GEForce 9500 GT. </s>
<s> Now I've heard that with some resolutions it's not possible to see the computer on the TV screen, but 640x480 works best and full-screen games are just fine. </s>
<s> My monitor is capable of going to 640x480. </s>
<s> Now my other question is that I'm planning on getting a new computer soon (also a Dell, not sure which one yet). </s>
<s> It's going to be widescreen, whereas the one I have now is a standard definition resolution monitor. </s>
<s> Will that impact what cable I need or will it work for both an older and a newer computer? </s>
<s> I'm quite confused by this so any help is much appreciated! </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> No mention of the make, model of the TV as well as what connections are on the PC. </s>
<s> I fear the answers must remain vague without details. </s>
<s> For example you connect same to same video inputs and outputs. </s>
<s> It's that simple. </s>

<s> Well my TV now has the standard S-Video ports (red, white, yellow) although I suppose in the future I could get an HDTV. </s>
<s> The make of the TV is Sansui, I'm not even familiar with the company. </s>
<s> Not sure what the model is, but does it matter? </s>
<s> I thought all that mattered were the connections. </s>
<s> I have no fancy connections on the computer, just the outlets and the monitor. </s>
<s> Your standard red, yellow white AV connections while not S-Video (see http://www.google.com/images?hl=en&q=svideo ) are rarely found on a PC. </s>
<s> BE very clear that composite and svideo is going to be unacceptable to most (so far nearly 100%!) </s>
<s> so I strongly suggest you don't spend a dime on this. </s>
<s> Unless your PC has composite out why not try this another way? </s>
<s> Many want to watch content from the PC on the TV but given we are going to get 1/3 to 1/4 the pixels as the VGA display again you find that folk after expending money and effort are often upset with the results. </s>
<s> This changes if you have a HDTV. </s>

<s> Does this TV have a monitor,or HDMI connector on it? </s>
<s> if so,you'll dig it...otherwise it's a fuzzy waste. </s>
<s> Also,is your 9500GT built in the motherboard,or did you add it later? </s>
<s> Look on the back of it...it probably has an s-video plug. </s>
<s> (hey guys,they have HDMI outputs on video cards yet?). </s>
<s> Analog will drive you insane,and S-video will make ya beat your dog. </s>
<s> (Maybe your 9500 has HDMI output,it resembles a USB slot) The fuzzy picture you get on your TV will dissapoint unless you run a LCD,plasma,or theater projector.They look as good as any PC monitor. </s>
<s> The number of pins in the connector used dictates how good the TV picture will look: 1)MONITOR:12 pins (lose job & girlfriend) 2)HDMI vs 12 pin? </s>
<s> (Similar to 12 pin) 2)COMPSITE:6 pins (never seen these) 3)S-VIDEO: 4 pins (Begin to hate PCs) 4)ANALOG: 2 pins (housecleaning is more fun) Second: Your video card can throw super hi-def in widescreen(16:9),OR standard (4:3)...it's in the cards settings,and has nothing to do with whatever screen used. </s>
<s> NOTE:monitors support limited resolutions,but far more than 640x480....unless your TV/monitor is ancient. </s>
<s> So if I DO get an HDTV and obtain a newer model (2010, 2011) computer, my best option is to go with composite connections? </s>
<s> Could you explain a bit further on composite and what I'd need to go ahead and do that? </s>
<s> Maybe my best bet would've been to wait until I get a new computer and an HDTV before I ask again. </s>
<s> My computer/TV are fairly old. </s>
<s> The computer is a 2006 model and the TV I'm not even sure of. </s>
<s> I basically bought it used at a yard sale. </s>
<s> It might be a 2004/2005 model but I'm not sure. </s>
<s> But I explained this and I fear one more time will not improve it. </s>
<s> Try this. </s>
<s> Head to a store and have them explain the options again. </s>
