<s> I am trying to set up a home network and i am hoping to some advice here.Thank you ,in advance, for any help you can give me. </s>
<s> I would like to hook up 3 computers to,in my home, to a network so they can all be online at same time. </s>
<s> will the new cisco Valet, work. </s>
<s> i have a cable modem in my home, wireless is not that important. </s>
<s> i will have all computers wired . </s>
<s> thanks again for any help. </s>
<s> looks like it has 4 wired ports. </s>
<s> This should work fine and almost be plug and play. </s>
<s> You didn't say anything about your PCs other than you'd use them wired so I'd shut down the wireless radio for now. </s>
<s> All should go on line fairly easily. </s>
<s> You'd want to allow the modem to detect and configure the router. </s>
<s> You do this by shutting down the modem, connect the router and turn it on, wait for it to fully initialize and then turn on the modem. </s>
<s> Should be simple enough. </s>
