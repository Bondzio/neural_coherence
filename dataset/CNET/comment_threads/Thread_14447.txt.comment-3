My WD Passport is still in the box.
My boyfriend got the same external hardrive and when he istalled it, it only took 4 gigs.
He needed to get someone over to reformatt it to be able to work with his machine.
My machine has 160G.So i am jumping ahead in case I too will have to reformatt.
If it is easy, i will attempt it myself,if not I will have someone come over.
I was hoping you just plug it into the usb and go.
Maybe that is the case.
Thanks!
