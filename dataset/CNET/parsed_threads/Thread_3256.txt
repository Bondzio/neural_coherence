<s> I'm about to pull my hair out with my computer I posted about this problem a while back and everyone here was very helpful and much appreciated by me.. OK to recap I purchased a Pioneer DVR-109 DVD burner and for a time it worked perfectly in my machine and I was able to do everything with it. </s>
<s> All of a sudden in one night though it started playing up in that it would start burning a disk and get almost all the way through then it would come to a stop and say &quot;could not perform end track&quot; and that there was a communications error with the drive. </s>
<s> I took the drive out of my machine and replaced it with my old CD burner and that worked perfectly and so far has not played up. </s>
<s> As a precaution I took my DVD burner to the place I purchased it they sent it off to be looked at and it came back with a report saying they had no trouble with it.. </s>
<s> I put it back into my machine and it still played up. </s>
<s> So now I'm about to throw the drive through the window.... Can anyone suggest anything, maybe that I have not tried. </s>
<s> Reduce/end any bkgrd. </s>
<s> running pgms. </s>
<s> before burning. </s>
<s> DVD and CD burners are different devices even though very similar. </s>
<s> Google for upper/lower filters cure and see if that helps(long shot). </s>
<s> Next, if the DVD burner still misbehaves take it back and get another burner replacement, not the same one. </s>
<s> Explain, if the burner worked for awhile(30days or less) but longer than that(90days? </s>
<s> ), it really hasn't provided good service and should be replaced. </s>
<s> However, I found many a burner not last longer than 1yr. </s>
<s> if used on a regular basis. </s>
<s> Make sure any s/w issues are resolved if found. </s>
<s> Check with Pioneer support for any possible &quot;firmware&quot; updates. </s>
<s> If you haven't already check with Ms for possible updates as well, especially for older XP releases. </s>
<s> Last, try another DVD media brand, use a good known namebrand for best results, in fact try that right off the bat. </s>
