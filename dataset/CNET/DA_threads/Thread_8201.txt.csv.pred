1.1.1	Okay so I was in BIOS and decided to do a really STUPID thing.	St
1.1.2	I saw this place that said CPU speed.	St
1.1.3	It stated 133mhz.	St
1.1.4	I hit enter.	St
1.1.5	It said to put in a value bewteen 133 and 200, so I put 200.	St
1.1.6	And then I saved and exited.	St
1.1.7	Anyway, it went to restart, and I have no response from my monitor.	St

1.1.10	At startup the Hard drive dosen't do its usual beep.	St
1.1.11	Please help.	St
1.1.12	Do I need to reset BIOS?	St
1.1.13	If so, how would I go about doing that without actually going in to the BIOS.	St
1.1.14	I dont think my mobo is shot, because I recieve the annoying long beep if I take my RAM out.	St
1.1.15	The only other thing I can think of is that the processor is shot.	St
1.1.16	I put my ear close to it and can hear noise but I'm not sure if thats how it usually sounds because I dont ever listen to my processor up close.	St

1.4.1	that your attempt to use 200 MHz was an poor attempt at overclocking.	St
