Most all the equipment you buy today has been tested for surge protection but is integral to that system.
Surge protectors and a good grounding system that includes ground fault interupters on the distribution (fuse/breaker) panel.
A UPS will provide good protection but the source of ground is the most important as surges will breakdown internally if a proper ground is not found.
Lightning protection will stop surges before they can get to surge protectors but need to be installed on every line that comes into the home.
All these devices are designed to be a one shot deal, once struck or surged, they will destroy themsleves to provide the protection.
