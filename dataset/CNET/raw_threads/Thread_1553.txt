Our local CATV is a small operation. There are a limited number of HDTV channels available if you have a newer TV or digital tuner. I'm trying to find an inexpensive way to get a tuner (s) that allows me to access these unencripted digital open QAM channels. I read somewhere that a Sony HDTV Satellite Receiver SAT HD300 might be an inexpensive way to go. There are some available via Ebay. would any Satellite Direct TV or Dish Network equipment have some of the same capabilities. There are pawn shops or thrift shops around that have used equipment. While I am looking primarily at a stand alone tv by tv solution, I am running a network in house. DSL (Action tek DSL router internet), CATV (TV's), SageTV - SageTV HD media box, - Roku box, Whole house is networked back to central closet RG6 Quad shield, Cat5, running Windows XP (2 pcs), Pro (1 PC), Ubuntu 9.6 vers (1 Pc) Would the HDHomeRun Dual ATSC/QAM Digital TV Tuner offer any solution ?

As for the Sony, it's for DirecTV and needs monthly fee. If you look very hard then maybe you can find one. Good hunting.
