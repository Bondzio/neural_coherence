<s> I had an I/O Magic DVD+/-RW I bought back in 2004 that recently died. </s>
<s> It was an 8 speed (8X). </s>
<s> I recently bought a Samsung SH-S182M LightScribe 18X DVDRW as a replacement unit for it. </s>
<s> I'm buying the 18 speed discs for it, but I have a question. </s>
<s> Do I have to get rid of all my old 8X-16X discs I had or, can I still use them on my new drive? </s>
<s> I'm currently running the Nero 6 software that came with the Samsung. </s>
<s> Nero has an option that allows you to slow down the burn speed for CD's, but I didn't notice one for DVD's. </s>
<s> Please advise. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> If all is as it should be, you just use what speed media you have and the software adjusts automatically. </s>

<s> ...I received an error message telling me to pick a slower speed and try again. </s>
<s> I'll keep at it though. </s>
<s> Thanks Sir. </s>
<s> Evidently my drive had performance anxiety for its first few burn attempts. </s>
<s> It works fine now. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
