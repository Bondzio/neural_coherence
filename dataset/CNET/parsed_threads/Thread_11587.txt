<s> We are using XP as an operating system in our office; all the files on every pc are place on the network drives (about 6 or 8 network drives). </s>
<s> How can I backup or sync all network drives on an external drive which is on the server? </s>
<s> What softwares can I use for this task? </s>
<s> I need something that works on by schedule. </s>
<s> The computers are Pentium 4 with at least 2 GB ram, so they are far outdated and that is one of my problems. </s>
<s> I'm using a &quot;WD MY BOOK ESSENTIAL 3.0&quot;, wherein if I place that in the computers they usually hang, that are why the only way to use the external is to place it in the server for continuous backup or syncing... </s>
<s> I really need your help please, if you can guide me or show me any sites to study about this... </s>
<s> Thank you so much by just reading this and it will be a big help if you can help me out... </s>
<s> Since Windows locks and blocks access to some files when it's running I need to know if you truly meant every file. </s>
<s> If you meant a selection of folders and the files in those folders (excluding applications and the OS) then there are fine file sync software titles such as SyncBack, GoodSync that can run on a schedule. </s>

<s> can i use SYNCBACK for back-uping or syncing a whole network drive. </s>
<s> It consist of files like exec, doc, gint, and sort of images...? </s>
<s> how to do it ^_^ so i think i need to install it on the server by doing a remote desktop and put the SYNCBACK there, then i connect the external hard drive (WD MY BOOK ESSENTIAL 3.0) also on the server...? </s>
<s> am i doing the right thing..? </s>
<s> thank you so much </s>
<s> What is that &quot;exec&quot; item? </s>
<s> Sorry, I can't tell what your right thing is. </s>
<s> We know that we can't backup windows while windows is running. </s>
<s> We can backup our files but not programs and apps. </s>
<s> That's why I thought we'd get that out of the way first. </s>
<s> Syncback/goodsync run on the client PC and can backup to many things or places. </s>
<s> I can't possibly replace the web site of those softwares but I'll start with yes to that area. </s>
