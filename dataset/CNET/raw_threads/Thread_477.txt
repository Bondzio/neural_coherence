After i got everything basic done, i installed all my drivers from the cds, for my mobo, gfx card, and hard drive. Then i went online, and downloaded updated drivers for everything. But now im having massive problems with my computer in terms of gfx, especially in gaming. Used to be i could run all the new source games just fine, long loads yes, but they still ran fine on medium settings. Now i can barely run the older half life games, i cant even play DOD without tons of lag, and my framerate being shot to hell. I have also experienced other problems, including the icons on the desktop, the semi-transparent area around them just comes out as black, so they look jagged and ugly. I also cant watch videos on the internet. I get this green screen instead and my computer slows down horribly. Now i have opened up my case, and i have made sure everything was tightened down, i even unhooked my extra hard drives to see if it was too much for my power supply. I am clueless as to whats wrong, but my sister is willing to help me out and buy a few replacement parts. Not a full new system like i thought at first, but just things like maybe a new gfx card or power supply. What i need to know is what i need to do, cause i am clueless as to whats wrong. Heres my system specs if that helps: Gigabyte KT600 K7 Triton 400 FSB Motherboard AMD Athlon XP 2200+ 512mb PC2700 Corsair memory Gainward nVidia GeForce FX 5200 128mb Creative 24-BIT Sound Card RAIDMAX Scorpio ATX-868WBP Black Computer Case w\420watts Power Supply Segate 250gb IDE HD Sony CD-RW Sony DVD-ROM 8 LED Case Fans Im pretty sure thats it. I mean before i installed the new hard drive, i added 2 new fans. Other than that i cant think of anything else. Any advice would rock!! Thanks before hand!!

Do you think it would work to get a new gfx card and psu? i mean thats not too much, since i have to get agp, i can get a GeForce 5500 from a friend, that he never used for about $50, and i can get a 500w psu for around $70, so i can get both of those right now, i just wanted to know if thats what i should do. I wanna make sure its nothing else. Because one of the other things ive thought about, is that i used Knoppix linux-on-a-cd on my comp. to transfer files off my old hard drive, which the windows on it got fully corrupted. After i finished moving most files, i went to move my fonts over, and i tried going into the windows folder, and it crashed linux. Ever since then, my computer has felt slower, like the load of knoppix felt slower. I was thinking the crash might have done something to my ram, since knoppix loads completly in the ram, but i hace no idea, which is why i am asking here

They typically lose between 15% and 30%. That puts you in the range. I would get a 500W because you undoubtedly will be adding on stuff later. Let us know. and life goes on.... Jack
