<s> I am considering buying a LCD Wide Screen Monitor but I don't want a circle to look oblong. </s>
<s> Will the computer compensate for the wider screen and keep the same aspect ratio as I had with the standard monitor? </s>
<s> The software you use will have to do that. </s>
<s> For example, I don't have an issue with browsers or IRFANVIEW. </s>

<s> on your video card. </s>
<s> My main PC's video card has a lot of resolution options and I was able to find one that worked. </s>
<s> My other PC's video card did not have the proper resolution and the screen was stretched. </s>
<s> A wide screen monitor will need something like 1440 X 900 resolution (wide screen). </s>
<s> If your video card does not have this available, you'll get a stretched picture. </s>
<s> Thank you, coryphaeus! </s>
<s> I've been suffering with elongated images since I &quot;inherited&quot; an HPw19 from my son. </s>
<s> (It came with his new computer. </s>
<s> He couldn't stand the stretched image, so kept his old standard aspect ratio 19&quot; monitor when he sold me his old computer.) </s>
<s> I switched to 1440x900, as you suggested, and now I have incredibly sharp, standard ration windows inside my 16:9 display. </s>
<s> Beautiful. </s>
<s> Should I tell my son? </s>
<s> Thanks again, Ron </s>
<s> Thanks ! </s>
<s> You solved my problem with a 22.5&quot; wide screen monitor. </s>
