<s> I was trying to help a friend set up his wireless router. </s>
<s> He had the Geeksquad come and set it up and I have no idea what they did. </s>
<s> A mess of wires. </s>
<s> I noticed that I was able to log into the imbeded browser of the modem and the router from the main PC. </s>
<s> I didn't think it was possible to log into the modem if it was set up in bridged ethernet mode. </s>
<s> His internet is working but I was thinking that he may have problems with double NATing. </s>
<s> Basically, I just want to know what options there are for setting up a router to a modem. </s>
<s> I'm aware of bridged mode and setting up the router as a switch (not real knowledgable of this one). </s>
<s> But before I tell him it's set up all wrong, I want to know if I'm missing something. </s>
<s> Seems like DHCP is enabled on both devices. </s>
<s> Please advise. </s>
<s> If it works I would leave it alone. </s>
<s> The problem with double nat is mostly related when you need a incoming session into a local PC. </s>
<s> If all the traffic outbound then it doesn't matter. </s>
<s> Pretty much depends on the IP for the modem and the router are on the same subnet. </s>
<s> If they are on different ones then you have a double nat. </s>
<s> Running DHCP on both will work well in most cases but again it depends if you need to map ports to a PC. </s>
<s> The outside address of the router could technically change so mapping would change. </s>
<s> If there is no mapping of ports then it can change all it wants and the user PC does not care. </s>
<s> There is nothing wrong with double nat it tends to be confusing for people to get setup and to debug when there are issues. </s>
<s> Once it is works it works </s>
<s> I didn't know where to start with the print sever on this setup. </s>
<s> I just knew that the modem should be in bridged mode and the router should be left to do the address translations. </s>
<s> I've never seen a setup with double NATing before, so I thought something was wrong. </s>
<s> He's trying to connect a wireless linksys print server when he already has a wireless router. </s>
<s> Should just be a non-wireless print server. </s>
<s> I think I may leave that one alone. </s>
<s> know enough to be real dangerous. </s>
<s> Your post is light on specifics such as type of connection, make and model of modem and router, and operating system. </s>
<s> So here is the generic setup. </s>
<s> First, you don't need to access the modem unless you're just looking around. </s>
<s> Second, set both the modem and the router to default. </s>
<s> If there is a software switch, use it. </s>
<s> If there is a reset button use it. </s>
<s> Turn everything off. </s>
<s> Now, connect everything thus: modem -&gt; router -&gt; PC Power up the modem, wait for the lights to stabilize. </s>
<s> Power on the router, wait for the lights. </s>
<s> Power up the PC. </s>
<s> On the desktop, right click Network Neighborhood, choose properties and choose to show the Networking icon in the tray. </s>
<s> Only to see if traffic is moving. </s>
