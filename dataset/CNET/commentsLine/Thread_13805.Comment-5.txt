i have an older lexar secure jumpdrive and they didn't honor thier warranty.
i jumped thru the hoops and still didn't get anything.
so, imho they're less than whale poop.
however, others had good experiences.
as for memorex, they're on the same level as many vendors to include lexar.
i would recommend you looking into kingston brand flashdrives, they've been well made and appear to last.
i still use my 32mb when the need arises.
it seems flashdrives are always on sale somewhere so check into other brands you feel comfortable with.
