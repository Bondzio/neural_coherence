<s> This is probably a stupid question but why does windows hardwar information show incorrect information about my hardware, this has happened to me on every pc i have owned, on my current PC, i have 512mb of ram installed, windows says i have 384mb and I have a 2.4ghz processor, and windows shows that I have a 1.81ghz, (when I upgraded to x64 it showed that I ran at 2.2ghz) Why does windows do this? </s>
<s> does this happen to everybody? </s>
<s> Microsoft didn't make your PC and you may have a PC made after the version of Windows shipped. </s>
<s> There are no plans (Microsoft) &quot;to fix cosmetic issues.&quot; If you do obtain such a machine from Dell or such and this matters to you, why not make it a warranty issue or claim it's a Dead On Arrival and you want it to not have this defect? </s>

<s> no, i was just wondering if it was a hardware problem or just windows being stupid and wasteful again </s>
<s> After many years I've learned that Microsoft will pass on fixing &quot;cosmetic&quot; issues. </s>
<s> Since they don't make your machine, they won't fix this or that. </s>
<s> -&gt; There are a few that want a bugfree or efficient OS. </s>
<s> Such has yet to be seen. </s>
