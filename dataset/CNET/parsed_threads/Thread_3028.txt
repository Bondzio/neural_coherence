<s> I'm trying to establish a wireless network that does more than just allow broadband internet access, which I've achieved thru cable modem to Linksys BEFW-11S4-v.2 4-Port Wireless Router cabled to my main HP Pavillion Desktop. </s>
<s> My other 3 desktop PC's use Linksys Access Points to communicate with the router to gain flawless internet broadband access. </s>
<s> My notebook PC, Toshiba A-35 uses an Atheros AR500-1X plus a wireless Network Adaptor. </s>
<s> All of these PC's are on XP-Home and all have excellent internet access. </s>
<s> But, I'm having trouble setting up a LAN that allows greater access from PC-to-PC to enable file sharing and printer/peripheral sharing. </s>
<s> My main desktop (HP Pavillion), which is connected to the Router does not show a wireless connection (in tray at bottom), but instead shows Local Area Network. </s>
<s> However, my other PC's & Notebook all show a Wireless Connection. </s>
<s> I've disabled my McAfee Firewall. </s>
<s> I just don't know how to accomplish the rest. </s>
<s> Can anyone offer suggestions? </s>
<s> For file and print sharing to occur you need the following: 1) All workgroup names the same 2) Some resource set to share 3) Firewalls disabled or uninstalled until you have a working network 4) File and print sharing enabled 5) TCP/IP installed </s>
