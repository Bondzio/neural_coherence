okay, slap me upside the head.
i feel foolish.
i just took a look at the link that you gave me.
when i did i read something about a win98 issue.
gave me the idea to run program compatability wizard on it.
ran it.
and retried install.
works.
i just installed it and it went on cleanly.
i got as far just now as the menu.
.
i wonder if that's my issue with generals.
except i thought that it would support xp.
i'll give her a try.
