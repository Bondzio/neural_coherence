<s> Hi, my question is, how can I best optimize this motherboard to play the latest games like Splinter cell &quot;double agent&quot;, Oblivion etc... </s>
<s> Here is what I have currently. </s>

<s> The CPU has to be a Socket A which limits things a bit. </s>
<s> Also, the AGP for graphics is somewhat old as PCI-e has taken over things. </s>
<s> I also think that if you look at even a Socket 939 motherboard you could get things sped up quite a bit as well as possibly get a dual-core processor which would also help as new games will likely take advantage of the additional processing power. </s>

<s> if I go with the 939 AMD socket, what would be a good motherboard to buy. </s>
<s> &quot;Asus' A8N32-SLI Deluxe&quot; is what I have in my home PC. </s>
<s> &quot;eVGA nForce4 SLI&quot; is another idea if you look at ExtremeTech's $800 budget gaming PC. </s>

<s> extreme tech, great website to see what others put together and with great reviews. </s>
