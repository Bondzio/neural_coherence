the power cable, you mean thye 4 pin connector that plugs into newer mobos?
not sure if yours needs that, and you understand about 24 pin cables.
i would highly recommend updating your drivers (video and sound) as that's where most problems begin.
what's your paging size set at?
i would upgrade ram, but xp can be used on 256mb.
