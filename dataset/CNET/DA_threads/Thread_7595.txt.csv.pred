1.7.1	Something you might like to think about .	St
1.7.2	I have two HP printers one DJ350 and a 3in 1 .	St
1.7.3	Both developed significant faults .	St
1.7.4	The 3in1 would not print in Word but would print a web page .	St
1.7.5	The DJ450 would not print in colour .	St
1.7.6	We tried everything but could not improve the situation .	St
1.7.7	Some months later we had to re-install Windows XP and lo and behold both printers worked perfectly .	St
1.7.8	I have no idea what the fault was but re-installing the printer software did n't improve the situation .	St
1.7.9	I have damaged my Canon Pixma MP170 installation CD and could do with a copy software or CD .	St
