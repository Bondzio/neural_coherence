<s> Hi, I just finished building my first operational PC. </s>
<s> Here are the specs: AMD Athlon 64 X2 6000+ XFX nForce 750a SLI Patriot DDR2 PC6400 800 Mhz 2x2048 1 250g WD HDD 1 320g WD HDD Windows Vista Ultimate x86 Everything is going fine withe exception of configuring the eSATA port to work with an external hard drive that I have. </s>
<s> I installed a sata cable and connected it to one of the available sata ports on the mobo and the other end to the port just behing the esata port. </s>
<s> No joy. </s>
<s> PC doesn't recognize it. </s>
<s> I'm thinking that there may be something that I need to do in BIOS but have no idea what it is. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> by the system during the bootup ? </s>
<s> Is the external partitioned or formatted ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> lol. </s>
<s> I know how to get to the BIOS, just not what setting in the BIOS is need to manipulate. </s>
<s> Its an external drive and it is formatted but not partitioned. </s>
<s> I actually already have data on it. </s>
<s> So yeah. </s>
<s> Since we can't format a drive unless it has a partition I'd like to know how you stored data on a drive without a partition! </s>
<s> I bet you meant there is one partition? </s>
<s> And just fixed an ESATA today. </s>
<s> The owner didn't know the external needed a power connection too. </s>
<s> They had some case and the SATA all right. </s>
<s> The clue was the drive didn't spin. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> has any idea exactly what you know (or don't know) and what you've done (or haven't done) unless you spell it out or say it. </s>
<s> For example when you say the external is formatted but not partitioned ... sorry ... you can't format any hard disk I know of if it isn't partitioned whether it's only one partition or 10 partitions. </s>
<s> That said ... in the BIOS I'd double check under 'Advanced', then under 'Onboard Devices'. </s>
<s> Unfortunately the MB manual doesn't seem to go into any detail beyond those headings re what options/setting are possible. </s>
<s> Not sure I follow how the external SATA port works ...is it direct thru the MB or do you need to run an SATA cable from one of the SATA ports at the front (SATA 1-6) to that SATA connector near the back ? </s>
<s> Is the eSATA drive connected during bootup or are you plugging it in afterwards ? </s>
<s> I did find this note in the MB manual 'eSATA:Connects to peripherial SATA devices. </s>
<s> The SATA cable one side insert ESTA1 connect, another side can insert SATA1,SATA2,SATA3,SATA4.' </s>
<s> Let us know what you do to make it work. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Okay. </s>
<s> Understand all. </s>
<s> I have never put a partition on the drive nor have I had to personally format even from first use. </s>
<s> Therefore, I say that the drive is formatted or its the first external HD that I have had to use that didn't need to be formatted before initial use. </s>
<s> What I have done, using that same information that you found, is connect a sata cable from sata 5 to the sata connection just behine the DVI output on the mobo itself. </s>
<s> I orginally connect to sata 3 as 1 and 2 are being used by other HD's. </s>
<s> I will try again. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
