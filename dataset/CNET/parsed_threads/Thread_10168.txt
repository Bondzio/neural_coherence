<s> i have 2 linksys routers. </s>
<s> one is in another room connected to my hughes net box (internet) that one sends my internet to my laptop. </s>
<s> i have a swann camera system, i need to connect the swann system to the other linksys router so i can connect to the internet. </s>
<s> how do i keep my laptop from picking up the one that is connected to swann and how do i get the one connected to swann to recieve from linksys router so it will connect to internet... i hope my question makes sense.... thank you </s>
<s> Maybe not possible depends on the exact models of the routers. </s>
<s> So I assume the cameras are wired? </s>
<s> To get your 2 routers to talk they either both need a feature called bridging or the non internet router need to have a feature that lets you run in client mode. </s>
<s> In either case the non internet router will not be running in AP mode so you don't have to worry about your PC. </s>
<s> Even if were to run both routers in the default AP mode and hook them together with a cable you could always use SSID to control which you PC attached to. </s>
