1.1.1	Hi , I have a Dimension 3000 Pentium 4 computer with 256MB ram .	St
1.1.2	I would like to upgrade to 2 GB .	St
1.1.3	I found cheap ram on ebay and I contacted the seller to be sure that the ram is compatable .	St
1.1.4	The seller replied that my computer only can work with & quot ; Low density & quot ; ram and s/he refered me to another product that is more than double the price because it is & quot ; low density & quot ; .	St
1.1.5	The high density ram page is : http : //cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll ? ViewItem & item=310096884056 & ssPageName=ADME : X : RTQ : US:1123 And the Low density page is : http : //cgi.ebay.com/1GB-PC3200-DDR-LOW-DENSITY-UNIVERSAL-RAM-MEMORY_W0QQitemZ120268766088QQihZ002QQcategoryZ44936QQcmdZViewItemQQ_trksidZp1742.m153.l1262 What do you think ?

1.3.1	Thanks for the reply .	St
1.3.2	All that link tells me is that it uses DDR ram , 184 PINs but it does n't mention whether they are & quot ; high density & quot ; or & quot ; low density & quot ; and whether the & quot ; high density & quot ; ram would be compatible .	St
1.4.1	you something that wo n't work and will have to be returned for the right product .	St
1.4.2	That 's a lot of hassle and wasted energy .	St
1.4.3	If you look at Crucial.com , RAM for your PC is in the same price range .	St
