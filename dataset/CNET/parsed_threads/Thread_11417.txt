<s> I have an older UMAX ASTRA 1200S scanner using an SCSI card. </s>
<s> Purchased a new Sony VIO model VGC-RA828G. </s>
<s> Will an SCSI card be required to connect scanner to new PC???? </s>
<s> Sony manual does not cover this topic. </s>
<s> While a new SCSI card will do, then what about scanner drivers and applications? </s>
<s> 99.99% of the time, a new scanner is cheaper. </s>

<s> Bob's idea is good! </s>
<s> A used SCSI card on ebay $20~30. </s>
<s> New $90 XP will have drivers is it's an Adaptic card. </s>
<s> Now will drivers that came with your scanner work in XP since they were written for Win98??? </s>
<s> I'm going to find out since I have a old UMAX scsi scanner and my 98se machine is realy old. </s>
<s> The only reason I'm going try is my scanner is a highend model and cost a lot of $$$$$ and has a transparency adapter. </s>
<s> I'll repost with results. </s>

<s> I have the SCSI card that came with it. </s>
<s> So installing it isn't a problem. </s>
<s> I just thought the new systems came with an SCSI port. </s>
<s> Guess I was wrong. </s>
<s> When we updated the old computer from Win98se to ME I had to go to UMAX and order a new version of their software. </s>
<s> At that time they said they would not be updating to XP compatable. </s>
<s> I looked again the other day and found that they did update to XP and they have new software that should work with the scanner. </s>
<s> I hate to get rid of it. </s>
<s> It has such a high resolution (9800 x 9800) and it copies legal size documents. </s>
