i go into the disk management and tried deleting and creating a new partition, it will only allow me to create a 32gb partition...even using ntfs.
i have a laptop with xp fully updated and that is where i'm trying to connect the drive.
i used my old pc to connect the drive internally and format the full 400gb so i know there is a 400gb partition and that it is formatted and contains a full install of xp..also with sp2.
after completing the format and windows install on my old computer and then moving the drive to the usb case and only seeing 32gb of unpartitioned space, i put the drive back into the old pc and it started up into xp and shows 400gb drive.
i'm wondering if there isn't a problem with my encloser...has anyone ever heard of such a strange issue?
