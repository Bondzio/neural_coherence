1.1.1	I have a 60GB Maxtor HDD with 2 partitions and ~6GB unallocated space.	St
1.1.2	One of the partition is running Windows XP Pro, while the other one is empty.	St
1.1.3	Then I have a 6GB Western Digital HDD with Windows 2000 Pro installed.	St
1.1.4	This HDD is running out of space - just under 1G left.	St
1.1.5	Now what should I do if I want that old 6GB HDD to be copied entirely without losing ANYthing, into the 2nd partition of the *new* 60GB HDD?	St
1.1.6	Is it possible?	St
1.1.7	Thanks!	St
1.2.1	But the OS will no longer function.	St
1.2.2	I decline to duplicate web content about why this is so but you need the Windows 2000 CD to have any hope of repairing the OS after such a move.	St
1.2.3	Good luck, Bob	St
1.3.1	Even though the new HDD is on the same computer?	St
1.3.2	Does it apply to Windows 2000 only or just ANY Windows versions?	St
1.3.3	And should the copying be cloning or imaging?	St
1.3.4	I'll be very glad if you can recommend me to a freeware or no-restriction shareware of doing that.	St
1.4.1	Copy, clone, image, etc.	St
1.4.2	All result in a non-operational OS but at least you didn't lose any files.	St
1.4.3	Some may demand that the OS work after such but I decline to duplicate all the web pages why Windows fails after such a move.	St
1.4.4	For your research type CHANGE MOTHERBOARD SAVE WINDOWS at google.com Bob	St
