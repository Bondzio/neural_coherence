1.1.2	Opinions?	St
1.1.3	Total cost so far is a little under 1100 dollars with tax.	St
1.2.1	Why the cooler?	St
1.3.1	You could save some $$ and go for a GTX 570 instead?	St
1.3.2	Similar to the build here for $1000	St
1.4.1	I agree Proffitt.	St
1.4.2	That machine will not be putting out enough heat to warrant a water cooler.	St
1.4.3	Unless you plan on over clocking both the cpu and the gpu, you won't need it.	St
1.4.4	That having been said if you do plan on over clocking, keep it, but make sure you have fittings for both gpu/cpu.	St
1.4.5	Also make sure you use the same hose diameter for the whole system.	Sug
1.4.6	No step downs or step ups.	St
1.4.7	It won't flow properly if you do, and you will burn out those components.	St
