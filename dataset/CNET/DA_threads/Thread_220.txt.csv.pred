1.8.1	Computer , I always ( Hope this has a floppy drive ) disconnect the Sata booting 'C ' drive , connect the new HD to an ide channel , cable select , boot the computer with the Manufacturers floppy ( maybe CD like some of them come with nowadays . )	St
1.8.2	Use the create option , format , check disk , make active ( or not- that 's a whole other set of questions to be debated ) , then shut down , reconnect the Sata booting drive , during boot press whatever key to get to setup menu ( Del , or F2 , or F1 , whatever ) verify the first hard drive in boot sequence is the sata drive , let the computer boot , most likely the drive will appear as & quot ; E & quot ; ( If all you have is the Sata C drive , an optical drive , and your new one .	St
1.8.3	If it 's still not showing , go to diak management and look for it , assign it a letter , change the path , whatever .	St
1.8.4	Inside XP booted you can then be sure the formatted file system is what you wanted ( NTFS or Fat32 ) .	St
1.8.5	bingo , you should be there .	St
