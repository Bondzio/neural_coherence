Does it still work?
Yes.
Sorry, i left it still on this AM defragging.
It has come back on each time I tried.
So it is working as far as I left it two hrs ago.
I am extremely inexperienced.
I had installed RAM before but I guess you can't win them all.
So istalling a new MB would be a bad idea for me, yes?
Well, if I continue to use it until I can get someone to look at it am I causing furthur damage.
Should I just leave it off?
