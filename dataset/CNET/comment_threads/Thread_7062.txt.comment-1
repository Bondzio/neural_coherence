Hey everyone.
I've run into a bit of a problem.
Couple weeks back, my computer's ram started having issues.
Ran memtest on it; one of the modules was broke, not sure which, and corsair wanted both modules back for an RMA so it didn't really matter.
Anyway, got my replacements today; the exact same module I was using before, only new and not broken, installed them, but now I've got a 'Cannot find signal' on my monitor.
Any ideas what happened?
I should also note that it worked fine for nearly nine months before the RAM went bad and now I'm here.
