<s> I got an Acer 22&quot; Widescreen Monitor on black friday because it was a screamin deal. </s>
<s> I didn't know that my video card would not support its 1680 x 1050 native resolution and that all my stuff would look wonky. </s>
<s> (I sold the 15&quot; standard LCD I was using) I don't use it for games at all, just surfing the web, digital pictures, and home video editing. </s>
<s> I have been doing ALOT of research on new cards and keep comming across one issue or another so I'm hopeing someone here can help me out. </s>
<s> Here is my system: Compaq Presario 3000 AMD Ath 2.16Ghz Windows XP 512 mem 160 G HD Model # SR1030NX I thought I found a good deal on a card but then HP Chat support told me that I need an AGP card. </s>
<s> Some of the cards I'm considering have an analog max res of 2048 x 1536 x 32bit x 85 Hz and their digital max res is only 1600 x 1200 so I couldn't use the dvi connection. </s>
<s> None of them have a widescreen standard res so I would have to use Powerstrip to customize the res. </s>
<s> (doesn't work with my current card.) </s>
<s> Here are the cards I am considering and the end cost to me: EVGA GeForce FX5200 128MB AGP $25 EVGA GeForce 6200 256MB 64-bit DDR AGP $29.99 EVGA GeForce 7300GT 512MB 128-bit DDR2 AGP $66 (this one has a max digitial res of 2560 x 1600 but is a bit more pricey) Cards built with widescreen resolutions are out of my price range. </s>
<s> My questions are, will these cards work with my computer, will they speed up or slow down my system, is there another option I haven't thought of yet, will the max digital make a $40 difference, and any other advise would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Let me know if any other specs on my system are needed, I haven't added anything to this computer (other than a new power supply) </s>

<s> on an AGP 8X using an nvidia quadro 4 980 128MB with dual DVI out. </s>
<s> I've had no issues with widescreen and higher resolutions. </s>
<s> They are easy to find on E-Bay and are under $50 (Used pulls from workstations). </s>
<s> Originally they ran around $300 and are near the top of the line AGP cards for non gaming needs. </s>
<s> Note you can buy a DVI to RGB adapters to support RGB monitors. </s>
<s> Haven't tried the other cards you mentioned. </s>
<s> Did you install the monitor's driver? </s>
<s> I'm running into this issue a lot and fixing them by installing that. </s>
<s> Some think the video card should show or list that resolution before this driver is installed? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I contacted both manufatorers, of the monitor and the card, and they both said contact the other we can't do anything for you. </s>
<s> Acer doesn't have a driver to download saying it's &quot;plug and play&quot; while I allready have the newest version for my card (which is a few years old anyway) and no dice. </s>
<s> Not really looking for a solution to my current set up because I have pretty much exhausted that avenue speaking with reps from Acer, HP, and the maker of my card (don't remember atm), with the only answer being, get a new card. </s>
<s> I just want to be sure I get one that will satisfy my needs while not screwing up my pc and breaking the bank. </s>
<s> it will handle the widescreen without issue. </s>
<s> and it will probably be faster than the video card you've got now (whose make/model you didn't mention). </s>
<s> Some write &quot;Once I manually updated my monitor.inf file,&quot; it worked. </s>
<s> Sadly the dummies manning the support lines may be instructed to never work with you on that. </s>
<s> I can't find it since I can't find the Acer model number in your post. </s>

<s> Get the nvidia 6200 as suggested. </s>

<s> I remember the via now and that's definately it. </s>
<s> I read the other post too and am wondering if this is an &quot;onboard&quot; and what exactly that means. </s>
<s> I was assuming I would be replacing one card with another, is that not the case? </s>
<s> Sounds like the 6200 is going to be the way to go. </s>
<s> I have a how to site here: http://www.playtool.com/pages/installvid/install.html It tells me i need to also update my mother board chipset: http://www.playtool.com/pages/chipsetdrivers/chipset.html Now that I'm inching closer to getting a new card I want to be sure I do it right. </s>
<s> Backup your hard disk before you do anything else. </s>
<s> Judging by your response, you may need recovery if your system crashes. </s>
<s> Insert your new card into the AGP slot, plug your monitor to it and your PC should automatically detect it first time you power up. </s>
<s> Windows may ask you to install card drivers, in which case, use the CD accompanying the card. </s>
<s> I doubt you'll have to install new chipset drivers. </s>
<s> Take your time and do it right the first time. </s>
<s> The 6200 is otw. </s>
<s> Here are the last few questions I have: When I change it am I going to be taking out the old one or does &quot;on board&quot; mean it stays in? </s>
<s> If so do I need to do anything to dissable it? </s>
<s> Sense this one has 256 mem built in do i need to do anything to free up the mem the old one was using? </s>
<s> If I'm not swapping it out will it be obvious where to put the new one after I open the pc? </s>
<s> I'll create a system restore before I do it but I hope I won't need it. </s>
<s> Thanks for all the info! </s>
<s> the board in the HP link above. </s>
<s> See the VGA connector at back? </s>
<s> Isn't that what you are using currently? </s>
<s> There's no VGA card in your PC. </s>
<s> That's what &quot;integrated&quot; means. </s>
<s> See the AGP slot? </s>
<s> Put the 6200 in the slot. </s>
<s> Somewhere in your BIOS may allow you to choose PCI or AGP video first. </s>
<s> Default is normally PCI and usually you don't have to mess with it. </s>
<s> If you get no video out when you power on with the card in, connect the monitor back to the mobo VGA and switch the BIOS to AGP first. </s>
<s> I see now how its integrated but there are 3 pci slots on the board (i thought it was not pci compatible which is why the AGP card) and I don't see a slot for the AGP? </s>
<s> So I'm just a bit confused when you say I may have to choose between PCI and AGP in the BIOS. </s>
<s> It was hiding, lol. </s>
<s> But I'm still wondering about the PCI slots... </s>
<s> Is your mobo physically different from the picture in the link? </s>
<s> ie. </s>
<s> no AGP connector on mobo? </s>
<s> Check right now and if you find no AGP connector, cancel the 6200 order! </s>
<s> I just missed seeing it on the pic is all, I found it but the PCI slots are what I don't get now. </s>
<s> Why would my pc not be compatible with a pci card if it has 3 slots for them? </s>
<s> I could have gotten a better card for less money... </s>
