Note: If you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem. Also please exercise your best judgment when posting in the forums--revealing personal information such as your e-mail address, telephone number, and address is not recommended. By telling a bit more like above you save a few turns.

Your machine is reviewed at http://reviews.cnet.com/desktops/hp-compaq-presario-sr1610nx/4505-3118_7-31589100.html The AMDs use a different numbering system that confuses most of us. That 3200+ was supposed to tell you that your CPU performed &quot;like&quot; a similar Intel CPU at 3.2 GHz. So far I don't see you presenting a problem and am guessing this is the usual confounder.
