<s> I need to get an external hard drive (my 3rd). </s>
<s> The first 2 were from OWC, and incorporated a Hitachi drive mechanism. </s>
<s> But now I see that OWC has switched to using Seagage Barracuda (probably for price reasons). </s>
<s> The Hitachi is truly high-end, and super-reliable. </s>
<s> But what about Seagate Barracuda? </s>
<s> Opinions? </s>
<s> Bytecc case and Maxtor drive. </s>
<s> This way I can pick and choose. </s>
<s> I recommend the Western Digital Caviar SE16 hard drive. </s>
<s> It is 7200RPM and has 16MB cache. </s>
<s> I recommend the Addonic AE5SACSUF enclosure. </s>
<s> It supports SATA I, SATA II, and IDE. </s>
<s> This enclosure connects to your computer either by firewire or USB 2.0. </s>
<s> This enclosure is very sturdy and the aluminum material is thick. </s>
<s> It also uses the Cypress chipset for USB. </s>
<s> Cypress are supposed to be good chipsets. </s>
<s> However, that fan is loud. </s>
<s> If you don't want to make your own, Western Digital has the My Book external hard drive. </s>
<s> Thanks, I appreciate the advice. </s>
