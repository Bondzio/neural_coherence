You will spend a lot more time staring into your monitor than into your PC case (unless you have a real problem with it).
You don't want a poor quality monitor regardless of how long it lasts.
If you can, take the time to look at a few in person.
Read some reviews as well.
Also keep in mind that an LCD image is only optimal when running in its &quot;native&quot; resolution.
I've had good luck with Viewsonic, Sony, NEC and a couple more.
I have not been so fortunate with CTX, Sharp, and a couple others but your experience might differ.
