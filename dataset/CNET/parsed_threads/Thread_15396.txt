<s> I need help choosing a processor for a new Dell computer I will be purchasing. </s>
<s> I have no idea which processor would be better either the P4 Processor 541 with 3.2ghz or the P4 630 with 3.0ghz or should i go with the more expensive Pentium D Processor 820 with Dual Core Technology (2.8GHz, 800FSB). </s>
<s> With any of these choices I will have 1gb ram and a 256mb pci(e) card. </s>
<s> Basically all I want to do is play Battlefield 2 and burn cd's. </s>
<s> thanks for the help. </s>

<s> NIL </s>
<s> While the Pentium D is dual-core, it only runs at 2.8GHZ. </s>
<s> THe P4 runs at 3.2GHZ. </s>
<s> Since they're both Prescotts, the P4 will be faster now. </s>
<s> In the future, games will be more than likely made for 2 cores, so the Pentium D will be faster. </s>
<s> Go with the Pent.D However, if you game, go with an Athlon 64, which will slaughter both chips. </s>
<s> AMD is making a budget X2 in the future($300-ish) and is quire faster than the Pentium D. </s>
