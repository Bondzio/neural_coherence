with all the trouble your having it might be easer to cut back to just the basics.
one hd only as master drive on the the primary ide channel.
no other drives a cd drive only as master on the secondary channel.
no other drives.
and boot from the xp cd.
have the install program delete all paritions, then create a parition, format and then install xp.
if the install goes ok, and reboots after you get to the normial desktop, then insatall the mb drivers.
if all goes well then shut down-power off an hook up your other drives.
