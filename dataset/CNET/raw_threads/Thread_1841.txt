Does anyone know how I can tell which motherboards will work for this? I can even do the research myself if someone knows a good resource to use. Thanks, Ryan

You may be looking at a new case/power-supply as well. Bob

They also had a listing of suggested motherboards to use with this chip. Probably have similar lists at other chip manufactures web sites.
