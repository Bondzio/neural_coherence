1.1.1	someone told me that you cannot put a SATA and an IDE HDD in the same computer even if they have available slots.	St
1.1.2	is it true?	St
1.1.3	these are the slots on my motherboard: Eight USB 2.0 ports One serial port One parallel port Four Serial ATA interfaces One parallel ATA IDE interface with UDMA 33, ATA-66/100 support One diskette drive interface PS/2 keyboard and mouse ports I already have one 40GB IDE HDD and one DVD-rom.	St
1.1.4	can i still add a SATA HDD and another DVD+/-R/RW without throwing away the exhisting ones?	St
1.1.5	thanks	Polite
1.2.1	Every thing is set up in Bios.	St
1.2.2	Both IDE & Raid & Sata all set up in Bios.	St
1.2.3	I have IDE, Sata, and Raid in my computer all set up inside Bios.	St
1.2.4	See your motherboard Manuel, or go to the motherboard web site.	St
1.2.5	Good Luck Wendell H	St

1.4.1	if you have the SATA-drivers installed, there is no problem at all.	St
1.4.2	most newer OS-es will then recognise your drives.	St
1.4.3	I have IDE 1 - 4 for 2 HD- en 2 DVD-drives en SATA 1 -2 for another 2 HD- drives.	St
1.4.4	what I'm using it for: I'm still waiting for KNOPPIX 5.0.1 (genuine installation to hard disk will now possible for the very first time) and Kubuntu to be ready.	St
1.4.5	if it takes to long, I'll start wit Suse 10.1 anyway.	St
1.4.6	once complete, I'll be able to boot from floppy and CD/DVD to whatever, from PATA to linux (my trio) and from SATA to W-xp PRO just by changing the boot-order in the BIOS.	St
1.4.7	how's that for multi-boot??	St
1.4.8	succes, ben	St
