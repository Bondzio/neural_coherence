I found that VIA chipsets were prone to the problem, however Intel too seemed to be affected but not as much if left at deafult levels.
I too read on mtrbd.
support websites info on this problem, usually the last paragraph or so or asterisk as you mention, what to look for.
Further, if any forum is provided, the high volume Q&A on any one topic.
This sure isn't &quot;ferrite core&quot; memory anymore.
One modern PC ram module is equal to or far surpassed any old system memory drawer/compartment.
