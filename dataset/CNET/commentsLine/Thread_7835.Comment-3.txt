thanks for your suggestion, michael!
i hope you won't mind a couple of follow-ups: do i also need a router with this?
if so, what router would you recommend i purchase?
the site you referenced states it works with windows 98se...does it work with the regular windows 98 as well?
my wife has a compaq &quot;internet computer&quot; from 1999, which works fine, and has 2 usb ports, and runs windows 98.
