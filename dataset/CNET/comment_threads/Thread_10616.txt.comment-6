Your machine is reviewed at http://reviews.cnet.com/desktops/hp-compaq-presario-sr1610nx/4505-3118_7-31589100.html The AMDs use a different numbering system that confuses most of us.
That 3200+ was supposed to tell you that your CPU performed &quot;like&quot; a similar Intel CPU at 3.2 GHz.
So far I don't see you presenting a problem and am guessing this is the usual confounder.
