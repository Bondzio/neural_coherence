the router model is: smc barricade-g 54 mbps wireless broadband router.
my problem is that the network setup walkthru in windows xp does not work for me.
i managed to finish it once, but it seemed to have no connection, no link, with reality.
(in control panel it is obviously possible to set up devices which don't exist, i.e.
printers.
i think this nonexistence thing is happening to me when i do network setup.)
whoever can help, please do.
thanks.
