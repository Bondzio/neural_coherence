the file to run from a floppy to run diagnostic tests of the drive.
that should tell you where you stand.
is the drive still under warranty??
a few years ago the warranty was 3 years, then most changed to 1 year.
if you you have no receipt to prove when you bought the drive, they will go by the date of manufacture that is on the nameplate.
you really do not have to prove ownership.
good luck.
