1.1.1	Long story short, as my Dell XPS desktop was loading up on Friday night, I foolishly went to plug my camera into the USB before it was finished and I believe that it what may have hung the process.	St
1.1.2	In any event, my computer had frozen so I rebooted and I have been unable to load up Windows since.	St
1.1.3	When I try to boot, I get the following blue screen message (among lots of other, less important text): &quot;A problem has been detected and Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer.	St
1.1.4	DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL Technical Information: STOP: 0x000000D1 (0x00000034, 0x00000002, 0x00000000, 0xF72D8019) iastor.sys - Address F72D8019 base at F72C5000, DateStamp 42b2df42&quot; How can I resussitate my system?	St
1.1.5	I have people telling me to cut my losses and buy a new laptop, and others who say this is fixable and why spend the money when you don't have to.	St
1.1.6	Geek Squad wanted $400 just to do a diagnostic check and back up my desired data ...	St
1.1.7	I told them I wasn't interested in spending that kind of money.	St
1.1.8	Any suggestions?	St
1.1.9	-Jason	St
1.2.1	If so choose &quot;Last known good configuration&quot;.	St
1.2.2	Reboot.	St
1.2.3	If not, do you have the XP CD or the Restoral CD?	St
1.2.4	If so boot from the XP CD and do a repair install.	St
1.3.1	It seems Dell had this happen before.	St
1.3.2	I provide a link to a possible fix.	St
1.3.3	But, you can a &quot;repair OS&quot; using your OS recovery/restore or install CD.	St
1.3.4	You didn't mention what OS you have, but during a reboot having the OS disc in the drive and its the 1st device to boot from(check bios) it should try to boot from CD.	St
1.3.5	Select the &quot;repair&quot; option.	St
1.3.6	link: http://www.unexplained-mysteries.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=90770 You probably had a static(ESD) damage or too much data media to be mounted when you inserted the USB device.	St
1.3.7	There is the possibility the mtrbd.	St
1.3.8	is damaged, but try the fixes.	St
1.3.9	Also, google for other clues on the topic.	St
1.3.10	It seems to be an Intel storage driver in reference to I/O interface.	St
1.3.11	Please provide full details of your system for a more precise answer(s).	St
1.3.12	tada -----Willy	St
1.4.1	http://www.ydeologi.com/2006/04/26/dell-dimension-e510-iastorsys-windows-xp-blue-screen-error-stop-code-0x000000d1/ The above link is a response to the many users having this same issue.	St
1.4.2	There are many fixes or tips/hints/clues on the topic.	St
1.4.3	good luck -----Willy	Polite
1.5.1	Thanks, the link is informative, but does not help me with my problem.	St
1.5.2	FYI, I did try loading up the computer with the OS reinstallation CD in the disc drive and it did nothing, didn't even seem to detect it was in there.	St
1.5.3	Got the same blue screen, and subsequent black screen (with options to boot into Safe Mode or Use Last Good Configuration) that I had before, and again, none of those work.	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	The reason I provided the 2nd link is the response many got with some of the fixes.	St
1.7.2	Dell own driver(original) fails and Intel own provided or the updated Dell driver will correct the problem.	St
1.7.3	Now how you get at since a simple running system in order to run the install is another matter, that's why the &quot;repair&quot; option is the most likely to succeed.	St
1.7.4	You do have to point to the new updated driver in order to install it.	St
1.7.5	They did provide the instructions on all this and they have to be followed.	St
1.7.6	So, you will need to retry all this again until it works.	St
1.7.7	You may try to get the plain DOS level screen(black screen) with &gt;C prompt and then install the Dell updated driver file.	St
1.7.8	Now, if you have important data you want to save, then remove HD and mount in ext.	St
1.7.9	USB cases or adapter to retrieve -OR- place in another system as 2nd HD to recover such data.	St
1.7.10	-OR- boot from a live Linux CD and hope you can and then retrieve data from the mounted HD0.	St
1.7.11	From memory: I think I've resolved this problem before.	St
1.7.12	I believe I removed HD, placed in another system.	St
1.7.13	Booted that system and made sure the 2nd HD is acknowledged.	St
1.7.14	I inserted the new driver in a directory(remember it) and when done, shutdown system.	St
1.7.15	Returned HD to old system, booted up into DOS level, retrieved the file and installed it.	St
1.7.16	Shutdown system(complete shutdown not a restart) and then rebooted and it was OK.	St
1.7.17	If all the info and this stuff doesn't help, then you may have a true h/w fault and no amount of drivers or s/w will correct that.	St
1.7.18	Since is a i/f type of thing build-in the mtrbd.	St
1.7.19	yeah a replacement is required or new system depending on your course of action or size of your wallet.	St
1.7.20	tada -----Willy	St
1.8.1	The OS is shot.	St
1.9.1	Friend came over to check it out for me (for free, screw Geek Squad!)	St
1.9.2	and a message basically came up saying the drive is bad.	St
1.9.3	I have a Dell DataSafe deal where I have a backup drive in there, so he swapped that one in as the main drive and took the other one out.	St
1.9.4	It now appears to be working, albeit a bit glitchy at times (screen will randomly flicker) and the drive doesn't have the same capacity as my other one, but at least it works for now!	St
1.10.1	SO what happened next?	St
1.10.2	What did you do with the &quot;defective&quot; drive?	Ques
1.10.3	I saw your previous post about the safe mode option, did you try entering the safe mode?	St
1.10.4	Your system could have some trouble when you plug an external device while your desktop is loading, but it should not be that &quot;fatal&quot;.	Sug
1.10.5	PCs have external protections too e.g.	St
1.10.6	grounding etc.	St
1.10.7	Although it is possible that your Hard drive may have incurred a &quot;bad sector&quot; because of the external glitch.	St
1.10.8	If this is the case you need to reformat that drive but recover first your valuable data.	St
1.10.9	If your main drive is not in partition, I suggest you partition it, so that in the future formatting won't be a BIG problem.	St
1.10.10	Hope this helps.	St
