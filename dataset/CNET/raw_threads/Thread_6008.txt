If you go to the usual staples/officemaxdepot/samsclub/costco and get a laser printer and a spare cartridge you would be done for about 2 years. I fear some over analyze these lower use cases and I'm no help. I know it's OK to get a 2 year printer versus a 5 year printer and pocket the savings. Bob

We have no idea other than you're looking for a deal. it's no deal if the need requires a parameter you finally needed, like for labels, color, legal size, duplex, paper trays and wifi, etc.. You get the idea of what your real needs are, otherwise just shop for what feels good, we have no clue. You cam always look online from the manufacturer to see what they offer and then on to some vendor(s) to a deal or wait for one. tada ------Willy
