if you've opened a few power supplies, you may have seen some with darkened areas on the mounting boards.
this is when the resins turn to carbon.
carbon is a conductor of electrical current.
thus, it can act as another component in the circuit and change how things regulate.
eventually the change to carbon cascades and causes total failure but any visible heat damage of this type to the boards is a warning of things to come.
