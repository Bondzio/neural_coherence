thank very much i got it.
i also uninstalled the software for my maxtor one touch 4 750 i do not need all that extra features i just need a external drive.
it took me 4 hours to transfer my downloaded movies from one my first external to the new external.
and i saw and extra set off movies and i deleted them and then i did not see the first set.
i have to start all over again.
