I've never had such problems with a removable hard disk in Windows.
It can't be a hard drive problem, I'd say, so it's an OS issue.
A possible work around.
Partition the Lacie in, say, three partitions, each 200 MB, one for each project.
Then you can format that partition only at the end of the project.
