i recently acquired a visioneer 8700 scanner.
it was puchased in 2003 but not used in recent months.
i installed the software in my computer which has os windows xp with sp3 and latest updates.
i have scanned over 20 different documents using paperport and the driver that came with the installation cd and have had no problems.
it works perfectly.
