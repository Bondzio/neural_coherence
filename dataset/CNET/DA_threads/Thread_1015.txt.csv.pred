1.1.1	Hi guys , I have a Fujitsu-Siemens P4 3.2Ghz , 512mb ram , 160gig HDD , and a high speed DVD + Rewriteble cd rom .	St
1.1.2	The problem I have is that whenever I want to read a cd or intstall new software off a cd , it freezes the computer and I have to reboot the computer .	St
1.1.3	It does finally read the cd after 3 or 4 reboots .	St
1.1.4	One of the problems with the Fijitsu-Siemens is there is no reboot button , so you have to switch the computer off at the back and then on again .	St
1.1.5	First question is , is this not bad for the computer .	St
1.1.6	Second question is , is there a speed setting for the CD rom , because is the CD rom reading the cd at the wrong speed and so causing it to freeze .	St
1.1.7	I hope someone has heard of this problem and can help me .	St
1.1.8	I 'm a novice with computers so be gentle .	St
1.1.9	ha ha ha !	St
1.2.1	This sounds like an OS or driver issue .	St
1.2.2	In fact , that 's a very new machine and you should be able to pester the supplier/support to fix it for you .	St
1.2.3	ALL the Fujitsi based systems do have a reset but may not wire it up .	St
1.2.4	Later you can research this and inspect the motherboard to find the reset and add that button .	St

1.3.1	& quot ; you have to switch the computer off at the back and then on again. & quot ; Or you hold the power button on the front from 4 to 11 secconds ... Why this is n't in the user manual with the machine is a mystery .	St
