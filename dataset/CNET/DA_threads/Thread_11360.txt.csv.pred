1.1.1	I 'm putting together my first pc pretty soon , and am trying to figure out which type of processor to go for .	St
1.1.2	I 'm not looking for top of the line gaming monster , but I am trying to build a solid machine that will keep me playing new games ( Fallout 3 , Prince of Persia , Left 4 Dead , etc ) for a couple years .	St
1.1.3	So I 'm trying to decide , should I go with a tried and true dual core processor such as the Intel core 2 duo 3.16 ( http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16819115036 ) or perhaps one of the newer quad cores with a lower clock speed ?	Ques
1.1.4	I 'm a little hesitant since recommended gaming specs are already hitting 2.6ghz , which will be my starting speed if not less if I go with a quad core .	St
1.1.5	But will the extra cores make the difference ?	Ques
1.1.6	Also , I 'm going with Intel on this one just because it 's familiar and I 'd prefer to stay on fairly stable ground for my first build .	St
1.1.7	Just saying .	St
1.1.8	Advice appreciated .	Polite
1.1.9	If anyone has any more comments on my box as a whole ( also debating graphics card ) you 're more than welcome to check over the tentative parts list : http : //secure.newegg.com/WishList/PublicWishDetail.aspx ? WishListNumber=9427232 .	Ques
1.2.1	But the area that gamer machines need the most work is the video card .	St
1.2.2	Without reservation I 'd get any 2+GHz Core 2 Duo or higher , 2 or 4GB RAM and then pour the rest of the bugdet to get the best video card for the money from this list - & gt ; http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card,2064.html Having more cores does help , but that is not where you find your gaming machine to need the most help .

1.3.1	Hi Aegis , I would go for quad core as it may be happen that the future game would not be compatible for dual core but compatible for quad core .	St
1.4.1	Gaming will eventually move to multicore optimization .	St
1.4.2	As of now we are going to witness a shift from the LGA 775 platform to the LGA 1366 platform from Intel .	St
1.4.3	So for a system that is futureproof for 2-3 years a quad core will be good but too expensive ( the QX series 9650 & 9770 are very fast but still do not justify their prices which are around $ 700-1000 ) .	St
1.4.4	A fast Core2Duo is a good option for about a year or 2 .	St
1.4.5	The RAM should be 4GB then gaming under Vista will not be an issue .	St
1.4.6	Similarly the Graphics card is equally important , your choice of the GTX 260 is good .	St
1.4.7	If you 're thinking of SLI I 'd suggest you go for a higher PSU say 800W .	St
1.4.8	DDR3 system memory is still too costly to be an option	St
1.5.1	Thanks , that 's pretty much the lines upon which I 'm thinking now .	St
1.5.2	I 'm going to pick up an e8500 , which should last me a while , especially if I decide to overclock .	St
1.5.3	In a year or two when quad cores are cheaper and have higher clock speed , I 'll switch over to one of those .	St
1.5.4	As far as i7 / non LGA775 goes , well , that 'll have to wait until my next build .	St
1.5.5	Especially since I 'm definitely not messing with that DDR3 ram yet .	St
