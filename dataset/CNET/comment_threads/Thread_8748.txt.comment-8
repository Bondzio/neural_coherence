first dont pay extra for OCing it can be done no prob it is jsut moving a slider.
i would go for 5600 if u like openGL games (doom 3) or the 9600 if u like Directx games (far cry, half life) im not sure about if u should get the XT version of the ati.
just dont buy a ati SE card or an nvidia XT card.
also maybe look at the 6600 i belive that card is 150$ (newegg i think i saw it at).
