<s> I just bought a new Epson Stylus Photo R1800 and am trying to get it to run on my new PC with Vista. </s>
<s> I have downloaded the newest Vista (32) drivers from Epson and all appears to have been installed correctly. </s>
<s> I have checked the system properties and it appears the USB is installed correctly as well (you can run this with a fire-wire, but I don't have a port on this machine). </s>
<s> I can print a test page from the printer only (unplugged from the computer), but there is no communication with the printer and the computer when they are connected with the USB cable. </s>
<s> I've made 3 calls to Epson with no help. </s>
<s> They just say that the R1800 &quot;should work with Vista.&quot; Sigh... </s>
<s> I have done a system restore on my machine 3 times to remove the drivers. </s>
<s> You can't simply uninstall them, the system crashes (!!). </s>
<s> I tried the printer out on my laptop with XP and it appears to run fine. </s>
<s> Any thoughts, help, advice would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> I have spent about 10 hours on this and am starting to lose my mind. </s>
<s> And I haven't even tried to install my new Epson V700 scanner yet! </s>
<s> Thanks, Kalli </s>
<s> I run into this issue with owner install OS's. </s>
<s> They forget motherboard drivers and more. </s>
<s> If you have some ready to use Dell or such then my thought is to pack up the printer and return it as DOA. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> check that your printer is set to use the usb port. </s>
<s> Epson drivers under Vista are crap at detecting the correct port, they tend to default to lpt ports. </s>
<s> Go to control panel/printers right click on your Epson printer icon select properties, then ports select usb. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> Thanks for the replies Bob and anmor. </s>
<s> I checked to verify that the printer was connected via a USB port again and came up with the same error I was getting yesterday: &quot;An error occurred during port configuration. </s>
<s> Access is denied.&quot; BTW, this port is listed as a virtual port, the same as my other printer. </s>
<s> I told Epson about this error but they had no clue about it. </s>
<s> Is that error familiar to anyone? </s>
<s> Thanks again for taking the time to reply. </s>
<s> Cheers - Kalli </s>
<s> However I may have been too vague as to a comment I made. </s>
<s> So I'll be more blunt. </s>
<s> Who installed this OS? </s>
<s> And are you logged in as Administrator? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hi Bob - I just bought this system from Dell (XPS 410) in June. </s>
<s> I believe I am logged in as the Admin. </s>
<s> I am the only one who uses the computer and I have to log in when it starts up. </s>
<s> I tried checking under Administrative Tools via the Start Menu, but it didn't give me any info. </s>
<s> about the Administrator (which could be totally user error on my part, I am not familiar with Admin.). </s>
<s> Sorry I missed telling you all that before Cheers - Kalli </s>
<s> Turn off UAC. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> kallimo, I owned an Espson Stylus CX-5400 for my Windows computer and CX-6600 for my Mac. </s>
<s> The CX-5400's printer head died.....according to all the complaints on the internet, this model was &quot;defective&quot;. </s>
<s> I returned it to Epson and it was replaced by a Stylus CX-6000 which is still (cross fingers) working but now the CX-6600 just died. </s>
<s> I don't know if this is due to the &quot;Durabrite&quot; ink or not. </s>
<s> But, with Epson, a new ink cartridge just contains ink. </s>
<s> With HP, for example, a new cartridge also includes new print heads. </s>
<s> If I didn't also own a Canon printer, also, I would be out of luck. </s>
<s> Hi Bob - I went in and unchecked the UAC and rebooted. </s>
<s> It didn't seem to make a difference. </s>
<s> When clicking Configuration the printer's USB port I now get an error message that says: &quot;An error occurred during port configuration. </s>
<s> This operation is not supported.&quot; Was there anything else you thought to do after disabling the UAC? </s>
<s> Thanks again for your time. </s>
<s> Kalli </s>
<s> With UAC you got &quot;Access is denied.&quot; and now a new message. </s>
<s> UAC was obviously screwing with it. </s>
<s> OK, next up? </s>
<s> Uninstall it all and reinstall but without UAC on. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hi Bob - Again, thanks for walking me through this. </s>
<s> I am not familiar with peripheral/port/driver issues. </s>
<s> I tried reinstalling the drivers with the UAC off, but the printer does not work and I get the same error message (Operation is not supported). </s>
<s> I have a feeling this printer may be a very expensive dud. </s>
<s> I'll ship it back to Amazon tomorrow. </s>
<s> Thanks again for your help. </s>
<s> Kalli </s>
<s> Just like you read at http://forums1.itrc.hp.com/service/forums/bizsupport/questionanswer.do?threadId=1136794&admit=-682735245+1183313667308+28353475 this is not an Epson only issue. </s>
<s> Why would I need to configure the USB port? </s>
<s> That shouldn't need to be done here. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hi Bob- I do not have a wireless system, I am plugged in at the wall. </s>
<s> RE: why did I click to configure in the first place...I checked that a few days ago when on the phone with Epson. </s>
<s> It's the only thing that gives any type of feedback/message. </s>
<s> Otherwise, it's as if the printer wasn't there. </s>
<s> Nothing gets sent to the queue, etc. </s>
<s> Cheers - Kalli </s>
<s> I have the same problem with my HP Officejet 6213. </s>
<s> I've tried to set the printer to use the USB port, and it went well, but unfortunately it did not solve the problem. </s>
<s> As soon as I try to configure the USB port I get an error : An error occured during port configuration. </s>
<s> This operation is not supported. </s>
<s> With the other ports, I don't get this message. </s>
<s> I would guess this is USB, printer and Vista specific? </s>
<s> Dear Kalli and Bob. </s>
<s> I've followed your conversation. </s>
<s> This USB configuration problem with the printers and Vista, is not an Epson problem.I have exactly the same problem with a HP Officejet on my Vista Laptop. </s>
<s> This must be a Vista problem. </s>
<s> After all the research I've done, it looks more and more like a &quot;compatibility&quot; problem on Vista's side. </s>
<s> And the Vendors like HP, supply the correct driver versions for Vista, but there must be a configuration or setting somewhere in Vista that's causing the problem. </s>
<s> Although I managed to install my R1800 on Vista I cannot syncronise the colours visible on the screen with those printed - I tried to change gamma values etc, but still not satisfying. </s>
<s> Only when I got back to my good old XP it worked fine again. </s>
<s> I had other compatibility problems with Vista, for example my HP scanjet 5370C, HP can not be bothered to update driver for Vista and advises to buy a new scanner instead. </s>
<s> However, they provide &quot;good new&quot; for my Colour Laserjet 4550N but after downloading and installing the driver the images are all very bad quality. </s>
<s> Again, as soon as I installed it back on my XP computer it worked fine again. </s>
<s> Similar with Partition Magic 8, simply doesn't work. </s>
<s> Same with WinCleaner 10, not working on Vista. </s>
<s> All very disappointing and I feel totally ripped off. </s>
<s> I also purchased epson 1400 had it for 4months. </s>
<s> The 1st one stop feeding the paper. </s>
<s> They sent me another one. </s>
<s> Now i have a new one and this one wont print. </s>
<s> They sent me another and it still wont print. </s>
<s> Ive also tried installing from epson updated version and I get nothing I have tried to get tech support from epson by trying everything they know how. </s>
<s> I have been on the phone with epson 5 days a week 3 hours at a time still my printer wont print. </s>
<s> I know what you feeling. </s>
<s> Can anyone please help us, I'm losing it. </s>
<s> With some XP or other machine and have them try. </s>
