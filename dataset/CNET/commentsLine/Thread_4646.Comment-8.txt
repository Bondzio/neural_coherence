issues where the wireless adapter driver was installed incorrectly (bad file copy, munged registry entry, not necessarily anything you did wrong...) which were resolved by deleting the adapter in device manager with a reboot for xp to redetect it and reinstall the driver.
all of sudden it worked the way it should.
have you tried this system at another location and it worked there but not here?
and yes, continue your conversation with the network tech guys.
often if you show a sincere interest in learning yourself how this stuff works, they'll spend a little extra time and show you more about it rather than just clicking the right stuff they know about and giving it back to you with the &quot;here, idiot, it works now&quot; attitude.
