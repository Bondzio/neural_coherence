Hmmm...it would be very informative to see if this phenomenon were repeated while connected to a different computer, then you could confidently rule out your computer.
The good thing is that the Samsung monitors I have seen have a 3 year warranty.
I'd check into it.
A shot in the dark: 1.
Check monitor cable for kinks, frays, loose at jack or base of monitor.
2.
Check to see if there are any ATI card diagnostics in Catalyst or downloadable from mfg.
