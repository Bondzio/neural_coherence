1. this was a known issue with some older systems.
the cause was most commonly tracked down to a bios issue.
see if you can find if it has been updated.
2. another trick i use is to use 80 conductor cables and follow the jumper rules to the letter.
there are some that will try non-standard jumpering ideas but i leave them to experiment.
