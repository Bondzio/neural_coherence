a couple of weeks ago i bought a maxtor 80gb ext hard drive.within days of setting it up, the light went out.
i took it back to the shop and they gave me a replacement immediately, no questions asked.
on 5th oct i set up the 2nd maxtor 80gb, and by the night of the 8th oct i noticed that the light had gone out on it too.i returned it to the store on 10th oct and we tried to figure out what it was that i was doing wrong.
also, we found out that it was the power cord that had malfunctioned, and not the actual hard drive unit.
the only thing we could think of that maybe i should not have done was to leave the unit plugged into the power 24/7.
it never occurred to me to only turn it on when i wanted to use it.
i assumed it would be ok to leave it plugged into the power all the time.
there were no such instructions cautioning me on what i should or should not do.
i would like to hear from anyone else who has had the same problems or if they think that it is ok or not ok to leave an external hard drive plugged into the power all of the time.
