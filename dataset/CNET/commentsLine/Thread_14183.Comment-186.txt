i don't know if you would call this a personal computer or not but you could program with it and, with the help of visa calc, you could do business on it.
i think i enjoyed the basic programming the most but i used it practically as well.
my first ibm compatible was a compaq duel floppy, 5 1/4&quot; drives.
had 512k but i upgraded it to 640k, now i was really flying.
had to have the operating system on one floppy and the program on the other.
ahhh sweet monochrome days.
i remember that if you put a notch on the other side of the floppy, you could make a dual sided floppy.
seemed to only work on good quality disks.
i have now have more memory on usb flash drive than a whole stack of mfm full height drives that i later had for my pc.
who says size doesn't matter?
