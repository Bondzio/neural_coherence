<s> I have an old Gateway mini-tower, model # MFATXSTL ELP 500L-2, manufacture date 12/22/2011. </s>
<s> Was running two days ago, when it suddenly shut down ten minutes after startup, power-on yielded yellow power button light (steady yellow), no beep codes, no monitor display. </s>
<s> Did the usual, reseated the memory cards, video card, rechecked molex connections and reseated. </s>
<s> Noticed when computer should have been running POST, floppy drive light did not come on. </s>
<s> CD-ROM drive lights both flashed. </s>
<s> fans for PSU and CPU ran, green light on motherboard. </s>
<s> Removed power lead to floppy drive, and system completed POST, reset BIOS to current date and time (put in a new CMOS battery just prior) and was able to boot to Ubuntu Linux 10.0.04 LTS. </s>
<s> System specs: P4 1.5 gHz, 512 GB RAM, AGP 4x nvidia MX 200 card, integrated sound, integrated network card. </s>
<s> Use a PS2 mouse and USB keyboard. </s>
<s> Was running this system and detailing steps to troubleshoot here when system froze completely. </s>
<s> Forced shutdown gave green power button but did not complete POST as no video came up. </s>
<s> Now using another system to complete and finish this post. </s>
<s> Digital voltmeter with all power leads to peripheral drives disconnected showed 11.758 volts to mains, and 3.784 volts to floppy drive. </s>
<s> Is this right? </s>
<s> I did not check the main power to the motherboard. </s>
<s> I'm thinking the PSU is degraded, and will no longer supply enough current and wattage to run the system continuously anymore. </s>
<s> System ran for about 40 minutes today before it locked up. </s>
<s> System was running two IDE HDD, two CD-ROM. </s>
<s> Second HDD is used to backup data on the primary drive. </s>
<s> Also noticed when forced shutdown is made, system does not shut down immediately when it should be running POST as it usually does only two or three seconds in. </s>
<s> It acts as if the OS is loaded when it cannot be after such a short time. </s>
<s> Appreciate any help </s>
<s> Manufacture date is 12/22/2001. </s>
<s> Sorry 'bout that. </s>
<s> All &quot;drives&quot; such as floppy, HDD, and optical usually have +12V and +5V and 3.784 is well outside a generous 10% tolerance. </s>
<s> At 10 years old, we are well past the usual 5 year design life so consider some new PSU but only after inspecting all boards for BAD CAPS. </s>
<s> BAD CAPS on google.com gives you the story, pictures and what to look for. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It seems when you unplugged the FD, it basically had enough power to boot-up. </s>
<s> At 2001 build date, its seen better days. </s>
<s> While you have the voltmeter, check everything. </s>
<s> Overall, simply swap out the PSU for better one if you want to keep the PC going. </s>
<s> I would seriously think of a new PC or newer one(used, too) as 2001 build, there's bound to be other issues as time progresses. </s>
<s> For now, unless you have a need for FD drive, then live w/o it unitl repairs are done or leave it out entirely later. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Mr. Proffitt and Willy, Wasn't aware of the 10% tolerance rule. </s>
<s> Thank you for that. </s>
<s> I have a PSU exact size and form factor (unusual for it's day, as some/most were proprietary) rated to run a P4 1.5, albeit a different mb, lying around the house from a tossed neighbor's system. </s>
<s> That system had bad sectors on the primary HDD, hence the NTLoader error. </s>
<s> Was running Win2000. </s>
<s> There is a 'test' button on the defective PSU. </s>
<s> What does it test??? </s>
<s> I assume one would push it in/hold it down to test. </s>
<s> Just out of curiosity, are POST cards available at retail shops? </s>
<s> No bad caps. </s>
<s> Know what they look like, what to look for. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> BTW, system has been randomly not completing POST for the last three months now. </s>
<s> System is run six or seven times a month anyway as I am the primary user and I do not have either system networked together in a home network on a DSL connection, so I must move connections from one pc to the other to run them. </s>
<s> The Dell I use is the primary. </s>
<s> The Gateway is a dual boot system with Linux and Win98SE on it, primarily to run M$ Office Professional 2000 using Win98SE. </s>
<s> Win98SE runs just fine even though it was never designed to run a P4 processor. </s>
<s> Willy, I will install a new floppy drive as these are relatively inexpensive. </s>
<s> I did disable the floppy in BIOS to ensure the system would boot. </s>
<s> BIOS build date is 1/9/1999! </s>
<s> As it is used so little, I think it worth putting in the other PSU for now. </s>
<s> Another typo....(Sorry, it was late....) 512 MB RAM, BTW... </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>

<s> I have no answer. </s>
<s> No part number, maker, link means I can't look for it Those POST cards are pretty useless. </s>
<s> What good does it do you to see the North Bridge Chip failed when you can't replace that? </s>
<s> For the price of said card we can find another motherboard. </s>
<s> The 10% is not a rule, it's just a handy guideline to know when it's out of bounds. </s>
<s> The real spec is over at Intel.com if folk want it. </s>
<s> But I find easy to remember to be easy to remember. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Just be aware that &quot;bad caps&quot; are also in the PSU, something not readily seen until taken apart. </s>
<s> On top of that a bad cap can be one that's &quot;dried out&quot; literally void of the electrolytic fluid it needs and/or has degraded. </s>
<s> Your observations are tell-tale signs of a bad PSU, but you got your $ worth in a 10yr. </s>
<s> system. </s>
<s> I agree, a POST card is useless unless you have the means to repair and access to parts. </s>
<s> For me that would be looking at junk mtrbds., etc., and it doesn't pay when a new mtrbd. </s>
<s> easily returns the PC back to life. </s>
<s> As for the FD, if you like checkout a USB based one(if applicable) because here you can re-use it elsewhere. </s>
<s> Just a thought. </s>
<s> adios -----Willy </s>
<s> Got one. </s>
<s> Maybe two! </s>
<s> Willy, Okay, I replaced the PSU with one with exactly the same wattage output (160 watts minimum, 350 watts max) and got the machine running again, albeit for only about four hours. </s>
<s> Froze once again, and forced shutdown and got the yellow power light once more. </s>
<s> Purchased an new PSU 480 watt output, and that one went dead (temporarily) after only one hour. </s>
<s> If I turn it on now, power light is green, and system boots into linux. </s>
<s> Looks as if this is a heat related issue, at CPU maybe? </s>
<s> Both the CPU fan and PSU fans are running, but so quiet it is hard to hear. </s>
<s> Maybe the CPU fan is bad, or running too slowly? </s>
<s> System is clean of dust. </s>
<s> Also noticed when the case was open before third PSU failure, that the AGP 4x card, a nvidia M20 was running hot enough that I could barely smell it, but no smoke. </s>
<s> Card felt warm to the touch. </s>
<s> Card does not have a GPU heat sink fan installed, nor does it have a heat sink of any kind installed.. Card does run without any apparent problems. </s>
<s> HDD's and CD-ROM's were not connected at the time. </s>
<s> I show 12.52 volts and 5.25 volts at mains and 5.25 volts at floppy connection with the brand new unit, but this was before the PSU failure just now. </s>
<s> Will check again and report back I am saving the HDD's to get the files off of them later As it is, I am not throwing any more money at it, but would like to have the troubleshooting experience for the future should this ever come up again. </s>
<s> What to look for? </s>
