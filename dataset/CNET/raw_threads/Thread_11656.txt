The board runs at the slower speed of the slower sticks. You can sift through http://www.tomshardware.com/motherboard/20040119/ to see that even from PC2700 to PC3200 it will be doubtful you could tell any real difference except in a benchmark. Bob

That will not change with faster memory, so the speed will be no different. You would have to boost the FSB and that would require at least a processor upgrade (if not a motherboard upgrade as well). Buying faster memory expecting to use it in the future is almost always a waste of time, because the memory requirements change every couple of years, and that memory will most likely not be fast enough for your next system.
