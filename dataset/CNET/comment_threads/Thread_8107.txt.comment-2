Yeah, get some good education, you won't regret it.
I've built three computers and when/if something goes wrong with them, I enjoy fixing the problem (because I know what is in the computer and how it is put together); and I've had absolutely zero regrets about building my own computer, I'll NEVER go back to a pre-built piece of crap.
You just can't get past the quality of a homemade machine (so to speak).
With warranties and stuff wherever you buy your components, it should come with its own warranty; and you're your own tech support.
I purchase my components at http://www.newegg.com .
P.S.
Don't worry about BIOS', because you just shouldn't upgrade BIOS', you'll have to build a whole new computer before you'll want to do that.
