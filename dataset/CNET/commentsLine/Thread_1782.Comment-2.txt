your message implies, but doesn't state, you'll be using your laptop for college.
you don't state if you're already in college or will be attending later.
i assume you're already in, and know what you need.
if you're not already in, you should first find out what the college recommends.
you wouldn't want to be using a mac when the college and other students are using ms.
