I have a MacBook Air.
I have it connected to a large external monitor and use it mostly like a desktop.
What makes most sense for battery life: a) Keep it plugged in at all times while using?
b) Use on battery all the time (up to 100%, run down to 0, back up to 100% ...)?
As a rule, I do not turn the computer off, put it to sleep at night, so if you recommend &quot;a&quot;, what about at night?
Keep it plugged in, or recharge in the morning?
And if recharge, run it to 0 first?
Or what?
Thanks.
