I have the same issue, running the same router, but with the original v1 model.
It often locks up, and the only fix is to manually reset the power.
I've tried the same maintenance as well - firmware upgrades, cleaning out temp, cache, and cookie files, etc.
Though it could be a specific problem with the 108 Mbps function, I've yet to find a solution.
It's dissapointing, but the only solution (if you want to maintain 108 Mbps) may be to upgrade to a new model, though there's no guarantee that you won't run into the same problem.
