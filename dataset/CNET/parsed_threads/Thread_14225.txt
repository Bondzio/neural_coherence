<s> I want to buy an ATI Radeon 9800 256mb AGP 8x graphics card, and I found two results, the first is SAPPHIRE ATI Radeon 9800Pro AGP8X 256MB 256-bit DDR CRT DVI TV-Out Graphics Card, while the other is ATI RADEON 9800 PRO - 256 MB, both seem to have same specs, but one is made by sapphire?? </s>
<s> What is sapphire, and why is that one $80 dollars cheaper? </s>
<s> Sapphire is a manufacturer who buys the video controller chips from ATI and mounts them on their own boards, or boards purchased from a board house actually. </s>
<s> Sapphire's prices are lower than most others as they use lower quality components such as cheaper memory chips, lower quality transistors, fan, etc. </s>
<s> Having worked for a memory manufacturer, I can tell you that there are many different quality chips and even boards available for purchase within the industry. </s>
<s> ATI is the developer of the video controller and chips. </s>
<s> They make their own full video card product, as well as sell their chipsets to other manufacturers. </s>
<s> The ATI product line uses top quality parts, and is therefore more expensive. </s>
<s> ATI gives basic support for its chipset even when purchased from another manufacturer. </s>
<s> However, they give full support, including full exchanges on their own brand name products. </s>
<s> If a Sapphire board fails, you would deal with them as far as repair or exchange. </s>
<s> The same is true for other manufacturers using the ATI chipsets. </s>
<s> This is also true for the nVidia line. </s>
<s> Personally, having worked for a manufacturer that made it's own high quality line of memory, and a value line of memory, I prefer the name brand. </s>
<s> There was a definite difference in the parts being used. </s>
<s> Is there a performance difference, or is the hardware quality difference unnoticable? </s>
<s> I can't answer that as I don't know. </s>
<s> I just personally prefer the real thing, Coke Cola tastes better to me than one of the copies I have read that the fans may be noisier on some manufacturer's cards, and I've seen some that don't even have fans on them, using just a large heat sink instead. </s>
<s> Is it possible that someone has improved on ATI's own design? </s>
<s> I would think that's a possibility at least. </s>
<s> Would it be much cheaper? </s>
<s> I wouldn't tend to think so for the most part. </s>
<s> The memory manufacturer I worked for made memory that could be used in HP's, for example. </s>
<s> It was cheaper, and used comparable if not better chips. </s>
<s> But with the HP, you were paying for their proprietary name, no more than that. </s>
<s> With the video cards though, you are looking at more of a difference, more components that can vary in quality used to create the whole. </s>
<s> boards tend to break down (visual quality) the more you ask them to do. </s>
<s> This creates a heat problem that sturdier components can handle better. </s>
<s> It's like running a cheap power supply against a high-quality one. </s>
<s> After X number of hours on..the cheaper will not put out the same wattage as when first turned on. </s>
<s> Make sense? </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
<s> &quot;They make their own full video card product, as well as sell their chipsets to other manufacturers&quot; in fact ati employs sapphire to make some of its cards including the popular x800xl where did u hear dis misinformation from? </s>
<s> &quot;Sapphire's prices are lower than most others as they use lower quality components such as cheaper memory chips, lower quality transistors&quot; </s>
<s> As I said, I don't know about Sapphire, whether it is great or not. </s>
<s> As for lower quality boards and components ... from being in-house 4th level technical support for a memory manufacturer, I can without question state that there are different quality printed circuit boards made, and various quality memory chips, and transistor chips to purchase from. </s>
<s> Lower cost usually means lower quality components being used. </s>
<s> We made PCMCIA modems in house, they were very high quality, rating as one of the best available. </s>
<s> Then we started buying those made outside to cut back on costs ... cheaper components that we put our name on and paid the price with crap in crap out. </s>
<s> I'll stick with the name brand ... knowing that their standards are usually higher, and knowing they will fully back up their own name ... just as we ate it backing up the lousy modems years back, sending out better product to replace the cheap stuff that failed to preserve our reputation. </s>
<s> Also another consideration is the included boxed components (cables, adapters,etc.) </s>
<s> printed manuals, driver supprort and d/l availability for updates and the quality of the packaging. </s>
<s> Some include retail versions of games, o/c software or other products. </s>
<s> (video apps, etc.) </s>
<s> Personally, after purchasing both built by ATI and powered by ATI products, I'll plunk down my hard earned duckits for the built by boards. </s>
