hello, i have had his exact problem with two wd's.
one, i am looking at right now, that is just out of time for wd to replace it.
i get nothing on a boot except the loud clicking from the inner coiled disk reader.
i can't even access it as a slave to recover anything on it.
the other trouble maker was the maxtor 20 gig that mysteriously lost the two back partitions.
i had it partitioned in 3 for several years with no problems, not even the clicking he mentioned from his maxtors.
one morning, no access to the d, e drives.
they didn't appear in the my computer listing either.
uh oh!
i ran a program called recover my data, sure enough, after a very lengthy run, it found all the data from both back drives but they want $75 to say hello to this data again.
i have no idea why the partitions became hidden.
its never happened before, though i've formatted other drives exactly the same was, even the one i'm using now...an 80 gig wd.
i even tried to access these hidden partitions in dos, but that didn't fly either.
not even with fdisk.
so, i aggravate myself intentionally sometimes as i look at the maxtor 20 gig with all that stuff on it that i can't recover.
