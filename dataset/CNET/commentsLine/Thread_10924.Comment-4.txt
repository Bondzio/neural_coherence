if you have the full xp cd you can install a parallel install of the os and gain access to your files to back up prior to attempter repair of the os.
since all safe modes fail (your reply), even the command line one, we now face an os repair and failing that an os install.
here's the links for the parallel install.
use the article you can follow.
if none work for you, then it's shop time since the hardware has likely failed.
