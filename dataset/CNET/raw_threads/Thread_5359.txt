I am currently about to upgrade my Processor which is a Intel P4 2.53 533 FSB to 3.0 800FSB. My concern is will my motherboard which is 533 FSB can it hand 800 FSB will it work? Thanks Tyrone

2002	5	60751	721088	720896	R. Proffitt	1/28/05 9:28 AM	1.10690448E12	Incredible difference.	Here's why. The boards I tried (over a dozen) either didn't boot or if they did booted XP in 30 minutes rather than the usual 1 or 2. Of course you should try this so you don't have to take my word for it. Bob

As far as the difference in the 533 - 800 FSB for a Intel P4 with PC2700 DDR333 Ram Working with music programs, how much of a difference in speed and handling apps will there be.
2002	7	60751	721733	721403	R. Proffitt	1/28/05 12:33 PM	1.10691558E12	The 800MHz P4 with HT ran 10 times slower than..	The P4 2.4GHz with 533 MHz CPU. It was rather incredibly slow. Not many of the dozen boards even booted with the 800 MHz FSB P4. Clear enough?
2002	8	60751	721949	721733	TyroneB	1/28/05 1:35 PM	1.1069193E12	Not what I mean	IF i had a motherboard that supported 800 FSB would it out perform a Motherboard that supports 533 FSB If so will it be noticable
2002	9	60751	721964	721949	R. Proffitt	1/28/05 1:40 PM	1.1069196E12	BIG DIFFERENCE. Let me share about Seti.	My old P4 2.4 GHz 533 churns out a SETI unit in 6 hours on average. The new P4 3.0E 800MHz FSB box does that in 3 or 3.3 hours. Very nice. Bob
