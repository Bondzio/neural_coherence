<s> I decided to upgrade my ancient dual Pentium Pro 200mhz Socket 8 system to a faster speed. </s>
<s> The way I chose to do it was by acquiring two Pentium II Overdrive Processors(PODP66X333 SL2KE). </s>
<s> These Overdrive Processors will effectively raise the speed of my system from 200mhz to 333mhz. </s>
<s> The problem I'm having is that the Processors did not come with Heatsinks and Fans. </s>
<s> I've searched ebay, spoken to a rep from Sanyo-Denki, and Googled till I'm about to Girgle. </s>
<s> Can anyone help? </s>
<s> I'm including the following link which shows a really good image of the Heatsink & Fan attached to the Processor. </s>

<s> 1coolpc.com Didn't you have another post on this that I responded to? </s>
<s> Just a little etiquette is to answer your posts rather than create new ones so we don't start over with the same answer. </s>
<s> I don't look up if that was you. </s>
