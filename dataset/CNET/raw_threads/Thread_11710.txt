So what you should discover is that there is not perfect router that rules them all. I have many routers if you count the ones at the office but for home I picked a simple Netgear 3800. It covers an area half your space with ease and further at lower numbers of bars. But I wonder why you are asking this question. That is, you should have seen this question before and know what the answer is. Bob

Hello, We do not have any such legal problem in India as of now for the router power etc for home users. I want the best router so that I can use it at home (in an office environment too). I have not seen this question before anywhere, As i am the one making it on few more sites, as I have to purchase this today, we have some clients expected in office and have to show them important presentations. I posted this question on tomshwardware too, if I can get better solution from available choices I have. I have only following routers I can buy in my city at present (apart from the flipkart link I gave you above), please let me know if you can suggest something. http://www.flipkart.com/computers/network-components/router-20261?ref=f11e69f9-c6eb-4225-bf88-1570a3ee4f23&_pop=brdcrumb http://www.homeshop18.com/wireless-router/categoryid:3254/search:wireless+router/listView:false/sort:Price+High-to-Low/start:0/ http://www.primeabgb.com/index.php?orderby=product_price&DescOrderBy=DESC&Itemid=53&option=com_virtuemart&page=shop.browse&category_id=72&manufacturer_id=0&keyword=&keyword1=&keyword2= http://www.bitfang.com/wireless-router/

I have the Netgear WNDR 4500 router and couldn't ask for more from a router. My garage is not attached and is about 65 feet from the router located in the house. That would be thru 4 walls total. I can take my iPad to the furthermost end of the garage and still have 3 bars and never skips a beat. I have a smart TV, wireless blu-ray player, iPad, laptop, smartphone, wireless printer and two more laptops plus their smartphones when the Grandkids are here and have never had any problems with connections.
