i have exactly the same problem with 3 pcs.
2 of them are brand new celeron-d machines.
they work in my shop but not at my customers site.
i have tried putting in a new power circuit and using surge protectors.
the cpu and power fans work perfectly.
i get lockups while in the bios or when windows starts or has been running for 20-30 min.
i think it may be related to the wireless g communications card (dlink).
it works on some networks but not on others.
do you have a wireless card in the pc?
