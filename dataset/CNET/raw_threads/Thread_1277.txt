For years I used a cast off PC with: 1. 8 Meg of ram. 2. 486dx33 CPU. 3. 3.5 inch boot diskette 4. ISA modem And a copy of any of the below... &quot;insanely easy to use&quot; http://www.freesco.info/ http://www.coyotelinux.com/downloads/channel.php?ChannelID=5 and so on. You don't see many routers with dialup support for two reasons. a. Windows ICS does that. b. Support. People want support and most don't want to pay. Bob
