I have just installed a Logitech optical Wheel mouse on my Windows 98 computer. It is attached to a USB port. My old mouse was connected to a PS/2 port. Now, when i start my computer i have to have that old mouse in the port other wise it comes with a message before Windows opens up saying that the computer cannot find a PS/2 pointer device. Any suggestions?

Plug mouse into adapter, plug adapter into PS/2 mouse port: voila! optical PS/2 mouse. If you didn't get such in your package, you may be able to find it at a local Computer store.
