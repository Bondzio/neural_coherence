<s> I am getting Altec Lansing 5100 Enhanced speakers ( http://www.altecmm.com/product_details.asp?pID=5100&sID=1 ) and I don't know what sound card to get. </s>
<s> People say Audigy 2.. but when I google for audigy 2 several different ones show up and I don't know which one exaclty would best suit me. </s>
<s> I want it for listening to music and watching dvds mostly, but there will be gaming in there too.. </s>
<s> Anyone have any suggestions? </s>
<s> I need all the help I can get, I'm totally confused Thanks! </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> http://www.soundblaster.com/products/Audigy2ZS_platinum_pro/ Only 3 boxes to choose from. </s>
<s> All great stuff. </s>
<s> Alternative with 5.1 output (IMHO) is the Turtle Beach Santa Cruz at http://www.turtlebeach.com/site/products/santacruz/specs.asp Bob </s>
