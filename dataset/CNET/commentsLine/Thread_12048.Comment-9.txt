your download speed is dictated by your isp and the bottlenecks that bob mentioned.
period.
my cisco cable modem is docsis-3 and is rated at gigabit output speed as is my d-link router.
my cable speed is 15 megabits/second.
what do you think my download speed is?
my wireless n is rated at 54 mb/s.
what speed do you think i get?
both questions, i get 15 mb/s on a good day, usually slower because of those accursed bottlenecks.
in other words, you get what your isp provides.
now, on my home network, between devices, i get blistering speeds.
