<s> I currently own a low-end monochrome laser printer (the Samsung ML-2510, which replaced a Brother laser printer that was a hand-me-down from work) and an Epson Perfection 3490 flatbed scanner (used for approx. </s>
<s> 90% of my product images in my eBay auctions). </s>
<s> The scanner sits on my computer desk, while the printer is on a repurposed rolling wooden TV cart (quite roomy)next to the computer desk. </s>
<s> When the time comes to replace either the printer or the scanner, should I replace both at once with a (prob. </s>
<s> inkjet) multifunction machine (no more expensive than the combined cost of 2 single-function machines ($200? </s>
<s> ), but pref. </s>
<s> much less)? </s>
<s> Or (assuming one can still get standalone flatbed scanners priced for home-office use by then) should I stick with my current setup of a separate printer and scanner (bulkier, but roomy scanning surface, and (theoretically) cheaper per/copy cost for laser toner)? </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Unless conserving space is more important than quality and/or reliability, I'd buy products dedicated for one purpose each. </s>
<s> All-in-ones are space savers but none can produce the quality of dedicated components. </s>
<s> As well, all-in-ones share electronics and a failure of shared parts causes the whole thing to be a goner. </s>
<s> It really comes down to user choice and need but, yes, you can find dedicated flatbeds or those with document feeders if you really need them. </s>
<s> As for inkjet, versus laser printing, the choice is yours again. </s>
<s> Inkjets can still do a better job with some graphics but the cost per page is much higher. </s>
<s> Laser printers do an excellent job with text and the cost per page is much lower than inkjet. </s>
<s> I'd never recommend inkjet types to anyone who prints very little as the cost per page goes up dramatically due to extra cleaning cycles and sometimes lost cartridges due to clogging. </s>
<s> The main problem with laser printing is sticker shock when it's time to replace toner. </s>
<s> But, you can get thousands of printed pages per cartridge with some laser printers and, hopefully, the printer will last until an expensive cartridge is empty. </s>
<s> Hopefully this doesn't add more confusion to your decision process. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> I have a separate nice HP scanner and little Brother laser printer and an HP Photosmart inkjet printer. </s>
<s> Then my husband needed to print out large 11x17 printouts so we got a Brother all-in-one. </s>
<s> Boy is it nice to have. </s>
<s> It's not even hooked up to a computer all the time. </s>
<s> We just plug in the usb when we need to print from it. </s>
<s> And you don't have to have the computer on just to make a photocopy. </s>
<s> Just walk up and copy. </s>
<s> Just like a real office copy machine! </s>
<s> I loved my old Brother laser printer -- I'd gotten used to it at work, and I could get high-yield house-brand toner cartridges for it pretty cheap from Quill (the other office-supply chains all seemed to carry house-brand toner for it, too). </s>
<s> I'm curious as to which Brother multifunction machine you got; my local Pamida store carries 2 different models (plus a current-model Brother monochrome personal laser printer). </s>
<s> None of the Brother printers are currently on sale at Pamida; however, since they usually put one printer on sale each week, I can get one locally at a decent price if I'm willing to wait. </s>
<s> (Maybe their price-matching policy would stretch to same-model printers on sale at those out-of-town office supply chain stores, too!) </s>
<s> I'd like to match the scanner size of my current standalone scanner (the Epson 3490 scans originals up to 8.5&quot;x14&quot;); I also like the idea of having separate cyan/magenta/yellow cartridges instead of a single multicolor cartridge (sounds less wasteful that way). </s>
<s> It sounds like you got a &quot;tabloid-size&quot; multifunction machine; where did you get it, and how much did it cost? </s>
<s> Got it for him for Christmas 2009. </s>
<s> At Staples, it was 119.99 ($80 dollars off of 199) We really like it. </s>
<s> It has the color cartridges. </s>
<s> I even bought an extra paper tray for it so I can keep regular size paper in one and the 11x17 Ledger paper in the other. </s>
<s> Very easy to switch, pull one out and slide the other in. </s>
<s> It's accross the room from my desktop computer. </s>
<s> I bought a real long usb cord and just plug it into my computer if I want to print to it. </s>
<s> But usually my husband plugs his laptop into it. </s>
<s> My laser is a Brother HL-2140. </s>
<s> It was a real workhorse, too -- until it died. </s>
<s> I Googled your Brother MFC-5890CN, and saw that CNET really savaged it in their review (although it got fairly decent user reviews). </s>
<s> I could have sworn the scanning surface of my Epson 3490 was legal-size (which would have made multifunction devices with 8.5&quot;x11.7&quot; scanning surfaces (f.ex. </s>
<s> CNET's top-rated Lexmark S305 &amp; S605) problematic choices. </s>
<s> However, I finally got out a measuring tape to measure the 3490's scanning surface -- and it's only about 9&quot;x12&quot; (to fit European A4 paper originals?) </s>
<s> -- so it's not that big after all. </s>
<s> No big immediate rush on getting a new printer or scanner for me, so I can wait for a really good sale or coupon special (or the next time I get a big Amazon.com credit from sending off my oldest's college textbooks to their buyback program! </s>
<s> ). </s>
<s> I just measured the top of my repurposed wooden TV cart/printer stand, and it's about 15&quot;x26&quot; - a great fit for my current Samsung ML-2510 laser printer, but not quite deep enough for a Brother MFC-5890CN like the one that volvogirl &amp; her spouse own. </s>
<s> At least now I have a upper limit to look for with the dimensions of a replacement printer or multifunction machine! </s>
<s> Here's a link to it: http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2365881,00.asp The article goes at the question from the angle of how much scanner one needs. </s>
<s> Of course, how much printing one does, what kind of printing one does, and whether or not one needs to do that printing in color would also be relevant considerations. </s>
<s> Laser toner cost/page vs. inkjet cartridge cost/page would also be worth considering. </s>
<s> For example, OEM Samsung toner cartridges for my current laser printer run about $80, and are rated for 3,000 pages each. </s>
<s> (Those seem very expensive, though, so I've been buying generic compatible toner cartridges on eBay for approx. </s>
<s> $30 each including shipping -- but I'd prefer house brand toner cartridges from an office supply chain, if anyone made them for the Samsung.) </s>
<s> How much would inkjet cartridges for that many pages cost? </s>
<s> (I'm guessing they'd be more expensive, but let's assume a best-case scenario of a MFP brand which already has cheap name-brand regular (&amp; high-yield, where available) ink cartridges and/or widely-available even cheaper house-brand or generic compatible ink cartridges, plus separate cyan/magenta/yellow cartridges instead of a single multicolor cartridge (in addition to the black cartridge).) </s>
<s> Since you have a home-based business, I suggest you buy an inkjet multi-function printer when you can and retire your flatbed scanner while it is still working. </s>
<s> Put the scanner in storage for emergency-backup use, and continue using the monochrome laser printer (especially for shipping/mailing labels that won't smear if they get rained on) until it finally quits. </s>
<s> This way, you already have a backup printer on your desktop as well as a way of handling color print jobs when necessary. </s>
<s> Cost-per page is generally higher for inkjets than lasers, so plan on replacing the monochrome inkjet when it finally gives up the ghost. </s>
<s> I would not suggest a color laser printer as your only home-business printer; I gave one away because I seemed to be replacing one of the four toner cartridges every time I turned around, even though we didn't do a lot of color printing. </s>
<s> (It's called &quot;four-color black&quot; printing, and it happens with inkjets too.) </s>
<s> My household has three printer/scanner combos -- a several-years-old HP PhotoSmart 2610, a two-year-old Canon Pixma MP620 and a one-year-old Canon Pixma MP620. </s>
<s> The HP was a good small-business printer when I bought it, and it still works well after doing more printing and scanning than I care to think about. </s>
<s> The two newer Canons are faster, considerably smaller, give better results both scanning and printing, and cost less than the bigger machine. </s>
<s> I like the Canons a lot, but they were bought strictly for home use, and neither has gotten much of a workout yet, so I don't know how they would hold up long-term in a home-based business. </s>
<s> I bought a Brother DCP-J125 (their current bottom-of-the-line inkjet multifunction printer) on sale from my local Pamida for $49.95 (and immediately stocked up on compatible ink cartridges (15 for $22) from eBay). </s>
<s> The color printouts are certainly attractive, and the included BookScan Enhancer software will streamline a lot of the product-image scanning I do for my eBay auctions. </s>
<s> However: 1) I thought access to my day job's fax machine would be sufficient -- until a problem came up over the weekend, which I could have dealt with a lot faster, had I had a home fax of some kind. </s>
<s> 2) The paper cassette on the Brother only holds 100 sheets, whereas I'm used to 250-sheet paper trays on laser printers I've used. </s>
<s> (A minor inconvenience, having to refill paper more frequently, but it's there nonetheless.) </s>
<s> 3) I don't like the included PaperPort software (too complex for convenient editing of eBay product-image scans). </s>
<s> I tried upgrading ArcSoft PhotoImpression 5 (which came with my old Epson scanner) to version 6.5, but decided I really prefer the old version (which, when patched, works fine with Windows 7). </s>
<s> I now plan to buy a used standalone copy of PhotoImpression 5, so I'll still have a program disc for it, even if I sell the old scanner. </s>
<s> 4) I thought that the scanning glass would be about the same size on my old Epson scanner & the new Brother DCP-J125 (I had measured the Epson's glass before buying the Brother); however, the scannable area of the Brother seems to be slightly smaller. </s>
<s> I now wish I had held out for an MFP with at least a legal-size flatbed scanner -- even if that would have meant springing for a larger printer cart as well. </s>
<s> I will still &quot;make do&quot; with the DCP-J125 for now, but may well start saving up for an even nicer MFP down the road. </s>
