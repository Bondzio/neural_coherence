you could refer to intel's chipset website ( http://www.intel.com/products/desktop/chipsets/index.htm?iid=chips_body+desk ) which shows which cpus are compatible with the chipset.
but that doesn't mean that your motherboard's bios has enabled support for all potential cpus.
you may get the info from you system vendor's website, but generally they only tell you what it came with, not what can be put in it.
anyway, your 925x mobo is limited to single core cpus only.
(the 945, 946, 965, and 975 chipsets are required for dual-core pentium-d; 945 and 975 chipsets may support core2duo depending on the motherboard; 946 and 965 definitely support core2duo.)
your motherboard is made by intel.
there's a good chance it will support a p4-3.4ghz.
i don't know if $100 is worth it for a 13% cpu boost: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=80822 you could replace your motherboard and cpu to get to core2duo.
your hard drive, cd/dvd, ram, and video card can be reused.
