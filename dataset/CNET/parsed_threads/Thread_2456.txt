<s> i have a host dell desktop with xp and a guest emachine desktop also with xp. </s>
<s> i have a linksys broadband router and a linksys wireless card. </s>
<s> the dell has working internet with no problems. </s>
<s> i have tried to set up a network (many times) and the wireless connection is fine. </s>
<s> however, the local area connection says &quot;the network cable is unplugged&quot;. </s>
<s> ??? </s>
<s> its wireless, right? </s>
<s> what does this mean? </s>
<s> ethernet port in the back of your PC? </s>
<s> XP could be reporting it as being unplugged. </s>
<s> im sorry, but i dont know where the ethernet port is that probably means i have an unused one </s>
<s> a telephone jack would, but slightly bigger. </s>
<s> Usually on the back panel of a new PC. </s>
<s> yes, they are both empty is that bad? </s>
<s> It would just indicate that Windows is properly reporting that you are not using the ethernet port. </s>
<s> Since your wireless connection is working, there is no problem. </s>
<s> it says the wireless connection is working, but i cannot access the internet on that computer </s>
<s> Did you enable DHCP on the router (WAP) Did you get an IP address? </s>
<s> Did you use WEP or WPA security? </s>
<s> Have you tried to add your WiFi network to this computer? </s>
<s> Tell us how you install your WiFi and the setting you have done. </s>
<s> &quot;the dell has working internet with no problems. </s>
<s> i have tried to set up a network (many times) and the wireless connection is fine.&quot; it appears you have a working internet connection. </s>
<s> i had been using dhcp, but i checked and it had not put in the settings correctly. </s>
<s> I then stopped using dhcp; i put in the settings without it. </s>
<s> i did get an IP address i used WEP 128-bit security i tried to install the network on the main computer and it said, &quot;The wizard cannot create a wireles network, either because a wireless network adapter is not installed or because software for the wireless network adapter is not installed.&quot; i just installed it, but i didn't get a choice on what channel to use, and it chose the wrong one (it picked 6, my other computer is using 11) how do i change that? </s>
<s> im sorry, the computer that needs the wireless connection says the wireless connection is fine, but i still have no access to the internet on it the computer that directly connects to the router has working internet </s>
<s> u have 2 local area connections turn off the one thats not for ur wireless connection </s>
<s> i got it to work i have internet in my room and downstairs thank you so much for helping </s>
