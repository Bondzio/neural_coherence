Hi, Thanks for the info it's been very helpful and about my budget, I could probably spend around $2300 So what do you think about this setup than: E6850 3.0 4MB/1333MHZ (ah what about Q6600 2.4 8MB/1066MHZ does this make a big difference) P5K DELUXE, P5K3 DELUXE, P5K PREMIUM AND THE P5K3 DELUXE I got them at more or less the same price around $235 (I'm planing to make a slight overclock nothing extreme) 8800gtx/768mb where I am buying my stuff they dont have the 512mb only 8800gtx and 8800gts 640mb so it's between this two.
MEM DDR2 1GB X 2 1066MHZ PC8500 CORSAIR DOMINATOR (4GB $396) MEM DDR2 2GB X 2 800MHZ CORSAIR (4GB $282) THE SOYO HAS 1366X768 THANKS....
