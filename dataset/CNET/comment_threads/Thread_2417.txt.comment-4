but it's slower than a $160 9600gt.
i doubt if your agp board has socket 775, so your best cpu option will probably be a 3ghz socket 478 p4 for about $80.
that cpu will only be comparable to low-end dual core cpu at best.
so, a gpu+cpu upgrade will wind up costing you $290 and you'll still be in the low-end.
instead, get a $80 mobo ( GIGABYTE GA-P35-S3G ), a $150 video card ( palit 9600gt ), and a $120 cpu ( core2duo e4500 , OC it 3ghz by selecting 1066fsb).
add 2gb of ram for $40 and you're at $400... only $110 above your agp upgrade but much much faster and firmly in mid-range.
