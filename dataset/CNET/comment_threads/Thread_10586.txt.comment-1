This is both a peripheral and a software question.
Having no experience with any of the chat platforms or PC video cameras, I am looking for suggestions on which is the best camera/chat combo to use with my daughter and granddaughter.
I am in Michigan, she is in Montana.
We both have PC's running XP, and both have DSL.
