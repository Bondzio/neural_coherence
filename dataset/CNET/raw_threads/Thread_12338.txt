I am still having trouble moving or even getting the drive to recognize the contents of this folder. - When I woke up this morning the drive was making a loud noise and the orange read light is solid. - I can no longer get the drive to mount. - When I unplug the power for 10 secs and the USB cable for 10 secs, then replug in same sequence, there is a beeping noise that happens about 3x, then the read light goes solid, the humming noise begins, and I cannot get the drive to mount. Suggestions? I have a feeling I'm going to have to unplug/replug and a stroke of luck one day will allow me to access my files.......boo. Thanks to whoever reads and responds!
