<s> My computer is 6 yrs old, it's an XP Professional, 80 gig, 1G memory. </s>
<s> Now all of a sudden a window keeps popping up for a split second saying Windows Installer. </s>
<s> How do I get rid of it? </s>
<s> I'll give you the name of a tool I clean out PENDING INSTALLS with. </s>
<s> It's called the Microsoft Installer Cleanup Utility. </s>
<s> But while we have the tool, we don't know which entry to remove. </s>
<s> You'll have to see if any other clues are available. </s>
