<s> I have an Antec (TruePower 2.0 I think) 550watt PSU that I put in my newly built machine 4 months ago. </s>
<s> There is a utility that came with my Asus P5B deluxe/Wifi-AP motherboard on the ASUS CD called PCProbeII. </s>
<s> I installed it to check my CPU and motherboard temps and it beeped and gave me a red warning window that said my power fan was running at 980RPM and that it was an issue. </s>
<s> My CPU fan is going at 2200RPM but it did not give me a red warning screen I have an Apevia ASPIRE case. </s>
<s> Yesterday I took my PC to the college tech support center for them to reinstall Windows XP. </s>
<s> The employee said that my 2 case fans were blowing air the wrong way and told me to reverse them. </s>
<s> So I did and the PCProbeII said my CPU was at 84-87 degrees F and the motherboard was 81F. </s>
<s> My case sensor says the inside of the case is 65-70 degrees F when the system in idle. </s>
<s> Is there another way to check the RPM on the PSU? </s>
<s> or should I just switch the fans I changed back around?? </s>
<s> The system seems to be running 5-10 F cooler now but I don't know if the clean XP install is making it work less or the fans are doing it? </s>
<s> Please help I don't want to fry any of my PC. </s>
<s> the volatage switch was halfway switched between the 115V and the 230V setting.. that could've make the fan spped hit 985 and tell PCProbeII it was too fast couldn't it? </s>
<s> telling you that your PSU fan is running too slow, not too fast. </s>
<s> However, if your PSU has never shutdown from over heating then it is probably running at a perfectly fine RPM. </s>
<s> You can change the warning threshold in PCProbe II or disable it completely. </s>
<s> Also, the PSU fan only cools the PSU, not the computer. </s>
<s> It's best to have a mix of fans, some blowing air into the case, and some blowing air out of the case. </s>
<s> The one plugged into the mobo is the second one and is temperature controlled. </s>
<s> Thus since your system is running so cool, there is no need for it to run faster, will then just make more news. </s>
<s> Another poster told you the real problem, you likely have set the fan limit too low in probe or in the BIOS.. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
