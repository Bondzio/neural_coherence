this is really a vista glitch.
most drivers are in the system32 folder.
c://windows/system32 printer drivers need to be installed in each computer.
my home printer setup is dell wireless printer adapter 3300 plugged into my dell photo aio printer 964. i installed the printer drivers in all three laptops(windows xp).
i do not have to leave a host computer on to print.
daughter can print from her room, son can also, aand i can print from the back patio, when it's nice out.
we use a netgear router that has the firmware updated broadcast ssid use wpa security(wep can be hacked) use nothing else.
never loose a connection and we can always print, scan, copy or fax when we want to.
