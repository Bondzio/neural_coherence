quick answer, visit the website:  and enter your pc info and it will report what it supports in ram.
the above sony support webpage for your model# pc, offers it came with vista and p4 type cpu.
under these conditions, it will support for a 32-bit os, upto 4gb of ram.
yes, it report 4gb of ram but will only use 3.3gb due to 32-bit limitations.
since this is a p4 type cpu, it won't be upgradable to 64-bit os, should you think that or it won't be the best option.
when it comes to ram, practically all makers supply the ram needs and allocation of what it accepts in the manual or support website, visit it.
