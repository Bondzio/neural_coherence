Can ANYONE tell me if it is safe to buy a monitor on ebay and how in the world can they sell them so much cheaper that Dell does.
Some guys have 25 of the same monitor.
I know this is not a technical help question but I wonder how they do it.
Guess my main question still is whether it is safe and will Dell honor the warranty?
Thanks so much for any light on this question.
