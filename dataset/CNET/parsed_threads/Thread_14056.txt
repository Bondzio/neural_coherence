<s> I have a BFG GeForce 6200 (AGP) and it says it's overclocked, but http://www.digital-daily.com/video/peredelki/ says a GF6200 can be overclocked to 700mhz core clock.After looking at 6200's overclocking capabilities at various web cites I found a program, Riva Tuner(To download it just google it and you will find it fairly quickly), is said to overclock this card to the core clock speeds of a GF 6600. </s>
<s> If used this program would I fry the graphics card, overheat the PC, Drastically decrease the shelflife of the video card, I've heard that's it's risky to overclock My system info is if it is any help... Intel P4 2.66ghz HT 512 Kingston PC3200 Ram AGP 8x BFG GeForce 6200OC 300Watt power supply 1 40gb ATA HD Win 98 OS </s>
<s> I hope you know that OC'ing will void that beatiful lifetime warranty. </s>
<s> That PSU might not be able to handle it. </s>
<s> If you OC too much, it might fry the card. </s>
<s> It will cause your heat to go up. </s>
<s> If you do overclock, I would make sure that other parts, especially the GPU, have great cooling. </s>
<s> I've heard &quot;rumours&quot; about reducing the shelf-life of products, but I don't have solid evidence. </s>
<s> What games are you playing that you want more FPS in? </s>
<s> It'd be a better investment to get another 512 of memory, or upgrade the CPU, or even a bigger hard drive. </s>
<s> Just my $.02. </s>
<s> ~Ibrahim~ </s>
<s> I'm getting around 20 frames per second on BF Vietnam and I might get Far Cry soon. </s>
<s> If I get it I'll want to run all the highest graphics settings. </s>
<s> How mich will adding 512 Ram increase my frame rates? </s>
<s> When you add another 512, frames will go up, way up. </s>
<s> I don't want to be a party pooper, but Far Cry on highest settings taxes even the fastest cards out there. </s>
<s> You'd have to get at least a 6800 to play most settings on high, sorry. </s>
<s> I'm not trying to be mean, kind of the truth. </s>
<s> http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,1830196,00.asp &quot;...It's hard to believe, but Far Cry shows that we still have plenty of need for more powerful graphics cards...&quot; And that doesn't even have the fastest card listed. </s>
<s> Sorry... http://www.tweaktown.com/articles/726/3/geforce_6200_page_3_the_card_and_overclocking/index.html &quot;...When it came to overclocking, the 6200 reference card was not the best overclocking unit in the world. </s>
<s> We managed to get from 300MHz default core to 332 MHz using the stock cooler. </s>
<s> Memory was somewhat of a disappointment, at 275MHz or 550MHz DDR we only managed to push it to 300MHz (or 600MHz DDR) which is not the best in the world let me assure you...&quot; If you really want to get a performance boost and want to take some risk, try it. </s>
<s> But remember, your card might not OC that much. </s>
<s> I would try this, but remember the warranty: Get the temps on the card, OC the card very slowly. </s>
<s> But if you want a bit of a bigger boost, flash it the way your site says. </s>
<s> I'm not the best to comment on what effects that could cause, but the performance would be greater if you unlocked the pipes as well. </s>
<s> Just my $.02 ~Ibrahim~ </s>
<s> I used to play BFV, a great game. </s>
<s> Shame most ppl have stopped playing, my new (actually old) computer doesn't even have an open PCI slot for a GPU, lol. </s>
<s> Have fun! </s>
<s> Also, what game settings are you playing the game at? </s>
<s> ~Ibrahim~ </s>
<s> I'm getting 20-40 frames per second on it. </s>
<s> It'll lag sometimes </s>
<s> You can OC using this. </s>
<s> I have a 5700LE OC'ed to over 100MHz from stock core and mem. </s>
<s> o unlock Coolbits: 1. </s>
<s> Open the Start\Run dialog box, and type Regedit and hit OK 2.Browse to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\NVIDIACorporation\Global\NvTweak\ 3.Then right click and go to New and choose DWORD Value 4. </s>
<s> Rename the DWORD value the comes up to CoolBits(without quotes) 5. </s>
<s> Right click on it to Modify it 6. </s>
<s> And then change the value to 3 and the base to Decimal Once you do this, go back to your nVidia control panel. </s>
<s> You should see some new options. </s>
<s> One of these options is Clock Frequency Settings. </s>
<s> Select this, click Manual overclocking and then hit Detect Optimal Frequencies. </s>
<s> Ive found this to be fairly reliable. </s>
<s> However use this at your own discretion. </s>
<s> Keep on eye on temperatures in your case. </s>
<s> resolution? </s>
<s> It is a little old game, though. </s>
<s> Do you AA/AF turned on? </s>
<s> ~Ibrahim~ </s>
<s> Res. </s>
<s> is 1024x768 </s>
