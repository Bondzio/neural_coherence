<s> I have two computers - one with Windows XP Home Edition and the other with Windows XP Professional - which I have been trying to network with USB Bluetooth devices. </s>
<s> Though, Bluetooth &quot;Network Access&quot; connection can be made, computers cannot, in most cases, find each other in the workgroup; and when one happened to find the other, trying to access files cannot be established. </s>
<s> Error message received is &quot;[named] computer is not accessible. </s>
<s> You might not have permission to use this network resource. </s>
<s> Contact the administrator of the server to find out if you have access permissions. </s>
<s> The network path was not found.&quot; Drive C of both computers including a printer attached to one have been assigned sharing permissions. </s>
<s> Can anyone help me resolve this problem to enable me interact with the computers with each other instead of moving from one to the other. </s>
<s> I have McAfee Personal Firewall installed. </s>
<s> Thanks and regards. </s>
<s> While I have a longer discussion I can supply the short question is this. </s>
<s> Did you create your account on that other machine? </s>
<s> Let's say your login is &quot;joe&quot;. </s>
<s> Can you login as joe on all the machines? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I have not created login account perse since I am the sole user on both machines. </s>
<s> However, the login pages on both machines show my abbreviated name as user/administrator. </s>
<s> Best of luck on this. </s>
<s> I know many that revolt at having to use accounts and all that but it's not my rules you have to play with here. </s>
<s> You could enable the guest account but that's dangerous and doubly so over wireless. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I enabled the guest account on both machines and with a persistent tinkering, one of the machines (that with XP-Home Edition) can now access recognize the other (that with XP-Professional) and read/use files but not the other way round. </s>
<s> Any further help from here. </s>
<s> Again, not my rules here. </s>
<s> You can fight with those in Redmond why a share doesn't work if you create the share, enable Guest and it doesn't work. </s>
<s> However if one enabled Guest then created the share it did. </s>
<s> Enabling Guest is a bad thing. </s>
<s> I hope you never experience why. </s>
