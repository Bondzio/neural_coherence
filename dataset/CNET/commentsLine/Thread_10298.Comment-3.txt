the computer was working just fine before i changed the power supply.
i changed the power supply back to the seasonic 550w psu and it still showed &quot;no signal&quot;.
could you clarify or simplify your answer?
you said a cable is touching the fan?
i checked and there aren't any cables touching the graphics card fan... the power supply is also connected to a seagate 5400 rpm hard drive and a samsung 7200 rpm hard drive.
for testing purposes, i only connected the psu to the parts i needed to turn on the computer and turn down the gpu fan because it was too loud, which was when i encountered the &quot;no signal&quot; problem.
