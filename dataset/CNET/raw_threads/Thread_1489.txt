Plainly put, most users are gamers or for some reason find the absolute video top-end will make their world better. For typical user though you'll be happy with a singular video card, the best you can afford. Understand also, that using SLI/Crossfire will also require better psu installed and a capable mtrbd. that's not the cheapest out there for best performance match. use the link Robert provided, good luck. tada -----Willy

Don't expect leaps and bounds with 8600GT SLi. Getting a single 8800GT (OC or not) would be better. If you really want dual gpu, you could try 9800GX2 which is ridiculously priced or the humble HD3870 X2. both have 2 gpus in one PCB so it means you can use your old board but getting an sli or xfire solution. hth
