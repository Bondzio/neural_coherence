I realize that 128mb of that is shared video ram, so I just ordered 2x512 corsair value select ram from Newegg. I read on another topic that it is suggested that the original ram be put in the current empty slots and the newer, larger ram be moved to the first 2 slots. Can anyone help me out and tell me if this is true and why it is true??

Why, because when used it has more immediate access to ram w/o leaving for the next ram address segments and electrical considerations. It all gets used in a round about way, but if it doesn't work, then of course install what works best. tada -----Willy
