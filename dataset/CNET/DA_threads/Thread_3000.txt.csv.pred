1.1.1	I bought a new cheap X-Link Internal 56K Modem.	St
1.1.2	I put it in the PCI slot, I adjusted the volume to the max, then dialed.	St
1.1.3	But whalla, no sound.	St
1.1.4	I figured out that the new modem has no speaker compare to my old one.	St
1.1.5	I just want to know if there are any way to hear the sound of dialing by using my own PC Speaker (since the modem don't have speaker, so I think using the PC Speaker is possible).	St
1.1.6	If it's possible kindly tell me how to do it.	St
1.1.7	I know this is possible because there are some computers that I know that when it dials, the sound comes through the PC Speaker itself.	St
1.2.1	It's also possible to cut costs, there is no speaker.	St
1.2.2	Since there are some zillion modems out there, unless I could see the modem or a web site with details about the modem, there is no hope to connect some sound from the modem to your sound card with some cable.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	I think you answered you're own question, &quot;a new cheap X-Link Internal 56K Modem&quot;.	St
1.3.2	If it has no speaker then the drivers or the vendors s/w has to route any sound output to the system.	St
1.3.3	The AT cmds.	St
1.3.4	apply to the physical modem and usually not to the system.	St
1.3.5	You need to find some s/w from some 3rd party(I don't know of any) if any as an solution.	St
1.3.6	But since this is new, return to the vendor and get a different one w/speaker.	St
1.3.7	If you haven't already, check the x-link support website for hints/tips in that regard.	St
1.3.8	To be honest, I never heard of x-link brand, but then many a vendor comes along &quot;rebranding&quot; a popular chipset and sell as thier own.	St
1.3.9	That maybe a hint in following the chipset and see if a cure if available.	St
