1.1.1	I have an Intel 915GEV motherboard that appears to be operating normally .	St
1.1.2	It detects some cards just fine , but not my Linksys PCI wireless network adapter .	St
1.1.3	At first I thought the Linksys card was dead , so I returned it and got a new one .	St
1.1.4	Well this one does n't work either .	St
1.1.5	I 've tried it in multiple PCI slots ( including one that I know works for another card ) , and I get nothing .	St
1.1.6	The card does not show up in the device manager , even when I tell it to search for new hardware .	St
1.1.7	The install software wo n't run without the card detected .	St
1.1.8	A ) is there any sort of known problem with these newer Intel boards and Linksys cards ?	Ques
1.1.9	B ) what are the odds that I got two defective cards in a row ? ?	Ques
1.1.10	C ) is there any sort of manual way to force this thing to work without relying on the autodetect ?	Ques
1.2.1	Odds of 2 bad cards , very low .	St
1.2.2	You did use static protection did n't you ?	Ques
1.2.3	If not , then you could have blown the boards , admittedly unlikely , but still possible - especially in winter when the humidity is lower , and less likely to & quot ; bleed off & quot ; the static buildup .	St
1.2.4	Check for BIOS updates for your Motherboard , plug and play may not recognize the board if it came out after the BIOS ( for configuration purposes ) .	St
1.2.5	However , I 'm reasonably certain that it should show up in the PCI scan that flashes by late in the boot sequence .	St
1.2.6	There can be voltage compatibility problems in the PCI bus .	St
1.2.7	Older PCI boards used +5 volts , newer ones use +3.3v .	St
1.2.8	( some will auto sense , and use either ) There is a slot key that prevents plugging in the & quot ; wrong & quot ; board , but since it was a late breaking add-on I 'm believe that it wo n't prevent all cases of incorrect installation .	St
1.2.9	Likewise for the 66Mhz key .	St
1.3.1	interesting ideas .	Polite
1.3.2	I tried updating the bios .	St
1.3.3	Did n't help , but probably good thing to have done anyway .	St
1.3.4	The card wants 3.3V , but I ca n't find a spec on what voltage the PCI bus is trying to source .	St
1.3.5	How can I tell ?	Ques
1.3.6	I went through Intel 's web site and literature with no luck ... can you tell by looking at the board ? ? ?	Ques
1.3.7	?	Ques
1.4.1	I 'm afraid my concern about voltages was a red herring in this case .	St
1.4.2	It 's a new MotherBoard , so it certainly should provide 3.3v , and you said thats what the card wants , therefore voltage is probably not the problem .	St
1.4.3	Of course , if all your other PCI boards used +5 ...	St
1.4.4	But I would n't chase it very hard .	St
1.4.5	Sorry , but I 'm out of ideas .	St
1.4.6	You do n't have another system to try it in do you ?	Ques
1.5.1	Ok ya know whats crazy ?	Ques
1.5.2	I 'm having the same problem ...	St
1.5.3	I have an old Aptiva though PII 350 512megs of ram , 40 gig running Windows XP PRo .	St
1.5.4	I 've installed regular NIC 's no problem , but I actully have 4 different kinds of Wireless NIC 's ( I 'm a PC TECH ) And the PC/WINXP wo n't detect ANY of them !	St
1.5.5	It picks up all the regular NIC 's no problem , but when it comes to the wireless ... forget about it !	St
1.5.6	I 'm lost ...	St
1.5.7	I 'm updating BIOS now , if that does n't work i 'm out of Idea 's !	St
1.6.1	I quit .	St
1.6.2	I returned the card to the retailer ( Thanks again Dell for your forgiving return policy ! ) .	St
1.6.3	I 'm planning on taking it into my local PC repair joint and make them put in a card .	St
1.6.4	I tried updating bios , by the way .	St
1.6.5	I got nuthin .	St
