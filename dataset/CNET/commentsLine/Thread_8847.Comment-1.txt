this is the config i have selected based on my budget.
intel pentium 3.2 intel 945 g chipset board memmory:-corsair or transcend 2gb 533 mhz ddr-2 hdd 160 gb seagate monitor 17'inch flat crt samsung 793s lite-on sohw-1673s dvd writer atx cabinet with 400 watts smps altec lansing atp3 speakers geforce 6800 gs 256mb pci-e card tv tuner card: - play tv @p7000 ( internal ) pixel view ( suggest a better card under 100 $ ) i want this computer for gaming (play all latest games at decent resolution) and also wanna use this as a media center pc.
i will be using windows xp with mce 2005 and then switching over to vista when it arrives.
since i will be using my computer for watching/recording tv i want a system that doesn't make any noise.
can someone here tell me whether the p4 chip or the graphics card make a lot of noise and if so is there any way to reduce it????
noise during gameplay is okay though.only wanna keep noise down while watching/recording tv.
this is the first time i am building a new computer.please let me know of any combatibility issues or what should be changed .
also is it better to build or buy a media center system that can play games?
also please state whether this config would be enough for vista.
also does it make any difference whether i use 400 mhz or 677 mhz ram on my pc?
?
