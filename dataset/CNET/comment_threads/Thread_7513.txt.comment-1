Lets say I have to Remote Desktop to a computer that my friend owns via the internet.
Now of course to connect to his whole network I would have to know the IP address that is given to him by his ISP, but then how do I tell his router which uses NAT with DHCP to hand out class C (192.168) addresses, to connect me to that particular computer.
