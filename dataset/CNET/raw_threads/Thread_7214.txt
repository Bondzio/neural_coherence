I just bought another PC and want to use the same (one) cable provider. When I called them, they said I woudl need to pay them the full fee for the second cable modem... My question, why can't I just purchase a cable modem and hook it up to the coaxial wall outlet in the room I want to use the PC? Do I have to really tell my cable company? Thanks, Novice-Luis

No need to pay for a second IP address, and plugging another cable modem into the wall jack will not work unless you pay for another account. The routers the cheaper solution.
