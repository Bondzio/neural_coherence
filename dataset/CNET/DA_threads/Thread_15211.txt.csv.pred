1.2.1	http://www.3cbsi.com/products/en_US/detail.jsp?tab=prodspec&sku=3CRWDR100A-72&pathtype=purchase notes that it does have &quot;event logging.&quot; I see a manual is included so you'll have to dive in and see how and if the events you want logged, logged.	St
1.2.2	-&gt; About syslog.	St
1.2.3	google.com has much information about such.	St
1.2.4	But in one line, syslog is much like a program that accepts syslog messages and records them for you to look at later.	St
1.2.5	This is not an offer to solve your issues or write what you need to know in this small space.	St
1.2.6	However I will note the information where it is and how to find it.	St
1.2.7	Fishing lessons are free, but no fish.	St
1.2.8	Bob	St
1.3.1	the device manuals arent exactly manuals but two A6 pieces of folded paper ,and not much help they give you a 3cbsi.com link to goto for support(buggers even folded it so you cant use it straight out of the pack as toilet paper) , not registered with anyone , so i dont think ive got support, is it worth it?	St
1.3.2	i found some good online pages even some with screen shots of the web interface and tutorials on how to do certain things.	St
1.3.3	portforwarding.com was 1 , but not yet come accross anything that deals with event logging posting on here i was hoping someone may have the same router and might know how to do it .	St
1.4.1	You didn't tell much about where the syslog (logging) program was to run.	St
1.4.2	If you have a linux box, then it's just part of the package.	St
1.4.3	Please tell more.	Sug
1.4.4	-&gt; http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=windows+syslog finds syslog for windows.	St
