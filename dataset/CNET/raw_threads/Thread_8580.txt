I only use my computer for school and, more power hungry, video editing. I'm told my processor is already super fast for what I do and most apps are geared toward only duel cores anyway. All that aside, however, I do have a weakness for the latest greatest stuff. If I did get the core 2 extreme with a 1600Mhz FSB, I would have to get a new motherboard. How much of an increase in performance would I be looking at if I went with an Intel Core 2 Extreme of only 1333Mhz FSB, but still 3.0Ghz instead of the 1600Mhz FSB?

That is 3/2.66 or 12.8% faster. However since it's not in the right motherboard all bets are off and it may not even boot.
