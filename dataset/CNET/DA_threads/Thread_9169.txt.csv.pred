1.1.1	I have an AMD X2 4400 in a Thermaltake Xaser III V2000A aluminum case with an Asus A8N-SLI motherboard .	St
1.1.2	I have an AMD certified Opteron/64/FX heatsink fan ( it was inexpensive ) and currently idle at a temp 40-47C .	St
1.1.3	My warning goes off when it reaches 60.8C .	St
1.1.4	When I play some games , such as Call of Duty 2 , I reach the warning temp and I shut the comp off .	St
1.1.5	Would a better heatsink fan eliminate this and reduce idle temp ?	Ques
1.1.6	If so , which one do you recomend ?	Ques
1.1.7	This doesnt happen often and the case has 7 fans .	St
1.2.1	What 's the ambient temp in the room where the PCs located ?	Ques
1.2.2	Re a better HS FANs ... .lots of options ... .take a look over at Overclockers.com ... they 've got reviews on lots of aftermarket products you can read about .	St
1.2.3	You could also try removing the stock HS fan and using a more efficient thermal compound..something like Arctic Silver 5 .	Sug
1.3.1	I live in a typical college apartment and its usually 72-75 .	St
1.4.1	the stock HS FAN , clean it up good and reinstall it using some Arctic Silver 5 .	St
1.4.2	They 've got good info on how to apply it .	St
1.4.3	If that does n't do it ... then I 'd spring for the better HS FAN combo to add to that mini-hovercraft .	St
1.4.4	Almost hard to understand how that CPU could be running hot with all those fans unless of course it was n't sitting flush now .	St
1.4.5	Let me know how it works .	St
1.5.1	Out of curiosity , what HSF did your 4400+ come with ?	Ques
1.5.2	The newer ones are being shipped with the HSF that come with the Opteron processors - they 're a 4 copper heatpipe design and there 's an AMD hologram logo/sticker on the top of the fan .	St
1.5.3	Those are quite good for a stock HSF ( I was using one with my Opteron 170 ) and you 'd probably have to spend close to 50 bucks to exceed it 's performance .	St
1.5.4	If you have that , try re-seating it as VAPCMD said , with special care not to put on too much or too little AS5 .	St
1.5.5	If you do n't have that HSF , I wholeheartedly recommend the Zalman CPNS9500 .	St
1.5.6	With room temps in the same range as yours , 100 % load ( running 2 instances of Fold @ Home ) and my Opteron overclocked to 270 , my temps hover between 47 - 52 degrees C. Idle , we 're talking about 32 .	St
1.5.7	The link provided happens to be NewEgg , but if you look around , you may be able to get it for around 50 shipped .	St
1.6.1	I just took a look at your case , and just like my ThermalTake , the Zalman cooler would be blowing the air straight to your exhaust fans and out of the case .	St
1.7.1	I purchased the retail box 4400 with fan .	St
1.8.1	A buddy of mine told me about the Zalman Fatality .	St
1.8.2	Is it any better than the one linked to me ?	Ques
1.8.3	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16835118221	Ques
1.9.1	Different designs and I have n't seen any tests between the two on the same system .	St
1.9.2	The 9500 is simply one of the very best air coolers out there as far as CPU temps go - see this comparison for more info .	St
1.9.3	Again , not only is it extremely efficient at cooling the CPU , but it blows all of that hot air directly out keeping your case temps lower .	St
1.9.4	I 'm sure that the cooler that you linked is great , too , but I would suspect that it falls a little short of the 9500 's performance as far as CPU cooling goes .	St
1.9.5	It may , however , keep some of your other components a little cooler because of fan orientation ( blowing down on the motherboard ) .	St
1.9.6	Two things to consider , though - 1 ) it 's very big in diameter - make sure it 's not going to conflict with other components in your case , 2 ) you 're paying an extra 20 bucks over the 7700 for an additional 400 RPMs and the Fata1ity name .	St
1.9.7	For my money , I obviously felt the 9500 a better choice , although I 'm certain that you 're not going to be disappointed with either .	St
