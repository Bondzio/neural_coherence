I find the geocities/Yahoo to be fairly painless.
But let's be clear here, if the scanner fails on another machine, cost of repair (including shipping) exceeds the cost of a new scanner.
Parts outside of an external USB/Parallel cable or a wall power supply are not obtainable.
Well, lamps are, but not much else.
Bottomline?
Try it on another machine?
