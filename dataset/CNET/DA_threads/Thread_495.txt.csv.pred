1.1.1	Here take a look at this motherboard http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16813131568 I do n't get it , two PCI slots are in between the two PCI-E x16 slots .	St
1.1.2	How will you be able to use the PCI slots if you have 2 GPUs in SLI if the the SLI bridge will obstruct the access/installation of the PCI slots ?	Ques
1.1.3	Or is it that this board does not require the SLI bridge at all ?	Ques
1.2.1	1 .	St
1.2.2	You lose the use of a PCI slot for every PCI Express X16 card inserted .	St
1.2.3	2 .	St
1.2.4	Worst case scenario is that if you go with 2 video cards in SLI , you will be left with one PCI slot and one PCI-E X4 slot .	St
1.2.5	This usually is not a problem for SLI gamers who really only need PCI for a good sound card .	St
1.2.6	Everything else , excpet maybe a dial-up modem , is integrated into the motherboard .	St
1.2.7	If you need more expandability , use the PCI-E X4 slot or external hardware via USB or Firewire .	St
1.3.1	The board comes with a & quot ; soft & quot ; SLI bridge cable that allows you to have a PCI card between the vid cards .	St
1.4.1	When you use SLI on the Asus A8n SLI premium , you do n't lose PCI slots .	St
1.5.1	Definitely worth it if you must have the most SLI bandwidth .	St
1.5.2	Any motherboard with an & quot ; nVidia nForce4 SLI & quot ; chipset runs the two video cards in SLI at 8X speeds .	St
1.5.3	This is the A8N-SLI Premium motherboard .	St
1.5.4	The & quot ; nVidia nForce4 SLI X16 & quot ; chipset motherboards can run both cards at X16 speeds .	St
1.5.5	So the A8N32-SLI Deluxe can have TWICE THE BANDWIDTH in SLI .	St
1.5.6	Whoah ! ! !	St
1.5.7	With regard to losing expansion slots , you will lose one PCI slot and one PCI-E X1 slot on the A8N-SLI Premium if you add beefy video cards or wish to have decent video cooling .	St
1.5.8	The way I see it , it 's pretty much a wash between the two boards with respect to losing expansion slots .	St
1.5.9	IMO , PCI slots are important , but not as critical as they used to be for the typical computer user because dual ethernet , HD controllers , sound , USB 2.0 , Firewire , and other capabilities are integrated into the motherboard .	St
1.5.10	As always , every individual 's needs are different .	St
1.5.11	If you need many expansion slots , by all means go with the motherboard with the lesser chipset .	St
1.5.12	They are both good .	Polite
1.6.1	1 for sound card and basically it , unless maybe some kind of fan control , raid adapter , etc .	St
1.6.2	but most likely only need max of 2 pci slots .	St
1.7.1	and I read that it is pointless now since no game out there takes advantage of & quot ; true dual x16 slots & quot ; .	St
1.7.2	Dual x8 slots are fine now and provide excellent SLI performance at the highest resolutions .	St
1.7.3	I also realized that the 32 delux does not come with onboard firewire , which IMO sucks .	St
1.7.4	I know that you lose PCI slots when doing SLI , but the 32 delux is too expensive , you only have one PCI slot after SLI , and I am reading reviews that it is way too buggy right now .	St
1.8.1	you get no onboard firewire , and one PCI slot for expansion .	St
1.9.1	Personally , I ca n't justify the cost for my uses ( not a high-end gamer ) .	St
1.9.2	I usually do n't consider purchasing such items until there are more models with the new chipset , prices drop , and bugs are worked out ; however , I did notice that many of its bad reviews seem to come from consumers with less hardware experience .	St
1.9.3	Test labs have had success .	St
1.9.4	It definitely is not a novice board .	St
1.10.1	$ 245 is outrageous for a motherboard .	St
1.10.2	I 'm not a gamer but I am curious .	St
1.10.3	Maybe in the future I 'll try an SLI setup .	St
1.10.4	I have always wanted to build a super high-end system for some reason , but I am going to wait until prices drop and newer boards come out with the dual x16 slots .	St
1.10.5	I read a customer review of the board where the guy had to tweak stuff in the bios to get it working properly ; the customer specially mentioned it is not a novice board .	St
1.10.6	I going to wait and let the competiton fight each other .	Sug
