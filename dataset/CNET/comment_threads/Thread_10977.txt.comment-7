the processing capacity (motherboard) is used by all clients.
We all share the motherboards that google has when executing a search.
All you need is a multi-user OS and a way to connect multiple clients.
An average mainframe 15 years ago shared it's processing capacity between 100'ers of simultaneous interactive users.
Windows Vista doesn't really support that.
Windows Server version fare much better, running things like your database (SQL Server), mail (Exchange Server) and documents (Sharepoint server).
