Proffitt	8/25/04 9:56 AM	1.09342776E12	Re: 802.11b vs 802.11g	If you are sharing your connection and need to print or send a file to a PC on your network, then &quot;G&quot; would be great. If not, don't bother. If you are playing online games in which ping times count, then you may have a reason to change. The speed can help. Bob

They don't get used hardly ever at the same time and I print wirelessly to a print server so I am guessing that the printer would not be affected if I change to G. Thanks for the advice I guess I won't bother buying G then.

Where the additional speed might be noticed is if you have additional networked computers, or networked printers, on YOUR side of the DSL modem (again, trying to go through your modem is going to be &quot;bottlenecked&quot; at just that 1.5 Mbps rate). So, perhaps you might experience some benefit if you have a home network, but probably not. It definitely will not help with your internet down or uploads. One more point, I have read some (maybe all) wireless b&g networks suffer if any of your wireless connections are still running at the slower &quot;b&quot; speed. So, if you do an upgrade, and you want to get the most of your upgrade, then ALL of your wireless components must be running at the higher &quot;g&quot; speed. Good luck.
