1.1.1	If I have wireless broadband internet by using a PC card ( Sony Ericsson GC83 or Sierra Wireless AirCard 775 , etc .	St
1.1.2	) in my desktop , can I set up a home network so that I can use the internet wirelessly on my laptop ?	Ques
1.1.3	The laptop has a built-in network card already .	St
1.1.4	How can I set up the network ?	Ques
1.1.5	Windows XP is on both computers .	St
1.1.6	Thanks for your help .	Polite
1.2.1	Sorry MadisonAVE , I 'm not clear on what you 're asking .	St
1.2.2	Do you have two computers that currently have wireless network cards in them ?	Ques
1.2.3	How do they get to the Internet ?	Ques
1.2.4	Who provides your access ?	Ques
1.3.1	The desktop ( Sony W700G all-in-one model ) has the wireless PC card ( T-Mobile Internet service ) and the laptop has the wireless LAN card built in .	St
1.3.2	I want to use the wireless service on the laptop without having to remove the card from the desktop .	St
1.3.3	What kind of router would I need to network the two computers ?	Ques
1.3.4	Thanks .	Polite
1.4.1	I think those cards use EDGE cellular service .	St
1.4.2	You might want to ask your EDGE service provider ( Cingular ? )	Ques
1.4.3	if they recommend a router for those cards .	St
1.4.4	OPTION 1 : The ''Junxion Box '' should get you there , but it is expensive : http : //reviews.cnet.com/Junxion_Box_JB_110B/4505-3319_7-31292890.html ? tag=box http : //www.junxion.com/product/ OPTION 2 ( not sure about this one ) : You are saying that the desktop uses an EDGE card ?	Ques
1.4.5	If so , I do n't know if you can bridge the desktop 's EDGE card to its wired network adapter .	St
1.4.6	If this can be done , you should be able to use Windows XP 's Internet Connection Sharing ( ICS ) .	St
1.4.7	Internet ~ ~ ~ ( EDGE card ) Desktop ( network adapter ) -- -- - wireless router ~ ~ ~ laptop This option just requires the purchasing of an inexpensive wireless router .	St
1.4.8	Again , I 'm not sure about the bridging part .	St
