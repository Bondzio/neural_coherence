i had the same problem occur before christmas where my wireless laptop was connected to my home network but not connecting to the internet.
i had to do the following: 1) open network connections 2) right click on 'local area connection' and choose 'properties' 3) click on 'advanced' tab 4) uncheck box under 'internet connection sharing' next to 'allow other network users to connect through this computer's internet connection' this resolved the problem since i was able to successfully ping everything.
