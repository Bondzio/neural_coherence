the make and model number of your computer will help us make a better decision on how to help you.
a simple internal hard drive is all you seem to require for now.
a 120 gb drive can be bought for $100 and with rebates bring the cost down to $30!
just watch your weekly ads like best buy, circut city, ect.. internal hard drives are cheaper than external and not that difficult to install.
if you need help just ask this forum, we love to help.
since you are running winxp a memory upgrade can be both cheap (depending on if it is pc133/100 or the newer ddr ram) and very easy to install.
xp is a lot happier with at least 512mb of ram.
again, watch the weekly ads.
as i noted, info on your computer is helpfull so we can steer you in the right direction.
