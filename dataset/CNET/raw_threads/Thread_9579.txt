I have looked at it and it has all kinds of numbers on it, but nothing like the Federal ID number I have been told to look for. It has the name Siemens on it, but I have searched and searched and come up with nothing. Can I just buy another one and install it if I can't figure out where to get the driver for the one currently installed? Thanks for any replies! Michele

Are you looking for drivers because you reinstalled the OS? If so don't forget the motherboard drivers. Hardware devices will not work properly with Windows drivers alone. If you look at the big chipset on the video card, you should be see writing IDing the card.
