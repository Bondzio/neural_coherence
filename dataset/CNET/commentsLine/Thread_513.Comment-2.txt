the external drive should show up in my computer as another drive, e, f or somesuch.
try this, go to my documents, pick out a document, right click on it, a window will appear, one of the items will be send to, click on it, the drive letter (for the external) should be there, click on it, at that point the item should be sent to the drive.
to prove it out, exit docs then go back and open my computer, open (click on) the drive letter for the external and your transferred doc should be there.
once you have that mastered it is easy.
to send items en masse, highlight by holding left mouse button, dragging around and follow same procedure, right click, send to etc.
good luck!
