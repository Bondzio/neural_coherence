<s> I have three computers. </s>
<s> Two desktops and one laptop. </s>
<s> I have roadrunner cable modem on a desktop on the second floor of my home. </s>
<s> I have a desktop in the basement of my home and wish to connect the one in the basement to the cable modem. </s>
<s> I also have a laptop (which I don't wish to connect to the modem, but I would like to keep that option open). </s>
<s> How should I do this at the most reasonable cost? </s>
<s> Shoud I just get a wireless router and wireless cards? </s>
<s> Or, should I hard wire the desktops and get a router with both wired/wireless conncctions? </s>
<s> From D-link: DI-614+ wireless router. </s>
<s> DFE-530TX+ NIC in desktop. </s>
<s> DWL-650 wireless NIC for my laptop. </s>
<s> These units will self configure, find each other, and you're off to the races. </s>
<s> The desktop is wired to the router, and the laptop is wireless. </s>
<s> You can get a wireless NIC for the desktop if you want. </s>
