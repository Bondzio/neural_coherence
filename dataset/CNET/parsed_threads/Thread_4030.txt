<s> Im looking for a computer that will run dreamweaver and photoshop. </s>
<s> Any sugestions on processor speed, necessary RAM? </s>
<s> http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/photoshop/systemreqs/ It seems very hard to get a new machine with 1GB RAM today and the other requirements seem far below your average PC. </s>
<s> What you want to avoid is getting a very high end machine for the web designer since they might make a site that would work fine on that but not for folk that visit the site. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The requirements says &quot; 1024x768 display (1280x800 recommended) with qualified hardware-accelerated OpenGL graphics card, 16-bit color, and 256MB of VRAM&quot; This is the computer i am looking at Acer? </s>
<s> AM3900-U3042 Desktop, Intel? </s>
<s> Pentium? </s>
<s> Processor E6700, 6GB Memory, 1TB Hard Drive Windows 7 Home Premium. </s>
<s> I don't know much about media cards. </s>
<s> Is it alright to say that this computer would work perfectly fine for running dreameaver? </s>
<s> That's all of 65232 colors and that Acer is 24 bit color. </s>
<s> That was beat by 8 bits! </s>
<s> &quot;OpenGL* 2.0. </s>
<s> Intel GMA X4500HD&quot; is just a snippet from intel.com so we're met that requirement as well. </s>
<s> -&gt; NO ONE will write it will be &quot;perfectly fine&quot; but it should be fine. </s>
