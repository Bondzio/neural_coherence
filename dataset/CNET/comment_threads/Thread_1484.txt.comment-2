It doesn't surprise me that some items from eBay are hosed or less than expected.
It has become the dumping ground not only for possible bad parts but any real cheap ones as well, even if they aren't they don't work for long.
One reason I hesitate to buy from eBay unless I deal with a trusted vendor.
Also, some brand names come and go with the source being probably the same Pacific Rim manufacturer.
If you really want to trust your data to a flash drive then buy from a reliable source.
Also, if you check the forum here, notice that flash drives aren't permanent storage and should be thought of as a working storage media.
If you can return those flash drives back to the eBay vendor.
Yeah, Wal-Mart and other vendors you know will do better even if you have to wait for a sale, jump on one.
