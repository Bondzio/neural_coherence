I have a XPS Gen 4.
I have one gig of ram memory (250 hard drive) and since my son has lots of games on it I'd like to purchase more memory.
Of course he says I should buy Geil or Cosair-extreme memory.
Here are two choices I found.
Any advise... Corsair Memory Product Name Value Select 512MB DDR2 SDRAM Memory Technical Information Memory Size 512MB DDR2 SDRAM Number of Modules 2 x 256MB Memory Speed 533MHz DDR2-533/PC2-4200 Module Configuration 32M x 64 Error Checking Non-ECC CAS Latency CL4 Manufacturer PNY Technologies.
