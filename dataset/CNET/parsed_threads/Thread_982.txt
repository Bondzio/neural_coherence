<s> If you can help, I'd sincerely appreciate it.. </s>
<s> I got a worm. </s>
<s> I managed to download Ad-ware 6 and got rid of the worm, but had a corrupt registery file and could not get 'Word' to open. </s>
<s> A computer savy relative changed from Windows ME to Windows 2000, and 'Word' worked, but dispite Ad-ware 6 and McAffee, I got another worm which resulted in a home page of porn advertisement which I could not reset(errant surfing 14 yr old lost computer privledges at this point). </s>
<s> Now the problem.. </s>
<s> I tried to use the recovery function on this out of warranty HP Pavillion pentium 3, 128 mb ram desktop utilizing the provided CD. </s>
<s> 1 It could not find hard drive, 2 Suggested using Fdisk function 3 Fdisk offerred 4 alternatives; only one would work 4 That fuction offered 3 alternatives; only 1 worked 5 I created a partition, 6 reformated 7 recovery disk worked, loaded original Windows ME; worked correctly 8 Tried to install software (printer), but found out I do not have enough disk space. </s>
<s> Now I only have 1.99 GB with 1.79 already used. </s>
<s> Did I seal off the rest of my hard drive disk space? </s>
<s> Can anyone help get it back? </s>
<s> FDISK asked if you wanted to enable large disk support. </s>
<s> You answered no. </s>
<s> You get it back by starting over. </s>
<s> Or if you have Partition Magic, convert to FAT32, then extend it. </s>
<s> But that costs money... Tutorial on FDISK at http://fdisk.radified.com/ </s>
<s> Thank you for the reply. </s>
<s> I started over; creaeted another partition with the rest of my disk, it is now FAT32. </s>
<s> How do I make it my primary? </s>
<s> When I try to delete my first partition I get a message that disk could not be locked? </s>
<s> You should have started over or bought partition magic. </s>
<s> Some only learn this by the path you have taken. </s>
<s> Here's a tutorial on FDISK that may help you understand why you can't just remove the FAT16 partition. </s>
<s> http://fdisk.radified.com/ </s>
<s> I now have a basic understanding, but don't understand why I cannot just ignore my C drive-2 Gb, FAT16, and work from my new D drive- 36 gb, FAT32, with nothing on it.I will go thru the tutorial again, but in the mean time, is there a way I can use the HP Recovery disk, down load to the D drive and use that platform? </s>
<s> In a nutshell, with the pieces of the puzzle you have, you can't &quot;hide&quot; that partition. </s>
<s> Furthermore, the &quot;restore&quot; CDs rarely give the user any option to install on other drives because such an option would cause support costs to rise. </s>
<s> You may have to fix the original issue. </s>

<s> You mentioned a problem with 'primary' acknowledgement? </s>
<s> Manufacturers have different configurations but most have their jumper diagrams on the hard drive: have the jumper(s) on the back of 'both' drives been properly (re)placed on the pins for them to be acknowledged as primary or slave units? </s>
