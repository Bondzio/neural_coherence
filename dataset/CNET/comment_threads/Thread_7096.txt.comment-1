I really like the way my computer is setup, but would like to get more speed from it.
I am running Windows Vista home premium.
I have started a little shot and burn wedding photography business and my AMD 64X2 4200 cpu and 2 gig of ram is a little on the slow side when doing 500 or 600 pictures in Photoshop and would like to speed things up if possible.
If I were to replace the motherboard,CPU and go to duel channel DDR2 memory would I have to format the hard drive and re-install windows Vista, the drivers and everything that goes with it?
I also plan on upgrading the power supply from the 300watt that is in there now to a Antec 550watt.
I have a 7600GS video card, so I think that should be OK for what I am doing.
Price wise it comes out cheaper than buying a new system.
Any advise would be appreciated.
Thanks Wayne
