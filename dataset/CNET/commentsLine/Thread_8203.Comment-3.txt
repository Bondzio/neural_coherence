thanks very much.
i am installing windows vista home premium and i get to the menu 'where do you want to install windows?.
my single samsung hd400ld is not indicated even though it is in seen in bios.
the jumper is set at ab (master) on the hdd, as per leaflet from samsung.
i have checked and changed the power cable and the data ribbon 40 pin cable.
why does windows not see my hdd?
again, any help/advice greatly appreciated.
