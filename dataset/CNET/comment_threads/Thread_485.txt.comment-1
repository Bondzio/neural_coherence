My motherboard is a Gigabyte GA-965P-DS4.
All information about SATA hotswapping is very unclear: Does this motherboard support SATA hotswapping?
That is, does it have the ability to detect if you connect a external harddrive with SATA-II connector, to the SATA port (through an e-SATA connector at the back of my case, that is connected directly to one of the motherboard's SATA ports).
If I try in Linux, nothing happens.
If I try in Windows, nothing happens either.
And if I disconnect it while in Windows, it crashes.
So I assume that either my Linux and Windows will need some drivers to support e-SATA hotswapping, or the motherboard just doesn't support it.
Does anyone know what the deal is, and how I can get it to work?
I can connect the external HD through USB2.0 of course, but SATA is much faster, I want to play games from this HD and still have the ability to disconnect it from my PC and connect it again without rebooting.
