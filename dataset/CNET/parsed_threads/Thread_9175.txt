<s> I purchased a HP PC Media Centre PC that has 1 SATA drive in it, 2 DCD/CDs, and a media card reader. </s>
<s> There is a spot on the motherboard for a serial drive cable, but there are no extra power cables. </s>
<s> On the C drive which is SATA, they have take one of the power cables from a DVD drive and put in a splitter. </s>
<s> The manual that came with this PC shows that you can add another drive on the bottom of the case, so it can be added. </s>
<s> Thanks Doug </s>
