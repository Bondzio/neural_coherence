I am interested in getting an EXTERNAL DVD drive to copy home movies from my camcorder. It is NOT a digital camcorder, it records on 8MM tape. I guess this is 'analog'? I want to do a little editing, nothing fancy. Is there a DVD drive out there with software for creating DVD's. I run XP and have Nero Burning Rom v5.5.9
