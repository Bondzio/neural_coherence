Hello I got an iMac and I'm looking for an external hard drive that I need.
I don't record or do movies and games.
I've got music, pictures, docs done in excel and word.
I'm not sure what to get: -Portable or Non-portable -what size?
1Tb or less than 1Tb -what brand that is compatible to a Mac?
I appreciate your recommendation or suggestion.
Thanks, jake
