<s> I have been using an external hard drive as my main storage device and keeping the internal for Vista. </s>
<s> Last week the ext. </s>
<s> started losing connection to my PC and eventually dropped out completely at the weekend. </s>
<s> I've tried updating the drivers, a different USB port and a different USB cable and had no luck. </s>
<s> Today I dismantled the ext. </s>
<s> case and connected the HDD unit with a SATA cable. </s>
<s> When I turn on the PC and go into setup the PC lists SATA 1 IDE WD160 bladdy blah (the internal Vista runs on), SATA 3 IDE WD500 etc. </s>
<s> (the ex-external)and SATA 2 which is the DVD-ROM and has nothing to do with anything really. </s>
<s> But if I skip the setup stage I get the message 'Primary slave hard disk error'. </s>
<s> I know that the old IDE drives could be set as master and slave by changing the jumpers and SATA drives don't have this. </s>
<s> But I can't get the second drive to work and really need help. </s>
<s> What am I doing wrong? </s>
<s> So try this instead. </s>
<s> Put it in a new enclosure. </s>
<s> There is no reason for the internal Sata connection to work. </s>
<s> I see no sign that your Vista was installed proper. </s>

<s> With the SATA Cable from inside your Computer you will also need the sata power adapter. </s>
<s> If you did this please forgive me for asking. </s>
<s> Question: when you start your PC with it connected does it spinup (can you hear it or feel it? </s>
<s> If it does then go to start, All Programs, Administrative Tools,Computer Managment, & select Disk Management. </s>
<s> Does your drive apear here? </s>
<s> If not the drive is more than likely dead. </s>
<s> You can take it to a repair shop, and get their opinion. </s>
<s> So time it can be repaired. </s>
<s> I use a program called Spinrite. </s>
<s> It takes along time but it recovers drives and data that other techs say are dead drives. </s>
<s> Hope this helps... </s>
<s> like playing Russian roulette with bullets in every cylinder. </s>
<s> If the drive is dead you're data is toast. </s>
<s> If it's still running, it might work in another HDD enclosure. </s>
