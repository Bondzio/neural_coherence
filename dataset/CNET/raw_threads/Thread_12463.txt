The network at my house worked like this: http://img232.imageshack.us/img232/518/network1hn3.jpg Everything was working fine. Both computers could share files and I could use the Internet using Windows ICS. But yesterday I bough a PCMCIA EVDO card for my Laptop. And since I installed it both computers cannot share files or my Laptop can use the shared Internet connection. http://img63.imageshack.us/img63/583/network2fs3.jpg The computers can &quot;see&quot; each other, but when I try to see the files from one computer the system says the PC is unreachable. Even the shared connection appears on the Laptop, but when I try to use IE or Firefox they say you can't connect. Is there a way to fix this? I'd like to know if there is a way my Network could work like this: 1 - PC uses the ADSL broadband connection 2 - Laptop uses PCMCIA card when not in the local Network 3 - Laptop uses ADSL shared broadband connection when in the local Network 4 - Laptop and PC shar files Thanks in advance!!!!!

If EVDO were your primary Internet connection it could be shared by an EVDO router. The only way it could connect to a LAN would be by VPN.
