<s> Hope someone out there can help. </s>
<s> OS is Windows XP. </s>
<s> 1.8GHz AMD Athlon(a few yrs old), 512MB RAM, 40Gb Hard drive. </s>
<s> PC was working fine the other night and simply decided to restart on it's own(no ''obvious'' surge). </s>
<s> As it restarted and went thru POST got stuck during windows loading. </s>
<s> Since then doesn't even get that far. </s>
<s> At one time got about 4 series of 8 short beeps. </s>
<s> Checked beep codes. </s>
<s> Tried different monitor, different video card. </s>
<s> Tower lights are on, CPU fan running, PSU fan running, monitor light blinking, keyboard lights on. </s>
<s> Was going to try swapping the PSU, but could PSU be faulty even if fan running? </s>
<s> Should I swap PSU, change CMOS battery, or am I way out in Left field?? </s>
<s> Hard drive seems to be running, just nothing getting to monitor anymore? </s>
<s> Again monitor light is &quot;blinking&quot;. </s>
<s> Hooked my son's PC to my monitor and monitor works fine. </s>
<s> Other working video card did not work. </s>
<s> Is my hard drive fried? </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Thanx. </s>
<s> Since my posting I have changed the battery and no results. </s>
<s> Didn't make any difference. </s>
<s> Is it the video card slot ie-the motherboard? </s>
<s> Help. </s>
<s> Thanx. </s>
<s> Well, I tried to swap Hard drives. </s>
<s> I guess neither one &quot;hummed&quot;. </s>
<s> ?Motherboard? </s>
<s> I tried to check capacitors but didn't see anything suspicious. </s>
<s> However, I probably wouldn't know the difference anyway. </s>
<s> Would appreciate some feedback. </s>
<s> Next step-Take it in to the shop. </s>
<s> Thanx. </s>
<s> that if you want help, someone will need a complete description of you system. </s>
<s> HP makes many different configurations and you did say it is a few years old. </s>
<s> Will need processor, motherboard info etc. </s>
<s> Model number of the system would help if you don't know the above:) </s>
<s> I got a used computer from a relitive. </s>
<s> They said the computer was off and there was a storm. </s>
<s> They heard a loud crack from the computer. </s>
<s> The next day, when an attempted power-on was done, the power light did not come on, and there was no image on the monitor. </s>
<s> I got it to work on. </s>
<s> I wasn't sure what was wrong, so I stripped out all the PCI cards (modem, sound card, etc. </s>
<s> )and I turned it on and it worked. </s>
<s> I suggust you try taking out the PCI cards. </s>
<s> Thanx for your reply. </s>
<s> I don't have an HP. </s>
<s> My PC was built in local shop. </s>
<s> Has AMD Athlon 1.8GHz processor. </s>
<s> WinXP Home, 512MB RAM; Don't know what MOBO it has or where to find Model#. </s>
<s> Tried removing all PCI Cards as someone else suggested, but no results. </s>
<s> Any other suggestions. </s>
<s> I didn't really want to pay over a hundred bucks just to have it looked at by local Circuit City or Best Buy. </s>
<s> Thanx. </s>
<s> Thanx for your help. </s>
<s> Tried removing all PCI cards and didn't help. </s>
<s> Any other ideas are appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanx. </s>
<s> Try downloading Belarc Advisor. </s>
<s> It should give you a full description of your hardware and software...and it stays local! </s>
<s> Thanx again. </s>
<s> I actually did have Belarc Advisor but that doesn't help now because I can't even get windows to open to access it. </s>
<s> I actually think my Hard Drive is the problem and I committed the ultimate sin-that's right-I didn't back up. </s>
<s> Live and learn. </s>
<s> Hope that's not it. </s>
<s> Any other ideas will be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanx. </s>
<s> Try removing the hard drive and just booting to BIOS. </s>
<s> If you still don;t see anything, then your videocard may be toast or whatnot. </s>
<s> Tried swapping hard drive. </s>
<s> Didn't matter. </s>
<s> But thanks anyway. </s>
<s> I finally had someone look at it and there were some blown capacitors that fried the processor. </s>
<s> So, getting a new motherboard and processor. </s>
<s> Thank God it wasn't my Hard drive. </s>
