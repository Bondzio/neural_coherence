alright this is pretty weird (to me): i'm on the computer and the screen goes black.
i can hear the computer still running, though it's much quieter than normal.
i open it up, turn it back on, and see that none of fans (chipset, cpu, cooling) plugged into the motherboard's fan headers are spinning.
the motherboards's led light still turns on and the hard drives still spin when i turn it on, so i know it's nothing to do with the power supply (it's less than a month old anyway).
i tried plugging the fans into the power supply, bypassing the mobo, using an adapter like this:  when i did this, the fans all began working again, but the computer still wouldn't boot.
the led lights would start, and the hard drives would spin, but no post beeps would sound.
is my mobo trash?
