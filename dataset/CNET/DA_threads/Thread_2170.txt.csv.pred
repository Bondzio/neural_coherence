1.1.1	I have a cheapie homemade PC from a kit from CompUSA , it 's an ASUS M2N-SLI MoBo with an AMD Phenom processor .	St
1.1.2	It runs XP Pro , I use it to run older utility programs that wo n't run on Win7 .	St
1.1.3	The other day it hung up while browsing , so I had to shut down and restart .	St
1.1.4	Darn thing would n't come back on ; no lights , no fans , nothing .	St
1.1.5	I replaced the ATX power supply , and at least I saw lights and fans , and the hard drive was clearly running , but it still would n't boot .	St
1.1.6	The fan on the processor seemed to run kinda slow , but that may be normal on cool startup .	St
1.1.7	I also removed all plug-in boards , including memory , to make sure there was n't something among them that was causing an issue .	St
1.1.8	No dice .	St
1.1.9	So it seems my next step would be to either get a new MoBo or a new processor .	St
1.1.10	But is there any way I can tell which is bad , so it wo n't be hit-or-miss ?	Ques
1.1.11	Thanks for any help .	St
1.2.1	You need to minimize the system to basics and see if it will run .	St
1.2.2	Here , if possible try components elsewhere to test them .	St
1.2.3	There is no easy or magic fix , as sometimes it boils down to just that , testing .	St
1.2.4	Also , I 've found , when tested solo or elsewhere , things work , but once put together again , it fails .	St
1.2.5	Usually , it boils down to the mtrbd .	St
1.2.6	and there 's really no test for it other than installing all new ( test items ) and see if it works .	St
1.2.7	It appears your PSU went out and it *may* have taken something with it .	St
1.2.8	Since , you have an older system , it maybe better to think new rather than repair , build another system for costs involved maybe more bang for the buck .	St
1.2.9	tada -- -- -Willy	St
