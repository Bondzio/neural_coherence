<s> I was wondering if it's possible to connect an internal hard drive from a PC to a laptop. </s>
<s> Is there some sort of IDE to USB or Firewire connector? </s>
<s> You can connect an internal drive to a laptop, or almost any other computer, by way of a external hard drive mount, which is basically a case that encloses an internal drive and connects to the computer via usb, and some have firewire as well. </s>
<s> Google: 3.5'' external hard drive enclosure TWO MAIN SIZES OF HD: 3.5'' = desktop HD 2.5'' = notebook HD External enclosrues are made for both sizes. </s>
<s> There are models available that will enclose an IDE (PATA) or SATA HD. </s>
<s> Your local computer and electronics stores carry them. </s>
<s> Cheapest prices are usually found online. </s>
<s> Adapters without a case are available as a nice temporary solution. </s>
<s> Example: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16812156101 NOTE: Connecting an external HD to a Windows XP machine via USB 2.0 has a better track record than Firewire. </s>
<s> There are also some models that connect to an external SATA port. </s>
