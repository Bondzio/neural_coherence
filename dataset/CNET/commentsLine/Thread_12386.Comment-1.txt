i have a cdrw lg gce-8481b 40x24x48x that as of today does not want to open when the button is pressed and neither does it open when i right click the drive and hit &quot;eject&quot;.
i thought these things were built to last forever.
i have a pretty decent psu 450 watts, so i would not ping the problem on it.
is it time for a new cdrw unit?
have you guys experienced anything like this?
i would at expect the button to open the drive, even if it did not record or read any disc at all.
