i would buy the 'right one' if i was confident of what that is.
i would also like to find out if it was my mistake for ordering the wrong memory or the retailer has the wrong information on the memory; wikipedia describes dimm ddr2 as being specifically identifiable by a gap 70mm across (which would fit) and not 73mm.
crucial doesn't have the system listed or i would have ordered from them.
the motherboard is ms-7301, which supports up to 2gb ddr2 memory.
i did a bit of research and can't find any information on different pin positions in dimm ddr2 memory, so i am a bit apprehensive about reordering until i find out so the same mistake isn't made; pc5300 ddr2 dimm should be the right memory.
