I recently installed a CDRW in addition to my DVD-ROM drive so I could burn both data and music discs. Yesterday I discovered that only one drive will actually play a music CD when I insert it. Windows Media Player recognizes both drives, but I only get actual audio from the DVD. I opened up my case, and there seem to be three idential ports on my sound card to which the audio cable of the drives can go. I have mix-&-matched cables and ports, and only one of them seems to accept audio input. Is this a normal function, or are my ther ports fragged? Is there a fix? Can I still burn audio CDs in this state? HELP!

A graphic of one is at http://guitarfxsoftware.com/sblive/ The issue for many is they can't find such a mixer to push the amplitude of what input is required or forget to not disable that input. If you don't figure it out, just select which drive you want to play analog audio from and use that. Bob
