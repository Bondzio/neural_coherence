you have two mouse listed?
a gaming one and a laser?
do you really need the intel core 2 extreme?
yes it is best but you pay some 3-400 more for it.
also there is rumor that the prices well drop on all these dual cores sometime in july augs.
if you can wait this same extreme well be around 2-300 from what it sounds like.
