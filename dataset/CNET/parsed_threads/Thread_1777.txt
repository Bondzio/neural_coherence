<s> iMac/0S X 10.6.1/2.66 GHZ Core 2 Duo/4GB 1067MHZ DDR3/640GB HD/ For about 2 months my Epson CX5200 always prints regular horizontal red lines on every sheet of paper, spaced at 1/2 inch vertical intervals. </s>
<s> The horizontal length of these red lines varies, and is equal to the horizontal length of the printed matter on the page. </s>
<s> (ditto in landscape orientation, with the red lines vertical) The red line problem shows up in all cases, even when printing in grayscale. </s>
<s> Nozzle checks are clean and correct (except for the extra red lines) I've changed the magenta printer cartridge. </s>
<s> All cartridges are Epson OEM. </s>
<s> I've downloaded the latest Epson drivers for OS 10.6 </s>
<s> Understand, for Epsons when changing the ink carts changes just that, &quot;INK cart&quot; not the inkjet printhead. </s>
<s> Which is why when a Epson has problems it usually relates to the prthd.. </s>
<s> In such cases, doing a cleaning of several times is required. </s>
<s> Your test results are NOT good if you have red lines appearing. </s>
<s> That also suggests you got a blown ink jet itself or a bad control/IC for that particular inkjet. </s>
<s> This is not a end user fixable(unless you're capable&quot; buy the parts, yada, yada and fix it. </s>
<s> However, for that cost you can buy another one(replacement ptr.). </s>
<s> Further, if you have any warranty, use it. </s>
<s> I leave out any possible s/w glitch but I would think that Epson support offer in FAQ, a link to a fix. </s>
<s> Of course, if you haven't query them for more. </s>
<s> As it is, I don't know of this problem as s/w related, but again Mac systems are different. </s>
