My hardrive is going bad and I have XP home on it and don't like all the junk on the restore disk.
My objective is to install a new hardrive with windows XP only and nothing else.
I plan to install an XP Pro upgrade after doing this.
What is the best way to go about this?
Can I put the existing windows program files on a flash drive and boot the new hardrive with it?
Suggestions please!
