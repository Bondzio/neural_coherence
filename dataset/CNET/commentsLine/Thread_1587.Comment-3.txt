you should load ethereal onto one of your 6 computers and sniff the connection for a wile.
all of that arp traffic and those port scans will be traversing your wireless as well if you do not isolate it with a router.
i sure hope you have software firewalls active on all of those computers.
cinderblocks really are bad for wireless.
your best solution is to install 2 or 3 access points in the house about 80-100 feet apart.
you can use netstumbler to measure signal strength around the house.
