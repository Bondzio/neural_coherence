okay i have an older motherboard (m5saa), it has a socket 7 interface.
i know i know they are ancient and stuff but i refurbish older computer parts and make cheap computers that people can use such as me and my brother and sister.
anyway the motherboard wont respond to any differences in core voltage bus speed or multiplier.
i have also tried different processors.
so it will turn on but no response from the monitor or hd or floppy.
is there a way to fix this problem.
