i've had to reinstall windows 98 on an older machine and now find that my hp 6200c scanner won't work although it was perfect before.
each time i try to start the precision pro software, there's a message that the scanner cannot be found or that it cannot be initalized.
however, everything seems fine when i check the properties in the control panel.
on the hp site there is information about installing 3 specific files to the registry, which i've done.
since the problem persists, i tried their second solution, which is to use regedit version 4.0 or above.
since my machine has an earlier version, following their advice i copied regedit 5.0 from another computer.
unfortunately, it won't run--indicates that a certain dll is missing.
since i don't want to fool around with the registry blindly, i'm stumped.
hp used to have very helpful forums, but i see they are no longer there.
does anyone here have a suggestion?
i'd be very grateful for any help.
