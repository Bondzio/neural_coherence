Just what do you mean by not playing? if you have too much going on it may blog down the IDE Ch. and/or slow it so much it appears as an error. Thus check to disable any bkgrd. running pgms. to release system resources back again. When it comes to CD/DVD type errors is to simply replace it and start from there. The wear&tear of the drive has gotten to a point of failure though not 100% yet. tada -----Willy
