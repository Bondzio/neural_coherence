I tried to find the fan information for the first card's fan, from PNY, but they only list the card specs....
The fan seems good, but I have a little worry.
Caution: cannot be used with Matrox VGA cards and NVIDIA PCX 5xxx series VGA cards That isn't your card, right?
PCX and PCI are different, right?
