<s> Hi, I'm extremely terrible with setting up a wireless network, and was hopin to get some help from someone... here are my specs windows xp SP2 Home P4 3.00GHz 512mb Linksys WMP11 network card D-Link DI-624 router All i want is to have this network secured so that no one except for me and my roomate can have internet access. </s>
<s> I have tried time after time after time to go thru the setups, and customer support calls/emails, and am losing my mind over a fairly simple task here. </s>
<s> any help is greeatly appreciated! </s>
<s> I would use to achieve your goal is: 1) change the default password of the router (so trespassers cannot gain entrance to the router's settings). </s>
<s> 2) change the default SSID of the router (so trespassers do not what type of router you have). </s>
<s> 3) enable MAC filtering and allow only those MAC addresses for your wireless devices. </s>
<s> WEP/WPA is another layer I have yet to find necessary in most home environs. </s>
<s> While WEP and WPA encryption are not impenetrable with time, proper motivation, and expertise, I think the fact that users &quot;see&quot; the wireless network as being &quot;secured&quot; in the list of detected networks does help. </s>
<s> WEP and WPA do require a user to enter a password, so I think that parasite wireless users will try the many &quot;unsecured&quot; networks first. </s>
<s> I recommend using at least one of them for homes that are in close proximity to other homes, condos, apartments, high traffic areas, etc. </s>
<s> you can go for mac address filtering and provide the mac adderess of your and your room mate machines in the mac address filtering table </s>
