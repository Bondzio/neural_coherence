hey I'm new to cnet.
I am looking for something for my pc so I can play my ps2 on my pc monitor.
I have seen VGA boxes like XGA but I am also looking for a new GPU and was thinking of killing 2 birds with one stone and get this... http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814143037 it comes with some VIVO cable and a HDTV cable.
Will this fit my needs?
if they don't what product will?
thanks for any help.
