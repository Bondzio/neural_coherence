Changes to the bios don't keep for these reasons either they're way off(OC'ing?)
or not saved upon exiting the bios area.
If the problem persists, then be sure the bios/CMOS battery is OK, just put in a new one.
A P4 system is a dated system as your post offers no real info, I can suspect you're rebuilding from old parts or re-using some.
Do that and check results.
For more detailed help, post your system specs.
