<s> Hello, I want to build a nice gaming computer, and I have slightly over a grand to spend on parts (not including monitor and operating system, those are covered already). </s>
<s> I have some general computer knowledge, what parts handle what and I have a pretty good idea of where to plug them in. </s>
<s> That being said, when buying parts I'm at a bit of a loss. </s>
<s> I'm not sure when looking at a motherboard for instance, what I need to be looking for. </s>
<s> I think I might could find some high performance parts, but I'm really worried about them being compatible If anyone has ideas on some good compatible parts or possibly tips as to what I could run into as far is incompatibility issues, that would be great. </s>
<s> Thanks, Nicholas </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com has recommendations on these things, and their recommendations have been tested, so you should check there. </s>
<s> If you don't get a combination that's been tested, you're rolling the dice. </s>
<s> They're supposed to all work together, but we know how Murphy loves computers! </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
