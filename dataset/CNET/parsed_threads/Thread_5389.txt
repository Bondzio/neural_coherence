<s> Two of the three Optoma EP720 projectors we run in our training rooms have recently started displaying badly pixelated images, one worse than the other and the third is OK. </s>
<s> I have tried adjusting the resolution of the laptops and the projectors - no joy! </s>
<s> To prove the issue, I finally disconnected the laptop from the projector then restarted it with the laptop still disconnected - the result is that the projected 'image' is still badly pixelated. </s>
<s> To my non-techie brain this shows that the problem is with the projector and not the laptop. </s>
<s> The possible soutions are to either repair or replace the projectors - methinks the latter will be quicker and cheaper and a lot less heartache considering we have three courses starting on Monday!!!! </s>
<s> Any advice would be greatly appreciated!! </s>

<s> If you happen to have a service contract for these projectors, I'd call them first. </s>
<s> If you happen to still have warranty on them, I'd call them also. </s>
<s> If you don't, I'd call the shop where you bought them or Optoma tech support to see what they advice. </s>

<s> Unfortunately, these projectors are a good 5 years + old (outside any warranty). </s>
<s> We've gone for the replacment option as we were up against the wire. </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
