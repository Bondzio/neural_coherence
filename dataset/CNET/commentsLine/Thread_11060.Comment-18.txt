i was running vista 32 bit when it first came out and an old canon printer would work, but the vista wouldn't accept the drivers for it or the software for it.
also an off brand webcam would work, but not the software or drivers for it.
i could use it for yahoo messenger, but no adjustments could be made.
same with the new windows 7 64 bit system.
both would work, but only partially.
