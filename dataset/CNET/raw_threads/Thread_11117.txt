I am only looking to spend about $1000. Please list some of the following components that are quiet: Case Fans CPU Cooler Power Supply Hard Drive (Less than 150 GB) Optical Drive (DVD Burner) And any other parts that make noise that I forgot. And I know there is a weekend project from CNET listing some of these, but that is from about 2 years ago and I figured things have been updated since. Thanks
