<s> Can this be done? </s>
<s> I need to use it for Music. </s>
<s> Can I add something to my WINDOWS ME? </s>
<s> You can pop in a Knoppix CD and it will run Qemu then Linux and while Windows ME is running you could access the NTFS volume. </s>
<s> But the glacial speed would test anyone I know. </s>
<s> So while not impossible the solution is likely too slow for any practical reason. </s>
<s> Why not boot Linux and copy out the files you want to the Windows ME hard disk? </s>
<s> a program like http://www.diskinternals.com/products/ntfs-reader/ It should allow you to copy the contents of the external drive to your local hard disk. </s>
<s> To have better access to the disk, reformat it as FAT32. </s>
