You might want to call Apple to confirm/deny that. I could not find anywhere that specifically stated that the MacBook could not be updated. P

The MacBook Pro has the capability, not turned on when shipped, of using the N protocol. I believe the Airport Extreme base station and the newer iMacs also have the capability to use N but need the firmware update to turn it on. P
