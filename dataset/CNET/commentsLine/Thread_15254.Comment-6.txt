bob thanks for the tips.
my server guy stopped in yesterday.
i was attempting to do what you suggested by changing the ip in the printer, but i was missing the menu item to do that (my wife says i'm blind).
once we did that we put the driver on the server and voila!
we have contact.
i got the printer from ebay and the prior owner apparently had that setting in there.
as usual i learned something from my mistake which is a good thing.
thanks again.
