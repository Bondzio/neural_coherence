thanks for the reply im running my pc on a 32 inch hd tv i normally play games as high as the settings on the game will go with its highest resolution.
so it would be much easy just to upgrade to the 8800 gtx and i should be able to run any game quite ok. just one more question will there ever be needed for me to upgrade to sli or crossfire or are single graphics powerful enough to cope with games in the future meny thanks
