I have an IDE Hard Drive that I wanted to put in to in as a second drive from my old PC. Is there compatibility issues that I don't of? I tried for a good while to get it to see it but it won't. Anyone have a idea. The SATA drive doesn't connect to the traditional IDE port, obviously, so I'm thinking that has something to do with it. I don't know. Can anyone help? Rich

Nowadays we must use PATA and SATA because both are actuall IDE drives as well as ATA drives. The data cable for PATA drives are the 40 pin ribbons. SATA data cable is much smaller. The sytem should see the older drive IF you have it jumpered properly for how it is plugged into the new computer. {Probably need to jumper the drive as Cable Select (CS)].

Check your PC/mobo manual. Also, is it plugged into the power and spinning up? (I've made that simple mistake more than I'd care to admit.)

As far as power, I don't hear it spinning, but the power connector appears to come directly from the power supply.
