x1650pro is just a bit faster than x1600pro but not worthwhile as an upgrade.
in my opinion, you'd need to upgrade to a x1950pro or 7900gs for a noticeable improvement and only a x1950xt or 7950gt (or better) would be worth the cash.
if you're slowing down in certain games, more ram may help depending on the game.
for example, battlefield 2 needs 1.5gb or more for smooth play.
