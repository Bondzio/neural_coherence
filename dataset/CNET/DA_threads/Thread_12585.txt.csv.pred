1.1.1	Hello I am new to this networking thing .	St
1.1.2	First I am on comcast and have my own modem a D-Link DCM 200 this works fine for the one computer , but I need to net work the others I have , soon to be Three .	St
1.1.3	Now I 'll tell a small story .	St
1.1.4	I am now on my third router with no luck yet , the first one was a wired router that would not work with my modem .	St
1.1.5	I think it has to have something to do with comcast because it works on my friends DSL system , the second was a Linksys wired with wireless it was returned after customer service could not figure out what was wrong .	St
1.1.6	The latest one is also brand new and has been to the customer service phone lines .	St
1.1.7	It is a D-Link WBR-1310 I would like to set this up manually since the instant setup just ca n't configure it .	St
1.1.8	Has comcast put some sort of block on my modem that wo n't let it communicate with the router ?	Ques
1.1.9	They ( comcast ) want to sell me their home networking kit .	St
1.1.10	I am running windows xp sp2 .	St
1.1.11	the router will communicate with my computer , the computer will communicate with the modem just not all three at the same time .	St
1.1.12	Everyone I have talked with so far has had me do the power cycle thing , check the cables , swap them out all of that stuff and are you sure you get the internet with your modem ?	Ques
1.1.13	duh ? ?	Ques
1.1.14	Well I know that their is someone out there that has had this problem and knows how to fix it , I hope	St
1.2.1	Comcast and my Dlink di-524 .	St
1.2.2	Maybe it 's a DCM-200 but I looked at the product code with all the bar codes and it shows DCM-202 .	St
1.2.3	Sorry , but nothing in your post gives up the clue why you ca n't get it to work .	St
1.2.4	bob	St
1.3.1	are designed for the DCM-202 , or vica versa .	St
1.3.2	After replacing my -200 with the -202 my speed also went to over 6 Meg down .	St
1.3.3	I 'd swap the modem .	St
1.4.1	Comcast has been using DHCP to assign addressing for a long time .	St
1.4.2	I used to be able to get 3 public addresses if I connected 3 PCs to my switch that was connected to the comcast cable modem .	St
1.4.3	I had a Linksys WRT54g that worked well for a while .	St
1.4.4	I decided to migrate over to my Cisco 831 but could not get the WAN ethernet to come up .	St
1.4.5	I finallt had the idea to shut down the Linksys and then reboot the Cisco .	St
1.4.6	Suddenly the Cisco was working .	St
1.4.7	When I powered up the dlink , it would no longer get a DHCP address .	St
1.4.8	It seems Comcast has found a way to limit users to 1 IP address using DHCP .	St
1.4.9	In a nutshell , every router should work .	St
1.4.10	It is just a matter of the proper config .	St
1.4.11	SKrall	St
1.5.1	I wonder if my problem is related to DHCP address assignmnt as it tells me that it cant get an IP address ? ! ! ! ! ?	Ques
1.5.2	?	Ques
1.6.1	The problem is most likely settings on your router , plus you never said if you were connected wired or not .	St
1.7.1	Try a hard wire connection on your other two pc 's that are not online to see if you can get a connection .	St
1.7.2	If not then you know where the problem is .	Res
1.7.3	Good luck	Polite
1.8.1	Thanks for all the Info .	St
1.8.2	Got new cable modem gateway Router combo now everything works pretty well for now .	St
1.8.3	Had to pick up a Linksys Wireless -G Cable Gateway built in router and wireless all in one .	St
1.8.4	All is fine for now .	St
