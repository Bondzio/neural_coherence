earlier i was using my intel piii 1.0 ghz since jun 2001, 02 years back updated to ee intel processor with 1 gb graphics from n-vidia and 4 gb ram and sata 500gb and vista ultimate, but as i started using full hd monitor so neither monitor supported my old hp3400c(scanner)and lexmark z32 printer nor the os, receently switched over to win 7 ultimate that too failed.
but presenly, i got a new all in one which both way helped my space, headache for upgradation and money at the same time.
so, anyway thanx to microsoft for letting customers upgrade forcibly for their benefit as well microsoft's business.
