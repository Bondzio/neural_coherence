But at the office we are working with porting our app over and the input and output is over wifi and bluetooth so given that connection we can input and output to some thousand things.
How is that possible?
It's over wifi and talks to industrial controllers so please add more to your question.
In parting because of the office projects I have quite a few android tablets on hand.
The Asus Transformer with it's keyboard dock almost is a netbook in it's own right.
