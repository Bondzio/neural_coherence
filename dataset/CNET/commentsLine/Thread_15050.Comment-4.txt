you may be using a virtual memory operating system (os).
linux, windows, macosx should use every scrap of ram since ram wins on speed compared to disk access.
when more ram is needed, it's freed or something is swapped out.
the concept of &quot;free memory&quot; is something you worried about in non-vm oses such as dos.
