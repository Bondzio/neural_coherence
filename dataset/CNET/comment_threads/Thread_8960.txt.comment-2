but the BIOS was probably setup so that it was seen as the A drive [possibly], which is normally a floppy drive on the floppy controller as oppised to the IDE controller.
This was probably done in the BIOS by disabling the normal floppy.
Look in your BIOS to see if the floppy is enabled and set to be a 1.44 MB drive.
