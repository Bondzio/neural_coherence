The user manual doesn't contain pairing code. (The serial number or the MAC address doesn't work! The manufacturer's WEB page also doesn't work: www.nortekonline.com ) I've tried the following codes: BT500 NORTEK 1A N44066-00054 (serial number) N44066-000541A (serial number end two past char at the box) 0000 00000 00054 44066 N44066 0003C9 72BA1C (MAC address) 0003C9 72BA1C 0003C972BA1C 12345 ADMIN etc. Any idea? Thanks, Sandorh

If that was not the correct answer then you should have said that that code wasn't working for you. Me? I author some apps that use BlueTooth so I know a little about this. But for a specific device like this you go back to the maker if the usual codes fail and there is no manual. And if the product is defective (no manual is a defective) we know to toss it and get something better. And then we have those no code pairing systems. That would send the person who believes there is a code in a forever search for that non-existent paring code! Bob

Thank you for the answer, but your advice does not work. Ok, I am understand your logical answer. But... This equipment was very cheap and offered a god solution for obsolete only-USB-port printers to make them network printers. The manufacturer WEB page does not work, so I am not able to give help from support team. I can send back this equipment to dealer, but I want to solve this problem. The manual is complete and correct, but does not contain any information about bluetooth paring code. So, you are right, maybe I drop this device into dust-bin. ('Thank you for your time'), Bye: Sandorh

Here's an example in case you didn't know. -&gt; https://www.google.com/search?q=non-passworded+bluetooth+devices This again throws folk for a loop. I don't expect you to know all the ins and outs of BlueTooth but as you can imagine, this can stump those that didn't know. Bob

I can scan the user manual, and I can send it for you. How can I send them for you? Sandorh

But it's quite odd you are writing the word &quot;installation&quot; now. Your posts were asking about &quot;pairing.&quot; One thing is not the other. Bob

I connect bluetooth printer server via USB cable to hp960c 4. I switch on hp960c an BT 500 5. I search the bluetooth device with 'Add bluetooth device' option on my PC (XP) 6. The bluetooth utility found the BT 500 7. The bluetooth utility give the code for pairing BT 500 8. The empty code does'nt work 9. What is the right code for BT 500?
