i ended up buying a cavalry 32gb(casd00032mis) from amazon.
it has great review plus a usb port in case i want to use it as a portable.. http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=amb_link_6488902_20?ie=UTF8&node=541966&keywords=Solid%2BState%2BHard%2BDrive&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=left-1&pf_rd_r=138W4ER4SC6ATEJ74WPX&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=473285071&pf_rd_i=193870011 i figure that if this low cap one works out well, i'll try something higher capacity like the cavalry 64gb or 128gb ssds.
if not, i'll try another brand until i find something good.
i'll keep everyone posted on my experience *crosses fingers*.
