<s> The other day, my curious two year grandson, decide to touch my computer. </s>
<s> He was quicker than I could catch him and I never really saw what he pushed. </s>
<s> Whatever he did, the cd tray slide out and it just kept sliding in and out. </s>
<s> I rebooted the computer and it still continued to do the same thing. </s>
<s> I've shut down numerous times since then but the tray either stays open or slides in and out. </s>
<s> If you leave it out, for the most part it will stay that way. </s>
<s> But if you attempt to shut it...it goes back to opening and closing until you stand it anymore. </s>
<s> Any ideas what he did and how to fix it. </s>
<s> Thanks so much. </s>
<s> http://www.daniweb.com/techtalkforums/thread2840.html Scroll down a little bit. </s>
<s> A bad spring in the button was a suggestion. </s>
<s> Kid prob pulled it funny with his/her nail. </s>
<s> Pushed in so far that it is sticking and pressed against the contacts to open/close the drawer. </s>
<s> try tapping the button, if no go, You may need to change out the CD drive. </s>
<s> Thanks I'll take a look at the link and do what has been suggested. </s>
<s> Hmmm..if I need to buy a new drive, it's coming out of his piggy bank. </s>
<s> lol! </s>
