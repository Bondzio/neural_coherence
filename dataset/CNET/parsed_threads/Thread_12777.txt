<s> My computer is a dumbbutt. </s>
<s> It stopped working in multiple ways, eventually decided to gut it and replace certain parts. </s>
<s> I ran into a problem, I realized I didn't know what kind of CPU I have. </s>
<s> I opened it up, and also realized I didn't know how to know. </s>
<s> Basically, visually, what CPU do I have? </s>
<s> Pics attached. </s>
<s> Ill be so thankful...

<s> I'd google those but your picture is unclear so you can do that. </s>
<s> It looks like the usual socket 775 CPU so on the used market about 20 bucks for most models. </s>
<s> Not a good thing to keep around. </s>

<s> What motherboard was this CPU installed in? </s>
<s> If we can find that out, we can narrow it down to at least a family of CPUs. </s>
<s> In the future, run the Belarc Advisor on any new computer before things can go wrong. </s>
<s> off the heat spreader and all the CPU markings will appear. </s>
<s> Be careful not to bend the PINs. </s>

<s> All the posters clearly hit on what you need to do. </s>
<s> The stock number on the CPu will ID which one it is after cleaning it up to reveal the number. </s>
<s> Check the mtrbd. </s>
<s> itself to see its ID marking to understand what if any other CPu can replace the current one if you plan to upgrade that setup. </s>
<s> etc.. </s>
<s> The specs of the mtrbd will help provided it still is working and you fix whatever problem got you in these straits. </s>
