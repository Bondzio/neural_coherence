<s> I'm going to be moving into an apartment in a month or so, which gives me about that much time to decide on some networking solutions. </s>
<s> I'm a fairly knowledgable computer science student so feel free to speak on whatever level you'd like. </s>
<s> I need to choose a wireless router, with a minimum of the 802.11n standard, as if you can find many without it. </s>
<s> I'd prefer n300 or faster. </s>
<s> I'd like this router with a usb port, and preferably gigabit ethernet ports. </s>
<s> I was wondering whether it would be worth it to splurge on a nicer router for the future of a possibly larger house, possibly even equipped to handle 802.11ac, or whether I should stick with a lower end router. </s>
<s> I don't currently own any -ac equipped devices but I'm sure I will in the future. </s>
<s> Either way you choose, any specific router recommendations would be lovely. </s>
<s> I'd like not to break the bank either. </s>
<s> I just want quality hardware. </s>
<s> Oh, and most of the devices I run are Apple, but I don't need an apple router unless that's legitimately what you recommend. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> When my old router started giving me problems. </s>
<s> I bought a Netgear R6200 which is a AC router even though I don't have any AC devices right now. </s>
<s> Am sure I will have later on. </s>
<s> The 6200 does have 4 gigabit Ethernet ports as well as a USB port. </s>
<s> The range is excellent, better than anything I have ever owned. </s>
<s> It streams Netflix to a cheap Samsung wireless Blu-ray player with no buffering and not a flicker from about 60 feet away through 3 walls. </s>
<s> I have 2 wired and 4 wireless units on it and when the Grandkids come over add 2 more and it doesn't seem to slow it down a bit. </s>
<s> The only knock I have seen on the router is it's size. </s>
<s> It is big compared to other routers, 10 inches wide, 8.4 inches high and almost 3 inches deep with stand. </s>
<s> It runs very cool so no worry's about over heating like a lot of them I have read about. </s>
<s> They are a little pricy, about $150.00 or a little less. </s>
