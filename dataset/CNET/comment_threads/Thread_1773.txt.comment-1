i have a pentium 4 build from scratch, i'm using a intel motherboard model D865GLCL at a bus speed of 400mhz.
I notice in a catalog from tiger direct.com that my mother board can go up to 800mhz.
I want to know how i can boost it up and do it my self.
Please help, thanks cnet's best visitor bigfoot
