as for the psu calculator, i did use it, it gave me around 700W psu.
for the BIOS on the computer, i would like to know more about them.
I am looking online.
also, im considering a diff cpu cooler, ant idea's?
i've, lookedn at a bunch and they are huge.
i prefer a tower/heatpipe design but am afraid of space, and weight issues.
should i be worried about the weight?
looking at the TT 120 extreme.
