having bought many computers i decided to give a hp pavillion a try and have been very disappointed with it.
from the very begining i was misled not being informed that the pavillion a1310n i bought came with no operating system cd's and they will not provide them.
i have software that hp preinstalls with the operating system that can not be totaly removed.
i have gone through the add/remove programs to uninstall the garbage but some such as norton keep coming back with popups telling me to update.
i have pleaded with hp reps. for a os cd so i can have a clean install to no avail.
i have since bought a dell and will recomend people don't buy a hp for the reasons stated.
they do not have the policy that the customer is always right and even agree that my complaints are valid but will not rectify the problem.
i will tell everyone looking to buy to pass on hp
