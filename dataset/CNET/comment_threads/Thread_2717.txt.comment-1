Base precessor is Intel Pentium 4 519 (P) 3.06 GHz .
533 MHz front side bus .
socket 775 Chipset is an Intel 915GV Memory installed 512 MB (2 x 256) DIMMS Maximum allowed 4 GB Speed Supported PC2 3200 MB/sec Type 240 pin DDR2 SDRAM DIMM Slots 4 Open DIMM Slots 2 I want to upgrade my memory to at least 2G and will use the two available slots for the new memory.
That will give me 2.5G (approx) memory.
My question has to do with the available 1G memory that I have been able to locate which has the following features.
Memory Size 1024MB Memory Speed 533 MHz PC4200 Memory Type DDR2 Pins 240 Can my system accept and operate efficiently with the 1G PC 4200??
