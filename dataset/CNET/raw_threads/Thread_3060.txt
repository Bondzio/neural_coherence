I am using an old microphone, but I know it is still a good mic because it works fine on my laptop, but is too quiet to be of any use on my desktop. The sound card I am using is the card built into my motherboard, which is an MSI motherboard. The driver it uses is is the Realtek AC'97 Audio driver. Here is a quick list of everything I have tried: 1. The mic is plugged into the correct input. I know this because the microphone does give me a little input, but it's too quiet to be useful. 2. I turned on the 20 dB Mic boost in the advanced microphone volume. 3. After this I turned the Microphone volume all the way up under volume control, and tried recording. This is the first time I could hear the recording, but I have to turn the speakers up all the way to hear it. Also, the microphone volume shouldn't have to be all the way up. On my laptop I usually have it around 50%-70% of the max volume. Obviously it isn't being boosted enough. 4. To try to improve this, I reinstalled the Audio driver, and that didn't help. 5. I tried changing settings on the Sound effects manager that comes with the audio driver, and nothing there helped. 6. I tried changing settings on the audio recording programs I was using, and neither the standard Windows Sound Recorder nor Audacity had settings I could change to boost input. 7. I tried reinstalling Audacity, and that didn't help. All the other forums have said that if those steps don't work, then I need to get a new mic, but I know that it isn't the mic that is the problem because it works just fine on my laptop. Is there anything else I haven't tried that would boost the input level? Are there any settings in Audacity that would boost the input while recording? Thanks in advance for any help.
