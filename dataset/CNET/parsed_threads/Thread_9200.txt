<s> My computer was purhcased in 2001, when I received it, I got it preinstalled with Windows 98SE & that is the operating system that gets installed if I use the system restore cd. </s>
<s> However about 8 months back I did a full new installation of Windows XP Home Edition on this computer. </s>
<s> Initially the sound was working fine. </s>
<s> I didn't use the computer the entire summer. </s>
<s> When i switched it on after summer, there was no sound output. </s>
<s> I changed my speakers, checked the wires & everything. </s>
<s> Then I thought maybe it's the driver so I got into the Windows Update website & it showed that I have a newer driver available & I decided maybe that would be the key to this but nope after that I got a yellow exclamation mark next to &quot;C-Media AC97 Audio Device&quot; in device manager. </s>
<s> When I use the driver cd I received with my pc it installs &quot;Soundmax Integrated Digital Audio&quot;. </s>
<s> Why is it different? </s>
<s> Even after installing the Soundmax drivers I am not getting any sound. </s>
<s> I cannot do a rollback of the driver & neither can I go back to a system restore point. </s>
<s> In Add/Remove Programs I have something called C-Media WDM Audio Driver, when I try to uninstall it says it has been uninstalled but seems to say that every single time I uninstall it, after the reboot it still exists & can be uninstalled again & again. </s>
<s> I tried disabling the onboard audio from the BIOS & got the same result. </s>
<s> What is going on? </s>
<s> How can I get my sound back? </s>
<s> Btw I think there might be a lot of different drivers of C-Media AC97 & Soundamax that were installed so, is it cause maybe they all are clashing or something. </s>
<s> How could I completely remove all the sound drivers & then install the driver from the cd? </s>
<s> I've tried uninstalling it from device manager & restarting the computer & letting windows install it, no success in that. </s>
<s> I have a Compaq PC which I know has an ABIT BL30G motherboard, however I cannot get the drivers from the Abit website because this is an OEM motherboard & the Compaq website does not have any new drivers for this pc. </s>
<s> What do I do? </s>
<s> i brought a mother board from friend.but he didn't gave me the drivers or manuales.the mother boards name is bl30g ,also it is a compaq(i only know it from the start up logo).if you can send me your computer name (which i don't now)so i can doawnload driver from the internet. </s>
<s> in your case i also have c-media sound card but my computer detect is as aintel intergrated sound.so it works brillinat.thanx.hope you help me.this is my mail address.Visuddha@gmail.com </s>
<s> Use Belarc Advisor or Everest Home Edition to get the exact motherboard (system board) model number. </s>
<s> Also what is the full model number of the Compaq computer (also may be found with Belarc Advisor)? </s>
<s> You may also benefit from a BIOS update, if available. </s>
