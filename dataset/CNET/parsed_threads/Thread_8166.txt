<s> I see that HP and other manufacturers have government edition printers and the prices for these may be lower. </s>
<s> (example at link below) http://www.provantage.com/scripts/search.dll?QUERY=cp2025dn&Submit.x=0&Submit.y=0 When I compare the two, I see no difference in specs but a difference in price. </s>
<s> Does anyone here know if there are any hardware differences that would make them less suitable for consumer use? </s>
<s> TIA </s>
<s> Well, you wonder why the govt. </s>
<s> model is lower in stock. </s>
<s> The only difference is that the model# have yet different part#'s to ID them. </s>
<s> I can only assume, that because the govt. </s>
<s> is a volume purchaser that is has favored status. </s>
<s> I would also suppose you have to prove you're a govt' buyer beforehand. </s>
<s> I may also assume, that a watermark maybe produced during print as a std. </s>

<s> The site I linked to is out of Akron, Ohio BTW and I've done business with them personally as well as as an adviser (of a sort) to the school where my wife works. </s>
<s> They've been very good and often have lower prices than others including Newegg but do charge tax and shipping. </s>
<s> I don't mind and I do anti up for out of state purchases when I do my Ohio taxes. </s>
<s> In any event, I don't see here that there's anything to say that I must have some sort of government ID and, of course, there are thousands and thousands of government type purchasing offices. </s>
<s> There are sites such as CDWG that cater to government and school systems and I've needed to help work with these as well. </s>
<s> There are some products specifically tailored for educational use and can be offered at discounted prices to volume buyers. </s>
<s> The watermark idea is interesting. </s>
<s> I know I've tried to scan some documents that, although you could not see anything unusual in the original, scanning these would pull out the watermark and disclose that it was a photocopy. </s>
<s> No links offered about TAA but it has something to do with government contracts and something called TAA compliance. </s>
<s> I have found that this may have had something to do with a lawsuit against a major government supplier...that being CDW(G). </s>
<s> I now see that, at the same link I provided in the OP, that HP offers TAA compliant toner cartridges. </s>
<s> These cartridges carry both the &quot;g&quot; suffix and a higher price tag than those not labeled TAA compliant. </s>
<s> You'll see the difference in price in this link but find no difference in the actual product. </s>
<s> Your tax dollars at work. </s>
