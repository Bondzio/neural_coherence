Ok, now that I'm set on AGP, the question arises of power supply.
So if I purchase one of the better 8x AGP cards, I'll probably want to purchase a better power supply, which to me, at the moment, seems like it shouldn't be a problem.
I'm sure I could handle replacing the power supply.
Question: Do I have to consider other compatibility issues with the replaced power supply, or is this an easy replacement?
For example, with a new power supply, will 'component XYZ' now have issues?
Something in this nature, thanks again.
