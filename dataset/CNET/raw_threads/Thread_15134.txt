I am thinking about a better 2.1 system or just get a 5.1 surround sound completely like this Sony one ( http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=7728729&type=product&productCategoryId=pcmcat40200050004&id=1140391964586 ) I want to know what you guys think, which is the best sound and power, and a price under $400.00. My PC is an HP Pavilion a1410n and it has a NVIDIA GeForce 6150 LE graphics card and realtek Hd audio drivers. I would like to know about compatibility issues, connections, what cables, drivers, and i was thinking about buying an lcd tv to transfer the video output on when watching movies. Is that possible with my video card?, and if so how and which one is best for price(preferably under 37in and $1000) Thanks guys.
