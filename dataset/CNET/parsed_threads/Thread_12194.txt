<s> hi, i was wondering if someone can tell me if there is an external hard drive (dual platform data storage...??) </s>
<s> available that can hold and access my pics and videos from both my old pc and my new and therefore growing Mac? </s>
<s> I have a My Passport, but when i try to access my PC pics using my mac, or save my mac pics onto it with the pc pics, it tells me i have to reformat and therefore loose all currently stored data. </s>
<s> any guidance would be appreciated! </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> You'll not only have to format it, but you have to repartion it. </s>
<s> Delete the current partition(s) and make new ones using the FAT(32) file system. </s>
<s> Then fill again from the original or from your backup with all pics and video's you have. </s>
<s> I assume you know that an external HD isn't to be used for STORAGE. </s>
<s> It's too error prone to contain the only copy of your data. </s>
<s> But as a backup or as a means to listen to your Mac music on your PC and view your PC videos on your Mac it's nice. </s>
<s> Having a second or even third copy of everything on that external disk elsewhere also automatically means you won't loose any data when reformatting it. </s>

<s> thanks for the info! </s>
<s> ive never done anything like this before. </s>
<s> is reformatting and partitioning difficult? </s>
<s> and if not on a My Passport type of thing, where is a better place to store all my photos and videos? </s>
<s> thank in advance!...diane </s>
<s> anyone heard of the seagate go flex? </s>
<s> it claims to work with pc and mac interchangeably. </s>
<s> any thoughts? </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> We can format the drive to do the job. </s>
<s> In the case of the go flex they may have formatted it for us. </s>
<s> I wonder if you were unaware of that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> i figured that was the case. </s>
<s> just wondered if anyone had any opinion/experience with it. </s>
<s> and if it saves e $$$ or is a stabler solution, to buy an hd and reformat myself. </s>
<s> but is it difficult or straight forward to reformat myself? </s>

<s> Something every new computer owner should do once. </s>
<s> On an Apple it should be even easier. </s>
<s> The only thing that could make it hard is if one didn't do a little research. </s>

<s> https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1800546?start=0&amp;tstart=0 This starts with formatting then dives off to their real concern which was the PS3. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> i read the link, thank you! </s>
<s> i feel ignorant. </s>
<s> whether because i havent slept since my baby was born 13 months ago, or i misjudged my abilities to do this myself, this info in the link was confusing to me. </s>
<s> does best buy do this for an (astronomical) fee? </s>
<s> I have no ties to said store and they rarely see me as I just get stuff from newegg, amazon and other places. </s>
<s> This is a simple thing to do and once you have your drive, folk can re-write it again if need be. </s>
<s> The format itself was done in the first few posts. </s>
<s> I thought this one was more interesting since they went on to discuss the PS3. </s>
<s> You could stop at that step. </s>
