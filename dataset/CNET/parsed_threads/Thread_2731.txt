<s> I have a really old pentium 233, 160 ram, pcchips motherboard self-built computer.During the last year the screen has a tendency to go black (blank) at any time for no reason at all. </s>
<s> The only way to fix it is to restart the computer and even then it takes quite a while for the image to come back. </s>
<s> It usually comes back during the Scandisk that is done before windows starts when it's restarted abrupty. </s>
<s> The system itself doesn't freeze, but of course I can't do anything without being able to see the screen. </s>
<s> The screen is a Techmedia 15''. </s>
<s> The video card is a Cirrus Logic 5546. </s>
<s> The components of the computer are all rather generic. </s>
<s> Here's where the question goes. </s>
<s> I don't know what is causing this. </s>
<s> Tightening the cables hasn't worked. </s>
<s> I don't know if the problem is due to the screen or the video card. </s>
<s> This is what I would like to know. </s>
<s> Is it the screen or video card causing this problem? </s>
<s> Any possible solutions? </s>
<s> I'd really appreciate if you all could help me with this because it's driving me and my family crazy. </s>
<s> Do you have another monitor that you could try, to see if it is the monitor or in the computer. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Gordon </s>
<s> Techmedia is on the lower end of the monitor scale. </s>
<s> If you hear an audible click, then black, the monitor isn't cutting it. </s>
<s> Of course the best test is to swap card and/or monitor on another system. </s>
<s> It maybe also just showing its age and finally on its last legs. </s>
<s> I suggest you prepare to get another monitor when you can. </s>
<s> If possible a decent used monitor could be had at local Goodwill or Sal. </s>
<s> Army, maybe also inform them of your need and willingness to pay when one comes in. </s>
<s> -OR- local computer shop as well. </s>
<s> You can always buy new as cheap monitors around here are $80+ range. </s>
<s> sorry... tada -----Willy </s>
<s> While changing the monitor for another for a test is a great idea, an old server at the office with a Cirrus Logic PCI card failed. </s>
<s> The video card was the culprit. </s>
<s> Mind you I am strictly sharing this one occurance (out of hundreds) but you are reaching the end of life on the parts in said box and may have to search out replacements. </s>
<s> -&gt; DO TRY OPENING THE BOX AND DUSTING IT OUT in case it's a heat induced issue. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> First swap video cards. </s>
<s> You didn't specify if it was a CRT or not and I'm not familiar with techmedia. </s>
<s> If it is a CRT unplug the power cord and take the back off. </s>
<s> On the neck of the CRT itself is a small PCB (circuit board)carefully unplug the PCB from the neck of the CRT. </s>
<s> You will see a partial to full circle of solder joints. </s>
<s> These are the filaments to the CRT. </s>
<s> After a period of time these solder joints can become poor. </s>
<s> As the display heats up, it causes a fracture of the joint (thermal fracture) Resolder and give it a whirl. </s>
<s> You can also check them before you do anything by taking the back off and power up your system. </s>
<s> Turn all lights off and you should see a &quot;glow&quot; in the neck of the CRT. </s>
<s> If the &quot;glow&quot; is there, then it is NOT the filaments. </s>
<s> As long as the unit is unplugged you don't have to worry about getting a shock as long as you stay away from the anode lead going to the head of the CRT. </s>
<s> It is usually a big red wire with a suction cup on the CRT. </s>
<s> Just don't poke anything under that (that is where the stored charge is) Usually 20KV - 25KV range. </s>
