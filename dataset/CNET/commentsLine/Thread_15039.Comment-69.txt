if you have an infected secondary hard drive, it will more than likely infect your primary hard drive during boot time, therefore most of the aforementioned methodologies will not be useful.
do you have a copy of xp cd?
if so follow these steps carefully and at your own risk.
1. set computer to boot from cd 2. unplug all hard drives from the computers mother board.
isolate clean drive(s)!
3. plug in drive to be cleaned, carefully plug cable, make sure it is in the right direction, do not force 4. boot to cd.
when asked a clean install or repair chose repair.
5. when the dos screen (recovery console) shows up type fixboot c: fixes boot file 6. then type fixmbr , upon completion type exit .
fixes master boot record , root kits hide here 7a.
type format c: depending on the size of your hd, this may take a while.when finished type exit .
7b.
if hd is not too large (&lt;1t)upon fixing mbr type exit go through the xp install process press c (create a partition ) format partition using ntfs, when finished exit.
turn off computer.
8. unplug formatted drive, replug original hd.
reboot.
drive is ready to be used either as a secondary internal drive or an external drive (once placed in the right hd case).
warning being rough or forcing the motherboard will break the mb killing your computer.
make sure you have the right cables before you start and be gentile with the mb, don't force the cables and if ata drive make sure you set the jumpers on the secondary drive to slave when finished.
