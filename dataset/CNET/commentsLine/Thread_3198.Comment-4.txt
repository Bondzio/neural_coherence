thanks!
w/o you pointing out i would not have relized that having separate tv tuner and video card is great if i ever need to upgrade only one.
thanks also for the list of recommended brands and links.
based on looking around at dealnews i found the following items that i ma thinking of buying: 1. visiontek xtasy radeon 9250 256mb pci video card (down to $40 at circuitc.
after rebates)it seems to have some decoding support for video (mpeg2 etc) and has a dvi outlet so i can take advantage of my digital monitor 2.a hauppauge wintv-usb2 usb 2.0 tv tuner (down to $40 at circuitc.
after rebates) .
but i don't know if usb is harder for the cpu?
or 2.b hauppauge wintv-pvr-150mce pci tv card (65) or 2.c k-world usb atsc hdtv tuner box - kw-atsc-310 (for $50 at buy.com) again, i don't know if there is a down side to using usb port, but atleast i would have more pci slots free if i need to get a better sound card than the integrated 7.1 ihave to support the hdtv card.
also, i don't know about this brand would be great to get any suggestions/comments (from anyone) thanks alot!
