My system currently has a 160GB PATA-100 hard drive. My motherboard is a MS-7093. The instructions say I need to make sure the SATA port is enabled. I was in the BIOS and saw nothing about SATA. Integrated periferals says a lot about IDE. Any ideas on how I can enable my SATA port. eMachines T6212 Windows XP SP2 (up to date) It was made week 9 of 2005

So the list is short. 1. See if there is a newer BIOS. 2. Install a PCI SATA card (they are cheap on newegg.com and geeks.com) Bob

I found this &quot;The mainboard BIOS provides &quot;Plug & Play&quot; BIOS which detects the peripheral devices and expansion cards of the board automatically.&quot; and &quot;No bios upgrade was needed to detect the SATA HDD&quot; So I should be set.

I un installed Studio9 and tried to reinstall it on the new drive. &quot;DRV1_VOL1(K:)&quot; It told me I could not install in that drive so I had to reinstall in drive C:. I had some video on K: and tried to defragment it. I clicked &quot;Defragment&quot; and the drive started clicking. After about 15 min it was still at 3% complete so I tried to stop the defrag and my computer froze. Anyone have an idea as to why I can't put Pinnacle Studio9 on the new drive and why the defragment doesn't work on the new drive? I have a feeling the defrag doesn't work because the capturing program is on a different drive.
