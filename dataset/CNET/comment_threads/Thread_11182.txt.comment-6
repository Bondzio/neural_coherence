&quot;You mentioned why he was using an X700 vs an nvidia 6600GT.
Both eMachines and the mobo manufacturer, MSI, STRONGLY recommend that any video card installed should be ATI based and NOT nvidia!&quot; ALL MANUFACTURERS WILL RECOMMEND YOU NOT TO INSTALL A NVIDIA CARD IN A MACHINE WITH ATI GRAPHICS (INTEGRATED/CARD), and the reverse.
SOMEONE has already installed a 6600GT in the emachines t6212 without a problem on this forum.
There's no problem with using a nvidia card in a ati chipset/reverse.
