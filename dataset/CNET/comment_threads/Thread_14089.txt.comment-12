http://pixel01.cps.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/cs-009007.htm gives us more about what or why the PSU can cause a failed boot.
Let's say you want to troubleshoot a dead PC.
The tried and true method is to remove all but the PSU, motherboard, CPU+HSF and the Speaker.
If those parts are good then the speaker sounds in protest of all the missing other parts.
If not, we are staring at the last 4 possible parts.
