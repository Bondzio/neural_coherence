<s> I started a small at home business of taking digital pictures of weddings, family portraits, school pictures and things like that. </s>
<s> I am getting more shoots than I ever thought I would and my AMD 4200 and 3 gigs of pc3200 ram is just too slow. </s>
<s> I will be changing the mother board, Ram and CPU, but don't know if I should be looking at a duel or quad core processor. </s>
<s> It will be a Intel and so far I have looked at a E8600 duel core processor. </s>
<s> Also my computer has the built in card reader does that make a difference? </s>
<s> I am using a Sandisk Extreme III CF card for the camera. </s>
<s> I am running Windows Vista home premium and Adobe CS3 Any advise would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks Wayne </s>
<s> But is the CPU the bottleneck? </s>
<s> Usually I discover people complain about the recording time to DVD or something else not CPU bound. </s>

<s> What happens in my case is I can take around 100 pictures, put the card in the reader and it may take 10 minutes or so for them to all open so I can start editing them. </s>
<s> Then once I do the editing and click save, it may take 20 to 30 sec before I can save each picture into a folder which takes another 20 to 30 sec. </s>
<s> I don't count the time it takes for editing as I shoot in RAW and I know that takes a little longer to process the pictures. </s>
<s> You gave me advise awhile back about the 3 gig switch which did help, but as I am doing more of this now I would like to get it done faster if possible. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>

<s> Once I get all the pictures touched up I have no problem at all burning them to CD or DVD, that part is very fast. </s>

<s> Copy them from the reader to the hard disk. </s>
<s> Opening them from the card could be the issue. </s>
<s> I will try it that way next time and before I spend the money on the upgrade. </s>
