both quadros and geforces can be run sli, which is what i'm planning.
I'm asking which to use, the twin sli quadros or twin sli geforces.
Secondly, both processors I listed are dual core.
While the fx60 can only be run single chip, the opterons can be run as two dual core processors on a sinlge motherboard.
The system im talking about is far past last years equipt, it is the highest quality currently available on the market...
