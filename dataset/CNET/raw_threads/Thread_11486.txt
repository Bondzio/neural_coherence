I'm now experiencing a major slow down or non-response in opening up programs, logging onto the internet, opening up email and spastic mouse movements (also wireless, but with two new batteries installed on 8/30). Anyone know what's up with this?

Try this, go to 2wire.com and choose the speed meter option, check with your ISP what's your bandwith and if this is lower than the bandwith you're paying for should be a hardware issue, if is higher there's a software problem on your computer. Another thing you can try is connect a computer with ethernet cable, and see if the issue with speed still the same, if it does, you better contact your ISP
