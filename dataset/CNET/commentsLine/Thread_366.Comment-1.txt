some of them like lenovo or gateway only allow for 2gigs of ram.
looking into the future, 2 gigs doesn't seem as if it's going to have a lot of staying power.
i need opinions as to whether or not a 2 gig maximum is going to be sufficient say 9 mo.
to a year from now.
i'd like a computer that will not become obsolete all to quickly.
thanks in advance.
