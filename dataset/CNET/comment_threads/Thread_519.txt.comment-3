Since your machines are not in some DNS (server) pathping can't resolve the names.
No failure in my book.
-&gt; The network neighborhood is full of issues.
No fix is forthcoming and if you want to spend the money on the phone with support, so be it.
However if I want to look at shares and machines I use the COMMAND LINE.
Such as... NET VIEW And the other net commands.
Feel free to rant that the Network Neighborhood needs work.
