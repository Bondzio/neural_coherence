<s> I want to print from my laptop that is wirelssly connected to a router and my desktop. </s>
<s> To be able to use my wired to desktop printer with my laptop, do I need to install the printer drivers onto it? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Laptop has Win 2000, desktop has Win XP. </s>
<s> that the Add Printer Wizard of W2000 will prompt you for those drivers. </s>
<s> If the drivers are within it's database they usually will suffice, elsewise have the disk or downloaded file available. </s>
