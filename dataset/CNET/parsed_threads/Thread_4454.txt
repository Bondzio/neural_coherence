<s> Hi, I currently have 3 hard disks on my computer. </s>
<s> 2 hard disks of them are working fine including the one with which I boot my computer . </s>
<s> The 3rd Hard disk has 2 partitions. </s>
<s> Suddenly the 1st partition of this 3rd drive does not show any &quot;free space&quot; & &quot;total size&quot; in &quot;Details&quot; view of &quot;My Computer&quot;. </s>
<s> Note: It does not show 0.00, it remains blank. </s>
<s> Whereas the partitions of other drives & other partition of this drive show show their respective value. </s>
<s> Even when I try to open this drive in &quot;My Computer&quot;, computer reports &quot; drive is not formatted. </s>
<s> do you want to format it now?&quot; What could be possible problems with this partition?? </s>
<s> What will be the respective solution to problem?? </s>
<s> The second partition of the same hard disk is working properly. </s>
<s> This hard disk contains important data in it. </s>
<s> I have already cleaned up RAM contacts with clean eraser & put a new CELL in place of one that is there on motherboard. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> When I see such a disaster the first step if I am going to attempt to repair it to clone the drive. </s>
<s> I get a drive of about the same size (not too much bigger) and use G4U's copydisk from http://www.feyrer.de/g4u/ (sorry but I must decline duplicating the manual on how to use this.) </s>
<s> Now that I have a good copy I can try tools like GETDATABACK or ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY to see if they will get the partition back. </s>
<s> I never work on the original drive for the obvious reasons. </s>
