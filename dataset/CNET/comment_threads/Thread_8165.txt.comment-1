In my house I have a few Windows systems, both Vista and XP and a few MACs.
A few months back, we bought an EyeTV for the iMac and use it to record TV shows.
Much to our surprise, it also allows us to access digital and HD channels from our cable line (no set-top box).
I'd like to find a PC equivalent but unfortunately Elgato (the EyeTV manufacturer) does not make a PC version of the product.
I want to do this because I would like to move my TV recording process to a home server and that is Windows-based.
I'd like to ask this community, especially those with TV Tuner experience, for recommendations for a good PC TV Tuner product that hopefully will give me everything that EyeTV does on the Mac.
