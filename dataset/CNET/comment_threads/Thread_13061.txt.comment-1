I just did some research on the Intel website regarding my Intel Pentium 4 Processor number 519 which comes with the Emachines T5026.
It said that Hyper-Threading was turned off for this processor.
Why?
Does anyone know how I can turn the Hyper-Threading on or do I need a new motherboard?
Thanks in advance.
