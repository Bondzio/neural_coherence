What is FAT32?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table What is NTFS?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS The key points are that FAT32 is not damage resistent and one could lose the drive contents.
This is not the fault of the USB drive makers but a limitation of this very dated file system.
Hope this helps, Bob
