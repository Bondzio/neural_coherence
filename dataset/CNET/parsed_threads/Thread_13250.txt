<s> I've got a HD TV (HD Ready (720p / 1080i) ) and i have it hooked up to normal TV, and then i have a AGP cable coming from my PC (ATI Radeon HD 3650) to the AGP port on the TV. </s>
<s> thing is when I'm watching video on it, i get black lines moving up the screen. </s>
<s> and i don't like it. </s>
<s> currently i had a dvi to agp converter for the cable, but i was wondering, if i got a dvi to HDMI converter instead, and plugged into the HDMI port of the tv, would i get a better picture quality? </s>
<s> Your agp card doesn't have agp output port. </s>
<s> What does the manual say about output ports that you have. </s>
<s> If you have a dvi output connection, then all you need a is a cable that has dvi connector in one end and hdmi connector on the other end. </s>
<s> Did you mean VGA? </s>
<s> PC to TV? </s>
<s> AGP? </s>
<s> If you are just trying to use your big screen as a monitor, VGA should be fine, DVI to DVI should be a bit better, which means not a converter but a cable. </s>
<s> HDMI encompasses both Video and Audio so in order to take advantage of those functions you would need an HDMI card in the pc and of course and HDMI cable. </s>
<s> There can be a lot of variables, depending on what you are trying to do and system capability (computer) can have a lot to do with the outcome. </s>
