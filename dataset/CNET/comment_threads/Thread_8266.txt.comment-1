Hello experts, I have a dell dimension XPS T850r desktop (ATX casing, PIII, 887Mhz,760MB RAM, WinXP).
It is very slow machine now, and I was trying decide between upgrading it or buying a new one... since my budget is around $200.
IfI bought a new motherbaord, RAM and processor, will the new motherboard fit in the current casing or will there be any misalignment?
Which motherboard should I buy?
I highly appreciate any advice!
Thanks
