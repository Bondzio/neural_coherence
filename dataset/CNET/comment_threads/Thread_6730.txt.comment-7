You create 3 accounts or one account for each user.
Now each machine has those accounts.
The shares are made and you adjust the permissions to allow or deny the users you list.
It IS widely documented but many will write it's not because at first it seems intimidating.
It's simple.
Accounts, create shares, adjust permissions.
Any other way and you've created something new and your own creation?
