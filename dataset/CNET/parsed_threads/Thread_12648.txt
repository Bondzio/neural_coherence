<s> I have installed Windows (XP, Vista, and 7 beta) on a new hard drive, all the necessary drivers, but it doesn't work. </s>
<s> It works in Ubuntu however. </s>
<s> It won't work on any install, even on a &quot;new&quot; hard drive (writing 0's to disk). </s>
<s> It is not a hardware issue, since it works with a different OS. </s>
<s> I've tried many ethernet cables and cards to verify this as well. </s>
<s> What could be the problem? </s>
<s> The diagnose and fix feature doesn't help at all. </s>
<s> Many thanks for your help. </s>
<s> Micrsoft is hit and mostly miss. </s>
<s> I don't see where you installed the drivers. </s>
<s> I installed the drivers from the CD that was included with the ethernet card. </s>
<s> I also installed the motherboard drivers from the CD and internet, but onboard LAN doesn't work either. </s>
<s> I read your posts again and no make, model, driver versions, names. </s>
<s> Since these are MIA you are left with a simple issue and that is, as supplied the product is defective. </s>

<s> You rarely see people ask for those details since we have the words in red. </s>
