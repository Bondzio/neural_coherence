<s> Recently I bought a 2gb Sandisk Cruzer Micro. </s>
<s> I found this website (www.pendrivelinux.com) which shows how to install linux on a pen drive. </s>
<s> I downloaded the linux version and followed the instructions to install it. </s>
<s> Trust me I need the instructions!! </s>
<s> Anyway, when I tried to boot from the pen drive I got an error and it booted into windows instead. </s>
<s> I decided to give up on it and just reformat the pen drive but when I went to reformat it, it said that my drives capacity was 400mb!! </s>
<s> Please help me get back the rest of my memory!! </s>
<s> Just ask if you need to know anything else!! </s>
<s> Thanks!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> My easy fix is to plug the USB stick in and head to the drive management console. </s>
<s> There I'll remove all the partitions from that USB stick, create a new FAT or FAT32 partition and use the quick format option. </s>
