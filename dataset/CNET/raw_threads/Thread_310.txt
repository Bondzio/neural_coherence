I found the manual at the http site listed later. The pdf manual of 20 pages shows several figures, however the figure for the motherboard is blank. I am trying to rebuild an older computer with the gigabyte MB and need help finding the graphical layout of the board. Can anyone help? Thank you http://america.giga-byte.com/MotherBoard/FileList/Manual/manual_6ex_e.pdf

Normaly, motherboard manufacturers tag thier ports, inputs, and pins on the board. With the manual you v, it might take some time, bt I am sure you could decipher it. Also, have you tried thier tech support?

Thanks much for the input. Gigabyte's web site was worthless and their email response (?)_ Well, I am still waiting !!!

They were actually proprietary mobos used in proprietary computers and poorly documented. Found five varitations, compared item/location by item amd none acvtually matched. Came the closest at the UK Gigabyte site. The mobo had a Dell stamp, but no sign of it at Dell.

Here is the information I got, I am pretty sure you have the same. If you can get the original book manuel you will be lucky. http://www.giga-byte.com/Products/Motherboard/Products_Spec.aspx?ProductID=1495 But to get hardware for it will be hard it would be cheaper to get a barebone kit and start from there. Here is a good barebone that you would not have to spend a lot, just add CPU, Memory, Hard drive. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16856110030 Good Luck Wendell H

This one is a lot faster than the other I mentioned earlier. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16856110041 Enjoy what ever you make your mind up to do. Good Luck Wendell H

It took 2 attempts to get a board that would fit in the case and a couple of catalog goof ups with power supplies but the box is up and running. Again thanks
