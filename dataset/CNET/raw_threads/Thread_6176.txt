Thanks P

Each one should not exceed 120GB because the LBA used on this series will not support anything higher than 127GB. As for the first part of the question, put it back where it was and leave it alone. If the machine is still running correctly, great. As a matter of curiosity, how did the two pieces become separated? P

It's my first mac. I haven't used them in years so I am slightly rusty. What is the name of the expansion slots on the logic board?? I want to look for USB port expansion cards.

They are readily available. Bear in mind that this machine will not be able to run the latest version of OS X and, if it is running OS X at all, probably has 10.3.9 or 10.4.x on it. Good Luck P
3640	6	311663	2879200	2878468	In-Correct	10/10/08 9:10 PM	1.223673E12	Thank You:	It has 9.2 and I might upgrade to a more recent version someday, or perhaps I will get an additional machine, probably a notebook because too many desktops take up more space, and install OS X on something whenever needed....because like I said I haven't used a mac for years and even on an older OS I am still having lots of fun on it!! Just wondering how does the Heatsink stay on anyways?? Is it electromagnetic?? Because if there is supposed to be that slimey cooling gel or whatever that stuff is between a processor and heatsink, that stuff is not present.

The clip is shaped so that it exerts downward pressure on the heatsink. It has a slot in both ends which attach to a plastic hook on the processor seat. This is the same as many PC heat sinks are attached. There should be some thermal paste between the heat sink and the processor. YOU SHOULD NOT OPERATE YOUR COMPUTER UNTIL THE HEAT SINK IS CORRECTLY ATTACHED. You WILL fry the processor if the heat sink is not attached correctly. P

Since it only has ethernet connection on it and since I have more than one computer now, I will just get high speed interent before I finish setting it up... Right now I am searching for websites for heatsink repair that has clips and thermal paste...do you know of any to recommend??

The paste you can get from Radio Shack and you may be able to get a clip from your local computer repair shop. They are pretty generic. After you get the High Speed internet, don't forget the router P
