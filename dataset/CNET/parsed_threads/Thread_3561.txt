<s> I need an inexpensive printer to print out 11 x 17 color copies. </s>
<s> Photo quality not needed. </s>
<s> Any tips? </s>
<s> Printing costs as a factor, and citing http://www.printerdb.com/ you'll want to consider the page http://www.printerdb.com/ColorTabloid.html showing per page printing cost to drop from 30 cents per page to about 19 cents. </s>
<s> It will not take long for a &quot;cheap&quot; inkjet to rob you of the initial savings. </s>
<s> I propose you review the models listed at http://www.printerdb.com/Spreadsheets/TAB_COLOR_LASER.xls and see what they cost in your area. </s>
