a hard drive could last forever except for the effects of: heat shock & vibration power failures obsolescence i have had to replace a drive for each one of those occurrences.
the biggest issue i faced were power failures.
i lost three drive before i figured out what the issue was.
added a ups to my system and have not had one die after a storm, blackout, brownout, etc.
it is the interruptions that last about 1/2 to 1 sec that do them in.
anything shorter or longer they seem to withstand.
of course dropping a laptop on the floor is not good.
did that once.
had an external unit with no fan - that does not work.
i got too hot and was history.
then there is just the lack of space to do a defrag.
i have a 1tb unit in the mail now.
theoretically, i suppose there is a limit to how many times u can magnetize those particles, but that is beyond me and i have never had a failure because of it.
