hello, thanks for the tip!
my purchase decision gets postponed till end july / first week of august!
which motherboard will suit the piv duals best, btw?
and, is there anything better than transcend rams?
how is the performance of these transcend memories?
any inputs on these are highly appreciated.
tia, sanjay.
