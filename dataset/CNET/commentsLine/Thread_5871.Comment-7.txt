unit identified there's no way to give an educated guess on whether it will work or not.
some mb are very sensitive to ram voltage while others...almost anything goes.
i looked on the acer site for aspire ast180-ud400a and could not find any product info...none.
i'm also guessing there's no option in the bios to increase or reduce ram voltage so you're at a disadvantage there.
all i can say for the moment is you can try it and see if it works.
accurate, reliable answers to questions like yours are often not as simple as yes or no.
ergo the reason for the questions.
also be aware there are issues using 4gb of ram on winxp 32-bit version.
unless you really need 4gb ram in the xps...it may be better to skip that for now or until you get an os than handles it properly...xp 64 bit or perhaps some version of vista.
