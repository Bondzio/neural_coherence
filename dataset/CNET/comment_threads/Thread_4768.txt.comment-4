... and you're right.
It is terrific.
I just got it with my Inspiron 518 a month ago and I was surprised by it.
It is not a standard keyboard; it's a multimedia keyboard and it has the touch of an Apple keyboard.
I wish I could tell you more, but you're right in that you can't configure it online.
Mine came with a PC that I bought at a third party vendor.
