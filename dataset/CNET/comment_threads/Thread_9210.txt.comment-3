I have shared the my documents folders, and a couple of others, on both computers.
The workgroup name is the same for both as well (MSHOME).
The only firewall being used is the Windows firewall, and I have tried disabling it to no avail.
As I mentioned, both computers can ''see'' each other.
The Compaq can also see the shared folders on the Acer.
The Acer can only see the Compaq computer name.
Shared printers can not be seen.
Thanks again.
