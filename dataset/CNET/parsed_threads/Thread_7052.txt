<s> Hey people First of all apologies if this is in the wrong section, I was a little confused to where to create a ew topic and thought this would be the best place but mods please remove if you feel necessary. </s>
<s> I was hoping someone could offer me a little support regarding trying to add my new tv/monitor as my secondary monitor to my pc, ideally what I want is when you add a second monitor to your laptop as an extended monitor that is what I require. </s>
<s> Is this possible? </s>
<s> If so how? </s>
<s> Would I need to purchase an additional graphioc card for my pc? </s>
<s> Could you recommend me one? </s>
<s> Or could I purchase something like a vga splitter which I would plug in the back of my vga slot and it would have two female vga connections? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> But without a make or model that's as far as I can go. </s>
<s> All the office and home laptops do this. </s>
<s> I'm thinking of investing in a hdmi pci card as my tv/monitor has a hd connection. </s>
<s> So all I need to do is add this pci card to my motherboard and then buy a hdmi cable? </s>
<s> and connect the cable from the pc to the tv? </s>
<s> the only query I have regarding this is that would my pc sound also come out of my tv? </s>
<s> That is ideal for me. </s>
<s> I know I could have gone down the easy route of getting a vga connection for my pc but the hdmi graphics will be better and I might get sound. </s>
<s> No laptops today have PCI connections. </s>
<s> Also, any USB Video is far too slow to play video such as DVD or games. </s>
<s> But about HDMI. </s>
<s> A few of the newer laptops in the office have HDMI and those can ship sound over HDMI. </s>
<s> But again I can't see a make and model so the discussion runs flat. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Sorry but this is not a laptop, im talking about my custom built dektop pc. </s>
<s> Looking over PCI cards I didn't find any I could find assurance that audio would go over HDMI. </s>
<s> Would running audio the old fashioned way be so bad? </s>
<s> Are you saying you don't have 2 vga/dvi outputs on your graphics card? </s>
<s> If not I would have thought it would be better to have 2 as I don't think you can split 1 output. </s>
<s> Bear in mind though that when you have dual-screens (extended desktop) it can have a performance impact on games i.e. </s>
<s> tearing on screen etc. </s>
<s> So you're better off turning the extended desktop off if you play games. </s>
<s> I saw this at Fry's on today paper. </s>
<s> It's call &quot;vga video splitter&quot; with 4 ports up to 1920x1440 resolution and it's made by IOGear. </s>
<s> $45 with $10 instant saving. </s>
<s> I did see another devices for such purpose but I forgot the name or where I have seen it. </s>
<s> So it's out there. </s>
<s> This one could be use as clone or display extension. </s>
