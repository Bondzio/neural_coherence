So far have decided: OS:Windows XP CPU:Intel Core 2 Duo E6700 Do I need to decide on chipsets now before choosing the motherboard? Do I need to know what RAM first? (I think 2GB DDR2 but don't know more yet, would also like to add more later) HDD will be either WD or Seagate SATA 250-500GB dependent on $ (not sure if you need to know this) Would like to add another HDD later (do I need RAID?) Will need PCIE for sound card This is not for gaming just music production/sound engineering so basic graphics ok. Will not be used on internet or LAN. Asus P5K seems popular but there are many different varieties. Which one? Thankyou, Anna

Writing steady streams of digitized music, and read/write of large chunks of digitized music during audio editing can heat up a drive fast. Everything you are buying is for creating the music. It's the only valuable stuff. Raid-5 starts with 3 HDDs; Raid-10 starts with 4. Gets expensive! However, I just read about the Data Robotics Drobo that provides the same protection as Raid-5 but starts with only two HDDs. You can read about it on this PC World link.. http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,134339/article.html Cost of this box is pretty competitive. Check it out.

Is there anything stopping me just getting say a 320GB internal HDD now, then buying a Drobo a bit later on and another HDD and transferring the first one to the Drobo (when I have the $, and when prices down a bit)? I am in NZ and am having trouble even finding a NZ price/seller for Drobo, and not sure whether it would be any cheaper to order things from US after shipping and tax included. Also, if did do as I mentioned above (say use one HDD for a few months) would the kind of setup we are talking about be at much risk of overheating problems if in a regular sized box (mid-tower?)? Would moving to the Drobo setup eliminate a lot of heating issues? Thankyou again for your help, it is greatly appreciated! Anna

Also the gigabyte ga-g33m-s2 is mATX - which I am thinking means it is smaller than regular ATX? Why not just ATX? Would it make a difference in terms of heat? Thankyou, Anna

GA-G33M-DS2R, $142: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=10005399&ref=lmcd
