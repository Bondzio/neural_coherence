nothing will work without memory.
if your memory is good and compatible with your motherboard you should get output on the monitor.
(if the monitor is good.)
a good test is to disconnect everything except for the motherboard (with memory), power supply, keyboard and monitor.
you should hear p.o.s.t.
(beeps once.
if it beeps more than once there could be some other problem.)
if everything is working properly you should see at the very least the bios message on the monitor.
from there you can begin adding one part at a time until you hit the faulty part.
hope this helps.
