<s> Hello, I just removed a very full internal hard drive (Seagate IDE) and replaced it with a new 160gb (Western Digital) hard drive. </s>
<s> I thought it would be a simple swap, just needing to change jumpers as I was slaving the old drive. </s>
<s> However, none of the drives are booting up I am getting a clicking sound from both drives. </s>
<s> What went wrong we simply unplugged and followed the directions that came with the new drive? </s>
<s> Windows XP O/S. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> These computers have the OS installed to those hard drives and a new drive would do nothing. </s>
<s> Your post does not reveal how you prepared the HDD for booting. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The CAR analogy. </s>
<s> Some folk think you can change a HDD like you do a car tire. </s>
<s> Sorry no. </s>
<s> It's much more complicated. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> disconnect he new one, visit the seagate.com site and get the diagrams so you can set the new one to a slave. </s>
<s> also download the seagate utility to clone drives then set the new one as master, the oldie as slave and reboot from the seagate utlity cd/dvd/usb. </s>
<s> WD has a slightly different way to jumper their HD's than other makers. </s>
<s> Look close at the paper work or visit their site. </s>
<s> If you have 80 cond cables you might want to try the CS jumper and the proper plug on the cable. </s>
