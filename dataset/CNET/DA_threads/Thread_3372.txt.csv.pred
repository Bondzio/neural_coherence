1.1.1	Ok so I want to get a small laptop with a screen less than 10 & quot ; .	St
1.1.2	I have a desktop and a 15in HP , but I hate carrying my 15in around because I find it too big .	St
1.1.3	I want something I can fit in my purse and take to school ( college ) and pop it open at any time ; my 15in requires a bag of its own and is a bit heavy .	St
1.1.4	So I have decided to get a net-book .	St
1.1.5	I am just going to use it to surf the net ( cough ... watch hulu ... cough ) , type some lab reports and essays for class , and run Itunes .	St
1.1.6	Nothing too power or space consuming .	St
1.1.7	So what should I get .	St
1.1.8	I have looked at several like the Asus eee pc , Acer Aspire , and the HP mini-note but I am not quite sure what to get .	St
1.1.9	Here are the things I want : the notebook has to be between 8.9 and 10in , it has to have good screen resolution , good battery life , has to have decent hard drive space ( not like 4GB , that 's nothing and I do not want to buy more space ) , be less than $ 400 , and MOST importantly it must have an Intel Atom CPU .	St
1.1.10	I would also love it if it runs Linux but that 's not a must I will change the operating system myself .	St
1.1.11	I know , I know I am asking for too much but there are some that do meet those requirements and I need help choosing which one to get .	St
1.1.12	Absolutely ANY help is welcome ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	St
1.1.13	Thank you in advance .	St
1.2.1	Hi , 123lali I recently purchased an acer aspire at Walmart for $ 349 .	St
1.2.2	This unit has XP , 1 gig of ram and a 120gig hard drive with the 3 cell battery .	St
1.2.3	Amazon has the same unit with a160gig hard drive and a 6 cell battery for less than $ 400 .	St
1.2.4	I did a lot of research before buying this unit and I have not been disappointed .	St
1.2.5	Very fast , great screen and very functional .	Polite
1.2.6	Let me know if you have any questions ,	St
1.3.1	i have seen the acer .	St
1.3.2	i heard the eeepc is better .	St
1.3.3	have you tried the eeepc ?	Ques
1.3.4	is there a difference ?	Ques
1.4.1	With all of those reguirements you are pretty much stuck with the acer .	St
1.4.2	But if you raised your & quot ; price-cap & quot ; things would be different .	St
1.4.3	Most of the Netbooks with good battery life cost over $ 430 and even then some are n't even that good .	St
1.4.4	I would try to advoid the acer because of the keyboard and track pad .	St
1.4.5	But a netbook with a good battery and the Atom and Linux is the acer or an asus .	St
1.4.6	But then the keyboards are sub par .	St
1.4.7	If you want a good keyboard and the atom and a large hard drive then look at the MSI wind or the Samsung NC 10 .	St
1.4.8	Cnets review on the MSI are out-of-date , so try other sites .	St
1.4.9	But with that strict price cap you will have to settle .	St
1.5.1	Both of those netbooks are really good .	St
1.5.2	I have an Asus myself and really like it .	St
1.5.3	There 's a good comparison of both at : http : //tech.spotcoolstuff.com/computer-laptop/acer-vs-asus	Polite
1.6.1	go back to your link and read , carefully , the paragraph under & quot ; Webcam & quot ; .	Sug
1.6.2	It seems to mention a different brand name than Asus ... maybe a typo and maybe an author 's Freudian slip .	St
1.7.1	you could get a dell mini 9 for $ 250ish and then just put a 16gb sdhc card in the card slot	St
