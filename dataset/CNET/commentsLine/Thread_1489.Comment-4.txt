if your mobo already supported sli, then adding another $80 8600gt might be a good idea since you'd see a 50% improvement in many games.
but a $150 9600gt would give you a 100-150% boost in practically every game and cost less than an 8600gt and a new mobo.
for the combined cost of two cards, you can usually find a single card that outperforms them both.
so, sli is good for a budget upgrade (buy 1 card now, add another later when it falls in price and/or your budget allows) or if you want the absolute best performance and money is not an issue (spend $600 on two 9800gtx).
