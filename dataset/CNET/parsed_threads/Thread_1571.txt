<s> I installed a new generic PSU into my new Acer. </s>
<s> The computer boots up when the power strip is switched on(without pressing the on button). </s>
<s> The computer runs fine after booting, but when shut down the power supply fan keeps spinning. </s>
<s> My local computer store thinks that Acer may need a special Acer PSU. </s>
<s> What should I try next? </s>
<s> The reason is to remove the heat. </s>
<s> The stock PSU burnt out so I can't test it but I don't think it's fan contined to spin after it was turned off. </s>
<s> And why would the computer start up without pressing the on/off switch? </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> I just don't know why the computer would boot when the power strip is turned on. </s>
<s> Also when the computer is turned off, the CPU fan somtimes spins very rapidly. </s>
<s> Some times everything but the PSU shuts down. </s>
<s> I've seen such oddities vanish when I replace the motherboard. </s>
<s> It's not a nice thing to find out as the price of the repair just doubled. </s>
<s> -&gt; Sorry but I can't give a clear reading on what's wrong. </s>
<s> Not that I don't have ideas but I don't get to see the machine first hand. </s>
