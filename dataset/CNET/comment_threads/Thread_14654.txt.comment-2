Bad RAM and other hardware failures tend to generate beep codes.
But, a power supply can fail to start...or remain started...due to an overload.
While I've not seen this personally, there was an issue with bad capacitors that's known to cause such.
You'd check MB for capacitors that bulge or show leakage.
