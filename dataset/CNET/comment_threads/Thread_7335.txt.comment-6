Making the CPU work and operate at it's potential is dependant on the MB more than anything else.
You must insert it properly and cool it.
These are &quot;keyed&quot; so you just about can't put it in wrong.
You will need to find an adequate fan and heat sink.
These are readily available and P3s don't produce the heat P4s do.
The fan will probably plug into a MB near the CPU socket.
You may have to set jumpers or core voltages but most modern MBs are jumper free and can autodetect the CPU and configure it.
You should have a MB manual handy and the web site of the manufacturer is usually a good source for these.
