when i have this type of problem with a clients pc, the first thing i do is to remove all expansion cards except video from the motherboard.
and then disconnect all drives from the motherboard, so the only thing you have left is memory and video card.
make sure the drive cables are disconnected from the motherboard not just the power cables.
then try booting the system.
if you get video, then try reconnecting the drives and installing the expansion cards one at a time.
if you don't get video, then either the video card, memory, cpu or motherboard is bad.
if you get down to the last four items, remove the battery from the motherboard or reset the bios with the jumper and try again.
try removing all the memory, and see it you get a beep warning from the bios from the missing memory.
if there is no beep without the memory then the motherboard is the problem, if you do get the beep warning , then it is probably a bad video card.
you can also remove the cpu from the motherboard and power on the system for a few seconds to reset the motherboard, sometimes the cpu and motherboard get out of synch and doing this resets them.
hope this gives you some ideas about what to try.
