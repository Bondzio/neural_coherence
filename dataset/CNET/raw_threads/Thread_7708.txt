With rampant identity theft and general insecurity abound these days I would very much like to do a disk wipe before I take my system to the store. Although the nice man said he would do one for me I would rather do it myself if you know what I mean. Anyway, since this is the first time I have done this I was wondering if anyone would recommend a disk wipe utility (price is irrelivant this is important stuff) that is reliable and thorough. Any other thoughts to consider or general information/horror stories you could help me avoid would be much appreciated. Thanks, Jim

Once done, use it and it does 1 pass removal, run again as a final pass(you have to reload it again) and you're done. You can reformat before its usage if you care to but not required. Read thier webpage info, its interesting if anything and it does the job, simple and easy, no thoughts about it. tada -----Willy
