Imagine one's surprise?
Another posted here installed some Microsoft Windows Update and immediately began to have issues.
They had taken the offer for a driver.
They didn't think much of that, so we had to go a few rounds and eventually they called Emachines.
The driver was rolled back.
This may not be your issue, but not unheard of.
