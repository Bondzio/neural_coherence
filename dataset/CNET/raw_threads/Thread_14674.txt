Please help with an answer on subnetting I take a class B address, say 172.16.0.0/16 and borrow 3 bits from the host portion, the new subnet mask is 255.255.255.224 The subnets are172.16.0.0/19172.16.32.0/19172.16.64.0/19172.16.96.0/19172.16.128.0/19172.16.160.0/19172.16.192.0/19172.16.224.0/19 I am totally confused here. 1) Please let me know how many subnets are possible, if I borrow 3bits. Is it 2^3 = 8 subnetsor (2^3)-2=6 subnets? 2) I believe 172.16.0.0/19 cannot be used by defaultto use this subnet, ip subnet-zero command has to be issued 3) Is 172.16.224.0/19, a valid subnet?What is the first host address, last host address andthe broadcast address for this subnet?RegardsVijay

We never do. Homework is something to do yourself. Otherwise you won't learn anything. Kees
