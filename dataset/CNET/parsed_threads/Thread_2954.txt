<s> I have been facing few problems in finding enclosure. </s>
<s> I have bought 3 different type of enclosure till date and all of them are off in dimension by few millimeters and hence not working. </s>
<s> It is for 2.5&quot; SATA internal harddrive 80GB from my 1 year old HP laptop. </s>
<s> any recommendations will be surely appreciated. </s>
<s> thanks Harvijay </s>
<s> Why not drill or modify to make it work? </s>
<s> If not, have someone else do this. </s>
<s> can't do it man, it is cheap made in japan product made up of plastic, and will break if i use it to drill or modify. </s>
<s> I've used simple hand tools to tweak such into shape. </s>
<s> If you must buy, here I use the local shops like Frys, then newegg.com and geeks.com but given your past story I wonder what's amiss. </s>
