&quot;-each time i check for errors using norton utilities, the &quot;deleting index entry&quot; line changes.&quot; i've noted that symantec has had issues in the past and you may be covering the same grounds.
just my advice... stop using the symantec item, use chkdsk to fix it (again) and see if the problem vanishes.
if it does, put in a web report to symantec about it.
ask for a free update when it comes out.
