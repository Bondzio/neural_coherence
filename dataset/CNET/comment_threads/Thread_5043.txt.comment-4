Whew!
Maybe something has changed at Epson.
About 6 months or so ago I ordered a digital projector directly from Epson.
It arrived DOA and Epson swapped out the projector overnight, without requiring me to return the first one first.
They sent a return label, etc., along with the replacement which I used to ship back the original one.
Very good service.
I'll be more careful next time, given your problems.
