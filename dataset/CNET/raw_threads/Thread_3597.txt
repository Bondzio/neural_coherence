10351	0	62688	743686	NR	royneal	2/5/05 7:35 PM	1.1076321E12	New Monitor for 3 year old computer	I now have a Dell monitor which is actually a Sony Trinitron monitor (17&quot; but not a flat panel) The picture is excellent but I really would like to have a 19&quot; flat panel monitor. I am looking at a Dell UltraSharp 1905FP monitor or maybe a Sony. I have a 32MB NVIDIA GeForce2 MX 400 AGP Graphics Card with tv-ou video card. I don't play games just want a monitor that I may occassionally watch dvd's on. Is my video card ok for the above monitors or will I not see an appreciable difference in what I already have. I have seen several Sony monitors and they look great. CNET gave the Dell a very good rating but I can't just go somewhere and see it in a store. Any suggestions. Thanks in advance. Roy in Texas

However, I would be concerned that your 32 megs of memory might be a bit weak. Flat panels also have an optimum resolution (usually termed &quot;native&quot; resolution) and 19 inch screens display a lot of pixels. You certainly don't need a high end gaming card but something a bit quicker with more memory might help reduce pauses and frame drops when running DVDs. I also like Sony monitors but the LCD I covet now is a Viewsonic VX910. This is a 19&quot; with a thin bezel and has about the best image quality of any I have seen in this size. Since the 17&quot; and 19&quot; both seem to have the same native resolutions, the 19&quot; fits my eyesight better. I also have a Princeton 19&quot; which is decent. These will use both D-sub and DVI connectors. If you go with a new video card, and I think you would be wise to do so, get one with DVI.
