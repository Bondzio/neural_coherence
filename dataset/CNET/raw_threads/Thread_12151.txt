I've set the PC/XPpro connected to the router to share a directory and a printer. The old pentium3 client was able to see the shares just fine. On my new MacBook Pro / XPpro, however, I get an error when trying to access the workgroup. A generic error only: &quot;Not accessible... might not have permissions... contact administrator...&quot;. The Mac IS able to connect to the internet via the wireless router. I found a link which says it may be Norton Anti-Virus's fault ( http://www.onecomputerguy.com/windowsxp_tips.htm#network_access_norton ), but the error or the registry entry referred to there don't exist on my host. How can I find out WHY it's not accessible, and then to go about fixing it? Thanx, Nir

No luck. should it have made a difference? Can I use some different configuration to let them communicate via ethernet? BTW, I get the above error when trying to access the WORKGROUP. When I access that workgroup on the PC, it does see the Mac as one of its members, but I get a similar error when trying to access it (the Mac from the PC - &quot;the network path was not found&quot;). Anyone know how I can solve this???

I'm suspicious of firewalls and accounts as I first noted at this discussion link. http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6122_102-0.html?forumID=44&threadID=198031&messageID=2129068 But it takes awhile for some to drill down and get that under control.
