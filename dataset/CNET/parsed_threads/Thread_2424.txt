<s> I have a Windows XP Toshiba laptop and lateley my CD burner has'nt been working. </s>
<s> I tryed using three seperate programs so far (Windows Media Player, Drag'n Drop CD+DVD, and Realplayer) to burn audio tracks or data to a CD, but they haven't worked. </s>
<s> Everytime I start up my computer I get a message that says something like &quot;to enable DVD burning, you must disable CD burning. </s>
<s> Would you like to disable this feature? </s>
<s> (yes/no). </s>
<s> I click no but CD burning still does not work. </s>
<s> I also tryed using the control panel to disable DVD burning (Control panel\System\System Properties\Hardware\Device Manager\DVD/CD-ROM Drives\MATSHITA DVD-RAM UJ-811) by configuring the property, &quot;device usage&quot;, to disable. </s>
<s> This too was to no avail. </s>
<s> I'm sure its just a simple solution of enabling my CD burning device, but I can't seem to find it in my device manager. </s>
<s> Can anybody help me out with this please? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> It still dosen't work if I click yes. </s>
<s> Also now my CD drive isnt working for some reason although my DVD drive still works. </s>
<s> When I suspect the CD/DVD drive is failing in this manner, I put in a bootable CD and attempt a boot from that. </s>
<s> No boot = dead drive. </s>
<s> This is the best test since it tells us if the drive is dead or not. </s>
<s> If the CD does boot, then we know its software. </s>

<s> I tryed a few game CDs like Rome: Total War and Ghost Recon and theres no boot, my computer just seems to try to read the CDs and theres a bunch of whirring sounds. </s>
<s> I guess this means I have a &quot;dead drive&quot; but what does that mean and how do I fix it. </s>
<s> It seemed to be working fine yesterday... </s>
<s> Your Restore CDs, many CDs with an operating system, etc. </s>
<s> Game CDs are not bootable. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Like the Microsoft Office install CD? </s>
<s> Can you give a few examples, im kinda a newbie. </s>
<s> You don't need to let any of them install, we just use this as a test. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I tryed it and there's no boot. </s>
<s> And when I click on D drive in My Computer I get the message &quot;D:\ is not accessible. </s>
<s> The request could not be completed because of an I/O device error.&quot; </s>
<s> Since I shared a list, you'll have to try harder or take it to a shop. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Ah damn Oh well, thanks for the help though! </s>
