hello i'm looking to invest in a tablet i love my laptop but its battery life just can't compete and i need something i can use while traveling for reading, surfing, movies, and listening to audiobooks with.
i don't really know much about my options out there so i'm hoping to draw on your knowledge by listing my wants and must have features hopefully you all can give me a decent set of options or even narrow it down to the perfect unit so i can invest with confidence;) battery life is important obviously but not as important as the unit need to be able to charge via the usb port it can have a separate power plug but it has to be able to charge if i plug it into a usb power supply.
7&quot;-10&quot; screen size not really that important but a smaller hand held that's still fairly easy on the eyes is what i'm aiming for.
decently durable i'll have it in a protective hard shell case and try to take care so it doesn't have to live up to tuff book specs but something that can go in my daypack/bike panniers without falling apart.
i don't know if this is even an option on any tablets or not but i'd like to be able to connect an external hard drive via usb if i can't that's ok but i'd like the tablet to have at least 4gb(8+would be better)on board and it has to be expandable with sd cards i'd prefer to be able to use full size sd cards but it i have to invest in some more micro well ok i don't really care about which os it runs as long as its stable can watch video(youtube, megavideo ect as well as downloaded movies ) surf the internet, organizing mp3, reading pdf, doc, and txt other ebook formats would be cool too but as long as it can read those i'll be happy.
as far as speed i want something that's fairly fast so a decent processor speed and memory are desirable.
i would love it if i could add on a keyboard at some point i've seen a few bluetooth type that look cool whether it connects that way or some other i'd really like this feature but its not a deal breaker if i can't have it i hope that's not too much to ask if i could get it in hand (retail, new, used whatever but with price including shipping)for less than 250?
if the unit stood out enough i might be talked into going as high as $300 but i'm between jobs so i have limited resources.
thanks adam ps moderators if this post would fit better on another sub forum or it would get more of a response someplace else could you move it please?
