Worked great untill i insallted a crap progame it came with called greeting card. From there the printer stopped printing so i uninstalled all the HP software and deleted all the USB root thingys in device manager restarted and still i got an error &quot;This device has malfunction and windows does not recogonise it&quot; After tyring everything and being convice its the old PC i bought a new one. This time when i connect the printer it says &quot;unknown device&quot;, &quot;the new hardware is installed and ready to use&quot;, &quot;this device has malfuncion and windows does not recogonise it&quot; So back to the old drawing board i went with deleted USB root thingys. I made sure the BIOS is set to recogonise all usb devices. I'm at wits end, can someone please provide me on somethings i can try?

U will need to install the chipset drivers if u have ur motherboard disk then install the printer software with the printer connected to it...FOllow the instructions in the manual u got with the printer....
