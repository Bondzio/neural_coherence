1.1.2	I've got two DVD burners in my Intel Mac, and when I insert DVDs burned in that Mac, they are not recognized.	St
1.1.3	I've got 16 GB RAM, and I'm running Snow Leopard.	St
1.1.4	I've deleted all the burning software (Toast 10 Titanium) and I've had the hardware and memory tested at a Genius Bar.	St
1.1.5	It all passed OK.	St
1.1.6	I think I may need some kind of hardware re-set, but I don't know how to proceed.	St
1.1.7	Something that may or not be relevant to this: my computer won't ever re-start.	St

1.1.9	I always must start up using the power button.	St
1.1.10	Any ideas from anyone?	St

1.2.4	If so connect one of the Optical drives and repeat.	St
1.2.5	Keep going until you find the culprit.	St
1.2.6	As these things are so cheap now, it would probably not break the bank to replace them with something faster and more versatile.	St
