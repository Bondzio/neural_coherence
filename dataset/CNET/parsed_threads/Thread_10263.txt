<s> Hi there, I have tried to install my CX3200 on my vista laptop with the drivers CD that came with the printer - but it didn't work. </s>
<s> Now i have read on the Epson website &quot;DO NOT USE THE CD THAT CAME WITH YOUR PRINTER!&quot; But they don't explain what to do if you HAVE done this! </s>
<s> Anyone know how I can remove the old drivers and install the correct ones? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance Martin </s>
<s> 1. unplug the printer and in the printer control panel right click and remove, delete, uninstall (pick what shows up.) </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Now I boot safe mode, check that again and in the device manager and remove it if found. </s>
<s> Finally with the printer unplugged I install the new drivers per Epson's notes. </s>

<s> Trouble is Epson say &quot;plug the printer in and let the wizard automatically install from the internet&quot; But it never mentions the internet but just tries to reinstall the drivers that were previously installed!! </s>
<s> Cheers </s>

<s> As I say, it just wouldn't take the drivers for some reason </s>
<s> Now share the error message when you run the installer for your printer from that download. </s>
<s> Remember we can't see or know all you did. </s>
