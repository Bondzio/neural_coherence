My old board supports USB but its Award BIOS 4.51 did not include usb in its boot sequence. Boot options are: LZ/ZIP, SCSI, cdrom, A, C, D, and all logical drives No usb boot but the mobo supports it. Which software can I use to create USB bootable files to replace sluggish floppy disk or replace the zip option?

However there are many solutions available such as DSL (damm small linux) which details how to make a bootable USB memory key and more. I can't tell which article to share since the goal is not well defined. Bob

Without USB boot capability in that BIOS, this is a dead end. &quot;My Award4.51 BIOS does NOT have USB boot in its menu&quot; In closing, making an USB DOS boot memory key is found with ease on google.com, but given your statement there's no reason to continue.
