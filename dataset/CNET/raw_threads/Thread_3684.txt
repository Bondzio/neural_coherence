Already added more memory and was thinking about upgrading the video card. The motherboard only has a 4X AGP slot and most cards I'm interested in are 8X. If I put in an 8X will I run into any problems?

I use...	newegg.com and geeks.com But I still prefer cards from this list -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/12/03/best_graphics_card/ Keep in mind the repeating issue I see is not AGP motherboard issues but the weakling power supplies.

As far as AGP cards. I have found them all over the place. As long as an 8x cards works in a 4x slot I'm good.
