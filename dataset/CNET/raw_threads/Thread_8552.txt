11830	0	589911	5443523	NR	Anthlive	4/1/13 5:40 AM	1.3647948E12	Which config mac to buy?	I'm looking into the 13 inch Retina MBP (8GB ram) and the 15 inch Retina MBP (16GB ram). The most I may do is run windows 7 on a virtual machine, and skype. Size doesn't matter. I'm aware of the price difference. Are they still having that screen problem? Can you please give me some advice on which to choose. Thank you.
