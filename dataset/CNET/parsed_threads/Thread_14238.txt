<s> I am looking for an external hard drive to back my pictures and music to. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> I would like to keep the price under $150. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Keep in mind I like the word backup but these externals are still not reliable enough to call them storage. </s>
<s> They are pretty reliable but one drop or oops delete and your last copy is gone. </s>
<s> I see many under 99 buck externals on amazon,. </s>
<s> newegg and at the stores so it's easy to get one and backup what you have today. </s>

<s> Ok, so they are not as reliable as a computer hard drive? </s>
<s> Am I understanding you correctly? </s>
<s> Are there other options? </s>
<s> I have a site online where I keep my photos and I have them on my desktop hard drive as well. </s>
<s> But my desktop is getting very old and I seldom use it, except to store pics/music. </s>
<s> Because inside a computer it has a case to take the brunt of the impact. </s>
<s> Folk that drive their copies down to ONE LAST COPY on any single device tend to lose them all. </s>
<s> If you have an old machine and use this for a backup copy, that's a good idea. </s>
<s> But it's only the first line of defense. </s>
<s> Here I have our family photo collection on no less than 3 devices. </s>

<s> I see. </s>
<s> What do you mean by &quot;one last copy&quot;? </s>
<s> I've never had any problems losing music or photos...of course I realize that doesn't mean it could happen. </s>
<s> I'm just afraid my desktop will give up some day. </s>
<s> If you move your files to this external for &quot;storage&quot; and have them only there, that's the last copy. </s>
<s> If you copy them there as &quot;backup&quot; then if your PC fails, you have a copy to bring back to your new system. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Ok, yes I understand what you are saying. </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
