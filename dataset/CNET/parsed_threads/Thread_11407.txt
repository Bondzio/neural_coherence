<s> Hello, I'm in the market to buy a Netbook for web-surfing and checking email. </s>
<s> Can someone please recommend a 10'' Netbook that can play Hulu content with no issues? </s>
<s> Or should I look at lower end laptops? </s>
<s> Thank you in advance. </s>
<s> It's the old one with XP, 1GB ram. </s>
<s> OK, it works but I'd like to see it on the newer machines. </s>
<s> Ask others to try it. </s>
<s> The new HP mini 311 with Nvidia ion graphics performance has no problem streaming flash videos such as Hulu, check out a review here, http://newnetbookreviews.net/2009/hp-inspiron-mini-311/ </s>
