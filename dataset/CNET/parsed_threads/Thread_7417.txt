<s> My machine (HP 9340, Vista 64-bit, home premium) has one empty PCI slot. </s>
<s> I have several external drives that have both a USB and eSATA input connector. </s>
<s> I've seen eSATA PCI cards with 4 eSATA ports. </s>
<s> Will I see better performance on transfer speeds between drives and the computer, if I install such a card? </s>
<s> That is, with all four ports connected to drives, and running? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> but saddled on the pci bus, i doubt you will see much (if any) improvement especially since most pci-sata cards use controllers that perform rather poorly. </s>

<s> be better of using something like http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16812206003 No PCI card needed if you have unused SATA connectors on the MB. </s>

<s> I looked inside the box, and with the other drives hooked to the MB, I've only got one free socket left. </s>
<s> If I put a 1 port eSATA to this, would a 1-in, 5-out eSATA hub work to give me more outlets and still provide the faster transfer speeds? </s>
<s> Something like this: http://www.cooldrives.com/sahub5muussi.html </s>
<s> Before spending $100 on an eSATA HUB, I'd try it direct with the device suggested and check the results. </s>
<s> Next I'd look at all the alternatives to see if that's truly the best approach to my storage and backup requirements. </s>
<s> With the multitude of problems I see with externals ... </s>
<s> I much prefer to utilize internals where possible. </s>
<s> Keep us posted on the outcome. </s>
