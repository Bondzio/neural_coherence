I cannot see anything to switch it back. I tried to delete the theme, but it is still on my desktop and showing black windows. How can I remove this theme?

Could also be the case where the program was actually a virus, in which case, I would follow the wisdom of Grif (post 4 of 8) http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6122_102-0.html?threadID=389911&tag=forums06;forum-threads

Cannot see the display property window/themes to change the &quot;theme&quot;. Having to guess where the ok/cancel buttons are. It's in the &quot;owners&quot; profile. Is there a way to unload personal settings for all of the users on a windows XP Home Edition OS?

I created another profile, documented the key commands in the display property dialog box, and chose a plain windows theme. Went back into the problem profile and went through the steps. It worked! This got rid of the corrupt theme and fixed the issue. My thought .. there may have been some files missing on the problem theme that caused a glitch. Thank you for all of your help! Sincerely, Scharry PS. No more 3rd party themes!
