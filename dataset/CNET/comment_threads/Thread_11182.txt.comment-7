Should also be noted a slight bias since the mobo MSI RS480M2-IL (7093) has the ATI Radeon Integrated (on board) graphics, so naturally puts in the box (as other have indicated) a discount coupon for an ATI PCIe graphics card.
The mobo has a PCI-Express x16 graphics slot and can accept a Nvidia PCI-Express card which should perform without any problems.
