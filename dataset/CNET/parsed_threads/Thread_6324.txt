<s> I have a Intel 865PERLL board and would like to know what is the fastest processor I can use. </s>
<s> I have lost track of the terms used anymore so it would help me if you could link to the fastest processor and maybe one a little slower if there is a large price difference. </s>
<s> Thank you Gene </s>
<s> It's the first question noted at http://www.intel.com/design/motherbd/rl/rl_inst.htm Try that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> This is the only fast processor that fits the board. </s>
<s> http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=80663&affiliate=yahoo I told you I have been away from this sort of thing for a while. </s>
<s> And about all I got from that link was I need a CPU with 512 L2 cache. </s>
<s> (Northwood) And this is the only fast processor I could find that fits that bill. </s>
<s> (I think) Thanks </s>
<s> that you have? </s>
<s> It sure seems that the link that Robert gave you shows the answers to your question. </s>
<s> Why did you limit it to the link that you sent? </s>
<s> But My board # is AAC27646-206 which seems to rule out the top 8 processors on the list or am I missing something? </s>
<s> It seems I can only use a CPU with 512 L2 cache or again do I not understand? </s>
<s> And after googling the only CPU I could find like that over 3 gb was that board. </s>
<s> And its too expensive I can almost get a new board and CPU for that price. </s>
<s> Does that board require the Northwood CPU? </s>
<s> Thanks again </s>
