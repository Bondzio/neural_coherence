<s> hi, I just bought a t6212, and wanted to upgrade the graphics card. </s>
<s> I was thinking aboutthe Ati x800xl. </s>
<s> But anyways, will I have a problem using this card? </s>
<s> The card I believe calls for a 420 watt power supply. </s>
<s> Does anyone know the power supply on the t6212 and if this would pose a problem? </s>
<s> That card plugs into a normal PCI Express slot on the motherboard. </s>
<s> I don't think the power supply has anything to do with it. </s>
<s> Forget about what it &quot;calls for.&quot; Computers don't use nearly as much power as they claim. </s>
<s> a 300 watt supply is more than enough for any system. </s>
<s> Besides, one graphics card hardly makes a dent... </s>
<s> get the card and plug it in...if runs fine then no problem. </s>
<s> however if playin a intensive game and computer restarts or sudden restarts happen for no apparent reason, consider getting a new power supply. </s>
<s> The emachine T6212 comes with a 300W power supply. </s>
<s> The ATI x800xl is a fine card. </s>
<s> SeaninWA in this theard installed a x899xl and didn't mention upgrading the PS: http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7586-0.html?forumID=68&threadID=104179&messageID=1194079 Someone else in that thread, rickgut2004, installed a 450W power supply with his T6212. </s>
<s> If you have problems, then of course increase the PS. </s>
<s> Graphics card is bascially just one little chip. </s>
<s> With no moving parts, unlike a harddisk, how much power would it really consume? </s>
<s> I've heard of people using larger powersources, but only for these really weird servers with dozens of harddisk arrays connected to one machine. </s>
<s> 300W comes standard. </s>
<s> How much more do you need? </s>
<s> It depends on the power supply. </s>
<s> Some are weak (low cost ones) even at 450W and can't supply a continuous amount to handle the additional stuff. </s>
<s> When a factory puts out a computer they try to match the power supply for what they have installed at the time of delivery. </s>
<s> So, if you start adding stuff like high end video cards and other things then that particular PS may not pass the muster. </s>

<s> oh yeah? </s>
<s> and so what drives the fan on this? </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> A fan is a fan, how much power would that consume? </s>
<s> ^_^ </s>
<s> just a little more than this --&gt; Graphics card is bascially just one little chip. </s>
<s> With no moving parts . </s>
