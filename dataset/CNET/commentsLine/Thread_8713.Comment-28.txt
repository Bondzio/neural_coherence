i clean my computer when i have it open for some other reason.
i like to play with it, so that seems to average once every 4 or five months, and that is more than enough.
our house seems to be dustier than average, but i keep the area around the computer clean.
you can purchase vacuums and compressors made specifically for electronics, but for occasional use the cans of 'compressed air' are a lot cheaper and work just fine.
if you have some especially tenacious dust, try loosening it gently with a soft paintbrush.
using household or shop vacuums is hazardous because of static and also the physical hazard of using the large/awkward hoses and attachments that come with them.
using a compressor that was designed for shop/industrial use is also quite dangerous for electronics.
these compressors can spit quite a lot of water, and rust and debris from the tank and hose come out at very high speed.
even at 30 psi, you are applying more force-per-area than if you were standing on your motherboard on one foot.
$8.00 for a can of air seems like a lot, but it's a lot cheaper than a broken computer.
if you don't have, or can't get the right tools to do the job, you should probably either leave it or else hire a professional to do it for you.
