<s> If I have wireless broadband internet by using a PC card (Sony Ericsson GC83 or Sierra Wireless AirCard 775, etc. </s>
<s> )in my desktop, can I set up a home network so that I can use the internet wirelessly on my laptop? </s>
<s> The laptop has a built-in network card already. </s>
<s> How can I set up the network? </s>
<s> Windows XP is on both computers. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> Sorry MadisonAVE, I'm not clear on what you're asking. </s>
<s> Do you have two computers that currently have wireless network cards in them? </s>
<s> How do they get to the Internet? </s>
<s> Who provides your access? </s>
<s> The desktop (Sony W700G all-in-one model) has the wireless PC card (T-Mobile Internet service) and the laptop has the wireless LAN card built in. </s>
<s> I want to use the wireless service on the laptop without having to remove the card from the desktop. </s>
<s> What kind of router would I need to network the two computers? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I think those cards use EDGE cellular service. </s>
<s> You might want to ask your EDGE service provider (Cingular?) </s>
<s> if they recommend a router for those cards. </s>
<s> OPTION 1: The ''Junxion Box'' should get you there, but it is expensive: http://reviews.cnet.com/Junxion_Box_JB_110B/4505-3319_7-31292890.html?tag=box http://www.junxion.com/product/ OPTION 2 (not sure about this one): You are saying that the desktop uses an EDGE card? </s>
<s> If so, I don't know if you can bridge the desktop's EDGE card to its wired network adapter. </s>
<s> If this can be done, you should be able to use Windows XP's Internet Connection Sharing (ICS). </s>
<s> Internet ~ ~ ~ (EDGE card) Desktop (network adapter) ----- wireless router ~ ~ ~ laptop This option just requires the purchasing of an inexpensive wireless router. </s>
<s> Again, I'm not sure about the bridging part. </s>
