It does not provide a wireless Internet connection. I must plug in a network cable. The problem is my computer is located in another room, and on another floor. I have a wireless router connected to computer now though. Is there anything I can do to get my Blu-Ray player connected to the Internet?

Yes it's not as good as a DVD when you skip chapters as you have seconds to wait as the buffers fill. Is that your &quot;not all that great&quot; issue? Bob

I want to stream movies through my Samsung Blu Ray from Costco which does not have a wireless adapter but can plug hardwire but I can't get cable to the TV area. Everybody tells me to buy a Roku, but I hate to do it if networking will solve my problem. Which would you recommend: - Netgear Powerline AV200 adapter XAV2001-bridge or - Netgear Powerline AV 200 Wireless-N Extender Kit XAVNB2001 or is there something else I should be looking at?
