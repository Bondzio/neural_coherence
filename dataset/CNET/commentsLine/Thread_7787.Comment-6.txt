luke, which programs are you closing?
i have maxed my cpu by having 15+ tabs open in firefox along with 3 other applications i have up and running.
for me this is normal as this system was an emergency build: althon xp 2.0 on a gigabyte m/b with 512 mb memory.
look in the control panel/ fast find and turn this feature off.
look in msconfg/ startup tab, reduce the number of applications starting with windows.
in task manager, open the performace tab/ view and check show kernal times.
this will show you if it is windows or an application using the cpu.
you are running an hp ... i've yet to see any of these systems have good performace.
too many bottlenecks.... slow memory and m/b are the largest contributers.
you may have to just live with the hi cpu cycles.
