<s> ZIP 100 USB with WIN XP For some reason one of my zip disks refuses to be recognised by windows explorer. </s>
<s> it comes up insert disk or protected. </s>
<s> Right clicking on any of my zip disks, will not give me the protect/unprotect option. </s>
<s> I have downloaded the latest software from iomega but no difference. </s>
<s> Could this be a dodgy disk ? </s>
<s> When I right click this disk and look at properties it says 0 bytes and a file system of RAW. </s>
<s> Any sugestions on recovering this disk. </s>
<s> Pick over http://www.google.com/search?&q=+site%3awww.spinrite.com+ZIP to see if you find an answer, but media doesn't last forever... Bob </s>
<s> Zip drives used to come with software on one of ZIP disks in the bundle. </s>
<s> This disk was the Tools disk and was protected as it had the installation software on it. </s>
<s> Included was a utility to &quot;unlock&quot; the disk so you could use it like any other. </s>
<s> Is it possible this could be one of those protected disks? </s>
<s> If so, Iomega software utilities might be able to unlock it. </s>
<s> Just a thought...Good luck. </s>
