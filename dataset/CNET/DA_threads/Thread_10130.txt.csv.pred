1.1.1	I am building a computer with an Asus TXP4-X motherboard , which I do not know how to connect to the case .	St

1.2.1	& quot ; I am building a computer with an Asus TXP4-X motherboard , which I do not know how to connect to the case. & quot ; In not many words , the speaker connector goes the speaker connection , the reset connector to the reset connection and the ATX power switch connector goes to the Power Sw connection .	St
1.2.2	The LED indicators are somewhat optional and if they do n't light up , try rotating the connector .	St
1.2.3	In closing , there are other extra connectors or connections .	St
1.2.4	This might confuse a new builder .	St

1.3.1	Quick lesson , black is usually GRD , NC , means no connection at that pin , any LED connection usually two wires if it does n't work one way , swap them around , same for other connections .	St
1.3.2	If a connector has more/less of a width problem or mounted differently , understand some connectors are & quot ; keyed & quot ; in order to mount .	St
1.3.3	Draw a picture to better understand how the connections are displayed if just & quot ; listed & quot ; ( ie : J4 to speaker ) pins 1-4 Oh yeah , work under good lighting , brother that helps .	St
1.3.4	There , clear as mud .	St
