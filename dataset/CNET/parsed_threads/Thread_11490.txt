<s> Is there a pgm. </s>
<s> or such that can &quot;soft boiler plate&quot; the flash drive. </s>
<s> Meaning, once accessed, a sign of the owner can be seen. </s>
<s> Something like ghost print over a letter size page showing its origin. </s>
<s> It can be called a &quot;water mark&quot; sorta thing, I really can't explain it well. </s>
<s> I hope I made sense. </s>
<s> The display of say some picture is shown then in the backgrd. </s>
<s> from XYZ studio in very light display. </s>
<s> I include any text display as well. </s>
<s> Its not part of the actual data, but the flash drive is giving its Identity as in XYZ studio. </s>
<s> TIA -----Willy just wondering </s>
<s> something in the line which announces the ownership of the flash drive? </s>
<s> Not sure whether the .inf file does that, as like sony or similar manufacturer, they produces their own particular 'signature' to it through the inf auto-run file. </s>
<s> But it could be bypassed. </s>
<s> Not very sure whether Win7 bitlocker works. </s>
<s> the other would be physically print on the cover of the device itself... lol... </s>
<s> I've seen in actual printout to paper like, customer, retailer, etc. </s>
<s> each has large ghost print to ID the bill for example. </s>
<s> In others, I've seen this is displays from websites that show a picture and the website IDs the source as from them. </s>
<s> I would think the flash drive itself would have the pgm. </s>
<s> build-in as my thinking goes. </s>
<s> So far, no clue as to a source of such a product, boiler plate does come up, but no reference to a thumb drive. </s>
<s> Thanks -----Willy </s>
