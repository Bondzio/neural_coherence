it would seem that the &quot;smaller&quot; maxtor harddrives have this noise thing, 60g and smaller.
i had 4 120g maxtor harddrives, 2 made the same clicking noise, i sent them to maxtor and they replaced them, since then i haven't had the clicking noise at all.
i believe that since hard drives are getting cheaper and the manufacturers are trying to still make a profit (of course) they have cut down on the quality to ensure quantity.
it's really too bad that you had 3 fail on you but it doesn't seem all that uncommon.
i would suggest contacting maxtor and demanding they not only replace the hard drives, but that they replace them with brand new drives (they usually send out refurbished ones), and the latest models rather than just replacing the same one over and over.
they should send you new ones since you've already replaced them once.
p.s.
since the replacement of my 2 failing drives, i have had no problems whatso ever, and when i requested they be replaced by brand new drives, they complied.
