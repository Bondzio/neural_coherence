1.1.1	My Compaq Presario 5BWN21 desktop PC has been having problems with the CD-RW drive.	St
1.1.2	Last night I had to go inside of the tower to look at the hard drive, which means in my case, I had to remove the CD-RW drive.	St
1.1.3	Anyway, i got the computer back together and everything was fine except for the CD-RW drive.	St
1.1.4	All of the cables are hooked up, and it blinks and lights up at startup, but Windows 98Se dosen't detect it.	St
1.1.5	I went under the System Icon and checked the device maganger and it dosen't list it.	St

1.1.7	I contacted Compaq and they told me to boot into safe mode and uninstall the drivers there.	St
1.1.8	I tried to do that; the computer will not let me boot into saft mode; however, when I woke up this morning, it let me boot into safe mode.	St
1.1.9	Then everything started to work; I got the thing to work, then the computer froze and I had to restart; once again, it wouldn't let me boot into safe mode.	St
1.1.10	I contacted Compaq again, they told me to make a Win 98 Bootable Diskette so I could restore the computer to an earlier time; i did that.	St
