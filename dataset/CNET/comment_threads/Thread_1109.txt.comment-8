You can order online, but I prefer locally as I get it now and install it and quality is pretty good.
Depending on your locale, Besy Buy, Fry's, and/or Circuit City should carry fans and gosh, RadioShaft .
Buy a &quot;ball bearing or magnetic type&quot; fan, avoid any &quot;sleeve bearing&quot;, brand is up to you.
Google for online source, I beleive FrozenCPU and NewEgg are decent vendors.
happy USA -----Willy
