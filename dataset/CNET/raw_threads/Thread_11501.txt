I want to standardize all computers with the same operating system, software, and files. I want complete consistency with all computers. These are all personal machines. I have Norton Ghost but am not familiar with it. How do I migrate disk images or my laptop's information for other computers, so they are all the same?

Now take Office 2003/2007 from one machine to another. It wants you to activate it. There's a sign here that this OS and many applications are designed to fail when you do this. Bob

Unless the computers are identical in almost every way, the OS fails. Then small differences in the ethernet MAC address, the hard disk serial number and such can cause XP to want to reactivate along with any other software that employs &quot;activation.&quot; What you want has been disabled at far too many levels for anyone to get fixes today. There is a way if you were to move to a non-Windows OS. Is that an option? There is also the Virtual Machine method. Look at VMWARE's offerings. You could have a standard issue virtual machine. But the time lost on deploying that could be a few man years. Hope this sheds some light on the issue. Bob
