I have tried SEVERAL times to load the software (from the CD) and according to HP an icon in the tray shows an X across it means that the drivers are unable to communicate with the scanner. I have disconnected and reconnected the scanner several tmes and still nothing. BTW I am usng a paraell port and have a Cannon printer connected to the scanner and I am able to print via this connection.
