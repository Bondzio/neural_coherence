I'm having some trouble with my wireless network: I use a Planet WL-8303 Wireless PCI Adapter to connect to a WAP-1963 Wireless Acess Point (which is about 3.5 Km away) which in turn is connected to a computer hooked up to the internet. For a long time this setting has worked out for me and I have been acessing the internet without any problem whatsoever. But for no apparent reason, my computer detects that there is a network (WEP enabled and with network authentication - no news for me here) avaliable but it just doesn't connect to it. Only SOMETIMES. By that, I mean that out of the blue I suddenly get connected to the network and some time later (which varies from minutes to hours) I get disconnected for no reason whatsoever. And not to mention that the connection is extremely slow! I've tried changing the PCI card in to different slots, tried fidling with the cable that connects to the antenna, tried fiddling with the antenna itself. The same problem persists on a Windows system as it does on a Linux Ubuntu system. I just want to stress that it was working fine just the way it was, and for some reason it has been giving me problemas. The hosting computer (with the AP) hasn't even been touched in the past few months, so I believe the problem lies somewhere between the AP and my computer. Here's some info of my pc: Windows Xp / Linux Ubuntu Dapper Drake AMD Athlon 1.24Ghz, 512 Mb RAM WL-8303 Wireless PCI Adapter, WEB enabled, Shared authentication, Power save: none, Fragment threshold: 2432, RTS threshold: 2346, Wireless mode: 802.11b, Preamble mode: long, Channel plan: FCC, Data rate: auto, channel 11, frequency 2462MHz, network type: infrastructure. Any suggestions will be greatly apreciated!

You may have to change or improve your equipment. Yes it worked in the past. Now you get to adjust for today's RF environment. I fear the fix will not be cheap given the 3.5 Km link. But since it was done before, let the person who built it come up with a new solution. I also hear you when you say it works sometimes. An interferring signal can be on &quot;sometimes.&quot; To find that will be costly. I know the last time I was on such a hunt it was with 20 other engineers and vans full of gear for Motorola. When someone wants to find the interferring source, they better be ready to pay. In closing the cheap fix could be to replace each part with known good parts. You may exclaim that's costly but troubleshooting and finding the interference is assuredly more costly by at least 10 to 100 times. Bob
