1.1.1	I 'm currently using a IBM Thinkpad T30 , with the & quot ; Cisco Sytems PCI Wireless LAN Adapter , & quot ; Windows XP SP2 .	St
1.1.2	My problem is that whenever I move my laptop the wireless will drop : I get the message , & quot ; Limited or No Connection. & quot ; It can be a distance of only about 1 foot , but will definitely occur if I change rooms .	St
1.1.3	I have to use the repair function every time this happens .	St
1.1.4	After repairing , the laptop 's internet will reconnect and will work again -- until I move it .	St
1.1.5	This is very inconvenient and I do n't know what 's causing it .	St
1.1.6	The drivers are updated and the wireless connection is managed through windows .	St
1.1.7	The signal strength from my router is also strong throughout the house .	St
1.1.8	Any help on how to maintain my wireless connection as I move about ?	Ques
1.1.9	house ?	Ques
1.2.1	Where you router or access point is located could make a big difference .	St
1.2.2	You could try moving it .	Sug
1.2.3	Next , change it 's broadcast channel .	St
1.2.4	Since the T-30 is an older model , I wonder if you 're using wireless & quot ; a & quot ; as these do n't have the range of b/g .	St
1.3.1	Thanks for replying !	St
1.3.2	I do n't think it has to do with the location of the router -- I can be sitting right next to it and move my computer off of my lap and it will go into limited-connection mode .	St
1.3.3	Other laptops in the house do n't have this problem either .	St
1.3.4	I 'm on channel 6 because other houses are on 1 and 10 .	St
1.3.5	How can I check if my laptop is on & quot ; a & quot ; like you said ?	Ques
1.3.6	The router is set to & quot ; 11b/11g standard & quot ; mode .	St
1.3.7	The only other option on the router is & quot ; G enhanced & quot ; which I do n't think is what I 'm looking for .	St
1.4.1	you did n't mention you had other laptops that did n't exhibit this issue .	St
1.4.2	I could think you might have an antenna connection problem within the laptop .	St
1.4.3	The wiring generally stretches from the PCI board up into the display .	St
1.4.4	This means it flexes when you open and close the laptop and these wires break .	St
1.4.5	As well , sometimes the plug/jack connection on the wifi adapter is n't the greatest .	St
1.4.6	Since laptops move and flex , any mechanical connection can become intermittent .	St
1.4.7	Your moving the laptop could cause a momentary signal loss requiring it to reconnect .	St
1.4.8	Now , if your router is b/g , your laptop runs in one of these modes so & quot ; a & quot ; is n't in the picture .	St
1.5.1	then are you suggesting that the only solution is to replace the hardware ?	Ques
1.5.2	The connection is very stable when the computer is stationary , and continues to work again after using 'repair ' .	St
1.5.3	Because of this , I was wondering if there 's a software issue where the computer or wireless card does n't manage to automatically update its connection after a shift in location , resulting in me having to do it manually .	St
1.5.4	Is there anything that I can check on to confirm with the problem is ?	Ques
1.5.5	Such as opening the laptop etc .	St
1.6.1	Instead of doing the repair , just turn it off and back on to see if it reconnects .	St
1.6.2	It might be the repair you are doing is n't really the cure .	St
1.6.3	If this happens only with one laptop and you have others that work fine , I 'd focus on that laptop first .	St
1.7.1	there 's no button or shortcut on the T30 to turn on/off the wireless .	St
1.7.2	I can only disable it through Hardware Devices .	St
1.8.1	instead of doing the connection repair .	St
1.8.2	Another thing you might try is to see if moving the laptop in such a way that flexing is minimized .	Sug
1.8.3	Put it on a cart and transport it slowly .	St
1.8.4	You need to isolate the root cause and if it 's an antenna dropout due to a broken wire or poor connection , this might help verify that .	St
