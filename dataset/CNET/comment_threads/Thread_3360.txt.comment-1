I have 2 new Toshiba laptops, a L45-S7423, and a A205-S7468, they are running vista.
They are connected wirelessly.
They will both connect to the internet, however, only the A205-one will print on (new) HP7280 printer.
In Control panel Network and Sharing page, the settings are identical on both computers.
I also have an older HP desktop, which runs XP and is connected to the router with an ethernet cable.. it will also print wirelessly on the printer.
I don't understand why!!
What do I do???
HELP
