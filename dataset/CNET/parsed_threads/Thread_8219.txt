<s> Hi all, I just assembly a new PC with dual processor to run 3DS Max but the render speed is almost the same with my old i5 PC, any idea what go wrong? </s>
<s> please see below the specification of both pc: New PC Processor: Dual Xeon E5606 2.13GHz (4 core) Mother board: Asus server board Z8NA-D6 RAM: 6 nos of Kingston DDR 3 PC1333 4GB Graphic: Leadtek Winfast Nvidia Quadro 2000D 1GB Hardisk: Corsair 120GB Sata 3 force solid state (OS) + WD 1TB (data) Power: Seasonic 1050 watts X Series PSU OS: Windows 7 ultimate Programe: 3DS max Render time with 3DS max: 1 hour 37 mins Old PC Processor: i5-2300 2.8GHz (4 core) Mother board: Gigabyte GA81945P-G RAM: 3 nos of Kingston DDR 3 2GB Graphic: Gigabyte Nvidia Geforce GTS 450 1GB Hardisk: WD 1 TB Power: Don't know what model OS: Windows 7 ultimate Programe: 3DS max + other programs Render time with 3DS max: 1 hour 53 mins I can't believe that the difference in render time is only 16 min!!! </s>
<s> Any thing go wrong with the hardware? </s>
<s> Thanks a lot for your help! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Years ago we had two identical machines. </s>
<s> One had 512MB RAM and the other 1024MB RAM. </s>
<s> Back then the render time was 6 hours on the 512MB RAM. </s>
<s> We wondered what would happen if we ran the render on both machines then swapped RAM, did the test again and see the results. </s>
<s> The results were identical on both machines with the results tracking the installed RAM. </s>
<s> The machine with 512MB RAM rendered the work in 6 hours (almost exactly). </s>
<s> The machine with 1024MB RAM finished 5 minutes earlier. </s>
<s> For that time or year of the PC this showed the bottleneck was not in the RAM for this render. </s>
<s> Fast forward to your machine. </s>
<s> The faster machine was 16% faster which shows that the 31 percent faster clock rate wasn't directly affecting or a factor. </s>
<s> Remember that I don't want to write that the i5 is only 2 cores with 4 threads dive into computer design. </s>
<s> I won't do that here. </s>
<s> --&gt; The results are as expected. </s>
<s> If you wanted more payback you might have checked out transcoding using the GPU or asked if there was a way to be sure that all cores are at work. </s>
<s> BEWARE that many CODECS will crash on multi-core, multi-thread calls so when that happens I can't help you as you must talk to the author/company of the CODEC. </s>
<s> My answer? </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> Seems right to me. </s>
<s> In other words, nothing funky with those results. </s>
