Bob, I have been talking with them for over a week now, they won't talk on phone because my router is about a year old out of their coverage time.....
I recently have been elevated to L2 tech services....Bob, all I get is the standard responses...They tried to get me to upgrade firmware also.....On the router you can do an auto check for upgrades....This said no upgrades avail....I then went to the specified firmware....the tech said it would be a zip file and to unzip...yadda,yadda......I looked at the file and it is a .bin.....one that is set for auto updates....no help, I still followed their suggestions.....didn't install, I do not think the problem is with my router...I have tried to use the HP at other locations, ie coffee shops....I have been to 5 or 6 and the hp works with every one....except one....When I asked the lady what brand router they had...You quessed it Netgear.....
This is a company wide problem with netgear and all their routers and the fact that they are incompatable with the dv8210us.....I wish someone at CNET could get one on a loan basis and I feel confidant that they will experience the same problem....If they don't then I have a warranty issue for sure.
One thing you left out is that HP has told me they don't support netgear......I think the implied thing is they don't support for my model..
I sure wish I could talk with someone who has a reputation and respect of the comunnity.....Everyone just thinks I am a ignorant user with a axe to grind.....I assure you I am not and I really like the Netgear products....When I first got the router and pcmcia card it was great to have 3 bands of transmission.....
Regardless of what happens the next router I get will be A/B/G and it might be the latest (nimo, I think is the designation).
I thank you for your interest and responses.
I have emailed the CEO at HP.....well not to him but to his agents....I have not had response yet.....
I am going to try the same thing with Netgear.
