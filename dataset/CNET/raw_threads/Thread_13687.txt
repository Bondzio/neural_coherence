It is 1080p ready and has analog and digital TV tuner. I thought it was great when one of my collegues proposed to sell me his 36-37 inch LG TV second hand at a very good price. Will this be an acceptable/good computer monitor? I have a HP 2510p notebook which I plan to hook it up to, will it work with it? Will it be any different with a regular LCD monitor? Will it have a glare problem if I do reading with it? Is it ok to buy a 1-1.5 year old LCD tv at half present market price? Would it be outdated in a general sense? Any tips to make it work at its best whether monitor or tv? Thank you.

Use the VGA out on your laptop + a standard VGA (dsub) cable. A heads-up: resolution on TVs is lower than computer monitors, in the sense of pixel size. Which is just fine because we usually sit next to our computers, but view TV from a distance. So it's not any different than a regular LCD monitor, but it is what it is. 1080 lines is great for TV, not going to be crystal sharp up close as a computer monitor at that scale. For a business/mobile style laptop, even a 19&quot; monitor will feel like a nice big screen when working at a desk, so I'm confident you'd like the 22&quot; LG, too. But hey, bigger is better, eh.
