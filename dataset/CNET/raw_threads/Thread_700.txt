I'm investigating the best way to provide connectivity between two locations 2200' apart, with at least 2 sub-locations at each end. The current plan is pulling rg6 and cat6, but I'm not sure that would even work? I'd like to see a wireless implementation, possibly including VoIP phones at the remote location. There are 2 phone lines into the main house only, though the 'barn' could be wired, too. I'm thinking satellite broadband, distributed wirelessly. It's not currently obvious that there is LOS to the retreat area, but NLOS, I'm pretty sure. Would it make more sense just to put satellites at either end? Unfortunately, the two locations are on different transformers, so connecting over the power lines is not an option. What might be a ballpark budget for connecting 2 computer in the remote location(also wirelessy) and 2 or 3 at the main house and 'barn'(separated by about 300'? Thanks for any ideas_________compwire

They run from 1 to 5 thousand per end and line of sight is required. Usually people will not do this and just drop a wired connection into the ground. In the 300 foot range, you can go with consumer items such as WiFi and place repeaters to extend the range of the Access Point. Bob
