<s> The following machine is going to be the general-purpose family machine. </s>
<s> This means that it will mostly be used for web surfing, office utilities, etc. </s>
<s> No one in the family is a gamer (yet), so it does not need to be optimized for gaming. </s>
<s> I might hook it up to the entertainment system for the digital home experience, but Im not dead-set on that. </s>
<s> The one thing I do want it optimized for is video editing. </s>
<s> For the past three years I have been using Pinnacle Studio (versions 8 and 9) on my dell x300 to do video editing. </s>
<s> I will keep using this for a while on the new machine, but ultimately want to jump to something more high-end. </s>
<s> Since I havent decided which editor to go with when I do upgrade (Adobe, Avid, Vegas), I am getting a cheapish video card right now. </s>
<s> So, I need a decent, stable system that is capable of low-end video editing right now and can be upgraded in the near future. </s>
<s> Oh yeah, and I probably will not be doing much tweaking, although overclocking still remains a possibility. </s>
<s> The following set-up is just about the limit of what I can spend. </s>
<s> As far as the alternate options go, I can probably add up to $100, but that is it (i.e All of the alternate options are not a possibility). </s>
<s> Any and all feedback is more than welcome! </s>

<s> ** Note #2: I have to decide whether to go with 1Gig of high quality memory or 2 Gigs of value memory *** Note #3: This will be upgraded when I decide which higher-end video editor I will go with. </s>
<s> choose the e6400 but a 'plain' p5b instead. </s>
<s> here's a feature comparison. </s>
<s> http://www.asus.com/products_compare_show.aspx?array_model=1178,1198 unless you *need* dual gigabit lan, dolby audio, dual x16 graphics slots (crossfire), firewire, ecc ram, or matrix raid, the p5b should be sufficient. </s>
<s> (if you're not going to use the features, why pay for them?) </s>
<s> the 965 chipset actually overclocks better than the 975 chipset and its just as stable (if not more stable). </s>
<s> for video editting use, most modern gpus perform the same. </s>
<s> still, i'd get at least a 7300gt so vista's aero interface won't be sluggish. </s>
<s> go with 2x1gb of fast memory. </s>
<s> i prefer ddr2-667 with agressive timings to ddr2-800 for better stability, but ddr2-533 value ram is needlessly slow. </s>
<s> the sonata ii is a very quiet case. </s>
<s> consider the p180 only if you want its looks, need an even quieter case, or plan on serious overclocking. </s>
<s> You've strung out a lot of tech specs...why don't you just buy a Mac? </s>
<s> hey, some advice from an editor here. </s>
<s> Decide on which edit system you want to go with first, if you want to go more high-end then you should know that the edit suites are picky with video cards and the like. </s>
<s> Especially Avid, if you have an ATI and want to go AVID you're s.o.l. </s>
<s> ...The main 'pro' edit applications these days are Avid and Final Cut Pro for the Mac, with Premiere Pro at second. </s>
<s> Even then you'll want to check Premiere's specs. </s>
<s> Even for low-end editing I'd get an NVidia Quadro card of some sort. </s>
<s> High-end edit machines tend to work best when you use them as edit suites alone and lose the MSN-ish junk on there as well. </s>
<s> AVID doesn't even like it when I have wallpaper on my PC. </s>
<s> Three years ago I assembled a system I thought would be more than adequate for hobbyist video production. </s>
<s> One erroneous idea that led to problems was my naieve assumption that one of the (then) highest rated video+PVR solutions (ATI All-in-Wonder 9800 Pro) and one of the (then) most recommended audio solutions (Creative SoundBlaster Audigy 2 EX) would make a superior combination. </s>
<s> The two devices never worked well together. </s>
<s> After my purchases, I discovered that the big PC vendors, including Dell's, online PC configuration tools (the ones you use to choose all the options before placing a purchase), would not permit the buyer selecting those two components for the same PC. </s>
<s> Since then, I have used Dell's (and other companies') online PC selection tools as a first-pass method for research compatibility issues. </s>
<s> Each manufacturer should also provide compatibility info on its web site. </s>
<s> I managed to get my system to hobble along, but--in retrospect--should have either done more research or purchased a pre-assembled PC from a mainline vendor. </s>
<s> Incidentally, though it is possible to put together a PC that will suffice for hobbiest multimedia production, my next multimedia computer will be a Mac (as another writer suggested). </s>
<s> Mark H, Albuquerque </s>
<s> buying RAM that's faster than the system components design speed. </s>
<s> All things considered ...I'd go with 2GBs vice 1GB. </s>
<s> That way your RAM needs will be covered for this system and OS and perhaps one OS upgrade (Vista ?). </s>
<s> Also check ASUS QVL for RAM compatability ... and also see the ASUS forum on the MB you've chosen. </s>
<s> You can avoid lots of hassles by doing some advance research. </s>
<s> Believe most users are reporting better compatibility with Corsair RAM. </s>
<s> The other thing is how are you planning to backup your data files ? </s>
<s> Let us know how it turns out. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> You need to things for video editing machine. </s>
<s> The more ram the better minimum 1gb. </s>
<s> Cpu with good amount of CPu cache. </s>
<s> I was able to do video editing with my Medion 2.8ghz pc with 1gb memory, a ti4200 video card, used the onboard sound card, and had two seperate HD's. </s>
<s> One for software, and one for data. </s>
<s> It handled any game I put on it, and did the video editing just fine using Adobe Premiere 6.5 and Sony Vegas 5. </s>
<s> To be realistic and keep you in the current ballpark, I would suggest a 3.2gh p4 with 1gb of memory, any decent video card, two seperate HD's (not a partition), and a dedicated firewire card. </s>
<s> Do some reading at www.videohelp.com, and you will see what I'm talking about. </s>
<s> You could also use an Athlon 3800 range pc. </s>
<s> The 2.8ghz will do real time video editing, but the 3.2ghz p4 is quite a bit faster. </s>
<s> Speed costs money. </s>
<s> If it isn't important, than go with anything bigger than the 2.8ghz. </s>
