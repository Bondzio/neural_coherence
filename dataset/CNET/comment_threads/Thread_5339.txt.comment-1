I have a HP 3-1 printer conected to my Windows 98 PC via USB.
My wife has a lap top with WiFi.
We currently are using a cable Modem with a Linksys wireless-G router for internet and VoIp.
Can I put a wireless print server on the printer so that we can share the printer and still have it hard wired through to my PC or would I then need a WiFi card for my PC to use the printer.
I'm new at this whole wireless thing.
I understand if I had XP instead of Windows 98 that I could share the pinter that way.
Any advise?
