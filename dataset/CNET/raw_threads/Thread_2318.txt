It's always had issues with power. Often it would make a small ticking noise before finally firing up and spinning. Last month it &quot;stopped working&quot;. No more ticking and certainly no more powering on. It is detected by Windows as being a Lacie Hard Drive but does not appear in My Computer. In Drive Management it cannot be accessed due to the drive being &quot;Not Ready&quot;. I tried buying a power pack that meet the hard drives specs. Still not a peep. I've removed the hard drive from the original casing and placed it into a Digitus SATA to USB 2.0 External HDD enclosure. Still no whirring from the drive and the casing LED indicator stays Red. I'm hesitant to move forward from here. I have no interest in preserving the hard drive and solely would like to remove my data and move on. If the drive doesn't work in 2 Casings, 1 being brand new, my conclusion is the drive is the problem. Are there any steps I can take, risky or otherwise, to access my data (i.e. how do I get this stupid hard disk to spin!?)? All thoughts are appreciated.
