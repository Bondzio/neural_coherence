i believe you'll find a lcd seemily more richer to the eye than a monitor, however, you should compare against a real good monitor.
the real culprit imho is room lighting as it will really deminish the value of any viewing screen.
while 17in.
seems big, most use 19in, if not bigger to best do cad.
i believe here the value of larger viewing screen offers more, regardless of lcd or monitor.
overall, you get tired eyes from either viewing source.
