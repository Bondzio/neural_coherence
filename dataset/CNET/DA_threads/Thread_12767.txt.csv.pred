1.1.1	I have an Acer netbook.	St
1.1.2	The Wifi connects perfectly when I go away - no problems at all, the networks pop up, I chose which one to use, enter any passwords and I'm away.	St
1.1.3	However, at home, with own network, it connects immediately to the network but NOT to the internet.	St
1.1.4	It's obviously some sort of setting that needs altering but can anyone give me any idea of where to look?	St
1.1.5	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	Sounds like a router setting at home.	St
1.2.2	What router are you using at home?	Ques
