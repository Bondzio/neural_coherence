<s> Hi, I'm thinking of installing a relatively simple hard-wired home network. </s>
<s> I plan to run Cat6 (or maybe Cat6A?) </s>
<s> from various outlets in my home to a central point where I can locate a switch, router and my cable modem. </s>
<s> I plan to terminate the cable runs at both ends with Cat6 keystone connectors. </s>
<s> I plan to use a Netgear GS724T switch and probably a Netgear FVS318G firewall, both of which incorporate &quot;Auto Uplink&quot; capability. </s>
<s> The only problem is that I'm not sure whether this approach will work or not. </s>
<s> So I guess my initial question is; If I simply terminate the Cat6 cable runs with Cat6 keystone connectors and then use Cat6 patch cables to directly connect the keystones to the components, will this work? </s>
<s> Or do I need to use a &quot;punch-down&quot; 110 patch panel? </s>
<s> I suspect that I have confused myself by thinking about MDI / MDIX issues and crossover cables. </s>
<s> Can someone please shine a little light in to my darkness? </s>
<s> Many thanks. </s>
<s> I never run crossover connections any more. </s>
<s> Haven't in over a decade. </s>
<s> All runs are straight pairs according to the standards. </s>
<s> But I will never tell an installer which standard to use. </s>
<s> That's their choice. </s>

<s> There's no hard rules about how to connect all the cables, as long as the wire colors match end-to-end. </s>
<s> As previously stated, crossover configured cables are largely unnecessary. </s>
<s> Personally, I would put RJ45 plugs on the ends of the cables instead of keystone connectors. </s>
<s> Putting plugs on the cables is about as easy as using the keystone connectors. </s>
<s> The plugs would make the patch cables unnecessary. </s>
<s> A patch panel also wouldn't be necessary if you put the switch at the central cable point. </s>
<s> Plugs would make your installation much neater with less clutter than the keystone connectors. </s>
<s> If you need to lengthen any of the cables after the plugs are installed, you can use simple female-to-female RJ45 adapters. </s>
<s> Again, take care to match wire colors on each end. </s>
<s> I'd recommend purchasing an inexpensive network cable tester to check your work. </s>
<s> I've lost count of electrically fine twisted pair runs but they used the incorrect pairs. </s>
<s> The pairing is not 1,2 3,4, 5,6 and 7,8. </s>
<s> It's well documented so go with one of the standards. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks to you both for those thoughts and observations. </s>
<s> So to confirm, I think that you are suggesting that my proposed approach should work and I can stop worrying about crossover cables. </s>
<s> Sunwatcher, terminating the cable runs with RJ45 plugs and connecting directly to the hardware is definitely an option to consider. </s>
<s> I had planned on color coding the keystone connectors to identify the outlets origin but of course I could equally use that approach with the plugs. </s>
<s> Thanks again guys. </s>
