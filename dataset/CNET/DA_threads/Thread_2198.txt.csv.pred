1.1.1	We are in need of a MultiMode 120 port approximately 2 inches in width, with the teeth measuring 1.5 inches.	St
1.1.2	Picture available if necessary.	St
1.1.3	We were given monitors, and the port that comes with them is unusual as far as we can tell.	St
1.1.4	As such, we are unable to connect the monitor to the tower we would like to use it with.	St
1.1.5	We are looking for anyone with experience or knowledge to assist us in connecting them--whether we need a special video card or an adapter to connect them.	Ques
1.2.1	See http://www.digibarn.com/collections/monitors/sigma-multimode/index.html It's for older equipment like old unix boxes.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	Well, according to our information, the monitor can be used with either Mac or PC... or at least was intended to be.	St
1.3.2	http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0NEW/is_1992_June_23/ai_12294864	St
1.4.1	It's from a time long ago.	St
1.4.2	It's going to be too rare today to find someone to make this part for you.	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	We just wanted to say that we were actually able to locate a graphics card that supported the monitor, but thanks anyway.	St
1.6.1	I haven't seen that card in over 10 years.	St
1.6.2	The knowledge is out there on the internet but not in my braincells.	St
1.6.3	It still required me to make a custom cable... Bob	St
