<s> I just purchased this device (External USB 2.0 & FIREWIRE SONY DW-U22A 16x Dual Layer DVD+-R/RW Drive) and tried to install the driver prior to connecting the drive. </s>
<s> First off, I have Win XP Home and the driver prompted me that the driver was for win98. </s>
<s> Secondly, it is showing up in &quot;my computer&quot; as a zip drive with only 35 mb of space. </s>
<s> I did try doing a search to find an XP Home driver but had no luck. </s>
<s> Nothing in the directions seemed to work. </s>
<s> Does anyone have this device and can help me? </s>
<s> TIA </s>
<s> Just FYI. </s>
<s> I put a bare TEAC into an USB 2.0 drive case and installed NO DRIVERS for it and XP works with it just fine. </s>
<s> BUT the functions of DVD recording and such is NOT CONTAINED IN A DRIVER which confuses some. </s>

<s> Thank you for the reply. </s>
<s> Apparently the instructions for this device was poorly written. </s>
<s> I was under the impression that I needed to format &quot;some&quot; drive. </s>
<s> The instructions went from installing the dvd drive right into formating the drive and I thought there was more that I needed to do. </s>
<s> Drive works fine </s>
