dear friends, the main question was the drive did not respond and there was no cd in the drive.
it could be the mechanical problem but in this case i feel its the power supply problem or a dead drive.
if you could see a light on the drive when u press a button or when you start the system, then it could be a mechanism problem or a faulty drive.
if you dont see any light at any time then the problem is with the power supply to the drive or a dead drive.
just open the chasis and check for the connections or try with a free power cord.
hope this is useful.
reply if it works..
