i remember my first experience with lcd monitor.
i though they were awfully bright but i am use to it now.
i am thinking if a led-lcd monitor would be nicer because the contrast ratio is so much higher (more like an crt monitor).
i see in todays' fry's, a 24&quot; viewsonic (1080p, 2ms) for $190; with taxes and waste disposal thing, it will probably be slightly under $250
