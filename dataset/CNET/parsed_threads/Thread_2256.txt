<s> If I were to purchase a wireless router, (those I've seen have several Lan ports), could I connect my DSL modem via the Wan port and my PC via 1 of these ports to utilise the router as a another security measure? </s>
<s> Also if that is feasible am I putting data RF out? </s>
<s> Do you see what I am asking? </s>
<s> Wireless routers are prevelant, but I would still use the router as a wired PC. </s>

<s> and another level of security in addition to whatever you have on your PC. </s>
<s> not sure if you can turn off the radio (check the user manual on the mfg's site) but you can configure it so practically no one can access it. </s>
<s> I have done a lot of work with the Linksys WRT54G, WRT54GS, and WRT54GC wireless-g routers. </s>
<s> In addition to disabling the SSID broadcast, there is a setting on the WRT54G and WRT54GS to disable the wireless portion of the router (set Wireless Network Mode to ''Disabled''). </s>
<s> The firmware versions I have encountered for the WRT54GC do not have the ability to disable its wireless network. </s>
<s> If I needed to disallow all wireless connections, I probably would enable MAC address filtering but permit no MAC addresses to connect. </s>
<s> I also would enable encryption and disable the SSID broadcast. </s>
<s> Hmmm...I guess I could also place the router in heavy 2.4GHz interference/blocking areas. </s>
