Because the test found that my system is equipped with only 2.0GHz CPU and the game requires at least 2.9GHz Does any one knows how to Make the graphic card (for games especially) to recognize the Core 2 CPU. Is there a difference between a dual Core 2 and a Core 2 CPU I had a Pentim 4 running at 3.7GHz was is better performance then the Core 2 CPU 4400@2.00GHZ?? thank you for any answer mourzilca

Yes Kees The game got installed and running and ,It might be the program but the game is not performing at it should be. I just installed the new Painkiller Overdose and the game is taking ages to load around 2 minutes is it possible? and when graphic goes very high meaning to much light and effect (fog, rain ) and I am running it at standard graphic not high or extreme it is performing very slow could it be that the games do not or are not compatible to Core 2 CPU? regards Alex

Kees The game Is not that old, it was released in 2007 and I am having the same slow motion like in the game (TimeShift) when to much lights are involved with Thunder Storm, Rain lightning explosions etc I have on the other hand no complains with call of duty 4 the game is playing very accurately. 1-
