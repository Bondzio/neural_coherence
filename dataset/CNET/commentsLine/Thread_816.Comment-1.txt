one day, when i started my computer, it took me to the screen that says &quot;ur computer did not turn off sucessfully.......&quot;.
i tried every option there and when i start windows normally or last known good configuration, it reboots when its suppose to show the window xp logo.
i could not do a system recover as a blue screen popped up.
sometimes, my computer wouldn't even open and it would keep on beeping.
i replaced the hard drive and hoped it would work.
when i replace the hard drive, everything worked fine until it randomly restarted again.
i turned it on and thought it was no problem.
a few days later, the same continuos beeping noise came up.
it would work from time to time, but there would be times where it wouldn't work.
i have a gateway and a amd processor running on window xp.
if u need anymore information, just tell me.
could this be a virus?
so any ideas???
?
