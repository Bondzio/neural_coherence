<s> Hi All, I'm getting a low toner nag screen despite having a brand new (but purchased in 2005) high capacity 6000 sheet toner cartridge installed. </s>
<s> Have not had any luck with the Dell forums so I thought I'd ask here. </s>
<s> Is there any way to get rid of the nag screen? </s>
<s> I've tried shaking up the toner cartridge but to no avail. </s>
<s> I did read in the manual there is a reset for the printing drum, but I didn't change that. </s>
<s> Any thoughts? </s>
<s> Thanks B </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=mozilla&q=Dell+1700+Low+Toner finds the usual two links. </s>
<s> Try that. </s>

<s> Hi Bob, Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> I did try google and found those links but the problem is not really the error lights on the printer. </s>
<s> Those are actually working correctly and don't indicate it needs toner. </s>
<s> It's the windows nag box. </s>

<s> Unless you absolutely need or want the printer management software, just remove it and use the driver only. </s>
<s> You should get no more nag. </s>
<s> Hi Steven, Thanks so much. </s>
<s> Didn't cross my mind to uninstall component of the software. </s>
<s> I figured there was some reset button or sequence of actions I had to do to make it to go away. </s>
<s> It works like a champ without the nag. </s>
<s> Thanks again to both of you. </s>
