<s> Until a few hours ago, my Intel iMac happily connected to the internet via my TimeCapsule. </s>
<s> My Windows laptop still happily connects to the internet via my TimeCapsule. </s>
<s> However, the iMac now won't connect. </s>
<s> On the iMac, when I select my network from the list of available networks from the Airport icon in the top menu bar, I get a dialogue box that asks for my WPA password (which the Mac used to just remember for me). </s>
<s> When I enter it and click OK, it tries to connect for a few seconds and then gives me a &quot;Connection timeout&quot; message. </s>
<s> When I open AirPort Utility on the iMac, it says it can't find any wireless devices. </s>
<s> I have tried shutting off everything (modem, TimeCapsule, Mac), waiting, and then switching everything back on. </s>
<s> What else can I do? </s>
<s> Did you ever get a resolution? </s>
<s> If so, please advise. </s>
<s> My iMac and iPhone 4 suddenly won't connect to my Time Capsule now - but my macbook and iPad will. </s>
<s> Update. </s>
<s> Resolved the issue. </s>
<s> Found a post in the macrumors.com forum that had a suggestion I hadn't tried... </s>
<s> Went into airport settings, and wireless At Radio Channel Selection - changed from auto to manual. </s>
<s> Manually changed the radio frequencies to channels 161 and 5. </s>
<s> Hit ok, then update and once the TC rebooted, everyone is getting along fine again! </s>
<s> I have the same problem but there is no such thing as a &quot;radio channel selection&quot; in Network diagnostics for airport. </s>
<s> Did you mean something else? </s>
<s> The post from moncton_2011 is telling you to change the settings in Airport Utility. </s>
<s> Open Airport Utility and chose manual setup. </s>
<s> Under the Summary tab you can change the radio channel. </s>
<s> Sorry, I meant the Wireless tab. </s>
