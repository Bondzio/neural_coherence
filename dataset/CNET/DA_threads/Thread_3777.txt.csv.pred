1.1.1	Howdy all, I'm looking to buy a new desktop (mainly to create a few VM's and a virtual domain) and wanted peoples input on system requirements.	St
1.1.2	At the moment I'm looking at 2 machines, specs below: Machine 1 Intel Core i7 Processor 920 (2.66GHz, 8MB cache, 4.8GT/sec) Memory : 8192MB (4x1024,2x2048) 1067MHz DDR3 Dual Channel 500GB Serial ATA (7200RPM) 512 MB DDR2 ATI Radeon HD 4350 Machine 2 Intel Core2 Quad Processor Q8400 (4M Cache, 2.66 GHz, 1333 MHz FSB) Memory : 8192MB (4x1024,2x2048) 1067MHz DDR3 Dual Channel 1TB Serial ATA (7200RPM) 512MB ATI Radeon 4850 Graphics card Any suggestions on which one is better/more appropriate?	St
1.2.1	Your post and the machines don't seem to match.	St
1.3.1	What should I be looking for?	St
1.3.2	I thought by getting a fairly robust desktop it should suffice...	St
1.4.1	http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/intel-core-i5,2410.html covers this very well and you can look over the benchmarks and more.	St
1.4.2	If the machines above had a make and model, I missed it.	St
1.4.3	But as presented they looked more like gamer machines.	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	But it all depends, if you are DIY a compatible computer then change the core to machine one and all will be fine.	St
1.5.2	But on the other hand if you are buying from a company than machine 2 is the way to go, you will keep the processor for a longer time than the i7 and the 1tb hardrive will last much longer.	St
1.5.3	And the graphics card on machine two is a bit better than on machine 1.	St
1.5.4	But you did not give us any prices so its hard to tell.	St
1.5.5	might want to extend on that.	Sug
1.5.6	Good luck &lt;&lt;&lt;NICK&gt;&gt;&gt;	Polite
1.6.1	Thanks Nick.	St
1.6.2	Due to finances the purchasing of the equipment has been delayed...	St
1.6.3	So I have a bit longer to research it.	St
1.6.4	Looking at sending about 600 to 700, so if anyone sees a machine better suited to what I'm after than feel free to let me know.	St
