there's not such thing as a g120 in a netbook.
the asus f50/f70 are laptops for folks &quot;on the go&quot;.
the f50gx using nvidia 9400m graphics; the f50z using an ati gpu that's slightly faster.
the &quot;g120&quot; (if it exists) is a rebranded nvidia 9500 (the &quot;g100&quot; is a 9400; and &quot;g130&quot; is a 9600. google gts 250 and you'll see that it's the new brand for the 9800gtx).
there' nothing special or revolutionary in this lineup.
