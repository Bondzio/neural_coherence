I'm planning a trip to Asia in the near future and am looking for a tablet to use only for reading. I need something that has a back light for low-light reading and I need something that has minimal glare for high-light environments. I've considered the Kindle Paperwhite, but I have no hands-on experience with it. I have an iPad that I use for other activities... this new device is only intended for reading. Aside from the visibility factor, weight is also a concern. Anyone have recommendations? Thanks!

I'd always added a book light when needed. And best can only be determined by you. For me this ain't it. Bob

Including the KF HD, Nexus 7, Asus Transformer and a dozen others. You seem to have found exactly what you are looking for but your posts seem to ask for a backlight and this has it. Is this an issue where you didn't know it had it? Bob

I was hoping, prior to purchasing anything, that I might get a bit of insight from users of other devices. Perhaps there is another device that I'm unfamiliar with, that could satisfy my requirements?
