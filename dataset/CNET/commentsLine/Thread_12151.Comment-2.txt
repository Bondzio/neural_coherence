i wired the mac to the router with an ethernet cable to see if it would change things.
no luck.
should it have made a difference?
can i use some different configuration to let them communicate via ethernet?
btw, i get the above error when trying to access the workgroup.
when i access that workgroup on the pc, it does see the mac as one of its members, but i get a similar error when trying to access it (the mac from the pc - &quot;the network path was not found&quot;).
anyone know how i can solve this??
?
