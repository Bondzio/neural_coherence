Basically, I am looking for something simple to use with decent picture quality. I only plan to use it for video conversations via msn. This little number caught my eye recently on newegg: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16830108129 I gladly welcome any purchasing advice. Especially in regards to what features I should look for and what would be a good compromise in terms of price and quality. Many thanks in advance!

Offer the make and model as well so others can see what you were looking at. -&gt; A recurring issue with all such work is the lack of good lighting. There are few cheap cameras that will overcome bad lighting (I'll write none.) Bob

It got a 7.6/5.7 from CNET's editors/users and 4 out of 5 eggs from Newegg users. Currently it costs about $80 and has a $40 rebate. Sorry the link did not work for you. For whatever reason it still works for me though. I will definitely try to be more courteous when posting links in the future. That's a pretty bold statement regarding webcams in bad lighting. I will primarily be using the camera at night when lighting is less than optimal since the people I will speak to are literally halfway around the globe. Needless to say this will be a big issue for me. How much should I be expecting to pay and what should I make sure that I get for my money?

Your model is too similar to other webcams I own. To get good results I have to add more light to the room than what you would suspect. A pair of 100 Watt lights in addition to the normal room lighting worked for me. Bob
6651	4	263763	2582582	2582559	kitabata	9/11/07 12:01 PM	1.18951206E12	Wow	2 100watt light bulbs? Wow! Hope the bulk of your video conferencing is not at night! What would be considered different? I'm reading lots of reviews and the majority of the complaints come from models that are incompatible or have problematic software or drivers.

6651	6	263763	2582686	2582593	kitabata	9/11/07 1:33 PM	1.18951758E12	Pans and videos	Since this would be the first webcam I'm getting obviously I haven't any experience with them. I'm not panning your lighting tips though. Sorry if you got that impression. What I was getting at though, was you said that the camera I saw was no different from the ones you owned. So I'm asking, what would be different? Thanks for the link. Unfortunately, I am at work now so I can't view Youtube links. But I will check it out at home.
6651	7	263763	2583687	2582593	kitabata	9/13/07 12:37 AM	1.18964382E12	Very Interesting	Finally saw that link you posted. That was a fascinating video. Thanks again for sharing. I'm not interested in using a webcam to post youtube videos however. I'd just like to use it for video IM, so if the quality is not up to par w/ a hi-quality youtube vid, I don't think I'd mind. I do appreciate your responses though.
