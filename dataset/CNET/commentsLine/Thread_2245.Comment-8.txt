my god, if i had known it was that old, i may not have purchased it.
but how can it be that old?
xp professional didn't come out until 2002, and that is what this thing came with from the manufacturer.
are power supplies computer specific?
if not, maybe i can pick up a better one for cheap somewhere, and finish this upgrade over time...
