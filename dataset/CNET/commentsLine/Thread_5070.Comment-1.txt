our small business has a netgear fvs318 broadband prosafe vpn firewall router ( ftp://downloads.netgear.com/files/fvs318_ref_manual_14.pdf ).
one of our employees is abusing his internet priveleges.
i know how to shut off his internet access completely via the web-based router firewall.
the problem is our printer is hooked up to the router and if i disable his internet access, he won't be able to print.
question: is there a way to just disable his ability to go on the internet but keep his ability to print to our network printer which is also connected to the router?
thanks for any help!
