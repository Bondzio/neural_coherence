hi there well i finally screwed my courage to the sticking place, downloaded the bios upgrade and awardflash.
exe, followed all instructions, and when it asked me if i wanted to save old bios, i said sure, and it's spitting at me .
.
.
i don't think i've ruined it yet, but .
.
.
i guess i can't pick my own filename, i have to type the name of the current bios.
is the old bios file the little sequence of numbers i see at startup?
i assume i have to type that in if i want to save the old bios?
