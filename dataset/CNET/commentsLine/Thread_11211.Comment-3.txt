another thing to do is google default password for your router, some site has a huge list.
try this to connect from the wired pc (using the ip of the router) if this doesn't do it, reset the router, and try to connect to it again from the wired computer.
this should allow you to access the setup for the router, and you can enter new passwords and keys
