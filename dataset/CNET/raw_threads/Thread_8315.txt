I just purchased an IBM Thinkpad T42 Notebook (Win XP Pro) computer with the Intel Pro 2200B/B wireless card and am having major problems connecting wirelessly to the internet. I need help. Here is where I am: Day 1: Got computer and set it up on my 128-bit encripted home wireless network; everything was working flawlessly, and I spent 3 hours on the internet, downloading software and reconfiguring my favorite internet sites on the new computer. At the end of the evening, I went to Windows update and downloaded and installed SP2 before going to bed, happy with my new notebook. Day 2: Can't get on the internet via my wireless network with the new computer, but my two other computers (both XP home, no SP2) continue to connect flawlessly on my wireless network. Spend hours on the phone with IBM support making sure my Intel 2200B/G driver (8.1.0.28)and my IBM Access Connections software (3.53) are the latest versions. -tried removing IBM Access Connection and using MS Wireless Zero Config -tried disabling MS Wireless Zero config and using only IBM Access Connection Day 3: After hours on the phone with tech support, nothing works or helps. My family misses me.... In most instances, the computer can see my encripted wireless network, but it cannot access it. In frustration, I reformated the hard drive using the IBM Access program (which supposedly totally reformates the drive and brings the drive back to its initial factory specs). To my suprise, this program reformated the drive WITH SP2 as part of the install. So I can't even get back to where I was on Day 1. When I go to control panel add/remove programs, SP2 is NOT listed. Day 4: I am worried because after reading about all the problems with SP2 and wireless (over the last 24 hours), that instead of spending more time trying to figure out why the wireless network access isn't working for the new computer, I just want to configure my new system similarly to when it was working on Day 1. Basically, unless anyone can tell me how to fix my wireless access problem in the presence of SP2, I want to remove SP2 (need someone to tell me how to do this) and move on with my life. Please help!

I've got the same story: the computer worked perfectly out of the box. I installed and transferred numerous files. Then, after configuring the new computer, I can no longer access wirelessly. Of course my old computer is now being used by somebody else, after reformatting the hard drive. After also spending hours with IBM Help, IBM has sent me a box to ship them the computer back under warranty. But, sometimes I can use the same computer on my wireless network at work without any problem. However, some times when hitting the &lt;funtion} F5 button (which should toggle the wireless radio on and off), the system doesn't even show I have a wireless radio! I don't have any confidence in the IBM warranty, and I really don't want to be without my new computer for weeks. Isn't there a better solution?
