i am guessing that because you replied &quot;ouch&quot; and there is no way to pair the dual drives outside of maxtor's magic one touch box my situation is bleak?
i do have a redundant backup, but capacity is not as large as the tb.
so i do not do full backups on the redundant.
just when i thought i was safe with a single backup drive, now i have to have a backup for the backup?
where does it all end!
