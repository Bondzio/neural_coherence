<s> Good evening, I have an HP a705w running win xp home edition that will not boot up. </s>
<s> It will come to a screen that indicates that there is no OS installed. </s>
<s> When you try to run the recovery system it shuts itself down. </s>
<s> I have tried replacing the HDD according to the hp support site and as soon as the system attempts to access the HDD all it will do is shut itself off. </s>
<s> Any other suggestions? </s>
<s> Just a quick checklist: Did you visit a &quot;bad&quot; site? </s>
<s> Maybe virus? </s>
<s> What other hardware are you running? </s>
<s> If you know: Is anything overclocked? </s>
<s> Probably not, just checking. </s>
<s> Is there anyway to check if the first HDD works in another comp? </s>
<s> If you don't: Visit your local comp shop: If they are nice enough, they'll test your HDD in another PC for free. </s>
<s> Power supply dying? </s>
<s> Is it under warranty? </s>
<s> Try calling HP for help. </s>

<s> I had something happen to my unit last night. </s>
<s> It will power up, (fans running, LEDs light up), but I get nothing to my monitor. </s>
<s> Thied it with two other monitors, nothing... </s>
<s> I've been in HP.com trying to find a new motherboard, but cannot locate an exact match; Micro-Star International, Gamila/Giovani/Neon series030. </s>
<s> Serial Number: 4811472490 Bios: Award Software 3.25 04/12/2005 HP Part Number : P8557-69002. </s>
<s> I got this number from the HP website, but they said - Not Available. </s>

<s> Sometimes machines will not work when they accumulate too much dust inside. </s>
<s> I would suggest using a vaccume cleaner to clear all the dust and perhaps a Q-Tip to clean those fan blades. </s>
<s> If the system says no OS was found you might want to remove the floppy disk that's in the floppy drive, it usually has no operating system. </s>
