<s> I want to replace the motherboard on my old Gateway 832GM. </s>
<s> I want to replace it with a newer motherboard compatible with 2nd gen. intel i3 or i5. </s>
<s> any suggestions since it is an old batx form chassis. </s>
<s> if the computer faces you the chassis opens on the right side. </s>
<s> If the PC is that old, I strongly suggest you just leave it. </s>
<s> Bite the bullet and get a new case or least a more newer spacious type, in order to benefit the install of the i3/i5 mtrbd., and start with a better foundation as it were. </s>
<s> Not to pick on you, but sometimes its better this way. </s>
<s> If you're trying to save costs, then rethink what would happen it after all is said and done, after shoe-honing the new mtrbd. </s>
<s> in and maybe finding a PSU that fits, etc., you may bump up against some issue that was easily resolved with a newer case. </s>
<s> You can simply just lay the parts out and connect them minus the case to see if they work and final mount them into the Gateway case if you like. </s>
<s> Your main consideration is space, will a new mtrbd. </s>
<s> fit. </s>
<s> Typical OEM based PCs tend to be build with *only* its details in mind, so they don't provide an ease of install for other full-blown upgrades. </s>
<s> But, if its generic enough it may be workable. </s>
<s> I just find OEM based PCs just get into problems all to easily on the most basic level, usually physical size and/or spacing. </s>
<s> What has happened with newer PCs is the basic PC has more cooling and better PSU and ram additions or similar details. </s>
<s> All this boils down that a new PC, a DIY should also follow a similar path. </s>
<s> A better wattage PSU(amps too) and additional ram slots with leads to better cooling demands, plus any video upgrades. </s>
<s> Even if non-gaming use PC, the new i3/i5 will expect no less. </s>
<s> If for gaming then you better think all that in mind beforehand. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I totally agree with Willy, you would be better off setting up a new system from scratch. </s>
<s> Use the old Gateway as secondary system and base a new unit on newer technology, you will have much better results. </s>
<s> Shop around online for components, Newegg and others, there are always deals and sales on hardware plus it is a lot of fun designing your own set up. </s>
<s> Have fun and good luck!! </s>
