cas latency should be higher with ddr3, just as ddr2 has a higher cas latency than ddr but the slower cas latency is made up for by having a higher overall speed.
bandwidth is also increased with ddr3.
from the last i read, ddr3 should be close to ddr2 pricing in 6-9 months.
further development should also bring the cas latency down with ddr3.
right now, unless a person has lots of money, and some people do, then its better to build using ddr2.
even intel has recognized this by designing an x48 mobo that will use ddr2.
