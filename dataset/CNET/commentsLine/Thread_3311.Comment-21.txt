jeff, i don't mean to be rude or to &quot;put-down&quot; your advice.
but your statement &quot; be aware that a number of motherboeard no longer come with a game port.
if you have a large investment in game controllers that use the gameport and does not work with usb-to-gameport adapters (some microsoft sidewinder products) you will need extra hardware (soundcard with gameport).&quot; granted i don't have any idea of what kind of games you play, nor do i know what games, gmartin2r plays.
in my opinion the game port / midi port is no longer needed.
i have been playing games on my pc's for more than 6 years now; and ever since the developement of the usb interface, i've stopped using the game port ( not that i used it that much in the first place ).
and as far as i know none of my friends have used their game ports either.
so, a computer that doesn't come with a game port should be like a human being having their appendix, removed, its not something that your going to miss.
also, gmartin2r; spec'd out with his computer parts list a cl audigy sound card and as far i know have game port headers on the pcb and the matching backplate interface to fit the header.
in all other regards i agree with your suggestions jeff.
jc
