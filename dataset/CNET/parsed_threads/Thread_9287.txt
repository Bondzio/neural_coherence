<s> Are there any netbooks out there that can be viewed in direct sunlight? </s>
<s> Almost nothing else (memory, battery life, etc.) </s>
<s> is a concern. </s>
<s> Thoughts? </s>
<s> While we know the Toughbooks (see google) have sunlight readable displays there is no market for the netbook version. </s>
<s> Or rather will the market be big enough to support the sunlight readable Toughbook and a netbook version? </s>
<s> I'm going with no. </s>

<s> Well, I might defer to that touchscreen one from Acer. </s>
<s> T91 I think. </s>
<s> Thanks for your responce Bob. </s>
<s> Guess I'm just spoiled from using my T400 outside. </s>
<s> I was hoping to find something in the netbook size/pricerange. </s>
<s> I'm assuming you're referring to glossy vs. matte displays? </s>
<s> Most netbooks and consumer laptops have glossy displays, which are next to impossible to view outdoors. </s>
<s> There are a few netbooks that do have matte displays, however. </s>
<s> Namely the Samsung NC10 and the HP Mini 110. </s>
<s> I haven't used either of them outdoors, though. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> I am looking at the reviews now and may grab one of these models soon. </s>
<s> Both have reviews stating they are &quot;suitible for outdoor use.&quot; Thank you for the reply. </s>
<s> I am not the happy owner of an HP 110-1030NR. </s>
<s> Imagine my surprise when walking through the PX (military everything-type store) here in Afghanistan and seeing it on display right after these posts. </s>
<s> It came with an extended battery. </s>
<s> I'm happy to have the extra battery life, but mixed on not being able to pack it without taking it off. </s>
<s> But if that's the only downside, I'm sitting pretty. </s>
<s> Thanks for all of the help. </s>
<s> Chad </s>
<s> not = now </s>
<s> Congratulations on your purchase. </s>
<s> The HP Mini 110 is much easier to find in retail outlets, so at least you can see what it's like in person. </s>
<s> The Samsung NC10 is much more difficult to find in retail brick-and-mortar stores, so you'd have to order one and have it shipped to you. </s>
<s> BTW a fair number of netbooks have six-cell batteries that stick out in a rather inelegant manner, e.g. </s>
<s> Dell, HP, Acer, and so forth. </s>
<s> Although the extended battery life makes up for it, and then some. </s>
<s> Be safe! </s>
<s> The battery on this on goes straight down, creating a ninety-degree angle. </s>
<s> It's a little odd to hold, it can potentially be a handle. </s>
<s> But I hesitate to pack it without taking the batter off. </s>
<s> I'll look into an extra smaller battery, that way I can pack it away, and have a few extra hours in the bag. </s>
