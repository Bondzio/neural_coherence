alright,i solved my cpu usage problem.
turns out it was my video drivers.
i was using forceware release 80, so i rolled back to 45.23 and it's all good.
the 80 version also interfered with my usb mouse, making the cursor freeze until i rebooted.
according to the nvidia website, 80s are supposed to work with my geforce 4 and were fine for a while.
i might have installed some other program later that interfered with them.
