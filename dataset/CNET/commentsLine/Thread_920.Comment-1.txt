i have a us robotics broadband router (model 8003) networking two computers at home for cable broadband.
last night i was on the net, viewed some movie trailers and closed the browser.
i tried getting back on a few mitues later and there was no connection to the net found on both computers.
i tries re-booting the router by pushing the pin-sized reset button, after that the status light is still showed as orange (which means that there is a system failure according to the us robotics manual).
anyone have any possible solutions to find out what excatly is wrong?
thanks in advance.
