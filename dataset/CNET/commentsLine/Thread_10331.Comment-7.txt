for both photo editing and dvd watching you want good contrast & color accuracy.
for photos you probably want high resolution--i assume your current monitor if not wide screen is probably 1280x1024, so 720p is like a shortened version of that at 1280x720 (or many tvs are 1366x768).
you can judge for yourself how much resolution you need but also keep in mind the same resolution on a larger screen will be more pixelated (at the same viewing distance).
personally i would get a 24&quot; widescreen monitor, which is big enough to be good for movies in a small/medium room, and has a resolution of 1920x1200 which is like a slightly taller version of 1080p and is a pretty huge computer resolution.
if you get a tv you may be less comfortable sitting close to it for normal computer use, and unless it's 1080p the resolution might be limiting.
as for your graphics card, it would probably be a good idea to upgrade it but i would have to know more about your system to tell if that's what's causing the choppiness.
