hi.
i recently purchased a gateway 835gm running windows xp media center.
the drives are a double layer 16x multi format i use for cd and dvd writing and 16x dvd drive.
i have a pentium d processor 820, a gig of memory and a 250 gig hard drive.
my problem is that i installed itunes (which i have been using for a while on another pc) and have had no problems (i authorized this pc) until i tried to burn a cd/r.
itunes tells me &quot;disc burner or sofware not found&quot;.
i have spent hours on the apple support site.
i have uninstalled and reinstalled itunes (version 5) to no avail.
i can insert an audio cd and itunes recognizes it and plays the tracks but i cannot figure out how to make itunes find the cd drive when i want to burn a cd.
seeing i do not have an ipod, i use cds to through in the car.
if anyone has any ideas, i'd appreciate it.
joe
