I hear 2 gigs isnt much diff then one in gaming only like 3 FPS. Im getting XMS ram for sure i just cant afford 2 gigs of XMS so if i do get 2 gigs its would only be normal.

People that use 2gb of memory are doing some intensive projects like photo-editing and video-editing. PCMagazine had an article of how they compared 7 gaming rigs from high-end vendors such as Alienware and Falcon Northwest, and all their systems had 1gb of memory (except for one system, and you are right, 2gb doesn't make much of a difference). Yet all those systems still ran games such as Halflife 2 and Splinter CELL in the highest resolutions with AA turned on just fine. 1gb will be fine for your gaming rig.

Besides, you can always o'c your ram, changing the timings would get you where you want to go and buy some memory heatspreaders, and you've got corsair xms. The fsb speed is the most important anyways. If you really want to o'c just buy pc4200, pc4800, etc... Roger

Unless you enjoy running a lot of background apps while gaming, you won't really notice a difference at all. Keep in mind that RAM isn't going to affect gaming that much as long as you have enough. If you want to see the biggest FPS increase, consider purchasing a new video card or a faster processor.
