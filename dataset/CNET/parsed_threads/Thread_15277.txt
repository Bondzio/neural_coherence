<s> i have been using my samsung 40gb hard disk series MP0402H as my portable hard disk for about 1-2 years. </s>
<s> last night, my portable hard disk just died on me! </s>
<s> the casing's led of my portable hard disk just kept blinking and my laptop couldn't detect my portable hard disk even after i tried all 4 ports of my laptop. </s>
<s> i tried plugging other USB device like my mouse and cable for my mp3 player into the USB port but they work fine. </s>
<s> i did not do any backup for the files in my portable hard disk. </s>
<s> now, i can't retrieve the documents i need for my work. </s>
<s> is there anyway that i could retrieve my old files? </s>
<s> thank you in advance. </s>

<s> or the controllers inside the case. </s>
<s> Have you tried putting the drive into a desktop as slave? </s>
<s> This will tell you more information. </s>
<s> If the HD works in the PC then the case or cord is defective. </s>
<s> i just tried it on my dad's portable hard disk casing and it's the same thing. </s>
<s> the led just kept blinking. </s>
<s> I think I'd take it to a service center. </s>
<s> And hopefully a lesson is learned. </s>
<s> Backup. </s>
<s> All my data I don't want to loose gets backed up to an external HD, and that data is backed up to DVD data disks. </s>
<s> I have three copies. </s>
<s> Having all your important &quot;stuff&quot; on only one drive is asking for trouble. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
