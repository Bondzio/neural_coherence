<s> I recently got my computer fix because of some virus that did something to the explorer.exe. </s>
<s> And since i've got it back the sound coming out of my speakers sounds echoey? </s>
<s> Depending on your audio chipset, you may have &quot;effect&quot; output. </s>
<s> Meaning, you can change how the audio is produced like in a cave, auditorum, stage, etc.. You need you check the audio(multi-media) portion and see what if any changes can be made. </s>
<s> You will know if that's possible, chancge it and save upon exiting that area. </s>
<s> This should be found under the control panel area. </s>
<s> Mine is for the AC'97. </s>
<s> It could be another problem area, but that's where I check first. </s>
<s> You can also verify under the device setting what the outputs are set at, like XYZ??? </s>
<s> device. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I have the same chip as you the AC97 and i've had a look and have found nothing that can change the effect? </s>
<s> OK, now is the time you explain, exactly what system you have. </s>
<s> I'm not going to be guessing. </s>
<s> If you run XP, then you have an icon under control panel that's labeled, &quot;Sound Effect Manager&quot;. </s>
<s> If none, you have what? </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I found it, the setting was under ''generic''. </s>
<s> Which i have now changed to ''none''. </s>
<s> Thanks Willy. </s>
