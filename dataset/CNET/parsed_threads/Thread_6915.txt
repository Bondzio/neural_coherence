<s> Does anyone know where I can get a user manual for HP 682c deskjet printer? </s>
<s> I have tried HP and EBay to no avail. </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&q=C4549-60050 But most of us just toss this out. </s>
<s> Why do you need it? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the comeback Bob. </s>
<s> However, no such like at that site. </s>
<s> I need it in order to give the printer to a senior center that is asking for computer peripherals. </s>
<s> If you have the install CD, check to see if there a printable manual there. </s>
<s> For all intents and purposes, it really doesn't provide much other than pictures and basic install and info. </s>
<s> Just make a 1-page document that describes how to install, laminate it if you want. </s>
<s> HP may have a reference file on that model, check to see. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> I read a few of the hits I supplied and you can buy the manual from them for about 10 bucks. </s>
<s> It's my choice to share how to find such with a crafty GOOGLE, but just like showing where the water is, I don't fill the water glass and hand it over. </s>
<s> Since it's a gift, the new owner should be chided if they complain about this manual. </s>
<s> Instead, print what's on HP's web site about this printer. </s>
<s> Since hp.com is alive, well and I can find that printer, I leave your work to you. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Found nothing about this printer on HP's website and no manual on the 3.5 floppies that came with the printer. </s>
<s> Most of the sites you suggested do not have the manual and the ones that do want an outrageous price for it. </s>
<s> More than a new printer even, but some want the paper. </s>
<s> I won't write that what I saw on my manual was worth keeping (oops, I just did.) </s>
<s> At least it's possible to replace the manual, but seeing its a gift, maybe just like a gift horse, don't look the gift horse in the _____. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the input. </s>
<s> I will just scrap the printer and forget about the whole thing. </s>
<s> If you want to get rid of the ptr. </s>
<s> just box it up and give whatever you do have to Goodwill or Sal Army store. </s>
<s> I find many and usually, they're good to go and yes, I don't need the manual, just the drivers. </s>
<s> Of course the ptr. </s>
<s> works, but the cost of ink carts makes it a doubtful deal, but when then the end-users are pretty happy to pay when the cost is nominal and it works, plus usually these prtrs. </s>
<s> I salvage are more than simple bottom-end models if new. </s>
<s> Well, sad to hear the manual would cost too much. </s>
<s> adios -----Willy </s>
