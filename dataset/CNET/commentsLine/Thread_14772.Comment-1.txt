is there a function in the aiw card where i can set a schedule, and hibernate the computer?
and when the time comes, the computer will start itself and record and then shut down once its done?
that is one function i really need it seems what i want is called srpo (scheduled recording in power-off mode) from searching on google, it doesnt seem like the aiw's have this feature.... but i cant be sure can any of you with aiw's confirm this with me?
