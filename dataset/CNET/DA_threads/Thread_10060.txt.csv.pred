1.1.1	I'm running an Athlon64 3000+ on an ASUS A8N5X and have four sticks of Kingston Dual-Channel DDR400 RAM installed.	St
1.1.2	I updated my bios recently and also finally turned off the splash screen that appears and obstructs the actual POST screen.	St
1.1.3	There I noticed my DDR 400 is being detected as only DDR 333.	St
1.1.4	My question is what could be causing this?	St
1.1.5	I can manually set it to DDR 400 but I would rather it automatically detect it as such.	St
1.1.6	Any help/insight into this issue would be appreciated.	St
1.1.7	Here's my full specs: Motherboard: ASUS A8N5X BIOS: Phoenix - AwardBIOS 6.00PG BIOS Date: 03/20/06 AwardBIOS Message: ASUS A8N5X ACPI BIOS Revision 0902 CPU: Socket 939 Athlon64 3000+ (Venice) RAM Kingston PC3200 (4x256MiB) Video: eVGA GeForce 7600GT (256MiB GDDR3) OS: Windows XP Home Edition Hard Disks: Seagate 80GiB (SATA) WD Caviar 120GiB (IDE) WD Caviar 160GiB (SATA) Optical: BenQ 1620 DVD +/- RW DL Sound: Nvidia AC97	St
1.2.1	The board only runs at 333 so it's bios tests for up to that and reports just that.	St
1.2.2	The BIOS only understands up to 333.	St
1.2.3	The page I read on this board didn't note 400 support with this CPU so all is proper.	St

1.3.1	http://vip.asus.com/forum/view.aspx?id=20060909042351446&board_id=1&model=A8N5X&page=1&SLanguage=en-us	St
1.4.1	I can set the speed to 400MHz within the BIOS itself.	St
1.4.2	Had I known this board only supports 333 I would never have bought it, I wasted 200 dollars on RAM I cannot make any full use of.	St
1.5.1	speed settings and voltage manually.	St
1.5.2	Save settings and run Memtest86 for 6-8 hours.	St
1.5.3	If no errors enjoy !	St
1.5.4	If errors..might have to increase RAM voltage or change the timings.	St
1.5.5	The better solution...buy 2-1GB DIMMs for 2GB total vice 4-512MBs DIMMs for 2GB total.	St
1.5.6	Let us know.	St
1.5.7	VAPCMD	St
1.6.1	I've seen this problem in older mtrbds.	St
1.6.2	and it seems hasn't gone away.	St
1.6.3	What has happpened is the mtrbd.	St
1.6.4	makers have at least provided a &quot;auto cure&quot; in that it slows down the system in order just to work as best as possible.	St
1.6.5	Asus is more of a &quot;stable&quot; system provider rather than a &quot;over-clocker&quot; user friendly one.	St
1.6.6	When all slots are used, a timing issue arises and in older models would crash or freeze.	St
1.6.7	The earlier advise was to not use all slots, leave the last slot open and/or reduce the ram timing to a more slower or safe level.	St
1.6.8	Basically, you allowed defaults setting, no super tweeking.	St
1.6.9	I'm sure what has happened in your case is in order to operate the system, DR333 levels become the default when DR400 is used for all slots.	St
1.6.10	You can test this, remove the last ram module, verify the DR400(bios setting)are saved and reboot.	St
1.6.11	If it reports back to DR400, great if not, then dismiss this advise.	St
1.6.12	Another cure is to use large Gb ram modules in place of what you currently use, like 1gb or 512mb vs. 256mb.	St
1.6.13	Again, the above applies at limited levels if all slots are used.	St
1.6.14	This is one reason why some mtrbd.	St
1.6.15	makers provide 3 slots instead of 4, which is odd compared to slot history if you think about it(yeah, I'm old tech).	St

1.7.1	I know about the problem and brought it to the attention of some folks a good ways back.	St
1.7.2	They didn't believe it until the researched their manuals and saw the tiny asterisks and footnotes.	St
1.7.3	I'm under the impression it affected earlier boards and or CPUs with early versions of the AMD memory controller.	St
1.7.4	Here's hoping his problem is remedied by changing the RAM settings in the BIOS.	St
1.7.5	Speaking of BIOS ...maybe the problem would be cured by a BIOS update or a slight RAM voltage increase.	St
1.7.6	I went with the 2-1GB DIMMs vs 4-512MB DIMMs and it runs at 400MHz with tighter than average RAM settings.	St
1.7.7	VAPCMD	St
1.8.1	I found that VIA chipsets were prone to the problem, however Intel too seemed to be affected but not as much if left at deafult levels.	St
1.8.2	I too read on mtrbd.	St
1.8.3	support websites info on this problem, usually the last paragraph or so or asterisk as you mention, what to look for.	St
1.8.4	Further, if any forum is provided, the high volume Q&A on any one topic.	St
1.8.5	This sure isn't &quot;ferrite core&quot; memory anymore.	St
1.8.6	One modern PC ram module is equal to or far surpassed any old system memory drawer/compartment.	St
1.8.7	tada -----Willy	St
