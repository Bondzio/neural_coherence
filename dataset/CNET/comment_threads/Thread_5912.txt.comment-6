Actually, to be honest, I have no idea in hard disk world.
Specially, external drives 2.5''.
In 2002 I bought 40GB Barracuda IV 7200 RPM.
And it was recommended on internet and had good review rating those days.
I found it very good!
Similarly, I find some good rating for Maxtor and Segate FreeAgent Go on iinternet.
That's the reason I asked for either one.
Well, do LaCie has internal fan?
And what is global rating of it?
Your help/guidence is highly appreciated!
Thanks.
Bye, Viki.
