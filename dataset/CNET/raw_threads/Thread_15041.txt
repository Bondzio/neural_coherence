Every time i give it a try i run into diffrent problems, but the one that keeps stopping me is: Windows - Sytem Error There is an IP addres conflict with another system on the network. I am running XP, i have bridged the connections; Wireless Network Connection, Local Area Connection (Xbox 360). With the connections bridged i am still able to connect to the internet with my laptop, but i lose contact with my Xbox.
