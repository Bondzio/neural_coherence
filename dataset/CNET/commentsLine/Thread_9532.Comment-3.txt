jack, i do have another standard 2-key scrolling-wheel mouse to use as a spare, but the one whose pointer keeps disappearing is my fav because it's chrome-plated and monogrammed.
maybe i ought to just tell shiney that if he doesn't stay in his room (usb port), he'll never see another piece of cheese.
or, i could say that if he'll be good, i'll take him to the green bay packers' web site once a day.
