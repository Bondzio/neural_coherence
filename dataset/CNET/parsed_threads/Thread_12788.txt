<s> I am currently about to build my first machine. </s>
<s> I know a bit about PC's, however, being that I am a bonafied noobie I would some suggestions or slaps across the face with my decision. </s>
<s> My motherboard is an Intel DG965WH Series and my chip is an Intel Core Duo 6300. </s>
<s> My goal is to get this machine to run smoothly, as I am an avid MMO player and my machine at home is about to become my wifes. </s>
<s> I guess my question comes down to, how do I pick out the right power supply so as to power my machine and get it to accept the specs I want, and are there any restrictions about the case I pick. </s>
<s> My goal is to hook up a 320 GB hard drive ( most likely 7200 RPM Maxtor ) 2 GB of RaM ( PC4200 )and a PCI-E Nvidia graphics card ( 256mb or above ). </s>
<s> Any help or general slaps in the face would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Congratulations on diving into your first build! </s>
<s> Gaming computers need good airflow to dissipate heat, so the really small cases aren't recommended. </s>
<s> You could get away with a standard ATX mini-tower, but you probably will be happiest with the room provided by a standard ATX mid-tower case. </s>
<s> Look at the system requirements for the particular make and model of video card that you intend to install in the computer. </s>
<s> The general idea is to surpass the minimum PSU requirements listed for that video card. </s>
<s> The manual for the motherboard states that it takes a standard ATX12V PSU. </s>
<s> Get a 20+4pin PSU from a good manufacturer with a maximum Wattage rating that surpasses the video card's requirements. </s>
<s> Also pay attention to what Amp rating the video card requires on the PSU's +12V rail. </s>
<s> A high-end video card can require over 30A. </s>
<s> Get a book from the local library and read about it. </s>
<s> At least, get to know and understand about the technical terms used in froums responses. </s>
<s> Good luck with your endeavour. </s>
<s> Thanks to both of you. </s>
<s> I've been doing plenty of research believe me. </s>
<s> I've decided to go with the Mid-Tower AthenaTech with a 400W PSU. </s>
<s> Will be adding a 120mm fan into front when it arrives then place all into it and either cry tears of joy or take cover when it blows up. </s>
