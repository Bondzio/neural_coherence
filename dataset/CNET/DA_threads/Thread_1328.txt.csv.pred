1.1.1	I tried to install FlashPlayer and got message the installer i was using was corrupted I do n't know what to do ?	Ques
1.1.2	Also on FB it is suggesting to update to IE 8 .	St
1.1.3	The last time I update IE it messed up my HP Printing the Photo Director/Imaging program .	St
1.1.4	IT Would n't scan .	St
1.1.5	I do n't know whether to update to this browser or not .	St
1.2.1	In my opinion , I would not install the current IE8 , I find it is still way too buggy .	St
1.2.2	You would be better off installing another browser ( ie : Firefox , Chrome , or Safari ) , as they all support the latest flash player ( unless you 're running with a 64 bit browser , Adobe Flash Player does n't yet support 64 bit versions of any browser ) .	St
