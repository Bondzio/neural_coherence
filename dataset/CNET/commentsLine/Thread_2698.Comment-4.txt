remember that people have brought me these firewire problems for years.
no one shows me a working system.
yes somewhere for some it does work.
but when people tell me of trouble you will get my take on firewire.
again it's either another firewire + windows disaster or you have a defective drive.
i read that you write formatting.
tell me if you made the parttitions.
if not, remove then, create them and try one more time.
on xp i'd suggest a quick format.
same for vista if you can since formatting large drives can take a very very long time.
