Answer Customer confidentiality is a priority to Western Digital.
When a drive is received at our facility, it is put through a rigorous testing process for analysis.
During this process, all data on the drive is completely erased, and therefore irrecoverable.
Consequently, if you need to recover the data on the drive, you must do so before returning the drive to us.
As was stated in the above paragraph, once we receive the drive, all data is completely erased and irrecoverable.
