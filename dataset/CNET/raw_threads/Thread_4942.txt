About the same time there was no picture on the monitor. There was a message on my monitor that said it was working to check the cable and the computer. I turned the computer off and disconneted the cable and reconneted it and it was ok. But I didn't want to use the computer with a weak power supply. So today the new p/s came and I installed it. But now I get the same message. What do you think? Did the video card bit the dust? When I start the computer I get a beep code of one long and three short. I have award bios with a AMD cpu. If I have missed any need info for a answer let me know and I will try my best to supply it.

I don't know what happen. But I bet it has something to do with the fact that when I started the computer up after I installed the p/s windows started in the safe mode. Any ideas??
