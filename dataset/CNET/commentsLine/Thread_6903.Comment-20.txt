up to you but i used free (recommended) software- i'm a bit of a communist/socialist at heart.
1. back-up with drive image xml- giving you a file (that you can move if you want) of around 20 gb- you can compress if you want.
2. next create a windows installation environment cd.
this will let you boot into windows if your drive crashes.
i used bartpe, search for it and you can include an add-on for drive image xml.
this program uses your windows cd and the add-ons you want to make a version of windows that runs from the cd drive- so you can restore windows.
3. that's it there are no more steps.
this took me 4 days to work out and do- from a pc that booted okay after i had backed up my c drive- last month (docs on separate drive) but then ghost swapped my drive letters around and i lost all my programs, basically started again.
used my disc and recovered everything.
if you do this you will be very confident that you can sort out issues.
