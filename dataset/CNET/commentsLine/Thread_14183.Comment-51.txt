i saved up money from my paper route and bought an ohio scientific os2.
it had a 6502 chip and 8k of ram, which i had to install myself.
i used an old bw television for the monitor and a monkey wards tape recorder.
my next computer i got with money from selling my x-men comic book collection.
i bought a commodore vic20.
i already knew a little basic, so i had a lot fun with that one.
even learned a little assembly language.
i traded it for an atari 400. worst decision ever!
