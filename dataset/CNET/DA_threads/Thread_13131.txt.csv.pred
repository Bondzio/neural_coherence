1.1.1	We have HP desktops (d530S P2.4)in our school labs with 512 Mb RAM in two sticks of 256mb DDR (PC3200).	St
1.1.2	We would like to boot and operate on only 256mb without physically removing one stick of memory.	St
1.1.3	Is there a way to remove and/or disable 256mb or one memory slot, in the operating system (WinXP), in BIOS, or in some other way; short of physical removal?	St
1.1.4	(We want to occasionally run an old application, Art Dabbler, that actually will not run with too much real memory!!)	St
