right now as a ps3 the cell processor is capable of booting the debian linux kernel, with just some configs.
although i use linux and windows in tangent i prefer windows, in which case if i built a cell based pc i would have to do some extensive configuring in order to allow windows to boot, but it is possible.
in my opinion for the processor it is well worth it.
