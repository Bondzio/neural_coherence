This is the only fast processor that fits the board.
http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=80663&affiliate=yahoo I told you I have been away from this sort of thing for a while.
And about all I got from that link was I need a CPU with 512 L2 cache.
(Northwood) And this is the only fast processor I could find that fits that bill.
(I think) Thanks
