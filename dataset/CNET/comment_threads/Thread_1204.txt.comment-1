I am looking to upgrade my wireless network from a netgear mimo range max to the new n. I think I have it narrowed down to the NETGEAR WNDR3700 or the DLink DIR-825.
I really like the ability to set up a guest access point along with the more secure home network.
Another issue is the space where it will sit.
Standing up on edge it the most preferred setup.
I am looking for speed, range and stability.
I already have a set up for multiple drive on the network, and the printer is wireless so the usb port and network sharing on the router is not a major concern.
Also was looking to upgrade the usb pc wireless adapter for the main pc to maximize the benefits.
