<s> G'day, so I could really use some help if there's anyone out there who has an idea. </s>
<s> I've asked around but the jury is still out...motherboard has been the suggested issue although this is a cheap computer so if I am to spend anymore money on it I would want to know it will fix the issue. </s>
<s> Motherboard: ASUS P5K-E Power Supply: Corsair CX430 (new) HDD: WD 500Gb (new) Graphics: HIS 6450 (new) Basically my computer will start up fine 1/300 times. </s>
<s> When it does work it works for a random period before freezing in a random screen, sometimes it works great, other times it seems to be running unusually slow. </s>
<s> In the other 299/300 times when i turn the computer on all it seems to do is power up. </s>
<s> It won't connect any monitor, keyboard, ext HDD etc. </s>
<s> Recently I have noticed that if I turn my computer off at the powerpoint, or leave it off for a long period I find it will power up for 5 secs until it thinks for the first time - and then it turns itself off for about 3 secs - and then it powers up again has a little think and thats about it - it'll stay on in this state and just sit there - still not connecting any external stuff. </s>
<s> It has a brand new internal HDD, power supply and graphics card...things people have previously suggested to be the issue. </s>
<s> The CMOS battery has been removed and then the computer powered up to the same effect, however a new battery has not been tried. </s>
<s> BIOS, drivers etc all up to date. </s>
<s> Cheers. </s>
<s> :) </s>
<s> Replace the dang battery, it will always be incorrect with the battery left out even with corrections will be lost upon the next power-ON. </s>
<s> The CMOS is a few $ and worth it, if the PC is 2yrs. </s>
<s> old or better. </s>
<s> Next, after new battery installed, edit the bios that reflects what is proper, review you manual or allow defaults to rule, provided they match what is required. </s>
<s> Your video may not be the most powerful, though it maybe taxing the PSU abit. </s>
<s> Your PSU is a 430W? </s>
<s> If so, it maybe at the lower end of PC needs and offers a borderline operation of the PC. </s>
<s> Maybe after some time it finally is starting to falter or it's &quot;rail&quot; is less than capable. </s>
<s> These ares of concern. </s>
<s> How much ram is installed and what OS? </s>
<s> Last, it may need a bios update, see what level yours is at and what's available. </s>
<s> That update may correct for some issues provided they explain them(not always). </s>
<s> But, if you have an update that's several levels above your current one, it maybe good to install. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Replaced the battery today, no improvement. </s>
<s> - can't get into the bios as I have no visual. </s>
<s> The psu has only been installed recently and has been running for about 24hrs, would it start to fail after such a short period? </s>
<s> I have 2Gb of ram and windows 7 running - although operating system doesn't strike me as the issue seeing as majority of the problems happen before the OS loads. </s>
<s> Last time the computer was momentarily working I got a computer literate mate of mine to install all new bios and drivers and that wasn't long ago. </s>
<s> Thanks, keep the suggestions coming. </s>
