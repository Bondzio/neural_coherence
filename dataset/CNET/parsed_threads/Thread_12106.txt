<s> I use nero burning rom with win 98 and a tdk cdrw121032 I've got no problems burning data cds, but lately I cannot burn an audio cd from mp3s or wav. </s>
<s> The process halts 2-5% into the burning.. right as the disc seems to be spinning for the first time. </s>
<s> When burning data(or audio when it used to work) there's a pause here, and burning commences. </s>
<s> Attempting to burn an audio disc, everything stays put and the drive, program, sometimes the whole computer locks up if I try to cancel. </s>
<s> If I leave it spinning for 15 minutes, I come back to an error message indicating a SCSI/IDE problem.. </s>
<s> I'm obviously not very keen on the subject.. Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I have seen cases where data or music burning stops working, and shortly after the drive stops all together. </s>
<s> You might try getting one of the CD cleaning kits, see if that helps. </s>
<s> Usually replacing the drive resolves this, and drives have gotten quite inexpensive. </s>
