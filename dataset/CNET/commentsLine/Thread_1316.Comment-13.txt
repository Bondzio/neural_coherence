i have my home computer connected to both my home tv and stereo system.
i am using an appletv unit (with an internal 160gb disk drive) synchronized to itunes on my computer.
it works great!
i have music, photos, and home movies all available on my tv and stereo.
the appletv also gives you youtube video on your tv, and appletv has a great screensaver that allows you to showcase hundreds of your best home photos.
