If you read reviews by CNET of BD players and HDTVs any unit that does not do 24p playback usually gets dinged.
Since tablets and PCs can't do 24p on the internal display and I've yet to see 24p output from a tablet, it's easy to write that BD playback fails on the tablets.
Not to duplicate the WiDrive web page, the answer is yes.
