I built the pc I'm using now.
We cancelled our order with Alienware and decided to build my husband's new gaming rig ourselves.
We spent about $3000 at newegg.com.
Most of the stuff will be here Thursday.
If all goes well he'll be gaming again by Sat.
I think I'll build all my own P.C.s in the future.
This was total B.S.
