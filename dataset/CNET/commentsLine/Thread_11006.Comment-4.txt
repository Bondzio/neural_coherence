if you have a socketed bios chip, its pretty straight-forward in its replacement.
just, remove with care and then ordinate new bios in its place.
your manual or online gotted manual for your mtrbd.
should explain the bios location.
if you're unlucky, you may have a &quot;soldered in&quot; bios chip and should be sent in to be replaced/fixed, not for the uncustomed.
if soyo is senting a replacement, it should be a socketed bios.
you should check if the old bios supported &quot;boot strapping&quot; a very basic boot-up routine to help recover(via reflash) the old bios or similar notation on the topic, dig for it.
