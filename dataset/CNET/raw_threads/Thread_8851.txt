I can use it, but limited functionality. Original software had slick interface for copy, tweak scan settings - resolution, etc. Anyone know how to do this?

Because that is the time for manufacturers can sell newly released models not only supporting the new OS but may have better or updated features. Vista does offer &quot;native support&quot; but is generic or basic but at least it works and doesn't totally abandon the old device. Rarely do 3rd party support get into windoze drivers area unless it is so sorely needed. tada -----Willy

You have a good chance of finding Twain drivers and the Epson Scan Utilities. However, you will probably not find Vista updates for the Control Panel. I believe this provides the functionality you are looking for. NewSoft Inc does have Vista updates of Control Panel for many Epson scanners. There is a charge for this software. I installed it for my Epson Perfection 3170 scanner. It seems to work fine

Epson does have a bare bones twain update, but as far as I can tell so far - it does nothing whatsoever. So would newsoft have a fix to get the control panel up and running on this? Is there any way to get the original software in here to run in compatability mode with XP? When I put the cd in here now it says it can't use it - go to Epson site.

They are probably hoping to sell more scanners as people upgrade to vista... What they are doing is ruining customer confidence in their product line !! If we can't get this scanner some support ,,, why should I or any of you want to buy their printers or scanners !! 1 person - 1 vote - 1 buying decision Ol'Pal

There is no revenue here. But you can cut the cost. Sell yours and get a new one. Even if you get 20 bucks for the old one that's that much less. Bob
