Dial up and broadband ?
Not sure what kind of dialup you can get since the lines are limited to about 64k.
Although tends to be a little tricky to configure internet connection sharing (ICS) is the feature microsoft designed to do this.
It tends to be unreliable when you use it to share high speed connections but works ok for dialup.
If you have a wireless router then you can have your PC share it with the router which will then allow other machines to attach.
If you do not have a router you will have to do direct machine to machine wireless.
You will need to configure your PC wireless to be AD HOC They use to make routers that had ports for modems so you could share that way I have not used dialup in many years.
