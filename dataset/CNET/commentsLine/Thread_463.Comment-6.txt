which isn't bad if it is the valid cpu temp at maximum stress on the cpu.
gamers try to do better, usually at the expense of larger heat sinks and much noisier fans [very high rpm].
they often claim 35 c. btw the cpu will enjoy long life at 46c [may outlast you lol] the best thing that i have found [not in any way a gamer] is a top exhaust fan and a side fan that blows room ambient air directly towards the cpu/hsf
