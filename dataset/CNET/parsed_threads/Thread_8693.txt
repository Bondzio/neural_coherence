<s> For some reason, my wireless receiver decided to stop working this morning. </s>
<s> It's not a battery problem, otherwise the receiver would still light up. </s>
<s> I still get power to the receiver, since I can still charge my mouse, and I sincerely doubt my USB ports died during the night. </s>
<s> I can't get by the BIOS since it doesn't detect a keyboard. </s>
<s> Any advice? </s>
<s> It's a shame when expensive stuff doesn't work. </s>
<s> My wireless pair required me to push some recessed buttons for them to pair up. </s>
<s> I don't know if the Logitech has a similar feature. </s>

<s> Dear Zeke I have this also. </s>
<s> Mine have not stopped working &quot;on their own&quot;, aside from batteries in both the keyboard and the mouse. </s>
<s> Suggest you change the batteries in both pieces first. </s>
<s> There might be enough &quot;juice&quot; left to light up an indicator light but not enough to run the equipment itself. </s>
<s> Bob is right that there is a reset (&quot;connect&quot;) button on the receiver which sits on your desk, not forgetting the one on the underside of the keyboard. </s>
<s> Remember also that there is supposed be about 8&quot; (or whatever) of clear space around the receiver so that it can pick up the signal. </s>
<s> Have you downloaded a Logitech upgrade for these? </s>
<s> I have problems with these and tend to restore back to the earlier software version. </s>
<s> Also, I think Logitech uses some shared files with other apps (DLL's I think but it's a while ago that I came across this). </s>
<s> Is it possible you have deleted software files or removed programs which might have taken away this sharing capability? </s>
<s> Might be necessary to reinstall from Logitech disc if so and then re-upgrade if these work for you. </s>
<s> Regards Mo </s>
<s> you could connect this and if it works, you have isolated the problem to the keyboard (or mouse as the case may be). </s>
<s> Regards Mo </s>
<s> I have installed a lot of these, had a high rate of failure, one client had the keyboard and mouse both die twice in a year and were replaced under warranty, the third time they were out of warranty and they just went back to wired devices. </s>
<s> In other cases they claimed the batteries were pretty new but it didn't work, changing the batteries again resolved it. </s>
<s> As the other message mentions, hitting Connect buttons on keyboard and mouse can usually fix this, but not in many cases I have seen. </s>
