Note that: -&gt; The firewall protection is only applicable if the computers are connected to the internet through that device.
Otherwise, you're not protected.
-&gt; The antivirus protection from McAfee must be installed on each computer.
That will work even when your computers are not connected to that device.
-&gt; You should never disable your antivirus protection, even when connected to that device.
-&gt; You should always use a firewall...you need to install a software firewall for use when you're away from the D-Link device.
