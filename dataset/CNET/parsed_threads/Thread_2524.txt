<s> I currently have an ASUS AMD A8N-E motherboard that only supports DDR RAM. </s>
<s> I have 2GB of 400 MHz Patriot DDR RAM. </s>
<s> If I decide to switch to Intel's new Core 2 Duo processors and, accordingly, replace my motherboard to an Intel-compatible one, would I need to buy new DDR2 RAM for the new motherboard? </s>
<s> Or can I use my DDR RAM in the DDR2-standard motherboard? </s>
<s> It just seems like a waste of a lot of good, fast RAM. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> (most that is) Seems flange a does not fit into slot b. </s>
<s> What waste? </s>
<s> You could sell your old system. </s>

<s> However there are some MBs that indicate accepting DDR and DDR2 and the Intel Core 2 Duo CPUs. </s>
<s> As always ... read the SPECs carefully before buying ..esp the part about ...will your DDR RAM work with the new MB. </s>

<s> You would have to check the specs., but I belive that the mobos that support the intel core 2 duo only accept DDR2 ram. </s>
<s> But check the specs.. </s>
<s> Intel Core 2 Duo CPUs, DDR OR DDR2 and AGP OR PCIe. </s>
