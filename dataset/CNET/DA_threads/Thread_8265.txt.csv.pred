1.1.1	Firewire port on PC not working properly.Pls help .	St
1.1.2	? I have a Dell Inspiron with Windows XP that is about 4 years old.It has 2 firewire ports ( iEEE ) through which I connect my audio interface.I 've never had problem with it so far but yesterday when I connected the interface , I got a light on my interface ( hardware ) but the PC does not seem to recognize it.I tried using a different firewire interface & amp ; the same thing happened.Looks like something is going wrong on the firewire port of my PC.My knowledge on computers is not v good , besides the PC is out of warranty.Can someone tell me what I should do to get the firewire port working well once again ? I tried a new firewire cable & amp ; the problem still exists .	St
1.2.1	Help please.I do n't see the iEEE listed on device manager.This is a Dell Inspiron desktop ( 530s ) running on XP.Do I need to download drivers from anywhere ?	Ques
1.2.2	Answers will be appreciated.Thanks .	St
1.3.1	You need to check the device manager under the control panel area .	St
1.3.2	Goto start- & gt ; control panel- & gt ; system- & gt ; device manager-hardware- ? find listing for firewire .	St
1.3.3	Once found verify its present and shows its working statement .	St
1.3.4	Otherwise , at this point you can re-install the drive from your system disc or have the file downloaded from Dell support website .	St
1.3.5	If the firewire ports are NOT original to the Dell system , then get those drivers from the maker ( or disc ) and continue on once in hand .	St
1.3.6	If none of this correct the problems , then disable the firewire ports within the bios area or remove the pci type card if so installed .	St
1.3.7	Either way , will disable the firewire ports .	St
1.3.8	Once done , buy a pci type firewire card and install using its s/w in order to proceed .	St
1.3.9	Hopefully that cures your problem .	St
1.3.10	Check your manual or Dell support for your model # PC and find info on entering bios .	St
1.3.11	Why , your current firewire ports went bad is something that can happen .	St
1.3.12	However , provided you know the devices installed in the firewire ports are OK , the problem may repeat so be sure everything is OK. Next , if you had some electrical issue , the result is some port can go bad , in this case firewire .	St
