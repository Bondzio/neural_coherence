The problem I am having is sometimes my photos will be 'gray' half way down to the bottom. And they become unusable. The wierd thing is this. I recently purchased a slide program that I can SEE the whole photo but if I try to use it I only see a blank black space. But when I click on the photo again from within the program (not putting it in a slide show), what I see is 3 of the same photo one each on top of the other at different levels. I hope this is making sense. I am afraid to open my photos on the externals as it ruins them...has anyone else had this problem or know what it might be that is causing this?

Reasonably speaking, it isn't updated so stays unchanged. To ensure that, set it to read-only from Windows Explorer, My Computer or command prompt. That way it's safe to experiment with these weird problems, both on your external drive and on internal drives. Kees

If you watch these forums you find some are thinking of these drives LITERALLY as &quot;storage.&quot; They are storage but should never be thought of your archive or backup. Bob
