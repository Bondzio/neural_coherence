1.1.1	Hi I 'm looking at monitors around 23 & quot ; and do n't want something over $ 200 .	St
1.1.2	I found 2 asus monitors that i think would be good .	St
1.1.3	Can someone give me an opinion as to which one you would choose or perhaps another option ?	Ques
1.1.4	I 'm studying 3d modeling and i need a good screen with accurate colors .	St
1.1.5	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16824236095 & Tpk=asus % 20ml238h http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16824236059	Ques
1.2.1	I 'd go with the VH236H .	St
1.2.2	I would prefer the LED backlight offered in the other but it does n't show having a DVI port and I want that capability .	St
1.2.3	As well , the ML238H specifies a glossy black cabinet .	St
1.2.4	I think the VH236H looks glossy too but the bezel is smaller .	St
1.2.5	To me , gloss is a distraction to the eye as it creates reflections .	St
1.2.6	The price of either is n't bad .	St
1.2.7	If you can live with D-sub and HDMI only and do n't mind the glare and larger bezel , an LED backlight has some appeal .	St
1.2.8	I guess that 's a non answer but I 'd recommend that you look closely at the features each offers .	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	I think the Asus ML238H is slightly better hardware wise between LED backlight , which will also help provide better contrast for purer whites and deeper blacks , tilt and swivel stand , and it uses almost half the power of the VH236H , helping a tiny bit on your electric bill .	St
1.4.2	That said , the lack of a DVI port annoys me on general principle , but f your only using 1 monitor and have a HDMI connection then dont worry about it .	St
1.4.3	I also GREATLY prefer the appearance of the VH236H and am actually using a VE246H right now .	St
1.4.4	The & quot ; border & quot ; around the screen is the same size on each side , not larger on the bottom like this one ...	St
1.4.5	I just dont like its appearance .	St
1.4.6	All that said , you realize newegg has & quot ; Deactivated & quot ; the ML238H on their site , meaning it is not simply on backorder , but doubtful they will ever have any to sell again .	St
1.4.7	The VH236H is on backorder and you might need to wait a month but at least it looks like they still CARRY it .	St
