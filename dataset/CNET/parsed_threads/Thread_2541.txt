<s> I've been researching network hardwear for three days and can't find a highly rated pci adapter. </s>
<s> The Linksys WRT54G router is high up there, but the wmp54G pci adapter has been having problems. </s>
<s> Looked at a usr 5416 it lacks WAP, anyone have any ideas on a good combination for a router and pci adapter </s>
<s> D-link. </s>
<s> Cable modem, wired/wireless router, 3 NICs, and wireless PC NIC for the laptop. </s>
<s> Absolutely zero problems, excellent support and free upgrades. </s>
<s> And because all devices are D-link, they all recognize each other and installaion and configuration is a snap. </s>
<s> Whatever you get, don't mix and match brands, you'll be asking for headaches. </s>
<s> Good luck, Click here to see the CNet faces, learn a little about internet connections and data, and download free software. </s>

<s> Thanks for your reply. </s>
<s> I'm from Montana, and am busy raising lean Angus beef and US #1 hard red springwheat to keep all you US citizens healthy with sharp minds, so I greatly appreciate your helping me.Found a D-Link DI-624 router and DWL-G520 adapter that I think will work, or the DWL-G620 (faster). </s>
<s> I read some feedback that said the adapter was a pain to install, so go with DWL-G122 USB adapter, but taking that advice with a grain of salt, can't be that tough can it? </s>
<s> I have a system with Windows 98SE and a new Dell with XP Pro that I want to network. </s>
<s> The adapter will go in XP system. </s>
<s> What is your take on this hardware? </s>
<s> Keep it simple. </s>
<s> My system is about a year old and it includes a DCM-200 cable modem, DI-614+ router, three DFE-530TX+ NICs (internal), and one DWL-650L1 PCMCIA NIC for the laptop. </s>
<s> I firmly believe too many people try to get the most bells and whistles rather than opting for just a good stable system. </s>
<s> I'm not familiar with the newest equipment, but if I were to do it again, I'd choose the same type of equipment. </s>
<s> Nothing fancy, nothing special. </s>
<s> Just a good overall system. </s>
<s> And keep this in mind when you see all the hype about speed. </s>
<s> Any home network will run faster than any cable or DSL connection, so you don't need any Gazillion bit/Byte modem. </s>
<s> File transfer speed is another hype. </s>
<s> The figures of 1 Gb/s speed are a total lie. </s>
<s> Maybe in a testing lab, under perfect conditions, maybe. </s>
<s> But files transfer differently. </s>
<s> Twenty, 1 meg files will transfer slower than one 20 meg file. </s>
<s> It's just the way it works. </s>
<s> I've done it, I've tested it, and I've proved it. </s>
<s> But I digress. </s>
<s> Find a simple system that you like as the prices today are great. </s>
<s> It was once said (by me I think), &quot;The best system you can buy is the one you like.&quot; Good luck, Click here to see the CNet faces, learn a little about internet connections and data, and download free software. </s>

<s> Wayne, thanks for all the help, but I still have some questions. </s>
<s> I want to print form both computers, d-link says I need a di-707 (router w/ print server), dwl-2100ap (access point), along with the dwlg520 adapter, I want to go with the 520 and just the di624 router. </s>
<s> Can I enable windows file&print sharing and get the same job done without any problems? </s>
<s> Can I use my scanner with the same setup. </s>
