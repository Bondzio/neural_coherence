i clean my pc's about once a month.
but i have two cats and they shed more than the vet tells me they should.
if you are a smoker, have little kids, or any pets, i would reccomend a monthly cleaning cycle.
i have heard that vacumes are bad, i've been working with pc's for years and i haven't had any problems.
if you are worried about static, they sell cans of compressed air at most electronics stores (wal-mart also carries the cans) take the pc into the garage, take the covers off, and give it a good blow down.
i personally use an air compressor (handy in the garage) and use a shop vac to get the trouble stuff off of the case.
i wouldn't reccomend using a vacume with a brush inside the case on the electronics.
i haven't had any trouble, but there is a lot of static associated with vacumes.
