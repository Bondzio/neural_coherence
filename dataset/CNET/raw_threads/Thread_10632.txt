5705	3	555187	5270253	5270240	Willy	2/5/12 11:02 AM	1.32843972E12	Typical gamer problem	You may have a &quot;cooling problem&quot; be sure that the PC case is well taken care of. If needed, that the video card has even more air flow or that immediate hot air, pushed out besides what it already does. Since, you seem to be into gaming, all too often cooling issues arise. Prolonged play and/or hi-end usage tends to find the weakest link. Thus, cooling is very important not only to keep up and running but also to reduce any &quot;heat stress&quot;, because once that takes hold, again the weakest part will start to falter though it won't outright fail but produce symptoms such as yours. Also, if possible increase the wattage for your PC as well, 580W, maybe at the edge of good use, but having more is a good thing. If this PC has running well for some time and now seems to be acting up, this a result of heat stress, IMHO. tada -----Willy

Then you are stuck with issues that require you to figure which part is either getting too hot, if there is a part that doesn't work well with the others and ARCANE things like matching the BIOS settings to your RAM. Today I'm beginning to find that such is too much to ask and the sellers of this are not providing support even when you buy from them. Bob

A computer could suffer permanent damage when it stops running abruptly.. These Illegal operations or freezes can, many times, be related to bad or intermittent hardware, or simply mismatched hardware.. Mismatched hardware is common, even some of the large computer manufactures do insufficient analyses and testing when they select the components that make up their systems. Many components that make up a computer just don't play well together..
