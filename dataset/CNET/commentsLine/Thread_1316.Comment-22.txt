in the past year, i have built two htpc's.
each htpc is connected to an hdtv via hdmi and to a receiver using 5.1 analog rca cables.
if you are building one of these, i highly recommend a sound card (e.g.
x-plosion or x-fi-prelude) and receiver setup which uses 5.1 analog (pcm) instead of a digital connection (coaxial or optical).
each htpc is equipped with the lg ggc-h20l blu-ray hd dvd combo drive, 4 x 500 gb sata 3g/s hard drives, an intel q6600 chip, asus mb and 2 gb ram.
they each have an ati video card.
i recommend video cards that are passively cooled (e.g.
ati 3400).
one of my cards, the ati 2600, is far too noisy for a home entertainment environment.
as for streaming high-def video accross your home network, i recommend a wired gigabit router.
i tried wireless n draft, but playing a high-def movie with a wireless connection left the playback choppy.
as for software, i am running vista ultimate.
i highly recommend using my movies to manage you video collection.
it has a windows media centre plug-in and interacts well with powerdvd and daemon tools.
i use powerdvd 8 to play my movies.
