<s> There are too many typographic errors for me to guess what you meant to tell. </s>
<s> For now try the usual CD LENS CLEANER and a fresh post without those errors. </s>

<s> If ANY of those Nero softwares is OEM and you have multiple recorders I've found I need to uninstall Nero and go get the retail version. </s>
<s> i had tried differnce windows on the dvd and tried other nero programs nero 8 and orginal nero 7 and nero 6 and the nero i am currntly using is nero 7 that came with the new dvd any other help please and thank you </s>
<s> That sounds very expensive. </s>
<s> Why would you not just buy that latest retail version? </s>
<s> Keep in mind that Nero doesn't work with all drives or media types. </s>
<s> I dropped a hint earlier about the log containing more clues but let me try BLUNT! </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> What make of the media that fails? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> What firmware version for each drive MAKE and MODEL too please? </s>
<s> nero 7 came with the dvd and a ferind had nero 8 so i setup it and i had nero 6 with the old writer and both of the writers was working on nero very good and the cd rw i had updated it's fireware any way i even had 2 windows they both don't work in both windows windows vista ultimate and xp and i had tried other windows xp an windows vista even windows xp pro and home edtiom and vista ultimate and vista home and they didn't work pease help i can return back the dvd but the old one i need to fix it </s>
<s> The updating of firmware is a well known way to kill off the ability to use the OEM versions of Nero. </s>
<s> You now know why this happens. </s>
<s> -&gt; The only fix I've found is to go back or scrub the drive clean of any sign of Nero then install their latest RETAIL version. </s>
<s> Any OEM version may not do here. </s>
<s> Thanks for the final clue. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> i had updated the cd rw but the dvd still with the orginal fireware what can i do about the dvd ? </s>
<s> This is the bane of the OEM versions. </s>
<s> They seem to do odd things when firmware or drive change. </s>
<s> Glad we've found it. </s>
<s> Since you don't have the full retail copy look to freeware DVD and other creation/burning programs. </s>
