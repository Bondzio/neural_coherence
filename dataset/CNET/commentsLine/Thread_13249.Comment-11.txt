how is the printer connected to the network?
is it connected to the main pc (the one with the router) or is it connected to an access point on the network?
i don't think that a printer with a parallel connection to the main pc can print jobs from other pcs connected wirelessly.
as far as i know, the printer must be on an access point which is part of the wireless network.
someone please correct me if i'm wrong because i had the same problem and was never able to share the printer with my wireless pcs.
i currently have one pc connected via ethernet and i can print from that one.
