[img]  [/img] this morning i turned on my pc, all of a suddend i hear a horrifying roaring noise coming out of my pc chasis: eeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrr faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa huuuummm_huuuummm_huuummmm_huuummmm after a while, i noticed the noise is starting to fade away more and more as seconds passes by, when windows finished booting, i could barely hear it, after 5 mins the noise is completely gone.
but i'm so very worried.
i live in hong kong, it's been raining all week and there are alot of mouisures in the air, not to mention alot of flies and insects flying around, and i didn't turn on my pc for at least 3 days, so i was wondering if any of the above faactors cause this noise, or if it's something much worst.
i checked my 2 chasis fans, they're spinning, i'm sure there's nothing clogging them though, that's all i know and so my main concerns are: - what are the noises?
-are the electricity frying my motherboard?
-if a bug got insde my pc and i turn my pc on, will the whole pc fry up?
-there was a thunder strike this morning, but i turned on my pc after the thunder strike has ended, but still, does this have to do with anything?
please answer all my question!
this is an emergency, please help me, please i beg you please help me!
t_t thanks for the help.
