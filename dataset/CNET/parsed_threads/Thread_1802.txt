<s> A few weeks ago, I picked up a music CD I wanted to rip to my iTunes library. </s>
<s> At the time I was not connected to the internet, so the artist/album/song titles were not automatically added. </s>
<s> I manually renamed the songs from &quot;Track 1&quot; etc. </s>
<s> to their real names, and created a folder with the artist's name as its title (all from within iTunes). </s>
<s> Upon renaming the folder, the entire CD simply disppeared and I have not been able to recover it. </s>
<s> Is this an issue with iTunes' DRM? </s>
<s> Does anyone know what really happened? </s>
<s> A lot has been said about DRM and it is getting the blame for everything. </s>
<s> DRM only applies to music that you download from the Apple iTunes Music store. </s>
<s> There is NO DRM on store purchased CD's By Folder, do you mean playlist? </s>
<s> Was it a smart playlist? </s>
<s> Music that is ripped into iTunes does not just go away. </s>
<s> Take a look at your library and click on the Name column. </s>
<s> This sorts all the library by alphabetical name. </s>
<s> Be like Santa, check it twice. </s>
<s> Even if you delete a playlist, the tracks still stay in the library, even though the &quot;folder&quot; is no longer there. </s>
<s> If all else fails, rip it again. </s>
<s> It doesn't take long, and then you will find the duplicates P </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> and these can be ripped into iTunes and burned out as many times as you want to. </s>
<s> DRM is applied only to those tracks that are purchased from the iTunes Music Store and the DRM information is coded as part of the track. </s>
<s> These tracks have a limited burn potential. </s>
<s> I think the limit is 5 but do NOT quote me on that, it could be higher. </s>
<s> There are also limits on the number of machines you can copy that file to. </s>
<s> Each machine has to be authorized, done locally, so that DRM usage can be controlled. </s>
<s> Burning the purchased tracks out to a CD and then ripping back in again, overcomes the limitation. </s>
<s> Should you feel the need. </s>
<s> This was the way that M$ advocated it's WMP users use to move iTunes music into WMP. </s>
<s> This advice has since been removed from the M$ website, perhaps partly because they realized that translating a track from MP4 to MP3 or worse still WMA, was just asking for poor quality. </s>
<s> However, if you are foolish enough to be using WMP on the other side, you will find that M$ feels it necessary to question your honesty when it comes to CD's that you have legally purchased and ripped into WMP. </s>
<s> Transferring these tracks to another PC, or even the same one with a new HD, will prompt WMP to cast doubt on your integrity. </s>
