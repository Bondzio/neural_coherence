1.1.1	I have an AMD Athlon clocked at 1.6 GHz .	St
1.1.2	Now a while back my dad thought it would be a good idea to take all of the computer in the house , scrap them of there best parts and make the best pc of the best parts we had , some how this didnt work and definatly didnt work for me becuase I like to have my own pc so we evenutally put our stuff back in its rightful place ... My mother board and cpu was never touched , however after all this moveing of hardware my CPU 's clock speed dropped and i dont understand why it would do this ? !	Ques
1.1.3	It whent from a 2.1GHz to a 1.6GHz and i do notice the difference while gameing .	St
1.1.4	I know my best bet would to just buy a new one and belive me i want to , however im short on cash due to all my funds goin into a car .	St
1.1.5	Any one now what i can do , maybe over clock it ( by the way it was over clocked before so maybe the bios was reset , i dont know ) but Im severly lacking in power when i know it used to be much faster ...	St
1.1.6	I dont know if my processor is just slowing down , windows is reading it wrong , or something else .	St
1.1.7	I dont think its heating up becuase i bought a mosnter fan/heatsink for it a while back .	St
1.1.8	so if any one can help me that whould be great .	St
1.1.9	thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	The FSB setting is not proper .	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	Hello , You need to set the FSB in the BIOS .	St
1.4.2	If you give us the make & model of the motherboard & CPU we will be able to give you exact instructions .	St
1.4.3	Refer to the motherboard manual more details .	St
1.5.1	... over chip rating and speed too .	St
1.5.2	CPU 's do not simply & quot ; slow down & quot ; , because they do n't suffer old ages issues ! .	St
1.5.3	Buying another CPU is n't the answer .	St
1.5.4	The idea that Windows , is misreading the CPU certainly is n't the problem either .	St
1.5.5	An OS does n't determine the speed of the CPU .	St
1.5.6	That 's like saying your skin determines how fast you think !	St
1.5.7	All 1.6Ghz AMD Athlons are labelled in the XP2000 / XP2100 region ( without more exact details I ca n't be any more specific ) , and this may be what you 're remembering .	St
1.5.8	The fact that & quot ; front side bus & quot ; seemed to be a marsian term for you , likely indicates that you were not overclocking , because & quot ; FSB & quot ; is the most basic and easy part of overclocking .	St
1.5.9	If that term is an unkown to anyone who thinks they are overclocking , they simply are n't overclocked !	St
1.5.10	It 's not impossible that a 1.6Ghz Athlon can overclock to 2.1Ghz ( a relatively massive 31 % overclock !	St
1.5.11	) , but not without doing a load of FSB tweaks , CPU jumper bridging , multiplier testing , core voltage changes , RAM adjustments , and BIOS resets trying to get there !	St
1.5.12	Sorry , it just seems more and more likely you 're remember the CPU speed and the CPU rating , and confusing the two .	St
1.5.13	GeeBee .	St
1.6.1	i got it figured out ... some how the cmos got reset , like i said , it was over clocked before , i just had to do it again .	St
1.6.2	however im now haveing problems with my graphics card .	St
