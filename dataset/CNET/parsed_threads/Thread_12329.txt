<s> I have a Cisco 3750 Wireless controler with multiple access points. </s>
<s> Everything is up and running except for when I restart and laptop with wireless connections I get the IP Address conflict popup on my computers. </s>
<s> I am setup with Static IP addresses and am positive there are no duplicate nodes. </s>
<s> The laptop will connect in the morning fine but if I restart the laptop it conflicts. </s>
<s> Looking for alittle advice if there is a function of the wireless that would hold the address looking for the old connection and not refresh with the new connection? </s>
<s> network still works fine and I am able to access and my data but the popup is an annoyance and I think it is messing with my wireless printers when they go into standby and conflicting connections. </s>
<s> And through no fault of your own. </s>
<s> If you are using anything less than WPA security then I see many rogue users (see SMAC and other tools like it) can hijack what an admin may think was a reserved IP. </s>
<s> After the IT staff gets a little more seasoned they return to DHCP and WPA to avoid all the lost hours. </s>

<s> This is happening on all my laptops in the buliding, over a dozen. </s>
<s> I need to keep static IP's due to my process scope. </s>
<s> pinging the IP's all timeout as soon as I turn off the laptops so there is nothing on that IP. </s>
<s> Any other sugestions? </s>
<s> I will tighten up and change security and see if this helps but I am only seeing my computers on my Domain with no other traffic. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I wonder if someone hard assigned the ethernet address (as opposed to the wifi address.) </s>
<s> as i notcied , i have same problem on my wireless network , i am using Linksys WRT54G router , before i used D-LINK router and got same problem ... it is better to disable DHCP Server and enter IP addresses with Static Mode . </s>
