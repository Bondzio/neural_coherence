3478	0	310293	2869202	NR	dotted8	9/28/08 12:40 PM	1.2226056E12	Memory Replacement Problem	I took BMF's advice and upgraded the memory on my 1.67 GHz PPC Powerbook (DDR2 SDRAM PC2-4200S). I found the compatible ram (PC2-4200 DDR2 533 MHz) and ordered it from Newegg (two Kingston KTA-PB533/1G one gig sticks). I removed the old 512 and inserted the two 1 gig sets. When I tried to power back up, all I got was a blank screen, a couple of audible beeps and a sleep indicator light sequence of four flashes and then steady (repeating sequence). I took both 1 gig rams out and switched them around but still no luck. I put the original 512 back in and stacked one of the 1 gigs on top, still no luck. Finally, I removed the 1 gig and left just the original 512 in and it worked again... Am I failing to do some step before powering back up?

They have just released a scanner that will tell you exactly what RAM you need for you machine and will guarantee that it will be correct and working. Life time warranty. Just a thought P
