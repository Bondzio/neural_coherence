If the HDD is older than 4 or 5 years it would be wiser to buy a completely new drive; 2. Insert the Windows XP CD, turn on computer; 3. Press &quot;Delete&quot;, F2, or whatever key is indicated in the BIOS bootup screen to enter'setup'; 4. In BIOS Setup, find Boot Options (sometimes under Advanced Options) and set the CD drive as the boot drive. Follow the instructions on the BIOS screen for naavigation and save & exit; 5. Boot to XP CD, when it gets to a certain point it will tell you there is another OS on the Hard Drive, your choice will be to delete the partition, then create a new partition, then format (quick format), then install. It is all automated just make the right choices. Best of luck, Tony
