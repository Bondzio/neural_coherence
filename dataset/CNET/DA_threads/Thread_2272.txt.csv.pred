1.1.1	I use a wireless network at home with a linksys broadband router.	St
1.1.2	I would like to have wireless access to my HP 1012 LaserJet printer, which is located next to the router, but there is no PC connected.	St
1.1.3	We use 2 laptops and only the one printer at home.	St
1.1.4	I am unsure whether to use a wired print server such as D-Link DP301-U to connect the router to the printer or to get a linksys wireless print server.	St
1.1.5	Which would be easiest in terms of use and configuration?	St
1.1.6	I'm a novice at networking.	St
1.1.7	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	mainly because it is physically a simpler device so there is less that can go wrong.	St
1.2.2	Hope this helps frank	St
