when i googled the entire error message, microsoft spit out a page saying to increase the virtual memory (mine was at 2000mb, and i increased it to the maximum 4000 something), and to to turn off the memory dump file.
while increasing virtual memory doesn't seem like it would be a bad thing, i'm not sure why i have a memory dump file.
is there anything hurt by either?
