Let me be blunt.
Today's motherboards have too many changes from what was in there.
DON'T DO IT.
Why should I list the parts you'll save?
But in short let's skip to what is the best update to get some gaming out of that box.
I suggest you look at this list -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-cards,1805.html for your AGP slot then check the power supply rating and call it quits.
The headaches of saving what may be the case, the CD/DVD drive and nothing else is usually not worth it.
Even the OS may fail to relocate and many don't plan on that.
