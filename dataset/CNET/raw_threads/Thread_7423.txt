This past Wednesday I was at a friend's house and connected to his network, surfing the internet without incident. However, I shut down to take the back cover off so I could show him where the RAM was located (he had new RAM coming in the mail the following day and had never installed it before). Although we did remove my RAM a couple of times, I doubt it has anything to do with the problem because I'm not having any problems at home with my own wireles network connectivity. But at his house, once I rebooted I could never reconnect to his network. Today I had the identical problem at another friend's house. In each case their network was listed with a strong signal, but when I tried to connect received an error saying the signal was weak. I have tried what little I knew to fix the problem, but got no where. Wireless is something where my knowledge is very limited, so any help would be greatly appreciated.

That is something like SSID not broadcasting and the next connect fails. I can't explain why this doesn't always work since you can imagine the number of times this comes up in the forum. So here's my advice. Read the forum sticky on what we have found to work in most cases. Bob

If you had shared the setup details I may not have started with the forum sticky and thought of something else, but those details are not here (settings, router make, model, version, firmware version, if the laptop works at a free wifi hotspot.)
