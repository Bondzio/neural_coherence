<s> Dell Dimension L668r 127RAM, WIn 98 2nd, DSL I wanted to upgrade my computer's memory and got a Crucial MT200314 memory addition. </s>
<s> It is not the one recommended for my DEll but it looks exactly the same as the listed one. </s>
<s> My question- if it fits perfectly, will it work? </s>
<s> Thanks, Bob </s>
<s> Just because it looks the same, internally it may be different. </s>
<s> You cannot just pick up a RAM stick and expect it to work. </s>
<s> It must be matched to the system board, clock, BIOS, existing RAM, etc. </s>
<s> Go to crucial.com and use the Wizard. </s>
