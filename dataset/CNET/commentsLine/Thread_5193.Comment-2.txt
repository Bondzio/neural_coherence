you will need a power supply that has both a 6 pin connector, and an 8 pin connector.
also note, that you will have to make sure your case is very well ventilated, as i have read that these cards get really hot &quot;..ouch!
using some amd monitoring software, we noted idle temperatures of between 65 70-degrees celsius from the core die and that is just sitting in windows.
at full load halfway through a 3dmark06 benchmark run, we noted a maximum temperature of 84-degrees celsius from the core die in other words, very hot!
