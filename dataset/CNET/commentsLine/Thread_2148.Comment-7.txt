if you have nero 6 ultra in there, i can safely give you the site to get it.
it is the nerovision express 3, package 2. i had to remove nero mediahome,nero photosnap (take your photos out of the computer, it did mess with mine), nero photosnap viewer & nero showtime (i have powerdvd).
all on theis link is the updated version of 4.4.1.4 and everything is updates at:  ps - i was incorrect about needing both.
in a magazine i get, it has dvdshrink, nero recode, anydvd, intervideo dvd copy 4, dvd dycrypter and #1 dvd ripper (add dvd santa to that!!)
this magazine has instructions on how to build a laptop with what you want in it.
broke hip in dec 2005 and wound up getting it, sent card from rehab.
