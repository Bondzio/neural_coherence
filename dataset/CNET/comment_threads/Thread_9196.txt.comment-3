Looking in the Bios, Primary IDE and Slave aere not detected.
THE IDE controller is set to BOTH.
UPON STARTUP THE MESSAGE IS FLASHING &quot;2+0 STRIPE IS OFFLINE&quot;, however, the computer starts and runs fine.
The device manager lists the disk drive as, Promise 1+0 Span scsi device, and under Properties for this drive the 2 boxes (disable tagged queing, and Disable synchronous transfers) are both unchecked.
So, what will happen if I replace the dead drive?
