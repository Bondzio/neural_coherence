1.1.1	hello , i would like set up a wireless connection with a friend of mine who lives about 20km away .	St
1.1.2	I would like to know which antenna 's I should get and how to set them up .	St
1.1.3	There is a clear line of sight from my house to his .	St
1.1.4	The connection will be for file transfer and gaming , so it needs to be quite fast .	St
1.1.5	any advice would be appreciated	Polite
1.2.1	Going that distance gets to be a professional project very quickly since there are many factors involved .	St
1.2.2	This antenna is one of the largest you can get .	St
1.2.3	It will not be the antenna that costs the money though .	St
1.2.4	http : //www.wlanparts.com/product/HDGD24-24P-NF/24-GHz-24dBi-Heavy-Duty-Grid-parabolic-dish-N-Female.html You now have the problem of what do you attach to the antenna .	St
1.2.5	You can either buy expensive microwave cable to bring the signal inside to a cheap router/radio or you can buy a expensive waterproof router/radio to mount outside on the antenna .	St
1.2.6	For performance reasons you are better off mounting the electronics on the back of the antenna .	St
1.2.7	Does not help a lot if you buy a huge antenna and then lose all the signal in the cabling .	St
1.2.8	If you are handy people do mount consumer routers outside in home made enclosures but it does not work well if you live in a area where the sun will cook the electronics in the summer .	St
1.2.9	You will want electronics that has the greatest transmit power and best sensitivity to receive .	St
1.2.10	Be aware there are legal limits on how much power you can transmit which varies from country to country and type of antenna .	St
1.2.11	You also want to be up as high as you possible can .	St
1.2.12	When you go the distance you are talking about the ground tends to absorb signal .	St
1.3.1	thanks , we both live on opposite sides of a valley so we are pretty high off the ground .	Polite
1.3.2	i can mount the antenna in a shaded area , side of my house which should remove the problem of the sun .	St
1.3.3	Can you please tell me what hardware we will need on both ends to make it work .	Sug
1.3.4	like router 's bridge 's etc and how to set them up .	St
1.3.5	thanks	Polite
1.4.1	http : //www.google.com/search ? hl=en & amp ; q=20km+wifi It appears you could take advantage of prior discussions .	St
1.4.2	Bob	St
1.5.1	LOL sorry , did n't check for that .	Polite
