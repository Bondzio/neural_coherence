<s> Hi there, I am a pc novice and need some help choosing the correct casing for my Maxtor 320 gb hd. </s>
<s> It's about 6 mths old and out of the blue died...it seems to be getting no power, the led light flickers but it makes no sound to indicate power is going to it. </s>
<s> After doing some poking around I've concluded that my options are 1)Pay Maxtor $700 to recover my data and then get my hd replaced 2) Try to fix it myself for cheap and void my warranty I'm going with option 2 because I am PISSED at Maxtor and wouldn't trust them again with my $ or my data. </s>
<s> Can anyone help with recommendations on cases or any other advice or possible issues that it could be? </s>
<s> It's a Maxtor OneTouch III 320GB Hard Drive - Interface (USB 2.0) External Hard Drive. </s>
<s> So I have to open the drive housing up first to know which type to order. </s>
<s> I have opened the box and from my limited experience and research, I think that it's a PATA. </s>
<s> I see the 40 pin connector etc... Now that I have voided my warranty (yay!) </s>
<s> what should I do next? </s>
<s> I would like to get my data of off it, I'm pretty sure that the drive is functioning and that it was a case/power issue. </s>
<s> I appreciate your help in advance. </s>
<s> Newegg.com and pick out a nice IDE USB 2.0 housing. </s>
<s> I just wanted to say thanks for the help. </s>
<s> I went to Newegg and bought a Venus DS3, popped in the hard drive and was back in business in 5 mins. </s>
<s> Thanks for helping me get my data back and saving $700 not to mention frustration. </s>
<s> There is something to be said for DIY! </s>
<s> Yes, you can save quite a bit in no time with just a little direction if you are willing. </s>
<s> You did all the work, I only pointed so all the kudos are yours. </s>

<s> I have E-X-A-C-T-L-Y the same problem and I would like to purchase the same case but in order to not complicate things, I would like to know how can I differentiate if my external hard drive is SATA or PATA? </s>
<s> I bought it new around 7 months ago and the only information that the label has is: Model Maxtor Personal Storage 3200. </s>
<s> I know the capacity is 500 GB. </s>
<s> Do you think that if I buy the same case would save my data? </s>
<s> Thanks for your valuable input. </s>

<s> You'll just have to try it. </s>
<s> No way to tell otherwise. </s>

<s> Scroll down to &quot;Access and interfaces&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive &quot;Bridge circuitry is sometimes used to connect hard disk drives to buses that they cannot communicate with natively, such as IEEE 1394 and USB.&quot; Sourced from...Wikipedia. </s>
<s> It may not be SATA or PATA. </s>
<s> I'd contact Maxtor directly or search there site again for the more information. </s>
<s> From wikipedia: &quot;FireWire/IEEE 1394 and USB(1.0/2.0) HDDs are external units containing generally ATA or SCSI disks with ports on the back allowing very simple and effective expansion and mobility&quot; See link above. </s>

<s> I have seen both IDE (PATA) and SATA drives in the usual USB 2.0 enclosures. </s>
<s> At least it's easy to tell the difference when I open the case up for inspection. </s>
<s> You might want to straighten that out on Wikipedia. </s>
<s> You can you know. </s>
<s> I bet you have a lot you could share there. </s>
<s> If you edit it let me know. </s>
<s> that shows otherwise ? </s>
