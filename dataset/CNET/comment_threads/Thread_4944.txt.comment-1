Whenever I try to access a my tablet PC running Windows vista 32-bit from my desktop running windows 7 64-bit I get a password prompt, however I cannot login with the login used on my tablet or my desktop.
I get the same problem if I try to access the desktop from my PC.
They are in the same workgroup and password protected sharing is off, what else could be causing this problem?
