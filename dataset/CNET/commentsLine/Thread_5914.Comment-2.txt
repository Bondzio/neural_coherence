dvd burners generate a lot of heat and can fail.
i'd let it sit overnight and try with a cool machine.

my home built with more power than yours, and with a dvd and cd burner generates a lot of heat.
i have placed a new 12v.
fan just behind the optical drives and it blows onto the rear of the drives and pushes air above and below the drives.
btw, this makes a total of 7 fans.
if you have two drives, and the rack space for one more, place an empty bay between the two drives.
this will allow more ventilation.
good luck, telephony facts, analog/digital explained.
see the cnet faces behind the posts.
i think computer viruses should count as life.
i think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive.
we've created life in our own image.
