I think, I would still need to subscribe to Comcast TV or DishTV to get the signals and channels I need. Is this right? Only thing maybe, I will not need a DVR and can use the PC as a DVR to record/pause TV programs. PC does not have a wireless card, so this means TV needs to be plugged to PC directly and PC turned on each time I want to see TV or use record/pause DVR features. Is all the above correct? Anyone heard of Satellite TV on PC. Here's the url: http://www.the-free-tv.com/index3.html They say we can watch 100's of channels for free ($67 initial fee) on PC, provided there's internet connection. Is this a hoax? anyone using this service? How is the reception/service? Thanks Rajat

You can install a PCI tv satellite card and receive satellite tv on your computer monitor. The reception is extremely clean as it's digital and your monitor will make the picture better than a tv but not as good as HDTV. You can find any additional help on the forums there and no question goes unanswered and is generally answered in a matter of hours, seldom more than a day or two.
