you truly need to check the specs/details of your mtrbd.. just what it does support.
if you find no mention of pc3200, then it doesn't support it(fully).
if you ordered pc2100 and got a pc3200 which can be used in some systems, only because they are better capable.
you have a epox mtrbd.
which is more of a beginning/entry type system.
its chipset and others become limited in supporting &quot;fully populated&quot; ram slots as a timing issue arises.
not only that, but you have 3-different ram sizes and ras/cas reports, this isn't ideal.
your results are to be expected or arise sooner or later.
basically, nothing you can do, other than get another new module like you've received, remove the others(256&512mbs) and/or order 2-1gb of pc2700(return the pc3200).
use only 2 ram slots to help resolve this issue as well.
some have regressed the ram timing, etc.
to get it to work, but that basically forces it to be slower and what's the point of having fast ram.
