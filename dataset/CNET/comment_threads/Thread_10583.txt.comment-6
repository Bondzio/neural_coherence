Just for the heck of it download a free trial of Nero to the system and try that, you have nothing to lose unless of course you have a buddy who has a Nero or Roxio disk you can load.
For Vista it would have to be a pretty current version of either.
But I would give it a shot, especially since it shows in device manager.Good luck!
