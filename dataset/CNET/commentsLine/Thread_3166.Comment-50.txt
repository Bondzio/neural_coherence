i wish i knew a definite answer, but in my experience i had two external hard drives, a mybook(400gig) and a maxtor one touch(500gig)that died after 12 months each.
i asked maxtor to give me an estimate to restore my files and they quoted $3000.00 without even looking at it.
obviously, i didn't do it.
luckily, i still had most(but not all!!!)
of my info in the hard drive, so i just bought a couple of more and it's been about 15 months now and everything is working fine.
i have made dvds with my photos and made some dvds(compressed)for some of my music as well, just in case.
