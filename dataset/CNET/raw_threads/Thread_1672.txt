Hey guys, I just moved to a new apartment where I'm surrounded by a lot of businesses that offer free wifi access. My question is, can I just latch on to their connection(s) and say goodbye to my ISP? What it comes down to is, I don't need a land line or cable tv - I just want high-speed internet as cheaply (yet ethically) as possible. Is this feasible, and what kind of equipment do I need? (running Win98, standard PC with PCI slot) Thanks for any advice - I've been on dialup for years and have no idea how wifi works. -eve

I will totally get permission - bad karma I don't need! BUT - do you have any suggestions on what equipment I need? Is it a Wireless Network Adapter? Or a router? Or what..? Thanks again ... eve

It will also be more convenient and you can make the service calls to the ISP when there is trouble. Some cable, DSL, and other broadband Internet services are getting cheaper. Some entry level services are as low as $14.95/month. If you do use wireless hotspots or share someone else's service (with permission), you computer will need a wirless network adapter. Many newer notebooks ship with an internal wireless adapter. If yours doesn't, you can get a PC-Card or external USB wireless adapter. Get a wireless-g (802.11g) compatible adapter for high compatibility. Wireless-g is compatible with wireless-g and wireless-b networks. You can get a wireless-a/g adapter that is compatible with a, b, and g networks.
