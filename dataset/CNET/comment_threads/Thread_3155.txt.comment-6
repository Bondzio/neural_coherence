I think it is just my own way of doing things.
Even with my ancient machine, I have 3 internal hard drives and 10 external hard drives.
I won't go into the reasoning for this - just that it is the way I do things.
Two video Ports is great.
I am going to split the difference between the Haswell and its many cores and the dual core.
At this moment I am planning on going with Intel's DZ77GA70K mobo and Intel Core i7 3770K which are compatible.
The Mobo will support 9 SATA ports.
Thanks again for your thoughts, they are always most helpful.
