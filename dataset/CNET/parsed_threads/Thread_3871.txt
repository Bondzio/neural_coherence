<s> Hi, I currently have a Fujitsu-Siemens Scaleo P, with a motherboard model GA-8I848PM. </s>
<s> I have 1 x 512 DDR RAM installed, and am looking to upgrade this. </s>
<s> I believe that the RAM i have installed at the moment is PCR 2700, although I can't be sure. </s>
<s> I need to know whether I should add another 512 RAM, another 1GB, or take the existing RAM out and replace it with 1GB. </s>
<s> I am not sure whether there will be a great difference between these 3 options, and was hoping someone would help me out with making a decision. </s>
<s> I know that my computer does not support duel-channel memory. </s>
<s> Another website suggested that I buy a stick of RAM PCR 2300, but I'm not sure whether this will be different to buying another PCR 2700 as I have no idea what that actually means. </s>
<s> Can anyone help out? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> sorry i meant PCR 3200, not 2300 </s>
<s> it should tell you about adding RAM and whether it's advantageous to add in pairs or not. </s>
<s> Many of today's systems are built with dual channel memory architecture which means it is advantageous to add in DIMMs in pairs...2@512MBs vice 1@1GB. </s>
<s> If you download and run CPUZ .. it should tell you what RAM you have in your system and whether it's one DIMM or two DIMMs. </s>

<s> Interestingly enough your computer shipped with four different models of motherboards, so the motherboard model sure helped. </s>
<s> Before purchasing, please confirm you have two RAM slots and not four, just in case. </s>
<s> If that is correct, you can install a 1GB stick of RAM if you like, with no need to remove the 512MB, bumping it up to 1.5GB. </s>
<s> You could likewise just insert another 512MB stick to reduce the cost, totaling 1GB. </s>
<s> As to PC3200 vs PC2700, the higher the number the faster it is, generally speaking. </s>
<s> You can safely mix-and-match PC3200 with PC2700, which results in all RAM running at the slower of the speeds. </s>
<s> Ideally you'd want all PC3200, but it's better to have 1.5GB running as PC2700 than 1GB running as PC3200. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, John </s>
<s> Yes I have 2 RAM slots, not four. </s>
<s> I think I will do as you suggested and add another 1GB to the spare slot. </s>
<s> There will be no difference between purchasing PCR 2700 or 3200? </s>
<s> Not even in price? </s>
<s> PC2700 runs slower than PC3200, but since you already have a PC2700 stick it doesn't matter which you choose as it would be forced to run at the slower PC2700 speed. </s>
<s> As far as price is concerned, that varies. </s>
<s> There are frequently sales that make PC3200 cheaper than PC2700 or vice versa, so just shop around for both and snag the best deal. </s>
