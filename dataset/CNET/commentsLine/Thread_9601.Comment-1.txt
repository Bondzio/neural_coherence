epson has had archival priter ink for several years.
i find that they will not recycle used cartridges w/o a $5 - $10 fee!
(outrageous) anyway, hp seems to have a fairly fade proof ink but i can't get &quot;vivera&quot; ink for my printer.
i use a photosmart c5580 and use 75xl and 74xl.
has anyone an opinion on the ink and it's permanance?
have you found the color to be fade proof???
