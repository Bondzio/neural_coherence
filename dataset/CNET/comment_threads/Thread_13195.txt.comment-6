256mb is enough for this class card... 512mb isn't necessary unless its free like with this $92 ($72 after rebate) card: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102064 here's a geforce 7600gt for $100 ($85 after rebate): http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130062 these cards can play most current games (including oblivion) so it may be overkill for you.
for aero, you just need a entry-level card with 128mb like this geforce 6200 for $42: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130067 i'd still recommend the radeon since it fits your budget and if you ever do get the itch for a game that needs some horsepower, you'd be all set.
