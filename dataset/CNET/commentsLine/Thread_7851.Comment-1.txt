i'm planning on buying a new laptop soon since my current hp zt3000's monitor does not work properly (works 1/50 times the laptop is turned on) so it's constantly hooked to an external and... well, no longer a laptop (costs around $600 to have it fixed by buying a new motherboard).
i remember when i bought a desktop 6 years ago i went with an amd because they were generally cheaper than the pentiums, and performance-wise they were almost the same.
with all this new intel dual-core, inter core duo and amd dual-core, i'm kinda lost now.
what's the best option out there?
