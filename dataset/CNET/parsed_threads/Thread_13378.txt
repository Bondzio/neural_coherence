<s> I own a Averates laptop computer model 3300 Series. </s>
<s> I used to access the Internet via a gateway model T Com Speedport W 500V. </s>
<s> (I live in Germany) Last month I received a call on my wireless telephone while I was connected to the Internet. </s>
<s> I lost the wireless connection and has not been able to reconnect to the web wireless. </s>
<s> Some folks has told me that because my wireless telephone is from the US the signal frequency might have disrupted the gateway settings. </s>
<s> Any suggestions?? </s>
<s> Thank you!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Go to some hotspot and retest. </s>
<s> Next stop? </s>
<s> Repair center. </s>

<s> I take my computer anywhere else and it connects with no problems. </s>
<s> Even If I bring home a computer from another person it connects to my wireless. </s>
<s> Is just in the apartment, that specific computer will not connects. </s>
<s> If the signal is good then you are repeating my experience with a brand new Dlink router. </s>
<s> My laptops would have nothing to do with it. </s>
<s> I'm sure some would but not mine. </s>
<s> I was nonplused since it was new and what a waste of time to exchange it. </s>
<s> I looked into this issue with google and people noted updating the firmware (what? </s>
<s> mine's new!) </s>
<s> and sure enough the router's firmware was not the latest. </s>
<s> The router was updated and the laptops rebooted and it all connected and worked. </s>
<s> This is good news for me since I love experiencing and fixing problems that people write about firsthand. </s>

<s> One day my wireless was working and then it quit. </s>
<s> Then the next day I lost the entire network. </s>
<s> I couldn't even open the connect to menu. </s>
<s> I have a gateway t-1628 and on the internet connections where it has the icons for the broadband and dial up networks the wireless is no where to be found. </s>
<s> I thought if I tried reinstalling windows vista home edition everything would go back to normal but it didn't. </s>
<s> I don't know what to do. </s>
<s> I read another guys message saying he had a similar problem where he lost his wireless network and someone said to call the laptops company and tell them about it. </s>
<s> I'm tempted to do that but I just wanna know if there's a way past this before trying to call somebody. </s>
