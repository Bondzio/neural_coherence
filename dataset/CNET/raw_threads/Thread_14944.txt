I checked the support and help areas for creating partition, but both methods in window interface and DOS interface are not working after I followed the instruction. Where can I get references for this task?

If it's almost 200GB, then there is no place to make any additional partitions. Use a Partition Resizer to reduce the size of this 'C' and then you can make additional partitions in the freed space. Much more info has been posted in many other postings in this site!! Hope this helps.

The C drive is 183G in total, while there is another 6G reserved for recovery task. My major concern is that once if I try to make new partition, I might accidentally format the entire C drive and lose everything, including the operating system. Please advise where can I get the partition resizer as mentioned? Thank you again.
