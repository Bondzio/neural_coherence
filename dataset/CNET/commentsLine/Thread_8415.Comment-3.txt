yes, windows messenger was running so i turned it off in gpedit.msc.
i am also using norton anti-virus so i turned off the auto updates feature there and will just do it manually.
i keep reading that a persons computer can be used as a zombie computer so that is why i was concerned.
i had never seen this before.
thanks again and i will keep an eye on it for the next couple days.
