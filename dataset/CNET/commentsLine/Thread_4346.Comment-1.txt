well, it was bound to happen sometime... about 5 months ago, my dvd-rom was incapable of reading dvds for a short period of time, just as i was trying to show something to someone, but it was apparently just 1 dvd that it had a problem with, and no others.
however, now, first, it couldn't read dvd+rs (which it formerly could), then it could no longer read anything... cds or dvds.
and thats where i am stuck now.
my drive is a mt1316b bdv212b (or so the drivers say) however i know its a 8x, or it was when i bought it many many years ago (bdv tells me it should be a 12x.... go figure).
anyways, what i mainly wonder is that my friend has a cd/dvd drive cleaner, and it would be great if i could test it out, however my drive is currently incapable of even detecting whether the disk in the drive is a dvd or a cd, and wont allow me to run the program to have it access track 3, where the brushes on the cd are... question 1: is there a program i could use to make the drive spin up and move the lazer around to possibly clean it?
question 2: is thereany other suggestions someone might have for possible fixes?
or any possible answers as to why this happened?
i've always used the drive lightly...
