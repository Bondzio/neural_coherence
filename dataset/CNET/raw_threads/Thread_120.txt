Harmon Kardon, Altec, NEC, to name a few of them. I have an older pair of NEC desktop speakers that I've used for the past 4 or 5 years. When playing music, none of the others, that I have experienced, seem to sound as good. They are approximately twice as large as most newer models. I suspect that may have something to do with it.
