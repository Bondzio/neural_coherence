<s> my barton 3000+ with 1gb ram will not play mp4 or mkv videos without lag getting out of sync. </s>
<s> (my ipad2 with play them seemlessly!) </s>
<s> that is really the reason i want to upgrade. </s>
<s> is a Athlon II x2 with 2 or 3gb ram going to cover my needs? </s>
<s> what else might I want to do that this level of PC won't handle? </s>
<s> a lenovo with the Athlon II x2 (only a 180w power supply??) </s>
<s> mini tower is only $350- from newegg it has onboard ati radeon 3000 graphics as well. </s>
<s> really need help! </s>
<s> thanks... </s>
<s> Any of the latest offering are going to fit the bill. </s>
<s> They are leaps and bounds better than your current system. </s>
<s> But, since you seem to be budgeted, be sure you have room to grow on. </s>
<s> That means that any additional needs like more ram and/or drives, or pgms. </s>
<s> demands, etc. </s>
<s> will be meant by the PSU. </s>
<s> Those systems sold by OEM's tend to fit only what was sold as, they fail under added stress to the PSU. </s>
<s> But, often work quite well with some TLC during use as is. </s>
<s> Continue to check several vendors as well as hi-end systems just to see what differences are present if anything else. </s>
<s> Remember, cheap is cheap. </s>

<s> i havent bought a machine for 5years so i really appreciate any advice! </s>
<s> anyone have specific experience with the Athlon II x2? </s>
<s> or the Ati 3000 onboard video? </s>
<s> I really like this machine but don't want to find out it cant display my .mkv or .mp4 videos smoothly. </s>
<s> also is there something else out there that I might be overlooking? </s>
<s> some things that I don't know anything about would be: HD, blue ray, USB 3.0, new PCI standards...&lt;div&gt; thanks again! </s>

<s> a modest video card ? </s>
<s> How much free disk space do you have ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> my video card is a nvidia gforce 6200 AGP with 256mb my primary hard disk has 10-15gb free </s>
<s> you have but adding 1GB or 2GB of RAM might really help. </s>
<s> That along with enough free disk space is really important for efficient PC operation. </s>
<s> What's the total disk capacity ? </s>
<s> 10-15 GB free space probably isn't enough either Might check over at Crucial.com to see what additional RAM might cost. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Sorry for late reply. </s>
<s> Too much has changed since your last PC purchase. </s>
<s> IMO, there will be no swapping over of anything worthwhile, because nothing would be compilable. </s>
<s> Maybe, the HD could be re-used but just about everthig eklelse is dead on an newer system because there is NO AGP, ram is DDR3(very common) and faster is better as that's the common install, it just is. </s>
<s> The HDs are far larger and is SATA not IDE as was in the olden days. </s>
<s> That's why I mentioned, newer would fit the bill for what you seem to want to do. </s>
<s> I wouldn't hesitate in stepping-up from basic or entry level offering though but get a better PC with a little more $. </s>
<s> I do suggest to check the requirements of any s/w(pgms) demands be meant by the new PC or h/w. </s>
<s> I think you'll find it will do, excluding some extremes. </s>
<s> Be warned, basic &quot;on-board&quot; video is just basic but even that is better than what was available 5yrs. </s>
<s> ago. </s>
<s> If you need better, the PCI-Ex16 is the way to go. </s>
<s> Next, the HD is likely to be SATA, 500gb is a real sweet spot but 1Tb isn't uncommon. </s>
<s> The better RAM to have is DDR3, and in use by Win 7 based OS, likely needs 4gb and having more is good, but 4gb will do fine as a starter. </s>
<s> As for the cpu, the AMD II class of multi-core of 2 cores will do fine but more is better. </s>
