You guys won't believe this but just today I put a DVD into the drive and it WORKED!!!
I fell of my seat almost literally.
I think I have solved the problem of why it did not work when I first mentioned this on Monday.
The drive has drive belts inside that spin the disk.
I am not sure what the belts are made of but they seem to be a bit greasy to the touch and sometimes the drive won't spin properly when the disk is inside it.. DVD disks spin at a higher speed then normal CD or CD Rom and I suspect that all this fuss might be due to the crap quality of the drive belts and this &quot;greasy&quot; substance that builds up on them......
