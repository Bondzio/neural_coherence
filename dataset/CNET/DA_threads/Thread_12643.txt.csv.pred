1.2.1	The board would have a warranty .	St
1.2.2	Use it .	St
1.2.3	I 've made the assumption you know how to use what OS and software to enable that input , what applications would use the input and that the BIOS has the onboard sound enabled .	St
1.2.4	You should n't fret too much over it since it 's a warranty issue .	St
1.2.5	If you do n't take them to task over the warranty for your own reasons , then consider a sound card like http : //www.compgeeks.com/details.asp ? invtid=L-8738-6C is 9.95 .	St
1.2.6	There 's even cheaper cards , but avoid the Aureal cards since the company is defunct and no drivers will ever appear .	St
