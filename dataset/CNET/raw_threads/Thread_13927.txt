Basically, could I just cut off the ends of a few of them and rewire them into the middle of one of them to make it much longer without having to go buy a bunch of double sided female connecters?

When you splice them make sure the twists are close together at the splice. The &quot;technical&quot; reason is called &quot;self induction&quot;. Keep the twists tight.
