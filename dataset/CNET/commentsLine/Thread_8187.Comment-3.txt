issue with booting from bios the computer does not seem to want to do this.
when the computer is booting up i press f10 to go to bios menu and select boot from disc.
it then proceeds to open files on the disc and eventually shows an error and asks that the computer be rebooted.
has anyone else had issues with dual booting this specific pc or other gateways?
