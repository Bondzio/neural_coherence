Right now it is connected like this: http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i162/hawkeye_042/router1.jpg . To make it less confusing I would like to configure the second router as an access point and have everything else directly to the modem/router like this: http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i162/hawkeye_042/router2.jpg . I plugged my computer to the modem/router and it won't recieve the correct ip address info. I know what the router IP is and the DHCP is turned on. When we plugged in the second router we set the connection to &quot;dynamic&quot; and it got the IP information just fine. When I plug my computer in it only recieves an IP and Subnet Mask which are both incorrect. For an ip it lists 169.254.25.224 and subnet mask is 255.255.255.0. It should have been 192.168.50.101 and 255.255.255.0. It also says computer has limited or no connectivity. -Appreciate any help!

I'm presuming you want the modem/router to be the IP address server. As such, your laptops need to get through the AP with their request for an address. It would seem to me that your AP...which you said is actually a router configured as one...should have the IP address server feature turned off. My first thought is, because you have just a few devices to deal with, assign static address across the board and plug in your modem/router address as the gateway on all connected devices. If any device you have needs DHCP, you should be able to define a range of address it can give out and keep the rest as static. Personally, I've always had better luck using static addressing.
