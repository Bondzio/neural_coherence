&quot;Garmin (including USB models), Magellan, Lowrance, Silva/Brunton MultiNavigator, and any other with NMEA v2 or greater output &quot; I've found nice looking Bluetooth WAAS NMEA GPS units for under 99 bucks.
Add another 20 for the USB Bluetooth dongle and you're done.
Just check the GPS for NMEA v2 .
I'll let you research why I think WAAS is needed.
