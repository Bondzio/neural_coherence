Thanks for the info.
No, I don't have HD capability, and the cable box has only RF and a single RCA video connector (composite?).
There is also an RS-232 connector.
I will see if they offer a cable box with a DVI connector.
I doubt that the composite is useable with no scan included.
I have a computer monitor, not TV monitor.
