Especially for gaming, an Athlon 64 3000+ would be a much better choice than a P4 520.
In Doom 3 for example, an Athlon 64 3000+( $133 for the socket 754, or $150 for the socket 939 ) beats a $780 Pentium 4 3.2 ghz EE.

http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx?i=2065&p=8 The socket 754 Athlon 64 3000+ is cheaper than the 939 version, and the 754 motherboard is also cheaper, but the 939 motherboard will give more room for future upgrades, and a 90nm socket 939 will probably use less power and run cooler than a 130 nm socket 754 one.
It doesn't make sense to even consider a 2.8 ghz (520) Pentium 4 at $162, when for less you can get an Athlon 64 3000+ which beats a Pentium 4 3 ghz (or even a much faster P4) in most games.
