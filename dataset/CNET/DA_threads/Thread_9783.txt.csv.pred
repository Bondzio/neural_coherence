1.1.1	Here are some symptoms that may or may not be a precursor to my big problem : Several days ago , while scanning some slides on my flatbed , I went to the & quot ; Start & quot ; button to look through my list of programs .	St
1.1.2	Instead of being able to run my mouse over the list or scroll through it with the keyboard , the highlighted area took off like a rocket , scrolling and scrolling over and over at top speed through the list .	St
1.1.3	I managed to click out of it , and then any time I would click on anything that opened up to a list ( File , Favorites , etc ... ) the cursor would fly through it like before .	St
1.1.4	I restarted the computer , thinking maybe it needed a defrag and a virus check .	St
1.1.5	I did those .	St
1.1.6	After that episode , whenever I start up the computer and it comes to the screen where you have the option of booting Windows XP or the Recovery Drive , it stalls there because , again , the cursor is bouncing back and forth between the two .	St
1.1.7	A tap of the arrow keys stops it and I can make my selection .	St
1.1.8	NOW , this morning , the same thing happened , I managed to click through it and get to my login screen , and Windows keeps telling me my password is incorrect .	St
1.1.9	The & quot ; hint & quot ; is unchanged ... Is this simply a keyboard problem ?	Ques
1.1.10	Are my arrow keys running amok ?	Ques
1.1.11	Or is Windows about to explode ?	Ques
1.2.1	As a bum keyboard can kill the logon , I 'd try that .	St
1.3.1	It all happened right before I had to leave for work ( where I am posting this right now ) .	St
1.3.2	I do plan on swiping a keyboard temporarily to test it out .	St
1.3.3	But otherwise ...	St
1.3.4	I may be right in assuming it 's the keyboard ?	Ques
1.3.5	Sure beats re-installing Windows or some other drastic measure ...	St
1.4.1	My thoughts ?	Ques
1.4.2	The keyboard or it 's interface looks defective .	St
1.5.1	Thanks for your responses .	St
1.5.2	I 've already rounded up a keyboard to try out this evening .	St
1.5.3	Maybe I 'll disassemble the one I already have and see if there 's some obvious physical reason for the problem as well .	St
1.5.4	I 'll post again tomorrow and let you know what happened ...	St
