<s> I have Windows XP OS and am using a Belkin Media Card Reader that won't read or transfer above 512MB. </s>
<s> Does anyone know of a Media Card Reader that will read a Secure Digital (SD) 2GB? </s>
<s> I own this one -&gt; http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=5IN1-CARDREADER&cat=RDM and have used a variety of cards in it from 128MB, 512MB, 2GB and 4GB. </s>
<s> Thanks, I'll check it out. </s>
