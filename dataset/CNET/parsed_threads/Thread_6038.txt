<s> hello my pc keeps rebooting and won't let me do anything goes to the windows xp icon and reboots. </s>
<s> i have tried to do startup in safe mode and that don't work. </s>
<s> any suggestions the pc is a v2 premier os is xp 512 ram </s>
<s> try calling the manufacturer </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> The company I work for bought two V2 Premier computers and so far we've replaced 3 motherboards, two power supplies and two hard drives...the techs who came to repair them said they are constantly working on these computers. </s>
<s> Basically we're replaced everything in both computers in less than a year and they still reboot and have numerous stop errors...You have to keep calling them before your warantee expires or you will be stuck with a piece of junk...sorry. </s>
<s> If you have an xp cd boot from it or if you have a restore cd use it. </s>
<s> Bios should be set to cd as first boot device. </s>
<s> good luck </s>
<s> my old ibm used to and still does reboot/restart atleast 4 or 5 times when i use it. </s>
<s> i finally got a new computer and its so much better. </s>
<s> i didnt know what was wrong with the other one. </s>
<s> maybe it had alot f viruses on it or spyware even though virus checker says there are no viruses. </s>
<s> i dont know but it freezes up alot and i do mean alot when i use ot. </s>
<s> i end up having to unplug it and plug it back in. </s>
<s> i searched for a remedy on windows website. </s>
<s> it said something about shutting down protects it from something harmful. </s>
<s> no real solutions here, just letting you know that i have the same problem with my ibm </s>
<s> I have a V2 Premier and I had the same problem. </s>
<s> The problem was using a USB connection to the cable modem instead of network cable. </s>
<s> I used a Belkin network cable between the CPU and the cable modem and the problem was instantly solved. </s>
<s> I was rather mad that only 1 tech out of 5 had the answer to the problem. </s>
<s> ShopNBC uses their ''layers of support'' as a selling point, but the support is pretty bad. </s>
<s> After upgrading the IGP (yuck) video to a GeoForce FX 5500, and replacing the 512 mb of PC2700 RAM with 1 gig of PC3200 RAM, the computer is running very, very well. </s>
<s> I just looked at a friends V2-Premier because the fan on the power supply wasn't working. </s>
<s> What I found was a &quot;250W&quot; power supply for a P4 2.8 processor CDRW,DVD,Card Reader, etc. </s>
<s> The box also had problems powering up.... Had to push the on button serveral times and cross fingers to get it to turn on. </s>
<s> When I replaced the power supply fan that apparently put it over the top! </s>
<s> Once powered on it would make it to the XP Logo Screen and then power itself back off. </s>
<s> I replaced the power supply with a larger 500w (don't need one that big but I had one on the shelf) and both the booting and power switch problems disappeared. </s>
<s> Looks to me like a box sold with bells and whistles but skimpy/cheap components inside. </s>
<s> Reminded me of an eMachine I worked on once..... </s>
<s> Take bobt1956's advice and change that power supply. </s>
<s> The guy before that said two of the machines at his work are crap was right, but only because the power supplies, or non supplies as the case is, are the most unstable pieces of junk you could plug into a board. </s>
<s> The reason those computers are plagued with problems is because they're underpowered, and what power the unit is suppling is so dirty the board doesn't know if it should boot or just crumple into a smoldering heap. </s>
<s> Components are extremely susceptable to damage from fluxuations in the voltage rails from a bad PSU. </s>
<s> SWAP IT. </s>
<s> IT's not difficult if you want to do it yourself, just mark the connectors of the old one as to where they cam out of on the board, match them with the connectors on the new unit and plug them in. </s>
<s> With PSU connectors, if it fits there, that's where it goes. </s>
