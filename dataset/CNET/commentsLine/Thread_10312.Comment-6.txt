richard, thanks for the great information.i hope you're still out there and reading this!
i've worked as a media producer for close to 20 years (mostly multi media work such as events, web work, dvd:s, exhibitions, magazines etc, was doing a lot of 3d stuff initially, strongly prefer macs but am not a zealot) but have in recent years drifted more into a producer, concept development and strategy role.
i've long wanted to make documentaries in hd (1080p) format, and do as much as possible of the work myself, especially the editing/post.
it seems difficult to find reliable information on the actual hardware requirements for capturing and editing 1080p video.
that's a lot of data to be shuffled... from what i can gather, you actually need gigabit ethernet drives to smooth the work process.
since the post i'm replying to is from 2008, in what respect would you update your recommendations for fall 2010?
i'd be very grateful for your thoughts on this!
