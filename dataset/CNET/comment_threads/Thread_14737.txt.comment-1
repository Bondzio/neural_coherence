I am having trouble when trying to adjust color settings from 16 to High color 16.
Display properties box reporting that there's a IRQ conflict that prevents me from changing color settings.
Any suggestions?
Thanks in advance.
P.S.
When I tried to run Hardware Troubleshooter, a blank window appeared.
