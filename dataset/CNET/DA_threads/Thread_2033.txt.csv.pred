1.1.1	Not sure I am in the rigth forum.	St
1.1.2	I am looking for an inexpensive monitor for work.	St
1.1.3	I definitely want a 5:4 aspect ratio, not a wide screen.	St
1.1.4	I am looking at three Hanns G comparable 19 inch models.	St
1.1.5	The differences seem so minor that I can't make out what is significant.	St
1.1.6	Models are JC199APD, HH191DPB, and HX191DPB.	St
1.2.1	http://www.google.com/search?q=JC199APD found your post and nothing else.	St
1.2.2	Is there a link to this available?	St
1.3.1	Sorry that I did not provide more info.	St
1.3.2	I am new at this.	St
1.3.3	The page is in the CNet review site.	St
1.3.4	I tried to add the link here, but o luck.	St
1.3.5	I just copied it.	St
1.3.6	http://reviews.cnet.com/lcd-monitors/?filter=1000036_13686276_100021_10061970_500166_5101600_&tag=mnco	St
1.4.1	I'll tell why in a moment.	Sug
1.4.2	The HannsG HH-191DPB contrast ratio pulls it ahead of the others.	St
1.4.3	DHCP helps too.	St
1.4.4	For me this model is a NO SALE since these are not the current technology of WIDE SCREEN.	St
1.4.5	Because of my work I must get the new displays that you see today or my software efforts would be hampered by using the older displays.	St
1.4.6	I'm sure you have a reason for this choice.	St

1.5.1	I am probably a little naive about this, but my reason for preferring a 5:4 aspect ratio to a wide screen is being able to see two documents at once one above the other, and see more of one document at a time.	St
1.5.2	Graphics capabilities is not my primary concern.	St
1.5.3	I realize everything has moved to wide screen format.	St
1.5.4	perharps there are some disadvantages that I don't understand.	St
1.5.5	I welcome your thoughts on this.	Polite
1.6.1	I picked up the swivel model as you see at http://s175.photobucket.com/albums/w146/rproffitt2000/?action=view&current=desktop2.jpg If I didn't swivel that then maybe 2 docs side by side?	St
1.6.2	All personal choice there.	St
