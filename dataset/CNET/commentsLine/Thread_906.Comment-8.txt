yes i know there are other solutions, it is just that i have the opportunity of getting one of these units for free, so i just wanted to see if i could use it on my home network, which includes both pcs and a mac.
i am not happy with my current netgear solution, because like i said, it is not accessible from the mac, and because i could not retrieve the data should the sc101 fail (not the drives within it, but the actual sc101 itself) once again, thank for you your response.
