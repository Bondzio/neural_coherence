<s> Hi, I was wondering if there was any way for me to check which computers in the past my external hard drive has been connected to. </s>
<s> I want to check if anyone has been using/going through my hard drive. </s>
<s> What happened is my external hard drive fell and broke. </s>
<s> I was wondering if I could check -my- computer for any data/file that would tell where the hard drive connected in the past had also been connected to. </s>
<s> ie. </s>
<s> would their computers have left some sort of &quot;stamp&quot; or something on the hard drive that would have been left over on my computer after I last connected the hard drive to mine? </s>
<s> I'm running Lion and the other people would probably have been on Snow Leopard. </s>
<s> But the problem is the hard drive with the files broke and is now gone...so if someone used my hard drive, and then I plugged it into my laptop before it broke, would there be any information on my laptop that would tell where else that past connected drive had been? </s>
<s> Please if anyone could help it would be much appreciated </s>
<s> While I do know about some Windows event viewer even that does not apply and would not hold the details you are looking for. </s>
<s> At this point this answer looks to be no. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> i haven't heard something about that. </s>
