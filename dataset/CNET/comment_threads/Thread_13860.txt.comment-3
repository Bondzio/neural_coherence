If the HDCP can't be verified (sorry, I hope you will google what new terms are as I won't duplicate that here) then the display should fall back to SDTV resolution or &quot;480p.&quot; The fix is to connect with VGA and forget HDMI.
You could get a video card with HDMI output that is certified to output HDCP compliante HDMI but my bet is that would run a bit more cash and involve the Vista OS.
