interesting post, fitz, as a printer engineer (mostly...) my company insists that if the user is using refills/3rd party consumables we should walk away!
i had hp refills a few years ago for my deskjet 690c and they were terrible - ink bled, smudged, took a long time to dry, etc.
recently i needed to print some stuff but was skint, so i went to a local cartridge world-type place.
the result really impressed me, and i would recommend the shop.
however, where laser toner cartridges are concerned, the story is not so good.
i have seen leaks of toner, poor quality due to the drum having marks on it, or repeated lines caused by problems within the cartridges.
they don't seem to last very long, either, so maybe toners are in a different league from ink cartridges:-)
