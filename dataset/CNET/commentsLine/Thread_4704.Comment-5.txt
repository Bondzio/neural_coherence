i highly recommend an external hard drive.
i have an internal hard drive that is hooked up to an external case and i love it.
it's 160 g and twice a month i just plug in the usb cable and back up every thing.
i keep two copies and over write the earlier one each time so i always have the two latest back ups.
great deals on ebay...
