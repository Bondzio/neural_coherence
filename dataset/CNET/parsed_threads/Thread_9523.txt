<s> Hi, I'm having a issue with NAT settings and was hoping you guys could help. </s>
<s> I have a Linksys E3000 wireless N router. </s>
<s> I have two Xboxes connected to the router, one wired, and one wireless. </s>
<s> I'm trying to get both of the Xboxes to have an open NAT, but I haven't had any luck. </s>
<s> I spoke with a Cisco tech, and they had me do &quot;Port Range Triggering&quot; for 80 and 3074, change MTU to 1364, uncheck &quot;Filter Anonymous Requests&quot;, and disable &quot;Upnp&quot;. </s>
<s> The best it would ever do is make the wired Xbox OPEN, and the wireless one Moderate. </s>
<s> But it seemed intermittent, and sometimes the wireless Xbox would change to STRICT. </s>
<s> Could you guys maybe give me a hand? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Cnet's review wrote &quot;The included desktop application can't be used together with the router's Web interface, and neither provides the complete control over the router's features and functions.&quot; Between that and the failed support I'd return this for a router that is knows to work with Xbox Live. </s>

<s> Which router would you recommend for 2 Xboxes (wired and wireless), a PS3, a Wii, and multiple other devices (iPhones, Laptops). </s>
<s> I'd like to stick with an N router, and my primary use for it is gaming. </s>
<s> Dual band is also nice. </s>
<s> I like the idea of using the 5GHz frequency. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I meant &quot;known.&quot; </s>
<s> We know that much so even I would not offer anything here. </s>
<s> While our home uses the simple Netgear http://reviews.cnet.com/routers/netgear-wireless-n-router/4505-3319_7-33090709.html?tag=lia;rcol it may not work for those that are fascinated by dual band or other than basic router use. </s>
<s> There are some that claim it drops but it never has here. </s>
<s> However you may guess it's set up exactly as noted in this forum's sticky. </s>
<s> I eat my own dog food in other words. </s>
<s> Sadly the model you noted failed not once but twice so if the maker is having you play with MTU and more, it is not ready for the field. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yes the multiple Xbox issue is simple,, udate you frimware to newest version. </s>
<s> and dissbale the SPI Firewall,, The SPI firewall is essentially a NAT firewall. </s>
<s> Linksys E3000 </s>
