i have not had any success getting a constant signal with my wireless router in our 3-storey house and am considering lynksys' powerline products, namely the ple200.
this allows me to run my broadband connection through the house wiring.
lynksys is just re-releasing this product, in an upgraded version, and i'm wondering if anyone out there has has any good or bad experiences with this type of networking.
