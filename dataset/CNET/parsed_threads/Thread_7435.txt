<s> I have been burning movies for the past few months without complications. </s>
<s> However, up until recently, using the same method I have always used, the DVD's no longer work. </s>
<s> The program goes through the process of converting and burning, but the DVD can't be read by the computer or DVD player. </s>
<s> I just recently had a virus, adware.look2me, which is removed now. </s>
<s> Could that have had something to do with it? </s>
<s> Ive tried re-installing the DVD-rom drivers and my converting/burning program but no luck. </s>
<s> Here's what I am using. </s>
<s> Comstar 16X Double Layer Internal DVD+/-R Rewriter WinAVI video converter Someone, please help Thanks </s>
<s> A little more work and difficulty but did you remove and reinstall the codecs? </s>
<s> Also some run into aging drives or bum media. </s>
<s> I often try a burn at 2x on media other than what is failing. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> All the codecs are new and I've tried slowing down the speed but no dice. </s>
<s> Mine all of a sudden stopped as well. </s>
<s> ugh. </s>
<s> Any fix? </s>
