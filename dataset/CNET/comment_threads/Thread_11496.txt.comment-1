Ive been confused for a while.
I want to upgrade my house with wireless.
Looking at reviews from CNet both Belkin Pre N and the Netgear RangMax WPN824 both have excellent ratings.
My computers have regular g cards in them, and my laptop (Dell Inspiron 700m) has a built in Intel Pro 2200 b/g card in it.
It is the main focus for connection since its what i use most.
The reason i want to go with such great range routers is that on some days of the week i need connection in an area that is 150-200 feet away.
Any help or advice would be appreciated!
Thanks, Chandan
