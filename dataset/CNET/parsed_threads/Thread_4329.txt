<s> It's for a new desktop, and the phone line with DSL coming out of it is pretty far around the house, lots of walls in the middle. </s>
<s> If I was going to run a cable, I'd need 200+ ft of cable (I think, very rough estimate). </s>
<s> I know that the general creed is that a hardwire is always stronger than wifi, but at that kind of distance, would the latency in transferring signal over that much wiring justify wifi to just save the time? </s>
<s> I'd get pretty good reception, I already have wifi running for an Xbox360 in that room. </s>
<s> ...but a homeplug (mains borne networking adapters)solution is a strong contender for your proposed setup. </s>
<s> Hardwired wins out over wireless where latency is concerned even with great reception, especially for the XBox360. </s>
<s> Max distance for cat 5 cable is 100m, so you still have 100ft or so to play with on top of the 200ft you are planning. </s>
<s> If you aren't concerned with latency, than wireless is by far the easier solution. </s>
