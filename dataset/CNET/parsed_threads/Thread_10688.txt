<s> I heard that upgrading wireless router from B to G does not really improve internet speed for your wireless. </s>
<s> How about upgrading cat5 cables to cat6? </s>
<s> Adding extra lanes to the highway, without increasing the speed limit does not make the cars go any faster. </s>
<s> Perhaps a poor analogy but non the less true. </s>
<s> In the case of the router, your wireless cards would need to upgraded to G in order to get those 54mbs speeds from the router. </s>
<s> However if your internet is chugging along at 1.5mbs, going from B(11mbs) to G(54mbs) shows no increase. </s>
<s> The only positive is in LAN transfers, files will move faster. </s>
<s> Basically the same logic for CAT5 to CAT6. </s>
