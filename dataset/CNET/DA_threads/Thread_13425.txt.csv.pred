1.1.3	If I remove the hard drive , can I take it somewhere to retrieve the pictures ?	Ques
1.1.4	I just purchased a & quot ; My Book & quot ; external Hard Drive and did not get to use it because of my OS X problem .	St
1.1.5	I have an E-machine with windows XP , and a HP with windows 2000 , but they wo n't be of any help ?	Ques
1.1.6	I also tried everything suggested in & quot ; the Missing Manual & quot ; .	St
1.1.7	I had this problem before and Apple had us erase all of our stuff .	St
1.1.8	It was okay then because I did not have my pictures and videos .	St
1.1.9	I also have a lot of music I would like to keep .	St
1.1.10	The pictures are the most important .	St
1.1.11	No backup of any kind was done because we had just recently added the pictures and videos .	St
1.1.12	Thanks , Sue PS : I still consider myself a computer newbie especially with the Mac .	St
1.2.1	http : //docs.info.apple.com/article.html ? artnum=107120 Machines do n't last forever but 3 years is a little short unless it 's one of those used daily machines .	St
1.2.2	I find our work laptops start to have severe issues after year 2 .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	The first thing to find out is whether or not the iMac will start up from the Restore CD/DVD You were not very specific about what happens when you attempt to start the iMac .	St
1.3.2	Does it chime ?	Ques
1.3.3	Does the screen light up ?	Ques
1.3.4	Do you see the Grey Apple and spinning spokes ?	Ques
1.3.5	A folder icon with a question mark ?	Ques
1.3.6	Does any happen at all ?	Ques
1.3.7	If the iMac starts from the Recovery CD/DVD , it is a good indication that most of the internal stuff is working as designed .	St
1.3.8	The next thing is to find out if the Hard Drive is still functioning .	St
1.3.9	If it is , then you have a good chance of recovering all your data .	St
1.3.10	If it is not , then I 'm afraid your data will only be recoverable using a professional data recovery service .	St
1.3.11	If the iMac booted from the CD/DVD , use the Disk Utility from the Menu Bar and see if it recognizes the Hard Drive .	St
1.3.12	If it does , run First Aid on it to see if it is damaged in any way .	St
1.3.13	If it appears OK , quit Disk Utility .	St
1.3.14	Start the install process BUT choose ARCHIVE and INSTALL as the installation method .	St
1.3.15	Choose ONLY the Archive and Install option .	St
1.3.16	You will find it under Options at the first or second screen of the installer .	St
1.3.17	This will lay down a new System folder , but will preserve all your data .	St
1.3.18	Once the recovery is complete , and the machine restarts , all your data will be where you left it .	St
1.3.19	Now make the backup of all your data !	St
1.3.20	I will not beat the drum about regular backups , I guess you have already become a convert to that regime .	St
1.3.21	Daily backups are not too often .	St
1.3.22	All the above relies on the HD being functional .	St
1.3.23	Pass on more information and we 'll go from there Good Luck P	St
1.4.1	The comp .	St
1.4.2	only shows the flashing ?	Ques
1.4.3	and does nothing else .	St
1.4.4	However , when the disc install .	St
1.4.5	is in , the computer chimes , the apple and spinning wheel are there and it goes to the install screen .	St
1.4.6	This is the only way I can do anything .	St
1.4.7	I went to disc utility , did the first aid and it says disc is OK .	St
1.4.8	I even tried to use the archive and install option , but the computer froze .	St
1.4.9	When I tried it again , the archive option was no longer available , only install for first time or erase and install .	St
1.4.10	When in disc utility , I went to the & quot ; restore & quot ; option ... Once in there I went to screen and was able to find my photos , but was unable to click on any of them .	St
1.4.11	They were not in bold print , but they are still there .	St
1.4.12	How can I get them ?	Ques
1.5.1	That Hard Drive does not sound healthy .	St
1.5.2	If the A & I option was there first , but has since disappeared , it is a reasonable sign that the drive is defective .	St
1.5.3	The flashing question mark means that the system can not find a viable system folder from which to boot the machine .	St
1.5.4	The & quot ; Restore & quot ; function in Disk Utility does not do what it sounds like it would do .	St
1.5.5	It is for restoring a disk from a disk image , which you do not have , and will do nothing for you .	St
1.5.6	You would be well advised to leave the disk alone and contact a data recovery service .	St
1.5.7	They are not cheap .	St
1.5.8	Only you can make the determination as to whether your data is worth the price that they charge .	St
1.5.9	Google for & quot ; Data Recovery & quot ; and you will find lots of hits .	St
1.5.10	You do n't have to specify Mac or Windows , they do any platform .	St
1.5.11	Sorry to be the bearer of bad news , but when a drive appears and disappears , it is not a good sign .	St
1.5.12	P	St
