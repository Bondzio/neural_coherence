So i had set up the graphics card right and disabled the integrated one. Then i went to their website to install a more recent driver which they said came out April 15, 2005. Then after installing they asked me to restart and i did but after it started the screen was just black. I could not see anything so to make it work i had to take out the nvidia card and i uninstalled the drivers. now if i plug the card back in will i have to update the drivers? Couldn't i just stay with the ones that came on the CD?

I guess Windows automatically downloaded the drives but what is weird is that i did not see anything saying it was installing it. I guess the pc came with the drivers installed
