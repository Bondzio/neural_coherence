15330	1	62647	743242	743224	Willy	2/5/05 3:03 PM	1.10761578E12	Check list	Let me understand this, you ahve 32mb of ram and a 256Mhz cpu? Xp, shouldn't be able to run on that. As for your problem, excluding what I just mentioned, look into a weak power supply, heat problem, or bad capacitors. The p/s unit should be 350W or better and if old, maybe time to replace. heat problem, make sure all the fan(s) are working and clean the dust out, plus inspect operation. last, bad caps are a known problem as they age and pasy poor manufacture, look for bulging, leaking or burst caps. Please verify the above. enjoy ------Willy
