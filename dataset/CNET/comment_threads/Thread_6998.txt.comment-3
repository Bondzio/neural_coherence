And if there isn't a 3.5&quot; drive bay available for a second HDD, see if you have a 5.25&quot; drive bay available.
You could put the 3.5&quot; hard drive in a 5.25&quot; bay (mounting kit required).
Much much better in my opinion to mount a second drive internally for backup and extra disk space....just read the messages about externals in the STORAGE forum.
