1.8.1	Your post implies that you haven't used this device on this particular machine before.	St
1.8.2	I looked up you specs, but they don't specify usb 2.0 or 1.1.	St
1.8.3	You can look here: Start/Control Panel/System/hardware tab/Device Manager.	St
1.8.4	Click the plus sign beside the universal serial bus conrollers.	St
1.8.5	Look for any description that says usb2.	St
1.8.6	If not listed there, your system may support usb 1.1 only.	St
1.9.1	all it says is... ALi pci to usb open host controller and usb root hub	St
1.10.1	i found this 2 USB, 1 Parallel IEEE 1284 (EPP/ECP), 1 Serial RS-232, 1 Keyboard / mouse Generic, 1 Headphones Output, 1 Microphone Input, 1 Display / video VGA, 1 Display / video S-video output, 1 Modem Phone line, 1 Network Ethernet 10Base-T/100Base-TX does this mean yes or no?	St
1.10.2	and would i get the correct drivers if i did the factory instal?	St
1.11.1	It appears that your hardware is usb 1.1.	St
1.11.2	If it were usb 2.0, Windows xp will install it's own drivers for that.	St
1.11.3	If you have an open pci slot, you may be able to buy a usb 2.0 pci card to upgrade to 2.0.	St
1.11.4	Otherwise you just have to accept 1.1 speeds.	St
1.11.5	Best of Luck	St
