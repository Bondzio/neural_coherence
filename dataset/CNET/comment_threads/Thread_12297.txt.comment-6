The Mac (OS X) and the PC (NTFS) use different operating systems and devices formatted specifically for one will not function in the other.
FAT 32 is a universal standard which allows external devices like HD's, thumb drives, and memory cards to be used interchangeably to transport data back and forth etc.
So perhaps you have some devices specifically formatted for the Mac, or perhaps some other system.
So you might check your formatting.
