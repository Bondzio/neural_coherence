<s> I have and HP media center photosmart computer and I knew when we bought it that it would have to get a new video card for the types of games my husband and I play. </s>
<s> However, in doing more research I found that I may also need to upgrade the power supply to run the new card. </s>
<s> My questions are, what is the best card for this commputer? </s>
<s> we would only want to run things like Microsoft flight sim X and some of the Myst-Uru type games. </s>
<s> I like ATI Radeon, but there are SO many choices and I don't really know what the differences are. </s>
<s> Also, I don't even know how to find a power supply etc. </s>
<s> That kind of sounds like a dangerous thing to mess with. </s>
<s> Anyway, any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> I would like to get this stuff for my husband for Christmas. </s>
<s> + what's your budget? </s>
<s> + what's your exact model PC (needed to determine what type of card will work)? </s>
<s> + how comfortable are you (or your husband) with replacing the power supply? </s>
<s> (its not difficult but some folks don't like screwdrivers.) </s>
<s> + are you willing to buy from a web shop? </s>
<s> (you'll save 40% or more compared to local stores.) </s>
<s> The exact model is HP Pavillion m7570n My budget?? </s>
<s> Well, I am not really sure what a decent cost would be for something like this. </s>
<s> I want to try to keep it on the lower end if possible. </s>
<s> The video card I installed in my old computer was something I just picked up at Walmart for $100. </s>
<s> I realize this will be a bit more expensive, but I don't want to be getting up to $1000 or anything, we just can't afford that. </s>
<s> I am fine with taking things apart and putting them back together, like I said, I have installed video cards, extra hard drives, etc. </s>
<s> As long as I have instructions I can do just about any of that stuff. </s>
<s> And, I have NO problem buying over the internet. </s>
<s> That is how we do most of our shopping now since Katrina Thanks for replying!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> here are my recommedations for mid-range pci express cards with 256mb ram that will be great upgrades for your m7570n. </s>
<s> higher price = higher performance and the 7900gs for $170 is probably the best bang for the buck. </s>
<s> $110: evga geforce 7600gts http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=322829 $140: evga geforce 7600gt ko http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=322786 $190: evga geforce 7900gs ko ($20 rebate avail) http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=322825 $205: sapphire radeon x1950pro http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=326853 I couldn't find the rating on your power supply so I suggest you check it. </s>
<s> All of the cards above suggest a 400W unit, but the 7600gt and lower could get by with 350W. </s>
<s> Here's a good 430W unit for $40. </s>

<s> My husband swears (because of what some guy at Office Depot told him) that we need a card that is 512 MB instead of 256. </s>
<s> He was told that since 256 was the minimum requirement for his game that it would not run as well with a 256 MB card and would be &quot;jerky&quot;. </s>
<s> Any advice on this? </s>
<s> Also, just for my info, what is the difference between a Radeon 1950 and 1650? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> 512mb is only of use at very high resolutions (1600x1200 or 1680x1050 or higher) since only at those resolutions will the card's memory usage exceed 256mb. </s>
<s> (these are the native resolutions of 20&quot; LCDs). </s>
<s> low-end and mid-range cards can't run games well at those resolutions so 512mb is wasted in these cards. </s>
<s> of the cards i suggested, even the 1950pro probably won't be helped by 512mb. </s>
<s> that's why the vast majority of these cards only have 256mb while $400 cards typically have 512mb standard. </s>
<s> the extra money you would spend for 512mb should be invested in a faster card instead. </s>
<s> here are benchmarks of a midrange x1600pro with 512mb. </s>
<s> notice that its extra ram never helps it run faster than a x1600xt or x1600pro 'turbo' (both of which have 256mb). </s>
<s> http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/354/8 </s>
<s> the basic difference between all x1900 series cards is pipelines. </s>
<s> pipeline specs for the x1900 family are in the table at the end of this page: http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.aspx?i=2858&p=2 the more pipelines a card has the faster it will be (within the same family). </s>
<s> is that flight simulator x needs a very high end computer to not run sluggish. </s>
<s> You have a high end computer, but you'll need that graphics horsepower for that program. </s>

<s> Thanks for all of the info and for turning me on to zipzoomfly, their prices are really great! </s>

<s> Zipzoomfly.....Ugh! </s>
<s> Try Tiger Direct...Much easier on da pocket.. </s>
<s> For a resolution at or above 1280*1024 (most LCD's) you need at least a 7600GT or ATI based X1650XT -- preferably a 7950GT nVIDA based card (BFG card) or ATI X1950 Pro or XT to run any intensive flight sim at respectable frame rates -- you can get away with a 7600GT or X1650XT for lower budgets if you're using a CRT wherer you can scale resolutions anytime you want from 800*600 to 1600*1200 at a 5:4 ratio. </s>
<s> Most LCD's are 1280*1024 or above and need to be run at the native resolution only to avoid scaling issues. </s>
<s> Lower end but doable http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814143049 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814102068 Higher end and better http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814143070 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814131027 Yet a bit higher and much better http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814143071 </s>
