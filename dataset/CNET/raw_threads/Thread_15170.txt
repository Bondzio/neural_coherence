It says local and internet connected but i can't access IE or firefox and AIM says server failure. It does this for both wireless connections and if i directly use an ethernet cable the same thing happens. Well it was working before at my home connection then I went to a starbucks to connect to the Tmobile wifi and then when i came back home the internet couldn't be accessed. I tried ipconfig and this is what shows up Microsoft Windows [Version 6.0.6000] Copyright 2006 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
