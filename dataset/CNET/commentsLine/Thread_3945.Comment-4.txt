&quot;transcend&quot; is the brand name of your ram.
&quot;102&quot; is probably the vendor's internal designation of the motherboard.
i don't recommend buying any p4 now since most will be effectively discontinued at the end of the month when core 2 duo debuts.
the remaining p4ds will drop in price dramatically so you'll be able to afford a faster cpu.
p4d 945 3.4ghz 800mhz 2x2mb $163 (now $316) p4d 915 2.8ghz 800mhz 2x2mb $133 (now $169) p4d 820 2.8ghz 800mhz 2x1mb $113 (now $169) p4d 805 2.66ghz 533mhz 2x1mb $93 (now $115)
