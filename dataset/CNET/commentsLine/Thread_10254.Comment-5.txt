but you get to deal with cables that only have so much length between devices.
you can also velcro a drive down if you wish.
perhaps this is a bit tacky but it's up to the creativity of the user.
he did not mention if every bay was full or how many ide devices were already installed.
this could make a difference in the answer.
personally, i'd fill the bays first.
