i have enabled file sharing on the 98 computer and have both of them in the same workgroup.
xp can see the other computer but can't access any files.
the 98 computer doesn't see any of the network.
both computers are routed thru dlink 624 and are able to access internet at the same time.
where can i find more info on configuring this system?
i looked at several sites but they all pertained to using 2000 and 98 together.
any suggestions?
