<s> Recently the DVD/CDRW drive on my Dell laptop went down. </s>
<s> To save money, I bought an internal DVD burner(Yamakawa DVR 7-08 8X DVD+/-RW (R888-1002 )) and a USB 2.0 Enclosurer. </s>
<s> I thought it should plug and play, but after I put everything together, the laptop(XP) did not recognize it as a DVD writer. </s>
<s> The windows explorer did add a label to the DVD driver as &quot;DVD-R&quot;, but after I insert a blank DVD+R disk, the label changed to &quot;CD drive&quot;. </s>
<s> I then tried the software(EZBurning) came with Dell, the software complained that it can not find any DVD writer divice. </s>
<s> Any help will be appreciated. </s>

<s> &quot; While you missed one item on your post, the make/model of the laptop my bet is the EZBurning software is locked to the make/model of the drive that came with the Dell. </s>
<s> If you just need data DVD recording, try what I use -&gt; http://www.cdburnerxp.se/ In closing, my external wasn't that stable until XP SP2 Bob </s>
<s> Man, you are good. </s>
<s> I download the software you mentioned, it does locate the DVD writer, it even name the label as its brand name. </s>
<s> Thank you very much. </s>
<s> Be sure to check the CDBurnerXP site for updates. </s>
<s> There's one feature missing in that software, but for 99% of the time it's all I need. </s>
