1.1.1	Well , I 've got a rather interesting problem , that so far , has stumped everyone who has worked on it .	St
1.1.2	My computer that I just finished building will only send a completely black signal to my monitor .	St
1.1.3	After talking to one of my friends , we decided that the problem might be in that the monitor was screwed up , and was n't working .	St
1.1.4	So , I hooked it up to the monitor I 'm using now , and nothing .	St
1.1.5	Once I did that , we figured the problem might be in that its just not sending a signal at all .	St
1.1.6	So , using the same method , I hooked it up to another monitor , and it does n't give me the & quot ; no signal & quot ; message .	St
1.1.7	If you 're going to say that its only not giving me that because its plugged into a grounded outlet , you 're wrong , this monitor has a problem in it that does n't have it check from grounding , it only checks for a signal going into it .	St
1.1.8	So , right now , we 're all stumped , I 'm hoping you can help me .	St
1.2.1	Get your hands on a simple video card , pci type or an older one that works , then connect monitor to it .	St
1.2.2	If you can then see any display , its your orginal video port or card is bad .	St
1.2.3	With power off remove the just tested card , working or not , and find on the mtrbd .	St
1.2.4	the CMOS clearing pins .	St
1.2.5	Check your manual or online support website to locate them .	St
1.2.6	Follow the instructions and just monetarily short them when applying power .	St
1.2.7	This should cause the CMOS ( bios ) to return to default vales .	St
1.2.8	See , if the orginal video port/card can now access a display .	St
1.2.9	Of course if a card , make darn sure its fully seated .	St
1.2.10	If can see a display , reboot to access the bios screen area .	St
1.2.11	Verify the bios reflects it has choosen what is your proper video out source .	St
1.2.12	If can see any display with orginal port/card things are working .	St
1.2.13	If not , but with the old card , then that suggests the orginal port/card is bad .	St
1.2.14	However , I have seen this problem if you do n't install the latest video drivers and/or bios updates .	St
1.2.15	Check to reseat the monitor cable , plus look at connector for no bent/pushed in , broken pins .	St
1.2.16	Of course use a working monitor tested good elsewhere to eliminate that .	St
1.2.17	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.3.1	How am I supposed to reinstall bios or drivers ?	Ques
1.3.2	I ca n't see anything thats going on ! ? !	St
1.3.3	I 'll try using the video card though , that may just work .	St
1.3.4	I do have a SLIGHT suspicion of what it might be though .	St
1.3.5	most of the parts I built this computer out of I got for free , and I believe that one of the computers I took parts out of may have had some unbelievably nasty virus , so bad it was inground onto the hardware .	St
1.3.6	I 'm not sure if any of that computer is in this one , but I do know that a 3.5 & quot ; floppy drive has its magnetic control removed , so any disk put in it is magnetically wiped ... but only if its hooked up and on .	St
