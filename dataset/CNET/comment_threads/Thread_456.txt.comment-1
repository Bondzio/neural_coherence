The problem started sometime ago.
When i turn on my pc, i hear 3 beeps and then everything goes dead!
I thought it was a hardware problem so after experimenting i got the pc to work by removing RAM, turning on pc, let it display a memory missing screen, turn off without saving configuration, reinsert RAM and turn on PC.
The boot up takes atleast 1 min while the welcome screen takes ages to appear and once it is there, it displays &quot;windows is starting up&quot;, the logon takes a year and then another for loading the startup apps.
But as soon as it is done,the PC goes back to normal.It works fine without any freezes or lacking.I play games, surf the web, listen to music,etc.
The shut down is no problem at all but the same thing happens the next time i bootup!
Pliz help, this is very annoying!
