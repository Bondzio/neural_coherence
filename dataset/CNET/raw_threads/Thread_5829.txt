I also multitask with at least 2 browsers being open, 1 or 2 additional files that I am working on in Draw. Question is this.... If I increase my ram to 768m (+$250) or 1g (+600), will I gain that much speed with redrawing corel files, internet work, etc (while multitasking)? Also, does the ram have anything to do with the spooling speed to my HP 1700 printer? I don't want to spend the $ if I will only see a 10% increase in performance. Thanks, Flip

But time and time again, the person is told that it will display the ide channel is in DMA, but the bug has it in PIO mode. The fix is to set it to PIO, OK it then go back in to set it to DMA. No reboot is needed, yet less than half can accomplish this task even with 100 word descriptions about the issue. More words about this issue at http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/storage/IDE-DMA.mspx 2. Spyware. Today's plague is spyware. &quot;TECH&quot; now suffers a near 90% call rate due to spyware instead of broken hardware or &quot;real problems&quot;. Through a year of spyware calls the common issue is the continued use of Internet Explorer as the person's only browser. Sadly with Firefox or Mozilla they could have avoided the service call. Bottom line? No spyware or don't complain. http://www.spywarewarrior.com/rogue_anti-spyware.htm notes retail software that adds insult to injury to those that pay for removal software. 3. Finally, when steps 1 and 2 are complete a trip to Black Viper's web page about services and more can reduce what a machine is doing and give back both RAM and CPU cycles. I use most of what he wrote to have my old laptop running circles around new laptops that have 2X the RAM and GHz. http://www.blackviper.com/WinXP/servicecfg.htm 4. Adding RAM. While it's not loading that many 10M JPEG images, we did a real interesting test on our DVD rendering boxes. There were 2 exact clones built for this with identical CPUs, boards, drives OS, settings and Video. They diverged in that one had 512MB, the other had 1.0G RAM. On the 6 hour render, the 1GB machine finished 5 minutes sooned. We then moved a 512MB stick to the other machine and it finished 5 minutes sooner and the other machine went back to 6 hours. For this application and setup, the payoff was so minuscule it was not funny. Bob

With the XP OS, having above 512mb is *real desirable* while the payback may not be huge you certainly benefit from it. While windoze can mutlitask, if you have alot going on you really dimimish the results as resources are used elsewhere, try to keep this to a minmium if results are needed right away. Overall, you system maybe bested served is having whatever &quot;tweeks&quot; are needed to jug along. Besides the Black Viper website, try this one as well: http://www.dougknox.com for your OS. As for your printer once you handoff a printing task, it suppose to fulfill it on its own resources. The system provides initial spooling but repeats should go smoother. However, the larger the task the more difficult it becomes and if the printer has to slow down it bottlenecks back tomthe system to &quot;wait&quot; and if it waits, it will fill-up the spooler quickly. if you do alot of this you may want to invest in a &quot;buffer box&quot; to dump tasks into its own memory or increase the printer's memory, if applicable. Usually, inkjets aren't memory upgradable, thus the buffer box. Look at Buffalo product line in what they offer and similar vendors. Under the printer's spool setting, check to see if you have RAW selected, it should print faster. good luck -----Willy
