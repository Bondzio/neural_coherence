the msi support site only lists a p965-neo and p65-neo f v2 .
the p965-neo f v2 has been tested with the new e7000 and e8000 series core2duos.
the e7400 isn't on the tested list but it will work since the only difference between it and the e7300 is the multiplier.
(the support list for older boards isn't updated often.)
the p965-neo has only been teseted with e4000 and e6000 series core2duos and may not work with the e7000/e8000 series.
as for the video card, a 450w or larger power supply is recommended.
here's a suggestion: ocz 500w, $60 before $20 rebate
