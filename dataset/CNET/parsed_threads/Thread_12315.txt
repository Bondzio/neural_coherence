<s> I cannot access the Internet through my router because it has been reset to its factory settings. </s>
<s> We have a strange, perhaps illogical network setup in our office. </s>
<s> Although it was set up before my time, I have figured it works as follows: (1) A wired/wireless router (let's call it Router A) is connected directly to the DSL modem. </s>
<s> (2) An Ethernet cord runs from this router to a 5 port switch. </s>
<s> (3) 4 cords run from the switch to individual workstations. </s>
<s> These computers obtain their IP addresses automatically. </s>
<s> (4) 1 cord runs from the switch to another wired/wireless router (let's call it Router B). </s>
<s> (5) Two cords run from Router B to individual workstations (let's call them Workstations C). </s>
<s> These computers used permanent IP, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server addresses. </s>
<s> I understand that this was done because they could not obtain their IP addresses automatically. </s>
<s> The problem I've caused seems to stem from me resetting Router B to the factory settings while trying to secure its signal and changing its IP address from 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.1.1 (in order to avoid conflict with the modem which has the same IP address). </s>
<s> Once I did that, Workstations C could not access the Internet. </s>
<s> I have tinkered with the TCP/IP settings for Workstations C (e.g. </s>
<s> by changing the default gateways to the Router B's new IP address), but it doesn't work. </s>
<s> What else should I be doing? </s>
<s> Should I go into the router admin to change settings there? </s>
<s> I would appreciate any help. </s>
<s> Rarely mix. </s>
<s> Why not set it up properly? </s>
