My pc keeps rebooting and I was thinking of buying a new mobo regardless but anyway to the question.Does it matter if i buy an micro atx mobo for my case?
My case is not small its a normal sized case.
This is the mobo I wanted for cheap.

I know what socket and stuff I need but will this micro atx mobo fit in my case.
What i mean is will i be able to screw it in the motherboard without any problems?
