hi i have a problem with my pc it will switch on but will not fully boot up.
when it is switched on it just sticks on a grey screen and stays there.
sometimes it will go the whole way but other times i have to end up pressing the button to try again.it won't even boot in safe mode.
i recently have just been putting it in stnd by mode but we had a power cut the other day and it shut the pc down while it was on.when i tried to boot it up it was running through all the files and saying file segment unreadable.i called my local computor shop and he cant fix it,he has now formatted my pc and put window 7 on and it works fine but now i dont have any of the software i used to have like power cinema, blue soliell,microsoft office 2000, outlook express,my wireless drivers dont work either.it runs great and boots up fine but all my stuff has gone.can anyone help
