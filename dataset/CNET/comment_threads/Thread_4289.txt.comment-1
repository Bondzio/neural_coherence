I've set up the following DC's on virtual machines: On DC1 you set the IPv4 settings are: IP: BLANK Gateway: BLANK Primary DNS: 127.0.0.1 Secondary DNS: 192.168.0.1 (Broadband Router) What IPv4 settings settings do I enter on DC2 so as it points at DC1?
IP: Gateway: Primary DNS: Secondary DNS: Any help would be greatly appreciated?
