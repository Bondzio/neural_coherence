Hi there, (system: xp home, 500MHz memory, 10 gig hard drive) I know, there must somewhere be, the details of the process of copying everything from old(5 years) small Hard drive drive to a new WD ide (160 Gig)hard drive, so that the old drive could be used as a second (slave) hard drive.
I have not succeeded in finding it.
Is it, at all, possible to copy without the special software?
Please help.
Thank you.
