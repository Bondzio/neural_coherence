thanks to all on this forum.
i have read threads and followed to other sites and read some more.
i want to purchase a new desktop and have tried to learn all i need to know to make the best purchase.
now my brain is fried.
i'm pretty sure i want an intel dual 2 core proc, alteast 2-5 gigs of fast ram, a fast bus, a great video card, etc (in other words i want the thing to be fast) the biggest software program i run is quickbooks pro, soon to be 2008. i'd love to download music and small videos without problems.
i don't know how to build a puter, and can't find one that's got all i want in a package.
btw, don't want to spend more than $800-$1,000.
my question is can someone tell me where's the best place to buy and exactly what specs to make sure are included?
i promise not to hold anyone responsible later and will be eternally grateful not to think about this again for another 5 years.
thanks in advance.
