1.1.1	Like Crafty , I have a choice betwen the above two processors .	St
1.1.2	Which is best and most reliable - not necessarily the fastest ( I rarely if ever play games etc ) , but use the PC for general home use and surfing the internet .	St
1.1.3	Any advice much appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	... but the 533MHz FSB is really killing it .	St
1.2.2	Unless you do some heavy multitasking , the AMD will be better .	St
1.2.3	The Intel is cheap , though .	St
1.3.1	I assume that you mean the AMD Athlon 64 X2 , right ?	Ques
1.3.2	I built my system on this and love it .	St
1.3.3	I think the performance is so much better than the Pentium D 's .	St
1.3.4	And it seems I am not alone in this opinion , virtually every opinion , review , or site says the same thing .	St
1.3.5	Even if you are n't a gamer , fast is good , right ?	Ques
1.3.6	And dual is the way to go nowadays , especially with Vista coming .	St
1.3.7	You will benefit from dual core no matter what .	St
1.3.8	The X2 3800+ is a great value-to-performance ratio at $ 300 from Monarch .	St
1.3.9	Do n't worry about comparing clock speeds , Intel and AMD rate them differently ( as you prolly know ) .	St
1.3.10	If you want more opinions , you can search my profile/posts for more info .	St
1.3.11	Good luck , cheers .	Polite
1.4.1	I bought a HP computer that has the AMD 64x2 4200 and could n't be happier .	St
1.4.2	I added a video card and another gig of ram and the computer is amazingly fast .	St
1.4.3	A friend bought a computer with the Intel duel core processor and has had a lot of heating problems with it .	St
1.4.4	He has the same model computer as mine but with the Intel processor and mine runs circles around his speed wise .	St
1.4.5	I do n't do gaming but I do a lot of grapics and the speed is very much welcomed .	St
1.5.1	the athlon 64 x2 is fast powerful and very overclockable .	St
1.5.2	with netburst you cant overclock	St
1.6.1	... is very good for overclocking .	Polite
1.6.2	You can get a 3GHz P4 to 4GHz with relative ease on stock cooling .	St
1.6.3	However , they get owned by AMD 's in every benchmark , and the Intels have to be clocked very high to beat the AMD 's .	St
