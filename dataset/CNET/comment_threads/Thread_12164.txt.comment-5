To some extent that's like saying a Chevy won the Daytona 500, so their cars must be the best mileage.
Supercomputers != consumer computers.
I think it'd be great if AMD would catch up and pass, as we all benefit from the results of competition.
But for now doing main HQ in Dresden's euros vs Intel's devalued US$ and the sizable lead Intel has, I think it'll be after we get a new CPU slot (so new mobo) before a person would feel like they'd get categorically better performance from AMD than they can from Intel.
