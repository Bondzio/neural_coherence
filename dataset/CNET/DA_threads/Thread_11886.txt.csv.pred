1.1.1	So I 'm looking for a new gaming PC .	St
1.1.2	I was originally looking at the dell xps 630 with some upgrades ... then I noticed the studio xps and it seemed too good to be true .	St
1.1.3	which do you guys recommend ?	Ques
1.2.1	if you need the processing power , get studio xps gaming , ignore .	St
1.2.2	If a Radeon 4850 is all you need , you can build a machine for about $ 1000 or less using cheaper parts .	St
1.2.3	If you need high framerates , look for a higher end graphics card , try dual 4870 X2 's , using lower end processor/mobo/whatever you can get much better framerates for same price	St
