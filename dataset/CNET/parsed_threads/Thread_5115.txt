<s> So i have every part other then the video card or card's. </s>
<s> I put together this assembly - E6600 , P5W DH deluxe, 400 sata2 7200 hdd, Dvd burner, card reader, 900 case, raidmax 580 psu, 2 gb corsair ram at 800 mhz dual channel, all in all a good setup. </s>
<s> But now me and my bro where thinking of 2 x1950 pro's, 200 dollars each. </s>
<s> I need a second third opinion, i think it will be alright ? </s>
<s> I have 3 led 120 mm fans, and 1 200 mm fan for cooling, my psu has an led fan blowing towards the mobo, and of course cpu fan </s>
<s> will be fast as or faster than x1950s in crossfire for less cash. </s>
<s> for your opinion </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102096 Which will provide the dual solution on a single PCB. </s>
<s> As far as I know you cannot dual up the 2-way cards, but the other poster was correct that the 8800GTS will provide more rendering power (ATI's CrossFire doesn't give a speed advantage (per se), it gives image quality advantages). </s>
<s> the x1950's have an internal bridge connector so they both can be installed on a crossfire board, as for the 8800 gts i will do some research on that card. </s>
<s> thank you </s>
