I suggest looking at an HP.
It is a middle range brand with good quality.
Another good brand is Lenovo and for $500 you'll find something nice with either brand.
Since you dont need anything fancy, look for something with these specs: * Intel Core i3 -or- Intel Core 2 Duo -or- AMD Athlon II * 3 or 4 Gigabytes of Memory * 500Gb Hard Drive or more * Windows 7 I've read not to bother with any warranty they offer because usually problems occur within the first year and the manufacturer should cover that.
Here's a few I've picked out for your price range.
