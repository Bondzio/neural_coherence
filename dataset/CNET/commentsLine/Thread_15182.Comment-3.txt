i hope you entered the bios and made the 1st boot device the cd/dvd drive in order to proceed quickly to boot from disc and saved before exiting.
otherwise, it will error or complain and try to boot from hd and then goto the restore disc(cd drive).
if already done and set in the bios, then you may have a further issue.
hp and other provide a 2nd partition on their hds to access the restore/recovery process.
also, this is where the creation of making your own restore/recovery discs for you usage if needed.
replacing the hd, of course removes that option.
provided you have working restore discs, then it should the process.
you say you have them but encounter problems.
excluding any other issue, &quot;do you trust the restore discs&quot;?
if these are factory provided, then ok, if you made them some doubt maybe at work.
otherwise, in most cases it should have started the recovery process.
the other half of this is not a recovery issue but a true h/w fault with the mtrbd., bios, or related cause.
if you have warranty, then use it.
you can post your query in the hp forum here and see where it leads.
you maybe asked to drop this one and/or be informed of any continuation of this thread.
fyi- i have found hp issues to be problematic in the last few yrs.
and resolving them more hassle than encountered before.
while success is at hand, too often only a new part or factory supplied one seems to resolve the problem.
basically, imho it seems more constricted to apply true tested fixes from the past.
&lt;div&gt; tada -----willy &lt;/div&gt;
