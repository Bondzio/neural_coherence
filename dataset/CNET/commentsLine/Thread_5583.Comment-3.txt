verify you're plugged in to the right sound port.
then verify in the bios area that you have the audio, &quot;enabled&quot;.
read your manual to find out just what key sequence is required to eneter the bios.
also, make sure to save any changes before exiting the bios area.
these are primary steps that have to be checked.
good luck -----willy
