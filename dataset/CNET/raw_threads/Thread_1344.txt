Unless you spend big $$$ it is unlikely you would see much of a speed improvement. Have you checked the manual from the mobo to see what the highest speed CPU it will take?? Have you checked the mobo mfr's website to see if they offer a BIOS update to allow the mobo to use the latest fastest CPU. Again, unless you go from the standard socket 754 CPU to the FX model, and if you you then change your memory to the registered type, you are really at a dead end with the socket 754. All of the development of CPU's are related to Socket 939, until they come out with the new CPU's that will support the use of DDR 2.
