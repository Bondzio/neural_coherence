<s> It's my dad's laptop and his hard drive failed so I wanted to upgrade to a ssd, upgrade the motherboard, and upgrade the memory. </s>
<s> I have about $500 to spend can anyone help me decide what brand to buy? </s>
<s> I want to make it as fast as possible and possibly play a few games and download movies and music etc... </s>
<s> I had the Intel SSDSA2CW160G3K5 320 Series Solid State Drive - 160GB, SATA 3Gbps in mind. </s>
<s> is that too much would a 120 GB be enough? </s>
<s> Like you used to own a desktop. </s>
<s> Laptops don't have interchangeable motherboards. </s>
<s> You can get RAM from Crucial and I like the Seagate Hybrid drive (won't break the budget.) </s>
