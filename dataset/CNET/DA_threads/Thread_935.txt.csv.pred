1.1.1	I just moved into a home that has and office.	St
1.1.2	There is a wall plate with a jack to run Cat5e to the upstairs bedroom.	St
1.1.3	I plugged that office wall jack into the router, and the bedroom jack into my laptop and have a perfect connection.	St
1.1.4	My problem is that i need that wire to go to a theater room at a different part of the house (still upstairs like the bedroom).	St
1.1.5	I bought a 50ft cat5e cable and a coupler and connected everything.	St
1.1.6	When i did i dont get a connection.	St
1.1.7	I double checked the wiring and all seemed correct.	St
1.1.8	I then replaced the 50ft cable with a new 50ft cable thinking it was bad but same results.	St
1.1.9	I finally tried a shorter 6ft cable and it worked fine.	St
1.1.10	Any ideas???	St
1.1.11	Thanks in advance.	St
1.2.1	Your next job is to check that the wire pairs were done properly in the wall jacks.	St
1.2.2	There are 2 standards and one is for something other than Ethernet and will cause issues like you reported.	St
