<s> I am going to Europe for 10 days and trying to decide between a netbook or a tablet so that I may check email in my hotel. </s>
<s> I will have free wi-fi in the hotel, and checking email and some light web browsing are the only functions needed. </s>
<s> I am looking to spend $200-$250, no more. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>

<s> so Kindle Fire might be the way to go. </s>
<s> I haven't taken mine on a trip yet, but I intend to this winter! </s>
<s> It sends and receives email just fine. </s>
<s> It holds it's charge for a long time, too. </s>
<s> The only thing that I'll miss is the ability to transfer the photos that I take onto the tablet. </s>
<s> My existing Netbook is sometimes a hassle to transport, but I love the ability to transfer my photos, evaluate them, and do a little basic editing before I get home, but this trip I know that I'll feel less burdened down with stuff. </s>
<s> If we had the budget we could buy a tablet that could do all these things and more, but I'd prefer to spend the $$ on travel. </s>
<s> Thanks for the feedback. </s>
<s> I was thinking of either the Kindle Fire or a netbook. </s>
<s> Would a netbook be easier to type out emails and use for Skype calls? </s>
