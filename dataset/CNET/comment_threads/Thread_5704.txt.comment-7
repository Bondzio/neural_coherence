Even though the WGT624 v3 model just hit the stores, it may have been boxed months ago.
Take a look at the firmware on Netgear.com.
It looks like there is a &quot;version 1.0.128_1.0.1&quot;.
It was published on 15-SEP-2005 and includes 12 bug fixes.
On the other end, download the latest driver for the wireless network adapter.
Hope this helps!
