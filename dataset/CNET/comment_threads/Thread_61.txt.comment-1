ok first i am srry if i am posting in the wrong section because this is my first time on the CNET boards.
i proble is as follows: i have 1 80 gb HDD and 1 40 GB hdd.
i want to make 3 total partions (each 40gb) for a seperate OS install.
if i use a boot loader, can i still boot the the 2ed 40 gb HDD?
or do all the partions need to be on the intial 80 GB HDD so i can boot to them?
Thank You.
