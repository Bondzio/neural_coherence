since you stated the monitor works with your laptop.
you should check your motherboard.
is there any reason why you were using a pci video card before when it has an agp slot?
or does the mobo have an onboard graphics which has to be disabled before you can use an agp or pci video card?
you need to give more info on your system otherwise no one can assist effectively.
we are not in front of your pc and have no clue what components you have.
maybe the cards has not been seated properly?
tell the whole story.
