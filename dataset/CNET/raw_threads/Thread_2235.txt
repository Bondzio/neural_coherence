I don't know if thats enough for all that stuff. also, on the motherboard I doubt I am ever going to do SLI for an 8800. and I am also only going to have one (maybe one more) SATA hard drive in there and one older hard drive. I do know that I plan on having this computer a while though so should I go for a good mobo like that or does it not matter? thanks in advance guys.

Do you really need the Intel Core 2 Extreme? yes it is best but you pay some 3-400 more for it. Also there is rumor that the prices well drop on all these dual cores sometime in July Augs. If you can wait this same Extreme well be around 2-300 from what it sounds like.

Good choices.

I really really wanna know. Thanks a million.
