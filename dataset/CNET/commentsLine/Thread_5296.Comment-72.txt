if you ever want to use augmented reality apps, or play any games besides pacman, get a bigger graphics card.
even a fifty dollar pci express graphics card is better than most on-board integrated graphics cards.
i found this out the hard way when i bought a new pc that i thought was bitchin' fast.
movies will look better, games will play better, or at all with a card that supports direct x 10 or 11.
