So i had to take it to a Samsung maitenance point where they did a system upgrade. Then my problem with the wi-fi connection started. My problem now is that i cannot connect to my home wi-fi but i can connect to my office wi-fi. Mind you that i connect many devices at my houses's wi-fi connection: laptops, other mobile phones.... and they all work perfectly, except my Galaxy tab. can anyone help me connect back to my house wi-fi connection please? Thank you so much in advance.

Your post has so little detail that I can't tell if it's something we know about. To help others we have the top posts over in the CNET Networking Forum and a post specific to Samsung devices. Tell more and if you can't change the router settings, I need to know that so we can stop before we start. Bob

It should be documented in the manual. In fact, it's the same as you did when you told it the WiFi password you chose. Some modem/router-combo's are supplied by the ISP. Mine didn't tell about how to do it, but it was easy to find out. How's that with you? Kees
