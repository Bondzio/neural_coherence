I bought 4x1GB PC-6400 800Mhz DDR2 ram, and a used Core2Duo E6600 2.4Ghz processor. Unfortunately, turns out that my motherboard only supports this CPU, if it's rev2.0 and up, mine was rev1.02. Plus, the BIOS reads the 4GB ram as PC-5300 400Mhz (HWINFO32 does show the proper info though). So... not wanting to waste the new ram, and the processor was pretty cheap so, found a used ASUS P5Q board for sale. Before I run into any other problems... can anyone see any potential issues? Like will the Power Supply I have for the P5LD2 work on a P5Q? Should the ram read at full speed? Anything? Just wanting to avoid a headache before it happens. Thanks.

I don't know how much performance gain with the E6600 (it maybe core2duo but it's also at lower speed). I probably would just save it for the next computer (using ddr3...much cheaper than ddr2). Just my thinking on this.

I have the CPU/Fan ($25) and already bought the RAM ($30) so more just looking for potential issues. Next computer will be an 8-Core Mac Pro that I'm saving up for, hence wanting a cheap upgrade vs buying a barebone Core i5 system. I'll dual boot it wil OSX and Win7. Right now, I'm using my PC as both a computer and running XBMC as a media centre. Once I have the MAC, this will get dumped into a nicer desktop case and used for XBMC only, so, don't really need a $500 upgrade, was hoping $50 and done. Just, didn't know about the motherboard needing to be rev2.0 and up, that was a kick in the pants. If another $50 for an ASUS P5Q is all I need, I'll be happy. That being said, I can't find info about things like power supply connectors... not sure if the P5LD2 and P5Q have the same plugs or not. I benchmarked a DELL 745 which showed a good increase in performance over my PC which runs the E6600... and mine has a much better video card and ram. My theory is that I'll see a decent amount of speed increase... - My video card is a PCI-e v2.0 card running in a v1.0 slot - My ram is PC6400 800mhz, reading at PC5300 400mhz - Switching DualCore 3.4, to a Core2Duo 2.4 So, hoping that there will be some increase in performance for all 3 factors. Enough to hold me over until the MAC comes anyway. Which may be another 6 months or so... since about $2500 used. :S
