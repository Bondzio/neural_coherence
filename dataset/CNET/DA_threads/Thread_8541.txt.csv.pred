1.1.1	Hi All , This will be my first photo printer purchase so please recommend what you think would be best from your personal experiences .	Sug
1.1.2	I am seeing so many models that I ca n't figure out what the difference really is between all the different lines of printers in Canon or Epson .	St
1.1.3	I 've been looking so far at the pixma8500 and the i9900 .	St
1.1.4	It seems like the former is discontinued ?	Ques
1.1.5	And then the i9900 came out ?	Ques
1.1.6	I have also read about the Canon Selphy .	St
1.1.7	I just simply do n't know which one to get !	St
1.1.8	Superior picture quality is of utmost importance to me .	St
1.1.9	Second is money ( max : $ 500 ) .	St
1.1.10	Other features like speed , card readers , pict bridge , etc ... they are great , but not so purposeful for me since I wo n't be printing out so frequently , and mostly will be from my laptop .	St
1.1.11	I do n't print out pictures every time , but I do like to select my best ones and custom make albums , scrapbooks etc ... so that 's why I prefer the quality over anything else .	St
1.1.12	My friends swear by Epson , and I have seen their printers at work .	St
1.1.13	They are great , but I find them rather bulky in style .	St
1.1.14	The canon 's I '' ve been checking out seem much less space hogging ?	Ques
1.1.15	I have n't gone to a physical shop yet to test out any of the brands I 've read online so please offer any advice .	St
1.1.16	Thanks ! !	St
1.1.17	P. S. Oh right , one more feature is the cd/dvd supported option .	St
1.1.18	I know Epson Stylus supports them , but do any of the Canon 's ?	Ques
1.1.19	I 've been reading reviews after another , but they do n't mention it ... mmm .	St
1.2.1	... between photo printers ( which are small devices which only do 4 & quot ; or 6 & quot ; prints ) , and colour Printers ( A4 sized prints ) , which can of course also print onto white label CD 's .	St
1.2.2	www.google.com : photo printer comparison Photo printers compared ; http : //tomshardware.co.uk/2005/05/27/4/index.html www.google.com : direct cd printing Colour Printers printing onto CD 's compared ; http : //tomshardware.co.uk/2004/01/27/printing_your_own_cdrs_with_ink/index.html Good luck , GeeBee .	St
1.3.1	Taking specific models out of the matter for now , here 's what I 've picked up with a lot of experience with the two brands : Both print fantastic photos .	St
1.3.2	Canon tends to be notably faster , though .	St
1.3.3	That said , Epson seems to print more accurate colors without having to edit the photo .	St
1.3.4	Generally speaking , professional photographers seem to be die-hard toward Epson .	St
1.3.5	I 've known some to switch , but I 've also noticed lately an upswing of Canon-converts switching back to Epson .	St
1.3.6	What they told me was it was primarily due to the drivers .	St
1.3.7	Apparently Canon 's were far less feature-rich and/or much harder to use .	St
1.3.8	I 've used some Canon products and can vouch for how confusing their interfaces tend to be .	St
1.3.9	Epson has a major advantage on photo longevity over Canon , as well , which may be important to you .	St
1.3.10	Now as for models , you do seem to be listing an odd range .	St
1.3.11	You 're mentioning wide-format photo printers , photo printers with card slots ( which are usually not the professional grade or wide-format printers ) , and a 4x6 snapshot printer .	St
1.3.12	You might want to narrow down what it is you want in range , first , and then pick a model .	St
1.3.13	And I would n't say comparable Canons are any smaller than Epsons .	St
1.3.14	Both print borderlessly and both use individual cartridges , so there 's not much wiggle room left there .	St
1.3.15	Some Canons may look a touch sleeker , but I 'd be more concerned by the appearance of their output than the appearance of the machine .	St
1.3.16	Oh , and in the US , anyway , CD printing is Epson exclusive .	St
