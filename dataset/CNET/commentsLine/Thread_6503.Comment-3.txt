thanks for the info.
ive cleaned the rollers with ethanol but it hasn't helped.
i don't think it is excess ink as the lines are consistant throughout.
i have taken a photo of a printout which shows the lines, could i email this to you or somebody else in hope that you can see what the problem is ?
thanks ste
