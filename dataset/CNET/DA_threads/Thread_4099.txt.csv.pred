1.1.1	Hi , I 've spent the past few days reading around the topic of WiFi and would like to tap the experience of the forum now please .	St
1.1.2	I have a T42 Thinkpad with in-built Centrino/Intel WiFi that usually works well to pick up open source WiFI signals .	St
1.1.3	However , occasionally it fails to see signals that the computers of my friends are seeing , and I 'd like to remedy that .	St
1.1.4	However , the questions that I 've not been able to find answers to are : 1 .	St
1.1.5	Will buying a Proxim Orinoco Gold or a Senao 362 PCMCIA card lead to a better signal sensitivity than my in-built mini PCI card ?	Ques
1.1.6	I have n't been able to figure out a way to tell what the sensitivity in mW of my in-built card is .	St
1.1.7	They specs on the Proxim and Senao are for a sensitivity of 200mW but I 've read that they really are more like 100mW .	St
1.1.8	Does anyone know what the sensitivity of a mini-PCI card in a Thinkpad T42 is ?	Ques
1.1.9	2.Will buying an omni antenna with a 9dB gain and an SMA card lead to a better signal than my in-built antenna ?	Ques
1.1.10	The context for this question is that I 've read that because all 802.11g signals have a wavelenth of 12.5 cm this means that the ideal antenna is 6.25 cm , which is apparently what is inside the screen of my laptop .	St
1.1.11	Furthermore , I 've read that apparently higher gain is not necessarily better because the beam is more focused meaning that it tends to multipath .	St
1.1.12	Thanks very much for the replies !	St
1.2.1	Wifi , being in open airspace and uncontrolled can never mean that you use antenna X and card Y will assure you that it work better than antenna Y and card Z .	St
1.2.2	This concept is the hardest one to get across .	St
1.2.3	However there are new problems in the wifi world .	St
1.2.4	Just recently I ran into that new aircrack tool in my neighborhood .	St
1.2.5	My neighbors formerly good setup had tanked .	St
1.2.6	No range and spotty connects .	St
1.2.7	I got lucky in that the attack was on my wifi system first and afterwards I wrote about it and the fix in our security forum .	St
1.2.8	Now you know the wavelength you also know that moving just a few centimeters in any direction can help since there are weak or dead spots in many systems .	St
1.2.9	Sure , what hardware you note could help but anyone that tells you that it will always work better has n't been out very long .	St
1.2.10	The surefire fix I 've found is to move a few feet closer to the base station .	St
