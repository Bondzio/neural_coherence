when i chose a wireless router for use at home, i went with linksys, and i can explain my choice with one word, &quot;cisco&quot;.
linksys are the budget branch of cisco, who are definately one of the most highly regarded companies when it comes to networking hardware.
oh, and personally, i don't think the 108mbps is worth it.
i have a linksys wireless g router, but i use a wireless b card in my pc and it's perfectly alright for sharing an internet connection.
if you want to transfer big files, just string a cable between them.
also; the difference in cost for the router may only be $20, but it might add another $20 to the cost of *each* wireless card.
adding up to $100 for your four computers.... sorry if this post doesn't make much sense, i'm knackered.
