<s> My roomate just had to go to three months of inpatient rehab cuz hes dumb and now Im worried about some of his friends breaking into my house. </s>
<s> My pride and joy is my collection of playstation 1 and 2 games that Ive spent years and lots of cash to get, I have hundreds of them and most of them sell for 50-175 on ebay. </s>
<s> Ive recently put them in my storage building so I dont worry about them getting stolen but now Im worried about the 95+ degree weather weve been having ruining them. </s>
<s> Is this a valid concern or are they fine in a hot storage building? </s>
<s> If not any recommendations to store and keep them safe from theft? </s>
<s> They will need to sit in there for at least 2 more months. </s>
<s> thanks in advance for your help, the main thing Id like to know is if storing them in heat will harm them in any way </s>
<s> bag and but the bag in a box and tape tin foil over the box </s>
<s> and this will definately protect them from the heat? </s>
<s> i can definately see the idea behind wrapping it all in foil but will all that insulation make it even hotter in the box? </s>
<s> I know it might seem Im being a little too anal about all this but I have a few thousand dollars invested in these games! </s>
<s> I like to collect games and systems like people cllect sports memorabilia. </s>
<s> I also have sega and nintendo games and systems Id like to store, do you think the foil thing will work for all that as well? </s>
<s> A bank safe deposit box rents for penneys a month. </s>

<s> What will happen to the magnetic coating the cd. </s>
<s> I think its not to fill. </s>
<s> It will stick with that and wont come out. </s>
<s> Are you really serious in this? </s>
