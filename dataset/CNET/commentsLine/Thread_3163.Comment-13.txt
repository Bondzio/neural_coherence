i had the same problem when i did it myself.
it took me almost two months and a lot of on line research and question answering before i found someone to tell me step by step how to do it.
the first part of this you have already done.
i've copy/pasted the information i used that worked.
hope it does the same for you.
this is directily from the person i asked on line ------ you need to create a virtual machine.
with virtual pc open -click new(a wizard will open) -next -create a virtual machine(i don't recommend the other 2 options) -name the computer(something nice/cool eg.
skynet) -choose the operating system you want(just pick other its better!
!1) -adjust the ram(use 512 unless your ram is less then one gig the use about the default 128) -create a virtual hdd(an operating system install to this).new virtual hard disk.
-10000mb(or the default) should be plenty if you dont have specific plans for this machine.
-finish you should now have a new virtual computer to work with.
now you need to install an operating system to do things with it.
1) install from cd/iso download your iso or get your installation cd into a working cd drive.
2)start your virtual machine 3)at menu click cd choose control physical drive if your using a cd or capture iso image for an iso image 4)goto action&gt;reset 5)in the virtual machine tap delete until the screen gives you a blue/grey menu 6)goto boot and get cdrom as first option.
7)hit esc 8)exit&gt;exit saving shanges this should begin the installation of whatever you have to install with *using an xp disk you won't need to worry about iso images, but microsoft does not like you using a windows installation on more than one pc so do not update your virtual pc with xp unless you know what your doing*
