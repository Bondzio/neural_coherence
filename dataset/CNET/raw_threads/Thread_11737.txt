10304	3	110526	1256164	1256046	Michael Geist	6/21/05 6:49 PM	1.11937974E12	Choose which router....	will be the access point, hard wire a PC to it and enter it's web based setup program. From here you have to see where the settings are that I referred to. If you mentioned the routers model numbers, further research can be done but until then I would be guessing.
