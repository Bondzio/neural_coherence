1.1.2	is do you have reviews on MRAM (newely introduced memory type), and is it compatable w/ current forms of Ram (ie., can it be substituted for & is there any advantage to that).	St
1.2.1	it's been around since 2002 but the first mram production order was earlier this month.	St

1.3.2	It was used because unlike EERAM and FLASH the number of erase cycles was many millions (billions?)	St
1.3.3	of cycles.	St
1.3.4	How did this become a &quot;new&quot; technology?	St
