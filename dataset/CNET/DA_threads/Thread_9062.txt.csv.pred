1.1.1	I have a desktop pc and my wife has a notebook set up on a home network.I am curious to know why both machines dont get the same email messsages.	St
1.1.2	Both machines are turned on.	St
1.1.3	do msgs not go to both machines on a network?	St
1.1.4	thanks in advance Virgil Hummel	Polite
1.2.1	whichever account they are set to go to.	St
1.2.2	IOW.... you need to duplicate the email settings on each PC then leave a copy on the server for a specified time period so that each PC will pick up the messages when logged in.	Sug
1.3.1	What do you mean &quot;leave a copy of settings on server&quot;?	St
1.4.1	your server routinly.	St
1.4.2	If you didn't do it, then your mail server quota will be full.	St
1.4.3	So, it is better to configure it only on one pc.	St
1.4.4	The configuration is on OE menu--&gt; tools, accounts, click your account, properties, advance.	St
1.5.1	to hold a copy for 5 days, that's enough time for me.	Sug
1.5.2	How it works is each PC when accessing OE will download any messages available.	St
1.5.3	Each PC will only download a particular email once.	St
1.5.4	After 5 days (for me) the mail is removed from the server.	St
1.5.5	The settings are where Melati pointed.	St
