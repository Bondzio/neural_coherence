apparently i'm missing a step?
yeah, i thought about putting the printer on the server but i'll leave that to my server vender since i don't want to mess up their work on the server.
that's why i'm trying this way myself.
if it doesn't work i'll have them come in, but their earliest date is 10 days out.
