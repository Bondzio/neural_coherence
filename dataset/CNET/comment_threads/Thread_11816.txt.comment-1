Hi I have just purchased a CPU and its an Intel Pentium 4 CPU 3GHz/1M/800 SL8HZ Skt 775.Not being technically minded I would like to ask what do all the numbers stand for?
Can any one recommend a good motherboard that i can put this CPU on.I am just in the process of building up a desktop pc.
Thanks
