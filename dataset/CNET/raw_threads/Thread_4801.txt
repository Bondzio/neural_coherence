I don't need the computer any more, so I want to take the hard drive out and put it in the new one for more storage. What is the best way to do the transplant since I can't get into windows or BIOS to try and erase everything on the hard drive????

You mount the drive in the new machine, connect the Slave connector to the drive and boot up. This just works if the Cable Select jumpers are set. Then you wipe/clean as you see fit. Bob
