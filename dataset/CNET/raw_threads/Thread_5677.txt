So I have pretty much my entire entertainment center in one corner of a room, consisting of a PS3, a 360 premium, My PC, an AV receiver, and a 24 inch monitor (Benq 241W). My receiver came with a remote and thats pretty nice, but I dont have a remote for my monitor because there is no official one, which becomes real pain to get up all the time to switch the inputs, which at that point renders that recievers remote useless. Now, the screen has USB inputs, which brings me to wonder this: Is there a way that perhaps I could go about getting a remote control, that could be customized to be used on anything I want, even something like my monitor that doesnt have an IR port (but USB ports where I could essentially attach one)? Would greatly appreciate to be helped. Oh and sorry if this is the wrong place for this kind of thread.

My issue is that my monitor doesnt have a remote designed for it, and I would like to know if its possible to get an IR Remote to get customized for use with the screen via a USB IR sensor, as well as being able to replace my current AV receivers remotes.
