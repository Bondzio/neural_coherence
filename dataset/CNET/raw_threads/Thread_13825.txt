Thank you for any help.

I hope I can find some other working idea here... One thing I didn't try is enabling upnp service on befsr41... is there a security issue for enabling upnp? Thank you again

I won't enter into that debate but will share I do have it enabled and need it for a device I own. I also see I can refine the google search to add the word PORT NUMBER or PORTS and see people talking about port numbers. I purposely did not look at the maker's web site for documentation. Bob
