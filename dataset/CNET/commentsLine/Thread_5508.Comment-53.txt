had about given up.
replaced son's laptop hd which would not boot (multiple error codes said replace).
had not done recent back up and some school project was on it.
connected it externally with docking station.
couldn't access the drive.
tried almost everything.
got to point didn't care about recovering data, just wanted to wipe it and use it for a back drive.
tried to format a couple times.
was ready to throw away.
anyhow, went to disk management, assigned new letter and deleted volume (and quick format,too i think).
recuva in advanced mode (undeleted and formatted) has now found 9550+ files and is still scanning.
looks like it will take hours and not sure if files are good or bad, but at least i have some access.
will report back tomorrow.
