I currently am using comcast.net to network 4 home PCs: 1 desktop pc (that is connected via ethernet to the router) 3 laptops (that are connected via wireless to the router) Whenever the desktop PC is used to do anything that requires any internet bandwidth (e.g.
download files, etc.
), the other three PCs connection to the Internet slows to a crawl.
This does not make sense as comcast *claims* that we have a 6mbit connection and the desktop PC uses only a small portion of that bandwidth - (between 30kbits to a peak of less than 200kbits) Is there any way to ensure that the laptops can continue running at &quot;full speed&quot; while the desktop PC can do its thing?
This has been the source of many arguments with my housemates and I and I know that there has to be a way for all of us to use this connection regardless of what each person is doing.
Thanks!
