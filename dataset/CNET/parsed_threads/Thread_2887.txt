<s> Hi, I am looking to replace my current HP1320n with a colour laser. </s>
<s> I need network connectivity and duplex built-in. </s>
<s> I have done a fair bit of research and come down to these three models: 1. </s>
<s> Brother 4050cdn 2. </s>
<s> Samsung CLP-610nd 3. </s>
<s> Oki C5650dn Brother and Samsung get excellent reviews, while I can't seem to find anything on the Oki. </s>
<s> Brother is getting a little old now, which makes me think it is soon to be replaced. </s>
<s> I would love to replace it with an MFC w. fax as I still have an ink-jet fax, but can't seem to find one that does all this for less than $700 AUD. </s>
<s> Any advice, experience or suggestions would be great! </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> IMHO, any of the prts. </s>
<s> you'ver posted will do the job. </s>
<s> If you like find out which of the toner replacements will cost to get yet another angle on cost operation. </s>
<s> As for FAX ability, if you really want it, then I'm sure they're available but you will need to pony up more $. </s>
<s> I don't like having all in one basket printers as if they glitch, you then have multiple issues to deal with. </s>
<s> As for your ptr. </s>
<s> list, I would go with the Oki model. </s>
<s> Oki, simply has a rock solid operation, though you may not find easy of fixes should they appear. </s>
<s> But, they're that good, regardless. </s>
<s> Also, consider whatever prtr. </s>
<s> you pick that these aren't zillion paper output presses, so use it as an office ptr. </s>
<s> not a printing press to reduce problems. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
