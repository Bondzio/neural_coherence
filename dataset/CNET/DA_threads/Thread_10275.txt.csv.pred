1.1.1	Some of you might remember me from a few weeks ago.	St
1.1.2	Well, since then, I have changed up my list a lot.	St
1.1.3	I'm just going to post it to see if those revisions were worth it =P I won't be posting a video card; I'll be waiting for Nvidia to release there DX 11 cards and then see how the VG scene looks.	St

1.3.1	The thing about it is the reviews are really all across the board.	St
1.3.2	I was thinking of getting a Corsair 450w for 15 bucks more...	St

1.7.1	it's the bare minimum for a good gaming card, so you have no room for growth if you want a really good gaming card.	St
1.7.2	antec earthwatts 600w, 80plus cert, $80 corsair 550w, 80plus cert, $80 before $20 rebate if those break your budget, get a more reasonably priced keyboard.	St
1.7.3	nvidia's new GPUs (based on the 'fermi' chip) probably won't be available until late december so that's when you start shopping.	St
1.8.1	I would be concerned with a 450 watt PSU running that system.	St
1.8.2	It will probably be enough but you'd be better off going with something around the 600 watt range just to ensure that the computer has enough power.	St
1.8.3	Nothing worse than having your PSU blow from being overdrawn for too long (and risking blowing other parts if the PSU were to fail).	St
