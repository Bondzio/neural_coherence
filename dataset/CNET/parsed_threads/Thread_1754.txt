<s> My Host machine is running XP home addition. </s>
<s> I just got a cable modem installed so I then bought a wireless router and 2 wireless ethernet cards for 2 98se machines. </s>
<s> All was good. </s>
<s> All 3 machines are online. </s>
<s> I ran the home network wizard on the XP machine and created the network disk for the 2 98se machines. </s>
<s> After running the set-up disk on the 98se machines I am at the following point: the 2 98se machines can see each other and access the shared documents folder. </s>
<s> The XP machine can see the 2 98se machines and access the shared documents folder. </s>
<s> When either of the 98se machines tries to access the XP machine so they can print, I am prompted for a password to access the XP shared documents folder. </s>
<s> What do I do? </s>
<s> How am I to know what the password is. </s>
<s> I was never prompted to create a password. </s>
<s> Thanks for any help </s>
<s> protecting itself from uninvited intrusions. </s>
<s> Create a user on the XP machine for each of the 98s, add a password, then try to connect. </s>
<s> If you don't have password set up in your XP pc, you don't need a password. </s>
<s> But you do need to input the username. </s>
<s> It should be &lt;domain name\computer name&gt;, leave password blank. </s>
