<s> My D-Link DI-614+ Router went on the blinks two days ago. </s>
<s> I have Comcast cable and it completely stopped working along with my internet access to my laptop that feeds from my desktop PC's home network. </s>
<s> I have the following network configurations: ~Ethernet Cable connected from Cable Modem to desktop PC ~Cable connected from Router to Modem ~DI-614+ Router ~DWL-G510 Airplus G 2.4 GHz Wireless PCI Adapter on Desktop PC ~DWL-650+ 2.4GHz Wireless Cardbus Adapter connected to Laptop PC My M1 and M2 green lights are not lit but the power light is. </s>
<s> I believe that Microsoft has installed an automatic update regarding home networking on my PC during this time so this may or may not have been the culprit. </s>
<s> I called Comcast Tech Support and they couldn't assist me with the D-Link Router, which is understandable but they did assist me with my internet connection. </s>
<s> They instructed me to connect the Ethernet cable from my modem to my desktop PC. </s>
<s> This only solved the internet connection problem. </s>
<s> I will call D-Link tonight to speak to a live person and have them walk me through the home network set-up again. </s>
<s> I've had my D-Link peripherals for 5+ years now. </s>
<s> Does anyone think that my equipment is at the end-of-life because it is so old? </s>
<s> Thank you all for your support and suggestions on this matter. </s>
<s> For example http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=WGT624NAR&cpc=HPM and even cheaper units are out there with full retail N class units at 99 bucks or less so there is no money in repair and you won't pay any counter to test your unit since for less money you get a new wifi router. </s>
<s> Does that help? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yes, Bob, this helps a great deal. </s>
<s> I just got off the phone with D-Link and since my router is discontinued and end-of-life there is no technical support available for my router since March 1, 2008. </s>
<s> I would come out way cheaper just to purchase a brand new router and call it a day. </s>
<s> It's not worth my stress level at his point. </s>
<s> I did, however, get my money's worth since it was about 5 years old. </s>
<s> Tech support recommended that I upgrade to the WBR-1310 or the WBR-2310 router. </s>
<s> I googled these units and both are considered pieces of crap and junk by a lot of the reviewers. </s>
<s> I will have to steer clear of these units when shopping for my next D-Link router. </s>
<s> Thanks for the advice and the link. </s>
<s> the DIR-655. </s>
<s> One of the best and fastest out there. </s>
<s> I've had great results from mine. </s>
<s> Thanks so much for this suggestion. </s>
<s> I will take it into consideration. </s>
<s> I've been reading reviews on a lot of D-Link products, i.e. </s>
<s> Routers and it's a hit and miss type of situation with varying reviews. </s>
<s> I just want my PCI card and laptop adapter to be compatible with whatever D-Link router I purchase. </s>
<s> I don't have a lot of funds to purchase lots of unneccesary peripherals so I need to keep this very economical and basic. </s>
<s> Once again, thanks for your suggestion. </s>
