The software you are using is very demanding and specialized. So you will need a computer to handle these aspects. You might find you need to increase your budget to get what your after. I'd contact several of these sources by phone and discuss your needs with them directly. Also you might wish to restate your question on the Graphics or Photography & Design forum(s). You might recieve a better response there. This thread is not being tracked

Core nu,mber is meaningless if there is no SMP function in the kernel. RISC processors are faster, refer to instruction set. You may have some trouble finding software compatible for such sytems and the OS that comes with/ for it unless you are currently using a *n*x platform.

Great if you run a 64-bit OS (most of us will use 32-bit Windows) 4. Results in calls to the maker asking why all the RAM doesn't show. There is so little payoff past 2GB that unless it's free I stop at 2GB. The basic machine I'd like to see is any Core 2 Duo (GHz is what you want to pay for or not), 2GB RAM, some 3D card, etc. HP should have a very nice QUAD CORE at your price. That would be the no-brainer selection. Just do that. Bob

The QUAD is not that pricey in some offerings and tackles the needs of those that will do rendering and video creation work. And YES, a 3D card is a type of graphics card. I note it due to your software list. Bob
