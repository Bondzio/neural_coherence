What happens in my case is I can take around 100 pictures, put the card in the reader and it may take 10 minutes or so for them to all open so I can start editing them.
Then once I do the editing and click save, it may take 20 to 30 sec before I can save each picture into a folder which takes another 20 to 30 sec.
I don't count the time it takes for editing as I shoot in RAW and I know that takes a little longer to process the pictures.
You gave me advise awhile back about the 3 gig switch which did help, but as I am doing more of this now I would like to get it done faster if possible.
Thanks again.
