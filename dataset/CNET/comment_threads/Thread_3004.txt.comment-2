I am now getting the message Critical Error, RAM memory usage is critically high, RAM memory failure.
If I follow the instructions through to paying for the Advanced Module the web site where the payment is going is www.windows-disk.com.
Looks like some sort of virus to me, but how do I get rid of it?
I am running AVG.
