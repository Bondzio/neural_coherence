I'm unsure why we need to discuss AVG's product here but it sounds like it corrupted your system in some odd way.
Why waste time on that?

If you can share what happens when you use the NETSH reset command, I may have more to offer.
If not and I understand folk sometimes don't understand that we can't see the screens so what is there that doesn't make sense is often dismissed as something we can't use so it's up to you to share any detail.
At least you are at the point you can save your files and start over.
