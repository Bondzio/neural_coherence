1.2.15	Frankly , you should look at benchmarks at http : //www.tomshardware.com and others to find a ready answer .	St
1.2.16	But the simple answer is that within a CPU technology , more MHz is faster .	St
1.2.17	Change technology such as a step up in FSB , then you need to re-run the benchmarks .	St

1.2.22	There is NO QUALITY in the CDRW drive market .	St
1.2.23	The simple proof of this is no-one will give you a 3 to 5 year warranty and the the price for this sort of drive is from $ 9.99 to about $ 69 for a DVD-CDRW combo drive .	St

1.3.1	Rub , rub rub , rub rub rub .	Sug
1.3.2	Sorry the crystal ball seems to be broken at the moment .	St
1.3.3	You need to post more information about the computer so you can get a better answer .	St
