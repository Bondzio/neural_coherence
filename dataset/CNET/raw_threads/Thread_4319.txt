I bought a sony vaio new August of 2004. Great computer! I have nero installed with dvd shrink. whenever I go to burn a dvd, it burns 100% succesful but when I play it it play the first 30 sec broken up than cuts off (stops). I am using memorex 8x dvd's, is it possible that I just did not adjust the burn settings on nero and just burning to fast(write speed) Any help would be great!
