umm, i'm not planning to buy a modular power supply since i've heard some bad things about it.
my choices are ocz powerstream 520 watts (this is the one i'm thinking about getting)  enermax whisper ii 535 watts  sparkle fsp550plg 550 watts  silverstone zeus sst-st52f 520 watts  antec truepower 2.0 tp2-550  umm, the reason i bought my ultra power supply was because it part of the package.
i thought it would be a good deal since the power supply and the case costs $100 each but they were selling the package for $130.
i also looked up some reviews about the power supply and they all liked it.
but umm, if you guys have some other recommended power supplies for me i'll gladly listen to them.
i'm looking for a power supply that is under $150.
i'm gonna run an amd athlon x2, sli (i'm not going to run sli right away, not until i have the money), 1 gig ram, and a m2n32 sli wireless motherboard.
