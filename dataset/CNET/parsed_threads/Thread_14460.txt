<s> My system reported a degraded RAID array and one hard drive became inaccessible. </s>
<s> The motherboard and hard drive were replaced, but the same problem recurred in 4 weeks. </s>
<s> Hard drive was then replaced again, but the problem repeated immediately. </s>
<s> HP proposes trying the hard drive replacement again. </s>
<s> Machine is running Windows 7 64 bit, and I have made no hardware modifications. </s>
<s> It was purchased in January, 2011. </s>
<s> Has anyone experienced this problem? </s>
<s> Can anything else be done to solve this problem? </s>
<s> However I think you are looking for failure proof machines. </s>
<s> We don't have such today. </s>

<s> 4 hard drive replacements within 3 months? </s>
<s> That's hardly looking for failure proof. </s>
<s> You should ask for a lot better. </s>
<s> Reading your post I only saw 2 failures. </s>
<s> At the office it's 4 years since the last drive failure. </s>
<s> However that's at the office, on UPS and in locked room so users can't touch it. </s>
