&quot;bios (as per original, not updated)&quot; i know to update it as i get hardware to sidestep issues like these.
there is another possible issue here, but i can't tell in your posts.
you may have tried to install xp onto a sata drive without supplying drivers along the way.
this rarely works.
the motherboard manual should detail what's needed.
