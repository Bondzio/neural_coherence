1.1.1	Before receiving Help and Support from Microsoft, I am promped to enter my Product ID #.	St
1.1.2	I have a valid OEM copy of Vista Home Premium but Microsoft says that my Product ID # is not valid.	St
1.1.3	My copy of Vista was installed by Hewlett Packard on one of their new machines.	St
1.1.4	My computer lists the OS Product ID # and says that this copy of Vista is activated.	St
1.1.5	I have registered my computer through HP but no one there, that I have spoken to regarding this, seems to have even a clue of what I am talking about.	St
1.1.6	As a for instance, I ask; &quot;How do I get Microsoft to recognize that my copy of Vista Home Premium is Valid?&quot; They answer; &quot;It is.&quot; When I try to explain and ask for an answer, I am put on hold, and/or transferred, and/or disconnected.	St
1.1.7	So, I thought that I'd ask you folks.	St
1.1.8	Can anyone help?	Ques
1.2.1	OEMs are not supported by Microsoft.	St
1.2.2	The only support is from the computer company, in your case, HP.	St
1.2.3	If you had purchased and installed a full retail version operating system it would include some support from Microsoft.	St
1.3.1	Microsoft will disavow any knowledge or help on this one.	Ques
1.4.1	It's beginning to seem to me that it is all set up this way to kind of monopolize the Help and Support area of their business.	St
1.4.2	However, if this is anywhere near true then why in the world would they have established links to the Microsoft Help and Supprt page - that do not work?	St
1.4.3	Could it be that they cannot remove them because they are an intrinsic part of the Vista OS?	St
1.4.4	And if this is indeed true, then why aren't a Lot of folks talking/complaining about it?	St
1.5.1	Out of the box these things do work or you put it back in the box as defective.	St
1.5.2	I do not think it's any conspiracy but the rampant virus, malware and other stuff can damage the machine if you don't firewall it from day zero.	St
1.5.3	Most vendors now understand this.	St
1.5.4	Sorry to see you struggle but as the story is told so far it's a back in the box and ask for another.	St
1.5.5	Bob	St
