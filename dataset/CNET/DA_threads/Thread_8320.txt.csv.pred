1.1.1	Hello, My laser for my DVD Drive has burned out, it is unable to read DVDs.	St
1.1.2	Anyways, I recently looked online for possible solutions and found out I can transfer a DVD Drive from one of my old computers into the burned out one.	St
1.1.3	So I thought of my TOSHIBA Laptop.	St
1.1.4	Then I started to think if it wouldnt work since laptops are compressed hardware and you cant upgrade them etc.	St
1.1.5	So my question is; is it possible to extract my DVD Drive from my TOSHIBA Laptop and place in my Desktop Computer (Windows XP Professional Edition) If so please explain the steps.	St
1.1.6	Thank you	St
1.2.1	You would use a laptop to desktop adapter.	Ques
1.2.2	However this will cost about the same price as a DVDRW drive so must you do this?	St

1.3.1	Thanks for the reply, I don't see a point in purchasing a whole new adapter, when I can just go to the shop nearby.	St
1.3.2	Thanks a lot	St
1.4.1	To avoid buying them new.	St
1.4.2	That's why I suggest you pick up a 30 buck DVDRW from geeks.com or newegg.com since the adapter should run about that or more.	Sug
