Love to help you out.
&quot;Obviously the functionality demanded is to fix a corrupt volume.
And M$ has thought to include the utility for many years - it's just an issue of documenting the error output.&quot; I'd love to agree, but must ask if we want to talk about the history of Microsoft disk repair tools (hint, it's never been better!)
or do we want to tackle your issue?
You first.
Bob
