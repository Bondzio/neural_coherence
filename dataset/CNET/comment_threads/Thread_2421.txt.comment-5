I am using Windows ME, Gateway Performance 800 Desktop, and Generic Floppy Disk Drive.
I downloaded TWEAKUI from two sources (MS and Annoyances.org.)
In each case the install process was supposed to provide a shortcut in the Control Panel but did not.
When I attempt to open the tweakui.cpl nothing happens.
The .inf file is Greak to me.
And the tweakui.hlp file dosen't seem to mention anything about this problem.
Any guidence on this matter?
Thanks, caktus
