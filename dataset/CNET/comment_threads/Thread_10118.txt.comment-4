You're welcome.
But we haven't quite slve this problem yet.
So we'll have to wait and see if this driver works.
But try and post in the original thread to keep the problem in one thread.
When you see the message that no other post is allowed try can click on another post to make your post.
Good luck.
I'll be out most of the day on Saturday and will check back this evening.
