<s> For some reason unknown to me, whenever I shut down my pc, it frezes. </s>
<s> Usually when you shut down a pc it turns off, and the screen goes blank. </s>
<s> But whenever I shut down my pc, it gets to the point where it says &quot;Shutting down....&quot; then it freezes and nothing happens. </s>
<s> I do have alot of programs running like a firewall, a spyware program (SpySweeper 4.0) and pop up blockers. </s>
<s> I thought those programs would be the problem, so I shut down each program before shutting dowm my computer, and it still froze. </s>
<s> Also I got an lcd monitor a couple of weeks ago. </s>
<s> Could that be the problem??? </s>
<s> I don't know if the problem occured before I got the lcd, all I know is that it happens. </s>
<s> Any suggestions??? </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I have XP Home operating system. </s>
