Depends on optimal requirements for the most rigorous game you plan to play.
Usually somewhere (often the bottom end) on the game software box is a list of the system requirements to run the software.
Often there will be two sets of specs: the minimal hardware required to run it (in its lowest graphical modes), and also the preferred or &quot;optimal&quot; system specs that would allow you to set the in-game graphics parameters to the higher or max variables.
Also, the DirectX minimal version the game requires is important (software wise).
The newest released is DirectX 10, which is vastly different than 9 and the previous versions.
However at the present time, DirectX 10 video hardware is just emerging and so is kind of rare to find, and can cost BIG bucks, often over $600 USD.
The prices will drop predictably over time, as earlier versions did, so most people wait on new standards until they are affordable.
