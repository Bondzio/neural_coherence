Every time I install it, I get bands of color even when it is plugged in to the four pin connector and it is connected to the monitor via VGA cable and does not work. I am frustrated with the card and am ready to give up. The System specifications: Microsoft Windows XP home edition 2002 service pack 2 AMD Athlon 64 processor 3000+ 2.00 GHz 960 MB of RAM Biostar Motherboard Alienware PC case
