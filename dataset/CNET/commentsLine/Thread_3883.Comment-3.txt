read the readme.txt file included in the pc game cd.
therein, you can find some comments and tips about the use of various video cards when playing the game as well as compatibility issues (if there exists).
some games are selective of video cards like the compatibility issues of nvidia and voodoo cards to some games.
read it, i am sorry, i don't have that kind of game.
it will also give you (the readme.txt) perhaps the best setting to make, and in some instances, the best type and brand of video card to opt for.
good-luck.
