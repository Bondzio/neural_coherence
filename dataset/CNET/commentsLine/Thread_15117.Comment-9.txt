i need something ultra portable with a long battery life.
i have tried bluetooth adapters before and they all fall short of what i need.
mostly because i forget them at places but also it's an add-on and i really hate add-ons.
the same goes for the webcam.
i had separate webcams but having one built in the computer is pretty sweet.
processing speed is absolutely important.
it's a computer no matter how you look at it.
otherwise they would install windows mobile, or android.
it is equally important to know how much ram it can take because it's a computer.
same goes with hard drive space.
i have had this netbook for 2 days and am really impressed with what i can do with it.
it goes far beyond being able to view websites and writing documents like the advertisements say.
i based that initially off of the specs but it was confirmed when i bought the device.
