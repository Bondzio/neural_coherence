I also was having thoughts of replacing the oem 80gb 2mgb cache drive with a 160gb 8gb cache sata. Am concerned about opening a can of worms as emachines doesn't provide windows OS disc. I have been told to Ghost the 80 to the 160 if replacing. I thought of just adding the 160 and using the 80 as the boot disc and 160 for programs and storage, any words of wisdom re: best performance? I have the 160 already so it isn't an expense to do this, just may be a headache. 2nd Would like to run 3 monitors, anybody done this with an emachine? Thanks for your help Nick

Bought at BBY for $179.00 (I know I could have got it cheaper but I had a gift card and I wanted it now.) Works great with dual monitors right out of the box. I am not a gamer, just looking for dual monitors and with the onboard ATI chipset decided to stay with ATI since I am not a techie. I emailed emachine tech support and have had quick response. Tech told me the card would automatically disable the onboard and it did, I didn't have to change jumpers or go in to bios. I hooked up a new 19'' Norwood monitor I picked up at Compusa 199.00 to the dvi and the oem 15'' emachine lcd to the vga slot, all I had to do was adjust the resolution down on the 15'' to 1024 and they both worked. I would like to run 3 monitors so I am going to push my luck and install an inexpensive pci video card to try and run a 3rd monitor. Next up replacing the hardrive with a 160gb hitachi sata. Was told the recovery cd would boot the hitachi and install the OS and drivers we will see..... Nick
