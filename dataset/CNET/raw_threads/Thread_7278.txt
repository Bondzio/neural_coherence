Sometimes when i try to get on the internet and cannot , i click the notification symbol and it is scanning. I tried calling them and i was put on hold and tried their website but had to register for their forums and got no answer. Sometimes it scans for more than an hour sometimes less. why is it scanning?It does not always scan i can just access the internet with ease. rebooting does not help. Thanks!

Such as what router you have and did you set it up like we ask at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7589_102-0.html?forumID=62&threadID=264135&messageID=2584349&tag=forums06;forum-threads I know a few that use their neighbors wifi and for them, that scanning is normal since you're never sure the neighbor's wifi is on.

Do not want to get her involved.I have a wireless laptop which i can use instead of my desktop and does not involve the linskeys. I was just wondering what scanning it is doing on the desktop and if i can stop it from scanning and still use the internet. What is it scanning for? maybe signal strength is too low?
