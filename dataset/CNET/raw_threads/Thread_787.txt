Also I want to upgrade my current video card http://tinyurl.com/7tcpllp to this one http://tinyurl.com/7e2q8wj will it fit? I know I should just get a new computer and mine is old, but I really just have to make due with what I have right now. If anyone has any suggestions on how I can improve my computer they will be appreciated.

I seriously doubt adding RAM will provide a noticeable performance boost either. You might consider banking the cost of it until you're ready to move on. I know that's not what you're asking but, IMO, it's reasonable advice.

You have to remove the current 2x1gb to do that. HOWEVER, if you're running the 32-bit OS, it will report 4gb of ram but can actually only use 3.2gb of it, due to OS limitations. tada -----Willy
