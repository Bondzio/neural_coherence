<s> I am a newbie.Windows xp This is what I want to do...I want to put Roxio 10 on the WD drive and then load my pictures on it too. </s>
<s> I want to do all Roxio jobs on this harddrive because when I do it on my C: drive it is painfully slow. </s>
<s> Can I do this? </s>
<s> How can I install Roxio on my WD drive? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Think about the Slowski's. </s>
<s> Can I transfer any program to the WD? </s>
<s> or just the data? </s>
<s> How about Quicken? </s>
<s> If I can how do I do this? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> When you install programs most offer a choice of where to install. </s>
<s> But USB drives are not too quick compared to internals. </s>
<s> Nice place for a backup copy but not a true backup. </s>
<s> Think of USB drives as extended but a little slower storage space. </s>

<s> How difficult is it to install an internal drive? </s>
<s> Would this solve my problem? </s>
<s> The owner may not want to investigate this. </s>
<s> I can't because you are not following the guidelines in our forum note. </s>
<s> Those words in red are there so I don't have to ask for that detail. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I don't understand? </s>
<s> Much about the USB or the host machine. </s>
<s> Given only the details you elected to share so far all I can note is that you can't be given more than a generic answer because the details are not in your posts. </s>
<s> I don't ask for such since that is asked for every time you make a post. </s>
<s> That is, &quot;the words in red.&quot; </s>
<s> Thanks for helping. </s>
<s> My operating system is Windows xp version 5.1. </s>
<s> Memory 261,124KB. </s>
<s> Where do I find the model number? </s>
<s> What other info do you need? </s>
<s> The external hard drive is WD passport 250 kb, usb 2. </s>
<s> Such decals like Dell, Compaq, etc and a model number. </s>
<s> Same for the drive. </s>
<s> Those came with either sata or ide drives so the exact model number is called for. </s>
<s> If these can't be found then it's a trip to a service counter to get it done. </s>
