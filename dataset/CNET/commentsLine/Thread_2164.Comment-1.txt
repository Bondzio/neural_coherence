when i first got my hp pavilion it worked like a charm.
i installed norton 360 and soon after that little things started to happen.
finally, the computer started to reboot at what seemed random times.
i had the computer checked out by a 'professional' who was only able to slightly improve the computer's performance.
he took out norton 360 claiming that it was damaging some parts of the operating system, windows xp entertainment edition.
i really don't want to reinstall the operating system, as i have installed some free software that is no longer available.
lately, when i try to turn off the computer via 'run etc', the computer reboots.
i have to resort to turning off the computer via front panel switch.
i use the computer for work and don't really want to have much down time.
any help i can get in this regard will be most appreciated.
thank you
