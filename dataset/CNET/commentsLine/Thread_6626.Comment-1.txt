i have searched high and low on here for this answer.
got close but no cigars.
anyway.
we just bought an external hard drive(seagate-desk 500gb).
we have moved a bunch of music,pictures,documents and other stuff to it.
what i'd like to know is, will it copy the same file or program again and again or will it know that it is already on there and move past it?
just as when downloading pictures from our camera to the desktop, it will only download the new pictures.
do these hard drives operate the same way?
this thing came with no directions except how to connect it and plug in the power.
then you visit their site which spins you in circles.
thanks for any help
