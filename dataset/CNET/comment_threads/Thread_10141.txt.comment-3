I have the mac address and all that info, just need to know how to configure the router to perform as a bridge.
The bridge tab in setup does not have many options to choose from and no directions.
As far as lightning goes, this is not a permanent installation, and lightning is infrequent in the winter months.
If you do not have first hand knowledge of how to set it up, why respond?
?
