1.1.1	Hi all .	St
1.1.2	Running a Dell Dimension with a Pentium III , 2800 MHZ , added HD of 160 GB , 512 RAM .	St
1.1.3	Anyway , for almost three years this computer has run fine .	St
1.1.4	My harddrive melted down at one point and had to be replaced about 18months ago , but no issues since .	St
1.1.5	Recently I went home from school and took my comp with me .	St
1.1.6	When I got home I noticed it was running slower than usual , but I thought it might just be my perception or that I was connected to the internet when the computer was ready to be on a LAN like at school .	St
1.1.7	Anyway , after a month at home and now a day or two at school with internet , I am sure neither of those are the problem .	St
1.1.8	Here 's what happens : Boot-up takes about 5 minutes , sometimes more , just to get to the Windows XP log in screen .	St
1.1.9	From there it takes 2 more to get to the Desktop .	St
1.1.10	Usually this would take no more than 2 minutes combined .	St
1.1.11	I have noticed a new ( and weird ) screen when booting up too .	St
1.1.12	After the & quot ; Dell & quot ; load screen with the small black bar that turns white , the screen goes black and a white load bar appears along the bottom that takes about 10 seconds to fill .	St
1.1.13	Then it goes to the normal WinXP boot .	St
1.1.14	Once running , the computer seems to work fine , but is sluggish and sticks in places it normally would n't .	St
1.1.15	No HD noises , but the entire system does seem to 'hum ' a little more than it did before .	St
1.1.16	Even when not doing anything , or after sitting for hours without any programs running or anything , it will still be a little sluggish .	St
1.1.17	Anyway , that 's the whole story .	St
1.1.18	I 've tried all different kinds of solutions that I know of just to keep XP running smoothly ( freeing up HD space and clearing processes ) , but with no luck .	St
1.1.19	Any and all help is appreciated !	St
1.1.20	-dcm	St
1.2.1	A shot in the dark , but three things I can think of : 1 .	St
1.2.2	The humming sound you hear may be a failing processor fan .	St
1.2.3	2 .	St
1.2.4	Another possibility is that power connector 's wires touching the fan blade and thus not allowing the fan to reach its full RPM .	St
1.2.5	3 .	St
1.2.6	You might check to see if the processor fan has come loose during your move .	Sug
1.2.7	This would keep the fan from making the proper contact with the processor core .	St
1.2.8	In all three scenarios , if the processor fan is not working properly , your processor will overheat .	St
1.2.9	I ca n't remember if the Pentium III has over-heating ( thermal ) protection or not , but if it does , it will reduce its speed from the full 2800 MHz to & lt ; literally & gt ; a crawl .	St
1.2.10	If you are experiencing crashing problems , I 'm pretty sure that your proc is overheating .	St
1.2.11	You might make sure the memory modules are seated properly .	Sug
1.2.12	Hope this helps .	St
1.3.1	Thanks .	Polite
1.3.2	I thought it might have something to do with the fans , I guess I noticed they seemed slow or something but never knew whether they actually were .	St
1.3.3	I 'll give this a shot .	St
1.3.4	Only question : how do you do this ? ? ?	Ques
1.3.5	How do I check the fans or tighten them if need be , etc ?	Ques
1.3.6	?	Ques
1.4.1	Other thoughts : You should check your BIOS settings to make sure that the processor 's multiplier and front-side bus speed are being reported correctly .	Sug
1.4.2	While in the BIOS , check for a menu item on the main screen called & quot ; Temperature Settings & quot ; or & quot ; PC Health & quot ; .	St
1.4.3	You might have a boot virus -- although I do n't think that would cause your PC to load for 7 minutes .	St
1.4.4	~~~~~~~~~ If that 's not the cause , we can go back to the fan issue .	St
1.4.5	Your PC seems more than a few years old so we may be on the right track .	St
1.4.6	To check your fans : While the PC is off : - Ground yourself to the PC case and at least make sure you do n't shock anything when you touch it .	Sug
1.4.7	Static electricity is not your friend .	St
1.4.8	- Open the case - Your fans are probably covered with dust .	St
1.4.9	Check the proc fan and chipset fans if you have them .	St
1.4.10	Also check the case fans for dust .	Sug
1.4.11	If dusty , go to Wal-Mart and get a can of compressed air and blow it out .	St
1.4.12	DO NOT shake the can of air WHILE blowing out the case .	Sug
1.4.13	Keep it as still as possible so the liquid does n't spray out .	St
1.4.14	- Verify that the fans are all seated properly .	St
1.4.15	You can just lightly wiggle them left and right , pushing and pulling .	St
1.4.16	- Reseat the memory modules if you feel comfortable with doing that .	St
1.4.17	Handle them by the module 's PCB edges and not the chips .	St
1.4.18	They should snap in place and only fit one way .	St
1.4.19	If all fans seem to be seated properly , turn on the PC : - Watch and listen for the fans to spin up .	St
1.4.20	Processor fans spin very quickly -- usually upwards of 5400 rpm to 7200 rpm .	St
1.4.21	If the processor fan is slow to spin up , makes a squeaking noise , an annoying buzzing noise that does n't *seem* normal , or seems to vary in speed from slow to fast , fast to slow ( and repeats this ) , you should replace it .	St
1.4.22	Your fan should screw into your processor 's heatsink somehow so it should be easy to replace .	Sug
1.4.23	Just remember that this MAY NOT BE the cause of your XP slow down problems ! ! !	St
1.4.24	If you want to proceed , you can get fans for around $ 10 - 20 at PC parts stores , zipzoomfly.com , etc .	St
1.4.25	Just make sure to get a fan that is the same size as your heatsink .	Sug
1.4.26	Or , you may find a fan/heatsink combo that fits on your processor .	St
1.4.27	If you get one of these , you 'll have to remove the old heatsink , fan , and old thermal paste from the processor .	St
1.4.28	If you do n't know how to replace it , look on tomshardware.com for tutorials on how to do this .	St
1.4.29	Or , you might find a friend with experience , or take it to a repair shop .	St
1.4.30	If all else fails , you should back up any data you have and do a clean install of XP .	St
1.5.1	I have , amazingly , the exact same problem you do ... . And my PC is somewhat like yours P4 2.8Ghz ,400Mhz FSB , Socket 478 , Thermaltake HSF 1 GB ( Two Sticks ) Corsair Value ram GeForce 4 Ti 4600 ( Albatron ) 400W PSU ( A little low , I know ) I even know of the bar you speak of , but mine fills rather quickly , 2-4 seconds .	St
1.5.2	My PC is usually annoyingly loud , like I have a Sony Bravia TV a few feet , a meter or so , away and I got ta turn the volume up wayyyy high just to combat the noises .	St
1.5.3	Well , the window in the side panel is gone , but ... . Is my HSF , like bad or something ?	Ques
1.5.4	I get a reading of like 3803 RPM , continually .	St
1.5.5	In the end , I do n't like to turn the PC off because of the bad boot time , but the racket it makes kind of forces me to turn it off so the family can get a good night sleep .	St
1.5.6	( Yes , it is that loud ! )	St
1.5.7	Just my $ .02 ~Ibrahim~	St
