I has worked great over the years and I have lots of data on the drive. Recently my drive isn't being recognized by my computer. The lights turns on on the hd and you can hear the disk spinning, but it doesn't pop up on the desktop like normal. I have tried switching the cable I am using but to no luck have I been able to get it working. Any advice? Thanks.
