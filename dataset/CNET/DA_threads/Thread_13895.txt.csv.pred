1.2.1	You could have a weak or failing PSU ( power supply ) or the infamous bad caps on mtrbd.. Google ( for example ) for bad caps , but inspect the mtrbd .	St
1.2.2	for leaking , distorted or bulging caps ( capacitors ) .	St
1.2.3	Since , you have a 1.8Mhz system that suggests you had it for awhile as that 's dated and/or been around .	St
1.2.4	In that time the PSU has aged and possibly on its last legs .	St
1.2.5	The bad caps is known problem from bad manufacture of caps .	St
1.2.6	In either case , replace , I suggest the PSU , first unless you see bad caps .	St

1.4.1	Take out that new PSU and put back in the old one .	St
1.4.2	Does the same thing happen ?	Ques
1.5.1	my old psu gt completely busted ... it gt burnt quite bad 6 months ago..i dnt thnk i can get tht bak .	St
1.6.1	Sine you mentioned you replaced the old PSU 6mos .	St
1.6.2	ago you maybe experiencing a 2ndary problem .	St
1.6.3	The final act of a dying system .	St
1.6.4	I ca n't guarantee the new PSU will fix it , it 's just a course of action to take when the system wo n't power-ON .	St
1.6.5	All too often when a burnt PSU as you say , it could very well weaken or stress or outright take another compoment or device with it , if not now , later .	St
1.6.6	try : www.badcaps.com for examples .	Sug
1.6.7	YES , a bad caps situation can be corrected , but only if you 're capable and/or allow a local source to fix it .	St
1.6.8	If outside repair , it maybe more practical to just buy another mtrbd.. for money better spend .	St
1.6.9	tada -- -- -Willy	St
