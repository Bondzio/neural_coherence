Thank you for your response and I apologize for how long it has taken me to respond to you.
I currently use Tversity, free version.
So, if I get a DLNA server, then if I try to stream something that is protected by Cinavia, it will still stream?
And an unrelated question.
Do you know how to turn off the windows media center streaming because I don't like two icons appearing on my PS3.
I know it's petty and picky but I'm picky.
