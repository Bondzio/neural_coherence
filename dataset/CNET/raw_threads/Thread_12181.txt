My old setup was: Telephone DSL to modem to Wireless &quot;N&quot; Router w/ 4Ethernet ports. Wired connection to Main computer(Top floor), Powerline connections(House wiring) to other Desktops down stairs(1st., 2nd. floors). And a few wireless iPods, Laptops/Netbooks on all 3 levels. Good wirelss signal in center of house(all 3 levels). I had some Blind Spots at the far end of the house on bottom floor. My NEW setup: Cable Company's Cable modem and Wireless Router connected to Main computer(3rd. floor). Powerline connection to down stairs desktops like before. Same Blind Spots as before but now I have my old &quot;N&quot; Router collecting dust. QUESTION: Can I add my old &quot;N&quot; router to my new network down stairs to get rid of the Blind Spots? Kind a like a WiFi Repeater?

Most cannot do that, it takes 2 radios to do it one to receive and another to transmit. Your best bet is to try to connect it with a cable. Next option is to connect it to your powerline connections. You want to use the LAN ports, check out the sticky in the forum for comments about using 2 routers and how to connect them.
