After that, at every startup I got 2 error messages. The first error message said: AirGCFG.exe - Entry Point Not Found. The procedure entry point apsGetInterfaceCount could not be located in the dynamic link library wlanapi.dll When I clicked 'ok' on that message, a second error message came up that said: WZCSLDR2.exe - Entry Point Not Found. The procedure entry point apsInitialize could not be located in the dynamic link library wlanapi.dll I have since learned that the 2 error messages could have been removed by simply updating the Dlink wireless driver. Before I discovered that fix, I did the following. I put the PC in Safe Mode, and I checked C:\Windows\SYSTEM32\wlanapi.dll to see if the SP3 install had added a second wlanapi.dll file. I thought that might be causing the problem based on some suggestions I found in a google search. Then I deleted another file that's almost identical. It was the file: WlanApi.dll. The W and A are capitalized and the file size was larger than the wlanapi.dll file that I didn't touch. Within a second or two after deleting the WlanApi.dll file, the monitor froze. I hit the soft reboot and now when the computer comes on, the monitor stays completely blank, nothing on it, no post, nothing. I turn the pc off and on and there are no beeps, all pc led's come on, the fans are on, the dvd led's light up for a moment, but monitor is blank. Any ideas on what I can do to get the pc up and running again would be greatly appreciated.

If the machine &quot;did&quot; beep after POST and now does not....make it smaller. Work with the bios....get the machine to beep. You don't need for a beep. HD's Floppies Optical Other Unplug that stuff.....get the machine to beep.
