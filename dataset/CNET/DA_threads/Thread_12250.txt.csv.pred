1.1.1	I have a hard drive out of a computer I no longer have .	St
1.1.2	If I do a complete wipe clean on it , will I need to put something back on it in order to use it as an external hard drive backup ?	Ques
1.2.1	Depending on what you mean with a complete wipe ( what program will you be using ? )	Ques
1.2.2	you might need to put a partition on it again , using your favorite partition manager ( which might be Windows Disk Management in this case ) .	St
1.2.3	Kees	St
1.3.1	If you 're going to reuse it and just want to get rid of whatever is on it , you can just format that drive .	St
1.3.2	Of course if you 're worried about other people seeing what 's currently on it , you could always use something like DBAN .	St
1.3.3	If you do use something like DBAN , you 'll need to follow Kees ' advice and put a partition on it , format it , and assign a drive letter to it .	St
1.3.4	` Good luck .	Polite
1.4.1	of DBAN , as far as I remember , is that it wipes all hard disks it can find , including the c : -drive that has Windows and everything on it .	St
1.4.2	That might not be what he wants .	St
1.4.3	That 's why I asked what program he would be using .	St
1.4.4	Formatting would be fine before using it as a backup .	St
1.4.5	But he asked about wiping , which usually means more .	St
1.4.6	Kees	St
1.5.1	If I completely wiped the drive clean , I would use CCleaner 's Drive Wipe but it sounds easier to just format it because I only want to use it for backups .	St
1.5.2	Would format be the way to go ?	Ques
1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	If you that no body else should gain access to the data stored in the hard drive then you need to go for disk wiping utility otherwise you can simply use formatting to erase the data from the drive .	St
1.8.1	I checked the hard drive for formatting and saw I have 2 partitions on it .	St
1.8.2	How do I make it only 1 partition ?	Ques
1.9.1	You delete both partitions and create a new one .	St
1.9.2	Any partition editor can do that , including Windows Disk Management .	St
1.9.3	No need to buy a program .	St
