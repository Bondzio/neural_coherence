8149	0	106295	1214354	NR	christy	5/28/05 9:37 PM	1.11731622E12	Cannot renew IP address	Setup : Computer runnuing XP Home SP1 connectes wirelessly (with D-Link Air Plus DWL 520+),with Internet connection sharing, to Home Network consisting of Ethernet ADSL modem and wireless access point/ router (the D-Link Dl-714P+), with the main computer running Win XP Pro SP2 connecting to the Dl 714 via cable. The main computer can access the Internet with no problems, and a lap top(built-in wireless) can also access the Internet wirelessly without problems. However, the computer running Windows XP Home SP1 (first above mentioned)cannot do so, getting the error ''This page cannot be displayed''. When I attempted to update AVG, I received the message '' ...The server name cannot be converted to the IP adderess....''. I tried to ''repair'' the connection but received the message ''... IP address cannot be renewed'', and at the command prompt, when running the command ipconfig /renew, nothing happened (the crusor just went to the next line after ''Enter'') This computer was able ro access the Internet previously (yesterday). It is indicating a good signal from the access point, but just cannot connect. Please advise. Thank you. christy

What I meant in my post was that the computers are able to connect to the Internet via the access point. ICS was not used. Surprisingly, the problem righted itself after a few reboots. I am still not sure what caused the problem in the first place. christy
