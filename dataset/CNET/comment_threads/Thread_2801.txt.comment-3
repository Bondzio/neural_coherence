And what if I went with an AMD Phenom X4?
I found a nice looking one at 3.5GHz on newegg for $190ish.
I know Intel tends to be more on the cutting edge, but I'm trying to stay under $1000, and I need to focus on the gpu more than the cpu, because the rig I want to build will be for games primarily.
