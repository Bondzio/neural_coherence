i know the title appear as a common one, but i couldn't find a similar problem on googling!
System just stopped working when i was playing a game, i restart but hard disk never boot again.
The HDD Led is solid ON showing no activity on windows logo screen.I can't log on SAFE MODE for the same problem.
I've tried doing a CHKDSK /r but it kept showing (Unrecoverable ..)on 25% the weird thing about this is next day i switched on the computer and it log on successfully, but it freezed (while HDD led is continuous ON) System Info: windows Xp westren digital 16CE 80GB
