is there any way to clean the heads on a floppy drive?
i am trying to make a windows 98 boot disk.
it gets about 98% done and i get a write error.
i'm thinkin' it's just crud buildup since no one uses a floppy very often.
maybe i should just pay $4 for a new drive?
cleaning would be cool though.
is it possible?
