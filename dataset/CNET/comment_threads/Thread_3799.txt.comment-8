Might be worth having a look at a couple of 250/300 Gb h/d's and set them up in raid formation, much easier to replace and recover from a crash than doing it on one drive in sectors.
Also make sure you can access all available USB ports on the motherboard, with a lot of graffics add ons, tablets, printers plotters, etc.
You will need all of them!
