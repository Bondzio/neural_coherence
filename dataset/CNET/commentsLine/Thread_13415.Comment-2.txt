most home networking problems can be boiled down to a few things: 1) bad hardware: including a defective hub/nic/cable.
if the lights on the hub/nics are lit then the hardware is likely good 2) incorrect software settings: a) workgroup names are different, should be the same.
b) file and print sharing is not enabled (more likely with me then xp).
c) xp built in firewall or some other firewall is enabled (likely).
note: switches are better then hubs, give up the make and model of such to verify that's what you have.
