1.1.2	I would appreciate any insight into what you recommend as minimum requirements for Photoshop to run without any delay , and also what system would be a good bargain that fits the same criteria .	St
1.1.3	I would prefer to keep the price under $ 1000 .	St
1.1.4	Thanks all .	St
1.2.1	& quot ; to run without any delay & quot ; But any nice Windows 7 64 bit machine with 4 or more GB RAM may be a fine start .	St
