i forgot to mention that once we install pppoe onto a pc that winsock is forever suspect and may not be supportable or even repairable.
it may interfere with use on a router.
in one extreme case it was not repairable until we reinstalled the os.
we tried but after hours on the phone with microsoft we knew it was time to move on.
