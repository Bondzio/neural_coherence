<s> From what I've looked at so far, I don't see much benefit to these tablet devices (iPad, Xoom, etc.) </s>
<s> The cheapest iPad costs more than a budget laptop while the most expensive models, along with the Xoom cost almost as much as a very nice laptop. </s>
<s> To give examples, a white MacBook costs about $999 and a Dell Inspiron 15R: http://dell.to/hAKxAT costs about $800. </s>
<s> Either of these laptops seem like they can do infinitely more than an iPad, Xoom or anything else and are still fairly portable. </s>
<s> Additionally, for all of the functions that a normal computer cannot meet, it seems like a smartphone does a remarkable job (mobile email in your pocket, GPS capability, etc.) </s>
<s> However, I don't want to completely dismiss them as useless, so I am starting this thread. </s>
<s> For this thread please post the things that a tablet can do better (or do exclusively) than a: smartphone netbook laptop (I am leaving the desktop out because the desktop is not a mobile device) Also, post the things that a tablet cannot do (or does significantly worse) than the following devices: smartphone netbook laptop I'll go first. </s>
<s> Tablet Pros: Smartphone vs: similar applications but a much bigger screen, making on screen keyboards easier to use (as well as making some casual games more fun). </s>
<s> Also better for watching videos and looking at pictures. </s>
<s> It doesn't seem like the battery life for a smartphone is as good as a tablet. </s>
<s> Netbook vs.: very few have built-in GPS capability. </s>
<s> Not as portable as a tablet device, not many have touch screens and the ones that do often aren't as high of quality. </s>
<s> A touchscreen on a netbook is more cumbersome to use. </s>
<s> It probably doesn't have as good of a battery as a tablet. </s>
<s> Laptop vs.: no built-in GPS device, lacks &quot;easy to use&quot; programs like Google Maps (would have to use a browser based version instead). </s>
<s> Unless you have a higher end laptop, the battery life on a tablet is assuredly better. </s>
<s> Tablet Cons: Smartphone vs: Many smartphones perform the same functions that a tablet does, except they are small enough to fit in your pocket, can make phone calls, go into GPS car docks, etc. </s>
<s> Netbook vs.: Incredibly cheaper than a tablet. </s>
<s> Has productivity programs like LibreOffice, OpenOffice and Micrsoft Office easily available (one example of how you can do actual work on one). </s>
<s> Can run most of the programs you would run on a laptop, but the screen is awful tiny for general computing use. </s>
<s> Not many, but some have GPS capability. </s>
<s> Laptop vs.: All your standard PC applications are available. </s>
<s> You can listen to music, watch videos, edit audio and video, use the internet to its full potential, play a commercial video game if your laptop is good enough (not a &quot;play for 15 minutes game&quot; that you see on smartphones and tablets), customize everything on your system to your heart's content. </s>
<s> With a laptop you can do work as well as leisure and be fairly portable. </s>
<s> Perhaps when everyone else posts their pro/con lists I may see more instances in which a tablet device is optimal compared to a smartphone or a netbook/laptop. </s>
<s> I can see the potential for such devices, but in their current form (a suped up smartphone OS, having to use docks to use an actual keyboard) I see them as being mediocre substitutes for a smartphone (has superior portability) and a netbook/laptop (which run full operating systems and have very few restrictions compared to a tablet device). </s>
<s> Is this thread dead? </s>
<s> There are open discussions about the post-PC world. </s>
<s> Many are not ready and your post lead off that you don't get it. </s>
<s> Why would you get one? </s>
