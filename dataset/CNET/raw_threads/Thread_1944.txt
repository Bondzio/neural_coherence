Not knowing exactly what to do, I cleared the cmos and turned it back on. At that point it failed to recognize the both of my Western Digital hard drives. I opened up the computer and changed the arrangement of the IDE cables and turned it back on. Then it worked. But now, when I try to transfer files from one HD to the other, it will start transferring and then stop at about 30% and the &quot;3 minutes remaining&quot; turnes into &quot;5&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;20&quot; and so on. Anyone know what I should do? My friend says to &quot;flash&quot; my bios. -David

What anti-virus and firewall are you using? A problem out of nowhere usually means your hard drive is corrupted and may need to be reformatted. Do you run anti-spyware and/or registry cleaner? I would refrain from downloading new stuff you don't completely understand for a while. I will track this thread until things are figured out. and life goes on... Jack
