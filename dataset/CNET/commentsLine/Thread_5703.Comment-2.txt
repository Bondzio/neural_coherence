ok lets see - b&h is going to be expensive, staples and offices will sometimes have sales or coupons.
i havent found anything on ebay that made sense yet.
the internet ?
i have tried 2 different places and had nothing but problems.
i have an hp 6210 all in one - 1 black and 1 color cart.
soooo i get mine at wal-mart until i find something better, which i hope may come up in answers here :-)) ted
