1.1.1	I recently bought a emachines and was thinking of upgrading the graphics to the x700 pro, when you install the graphics card do you have to disable the onboard graphics first, and i was also wondering if i would notice a difference in upgrading the memory to 1gb, right now it only has 512mb?	St
1.1.2	thanks	Polite
1.2.1	You can do this either in Hardware Manager or in the BIOS.	Ques
1.2.2	Your machine should then use a generic display until you install the new card.	Sug
1.2.3	Also, since 128 MB is dedicated to onboard graphics on the T6212, disabling it will free up the memory so right away you'll have 512 MB.	St
1.2.4	If you do add memory, don't make the mistake I made and do the following; (1) check eMachines website for recommended memory (they recommend Crucial, Kingston, Geil and a few others) and (2) MAKE SURE TO BUY THE MEMORY IN PAIRS.	St
1.2.5	The mistake I made with the T6212 was buying a 1 GB stick.	St
1.2.6	The memory only registered as 1.25 GB instead of the expected 1.5 GB.	St
1.2.7	The documentation tells you this, but who ever reads that stuff?!	St
1.2.8	Good luck!	St
1.3.1	6600GT is rated better than x700 pro.	St
1.3.2	this is fyi.	St
1.3.3	but if u have already done the comparison and decided to go with ati..have fun.	St
