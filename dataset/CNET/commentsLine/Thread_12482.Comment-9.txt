my last desktop was a dell and i just bought an hp at a good price.
truthfully, i've heard horror stories about both companies' tech support, but i've never had a major problem with either.
we have a corporate discount with dell at work, so i know lots of people who have dells.
think when you get a decent one you're ok, but it's hard to get help on a problem of any significance.
btw, my dell machine worked fine but at after a few years needed upgrades that would've knocked a big hole in the cost of a new one.
the few times i've called tech support for dell or hp, it really wasn't about a major issue.
i didn't find them real helpful, but was able to get help elsewhere.
