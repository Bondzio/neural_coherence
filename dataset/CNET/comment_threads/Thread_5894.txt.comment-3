Thanks for the response!
Well what I have now is a LED light with the connectors being 1 + pled and 1 - LED on a green and black wire respectively.
My problem is that the motherboard power led slots are filled.
I'm more or less just wondering if there is another way I could still hook them up.
Possibly with a 3-pin connector?
Were you saying I could hook the + power led up to the red wire of a 3 pin for +5v?
