1.1.1	Hi, - My wireless connection on my laptop gets lost whenever I receive phone call.	St
1.1.2	Do you know the reason?	St
1.1.3	- Also how do you use &quot;PC card&quot; on a desktop computer?	St
1.1.4	Is it just for laptops?	St
1.1.5	I'm planning to add a wirelles adapter to my Desktop PC, specifically &quot;Microsoft MN-730&quot;.	St
1.1.6	Which one do you recommend USB adapter or PCI adapter?	St
1.2.1	I'll bet you $500 that you have a 2.4GHz cordless phone!	St
1.2.2	Move the base and/or handset as far from the router and PC cards as practical, or get a 900MHz, or 5.8GHz model instead.	St
1.2.3	The wi-Fi operates at 2.4GHz.	St
1.3.1	I agree captaincraig, as a 2.4 GHz very definitely interfere with a 802.11b (most common) wireless network, as they both work in the same frequency range.	St
1.3.2	As for the PC Card, it can be used on a desktop, but it requires a special PCI card be installed inside the desktop.	St
1.3.3	As for the Microsoft adapters, either should work equally well.	St
1.3.4	The USB adapter is easier as it's external.	St
1.4.1	Wi-Fi networks work on 2.4 ghz range so if you have a 2.4 ghz phone you will lose the connection because the network and phone will conflict with one another.	St
1.4.2	As for the other things I don't know enough to give you sound advice.	St
