All computers at this location access the Internet wirelessly through an 802.1g wireless router, which is cabled directly to a DSL modem. The wireless network is not encrypted, and frequently interlopers can be found camped-onto my Internet connection. Usually MAC filtering fixes this, but what I would like to do is to log traffic to and from the Internet. Can this be done from the router or by bridging the hard-wired connection between the router and the DSL modem? How difficult can this be? Thanks!

First you need a packet capture program and a PC you can leave running to capture it. Wireshark is your best bet since its free and works very well The harder problem will be getting into the data stream. A old hub if they still make those would work between the router and the dsl modem. They make real ethernet taps but they are rather expensive. The most common way to do this is with a switch that has the ability to &quot;mirror&quot; traffic. You will need a switch is manageable ie 'you can log into'. They are some consumer ones but the cheapest way to buy a old cisco or 3com on ebay. Even the very old switches can do this. You still have the issue of knowing which traffic is valid and which is not. All traffic will appear to come from the address on the router so it will be more difficult to know if it is your traffic or your intruders traffic. To a point it will be obvious if they are visiting sites you do not.
