just my humble opinion... if you want to game, and you want to upgrade, save the time and the money and go buy what you want now.
i just built a 9850be quad on asus for under $1000 (already had dual monitors), overclocked a little and it screams.
not saying your wrong, just something to consider.
shop parts at tom's or newegg... always good deals.
