hi, you don't mention why the client wants a wifi solution.
i would have thought that an e-commerce business of this size would more likely have fixed workstations of some sort, in which case, a wired solution is a no brainer.
it will be faster, more reliable and more secure than a wifi system.
wifi is best suited to mobile configurations but even then, it isn't completely clear cut.
i worked on a project where the project director asked for a wifi solution and at first sight, that seemed appropriate, in that the network was intended to support visits by remote members of the project group.
the director saw the elimination of physical connections to be &quot;a good thing&quot;.
it turned out, however, that these remote visitors tended to work on their laptops on their train journeys to the centre and would typically arrive with depleted batteries.
yes, i know batteries are better these days but they do still get depleted.
so the workstations were equipped with electrical outlets anyway and so providing an rj45 socket as well was trivial.
but there may be some other reason why your client wants/needs wifi.
i know it's more expensive but i'd tend to go for a cisco solution for a true enterprise class solution.
and while the 802.11ac standard hasn't yet been finalized, i've seen &quot;pre-ac&quot; equipment being marketed in the same way that &quot;pre-n&quot; equipment was released in the lead up to confirmation of the final standard.
usually, only a firmware upgrade at worst was needed to comply with the final version of the &quot;n&quot; standard.
you might want to look into that in that ac is dual band by default in countries where use of the 5 ghz band is permitted.
