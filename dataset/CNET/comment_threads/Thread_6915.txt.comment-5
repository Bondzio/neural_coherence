I read a few of the hits I supplied and you can buy the manual from them for about 10 bucks.
It's my choice to share how to find such with a crafty GOOGLE, but just like showing where the water is, I don't fill the water glass and hand it over.
Since it's a gift, the new owner should be chided if they complain about this manual.
Instead, print what's on HP's web site about this printer.
Since hp.com is alive, well and I can find that printer, I leave your work to you.
