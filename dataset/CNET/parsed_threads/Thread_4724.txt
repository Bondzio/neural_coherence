<s> Having problems establishing WPA encryption on wireless network. </s>
<s> Router is Netgear WPN824. </s>
<s> Desktop running XP Media w/SP2 is hardwired and encryption seems to have taken using Netgear Wizard. </s>
<s> Desktop running XP Home w/ SP2 is wireless using Netgear WPN111 USB connection. </s>
<s> Problem: Using Netgear Wizard I tried to enable WPA encryption with code (same as one used on wired desktop). </s>
<s> Wireless computer is active on the network when I start but when I apply the WPA encryption the Wizard goes red and the network drops out. </s>
<s> Seems to be searching for a connection. </s>
<s> I tried applying the encryption with the Windows firewall disabled but it does not take. </s>
<s> (note: I also tried to set up WEP but same problem) Other info: Wireless system uses NSW 2005 Antivirus along with Aluria Adware software. </s>
<s> Any thoughts on what's going on here and how to correct this? </s>
<s> I talked with Netgear and they said drop all firewalls and uninstall the software if necessary. </s>
<s> Call back if any problems. </s>
<s> (Once I get the issue fixed I'll be ready to review Netgear products for all to see) </s>
<s> Had similar issues until I updated my (not a netgear) routers FIRMWARE. </s>
<s> Finally it works proper. </s>

<s> Your wireless WPN111 USB is not compatible with WPA.. Or you need to update your firmware... </s>
<s> Well I had a brain cramp when I set things up. </s>
<s> I did not set the router up for WPA encryption first. </s>
<s> For those interested, here's what I did. </s>
<s> I went to the router (WPN824) setup configuration screen and set up encryption for WPA accessing it through my wired computer. </s>
<s> Funny thing after I did this, the wireless computer dropped out as it wasn't set up for encryption (since I was having problems as previously described). </s>
<s> I then set up the wireless WPN111 USB adapter for WPA encryption and all seems fine now. </s>
<s> Funny how the Netgear tech did not bother to run down the setup sequence and figure this out. </s>
<s> Seems he must have assumed that I set up the router via the wired computer already but that wouldn't have made sense the wireless computer had access without encryption. </s>
