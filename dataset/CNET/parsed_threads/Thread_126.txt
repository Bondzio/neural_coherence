<s> I am trying to extend my signal from my netgear router. </s>
<s> I am actually trying to extend the signal pretty far (let's say 200yds). </s>
<s> I want to reach the garage and I get a signal 3/4 of the way there then nothing. </s>
<s> Is this possible? </s>
<s> I have been reading up on repeaters and it sounds like I could place a repeater compatible with my netgear wireless router at the edge of my signal and extend it. </s>
<s> Is this so? </s>
<s> and if it is how far will it actually extend? </s>
<s> Someone recommeded Netgear WGXB102 54Mbps Wall-Plugged Wireless Range Extender Kit but will this work for extending the signal outdoors? </s>
<s> You can look up CANTENNA on google but even with that there can be no walls or obstacles. </s>
