I also have an ASUS M4A785-M, and a MSI 785GTM-E45. My point and question is this.....what is the difference between an AM3 socket MB and an AM2/AM2+ MB and a MB that will use all 3? Because I need to replace the processor on my ASUS M2N-VM DVI which is a socket AM2/AM2+.My other 2 motherboards will use all 3 socket type processors. I just want to get the best processor the board will use. Any help is greatly appreciated.
