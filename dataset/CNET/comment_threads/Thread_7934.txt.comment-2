The first thing that I would check is the power supply.
Dell desk tops are not noted for their power supplies as I have personally witnessed three of them going bad in the past year.
One of the problems seems to be that Dell sizes them to just carry the load on what they installed and if the owner changes drives or adds a device, often there is not enough spare power supply to carry the load.
Also as a power supply ages, the component parts decay a bit and usurp more power from the load causing failure.
