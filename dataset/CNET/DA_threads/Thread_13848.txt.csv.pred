1.1.1	when i am on the net on some sites i only get the view in the middle third of the screen .	St
1.1.2	on other sites i get a full screen .	St
1.1.3	when i am offline line playing free cell i get a top down stretch of the game .	St
1.1.4	can any one help ?	Ques
1.2.1	If the site is designed for say an 800 x 600 resolution and you have say a 1440 x 900 resolution ( Widescreen ) then you may have some margin space on some sites that hard code how wide the page is , like CNet here but also others .	St
1.2.2	Some windows can be resized and very few sites I 'd imagine allow you to tell the computer what size your window is to allow all of it to be used .	St
1.2.3	So in short , unless you like low resolutions and enjoy those pains , there is n't a solution for you .	St
1.2.4	Regards , JB	St
1.3.1	i thought there was no solution but i asked anyway	St
