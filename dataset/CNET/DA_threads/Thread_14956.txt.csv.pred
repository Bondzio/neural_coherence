1.1.11	Thank you all for your support and suggestions on this matter .	St
1.2.1	For example http : //www.geeks.com/details.asp ? invtid=WGT624NAR & cpc=HPM and even cheaper units are out there with full retail N class units at 99 bucks or less so there is no money in repair and you wo n't pay any counter to test your unit since for less money you get a new wifi router .	St
1.2.2	Does that help ?	Ques
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Yes , Bob , this helps a great deal .	Polite
1.3.2	I just got off the phone with D-Link and since my router is discontinued and end-of-life there is no technical support available for my router since March 1 , 2008 .	St
1.3.3	I would come out way cheaper just to purchase a brand new router and call it a day .	St
1.3.4	It 's not worth my stress level at his point .	St
1.3.5	I did , however , get my money 's worth since it was about 5 years old .	St
