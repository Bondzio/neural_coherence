1.2.1	a video card interface slot, a few other devices use it, but it's essentially the new AGP if your machine doesn't have PCIe you shouldn't even worry (only newer machines have PCIe slots, if you could provide some information about your machine (as the red text suggests) I could tell you if you even have a PCIe slot) in addition to that I would suggest this as a possibility: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814144502	St
