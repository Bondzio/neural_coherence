Did Soyo ever experience this problem?
I have an sy-7vcae p3 mobo that has about 3 with a gentle rise on the top.
They don't look like Marty Feldman's eyes or anything but they are definitely not flat.
No leaking or anything evident and the system seems to work fine, but what I'd like to know is can I just replace them myself and have everything be hunky dory or is there something else I should know?
Should I wait for the system to fail should they really be bad or try to head off more serious damage and try to replace them now?
The board is far out of warranty.
