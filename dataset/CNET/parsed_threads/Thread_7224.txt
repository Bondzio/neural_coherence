<s> Does anyone know how to get a CD out of a RW drive if the CD slide tray will not come out when you push the button? </s>
<s> Straighten a paperclip and insert it into the pinhole on the front of the drive to release the tray manually. </s>
<s> It varies with make or model but here's some pictures of some. </s>
