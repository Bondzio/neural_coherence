Look around in the bios (power section ?) see if you have something like 'wake on lan' 'wake on ring' 'wake on ....something'. I never tested any of these things as I don't use the bios or windows P.M. feature.

I have assumed that it is doing maintenence which is scheduled to be done by the program which you set up to do these things (forgot the name--I don't use the pc much). Check the program list--I think under accessories. &quot;Scheduled Maintenence&quot; or some such.
