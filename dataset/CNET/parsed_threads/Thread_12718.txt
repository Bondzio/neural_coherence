<s> I have an 80 gig hard drive salvaged from a digital video recorder. </s>
<s> Can't seem to use in PC. </s>
<s> It is discovered during bootup but has other than PC Fat file system. </s>
<s> Will not fdisk. </s>
<s> Can this drive be partioned and formatted for a PC. </s>
<s> I've tried a few partitioning programs with this drive as a slave drive. </s>
<s> Any help is appreciated. </s>
<s> in google for a place to download DELPART. </s>
<s> Download it, put it on a floppy and hopefully that will delete all of the partitons of any type of format on the drive. </s>
<s> Many Tivos, Extreme TVs and other DVRs set the drive to a protected mode. </s>
<s> You can google that information, but it takes a special program to unlock it (which I don't have) if DELPART doesn't touch it. </s>
