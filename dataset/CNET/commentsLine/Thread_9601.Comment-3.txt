will staples take epson empties??
office max says that only ink empties with &quot;heads&quot;?
can be recycled.
epsons don't have that configuation.
if staples will take my epsons, i will give them all of my business.
you're right about the fade 'proof'.
only resistant can be expected.
years ago, only epson had long lasting ink.
the old photos printed with my old hp faded within a week, but their newer inks are almost fadeless.
thanks for the response.
