I have a Dell Inspiron 530 (not slim) and the specs are as followed: 2GB Ram Intel Core 2 Quad processor 2.4GHZ Windows 7 Ultimate Intel G33/G31 Express Chipset Family My question is, can I upgrade my power supply in order to get new video cards.
I really play some games.
At least Fallout 3 or something.
If I can upgrade my power supply, then which is best and which is the best Video card to go with it.
