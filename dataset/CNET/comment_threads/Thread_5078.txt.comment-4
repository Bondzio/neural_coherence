i'd say get different RAM leave that mobo just as it is, the Asus one includes audio diagnostics and a far more detailed manual compared to the DFI DFI is also notorious for poor QA (their only an option for extreme tweaking basically) i'd consider possibly a better case (don't quite know it's cooling specifics off the top of my head)
