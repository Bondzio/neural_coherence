I know better than to convert it to NTFS.
Yes it should fix it but since there is no backup the conversion while it works 99.99% of the time is it worth the risk of no backup?
Only you can answer that.
Since I know the risk I won't tell you how to convert.
But you can find out with a google like &quot;Windows XP How to convert to NTFS?&quot; Sorry to hear another no backup story.
These rarely end well.
Need evidence?
Look at entries in this very forum.
