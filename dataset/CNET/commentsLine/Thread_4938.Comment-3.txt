thanks for the reply i have music folders that are huge..like 500 songs per folder and win xp pro locked up some.
so i added 512 mb..problem solved but then i had crashes.
its a custom built machine and i have read reviews about the mother board and people having up to 2 gigs in it without any problems.
what i was wondering is if it might just be some suck ram i have in it.
would you recommend getting that ram thats sold that comes in pairs thats made for dual channel?
thanks
