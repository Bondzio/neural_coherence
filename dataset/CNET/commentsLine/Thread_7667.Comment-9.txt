if you are not aware of it, netstumbler is a great, free, site survey tool.
it will tell you how stong the signal is and it will tell you all of the other networks within range of your wireless card.
it tells you the channel they are using and whether they are encrypted or not.
if you are lucky, you will only see devices on channel 1, 6 or 11. anybody using channels other than this are rookies and need some education on wireless.
this is a more scientific approach to choosing a random channel.
