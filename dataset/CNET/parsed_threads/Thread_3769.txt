<s> Hello I installed a slave drive for backup,but when I restart my computer it does not show up in My Computer every time. </s>
<s> Sometimes it shows up but not always. </s>
<s> I'm afraid to put anything important on here in case I can't access it when I need it. </s>
<s> The Bios has it listed there as a slave drive. </s>
<s> I went into Disk Management and formatted it and assigned it a drive letter,but the next time I turned on my computer it was gone. </s>
<s> I am running XP Home on a desktop Emachines T6216, which is 1 year old. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance of any help you can give me. </s>

<s> Sounds like u have some bad disks in that drive. </s>
<s> Formatting it should fix a corrupted drive. </s>
<s> If you have warranty still, try to get it replaced or something. </s>
<s> Did you check the cable? </s>
<s> I have had the drive checked for bad sectors and get an ok reading.It is a good drive. </s>
<s> yes cable is in and is tight. </s>
