1.1.1	I know that the HD 4870 performs better than the 9800 gtx .	St
1.1.2	I was just wondering if this 9800 gtx ( http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814133220 ) would be able to stand up to it ?	Ques
1.1.3	Does anyone know when HD 4870 's will be shipping again .	St
1.2.1	Should be avilable soon .	St
1.2.2	If not , 9800gtxs are good if only they went down in price even more .	St
1.3.1	What matters is n't so much how one card stands up to another , but how they handle your software .	St
1.3.2	I 've read internet claims that people have the HD4870 already in-hand , but I remember reading that supplies will be limited for at least the next couple weeks .	St
1.3.3	I 've only seen the HD4850 myself ( at local Best Buy for $ 199 ) .	St
1.4.1	the hd 4850 is comparable to a 9800gtx ... that 's why nvidia dropped the price to $ 200 and added the 9800gtx+ for $ 230 .	St
1.4.2	http : //www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.aspx ? i=3341 & p=13 http : //enthusiast.hardocp.com/article.html ? art=MTUyNCw0LCxoZW50aHVzaWFzdA== hd4870s are shipping now but they 're selling out quickly .	St
1.4.3	newegg has the his hd 4870 in stock now but i 'm sure it 'll be gone in an hour or so .	St
