Intel shows.
http://www.intel.com/design/motherbd/sv/ You already have a 4X video card, thus all you would be doing is replacing that with a better one.
Really wonder if a DVI LCD monitor is worth it, depending on what monitor you have now.
You must look inside to see if both memory slots are already populated.
Go to google, search Belarc and also Everest, download both, run them and printout the results, that'll give you all the info that you need.
If hou make a huge increase in the video card, might need a new power supply.
Wonder if any upgradew will provide very much noticeable increase in performance.
