1.4.1	& quot ; The Silverscreen is a sluggish mobile hard drive with a useful entertainment feature -- it plays video and music directly to TV. & quot ; Even the link you supplied noted this .	St
1.4.2	My externals are more of the 200+GB size with 7200RPM drives and quite nice at about 1/2 the dollar .	St
1.4.3	But my do n't connect to the TV .	St
1.4.4	The item they wo n't tell you in this review is that the Video Encoding may be quite inefficient .	St
1.4.5	Let 's take it that it 's about the same as your DVD .	St
1.4.6	That gives this 80GB drive at most 17 movies .	St
1.4.7	Seems like a bad deal to me .	Polite
1.4.8	I 'll share I use something along the same lines , which is the Dlink Media Center .	St
1.4.9	No hard disk and plays movies , music and such .	St
1.4.10	It 's not perfect so read the reviews .	St

1.6.1	I do n't know if this is an option to you , but I plan to buy a 200 Gb high RPM internal HD , place it in an enclosure , and use the USB 2.0 connection from the enclosure as the connector .	St
1.6.2	You 'll save a bundle ( assuming you 're not looking for a highly mobile HD ; this is more of a 'stays in the house ' external HD , I think )	St
1.7.1	I have an hp desktop and I am in the process of getting an apple laptop .	St
