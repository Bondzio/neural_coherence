<s> Hi i'm an incoming freshman thinking of buying a laptop but i can't decide which laptop to buy, the dell D620 or the Apple 13 white inch intel core duo? </s>
<s> Everyone has been advising me to buy mac because the features are great (plus it includes the new iSight), but the problem is...apple laptops are not that user friendly. </s>
<s> Dell on the other hand is very user friendly but it's bigger and heavier than apple. </s>
<s> Both have intel core duo as processors, Please advise me on what laptop should i buy. </s>
<s> thanks! </s>
<s> Have you ever used a Dell? </s>
<s> If so then disregard this, but from my experience Dells are substandard period. </s>
<s> If its not 1 thing its another. </s>
<s> The way they organize & simply operate just doesnt work well for my taste. </s>
<s> I do everything on a computer, from Word to music, to web design, surfing, downloading, etc, & Dells just seem to get in my way. </s>
<s> Go w/ the Apple. </s>
