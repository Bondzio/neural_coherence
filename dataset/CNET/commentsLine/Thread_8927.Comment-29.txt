a few weeks ago i bought the dell 2405fpw 24&quot; widescreen, replacing a 19&quot; viewsonic.
running my fav game battlefield 2 at 1600x1200 and it's awsome, even though native resolution for the 2405 is 1920x1200, just a pitty that bf2 does not support that resolution yet.
it's running through dvi on one box and analog on my old box both at 1920x1200 60hz.
imho widescreens rule!
and the dell 2405 is cheap for what it offers.
