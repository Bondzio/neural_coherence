i would say get a portable computer a xps system is not needed if you want to go dell one of there inpiron systems would do nicely.
they tend to be a bit lower end and a bit less expensive.
if all you granson would be playing is wow then any of todays systems should be fine.
reason why i say portable is because you like to sit at the couch and and be on the computer.
