When I plugged a gadget in the USB drive (tried all 3 drives) it says that the USB drive is low-powered. I have tried a usb hub with a y-cable, a usb hub with external power and a usb 2.0 pcmcia card and it doesn't work. I checked and the usb port is 2.0. Is there anything I can do to make it high-powered? Can I change the USB Controller? Any advice greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

They said there was nothing wrong with the machine and therefore, no exchange allowed. Other techies I spoke to lectured me at length for wasting money on an Acer.

There are low speed messages and a power message but not a message as presented. Sorry, but something is a little off here and it helps to use the same words as the message. Bob

The message when I plugged in the gadget was &quot;You have a low powered USB machine. Please contact your technician for assistance&quot;. Thanks in advance for any assistance you can give.

I think I'll just sell the darn machine, esp. since I have a buyer who is aware of the problem and for some strange reason, is still eager to buy the Acer. My next machine will definitely not be an Acer!
