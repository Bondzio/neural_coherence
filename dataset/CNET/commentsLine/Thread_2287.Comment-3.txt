more ram well make the biggest different, you need to check how much ram your machine can take and try to match it.
this well make the biggest difference.
how big of hard drive do you have?
this would slow you down some, but nobody should need to defrag every week unless you are installing and uninstall a lot of programs.
that would just be overkill.
when you defrag click the &quot;analyze&quot; button, if xp says you need to defrag then do it, if not don't.
