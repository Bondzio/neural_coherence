<s> Hello, i just built this, and will be using it for gaming. </s>
<s> I want to know that this would be compatible and be able to run most games like Arma 3 on high! </s>
<s> I will be getting this in about 2 months! </s>
<s> http://pcpartpicker.com/p/10xmF Open for suggestions, thanks! </s>
<s> re the RAM. </s>
<s> If I were looking to buy right now, I'd pick RAM with good ratings and more buyer reviews. </s>

<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I edited it, here http://pcpartpicker.com/p/10AeV What do you mean, backing it up? </s>
<s> Like os? </s>
<s> data or your system if your only just HDD dies ? </s>
<s> Now's a good time to plan for that contingency. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> So i should like buy 2? </s>
<s> HDD is strictly backup for the primary drive. </s>
<s> In the event the primary drive dies, I replace it and use the data from the backup on the 2nd HDD to restore a full working image to the new primary HDD. </s>
<s> Then I wipe the original drive and send it for warranty replacement. </s>
<s> Fast and easy. </s>
<s> Beats the heck out of finding all the installation discs, the serial numbers, reloading all the SW, setting preferences, etc., makes me tired just thinking of it. </s>
<s> VAPCMD PS..Good choice on the RAM ! </s>
