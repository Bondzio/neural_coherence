you can follow the steps at this link (printer friendly page icon at the bottom that takes out background graphics) for a slave drive.
simple stuff since the drive is empty.
the speed of the drives won't be a factor just because one is larger than the other so i would recommend leaving the 40gb drive as the master with the new drive as the slave rather than trying to copy one drive to the other and then have to switch the positioning.
the instructions here are for w98/me using fat32 and if that's what you have on the master 40gb drive, you will have to partition and format the drive separately as seen in the pictures in the link.
this will prepare the drive for data.
if you have xp, it will partition and format it for you by using the disk management program.
