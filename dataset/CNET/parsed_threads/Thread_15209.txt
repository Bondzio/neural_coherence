<s> I imagine that a similar situation to this has happened before, but I could not locate the thread. </s>
<s> At the moment, my HP Pavilion a1020n desktop, running on XP SP2, will not even initiate startup. </s>
<s> I have disconnected all cables and reconnected the power cord. </s>
<s> When I do this, a green light on the back of the tower comes on indicating that power is being received to the unit. </s>
<s> However, when I depress the start button, nothing happens except the green light goes out. </s>
<s> No attempts to start up, no fan, nothing. </s>
<s> If I depress the start button for about 5 seconds, the green light on then back comes back on, but that's it. </s>
<s> During the night, there was some sort of power surge. </s>
<s> The computer was plugged into a power strip. </s>
<s> All other periferals are working fine. </s>
<s> I am not sure if there was a surge in the area/house or if something within the computer created the surge. </s>
<s> I did call HP and they had me reseat the RAM. </s>
<s> This produced no results. </s>
<s> They then told me if I sent the tower to them, they could repair it for $250-300, plus shipping. </s>
<s> I don't think so. </s>
<s> I know that you all can help me out and greatly appreciate it. </s>
<s> ..and they suggest getting a new power supply. </s>
<s> Does this sound like the first thing to do? </s>
<s> Keep in mind that the green light on the back of the computer comes on but it simply will not do anything when I depress the start button. </s>
<s> I do find it interesting that the surge protector seemed to protect everything but the computer, unless the computer initiated the surge. </s>
<s> At which point I am surprised that surge went throughout the house. </s>
<s> BTW, there were no lightening storms, etc. </s>
<s> If you had a power surge many things in the computer could have been messed up. </s>
<s> If i was in your postion i would try a new PSU if that does'nt work then there could be to much to troubleshooting so i would just send it to HP. </s>
<s> Also if they said to try the memory also try to the video card. </s>
<s> If you have a PCI, AGP, PCI express remove it and use the on-board. </s>
<s> If you are using the on-board see if you can get a cheap video card and try it. </s>
<s> -sai </s>
<s> Thanks sai. </s>
<s> CompUSA has a great price on a PSU. </s>
<s> I will pick that up tomorrow and give it a try. </s>
<s> I am very surprised that issues as seemingly unrelated as a video card can prevent the computer from even turning on. </s>
<s> While events suchs as this cause great concern for me, I also learn so much more about computers, primarily due to the advice on this board. </s>
<s> I have a AMD 2500+ with a XP pro opp. </s>
<s> system. </s>
<s> The other day i turned on my computer and it didnt work. </s>
<s> I then pressed the reset button 2 or 3 times and then it worked, a little slow but it worked. </s>
<s> the next day i stopped working again. </s>
<s> what it does is it boots up until the screen that says windows did not shut down prop. </s>
<s> and to select one of the following to start your windows system. </s>
<s> after i select a start up method it stops. </s>
<s> If i restart my computer i can get into the system settings, and i can also get into the BIOS meun. </s>
<s> In the BIOS meun i select boot from cd rom. </s>
<s> and i put in the xp cd.and i starts to set up, and then it stops befor it finishes the set up. </s>
<s> so now im stuck. </s>
<s> my best guess is that my processer is burned out. </s>
<s> so can anybody help me? </s>
<s> Many things could be causing you not to be able to work your computer fully. </s>
<s> Most likely it is the CPU or it could be your PSU check the temp. </s>
<s> that your computer is running at in the BIOS if it's running hot try cleaning out the fans (Really your PSU fan). </s>
<s> NIL </s>

<s> My comp is not booting to windows, there is no periferals that are wotking and the motherboard has a led light on it that lights up and the fans kick in but thats it. </s>
