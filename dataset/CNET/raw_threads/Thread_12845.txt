Ok so i bought a sata hd as a backup dive, and at first xp recognized it. But i got an error half way though formatting the sata and since then xp will not recognized it.And don't say disk management because that the typical solution I keep finding except for the fact that it doesn't show in disk management. Any idea's people ?? system is - Amd athlon 3200+ 64 bit , msi RS482m4 mother board, 1.5 gigs of ram , with a ide main hd and the sata is a WD Caviar Black
