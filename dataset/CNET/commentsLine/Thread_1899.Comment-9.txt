as i said in my original post, i contacted belkin.
their only suggestion was a firmware update.
which was available, so i updated.
the result has been; no change.
the previous router was a belkin, also.
maybe i ought to get a cisco or something.
frankly, i suspect the industry just doesn't care if they produce junk.
they know we'll buy it and after the sale, it's all on the consumer.
probably, if i spent big bucks, i'd be able to get a good router.
we never had this issue where i worked.
but i'll bet they spent thousands on hardware.
i'm not that much of a high-roller.
i've been through the book for my router.
it doesn't even suggest such a failure might be possible.
i've looked at all of the settings and read all of the &quot;what's this&quot; pop-ups.
i'm stumped.
my hope was that someone on this forum could suggest a real solution.
i guess not.
