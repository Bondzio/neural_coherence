<s> Hi, I have an oldish Linksys BEFSR41 router. </s>
<s> However it keeps killing the connection to all computers, requiring power down of modem and router (plugging the modem right into my computer works fine). </s>
<s> I've tried troubleshooting the router and I'm fed up, its time for a new networking solution. </s>
<s> I've been using wired but I'm wondering if I should change to wireless? </s>
<s> How reliable are the wireless routers, and the wireless cards I presumably would have to buy for each desktop I want to give an internet connection? </s>
<s> Any recommendations? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I really like the Linksys router + AP. </s>
<s> I would stay away from anything that says &quot;Pre N&quot;. </s>
<s> The G stuff works well and it is cheap. </s>
<s> And using WPA with a properly long key makes your network very secure. </s>

<s> You said you tried to troubleshoot the router but did you update the firmware? </s>
<s> If not I bet you'll have trouble with a new router since my experience is they don't ship with the latest. </s>
<s> Also, there is some issue with a specific ISP and some routers. </s>
<s> But without clues I forget what that was. </s>
