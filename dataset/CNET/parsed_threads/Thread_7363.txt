<s> The Apple specs state that we have a &quot;combined optical digital output/headphone out (minijack)&quot; on the side, and we would like to connect our mbp to our stereo receiver so we can play music through our (new) ceiling speakers. </s>
<s> We would appreciate any help from anyone who has actually done this and knows the best method. </s>
<s> If you could also please include the name(s) of any hardware/cables that should be used, we would appreciate that as well. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Assuming that it has regular RCA input connections, you will need an adapter to convert RCA to 3.5mm mini-jack On this converter, the RCA ends (left and right) should be Male while the 3.5mm mini-jack end should be female You will also need a cable with a male mini-jack on both ends. </s>
<s> The length of this will depend on the distance between your laptop and the stereo. </s>
<s> Just plug it all in and select that input on the receiver. </s>
<s> If it has a Optical input, then an optical cable between the laptop and the receiver is all you need. </s>
<s> Once again, select that port on the receiver. </s>
<s> Take a look at monoprice.com for all these cables and converters P </s>
