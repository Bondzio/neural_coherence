Someone may have posted a question similar to mine, but as I said in my post, I could not tell by the Subject Title (Well, perhaps one post was close, but nobody provided any answers).
Perhaps if I open tons of posts I will come across a similar thread.
Do you know of any particular threads I could review?
Meanwhile, I will keep an eye out for references to Acronis and open those up.
As to your second comment, I'm only using two partitions because for now I only want to be able to clone each computer's hard drive contents into their own partition.
(BTW, the two computers are not set up to mirror each other and are not otherwised synched in any way, as they each have completely different file contents).
Thank you for responding.
