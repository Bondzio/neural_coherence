from dong ngo's review (november 7, 2008): &quot;if you plan to have a wireless network in a neighborhood that doesn't already have too many wireless signals, we would recommend the belkin n+ over any other wireless-n routers.&quot;  but... how can you know how many wireless signals are in the neighborhood?
and how many are too many?
