<s> OK...I have a tough one. </s>
<s> I read the review of the Dell Studio XPS here: http://reviews.cnet.com/desktops/dell-studio-xps/4505-3118_7-33396858.html?tag=mncol;lst It is sweet. </s>
<s> I bought it and realized that the keyboard included in the picture is not the one that my system is shipping with. </s>
<s> Nobody at Dell seemed to know what it was either...they looked at the pic on CNET. </s>
<s> If you zoom in, it is a Dell-branded item and it appears to have a cord. </s>
<s> I love that low-profile look and I want it but I don't know what the heck it is! </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> If it is what I am thinking, it is a standard 101 or 102 key board. </s>
<s> But this particular board is a bit thiner, more narrow and less wide. </s>
<s> It is of simple rectangular design, and the keys a bit smaller in over-all design. </s>
<s> It seems Dell has been including this smaller keyboard with lower end products for a couple of years now. </s>
<s> Probably just for over-all product and shipping costs savings. </s>
<s> The System Information probably doesn't identify it as anything other than generic 101/102 standard keyboard. </s>
<s> If you have this system, Belarc Adviser may be able to ID it a little more thoroughly. </s>
<s> Charlie </s>
<s> Charlie, That is a good description....very accurate indeeed. </s>
<s> I went on the Dell site and it doesn't appear to be included in any of their systems. </s>
<s> If you search for all keyboards (there are a ton of them) it isn't to be found there either...I went through all of them. </s>
<s> I just want to find it! </s>
<s> Thanks, Peter </s>
<s> ... and you're right. </s>
<s> It is terrific. </s>
<s> I just got it with my Inspiron 518 a month ago and I was surprised by it. </s>
<s> It is not a standard keyboard; it's a multimedia keyboard and it has the touch of an Apple keyboard. </s>
<s> I wish I could tell you more, but you're right in that you can't configure it online. </s>
<s> Mine came with a PC that I bought at a third party vendor. </s>

<s> ... And at $20, it's a steal! </s>
<s> It's extremely well made and it's the most comfortable keyboard I've used in a long while, though the relative flatness of it (compared to the other keyboards I use) took some getting used to. </s>
