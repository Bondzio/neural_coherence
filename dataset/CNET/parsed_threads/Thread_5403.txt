<s> i know wow will play fine on a macbook pro, but i am curious how well it plays on a lower level macbook. </s>
<s> has anyone had any experience with this? </s>
<s> i know Veronica the Adoreable on the Buzz Out Loud podcast was going to look into it, but i haven't heard anything solid about the gaming performance of the macbook. </s>
<s> obviously i know the macbook pro is the better way to go, i just dont want to shell out the $2500 for one if i dont need to. </s>
<s> thanx:) </s>
<s> I think what with the specifications on the MacBook it's not a very graphically intensive machine like the MacBook Pro. </s>
<s> However, we can wait to see the results from Veronia. </s>
<s> Or we can say that since on the Apple website it states that it can run games but not graphically intensive games (go into software and games) like the Pro. </s>
<s> Sorry but no luck on WoW I think. </s>
<s> I'm sure WoW will be fine on the MacBook, considering that: a) It's Intel native; b) It's not the most graphically intensive game out there; c) It runs well enough on my 2.5 year old iBook G4 (800 Mhz) d) Runs great on 2x1.8 GHz PowerMac G5 I'd save the cash. </s>
