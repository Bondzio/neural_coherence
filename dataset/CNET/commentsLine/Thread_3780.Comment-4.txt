microsoft only supplied the os.
if you formatted the system, then drivers for motherboard, usb and more need to be found and installed for your system.
also xp doesn't get usb 2.0 support till xp sp1 and even then there can be issues.
most usb 2.0 drives would behave just like you wrote in your first post... as it stands you have an incomplete os install from what i can tell.
-&gt; but you didn't read the forum tip so this is all i can tell you.
i can't point to possible drivers you might need.
best of luck, bob
