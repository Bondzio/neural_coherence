I am going to network a laptop with XP Home and a desktop with XP Pro (through a router).
I plan to buy an external hard drive (probably Western Digital Passport) to be the central place where all the files are for both machines to access.
I also want the laptop and hard drive to be mobile so I can take it out of the office and still access and use my files.
What I'm trying to figure out is if my laptop with XP Home (which doesn't have encryption capabilities) will be able to open/view/edit a file from my external drive that does have encryption.
Also, am I right to assume I can network XP Home through a router?
