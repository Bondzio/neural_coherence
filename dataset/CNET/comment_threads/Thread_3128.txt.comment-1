I have an MSI 865PE Neo2-FIS2R motherboard, and I'm attempting to rebuild it with a new SATA drive.
XP won't find the HD, so I'm assuming XP doesn't have them built in.
I've searched for SATA drivers fro this board, but I'm not having much luck.
I'd like to slip stream the drivers and move on.
I'll get the slip strea figured out - I just need assistance locating the driver.
Thanks in advance.
