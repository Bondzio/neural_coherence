<s> Hi, One of my computers is a HP Pavilion 522n. </s>
<s> I installed a FireWire PCI adapter for my DVD burner and the BIOS cannot detect it, even Windows does not. </s>
<s> Does this computer support FireWire? </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> Can detect firewire drives in the BIOS. </s>
<s> So few let's just say it's not a feature of today's PCs. </s>
<s> However, Apple does make such things that will see such. </s>
<s> But you don't have an Apple. </s>

<s> Hi, Thanks for your response. </s>
<s> Finally this kind of MB does not have the option of USB/FireWire in the BIOS. </s>
<s> Means the BIOS cannot detect the DVD burner from the FireWire port. </s>
<s> You are forgetting about how the classic PC works or the history from the original to how it is today. </s>
<s> You seem to be expecting something that is and was never a feature of your classic PC. </s>
<s> Tell more why you expected this to be found in the BIOS. </s>
<s> I read your post and see no question. </s>
<s> End your question with a question mark next time. </s>

<s> Means the BIOS cannot detect the DVD burner from the FireWire port.&quot; There is no question here. </s>
<s> As to your first post, almost NO PCs made will do this. </s>
<s> It's not a feature of most PCs so nothing busted. </s>
<s> Did you need a history lesson on the Personal Computer? </s>

<s> the BIOS cannot detect it, ... </s>
<s> Does this computer support FireWire? </s>
<s> Not from the BIOS view. </s>
<s> Almost NO PC made would list what's plugged into the firewire cards from the BIOS. </s>
<s> Does this help? </s>
