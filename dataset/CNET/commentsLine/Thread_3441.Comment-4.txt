i don't have the discs of the driver.
search the service tag on dell website brings up nothing to download from (not a single driver).
where can i get it then?
also, i believe the board is what makes the difference.
using software like everest, i know that the board is intel with 865gv chipset.
so i go to intel website to get the lastest driver.
all the drivers work perfectly except for the ac97 which cause bsod on installation.
what should i do next?
