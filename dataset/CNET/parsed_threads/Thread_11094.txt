<s> Alright, I have 2 questions but I thought it better, being as how they are sort of related. </s>
<s> The first is about dual monitors, more specifically would they work on my machine and how. </s>
<s> My Graphics card is a Nvidia Geforce 560 Ti, I can't see anywhere else where I could connect the second monitor though, is there any other information you need to know or is that it? </s>
<s> Second is another connectivity quesiton: I want to upgrade my Headphones and really like the look of (being a gamer and a musician/enthusiast) the Razer Tiamat 7.1, I just want to know if they will also work on my computer, What sort of connection do I need? </s>
<s> how many Input jacks? </s>
<s> Any help on either of these is GREATLY appreciated... </s>
<s> I can't see which one you have so I can't check if you can plug in a second monitor. </s>
<s> Also, I can't find what monitors you have. </s>
<s> As to the headphone, I see it requires a 7.1 soundcard. </s>
<s> http://www.razerzone.com/tiamat/en/soundcards So until we see if your PC has such a card, I have to write it's a no-go. </s>

<s> The PC is bought from Mesh Computers (online) it said when I purchased it that it had Intergrated 7.1 surround sound, I'm not sure if this is suitable or not... And is there any images of the types of connection I would need for both screen and Headphones? </s>
<s> It would be a little difficult to get a decent image of the back of my PC atm... thanks for the quick reply by the way </s>
<s> But no. </s>
<s> I can't see any added detail in your reply I can use. </s>
<s> If Mesh says it has 7.1 then it's up to you to check that out. </s>
<s> I can't do this for you given the lack of detail. </s>
<s> The link I gave did supply other cards if the unit Mesh used is not up to the task. </s>
