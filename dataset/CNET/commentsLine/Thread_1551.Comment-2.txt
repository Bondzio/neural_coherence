i suggest you get your hands on this magazine; pc gamer.
inside will be systems offered which in most cases are tailored for gaming usage.
these are more likely to fall into a happy medium for you.
you can then checkout the websites of interested systems and proceed from there with specs and so on, but be sure to read the warranty issues as gaming systems tend to push the envelope.
good luck -----willy
