Speed_Bump: Have you deleted the temporary internet files and cookies?
Also clean out the C:\Windows\Temp folder.
I recently saw one that had more than 26,000 temp.
internet files.
It could hardly run at all.
It took more than 30 minutes for the machine to delete these files.
Afterward, it ran just fine.
Best of Luck
