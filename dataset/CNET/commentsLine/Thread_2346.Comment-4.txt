is the 5 port swith a router also?
if is it then you won't have to buy a round and you would disregard the second nic card and connect the dsl directly to the switch and run ur network and share the internet thru that if now,then i would suggest buying a rounter to make things simple.
you can also set the net on pc a then run the xp network wizard on pc a with internet sharing then run the network wizard on pc b telling it to get net access from pc a.
*** do not foget on to distinguish the nic cards on pc a properly 1 would be for the net and the other for the network with internet sharing enabled.
good luck
