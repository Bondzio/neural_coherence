I have a Compaq nc6000 laptop running XP2.
Devices (all of which don't work right with it regularly) - Adesso Keyboard/touchpad mouse combo, WKB 4000US.
- Kensington wireless mouse (Pilot Mouse Laser Wireless Pro, model M01006) (might conflict with Adesso since that has touchpad mouse, but even if I skip the Kensington or disable its mousepad in Device Manager, still Adesso has issues) - Palm Z22, synced via mini-USB cable - Skype converter to allow conversation on regular phone (Yealink B2K Skype RJ11-USB Phone Adapter) When I hook devices to the PC - even if just keyboard - devices aren't detected, don't install right, or if device does chance to work (after plug/unplug from different USB ports for 45 minutes at random), then the PC's sound goes out, so no music.
All devices work sometimes if I plug/unplug enough, but many seem to kill the PC's sound, and I can never get all devices to stay working.
I assume it's due to IRQ conflicts or some such, but all I know of IRQ is the name, basic concept, not how to see or control which IRQ the sound card or a USB device uses.
How to troubleshoot?
Many thanks!
