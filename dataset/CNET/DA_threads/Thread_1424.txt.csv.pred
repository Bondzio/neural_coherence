St
1.1.4	It sometimes appears under disks in device manager and a USB mass storage device under USB I can also change the drive from performance to quick remove in the device properties Solutions I've tried Lying it on various sides, apparently that was a fix elsewhere Different USB cables, though no new ones but the symptons are the same and I can't believe that 3 cables would all have the same problem Any help or forum pointer would be amazing.	St
1.1.5	I'm currently volunteering in Tanzania with no local expertises, slow internet connection and limited funds, but I need to get some important research papers off the drive and am considering paying for data recovery.	St
