hello, i just burned a dvd (with a bunch of pictures) on my pc, then put the dvd into my mac g4.
mac won't open it.
it won't recognize it.
then i put another dvd with some files on it, also burned on my pc.
same thing.
when i put a picture cd (from ritz camera) it opens it just fine.
when i put a dvd movie it opens it fine.
is it possible that this problem comes from the fact that these dvds were burned on the pc?
thanks a lot!
exp.
