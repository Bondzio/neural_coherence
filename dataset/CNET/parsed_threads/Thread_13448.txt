<s> Two things come to mind, the bios setting or use an adapter. </s>
<s> If the bios has no setting to disable the fan alarm(check alarm/setting) then use a power harness adapter to attach to the original fan connection then to new fan or get a true compatible fan replacement with proper plug-in. </s>
