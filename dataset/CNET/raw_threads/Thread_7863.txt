I have tried EASYRECOVERY PROFESSIONAL and it says there's no file system on it: the rapid SMART TEST shows the drive passes the test; so i tried the raw data recovery option, but after 5 minutes i get an error message and the drive starts clicking, so i stopped it immediately. I tried R-Studio and it too sees the drive with no file system, attempts a RAW recovery but there again after 5 minutes the drive starts to click and i stop it . Now, i boot from UBUNTU CD , UBUNTU RESCUE REMIX or even KNOPPIX, and none of them sees the drive !!! Any idea how to get my data back ??

The best way to get your data back is from your backup. The second best way is by paying a data recovery company. With disks that fail mechanically, as appears to be the case with this one, that's quite expensive. Kees

I've just downloaded the Samsung utility test and it passed with flying colors all the tests: READ DMA SPIN DOWN/UP CHECK SMART SIMPLE SURFACE SCAN WRITE VERIFY RANDOM SURFACE SCAN RAM VERIFY TEST MULTIPLE READ TEST &quot; YOUR DD HAS NO ERROR !&quot; it says... &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

But: - it's unpartitioned (RAW) - recovery stops after 5 minutes If you trust that diagnostic, you simply repartition it, loose all your data and hope for the best. But you said you want to recover your data, so maybe that wouldn't be your preferred idea. All I can offer: try the other recovery programs from http://forums.cnet.com/7723-7588_102-354911.html Maybe one works. Maybe none work. You'll only know when you try. Kees
