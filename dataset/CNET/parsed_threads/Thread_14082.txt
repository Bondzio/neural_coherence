<s> I have an external drive which I bought with a notebook 8 years ago; connects via ieee-1394 and worked great for many years. </s>
<s> Last year I bought a new PC with XP. </s>
<s> It had no ieee ports, so I bought and installed a card. </s>
<s> Worked great for getting all the old stuff into the new PC. </s>
<s> Since the new PC has lots of space, I put away the ext. </s>
<s> drive for several months after the new machine was set up. </s>
<s> Now I have a use for the ext. </s>
<s> drive again, but XP will no longer recognize it. </s>
<s> I even ran the &quot;helper cd&quot; and tried restarting with the drive on, have tried all the ports, and nothing -- XP cannot or will not find or detect the ext. </s>
<s> drive. </s>
<s> What happened? </s>
<s> Is there any trick I can try in order to be able to use the ext. </s>
<s> drive again? </s>
<s> Also, is there such a thing as a simple and reliable IEEE-1394/USB adapter? </s>
<s> No there is no such USB to ieee 1393 device. </s>
<s> Yes, there is a call for such a thing but if you do your research you find out why there is none. </s>
<s> For very little you can put the hard drive into some USB enclosure (less than the cost of that firewire adapter?) </s>
<s> and get it done. </s>
