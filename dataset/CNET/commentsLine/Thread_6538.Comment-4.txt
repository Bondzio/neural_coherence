thanks for the help!
well just to follow up on what i did in the end: i moved the wireless router, and got an cat5 extention so the second computer and the xbox were wired, while the first computer recieved internet wirelessly.
everything was working fine - until - i went to the next step of my wireless journey - security.
i decided to use the wpa-psk method of security.
after installing it, everything seemed to be working fine..except when i started msn messenger.
for some reason, when i have wpa-psk activated, signing onto msn causes the wireless signal to disconnect.
everything else works, (internet explorer ect.
), just msn doesn't.
after turing off security, everything went back to normal.
any ideas on what the problem could be?
.. thanks in advance!
