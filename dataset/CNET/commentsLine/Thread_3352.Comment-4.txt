the 12 volts that is now used to provide power to the cpu's regulators.
the mobo manual should describe what the other pins/sockets are for.
i'm not certain what the connector next to the 4 pin connector is for, the one that you say is 4 pin rectangular.
i assume that you have sata connections, and newer power supplies all seem to supply a few power connections for sata drives.
