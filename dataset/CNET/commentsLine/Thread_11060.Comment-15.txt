all my peripherals worked with win7, 3 printers, an older hp laserjet, epson wide format inkjet, a canon inkjet.
also found drivers for an old epson scanner.
the best part, i turned everything on before install and win7 found them all, one worked with vista 64bit driver.
even an 11 year old program that wouldn't install with vista, works fine with win7.
win7 the best upgrade yet.
