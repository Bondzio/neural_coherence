well seeing as how i'm a tech and small computer business owner my tendancy, especially in u.s. dollars (i'm canadian) would be to say that you could get yourself a kick @ss gaming system for that kind of dough, with a 8ms response time monitor.
a word of caution, going with anything larger than 19&quot; in an lcd with a decent reponse time (12ms or under, preferably 8ms) is going to cost you dearly.
as for the system, if you're adventurous and want to put it together yourself, a high end gaming system with amd processor and dual sli nividia video cards could be in your future.
good luck.
