<s> Hi all, I will start with describing the situation: 1) I have WiFi connection and local network installed. </s>
<s> 2) I can connect my laptop (and other devices) via WiFi to the network and browse the local network as well as the internet. </s>
<s> 3) I have two other desktops that are wired (connected via wire) to the network and works fine (can get to the internet) The problem: ~~~~~~~~~~~~ I conneced one additional desktop to my home network via WiFi and I can browse the local network but I CANNOT CONNECT TO THE INTERNET Do you have any idea what can be the problem? </s>
<s> (I already reinstalled the computer and restarted the wireless router) Thanks for any idea.... Shai </s>
<s> - Does it work wired? </s>
<s> You only tell about wireless. </s>
<s> - What exactly is &quot;reinstalling the computer&quot;? </s>
<s> -] What happens if you try to &quot;connect to the Internet&quot; and how do you do that? </s>
<s> For example, can you ping a website? </s>
<s> - What OS on this desktop? </s>
<s> Windows 95? </s>
<s> Linux? </s>
<s> Speaking of Linux, does it work if you boot from a Linux Live disk? </s>
<s> - Now take that same uncooperative desktop to another location (friend or family). </s>
<s> Does it work there wired? </s>
<s> Wireless? </s>
