practically any card can handle cd-audio nowadays and likewise, youtube and streaming music audio isn't as good as cd-audio.
so for those audio sources, there's not much difference.
if you're using audio rates of 96khz+ or need lots of simultaneous voices or digital signal processing, then you'll need a better card and which card depends on your use.
