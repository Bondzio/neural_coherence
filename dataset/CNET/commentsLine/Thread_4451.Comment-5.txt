hi confed, i am a printer engineer, and think that your office kit needs calibrating... the output is usually pretty good.
i don't like canon inkjets, partly because if there is a quality problem and you remove the ink cartridge, it can take up to 10 cleaning cycles (with the wastage that entails) to get it to print again.
i much prefer hp or lexmark.
bear in mind that due to the nature of my job i only see the problem kit, and i see far more canons...
