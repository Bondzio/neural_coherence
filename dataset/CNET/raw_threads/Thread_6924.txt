I'm running a EPOX EP-9NDA3J with a Athlon XP 4000 64bit along with 2 gigs of OCS ram and a XF 7800 GS. I'm heavily into gaming. So now, if I purchase a Athlon XP 64 x2 3800, would I benefit at all or would I loose power. If not the 3800, what about the 4200, 4400 or 4800-which is rare, and prices are through the roof for socket 939 boards. Any advice would help. Thanks.

The results I see is better gameplay. But since you are not increasing the core's speed the payoff here is minimal. Bob

And getting the dual 4200 would't be enough to see a difference. So I'm pretty much stuck with my current CPU. I was trying to hold out on the major upgrade. I'd love a x2 4800 but prices are outrageous! $350 plus!

For instance the time rendering a DVD is nearly cut in half when I use such am upgraded machine. You should get some boost since you'll have at least one core's full attention to the game and the other would be handling the OS chores. That's my experience so far. Bob

They offer a number of dual core processors that you could look at...the 165, 170, 175, 180 and 185( see links below...don't think you'll be disappointed) http://www.amdcompare.com/us-en/opteron/ Readily available at Newegg...the 185 is $235 http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=2+50001028+40000343+1050706979+1051707439+1302820275&name=Dual-Core
