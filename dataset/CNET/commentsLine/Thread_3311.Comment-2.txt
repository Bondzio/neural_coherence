did you notice that amd has 64 bit processors.
next year they come out with 64 bit dual processors.
as for memory the difference between 400 and 500mhz is nothing.
never skimp on memory.
why only 512mb.
get amd and put 3 gigs of ram in.
use your computer now and go to  and look at comparisons.
nothing but amd blowing you away.
besides the processor the most important things are memory and harddrives for speed.
look at the sata 10,000 rpm drives.
also next year they come out with a new operating system from microsoft called longhorn.
just think about what you will be missing out on a year from now.
think about it.
