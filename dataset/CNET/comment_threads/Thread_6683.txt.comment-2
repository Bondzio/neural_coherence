The drive comes with instructions.
But here's a pictorial on the steps -&gt; http://www.pcnineoneone.com/howto/cdts1.html 2. what is &quot;firmware&quot; Google answers that one well -&gt; http://www.google.com/search?&q=what+is+firmware 3. and why does it need to be upgraded??
In the manufactures mad rush to get product in production they will use buggy firmware, produce the boatload of drives and place them on the ship for your consumption.
Along the way, the bug is uncovered and the programmer is fed more coca-cola and chocolate bars until the firmware with the fix appears on the makers web site.
