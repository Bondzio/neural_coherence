<s> I have a Dell 19&quot; Ultra Sharp flat panel LCD monitor and it's the best part of my system. </s>
<s> Thank you but I really don't want a wide screen unless somebody can tell me why it would be better for me than a normal monitor. </s>
<s> Been looking around and this seems to be a good value, have had good luck with my LG plasma and my cell phone is also an LG thats has treated me well. </s>

<s> Got it hooked up and it seems to be really nice, I just hope it lasts longer then that junk Samsung. </s>
<s> Check out the new lgs and samsungs out. </s>
<s> You can find them at Best Buy and Circuit City. </s>
<s> Most will have 5m response time and 2000 to 3000 contrast ratio. </s>
<s> They will also have a 3 year warr. </s>
<s> The 19&quot; will run between 200 and 300. </s>
<s> I am also thinking of purchasing a new LCD and this one...despite CNET's dismal rating on it has received great reviews elsewhere. </s>

<s> Consumer Reports </s>
<s> http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2418924&CatId=170 My dad has one & a friend of mine has had 2 of them (he sold one to someone who needed one badly & bought another one). </s>
<s> They have a full 3 year warranty & the price is excellent. </s>
<s> There have been zero problems with them & they work great. </s>
<s> I hope this helps. </s>
<s> From my experience you cannot go wrong with an &quot;ACER&quot;. </s>
<s> 3 YR. Warranty, durable, all around great monitors for the money. </s>
<s> If you have unlimited funds, yes there are better. </s>
<s> But TigerDirect.com has a 19&quot; ACER for $159.00 and no rebates right now. </s>
<s> Wide screens are the new format. </s>
<s> Many people are now getting them. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> You can see more of a document, especially a spreadsheet in landscape mode. </s>
<s> You may even be able to have a couple of documents open side by side. </s>
<s> It's almost like having two monitors. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> HDTV is wide screen. </s>
<s> If you get an HDTV tuner you could watch HDTV on it. </s>
<s> Playing back DVDs would be in the right format. </s>
<s> Any other HD input would look better, like maybe a cable HD receiver or DVR. </s>
<s> So basically, getting a wide screen allows more flexibility in the modern world. </s>
<s> Disadvantages. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Depending on resolution, the same size regular screen would show more of a document or web page vertically. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> They're cheaper. </s>
<s> I recently purchased an LG L1960TR and I'm glad I did. </s>
<s> It has no defective pixels, a 3 year warranty, and came with both VGA and DVI cables! </s>
<s> HI, Forget Samsung,even their mobiles dont last long!! </s>
<s> !I have a Prolite E481S LCD, IIYAMA, cant be beat!!!!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> I have just bought an Acer 19&quot; LCD monitor from Argos & I'mextremeley pleased with it, it is clear & means I don't have to use my glasses to work on my pc. </s>
<s> Hope that this is info is useful. </s>
<s> Hi, I have the LG 19&quot; LCD, Model L1932TQ with 1400:1 contrast ratio at 4ms monitor and wouldn't trade it for anything. </s>
<s> I absolutely love this monitor. </s>
<s> I searched around for weeks before buying this one and couldn't find a better display anywhere. </s>
<s> I bought it from Best Buy and would do it again in a New York minute, if I needed another one. </s>
<s> U can go for proview LCD Monitor U can see them on www.proview.net </s>
<s> I got a LG 17&quot; monitor last year from my local Best Buy, and have no regrets. </s>
<s> It has 1400 to 1 color/contrast ratio, and runs at a very fast 4 nannoseconds. </s>
<s> And can you believe it, but Best Buy now has LG monitors that run at 2000 to 1 color contrast ratios and that same fast speed? </s>
<s> And best of all, it comes with a 3-year warranty. </s>
<s> The only way I would upgrade is to another LG monitor. </s>
<s> I am able to run it on a Mac Mini, and had it running on a PC before. </s>
<s> Whatever you do, make sure you marry it to a video card that has a DVI cord. </s>
<s> The colors will be so much better. </s>
<s> The best for the money and the quality! </s>
<s> I love it! </s>
<s> Go and see it! </s>
<s> NOT EXPENSIVE, I've PAID $349.00 CANADIEN FOR IT </s>
<s> Hi My advice would be not to buy it at all. </s>
<s> It's too big Comfortable to work with and perfect size is what I have myself. </s>
<s> My monitor is a Compaq FP7317 David D </s>
<s> What's the point in a 19&quot; over a 17&quot;? </s>
<s> They're both native 1280x1024 resolution, and the smaller screen means that the dot pitch is going to be smaller (&quot;tighter&quot;), making for visibly finer-grained images and text. </s>
<s> For heaven's sake, never buy Viewsonic product. </s>
<s> Recently I purchased a Viewsonic 19&quot; LCD MODEL VA1912wb at high cost. </s>
<s> The performance is worst and the service is extremely poor. </s>
<s> When they cannot rectify, they do not even respond to the mails. </s>
<s> Try any other make like Proview, Acer, Samsung, LG, Dell. </s>
<s> I was carried away by their ad. </s>
<s> and missed buying the Dell. </s>
<s> Krishnan, India. </s>
<s> I have just bought one from newegg.com. </s>
<s> This is a a ViewSonic VX922. </s>
<s> It comes with the cables for both digital and analog signals (DVI and regular video. </s>
<s> So far, I have really enjoyed this monitor. </s>
<s> NOTE: This is not a wide screen monitor. </s>
<s> I would stay away from wide screen monitors. </s>
<s> From what I have heard and understand, there are some problems with the wide screen formats from distorted aspect ratios (images not looking right, either to fat or to tall) to the Windows Desktop not filling the whole screen. </s>
<s> hav u gone on the site i feel proview is the best. </s>
<s> All others are only brands </s>
<s> you better go with buy of zenith 19inch lcd monitor because its cheaper and best at bargain price </s>
