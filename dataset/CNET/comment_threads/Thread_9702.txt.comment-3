This is something you, me and few others may understand but most people like the idea of &quot;one-button recovery with no-disks-to-lose solution&quot; and probably dont consider the CONS.
I initially gave them the idea of a single DVD-ROM based recovery solution and I think I'll press on with it.
So whats your advice on this one?
?
