13437	0	240902	2446409	NR	skatefarmer	3/31/07 9:41 AM	1.17533406E12	help with ram please	i have a mesh pc, athlon 64 3500 + 256mb nvidia 7800 gtx 2 x 512mb DDR RAM PC3200 (200MHZ) im looking to get some more ram, preferably 1gb ocz or crucial, something fast... i just need help to know if it will work. I see ram that says pc3200 400MHZ, will that work??? im mainly looking for something to improve my gaming, my motherboard is quite old.. its a gigabyte ga-k8 pci express. if anyone can give me advice on any other essentials to upgrade like processors thats appreciated.

You can buy direct or go to resellers like Newegg.com, ZipZoomFly.com, etc., to buy. VAPCMD

But there is memory that operates in the motherboard's dual memory architecture and for best results it takes matched pairs. To avoid the RAM from going from 400MHz to 333Mhz...get 2 DIMMs @1GB each and place them in the first dual channel dimm slots. Test the new DIMMs thoroughly with Memtest86+. If they test OK....then add the 2 @ 512MBs and see how it runs... be prepared to obeserve the impact and tradeoff of the RAM speed reduction and the extra 1GB RAM. Then make your decision what to do the 2-512s. VAPCMD

13437	9	240902	2447870	2447749	linkit	4/2/07 7:46 AM	1.17549996E12	Download the manual	VAPCMD gave you an excellent plan of action to learn how to add more RAM to your motherboard. According to the manual, having three modules installed &quot;will cause system unable to boot.&quot; I'd stick with what you already have or replace your existing modules with two identical 1GB modules.

13437	11	240902	2448186	2448155	linkit	4/2/07 12:52 PM	1.17551832E12	Crucial.com conflicts with the motherboard manual	Crucial.com says the motherboard does not support dual channel mode. VS. The motherboard specifications say it does indeed support dual channel mode. The manual goes into detail with a table showing which configurations of filled memory slots will enable dual channel mode. http://www.gigabyte.com.tw/Products/Motherboard/Products_Spec.aspx?ClassValue=Motherboard&ProductID=1939&ProductName=GA-K8N51GMF-9 Whom should we trust???!! I usually go with the motherboard specifications over Crucial.com. I'd also make sure that the motherboard BIOS is up to date. Since Crucial.com takes pride in the accuracy of its information, I guess one could contact them to help clear the fog.

(see your mobo/pc manual to identify which bank a slot is part of.) if 2gb is your goal, that's probably the best way to go since all 3 sticks will be running at full ddr-400 speed.

Not sure I follow the question...sounds like you ARE taking advantage of the dual channel architecture with your 2-512MBs DIMMs in DIMM slots 1 and 3. It simply takes 2 DIMMs ...usually matching (same capacity, same speed) to complete the circuitry design. i no this is a bit of-topic but, if i upgraded to an am2 motherboard and got a x2 am2 processor, will i need to get ddr2 memory or can i still use ddr on a ddr2 motherboard??? thanks in advance Don't know of any AM2 MBs that use DDR..the design is for DDR2 and if you found such a MB, you'd suboptimize system performance. The only good new is DDR2 has dropped in prices rather dramatically since Christmas. VAPCMD
