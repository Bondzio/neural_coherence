I have the same problem, formatted my HP laptop that had Windows Media Center Edition and installed XP Professional, now it only recognizes 256MB out of my total 2GB installed.
I actually created a thread about this in another forum, and people are trying to help me out, go to the link below Gtwilson, if I fix the problem I'll post it in the other forum and not this one.
