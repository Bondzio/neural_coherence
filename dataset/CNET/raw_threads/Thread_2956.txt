Can I use this with any operating system or am I limited. I'm not sure were to find the information I'm looking? Which would be the best? Windows Vista/XP/2000? Linux (which distributions would work best)? I have two systems I could install the drive in, either a low-end desktop system or a midrange notebook. Which would be the better way to go? (I was leaning towards the low-end desktop over the notebook though I know it's probably overkill for the system). Thanks for the input. Todd
