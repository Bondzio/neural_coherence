1.1.1	I need to take a portable self contained scanner into the field to capture archival photographs.	St
1.1.2	It would have to be a flat bed type as these photographs would not survive a journey through the sheet fed variety.	St
1.1.3	I would need on-board storage (as much as possible) and portable power supply.	St
1.1.4	Output to a MAC would be preferable but not a necessity.	St
1.1.5	I couldn't find any product in previous threads on this subject, but wonder if there are any new products on the market.	St
1.1.6	I gather a high resolution (&gt;10 megs) digital camera might be the answer, but I need the highest resolution I can get.	St
1.1.7	Any suggestions?	St
1.1.8	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	But I have used laptops and scanners before.	St
1.2.2	A favorite (I bought 2!)	St
1.2.3	is the now discontinued HP C9900A photo scanner.	St
1.2.4	I decline duplicating specs or how it works but suffice it to say it's been grand to carry along to capture photos that fit on it.	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for your reply.	St
1.3.2	If I can find one, does it work on a stand alone basis (i.e.	St
1.3.3	not attached to the laptop)?	St
1.4.1	The more I read your post the more I see some omission.	St
1.4.2	Why isn't a laptop acceptable?	Ques
1.5.1	I'll be in India - museums, palaces, archives, etc.	St
1.5.2	Just want to keep my baggage to a minimum.	St
1.5.3	Don't really want to carry a laptop as well as a scanner.	St
1.6.1	There are fine web articles about using a camera as a scanner.	St
1.6.2	I won't duplicate such.	St
1.6.3	But if you must ask then do so in our camera forum.	St
1.6.4	Again, there is no such device.	St
