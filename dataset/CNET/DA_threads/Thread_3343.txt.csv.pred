1.1.1	I plan to build a PC primarily for use in professional digital still photo editing .	St
1.1.2	There are a number of graphic cards on the market geared towards gaming and 3D workstations .	St
1.1.3	Many of these are popular , such as nvidia 6800 and ATI 800 , but I do n't know if they are technically suited to my purpose .	St
1.1.4	I do n't mind overkill however , I would like to at least have the minimum requirements covered .	St
1.1.5	Can you recommend a graphic card ( s ) to use for digital photo editing ?	Ques
1.2.1	Many forget color calibration tools like this one - & gt ; http : //www.mysimon.com/Pantone_ColorVision_Spyder_with_PhotoCAL_display_color_calibration_kit/4014-6513_8-30481787.html ? tag=ob_20 & orderby=20 & sort=asc If you do n't get calibrated color , then the edits can be a waste of time .	Sug
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	The monitor would be more important than the video card .	St
1.3.2	John	St
1.4.1	if its any help i use 256MB NVIDIA GeForce FX 5500 card in a 3.2 pentium4 with 512 mb memory system this suits me fine for photo edits	St
1.5.1	IF you have cash to throw around buy yourself a Nvidea geforce 6600GT with 128mb ram .	St
1.5.2	That is an overkill , and only around $ 200AU .	St
1.5.3	you would do fine with anything upwards of a geforce 5200 for editing - but I recommend grabbing a new display at the same time - dell or Apple 's flat panels are nice if u have a lot of cash , but if not just get a flat screen CRT from Samsung or somebody .	St
1.5.4	Things to look out for without getting yourself buried in specs : Video Card : GPU clock speed - most GPU are 300-600mhz .	St
1.5.5	The 6600GT is 1000mhz I think - not sure atm .	St
1.5.6	128mb ram would be fine , u could even scrape by with 64 - go no lower though .	St
1.5.7	Monitor - Refresh rate is n't really important for what you want , but be on the lookout for things like colour fidility .	St
1.5.8	If you can get an LCD over a CRT as they are 1 ) much better for your eyes , and 2 ) Take up less desk space , so you have somewhere to put your camera .	St
1.6.1	The video card needs enough memory to do the highest color depth possible at the resolution you choose to run .	St
1.6.2	That is it .	St
1.6.3	Then , you need to look at more important things , like the monitor .	St
1.6.4	The monitor will make a huge difference because of color correctness issues .	St
1.6.5	Good monitors come with software to let you adjust the colors to be correct so that you can count on the color .	St
1.6.6	Again , this is a function of color correction being configurable , and having a good monitor .	St
1.6.7	Save your money when it comes to the card , you will more than make up for it when you buy the monitor .	St
1.7.1	It is more important to have the correct monitor than the video card .	St
1.7.2	You must remember that what you see on your monitor is not exactly how it will appear printed .	St
1.7.3	You can feasibly get by with any cheap video card .	St
1.7.4	I think that your needs should be met within the $ 150.00 US range .	St
1.7.5	Try a NVidia 5700 LE or ATI 9800 series card .	St
1.8.1	Any well-known brand of video card that has AT LEAST 32mb of ram should be good enough .	St
1.8.2	I use an older 32mb ATI Rage and a 17 & quot ; CRT with VERY GOOD results .	St
1.8.3	Many times , though , I have wished for a little more ram on the video card to speed up the process .	St
1.8.4	Enough ram in the computer is important , too .	St
1.8.5	That has not been mentioned in any of the posts .	St
1.8.6	If you are building the machine now , use a motherboard that will accept at least a GIG of ram & use it .	St
1.8.7	You will not regret having the extra ram .	St
1.8.8	Any good video card with 128k should be more than good enough .	St
1.8.9	Stay with a GOOD CRT .	St
1.8.10	Get the largest you can afford .	St
1.8.11	A 21 & quot ; if you can - and flat screen .	St
1.8.12	It is my understanding that the CRT refresh rate is usually better and that the colors are truer .	St
1.8.13	Use good photo editing software ( Adobe Photoshop is one of the best ) .	St
1.8.14	Adobe is one of the software packages that will allow you to configure the color output of your monitor so that it most closely matches your printer .	St
1.8.15	Speaking of printer - this was also not mentioned in any of the posts .	St
1.8.16	If a printed photo is the desired result , make sure that you use a good quality PHOTO printer .	St
1.8.17	Use the best ink carts you can get ( usually the factory ones ) & be sure to use & quot ; photo & quot ; inks and be certain to use good quality photo paper .	St
1.8.18	I wo n't mention any brand , but there are several good ones and they are not cheap !	St
1.8.19	If you do these things , you will have good results and not many complaints ( assuming that you do a good job retouching ) !	St
1.9.1	You are just using this for 2D so great calculations of polygons is n't an issue .	St
1.9.2	From what I have read of the past few years is that ATI is going to give you better images but nvidia is going to give greater speed .	St
1.9.3	Going with one of their top end cards is overkill for what you are using it for .	St
1.9.4	ATI X600 is great and not too expensive .	St
1.10.1	Yeah , flat panels are great on saving space , but not as versatile as the old-fashioned , but undeniably better CRT .	St
1.10.2	Get a 21 or 25 inch CRT monitor by a name brand manufacturer and you will get , aside from less desk space and higher electricity bills , a machine that is more apt to get you better color rendition and the variable resolutions ESSENTIAL FOR THE PROFESSIONAL .	St
1.11.1	I have had really good luck with fairly cheap cards for video editing .	St
1.11.2	I find the most important thing to be the software that you will be using to edit with .	St
1.11.3	you can get very good software quite reasonably , I reccomend Photoshop elements unless you are a real techie , than I would go with the full Photoshop program , it is spendy but well worth it .	St
1.11.4	The monitor issue is not all that important either if you use the right software you can calibrate any good monitor to work very well .	St
1.11.5	here is a link for a very good card at a great price .	St
1.11.6	http : //www.newegg.com/app/viewproductdesc.asp ? description=14-170-065 & DEPA=0	Ques
1.12.1	You do n't need a 400 or 500 dollar card unless your planning on gaming also .	St
1.12.2	For editing photo 's you might want to look at the Matrox Millennium P750 with 64mb ( $ 213.00 ) or even the Millennium G550 with 32mb ( $ 94.00 ) http : //www.matrox.com/mga/3d_gaming/products.cfm Matrox makes other cards like the Parhelia DL256 PCI graphics card but there prices are out of most users range .	St
1.12.3	Before settling on anything check prices on http : //www.pricewatch.com/ and others .	St
1.13.1	* For still digital editing you need two things : 1 .	St
1.13.2	True color fidelity video card that support 32-bit color pallette at the highest horizontal refresh rate comparable with your monitor .	St
1.13.3	16-bit color pallette is acceptable .	St
1.13.4	2 .	St
1.13.5	17 & quot ; or larger monitor that support 32-bit color at the color pallette size you want ( 32-bit ) ; the screen resolution you want ( 1024x768 ) or larger ; the smallest dot pitch that you can afford to buy ; and the highest supported horizontal refresh rate at the screen resolution and color pallette size you want .	St
1.13.6	Video card works in tandem with your monitor .	St
1.13.7	Do n't waste your money buying a high-end video card when your monitor can only support low-end resolution .	St
1.13.8	Check the specification of your monitor before buying video card .	St
1.13.9	Horizontal refresh rate of 75 HZ or higher is strongly recommended if you were to spend alot of time editing pictures .	St
1.13.10	Higher rate may be required for some people who 're more sensitive to & quot ; flickering screen & quot ; .	St
1.13.11	Higher refresh rate ( horizontal ) helps reduce eye straint/fatigue .	St
1.13.12	First , find out the size of your monitor ( 14 & quot ; , 15 & quot ; 17 & quot ; , 18 & quot ; , 19 & quot ; , 21 & quot ; , etc . ) .	St
1.13.13	Next , find out the horizontal refresh rate of your monitor at the 16-bit color pallette and screen resolution of 1024x768 and at 1280x1024 resolution .	St
1.13.14	Repeat the above step with 32-bit color pallette , if applicable .	St
1.13.15	You should see a table similar to this : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Monitor Screen Color	St
