I've looked into the services offered by WiTopia.net and HotSpotVPN.com. Does anyone have opinions about either of these services, or suggestions about one that works for them? Thanks.

HotSpotVPN offers up to 256bit AES encryption. HotSpotVPN works with Macs, the others do not. HotSpotVPN's is also easier to install (30 seconds, max). There areno forms to fill out and no certificates requests to exchange after the purchase. HotSpotVPN is also much more flexible with email. You are painted into a corner with the others.

My setup experience with hotspotvpn wasn't that smooth. perhaps they've changed things or you're talking about their old pptp service?? certificates are a GOOD thing and hotspotvpn uses them..just incorrectly..they load both the public and private key on your machine together instead of keeping one secured... YIKES. not sure what you mean about email..personalVPN works with any and all applications and mail packages as far as I know. actually..they both are based on openVPN, so ultimately, it's the same service, but hotspotvpn is about 3 times the price! and even more expensive if you want the 256bit encryption that you don't really need. also, why do they charge more for higher encryption..how does that cost them more or is it a sales gimmick?
