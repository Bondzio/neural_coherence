I figure I can probably build for cheaper and was looking for suggestions for a $4000 budget. This would be my first time building, so I'd also like to hear if it's worth it for me to be building such a high end system as a newb. Thanks, Gautrau

It's a bit over-budget ($4235) but these prices are ball-park... agressive price-shopping could shave a couple-hundred off. The Logitech 5450 speakers are $300 but the 5500's are just as good (if not better) and only $200.

Their 7900GT XXX is almost as fast as a stock 7900GTX. And when you add 2 of them in SLI, they will smoke any single 7900GTX. Some Antec power supplies are known to be incompatible with SLI (insufficient 12V amperage). I like Antec, but I don't use them for SLI builds (better safe than sorry). the dell 24&quot; monitor puts gaming at a new level. blows away a 19&quot; with only 1280x1024 res. and with the tv tuner, windows mce, wireless keyboard/mouse and the kick-a$$$ speakers, this gamer can also be the centerpiece of an entertainment system.

Your right about the ANTEC, Some are not acompatible to SLI and some are. the one i picked is. Also if i speed 4k on a gaming computer. Purpose is important to me. and a failed HD on a Gaming computer is like a busted tail light on a car. Yeah i wish it was not broke but i will fix it. so i have reinstall windows and some games. at least last years taxes did not get losed. I do not find it a tradedy if i lose a game because of a HD crash. I do not know about you, but how many HD's have just all of sudden dropped of line before they were 4years old. as for XFX and Evga...that is all about quality not speed or preformance. one thing about computer parts is...if you buy cheap, you buy twice. you got me on the DELL, I was getting close to 4k spot. and why media center. for a gamer you just need home. that will save him 50.00

I personally wouldn't get anything over the X2 3800+. Get 2 gigs of RAM because 4 is the limit for a 32-bit OS, and XP 64-bit edition is rather buggy. When Vista comes out, gamers will need 4 gigs of RAM, so get two 1GB sticks and upgrade when it's needed. Because price is no object, get XMS RAM rahter than ValueSelect. I've never heard of ePOWER before, so I'd get an Enermax: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817194004 If the power supply goes, the system goes, so you don't want to skimp on that to save money. Also, save money by getting a 300GB hard drive. Just my thoughts
2736	10	168293	1867777	1867277	ramarc	4/10/06 3:08 PM	1.14468168E12	get an x2 4400 and OC it	With a good coolor (like arctic cooling's freezer 64 pro) you should easily be able to OC it to 2.5/2.6 ghz and it will be just a smidge slower than a fx60. (check out the forums at overclockers.net, xbitlabs, anandtech, etc. to get OC tips for this mobo/cpu.) Don't cheap out and get VS RAM. Cut back to 2GB and get DDR-500 RAM (g.skill extreme is on sale now at $157 for 2gb). 2GB is more than enough for any of today's games, and you can always add more in the future when the price goes down. With these suggestions, you've saved $600 so why not move up to a widescreen monitor. 20&quot; WS's are about $100 more than the 19&quot; Samsung.
