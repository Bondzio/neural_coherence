i have searched numerous sites for a driver for my 64bit win 7 os to no avail.
the manufacturers site times out when i try to reach it looking for a new driver.
various sites answer when i search but they all require their scanning program to be installed and with no guarantee that they actually have a driver.
there is absolutely nothing else i think i can do.
i have tried the 3000 and 7000 scanner drivers but they don't work.
maybe this scanner is just due to be retired any help will be valued.
