it's quite possible you're right about the &quot;older drive&quot; situation.
i sorta kinda see how that could be a problem.
as far as 250gb hard drive is concerned, there's no doubt it was an upgrade.
i put it in about 3 years ago, and it came with the controller card that both drives are now hooked up to.
it wouldn't work otherwise.
the 40gb had windows xp on it at one time, but when i installed the 250gb, i made it my primary and reinstalled xp onto it.
since then, i've reformatted the 40gb and it's completely empty.
if microsoft is playing a trick on me, i don't see how they could be controlling my bios as well...but you never know with those guys.
anyway, what i'm trying to say is that i'm still confused why, alone, my 250gb won't even be recognized by my bios.
