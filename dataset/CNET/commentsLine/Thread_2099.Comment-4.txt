my arris is not a router.
if i connected one machine, the other would not work.
so far, a nic is not wireless.
i can however use a nic to connect wirelessly if i use an ethernet cable to what might be called a bridge.
sorry but it looks like you are asking me to give a course in networking.
that i will have to decline but will answer the stumpers.
