1.2.1	What do you mean ''wirelessly''?	Ques
1.2.2	I would say share the folder and then access the computer by typing ''\\&lt;computername&gt;'' in the run dialogue.	St
1.2.3	Personally for security reasons I would say go buy a cat5 link cable (my mind went blank can't think of the name of this cabling specifically) but its a slight increase in price and it allows you to directly connect two computers for the transferring of files etc, connects through an ethernet port btw.	St
1.2.4	Hope this helps..	St
1.3.1	But the most common gaffe (mistake) is that people will install a firewall without knowing how it works.	St
1.3.2	Setup the WiFi to adhoc mode, then share the folder.	St
1.3.3	Works for me.	St
