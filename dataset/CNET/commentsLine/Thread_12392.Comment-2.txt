the wired speed is on a switched 100 megabit hub.
the keyword is &quot;switched&quot;.
you can research that it means that one computer can transfer to another witout interfering with other computers.
the wifi-g air is shared so you get 54 megabit shared and rarely do i see the 108 megabit work out except at close range.
