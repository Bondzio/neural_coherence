<s> I work for a charitable outreach that receives, among other things, donated computers. </s>
<s> I perform a lobotomy on them, reinstall Windows and a couple other items, and give them away to a family who would otherwise not have access to a computer. </s>
<s> I was given a Compaq Prosignia 200 which is apparently a server since it has 3 hard drives and different cables and configuration. </s>
<s> I have no interest in using this machine as a server, and I simply want to do the same fdisk and reformat that I normally do. </s>
<s> Well, if youve followed this thread this far you know that whatever type of hard drive (SCSI?) </s>
<s> that a server uses is not going to let me do the standard PC operations. </s>
<s> Is there any way to download a BIOS or do some kind of mumbo-jumbo that will allow me to turn this baby into a standard PC? </s>
<s> And can I perform some operation on the other two hard drives so that I can use them in old machines? </s>
<s> &quot;Well, if youve followed this thread this far you know that whatever type of hard drive (SCSI?) </s>
<s> that a server uses is not going to let me do the standard PC operations&quot; I don't quite understand why formatting a drive and reinstalling a non-server OS will not be possible on this machine. </s>
<s> Give more details on why this will not work. </s>
<s> When I boot this machine with my Win 98 startup disk I first get an error message about drive positions have been changed which makes sense because I removed two of the three hard drives. </s>
<s> But I left the top HD (the master?) </s>
<s> connected to the mobo. </s>
<s> I press F1 to continue bootup from error message and eventually get to Windows 98 has detected that drive C does not contain a valid FAT or FAT32 partition...blah, blah, blah, no surprises here. </s>
<s> Machine sees the startup floppy in A and gives me a normal A prompt. </s>
<s> I type in fdisk and get No fixed disks present. </s>
<s> Does this have something to do with the jumpers? </s>
<s> These hard drives dont have the standard jumper choices MA, SL, CS that Im used to. </s>
<s> Rather, they have 6 choices: LED, RES, BIT3, BIT2, BIT1, BIT0. </s>
<s> Which one(s) do I jump? </s>
<s> And to further confuse me, there appears to be another set of jumpers on the front of the HD which have choices: TE, DS, ME, WP, PD, RES, TP, TP. </s>
<s> None are currently jumped. </s>
<s> Im obviously dealing with a different animal here. </s>
<s> Until you learn SCSI, put it back as you found it, then use FDISK and format to prepare the drive to install 98. </s>
<s> Let me be clear that since SCSI documentation is all over the internet, there is no need to put it in this small space. </s>
