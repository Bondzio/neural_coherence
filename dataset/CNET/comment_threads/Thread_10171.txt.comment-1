Hi I seem to be having a problem with my computers dvd playing capabilities.
I have a imation DVD rewritable drive installed in my computer (win XP) and its always worked, I was able to watch dvd's and even burn them but as of late weird things have been happening.
Now when i play a dvd, the dvd plays but its played very slowly, like half the speed or less then it should be, making watching them impossible.
NOTE: It also does this with an audio CD.
Also ,while whatevers playing, if you move the mouse around the arrow skips instead of moving smoothly like normal.
I've tried playing dvd's on windows media player, interactual player, WinDVD and PowerDVD and the same thing happens everytime.
My system specs Processor AMD Athlon(tm) 64 1791MHz Display Card NVIDIA GeForce 7600 GT Memory 1536MB Operating System Microsoft Windows XP Free Disk Space 334.83GB Display Card Memory 256MB Display Driver Version 9.1.4.7 DirectX Version 9.0c Optical Drive CD/DVD Sound Card C-Media Wave Device any ideas on what to do to get it working again.
