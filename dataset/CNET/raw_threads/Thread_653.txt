I know that most of you probably don't have more than one wireless N router, but based on range alone, which router, the Linksys WRT150N or the TP-LINK TL-WR951ND is better? I would tend to lean toward the Linksys just because of the band but in the review there was no mention of range and in the TP-LINK's review it said it had pretty good range. Thanks for your time.
