1.1.1	Hello all.	St
1.1.2	I am putting in a new DVD burner in my desktop.	St
1.1.3	When I do this, is it plug and play or are firmware and drivers required?	St
1.2.1	Windows has the drivers but NOT the software to record media.	St
1.2.2	Windows may also not have the software to play VIDEO DVDs but that's not a driver issue.	St
1.2.3	This is very much a DIY job.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	That is exactly what I was thinking.	St
1.3.2	Just wanted to be sure so I wouldn't set myself up for failure.	St
1.3.3	Thanks.	St
