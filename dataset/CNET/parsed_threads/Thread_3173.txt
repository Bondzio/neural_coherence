<s> We want to download Netflix to our Sony BDV-E770W/T77 Blue-ray Disc player. </s>
<s> We have been trying for months to purchase Netgear's POWERLINE AV 500 ADAPTER XAV5001 from the retailers linked to on their site. </s>
<s> It is not available anywhere! </s>
<s> Do you know anything that might help us? </s>
<s> Is there a problem with it that is keeping it off the market? </s>
<s> Is there a comparable product available? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> I am to lazy to go look for the latest news on these devices so take my comments with that disclaimer. </s>
<s> Like most things there are IEEE and other types of standards. </s>
<s> I suspect like many companies that waited to launch 802.11n wireless until the standard was publish that may be the case here. </s>
<s> They would take the chance of being incompatible if they launch based on unfinalized documents. </s>
<s> Last I heard 1901 or whatever the spec is was to be publish this fall for 500m power stuff. </s>
<s> Even after the spec is out and assuming they guess correctly and had manufacturing all set it will take a few months to get the product to retail. </s>
<s> I would be betting on December for first shipments and volume shipment not to be until first quarter 2011. </s>
<s> http://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-Powerline-200-Adapter-Kit/dp/B0036R9YA6 It's in stock and I could have a set tomorrow. </s>

<s> Thanks for responding. </s>
<s> I'm not sure what these &quot;standards&quot; mean, but I guess I'll have to continue to wait another few weeks to see what happens and if it does come to market. </s>
<s> Thanks, but this isn't the same product. </s>
<s> http://www.amazon.com/Cisco-Linksys-PLK300-PowerLine-Ethernet-Adapter/dp/B001J2ZSL4 is another type powerline unit. </s>
<s> Can you reveal what we are trying to solve here? </s>
<s> If it's the AV 500 you may have a long wait. </s>
<s> There must be an alternative unit. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Standard are just the agreement all the various companies build equipment to. </s>
<s> They can do it themselves and ignore the standards but few companies do. </s>
<s> Went and did some digging. </s>
<s> They announce the DRAFT copy sept 30/2010. </s>
<s> Most companies will manufacture based on this since it seldom changes before the office release. </s>
<s> The final document is scheduled for Feb 2011. </s>
<s> There is almost no way to predict when you can buy these devices. </s>
<s> All depends how much demand these companies see. </s>
<s> The larger question will be can you REALLY get 500m or is this just one of those fake marketing numbers. </s>
<s> I would assume it will be faster than the current 200m products on the market but how much we will not know for a while. </s>
<s> http://standards.ieee.org/announcements/2010/1901.html http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/1901/ </s>
<s> There's no other product out there that offers 500Mb/s duplexed, or &quot;gigabit&quot; speeds, that's any kind of reliable. </s>
<s> Belkin has had a product out for a few ... weeks? </s>
<s> months now? </s>
<s> but the reviews are horrible. </s>
<s> Netgear got it right with their second and third gen products -- I'm a happy user of the 200Mb/s adapters, but it's just not enough for heavy duty jobs like I do as a software engineer, and it's just barely up to the job of streaming HD movies or games -- don't bother trying to switch a lot of devices with heavy load over the XAVB101 kit, you're going to choke it. </s>
<s> http://www.homeplug.org/certified_products Nothing from Netgear in the 500Mb/s class. </s>
<s> To go that fast we will have to wait or just get wired. </s>
<s> For example I found that direct connection on 1000BT ethernet is my preferred connection for Microsoft Easy Transfer jobs. </s>
