a usb flash drive will not be big enough to save all your files.
a usb external hard drive is the answer.
this is a great (flash drive) way for the short term as far as files are concerned.
a good tip for the future, use a external hard drive to save your created files too!
this way you won't have the problem should the os fail on your (c) drive in the future, because it ins't dependent on the on the os drive.
stay alway from purchasing a maxtor external drive, they're know to have serious problems!
another option is to practice file back-ups via your cd/dvd burner, this will save you a lot of heart and grief on what you consider are important files that you don't want to loose.
best case, os system drive with program files, ext drive for document and data files ect.
you can use either a standard ext drive 3 1/2 inch (con = requires ac power to use, minimum size is about 160gb) or use a 2 1/2 inch laptop drive (pro = doesn't require ac power to use, mimimum size 40gb and up to 120gb) this pulls power from your system's usb port and it's more portable.
