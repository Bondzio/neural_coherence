<s> This is the pc i have been putting together: p4 lga775 540j 3.2ghz GA-8I915P Duo Pro 120gb sata hd (i have not bought any ram yet but i know what i will buy.) </s>
<s> The main issue is which graphics card i will buy, i play alot of games and i am looking to purchase a card most suited to my needs. </s>
<s> My monitor is capable of high resolutions so this is not an issue, as i want to play games at high detail. </s>
<s> I am thinking of either 6800gt, 6800 ultra or a 7800gtx. </s>
<s> I am also aware of the new ati line of cards just around the corner. </s>
<s> Is a 7800gtx over kill for my system? </s>
<s> I want the card to last me a fair amount of time, i may choose to upgrade cpu etc in future, but the price difference is a considerable amount between these cards. </s>
<s> Could a 6800 ultra cope with modern games at highest settings? </s>
<s> Any thoughts or help on this would be gratefully accepted. </s>
<s> What power supply are you using? </s>
<s> The Nvidia 7 series cards require a minimum 400W psu. </s>
<s> Also, take alook at the 7800GT for more performance than a 6800 Ultra but cheaper than the GTX. </s>
<s> These cards do not come in AGP, only PCI Express. </s>
<s> The 7 series can handle any game out there as of right now. </s>
<s> i have a 525w hiper psu, do u think it is wise to wait for the ati offering, i am willing to pay for 7800gtx, but as it is a lot of money i want to be sure </s>
<s> NIL </s>
