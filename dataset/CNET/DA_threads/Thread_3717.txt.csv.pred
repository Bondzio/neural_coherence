1.1.1	I have a data disk that I recently burned on my DVD burner .	St
1.1.2	The disk was nearly full .	St
1.1.3	Now , when I try to access a couple of the files on the disk ( towards the end of the list ) on either one of my DVD drives on my system ( I have both a burner and a straight DVD drive ) , I ca n't access them .	St
1.1.4	It just stuggles with them and does't play ( the files are movies ) .	St
1.1.5	But I tried playing them on a system at Staples , and they played fine with no problem .	St
1.1.6	I have noticed some problems before accessing files on full DVD 's .	St
1.1.7	My system consists of a Pentium 4 running at 2.53 Ghz. , 256 meg memory , 2 160 GB HD 's , 1 DVD +R burner and one DVD drive , all running under Windows ME .	St
1.1.8	I know Windows ME has a 4 GB file size limit , thought maybe that limitation was causing the problem .	St
1.1.9	Any input would be greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	If the disc is readable on the DVD recorder then you are proving that the failing DVD drive is just getting old .	St
1.2.2	Some will go into denial over that , but we just wait and let the drive fail more and more until the owner caves in and tries a new drive .	Sug
1.2.3	For now , try a CD/DVD lens cleaner .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I had considered the possibility of a drive going out , but two drives at once ?	Ques
1.3.2	Along with that the fact that the same drive that I burned the DVD with wo n't play all of it ?	Ques
1.3.3	I suppose it 's possible , but the fact that neither drive will play all the files has me scratching my head .	St
1.3.4	I used a lens cleaner on the drives today , regrettably didnt help any .	St
1.4.1	One bad one can interfere with the other .	St
1.4.2	It 's why you test each on their own .	St
1.4.3	And try a new IDE cable ( common failure point . )	Sug
1.4.4	Be sure to try a known working drive so you do n't waste your days with bad drives .	Sug
