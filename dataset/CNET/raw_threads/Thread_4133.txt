But what I've seen is that motherboards rarely cause a benchmark to move about. Since you didn't define what would be better (benchmark, dollars or such), your question can't be answered. Even moreso you didn't supply any possible boards for consideration. Here's why this matters. Some posters are in Aus, some in Britain and what's available where you are may not be some board I would point at. In closing, if your board supplier won't talk to you about this, why are you doing business with them? Bob

Pretty certain that other parameters are internal chip parameters and both the 130 and 90's use the same pinouts. However I think that John Robie had posted something that only certain models would support Dual Core. Maybe email John. Long range, however, because putting the MCH on the CPU chip has boxed them in to using only DDR [no DDR2]. New socket scheduled for mid 2006 [but bet that they beat that if Intel does something to spur them to beat that schedule] for CPU's supporting DDR 2.
