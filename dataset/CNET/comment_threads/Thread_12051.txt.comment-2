Well the answer is yes and know If you do indeed get different memory they might play together and they might not.
Through past experience this is the case.
If they do they will run at the slower of the two speeds, if they don't you have spent $ for just the 512 which should run ok on your machine, maybe .
I hope this helps and I don't seem like an idiot but this is just the way it works with memory.
SO for my $ I would match the memory.
