<s> I hope somebody out there can help me. </s>
<s> My wife has bought a Toshiba laptop with a US Robotics 22Mbps wireless card. </s>
<s> I am trying to get it to recognize my wireless router on my desktop. </s>
<s> The router is a D-Link DI-624. </s>
<s> I am on an ADSL highspeed connection and my server says everything appears to be working-re the desktop, but the laptop cannot connect. </s>
<s> It worked in a different location other than home (connecting to another network) and it worked in another location using my D-Link router. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> is: 1) How far is the device from the router? </s>
<s> 2) Is the wireless network seen as available (presuming you use Windows XP to run the wireless network feature)? </s>
<s> 3) What does the routers DHCP client list show? </s>
<s> Is the laptop displaying any messages (ie., Limited or no connectivity, network not connected, etc) What kind of settings do you have for your security (WEP, PSK, etc) I have the same router and have encountered a few problems. </s>
<s> At first when I connected everything worked like a charm, then the issues began where it would not connect using WEP security encription. </s>
<s> I now have no issues after reseting the router and running the PSK security setting. </s>
<s> It runs through three walls and some 50 feet away. </s>
<s> Give us a little more info in terms of messages being displayed in the laptop itself. </s>
<s> Thanks for responding -the device is 10 feet and through 1 wall from the router -the icon on the taskbar shows &quot;wireless network connection 4 - not connected&quot; when I click &quot;view available networks&quot; a window shows up saying Windows cannot configure this wireless connection -the Dynamic DHCP client list shows this -brian 192.168.0.100 00-80-C8-E1-7F-98 Jan/28/2005 00:31:48 </s>
<s> you click &quot;Connect&quot; on your available wireless network? </s>
<s> Is your network shown as available? </s>
<s> Is the wireless PC Brian 192.168.1.100? </s>
<s> because there is available network. </s>
<s> The brian 192.168.1.100 I get from the D-Link wizard on my desktop. </s>
<s> I'm feeling pretty lost at the moment. </s>
<s> I'm completely new to wireless and everything is greek to me. </s>
<s> and &quot;?&quot; is the Toshiba? </s>
<s> Have you run the Network Setup Wizard within the D-Link router? </s>
<s> Access the routers setup program from your hard wired PC by typing 192.168.0.1 in a browser address bar. </s>
