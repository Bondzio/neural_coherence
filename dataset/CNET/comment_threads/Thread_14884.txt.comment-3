I have tried the tool, and computer rebooted again.
I ripped and encoded one of my dvd's on another drive, no problems, encoded, again no problems, but a simple cut and paste of a file originating on my D:\ drive to another disk produced another hard reboot.
Played a game originating on another drive, again no problems.
so i do think the HD is shot.
Thanks!
