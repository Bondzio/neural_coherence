<s> can anyone help? </s>
<s> i have a 12&quot; G4 powerbook running Mac OS X 3.3, i remember my login which isn't a root login, but have forgotten my admin password. </s>
<s> i also do not have the original OS X disks to change it. </s>
<s> i want to erase the hard disk and install OS X fresh so i have root access to make changes etc. </s>
<s> but i have had no luck. </s>
<s> it wont mount via firewire onto the desktop of my other mac, it wont boot from a CD... </s>
<s> I'm stuck! </s>
<s> Unless you have any X.3.x installation disks, and can boot from them, then you are generally SOL. </s>
<s> The major question here is not that you cannot change your password, but that you cannot boot from the CD. </s>
<s> Will it boot from any CD? </s>
<s> Will it read any CD's? </s>
<s> How were you planning on installing OS X fresh without any installation disks? </s>
<s> Go beg, borrow or otherwise obtain, a set of Panther installation disks. </s>
<s> If you are trying to boot from the RESTORE disks from another Mac, you are probably wasting your time. </s>
<s> They are machine specific. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> i do have panther 10.3 disks, but it will not boot from the disk, i turn the machine on with disk one inserted, hold down C or apple C and it always just takes me to the log in screen which i set up when i bought the computer - admin login, or one for the family with no access priv. </s>
<s> it's the admin password i have forgotten and the install disks i have borrowed just don't seem to be working. </s>
<s> is there no other way of wiping the HDD when i'm in the non admin login? </s>
<s> Make sure that you have an undamaged install disk. </s>
<s> Put the CD in the drive. </s>
<s> When it appears on the desktop, open it up and go to the Install OS X icon. </s>
<s> Double click it. </s>
<s> The machine should reboot from the CD and allow you to go to the File menu and reset the password. </s>
<s> If the machine does NOT boot from the CD, then the CD is damaged or your CD drive is not functioning correctly. </s>
<s> When booted from the Installation CD, the machine will NOT go to any password screen until you tell it to. </s>
<s> Reset password is in the File menu of the install window P </s>
<s> The drive reads the disk and it shows on the desktop, but when i try to intstall OS X it asks for my admin password. </s>
<s> when i try and boot from the disk it sounds like it's reading the disk, but the OS X login screen always appears. </s>
<s> i can't understand why it will not boot from a disk because even if i did know my root password it is still not letting me boot from the disk. </s>
<s> i know the disk works because i installed OS X on my home G4 tower from this disk. </s>
<s> is there no software available that will delete the HDD? </s>
<s> after all i'm not trying to access password protected files, i'm just deleting them right? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Part of the strength of OS X is that its Core, and a bunch of other places, is protected against what you are trying to do to it. </s>
<s> This is one of the many reasons that there are currently no Virus's for OS X. </s>
<s> To delete the files you have to have access to them AND have the rights to read/write and delete. </s>
<s> You are going to have to boot from the CD to install OS X so I would not be too quick to blow away the HD. </s>
<s> The OS X installer will not install to the Drive that it is mounted on. </s>
<s> I would continue my efforts to boot from the CD. </s>
<s> Have you tried inserting the CD, mounting it on the Desktop, going to System preferences, choosing the CD as the startup disk and then restarting?? </s>
<s> If not, try it. </s>
<s> You are going to have to boot from the CD eventually. </s>
<s> (See above) P </s>
<s> i can't boot the disk as a startup disk because the packlock is locked and i need an admin pass to make changes. </s>
<s> i don't understand why i cannot boot from a disk. </s>
<s> surely you can boot from any disk right? </s>
<s> is there software available to overwriye the admin password protection? </s>
<s> if not i think i'm going to have to buy a new HDD </s>
<s> I know of no software that will over ride the Administrators password. </s>
<s> that does not mean that it does not exist though. </s>
<s> I will keep banging the &quot;You gotta boot from the CD&quot; drum though. </s>
<s> Once you get your brand new, virgin, HD, how do you propose to get the OS onto it? </s>
<s> To install OS X onto the new HD, you will HAVE to boot from the CD. </s>
<s> You can only boot from a CD that has the correct operating system for your machine. </s>
<s> However, your machine should boot from the original Panther CD's. </s>
<s> You said you had the Panther disks, the Three black ones? </s>
<s> Does the machine boot from ANY CD? </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> yes i have the three black panther disks, it will not boot from these, nor will it boot from any other CD that i've tried so far. </s>
<s> could it be that i'd upgraded to OS X 3.5 before i lost my root password and the machine will not boot from these disk as they are only 3.3? </s>
<s> should i try getting a later version of OS panther to see if that works? </s>
<s> the thing i can't understand is that my home desktop G4 runs on OS X 3.3 and i can boot from any disk on that machine. </s>
<s> could i have turned my powerbook's &quot;option to boot from a CD&quot; off in anyway? </s>
<s> or perrhaps the powerbook needs to be running in single user (root) mode to be able to boot from a disk? </s>
<s> Panther only comes in one flavor on a CD. </s>
<s> You have to update from there. </s>
<s> Unless the CDROM drive is faulty, I don't think there is any reason why it would not boot from the install disks. </s>
<s> This might be worth biting the bullet and speaking with Apple. </s>
