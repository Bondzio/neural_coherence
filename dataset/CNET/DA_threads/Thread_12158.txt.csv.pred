1.1.1	Hi everyone !	St
1.1.2	I was wondering if there was a USB dongle that works like a router .	St
1.1.3	That I can plug it into my computer , which has a WLAN connected , and it will become an access point for WiFi .	St
1.1.4	Basically a router that is as small as a USB flash drive .	St
1.1.5	Thanks to those who help !	St
1.2.1	What is your PC currently connected to and how ?	Ques
1.2.2	If you go straight to a modem , then you buy a standard wireless router .	St
1.2.3	If you 're connected to a wired router , you add a wireless access point to that .	St
1.2.4	If you want others to connect through your PC , what you 'd need is a wireless network interface device that can act as an AP and be bridged to your wired NIC .	St
1.2.5	In any event , I think you 're looking for an AP and not a router unless you have some other purpose here .	St
1.2.6	Maybe if you could explain more about your plan , it would get you a better answer .	St
1.3.1	Thank you so much for replying Steven Haninger !	St
1.3.2	I have a wired connection , cable .	St
1.3.3	Cable plugged into modem and modem plugged into PC .	St
1.3.4	That 's it .	St
1.3.5	I know there are USB Flash drive-sized wireless ADAPTERS , that pick up wireless from existing access points .	St
1.3.6	But I would like to know if there 's a flash drive-sized router .	St
1.3.7	Where I can plug it into my wired PC and it will broadcast my internet .	St
1.3.8	I just want an access point made from my wired connection , but not with something as big as a router .	St
1.3.9	Thanks again for all your help !	St
1.4.1	There is ICS which I will no longer write about .	St
1.4.2	Too unreliable , twitchy to setup so google ICS and move on .	St
1.4.3	The honest truth is a router is just as much money as a USB wifi anything .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	Thanks !	St
1.5.2	But money 's not the problem .	St
1.5.3	I just want it to be portable and a snap to set up .	St
1.5.4	I once got such a thing for the Wii Nintendo system .	St
1.5.5	It 's as small as a USB flash drive , you simply plug it into a computer that has a wired connection and it will broadcast that connection to become an access point .	St
1.5.6	But it only works for nintendo products .	St
1.6.1	And see if such is out there .	St
1.6.2	What 's odd is that a portable wifi router is easy to find .	St
1.6.3	Setup is no harder than any router setup .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	& quot ; a portable wifi router is easy to find .	St
1.7.2	Setup is no harder than any router setup & quot ; can you point me to one ?	Ques
1.7.3	Thanks again for your help	St
1.8.1	typing in & quot ; portable wifi routers & quot ; .	St
1.8.2	You 'll see most are designed for mobile use .	St
1.8.3	But , since you said that a standard router was too big , are you sure that something the size of a deck of cards would be acceptable but not one as big as a paperback book ?	Ques
1.8.4	Is that what 's most important to you .	St
1.8.5	Otherwise , about all I can think is that maybe you insist that your PC be on before the connection even exists .	St
1.8.6	Keep in mind that part of what a router does is handle IP addressing on a network and that connecting such to your laptop would create a separate network as well .	St
1.8.7	I also ca n't see anyway that doing what you 're asking is n't going to cripple your laptop in some regard .	St
1.8.8	A wireless router connected to your modem would do all you seem to want if you could find about 40 or so cubic inches of space .	Sug
1.9.1	Dear sirs , Please link www.sunlink.com.tw , you will find the products - USB WIFI Router which meet your requirments .	St
1.9.2	Thanks	Polite
