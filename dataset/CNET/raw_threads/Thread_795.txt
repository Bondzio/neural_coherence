I can't log into the router, no connection to the internet, and have to run a power cycle to get things back to normal. This could happen between 10 minutes or 10 hours. I've looked around and seen a bunch of others with the same issue and no solution. Something tells me its just the hardware. I also have two other routers I got to try and replace it, but came up with their own issues. One's a Linksys newer WRT54G2 model, the small black ones. It doesn't have the disconnect issue but I had problems getting its wireless to broadcast properly. I also have an older WRT54G that worked fine at my apartment but after I tried a hard reset I can't access it anymore, it won't even show up on the network.
