1.1.1	What would i need for one ?	Ques
1.1.2	i want to be able to share my net connection to a laptop and a desktop pc thanks anthony	St
1.2.1	You need to go out and buy a wireless switch/router such as Netgear or Linksys and also you need to buy a wireless PCMCIA card for the laptop and either a wireless PCI card for the desktop or a USB wireless connector , personally I would stay away from the USB devices , they are shakey at best .	St
1.3.1	Cheers thank you that has helped no end	Polite
1.4.1	Vipergg 's suggestions will work ( and I especially agree with the recommendation that you not use the USB devices , as USB networking is a real kludge , developed back in the days when nearly all new computers had USB ports for printers , but only corporate-class machines had ethernet ports ; now , nearly all computers have ethernet ports , so USB for networking is unnecessary ) , however I would suggest that at least one system on your network should be wired to the router rather than an entire wireless network .	St
1.4.2	When you first set up the router , it will default to no security , no encryption , and default identification and password .	St
1.4.3	This will be fine at first .	St
1.4.4	Your wireless client devices will automatically find the nearest access point and connect .	St
1.4.5	However , once you start locking down the security ( and you absolutely must do this , it is not an option ) , you introduce the opportunity for minor errors in typing the encryption key or client MAC addresses , and boom , you are locked out of the router because the client has the wrong key .	St
1.4.6	If you have one system that is wired , you can log into the router and straighten things out so both ends of the transmission are on the same wavelength ( pun intended ... ) .	St
1.4.7	Furthermore , some routers will allow you to disable wireless access to the configuration screens to prevent a war-driving hacker who happens to find your access point from being able to break in to it and change any settings from afar .	St
1.4.8	In your initial question , you did n't say whether the desktop system and the router would be located near each other .	St
1.4.9	If they are close , I 'd skip the PCI card wireless client and keep it wired to the router .	St
1.4.10	If your arrangement does n't allow for that , then you should temporarily use your laptop wired via ethernet cable to the router for setup while you configure the desktop in wireless mode , and then learn how your laptop would flip back and forth between wired and wireless mode .	St
1.4.11	Now you can move the laptop away and configure it for wireless , but still be able to quickly connect by wire should you need to .	St
1.4.12	Just some ideas to consider ... dw	St
