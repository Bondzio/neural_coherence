Why is it I can ping my router from my desktop (ethernet to the router) and my wireless laptop will ping the router but the desktop can't ping the laptop.
The laptop can't ping the desktop.I would like to share files and the printer on the desktop.
Both computers are in the same workgroup but never show up together, I have a Belkin N MIMO wireless router with 4 ethernet connections on the back.
