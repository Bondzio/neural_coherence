Laptop second computer DellInspirion E- 1705 W#in XP. Wireless Lan Belkin ( cant see model on body). DSL hookup for internet service. Printer Canon MP 780 Pixima. Printer was already installed and working on the Sony. PROBLEM, Everything is working fine except I can't get the printer to be accessed by the remote laptop. I hooked this all up myself with no issues but the printer being accessed by the Dell. What basic thing am I missing? I tried all the obvious like enabling and even installed the cd software on the Dell. Basically what are the simple steps to add that printer to the wireless lan. I know this is probably easy but I tried a lot and am missing the point. Thanks.

Not simple at all	http://forums.cnet.com/5208-6122_102-0.html?forumID=44&threadID=198031&messageID=2129068 is a good read as we travel along trying to find out why a share couldn't be made. It appears that XP never thought of &quot;simple.&quot; Bob

You will need to install the printer on the other machine and point it to the shared printer. You might be able to do this through the network. You will also need to make sure you have permission to use it. Have you done these things? Wired or wireless shouldn't make a difference with a shared printer as long as you can access the PC that hosts it.
