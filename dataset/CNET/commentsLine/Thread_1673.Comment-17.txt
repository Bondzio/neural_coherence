the vpn server is a netgear fvs114...that alone should give us access to the network... since the other gateway end is the exact same thing... from my understanding all the vpn connection is done through the routers not through any pc's... then we are just using remote desktop to connect to other physical pc's and servers on the networks... they can already be accessed in this way by an already existing vpn tunnel using the fvs114 at the &quot;main office&quot; and a satellite office... now, i have added another vpn tunnel to the fvs114 router at the main office and am trying to establish that vpn connection to my house... it should work in the same way as the original tunnel... however, it is not.
