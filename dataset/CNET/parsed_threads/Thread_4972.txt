<s> I have a HP Pavilion p6110y Desktop PC. </s>
<s> Recently my power supply died on me. </s>
<s> I bought a power supply which is 430W and installed into my PC which still works fine. </s>
<s> I just found out that my old (original) power supply was 250W. </s>
<s> Will this increase in wattage be something bad for my PC or good? </s>
<s> I haven't upgraded anything else. </s>
<s> My old power supply fan was facing to the vent on the Desk top tower but the new one which I installed, is facing inside the PC and not to the vent. </s>
<s> Is it something that I should be concerned about? </s>
<s> Your expert advice is much appreciated </s>
<s> Let's break it down to wattage and your fan question. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Wattage. </s>
<s> A wall outlet here can deliver about 15 Amperes at 110 Volts or about 1600 Watts. </s>
<s> It does not blow out a 10 Watt LED lamp because the lamp draws what it needs. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Fan. </s>
<s> There is no carved in stone mandate that the fan be in a particular place on the PSU. </s>
<s> Since you upsized the PSU and it's working I'd say it's fine. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It sounds to me as if he's somehow mounted the unit wrong, I've done quite a few PSU change outs in Hp towers and have yet to see one venting in, that is one for the books. </s>
<s> I've seen the fans move from the rear to the bottom of the PSU on these designs. </s>
<s> It's not something I think about much but if folk don't do this a lot, I see why they are concerned. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Fan placement, is a concern only if it isn't working. </s>
<s> I can't offer why in recent yrs. </s>
<s> that placement of the fan is now changed but overall I haven't seen it being a negative result. </s>
<s> Airflow in a PC case still has to followed, in that the frt. </s>
<s> of PC case is &quot;IN&quot; and the rear of PC is &quot;OUT&quot; flow. </s>
<s> For your benefit, place a thin strip of cloth or paper that flows and locate near rear of PC case by fan. </s>
<s> Is it blowing away from PC, then it's OK. </s>
<s> If not and is thrown in, then suspect that the airflow is there to circulate inside and then be thrown out by yet another fan. </s>
<s> As long as there is airflow &quot;in &lt;-&gt; out&quot; then allow it to do its job. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks everyone for your advice. </s>
<s> I think now I am a mini PSU expert I have mounted the power supply correctly as there is only one possible position where it can mounted. </s>
<s> On the tower PC, the vent is in the rear near below power plug-in, but the power supply fan is on the side. </s>
<s> I did place a piece of paper on the rear of the vent and it blows it away. </s>
<s> So it shows air movement and I am all satisfied that my mobo won't be fried </s>
