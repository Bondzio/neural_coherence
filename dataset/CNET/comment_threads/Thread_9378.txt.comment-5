I don't know all models but some require the maker's adapter to charge.
You claim the old adapter was working so why not step back to that adapter and leave out the battery.
If that fails, it needs repairs.
And in parting I'm assuming you read about the generic reset noted in the CNET Laptop Troubleshooting forum welcome post.
