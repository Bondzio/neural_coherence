1.1.1	I 'm planning to add a DVD-ROM to my new computer ( it currently has a DVD/CD RW drive with Light Scribe ) .	St
1.1.2	I 've found numerous models ( much cheaper than I ever could have imagined $ 17 to $ 25 ) but have no idea what I 'm looking for or what names mean quality .	St
1.1.3	Some of the brands I 've found are : BenQ , Toshiba , Lite-On , LG , Samsung , Sony , Asus .	St
1.1.4	Can anyone recommend one of those brands over another ?	Ques
1.1.5	Do the DVD-ROM Access Times , CD-ROM Access Times , and Cache Times mean a lot ?	Ques
1.1.6	For DVD-ROM Access Times the one I like has 80-220ms but others have as low as a constant 90ms .	St
1.1.7	For CD-ROM Access Times the one I like as 165ms but others have as low as 95ms For Cache the one I like has 512K but other have as much as 2M .	St
1.1.8	Thanks for your help .	Polite

1.2.1	For $ 40 USD or less you can get a dual layer DVD+/-RW drive that will work with all major media types .	St
1.2.2	The more cache the better .	St
1.2.3	2MB cache works great for me ; I ca n't justify 2x-3x the $ $ for 8MB .	St
1.2.4	As for brands , I have had good experiences with NEC and Sony .	St
1.2.5	my method : http : //reviews.cnet.com/5208-7591-0.html ? forumID=26 & threadID=90370 & messageID=1535855 & tag=	St
1.3.1	I was looking at just a DVD-ROM drive because I already have a DVD +/-RW drive in my computer and was told that there may be some conflict within the computer when trying to burn items because of having two different burners .	St
1.3.2	Do you feel that 512K of Cache is too little ?	Ques
1.3.3	Thanks for your help .	Polite

1.4.1	512K is too little if you like speedy drives .	St
1.4.2	Get the 2MB cache drive .	St
1.4.3	I do n't have a problem with multiple DVD+/-RW drives .	St
1.4.4	You just tell your burning software which drive to use when you go to burn discs -- very easy .	St
1.4.5	I think it is wise to purchase a second DVD burner instead of a Read-Only drive since your old drive will fail at some point ( as all drives do ) , and the dual layer DVD burners are so inexpensive these days .	St
1.4.6	Nevertheless , the bottom line is always your budget .	St
