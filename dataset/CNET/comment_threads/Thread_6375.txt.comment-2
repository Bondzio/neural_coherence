The step by step is still only a GUIDE and will never match exactly what you see on the screen.
I hope this explains that issue well enough for you.
As to your issue today, you omitted the part names, models, makes, how it's connected so there is little more I can offer except to note that the usual cause of not seeing file and printer shares are FIREWALL settings.
