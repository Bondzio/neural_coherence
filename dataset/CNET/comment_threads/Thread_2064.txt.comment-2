There are several on the market that have the capability to do what you want to do.
Hewlett Packard makes several different models.
Epson makes a nice one also, it is called the PERFECTION and works well.
There are several units that do it all, printing, scanning(slides and transparencies) and copying.
Check out your local box stores and see what they might have.
They are not that expensive probably between 200 and 300 bucks should get you there.
Good luck!
