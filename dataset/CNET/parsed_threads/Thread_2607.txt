<s> I just moved to a new apartment with two cable internet wall jacks. </s>
<s> The one in my room didn't seem to be working, so I ran a cable to the other jack (my roommate's) and I can access the net fine with that one. </s>
<s> I called the apartment complex's tech people and they sent a guy with his laptop. </s>
<s> He proceded to connect his laptop to the jack in my room and it worked for him. </s>
<s> He then told me I probably had a faulty network card and should buy a new one. </s>
<s> But every store I've been to said it's probably a settings-related problem. </s>
<s> Thoughts? </s>
<s> I'm running WinXP and have had my network card for about 3 years. </s>
<s> It's a NETGEAR FA311 fast ethernet adapter. </s>
<s> On the box it says it is compatible with XP, but the documentation inside makes no mention of XP-compatibility. </s>
<s> Any help is appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> that your PC will work from your roommate's jack but not from yours. </s>
<s> Can his machine connect from your jack? </s>
<s> Bad cable perhaps? </s>
<s> Well, I have tried with two cables thus far. </s>
<s> The thing is, they both seemed to work for the tech guy when he plugged his laptop in. </s>
<s> My roommate isn't moving in till Tuesday, so I haven't checked with his computer yet. </s>
<s> multiple components, is often a process of elimination. </s>
<s> You verify ones peice of hardwares workability and whittle it down to the troubled device. </s>
