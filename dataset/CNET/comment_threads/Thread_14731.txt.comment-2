Next check is the BIOS.
If it doesn't show there try an external cable like this one -&gt; http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=2020 If the drive does not work on said cable, get a quote from http://www.drivesavers.com -&gt; In parting I didn't write about power off, remove cover, push in the cables and try again.
