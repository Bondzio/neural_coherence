quote you said: &quot;everyone in this community has the right to ask a legitimate question without being subjected to ridicule or vicious insensitive comments for having asked.
sarcastic, pseudo-intellectuals like you who can' t seem to see pass their own nose are the individuals who need reprimanding and correction.
&quot; and then you said: &quot;it appears to me that your head may be composed of &quot;water vapor&quot; (more on that later) and obviously stuck in a &quot;cloud&quot; of ignorance, stupidity and a lack of consideration for others!&quot; it's ironic that you say the same thing that you claim to dislike so much.
shame on you.
