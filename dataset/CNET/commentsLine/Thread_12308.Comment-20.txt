i have a pc 3 years old in september.
acer that came with an hatachi 500gb, i added the first week of ownership a western digital and 3 years and two months later the western digital failed.
even for a back up drive with very little on it i was rather disappointed.
it got pretty hot.
ive unplugged it and once it cooled down it ran fine.
i put a fan right in front of the hard drive in the case and still shut down every 3 days.
so perhaps western digital sold me a fluke of a lemon?
oh, the warrenty expired on the 3 year mark.
this p,o,s died exactly 2 months later.
