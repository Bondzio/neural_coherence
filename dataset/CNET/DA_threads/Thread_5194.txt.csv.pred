1.1.1	This is kind of off topic , but Pc hardware realated , I do not request that anyone reply , but If you own this particular Board or a HP/Compaq Machine that uses it , please complain to them .	St
1.1.2	Basically , from April last year AMD Have been selling PC 's with Socket 754 motherboards , known As Asustek Diablo 's , or K8 K8N8X-LA PES for Athlon 64 Processors .	St
1.1.3	HP Released a new BIOS a while ago that allows the board to take a Athlon 64 3400+ ( Original Bios only 3200+ ) .	St
1.1.4	I phoned HP Today and asked for a 3700+ BIOS and was told that they were not going to write one ever , and that 3400+ is all the board will ever be able to have , despite the fact that the board is perfectley capable of having a 3700+ , So I was put through to customer services department where I registered a complaint about this .	St
1.1.5	I spoke to Asus Who said that the Board was especially designed for HP and that they will not support the board in anyway ( It 's missing from their website too ) and that BIOS Updates e.t.c are all responsibility of HP .	St
1.1.6	Machines using this board are rather popular , so if anyone here has one , even if you dont plan to upgrade to 3700+ , please complain , in hope that if enough people complain they may actually write one , surley It cant be that hard .	St
1.1.7	This is nothing more than a money making scam , if you dont feel your going fast enough , you have to buy another HP Machine .	St
1.1.8	I ask that there are no replies from enthusiasts with Customised machines spouting that Dell , HP and Compaq are crap , and this is what we get for buying them .	St
1.1.9	Many people , including myself , buy these machines for their reliability , cheapness and simplness , but would like an upgrade path , and I am sure many people must have machines with this board .	St
1.1.10	Also , and this is a huge request , is there anyone out there with experience of writing Biose 's or anything like that who can modify the BIOS and unlock the board from the shackles of HP ?	Ques
1.1.11	I know some People write overclocking BIOSES , so can they be done by home users , who are very knowledgeble in these things ?	Ques
1.2.1	machines .	St
1.2.2	The only way that they can hold costs down and to keep tech support costs to a minimum is to not support every possible upgrade , and then have to create documentation and training material for their tech support .	St
1.2.3	if you have ever worked on Military equipment you would realize that , by far , the biggest cost item of the equipment is the documentation , drawings and manuals , so that people can maintain it .	St
1.2.4	You are are correct about someone possibly modifying the BIOS .	St
1.2.5	In fact if you can get the code for the normal ASUS mobo of the same bent , the needed code may be found in it and [ with some skill ] added to the HP BIOS .	St
1.2.6	They simply purchase the basic BIOS code and then modify it to their own needs .	St
1.2.7	It may simply change the CPUID number .	St
1.2.8	You ca n't have both cheap and a versatile , upgradable system .	St
1.2.9	Something has to give .	St
1.2.10	BTW , just dealt with HP site and tech support .	St
1.2.11	Was totally satisfied .	Polite
1.3.1	Yes they are Nice People , They registered my complaint without any problems .	St
1.3.2	The Board is closest to the Asus is the a7v8x-LA , which I presume they do offer a BIOS for , is there anyone ith alot of skill out there that can make this work ?	Ques
1.3.3	But my point is they should not be allowed to restrict hardware , I paid 800 fo a computer with a Socket 754 Motherboard , which means it can have upto 3700+ , and I am going to get it one way or another with HP 's help or not .	St
1.3.4	Im just begging if there is anyone out there who can write bioses , can they please help poor hp owners ?	Ques
1.4.1	in the subject line .	St
1.4.2	He is a very bright and knowlegeable in these areas .	St
1.5.1	Will Do when I get a free moment	St
1.6.1	likely assist you MUCH CHEAPER than you could hope from me .	St
1.6.2	Going along with Ray 's Military analogy , another cost factor is the limited production of military specific components -- thus a $ 20.00 bolt for an Abrams Tank .	St
1.6.3	If they have what you want & quot ; in stock & quot ; it is as little as $ 25 .	St
1.6.4	If they do n't it can be more .	St
1.6.5	http : //www.badflash.com/	St
1.7.1	Well , theyre in my bookmarks list now , While Im at it Ill think Ill throw in some RAM dividers and alot of other settings HP seem to hve & quot ; Forgotten & quot ;	St
1.8.1	www.mrbios.com used to do such things .	St
1.8.2	I have n't checked recently .	St
1.8.3	My parting comment is such machines as & quot ; in a box & quot ; and there is nothing wrong with HP not offering such .	St
1.8.4	Bob	St
1.9.1	There is a good reason HP does n't bother to upgrade their BIOS .	St
1.9.2	You are the exception , not the rule .	St
1.9.3	The vast majority of HP/Compaq/Dell owners never open the cases of their systems , much less upgrade the processors .	St
1.9.4	There is so little demand that they do n't have the need to upgrade , it makes no financial sense to them , since most users will keep the systems for 3-5 years and just replace them .	St
1.9.5	The reason you got the BIOS update you did get was only because the same model board was sold with a faster processor , but the next generation with the faster processor undoubtedly used a different board , so that was the end of the line .	St
1.9.6	You hit the nail on the head when you said , & quot ; do n't tell me about your upgradable system & quot ; .	St
1.9.7	The fact is , people that build their own and are tinkerers are those the upgrade and want upgrades , not the canned system buyers .	St
1.10.1	and I agree that HP is well within their rights to decline investing in any more BIOS updates .	St
1.10.2	Matter of fact they seem to be right in line with most main board suppliers with their & quot ; cut off & quot ; .	St
1.11.1	Yeah , I guess your right , but MR.BIOS is onto it , So it looks like I might be able to sort this !	St
1.12.1	My understanding is that at least some of the pc 's hp is selling with that board have a very meager powersupply ( only 250 watts ) I do n't know if I would trust a 3700+ on such a system ( I do n't know how hp gets even the 3400+ to work with it unless they are using a custom , mobile or crippled processor ) without upgrading the psu as well and while you are at it replace the graphics card and this and that ... You would be better off getting a complete new 939 system before making such an upgrade .	St
1.13.1	Here is my 2cents on proprietary .	St
1.13.2	My Compaq EVO W4000 CMT pent.4 workstation with 2-80 gig hard drives & 2- Optical drives & a gig of ECC DDR ram 2-90mm case fans 90mm psu fan , & cpu fan .	St
1.13.3	2-monitor Nvidia AGP video card .	St
1.13.4	All this is driven by small 250 watt power supply that is odd size ( non ATX ) lasts about 10 months & costs about $ 300.00 delivered from H-P. Also the Propietary CPU heat sink fan is like a socket A only smaller .	St
1.13.5	I have went through 3 of them at $ 70.00 apiece .	St
1.13.6	Standard socket 478 is way too wide & no side mounts .	St
1.13.7	Only strap down middle like socket A .	St
1.13.8	This is suppose to be heavy duty workstation .	St
1.13.9	CPU always runs hot .	St
1.13.10	Am thinking about 60-80mm fan adapter to put on top of this small heatsink .	St
1.13.11	60mm fan on 2.8 Norwood is not enough fan .	St
1.13.12	The price of these weak undersized components is unreal .	St
1.13.13	The PSU could have been made Standard ATX .	St
1.14.1	have you noticed the dates of the thread that you replied to ? ?	Ques
