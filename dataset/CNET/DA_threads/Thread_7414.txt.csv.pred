1.1.3	I am able to access the internet with all three pc 's now .	St
1.1.4	BUT , I am unable to receive email using Outlook express or Outlook , I always used both O .	St
1.1.5	Express and Outlook before , but now I can only send using them .	St
1.1.6	I am still able to receive emails if I go to Adelphia 's website , and I put my emails forwarded to my gmail account , and I can receive my email thru gmail as well as my gmail , I just can not receive thru OE or Outlook .	St
1.1.7	I get a failed error mess .	St

1.1.11	Neither Linsys cust .	St
1.1.12	serv .	St
1.1.13	nor Netgear were able to help , and Adelphia wo n't .	St
1.2.1	Some email issues were noted with off the shelf routers and the firmware that was in them .	St
1.2.2	Hint : linksys.com has the update .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	did n't do any good .	St
1.3.2	Thanks tho .	St
1.4.1	There are many discussions about this on google , but 1492 seems to be needed for this to work .	St
1.4.2	- & gt ; Please supply what you 've tried so that I 'll know to not duplicate your efforts .	St
1.4.3	If you firewalled it off , installed an email virus scanner or more , this has not been shared so I have not mentioned any solution that involved those products .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	Lynksys tech 's had me set it to that , then reduce it in increments of 20 .	St
1.5.2	If I remember right , I also increased it .	St
1.5.3	I still had no luck .	Polite
1.5.4	This was several weeks ago , then I got busy again with work , and had no time to work on it , just worked around the issue , thus I found out that I could forward to my gmail account and receive my Adelphia account emails there .	St
1.5.5	I really like using Outlook and O Express tho , and would like to go back to using them , not to mention it makes me crazy trying to figure this out .	St
1.5.6	I have AVG installed on all three pc 's , and use Sygate for my firewalls .	St
1.5.7	I have tried shutting everything off even , but did n't make a differance .	St
1.6.1	I 'll keep asking for the revision number you 're at if you do n't mind since it matters .	St
1.6.2	- & gt ; What revision firmware is in the router ?	Ques
1.6.3	Review http : //www.tiscali.co.uk/help/email/oe_errors_0x800ccc0e.html on how to telnet to your email server to see if that works .	Ques
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	Hi Bob , Went to Linksys tech site .	St
1.7.2	Decided to update firmware again ( just in case I did n't last time , tho I thought I did . )	St
1.7.3	The Lynksys tech 's had me doing a lot of differant things .	St
1.7.4	I downloaded the firmware file ( 1.46.2 ) , but when I try to upgrade , it begins to load , then stops , and tells me { upgrade action is not finished .	St
1.7.5	Upgrade file pattern error } .	St
1.7.6	It then gives me the option to browse for the d/l firmware file again .	St
1.7.7	Could this be because I already upgraded the firware a few weeks ago ?	Ques
1.7.8	Also , went to the link you provided regarding the OE error .	St
1.7.9	After typing in the telnet pop.tiscali.co.uk 110 and clicking enter , it says connecting to telnet pop.tiscali.co.uk 110 , and then it says { Could n't open connection to the host or port , 23 : Connect Failed .	St
1.7.10	Using my xp pc , I tried resetting the TCP/IP stack , but that did n't do anything either .	St
1.7.11	Thanks for any help you have given so far , or that you may still give .	St
1.7.12	Diane	St
1.8.1	http : //www.yccc.org/Resources/DXCluster/images/telnet3.gif shows how to run telnet and get that port number but 23 is incorrect and that effort needs a retry .	St
1.8.2	As it stands I 'm not convinced it 's your machine at issue .	St
1.8.3	My question is what firmware is in your BEFRS11 .	St
1.8.4	Which I may have missed your answer .	St
1.8.5	Can you tell me again ?	Ques
1.8.6	- & gt ; As to resetting the TCPIP stack , that 's not a feature of XP .	St
1.8.7	However WINSOCKXPFIX does help recover from some malware .	St
1.8.8	But given I have n't seen the last 2 items completed , it 's a hit or miss whether that would help .	St
1.8.9	Cheers , Bob	St
1.9.1	I 'm sorry Bob , guess I keep misunderstanding your questions .	Polite
1.9.2	How would I go about finding out what firmware is in my BEFSR11 now ?	Ques
1.9.3	As I said , I tried to upgrade to 1.46.2 since I was unsure if I had already done that when Linsys 's tech 's were trying to help me .	St
1.9.4	I do n't know what firmware is there currently , nor do I know how to go about finding out .	Ques

1.11.3	Diane	St
1.12.1	It 's what I have to do next to see if the mail server is up .	St
1.12.2	Bob	St
1.13.1	When I type in the password , I get ERR no domain specified or invalid domain specified .	St
1.13.2	Does this mean that possibly my password has become corrupt ?	Ques
1.14.1	humm ? ? ?	Ques
1.14.2	? lol	Ques
1.15.1	But I have to work now and then and I just saw your post .	St
1.15.2	Cheers on getting to the password but since you did n't get past that , I 'm of the mind the issue is not with OL/OE quite yet .	St
1.15.3	Have your ISP reset your password for that account .	St
