1.1.1	Shortly after my wife picked up a wirless Sony Viao laptop , and decided to share our Comcast broadband with our kids ( using AOL dial-up ) , I picked up the standard Linksys router ( which is looped directly through my desktop in my office ) , and a Linksys adapter for my kids computer two rooms away .	St
1.1.2	The router is the G , four port , WRT54G .	St
1.1.3	After a week of wireless bliss ( kids in seventh-heaven over no more dialup ) , the connection began to intermittently lose connectivity , then with & quot ; repair , pick up again .	St
1.1.4	That lasted another week .	St
1.1.5	From that point on I was on the phone with Linksys every three days , going through complex diagnostics , pinging left , right , and center .	St
1.1.6	Each time they managed to get my kids puter back online ... but it has become tedious .	St
1.1.7	It seems each tech has a different reasoning for why that adapter loses signal .	St
1.1.8	It 's two rooms away , and no brick walls or other obvious impeding structures in the way .	St
1.1.9	I recently read in a pc magazine the glitch could be the 2.4GHz cordless phone , and fax/cordless phone in my office .	St
1.1.10	What do I do ?	Ques
1.1.11	Shoot out and replace everything with 5GHz communication equiptment ... or is there a better router/adpter I can switch to ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.12	Any help is greatly appreciated .	Polite

1.2.1	the Logic is when the cordless is off the base , it will transmit a signal ... also when you do n't use it anymore.. same logic apply ... remove the battery..	St
1.3.1	The cordless phone COULD be your problem , but it does n't sound like it to me .	St
1.3.2	Try moving the phone on one side of your office computer , the router on the other .	St
1.3.3	See if that makes a difference ( same for any cordless phone near the kid 's computer ) .	St
1.3.4	I have heard that the proximity of the phone to the router ( or adapter ) can be a problem , though I did n't experience it myself .	St
1.3.5	If you seem to keep losing connections at a regular interval ( like every 24 , 48 hrs ) , then it would likely be your Router 's LEASE time settings for the internet connection .	St
1.3.6	Presuming that you have a DYNAMIC IP address for your cable modem ( like MY Comcast connection ) , check your router 's LEASE time .	St
1.3.7	Either set it to NEVER ( if that is an option ) , or check for an option to have it auto-reconnect .	St
1.3.8	It could be at some interval close to when you usually have the connection drop on you .	St
1.3.9	If it does n't auto reconnect , you lose connection , and have to restart the router .	St
1.3.10	If it is only the connection to the wireless adapter on the Kid 's computer , it COULD be simply having trouble getting a good signal .	St
1.3.11	That could be phone related , or due to other structures in the house ( plumbing in walls , brick work , etc ) .	St
1.3.12	If the adapter on the kid 's computer is a wireless USB adapter , see if they can move it farther away from the monitor or computer .	St
1.3.13	And change the orientation of the antenna .	St
1.3.14	That might help .	St
1.3.15	The last option would be to place the router in a more central location between the computers , or get an range extender .	St
1.3.16	I say check the LEASE time settings on the router first .	St
1.3.17	Make sure it is either set to NEVER , or check for the option to auto-reconnect .	St
1.3.18	good luck Larry Bell	Polite
