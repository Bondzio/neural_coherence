You can call eMachines about that and see if they'd be willing to help you out, but chances are you'd need to start looking into purchasing a new copy of Windows. Other than that it should be a relatively smooth transition. John P.S. For those wondering, that is an eMachines t6420, not a t640.

Everything else should work. They are however not necessarily interchangeable in the sense that you can install it and boot up your old operating system. You may (probably) have to re-install, so make sure you have the necessary CD's along with any applications. Otherwise look for an identical motherboard as the one you had.
