1.1.1	I live in a fraternity and we set up a network that looks something like this : Cable modem goes to a router ( the router 's wireless is disabled ) .	St
1.1.2	This router then sends and ethernet cord to each floor and connects to a wireless router and sends a signal .	St
1.1.3	Now the problem is that only the router on the third floor seems to be connected to the internet , the other two wo n't .	St
1.1.4	Even when I plug my computer into one the problem routers I ca n't connect to the internet .	St
1.1.5	On the problem routers the internet light is solid and not showing activity .	St
1.1.6	Does anyone have any idea of what could be wrong .	Ques
1.2.1	You did n't tell if it ever worked or if you tried it like I shared in post 17 of our forum sticky .	St
1.3.1	One the other floors , you need wireless & quot ; access points & quot ; .	St
1.3.2	Perhaps your other routers have the ability to act as such but it 's a waste of extra time and may always be flaky .	St
1.3.3	Trade them in for APs and you 'll be better off .	St
