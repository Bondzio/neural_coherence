<s> This is what Graphics Card : ATI Radeon Platinum Edition X850XT : Sapphire : AGP8x : 256 MB ASUS Motherboard A7M266-D -- Dual socket Motherboard with AMD 762 Chipset and DDR DIMM SDram DDR-256-PC2700 Ram ( I got two sticks) I defanately want to use a sata hard drive Antec SX1040B Case -- (Previously I was using a IDE connection Hard Drive -- I want to goto SATAI presently have: I would not mind buying a combo board and processor. </s>

<s> are you trying to keep/reuse those components? </s>
<s> I really need suggestions on a new motherboard and processors that would go along with my existing SATA HD, Graphics card, and RAM. </s>
<s> My range is about 500 to 600? </s>
<s> Possibly A motherboard / processor package? </s>
<s> thanks, nascar4Num9 </s>
<s> if you proceed with this &quot;upgrade&quot;, you'll wind up with a pc that's still behind the curve. </s>
<s> anyway, here's an agp based mobo for $70: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813157115 and a core2duo 2.4ghz e4600 for $120: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115032 since you're willing to spend some money, start from scratch: core2duo 3.0ghz e8400, $180: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115037 4gb ddr2-800, $85: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820145184 ecs 9600gt/512mb, $147: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814134038 gigabyte p35 mobo, $82: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128084 about $500 gets you a top-performing PC. </s>
<s> What im thinking about doing is a serious upgrade. </s>
<s> Performance wise, can I use my sata hard drive? </s>
<s> Also, on my graphics card, is this one that you would upgrade? </s>
<s> Thanks, Nascar </s>
<s> Is the case up to date to fit all new motherboards? </s>
<s> ATX..I assume so? </s>
<s> and the 9600gt is the best bang-for-the-buck video card. </s>
<s> if you add a new case and power supply like the antec sonata iii below for $100, you can try to sell your old pc for $150 or get a $400 tax deduction by donating it to charity. </s>

<s> Ok...I was able to get this old box working and install a new hard drive. </s>
<s> News is that due to its age, my new Arca Sim Racing game will not work....so...im going to take the challenge on. </s>
<s> Im not that up with all the hardware stuff. </s>
<s> The gentelman that suggested the things above I think are excellent suggestions. </s>
<s> What If I wanted to put say another 600 bucks in the deal? </s>
<s> That would total out to 1,100? </s>
<s> If you were in my situation, what setup would you get? </s>
<s> Also, will my existing case support the new mobo? </s>
<s> Thanks, nascar4num9 </s>
