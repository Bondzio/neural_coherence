<s> I have a 6 yr. old COMPUSA PC with a pentium MX2 350 hz chip with windows 98 When I turn the computer on,I get the message&quot;data error reading drive C.

<s> you have a Win 98 startup disk. </s>
<s> I would boot from that and try to read from the drive. </s>
<s> If so, it might be possible to recover some data while you can as it may be that the drive is in a failure process if not gone already. </s>
<s> There are tools to repair the master boot record or reinstall system files. </s>
<s> Again, you need a startup or recovery disk. </s>
<s> The &quot;fdisk&quot; utility on the startup disk, by using the /mbr switch, might accomplish this but I don't remember if the &quot;sys&quot; command works as it did with old DOS originals. </s>
<s> Otherwise, you can try to reinstall Windows from the CD without reformatting first. </s>
<s> No guarantees but maybe worth a shot. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
