hi im having major problems with my router.
we have a linksys wrt54gs, with a desktop connected to it via cable and my laptop running on wireless.
things were ok until a few weeks ago, when my connection started dropping more often (but it would immediately connect by itself a few seconds later).
but now, i cant even connect to the internet.
heres the detail: at first, i couldnt even connect to the router, although my laptop would pick up the signal.
the router is set to have a network key (wpa or wpa ii), so i played around with the connection properties and changed the network authentication to open from shared and left data encryption to wep.
now this time i can connect to the router, access the routers setting and access the other computer, but cant browse the net.
just for ease, ive disabled the routers security mode now.
im running windows xp security update 2, and i have a intel wireless network card 802.11 b/g.
did i mention how annoying this is?
i also had another linksys, the wrt54g, and that thing died on me too a while ago.
and yes, i have the latest firmware.
thanks everyone.
