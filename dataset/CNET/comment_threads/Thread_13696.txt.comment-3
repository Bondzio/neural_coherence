A weak or poor aged PSU is the cause of many a problem.
Since, you've installed new added devices and its already 4+yrs.
old, well you have reached the limit.
It'll actually boot-up under repeated attempts but its really the overall strain of providing all the amps to get the drives going etc.
to pass a point where it will boot-up.
IMHO, as Robert explained I agree 100%, just replace the PSU before it causes some real damage, because if it fails it may take something with it.
Look at a generic 500W or better PSU, name brand being better.
