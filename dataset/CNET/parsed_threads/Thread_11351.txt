<s> My backup pc, which is a Pentium 4, with Windows XP Pro, does not have any sound. </s>
<s> It has an Asrock P4vm800 motherboard. </s>
<s> When I did a scan at crucial.com, it told me that it was an Asus P4v800-x for some reason. </s>
<s> So I am wondering how do I get the sound to work, and can this motherboard with it's current video and XP Pro support dual monitors? </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> Find the driver CD for the board and hope it installs the needed drivers. </s>
<s> As to the dual monitor. </s>
<s> No. </s>
<s> You need another video card. </s>

<s> Thanks Bob, but the machine did not come with a driver CD. </s>
<s> I found the Asrock website, and sent an email to techsupport. </s>
<s> They seem to have drivers listed for download, but it said something about contacting tech support first to make sure they are correct or something. </s>
<s> If you don't know what board you have then that's best to let them guide you. </s>
<s> Found out which board I have, so it's a matter of getting the correct drivers. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
