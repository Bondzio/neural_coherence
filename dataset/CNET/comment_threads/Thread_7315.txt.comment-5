Are you sure it's PCI?
My Radeon 9200SE runs on AGP slot.
PCI is just too slow to run any graphic cards.
Just about all mainboard bios automatically disable onboard graphic processors once it detects AGP slot being occupied.
PCI is a different story.
Your computer probably recognized the card as some kind of Multimedia device, but did not realize it is a graphic card.
Just as machine boots up, press Delete key, and look through the menus.
