i'm trying to decide between two different systems, but can't come to a decision.
i was hoping someone here with more knowledge could help me decide.
the first system, an hp m7330n, is the cheaper of the two.
i haven't been able to find out much about the system, but it does seem decent for the price.
right now, all i'm worried about it a decent media center pc.
the second computer is a dell dimension 5150. this is about 200 dollars more expensive, but it comes with dual tv tuners (a feature that's important and one the hp lacks) and i'm used to going with dell computers.
couple of factors that are holding me back: the tv tuners (dell), i really want the amd 64 x2 (hp), and i hear that hp computers suck (even moreso) if you want to add and expand in the future.
but still, the price of the hp is looking really good to me.
can anyone here give me any ideas?
i don't really play games on the computer, but i intend to more often (sims 2, the movies, half-life 2).
just a few games, really, and i'm not worried about having the visuals maxed out.
i just photoshop and watch tv.
sorry if this is a bother.
