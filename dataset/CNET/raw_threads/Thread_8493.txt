The most bizarre thing is occuring on the computer. The monitor is displaying everything at a 90 degree counter clockwise angle! I restarted the machine and the Windows XP startup screen displayed correctly, but when I got to my login screen, it is twisted to the 90 degree angle. I've never seen that before. Someone have a solution for this? Thanks. chrisusvi

I did that command and it didn't do anything accept scroll up the user names on the screen. Is there something else that I could try or am I doing it at the wrong time. Thanks again. chrisusvi

You should research how to rotate the display so you can set it like you want. The key combo has proven easy for some and others just can't do it. I can't explain why.
