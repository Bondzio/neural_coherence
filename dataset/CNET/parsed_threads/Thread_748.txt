<s> Hi Guys, I recently got one very old configuration P4 machine. </s>
<s> It contains 512MB RAM card, as checked by me. </s>
<s> The problem here is, in system properties it shows only &quot;96MB of RAM&quot;. </s>
<s> I didn't find any configuration in BIOS(Although I am weak at checking BIOS). </s>
<s> According to what I think, RAM might be faulty or properly working. </s>
<s> if it is faulty the system wont boot. </s>
<s> But here, I am unable to understand the issue. </s>
<s> Pleas guide. </s>
<s> Regards, UV </s>
<s> are you sure that wasnt 96mb for video card memoery, not system memory? </s>
<s> i dont think you can run a os on only 96mb memory </s>
<s> I also dont think that system will boot if RAM is too low as 96MB. </s>
<s> I am unable to make out whether any configuration has been done at the BIOS level. </s>
<s> Because of which I am posting this query. </s>
<s> System configuration is P4 1.5Ghz Processor Motherboard - Mecury - very old model (if you want i can post the model Number too.) </s>
<s> RAM - 512MB SDRAM (obsolete in market) How did i come to know that Windows OS is showing me 96MB - In My computer i checked for hardware properties. </s>
<s> Over there is showed me 96Mb of Ram. </s>
<s> Is there any other way to check the RAM in windows XP OS. </s>
<s> Also Please suggest some solution for this?? </s>
<s> Regards, UV </s>
