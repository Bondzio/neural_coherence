i started a small at home business of taking digital pictures of weddings, family portraits, school pictures and things like that.
i am getting more shoots than i ever thought i would and my amd 4200 and 3 gigs of pc3200 ram is just too slow.
i will be changing the mother board, ram and cpu, but don't know if i should be looking at a duel or quad core processor.
it will be a intel and so far i have looked at a e8600 duel core processor.
also my computer has the built in card reader does that make a difference?
i am using a sandisk extreme iii cf card for the camera.
i am running windows vista home premium and adobe cs3 any advise would be appreciated.
thanks wayne
