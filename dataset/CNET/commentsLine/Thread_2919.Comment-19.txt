i have had two hdd failures.
the first one manifested itself with some warnings flashed up on screen of read errors.
i ignored the first warnings but soon had to take notice, as the frequency increased.
a friend suggested that i buy acronis true image software and back the drive up pronto.
i did this and then made the new drive the master.
i was able to patch up the read errors with various re-loads of software and copies of missing data.
this was a slow and tedious process.
i then installed a slave hdd and aportioned the two drives, primary for software and secondary for data.
i also bought an external usb hdd.
i now back up each internal drive to the other and both to the external drive.
i do this about once per week.
my second failure was more dramatic.
the drive just stopped working.
the only problem for me was the relatively minor cost of buying a replacement drive and installing it with the backed up data restored to it.
