i recently bought a seagate 160 gb external hd to use as a backup.
prior to this i would save any documents on floppies but now with digitial photos and program disks missing (not lost just temporarily misplaced), i wanted to be able to do a full backup.
when i used the xp backup wizard i received an error stating that i could not create a file lager than 4gb due to fat32 formatting on the external drive.
my question is there someway around this in backup; do i have to reformat the external drive in ntfs or do i have to buy 3rd party software?
thanks, rick
