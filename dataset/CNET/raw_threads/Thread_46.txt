It needs to be of the crossover type. You didn't mention anything about that. Crossover cables just reverse the transmit and receive wires going from one connector to the other.

10526	5	333790	2997976	2997749	Steven Haninger	3/9/09 3:59 AM	1.23657114E12	Patch cable and crossover aren't definitive	but I'll presume you do mean the crossover type. I'd not mess with domains because, between 2 PCs, you don't really have one. You have a work group. What you need to do is manually give each PC an IP address within the same network range. This, if no firewalls exist to block traffic, should at least return a &quot;ping&quot;. A standard MS home network would start with 192.168.0.1 and a subnet of 255.255.255.0. You would not mess with the subnet mask but increment the IP address by 1 for each device until you reached the maximum number allowed. You don't need a gateway number because you have no gateway. Your second PC should work as 192.168.0.2 just fine. Assign the addresses, reboot if necessary, give the two a little time to negotiate and then ping one with the other. See if you get a reply.

The cable is ok sincce I have a cable tester. I am using Windows XP p2 I have configured the IP addesses and connected two computers with a cross wire. 192.168.0.1 (dell8300) 192.168.0.2 (dell3000) When the computers are switched on the Local Area Connection icon on the tool bar status becomes connected but I can not see the other computer. I have tried to ping other computer but no avail. Is there something else I need to do? I wouls appreciate for your help kthy2003

Of course you've made certain that the workgroup name is the same and that each PC has a unique name. You will need to set up a &quot;share&quot; in each machine and allow file sharing. You can try to take down any firewalls just as a test and see if that works. If so, you can re-enable the firewall but make the local network an exception. Good luck.

10526	11	333790	3038216	3037828	Steven Haninger	5/5/09 3:35 AM	1.2414945E12	Can you run &quot;ipconfig&quot;	from the command line. Go to Start/Run and type &quot;command&quot; (without quotes). In the box that pops up, type &quot;ipconfig&quot; (again, without quotes). Confirm that each PC shows the address you gave. As well, and just to be sure, check the subnet mask to be see that they are the same...usually 255.255.255.0. Now, ping each PC in turn. If it doesn't work, you should get a return message. It will say something like either &quot;reply timeout&quot; or that the remote device is unreachable. A reply timeout means the address is valid for that network but if it's unreachable that means there is no path to that device. Which is it?

You restart each PC and press F8 just before Windows loads. You'll be presented with a menu of boot options. Select safe mode with networking. Do this for both machines and try the ping command from there. If it works, we have something loading that's blocking the connection. If not, we get to look elsewhere.

On dell8300 I was able to have access to dell300 shared files. So where do we go from here??
