to Robert's always sound advice, I would consider downloading Western Digital's diagnostic tool set and check out the drive.
A utility is included to do a low level format (write &quot;0&quot;s to the drive) and this should make things almost squeeky clean if the drive is in reasonable condition.
I am not sure about the WDs but some drive utilities can, when bad sectors are found, reallocate the space to spare areas of the drive.
Of course bad sectors are not a happy finding and could mean the drive is failing.
Anyway, this will remove any partition information and you should be able to partition and format the drive to the limits of your BIOS recognition of it.
Good luck.
