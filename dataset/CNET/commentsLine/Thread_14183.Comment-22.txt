my wife's brokered generic 486 with windows 3.1, 360 mb hdd which the broker set up as compressed.
do you know how long it takes to defrag a compressed c: drive?
i wasted lots of saturday mornings in the basement doing just that.
and i was backing up my documents on 3.5 inch floppies.
including aol's download folders which included four copies of powertools!
when i had to install a replacement fdd three years later, i bought a dummies book to get through it.
and then had to install a modem card and that was an adventure.
now i am retired and doing pro bono computer repair for elderly (older than me!!)
folks!!
desktop?
wasn't any such animal then!
