<s> I am putting together a new build, (the last one) that consists of ASUS M2N SLI, AMD Athlon 64 X2 6000, 2 GB DDR2, PC6400 Crucial memory, and the ASUS EN7300GT graphics card. </s>
<s> At present, I have WinXP Pro/SP2 loaded on it, but wanted a system that would run Vista in the future perhaps. </s>
<s> My problem: The graphics card presents me with a popup message on boot, telling me I am running with only one card, and if you click the popup, it takes you to an advertisement selling more graphics cards. </s>
<s> There is also an icon in the taskbar that I want to get rid of, but seemingly, it only closes, not goes away. </s>
<s> The third problem I have is that this graphics card does not allow any adjustment of the display size. </s>
<s> It only allows you to move the display up/down and side/side. </s>
<s> This would not be a big problem except that I have three towers feeding this monitor thru a KVM switch, and the other towers have adjustments on their graphics cards. </s>
<s> All the towers are running at 1024x768 resolution. </s>
<s> ASUS response is that there is no way to get rid of the popup, that I should remove the icon in the taskbar setup, and that they do not know about any other way to adjust the display. </s>
<s> Any help greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Hope this isn't too wordy. </s>
<s> But some software problem. </s>
<s> I take it that you ran HIJACKTHIS and investigated each entry? </s>

<s> Actually, it was a poor choice for me to make. </s>
<s> I have RMA'd the card because it did not fit in with my other towers. </s>
<s> Software/drivers, even the updated ones. </s>
<s> The popup mentioned in the initial request was loaded from the ASUS drivers. </s>
<s> When I see adware like that I use HIJACKTHIS and &quot;know&quot; each item or head to google.com and boards to learn what each entry is. </s>
<s> Usually I find what can go and usually stomp the adware out. </s>
