not everything is soley dependant on the cpu.
i really dont care that i have an intel.
my games run fine with everything on high settings and high resolution.
(over 60 fps) EVEN WITH AN INTEL CPU.
i have a very good graphics card(ati radeon x800xl) and my monitor works just fine for games.
so i really dont care for amd.
because i just bought my pc and i am not going to go run out and build an amd system just to get a few more fps.
