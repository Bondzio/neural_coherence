enable agp as the first video search.
it shouldn't help anything.
it just tells the system during the boot to search for an agp &quot;card&quot; rather than waste time [milliseconds] looking for a pci card.
once the agp card is &quot;found&quot; you are running from the agp slot.
ati drivers can give one fits.
i can't help you there.
