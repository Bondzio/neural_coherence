I tried a CDRW from another burner, so that wasn't it.
But waning laser power on the iMac, makes sense - considering its age and the previous owner's frequent usage, deduced from clues he left on the hard drive ;0) I don't need it to read CDRWs, as I only bought it to fix the other iMac (failed power supply).
I just couldn't work out why they behaved differently, given that they were the same spec.
Many thanks!
