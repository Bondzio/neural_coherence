i just bought the coby mp305-2g mp3 player and everything works fine but when i plug it into my usb to transfer songs, my 3 1/2 floppy disk drive keeps checking for a disk until i remove the mp3.
i looked for solutions on the web but haven't found anything useful.
this really gets annoying and isn't normal at all...how do i make this stop?
thanks i appreciate your help!
