I am currently running peoplepc dialup with the accelerator, which is horrible connecting at speeds of about 33.6 average.
I live in the middle of nowhere which makes highspeed out of the question, so I am stuck with dial up until they load highspeed in my area,and satelitte is out of my budget, so I was wondering if there is a device that I can buy to speed up my speed.
I am desperate at this point.
