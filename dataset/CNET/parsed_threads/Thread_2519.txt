<s> When I bought my Canon Bubblejet i560 the guy threw in a usb connector. </s>
<s> After wasting an hour and one half I discarded it and loaded the drivers and other stuff from disc using the big bulky parallel? </s>
<s> cable. </s>
<s> It went flawlessly. </s>
<s> Is the USB cable really to connect printer and computer or for something else? </s>
<s> Many are unaware how to get their USB ports working. </s>
<s> http://www.usbman.com covers it well with BIOS enabling, and drivers you install for the motherboard, OS and more that Microsoft does not do for you. </s>
<s> Today's consumers didn't expect this. </s>

<s> Never had any trouble configuring mouse, keyboard or digital camera upload to USB port. </s>
<s> Can't understand why canon provides parallel and USB connections on back of printer and then it's impossible to set up the printer for USB using their supplied disc. </s>
<s> Even tried web page driver download with similar lack of success. </s>
<s> Now have spare USB cord. </s>
<s> You may not have reviewed the web link I provided. </s>
<s> Many consumers are ill prepared for USB issues. </s>
<s> There's not much more I can offer with what you have written. </s>
<s> And you didn't exclaim &quot;OMG!&quot; with all the USB madness there is with all the chipset issues out there. </s>
<s> Just because a camera works means nothing. </s>
<s> USBMAN sheds light on this. </s>

<s> I just went to your usbman link, Bob. </s>
<s> Didn't mention it but my OS is Win/ME. </s>
<s> Long list of usb issues there according to usbman. </s>
<s> i am also using winME and my new canon printer didnt even HAVE any hookup except for the USB line. </s>
<s> any ideas for me? </s>
<s> A repeating issue for Windows owners is that USB doesn't mean it works. </s>
<s> http://www.usbman.com covers most reasons, but here's the two I see a lot. </s>
<s> First the USB ports must be enabled in the BIOS, second many machines require motherboard or USB drivers that are not supplied by Microsoft. </s>
<s> A new annoyance is that Microsoft offers a driver through Windows Update that is inferior to what the vendor/maker offers. </s>
<s> With what information you supplied, only this generic advice can be offered. </s>
<s> You have to research USBMAN because I don't duplicate web content in the forums. </s>
