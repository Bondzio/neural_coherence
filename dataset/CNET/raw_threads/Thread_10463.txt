For years, if I try to enter a game without letting the machine run for 10 minutes, the video goes into pyscho colors mode and I have to reset. Temperatures are fine within case and CPU. Suspecting the 300W PSU, I upgraded to a good 400W with no change. Downloaded latest NVidia drivers - no change. I swapped with video card with another (GeForce 256) in another older PC and both PCs work fine. So, I believe I have some quirky compatibility issue between the MB and the Ti4200. I would like to get a 6600GT card but would I be throwing away money since the MB only supports AGP 4X?

You can research the terms BAD MOTHERBOARD CAPACITORS to see this issue, but the symptom is consistent with bad caps. Bob

After switching video cards in my two PCs, the problem reared its ugly head again on the PC with Ti4200 card. I guess its time to buy a new one.

Updated BIOS and northbridge drivers and thoroughly cleaned the Ti4200 Nvidia drivers. New board works until I try to play video using Windows Media Player (video all green) or games like Battlefield 1942 or Half Life2, where the graphics are viewable but messed up (color and images). I tried the latest Nvidia drivers and now the video goes black when the Windows desktop loads. Any suggestions?

Your issues still reverberate with the usual issues of motherboard caps and too small or old power supplies. Did you try a new 450 Watt or larger supply? bob
