the best way to test cables is to use a known good one.
think in terms of replacing a light bulb.
swap cable(light bulb) if it works, then the cable is at fault.
if not, then you can expand the search for the cause.
int real world its far cheaper to use a new/tested cable than testing the cable itself.
as to finding the cause, at least you know the cable isn't at fault once checked.
