1.1.1	Running XP Media Center , P4 , 3Ghz , 1GB RAM , 256 Ati Radeon X1300 Pro video card , PSP X , Gateway .	St
1.1.2	Ok , when I am trying to work on pictures ( can be 1 loaded into program or 50 pics ) the system starts slowing down badly .	St
1.1.3	My other system is a slower computer and can fly through the pics ( 1GB RAM , 128 Video Card ) .	St
1.1.4	I am just not sure why the faster system is slower , any help would be greatly appreciated .	St
1.2.1	sounds like you have either a driver conflict fault or , a driver problem , have you tried different versions of the driver ?	Ques
1.2.2	are you running a raid setup h/d ?	Ques
1.2.3	try pressing ctrl/alt/del and see what programmes are running in the back ground you may be suprised how much memory they take up !	St
1.2.4	also have you set your bois settings to use your max memory for your vid card , pallete snooping sometimes causes a conflict try turning it off if it has that option .	Sug
1.2.5	i had similar fault when i installed an x800xl , was down to driver/mobo conflict , did you buy the sys ready built or did you build it ?	Ques
1.2.6	more sys info would be helpful	Sug
1.3.1	Have not tried different driver versions , no raid , programs in background are fewer than my slower system ( I run minimal background apps-running about 200-220mb PF usage ... msconfig ... ) .	St
1.3.2	Yes it is amazing how much memory is used , however My older system handles up to 850mb PF usage , ( not sure if the PF is a good tell tale , but it is something I can go by ... lol ) new system slows and & quot ; thinks & quot ; at about 350mb PF usage .	St
1.3.3	Video Bios settings have been taken care of -- -256 , not sure what pallette snooping is .	St
1.3.4	Ready built system , I added vid card .	St
1.3.5	intel 915G socket 775a ... .I think it is & quot ; A & quot ; onboard video , sound , etc .	St
1.3.6	I disabled onboard vid in BIOS when I installed card .	St
1.3.7	I am thinking it may b a mobo problem as this is a refurb , or just operator problems ... lol .	St
1.3.8	Going to try resuming onboard and see if maybe vid card is bad .	St
1.4.1	such as what software	St
