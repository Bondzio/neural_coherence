support is &quot;famously&quot; bad...so you're better off returning anything within the &quot;no questions&quot; return period if you find any kind of problem.
lemons are usually just &quot;lemons&quot;...and usually can't be &quot;fixed&quot;.
what they usually need is to be &quot;refurbished&quot;.
so, if there's a problem, don't allow anyone to delay you with double talk--just return the unit.
(delaying tactics that cause you to wait beyond the return period are becoming more and more common in the industry.)
tell them you &quot;don't like the color&quot;.
you can also always buy another one later--and no one really cares how many times you do so.
(one of my friends is famous for returning stuff and going back as many times as it takes to get a fully functional unit...always at a super discount.)
that said, sony does make some fine equipment...even if it is a little expensive.
jdm (*btw, their laptops tend to be on the delicate side and overheat easily on ac power.
it's best to run them as much as possible on battery power...and don't drop anything made by sony!)
