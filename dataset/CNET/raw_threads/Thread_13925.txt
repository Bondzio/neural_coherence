Before my trusty roommate was shipped off to Iraq, I bought his router so now I have two exactly same routers, the Linksys WRT320N. Both units are still using oem firmware. I have been searching online to find out how I can use both in my network. I would like to use one for G network at 2.4mhz and another for N at 5mhz. The information I found online is very technical and for a noob like myself, little hard to follow. Can anyone here give some pointers on how to set up my network? I have been researching online for the past week or so and I am still confused...

Is this the link you are referring to in your post? http://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/965 If so then how many routers can I daisy chain in this manner? Can I add a third router as a access point? So, Linksys #1 N @ 5mhz Linksys #2 N @ 2.4mhz Airlink #3 G @ 2.4mhz Would this set up be possible without too much interference? Or should I just drop the Airlink and focus on the two Linksys? Thank you once again Bob..Looking forward to your reply..
