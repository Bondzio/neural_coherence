I have Charter internet and I have been losing internet connectivity so I decided to go with Bellsouth DSL thinking it was Charters problem. Well when I was ordering Bellsouth DSL online they have a tool to see if your computer meets the requirements. My computer passed everything except networking. I got this message (malfunctioning nic found.) What does this mean? Is this why I am having internet trouble? It is a Gateway computer running windows xp service pack 2. The computer is about 2 years old.

Why not replace it? http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=FA331-BULK-R&cat=NET is 4 bucks. I see them on the shelf at not much more. Finding out why will likely take a few hundred buck trip to a repair counter. Bob

Just disable the build-in nic before so. It's easier to replace and as it was called a bad unit, it pretty much suggests what problem you had before as that's your link to the outside world. Rerun the test after the install and check results. tada -----Willy

They told me to back up anything I don't want to lose and they said I will most likely have to reinstall the operating system. How do I do all of this? They are coming Tuesday and I can't figure out how to backup anything! As for reinstalling the operating system, are they talking about the recovery disks you make when you first run your new computer? That is all I have, recovery disks.

I thought I was posting a link with the lowest price listed first, but now I realize that my browser cookie was determining that and not the search criteria I used. Thanks, Bob! Inexpensive and a relatively easy install. Hard to beat that fix.

Unless, there's some magical nic involved(i don't think so), that tech is way off on replacing nic via the mtrbd.. In most cases you can disable the onboard nic, install a new nic and go from there. As for recovery or any back-up it just worth the money to buy a decent back-up s/w and proceed to do so. Visit any local or online vendor and buy one. Good s/w will back-up to just about any media, like CD, DVD, tape, and/or other HD or NAS drive(if applicable). The recovery itself usually refers to the OS re-install disks, sometimes called restore disks. tada -----Willy
