i have two computers hooked up to a 4-port hub, which has a internet hooked up to the uplink.
both computers access the internet fine, but neither can share files or printers.
i know that more needs to be stated for anyone to help me, so here it is.
both are running mcafee personal firewall plus in which i have made sure that all traffic on the lan is trusted, as well since i've noticed each computers ip's are not within the same range, i've added them in as a rule to accept traffic from each's specific ip.
windows firewall has been turned off on both as well.
now almost certain the problem lies in the fact that the ip's that were given from my isp are not within the same range, but i'm not an expert on the subject though i am quite knowledgable in terms of computers.\ so with that said, the ip numbers given would be: computer1 - a .
b .
c .
d computer2 - a .
b .
e .
f so the first two sets of numbers are identical, the third and fourth are not.
my understanding is that to work when using a hub the ip's must be within the same range.
a .
b .
c .
anything; is this correct?
or is there anyway for me to get this working?
p.s.
upon setting up internet access in the xp wizard i selected the 3rd option - 'directly or through a network hub' and printer and file sharing was selected.
