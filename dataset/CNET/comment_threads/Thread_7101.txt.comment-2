Of course, this will cause it not to boot.
I would ask what you used to format the drive and why?
All you should really need is your CD of Windows to install the OS.
You need to set your BIOS to look to the CD ROM drive as the first boot device.
Insert the ME CD and restart the PC.
Presuming you have a genuine full version of Windows ME, that should be all you need.
It's an upgrade version, you need to be prepared to present a qualifying upgrade disk at the appropriate time.
Hope that helps.
