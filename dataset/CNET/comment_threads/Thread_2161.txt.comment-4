I forgot to say its these specs: Gigabyte DS3 Mobo Intel core 2 duo e6300 Ati x1900GT 2GB Crucial Ballistix DDR2 667MHz And my cooling, apart from the psu, is a 12cm fan for the exhaust, 12cm fan at the front for intake, and a 25cm side intake fan.
As to your question, there is no blue screen or anything, it just suddenly turns off and reboots.
Any idea what bios etting could cause this?
