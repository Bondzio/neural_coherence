<s> I had a computer program (Maxblast 3) that suggested my main HD was going bad. </s>
<s> I replaced the &quot;C&quot; Drive with a larger one. </s>
<s> I had to FDISK the new drive, then I reloaded the system Software - Win 2000. </s>
<s> The new OS works fine. </s>
<s> The second HD is now recognized as a FAT 16, 33GB drive though it was originally set-up as NTFS and has a Western Digital 250GB HD. </s>
<s> It seems that the FDISK command passed to both HDs, making the second one not usable. </s>
<s> Now what can I do? </s>
<s> I would prefer to not format the second HD - lots of data & picture files. </s>
<s> Is there a way that I can force the disk to be recognized as original?? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>

<s> Windows 2000 has a native partitioning tool which you can upset by introducing DOS FDISK. </s>
<s> I would have booted the Windows 2000 CD and installed from that. </s>
<s> Natively. </s>
