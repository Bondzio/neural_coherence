<s> I work out of my car often and am in need of a very small printer(for 8.5x11 paper) that puts out good quality and won't break the bank. </s>
<s> anyone out there have any suggestions as to which ones i should look at? </s>
<s> Plainly put there aren't that many to choose from. </s>
<s> HP and Canon offer some models for mobile or portable use. </s>
<s> These easily attach to a laptop. </s>
<s> Just google using those keywords, &quot;mobile or portable printer&quot; and review them. </s>
<s> Of course, whatever you get usually isn't made to output reams of paper, so typical small usage is advised or wait for heavy demands. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
