1.1.1	Hi , I was in Canada for three days and routinely used the internet on roaming which approximately costs $ 0.015/kb .	St
1.1.2	I routinely can use approximately 20Mb of data per day in domestic use .	St
1.1.3	However , the un-billed data usage shows me usage to the tune of 151400KB and likewise totaling to approximately 300Mb over few hours spread over three days which is worth a charge of $ 4500 .	St
1.1.4	Can someone help me with the answer as to how can such a data usage can occur with normal internet usage ( mails and hotel bookings and wiki and NO movie or song downloads ) even when I can only normally use 20-30mb of data in a full day domestic usage .	St
1.1.5	I am pretty sure that this can not be my data usage .	St
1.1.6	Is there any problem with the device or can someone else hack and use the device .	Ques
1.1.7	Or there are any other technical errors on the part of the service provider .	St
1.1.8	A call to the customer service tells me that they can verify if the data originated from my device .	St
1.1.9	However , still I would be sure that I can not use so much data within such a short span of time on a meager usage .	St
1.1.10	How should I approach this problem and what are my options .	St
1.1.11	Please help with the answer .	St
1.1.12	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	It sounds like you have little recourse other than politely admitting your usage , since they have it documented .	St
1.2.2	It does n't take much to get up to 300MB these days w/ 3G/broadband .	St
1.2.3	Try to bargain with them to reduce the cost of the bill by offering to add an international data plan for a year if they reduce your bill .	St
1.2.4	I know you do n't want to pay but if you go this route you 'll net ahead vs forking over the entire $ 4500 .	St
1.2.5	In general , I would n't expect much leeway if your calculations are correct as to how much you used since you knew the rate per kb prior to travelling with a laptop .	St
1.2.6	Best of luck .	Polite

1.3.1	I dont mind paying anything that is authentic .	St
1.3.2	I never have any problems with my credit history or otherwise .	St
1.3.3	I knew the rates and I was well aware that I was on roaming .	St
1.3.4	And this was not my first experience with roaming and wireless- Yes !	St
1.3.5	but the first time when I feel so of the undue excess .	St
1.3.6	What I feel though is that- there is some error ( software or otherwise ) - and my question lies only on the possibility of the existence of such an error on part of the service provider .	St
1.3.7	Data usage occurs on the kind of usage I am making .	St
1.3.8	3G help me open my email faster but I presume does not increase the data usage for that respective email .	St
1.3.9	If I am using 20mb daily in USA and then the next day for similar usage I use 200mb in Canada ... ..I dont understand that .	St
1.4.1	I would consider that a possibility over a three day period .	St
1.5.1	I believe your concern is well placed .	St
1.5.2	I travelled out of the US to Vancouver for 36 hours .	St
1.5.3	Careful to make few phone calls and text messages .	St
1.5.4	Unfortunately , my iPhone was set to automatically check in to data network .	St
1.5.5	AT & T said I used 614MB of data during the 36hours and that I owe them $ 6140 .	St
1.5.6	They cut my data service off this morning .	St
1.5.7	I have heard that there is a consumer protection law that allows a one time pass for unfamiliar use and excessive bills for wireless service .	St
1.5.8	Does anyone know of this ?	Ques
1.5.9	Any other ideas would be helpful .	St
