1.1.1	Hey everyone , I just bought a new mouse ( logitech MX610 ) , and installed the Setpoint software .	St
1.1.2	The MX610 has several buttons on it ( volume up/down/mute , forward/back , email , IM , scrollwheel ) and everything works when i click it but for some reason the lights on the email and IM buttons never light up .	St
1.1.3	they 're supposed to light up when i have mail or an IM , but they dont .	St
1.1.4	i know this sounds dumb but i was just wondering if anyone has had this problem or knows how to fix it .	St
1.1.5	I reinstalled Setpoint several times and have messed with the settings as well .	St
1.1.6	I cant find any threads on the logitech site about it so i dont know what to do .	St
