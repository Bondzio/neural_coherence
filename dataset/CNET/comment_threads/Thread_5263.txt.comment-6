The RAM is 2 X 512MB.
I've gone straight for swaping the slots and being as sure as I can be that they are seated properly.
I'll leave it a couple of days to see if the problem manifests itself again.
I've also obtained the memtest86 boot floppy you suggest in case I need it.
I'll use it anyway to see what it does.
Thanks for your advice, and I'll let you know if it works.
