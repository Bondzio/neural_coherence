hi , i recently upgraded my hp 6710f for games.
i put in a ssd, evga 560ti, 650watt psu.
the setup ran great for a couple of days.
the stock processor was an athlon ii x 4. i had a deal on a phenom ii x 6 1045t so i grabbed it since it s the quickest cpu i can put on my mobo.
here is the link to the mobo specs:  when i installed the new cpu, on the first boot it freezed on the windows pasword screen.
on second boot, i went as far as the loading of starcraft 2. after searching on forums, i went in the power management options in the control panel and put my cpu usage always at 100% even on 0%load.
since then it only freeze once every hour.
(on a 3 week testing) when it freeze , only the mouse moves but the video is still.
if i m in a game, the music will be stuck in an infinite loop of half a second but the mouse always work.
everytime it freeze, if a wait for about 40 seconds, it always unfreeze like nothing happenned, no error messages.
i mean it never really stopped working , and always the same amount of time of stopage.
it does it at random times, eavy load in a game don t matter.
-i updated my bios and drivers -my cpu meet the 95watt max of mobo specs -temperature of cpu and gpu normal.
-enough power (650watt psu) don t know what to do .
amd support is long to answer.... thanks in advance.
