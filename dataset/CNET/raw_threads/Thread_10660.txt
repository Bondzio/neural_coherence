Please remmber I want COLD and good looks....

Anyways...here are 2 places to start if considering liquid cooling http://www.frozencpu.com/cat/l1/g30/Liquid_Cooling.html and http://www.dangerden.com/store/

3266	12	411836	5006436	5006444	nailzz	10/11/10 9:55 AM	1.2867909E12	Question	I've been setting clocks,my last clock setting I set at 2884mhz and it ran very well,This morning I checked the settings and the clock had changed by its self!! Its now up to 3024mhz self clock,how?why?what would cause this??I'm not worried to much,the system is fine and all the temps went down,this is strange my M/B temp is at 27c and CPU is at 32c after running a load max temps hit 34c M/B 40 CPU @ clock of 2884 any ideas as to why the clock speed went up on its own!!!!
