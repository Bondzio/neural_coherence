<s> Hi, i just bought a Samsung SyncMaster 710N. </s>
<s> Everything with this monitor is quite satisfieing to me, but there is a big problem: It seems like Windows 2000 (SP4 actually) has a big problem displaying things right through this monitor. </s>
<s> I actually can not really believe that it is the monitor's problem, because i tested it for 45 minutes in the shop before buying it, but that was with a Windows XP machine. </s>
<s> It is hard to explain what it looks like, for me mostly like low color quality. </s>
<s> I made a shot of an icon to show you what i mean, but i can not assure that what you see will be the same as what i see: http://www.spirit-within.net/ee/icon.jpg When i looked at an icon before installing this monitor, it has not looked like a cheap gif,.. it looked like a normal high quality icon. </s>
<s> Now this icon i have taken a shot of, shows a lot of single pixels, it looks raw, it does simply not look like it should. </s>
<s> I installed the Samsung Monitor driver, i have reset the colors, i have auto adjusted several times, i have switched to other resolutions (this TFT's optimum is 1280x1024) and switched back again of course - no change at all. </s>
<s> Some pictures look really bad. </s>
<s> Not like usual TFT quality, they look a bit pixelated). </s>
<s> I launched Unreal I and had a look at the Direct3D performance, same there, strange pixelated graphics and partly unluminated surfaces... </s>
<s> I am really out of ideas, solutions or whatever. </s>
<s> I noticed this problem at a friend's place too, quite the same TFT (some older Samsung) and Windows 2000. </s>
<s> Please do not suggest me to upgrade to XP, i will not do this. </s>
<s> I am running 2000 on a notebook at work and everything is fine, i know it is possible - so please - if you bring ideas, let them be solutions, because there must be one. </s>
<s> Thank you for reading and for any suggestions, ideas, solutions. </s>
<s> Cheers, Leo (ps. </s>

<s> Windows 2000 will install some drivers on initial install but Windows Update will not install drivers... unless you configured it to do so. </s>
<s> My initial question would be &quot;What color depth are you using? </s>
<s> They should look good if you are using 16-bit or 32-bit color. </s>
<s> It sounds like you are using 8.&quot; but... You may need to fish around for the &quot;Show Icons using all possible colors&quot; setting. </s>
<s> I'm not on the 2000 box so I leave this for you to find. </s>
<s> Maybe TWEAKUI could help with that or it's ICON REBUILD tool. </s>
<s> As to drivers, I may have missed what video card you have, but as always, try the latest. </s>
<s> As to Windows Update, I suggest you set it to not do drivers. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I have a 2000 installation running with a IBM TFT monitor and a 4500 3dfx. </s>
<s> Finding drivers for the 2000 installation was difficult as the card is out of support. </s>
<s> I have WXP drivers built into the Win XP installation. </s>
<s> but not the 2000 installation. </s>
<s> I found some third party drivers that worked fairly well. </s>
<s> I installed driver software on a Win 98 platforn and did not have a problem. </s>
<s> Pictures/images were very clean. </s>
