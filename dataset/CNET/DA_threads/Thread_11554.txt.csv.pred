1.1.1	I am a law student, and I happen to be living in an apartment across the street from the (wireless) law library.	St
1.1.2	I'm fully permitted to access this signal.	St
1.1.3	I have an HP laptop with internal wireless antennas.	St
1.1.4	I can kind of pick up the wireless signal standing in my parking lot, but once I'm inside my unit, it's completely gone.	St
1.1.5	Today, I went to CompUSA and bought the Hawking Hi-Gain USB Dish Adapter.	St
1.1.6	It works, but only so-so.	St
1.1.7	The signal I'm getting is weak, and I have to leave the dish hanging out of my window.	St
1.1.8	I can't use this permanently.	St
1.1.9	What kind of hardware do you guys recommend for me to get?	St
1.1.10	There has to be something more high-powered than the little desk-top dish that I bought.	St
1.1.11	I'm thinking along the lines of those big RV antennas because they can be left outside in rain, heat, and snow.	St
1.1.12	Is that overkill?	St
1.1.13	Is there a brand or a product you have experience with that you can recommend?	St
1.1.14	Thank you all for any advice you can give!	St

1.2.1	You've done what you can but unless you build your own such as a link I'll provide you have reached the end of what you can buy.	St
