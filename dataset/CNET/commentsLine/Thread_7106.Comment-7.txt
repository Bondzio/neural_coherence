the dell printer have a little tab that prevent the ink holder from locking with a lexmark cartridge.
i cut off the tab and i am running with a lexmark cartridge just fine.
its stupid cos the cartridges are all the same price (40 dollars cdn)...what a rip off...i am going to refill it.
they give you a good price on the printer but buy a couple of cartridges and you might as well have gone with something better.
my real problem is: the a960 i cant use as a standalone fax...some faxes just are completely received by the other side although the machine tells me its okay dell sux - lexmark sux --- all a money grab --- no quality
