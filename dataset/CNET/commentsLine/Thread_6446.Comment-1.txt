my cd-rw by msi has quit working reliably on my home computer.
it will write sometimes; will not read what it has written even though i can read it on my cd-rom; and will read a commercial disk (program).
i took it to the repair shop where they connected it to their computer and all worked well.
i'm running win98se, athlon 2400, msi motherboard (6 months old).
i've removed the hardware in system devices and let windows reinstall to no avail and cleaned the laser lens(es).
my thoughts now are to reverse the positions of the cd-rw and cd-rom, try a new cable, and then take the entire system in for check.
any suggestions are welcome.
