my first pc was a timex sinclair 1000 that i used for about two weeks - it was so limited in software and capabilities that i quickly upgraded to an atari 800 with the 410 tape drive (connected to a 13&quot; tv) - it was more affordable than a apple ii and was supported extremely well here in ohio.
i still have these systems (and the atari still works).
every few years i dig out the old stuff and plug everything together to make sure i remember what classic computing was like.
there's nothing like waiting for a cassette tape shamus, blue max, jumpman or temple of asphai to load.
the graphics and sound effects are crude compared to today's games but the hours i spent trying to advance from one level to the next were well spent.
