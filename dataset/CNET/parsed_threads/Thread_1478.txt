<s> Umm, AMD doesn't work with DDR2... </s>
<s> Cool powre supply, i wonder when they make hard drives and psu together? </s>
<s> Wow, an AMD powered video card, that'll be the day. </s>
<s> Suggest, 4400+ instead. </s>
<s> Don't forget windows and arctic silver 5 thermal compound. </s>
<s> I Assume, you have monitor,keyboard, mouse, speakers, printer and have no use for a internal media-card reader or floppy. </s>
<s> Don't forget optical drives. </s>
<s> Also, additional stuff for case cooling. </s>
<s> Other than that it looks good. </s>
<s> BTW, suggest maybe 6800GS, 7800GT, or 7800GTX for video card. </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> For a video card youd probably want to opt for a 7800 GT OC because you can find those online for around 325 dollars. </s>
<s> Also i highly recommend you get one of those new X-fi sound cards from creative. </s>
<s> Its way more powerful than anything else, it has a 3.6 ghz procesor just for sound. </s>
<s> The base version of it goes for around 125. </s>
<s> Not only will things sound better but you will also get higher performance out of your computer. </s>
<s> May i also suggest getting 2 smaller hard drives, like 250 gigs, in a raid 0 configuration. </s>
<s> You'll get much higher transfer rates than from just 1 400 gig. </s>
<s> You can also probably find a 250 gig hd online for a 100. </s>
<s> Believe me you can do alot better on a case. </s>
<s> If you are really pressed for cash,, there are alot of cases on the cheap. </s>
<s> I remembered 2 weeks ago I saw a Thermaltake Soprano for like $80 and that is a great case. </s>
<s> Processor wise, I would not get the AMD X2 4800+, It's expensive and can get the 3800+ for alot cheaper, you save more than $400 if you do opt for the 3800+. </s>
<s> If you do get the 3800+, the $600 can get you a video card. </s>
<s> I say you get the 6800 which is cheap and you can add an second one later on your motherboard. </s>
<s> That costs about $200. </s>
<s> The remaining 400 can get you an 2 optical drives ( there was a sony dvd burner for $60), more ram and I say go up to 2 gb for excellent performance( of course you can go all out for 4gb later). </s>
<s> I haven't done the exact calculations but you should have just enough for a good pair of 2.1 speakers (if you get the 3800+ and the Soprano case). </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> i dont think he has a budget problem. </s>
<s> so he should go with a better processor than the 3800+ and he can go all out on his case if he wants. </s>
<s> and 2gb or ram is not needed. </s>
<s> only maybe for bf2. </s>
<s> ya go with the 3800+ processor but i would not get the 2gb of ram. </s>
<s> also agree about going cheaper on the case i also agree to setup raid 0 instead of 1 giant 400gb hd. </s>
<s> for the gfx card, i would not get the 6800 but get the 6800gs. </s>
<s> Yeah maybe the 2 gb would be alot for right now, but in the future for more demanding tasks, 2 gbs should be fine. </s>
<s> Now I am not sure but I believe 4 512 mb memory stick equals to 2gb?? </s>
<s> is this correct, so in my opinion you should get 1 stick of 1 gb of memory so that you can get the max of 4gb in your motherboard. </s>
<s> About the hard drives, it depends on what you want. </s>
<s> I saw a great deal on tigerdirect.com on 300 gb harddrive for $90, that would be perfect for your budget. </s>
<s> Of course get a better GPU if you can. </s>
<s> I only suggested the 6800 because it is a cheap and a capable GPU, and I believe the 6800gt blocks an expansion slot (or is that the AGP version, don't know). </s>
<s> If you can get the 6800gt or even the 7800gt, you are good to go. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> buy an X-Fi card from creative, mine is so great. </s>
<s> Something like a sound card must be left out for a future upgrade. </s>
<s> Right now there more important things in the budget of $1500 like RAM, optical drives, case, and the list goes on. </s>
<s> The X-Fi is a great sound card because I have it in my desktop and the games work on it like magic. </s>
<s> Sound is great........ but anyways leave the sound card out for now and later it can be a great addition to a pc. </s>
