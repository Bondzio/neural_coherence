Then it would do it again and again until it would almost be locked into the slow speed. I checked to make sure everything was working properly (speakers, all sound applications such as iTunes, Media Player, system sounds) and then went to work on the sound card drivers. I have a SoundBlaster card. I contacted Creative and they told me to &quot;clean sweep&quot; my SoundBlaster Live. I followed the instructions that they gave me. Everytime I reinstalled everything, the problem persisted. My lastest attempt has rendered the speakers completely inactive. The only sounds that I have are the computer's beeps. Device manager says that the soundcard in there and working properly. But, I cannot play any sounds and the rest of the computer shows that a sound card has not been installed. Help! I am pulling my hair out. Thanks

If none, then I suggest further to &quot;de-install&quot; the card, power-OFF, and remove the card. Power-ON and then allow system to finish booting and once done, shutdown. Re-insatll the card(try another slot) and check connections, etc. and power-ON once done. It should see new h/w and allow it to install itself or direct it to the drivers source(make dir/source of latest drivers). It should work or attempt at a better rate. If it doesn't work, either you have a stuffed h/w system or a s/w conflict. Also, too many resources being used by the system, clean/reduce them or try that before any de-install steps above. You may want to check the system services and determine what you really need. Check at http://www.blackviper.com for hints/tips on services. Hope this helps... good luck -----Willy
