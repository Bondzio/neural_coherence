<s> Is there a IDE SATA converter that allows one to designate a disk as either master or slave? </s>
<s> I have a propriety DVR system that requires the disks on the ribbon cable to be designated either master or slave. </s>
<s> Haven't seen one yet that does that. </s>
<s> All seem to be CS or Cable Select. </s>
<s> I would go with a pci sata controller instead (if you have a spare pci slot). </s>
<s> http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=SY-BIR-IDESA-BP&cat=CCD shows you the usual unit with Master and Slave BUT and this is a big one, these things come and go and you need to know one thing I've learned. </s>
<s> -&gt; Set the SATA drive to limit it's speed to SATA 1 or 1.5Gb. </s>

<s> Thanks, I have mailed the vendor to confirm that the device is indeed switchable to designate the master or slave positions. </s>

<s> That's a fire sale, clearance house and support should be non-existent. </s>
<s> Why I think the answer is no is that you may need support and these things come and go and for under 12 bucks you may be asking a lot. </s>
<s> You also may want these to be available today, tomorrow and for years. </s>

<s> you paid arm/leg for the IDE MPEG DVR, may be simpler (not CHEAPER) to migrate to latest SATA H.264 compact models. </s>
<s> Wishing they'd clear FCC certs soon. </s>
<s> Too true, but I need an interim solution until I can get to all the sites (8) and perform the migration, since it took 14 months to set them up the migration cannot be done in time! </s>
