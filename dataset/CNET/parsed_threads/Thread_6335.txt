<s> Seems that each time I need to buy a piece of computer hardware it has changed so much that what I have is no longer available. </s>
<s> I being not a computer knowledgeable person I am looking for a CD/DVD Drive that can read/write to both.Seems that because Blue Ray is the DVD Format that all others are just about off the market. </s>
<s> So I am looking for something that works like a (Sony) Nec ND3540A which is a 16X8X16x or something that had similar reviews as this did when it was available. </s>
<s> As my original CD drive no longer will open and seems to be done so I thought I would upgrade but not being up on much with computers and have use the NEC Drive in the past I am looking for a CD/DVD Drive if you can suggest a decent one with good reviews and is I guess plug & play easy to intstall and work, an internal drive that fits an ATX Case would be good to know and hoping it is decently priced. </s>
<s> I got the NEC one for 40.00 from TigerDirect a few years back but now they don't offer any Sony/NEC Drives not surewhy so what brand is a good one or what ones to stay away from? </s>
<s> I plan on using it to Burn DVD's via a Dazzle Video Capture System with their Instant DVD Recorder Software to convert some old VHS Tapes over before my VCR crashes. </s>
<s> Any information on where I can get one, the brand and model or a link would be nice. </s>

<s> Then you are probably looking for an IDE drive. </s>
