i currently have a raid 0 formation but because of a drive failure want to just install a single 1t hdd.
i've cloned all the data etc with acronis to the new drive and hope to just swap out the old and install the new.
will the pc recognise the single drive or will i have to go into the bios and disable the raid set-up?
