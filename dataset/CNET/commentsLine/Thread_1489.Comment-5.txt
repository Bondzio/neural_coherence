changing the motherboard and adding another card(in this case another 8600gt)isn't the most practical solution, imo.
don't expect leaps and bounds with 8600gt sli.
getting a single 8800gt (oc or not) would be better.
if you really want dual gpu, you could try 9800gx2 which is ridiculously priced or the humble hd3870 x2.
both have 2 gpus in one pcb so it means you can use your old board but getting an sli or xfire solution.
