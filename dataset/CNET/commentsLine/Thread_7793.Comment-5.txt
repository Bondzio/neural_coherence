i haven't used an external drive as i am not having one.
i tried the windows backup and restored it on the virtual machine, but it didn't worked as all the files were not copied by the backup.
then i manually copied all the files and tried it.
this one also doesn't worked.
when i executed the recovery application it gave error &quot;access to file denied&quot;.
so i edited the permissions and restarted the application and this time it stopped responding.
