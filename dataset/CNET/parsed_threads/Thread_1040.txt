<s> I've been looking around for a good wireless headset (incl microphone) to use with my computer for playing games. </s>
<s> My computer is about 15ft away from me, so the extension cable for my current headset is quite annoying. </s>
<s> However, the only over-the-ear wireless offerings that I can find are just headphones, with no mic. </s>
<s> The only bluetooth headsets that I can find are for cell phones and are usually the small in-ear type with lower audio quality. </s>
<s> I have an X-fi audio card and I'd be putting it to waste with those tinny in ear cell phone headsets. </s>
<s> What I want is a quality wireless headset (pref over the ear) that I can watch movies/play games with mostly, but has a microphone for when I need it. </s>
<s> Does anyone know of any product out there that is like this? </s>
<s> The bluetooth route is the way to go. </s>
<s> I have Southwing. </s>
<s> They sound extremely good & have a mic. </s>
<s> They are the around the neck type, very comfortable, & rechargeable. </s>
<s> May be this can serve your purpose http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/webcam_communications/internet_headsets_phones/devices/4226&cl=us,en IMHO, USD 100 is a rip off. </s>
<s> I am an online elementary teacher and I wear a headset (all7 hours) that is attached to my school's PC at home. </s>
<s> Your suggestion will make my life easier. </s>
<s> I use skype for my lessons with Elluminate Live. </s>
<s> My house Vonage/Panasonic machine is 2.4 will this cause interference? </s>
