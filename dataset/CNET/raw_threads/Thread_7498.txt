The others will be used as storage drives. My main uses of the computer are web browsing, games and video editing. I have an MSI K8N Neo2 Platinum mainboard, Athlon 64 3500 cpu, 1 GB memory and am using a BFG 6800 GT video card (nVidia). All of this is running Windows XP. My four choices (actually only three since one drive is a Maxtor External, 300 GB Firewire/USB drive)are: - 80 GB Maxtor D740X (Model 6L080J4) 2 MB cache, 7200 rpm, &lt; 8ms seek time - 160 GB Maxtor DiamondMax Plus 9 (6Y160P0) 8 MB cache, 7200 rpm, 9.3 ms seek time - 250 GB Maxtor Maxline Plus II (7Y250P0) 8 MB cache, 7200 rpm, 9 ms seek time Any opinions are welcome!

Your 80gig shows quicker specs but I am not certain that is correct with a 2meg cache, however. You do want your main drive to perform well. The larger drives are well suited for storage and can be used as backups for other data. I have mine done this way and use imaging software to backup my entire hard drive as a compressed image on larger secondary drives as part of my distaster recovery scheme. In the end, however, your opinion and needs outweigh all outside advice. Good luck with your project.

A bullet at 2500fps and one at 2550fps are both faster than my eyes can blink. I believe some use one called SiSandra which may have a free version. I will let you do the Google search. Good luck.
