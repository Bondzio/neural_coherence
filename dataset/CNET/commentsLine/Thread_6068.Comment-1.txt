the last time i purchased a computer was 6 years ago.
i am ready to buy a new one.
i know that dell, gateway, and apple have done a lot and there has been a lot of tech progress since then.
any thoughts on who is doing it better.
i don't want to do anything special, i just want to play a few games (though sound and speed are important to me), maintain my mp3s, keep track of my bank accounts and credit cards, and write documents and spread sheets when i need to.
i want an os and computer that is compatable with most software and hardware (like cameras, printers, etc).
i don't have kids and kids don't come to my house, so parent controls do not impress me.
i would prefer to use xp as the os due to all the complaints i still hear about vista.
i lean more to the side of pc only because that is what i am used to, but i am open to arguments from both sides.
i heard that new thin laptop from mac can run windows somehow, but i don't have information on that.
if that is true, i would like that in a desktop.
i guess i should say i would like a desktop not a laptop.
i am willing to spend up to $2500 (including a monitor).
your thoughts and suggestions are greatly needed and appreciated.
thank you
