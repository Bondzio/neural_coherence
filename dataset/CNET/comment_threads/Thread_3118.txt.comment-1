Hi I'm looking for a way to set up my home networking so that I can set up a DNS service to mask my IP so that I look like I'm hitting the internet from the US (I'm in Canada).
Basically this service gives me 2 DNS entries that I enter on my router and the service is running.
However, for security reasons, I don't want my &quot;work/personal&quot; data flowing through these DNS entries in case they are packet sniffing for passwords, logins etc.
Would it be possible to set up 2 different routers... 1 for all my personal data to flow through and the other for the media streaming?
I have 1 router/modem (Cisco DPC3825) and 2 wireless routers (trendnet tew652 and linksys E3000) at my disposal to set this up.
Thank you.
