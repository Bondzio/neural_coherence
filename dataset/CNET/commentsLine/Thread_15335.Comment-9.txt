try this: select &quot;run&quot; in the &quot;start&quot; menu, and type msconfig in the space, and hit enter.
select the &quot;startup&quot; tab, and you will see a list of all the little programs that start automatically every time you boot your computer.
by unchecking the ones you don't want or need to be running, you will free up your computer's resources.
you might want to put the mouse cursor on the last little boundary line at the top of the list and move it to the right, so you can see more of the location list for the programs; that way, you can usually tell what they are.
don't forget to click on the &quot;apply&quot; button at the bottome before clicking on &quot;ok&quot;.
see if this helps.
