But let me assume you want to reinstall XP on a clean c:-drive for some reason. The way to do that depends on the resources you have, such as: - recovery partition on the hard disk - recovery CD - Windows XP installation CD - driver CD Without knowing those details, we can't tell how you should do it. All we can say: check the user manual and see what it says about reinstalling the OS. Kees

Alas, the function keys for the BIOS are totally unstandardized across motherboard and BIOS makers. Can you provide a link to the user manual? All I can say: boot from the CD that has the setup-program for Windows XP. Usually, that is a two step process: 1. Check in the BIOS-setup that the PC is set to boot from that device, if possible. 2. Put the CD in and boot from it, without pressing any key. You might need to confirm that you really want it, by pressing Y within 30 seconds. Kees
