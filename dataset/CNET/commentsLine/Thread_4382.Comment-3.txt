look into &quot;sandra lite&quot; to burn-in or test the system.
here's a link:  to get that file but also check there for similar pgms.
or more intense cpu testers.
imho, if the systems boots up and runs well with other pgms., it may not be the cpu at fault.
but, you gave no system details, so support via myself is fleeing.
