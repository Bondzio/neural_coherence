<s> I hope I make sense here. </s>
<s> Last time I was in the market for a new cd/dvd burner, I remember that the market was seeing for the first time drive that could also print onto the disc. </s>
<s> Meaning that you would put the disc in and with a laser or something it would create like an etched image or title onto the label side of the disc. </s>
<s> Am I imagining this or does it exhist?? </s>
<s> if it does exhist do you have any reccomendations?? </s>
<s> I have shifted my publication from a paper printed one to an all digital. </s>
<s> So subscribers will be receiving discs instead of paper. </s>
<s> I want to have a cool print on the disc instead of a paper label. </s>
<s> I would probably need to create several hundred of these discs a month. </s>
<s> If this doesnt exhist. </s>
<s> Can anyone point me in the direction of a printer that prints directly onto the disc and not onto paperlabels?? </s>
<s> thanks so much </s>
<s> ...in two formats. </s>
<s> Lightscribe and Labelflash. </s>
<s> Actually there's a third option from Pioneer, but that drive actually burns lettering into unused sections of the data side. </s>
<s> Looks clever, but pointless to leave huge amounts of data store empty just to get some lettering in! </s>
<s> Anyway the two options that burn images into the label side....here's a good review, amd comparison. </s>
