While I know the 8600 was not known for sipping power the 520 should draw less Watts. Let's find some benchmarks. http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-8600,1585-5.html http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card-radeon-hd-6990-geforce-gtx-590,2912-2.html I'd skip the GT 520 and move up to the ATI 5670 http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/radeon-hd-5670,2533-6.html shows it bested the 9600 and 9800 by quite a bit.
