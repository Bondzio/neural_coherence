<s> I have no idea what to think of this: I have cable internet and a wireless network, and recently, it's been acting up. </s>
<s> When I go to a webpage, I get a delay of several seconds before anything even begins to load, and it's slow at best after that. </s>
<s> But if I go to download a file, downloads are quick and without interruption (500kb/sec on a fast server). </s>
<s> This is entirely confusing to me. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> I'm running a PowerBookG4 1.67Ghz with 1GB ram, which has given me no trouble. </s>
<s> It also happens on two other windows XP desktops in the house. </s>
<s> Could it have something to do with my wireless signal strength? </s>

<s> Bandwidth test at CNET is the same despite location. </s>
<s> Wireless Router is the Netgear WGR614v5 with the latest Firmware. </s>
<s> I'm stumped. </s>

<s> Various ISPs are now updating DNS (servers) to mitigate this issue. </s>

<s> I notice that if I use Firefox web browser, web pages download much faster than on IE. </s>
<s> Try Firefox on the PC's and see if that makes a difference (it's free). </s>
