you would be much better off with the dsl.
you can get a router which allows you to share that boradband you have with up to 4 pcs.
say if the pc's are close, you can share the broadband via an ethernet cable hooked to your router.
there are no additional monthly fees when you do use a router.
you can get a wireless router which allows you to share the broadband to any computer in the house wirelessly, this also allows laptops to connect wirlessly also.
problem is with a wireless router, it has a range on how far it can go.
you can get a mimo router for about $100.00.
in addition if you do get a wirless router, your computers will need a wireless adapter.
a wirless adapter can go for about $35-$40.
you should get the same make as the maker of your router.
the wirless adapter allows you to take the wirless signals coming from your router and allowing you to connect to the internet.
wireless adapters can either be plugged via usb, or a cheaper alternative be installed into a desktop via pc slot.
if you do get a wirless router, get the belkin pre-n wirless router, i have seen it go for $100.
this router is extremelty powerful, and has a very long range, and incorporates tomorrows technology.
remember your computers can be hooked up to a wireless router with an ethernet cord.
