1.1.3	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	To connect the ADVC110 to your Mac , you will need a 6pin to 6pin Firewire cable .	St
1.2.2	To connect the ADVC110 to your video equipment , camera , VCR , etc .	St
1.2.3	you will need whatever cables fit the output of those devices .	St
1.2.4	Digital ( DV ) camcorders usually have a Firewire cable , ( aka IEEE1394 or iLink ) that will connect to the ADVC .	St
1.2.5	To connect the ADVC110 to your TV , you will need either an RCA cable or an S-Video cable , depending on what your TV will support .	St

1.5.1	You know what never mind I just figured it out .	St
1.5.2	I opened iMovie and it is capturing it for me .	St
1.5.3	Now I 'll just have to figure out how to burn it to DVD .	St
1.6.1	Once you have finished capturing your VHS stuff into iMovie , done any necessary editing and added titles or such , save the project and then share it .	St
1.6.2	Under Share , you will see an option to send it to iDVD .	St
1.6.3	Here you can add menu 's , if necessary , and add a few bits and pieces to make it look like a & quot ; real & quot ; DVD when inserted into a DVD player .	St
1.6.4	Once you are set , hit the burn button and take the rest of the night off .	St
1.6.5	I usually leave mine overnight and it 's ready when I get up .	St
1.6.6	Best not to be doing anything else when iDVD is rendering , compressing and otherwise doing its stuff .	St

1.7.1	Anyone know what software to use with the Canopus ADVC110 to use it as just a video input so I can plug my TiVo Series3 HD directly into my Macbook so I do n't need a TV .	St
1.7.2	Thanks !	St
1.8.1	Theronjames , If you want to watch TV on your Mac through your Canopus , you have two options : 1 ) Use Quicktime Pro .	St
1.8.2	2 ) Use iMovie .	St
1.8.3	You do n't need to actually capture video to your hard-drive .	St
1.8.4	The software will simply show you what is being fed into the computer via the Canopus .	St
1.8.5	For both options , plug your video device into the Canopus , then use a Firewire cable from the Canopus to the Mac .	St
1.8.6	Use whichever option you want above .	St
1.8.7	I am currently watching FOX Business News on my Mac-mini , taking RCA video and audio from a VCR ( which has a TV cable plugged in ) and I am using QT Pro .	St
1.8.8	I choose & quot ; New Movie Recording & quot ; and AT opens up and shows the video signal .	St
1.8.9	The only problem with either of my options is that they do n't give you full screen video like a TV .	St
1.8.10	The TV screen image is controlled by the software and it 's smaller than full-screen .	St
1.9.1	Just google for & quot ; vidi video capture & quot ; and play a little with the program , excelent features , even the wide screen shows can be adapted with this software .	St
1.9.2	I 've another problem , exact the opposite , I want to send my lap top screen to my tv using the canopus 110 , any ideas ?	Ques
