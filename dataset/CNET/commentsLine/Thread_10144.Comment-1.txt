i have got a new 4gb flash drive.
when i insert it into my laptop it automatically display autoplay diaolg.
however, when i plug it into my desktop pc it doesnt display automatically, so i have to use 'my computer' to navigate my way to it and open the files.
this is a bit of a nuisance, is there any way i can re-instate this action on my desktop pc?
strangely, if i insert another flash drive it opens up on both computers as normal!
has anyone any ideas as to why?
p.s.
i am discover that flash drives with fat32 don't have autoplay on my desktop pc, fat work fine, ntfs i am not tried.
