I have an 'old' 19&quot; Dell E193FP LCD Monitor I found in the garage and am wanting to use it to watch tv in my bedroom. Please keep in mind that I am TOTALLY techno ignorant, so instead of the old clunker I have now. When I read things about &quot;cards&quot;, &quot;imputs&quot;, connections, etc., I am lost! I have Direct TV Satellite right now in the bedroom and the tech hooked it up through an old CD/DVD player sitting on the floor. I have the little satellite box on top of the tv right now. When I want to watch tv, I just point the remote at the satellite box, click, and it turns on. I don't think I have any 'speakers' per say to go with the computer monitor. The speakers are now on the 'newer' monitor on my computer. Is there a SIMPLE way to connect this all up or do I have to have tech savvy? Do I need to buy a lot of things? I am debating whether to try it or just give the monitor to my son. Thanks So Much!

I think I know what an &quot;input&quot; does, but what am I looking for? Is is some kind of hole on the back of the monitor? What would it say, ie. a number or letters of some kind? Or is it something the original 'disk' or booklet that came with the monitor would have written down in it? Thanks for the help, you're the only one.

I just this MINUTE walked in my front door from being out of town for 5 days.(In Dallas-now back to New Orleans). Will unpack all the dirty laundry tonight, wash, be too tired and finally get a flashlight and look at the back of the monitor tomorrow...lol. Will let you know about the back asap. Thank You and Good Karma Be With You!!!
