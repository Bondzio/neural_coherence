i think the last comment is a bit harsh.
i see no reason why that couldn't be the problem.
i have a dell, and phoned them and asked them to send the os, which they did.
i did a wipe and reinstalled.
you have no idea how much better it runs now.
i agree that more stuff could have accumulated, but the crap dell puts on there definately slows it down.
i suggest getting the cd's (you'll also need the driver disks) off dell and enlisting the help of a friend to wipe and reinstall.
its not all that difficult, just time consuming.
this will also get rid of any junk thats built up since then
