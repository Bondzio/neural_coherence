Firstly I don't understand why you want to install Vista.
Why do you want to use a lesser OS when you have a superior OS.
The Macbook, *currently* has an integrated graphic card which take s aaway a bit of your Mac's RAM.
For Vista this MIGHT work.
But I am pretty sure that for Vista premium with the Aero theme and all the fancy stuff, you will need a powerful graphic card, maybe even more powerful than the Pro's card.
Maybe the Macbooks will get updated or maybe they wont come out at all.
If you DO need Windows, then you can install XP which is in some ways better than Vista.
