usb adapters are rough on end users.
here's why.
the machine might have usb issues such as out of date bios, motherboard drivers or non-usb2.0 wiring to the front panel.
1. workaround for the front panel.
use the rear usb 2.0 ports.
2. bios and drivers?
update such.
in closing there is a lot of malware out there.
i'm seeing hard failures to the point of a machine not booting after such a device and its drivers installed.
fix?
whatever it takes.
there is no do this to recover a hung non-booting windows (just read these forums for proof.)
what i usually do can't fit in this small space such as system restore, xp repair install, troubleshooting, safe mode, use of ntpasswd to remove items and so on.
the method i use just doesn't fit here and would be a book if i were to ever detail it all.
so recover to the point of a working machine with latest bios and motherboard drivers first.
scan the machine with mbam (google that) and superantispyware then install.
99% of the time that's all it takes.
