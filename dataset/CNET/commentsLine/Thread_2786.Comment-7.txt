asus is a good brand.
they have a reputation in making computer hardware such as motherboards, and they are one of the best at what they do.
they now make computers, so i have nothing but high expectations from their computers as well.
they know their stuff.
i would choose an asus computer over hp/compaq, dell, acer.
they are all garbage.
hp and dell are so bad!
source(s): i have done computer repairs for a while, hp and dell are so bad
