<s> WE HAVE A IN HOME WIRELESS NETWORK USING A D-LINK DI-624 ROUTER (wireless G). </s>
<s> THE SIGNAL INTO OUR GAME ROOM IS TOO LOW TO RUN OUR XBOX360 LIVE. </s>
<s> IN THAT ROOM, WE HAVE ENOUGH OF A SIGNAL TO MAKE THE INTERNET CONNECTION BUT THE SIGNAL IS JUST TOO LOW TO RUN THE GAMES. </s>
<s> WHEN WE MOVE THE XBOX UP INTO THE SAME ROOM AS THE ROUTER, THERE'S NO PROBLEM. </s>
<s> MY FIRST OPTION IS NOT TO UPGRADE THE ROUTER AND HAVE TO REINSTALL NEW WIRELESS CARDS IN MY 3 CONNECTED COMPUTERS. </s>
<s> HOWEVER, I'VE READ SEVERAL POOR REVIEWS OF SIGNAL BOOSTERS. </s>
<s> ANY SUGGESTIONS? </s>
<s> THANKS </s>
<s> Raise the router above furniture level, relocate cordless phone, video sender etc away from computer or router. </s>
<s> Try changing channels -- the different frequencies they represent work better or worse in different environments. </s>
<s> If you detect neighbouring wifi, move to a channel at least 5 stops away. </s>
<s> Seems to be a good candidate for power line adapters. </s>
<s> A little pricey, but it's a good alternative if you absolutely don't want to run a wired connection to your XBox. </s>
<s> Netgear and DLink are a couple of manufacturers, but you may want to stick with DLink for compatibility. </s>
