1.1.1	I'm thinking about building my own computer (basically, a new MOBO, CPU, RAM and PS), and basically want to just move everything over from the old one (DVD Drive/ CD-RW).	St
1.1.2	But, would it be possible to move the old HD (with OS and programs on it) over to the new MOBO and have it still work, or would I need a new/blank HD?	St
1.2.1	There is a tried and true method of moving W98, but you have to be very comfortable around computers to feel confident enough to do it, as it takes editing the registry.	St
1.2.2	As I cite below in a method to use WXP full to keep your settings, part of the method can be used to stop at W98.	St
1.2.3	(See the next attachment.)	St
1.2.4	Norm	St
1.3.1	Coming from Windows 98 to Windows XP, you would want to bring the old files and settings from the W98 disk to the WXP disk.	St
1.3.2	Many schemes are available to do this in the form of new software and of course Windows XP file transfer.	St
1.3.3	You could buy an upgrade version of Windows XP and do the trick but you would be left with that crippled copy.	Sug
1.3.4	Buy a full version of Windows XP and do the following.	St
1.3.5	1.	St
1.3.6	Clone a copy of your Windows 98 disk to another disk using GHOST.	St
1.3.7	Take the Ghost copy of the disk and install it in your computer.	St
1.3.8	Fire the computer up, and holding down the f8 key, go into Safe Mode.	St
1.3.9	In safe mode, bring up the registry by hitting the start button, click on run and type regedit in the box and hit enter.	St
1.3.10	This brings up the registry.	St
1.3.11	Find the ENUM key under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.	St
1.3.12	At the top of the box find edit and either delete the ENUM key or rename it.	St
1.3.13	It is best to rename it in case you have to go back.	St
1.3.14	This action wipes out all of the hardware knowledge of your drive, so that Windows XP will find the hardware and assign the proper drivers to it.	St
1.3.15	If you are going to use the same disk and hardware for the Windows XP, then you do not need to use the ENUM trick.	St
1.3.16	Skip to step 2.	St
1.4.1	2.	St
1.4.2	Obtain a copy of Windows XP update from a friend.	St
1.4.3	You are going to use it as a temporary measure to maintain your files and settings.	St
1.4.4	Run the borrowed copy on your machine, putting in the required Serial Number when asked.	St
1.4.5	Fire up your machine and install the borrowed upgrade copy.	St
1.4.6	After Windows is finished and everything looks good, insert your Full copy of Windows XP in the CD while you are still in Windows.	St
1.4.7	Move to the CD under My Files and open your copy.	St
1.4.8	The screen will give you a choice.	St
1.4.9	Choose to install XP.	St
1.4.10	The screen then will come back and suggest that you upgrade the existing Windows.	St
1.4.11	Do this and you will place your copy of Windows XP over top of the borrowed copy and require your unique registration number (Serial Number).	St
