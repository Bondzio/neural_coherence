<s> Hello My wife is using laptop with wireless connection. </s>
<s> She is trying to connect to employer's RAS VPN server. </s>
<s> Connection made but then immediately disconnects. </s>
<s> She is able to connect without problems from a public internet location. </s>
<s> When goes back home after being connected at public internet location, she can login from home. </s>
<s> I have opened firewall up temporarily for her laptop, but it still does not work consistently. </s>
<s> Her employer says the problem is on our DSL router or with our DSL provider. </s>
<s> Not sure, but it doesn't look to be a problem with our DSL router. </s>
<s> Our DSL provider says it is on her employers side. </s>
<s> Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> If only you had supplied the make, model of the gear involved and the firmware versions too. </s>
<s> Maybe I could look into this. </s>
<s> But it's work related so have your workplace IT staff set you up. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> does not allow business use from your home connection and that the VPN is the tip off? </s>
