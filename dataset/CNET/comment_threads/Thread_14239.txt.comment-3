Thanks Pete.
Really took me a long time to unlock these files and folders.
Hours.
Thanks for the heads-up.
Will let you know later.
P.S.
Off Subject: The Ales were good in Manchester, and Heathrow airport especially.
Irish Pub with cream ale.
Just Great!
The food looked awesome.
Should have had some food there instead of on the plane.
Live and learn.
The food on the plane was kind of likewhat is it??
Tasted like that also!
