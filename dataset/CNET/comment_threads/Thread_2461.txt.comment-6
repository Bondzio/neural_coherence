Thanks, I didn't quite specify what I was going to go for in my main message, but will be upgrading it quite a bit.
Also, I have broadband so the onboard 10/100/1000 will be plenty for me.
The changes i'm making to the basics include 3.2ghz processor, 256mb nVidea 6600 card, 1gb generic/Mushkin memory (haven't decided), the video cooling, downgrade to a 120gb HDD, and getting a DVD restore disk instead of keyboard/mouse.
