hi all.
i turned on my computer this morning and was greeted by the new found hardware wizard.
apparently xp decided to stop recognizing my network card.
device manager showed the yellow question mark.
i resolved the issue but my curiosity got the best of me.
i can't help but wonder what happened since i was last at my computer.
i didn't install any new programs or hardware, and don't even use the card.
any ideas?
