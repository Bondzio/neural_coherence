No graphics card, no modding My Usage: Previously: A student PC Now: Web Development/Graphic Designing, Programming, Business Usage (Although current one is not overclocked, I'll be doing that in upgraded one) easy future upgrade OR some good resell value is needed. What I want: (please suggest a type, brand and model in each category) CPU: same (Intel P4 3.06GHz Prescott) for now and quad core by January MB: want to change to a better one which can support DDR2 and quad core processor(and possibly DDR3 compatible) RAM: atleast 2GB DDR2 (will give away current| OR anyway to use it as well?) HDD: minimum 320GB (will use current one as external through enclosure -suggest some good option here too) Rest Yada Yada: will keep them intact as they are very well-behaved Budget: INR 7-9K (approx. USD150-200) Buying country: India Buying time: by end of this month (ie. Oct-2009) ~Have I missed something? Let me know. I'm not completely newbie but not at-all beyond beginner level in terms of Hardware things. I talk software more!

Review the specs of the mtrbd. and buy what you can afford that the new mtrbd. accepts. If you can install older items, do so but be sure they're 100% OK and acceptable. I offer no recommendations as all too often they get tossed arise due to cost or want of a certain brand, etc. I do suggest you seriously consider the PSU that it be more than enough to power the system now and later. tada -----Willy

Basically, if you buy a socket 775 board now for your P4, and upgrade to a core 2 quad in january, you can do it, but you won't be able to upgrade again with the same motherboard a few years down the road. I suggest upgrading both now (if intel, get a core i5/i7, AMD has a better upgrade path with socket AM3). If you don't do graphics intensive things, make sure you get a motherboard with integrated graphics so you won't have to purchase a discrete card. Just the motherboard, RAM and HDD will run you at least $200 (I would suggest getting at least 4 gigs of ram, which will add another $30 or so to the price), ad a decent quad core will be at least another $150-$200. If you are willing to skimp a little on the cores, go for a Phenom II X3 (tri-core), as those are around $110 right now. Never bank on resell value, PC parts become outdated in months, and with your budget, you will be probably be buying last-gen parts anyway. When picking parts, look at the ratings and stick with established brands (MSI/Asus/Gigabyte for MB, Western Digital/Seagate for HDD, Crucial/OCZ/Kingston/Corsiar/Patriot for RAM ...) Make sure your power supply can handle the upgrade.
