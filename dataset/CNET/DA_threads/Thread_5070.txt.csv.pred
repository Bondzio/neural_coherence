1.1.1	Our small business has a Netgear FVS318 Broadband ProSafe VPN Firewall Router ( ftp : //downloads.netgear.com/files/fvs318_ref_manual_14.pdf ) .	St
1.1.2	One of our employees is abusing his internet priveleges .	St
1.1.3	I know how to shut off his internet access completely via the web-based router firewall .	St
1.1.4	The problem is our printer is hooked up to the router and if I disable his internet access , he wo n't be able to print .	St
1.1.5	Question : is there a way to just disable his ability to go on the internet but keep his ability to print to our network printer which is also connected to the router ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks for any help !	St
1.1.7	!	St
1.2.1	but rather a firewall and network configuration.. just a thought , can you filter the internet access using a mac address ( from the router ) ... -- do not include that particular machine mac address -- This way .. networking still available for everyone , and internet access only available for registered mac address..	St
1.2.2	I might be wrong though ... but I know someone that use a linux based gateway server.. where you can configured many things with the ultility called webmin ( ? )	Ques
1.3.1	Write up a company IT usage policy along the lines of intenet for work use only or else we sack you if small company might be easier then messing with configs .	St
1.3.2	thanks Lob	Polite
