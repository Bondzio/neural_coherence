1.1.1	Hello all , I recently built a new machine , basically from scratch .	St
1.1.2	I have been running it for only a week or two , so far and last night I happened to notice that the CPU was touching around 50 degrees C. I remember reading in the manual that it took a good number of processing hours for the heatsink and thermal compound to reach maximum efficiency , but I have to say , I am still a little nervous about letting my CPU get above 50C .	St
1.1.3	Now , keep in mind that I am not an overclocker , nor do I wish to be .	St
1.1.4	My new CPU is an AMD Athlon 64 X2 , 5200+ and Socket AM2 .	St
1.1.5	I am looking for plausible suggestion for cooling within an already well-ventilated case .	St
1.1.6	I use a Lian-Li PC-60USB B2 , with two front panel fans , one back panel fan and a top panel exhaust fan .	St
1.1.7	The proprietary fans for the CPU and the videocard are installed .	St
1.1.8	Any helpful replies will be appreciated .	Polite
1.1.9	Thanks , Eric	St
1.2.1	Visit the AMD cpu support website .	St
1.2.2	You will find what is the temp .	St
1.2.3	range the cpu can handle .	St
1.2.4	Overall , at 50C , I see no harm , but check the website regradless for your cpu model .	St
1.2.5	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	http : //www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/TechnicalResources/0 , ,30_182,00.html good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.4.1	Is the 50c at idle or under load	St
1.5.1	Thanks for the links , Willy .	St
1.5.2	I 'll check out the docs and see if I can find the normal operating temps .	St
1.5.3	VAP , I am using a program called EasyTuner that came along with my Gigabyte mobo to measure RPM/Temp .	St
1.6.1	Max operating temperature ( C ) 55 - 70 The above is what I was able to track down for my particular CPU .	St
1.6.2	When I was watching it on the EasyTuner app last night , I saw that it was hovering right around 48 - 50 C. This was after the machine had been up and running for a while .	St
1.6.3	I had been playing games and running applications for probably a few hours .	St
1.6.4	I guess it is still within it 's safety zone .	St
1.6.5	If anyone has a better suggestion for an app to measure stats , I 'd be grateful .	St
1.7.1	let us know what that says .	St
1.7.2	VAPCMD PS I 've got a an AMD 4800 X2 and it is n't anywhere near that hot ... .it runs under 30c ( 28c now ) at idle with the AMDs stock HS fan .	St
1.7.3	Ambient temp is 70F	St
1.8.1	Actually from what I have read at Intel.. Tempature flucuations are more dangerous than some warmer than normal temp .	St
1.8.2	reading..	St
1.8.3	I would go with a steady as she goes tempature reading.. and not create a PC-environment that caused cold air to suddenly hit the machine surfaces..	St
1.8.4	I have had had High Heat Flags run on my Machine and nothing ever happened..this was with a Celeron D [ 331 ] 2.66GHz CPU..I replaced that CPU w/P4 [ 531 ] 3.0GHz..and of course things run exactly so.. .. Video Rendering is CPU intensive..w/P4 I have no issues .	St
