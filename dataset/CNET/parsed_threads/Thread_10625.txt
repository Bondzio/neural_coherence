<s> in FEAR on xp i got 130 fps avarage without v sync and in vista i got 20 fps. </s>
<s> that sux and im gonna try this right here so id be so happy to turn it off thx for ur help in advance </s>
<s> It's dynamically allocated. </s>
<s> Note the word &quot;available&quot;? </s>
<s> It's not a source of speed loss. </s>
<s> But if you have Vista Aero turned on, you'll find it to use your GPU and GPU memory and the games slow. </s>
