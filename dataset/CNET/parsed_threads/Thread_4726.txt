<s> I'm getting ready to buy a new video card. </s>
<s> In the specs it states the resolutions and the refresh rates ( i.e. </s>
<s> 800x600 70Hz - 1028x720 75Hz etc. </s>
<s> )for the card. </s>
<s> While looking at my monitors manual I also noticed that it included these same numbers (resolutions-refresh rates)and that the refresh rates for the same settings were different. </s>
<s> My question is - which of the two( video card or monitor)determines the refresh rate you see on the screen ? </s>
<s> or how does this work ? </s>
<s> It's very simple. </s>
<s> Whichever is slower and smallest is what you get to use of the two devices. </s>
<s> Example. </s>
<s> At 800x600, your card says it will do 100 Hz refresh. </s>
<s> Your monitor says 75 Hz. </s>
<s> You'll use 75 or less Hz. </s>

<s> Does the operating system have any effect on this ? </s>
<s> Because I was using win98 and the refresh rate was 56 Hz. </s>
<s> I swapped out the hard drive to one with XP on it and the refresh rate jumped up to 75 Hz. </s>
<s> Is this normal ? </s>
<s> OS? </s>
<s> No. </s>
<s> It's all about the drivers. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> My video card is set to 800x600 and my monitor shows that the refresh rate is 35 Khz/ 56 Hz. </s>
<s> Is there any way that I can get a higher refresh rate ? </s>
<s> Isn't this better for the eyes(less strain )? </s>
<s> Just a thought. </s>
<s> If I r/c a blank area of the desktop and select properties it brings me to a screen that applies to my vid card. </s>
<s> If I go through the tabs on that screen I get to a screen that allows me to select refresh rate. </s>
<s> In my case it is set to default which gives me a rate slightly higher than yours. </s>
<s> I have tested higher rates and for my use I do not see a diff, perhaps gamers play with this stuff. </s>
