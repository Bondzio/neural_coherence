1.1.1	Is it worth getting an iPad 3 or waiting until Windows tablets come out?	St
1.1.2	The most I would be willing to spend on a tablet would be $500 and I haven't heard any price ranges on a Windows tablet.	St
1.2.1	If you want a tablet that gives you greater flexibility, go for the windows tablet but note that it may be unable to give you the same performance as an iPad.	St
1.2.2	The iPad is less likely to lag and is easier to use but limits the apps you can get.	St

1.4.3	If you want to shell out $1500 for a slate.	St
1.4.4	But for iPad level ( hardware/price point ) MS has spent a decade proving it can't do a good job in that arena.	St
1.4.5	Maybe when Win 8 has been out for a while, but not now.	St
1.4.6	As for iPad, given the hardware you will be overpaying.	St

1.9.1	For the price the hardware tends to be underpowered.	St
1.9.2	Yeah yeah, the people that buy the unuderpowered equipment all say specs don't matter, but I see the car commercials which talk about acceleration, mpg, cyuclinders etc.	St

1.12.3	Win 8 tablets can do everything that ipad does but ipad cannot do everything that win 8 does.	St
1.13.1	I think it depends on you taste...if you want a high-performance mean flexible lag free machine then choose i pad 3 ....but the problem or sometimes the advantage of i OS is that Apple had kept in a prison or a closed box so that nothing can affect you from outside...you are safe and secure whatever happens .....and i Tunes,and the well flourished application Eco system makes i pad 3 an irresistible choice.... but if u want a tablet with which u can do anything go 4 window 8 tab.....because you have the full freedom over the device...but may not delver the performance by apple`s i pad 3....but don't think that windows is low on performance...it will be equipped with high end hardware.... the choice is yours...both have their own merits and DE-merits....choose the one which suits you the best.... i ______________________________________________________________________________________________	St
