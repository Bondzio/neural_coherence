I know it'll be faster than my single core 3500 overclocked to single core 3800 speed. What do people think of this 45w at load processor? At stock, each core is 125 mhz faster than my current 3500 it meets GTA 4 minimum requirements. I know the cache is only 512, but so is my single core 3500 is as well so i don't care about it. What really attracts me to it is the price, power consumption that will take a big load off my 450w power supply, and if need be, overclocking room to my voltage. My current ASUS AI over clocked processor voltage is 1.4 and it's been stable for 11 months. The 4850e voltage is only 1.1-1.2 volts

My only question is what's the deal with AM2 RAM not running at full speed unless the CPU speed is exactly divisible by 400? When i do overclock the CPU, i will do it so my DDR2 6400 memory runs at full speed.
