i have the driver in a folder.
wen i use have disk it shows an inf file but doesn't show any modems.
i think the problem may lay with having no com port.
when i add a port com3 comes up, which means maybe it wasn't there.
unfortunately, i get a yellow exclamation even after i remove all conflicts.
any help is appreciated.
