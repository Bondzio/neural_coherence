let me share i run into this a lot.
here's the top two reasons i encounter.
1. the usb cable.
i have 3 usb to phone cables in my drawer that work here but not there.
unreliable!
point.
don't rule out the cable.
2. the pc.
if it's a desktop try the rear usb ports.
if a laptop, try each port.
you didn't tell enough about the pc, the os and such.
for example i don't expect this to work in windows 95 to me and same for 2000 and xp.
why xp?
xp came with usb 1.1 support and didn't get usb 2.0 fixed until sp2.
these details matter.
hope other ports and cables help.
good luck.
