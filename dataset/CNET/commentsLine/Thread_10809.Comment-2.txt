he gave up on it after a short time.
he thought he could save a few bucks on ld so bought their pitch from tv.
he said sometimes it would take 2 or 3 minutes before he could even call out.
not good for 911 calls.
they tried 3 different phones.
he also said the line was noisy most of the time.
he has comcast 16/2 internet with an snr of 38.4 so it sure wasn't his connection.
he pulled the unit out and tossed it in the trash.
this is just one case, but it sure kept me from getting a &quot;magic jack&quot;
