@ r. proffitt yes i understand how to insert a card once the computer is already in my house, what i am asking is how should i store the ram (what kind of container should i use) to get it to the store.
because right now the only thing i can figure is to use a ziplock or my bare hands (i don't trust aluminum paper...) @willy hold on, i wrote it down somewhere...&quot;one 512mb ddr400 pc3200u 184-pin ram, and one 1gb of the same type.&quot;.
that's what was in my old pentium iv when it died.
you're saying this type of ram isn't interchangeable?
and i wouldn't be able to pop them into a new pentium iv?
if i'm going to push up to 400$ i might as well wait for boxing day and see what deals show up then.
