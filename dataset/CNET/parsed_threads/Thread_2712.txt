<s> [IMG] http://img266.imageshack.us/img266/4517/editedpcdanger28pg.jpg [/IMG] this morning i turned on my pc, all of a suddend i hear a horrifying roaring noise coming out of my pc chasis: EEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRR FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA HUUUUMMM_HUUUUMMM_HUUUMMMM_HUUUMMMM after a while, i noticed the noise is starting to fade away more and more as seconds passes by, when windows finished booting, i could barely hear it, after 5 mins the noise is completely gone. </s>
<s> but i'm so very worried. </s>
<s> i live in hong kong, it's been raining all week and there are alot of mouisures in the air, not to mention alot of flies and insects flying around, and i didn't turn on my pc for at least 3 days, so i was wondering if any of the above faactors cause this noise, or if it's something much worst. </s>
<s> i checked my 2 chasis fans, they're spinning, i'm sure there's nothing clogging them though, that's all i know and so my main concerns are: - what are the noises? </s>
<s> -are the electricity frying my motherboard? </s>
<s> -if a bug got insde my pc and i turn my pc on, will the whole pc fry up? </s>
<s> -there was a thunder strike this morning, but i turned on my pc AFTER the thunder strike has ended, but still, does this have to do with anything? </s>
<s> PLEASE ANSWER ALL MY QUESTION! </s>
<s> THIS IS AN EMERGENCY, PLEASE HELP ME, PLEASE I BEG YOU PLEASE HELP ME! </s>
<s> T_T thanks for the help. </s>
<s> sounds like the bearings in one of the fans has gone try stopping 1 fan and see if it goes away then trie the other if so just replace the fan </s>
<s> what do you mean when you say: &quot;bearings in one of the fans has gone try&quot; i didn't understand what you just said, so would you please be so kind as to explain a little bit more? </s>
<s> and you also advise me to stop one of the fans or something, i don't quite understand that either, so please explain more. </s>
<s> thanks for all the help T_T </s>
<s> I think what he was trying to say is... You have several fans in your case. </s>
<s> You could have one or two chassis fans, a fan for the CPU, and one or two in the power supply. </s>
<s> What you are describing is a sign that the bearings in a fan are broken. </s>
<s> Try uplugging one fan at a time(while the computer is off), and boot the computer. </s>
<s> If the noise remains, shut down the computer, plug the disconnected fan back up. </s>
<s> Disconnect another fan and retry. </s>
<s> If you are to do this with your CPU fan, DO NOT BOOT UP FOR LONG as it can overheat your CPU. </s>
<s> It may also be that you have a cable that is touching the fan blades (heard the same sound from that situation before) Hope this helps! </s>
<s> I would say to leave the computer off in a storm just incase, but you should check inside the computer for dust. </s>
<s> Try to get as much dust out of the computer as you can, an air can is really good for this. </s>
<s> Dust can heat up the computer a lot but acting like a blanket on the motherboard. </s>
<s> It can also get on wires and create a connection to make a spark and fry the motherboard. </s>
<s> Already asked (verbatim) and answered on 30th May 2006!!! </s>
<s> That's quite a long morning by anyone's clock! </s>
