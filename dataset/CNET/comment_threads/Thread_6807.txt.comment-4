Unplug the computer tower and open the side up.
Lay the tower on its side with the open side up and have the back of the computer facing away from you.
Look at the area of the board facing the farthest away from you, you should see around four slots (PCI).
Now look to the right of the PCI slots, if you see one slot off by itself and a little closer to you than the rest then that should be the AGP slot(most boards only have one).
