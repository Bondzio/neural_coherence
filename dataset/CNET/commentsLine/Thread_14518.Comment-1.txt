last night my processor was killed when my husband reached for the dvd drive button and brushed a screw on the front of the case.
a little blue arc of electricity and he got the black screen of death.
we couldn't get xp to start.
the diagnostics in the manual gave us the bad bad news - our processor is damaged.
i thought the main danger of static was when you had the box open and were installing/repairing components.
i never thought a static discharge to the case could cause this kind of damage.
is there something i can purchase to ground the case so this doesn't happen again?
