<s> Hello...upgrading a Presario S4000NX.I've upgraded the ram to 1G...hard drive w/control card to 1T w/7200 rpm . </s>
<s> I am currently running Win 7rc...but my primary is XP Home. </s>
<s> What are the MAXIMUM SPECS in a PCI video card that I can use....or will any card bwork as long as its PCI??? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>

<s> There's PCI and several varieties of PCI Express. </s>
<s> If your PC has PCI better buy such a card. </s>
<s> If it's the right type, it will work, assuming the PSU (power supply) and the cooling are up to the task. </s>

<s> I too needed a PCI (not pcie) card. </s>
<s> I found the usual 8400 pci card and it works &quot;ok.&quot; I'm ordering the 9400 version this week. </s>
