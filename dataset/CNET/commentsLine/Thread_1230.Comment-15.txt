there are boot commands to get around this and a ms fix for the memory adress problem.
but this will slow it down as it takes a different route to say, and isnt exactly worth it unless absolutely needed.
if so you should be running 64bit anyways.
windows will usually recognize around 3/3.5ish, it reserves system memory and gpu ram that will affect the memory count.
