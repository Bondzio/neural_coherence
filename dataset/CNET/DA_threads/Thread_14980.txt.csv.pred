1.1.1	A few months ago my father passed away and soon thereafter my brother had two new computers installed in our father 's home ; both new units were Dells purchased from Dell 's Small Business division .	St
1.1.2	One computer is a low end Dell Dimension desktop ; the other computer is a Dell Inspiron 1300 notebook which I have enjoyed using very much .	St
1.1.3	My brother also had my old dial-up service with Bell South switched over to their company 's entry level DSL service .	St
1.1.4	A Lynksys router was also installed in the bedroom with the Dell desktop which allows me to use the notebook wirelessly throughout the house .	St
1.1.5	I have yet to use the Dell desktop and am reluctant to do so since I do n't want to load that computer down with my personal data .	St
1.1.6	For quite sometime now I 've wanted to purchase a desktop PC from Velocity Micro but have come to the conclusion that their systems are too expensive for my personal budget .	St
1.1.7	Dell takes a real bashing in many forums including forums here on CNET and I 'm reluctant to purchase a desktop PC from Dell for myself for that very reason ; poor customer service and tech support .	St
1.1.8	The Dell 's in the house belong to my brother and if something happens to them ; they 'll be his problem ; not mine .	St
1.1.9	If I did consider purchasing a new desktop PC from Dell should I consider purchasing one of their low end XPS models and purchase it through their Small Business Division rather than their Home Office Division ?	Ques
1.1.10	Are Dell XPS machines built with better parts than lower end Dell Dimension desktop PC models ?	Ques
1.1.11	I read somewhere ; ca n't remember where that I would receive USA based tech support if I purchased a new PC from Dell 's Small Business Division but I would receive overseas tech support if I purchased a new desktop PC from Dell 's Home Office Division .	St
1.1.12	I was considering something like a Dell XPS 400 or similar unit from Dell 's Small Business Division .	St
1.1.13	If I should not consider purchasing a new desktop PC from Dell ; I 've already ruled out Velocity Micro due to their cost ; which other brands of desktop PC 's should I consider to purchase for someone who would use a new desktop PC simply for word processing ; personal finance ; web surfing and email ?	Ques
1.1.14	Something with an 80 to 120GB HD ; 512MB RAM ; DVD ROM and a CDRW ; either a dedicated video card or equipped with integrated video and audio ; 56K modem and the ability to access high speed internet .	St
1.1.15	A built in floppy drive ; outdated now but would still be nice ; connections up front for a digital camera if I decide to purchase one in the future would also be a nice .	St
1.1.16	Are desktop PC 's by Acer any good ?	Ques
1.1.17	Since having the experience of using a notebook computer for the first time I 'll have to say that I 'm hooked .	St
1.1.18	To be able to sit in the living room and surf the net or send emails from there is rather nice .	St
1.1.19	I 'd like to one day buy myself a notebook of my own like Dell 's E1505 or equivalent from Dell 's Small Business Division since I 've read many good reviews as well as user feedback comments about it but until then I 'll continue to use my brother 's new Dell Inspiron 1300 .	St
1.1.20	In the meantime I really do need to buy myself a new desktop PC to replace my old WIN 95 desktop PC .	St
1.1.21	Should I consider buying from Dell or from somebody else ?	Ques
1.1.22	Big Steve 06/25/06	St
1.2.1	There are also good HP deals .	St
1.2.2	I 've had good experience with emachines and hp .	St
1.2.3	But gateway owns emachines so its probably good too .	St
1.2.4	You could always build your own computer ?	Ques
1.2.5	Other brands to consider include monarch , overdrive , hypersonic , voodoo , falcon northwest , and alienware , but all of these are expensive .	St
1.2.6	SOme cheaper manufacturers , with some positive and many negative reviews include cyberpower , ibuypower , and elite .	St
1.2.7	There are also many smallers brands which i would not advocate buying from .	St

1.3.1	Roger : So you would recommend those brands listed in your post over Dell ?	Ques

1.4.1	http : //reviews.cnet.com/5208-7586-0.html ? forumID=68 & threadID=112547 Just got done posting in there and then saw yours .	St
1.4.2	But just let me add this , all brands have good and bad and most will argue until the sun burns out about which is better .	St
1.4.3	If emachines has fixed their little power supply issue they had a few years to a couple of years ago , then they are very good running and for a good price .	St
1.4.4	But even so , do n't take my word , read others as well and do what you feel is the best solution for you .	St
1.4.5	Also , go to the sites and read user reiveiws on computers , or non bias testers that actually put these computers through the ringer .	St
