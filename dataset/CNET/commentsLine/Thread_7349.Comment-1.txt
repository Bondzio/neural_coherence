i am trying water cooling for the first time and something weird is happening.
my loop is working fine and i am using a t-line to fill it.
it is full and almost bubble free however when i turn the pump off the water level rises a little bit in the filling tube.
does anyone know why the water level might rise when i turn the pump off?
