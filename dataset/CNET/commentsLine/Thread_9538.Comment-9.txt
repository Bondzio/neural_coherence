often enough most frt.
usb ports are connected by a cable harness inside the pc to the header on the mtrbd.
with power-off, locate and reseat several times the connection and retry for use.
if it still fails, then it very well could have blown the usb chip that's the hub typically runs 2 usb ports.
unless this is a generic type of port placement, then you have to install a satellite hub using a rear usb port which can add 2-8 new ports, google for such.
