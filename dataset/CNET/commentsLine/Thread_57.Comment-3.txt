i simply created a port with identical information (ip, name, etc) to the functioning workstations, extracted the oem drivers to a directory, created a dummy printer then changed its port to the new one and did a &quot;driver update&quot; to the driver directory.
i realize this has to be the most hassel-filled way to do it but it worked fine.
btw, on printer, a dns address was specified but enable dhcp was unchecked...may mean nothing.
thanks again
