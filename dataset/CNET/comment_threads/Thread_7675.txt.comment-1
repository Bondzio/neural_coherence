I'M HAVING PROBLEMS WITHT THE DIPLAY FOR MY LAPTOP.
THE ICONS GO PAST THE SCREENS LIMIT.
WHEN I CHECK MY DISPLAY PROPERTIES THE &quot;DEFAULT VGA DISPLAY&quot; COMES UP.
WHEN I GO TO THE DEVICE MAHAGER DURING SAFE MODE THERE ARE EXCLAMATION MARKS ON &quot;VGA DISPLAY CONTROLLER&quot; THE &quot;VISUAL ND MONITOR&quot; I HAVE TRIED TO REINSTALL THE DISPLAY DRIVER MANY TIMES BUT THAT DOESNT WORK.
I HAVE NVIDIA GEFORCE4 420 GO 32M ON MY GATEWAY M500 NOTEBOOK.
WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION.
I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY HELP.
GATEWAY CANT SEEM TO HELP ANY.
