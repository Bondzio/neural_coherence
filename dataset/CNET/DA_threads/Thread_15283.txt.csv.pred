1.1.1	Hey guy, I need some some advices, pls.	St
1.1.2	Which should I chose?	St
1.1.3	Asus me301t or nexus 7 (3G) ?	Ques
1.1.4	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	Also, what tablet do you use today?	St

1.3.1	I originally purchased the Nexus 7 and loved every thing about it.	St
1.3.2	My wife loved it so much, well, she took it from me.	Polite
1.3.3	I then purchased the ME301 in place of another Nexus and prefer the ME301 for a few reasons.	St
1.3.4	The Number 1 reason was it's memory expansion capabilities, the second reason was the rear camera.	St
1.3.5	Crazy as it sounds, you don't expect to take pictures with a tablet, but it's a good feature to have when the need arises.	St
1.3.6	I will admit, I like the comfort of the Nexus 7 better, however the new ME301, is pretty comfortable for it's size.	St
1.3.7	Last comment, I use the device for personal and business.	St
1.3.8	The ME301 is a better choice when sharing information with friends and or customers.	St
1.3.9	Oh wait, one more note- both these purchases were my first (I mean second) Asus purchase - and I am really impressed with the power and capabilities they packed in a low cost device (s).	St
1.3.10	Hope this helps you make a decision.	St
1.4.1	If you're going that far, why not find a T 300?	St
