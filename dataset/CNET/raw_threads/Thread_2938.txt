Pentium 4 2.4 ghz OS: Windows XP Video card: 7600 GS Each time I'm going in Intervideo home theater(the recording software with the installation CD) or virtual dub to try recording, my computer freezes. I have remove SP2(you need SP2 to install everything) and reinstall it and it's still not working. The light on the gamebridge is green, it means it is ready to record. I have the Gamebridge TV AVC-1410 from Adaptec

I was hoping for a make and model on the machine or motherboard so I could provide a direct link. But since there is none, this is all I can offer. Bob

14817	6	286285	2721105	2721085	filauc	3/3/08 9:27 PM	1.20457962E12	mmm	It's for VIA chipset so I thik it's going to work even if it is written VIA Hyperion Pro drivers are suitable for ANY VIA chipset - but they are particularly recommended for KT4## series, P4X4## series and newer
14817	7	286285	2721108	2721105	filauc	3/3/08 9:32 PM	1.20457992E12	What to do?	Do I install them all? - VIA Chipset INF update utility v3.00A - VIA AGP Driver 4.60A - VIA PATA IDE Driver Package V1.80 A

Proffitt	3/4/08 9:03 AM	1.20462138E12	&quot;my computer freezes&quot;	Now that we have the motherboard chipset drivers out of the way (sorry it took so long) we now have to turn our attention to what else could be causing the lockup. It could be the use of a front port. I read your post again but can't find the gritty details. Try the rear motherboard USB connection. Sorry if such details are needed but as you suspect when I work with the machine in the flesh I don't have to ask. Next we look in the EVENT VIEWER and research drivers for the video and audio. Bob
