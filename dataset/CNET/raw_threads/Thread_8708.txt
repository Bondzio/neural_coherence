When I got it only has 7.48 gb on the c: drive and almost all of that is already being used. I took it to a tech he found a partition under disk management and told me that there is 7 more gigs not being used and created an icon for me under &quot;my computer&quot;. However moving things over there is not really freeing up much space. I am running Windows XP. I have done the disk clean up. Nothing... Where is all this space being used. I mean under add/remove programs it's just got the main stuff to run the pc. No extras at all. Any advice would help. Thanks.

Delete all but the latest system restore point from the disk cleanup wizard (advanced). 2. Download Treesize Free from http://www.jam-software.com/freeware/ and start analysing the contents. Kees

You would have to tell us (or post a screenprint at some image hosting site) what disk management says exactly. 7.48 GB on the c:-drive for XP certainly is unworkable and it will become worse with each Windows update. So either you have to merge partitions or (better) replace the drive. You can clone the contents of the current c:-drive to it, so you wouldn't have to lose anything. That your father has the same netbook but with a bigger hard disk only means it's not the same configuration. Kees

In your other discussion GPARTED was noted and I've used that in the past HOWEVER once in a while the OS won't boot and I'll have to boot the XP CD to fix the boot information. Bob
