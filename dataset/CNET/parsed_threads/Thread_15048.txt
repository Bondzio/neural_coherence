<s> Will use one of the major brand [Dlink, LinkSys,...]a g [2.4GHz/5GHz] wireless router with 4 port switch and entry point. </s>
<s> Want both frequencies. </s>
<s> Want 5 GHZ but be able to fall back to 2.4 GHz for more range. </s>
<s> Only two computers involved, but one is in a trailer on the other side of a wide paved driveway and handicapped parking area [a Municipal bldg for road maintenance trucks, graders et al], running cables would be too difficult.. We added a new function and employee but had no space for an office, thus the trailer LOL Telephone company refused to drop a phone line to it [says that PA law does not allow drops to two places on one property]. </s>
<s> Thus his phone line comes into our building and we have the base station for a 2.4 GHz phone and he has an additional phone with charger. </s>
<s> It works fine. </s>
<s> [one reason I might need 5 GHz for the network, to prevent interference.] </s>
<s> The router will sit in a window in the main building with a clear shot to the windows in the trailer. </s>
<s> About 120 feet. </s>
<s> If necesary the computer's location in the trailer can to optimized for the antenna on the PCI slot. </s>
<s> [unless there are extension antennas]. </s>
<s> Plenty of info on the 2.4 b or g units but not much on the a g . </s>
<s> I know that there is a &quot;high&quot; gain antenna available for 2.4 but haven't seen one for 5 GHz. </s>
<s> Any ideas and also recco's on which brands, based on experience?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> My tests with WAP11 and WUSB11 was right at the 300 foot mark with line of sight and setting the transfer rate to a fixed 1 Mbps. </s>
<s> Remember that speed drops rapidly with distance. </s>

<s> You might try this supplier for 5ghz gain antennas. </s>
