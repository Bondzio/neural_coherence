&quot;overclocking&quot; [assuming that you don't actually have 166 mhz memory].
don't try it without doing a lot of reading to understand all aspects of overclocking.
you can end up frying the cpu.
the faster it runs the hotter it gets unless you lower voltages and others actions.
there are a number of overclockers sites.
