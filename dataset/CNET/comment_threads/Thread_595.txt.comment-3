right click mycomputer&gt; properties&gt; advance&gt; performance&gt; settings&gt; visual effects&gt; then uncheck the &quot;show window contents while dragging&quot; box.
bells and wistles are fine, but if you really want to squeeze more speed from your pc you could select the &quot;adjust for best performance&quot; button in this tab and just leave the &quot;smooth edges of screen fonts&quot; and &quot;use common task in folder&quot; checked.
enjoy life is good.
