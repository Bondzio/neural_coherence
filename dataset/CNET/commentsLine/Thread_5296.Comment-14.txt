when i got my hp pc back in 2004, it was shipped in intergrated graphic card.
i didn't know the meaning of it.
due to my own curiosity, i came to realize that having standalone graphic card is always better than having integrated one in term of performance.
by having standalone graphic card, the burden of cpu and the amount of ram that has been used will be reduced.
gpu will take over the graphic processiong job and there would be dedicated memory for graphic so that your ram could be used for other tasks.
if you don't use your pc for resource-intensive job, integrated graphic card will just do fine.
before running softwares, it's a good practice to check their system requirement.
i'm not a hardcore gamer.
but i do use autocad, adobe flash and photoshop.
they do consume a lot of resources.
