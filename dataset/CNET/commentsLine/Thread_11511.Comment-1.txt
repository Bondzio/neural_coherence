don't know anything about computers except that i use them on daily basis.
i don't want to spend more than $800-900.
have dsl.
want to be able to burn cds, download pictures, need word, excel, internet access.
what can/should i get?
i don't need sth.
incredible, but sth.
that would last me for the next 5 years and be fast, and not freeze all the time.
thanks so much for your help.
