1281	0	309073	2861301	NR	BatgirlZKE	9/18/08 7:38 PM	1.22176668E12	Formatting new external HD	I just bought an external hard drive. It's a 1TB, Fantom GForce MaxDrive. I'm trying to format it to NTFS and, according to the manual, it's only supposed to take 90min, max. Well I started formatting it around 1230pm today and, as of 1030pm, it's still going. It's on 72%. Is it normal for a hard drive to take that long to format from FAT to NTFS?
