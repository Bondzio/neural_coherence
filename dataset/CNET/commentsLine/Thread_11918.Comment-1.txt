my browser and pc were both hit last week; browser was hijacked; pc was hit by viruses; pc took 15 hits last week; thought my norton was working; must not have been.
sent all 15 hits to norton for analysis; all 15 hits were listed as having adware components.
unable to repair; have been advised by others to buy a new pc; trash the old one since i can't seem to repair the damage.
would like recommendations on a basic entry level new desktop pc; nothing from dell since i have issues with their tech support for home office pc's plus all of the negative feedback i've read in other forums about dell and their company's poor customer service and tech support.
i would be using my new pc to do word processing; email; internet and home finance.
i'm not into computer games or digital photography.
would also like to know what new security software i should have installed on any new pc before connecting it to the internet.
i want to avoid a repeat of what has just happened to my old pc last week which seemed to be running fine on win 95 until these attacks took place last week.
