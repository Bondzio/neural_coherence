Going bye bye if you didn't put the heatsink and compound on just so.
Also many cracked the cpu cores when putting on the heatsink.
Those were not good for do it yourselfers.
If you strip it down to just board, CPU+HSF, power supply and a speaker and it does not beep you are looking at the 4 possible bad parts.
