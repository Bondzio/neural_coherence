the filesystem shouldn't be raw, but ntfs.
that's why vista says it needs to be formatted.
and, indeed, you'll lose everything that's on it.
zero assumption recovery (from  ) usually is able to get the data from such disks.
worth a try, although not free ($49.99).
it's up to you to decide if your data is worth that much.
hope this helps.
