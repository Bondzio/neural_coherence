I like to buy a computer for gaming.
I've got a choice between these 3 configurations, but i can't make up what the best choice would be.
1: AMD Athlon 64 X2 6000+ (dual-core) 2048 MB DDR2-RAM 800 MHz Geforce 8800GTX PCI-E (768 MB DDR 3) 2: INTEL Core 2 Quad Q6600 (FSB 1066) 4096 MB DDR2-RAM 800 MHz Geforce 8800GT PCI-E (512 MB DDR 3) 3: AMD Phenom Quad 9600 4096 MB DDR2-RAM 800 MHz Geforce 8800GT PCI-E (512 MB DDR 3)
