<s> my wife bought an iBook that she uses in her elder care business. </s>
<s> the unit is used so going to a retailer is out of the question. </s>
<s> i've decided to help her get connected at various hot spots and have been having difficulty with the airport subsystem. </s>
<s> the iBook runs OS X 10.2.8 (6R73), with 256 memory, and a processor speed of 700 MHz (PowerPC G3). </s>
<s> Airport does not access a local hot spot that my desktop pc (Gateway G6 450, running Windows XP Professional and using a Linksys Wireless-B PCI Adapter) easily does. </s>
<s> The airport continues to show &quot;server not found&quot; message. </s>
<s> how do i set up this airport user? </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
<s> Take a look at the Airport Setup Assistant and see what is going on there. </s>
<s> Also, take a look at the Apple System profiler and see if the Airport card is actually recognized. </s>
<s> Remove the Airport card, following the instructions on the Apple web site, and reseat it into its slot. </s>
<s> Does the airport actually &quot;see&quot; the wireless hot spots or are you just trying to make it work at a known hotspot. </s>
<s> Theoretically, it should just &quot;see&quot; any wireless network. </s>
<s> Try the above and let us know P </s>
<s> how simple. </s>
<s> i let her do all the keystrokes and &quot;voila&quot; internet access. </s>
<s> didn't have to remove and reseat the card. </s>
<s> thanks. </s>
