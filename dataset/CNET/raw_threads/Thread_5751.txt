Easy setup, just run the CD that comes with the router. It'll hold your hand throughout, show you how to connect the devices wired and how to configure wireless and set up wireless security. Unless you have wireless N and Gigabit NICs in the PCs (I do), the DIR-655 is a little overkill. But it's an excellent router, and you've planned for the future.

The modem will handle anything from the provider. They're plug and play. You will need to contact your provider and give them the MAC address of the modem so they can set it up. Call'em, they'll walk you through it.
