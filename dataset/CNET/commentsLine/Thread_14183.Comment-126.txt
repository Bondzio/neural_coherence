my first computer that my dad bought me was a tandy trs80 in the mid-80's.
i thought i was the kid who had it all.
(shame) i do remember the high pitched screaming noise the cassette tapes used to make while loading the games, and the frustartion in having to rewind it if didnt load first time.hello to all.
i love reading the news letter(johnty-first time replyer.manchester.u.k.)
