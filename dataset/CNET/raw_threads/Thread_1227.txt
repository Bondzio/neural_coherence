It's been having some problems lately. Well, let me start at the beginning. A few weeks ago, I had a similar problem in which the computer wouldn't turn on, but found the culprit to be some fishy software. Recently, for the big game, I was making a big hole in the wall to let the cable wire through the wall. While making the hole I saw some electrical wires and thought it'd be best if I shut down the power. Well, my power plug thingies in the basement only had one for the ENTIRE floor, which my computer is on. So I turned the computer off, unplugged all the wires to the wall. Well, after I turned the power back on, I smelled something burning. I thought it was my sister's new found (not) skill of the culinary arts. It wasn't, and after spending ten minutes looking around, I am sure it is coming from the computer. No idea how, but...I didn't want it to turn on with that smell, so I checked all the fans; they all look good. So, I tried to turn it on, but nothing happened. The last time the problem occured, the cold cathode light would come on for just a second and the HS/F would spin momentarily before dying. Now, neither items happen. But the odd thing is when I was about to chuck it, I realized the motherboard LED Power light was on! Does that mean anything? Or is it just false hope? Just want to know. Thanks in advance! ~Ibrahim~

So your computer was functioning properly since the last shut-down? Unless you had just installed new software or you were having some fun in the registry, I don't see how the problem could be software related. From what I read you could have short somewhere. Do you have it on a surge protector? If you do try a new surge protector. If that doesn't work look to your power supply. Replace the PSU. That's where the smell could be coming from and or the surge protector. Motherboards also have small short-term batteries (looks like a watch battery) for storing your CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) settings and other numerous things. This possibly could explain the LED MOBO light being on...

You will need to put the PC on a table and open it up. Your nose is the best tool. See if you detect the odor in the PC. Start unplugging power supply cables to devices to see if the PSU will run. You cannot unplug the MB cable as it contains wiring to that traces to the front panel switch. The green LED means the control voltage needed to latch the power supply is available. It does not have anything to do with the MB battery as the other post suggests. If you cannot get the PSU fan to run with everthing but the MB connected, it's likely the PSU or MB. You just need to determine which and your nose will help. You might look carefully at the MB for any evidence of charring on the epoxy as well. Good luck.

They are in your house and if you have a short in your house, you would flip the switch. Yeah, it was working fine until that day. Yes it was connected to a Surge Protector, but that was unplugged anyways. I tried plugging it directly into the wall, but it didn't work either. Well, this computer is on it's critches. I would buy a new PSU, but even if this thing turns on, it still has a lot of problems, lol. So, in the end, I would have to replace something? I am actually going to get a new PC, and am wondering if I can salvage anything from this one. I just wanted to know whether this one is gone for good, or has some parts. When I get the new PC, I'll use a few parts. Thanks, both of you! ~Ibrahim~
7223	4	155263	1725809	1725321	Willy	2/7/06 4:45 AM	1.1392875E12	It happens...	Because the psu is the traditional exit(exhaust) of system innards it will carry any smell with it. It ususally is supect of being burnt/blown when its possible the mtrbd. was done-in. In either case, they're so interelated a psu could cuase a mtrbd. problem and vica-versa. The quickest and safest bet is to replace the psu with a new one and if possible of greater wattage value and start t/s'ing from there. As for any surge protectors, common strip protectors are protected by a $.25 MOV and that's it. Better ones, protect all three wires, other each circuit(plug-in) and still others tell ya via some LED(if unlit, blown). these things happen. But, seriously consider that any new system placed on the same circuit could be effected. Of course the chnaces increase if you don't mess with the breakers again for good system. tada -----Willy
