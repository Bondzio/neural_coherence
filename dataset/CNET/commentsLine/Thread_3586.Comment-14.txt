i was having the same problem at&t could not help we have a dell 1501 laptop and what i did to fix the problem for the drops was to buy a usb exturnal wifi for it i bought a linky's g wifi and downloaded it and turned off the wifi on the laptop.
it will have a different network channel.
to make it work after you download the cd is to go to control panel click on administrative tools click on it find services click on it scroll to the bottom to where is says wireless zero config click on it and click automatic, then at the top left it will say stop ,start or restart click the start.
and then reboot you laptop.
if your inturel wifi comes on turn it off.
and that should fix the problem with the drops.
if you have a desktop or tower it would be best to get one for it too if you are having same problem.
