<s> I just built a new PC and when I tried to boot it up for the first time all of the fans and LED's come on and everything looks like it should be working but I don't get any video on the monitor I don't even get a post code. </s>
<s> Here is a list of all the components I put into it please HELP. </s>

<s> Yes, this is my First Build. </s>
<s> you want to test them outside the case so the you don't end up like you are now...everything's inside and it doesn't work. </s>
<s> You can try disconnecting the data and power cables from any of the drives, reduce the RAM to one stick, double check the PSU connectors...the 24-pin and 4-pin ATX connectors and the PSU connector to the video card. </s>
<s> If the system won't POST then, the next step is to pull the MB ....put in on a piece of cardboard and start from scratch. </s>
<s> Important to have a speaker connected so you hear any beeps which are signals for what's wrong. </s>
<s> Here's a good troubleshooting guide from MSI that may give you some some tips. </s>
<s> Start with noting but the CPU installed and build from there ...1 DIMM, 2 DIMMs then video, then an HDD Keep us posted. </s>

<s> I think I found the problem, after doing some research I discovered that the D975XBX2 Motherboard doesn't support the E6750 Processor because it uses a 1333 MHz FSB but the motherboard only supports 1066 or 800 MHz. </s>
<s> So the E6700 should work but I think I'm going to get the Q6600 because it's cheaper on Amazon and the motherboard supports it. </s>
<s> http://processormatch.intel.com/COMPDB/SearchResult.aspx?Boardname=d975xbx2 How about another MB ? </s>
<s> Abit IP35 PRO gets great reviews everywhere I read..and buyer reviews are good too. </s>
<s> If you stick with the Intel MB...believe they're sensitive to RAM speed. </s>
<s> So if that RAM isn't 1.8V...might want to check too. </s>
<s> Keep us posted. </s>

<s> The Abit IP35 PRO looks good I think I'll go with that one, thanks. </s>

<s> I finally got it to work after replacing the motherboard and it works perfectly. </s>
