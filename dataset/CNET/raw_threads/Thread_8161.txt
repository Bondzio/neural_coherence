9704	0	33190	382488	NR	Stanmar2	8/15/04 6:06 PM	1.09259316E12	Formating and partitioning HD	I recently had troubles with my HD. I was able to retrieve the important files with PC Inspector file recovery program. I then removed the partitions to delete all files on the HD. What should I do now so I can use the drive? Does it need to be formated first and then partitioned?
