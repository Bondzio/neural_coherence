to suspect that's the case here.
these kids are sons of an old friend who are trying to get started in the computer biz.
they know how to build gaming rigs, but i don't care about that... i've left numerous messages for them but have yet to receive a reply.
i'd call their dad but i don't want to screw up an old friendship over this... sigh...
