1.1.1	I have purchased another xbox 360 for the living room to use with windows media center and netflix .	St
1.1.2	It is connected via a xbox wireless adapter ( 802.11b/g ) .	St
1.1.3	When I stream netflix the quality is terrible which defeats its purpose .	St
1.1.4	My router is a netgear wireless-n WNR834Bv2 .	St
1.1.5	I 'm thinking of connecting the xbox via ethernet instead to a linksys WGA600N dual band wireless-n gaming adapter .	St
1.1.6	Will the linksys adapter give me 802.11n speeds ?	Ques
1.1.7	Will just upgrading my router ( I 've read negative reviews ) provide better performance ?	Ques
1.1.8	I also will be getting a ps3 for xmas and would like to set it up wireless .	St
1.1.9	I was thinking about purchasing another router that would support 802.11n with gigabit lan ( WNR832Bv2 does n't have gigabit lan ) and use the netgear as a wireless bridge .	St
1.1.10	So my other xbox 360 and main computer will be connected via ethernet to the new router .	St
1.1.11	In the living room the ps3 and xbox 360 would connect to the netgear bridge via ethernet .	St
1.1.12	I also have a laptop that will be connected wireless .	St
1.1.13	Will i get N speed between the routers ?	Ques
1.1.14	Is this a better alternative then using 2 linksys wireless-n gaming adapter ?	Ques
1.1.15	I really do n't want to go through the hassle of running 2 new network cables to the xbox and ps3 .	St
1.1.16	But I also do n't want to waste money buying 2 linksys wireless-n gaming adapters or another router to bridge and still suffer from poor connection speeds .	St
1.1.17	Then end up running wires instead .	St
1.1.18	Please help .	St
1.1.19	I 'm also open to any other suggestions .	St
1.1.20	Thank you in advance .	St
1.2.1	I 'll let others answer your question but I went with a refurb 25 buck WGPS606 and the 360 and PC on the other end work fine .	St
1.2.2	I liked it so much I bought a second unit .	St
1.2.3	Since 802.11g is over 10 times faster than my cable internet connection I found no reason to consider 802.11n Bob	St
1.3.1	Check this out if you want 802.11n performance : http : //www.techheck.com/journal/2008/12/28/turning-a-linksys-wrt310n-into-a-wireless-bridge.html	St
