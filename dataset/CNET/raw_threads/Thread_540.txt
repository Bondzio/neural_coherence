Look in your motherboard manual, as they sometimes give you a translation of what the different type of beeps mean. Or,take a look at this link, in the big yellow box in the middle, the links may help you. But you need to know what type of BIOS you have; you can normally see this on bootup when the screen is black, and the text is white. http://www.pctechguide.com/tutorials/MBoard_BIOS.htm I've seen better charts for beeps, but this is the best one I could find right now. Do check your motherboard's manual/website first. Good luck.

It could be incompatible memory, hard drive, processor. It could be bad memory. It could be bad video card. In your situation, most likely you have bad memory. In order to diagnosis correctly, you need to provide more information about what hardware you install on your computer: motherboard, memory, processor, hard drive, video card, etc. Does the motherboard supports memory speed and MB, type of processor, hard drive type(MB and transfer rate)? Also operating system is another factor to determine your hardware. Did you install operating system yet? If yes, what operating system you have? Windows 9x, Windows Me, Windows NT, Windows 2000, or Windows XP.In short, need more info. Send me E-mail if you like. tuan2yh@yahoo.com
