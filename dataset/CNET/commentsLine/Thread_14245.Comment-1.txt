hi all, i'm a self taught (self confessed) computer nerd and have been dabbling in a bit of networking; i recently networked a small internet cafe.
been hearing about this ip version 6 and have found loads of papers expalining what it does....... double dutch to me i'm afraid.
what i would like to know is this: if i'm buying a switch, do i have to look out for certain criteria so it can handle ipv6?
if i want to put in an ip address in windows networking, how can i enter a 128bit ip address?
as i understand it there is no more need for a subnetmask, what else is there to know?
i've been trying to read some of the papers that are available but havent come across anything that's understandable.
thanks for your time jimi
