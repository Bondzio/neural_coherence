lets put it this way; until service pack 1 comes out i would not change.
little to no software is even able to run on vista and what is out has been thrown to gather to get it out the door.
remember xp when it first came out.
i would give it 6 months after it is out before i would even look at upgrading.
yes, vista is the newest and bigest thing in years from microsoft, and yes i think it is a move in the right direction.
if you like to be upset and things not working right, and just like pulling your hare out, go ahead.
be the first on the block.
i garneted as a computer tech, i will.
