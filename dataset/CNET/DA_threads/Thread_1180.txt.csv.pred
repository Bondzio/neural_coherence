1.1.1	well this really does suck .	St
1.1.2	i opened up my compaq sr1000v to find out that theres no agp slot !	St
1.1.3	i can see that theres holes for one but theres not one to be seen .	St
1.1.4	theres everything needed to have one ( the holes , space , and the removable metal slide on the case ) but theres not one in site !	St
1.1.5	can i just add one , get a slot from a different computer and hammer it in the holes , or even buy the slot and put it in ?	Ques
1.1.6	a reply would be GREATLY apprieciated thank you	Polite
1.2.1	have to get a new mobo ... too bad however , theres still hope .	St
1.2.2	there are some pretty decent graphics card out there for pci .	St
1.2.3	the best is the 5700le which cost around 100 bucks at newegg .	St
1.3.1	what new motherboard would you suggest something not too expensive but something i can upgrade my computer from time to time ( computer : compaq sr1000v , it uses a asus p4sd something right now )	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	My first computer was an HP and like you , my first time i opened it up i was dumbfounded : S. No AGP slot ! ! ...	St
1.5.2	Anyways for a new motherboard u can be upgrading from time to time I would suggest one with PCI-e , if you can afford it .	St
1.5.3	If you cant , any motherboard with AGP slot will be fine since i can assume you dont play intensive games .	St
1.5.4	Good Luck !	St
1.6.1	thanks , yeah f hp and compaq , i think im just going to build my own computer next time ... because im definetly not buying from hp/compaq .	St
1.6.2	im glad im not alone though i am probably just going to buy a new mobo with agp and probably just another processor just for the hell of it thanks for the help	St
1.7.1	we spent on it , did n't have much of anything .	St
1.7.2	Was an extremely overpriced system for what we got and I had a lot of problems with it , I will never buy another compaq because of it .	St
1.8.1	Do you know what processor you have ?	Ques
1.9.1	no no hp/compaq is a good brand .	Polite
1.9.2	You just ca n't get the budget machine using intel chips .	St
1.9.3	All the AMD-based have AGP slots .	St
1.9.4	( another reason to buy AMD chips ) Just get a mobo that is the same with your current CPU .	St
1.9.5	You can easily pull the CPU out , get some thermal paste , and put it in the new mobo .	St
1.9.6	However , I think they use m-ATX mobos .	St
1.10.1	yes its an intel either 2.8 or .6 , 400mhz , socket 478	St
1.11.1	I think that you have found the reason that so many of us build our own PCs .	St
1.11.2	Before you buy a new MB that a good look at the lay out of your MB .	St
1.11.3	It may NOT be a standard ATX board since they have thier own design .	St
1.11.4	At least the power connector is standard ATX .	St
1.11.5	You may end up buying a MB and case .	St
1.11.6	John	St
1.12.1	yeah ive checked out the layout of my mb and compared it to the one im about to buy .	St
1.12.2	its basically the same thing except an upgrade with 2 more ram slots and an agp slot .	St
1.12.3	same 3 pci slots and usb jacks and ect .	St
1.12.4	this is the one im planing on buying http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? item=N82E16813131460 and this is the one i have http : //usa.asus.com/prog/spec.asp ? m=P4SDR-VM & langs=09 ( yes that one comes with agp but i guess compaq has the ones w/o or something )	St
1.13.1	Many low value computers put out by others such as Dell , Sony , Emachines , have integrated on board graphics without an AGP or even lately PCIe slot .	St
1.13.2	It was predominant to do so in the past , as people who played higher end games was in the minority ( and knew about Graphic Cards ) besides those mobo 's being cheaper by the factories to obtain , therefore able to sell lower priced PC 's .	St
1.13.3	More recently many are selling even higher priced computers with Integrated on board graphics , but have a PCIe slot .	St
1.13.4	However , low value ( cost ) computers have continued to be sold without a video card slot , relying on integrated on board graphics .	St
1.13.5	Notice their ads , as in the past , continue to ignore mentioning anything about AGP or PCIe video graphics .	St
1.13.6	Only blame yourself , or getting a hand-me-down from relatives , as not having enough knowledge about computers .	St
1.13.7	Anyone who graduates from the TV connected console game machines should know enough about PC 's and Integrated Graphics .	St
1.13.8	However , it happens quite often as can be read in the forums .	St
1.13.9	I always advise even older buyers/builders who do no gaming ( they are missing out on part of the modern experiences of life ) and insist on the cheaper computer with no AGP or PCIe slot , to think of their kids after they reach a certain age , to say , ''Dad this PC or yours is a piece of junk..it wo n't play my game . ''	St
1.13.10	Before I bought my 1st computer 6-7 years ago , I learned to operate one by going to the public Library and taking a couple of hands on free courses .	St
1.13.11	Then for 6 months using occasionally the Library 's free computers , besides reading on line 'help ' forums , read every PC 's magazine about computers and learned early on about Video Cards , ensuring to get the top of the line..then the Nvidia TNT Riva or Voodoo when I purchased my PC .	St
1.13.12	Course ' , like Jcrobso indicates , when building your own PC and reading how-to-do , someone will learn about graphics .	St
