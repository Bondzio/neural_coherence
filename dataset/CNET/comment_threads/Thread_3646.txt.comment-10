sounds to me - from china.
took a smaller drive and made changes to the fat to say its the right size etc and stuck a label on that matches what he wanted.
I ran into that with SDHC cards - smaller cards - label changed and the report back in the fat says higher mem and class.
not so - some dont work at all or you just end up with a 1 to 4 g card.
these were purch IN the usa with no mention of where from.
only use reputable sellers for electronics !
