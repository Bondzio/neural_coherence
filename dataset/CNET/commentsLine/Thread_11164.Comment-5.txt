thanks within 2 hours after reading your reply i have all 5 of my comps running on my network and using the shared internet connection (both wireless laptops including the one running windows 2000).
you have managed to help me complete a project 2 years in the running in one afternoon.
now if only we could get that isp to get us a real modem.
thank you, andy
