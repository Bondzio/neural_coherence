1.1.2	My old PC is working fine , but wo n't recognise hard drives over 40GB .	St
1.1.3	So I 've a choice between using a smaller ( second user ) drive , or buying a new motherboard .	St

1.2.1	You are in the timeframe that you should n't touch such a machine in case it just falls apart underneath you .	St
1.2.2	My advice is to get the 40G and get by .	St

1.3.1	Are you saying it wo n't recongize a 40gb partition or a physical HD 40gb size .	St
1.3.2	Its important , as then you could partition a large HD into smaller partitions under 40gb , probably 32gb as the limit for each partition .	St
1.3.3	Did you visit the HD makers website for HD install s/w to help install beyond whatever the bios limits are ?	Ques
1.3.4	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.4.1	If the BIOS only sees 40GB , partitioning wo n't make any difference .	St
1.4.2	Most HDs come with overlay software which would enable your system to see all the space .	St
1.5.1	Or you might try something like this .	Sug
