<s> I wanted to reformat my western digital 250 gb hard drive. </s>
<s> It says the file system is a fat32 right now. </s>
<s> But when im about to reformat it, it only gives me the option to format it in NTFS. </s>
<s> So will it my hard drive break or somthing if i reformat it in NTFS. </s>
<s> Cause i wanna know how to just reformat it in fat32. </s>
<s> If you're running XP, the drive should be formatted in NTFS. </s>
<s> ok so i have a windows xp pro, so i just format it in ntfs and it'll still work? </s>
<s> Make sure you have any files you wanted to keep backed up because if you format the drive, anything on it will be lost. </s>
<s> XP (all versions) use the NT file system (NTFS). </s>
<s> It's much more stable than the old DOS based FAT32. </s>
