5716	0	174758	1920643	NR	murman	5/6/06 2:18 PM	1.14692508E12	installing new monitor	I've got a Dell 8200 dimension. It has the standard 17&quot; crt monitor that came with it. The video card is an Asus x800xt pe agp card. I've also installed a 3.06ghz processor. I purchased a 17&quot; viewsonic vx724 lcd. My question is about the swap of monitors. Other than hooking it up to the dvi output of the video card and running their software installation disk, which I assume has drivers etc. on it, is there anything else I should do?
