i have a gateway select 1000 running me and it locks up continuosly the first 5-10 minutes after startup.
if i let it run for 10 minute and then re-boot or leave it on it works flawlessly.
i've done a complete re-install of windows me to make sure it isn't a software problem.
i feel this is hardware problem effected by heat.
is there a way to check the possibilties without bringing it in?
