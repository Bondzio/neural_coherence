i am using that same printer and it will make that noise when it's doing self maintenance.
if it has a empty ink cartridge it will do the clunky weird noise almost every time you try to print.
i let one of the cartidges go dry when i first got the printer and it did just what you are discribing.
after i replaced the cartridge the noise went away except for when it does it's maintenance.
have not let one go dry since and no noise.
you may have a different problem, but as bob said, it's not worth wasting money to have it repaired when a new printer is cheaper.
