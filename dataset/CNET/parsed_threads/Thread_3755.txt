<s> Just bought an epson CX5800F all-in-one and having problem with the scanner. </s>
<s> Epson has been no help. </s>
<s> If I scan a document to file at any resolution greater than 96dpi and then print the document from the file, the print quality is poor. </s>
<s> Scanning at a higher resolution results in a document that is too big to print on an 8.5x11 sheet. </s>
<s> The copier prints just fine and prints from a non-scanned file are fine so the problem seems to be with the scanner. </s>
<s> Anyone have a suggestion? </s>
<s> Most PCs have a screen resolution from 75 to 100 DPI. </s>
<s> Such a resolution will indeed look poor when printed. </s>
<s> To get a print quality scan you'll scan at about 300 DPI. </s>
<s> If you don't let your word processor scale the image it will again look quite strange. </s>
<s> But if I scan at 300 then make it fit, the printout looks good. </s>
<s> As to filesize, scans in TIF or bitmaps will be quite large. </s>
<s> Nothing wrong there. </s>
<s> Try JPEG next time. </s>
<s> Epson and other companies no longer teach how to use their products on the support lines it seems. </s>
<s> Hope this short response gets you going. </s>
