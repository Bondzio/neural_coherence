i have a gigabyte 7vm400m-rz motherboard, amd sempron 2400, 256mb of ram and im running xp pro.
im currently using the onboard video that is sharing 32mb of my ram.
i just purchased 1gig of extra ram and an apg 8x video card that is to be installed this week.
i was just wondering the benefit i would get, if any, of overclocking.
in my cmos the clock speed is set @ 166mhz.
is this where i would overclock it?
if so how much would be &quot;safe&quot;?
