that your bios is current and you have the i945gm video.
i have not checked your work here.
there's a reason i haven't and it's because the details are being slowed given out.
when you post, everytime you post there is a note asking you to give out details.
without such i am left to wait for the details or just give general responses.
you found the most likely cause of the issue.
