have a an integrated graphics card that is sharing about 128 mb from your 1 gb of system ram, leaving you with 896 mb.
to fix this you would have to get another graphics card that has dedicated video memory.
you would also have to uninstall your current integrated graphics card and to tell the computer to not share ram anymore, you would have to change a setting in the bios or the jumper setting on your motherboard.
i can't really tell you exactly which setting or jumper to change because it's different with each motherboard, bios, and video card.
hope this helps.
p.s.
your mp3 is probably malfunctioning, so i would exchange it for a new one.
