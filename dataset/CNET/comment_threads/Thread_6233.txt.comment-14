Most motherboards sold now have an AGP slot and a PCIe slot.
So you can have an AGP card for now, and when you want to upgrade, migrate to a PCIe card.
Why would you still want an AGP card?
The only reason I see is cheaper price.
All the latest technology is for PCIe, but if you don't need the latest and greatest, you can save yourself a little bit of money.
Radeon 9600s are pretty cheap nowadays.
