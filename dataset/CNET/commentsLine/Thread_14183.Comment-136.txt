my first was a kaypro 64 with cp/m operating system.
it was a luggable.
not nearly as light as my macpowerbook today.
i got in lot of fights with my kaypro when i wanted to carry it onboard small planes and refused for it to be placed in cargo hold.
we travelled around the world together.
europe with weight limits was another testing situation.
it finally got passed on to my youngest daughter when she went off to university.i had switched to a 'fat mac'.
in the 70's i was jealous as hell of my daughter kandis who had a trs 80. way before my kaypro.
i thought her trash 80 with tape drive the most wonderful thing ever.
bad form for a mom to be jealous of her kid but i was.
then kandi graduated from usc went to work for microsoft and i really got jealous.
but over the years i ended up feeling sorry for her.
being a girl and black she watched layer after layer of young white men being slotted over her.
sure she got lots of money and they ended up giving her assistants and lots of responsibility but not the promotions or the job titles.
she left ms in a lot of pain and ended up eating a 9mm.
she was a beautiful, brilliant, person.
rip kandis
