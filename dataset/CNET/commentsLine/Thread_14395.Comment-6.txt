thank you bob.
yes, i have read all the stickys - especially post #2 (by pudgy)?
i have set up the router, established wpa-2 psk, i have updated the firmware, i have been on the phone with belkin tech support, etc, etc.... the wired computers have no problems with the internet connection - it's the wireless laptop signal i have the problem with.
it will, i don't know, fade, or disappear, or i don't know how to explain it - i had to configure 3 different connections in the vista laptop settings, so when the signal goofs up, i can connect using a second or third one - does that make sense?
probably not.
sometimes i get a good strong connection with my workgroup name showing.
other times, i can only get local + internet access, but no workgroup.
(it says &quot;identifying......mynetwork&quot; forever, and will not give me a network map, as it doesn't recognize the network as private, even though it is.)
it's terribly difficult for me to explain because i'm not sure how to explain this properly.
i had a linksys wireless b router before this, and never experienced this problem - matter of fact, i've never seen this problem on any wireless network i've configured for anyone!
but, back to the question at hand: you think it would be best if i go ahead and get a print server.
okay, any suggestions?
every one i saw on the web is a single connection (for one printer?)
- does that mean i need 3 of them?
i had a read of sticky 17 - good info and i will utilize it!
