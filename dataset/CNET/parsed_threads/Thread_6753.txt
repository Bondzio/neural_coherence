<s> Hi all, I used to build pc's a while ago. </s>
<s> Things have changed a lot and I realize that I'm probably better off coming here with a couple of questions....for all you builder geeks Wink Here's what I want to accomplish: Through ebay or other used vendors, I want to put together a system for some gaming (not the latest stuff) and intenet - kids pc. </s>
<s> So in the fast paced world of pc parts, what would be my most cost effective and cheapest way to build one up from scratch? </s>
<s> Looking to spend very little -100$ or so All builds welcomed! </s>
<s> Here's some of what I've seen on ebay - my problem is knowing what all I'll need for a particular build say an AMD 64 socket 754?? </s>
<s> I don't know, you guys suggest - I'm listening Thanks for your patience! </s>

<s> A $100 isn't going to go far w/o some &quot;REAL BARGAINS&quot; thrown at you. </s>
<s> In other words, don't expect much even if you shop on eBay as s/h can be a killer. </s>
<s> Pick a cpu and mtrbd. </s>
<s> combo deal to get things going and &quot;IF&quot; you find a system then all the better. </s>
<s> Just, beware what's being offered in cpu, P4 or dual core, etc and the required mtrbd. </s>
<s> plus the case. </s>
<s> if you buy piece-meal then pricing will be more expensive unless a &quot;bare bones&quot; or used system(of some merit) is offered. </s>
<s> Heck, even a new basic system will do wonders if you shop or WAIT for it as $399 bargains can be had minus the monitor is all likelihood. </s>
<s> Trust no one, read the buyers reviews with some grain of salt. </s>
<s> Look at checking your local Goodwill or Sal. </s>
<s> Army outlets for some items plus yard sales. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> HI, thanks! </s>
<s> Definitely looking for the good deals on ebay. </s>
<s> I have some experience with it so I'm not new at it. </s>
<s> I've seen deals like this: DFI LANPARTY NF590 SLI SOCKET AM2 MOTHERBOARD for 15$. </s>
<s> CPU also like the one I mentioned for really cheap. </s>
