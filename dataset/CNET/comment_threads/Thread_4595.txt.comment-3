I'm not 100% sure, but this PC was a prebuilt one, so Its fine for the card it came with (the 4350.)
My problem is actually the fact that my 4350 isn't performing how it was before I took it out then put it back in, this card doesn't have a fan, just a heatsink.
Sorry, my question was unclear.
I think the PSU is 200W.
Whatever it is, Its enough for the card it came with.
