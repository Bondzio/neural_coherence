You can boot to your XP CD to verify this and create/delete partitions. 2.) 127GB is a standard limitation unless you install SP2, a free (but large) download from Microsoft for all legitimate users.

Look for the help file that says &quot;To create a partition or logical drive&quot;. It tells you step by step how to do it.
