i don't think your vga card is the culprit here.
(but your pc would greatly benefit with the extra cooling overall) i believe what you have is more of a monitor problem.
two monitors busted one after the other could be a fluke.
old monitors changing colors are normal problems caused by wear and tear but smoke coming out of it isn't.
it might be electrical.
you should try plugging your monitor in a different outlet.
hope this helps.
life is good
