<s> i have been given a epson c66 printer but the drivers are not signed for xp and are causing my system to crash. </s>

<s> i have tryed epson and the drivers are the same as on the install disc! </s>
<s> While I disagree it's the Epson drivers, you can always pack it up and get something else. </s>

<s> what do you think is causing my crash? </s>
<s> with the printer unplugged and the drivers uninstalled i get no problem </s>
