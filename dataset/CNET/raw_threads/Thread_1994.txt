I also have connected devices (PVR's) at different points in my house that are connected via the 4 ports of the router. I recently came upon a spare wireless b access point, linksys as well, that I was planning to connect to the network through one of the cat 5s that was being used by a PVR. Is this possible ? I did try connecting it, and the signal is excellent in that area, but I do not have internet access with that connection. (it's listed as a seperate possible connection point) Might it be because the 1st wireless device has WEP? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance. Greg Hribal gregpd@aol.com

But, as you said it is a B type.. so you will get the B speed (11mbps).
