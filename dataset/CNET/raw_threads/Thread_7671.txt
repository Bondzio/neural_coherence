The only HDMI cables I've ever had any problems with have been the free ones I got from Comcast. Frys once had 6' HDMI cables on sale for $2 each, and I bought 6 of them. Not one of them has given me any problems. For $6 you aren't risking much to give it a shot. Good luck.

Do DVI cables carry sound as well as video? Since the DVI connections I've seen come out of the graphics card, I'm inclined to doubt it.

Even, if you use VGA, I'm sure if you look closely see if an audio port is present as well, many have that too, just need the typical PC audio cable. My setup has it and I connect my laptop VGA and audio to the TV. tada ------Willy
