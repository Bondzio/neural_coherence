Next time it starts to boot, enter the bios section, verify *all* setting and if it can do that alone, very probable the psu is OK, however keep that in mind. Once you verified or reset any bios setting, save upon exit and reboot. It should error or not and hopefully finish the boot process. If th problem returns, replace the bios/CMOS battery. After replacing the battery, follow the above instructions again, what are the results now. If it boots, great you had a bad battery. If not, reduce the psu strain and make the system as simple as possible. If it appears it boots with no HD or CD drives attached then suspect the psu is weak or failing, replace with better one. Check results after replacing psu. Some of the common reboot reasons is power safe feature in bios set to reboot upon error or a heat setting reached. Check those values under whatever name they have, disable or uncheck them, retry for results. Look into areas... tada -----Willy

Then refresh the bios of that new status. If the LED glow continues it maybe a problem, but I wouldn't jump on that alone. If all proves fruitless, then you may have a bad mtrbd.. Its possible to remove from system and test(cardboard surface) on the old kitchen table and see what gives. If problem persists then basically, you've done all you can, new parts? You say you tried another psu, that psu must be equal or even better than old one. Don't suspect because it worked elsewhere, review what specs it provides, again don't take anything for granted. tada -----Willy

Also, tell us what you did to research every BIOS setting. I was not happy to learn on a few boards you had to change the RAM supply voltage manually. But then again it's something a home builder would expect. Bob
