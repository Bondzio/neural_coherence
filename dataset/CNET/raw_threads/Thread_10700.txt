13769	0	200091	2148435	NR	Byhtomit	8/21/06 2:23 PM	1.15617018E12	Looking for LCD with high resolution	I have two NEC 22&quot; CRT monitors that I use for work that are attached to a single BFG GeForce 7800 GTX OC 512MB. In order to obtain the most desktop real estate available, I run each monitor resolution at 2048 x 1536 x 32-bit color at 85Hz. Now I am looking to replace these monitors with LCD equivalents, but I don't want to lose the wonderful resolution that I am so used to having. Other than the Dell's 3007WFP 30-inch Wide-Screen Flat Panel LCD, does anyone know of any other vendors that sell LCD monitors that support this high of resolution or higher? Thanks, Timothy
