You will stumble into eBay &quot;stores&quot; that have a lot of used and &quot;as is&quot; computer hardware. I never spent money to tinker with hard drives in such a manner, though. If you perform the operation, let us know how it goes. Personally, I go for new drives. Rebate specials on 250GB and larger drives for $70-$100 are more attractive to me. The warranty is nice, too.
