if you're saying the ext.
backup disk is already corrupted, then reformat.
use win7 own format routine and be ntfs type, provided of course whatever data is now coming from the working system.
once done, use win7 own backup pgm.
for such.
unless, you have other capable back-up(vendor provided) and win7 ready, do what you feel seems ok. last, whenever using the ext.
hd be sure to actually dismount it via the s/w, once it says done, then unplug it.
if you want to save the current data, then google for &quot;recovery s/w&quot;, i believe the sticky post here as links as well, check it.
