the days in which a motherboard came with an onboard video and no video slot are long gone but cheapskate systems still exist.
adding a separate video card will be easy - just plug it in, the problem will be in making use of it to the full.
cheap pc's with onboard video usually have weaker than normal components so, even if you add an excellent video card later the pc will still struggle to run a demanding game.
if you're not a gamer then yes, by all means, buy a cheaper pc and upgrade it later.
otherwise you will be disappointed of the results.
