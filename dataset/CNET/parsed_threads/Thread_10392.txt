<s> You can howver install SP2. </s>
<s> If you can't do that then again, you're stuck. </s>
<s> Unless you had problems in the past with the SP1 install, then no reason why not to proceed if on to SP2 as well. </s>
<s> Its really needed into the many small improvements as those needed to better secure the system of the latest attacks out there now. </s>
<s> Its prudent action to update provided you have orginal OS. </s>

<s> The changes are only available to XP SP1. </s>
<s> In fact I found problems that were not resolved till SP2. </s>
<s> The only way for USB 2.0 to be almost perfect is in SP2. </s>
<s> Why not make a new post in the XP Forum and see if you can get help to get up to SP2? </s>
