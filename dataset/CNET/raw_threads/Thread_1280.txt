I have several external HDs that I use primarily for music and image storage. From time to time, the drive letters associated with a particular HD will switch to another drive letter. This renders the pathing of my playlists useless! Is there a way to 'lock' a drive letter to a specific HD?

Read http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20051110.gts4nov10/BNStory/Technology/Troubleshooter Do this for EACH DRIVE. If any are at the same letter or you leave them at lower letters they can get &quot;bumped.&quot; Bob PS. I did see an utility but it was only for older windows.
