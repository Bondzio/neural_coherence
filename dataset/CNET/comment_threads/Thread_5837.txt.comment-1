I've got a Pentium 4 2.4 Ghz Intel processor with Windows XP.
I bought a local non-branded 300 Watt casing for my system here, which is working perfectly fine except for one thing.
Recently my computer has started making annoying noises, i checked Cnet's Help guide to cleaning the pc, and I cleaned my pc, cleaned all the fans and everything.
This casing has two fans, one in the power supply, and another at the top of the casing, a small fan which seems like an extra to me in this casing, guess they were just trying to make the casing more attractive by putting in the extra fan.
Now i checked and the upper fan is making ALL the noise, when i stop this fan, all noise ceases, and even after cleaning this fan is making a lot of noise, although the noise has decreased than before but it is still highly annoying.
I wanted to know if I can just disable this fan and put it away, as I don't think it's of much use in the pc, the casing already has a power supply fan, processor fan, and a video card fan, this seems like an extra.
Please tell me if i can just remove this fan from my pc, or any other tips, also, if I can remove it, is there any safe way of doing it?
There are two red and black wires going from my power supply to the center of the fan.
Help me, my ears are killing me!
