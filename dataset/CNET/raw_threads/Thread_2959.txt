When I plug my USB mouse into both USB ports, it works fine. But when I try the same thing with my camera. . and Palm Pilot, I don't get a response when I try to synchronize. The strange thing is my computer does make a .wav sound when I try to sync the Palm, it just never makes a connection. But it does recognize it. I don't have any conflicts in my hardware manager and I haven't installed anything new other than the Windows XP updates. Some background my my system, I'm running Windows XP on a Dell Dimension desktop - 600 meg, 128 megs of RAM. Any help you can provide is greatly appreciated!

The Palm Pilot is another issue. It's either related to above, the configuration/version of Hotsync or you have one of the models in which the USB port gets blown out (m500?) Bob
