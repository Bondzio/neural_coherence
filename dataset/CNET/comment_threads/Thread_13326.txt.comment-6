indicate a limitation of 4GB for that MB.
Might check to see if that's a limitation of the Intel G31/Intel ICH7 chipset....and therefore your MB.
MB specs show: &quot;4 x240-pin DIMM, Max.
4 GB, DDR2 1066*/800/667 Non-ECC,Un-buffered Memory Dual Channel memory architecture *Support max.
2 DIMM modules only for yellow DIMMs when over-clock to DDR2-1066 *When installing four DDR2 DIMM modules, install only single-sided memory modules.
*When installing total memory of 4GB capacity or more, WindowsR 32-bit operation system may only recognize less than 3GB.
Hence, a total installed memory of less than 3GB is recommended.&quot; If you truly need a system supporting that much more RAM, you'll probably need to switch to a new HW platform.
