just purchased a lexar usb 2.0 256mb jumpdrive.
anyone know of a password protection program (free would be ok also), that can be installed on the usb jumpdrive to proctect data?
i want something that can be installed on the jumpdrive itself so there's no need to install a program on every computer the drive is used on, that would not be a practical option for me.
