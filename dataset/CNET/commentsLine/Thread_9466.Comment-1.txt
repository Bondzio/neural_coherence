i'm setting up a home network with a netgear rp614 router.
i have a dell laptop running xp pro.
i use the laptop at work, where the it dept.
has assigned static ip's to all clients.
my ip config is as follows: ip address: 10 218 154 11 subnet: 255 255 255 0 default gateway: 10 218 154 253 primary dns: 24 92 228 12 secondary: 24 92 228 173 so in order to be able to use my laptop at home i envisioned setting up my router's dhcp to something like: 10 218 154 100 to 10 218 154 254 but then i'm not sure about the dns.
i would need the dns to be the same as the default gateway?
right?
so is there a way around this?
or another way to do this perhaps?
