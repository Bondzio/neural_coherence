<s> thx alot for all the help, greatly appreciate it, i've got everything decided but the RAM and HDD, what u guys think i should be looking at? </s>
<s> I'm assuming that you got the AMD64 processor. </s>
<s> The Ram and HB in the previous post is a good choice, if you want a bigger HD you could get a 160bg. </s>
<s> In order to keep up with the CPU DRR 3200 is the minium speed. </s>

<s> You will want to get a hard drive with the longest warranty possible. </s>
<s> I try to aim for 3 years. </s>
<s> Though last time I checked most have dropped their warranty support to one year. </s>
<s> And to get a &quot;serial&quot; hdd and cable. </s>
<s> Though that won't be hard since &quot;serial&quot; has taken over the market. </s>
<s> You could try to get a hdd with 10,000 rpm, though I'm not sure if such extra speed is necessary. </s>
<s> The 8mb buffer is nice. </s>
<s> Two other considerations. </s>
<s> SCSI/raid. </s>
<s> Both promise faster performance and both add considerable cost to your PC(especially scsi) </s>
<s> if u still wanna get really good stuff, go with the: RAM- Kingston HyperX PC3200 400MHz (4x512MB) Harddrive- Seagate 160GB 7,200RPM 8MB cache the HyperX is the best RAM that the best RAM company offers. </s>
<s> I have also heard lots of really good things about seagate harddrives. </s>
