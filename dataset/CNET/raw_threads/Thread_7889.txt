I am after another 27&quot; monitor around the same price range. I really like the mac monitor with its glossy finish so would like something similar only compatible with windows and not so expensive. I've checked out the Samsung LS27A850DS and the new Dell Ultrasharp U2713HM. But I can't make my mind up. What do you believe is the better of the two? Or do you have any other suggestions? I will not be using for gaming but rather, photoshop, image editing etc (I'm a web developer / designer) Thanks

Since you are using photoshop then either look nice enough to me and all I would do is install it then calibrate it with my Pantone Huey or Spyder. Bob
