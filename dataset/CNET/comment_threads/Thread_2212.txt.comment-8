I am leaning towards the DS4.. mainly because it has onboard firewire ports, and I want to have both USB and Firewire ports out the front of my case for easy access.
It also has additional memory slots for expansion - many of the other boards seem to only have 2 slots, so if you want to upgrade later, you need to discard you current memory sticks and buy larger ones.
I would much rather just add to the existing memory.
However, as I said earlier, my dealer said all the 965 chipset Gigabyte boards have been recalled because of defects in the chipsets.
New one are expected within the next month or so.
I am in no hurry.. the E6600 won't be available until mid to late September, if I am lucky!
Thanks for all the responses.
