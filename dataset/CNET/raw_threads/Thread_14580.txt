As far as I can tell, this is a new product that should not be on the shelves yet. It is not yet on the US Samsung website (although it is on the Canadian site) and I have found only one site that has this as a pre-order. Anyway, the price was good so I bought it and I was wondering if anyone knows anything about this product.

My first impression was, &quot;pretty solid display&quot;. It did not come with any dead pixels or back light bleeding. I haven't calibrated it yet, but from what I can see it won't require any major adjustments. The screen displays crisp, well defined images. Max resolution is 1680x1050. Text is very readable as my wife pointed out since she does a lot of word, typing, etc. You can fit two word, or windows in it without a problem and it's very readable. As I'm typing I'm standing about 3 to 4 feet behind it and it's as good as it can get. Its base holds the monitor securely and it doesn't vibrate as you adjust it. Its height is decently adjustable, it tilts front and back, and it also rotates to the vertical, and I mean vertical, unlike some gateway reviews i've seen. All the menu buttons are on the front of the display, all its inputs/outputs are on the back and side for the extra audio/video/composite. It doesn't come with any USB ports if you're looking for that feature. It does come with the DVI cable, although it's not gold tipped, and the VGA one. It also comes with a cd that contains drivers, rotation software which works perfectly, and a color/mode tool. It also has built in speakers that are decent for very basic ops. If you want something decent get it separately. What else. Set up was easy and I' going to paste information that came with the cd for specs on the unit and I hope this helped you decide.

I am using the analog cable and the picture is terrific but I have no sound. I've done all system checks so I have to imagine it's the monitor. Any input would be appreciated!
830	5	162854	1849555	1848860	WakkoWarner	4/1/06 8:35 AM	1.1438805E12	you need a cable	if you look underneath your monitor, right by the dvi cable input there's an input for sound and that's where you need to hook the sound cable in.
830	6	162854	1881626	1838568	inspectorgw	4/17/06 5:41 PM	1.14529566E12	Bought one too, but have one problem with it	So far this monitor has been great except for one problem. The 1680x1050 resolution is only working in analog mode. I cannot get it to work in digital mode. Instead it downgrades to 1280x1024 resolution and clips the output. I can still get to the clipped areas by panning the screen by moving the mouse to the edge of the screen. Is this expected or should I exchange the monitor? I was planning on going back to the store and have them test this on another monitor and see if the blame is on my old video card.

830	8	162854	1885005	1881626	blank0mind	4/19/06 12:03 PM	1.14544818E12	It's the card, not the monitor	I had exactly the same problem with an old video card. It seems that some early DVI video cards can't support 1680 by 1050 over the DVI port, but will do so over the VGA port. I upgraded my video card and now have it working at 1680 by 1050 in DVI mode.
830	9	162854	1885036	1838568	blank0mind	4/19/06 12:31 PM	1.14544986E12	Some more info on video modes.	I also got this monitor, and one of the reasons I went for it over the similar LG monitor is that the Samsung has the 3 video inputs. If you are looking for an HDTV, you should get an HDTV and not a computer monitor, but having the video inputs seemed useful to me. If you are looking at this monitor for its video inputs, you should be aware that the component video will only go up to a 480p signal. A &quot;film mode&quot; is available for interlaced video as well. The DVI port is HDCP compliant, so it looks like you might be able feed a HDTV signal to this monitor that way, BUT I can't find anywhere in the docs what HDTV resolution might be supported, if any. I'd guess 720p, but I do not have anything that makes a HDTV signal to test this with. Anyway, I got this as a computer monitor and am very happy with it.

Funny thing is, I was calling them (Samsung product support) from Bestbuy to learn more because no one knew about it, and strangely enough, even Samsung reps couldn't tell me anything. I had also the Gateway FPD2185W, and let me tell you, it is crap compared to this Samsung!! CNET's reviewers gave it close to 8 points, I thought it was exaggerated. This Samsung supports High Definition input through its component with resolutions of 480p 720p and 1080i. Very crisp and vivid picture. I compared the gateway side by side, and the Samsung takes the Gateway out easily. I have tried it with the xBOX 360 and boy I tell you it is wonderful. Its 8ms refresh rate and 1000:1 contrast give you a superb quality. Really, if you are looking to spend nearly $600, this is your monitor. It gives you 3 years (!) of warranty compared to lousy 1 year with Gateway. Oh yes also their sales and support suck and shameful. Go for the Samsung!!
