neccisarily bother with creative, yes they may have a nice marketing campaign, but generally their products are subpar in terms of audio quality and the like, i'd look at turtle beach, m-audio, auzentech, or chaintech (if they still make their sound card, it was considered an excellent value).
as far as creative fixing their driver situation, wouldn't say much in their favor, i've tried various driver revisions from creative, all of them have similar problems (even with years between them) after enough time, and no it isn't a motherboard driver gone awry, it is creative's fault on this.
i'd suggest looking at: turtle beach's riviera 5.1 - ~$30 m-audio's revolution 5.1 - ~$100 auzentech's x-plosion - ~$100 and chaintech's av-710.
- ~$20 (like i said, a good value) granted, these cards don't have eax 5 (or whatever revision creative is up to) however most games don't support it, and disabling eax in a game in favor of traditional h/w 3d mixing doesn't have hardly any effect on quality of 3d sound (directsound is actually capable enough of surround mixing).
if you're wondering why the turtle beach and chaintech boards are cheaper, they don't feature onboard dsps, which doesn't really mean anything (it saves you money, and increases cpu use by something like 1%, don't believe creative's marketing)
