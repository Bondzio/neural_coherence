I'm trying to figure out how to get a decent computer for a low price - like $400 to $700 or so. (including a monitor / LCD especially if the price is toward the high end) What I will be using it for is net surfing, graphics editing (including pics captured by my digital camera), audio recording and editing (at least stereo, maybe sometimes 4 or more simultaneous channels) (from cassette, CD, 33rpm, reel-to-reel, etc), video capture (from VHS and other formats) and editing, games (Half-Life, maybe Half-Life 2 when it's under $20 (or when Team Fortress 2 comes out and is down to $20-30), etc)... I will want to run Windows XP on it, and be able to simultaneously dual boot Linux or a similar OS. I already have an 80GB hard drive and a 250GB hard drive in my dad's computer. Some specs I am thinking I might need/want: 1.4 to 2GHz CPU (I'm flexible on this - if I don't need something that fast I'm willing to go as low as 1 to 1.2GHz) a quiet power-supply RAM - at LEAST 1GB!!! 2 or 4GB or even 8GB would be better. hard drive - I already have one, but an extra one equal to the total capacity of what I currently have (this could be used for backups as it would take more dual-layer DVD's than I want to use, and my &quot;backups&quot; consist of a complete bit-for-bit mirror of the hard drive. dual-layer multiformat 8X or faster DVD burner high-end sound card (for example Creative Audigy Platinum with front / external controls and plugins, or something else that's recommended, preferably with at least 4 or 8 channel (or more) simultaneous input capability. a good video card (with capture (or a separate capture card) The monitor/LCD depends on where I put my computer. If I integrate it into my full-sized upright piano, I could put a 15&quot; LCD monitor in there. I would want to be able to run AT LEAST 1280x960, preferablly 1408x1056 or 1600x1200 or higher. If I put the computer somewhere else (although I may have trouble finding a place for it) I would want a monitor capable of at least 2048x1536 @ 80 Hz, preferably as high as 2560x1920 @ 75 Hz. a good high-speed network card multimedia/internet keyboard and multi-button optical wheel mouse (wireless might be nice, name-brand is a huge plus) front USB 2.0,sound,etc. ports Ok, now for the notebook: This one is more severely budget limited, so my specs won't be as demanding... (max of $350, preferably $250 or lower) This one I mainly would be using for transfering stuff from my mp3 player/recorder and digital camera, and maybe occasionally other things CPU speed probably up to 1GHz RAM - 256MB would probably be OK OS - Windows 2000 (although XP would be nice) sound - decent - doesn't need to be professional quality, but not a cheapie solution display - at least 1280x960, preferably 1600x1200 or higher resolution hard drive - either 20GB (if I also get a USB 2.0 external hard drive enclosure which would be included in my budget) or 40GB to 80GB if I don't get the external enclosure USB 2.0 ports (1.1 is too slow) battery holds at least a 3 to 4 hour charge (2.5 under heavy use) Any other suggestions? And where should I look for something? I realize ebay is probably the most likely if not the only option for the notebook (in which case I would insist on one with a good/new battery) but what should I look for? I could wait several months to get a computer and/or notebook, but I don't want to be rushed into a buying decision when the time comes.
