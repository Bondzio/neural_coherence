Hello I installed a slave drive for backup,but when I restart my computer it does not show up in My Computer every time.
Sometimes it shows up but not always.
I'm afraid to put anything important on here in case I can't access it when I need it.
The Bios has it listed there as a slave drive.
I went into Disk Management and formatted it and assigned it a drive letter,but the next time I turned on my computer it was gone.
I am running XP Home on a desktop Emachines T6216, which is 1 year old.
Thanks in advance of any help you can give me.
Wendy
