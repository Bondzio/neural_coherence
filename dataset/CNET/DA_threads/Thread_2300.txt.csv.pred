1.2.1	The free printer does not come with a cable , so you 'll need to get one for about $ 25 .	St
1.2.2	-Jason	St
1.3.1	There is better out there .	St
1.3.2	Emachines T6520 Package for $ 669.97 after rebates +Better CPU with 64 bit capability +More RAM +Larger harddrive +PCI Express x16 for upgrades +Better ATI Xpress 200 chipset with 128mb of shared memory for integrated graphics .	St
1.3.3	+15 in .	St
1.3.4	LCD Monitor However I would reccomend the Emachines T6522 for $ 689.97 after rebates .	St
1.3.5	+Better CPU with 64 bit capability +Larger Harddrive than the Dell and T6420 +More RAM than the Dell +Has a TV Tuner unlike the T6520 and your Dell 3000 +PCI Express x16 for upgradability +Socket 939 Motherboard However if you were willing to spend close to a grand without rebates then you could go dual-core .	St
1.3.6	These systems are more then your 3000 with the free printer and extended waranty .	St
1.3.7	However , you get so much more for only a $ 100 difference .	St
1.3.8	Better deal .	St
1.4.1	That first computer is selling for $ 1000 though .	St
1.4.2	And those are without any warranty .	St
1.4.3	Also , chip seems worse than what I 'm getting with the 3000 .	St
1.5.1	In terms of performance ( especially in gaming ) the AMD Athlon 64 has always been superior to the Intel P4 in most catagories .	St
1.5.2	Just look at the Benchmarks .	St
1.5.3	*Note that the first system I showed you had the Athlon 64 3400+ and the other was the 3500+ .	St
1.5.4	Intel has got caught in the clockspeed war , thinking that more clockspeed equals faster cpu .	St
1.5.5	That is not true .	Res
1.5.6	Without getting technical , AMD has found otherways to find performance with their chips design such as a fast FSB ( Front Side Bus ) .	St
1.5.7	The best cpu out there is an AMD FX-57 , not an Intel .	St
1.5.8	If you want some technical stuff read this Discussion Also note that the P4 in your Dell does not have 64-bit capability which will be necessary for future applications .	St
1.5.9	In other words , the Emachines will last longer .	St
1.5.10	In regards to the warranty , all Emachines feature a 1 year limited warranty that feature , 1 .	St
1.5.11	One-year guarantee on Parts and Labor .	St
1.5.12	2 .	St
1.5.13	One-year technical support via telephone .	St
1.5.14	You can read about it http : //www.emachines.com/support/warranty_info.html # std_warr If 1 year is n't long enough for you , you can purchase an extended warranty through Emachines .	St
1.5.15	Just scroll down on that page .	St
1.5.16	Also , Circuitcity and Bestbuy will offer their own warranties to you as well .	St
1.5.17	Either way your covered .	St
1.5.18	IMO if your computer has faulty hardware or software you will see a problem within 1 year and extended waranties are unnecessary .	St
1.5.19	If you take care of your computer you will not need it .	St
1.5.20	Also , note that if you buy a Dell printer ink is not popular in stores such as Staples , Officemax , and Walmart .	St
1.5.21	So you will need to buy your ink online if you buy a Dell printer .	Sug
1.5.22	Those computers are both in the $ 1000 range but with rebates they are within your budget .	St
1.6.1	I know this is not the main point of this chain , but since the printer cable was at least brought up earlier I thought I would through my 2 cents in .	St
1.6.2	YES - you do need a printer cable if you get the Dell Printer .	St
1.6.3	I think you may need it for about any printer ( they just do n't come with them for some reason ) BUT instead of the $ 25 from Dell/Bst Buy/Circuit City - try ebay .	St
1.6.4	I got a 10 ft one for $ 2.99 I found for little stuff like cords and cables ebay has great prices .	St
1.6.5	another example I got a 10 ft ethernet cord for like $ 5.99 ( $ 30+ in normal stores ) again , minor point but still something I thought I would mention	St
1.7.1	I was aware to buy USB on ebay ... thanks though .	Polite
1.7.2	Any other recommendations on items/wires/computer items that are better purchased on ebay instead of by dealer ?	Ques
