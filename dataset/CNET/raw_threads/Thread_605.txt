Ideally, I would like to find a card that could sound as well as video through the HDMI port. Would most video cards with an HDMI port be capable of sound output, or would I need to look for a special feature on the card? (Also, I have no real plans on gaming on it. The most graphically demanding operation is probably just playing Blu-ray on it. If I can find a slim blu-ray drive.) Here is the case and motherboard I am planning on purchasing in case this has any affect on a recommendation. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811163170&amp;cm_re=Silverstone_SG07-_-11-163-170-_-Product http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131709&amp;Tpk=ASUS%20P8H67-I Thanks!

Have you selected the exact processor you want and checked to see which Intel graphics offering it has? I might suggest something in the i5 range due to possible heat considerations and you don't need the unlocked versions. You might want to put the box together and see how well it does before adding a discrete video card.
