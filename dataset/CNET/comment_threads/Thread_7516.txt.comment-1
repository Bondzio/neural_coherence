I just got a new Core 2 Quad, Q9550, to replace my core 2 duo, E6600, but when I installed it there is no display on the monitor.
I checked to see if i installed it right, which I did, but still no display.
I have since put my old processor back, and my computer works fine.
Anyone know what might be wrong?
