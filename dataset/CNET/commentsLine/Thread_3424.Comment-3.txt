the iomega site is naturally the first place i checked.
the &quot;support&quot; offered there is nominal, and they definitely aren't making it easy for customers to get in touch with them.
i like your backup method; it's similar to what i've been doing since iomega backup has been misbehaving.
it would make life easier, though, to find a program that would synchronize a specific catalog of files with the backup folder.
i have a list of about 15 folders and several individual files that need to be backed up frequently, and selecting them individually is a pain.
