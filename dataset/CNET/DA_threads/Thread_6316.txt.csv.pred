1.1.1	Believing that the sector map is used by the operating system to determine where ( track & sector ) to put a block of data I would suspect that RAID-1 should be able to be moved as the controller was & quot ; just & quot ; writing each block to two disks at the same time .	St
1.1.2	Putting either disk in a new system and recreating the mirror should be straight forward .	St
1.1.3	When it comes to RAID-0 the game gets complicated as there are 'stripe width & quot ; issues as well as track & sector assignments to be considered .	St
1.1.4	Is there standardization among implementations ?	Ques
1.1.5	Will a 250G 2 disk RAID-0 array from an Intel mobo be readable in an AMD system ?	Ques
1.1.6	( I 'm looking for some lost legal document images on dead systems with on board PATA RAID controllers ) .	St
1.2.1	Almost any ON BOARD RAID is a crap shot if the drives will transplant .	St
1.2.2	In fact it rarely works making a fine business for those in the recovery business .	St
1.2.3	Given what 's at stake , why did n't they make a backup ?	Ques
1.2.4	Or were they lulled into believing by someone that RAID 1 was a backup ?	Ques
1.2.5	And I see a mention of RAID 0 .	St
1.2.6	With those I have yet to see but a few transplants over the years .	St
1.2.7	Folk try it and learn the bitter truth .	Sug
1.2.8	Bob	St
1.3.1	from 1 computer to another but the likelihood of it working properly so that you can access and read the data ... ..slim and none .	St
1.3.2	Is it possible there 's a PC with the exact same hardware configuration you could try it in ?	Ques
1.3.3	VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	I ca n't speak for RAID 0 but with RAID 1 it should be easy enough to create an image of the set and restore it to the set once moved .	St
1.4.2	I 've only done this once but had no trouble doing so .	St
1.4.3	Eventually I moved away from RAID and re-worked my backup plan .	St
1.4.4	I 've had RAID sets break a time or two with or without there being an actually hardware failure .	St
1.4.5	The reality is that rebuilding these arrays once broken is far more time consuming than using other backup/restore methods .	St
1.4.6	Another issue is that , if one drive breaks , you 're better off buying another pair than trying to find and replace a failed drive .	St
1.4.7	Newer drives also have some wonderful features that cause them to & quot ; recalibrate & quot ; themselves and can break your RAID set .	St
1.4.8	You need to shop for drives designed for RAID use and they 'll cost you more .	St
1.4.9	My opinion is that it 's no longer worth the effort .	St
1.4.10	Good luck .	Polite
1.5.1	Thanks to all who posted so promptly .	St
1.5.2	As I feared a RAID-0 is a & quot ; one-off & quot ; animal with no similarities to any other array EXCEPT one built by the same RAID Controller chip or board .	St
1.5.3	It is so true that one broken drive too soon becomes one of a set of broken drives ; so best practice is to rebuild onto new hardware .	St
1.5.4	Thanks for the tip about & quot ; self-calibrating & quot ; drives that become & quot ; self-breaking & quot ; arrays ...	St
1.5.5	I did n't see that one coming ( better is in the eye of the beholder ) .	St
1.6.1	backup ... ..the busted RAID 0 woud n't have mattered at all .	St
1.6.2	VAPCMD	St
