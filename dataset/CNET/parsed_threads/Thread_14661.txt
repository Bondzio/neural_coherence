<s> im gonna get a comp with a **Intel Core2 Duo Processor E6550 (4MB L2 Cache,2.33GHz,1333 FSB) ** what is that compared to a single core?.. </s>
<s> i need a 2.6ghz for a game i wana play, would it equal out to atleast that? </s>
<s> anyone know exactly what itd compare to single intel pentium ghz? </s>
<s> thanx for any help lol. </s>
<s> It's better to have a 2.33 Dual Core than it is to have just one 2.66. </s>
<s> Dual core is able to process information because it has two (obviously) chips working, whereas the 2.66 is only one. </s>
<s> This way, with dual core, your system wont choke or anything when there's too much info being processed. </s>
