<s> I have a wireless network with 2 PC's on it - a desktop running WinXP and a Laptop running Vista. </s>
<s> I would like to add an old PC running Win98 to the network. </s>
<s> I am willing to wipe the HDD, and purchase and install a fresh copy of Win98SE if necessary, as I have discovered FE isn't supported by anything I have found. </s>
<s> The computer doesn't have the specs to run WinXP, so that's out. </s>
<s> It also doesn't have any USB ports, so a PCI card will be needed. </s>
<s> I just want it to be able to share my broadband internet connection at minimum. </s>
<s> Any suggestions on a wireless PCI card for a Win98 (or Win98SE) PC? </s>
<s> Thank you for your input! </s>
<s> Been there, done that, got the scars. </s>
<s> But it'll be a fun project. </s>
<s> Stick with brand names. </s>
<s> I'm partial to D-link for all networking parts. </s>
<s> Get one of their wireless PCI cards, it'll come with the install CD with the drivers for W98SE. </s>
