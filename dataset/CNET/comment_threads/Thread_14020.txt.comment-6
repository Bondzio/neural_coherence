This was just a deal on four sticks of 256 and im building a comp for a friend and tryin to save him money.
However, we would both like to spend a little more for dependability, and to save hassle in the future.
and from what it sounds like no one is getting night and day differences, even on online articles, between running four vs two and dual channel vs single, ECT.
Thanks for the help!
