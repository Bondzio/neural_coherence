I have a personally built PC with AMD 1.4Ghtz, 2 hard drives, DVD burner, and broadband.
A few months ago a strange problem started occurring.
Whenever I power-up the computer, within the first 5 minutes of it being on it will either freeze, automatically restart, or the screen will go black.
Either way I have to totally restart the computer.
This problem can occur once, a couple times a day, or it can be a couple days before it happens again.
There are no viruses, and a brand new power supply.
Any help would be appreciated.
