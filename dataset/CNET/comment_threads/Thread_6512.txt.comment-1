I have seen at several places on these that several of you have or want to add multiple fans.
Why?
Where do the go?
I am looking at the Asus A8N-SLI Premium or the Asus A8N-SLI Deluxe mobo.
Not sure of the difference between the 2 with maybe the 4400 or 4800 processor.
So why do we need more than one fan?
Confused.
