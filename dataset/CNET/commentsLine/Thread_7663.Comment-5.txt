hi -searched the forum and found your old question regarding quicken 2007!
how did you make out with that?
i have xp so needless to say, i have learned the hard way, that simply backing up on a cd like we did in the 'old' days, by selecting a drive and backing up on a floppy just isn't possible!
according to microsoft, in order for quicken to write a back up file directly to the cd-r or cd-rw, the compact disc must first be formatted and support 'packet writing'.
the windows xp cd recording program does not support packet writing and does not contain a feature to format a recordable cd.
so, i have an external hard drive backing it up but i still long for a way to format the re-writable cd's.
i know some people are using a staging area saving method which, again, is just too complicated.
any suggestions?
thanks, archer.....
