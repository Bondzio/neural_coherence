<s> Error mess: No bootable devices selected I go into system re order the boot first options (selecting cd/dvd/cd-rw drive, Internal HDD, and Diskette Drive) Then try to reboot, It's not working, because I keep getting the message that 1)Primary Hard disk not found, 2)Fixed Optical drive not found I don't have a recovery cd to run with this Any Suggestions? </s>
<s> If this was mine and I was not going to have it repaired I'd open it up to check if the hard disk was connected proper. </s>
<s> Same for the CD unit. </s>
