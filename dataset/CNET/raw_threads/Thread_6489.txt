I have a cable connection from comcast running at 6Mbps. What kind of hardware and or software would I need and where do I start getting myself ready for this venture. I am starting a computer repair company with a friend of mine as we both have knowledge with building and repairing them but we were thinking of venturing into the ISP if it would be feasible for us. Thanks to all who respond.
