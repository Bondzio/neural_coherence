I would like to build my own computer.
Of course, budget is a main concern.
Is there any place where all components can be had?
It needs at least a 1 GHz processor, 512 MB of ram, and all the other usual fittings.
At least a 1.5 GHz dual-core processor and at least 1 GB of RAM would be preferable.
Help!
