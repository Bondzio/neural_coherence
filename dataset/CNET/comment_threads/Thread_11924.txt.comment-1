I would like to update my desktop with a new video card.
I have a Dell Dimension 4400 with 640mb's of DDR ram.
I am running Windows XP home.
The current card is an ATI Rage 128 with 16mb.
I don't play games but the video seems slow.
I understand that I have a 250 watt power supply so I would be limited to ram size in the replacement.
Now the question!
Could I run a card with 128 mb and TV out?
What would be a compatible card for my system that could be had for under say $75?
Thanks
