How do I stop this madness?! Believe it or not, Netgear forums are of no help. I've been told to make sure the IP of the repeater is outside the range of the base-station. I thought I did that. I assume from the error messages, I haven't done it right. Of course, I can't even check because I can't log into the repeater, only the base-station. Can't remember how to log into the repeater. Help!

Your complaint is well known and I lay the issue at the maker's door. OK, but how do I extend a router's coverage? I use this phrase on google if you don't know about it -&gt; How to use a router as a WAP? I never have this issue with the usual WAP setup. -&gt; As to your login to the repeater, I find myself resetting the repeater to it's factory setting then doing it all over. Bob

If you can't log in, you may need to reset to factory defaults. - Under &quot;Advanced&quot; and &quot;LAN Setup&quot;, uncheck &quot;Use Router as DHCP Server&quot;. Then select &quot;Apply&quot; and reset router. - Connect the LAN port from the first router to a LAN port on the second router (don't use the WAN or Internet port). Power cycle both devices. - You should be able to reconnect all devices with no IP conflict, since all devices will get an IP address via DHCP from the first router.
