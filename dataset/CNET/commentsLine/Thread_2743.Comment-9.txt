good grief bob !
it was only a joke!!!
for all i know, ms operating system might install drivers for intel devices (i've never had intel).
i think they have had aliances before.
i was just kidding with you bob.
that was the reason for the smilely.
what you said just sounded kind of funny to me, that you were slighting amd (and i don't really care if you were).
everyone has their preference.
i don't fault those who perfer intel.
i just happen to like amd due to equivalent performance at a lower price.
hope you can see a joke when it is intended.
i'm sorry if you can't.
we're only here to try to give help to others.
but who says we can't have a little fun too?
