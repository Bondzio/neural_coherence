try putting up one of those self-mounting wall shelves, just big enough to hold the fan, about 3 feet away from the computer.
if the fan is on the same piece of furniture or within a couple of feet of the computer you'll get the screen interference every time.
and if you have that flickering on your screen, even if it's faint, it can cause a migraine headache or seizure.
be careful!
