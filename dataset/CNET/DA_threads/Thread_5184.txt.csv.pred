1.1.1	I have a & quot ; stigma tel C major & quot ; sound card ( i think ) and the sound is very dodgey for when i listen to music the voice of a person is very faint and the bass tune is very loud , , the speakers are n't that old either	St
1.2.1	Is the sound & quot ; card & quot ; is not a card , but on a motherboard .	St
1.2.2	Such affairs are low cost options and certain no attention is paid to any frequency response curve since the amplified speakers are likely to be a bundled deal as well .	St
1.2.3	In a line , & quot ; that ai n't hi-fi. & quot ; Be sure to look at all the sound controls in the control panel to be sure someone did n't diddle with the base/treble controls .	St
1.2.4	Some have them , some do n't .	St
1.2.5	New Windows users just need to be shown where these are , but sometimes you ca n't because like most things , the vendors can modify such for more eye-candy .	St
1.2.6	Here ' s a typical picture which may or may not show the bass/treble control .	St
1.2.7	http : //www.tahoma.wednet.edu/SubSite/RCES/Technology_Staff_Dev/Windows/volume.htm In closing , some MP3 players offer a EQUALIZER and I suggest you try Winamp since it has it .	St
1.2.8	http : //www.winamp.com A funny equalizer I tripped over was at http : //www.tweak3d.net/tweak/minisound/2.shtml	St
