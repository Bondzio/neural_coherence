Do I have to wait for a manufacturer to validate a new processor with their board for it to work?
I want to get the Intel Core 2 Duo E7200 Wolfdale processor but it only came out last month and has not been validated with my board yet.
Will I have to wait for validation by the board manufacturer?
Other processors with similar specs work with this board as is.
Here is the response from Gigabyte: hello, core 2 duo E7200 wolfdale with 3 MB cache is new still under validation may need bios update to support cpu ID code please check back with us a week later or keep an eye on this web for cpu support list after validation will listed in there : http://www.gigabyte.com.tw/Support/Motherboard/CPUSupport_Model.aspx?ProductID=2714
