1.1.1	I have a PIII ( 500 MHz ) PC , and I want to replace the motherboard to probably a P4 or a AMD , what are the things I need to look into ?	Ques
1.1.2	I am not a hardware expert , but pretty handy with PC hardware , I have installed DVD writers , video cards etc .	St
1.1.3	Any help is appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	The RAM , Power Supply and not much else can be recycled since RAM changes for the P4 and any power supply that came with a P3 will be lucky to cause beeps on the new system .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	To begin where Robert left off is to suggest too much has happened since the 500mhz system was current .	St
1.3.2	The newer P4 is more demanding plus any other devices to make it a happy medium .	St
1.3.3	Its just better to get all new or any used that is capable .	St
1.3.4	But as mentioned what came with the old system may not cut it .	St
1.3.5	-OR- shop for some OEM that on its own merit provides a jumping point into P4 realm at a bargain , but you take what you get as OEM provided .	St
1.3.6	Look into a eMachine or HP models .	St
1.3.7	Of course that leaves Compaq , Gateway and IBM to consider as well , they 're usually on sale on a regular basis .	St
1.3.8	The choice is yours ... tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	if getting a new system check out the emachines t6212 !	St
1.4.2	its great for the price and good for upgrades .	St
