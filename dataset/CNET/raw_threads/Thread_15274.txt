But I will anyway, I just need some ammunition. When I go to www.speedtest.net, I usually get 4,000 kbps down, 1,000 kbps up, or so. When I'm actually trying to * use * the internet, things get tricky. I get hung browser, page not found, no connectivity, etc. A page either loads rapidly, or not at all, with no rhyme or reason. Is there a utility that I can use to check the * reliability * of my connection? Something that I can create a log, and send to the network people and embarrass them. Or, is it possible I have configuration problems? I'm using Windows Vista Home Premium, with a Dell 1395 Wireless card. Thanx. Dave

Here's a sample ping log: The connection is usually pretty fast, or non-existent.

There is NO FIX you can do on your machine for that. Shared access or free will be unreliable. Sometimes it takes many times and many people to understand this. Bob
