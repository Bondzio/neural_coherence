i did try that with no luck - thanks for the suggestion.
i have noticed that when the windows startup screen goes blank, i then hear the hard drive spin down.
i have disabled all the services and startup entries in msconfig, that made no difference.
i have removed ram sticks one pair at a time, as well as individually, also with no change.
