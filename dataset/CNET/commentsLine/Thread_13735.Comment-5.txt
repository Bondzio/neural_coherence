are you using the windows 7 backup program, the wd supplied backup program, something else, what?
personally i've been using norton ghost for the last 8 years and haven't had the first problem with it.
you can get it for next to nothing if you watch the sales.
another good alternative is easeus todo backup free which you can download from  .
good luck.
