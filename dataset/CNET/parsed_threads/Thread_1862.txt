<s> helo, ok i currently have a modem that goes to a router with 2 phone jacks for my vonage phone service and lan 1 out also goes into computer. </s>
<s> according to its setup disk my netgear wireless router wants to be the first router. </s>
<s> i am afraid this will gum up my vonage signal. </s>
<s> is it ok to have the wireless router first? </s>
<s> anyone with vonage and a wireless router out there who can advise? </s>
<s> thanks - fj </s>
<s> If you're using a Linksys router with the RT31P2 Vonage adapter it will work fine. </s>
<s> Linksys publishes the procedure on their knowledge base ID 358. </s>
<s> I am using the same system with no problems...essentially you &quot;cascade&quot; the routers...change the router IP to 192.168.15.2...disable DHCP...from your modem you connect to Internet port of the RT31P2...connect &quot;ethernet (1) on the RT31P2 to your router (I connected to &quot;4&quot;) All this may sound confusing, at least it does to me, so your best bet is to check out the Linksys Knowledge base...even ask their tech help via e-mail...that's what I did and they were most helpful. </s>
<s> This system works great with no problems - good luck </s>
<s> Sorry...I re-read your question and notice that you are using a Netgear router...and my answer was referring to a Linksys router. </s>
<s> I don't think anything would be THAT much different...you still &quot;cascade&quot; as I describe...I would contact Netgear and get their input. </s>
<s> Incidently, my RT31P2 Vonage router is the &quot;first&quot; one in line from the modem. </s>
<s> sorry if I confused you with the Linksys info </s>
<s> i was feeling kinda frustrated her and you have inspired me. </s>
<s> altho it's been rough, using the wizard for the wireless router it gets to a window that asks for admin/ password and i can't get past it. </s>
<s> i will talk to linksys help tomorrow. </s>
<s> thanks! </s>
