check out this page  which shows the temps in the 60 to 75c range but if you check on google you will find others with similar ranges to mine 63 to 105c.
what i did was to mount a heat-sink on the ich chip but noticed little difference except the temp now never goes over 63c.
i used a remote sensor to confirm the temp sensor heat and it showed 45c where as my machine was showing 75c at that time i believe the problem to be a defective sensor which was confirmed by two separate remote sensors.
check for dg965mq board temp problems in google and you will see we are not alone.
i am happy with the heat-sink and fan i installed which evened out my eratic readings
