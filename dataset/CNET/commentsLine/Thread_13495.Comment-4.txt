i am not trying to find information on how to work a router in general.
i know typical installations.
and it isn't some vista bug that is causing problems because i have two xp machines and one mac that are experiencing the same problem.
i just wanted to know if anybody else is having problems with this brand.
do you have experience with this brand?
