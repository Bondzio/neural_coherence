<s> I RREEAALLY need to know know where i can find drivers (DRIVERS! </s>
<s> NOT FIRMWARE) for my &quot;Samsung SW-216B CD-R/RW Drive&quot; on XP HE. </s>
<s> My drive is more or less 'dead' until I find the drivers. </s>
<s> double check the number: http://www.samsung.com/au/support/productsupport/download/query.aspx?keyword=sw%20216b </s>
<s> The unit works as a CDROM until you install CDRW software. </s>
<s> Many don't know this. </s>
<s> The number seems a little off? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'm positive the number is correct; it's exactly what it says in 'Device Manager'. </s>
<s> So, is there no way to get drivers for either of it's 'dual personalities' (i.e. </s>
<s> ROM and RW)? </s>
<s> The software ID will be some &quot;other&quot; number. </s>
<s> How about the model number that's on the drive? </s>
<s> In closing does http://www.cdburnerxp.se/ work with it? </s>
