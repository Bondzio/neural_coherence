wavy?
like a narrow large s on the left and right?
or it waves as you scroll, as you said?
this usually means you don't have enough video power, video ram; pics and web pages should also take a bit to load all the way down.
this usually happens with 2mb, maybe 4mb vram.
download and use aida32 utility to check... a flat screen doesn't need more vram, so the previous idea of another monitor (crt) is good-quick.
xp?
w98?
directx 8.1 or above?
