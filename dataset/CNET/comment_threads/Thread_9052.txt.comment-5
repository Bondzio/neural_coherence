Thank you for any help I can get.
I am so not a computer person... in fact I'm sort of stuck in the stone age.
Here is my problem.
Every time I try to get on line, I have to reconnect.
My laptop is old, but has been upgraded, and I'm told it's actually a good machine now (dell inspiron 1200, now sporting 80 gig, and windows 7) My router and modem are both new, provided by Cox with the phone bundel.
Sometimes I have to attempt to erconnect several times, and it's a pain.
Any one got a simple fix for the untechy??
?
