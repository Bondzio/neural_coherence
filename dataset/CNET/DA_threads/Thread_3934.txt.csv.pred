1.2.1	I am using the HP 4890 scanner and when I want to enlarge a picture that I scan , I scan it and save it to a file in my pictures and then open it up in MIcrosoft Digital Image 2006.I then change the picture size there and then print the picture .	St
1.2.2	I think you can do the same with most photo editing programs .	St
1.2.3	The only problem is if you take a small picture and try to blow it up too big the quality of the print goes down .	St
1.3.1	Yes !	St
1.3.2	That worked .	St
1.3.3	Thanks for finding a solution for me ( ca n't imagine how they managed to make HP Image Zone so user unfriendly .	St
1.3.4	Anyway am very pleased that at last I can perform such an apparently simple ( but in practice difficult ) task .	St
1.3.5	Thanks again .	St
1.4.1	Yes , HP image zone has a lot to be desired .	St
