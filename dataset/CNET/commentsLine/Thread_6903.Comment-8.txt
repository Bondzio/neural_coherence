can access both the source and target disks and run the restore function of the software that created the image.
so, yes, you can do a complete recovery of an entire partition in this manner.
it's very quick as compared to restoring from scratch with your software and backups...minutes versus hours.
just to clarify the cloning vs imaging methods.
cloning requires free space.
the cloning software does not copy files from place to place.
it copies the raw ones and zeros from the drive sectors and creates the formatted partition in the process.
such is why it destroys other partition data.
it may clone to unpartitioned space on a drive with an existing primary partition but that method would be useless to use to restore another drive.
one advantage of a hard drive image is that it's compressed to about 1/2 the size as all the used space on the drive.
you can place many complete hard drive images on another drive this way.
