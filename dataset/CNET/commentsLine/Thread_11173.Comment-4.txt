psu = power supply unit hsf = heatsink fan setup the power supply/psu can get old and degraded and simply behave as you described, though it could be another problem, i'm betting possibility on the psu being flaky.
further, a hsf over the years can creep away or fall abit due to gravity and heat/cold cycles of running on/off.
you should inspect closely to see or simply reseat the whole hsf setup.
this is located on the cpu itself.
depending on your model hp you may(or not) have a secondary fan blowing on or away for greater cooling effect of the cpu, it may also be just a platstic tube or tunnel to allow the cpu fanm outside air.
