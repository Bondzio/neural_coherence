Can I just go and get any 2.5&quot; IDE drive or do I need a specific one that HP reccomends? I can't find a whole lot of information on HP's support site, it's so fantastic! Thanks for your help.

Same IDE / Power plug etc., but check your BIOS and Manual first to make sure it has an &quot;Auto-Detect&quot; hard drive option. If it can &quot;Auto-detect&quot;, it'll almost certainly be able to use any laptop drive, as these are standard across all makes and models. Seagate's Momentus (one with Perpendicular Storage) would be a good upgrade. These offer better speeds, quicker accesses, lower votage use, and produce less heat than usual (but cost more!). It might inject a bit of extra life into your Laptop. http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/storage/display/seagate-momentus-54003.html GeeBee.
