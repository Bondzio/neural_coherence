I didn't think to check if all the mounting posts were actually under the holes on the board, though I want to say they are.
It will definitely be something worth double checking.
Hopefully there is something there that is causing the issue, as I am fairly frustrated at this point.
I will hope that the manual is right, because it could be fairly nightmarish trying to refit all those little pins over and over until it works.
(I'm not overly tech-savvy, but get the gist of where things are supposed to be.)
