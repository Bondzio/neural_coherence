currently, i have an athlon xp 2000+ cpu and 512mb pc2700 333mhz ram.
i believe the cpu can only operate at the 233 fsb level.
the mb is msi kt333 ultra.
i am looking to upgrade without upgrading the motherboard which can support upto xp 2700+.
would it be worth the money to upgrade to the athlon 2700+ xp cpu and 1gb ram?
