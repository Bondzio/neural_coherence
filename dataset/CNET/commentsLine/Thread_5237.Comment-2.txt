i've used these usb powered drives and after 2 of my own and dozens at the office i can share that they are finicky.
you'll find they work only on some machines, some but not all usb 2.0 ports and the cure is to get a power supply for the unit.
i've had some luck with a 2 to 1 usb cable where it connects to 2 laptop usb ports to eek a little more power.
one of my units uses what i thought at first was a standard a-b usb cable.
but later i figured out that it's cable was &quot;special.&quot; how?
the wires that carry power were double the normal thickness.
nothing's busted here except your device does not work on all setups.
here's the cable i would try -&gt; read paragraph 4 at  bob
