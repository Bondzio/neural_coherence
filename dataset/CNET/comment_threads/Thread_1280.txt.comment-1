If this topic already has a thread, I apologize- I couldn't find it.
I have several external HDs that I use primarily for music and image storage.
From time to time, the drive letters associated with a particular HD will switch to another drive letter.
This renders the pathing of my playlists useless!
Is there a way to 'lock' a drive letter to a specific HD?
