that's probably a good secondary objective, touchy-feely netbooks.
and to be honest, 75% of what i really do can be performed on a netbook.
but we know the real reason for win7 --- maybe everyone will forget about vista.
and just my luck.
i was one of the boobs that bought a pc when windowsme was launched too, and i went and did the same thing with vista.
you would think i would have learned my lesson by now.
