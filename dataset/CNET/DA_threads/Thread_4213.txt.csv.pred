1.1.1	OK, here goes: I have a Vista desktop, and two XP laptops.	St
1.1.2	Desktop is wired to the router.	St
1.1.3	Laptops are wireless.	St
1.1.4	Printer is connected to the network via Ethernet cable to the ROUTER.	St
1.1.5	The desktop can see the printer.	St
1.1.6	It can also see the two laptops on the network.	St
1.1.7	Neither laptop can see nor print to the printer.	St
1.1.8	Help!	St
1.2.1	See if you can ping that address from a laptop.	St
1.2.2	I'm presuming you've already tried to load printer drivers for the laptops and point them to that printer by IP address.	St
1.3.1	I can ping the printer from the one laptop I can get to this morning, and from the desktop.	St
1.3.2	The other laptop used to be able to print to this printer, the one beside me is a new addition to the house, have not run the printer disc on it as it's a netbook.	St
1.3.3	Looking for the disc now.	St
1.3.4	You say to &quot;point them to that printer by IP address&quot; I'm not sure what you mean, could you explain please?	St
1.3.5	(I'm sort of idiot savant, I get &quot;ping&quot; but not how to point a driver, ok, more like just idiot lol)	St
1.4.1	it will want to print to a port.	St
1.4.2	The default is usually LPT1.	St
1.4.3	You should get a message asking if it's a local or network printer.	Ques
1.4.4	You select network printer and follow the instructions to browse to a shared printer or create a port.	St
1.4.5	You will be creating a TCP/IP port that &quot;points&quot; to the printer.	St
1.4.6	It will be the printer's wireless IP address.	St
1.4.7	Hope that explains better.	St
1.5.1	Thanks for the help.	St
1.5.2	None of the original computers on the network had ever needed the driver install before today (using built in drivers, I guess) I did the driver install on the netbook, and pow!	St
1.5.3	there was the printer.	St
1.5.4	Repeated the process on the other XP machine and likewise.	St
1.5.5	Now we can print from any of the computers, regardless of the OS or location!	St
1.5.6	Thanks.	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
