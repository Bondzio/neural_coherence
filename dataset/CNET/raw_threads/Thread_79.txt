In devices manager to a storage controller (do not know what that is) writes that &quot;Windows can not load the device driver for this hardware. Driver may be corrupted or missing. (Code 39)&quot; and is a yellow badge, and next to the stamp writes such a thing - ADPOBOB3 IDE Controller http://www.picshot.pl/public/view/full/141484 Could this be the reason that USB 3.0 does not work as expected? My motherboard is a Gigabyte GA-870A-USB3L I installed the new daemon tools but the problem still exists. I'm from Polish, and poorly know English, I'm sorry for all the errorsin spelling.

But without more details than you supplied in your post, there is little else I can say. Does this Device Manager error affect this computer in any way? If not, then I would be inclined to leave it as it is. If there is a problem, tell us more, eg make/model computer, which OS, what drives you have connected, and what problems there are. Also, why has this suddenly become a problem? Mark

Generally it is not noticed your computer to work somehow innaczej. can, furthermore, that the USB works quite slowly. My Computer: Gigabyte GA-870A-USB3L AMD Phenom X4 955 BE Kingston 4GB DDR3 PC1600 MHz Gigabyte GeForce GTX 550Ti WDC HDD WD5000AAKX-001CA0 ATA Device - 500GB DVD ASUS DRW-24B3ST CHIEFTEC CTG-550-80P (550W) 80 + AREOCOOL PGS VS-9 Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit. I thought that this error has an influence from the USB drive slowly copying the data, but my friend told me that that driver error is related to the optical drive emulator (deamoon tools ect). Once it was gone, two days ago I saw the yellow dot near the storage controller.

I'm running into new computer users that are complaining about USB speeds then we test it and it is fine. It appears that the newer users are thinking something is wrong about the slow USB speeds. There isn't because USB is 10 or more times slower than your internal HDD. If your machine is writing to some USB flash stick, it's about 100 or more times slower. I see no reason to fix anything here. Bob
