1.1.1	Hi .	St
1.1.2	My ibook G4 has taken quite a beating this weeekend .	St
1.1.3	First , my friend spills beer into it , which is all sticky around the edges of the screen .	St
1.1.4	Second , my girlfriend places it too close to some candles , and now the back of the screen is partly melted .	St
1.1.5	Appearantly there is no harm done to the & quot ; cruzial parts & quot ; of the computer , since everything is working just as fine as before , and luckily there is no harm done to the screen ( thank god ) .	St
1.1.6	So it seems that & quot ; only & quot ; the outer parts have been damaged , which of course still is a big deal , since the computer has such a nice design .	St
1.1.7	Anyway , my question is , if anyone knows how to take off the white cover of the screen ( the one on top when the computer is closed , with the apple-light in ) ?	Ques
1.1.8	There are 2 screws in each side , which I have removed , but I can not seem to find out how to remove the cover anyway .	St
1.1.9	Also , does anyone know how to remove the buttons from the keyboard ?	Ques
1.1.10	Hope someone can help me..	St
1.1.11	Thanks !	St

1.2.1	Digging around with a screw driver in an attempt to remove the covers is likely to void your warranty , if it still has one .	St
1.2.2	You may find that it is necessary to remove the screen from the lower half before you can work on it .	St
1.2.3	Failing that , are there any little rubber cushion type things on the edges of the case lid .	St
1.2.4	If there are only two screws , I 'll have to check my manual , the two halves will be held together with interlocking pieces around the edge .	St
1.2.5	What buttons are you trying to remove from the keyboard ?	Ques
1.2.6	P	St
1.3.1	thanks for notifying me about the warranty .	Polite
1.3.2	It still has the warranty , as I just purchased it 2 months ago .	St
1.3.3	But how should I approach the problem then ?	Ques
1.3.4	I do n't want to void the warranty , but I would really like to get a new cover .	St
1.3.5	How should I remove the screen from the lower half first ?	Ques
1.3.6	It seems like the screen is connected to the ''thing '' that makes it possible to move the whole screen .	St
1.3.7	I ca n't really find any rubber cushions or any other kind of connecting points around the screen .	St
1.3.8	The spill was situated around the ''F1-F4 , 1-4 , Q-R '' -area .	St
1.3.9	I would like to remove the whole upper left corner of the keyboard .	St
1.4.1	Where are you planning on purchasing parts for this machine ?	Ques
1.4.2	I doubt Apple will sell you anything as you are not an Authorized Reseller/Service Centre .	St
1.4.3	I believe that the repair policy for this machine is for it to be returned to an Central Apple repair facility .	St
1.4.4	I do n't think they are repaired by anyone other than this center .	St
1.4.5	To remove the Display from the machine it is necessary to remove the following : Battery , Bottom case , Keyboard and RAM Shield , Airport Card , Top Case Top Shield .	St
1.4.6	Not all the screws are the same size ( length ) or Diameter .	St
1.4.7	There are at least 14 screws in the bottom case alone .	St
1.4.8	Splitting the case after all the screws have been removed requires a special nylon tool .	St
1.4.9	A strong thumb nail will work .	St
1.4.10	The warranty is now void !	St
1.4.11	Here is my advice , take it or leave it .	St
1.4.12	Speak nicely to your beer spilling friend and your pyro girlfriend and get them to stump up a portion of the bill that Apple will charge you to replace ALL the affected items .	St
1.4.13	I really do n't thing the warranty will cover this sort of damage but your House Insurance might .	St
1.4.14	Speak with Apple as soon as possible .	St
1.4.15	I strongly advise you NOT to attempt this repair yourself unless you are feeling really confident , can afford a new iBook AND have ALL the necessary parts at hand BEFORE you start .	St
1.4.16	P	St
1.5.1	I see your point .	St
1.5.2	It 's a lot of stuff to take apart , and a big risk to take .	St
1.5.3	In another forum , a guy posted this link : http : //www.pbfixit.com/Guide/84.19.0.html It seems possible , but of course it 's a lot of hard work , AND there is the warranty to think about .	St
1.5.4	Thanks for you advice , I 'll look into it..	St
1.6.1	that you have the parts before you start .	St
1.6.2	P	St
