<s> Ok I am trying to create a wired network between two computers in the same room. </s>
<s> Can I use the Dlink Des-1105 port switch to do this? </s>
<s> it has an input port and 4 other ports to plug ethernet cables into. </s>
<s> I tried doing this and only 1 of the computers was working. </s>
<s> You will need the right ethernet cables to get them electrically connected. </s>
<s> More importantly, you need to do some work at each PC to get them talking. </s>
<s> You'll need to deal with TCP/IP protocol which requires a unique address for each PC. </s>
<s> You'll need to configure a network name and names for the PCs. </s>
<s> You'll need to set up shares on each if you want to move files back and forth. </s>
<s> What have you done so far in this regard? </s>
<s> These switches are made to connect to a router that hands out DHCP TCP/IP addresses. </s>
<s> That being said, you could still use them as long as you manually set TCP/IP addresses on each computer manually that are on the same subnet. </s>
