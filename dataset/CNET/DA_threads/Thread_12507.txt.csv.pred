1.1.2	I can do it on my desktop but am not computer savy enough to know if a tablet is the same	St
1.2.1	Last week we had a member here who needed Flash to listen to his favorite stations.	St
1.2.2	And neither iPad's not (most) Android laptops support that.	St
1.2.3	And, of course, don't have a very good speakers.	St
1.2.4	So you should use either a headphone/earbuds or external speakers.	St
1.2.5	But for those external speakers the tablet should have a connection.	St
1.2.6	And, of course, it should have WiFi, so it can connect to your wireless router.	St
1.2.7	So you've got some nice selection criteria, when you visit a shop: - must have WiFi - must be able to use external speakers - must be able to play that specific radio channel Let the sales person show that it work, before you buy it!	St
1.2.8	Kees	St
