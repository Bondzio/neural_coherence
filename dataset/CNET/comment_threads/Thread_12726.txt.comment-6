I bought it to go into my desktop PC to automatically back up everything I do.
However the person who was going to fit it has a serious drink problem and after 5 months waiting it is still not installed.
I decided to use it as an external hard drive for backing up my data but I have no idea how to do this.
It has been suggested that I use a Belkin, but I think I need more information and help before I go and spend more money.
Any help you can give me will be very much appreciated.
Thanks.
Helen
