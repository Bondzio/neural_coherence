I took that one back upon the relese of the new generation MacBooks with a gig of RAM and i have been timid to try to upload usuing my firewire. if this doesnt work is there anyway i can get my macbook (not pro) to upload footage (programs, drivers???) any input would be a great help as i need to upload footage because im going into film school in the fall.

If already rewound, 10, Click Import. What's not working? I use a Sony HDR-HC1 hidef camcorder and do the above pretty regularly. I have also connected (and transferred video) from Panasonic and Canon miniDV tape based camcorders...

No special drivers required... If you are using FinalCut, I can walk you through that, too - but it is pretty easy - it is all in the set up...

On you DVX100 - what format were you shooting in? iMovie does not recognize all - you need FinalCut for the good stuff. http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=1332471&#1332471 http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=1507427&#1507427 The video I imported from the DVX100 to iMovie was 4:3 standard def...

The inability to import has NOTHING to do with the Apple Macintosh hardware you were - or are using. The issue is that iMovie is a free, consumer-grade, relatively low-end video editing application. If you were capturing in 24P or some other high-end, it was not designed to handle that. You need FinalCut... I don't know if Express will do - I've been using Pro (in the Studio bundle) for a bit, and it does pretty much everything. I suggest a quick read through of http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/ http://www.apple.com/finalcutstudio/finalcutpro/ Sorry for all the posts... hope they help, though...

The problem is not that iMovieHD is a &quot;Free&quot; program or that the Video is in the wrong format or even that Final Cut Express is required. The problem is that the poster has, is themselves! Quote &quot;i have been timid to try to upload usuing my firewire.&quot; Unquote This poster, apparently, has been trying to upload video from his camera by creating a method of his own. I thought USB but this camera does not have USB, that I can see, and the Macbook does not have S-Video input. The manual covers connecting with an IEEE1394 cable but the cable is an optional extra. I think a little more information is needed as to how the poster was attempting to upload video. Right now, I would say this problem is a PICNIC P

The Final Cut software is not recognizing the camera at all. Can you please walk me through what you did in setup?? I have the appropriate connectors, but am at a loss as to what else to do to use the editing software. Are any drivers needed? Any help appreciated!!

Connect the camera using the, NOT INCLUDED, IEEE1494 cable to the firewire port of your Mac. Note that the cable will have different ends on it, small for the camera end and a larger one for the Mac end. Did you purchase this cable? Assuming you have the correct cable, and it is connected, turn on the camera and set it to Play. If nothing happens on the Mac, launch iMovie. Yes, I know you have FC but this is just a test. iMovie should show that a camera is connected and allow you to suck down the video from your, very nice, camera. If all goes well and the camera is recognized, then you have a settings problem in FC. However, it iMovie does not recognize the camera, you may have a problem with the camera. Hope this helps. P
