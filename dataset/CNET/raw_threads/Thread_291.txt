It worked fine until he added this extra heat dissapating thing between the processor and heatsink. Now it just turns on with a blank screen and 3 beeps. He removed the heat dissapater and it still wouldnt boot, just the beeps. He figured it was a Video ram error, so he tried using several different video cards to no avail. The processor and everything else still works fine. So he gave the motherboard to me. I contacted Asus and they told me to 1. Cut the power supply for your PC and make your PC case open ; 2. Take out the Cmos battery 3. Install your battery with &quot;reverse side&quot; that means turn the battery 180 degree and put in into battery socket 4. Hold about 30 seconds then take out the battery and install it normally 5. Power on . Does this sound right? Any other suggestions? If its a video ram error, why wouldnt a new video card fix that?

Look how people get upset over defective hardware at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6127-0.html?forumID=9&threadID=4805&start=0 This board is showing up at too many places. I wouldn't bother with this model. Bob
