The problem is when I boot up my pc the screen starts to count up to 256MB then the screen becomes filled with coloured squares that are continuously flashing. The brand of memory I purchased was AZENRAM. Does anyone know the possible problem and how to solve it?

You should check with a company like Crucial (www.crucial.com) and put in the specifications of your system so you can get memory that is recommended. Not all systems that use 100Mhz ram work with 133Mhz, most will, but not all. Do try removing and reseating the memory as a final test before returning it.
