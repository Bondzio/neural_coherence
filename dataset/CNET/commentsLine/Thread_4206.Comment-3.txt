i did try multiple ports as i noted above.
2 on the front and 2 on the back.
not sure if it matters but ports have been used for other devices (cameras, sandisk sansa mp3 player, printers etc) without issue.
also, i did fail to mention i also have 2 separate cables.
i tried both of them.
i will say each of them were purchased through amazon.com and were like $5.00 each.
verizon also has what i think is the same cable but they want $19.99 for it.
i have used the cable and put the phone in mass stoage device mode and been able to transfer pictures back and forth, so i think it is an issue when the phone tries to go to sync mode for rhapsody versus the ports or cables my system info is as follows: mocrosoft windows xp media center edition version 2002 service pack 2 hp pavilion (i would have to look up the model #) amd 64 dual core proc 4200+ 1 gb ram running windows media player 10 (should i update to 11?
will that matter maybe?)
running windows explorer 7 (should i update to 8?
will that matter maybe?)
