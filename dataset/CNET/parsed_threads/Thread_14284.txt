<s> I recently got a new computer (moving up from ME to XP). </s>
<s> On the old computer I had some applications that loaded up fine. </s>
<s> Yet, on the XP computer I get an error banner that says, &quot;16 bit Windows Subsystem&quot; The body of the error window says, &quot;C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\AUTOEXEC.NT. </s>

<s> Choose 'Close' to terminate the application.&quot; At the bottom are two buttons - Close and Ignore (Nothing happens with ignore). </s>
<s> Both of these programs worked fine in the earlier version. </s>
<s> I tried the &quot;Compatibility&quot; function with no luck. </s>
<s> I tried loading it without the XP 2 patch, and again after. </s>
<s> These are simple apps that use a setup program. </s>
<s> I'm out of ideas...anybody else? </s>

<s> 16 bit Windows Subsystem error in XP? </s>
<s> I purchased a new computer last fall with XP installed. </s>
<s> All applications that came pre-loaded and the once I loaded worked fine until 3 days ago. </s>
<s> Then, out of the blue I get an error banner that says, &quot;16 bit Windows Subsystem&quot; The body of the error window says, &quot;C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\AUTOEXEC.NT. </s>
<s> The system file is not suitable for running MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows applications. </s>
<s> Choose 'Close' to terminate the application.&quot; At the bottom are two buttons - Close and Ignore (Nothing happens with ignore). </s>
<s> I tried the &quot;Compatibility&quot; function with no luck. </s>
<s> I must have changed something, which I do from time ti time, that may have something to do with it but suddenly it will refuse to recognize older programs. </s>
<s> The once in question, I believe, are the 16 bit based once and I have a few of those. </s>
<s> Could anyone help me with this please, it is very vital for me because I use some of the old graphic programs, card games, etc, etc. </s>
<s> Any help will be much apreciated. </s>
