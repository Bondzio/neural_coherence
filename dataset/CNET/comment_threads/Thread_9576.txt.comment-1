My printer, HP LaserJet 4, recently just stopped working.
My computer is using XP.
I have been through the trouble shooter and did everything it told me to do, but it is still not working.
It will print a test page, so there is nothing wrong with the printer.
I would uninstall and reinstall it, but can't find where to do that.
The printers don't come up in the add/remove hardware.
Also when I click on &quot;Find Printers&quot; I get an error message (Directory Service is unavailable) I am not savvy enough to know what printer drivers to delete manually.
Sigh....
I NEED my printer desperately.
