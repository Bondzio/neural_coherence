<s> I have a grid 19dbi outside antenna with 400 cable with a rp-tnc to male connector on the end of the cable. </s>
<s> I have wifi here but it is weak. </s>
<s> I have a linksys WRT54GS router. </s>
<s> How can I connect my outside antenna cable to the internet plug of my router? </s>
<s> Then I think I can get a stronger signal. </s>

<s> That's weak. </s>
<s> no not 400ft 400 cable thats 20ft good god man whats wrong with you </s>
<s> Your post is unclear and poorly written. </s>
<s> However a 20 foot cable is also unacceptable. </s>
<s> You'll want to get that down to just a few feet. </s>
<s> I do not offer to teach RF tech here but that's far too long and will create very odd issues. </s>
