Don't let Windows look for the better drivers.
Force Windows to look specifically where they are....be it on a disk or extracted to a folder on the HD.
Again, I would try removing and letting Windows redetect the USB components.
I have done this successfully with MB USB devices but not add in cards.
It might be worth a try.
