ok... one more... i found this dell psu: silencer 470w that has a 24pin connector like my dell dimension 9100 has... but it doesn't have the dimension 9100 listed... just reading the discription and specs... this seems more likely to work than a 20pin atx power supply.... anyone have any suggestions?
