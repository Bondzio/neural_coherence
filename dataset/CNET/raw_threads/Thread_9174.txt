When I had foremat and XP installed by the same store, he neglected to downlad the driver for this new port. I wasn't using the port so just disabled it. I recently found the ITE driver and downloaded and installed it. In device manager it shows under ports as PCI Parallel Port on LPT3 which is correct. However it also created a new folded in device manager called, Multi-port serial adaptors and shows as a PCI multi-I/O controller. Why is it in two places and shows differently?

Understanding the &quot;engneering&quot; side gets too detailed and/or the nuts/bolts that many really don't want to know other than what I stated. Here's a link to explain some of it: http://www.howstuffworks.com/category.htm?cat=Comp Understand that alot of h/w that's part of the mtrbd. or basic &quot;sold as is&quot; system will be defaulted, thus any added h/w usually needs more attention in order for it to work. The system keeps track of it and &quot;allows&quot; a certain range of available IRQs to represent those items. tada -----Willy

However, even though I was told when I bought it that it worked with XP It doesn't say that on the box. So it is probably the camera and not the port.

But it would never work on a PCI parallel card unless I changed the PCI Parallel Card to use &quot;classic&quot; addresses and IRQ. From memory the LAVA card offered such. Read http://www.lavalink.com/index.php?id=474 Can I comment that lack of details hinder you getting the best help? Bob

Most cameras default to LPT2 or under XP &quot;autofind&quot; what's available, but that's not a given. If possible check the user setting under the camera s/w to determine what it is. Since, this is LPT usage, suggests its an old camera and you maybe limited. If all you have for camera ports to use is LPT1 or 2, then see if the pci card or added LPTs are themselves settable. LPT1 is already taken by the system, BTW. If you're using the LPT1 the std. defaulted port for a printer, just disconnect the printer. Reboot and then try using the camera and see if its trying to use LPT1, then do the above to correct it for other LPT? port. You can even disable LPT via the bios to deal only with the added pci card and see where that takes you, of course testing or connecting as required. On top of all that make sure the LPT port is set to STD or plain LPT, not EPP or EPS(I think). Just another area to check. This is about all I can suggest for now. tada -----Willy

8131	10	133687	1508531	1508416	R. Proffitt	11/1/05 4:36 AM	1.13081976E12	May I add.	The make and model numbers would help too. I really do want to see you succeed. But you have to tell more than what you have. Some think the forum members will ask for detail by detail, but this is not tech support so you must make it as easy and be nice as possible. Cheers, Bob
