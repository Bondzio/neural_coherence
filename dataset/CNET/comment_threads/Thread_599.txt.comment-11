I read a lot of the storage forum discussions and some of the other sites you mentioned for backup information and came to the conclusion that I'd use Norton Ghost to backup to a notebook that I plan on buying once I'm done with the pc configuration etc.
It seems that I'll be able to backup the pc to the notebook and the notebook to the pc using a wireless network that I intend on figuring out.
However, it seems that I wouldn't need to buy Norton Ghost if I had the Windows Vista instead, as the review I read for Vista says that it will have a super backup program.
Do you know if Vista is coming out soon or are new operating systems easy and relatively cheap to upgrade to if you already have a windows operating system installed?
