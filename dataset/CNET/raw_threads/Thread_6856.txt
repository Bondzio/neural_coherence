Nobody else does around here so I get constant nagging from neighbours to give them the password. I can't say no however I'm afraid they may use up too much of my bandwith connection which could lead to alot of money being lost from my part. Constant and stable internet is a must for my work. Hence my question - how can I limit the bandwith I give to them? Can I create a second public network with limited bandwith or something like that? Thanks in advance!

Given you'd have to replace the router or create one from a Linux box, it's just not worth it to most folk and again it's back to just say no and then change the router to channel 14 (I will deny I wrote this) and then set your wifi to Europe settings and they won't even see the wifi router to ask you.

They know I have a wifi internet connection as I sit on the porch and do work. Saying no is also pretty much impossible as they have helped me out quite a few times. &lt;div&gt; So in order to limit the bandwith I allocate to them I have to get a new router? No other easier way? &lt;/div&gt;

This is not a common feature in routers but folk have put such into Linux based routers but it seems expensive to run 100 or 200 or more Watt computer to do this. http://reviews.cnet.com/routers/?filter=500563_5554972_ is a page about these units. Traffic Shaping is the other common term used. Read http://ask.metafilter.com/21629/Traffic-shaping-with-a-cheap-consumer-router On Linux?
