thanks for the reply.
however, according to turtle beach and asus (also auzentech x-meridian $200 and razor ac1 $200), this is not true.
at the bottom of each of these pages:   they state, &quot;virtual surround sound technology converts stereo sound sources to multi-channel format&quot;.
obviously this card can encode stereo to 5.1. how it does this (dolby?)
is not stated.
if you look at the asus xonar:  googlebase&cm_mmc_o=tbbtkwcjcvybpagf%20mwzygtcjcvrqcjcvrq, it states &quot;dolby pro-logic iix converts stereo or 5.1 sounds to seamless 7.1 surround soundfield&quot;.
obviously this card also converts stereo to surround (7.1 in this case).
since it is obviously not practical to copy a music cd to my computer (or any of the 14,000 mp3 songs my son has) then convert each file to surround before playing it (not to mention the amount of hd space required) i want a software or hardware (sound card) that will convert &quot;on the fly&quot;.
anyone know if the turtle beach cards actually do this conversion decently, as they state, or know of a sound card (less than $50 hopefully) that will do the conversion?
anyone know of a sound card that will convert stereo to dts?
thanks, sportyinc
