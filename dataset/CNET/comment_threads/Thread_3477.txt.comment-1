Hello ALL, I could really use a computer, but I don't know if I should wait until X-mas sales.
I would really like an HP high performance computer.
Should I wait for prices to tumble so I could get a quad core, or should I just get a dual core, probably AMD now?
I'll probably try and get 3gb ram, 500gb hdd, tv tuner, wireless, maybe a 19&quot; widescreen.
I want to render images, use CAD, and do other engineering related items.
ANY THOUGHTS??
