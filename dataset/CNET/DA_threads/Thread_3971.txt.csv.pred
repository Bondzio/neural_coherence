1.1.1	I'm still trying to figure out why my computer crashes.	St
1.1.2	Sometimes when it freezes it starts beeping a constant beep until I finally have to turn it off or reset it.	St
1.1.3	What could this mean?	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	Some BIOS will emit a beep-beep or siren when the CPU or other sensor is too hot.	St
1.3.2	Why is your post so slim on details?	St
1.3.3	Did you try it with the cover off?	St
1.3.4	Bob	St
1.4.1	Yeah right now I'm running it with the cover off.	St
1.4.2	If I put the cover back on the case will vibrate and the fan will make a loud buzzing noise.	St
1.4.3	My computer basically crashes out of nowhere unpredictably, even while idle.	St
1.4.4	I've checked the system health in bios and the cpu temp is only around 47-49C.	St
1.4.5	I'm still trying to figure out why my computer crashes and which piece of hardare is causing this.	St
1.4.6	Also, its been crashing on my old system too which is why I replaced the CPU, motheboard and memory, and it still does it.	St
1.4.7	The only thing I havent replaced for a long time is my hard drive, but I ran the manufacturers utility did burn in tests and such and it says the hard drive is error free.	St
1.4.8	Also, crashing either gives a blue screen just saying &quot;the system has halted, contact your hardware vendor&quot; or it just plain freezes while im doing something and I try to click on a window and it gets stuck and I have to reset, other times it beeps a constant beep when it freezes, so I'm thinking that might mean something...
