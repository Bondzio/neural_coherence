<s> Are HP desktops as good as or better than Dell? </s>

<s> My wife has an HP Media Center that we've been happy with... That being said, Dell seems to have (mass market) corporate and high-end machines that do well... </s>
<s> But I would still build my own. </s>
<s> For word processing; web surfing; email and some Quicken. </s>
<s> Which model HP desktop do you own? </s>
<s> I configured a desktop at HP Shopping.com and by the time I finished configuring a desktop it ended up costing more than a Dell e510 desktop PC. </s>

<s> The m7330n, which is going to be more than you need, it sounds like - Pretty much any modern computer will take care of what you're looking to do. </s>
<s> With that in mind, I would weigh the customer service a little more heavily, rather than pick over the feature/hardware differences between comparable models. </s>
<s> Whatever you end up with, either A) it'll work and you'll be happy, or B) something will go wrong and you'll be on the phone with support. </s>
<s> For what it worth, online HP support has been good. </s>
<s> You can chat online and they'll email you a transcript of the conversation in case you should forget anything that was mentioned. </s>
<s> Having bought many computers I decided to give a HP Pavillion a try and have been very disappointed with it. </s>
<s> From the very begining I was misled not being informed that the Pavillion a1310n I bought came with no Operating System Cd's and they will not provide them. </s>
<s> I have software that HP preinstalls with the operating system that can not be totaly removed. </s>
<s> I have gone through the add/remove programs to uninstall the garbage but some such as Norton keep coming back with popups telling me to update. </s>
<s> I have pleaded with HP reps. for a OS Cd so I can have a clean install to no avail. </s>
<s> I have since bought a Dell and will recomend people don't buy a HP for the reasons stated. </s>
<s> They do not have the policy that the customer is always right and even agree that my complaints are valid but will not rectify the problem. </s>
<s> I will tell everyone looking to buy to pass on HP </s>
<s> I am getting the runaround from HP on obtaining the Vista upgrade they promised me. </s>
<s> Instead of automatically sending you the upgrade when ready, they force you to prove yourself to a 3rd party order fulfillment house which is inept and incompetent. </s>
<s> I wouldn't trust them now with the purchase of an ink cartridge! </s>
<s> Once you get your PC home you'll have to deal with support from a call center in India, which is staffed by idiots reading from a script. </s>
<s> DO NOT BUY an HP unless you are a raving masochist!!!!!!!!!!!! </s>
<s> !1 </s>
<s> I'm having same problems as bobborn with Dell. </s>
<s> Well having said that who would you now buy a new PC from if not from Dell or HP? </s>
<s> My last desktop was a Dell and I just bought an HP at a good price. </s>
<s> Truthfully, I've heard horror stories about both companies' tech support, but I've never had a major problem with either. </s>
<s> We have a corporate discount with Dell at work, so I know lots of people who have Dells. </s>
<s> Think when you get a decent one you're OK, but it's hard to get help on a problem of any significance. </s>
<s> BTW, my Dell machine worked fine but at after a few years needed upgrades that would've knocked a big hole in the cost of a new one. </s>
<s> The few times I've called tech support for Dell or HP, it really wasn't about a major issue. </s>
<s> I didn't find them real helpful, but was able to get help elsewhere. </s>
<s> a custom built machine at a local store. </s>
<s> It seems easier when I need serious help for defective hardware. </s>
<s> I trust I can solve software problems myself, so I don't need a helpdesk for that. </s>

<s> Have you recently purchased any of Dell's new desktops with the AMD processors? </s>
<s> If you have any feedback on them would be appreciated. </s>
<s> No, my Dell had an Intel chip. </s>
<s> Prior to Hurricane Katrina there was one computer custom builder sales and repair shop in my town; Katrina destroyed his business; he moved and now there is not one custom computer shop anywhere along my Mississippi gulf coastline although Office Depot; Office Max, Circuit City are now back and a Best Buy has come into the area since the hurricane. </s>
<s> Wal-Mart is now also back. </s>
<s> Is your Dell one of the new Dell Dimension 521 desktop models or is it an older Dell Dimension desktop model? </s>
<s> You mentioned you received a business discount when you purchased your new computer. </s>
<s> Is it one of Dell's Small Business systems units? </s>
<s> The models are basically the same as Dell's Home Office units; just the model numbers are different. </s>
<s> I don't have my Dell anymore. </s>
<s> As I said, I liked it, but I've heard lots of horror stories from folks who had problems. </s>
