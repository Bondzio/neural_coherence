hey madtownidiot, i'm planning to build a new system with the qx6800 processor.
now, i've been looking everywhere to try and find this processor, but no luck.
i read somewhere that intel only sells it to oem companies like dell, alienware, etc, but not to hardware retailers like newegg, tigerdirect, etc.
so my big question is: where did you buy your qx6800 from ?
i really really wanna know.
thanks a million.
