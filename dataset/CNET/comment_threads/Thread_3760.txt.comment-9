But please allow me to follow along with ajtrek's recs, etc., and then I'll get back to your suggestions.
I'm afeared that if I try to make changes from both of you at the same time, we risk getting messed up even more than I am right now.
So, thank you very much, and I'll soon be answering your message.
Talk at you soon, john
