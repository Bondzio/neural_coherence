<s> Will a Belkin N1 and a Belkin G+ MIMO USB adapter work properly together? </s>
<s> Like all other wireless thats out there in the market...these are 'interchangable', and will connect to eachother...but only as fast as the slowest component. </s>
<s> Just like if you have a B wireless WAP with a G network card...you would only go as fast as the B network would go. </s>
<s> If you get a Super G wireless card, in a regular G enviorment, you can only get up to 54 Mbs. </s>
<s> Same thing with your MiMo and Pre-N. You can get them connected, but you would get the performance of the MiMo, and not the Pre-N. </s>
<s> So, to make this answer simple.....YES. </s>
<s> You can get the connected. </s>
<s> Hope that answers your question and good luck. </s>
