...make sure you get a model with a core 2 duo if you can at all justify it.
it's a lot faster, and the earlier cpus usually can't handle 64-bit code should you choose to migrate to vista 64-bit (or its sequel in 2009-2010).
the 531s is similar in other regards, but the athlon 64 x2 just isn't as fast.
also, if you're looking at going slimline, don't rule out a mac mini unless you need windows-specific programs or you can't justify getting their mac equivalents (for most people, this just means a cheap copy of office student & teacher edition at $150).
it's much smaller than the inspiron or even the hp box and more power-efficient, too.
arguably, you're going to have an easier time with the full-size inspiron 530 if you're just looking for an inexpensive tower.
