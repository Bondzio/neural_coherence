<s> I have a creative labs surround sound system on my computer but it is useless because my son decided to show mom how to do this and that. </s>
<s> Well, now this and that can't remember how to fix it and I only have the two front speakers working can someone help. </s>
<s> PLEASE! </s>
<s> I would be greatful if I could get this fixed and be able to enjoy the expense of surround sound that I paid for. </s>
<s> I do not know how to figure out where to go to see if the computer even knows what speaker system is even installed or if it believes it is the regular set that came with the computer. </s>
<s> I have a AMD Athlon64, WinXP SP2, with NVIDIDA nForce Audio Codec Interface. </s>
<s> Just in case you need that info. </s>
<s> Thanks to anyone in advance. </s>
<s> Shar </s>
<s> I once was, and maybe still am, rather naive. </s>
<s> I thought I knew alot about computers and tried to show my family all I knew by opening the case and telling them what everything was. </s>
<s> What a geek! </s>
<s> Anyways, when I booted it up, my sound was gone! </s>
<s> To make a long story short, I had bent the PCI bus connector of the Sound card, now I'm on integrated sound. </s>
<s> Well, first off: All the correct cables are connected? </s>
<s> If the cables have not been touched, don't move them. </s>
<s> If they have been, make sure they are all in correctly: Surround Right in Surround Right, etc. </s>
<s> If not try this: Assuming you are running Windows XP Pro, under classic mode Start Settings Control Panel Sound & Audio Devices (or maybe just Sound) Grey box should pop up Go to the volume tab, the first one. </s>
<s> At the bottom click Advanced. </s>
<s> Choose what speaker system most resembles yours, or try some of the multi-speaker settings and try your surround sound capable program. </s>
<s> Again, check cables if that doesn't work. </s>
<s> hth ~Ibrahim~ </s>
<s> I had to go to the advanced button in the Master Volume and reassign the plug-in on the back of my computer where the microphone goes, so that my sub was plugged in. </s>
<s> Thank you for your help. </s>
<s> I would have never thought to go to that advanced button without your tip. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
