I experienced the same lackluster speed on my HP d4999t running Windows 7 64 bit until I installed Intel's Matrix Storage Manager.
Notice how much I revealed in one sentence?
And I will not find out what Intel is calling that software today because I can't look it up everytime this comes up.
Please do a little work when needed.
--&gt; I can't know if this applies but hope it does.
Just a tip.
Try to post all the details so folk have what they need to give you the best chance of success.
