is there a web site you would recommend to help navigate through the process of understanding what upgrades are possible given a current motherboard?
I am in a similar situation to the earlier writers in this thread, want to upgrade a P4 3.0 GHz with HT, 925X mobo in a Dell Dimension 8400 and don't quite know where to start.
