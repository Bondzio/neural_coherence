1.1.1	I have a Maxtor drive that I use to store embroidery designs that I use on a regular basis .	St
1.1.2	I have more than 100,000 designs on this drive .	St
1.1.3	I have a Dell inspiron-E1505 laptop that is about 8 years old .	St
1.1.4	I am running XP Pro Vers 2002 - Service Pack 3 - It has an Intel CPU T2400 @ 1.63GHz - 1.83Ghz @ .00 GB RAM Every once in a while if my machine turned itself off with the hard drive attached when I got back on it would say that it could not finish writing to the device - the E drive $ MFT file .	St
1.1.5	I would click on the drive and it would bring up the maxtor window asking for my password and it would unlock the drive .	St
1.1.6	Today it showed a different file quickly and then it closed another message popped up with the MFT file name .	St
1.1.7	When I tried to open the drive it said , there was an I/O error .	St
1.1.8	I tried logging off and then doing a shutdown but nothing has helped .	St
1.1.9	When I went into device manager it said that the drive was a CD drive instead of an external drive storage .	St
1.1.10	I tried to use the trouble shooting help system at the Seagate site but you ca n't do much if it thinks it is a CD Drive .	St
1.1.11	Any help is really appreciated .	Polite
1.1.12	Thx , jane	St
1.2.1	External drives do tend to corrupt like that .	St
1.2.2	I 've had to boot up and chkdsk the drive or try a chkdsk on boot ( not going to duplicate chkdsk discussions at this point .	St
1.2.3	If you have n't learned why USB drives are not reliable yet I 'd be a little surprised .	St
1.2.4	It 's time to get that drive internal so you do n't have this issue .	St
