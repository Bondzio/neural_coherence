are you using an internal video card?
If not, you're then likely using some on-board video port whcih is using system ram for its own use.
Doing the math, the missing ram is 64mb(+448mb), the amount loss from 512mb.
That's good reason your gaming is poor as on-board video isn't as capable as add-on video cards.
As for ram install, check the specs for what can be installed and way its installed via the support website or manual.
I wouldn't leave out SP2, its worth the install besides security issues it does alot of 3rd party drivers, etc.
Your best bet is to do a complete format and re-install of OS, doing all updates to include SP2.
Expect a long install process anything else but that may cause SP2 to puke, its a hassle I know.
good luck -----Willy
