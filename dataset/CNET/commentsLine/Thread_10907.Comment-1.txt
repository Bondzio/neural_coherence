any suggestions to any brands or models of either routers or switches that can be used for a personal internal fiber network.
i wanted to replace my nic's with the fiber so i can get internal bandwith up to 2gbps for high speed data transfers, remote access with no delay and internal gaming but having problems trying to fine suitable home switches or routers that have these kind of connections.
the only kind i see is used to uplink a switch to another switch that's a good distance between the points.
i need at least 2 or 3 fiber ports so i can transmit data at high speeds between 2 computers and still utilize a cat5/6 network for gaming consoles such as a ps2/ps3 when it comes out, my 360, etc along with an older computer on the 100mps portion.
any suggestions or help would be greatly appreciated.
in case if you wanted system specs, the 2 primary machines utilizing these speeds are both amd fx-60 machines with 4gb ddr in both running xp pro and 2 fiber optic network adapters on it's way through shipping for preparation of thise high speed internal network of mine.
