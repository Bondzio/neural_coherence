<s> I recently acquired an HP Omnibook 6100 with a cd-rw dvd rom. </s>
<s> It had no operating system due to a hard drive replacement, so I installed a legal copy of Windows 98 SE. </s>
<s> I've done all the upgrades thru MS and the unit works fine, except that it won't play a DVD. </s>
<s> I know the unit works because it plays CD's and writes to CD's just fine. </s>
<s> It appears the drive is a Toshiba. </s>
<s> Help. </s>
<s> You get to install software such as WinDVD, PowerDVD or other. </s>
<s> It's not free and confuses some that DVD playback is not a feature in this OS. </s>

<s> Here are some free VCD and DVD Players that you can download. </s>
<s> The first one with the DIVX Codecs (which are also free) comes with a player that you can install and it's probably one of the best I've seen to be honest. </s>
<s> www.pcwarfare.com/cd-cdrw-dvd/free.video.players.htm You have to copy and paste the above into the addressbar because the CNET filters wipes out the URL if I put the http:// in front of it to make it clickable. </s>
<s> Sorry..... TONI </s>
<s> What I've found is the free (windows) DVD players only play &quot;unprotected&quot; DVD content. </s>
<s> Or rather will not play most DVDs you rent or buy. </s>
<s> If you need to test a DVD installation and have no Windows DVD player, look up GEEXBOX since it's not windows and is some 7 megabytes or less. </s>

<s> Actualy no version of Windows comes with a DVD player!! </s>
<s> Even with XP MCE2005 you must install a 3rd party DVD player for it to work. </s>

<s> &quot;How to install the DVD player (for Windows 98) Windows 98 has an internal DVD player, but it isn't installed during Windows setup. </s>
<s> You must extract &quot;manually&quot; DVD player files from cab sources. </s>
<s> Those files are dvdplay.chm, dvdplay.cnt, dvdplay.hlp, dvdplay.exe and dvdrgn.exe. </s>
<s> Put them into a folder of your choice, and them move dvdrgn.exe into Windows folder. </s>
<s> Run dvdplay.exe to start the player. </s>
<s> &quot; - Noted widely on the web. </s>
<s> But this player is incapable of playing 99% of commercial DVDs. </s>
<s> I've found this tip to be useful for playback in a pinch for homemade DVDs. </s>
