I have 2.8 GHZ computer using windows XP with a 80GB hard drive partioned into 15gb and 65gb.
My hard drive &quot;C&quot;(15 GB drive) is full and I have multiple error messages.
What would be the best way to restore the computer to it's original state(like out the box).
Would you recommend a system restore or would you recommend reformatting and reloading the disc.
Can you give me detailed instructions on reformatting and reloading the OS.
Thanks for your help.
