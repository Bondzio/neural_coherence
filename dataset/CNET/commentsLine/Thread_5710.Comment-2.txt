monitors got their power from the pc's power supply.
that's why old pc's had that weird plug.
but the amount of power drawn by a sleeping lcd monitor is trivial... most are less than 1 watt.
someone microwaving popcorn will offset the 'savings'.
likewise, lcds give off practically no heat when asleep.
and that excess heat from your pc can actually reduce your heating bills in the winter.
