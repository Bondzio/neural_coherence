Good show, well done.
I wish I has access to such if anything to be 100% sure it was what I thought.
Usually, I dump these systems when it fails to respond to typical fixes and I know better to even try an &quot;old soldering job, etc.&quot; because as I stated before the reward is hardly worth it when I know another is in the tubes, sorta speak.
good luck -----Willy
