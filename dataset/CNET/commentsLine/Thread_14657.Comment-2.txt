i have the same monitor.
it's a reasonable monitor, excellent for price.
i did wish it had some more options with regard to turning the monitor up and down and around, but its been fine.
i never recieved my rebate either, which is highly dissapointing, maybe this is an issue others are having?
the monitor only have with one dead pixel, which as i understand it, is much less than the industry average.
i'm happy with it.
if you want more reviews, go to newegg.com, its been reveiwed hundred's of times.
