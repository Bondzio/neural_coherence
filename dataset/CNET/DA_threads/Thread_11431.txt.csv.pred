1.1.1	My HP a6720y locked up while playing TrackMania .	St
1.1.2	The windows key and Ctrl Alt Del had no effect so after about 2 hours I pressed the start button until it turned off .	St
1.1.3	Now it wont start .	St
1.1.4	The power light comes on , the fans start and then stop after a second or two and then tries to reboot .	St
1.1.5	I get no beep codes , no display .	St
1.1.6	The green light on the PSU is on but blinks when the computer tries to start .	St
1.1.7	The Geek Squad guy said most likely MOBO failure and would be cheaper to replace the computer .	St
1.1.8	Do you think PSU or MOBO ?	Ques
1.1.9	I have unplugged everything in the case to find a bad component and nothing changed .	St
1.1.10	It does n't start or run at all before shutting down to reboot .	St
1.2.1	As you know , that 's not enough to diagnose the machine .	St
1.2.2	http : //h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp ? lang=en & cc=us & taskId=120 & prodSeriesId=3823602 & prodTypeId=12454 & objectID=c01643511 shows this is only a few years old but the failure to start up could be anything .	St
1.2.3	Why do you suspect the PSU ?	Ques
1.2.4	It was n't clear .	St
1.2.5	Some folk forget to share & quot ; I installed a powerful video card and may have stressed the PSU & quot ; .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	PSU GREEN WIRE TEST	St
1.4.1	Well , I do n't know what to suspect .	St
1.4.2	Others have said check the psu first .	St
1.4.3	I would think that if the power supply failed it machine would have turned off , not freeze .	St
1.4.4	After I unplugged the video card , HD , CD drive , all but one stick of RAM without any change in it I think only the PSU and motherboard are left .	St
1.4.5	I have n't added new hardware or programs recently .	St
1.4.6	The only other issue I had is the the latest Windows Update would n't install .	St
1.4.7	The green power light on the power supply blinks when the computer tries to start .	St
1.4.8	That would be why I suspected maybe the psu maybe .	St
1.5.1	This could be as simple as a broken power button .	St
1.5.2	Do you have an Ohm meter to check that the button ( it 's a momentary on switch ) is still good ?	Ques
1.5.3	Are you into electronics enough to try it without the switch ?	Ques
1.5.4	Bob	St
1.6.1	The green wire test is ok .	St
1.6.2	The fan turned on .	St
1.6.3	I am not that into electronics to try it without a switch .	St
1.6.4	Would n't a bad switch make it not power up at all ?	Ques
1.6.5	How would a bad power switch make the system freeze up ?	Ques
1.6.6	At first I thought the hard shutdown by holding the button caused the issue but now I think the freezeup was a failure and I did n't cause anymore damage than what was there already .	St
1.7.1	Were the values OK or not ?	Ques
1.7.2	I have to ask .	St
1.7.3	About the push button .	St
1.7.4	We can do without that on most computers to know it 's not that .	St
1.7.5	It 's unlikely but I remove it and test it on its own as it could be defective .	St
1.7.6	Let me be clear .	St
1.7.7	It would take a chapter in a book to cover all the oddities about switches like that one .	St
1.7.8	I ca n't write that here and even if I did , most folk wo n't have the Ohm meter .	St
1.7.9	That piece of test gear is about 10 or so bucks and is required if we are to diagnose things without swapping .	St
1.7.10	Once we know the Volts are fine we have to consider they are right and it 's a motherboard failure .	St
1.7.11	BUT since a low CMOS battery can block booting on some but not all machines , measure that too .	St
1.7.12	Bob	St
1.8.1	The green wire test I googled didnt include voltage readings .	St
1.8.2	I have an old ohm meter that I am not proficient at using .	St
1.8.3	What I said was a fan the first time was actually the hard drive spinning .	St
1.8.4	The case fan and Cpu fans do not start with the jumper applied to the wires .	St
1.9.1	And since the Voltage is not checked , then you are left with choices to make .	St
1.9.2	I ca n't make them for you .	St
1.9.3	It 's a voltage reading , not considered advanced when it comes to PC repair .	St
1.9.4	Here 's a google result on using a Volt Meter .	St
1.9.5	http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=bF3OyQ3HwfU Bob	Ques
