<s> Good day folks, OK, I am working on a PC that delays in powering up. </s>
<s> The system is a Gigabyte GA-8IK1100 & P4 running on XP Pro. </s>
<s> There is a G force 5900 Video card that is failing. </s>
<s> The fans do not function and the temperature gets overheated. </s>
<s> My multimeter also measured the voltage a little above 5 and 12 volts. </s>
<s> The card takes 12 volts and a power error message also displays during the OS boot up. </s>
<s> I advised the client to buy a power supply of 480 W. I installed it and other areas of performance improved. </s>
<s> I eliminated the main components as the problems. </s>
<s> I also changed the battery for CMOS. </s>
<s> I took out the video card and put in mine and it worked instantly, but the problem still persisted after a couple of boot ups. </s>
<s> That problem? </s>
<s> A delay in booting up. </s>
<s> The case wires work, but it could be a short in electricity from the front case to the motherboard. </s>
<s> I cannot get into that part of the case itself. </s>
<s> OK, your turn folks....... </s>
<s> do you mean that it takes too long for the POST to complete or does this part function ok but Windows isn't starting? </s>
<s> If it's Windows, the number of variables grows significantly. </s>
<s> Where exactly does it hang. </s>
<s> &quot;do you mean that it takes too long for the POST to complete or does this part function ok but Windows isn't starting? </s>
<s> If it's Windows, the number of variables grows significantly. </s>
<s> Where exactly does it hang.&quot; No. </s>
<s> The PS aspect is the issue or if a hardware component is causing the power to delay in booting. </s>
<s> POST was a good guess. </s>
<s> You asked what could be causing the power to delay in booting. </s>
<s> The total boot process I am referring to is from the time power is applied until the OS is ready to use. </s>
<s> The system could hang during the POST or afterwards while loading Windows. </s>
<s> Is it during one of these processes? </s>
<s> What I am reading is that you might be turning the PC on but but seeing a delay in when power is actually applied. </s>
<s> This can only be determined by monitoring the PS voltages as they sequence up. </s>
<s> Once present, the POST should begin. </s>
<s> If you use a CRT monitor, you may not see evidence of such but maybe hear a beep from the speaker. </s>
<s> During the POST, hardware detection is made and compared against what's been stored in the setup. </s>
<s> Discrepancies can cause delays. </s>
<s> Other delays can be due to waiting for hard drives to spin up...especially if the system is set to automatically configure the drives at each restart. </s>
<s> Memory testing takes time. </s>
<s> A change in the battery might set the MB to defaults. </s>
<s> One of these defaults might be to do the longer memory check. </s>
<s> Sorry if I'm misunderstanding your question but still getting no vision of the sequence of events you are witnessing. </s>
<s> Unplug USB things. </s>
<s> Hi again, thanks for the input. </s>
<s> I understand the POST and what is being checked. </s>
<s> The delay I refer is when the power button is pushed in about 5-6 times before actual power. </s>
<s> I have to push the power button for 5-6 times before it comes on after I take away the cord. </s>
<s> Once the power is on, it reboots in the normal time. </s>
<s> I tried to determine if the video card (which can make a system not function properly) is the cause by changing video cards. </s>
<s> I saw a difference but it still took 5-6 times of pushing in the power button before the system could began the POST. </s>
<s> Once the system loads the POST is fine. </s>
<s> I have tried to adjust the BIOS RAM and temperature to see. </s>
<s> Try pressing and holding the button for a short if you're just giving it a quick push. </s>
<s> There are BIOS options as to how to respond to that button. </s>
<s> Check them. </s>
<s> That's a momentary switch that's just supposed to latch the power supply. </s>
<s> They do go bad. </s>
<s> you can probably find the MB connector for that switch and test it from there. </s>
<s> It will be one of the front panel connections usually all grouped together. </s>
