<s> Hello, I recently bought a 1tb Western Digital MyBook Home Edition external HDD, which supports connecting via USB, Firewire and eSATA. </s>
<s> I've connected it to my computer via USB, and it worked flawlessly. </s>
<s> However, when I try connecting it via Firewire, I generally get the connected hardware sound, then nothing happens for a while, and then it might eventually turn up in my computer as &quot;Local Disk: H&quot; or something, but when I try opening it, I get an I/O error. </s>
<s> When I open up device manager, it's under disk drives as: &quot;WD My Book IEEE 1394 SBP2 Device&quot;, with a yellow exclamation mark next to it. </s>
<s> In properties it says something like &quot;This device is unable to start&quot; or something similar, and the location is &quot;LUN 0&quot;. </s>
<s> I'd really appreciate it if you could help me get it working with Firewire, as the only reason I bought it was for the Firewire connection. </s>
<s> Try that connection on an Apple or a machine that runs Linux. </s>
<s> Do not expect WD to help you fix your PC or Windows. </s>

<s> Actually even if you get it running on FW you will not notice a really appreciable speed increase(loading etc) over USB 2.0. </s>
<s> Where firewire connectivity comes into play and is a necessity, is with camcorder input. </s>
<s> Bob is right with Windows being iffy with FW. </s>
<s> Mac on the other hand seems to book right along. </s>
<s> Hi....what happens if you unplug the Firewire cable (are you using 1394a or 1394b) for about 5 seconds and then plug it back in. </s>
<s> Another attempt would be to try Updating the driver from Device Manager...just right click on the listing with the Yellow bang and select Update Driver. </s>
<s> Let us know what happens. </s>
<s> I've already tried, and it's not the HDD or Firewire PCI driver, they're up to date. </s>
<s> I do have an old G3 iMac running Panther, so I'll try it on that </s>
<s> Well, I plugged it into my old G3 iMac and it connected within a few seconds. </s>
<s> So obviously the problem is with Windows, any suggestions? </s>
<s> Nothing good that I can share. </s>
<s> We know there are issues with Windows. </s>
<s> Why would we attempt to fix this? </s>
<s> Microsoft has the code, we don't so we can't fix it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
