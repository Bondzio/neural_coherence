I don't like buying cases with the Power Supply because the supply is usually a low bid item.
I know that Enermax makes power supplies, BUT they make cheapies and good ones.
The good ones have the &quot;true Power&quot; in their name, meaning that they actually provide the full rating 100% of the time.
For the cheapies the ratings are for the peak wattage.
