1.1.1	I went to turn on my computer the other day and when it was booting nothing came on my screen....I immediately thought it was a graphics card issue.	St
1.1.2	When I looked at the power button on my tower, it was just flashing and my computer system was not doing anything.	St
1.1.3	I have an 1.1 gig Athlon...Any suggestions would be GREATLY appreciated.	St
1.1.4	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	&quot;When I looked at the power button on my tower, it was just flashing and my computer system was not doing anything.&quot; Considering this is about all that is known besides that it's an 1.1 GHz Athlon, I'd only be guessing that you'll have to repair the machine.	St
1.2.2	Typically you strip it down to motherboard, CPU/HSF, power supply and a speaker and hope that it beeps.	St
1.2.3	If no beeps then you are looking at the four possible bad parts.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	A flashing power button usually means the system is in standby mode.	St
1.3.2	Holding the power button in until it shuts off, then powering back up will usually fix this.	St
