1.1.1	I have a netgear mr814 v2 router .	St
1.1.2	I have DSL .	St
1.1.3	I am connecting at around 200kbs with my router and around 500kbs with just my modem .	St
1.1.4	I have tried everything I know of to get it to be as fast as the modem alone but ca n't .	St
1.1.5	Also sometimes it is even below 100 kbs .	St
1.1.6	It is not connected to another computer right now .	St
1.1.7	Trying to get it to work correctly before adding the other comp .	St
1.1.8	Thnaks David	St
1.2.1	then try another router to test against .	Sug
1.3.1	Some DSL modems are actually modem/routers and have to be put in bridge mode if you want it to work correctly with another router .	St
1.3.2	For example , I 'm using a Westell 2200 that was provided with my Verizon DSL service that needs to be bridged to work properly with my router ( which is , coincidentally , an MR814 V2 ) .	St
1.4.1	I also have a Westell modem but not sure what model .	St
1.4.2	I do know it is an older one .	St
1.4.3	Our phone company had to upgrade it for me awhile back when they upgraded the system here .	St
1.4.4	How would I know if I have the type modem you are talking about ?	Ques
1.5.1	Well , mine shows the model number right on front .	St
1.5.2	Look at the label on the bottom or back and it should say what model it is .	St
1.6.1	It is a westell model number C90-36R516-01	St
1.7.1	OK , that model is not a router , so it is already bridged and passes everything through to your Netgear .	St
1.7.2	Have you tried to reduce the MTU size in the WAN setup of your router configuration menu ?	Ques
1.7.3	If MTU size says 1500 , drop it to 1492 .	St
1.7.4	If it is already at 1492 , try dropping it to 1472 .	St
1.8.1	What OS do you have , Win 2K and Win 98 you can tweek try going to speedguide.com and using the utilites there to tweek your settings	St
1.9.1	My MTU was at 1492 and I went to 1472 and it did n't make a difference .	St
1.9.2	I am running Win xp just in case you are wondering .	St
1.9.3	I appreciate your help .	Polite
1.10.1	Sorry , David , I 'm out of ideas .	St
1.10.2	Maybe it 's time to borrow/buy another router and see if that helps ?	Ques
1.10.3	That Westell modem is also quite dated and has been discontinued .	St
1.10.4	Perhaps an upgrade here , too ?	Ques
1.11.1	Thanks for your help and I think I will try to borrow a friends router and see what happens .	St
