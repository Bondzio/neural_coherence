5729	0	63269	750696	NR	fxelite	2/8/05 10:43 PM	1.10790258E12	3200+	I just have a simple question. Do you have to use DDR3200 with a XP 3200+, because I have seen on many sites that it is a requirement, also MSI told me that i needed it. HELP

When you get a high end cpu, expect to have high end ram in order to take advantage of the abilities present, otherwise it may just default to what works, which usually is lower results. enjoy -----Willy

The system processing is slower [maybe not noticeably] becase when the &quot;next&quot; clock arrives for the FS bus, the data is not avauble until the next clock of the memory bus. The Northbridge compensates by introducing &quot;wait&quot; states. These are states where the memory process has to wait for a clock time very frequently, resulting in slower speed overall..
