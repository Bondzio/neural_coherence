<s> Hi, I have Superb 4 FX motherboard made by QDI.Chipset made by SiS. </s>
<s> It has four USB ports on the back. </s>
<s> But they don't work at all. </s>
<s> The light doesn't even come on on the optical mouse. </s>
<s> I have been forced to install PCI USB cards. </s>
<s> I cannot find the USb drivers for the motherboard. </s>
<s> I checked SiS site but they said they were unable to porvide the drivers. </s>
<s> I got the MB from a local dealer and I thought he had installed everything. </s>
<s> I am unable to contact him. </s>
<s> Anyways I've tried Multiple devices on the ports on the MB. </s>
<s> None Work. </s>
<s> Is it a software or a hardware problem? </s>
<s> Did the repairman forget to plug in a cable or something? </s>
<s> Also the ethernet on the MB doesn't work at all. </s>
<s> I've also been forced to install a PCI networking card. </s>

<s> comes with a utility cd which includes the drivers. </s>
<s> I would (a) see that the usb connectors are properly attached to the motherboard (check the manual schematic) and get the utility cd from the vendor. </s>
<s> One other thing is you might check driverguide.com and other sites to locate the drivers Remember USB 2.0 not supported until XP SP2 </s>
