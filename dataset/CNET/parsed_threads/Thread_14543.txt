<s> I have recently encountred a very weird problem. </s>
<s> I turned off my computer, and came back the next day to find out it didn't work. </s>
<s> The weird thing is, the fans will work and power supply and motherboard fan all turn on when I push the switch, but normally when i push the switch, there's a green light at the front that will light up. </s>
<s> It no longer lights up and my monitor remains completely idle. </s>
<s> Can anyone advise me as to what could be the problem. </s>
<s> I've already checdk to make sure the video card is pushed in solidly and I'm really confused. </s>
<s> Thanks for your time and my specs are below. </s>

<s> This is a common problem. </s>
<s> All too often the power supply is the culprit, however a bad componet can give the same result. </s>
<s> You really need to inspect the mtrbd. </s>
<s> up close to see any fault or possible blown capacitors. </s>
<s> If not found, what seems to work is simply reseat any cards and try again. </s>
<s> If your system had alot of &quot;heat stress&quot; what may look good is really poor componet(s) that have become a weak link. </s>
<s> Try, shortening the &quot;power-ON&quot; lead that come from the frt. </s>
<s> panel for a monent. </s>
<s> It should respond with the system trying to start just like pushing the ON button. </s>
<s> If it still fails, some success is found in removing the mtrbd., try a simple test with it out of case, on some non-conductive material like cardboard and see if results are different, then re-install into case is postive(no power). </s>
<s> All the suggestions are ed. </s>
<s> guesses as this problem may go away then return but usually its power related even if fans run, the logic to fully turn-ON system is low or faulty. </s>
<s> Remove cpu and check the socket, if brown looking or cyctralized, you have heat problem. </s>
<s> If black or super dusty, you conductive materials allowing static to play havoc. </s>
<s> Oh yeah, real bugs can die their last across some contacts. </s>
<s> But, the best bet is to replace the power supply with one of 400W or better. </s>
