<s> Hi all, I'm looking to upgrade my wireless/wired network. </s>
<s> Basically I need: wireless N Gigabit Ethernet (4 ports) ADSL-2 gateway In one device. </s>
<s> Anyone know of anything? </s>
<s> Help! </s>
<s> I read your post twice and it seems you only need to go shopping, read reviews etc. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I have searched and found nothing. </s>
<s> However my ability to look for anything is restricted because of my workload and my hours at Uni. </s>
<s> Online stores are crap at determining between gigabit and regular Ethernet. </s>
<s> so please help me. </s>

<s> What you are asking for doesn't appear to exist. </s>
<s> Until you remove the gigabit switch.... Bob </s>
<s> Oh pooness. </s>
<s> Why I'm going to answer NO each time is simply this. </s>
<s> DSL providers are giving the new customers free DSL modems with wifi routers and the 10/100 switch units. </s>
<s> There is no incentive to make one with gigabit switches. </s>
<s> However you can bet you'll get better performance if you add your own gigabit external switch. </s>
<s> I would not look for the product you asked for since the market is non-existent (save for you.) </s>
