<s> Some of DVD burners are sensitive to their place on a bus - master or slave device. </s>
<s> Check the user manual or try both alternatives. </s>
<s> I had a similar problem with my HP Media Center PC (essentially the same model). </s>
<s> I tried using Nero7 and other software as well, and none of them liked the HP DVDs that I was using. </s>
<s> THEN, I tried some of the Mitsui DVD-Rs that I had on hand. </s>
<s> Those worked fine. </s>
<s> So, it may just not like your media. </s>
<s> i tried all the suggestions. </s>
<s> none helped though, but i appreciate the very quick response to my dilemma. </s>
<s> i then contacted hp tech support and after an hour and a half of trying their thoughts they concluded that my driver was fried and believe it or not they shipped me a new drive the next day. </s>
<s> i hope i can help you someday. </s>
