<s> Hey I just bought a new Gateway computer and I'm hearing that it only has 300 watts for its power supply, my graphics card requires 350watts. </s>
<s> Does anyone know how many watts are in a HP Pavillion A1222N? </s>
<s> If it does have at least 350 watts could I just simply switch the power boxes between the Gateway and the HP? </s>
<s> Would it affect either computer's performance? </s>
<s> Thanks a lot. </s>

<s> Larger units are very affordable. </s>
