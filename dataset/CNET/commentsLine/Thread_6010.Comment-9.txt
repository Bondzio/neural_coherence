at the time you installed xp to the 250gb drive you would have to rearrange the 250gb to be the primary drive or else the boot drive would remain the older 40gb.
there are no tools to move the 250gb to the boot position and fix all that would be wrong in the registry and boot areas of that 250gb drive.
makes sense to me.
today if you removed the 40gb it would like be on the master position and most systems the now slave drive should go missing.
there is little standard here but if you don't configure drives proper (i see no words that you are researching how to configure cables and jumpers) then it should go missing.
-&gt; let's' skip all this and try to determine exactly what you are trying to do.
then we can write what the fallout will be.
