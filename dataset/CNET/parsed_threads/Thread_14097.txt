<s> Noticed there was not much on CNET regarding them so I thought I give a short post about my experience maybe someone will find it helpful. </s>
<s> I am extremely impressed with their customer service and quality of craftmanship. </s>
<s> Their ordering system is also very pleasing and simple to use. </s>
<s> I get to easily pick and choose which parts I want to put together without being restricted. </s>
<s> I wasn't sure exactly what I needed and spoke to one of their live chat agents who suggests anything that will improve your system given your budget and the purpose for your computer. </s>
<s> I will continue to purchase my systems from this company, because I haven't seen a better company, yet. </s>
<s> They by far outperform Dell, HP, and all the big name computer retailers with their low prices, great customer service, quality work, and personability. </s>
<s> I think they are a smaller company which is probably the reason they are striving so hard to make a good impression, which is the business model all small businesses should follow. </s>
<s> Overall, a recommended company. </s>
<s> Thanks for a great experience Ironside and hopefully this post helps spread the word about your great company. </s>
<s> What you wrote may be quite true. </s>
<s> When someone joins the forums and on the same day puts in a plug for some product makes me wonder if I'm looking at Spam. </s>
