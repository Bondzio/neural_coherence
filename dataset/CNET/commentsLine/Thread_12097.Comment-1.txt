hey all, my project - i am wiring my house with cat6 cable, due to increasing bandwidth needs, i decided cat6 would be best for future applications.
i bought cat5e keystone jacks, assuming they would work (that and at the time i couldn't find cat6 keystone jacks anywhere, so i just figured they were one in the same).
i already opened the keystone jacks, so returning them is out of the question.
can i still wire a cat5e keystone jack with cat6 cable?
do you know where any wiring guides are?
i can only find guides for wiring cat5e into a keystone jack.
also, i don't understand this: on the keystone jacks, they have 2 options for wiring - 568a and 568b.
what does that mean?
i am under the assumption that one is straight through and the other is crossover, but if i'm wrong then please let me know.
