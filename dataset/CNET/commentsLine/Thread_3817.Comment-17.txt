i am still having the game freeze with generals.
i don't know.
i have tried everything we've talked about.
i just wonder if it's a hardware problem.
guess the only way to find out is to get an ati video card.
oh also i'm having a problem with a couple other games.
dark reign, and caesar iii both i believe are from win 95 era, but i know the hardware will support them because i've been able to run them in vista, however xp won't.
i think it's because i have sp3 on here.
but i just thought of one other thing i can try.
