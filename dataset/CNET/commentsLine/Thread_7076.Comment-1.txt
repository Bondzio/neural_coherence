hello, i have an older machine and can't afford to really get a new system atm.
i play online games like wow and ffxiv mmo, and was wondering if buying a better video card would help my bad fps problem.
i know i have a piece of crap machine so here it goes.. i have amd athlon 64 dual core 3.10ghz with a asus m3a78-cm motherboard and a nvidia geforce gt 240 video card.
running windows 7 with 4 gigs of ram.
atm until i can afford a newer machine, all i want is better fps and it doesn't need to be ultra graphics or anything, just running around without being so choppy in 25 man wow's and normal ffxiv gameplay would be good enough.
would a better video do this for me, and if so can you recommend a video card that will use its full potential in my motherboard without bottlenecking a great deal?
thank you
