I just bought a new an iMAC (11,2 ?). How can I copy the files from my old back up iomega to the new Lacie? I figure since I have a new iMac I might as well have a new backup drive. Is there an easy way to do it? Any help is very much appreciated! Once I get the files migrated over I am guessing most would suggest deleting files from the old drive before I dispose of it to eliminate any identify theft problems.

It would be a real pity if you needed data from that backup and found out that you don't know how to do it. So if you want to use that Lacie drive as a backup drive, see what software comes with it, or use Apple's Timemachine. But whatever you use, be sure you can get that data back if you need it! Kees
