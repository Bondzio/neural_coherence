<s> Hi there, My brother got a eMachines T1862 but altho it seems he had droped it. </s>
<s> so there was a part broken from the motherboard so im going to look for a new motherboard and just put that in there. </s>
<s> Now this is the Computer how it was http://www.emachines.com/products/images/emachines_t1862_main.jpg Specifications Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition Intel Celeron Processor 1.80 GHz (128 L2 cache & 400 MHz FSB) Intel 845GL Chipset 256 MB DDR (PC2100) (DDR for optimal performance) 60 GB HDD 1 24x10x40x Max. </s>
<s> CD-RW Drive 3.5'' 1.44MB FDD Intel Extreme Graphics 10/100Mbps built-in Ethernet 56K ITU v.92 ready Fax/Modem AC '97 Audio Keyboard, Wheel Mouse, Amplified Speakers 6 USB 2.0 ports (2 on front), 1 Serial, 1 Parallel, 2 PS/2, Audio-In & Out, Mic-In & Head Phone jack on front, 3 PCI slots (2 available) 7.25''w x 14.125''h x 16''d AOL 3 month membership included Now im useing the same CPU and stuff but i seen these motherboard's on the website called www.newegg.com and i was wonder which of the motherboards on this site is a good motherboard to pick from? </s>
<s> http://neweggmotherboard.notlong.com/ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ (Which One out of these?) </s>
<s> And Is these the once's that i can use with the Intel Celeron Processor 1.80 GHz ? </s>
<s> And Will This MotherBoard Fit Inside the caseing on the eMachines T1862? </s>
<s> (and i also found a Intel P4 CPU that was 2.8Ghz. </s>
<s> Can that also be on the motherboard?) </s>
<s> http://www.2and2.net/Priv/picture0017we.jpg Im not sure exactly what that is under the Socket the was a metal heatsink i think siting there...um how can i say this it had 2 Hooks or Pins that was suppose to hold it down into place...the other pin is broken off...and im not sure if the motherboard had a AGP slot but if it did its broken off as you can see... </s>
<s> The reason why is because the computer just shuts off.....the Computer was working, it was just shuting off and i thought it was because of that being off the motherboard those 2 things.... </s>
<s> You said: &quot;The reason why is because the computer just shuts off.....the Computer was working, it was just shuting off and i thought it was because of that being off the motherboard those 2 things....&quot; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ I suspect the heatsink clasps you mentioned broken can be replaced. </s>
<s> If you can try a plastic/nylon screws&nuts found in h/w stores that fit. </s>
<s> -OR- try you're local computer shop to retrieve one from a broken system, etc. </s>
<s> laying about. </s>
<s> Yeah, it shuts down if heat build-up is too great, do the fix, ASAP. </s>
<s> As for the mtrbd. </s>
<s> replacement is relative. </s>
<s> If you retain the emachine case, many ATX type mtrbds. </s>
<s> will work, BUT necessarily all holding posts can be used, beware of that. </s>
<s> You need to verify once installed, the mounting posts wehere they are and if extra not shortening out the new mtrbd. </s>
<s> or if less that flexing isn't an issue. </s>
<s> Hope this helps... tada -----Willy </s>
<s> But that wasnt really a answer more i fact i think... </s>
<s> But this is a picture i made to show what exactly i am talking about. </s>
<s> http://www.2and2.net/Priv/ThisRightHere.PNG The T1862 Motherboard is a VC37 http://www.fic.com.tw/product/motherboard/INTEL/VC37.aspx Intel 845GL Chipset, Performance uATX Mainboard for Intel Pentium 4 Processor. </s>
<s> 400MHz FSB, Embedded Graphics, DDR266, On-board Audio, LAN option, Ultra ATA100, USB 2.0 Now Im asking if theres a way that i can fix this or i could just buy one of these motherboards on this website. </s>
<s> http://neweggmotherboard.notlong.com/ Im Asking which motherboard out of the ones on that site is the best one to pick from? </s>
<s> the Nexgen case will support any MicroATX form factor mobo, and if you are going to reuse the Celeron, you'll need a socket 478, so that narrows down your options in the Newegg link. </s>
<s> Go with the BIOSTAR P4VMA-M.... More eMachine info can be found here: http://www.emachineupgraders.info/ </s>
<s> Well i kinda seen that myself i believe it narrows down to the only 2 i see that is mATX REFURBISHED: ASRock P4VM800 Socket 478 VIA P4M800 Micro ATX Intel Motherboard - OEM REFURBISHED: BIOSTAR P4VMA-M Socket 478 VIA PM800 Micro ATX Intel Motherboard - OEM TD25x said to go with the BIOSTAR but why do that? </s>
<s> i am asking because to me i think the ASRock looks better for one thing it has more USB ports on that one. </s>
<s> I've never used ASRock mobos before but I have used Biostar and had good luck with them. </s>
<s> You can use whatever you want... </s>
