not building it; this will be from the factory and ram will be installed.
perhaps one advantage of the xeon is that i can always add another processor later on?
i also understand that equal clock speed doesn't necessarily mean equal real-life speed.
benchnarks for almost identical xeon and c2d processors show marked differences in programs such as photoshop.
