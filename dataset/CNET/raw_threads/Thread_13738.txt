What if I use it (or can I use it?) for pure storage? I know about shelf life and all that The stuff I want to put on it is just stuff not the end of the world if I loose it. But my pc is pig slow and I just can not shell out for a new one yet. What are your thoughts?

Where's the second and third copies? 2. Where's the write protect? - Important since many backups get attached to a virus laden machine and without such the backup is compromised. 3. Will the backup copy be stored off site or in the fire proof safe. As to speeding up. Not in my experience. It will be same or slower. The rated life of the units is 5 years. Bob
