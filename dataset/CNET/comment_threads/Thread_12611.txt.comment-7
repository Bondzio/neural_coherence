Most manufactuers arre going away from proprietary parts.
Except dell, with their stupid btx cases/psu/etc... Emachines are very upgradeable and hardly has any spyware or adware when out of th ebox.
As for hP/compaq, definitely opposite.
Sonys are okay.
Gateways are good.
DELLs, nope, i wouldn't buy if possible.
BTW oems use pretty good parts that are off-the-shelf, but usually modified in that certain features are disabled.
