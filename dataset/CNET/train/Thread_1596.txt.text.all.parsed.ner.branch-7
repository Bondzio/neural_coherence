(i never buy a product with less than a 1-year warrenty, as that's usually a sign that they don't expect their product to last long.) after the first year, it's not common when a major problem occurs, so it's best not to waste the money on an extended warrenty. then, if something does go wrong, i take it as a sign that it's time to upgrade, assuming i hadn't already. for instance, a little over a year from now, just after the warrenty on your computer expires, the standard would be a dual-core processor, windows vista, etc, meaning you're computer's obsolete when compared to computers in the same price/performance bracket. thus, if you're a geek, you'll probably be upgrading or buying/building a new computer. however, for the ''average'' user, it is a nice security blanket, which assures them that they won't have to worry about the computer for x number of years. the lack of technical experience (and friends with such) and the desire to keep the same computer for several years without worry usually dictates whether or not an extended warrenty is purchased. now, for furniture, i always pay for an extended warrenty from the store. over the course of a few years, i see several computers come and go, but each one is cradeled by the same computer desk. each new tv sees the same couch get pelted with food when my favorite teams lose. face it, furniture is a much better value, for it doesn't become obsolete or broken down nearly as fast as technology. thus, an extended warrenty is well worth it. hope this helps, john

(if you feel comfortable doing so).
238	5	117936	1340360	1339089	angryfirelord	8/4/05 10:28 am	1.12315128e12	i never buy them	i think these &quot;plans&quot; are just a way to rip you off. usually if there is a problem, i just fix it myself because it is more of a hassle to deal with tech support, in-store or not. hey, if you run into a computer issue, just post it on cnet. you'll get better results.
238	6	117936	1344976	1340360	jrock18	8/6/05 5:24 pm	1.12334904e12	imho, you are all wrong.....	here's what you guys are missing. 1. best buy or cc does not offer &quot;extended warranties,&quot; because they don't extend the worthless limited defects only warranty from the manufacturer's. they provide service on everything except flood, theft, abuse, & software. the manufacturer doesn't cover heat damage due to usage, or anything else that is wrong due to just using your computer. &quot;defects only&quot; means it has to be the company's fault. 2. if you have a problem with it being gone for a week or two, then purchase the in-home version, because they don't get sent to the service center where the store's don't even touch it. honestly, it gets sent off and the store doesn't have any choice in how it's fixed. 3. it's not a rip off, of course the stores makes money on them, they make money on everything they sell. how else could a store stay in business? the biggest benefit to them is for the proprietary parts. i can fix my own computer, but i'm not going to jimmy-rig anything. i want the correct part and i don't want to pay jacked up prices from the manufacturer or spend time on ebay trying to make sure i don't get ripped off. of course people are going to have some trouble with the service plans. nobody's perfect and there are tons of these stores and millions of people who dealt with them. i've had nothing but good use out of service plans from these stores. go your own way, but don't listen to everybody on here, because there are plenty of advantages to those plans. learn everything you can about them and make up your own mind.
238	7	117936	1425247	1344976	ccjp03	9/16/05 5:07 pm	1.12689042e12	hmm	i've worked at best buy and circuit city in the repair department, and i have to say that the service plans (not extended warranties) are good on some items, and not worth it on others. laptops are one of those items thats a no brainer to get it on, especially with the battery replacement that is available, i've gotten a new battery every year, where if i were to buy it online for my model it was $230 per battery + s&h. as quality of work at bestbuy, depends on who touches it, best buy has over 2000 instore geeksquad agents, and i can swear that the majority of them our good techs, but i have met one or two bad apples, and trust me they dont stay with the company for long, b/c they do watch how many redos you get and you do get performance counselled. and as for how long it takes, depends, on desktop, if its anything but the motherboard/processor, then it can be repaired in store, which isnt that long of a fix. if its a desktop, they can only do memory and harddrive repair instore (alot of manf. will not send parts, but mem and harddrives are pretty generic) (notebook harddrive repair is new for instore warranty repair at bestbuy) as far as cc quality, well they are doing a massive recruiting effor of the more experienced geeksquad agents, so i'm new to them, and the as of now, the instore pc services do not handle any of the warranty repair. if your computers broken, you take it to customer service and they send it to the service center, i have heard that its alot faster then bestbuys service center, (bestbuy we would quote 2-8 weeks for items being shipped) at circuit they quote 1-2 weeks. overall, a computer is an investment, and if you want to protect your investment, then get the protection, dont hate on the sales people for pushing it down your throat, they are just trying to make a buck, (they may not get commission, but they get schedule more hours if they are more profitable)...
238	8	117936	1425277	1339089	willy	9/16/05 5:25 pm	1.1268915e12	imho, and then	i'm going to be very bias here. circuit city, screwed me on a rebate, so i don't recommend them any more and thus don't shop there either. plus, from past visits wasn't impressed with the computer side, it seems like what sears would do in sales, just not spectcular, imho. but man, get into audio&video they seem to cater to the customer, odd. best buy, is a big vendor here and the horror stories are at a mimium. the usual, they couldn't do this or that but after seeing the immediate repair facilities, its no wonder. i'm not impressed at all and they seem to hire your local &quot;teen guru&quot; tech, good or bad. however, the return policy is generous within the 15-day period. for both vendors, i wouldn't recommend any ext. warranty policy, use your credit card to offer that. but, if you get into a laptop, you should seriously consider it. this is the only item i suggest to do so as in most cases, it gets send out and not routed internally for repairs. but, it may take time to resolve as laptop gets send out. up to you, but desktops, no way. tada -----willy
238	9	117936	1425632	1339089	marzden988	9/16/05 10:15 pm	1.1269089e12	hmm.	the cold facts... cityadvantage plus plan (ccitys plan) -add on within 30 days of plan -cancel anytime (pro-rated) -plan starts from day 1 and covers beyond reg warranty (thats why it starts instantly,if it started the next year and you break something thats not covered incld. in manufaturuers, your screwed) plus plan covers extra stuff (e.g. power surge, water damage, cracked screen, dropping, anything) -also ask about the extras, they usually pay for the plan: camcorder play 54.99 2 years inclds annual head and dust cleanings (usually $50 done pro) we dont make commission off of it but sometimes our managers just make us hate it cause of the drive for selling it when we make no benefit. i do like the plan and find it much cheaper than compusas and relative to best buys minus accidental damage repair that ours have. its just frustrating when customers come in with a broken camera that sony wont fix in the first year and it costs the same for a new camera as it does to fix their screen ($189). i usually see those people buy it the next time...
238	10	117936	1426037	1344976	angrykeyboarder	9/17/05 6:32 am	1.12693872e12	it's a crap shoot.....	but more often than not, you're throwing money away. espesially if you pay for more than a year. every ''consumer-expert-type'' i've come across (online, in print or on tv) has alwyas said they are generally not worth the cost. most hardware thses days is pretty well made. even the cheap stuff. if something fails or goes wrong, 90% it's going to do so within the first few months of ownership (in which case the standard manufacturer's warrenty will suffice). case in point: i just bought my mom a new hp monitor. it was defective. i contacted hp online and they shipped out a replacement via 2-day air (with a sticker to return it prepaid). the second monitor had another defect, so we repeated the process. so far, so good, on the third one. again, problems generally turn up during the warranty period. standard disclaimer: ymmv
