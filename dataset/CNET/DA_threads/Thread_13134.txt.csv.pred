1.8.4	& lt ; br & gt ; Download and install the Adobe Audition ASPI Driver Patch available from the Adobe website at www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp ? ftpID=2517 .	St
1.8.5	Be sure to follow the installation instructions as provided .	St
1.8.6	& lt ; br & gt ; Just go to ( www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp ? ftpID=2517 ) and download the the aspi thing and install it .	St
1.8.7	If you have nero it says to reinstall it too .	St
1.9.1	I did a search on my puter and found no Adobe Audition .	St
1.9.2	Only & quot ; Adobe & quot ; a search comes up with is Adobe Acrobat .	St
1.9.3	I assume that is the program you use to create DVD 's ?	Ques
1.9.4	My 6522 came with Cyberlink Power DVD to perform that function .	St
