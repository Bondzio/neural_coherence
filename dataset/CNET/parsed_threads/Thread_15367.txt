<s> I'm in the process of upgrading my home network. </s>
<s> One of my big things is external storage. </s>
<s> I've been looking at some of these external HD's that can be connected to a network by ethernet. </s>
<s> Are these any better than, say, a USB external HD? </s>
<s> Are they used only for storage or could I install software there as well? </s>
<s> Even at 100BT speeds it seems some 1/4 the speed of USB drives. </s>
<s> And USB 2.0 drives seemed 1/2 the speed of IDE drives. </s>
<s> The units work but some will not like the speed. </s>
<s> Since the units I've used can be mapped to a drive letter, software could be put there but the speed loss would have me switching to dial up. </s>
