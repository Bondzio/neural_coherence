I tend to use &quot;shipping tape&quot; the one with the string in it.
besides being strong, you can cut it along its length and use the strip to wrap, place or tape down &quot;something&quot;.
It's certainly isn't electrically conductive and sticky and strong and seems to work.
Of course, you handle it the best you can and don't buy cheap tape, either.
On some quick fix repairs, I have used &quot;clear labels&quot; used for mailing or folder labels, clear seem to be easy to work with and strong enough until a permanent fix is done or left alone.
