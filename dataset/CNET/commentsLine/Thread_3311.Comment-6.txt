i agree with the amd path.
forget about longhorn, whats here now is xp and the 64bit verson is in relase canadate 1 and it's free from ms, with the full relase 2nd quarter of this year.
you gan get 1gb gb of ddr400 memory for less that the 512gb of ddr500.
this is just my rule of thumb, i don't spend more for the video card that i do for the processor and mb combined.
i agree that you can get a screeming system for $700~800.
