<s> Look for games that have the logos, &quot;Runs best on Intel P4 HT&quot;. </s>

<s> Personally, I would not pay extra for a dual-core processor right now, especially since other factors affect performance more, such as how much memory you have and what kind of graphics card you use. </s>
<s> I have always used Celerons and Durons and with a decent graphics card, these machines will run games or other applications just as well as the &quot;premium&quot; processors, at a fraction of the cost. </s>
<s> You would be better off buying a motherboard that has a good upgrade path (meaning that it supports more advanced processors) but purchasing the &quot;value&quot; processor right now. </s>
<s> For example, for Intel-based systems, there are a lot of motherboards that support Celeron D, Pentium 4, and Pentium D, so you could theoretically purchase a cheap Celeron processor right now, and then if/when new software doesn't work well on that processor, THEN you can upgrade to a dual-core CPU. </s>
<s> ...to get involved! </s>
<s> %) The original question was : ''biulding a pc that is mostly going to be for gaming so i wanted to know if the dual core processor is worth the money since they are significantly more expensive. </s>
<s> So we have ''gaming'' and ''expense'', as the considerations. </s>
<s> Of the two setups I showed, for the same expense, the single core with the bleeding edge graphics card is a huge gaming winner! </s>
<s> Inclusions such as 'online gaming' and 'anti-virus load during play' , don't really have any impact (sorry Whyfi, but they don't) but now I've got to contend with ''desktop work'' (multi-processing benchmarks already on the Tomshardware link show dual core CPU's easily win) and ''games in the near future''? </s>
<s> Are you kidding me? </s>
<s> Let's all adopt an ominous echoing voice now : '' IN THE FUTURE!!! '' </s>
<s> When games finally arrive that can use multi core (Unreal 3 / Unreal Tournament 2007 etc.) </s>
<s> power, according to AMD's roadmap we may also have CPU's with more than two cores (2007 for those too). </s>
<s> So that expensive dual core CPU with no game support now, might effectively be old / cheap / slow technology by the time the multi-core games do appear. </s>
<s> GeeBee. </s>
<s> I think the real question here is, &quot;What kind of games are you going to be playing?&quot; A lot of the people who have posted in this thread have tossed around a lot of data, model numbers and comparisons. </s>
<s> That's cool to be hardcore (gamers... we are a fanatical bunch!) </s>
<s> but it's all relative to what games you're playing, or expect to be playing over the next few years. </s>
<s> Since I'd guess a hardcore gamer would (a) know exactly what they want to buy, and (b) not particular care about a budget, just so as long as they got what they wanted, I'm guessing you're a casual gamer who wants a quality rig at a good price. </s>
<s> If you're just wanting to play some games like World of Warcraft or Quake 4 and don't want to break the bank, I'd recommend going with a solo core, and invest the savings in plenty of RAM and a great video card, which is really what counts when you're playing games. </s>
<s> For RAM, get a minimum of 1GB of quality memory, preferrably with heatsinks. </s>
<s> Get more if you can afford it--there's no such thing as &quot;too much RAM&quot;. </s>
<s> For a video card, buy the newest thing you can afford and you'll be set. </s>
<s> Just make sure it's compatible with your motherboard, and that you have an adequate power supply to push it. </s>

<s> You suggested that if TomsHardware had run anti-virus during online gaming, your ''significant power drain'' would allow the dual core CPU to win. </s>
<s> With an average security load of 4.47%, and TomsHardware benchmarks showing single core gaming ahead by only 3.33%, the dual core system is the winner by an average of 1.14%, or 1.5fps per game if you prefer. </s>
<s> I appreciate there are those who would actually consider this to be significant, but that being the case they might also be using better than average security software (I'm just lucky I lose less than 1% to security measures I guess), and the single core would be winning again, but by an even slimmer margain. </s>
<s> Looks like we're even there, let's call it a draw then eh? </s>
<s> I'll do anything to avoid maths and Olympic analogies! </s>
<s> %) There's a saying about stones and glass houses, which is always a problem for sticklers! </s>
<s> I can see your point that changing the original question could make it look good or bad for one hardware platform or the other. </s>
<s> But (anti-stickler mode : on) you added anti-virus software running during online gaming (neither of those were in the original question, or inferred either!) </s>
<s> first , and only then did I counter with an inclusion : the money saved buying the cheaper of the original two CPU choices, could have allowed the OP to put it towards something which would have a far more dynamic impact on gaming. </s>

<s> I have installed the new components and windows won't boot even in safe mode . </s>
<s> The system goes through POST fine with standard 1 beep , I can access BIOS and all components and memory are recognized without problems . </s>
<s> My skill level is a novice at these problems , any input would be helpful . </s>
<s> Thanks . </s>
<s> I am assuming that you are using the same hard drive that u used for your previous motherboard. </s>
<s> The problem is that new motherboards sometimes will require a fresh install of your windows disk. </s>
<s> When the system boots up, is there a message that says load disk{or system disk}. </s>
<s> I had that problem before and reinstalled windows, took care of problem. </s>
<s> Just make sure you set the cdrom in bios as your first boot device, hope this helps. </s>
