i need help with an ongoing cd/dvd writer issue that's really driving me nuts.
recently, i had some pc problems (replaced my main system hard drive and repairs were made to my motherboard's batteries).
i had one problem after another.
lately, i've been having consistent problems with my dvd writer.
when i inserted a dvd or cd, blank or not, my pc shut down as soon as it began to read the disk.
if i booted my pc with a disk in, it shut down immediately.
this happened the great majority of the time, but not always.
i tried uninstalling the drivers and adding them back on, but it did not help.
i disabled and then enabled the drive.
i removed the drive and then added it back in the device manager.
i also replaced the cable and checked the jumpers.
i virus checked my system.
the manufacturer suggested that i use microsoft's fix it program, but it asked for a disk to be inserted and this resulted in a shutdown.
finally.
i assumed it was a hardware issue and i replaced the drive.
the problem continues as before.
the same fix attempts have failed.
any suggestions would be helpful.
thanks...john os: windows xp, sp3 new cd/dvd writer: lg # gh24ns95 (sata) old cd/dvd writer: lg # gh22np21 (ide)
