3299	0	102184	1172346	NR	SeaninWa	5/5/05 6:25 PM	1.1153175E12	T6216-Memory upgrade advise..please :P	Hey All, I am going to purchase this machine very soon, waiting on tax refund I understand it come with 512MB DDR400/PC3200 DIMM (2x256MB sticks) and it has 4 memory slots total. So I want to leave the 2-256 modules in place and add 2-512MB DDR333/PC2700 DIMM modules. I want to use the PC2700 or DDR333 (I bielve these are the same) because I have one 512MB DDR333/PC2700 DIMM already and then I would only need to purchase 1 more, since you have to have memory modules installed in pairs, I understand. I have read on the motherboards website it accepts DDR333/PC2700 by the way. You will notice I am trying to run different clock frequency memory modules simultanously. Do you think there would be much conflict? In my experience it would not be a problem as the DDR400/PC3200 should clock to the lower demoninator, which would be the 512MB DDR333/PC2700 DIMM. Lastly about memory. It's not an issue that all the modules are not of the same capacity is it? Like I don't need all 512's or all 256's or all 1GB modules, right? It never has been for any other pc I have had but want to make sure. Thanks for reading this far by the way! That would give me 1.5GB memory running @ 333Mhz. I don't honestly think the frequency difference from 333Mhz to 400Mhz is going to be noticable. Do you? I will also add a x700 Pro PCI-E video card. Which will free up the 128MB shared memory and rock my gaming world, I believe lol. I am unsure about a sound card. I will most likely hook it up as is and decide from there, it's not that important to me. I see Best Buy has a 19&quot; CRT Flat Screen Monitor in their ad this week for $129.99 then $30 rebate for $99.99 + tax. It's their own brand name (Insignia). I have read, so prolly only average performance but still 19&quot;!! I will add this also :)- Thanks very much for reading and responding :P

What is the price difference? Is it so much dat ure not willing to fork over the dough? Also i would not go with the x700 pro as it suks compared to the 6600gt. at newegg, evga 6600 gt is $160.

Well I have 1-stick of 512MB DDR333/PC2700 already in the pc I am using now and wanted to use it so I would only have to buy 1. I guess I will give it a shot and see what happens. It's not like it would damage anything and if it runs great then what the heck lol. On to the x700 vs. 6600GT. I have read some reviews and they seem to be very close in comparison but I have read about people with similar machines to T6212 with ATI strucures built in to the motherboards that have said they get better graphics from the x700. The reason for my choice btw. Maybe that's not so? Could you point me to a place where I can read more up on the two vs each other? Thanks! SeaninWa
