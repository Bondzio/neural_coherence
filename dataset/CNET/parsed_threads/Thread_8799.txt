<s> I plan on buying a new desktop computer in the next couple of months and many of the ones I've been looking at have slim cases or are made in a way that makes them impossible to add parts to the case. </s>
<s> Since most desktops are sold with only an ethernet port.. what are my options? </s>
<s> The computer will be in a room that doesn't have access to the modem/router wiring throughout the house. </s>
<s> I've been trying to figure out sometime what would truly have the best signal (PCI or USB). </s>
<s> There is also a WGA600N RM Wireless-N Gaming Adapter sold through Linksys for a really fair price, but since it is a gaming adapter meant for turning wireless-g connections on PS3s into wireless-n, I'm assuming it won't work. </s>
<s> I don't necessarily have to have a slime line ready to ship model, but they are the cheapest and easiest to get going. </s>
<s> Any advice on what to do will help. </s>
<s> I'm simply looking for the best wireless connection available. </s>
<s> My own experience has been that PCI is better. </s>
<s> Possibly the card can use more power because it's installed straight into the motherboard -- and cooling issues don't usually arise. </s>
<s> Can have traditional PCI installation annoyances. </s>
<s> Many instances of USB wireless adapters overheating -- and the wireless seems less effective. </s>
<s> Usually foolproof to install. </s>
<s> So, you're seeing that there is no way to add a PCI card. </s>
<s> If any PC is so cramped that &quot;add ons&quot; are not possible, I think I would look elsewhere. </s>
<s> As far as adapters, PCI is the first choice. </s>
<s> yah i figured it would be a stupid idea to buy a slim flag ship pc, but when it comes down to it, it's is usually a lot cheaper to buy an off the shelf because they have fast processors that usually cost half the price of the computer alone. </s>
<s> I guess I should just keep looking. </s>
