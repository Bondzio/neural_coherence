<s> i dont know if anyone has run into this problem but i was trying to install my new 200gig hd ,in windows xp, and it wouldnt install it with the install software cd or any possible way and then all of a sudden it started clicking and it shows on another computer that the drive is locked, is there any way to unlock it? </s>
<s> i want to use the drive as a second one on my computer but im afraid that i might have a new paper weight, any help would be appreciated </s>
<s> XP doesn't support such (until SP1) as well as other OSes. </s>
<s> More at http://www.48bitlba.com/ Bob </s>
<s> well i have xp updated to all the latest that i can get ahold of through their website, so it has sp2 installed and i thought that would fix the problem but im still clueless, thanks for all your help though, its greatly appreciated </s>
<s> It's some utility on the drive maker's site for you to see if its connected proper. </s>
<s> Some allow you to wipe the drive in preparation to partition/format with the Disk Management tool in XP. </s>

<s> will this help me unlock the drive though? </s>
<s> cause when i put the drive in another computer it said the drive was locked </s>
<s> Some look for the magic bullet. </s>

<s> What install software cd were you using? </s>
<s> You shouldn't have to be using anything on that drive if you plan to use it as a second harddrive (slave) with XP except to hook it up as a slave and then format it when you get to the desktop. </s>
<s> If you were trying to install XP on it when you already have XP on the system as the boot, then that may be where you ran into trouble. </s>
<s> You don't mention what position you hooked that drive up as on the second machine (master/slave? </s>
<s> )....nor do you say if you hooked it up as a slave what the actual boot drive on that machine is. </s>
<s> TONI </s>
<s> sorry, i have it hooked up as the slave drive on the main computer and it was hooked up as a slave on the other computer as well, i am trying to hook it up to be a second drive, i tried the install cd from maxtor that come with the harddrive, thanks for you help </s>
<s> There is a possibility that one or more area/s in this harddrive is damaged. </s>
<s> If the warranty has been expired then I problaly would try to bypass the bad area with partition magic (but you don't want to buy PM just for that though). </s>
<s> I just say that's what I would do. </s>
<s> may have put ezdrive/ezbios on the drive when it wasn't needed. </s>
<s> Use the bootdisk that came with the harddrive, switch to the second/slave drive on the screen, and proceed to uninstall that program (you used to have to choose ezdrive/ezbios as if you were going to install the program before you saw the uninstall feature...not sure if that's how it is now). </s>
<s> Once you have that program uninstalled, remove the floppy disk, reboot the computer and get to the desktop from your Master drive. </s>
<s> Once there, open My Computer, right click the slave drive letter that shows up, and choose FORMAT from the menu choices. </s>
<s> That will format the drive for NTFS and get it ready for data. </s>
<s> TONI </s>
<s> thanks but it wont even install from the original cd that came with it, it just locks up and i have to restart, i took the drive back out of the computer and know when i try to do anything it just kinda locks up for ten minutes or until i get pissed and restart even open my computer, it was brand new when i bought it, </s>
<s> and looked at their FAQ's, or email them and ask about &quot;Locked&quot;. </s>
<s> Maybe search for drive locked in these forums. </s>
<s> I noted such posts a number of times. </s>
<s> Still confused why you were putting SP 2 on the slave drive. </s>
<s> You only need the operating system on the boot drive. </s>
<s> Don't worry about paperweight. </s>
<s> As Art says they are warranteed and the major drive mfr's honor it with no questions asked. </s>
<s> They may ask a question or two to see if they can get you to unlock it. </s>
<s> If not they give you an RMA and reasonably quick turnaround. </s>
<s> no i have sp installed on the master drive not the slave one, sorry bout the confusion, ive tried looking at the maxtor site but to no solution, i will just dig deeper there and on these forums </s>
<s> You #1 make a 98SE boot floppy ( search for bootdisk.org-com something like that),#2 browse / download ZAP from http://www.isgsp.net/files/ibm-wipe-zap.zip (cut and paste),#3 unzip to a floppy,#4 install the kaput HD as the Primary master-cable select, no other drives connected ex the floppy,#5 boot with the 98SE floppy, #6 insert the ZAP floppy, type zap at the A: command prompt and it will give the option to wipe the first (128 sectors-I think) portion of the drive to original state-unformatted and everything-not even a boot record, #7 then move drives back into proper position, (new drive as slave) boot up XP and chances are good it will show up in drive management as good-but unformatted... </s>
<s> an RMA??? </s>
<s> Theyt'll ask you to run a diagnostic that you can download. </s>
<s> it won't run and then you get to return the drive and get it replaced. </s>
<s> The replacement may be yours repaired or someone elses repaired. </s>
<s> I noted that most of the &quot;drive locked&quot; threads here were related to Maxtor drives. </s>
