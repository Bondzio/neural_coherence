I remember an old Computer Shopper magazine had the answer to this, but I am unable to find/remember what that was TIA

Here's one about moving XP -&gt; http://www.michaelstevenstech.com/moving_xp.html Covers most of the issues, including the OEM warning. Bob

There was a certain folder in the registry that you deleted, then when you re-installed the HD it picked up everything again, the controllers, the video, the nic, the hd ... you get the idea. Similar to the roll-back feature, but not exactly. The machine is a 815e chipset and I need it to go into a system with a 440bx chipset.

I don't expect you to see any issues. To really feel the issue, just try this from some Via chipset to some of the newer Sis or Nvidia chipsets. Truly not for the timid. Bob

This is not valid with XP. Sorry.
