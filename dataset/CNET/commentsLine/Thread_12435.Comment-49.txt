spinrite is a fantastic product if you need to recover unreadable data from a magnetic drive.
i have had occassion to use it 3 times in the last 17 years (the most recent was yesterday on an xp laptop hardrive) and it worked flawlessly each time to recover totally dead drives.
yesterday i used spinrite 6 on an ntfs partition that couldn't be recovered with windows xp recovery tools.
spinrite found the bad sectors, repaired the data and my laptop is back to normal.
$89 is a cheap price to pay for recovering lost data!
