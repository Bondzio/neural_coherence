The network is peer to peer and all PCs are running Windows XP pro. Each PC is also running Zone Alarm with antivirus, with the network in the trusted zone. For some reason, the router is very picky about internet access. I can get though to google and yahoo and almost no other sites, either using a browser or pinging. Other than installing a password for access I have not tried any fancy security settings on the router firewall. Any suggestions on how to access the rest of the internet?
