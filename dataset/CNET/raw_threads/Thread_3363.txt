It still has my op system winxp home. when i plug into usb it recognizes the connection but no drive appears. do i need to change jumper settings? I want to reformat the drive to rid it of the old data, but I am getting worried that I will screw it up. Any suggestions will be most appreciated. thanks Sam

Drive letters are hidden with TWEAKUI. 3. The drive format is not supported by the USB CASE. It is not a sure thing that placing a drive in a case will retain its contents. Bob
