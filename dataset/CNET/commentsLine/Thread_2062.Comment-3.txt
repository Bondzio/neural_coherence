ok, well first off, this is a boot drive, and i have been in the bios so many times i damn neer have every setting memorized by now.
as for installing drivers... i've already got windows and a butload of other programs installed, so is there a way to install the necessary drivers without re-installing windows?
my biggest problem with installing drivers during windows install is that of my 4 computers, i don't have one single opperational floppy drive, much less any disks to put the files on.
thanks for the info bob
