I've helped too many recover their machine from driver hell when they accepted a Microsoft offered driver or used the &quot;driver update&quot; button or any number of driver utilities. -&gt; I'm going to write that all are a bad idea. READ http://www.pctoday.com/Editorial/article.asp?article=articles/2004/t0202/08t02/08t02.asp&guid= and see the usual sites you can search for drivers you can't find from an old make/model device you own. In closing, I've found it best to inventory the machine (try BELARC ADVISOR) and use that to fetch drivers from the maker's web sites. Bob
