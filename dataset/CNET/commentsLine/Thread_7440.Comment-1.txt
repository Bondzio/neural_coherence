i am running xp pro sp2.
i have tried to install an external usb drive.
the system seems to install it fine, the device manager sees it and says that it is working.
it shows up when i click &quot;safely remove hardware&quot;.
when i try to use it or find it in windows explorer or &quot;administrative tools&quot; it isn't there.
i also tried to find it with &quot;partition magic&quot; 8.0, no luck.
