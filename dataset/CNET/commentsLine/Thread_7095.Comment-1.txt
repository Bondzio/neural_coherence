i started building a new computer that would not boot into windows.
i thought that it was maybe the processor(amd sempron)because the mobo didnt directily say that it would take it.
however, i ended up haveing the hd jumper in the wrong place.
it works now.
but the problem is when i took my old amd athlon 1800+ out of my other computer to test the new computer.
i thought that if the 1800+ worked, then it was the sempron that was the problem(the 1800+ didnt work so went back to the other).
when i reinstalled the 1800+ into my old system the computer would begin to start up.
( fans, lights, hd, cds, floppy, all begin to start up) but within 3 seconds it shuts down, without a beep, without any signal to the monitor.
it is strange.
does anybody know what i did.
did i fry the cpu?
mobo?
something?
thanks tyler
