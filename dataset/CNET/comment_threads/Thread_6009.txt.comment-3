There are lots of SOCKET 478 motherboards with AGP 8X.
The are some really good ones that have Intel 865PE or Intel 875P northbridge chipsets.
I can recall a couple motherboards that that implemented PCI Express with SOCKET 478, but not all video cards work with it.
Buggy.
Here's one: http://www.asrockamerica.com/Products/P4Dual915gl.htm MY RECOMMENDATAION: Save your money and apply it to a new 64-bit AMD CPU system with PCI Express X16 slots.
Go for a dual core CPU if it fits the budget.
If you really want to upgrade the motherboard, I recommend going with a nice 865PE or 875P motherboard with that CPU and adding an AGP8X nVidia 6800GT if you want a good gamer.
You probably will need a good 450W PSU or better if you get that video card.
