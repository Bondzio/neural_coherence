My motherboard is all sata devices so I bought a ide to sata connection and nothing. So I bought a pci card that has the ide connections on it. Nothing again. I thought it might be that I needed the drivers but I can't find them anywhere. LG's website has nothign on it except for tech specs.

Not only must you find motherboard SATA drivers but booting from a SATA CD/DVD only adds more misery. I'm surprised that anyone would do this. Bob PS. This issue is not what it appears to be.
