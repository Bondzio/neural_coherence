I see the problem.
Take this path on the link provided: http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/product_support/en/product_support_central?c=us&l=en&s=gen Select your &quot;product model&quot;&gt; desktop&gt; Dimension&gt; 4700&gt; click, confirm.
Now in the right clomn near the bottom of it look for the wrench icon, labeled, &quot;Tools and Applications&quot;.
Under this choose...&quot;Scan your PC for common problems using PC Checkup&quot;.
If you trust Dell run the scan.
