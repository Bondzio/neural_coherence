<s> Hello, I'm planning to build a PC with the following configuration. </s>
<s> Processor: Intel Core2 Quad Q9400 95W ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Produc...82E16819115131 ) Motherboard: MiniATX Intel BOXDQ45EK ( http://www.newegg.com/Product/Produc...82E16813121358 ) Display: On-board Intel GMA 4500 (may upgrade to a high end nvidia card later) RAM: 4GB DDR2 800 HDD: 500gb SATA @ 7200 RPM + USB powered 500gb external drive (WD Passport) CD/DVD Burner: Yes Could you tell me what should be the minimum power supply wattage I should be looking at ? </s>
<s> .. My guess is 375W. </s>
<s> Also, I want to put this in a mini ITX box, but most miniITX boxes come with &lt;200W of PSU, so I'm going to have to buy a PSU seperately. </s>
<s> Would a regular PSU fit in the miniITX case? </s>
<s> .. or do they have a special powersupply size for them. </s>
<s> Your comments on my chosen configuration and decision to go for MiniITX for this configuration are most welcome. </s>
<s> thank you, regards, Puneet </s>
<s> of the supplied power supply. </s>
<s> Specs as in the physical size. </s>
<s> Now find a more powerful supply with the same dimensions. </s>
<s> If one is not available, then external it is, or a larger case. </s>
<s> .. more concerned about the watts than the case .. </s>
<s> That's too small a case for this many Watts. </s>
<s> Are you trying to burn up hardware? </s>
<s> I see such a board exists but you may be unaware of the implications of 100+ Watts in such a small case. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Asus P3-P5G33 it comes with a 220w power supply and a low-profile heatsink/cooler that exhausts hot air out the side vent. </s>
<s> it can acommodate everything you've mentioned but it does get a bit loud with cpu-intensive activity. </s>
<s> these asus barebones are getting hard-to-find however so you may want to look into msi's alternative. </s>
<s> also consider getting a western digital &quot;green&quot; drive (5400-7200rpm adjustable). </s>
<s> if you want to stick with a mini-itx combo, any unit with a 250w power supply will be adequate. </s>
<s> (dell studio slim pc uses a 250w power supply for a q9550 quad core.) </s>
<s> as for upgrading to a better video card, you won't find many that are low-profile and you'll have to measure the power supply of your case to determine what replacement alternatives you have. </s>
<s> there is no mini-itx power supply standard size. </s>
<s> Cool, I love the barebones idea ! </s>
<s> .. atleast that'll guarantee I do not screw up in PSU selection. </s>
<s> as for the graphics card, I think I can let that go .. not going to game .. just going to use it as a media center PC with a 52&quot; TV .. i guess the GMA graphics chipset should work well for that ? </s>
<s> the msi may have hdmi outputs. </s>
<s> i've used the amd version of of this asus as a workstation/guest room pc with a 26&quot; lcd tv so i know it will work great as a home theater pc. </s>
<s> i let my subcontractors/clients rdp into the it to do their work/see demos, and i let my neices/nephews use it as their pc when they spend a weekend. </s>
