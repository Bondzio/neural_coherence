I am in the market for a webcam.
This will be my first.
Basically, I am looking for something simple to use with decent picture quality.
I only plan to use it for video conversations via msn.
This little number caught my eye recently on newegg: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16830108129 I gladly welcome any purchasing advice.
Especially in regards to what features I should look for and what would be a good compromise in terms of price and quality.
Many thanks in advance!
