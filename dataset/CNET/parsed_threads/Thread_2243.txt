<s> would you purchase a refurbished printer? </s>
<s> what are the pros and cons of buying refurbished items? </s>
<s> With new inkjet printers under 99 bucks, a refurb is unlikely. </s>
<s> However a factory refurb (HP for example) for 1/2 price may be acceptable if you can accept that 100 dollar printers tend to last 2 years. </s>
<s> -&gt; In the big printer market such as 1,000 buck lasers, factory refurbs are not a bad deal since again you can save 25 to 50 percent and again you must accept you may get a shorter lifespan. </s>
<s> Many will expect as new life and performance so those should never consider a refurb. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> refurbs arent so bad they are factory checked although it just that somebody has already printed some pages so for that month the # of pages you can print will be less </s>
<s> Long before PCs and thier kind, I rebuild many an office printer of dot matrix genre. </s>
<s> Even line printers of brute force printing(govt. </s>
<s> checks) that took untold amounts of tasks day after day. </s>
<s> They were rebuild onsite and back into servcie to save s/h costs. </s>
<s> Then back at the factory, yeah the real factory where we rebuild(refurbed) them and offered as whatever deal the marketing got us into. </s>
<s> Of course we never saw that end of it, but these printers we refurbed took a QC(quality control) steps that defeated poor rebuilds and low quality attempts. </s>
<s> We kept at it for years so the market is there. </s>
<s> But, as the yrs went by and PCs came around, the needs became simplier and the introdcution of Japaneese printers really cut into us. </s>
<s> The 1st Epson was a beautiful little printer but it wasn't made to print all day and night. </s>
<s> It was capable for simple tasks that PCs placed on it. </s>
<s> So, to answer your question, what do you plan to use the printer for? </s>
<s> If its really important spend the money and ghet the right printer. </s>
<s> If you save for the right *TYPE* of printer and its a refurbed, all the better. </s>
<s> If not, buy new and be done with it. </s>
<s> Worrying about a printer should not take too much of your time, now and later. </s>
<s> Otherwise, buy a cheap printer whjen it breaks, buy another one, that's the way it is now. </s>
<s> A decent one is worth fixing and on top of that it won't break or let you down often as its build to do its tasks. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Refurb can be great. </s>
<s> Anyone that returns a pc or electronic devic cannot be sold again as new, it therefore can be a great deal to buy a refurbed product from the direct sites like dell.com or refubdepot.com. </s>
<s> However sometimes refubished products can have cosmetic blemishes. </s>
<s> Refurb usually carries a 30-90 day warranty too which is when chances of something breaking are the highest. </s>
<s> The best way to buy refurb is to go to an outlet store so you can see the product before you buy it. </s>
<s> That's why the Sony outlet store is one of my favorite! </s>
<s> lol </s>
<s> I've found that most refurbished items come with a short warranty.Usually not more than 90 days.Some original warranties(like monitors) come with 3 years parts and labor.I think that a 3 year warranty is probably worth something so I would want a significant discount for a much worse warranty. </s>
<s> My old Lexmark printer needed a new cartridge after several years of sitting in an unheated summer cabin in MN. </s>
<s> A new black cartridge costs about $30. </s>
<s> I bought a &quot;NIB Factory Sealed Lexmark Z715 Photo Ink Jet Printer&quot; on eBay for $12.50 plus $14.75 s&h. </s>
<s> It was new with two unopened cartridges, black and color. </s>
<s> The seller got it free with a new computer and didn't need it. </s>
<s> I have had great luck with refurbished electronics. </s>
<s> I've purchased 3 hdtvs and a home theater system and they've all been fantastic. </s>
<s> I think it is important to purchase extended warranties with them, but the end result is you get a product for less money and longer coverage than new, imo. </s>
<s> Refurbished parts may be good to use if they are not of much importance in ur PC. </s>
<s> For example mouse and keyboards can be refurbished because there is not much to do with them. </s>
<s> However if u consider a refurbished printer or any part for that matter u may or may not get the desired results for ur work. </s>
<s> Actually refurbished parts are those that are those parts that have minor mistakes during manufacturing which are rectified later and tested. </s>
<s> If u wish to buy a refurbished printer check out for damages on the body. </s>
<s> Verify that the cartridges are properly placed and if possible print a test page to check the image and text quality.......Finally BUY a TRUSTED BRAND!!!!!!!! </s>
