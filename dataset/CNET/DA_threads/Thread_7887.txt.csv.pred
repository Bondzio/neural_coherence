1.1.1	I have already successfully set up this printer to print pictures , fax documents , and scan , etc .	St
1.1.2	However , my problem is I can not figure out how to get the printer to operate on my wireless network .	St
1.1.3	On the XP disc , I found and opened a utility for wireless configurations , and in the instructions , I filled out the required network info , and then it copied the files to a USB flash drive .	St
1.1.4	From there , I was supposed to plug the drive into the printer , which I have tried several times , but the printer does not recognize the drive unless photos are stored on it .	St
1.1.5	I 've tried this with different flash drives with no luck .	St
1.1.6	I also attempted to set it up wirelessly by using my Mac , but the install CD will not even install the basic software .	St
1.1.7	This may be because of Leopard , as the OS X disc lists only OS 10.3 and 10.4 .	St
1.1.8	I can get to the install portion of the installer , but if I click Install , I get a pop up asking about a customer participation thing .	St
1.1.9	Clicking yes or no does not affect the installer at all , and it refuses to proceed to the actual installation .	St
1.1.10	So , no luck there either .	St
1.1.11	I 've looked around but I have n't found any information on this specific issue with this specific printer .	St
1.1.12	It does work with an Ethernet cable , but I need it to be wireless for my convenience .	St
1.1.13	If anyone could help with this , I 'd appreciate it .	Polite
1.1.14	I 've been installing/uninstalling the HP stuff off of the main PC several times to no avail .	St
1.1.15	And it is made by HP as well ...	St
1.1.16	I will keep looking into it and hopefully , I can get it set up .	St
1.1.17	Strangely , the setup button and menus on the printer do not even hint or reference wireless capability , although it should have it as the manual and CD suggest .	St
1.1.18	There are several networking options , but they are for changing IP settings and the like , which I 've tried .	St
1.1.19	Thanks for any assistance .	St
1.1.20	-BMF	St
1.2.1	After some more checking on the printer , it may be that it is in fact , not wireless .	St
1.2.2	The box makes no mention of it being wireless , only that it is capable of wired transfers ...	St
1.2.3	It may have Bluetooth networking if the printer 's onboard configuration site is accurate , but that wo n't do much good for me .	St
1.2.4	Still , if anyone has any information on this particular printer 's capabilities , please post them here .	St
1.2.5	Much appreciated .	Polite
1.2.6	-BMF	St
1.3.1	Hi , both 802.11 and bluetooth are optional features : Connectivity , optional	St
