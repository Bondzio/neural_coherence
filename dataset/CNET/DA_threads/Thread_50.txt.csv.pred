1.1.1	Hey Guys , Quick question for you : I can buy either a Corsair ValueSelect 2x256 Dual Channel DDR2 533 set or a G.Skill 1 x 512MB DDR2 800 stick .	St
1.1.2	They cost the exact same on Newegg .	St
1.1.3	Which do you think would be the better choice ?	Ques
1.1.4	This computer will not be OC 'd in any way , simply stock .	St
1.1.5	DDR2 800 is the highest RAM standard accepted by the Mobo I have picked , a Biostar TFORCE 550 for socket AM2 .	St
1.1.6	Neither set will be pushed to its limits , as they will go into a computer for my sister .	St
1.1.7	This computer has to stick around for a LONG time , so longevity and keeping the computer current for as long as possible is a concern .	St
1.1.8	My sister is the teenybopper type , interests include internet gossip w/friends , email , instant messaging , and mp3 .	St
1.1.9	thats about it .	St
1.1.10	so , with that said , any suggestions ?	Ques
1.1.11	Thanks Keith	Polite
1.2.1	only 1 DIMM .	St
1.2.2	Got to install 2 DIMMs to take advantage of the design .	St
1.2.3	If any way possible , start with 1GB vs 512MB RAM ... it will defer or eliminate the need to add RAM .	St
1.2.4	What MB will this be going in ? ?	Ques
1.2.5	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	Get your RAM facts straight on that motherboard .	St
1.3.2	I do n't think thatit supports Dual Channel and does n't it support DDR 400 ?	Ques
1.3.3	I would check the manufacturer 's product page .	St
1.4.1	Typo .	St
1.4.2	DDR2 800 ?	Ques
1.4.3	I always forget to stick in the 2 and I see that I also typed 400 .	St
1.5.1	supported .	St
1.5.2	It also shows DDR2 standard = DDR2 800 Question is , why go AMD now .	St
1.5.3	Looks like Intel is the better bang for the buck now .	St
1.5.4	Memory Number of DDR2 Slots 4x 240pin DDR2 DDR2 Standard DDR2 800 Maximum Memory Supported 4GB Dual Channel Supported Yes VAPCMD	St
1.6.1	I agree that Core 2 Duo is the better BFB ( bang for buck ) right now .	St
1.6.2	The caviat comes in with my price limit .	St
1.6.3	I am supposed to build the best computer possible being as close to $ 700 as possible .	St
1.6.4	I can do it with a Conroe E6300 , but it is hard to find a good mobo that doesnt cost as much as the proc !	St
1.6.5	We will see how it ends up .	St
1.7.1	you include .	St
1.7.2	VAPCMD PS .. Do n't forget about the 2 DIMMs to take advantage of the dual channel architecture .	St
1.7.3	Might as well get all there is to get within the design limits .	St
