...your hard drive or ide controller is failing and needs to be replaced.
i would start with the replacing the hard drive, since that will be the easiest part to replace.
you can install the new hard drive and test out the os to see if it still locks up.
if it does, then it's possible that the ide controller is failing and you'll need to replace the system board (presuming it's an on-board controller like other system boards).
a less likely, but still possible, cause is that the memory is faulty, which is easy enough to fix, but the odds that this is the problem is highly unlikely.
good luck!
