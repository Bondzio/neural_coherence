<s> Is there a way to setup a thumb drive where Windows reads the autorun.inf like on a CD? </s>
<s> I do not want the autorun option menus to come up, just the program to launch. </s>
<s> I need it to do this for any computer it is attached to. </s>
<s> Is that possible? </s>
<s> Widely documented so I'll just end here. </s>

<s> I'm setting this up for a blind person who has an installation cd for a program that allows the computer to talk. </s>
<s> When I try to set this up, Windows doesn't just run the program. </s>
<s> It gives a list of options, one of which is to run the program. </s>
<s> I want it to just go directly to setup.exe when the drive is inserted. </s>
<s> As to why the USB didn't autorun I can't see your work so I can't guess what you did. </s>
<s> I won't duplicate how CD autorun works since it's widely documented. </s>
