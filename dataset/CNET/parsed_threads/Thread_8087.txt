<s> Gateway has provided an updated BIOS to fix battery issues but no instructions on how to actually perform the BIOS update. </s>
<s> Does anyone know how to do the BIOS update? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance </s>
<s> Given your story and we have no reason to update the BIOS, why do this? </s>
<s> RESOLUTION: If the battery discharges below a certain charge level, it may not be able to be recharged unless the System BIOS is flashed to revision 3102 or later. </s>
<s> http://support.gateway.com/s/issues/220124590.shtml Only problem is that Gateway doesn't tell you how to do it. </s>
<s> I always leave it to the makers to tell how. </s>
<s> If they don't we have to ask them. </s>
<s> You don't want to have a forum tell you how without referring back to the maker's site. </s>
<s> You must be on guard since a bum bios install may cost you dearly. </s>
