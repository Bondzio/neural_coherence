a tv tuner card cannot act as a graphics card because it isn't one.
however, there are graphics and tv tuner combo cards, such as the ati all-in-wonder (aiw) line, which combine the two to save space and power.
personally i don't like ati and had a bad experience with their aiw line, so i go with nvidia's offerings, but the choice is yours.
for your second question, yes, you can get two separate cards, one tv tuner and one graphics card, and use them together, provided you have the slots available.
(pci, agp, and/or pcie.)
each would have its own respective duties.
of course there's still the aiw, which can do both and is likely to be found cheaper than purchasing the two cards individually.
hope this helps, john
