<s> I upgraded the memory on my PC. </s>
<s> I had forgotten that it was in hibernate mode when I put the new memory chips in. </s>
<s> When I booted it up, it went to the point where it said windows was resuming and then stopped. </s>
<s> I turned it off. </s>
<s> Waited 10 seconds and tried booting it again. </s>
<s> It appeared the system was loading until an error message which said the last shut down was not right and gave me two choices; one was to delete the data and resume with the restoration; the other was just to resume with the boot up. </s>
<s> I was not able to pick either choice. </s>
<s> There was no response from the keyboard.The only time the keyboard worked is when I pressed the F12 or F9 keys. </s>
<s> For F12 it went to the BIOS menu but I could not use the arrow keys to move up or down. </s>
<s> So I can't change the bootup to the DVD/CD or other location. </s>
<s> I put back the original memory and got the same thing described above. </s>
<s> I removed the CMOS battery, tried different combinations of the old and new memory chips. </s>
<s> Any suggestions on how I can get this working again? </s>
<s> I'm surprised it even responded to booting and had a display. </s>
<s> In other words, there is now a bad part or PC. </s>
<s> It's either the new ram or the mtrbd. </s>
<s> at ram slot that is controlling it all. </s>
<s> It has been hosed beyond any repair. </s>
<s> You seemed to done the obvious fixes, I would try yet an entirely different set of ram or test the ram else to prove they do work. </s>
<s> If test good elsewhere, there is a h/w fault present. </s>
<s> While you may think it's s/w corruption, then try a bootable &quot;live version&quot; of Ubuntu, burn a disc and how it boots or presents itself. </s>
<s> You can try any bootable disc for that matter and see how it proceeds. </s>
<s> make sure the bios has the CD/DVD drive as 1st bootable device. </s>
<s> the fact you can't change anything in bios or kybd. </s>
<s> isn't responding maybe again a mtrbd, problem now. </s>
<s> The plain fact is you had &quot;true power present&quot; even in hibernate mode and you fiddled with removing parts. </s>
<s> The result is as you find it and again to have anything displayed at this point. </s>
<s> Try the above and come back with your results. </s>
<s> I don't see anything around this until you test. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> First rule of thumb, never remove/install components in a live system. </s>
<s> There should have been indicators, lights etc., even in hibernate. </s>
<s> Generally, shut down, remove A/C power link (cable)...then work on the system. </s>
<s> Do you know how to fix it? </s>
