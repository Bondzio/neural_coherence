&quot;using an external hard drive with a USB 2.0 connection to backup all my important documents.&quot; This means to me this is a backup and not the only copy.
If the only copy then where is the backup?
That is, you did write backup and not &quot;to store all my...&quot; The issue of USB powered drives is not unknown.
Try adding a powered USB HUB or if your unit supports it, add a power supply to it.
If it is backup, then just delete the partition, create and format a new partition and begin again but keep an eye out for corruption.
If it does corrupt then make it a warranty issue.
