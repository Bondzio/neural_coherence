1.1.1	I have a custom built machine, which I put together in September.	St
1.1.2	I have been using the soundcard built into my motherboard, in device manager called &quot;Realtek High Definition Audio.&quot; The other day I had a microphone plugged in and it was turned on.	St
1.1.3	I turned the switch on the microphone to the off position, and as soon as I did, all hell broke loose.	St
1.1.4	I got about five dialogue boxes pop up with errors saying something about being unable to reset or detect the Wave Controller or something like that.	St
1.1.5	It was a few days ago, I don't remember the exact error.	St
1.1.6	Ever since then, my computer does not detect when I plug in speakers or a microphone and I get absolutely no sound.	St
1.1.7	I have tried everything.	St
1.1.8	I've tried updating the soundcard driver, I've tried doing a system restore to two days before this incident, and there is no change.	St
1.1.9	I'm wondering if it's possible that I somehow shorted out the circuits in the sound card.	St
1.1.10	Is there anything else I can try to restore my sound?	St
1.2.1	If you had a DVM you could do a continuity test across the mic plug with the switch in both positions.	Sug
1.2.2	A dead short during an attempted higher current output from the sound card's final amp stages just might damage it but I'm surprised they're not better protected.	St
1.2.3	As well, if you used a mono mic in a stereo jack that could have some strange effects.	St
1.2.4	You might be better off to disable that sound device in your BIOS and get an half way decent card.	Sug
1.3.1	I did use a mono mic in a stereo jack, so yeah, maybe that's what happened.	St
1.3.2	I ordered a cheap soundcard so, when it gets here I'll be able to install it and see if that fixes it.	St
1.3.3	Thanks for the input!	St
