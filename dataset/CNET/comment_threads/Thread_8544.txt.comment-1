So i had a macbook (last gen) which didnt upload footage off of my dvx 100a(panasonic)3ccd, its a high quality camera and with the 512 RAM i assumed it wouldnt upload because of the file sizes.
I took that one back upon the relese of the new generation MacBooks with a gig of RAM and i have been timid to try to upload usuing my firewire.
if this doesnt work is there anyway i can get my macbook (not pro) to upload footage (programs, drivers???)
any input would be a great help as i need to upload footage because im going into film school in the fall.
