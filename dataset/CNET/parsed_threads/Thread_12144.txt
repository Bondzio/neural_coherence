<s> Hi, I am new to skype and looking for a cordless phone with a range over 10m to use dedicated for skype. </s>
<s> I want to keep my current landline phone as is for the moment. </s>
<s> I am also looking at buying for my mother a skype phone where no PC is required so she can talk to her sister in UK anytime if she gets a similar set up. </s>
<s> Not sure how these work but assume you only need a phone line socket. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any good recommendations for phones I could buy within a budget as I have seen some VERY expensive ones and I'm a bit nervous about the cheaper ones and their quality. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help Kelly </s>
<s> Is that expensive? </s>
<s> u can buy a very nice Skype Cordless phone at http://www.amazon.com/shops/xpertbook </s>
<s> internet is a requirement (whether it's yours or someone else). </s>
<s> This phone is good if you want a cordless usb skype phone solution with your pc for a reasonable price http://www.ecrater.com/p/5273859/cordless-usb-skype-phone-with-lcd This is the best bet if you want a PC free skype phone thats wireless, it uses wifi internet to connect to skype. </s>
