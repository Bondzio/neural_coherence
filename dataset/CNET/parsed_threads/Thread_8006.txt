<s> Hi everyone, i have this problem with my pc, every time I turn on my computer, when it's booting and Windows logo start-up is being shown, my pc starts crashing. </s>
<s> but sometimes it works and i can go through my Windows XP but the system crashes again within 30 minutes. </s>
<s> i kind of thought, it might be the AC-Power, so when i turn the PC case key off and then turn it on again, it starts working but the story happens again, what's the problem? </s>
<s> is it because of the AC-Power or RAM, CPU may be. </s>
<s> i extremely need your guys help... </s>
<s> Remove the case cover. </s>
<s> Does it work longer before it crashes? </s>
<s> If it's crashing this bad it &quot;really&quot; needs a cleaning. </s>
<s> This thread untracked. </s>
<s> i tried that, and it's not working again. </s>
<s> i sometimes change the hard disk sata power cable and it works too. </s>
<s> i dunno what i should do </s>
<s> Sorry but the time till it crashes helps with what direction to take here. </s>
<s> It's not a fix. </s>
<s> but it crashes again. </s>
<s> what's your suggestion for this, should i change any device! </s>
<s> I suggest the usual cleaning of the machine (see http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-11319_7-6240575-1.html ) and retest. </s>
<s> No? </s>
<s> Time to research how to remove the CPU heatsink and refresh the heatsink compound. </s>
<s> I'll forgo telling you to check the heatsink fans. </s>
<s> You know to do that or you would not be fixing your own PC. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> how can i know about that? </s>
<s> I Hope that helps, I will try it. </s>
<s> I just recently changed my OS to Windows Vista, and every thing's just working fine! </s>
