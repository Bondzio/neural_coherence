No machine will support 2000+ ram unless you overclock.......don't go there. Your cpu is not great but it is not bad. Lets try to keep this as cheap as possible.......unless bucks don't matter? Post a link to your mobo.

You can not upgrade your gpu with that small psu. So.....the psu has to be made bigger and then a better gpu can be fitted. Again.......Post a link to your mobo or your machines make and model. Let's see what were working with.

10821	7	585245	5423809	5423759	bob b	2/13/13 7:19 AM	1.36073994E12	Ok	Benchmark wise the combo with the A10 wins. Good luck with your build.
