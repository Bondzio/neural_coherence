<s> I am having trouble with the Axim. </s>
<s> If you bump the back side of the Axim, it gives a screen that says that the battery latch has been opened, or sometimes shuts off and will not start again for awhile. </s>
<s> Any fixes for that? </s>
<s> And ask what the exchange service cost is. </s>
<s> As to the bump. </s>
<s> Don't do that. </s>

<s> I can't help but bump it on the back, as I use the device to tune pianos, and must have the device sitting on the piano. </s>
<s> It only takes the slightest bump to make it malfunction. </s>
<s> You call its maker to get it fixed. </s>
<s> There is so little we can do or replace short of the battery that you know where to go next. </s>
