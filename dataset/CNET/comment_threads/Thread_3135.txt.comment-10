I'm working on a friend's box.
Having the same problem with the same model motherboard during a replacement.
I double checked, and the CPU is a Northstar.
I don't have any spare socket 478 CPUs here, so I'll have to take the box home to work on.
Still, it's striking me odd that this particular model is showing up as much as it is on the search engines.
Anyone else?
