The tablet with the lowest lag will not be one we can discuss as even if I noted it here, it would be out of date by tomorrow.
The top 10 are all nice and I have one of those in the 10 and another model of another in the 10.
Why not one of the top 10 models?

Correction.
I don't own these.
The office is porting apps so I get to use them a lot.
