I will be using windows XP with MCE 2005 and then switching over to vista when it arrives. Since i will be using my computer for watching/recording tv i want a system that doesn't make any noise. Can someone here tell me whether the P4 chip or the graphics card make a lot of noise and if so is there any way to reduce it???? Noise during gameplay is okay though.Only wanna keep noise down while watching/recording tv. This is the first time i am building a new computer.Please let me know of any combatibility issues or what should be changed . Also is it better to build or buy a media center system that can play games? Also please state whether this config would be enough for vista. Also does it make any difference whether i use 400 MHz or 677 MHz ram on my pc??

Initially I had some noise problems with this setup. My computer is in my bedroom so I wanted quiet. First off the 6800GS is almost silent. I looked at a number of cards from different makers and chose the Leadtek because of reports that it was quiet. I have to shine a flashlight at the fan to make sure its spinning. The intel heatsink/fan is another story. Not only is it loud, it doesn't work well. I was idleing at 48C with fan cranking. I tried using Arcric Silver 5 and got the temps to 41C. Replaced it with a Arctic Cooler Freezer Pro 7 and realized that my 120mm case fans were really pretty quiet. The high pitched fan noise disapeared with the hs/f and my temps idle at 31-33C and 45C under high load. Replaced stock case fans with Aspire 120mm and now I can barely hear a humming.

The Artic Freezer Pro 7 is (imo) the best after-market coolor for a P4. It's cool and quiet (to steal a phrase) and cheap ($35). Unless you're absolutely sold on a 6800GS, take a look at current pricing on an X850XT. Both it and the 6800GS are starting at $170 on newegg. But the x850XT is significantly faster out the box (no tweaking necessary). It's fan is a bit noisier (but Artic makes a silencer for it also).

From the mem tests I've tried and the reviews I've read, name brand DDR2 with spd of 533: 4-4-4-12 will run at 667: 4-4-4-12. The benchmark difference is slight at best (less than 5%). So, your Corsair/Transcend should be fine at DDR2/667. Don't know what your budget is, but hexus.net gave your tuner a so-so review. But at the $50 price point, i 'spose that's expected.

Is DDR2 running at 533Mhz with 4-4-4-12 timings any faster than DDR at 400Mhz with 2.5-3-3-7? I've built a few systems, but I've never really messed with the timings. I'll soon have my hands on a gig of both types and I want to get another gig to match. I've read a bunch of conflicting articles, but most seem to think that unless you get DDR2 with really good timings, DDR is still the way to go. Good timings + DDR2 = $$$

Also please explain to me :- What's the AMD's equivalent( same or greater speed) of intel type 640 3.2 MHz 2 MB L2 cache processor???? Also are AMD's fans noisy????And how many fans do i need to install in such a system(which is comparable to 3.2 MHz P4 system)??? Also are AMD CPU's reliable?? Will they last for say 5 yrs without any problems????? And finally tell me which tuner card is better:- Pinnacle PCTV Pro or Compro Videomate Tv Gold Plus 2 ?

AMDs are as reliable as Intels, and they produce less heat. I would get an Athlon 64 3700+ San Diego core for about $210 on newegg. Get a name-brand socket 939 board, and some nice DDR400 (AMD doesn't support DDR2), and you're good to go. About the TV tuners: I have no idea. I had one in my PC, and I never used it. When I want to watch TV, I watch it on a TV :P.
