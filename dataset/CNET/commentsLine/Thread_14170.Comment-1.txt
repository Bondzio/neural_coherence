did advanced search on canon and info that came up was 1 to 2 years old i have had it with hp.
after buying over a dozen hp printers over past 20 years, seeing hp quality steadly go down hill, i am looking to buy a canon all-in-one printer.
i am looking at various canon printers (prefer under $150) and would appreciate input on opinions of which is best for ink usage, decent draft printing and reliability.
(my current hp aio locks up after about every 3 use) i don't print photos, so photo print quality not important.
thanks ben
