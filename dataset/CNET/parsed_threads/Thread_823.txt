<s> My roommate and I are trying to figure out this whole MAC to PC thing once and for all. </s>
<s> The problem isn't that we can't see each other on the network, it's that I can't access his external HDD over the network. </s>
<s> My stuff: HP Desktop (Windows ME) IBM ThinkPad (Windows XP Home - SP2) Linksys WRT54G (firmware 4.20.7) - Wireless (broadcasting Mixed B&G)and 4-port Ethernet His stuff: iBook G3 (OS X.3) LACIE External HDD, connected to iBook thru FireWire 400 - formatted for both Windows and Mac. </s>
<s> PowerBook G4 (OS X.3) - not relevant, really. </s>
<s> The only computer physically plugged in to the router is my Desktop. </s>
<s> The rest is all wireless. </s>
<s> If more system info is required, I can post it in response. </s>
<s> I'm able to access the internal HD on the iBook from my ThinkPad, through his computer name and User ID (\\computername\username - only able to see folders on his HD, not his drives), but when I try to add his external drive to my Network Places in the same fashion (\\computername\drivename), XP says the ''folder name is not valid'' (because it can't see it, most likely). </s>
<s> When I try to add just his computer name, it says I ''need a share to publish to.'' </s>
<s> He is still investigating the user priveleges route, and I'd like to know if the router's firewall (or the XP firewall) could be blocking our progress. </s>
<s> I also know there are issues with Virtual PC and FireWire, but I'm not sure if those issues are relevant to an actual PC (which doesn't have any firewire). </s>
<s> I've also read something about an ''Ad Hoc'' network on this forum, but I'm not sure what this is exactly. </s>
<s> Any help you could give us would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Please try two forums and wait a day for responses before making more posts. </s>
<s> Many of the regulars read more than one forum so you will get replies. </s>
<s> You'll get this reply since with more than 2 posts, which one is the active discussion? </s>
