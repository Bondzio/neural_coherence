<s> No I didnt do it. </s>
<s> I got a Gateway pc from my boss. </s>
<s> He formatted the hd so the &quot;work related info&quot; would be gone. </s>
<s> I know what formatting does and I need help to restore it. </s>
<s> It is a 20gb Quantum. </s>
<s> It had win98 on it and also drivers for cdrom, usb and ethernet. </s>
<s> I have a 2gb hd with win 98 on it but no such drivers (base system) I want to run the 2gb as the primary and the 20 gb as the slave so I can reinstall the OS on it. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> You want restore the 20gbs that was formated? </s>
<s> You want to install (I'm guessing) Windows 98 on 2gb of space? </s>
<s> Does Windows 98 fit on 2gbs? </s>
<s> So all you need to do is boot your Windows 98 CD or diskette and install Windows 98. </s>
<s> Install instructions are never given by me since we have the internet and a thousand pages on installing Windows. </s>

<s> I have 2 harddrives. </s>
<s> The one that is usefull is a 2gb harddrive that has win98 and a handful of other programs on it. </s>
<s> Dont ask me how they got all of that on a little hd. </s>
<s> My problem is that the 20gb harddrive i got was formatted. </s>
<s> I use the 2gb to boot the gateway system that the 20gb came in, and Im trying to create a new operating system on the 20gb. </s>
<s> I need to find new drivers so I can use the cdrom, and I need to find either win98 or xp to put on the 20gb after I get the new drivers installed. </s>
<s> The problem at hand is the jumpers on the back of the hd's. </s>
<s> The 2gb has 3 sets of prongs but no jumper. </s>
<s> The 20gb has 4 sets of prongs with the jumper on the second set away from the ribbon. </s>
<s> I want to know where the jumper needs to be so that the 2gb harddrive is the primary and the 20gb harddrive is the slave. </s>
<s> I have 2 computers. </s>
<s> The first one is a Gateway Desktop pc that was made in 2000. </s>
<s> It is designed for win98 and has the 20gb harddrive. </s>
<s> The hd in this computer was formatted by a guy that I work with. </s>
<s> The second &quot;donor&quot; computer is a no name brand built by my cousins husband. </s>
<s> It has a 2gb harddrive that has win98, microsoft office and a handful of other programs. </s>
<s> He uses winzip to fit everything on it. </s>
<s> I am trying to rebuild the Gateway using the small hd from the donor to boot the system, then installing win98 or xp on the 20gb harddrive. </s>
<s> I cant get the system to show the two hd's. </s>
<s> It will boot from the little one but it only shows that I have one, not two. </s>
<s> I put the jumper on the 2gb in the first spot closest to the ribbon. </s>
<s> The 20gb I have put the jumper in the second spot. </s>
<s> I am stumped. </s>
<s> Also,the little hd only has drivers for video and 3.5 floppy. </s>
<s> I need to find win98 drivers for cdrom, usb and soundblaster sound card. </s>
<s> Any advice or suggestions would be great. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Today we use 80 CONDUCTOR IDE CABLES (see google.com about that) and both drives are jumped to Cable Select. </s>
<s> Even a 2000 era PC should have that cable and use those jumper settings. </s>
<s> The CDROM is never a CDROM DRIVER issue. </s>
<s> When you install the motherboard drivers, the CDROM works. </s>
<s> Same for USB. </s>
<s> Which leaves the soundblaster. </s>
<s> Google is your friend here. </s>
<s> The soundblaster drivers are a bit too easy to find. </s>
