It's pretty simple why this is.
Look at the mess that printers are today.
You find yourself installing drivers for each model.
There is rarely a time you find that the driver for the model 860 works with the 850.
(fictitious numbers) To cure that I would have to put a PC in the middle.
Why isn't the usual all-in-one a solution for you?
