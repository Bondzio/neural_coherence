<s> We have a WEP-secured wireless router, connecting a desktop running Windows XP via a wireless USB adapter (Netgear) and a laptop running Vista also connecting via wireless. </s>
<s> Both systems connected to the internet without difficulty. </s>
<s> Attempted to connect an additional desktop also running Windows XP and tried to connect via wireless USB adapter (Belkin). </s>
<s> Both desktops crashed and now have BSOD and will not re-boot. </s>
<s> Laptop is fine. </s>
<s> Has anyone else had this problem? </s>
<s> Any help regarding possible causes and solutions will be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks much Jmny </s>
<s> I never solved this since it was 'bad drivers' for the wifi USB adapters I had. </s>
<s> Instead we moved to another solution which involved WAPs and BRIDGEs. </s>
<s> In closing, your subject noted a plural adapters while your post noted a single adapter. </s>
<s> My reply is about more than one USB wifi adapter in a PC. </s>
<s> If you could clear up your subject title, that would be nice. </s>

<s> Each of the desktops is using a wireless USB adapter (1 Netgear and 1 Belkin). </s>
<s> Both desktops have ethernet cards but are too far away from router for a cable connection. </s>
<s> Sorry for the confusion. </s>
<s> I did not mean multiple adapters in one PC. </s>
<s> Thanks again for your help. </s>

<s> USB adapters are rough on end users. </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> The machine might have USB issues such as out of date BIOS, motherboard drivers or non-USB2.0 wiring to the front panel. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Workaround for the front panel. </s>
<s> Use the rear USB 2.0 ports. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Bios and drivers? </s>
<s> Update such. </s>
<s> In closing there is a lot of malware out there. </s>
<s> I'm seeing hard failures to the point of a machine not booting after such a device and its drivers installed. </s>
<s> Fix? </s>
<s> Whatever it takes. </s>
<s> There is no do this to recover a hung non-booting Windows (just read these forums for proof.) </s>
<s> What I usually do can't fit in this small space such as system restore, XP REPAIR INSTALL, troubleshooting, safe mode, use of NTPASSWD to remove items and so on. </s>
<s> The method I use just doesn't fit here and would be a book if I were to ever detail it all. </s>
<s> So recover to the point of a working machine with latest BIOS and motherboard drivers first. </s>
<s> Scan the machine with MBAM (google that) and Superantispyware then install. </s>
<s> 99% of the time that's all it takes. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Please give such details as the stop code, any text that tells about a DLL or driver. </s>
