I want to bridge my TP-Link device with the Hawei usb which doesn't supports more than 5 connections at a time. TP-Link router supports Bridge function but I don't know how to do this to expand my network connections. Guide me in performing this function!

However http://www.tp-link.com/en/products/details/?model=TD-W8950ND shows some DSL modem router so that's a second issue. That is I have yet to meet anyone that has turned a DSL modem router into a router. That's 2 big hurdles why this does not work. And on top of that, the EC315 is USB and WiFi so again too many hurdles here. Too many wrong parts. Bob

TP-Link router is not connecting with USB over wifi don't know why when I looked into usb for connected devices it showed connection but but failed to give it an IP address to connect its showing like this in USB IP: 0.0.0.0!

But it's your choice to try anyway.. Your reply above this gave me a slight impression you had it working but here it's not. Maybe it's time to ask those that support you for ideas that are known to work? Bob

Got same ip address 0.0.0.0. But i am hopeful that it is technically possible. A possible solution can be dd-wrt firmware.
