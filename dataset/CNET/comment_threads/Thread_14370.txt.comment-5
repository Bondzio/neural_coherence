As indicated by the Moderators some computers cannot go over 512MB of RAM.
In fact some should not even get up to 512MB.
One of my computers is a 500MHz Win98se that came with 128MB of RAM when purchased new 4 years ago.
Crucial.com indicates the maximum for this computer is 192MB of RAM and that is what I installed...runs good and with a GeForce 2 GTS AGP Video Card, runs most current (but not all) high tech video games pretty good.
Stick with what Crucial suggests for your computer, and even if they indicate a max over 512MB, anything over 512 is a waste (and may cause you problems) unless you do high tech graphics or video editing work.
