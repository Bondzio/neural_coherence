...but for this, you need to have someone see the pc -- small pieces coming off doesn't sound good.
if you have another functioning video card that you could put in the pc, that could determine if its the card or the motherboard.
a used pc/parts store might do a free/cheap diagnosis if you they have a replacement motherboard.
