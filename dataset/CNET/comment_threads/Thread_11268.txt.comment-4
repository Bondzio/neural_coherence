how will you be connecting the monitor to your computer?
- VGA?
- DVI?
- HDMI (via the videocard, if so equpped)?
personally, I would go with the ASUS; in my opinion, better name, better choices for connecting to your computer, happens that a friend of mine has this exact model of monitor-he can't say enough good things about it.
You could always check out the vendors forum sites, see how many complaints there are for each particular monitor, seriousness of the complaints.
