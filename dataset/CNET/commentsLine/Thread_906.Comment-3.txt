well mr. proffitt, i thought i was being very specific when i asked 4 simple questions that all required very simple and basic answers like &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.
unfortunately your diatribe offered no help whatsoever.
rather that waste your time and mine, it may be better in future to either answer the specific questions asked, or not answer at all.
hopefully, someone else can read questions and give proper answers without going off on a tangent.
