thanks for the link, very informative.
more questions i'm afraid.
what is the 90nm figure relating to?
i've not come across it before.
will the memory controller work with my pc2700 ram?
in real terms how much quicker would a 64bit 3000+ be than my xp 2000+ considering that they are running similar clock speeds?
