The final error message says: Windows cannot locate a suitable printer driver.
I followed the directions at: http://buffalo.lithium.com/t5/Solved-Storage-Threads/Need-help-resolving-error-quot-Windows-cannot-locate-a-suitable/m-p/5721 A local printer is installed but I do not get an option to browse for the installed driver.
Note: On Vista, I have passwords disabled for sharing only.
ACcounts all have passwords.
Also, everything on this printer issue is being done on the administrator accounts.
