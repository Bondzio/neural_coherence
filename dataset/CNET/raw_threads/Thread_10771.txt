She switched it on earlier and it went into the normal media scan which scans both the internal memory and the SD card for media files. For some reason, the media scan is not scanning the SD card, and remains at 0%. She left it to run for several hours to see if this would fix the problem and it hasn't helped. We have done the following: 1)

Also, I'd seen that when a video file is corrupt. Be sure to remove all the files from the card and start with a fresh format. Then add half the files. If it works the file it locked up on is on the other half. Bob

Remember I asked about a virus. Not a trojan or malware. To work this issue I still have to clean off the machine and start putting files 1/2 at a time back on the card to see what it didn't like.

Bob, Iunderstand your post on the difference between a virus and trojan/malware but in the example I posted, does not this thing replicate itself? It seems they had this problem before installing that av so your advice is sound. Idon't want to hijack this thread so I won't input anymore on av for Android. Iwill start a new thread soon to discuss av/Android soon. I have to be honest, I am on the fence about av and Android. Thanks for discussing, Dafydd.

My method is to empty the card to a local folder then format the card and see if the Android is OK with that card. OK. Now toss 1/2 the files back on it and re-test. Bob
