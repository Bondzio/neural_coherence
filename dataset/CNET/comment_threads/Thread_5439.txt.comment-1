i think that the ps3 cpu is bullcrap.
i believe that it DOES have 8 cores and uses 7 but rather there is ONE MAIN CORE and 6 others too help it a little.
it has crappy cacshe on its main core(512 kb) i dont know if all the cores put together make 4mb or not but in any case i think core 2 duo 2.6ghz+ is faster than cell.
i think that sony and IBM did this for marketing to make 8 CORES OMG OMG OMG its so powerfull seem true.
wat do u guys think?
?
