looks as if the drive is dead.
ok to use a knife or such to pry the plastic cover off the cd tray (part that comes out when ejecting the cd disc) to get you fingers on it to pull on it and thus get the tray to open manually.
if broken.... the cd drive is getting power to it, right?
ensure it does have power before you attempt this.
does it appear to try to open, but won't?
