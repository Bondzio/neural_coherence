yeah the esata isn't really a big deal for me.
so i should just get it with the 3gb then huh?
im down for that too.
i really wanted this to be available with xp too.
i've heard of way too many glitches and problems with vista.
is there anything else that i need if i wanted to use my 42&quot; hdtv with this machine?
if so what else would i need?
