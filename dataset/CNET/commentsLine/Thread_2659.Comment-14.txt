i've been waiting for someone to realize that the manufacturer of your hard drive is far more important than what version of windows you're running.
at least regarding performance.
it's been my personal experience that the fujitsu's do not perform as well as maxtor and ibm.
i've had no problem with fujitsu when i'm accessing media or data files.
it's just those pesky os files it acts like a dog with.
i think it may have something to do with the way fujitsu stores dll's.
i'm not sure, but i'm going to stick with my maxtor until fujitsu learns to store os files just like data files.
