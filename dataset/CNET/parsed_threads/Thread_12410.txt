<s> I have a brand new Lenovo 3000 C100 laptop with wireless networking hooked up and stuff, but I've been having problems with it. </s>
<s> I can connect to the internet for like five minutes at a time, and then the wireless radio just shuts off by itself. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> will shut down the wireless while running on batteries if there is no activity. </s>
<s> Right click My Computer, click properties, click the hardware tab, click device manager. </s>
<s> Find your wireless card (it'll probably be under network connections). </s>
<s> Right click it, go to properties. </s>
<s> Go to the advanced tab (I'm pretty sure...the one with all the options) and ENABLE CAM (Constantly Awake Mode). </s>
