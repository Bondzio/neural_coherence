1.1.1	Hi I have a very strange problem and cannot work out what is causing it.	St
1.1.2	So I really need some help.	St
1.1.3	We have a wifi network @ our school where 7 wifi access points are via CAT5 cable connected to a 8 port switch and then to a wifi ADSL modem.	St
1.1.4	Every now and then we loose all connections for no reason at all.	St
1.1.5	3to4 times a week.	St
1.1.6	All other times it works perfectly.	St
1.1.7	Each wifi AP has its own fixed IP addr and I have no problem connecting to the AP but the AP cannot ping the Modem.	St
1.1.8	Nor can I ping the modem if I connect directly to the wifi modem.	St
1.1.9	I have to reboot the adsl modem and all the wifi AP from the switch, turn of all AP's and wait for the modem to reboot.	St
1.1.10	Now I have to connect each cable one by one back into the switch and one by one turn the AP back on.	St
1.1.11	Then all is fine again.	St
1.1.12	I have replaced the switch but no difference.	St
1.1.13	PLEASE PLEASE HELP	St
1.2.1	What is the make and model of the modem?	St
1.2.2	This sounds like a periodic failure of the modem.	St
1.2.3	Does it have a built-in router?	St
1.2.4	Have you tried replacing it?	St
1.3.1	It is a TP-link wireless 4 port ADSL modem.	St
1.3.2	Its only 3 month old and is protected by a UPS.	St
1.4.1	Without the model number, I can only guess that it has a router built in since you describe it as having 4 ports.	St
1.4.2	This still sounds like a possible problem with this modem/router.	St
1.4.3	Have you checked for firmware updates for the modem?	St
1.4.4	Are the AP addresses outside of the range of DHCP?	St
1.4.5	Do you get any specific network errors on client PCs?	St
1.4.6	If the network IP addresses are configured properly and firmware is updated with no resolution, you may want to pursue a replacement modem of a different make and model.	St
