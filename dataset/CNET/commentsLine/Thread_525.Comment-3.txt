what do you mean bt &quot;hd ratios&quot; ?
nothing is unacceptable to me.
i was just curious why monitor sizes are expanding in width, and in pixels, for their display but are not equally expanding in height.
why does tv lcd production build new monitors this way rather than expanding the size of monitors both in width and in height ?
is the former perceived as the way end users like to have their monitors, being much wider but maintaining the exact same height ?
it seems much more logical to me that those who enjoy bigger lcd monitors would want both the width and height to expand proportionally, with the pixel resolution also expanding proportionally to fill up the larger display.
i am just curious why this is not happening and the market is seeing wider and wider lcd screens with the exact same height, and wondered if anybody knew why this was so.
