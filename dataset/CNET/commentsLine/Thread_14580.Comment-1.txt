i was at best buy today looking for a new monitor and found the samsung 215tw.
as far as i can tell, this is a new product that should not be on the shelves yet.
it is not yet on the us samsung website (although it is on the canadian site) and i have found only one site that has this as a pre-order.
anyway, the price was good so i bought it and i was wondering if anyone knows anything about this product.
