1.1.1	I just purchased some computer parts and put a computer together.	St
1.1.2	Now I am trying to install windows on it but it keeps restarting whenever the files are being copied ( I have noticed it ususally restarts when trying to copy the file drivers.cab more often than not).	St
1.1.3	Here are some specs: *Intel Pentium D 830 3.0GHz Dual-Core Processor *Intel Socket 775 Cooling Fan *MSI P4M890M-L Via Socket 775 MicroATX Motherboard / Audio / Video / PCI Express / 10/100 Ethernel LAN / USB 2.0 / Serial ATA / RAID *Ultra 1024MB PC3200 DDR 400MHz Memory *XFX GeForce 7600 GS / 256MB GDDR2 / SLI / PCI Express / Dual DVI / HDTV / Video Card *Caviar Special Edition 80GB IDE Hard Drive Any help would be appreciated, thank you for reading.	St
1.2.1	There's some parts missing from your list but I can't tell if you have a SATA drive.	St
1.2.2	That wipes out those that didn't read how to install to SATA.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	If it passes 4-6 hours then, test the HDD with the MFG diags...available on their respective website Let us know what you find VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	I also have *Ultra Black Defender ATX Mid-Tower Case with 350-Watt Power Supply I just switched the powersupply to 400W.	St
1.4.2	Testing it now.	St
1.5.1	I already tried 2 hard drives and an external drive with no avail.	St
1.5.2	(though the external HD just seems to stop the setup and does not restart).	St
1.5.3	Still the ame problem with the new power supply, I have a new error though:	St
1.6.1	http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314474 I wonder if you are using some XP from another machine.	St
1.6.2	An owner reported this to me and they were trying to use their HP supplied CDs on a machine they built themselves.	St
1.6.3	Yup, that doesn't work.	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	Yes, the cd is not from another machine.	St
1.7.2	Also that message doesn't come up, it was due to some pins getting bent on the IDE connector I think, well it's fixed and the thing keeps restarting, I have a feeling it could be the RAM but I have no way of testing it.	St
1.8.1	About that CD and what machine it was.	St
1.8.2	You may have discovered the issue and cause.	St
1.8.3	Bob	St
1.9.1	NIL	St
1.10.1	Did not know you can test your ram and HD without any OS set up.	St
1.10.2	Doing it now.	St
1.10.3	The CD works as my friend formatted his laptop and his computer using it, I have an old cd of Windows ME from my sony desktop and when I run that a gray screen appears saying that the cd is not from this machine.	St
1.10.4	I did the ram test with Memtest86, my first run through it at about 10 min into the session th pc restarted leaving the cd in the machin kept restarting non-stop until I removed the cd.	St
1.10.5	(no errors were found I think it got to about 37%) I am retrying the test again.	St
1.11.1	Well I just got another ram stick and the problem still persists, could it be the CPU or the Motherboard?	St
1.11.2	I am leaning towards the cpu but when I take off the CPU fan and run the PC when it gets hot it shuts down and it does not restart, unlike when I try to boot windows it restarts.	St
1.11.3	Can the motherboard be responsible for the PC to restart.	St
1.11.4	I have also tried installing Linux and I also ran a Windows XP cd that is loaded directly from the cd and does not use the HD and the thing restarts anyway.	St
