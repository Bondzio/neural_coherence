1.1.1	Hi everyone .	St
1.1.2	I have just bought a SONY VAIO NR38M and as soon as I turn the wireless function switch on the front to 'on ' it makes my WRT54GS wireless router restart over and over .	St
1.1.3	It does this every 20 seconds while the wireless is activated ! !	St
1.1.4	I checked my PS3 ( connected via it 's wireless function ) and my old laptop ( that has a Belkin USB wireless adaptor ) to see if they were going to affect my router , but they never did before and still do n't !	St
1.1.5	The baffling thing is , that I bought the vaio 3 days ago and it 's only just started doing it !	St
1.1.6	As soon as I got home and started it up it connected fine , but the past 24 hours it has started to have this effect on the wireless router !	St
1.1.7	I have tried power-cycling , but this had no effect .	St
1.1.8	Please can anyone help ? ! ?	Ques
1.1.9	!	St
1.2.1	setting up your wireless router like the Forum Sticky suggests ?	Ques
1.2.2	Rick	St
1.3.1	We 've seen that .	St
1.3.2	The router firmware was too old .	St
1.3.3	Bob	St
1.4.1	I 've updated my router 's firmware and unfortunately this has made no difference !	St
1.4.2	The laptop/router works fine if I connect using an ethernet cable , so it 's something to do with the vaio 's wireless ! !	St
1.4.3	! ... ... I 'm clueless !	St
1.4.4	!	St
1.5.1	If the firmware did n't cure it , try another make router .	St
1.5.2	For a test , head to a free wifi hot spot .	St
1.5.3	And yes , it has something to do with the Vaio but as you can guess it 's been discussed and no router should crash on such a connection .	St
1.5.4	If the router crashes then you are proving the bug in the router .	St
1.5.5	Bob	St
1.6.1	Well , I 'm pretty sure you 're right with the router bug idea .	St
1.6.2	My neighbour has a different make router ( netgear ) and he 's given me the pass code to access it , and it connects straight away and there are no problems with router !	St
1.6.3	I 'm able to use his wireless perfectly ! !	St
1.6.4	Well , off to the shop I 'll be going for a new router !	St
1.6.5	Think I 'll get a netgear one too as this seems to work ok !	St
1.6.6	Thanks for your help .	Polite
1.7.1	Sorry for the late idea but not all WRT54GS can run OpenWRT but it does solve the problem .	St
1.7.2	http : //www.google.com/search ? hl=en & q=WRT54GS+OPENWRT	Ques
1.8.1	Hi , thanks for the reply .	Polite
1.8.2	Unfortunately , as you said , not all WRT54GS can be used and mine is one of them !	St
1.8.3	As it appears my version ( version 6 ) can not be used !	St
1.8.4	Looks like a new router then !	St
1.8.5	!	St
1.9.1	The routers I installed OpenWrt on are stable , just fade into the closet and never need attention .	St
1.9.2	These are only slightly harder to configure but so far worth the effort if you have to gumption .	St
