With special utilites, under correct conditions, training, the partition tables can be restored. The information on the Recovery Partition contains the orginal install of the system, Operating System, drivers and applications. Format the drive only if you have created or purchased the Recovery Disks. Use HP's recovery method --&gt; On boot pressing ''F12 or F10'' (watch for prompt in upper right corner of splash screen) will take you to HPs Recovery Utility. You will be prompted to perform a Windows Repair or by clicking Advanced a Destructive Restore. Bill

While most of us will replace a lamp or fuze what you are looking at is about the skill level of replacing the head gaskets. I'd read the other responder's reply a few more times. Bob

When i right clicked on C: drive there is an option to format is it safe to do that?

In Windows as system restore? This will only restore Windows kernal files. HP Recovery .... Windows repiar is not the option you want and from your post it appears this is what you did. Re-boot to the HP Recovery. Click on the advanced button, Read All data will be lost and system returned to orginal factory settings (words to that effect). Any other proceedure will render you system usless unless you have the recovery disks. Bill

I originally thought that this was an integrated graphics card problem and was planning to replace it with a PCI-E one. Could anyone tell me how this happened? and how to prevent it in the future? Yes i did try to update the driver. My monitor is a 19&quot; LG Flatron (L1917S). and my graphics card is an intel integrated graphics accelerator. Thanks

Possible that Video Drivers had become corrupted on the orginal install. If it returns the monitor may be going bad. Have yet to own or use the LCD monitors, so this is at best a WAG .... Luck Bill

Problem: I can't find the recovery disk! Can I simply do a format operation and restore the windos default system/settings? Or - should I take it into the shop to have them do this? Maureen

I am planning to restore my computer back to the settings they were before I installed a program. This is no virus or spyware threat but the program messed up some of my settings that I can't restore. I have even uninstalled the program a number of times leaving me with the same results. All I want is to go back to the same settings I had before I installed the program. Will I still have all my files I had on the restore point I have selected before the date? Except the Programs I have installed and files I created will all be deleted after that date of the restore point I have selected. How long will it take, will my computer be stable and usable? Is the HP System Restore Utility found in the Start Menu&gt;Programs&gt;....&gt;System Tools&gt;System Restore application right for me and what I need? Any suggestions and help to my situation? Thanks.

Two links with some info: http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/helpandsupport/learnmore/systemrestore.mspx http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306084 Note that this feature (if enabled, which it is by default) takes a seizable amount of hard disk space in a 'folder' called System Volume Information. You can't see how much it is using the standard tools. To delete everything and start anew (but that means you can't go back before now) turn it off and on again, as described in http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 Hope this helps. Kees
