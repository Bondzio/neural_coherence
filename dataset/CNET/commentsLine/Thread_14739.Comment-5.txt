keep the hds as cs jumpering but the cd drives as master/slave jumpering.
also, because you have 4 power hungary drives, they can tax the limited compaq p/s unit.
even if capable for now, your intermit problem could be related to power as a &quot;flaky operation&quot; is common in such situations of a burdened p/s.
buying a new larger hd to replace the current hds does two immediate things, reduce the power load and provides greater mb(80-120gb) storage and probably of 7200rpm class and just be faster overall(slightly).
an option worth looking into.
