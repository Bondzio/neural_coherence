bought (and returned) a seagate freeagent goflex ultra-portable external hard drive, 500gb, yesterday and tried to use it on a public mac but couldn't because i didn't have the &quot;admin&quot; password to install the required compatibility software (and can't get one).
i need to buy an ext.
storage device that can work with my winxp pc and be written to on this public mac running os x. please suggest a brand and model that will work for this, i am at a loss.
