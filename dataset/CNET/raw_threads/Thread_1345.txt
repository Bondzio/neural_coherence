My system configuration is Phenom IIx4 945 3.0 ghz GA-880GM-UD2H 4 gigs of ram GPU(Integrated) HD4250 Windows7 x32 Since i live in India,i have a budget in my currency that would be equal to around 250-300$. I've been doing a lot of research and found that 6870 is a pretty good deal but then again, the hunger of power never stops,so i checked out 6950 and 6970 but they kind of cross my budget. I also check gtx560 ti and noticed that it is slightly better in performance than 6870 and perhaps on par with the 6950 and 560ti is cheaper than 6950. I'm Pretty confused and can't decide the best deal for myself.So,i seek advice. I use a monitor with a native resolution of 1600x900 and i'd really like it if all the heavy games(crysis,just cause 2) run smoothly at least 40fps. Please feel free to suggest anything you may like. Thanks!

What you could do is to head to tomshardware.com, find the cheapest card on your list and see the test results. You set a SPECIFICATION of 40 FPS and the reviews often show that in games during the test. Seems all you need to do is finish your research. And about POWER. Be sure to see if any mention of the power requirement in Watts or Amperes is noted. A sad thing I encounter a lot is the new upgrader (the person) buys a card but the machine's power supply is too small. Bob

For example someone could have a PC with 20 hard drives on it as well or what else? There are plenty of power supply discussions and estimators out there but I can't answer this question given such details so far. And even if I had all the parts in the system it still comes with a disclaimer about the health of the parts and the ambient temperature. I think you have some research to do. Bob
