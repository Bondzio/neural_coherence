<s> I have a radeon HD 4850 and I thought I'd replace the fan on my card to cool it better today. </s>
<s> So I bought a fan and was going to install it. </s>
<s> I took out my card (with a little difficulty...just tinkered with it a bit but ended up getting it out seemingly fine). </s>
<s> I took off the fan, and decided instead to do it later. </s>
<s> So I put the old fan back on the card, put the card back into my pc and now I can't see anything on my monitor. </s>
<s> I think I put everything in properly, and made sure there wasn't excess dust or anything. </s>
<s> What could possibly be wrong? </s>
<s> Does this mean the PC does appear to boot properly? </s>
<s> You'd know by such as hard disk activity. </s>
<s> Yes lol. </s>
<s> It runs properly. </s>
<s> I just can't see anything on my monitor. </s>
<s> Do you knwo what could be wrong? </s>
<s> if you've not done so already. </s>
<s> As well, I wonder if your PC has on board graphics that have taken over the show. </s>
<s> If you have another video card connection, try that one. </s>
<s> Does the card have an external power source that might not be plugged in or seated properly? </s>
<s> Can you try another monitor as well? </s>
<s> Other than those thoughts, I've no idea unless the card was damaged. </s>
<s> But a missing video card uses causes beeps during post. </s>
