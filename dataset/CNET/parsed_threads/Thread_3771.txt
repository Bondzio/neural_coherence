<s> Hello, I own an HP Deskjet D4200 series printer. </s>
<s> Recently, my input and output trays were broken in a freak accident, and have to be replaced. </s>
<s> I looked at various sites, and couldn't find the parts. </s>
<s> Are they replaceable, and if so, how much does it cost? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Parts like that from HP are usually unavailable as you discovered and you may have to get an entire printer (dead or alive) to scavenge these. </s>
<s> Once in a while you encounter folk that only want the parts they want. </s>
<s> If so you, as the shop keeper get it from ebay, sell it to them for the usual markup of what the entire printer cost then ebay what remains. </s>

<s> Since this is a basic HP printer you're better off just getting a used one from eBay or Craigslist. </s>
<s> You can advertise there your quest or simply check on what's there. </s>
<s> You take your chances. </s>
<s> The other good source is simply googling away for any parts sources, but as this is a simple printer its better getting the whole unit. </s>
<s> Goodwill online may have one or your local Sal. </s>
<s> Army shop. </s>
<s> http://www.shopgoodwill.com If you're lucky other thrift shops may have it too. </s>
<s> The D4XXX series maybe common enough that other models may also work(not sure). </s>
<s> Otherwise, you last attempt at keeping a D4200 is buying new and saving the consumables for your new printer, used as well can do this. </s>
