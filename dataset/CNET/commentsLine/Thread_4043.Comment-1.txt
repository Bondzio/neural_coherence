hi, i have always been a pc user and happy.
although, i am wondering if i should buy a mac.
if i was to, this would probably be my decision for hardware without knowing if this is to much or to little for my needs.
i would use the imac for general web surfing, instant messaging, email, and maybe a few games.
here is the system info that i see best for my needs but would like some feedback if this is about right or if i would be fine with other options for the hard drive size, etc.
i want this imac to hopefully have the hardware that will last for future os upgrades such as leopard.
the imac i am looking at is the 20&quot; one.
processor: 2.33ghz intel core 2 duo memory: 2gb hard drive: 250gb graphics card: ati radeon x1600/256mb vram (i've always chose nvidia for my graphics card for my pc, never had experience with an ati radeon.
are they good for a mac?)
that's really all, besides the applecare plan.
thanks, any input would greatly be appreciated.
robert
