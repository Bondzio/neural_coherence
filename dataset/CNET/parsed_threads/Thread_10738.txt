<s> I've heard a lot about overclocking the processor and the video card for a better performance in contrast to more heat and damage on the long run. </s>
<s> I have an Intel Pentium 4 @ 2.4Ghz and a GeForce FX5500 256mb AGP. </s>
<s> Do you think overclocking in certain 3d games like Dawn of War and the like would provide better performance without conflicts? </s>
<s> If so, how to do that? </s>

<s> OC'ing just isn't as rewarding as it was in the past. </s>
<s> The small gain you get may not be worth it. </s>
<s> You truly have to consider the &quot;whole&quot; system in regards to any OC'ing. </s>
<s> This will be cooling, friendly mtrbd. </s>
<s> setting, solid componets, a &quot;VERY STABLE&quot; psu, and top level cpu, like a P4 vs a Celeron. </s>
<s> Disregard any portion of this and the system becomes unstable or fails too quickly. </s>
<s> Plus, whatever gain you get is far smaller now compared to the olden Pentium days, etc.. if you can't follow tips/hints from the overclockers website(a good website), then leave well enough alone until you're ready, plain and simple. </s>
<s> OC'ing is a gamble and learning experience for 1st timers. </s>
<s> I suggest baby steps until you feel comfortable, don't go hog wild. </s>
