1.1.1	Hey i currently own both cards and was wondering which would be better for games.	St
1.1.2	I understand that both are fairly low end cards but i cannot afford to buy a new one at the moment.	St
1.1.3	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	In the bandwidth area their both close.	St
1.2.2	Perhaps the answer is try both with the games your playing....see if you can tell a difference.	St
1.3.1	I'm sure there are benchmarks and web pages on this but why not give them a workout and choose?	St
1.3.2	Bob	St
1.4.1	Yeah i was just looking for a lazy way around it i guess and the specs on them dont really help one has a faster bandwidth the other has a faster core clock etc	St
1.5.1	To try the web.	Sug
1.5.2	I think tomshardware.com has benchmarks.	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	Tried both cards in my pc and the gt520 gives around a 15% fps boost to the same settings on dawn of war 2, coh and tf2.	St
1.6.2	Just thought id post the results incase someone else is interested or needs to know etc	St
