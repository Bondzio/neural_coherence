Look at the make of the hard disk.
Now head to that maker's web site and get a DRIVE FITNESS TEST.
Also, open the box up with the power off and gently push all the cables into their sockets.
Then boot that drive fitness test CD or diskette to see if the hard disk passes.
Looks like a hardware issue so far.
Good thing everyone here makes a backup.
