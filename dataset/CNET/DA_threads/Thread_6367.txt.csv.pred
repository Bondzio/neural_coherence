1.5.2	Sounds like the old collection of parts is coming home to roost type problem .	St
1.5.3	Look around for testing parts on your other donor machines and check the machine for BAD CAPS as well as re-check your jumpers and IDE cable scheme .	St

1.5.5	In Boston , finding a Cajun Gumbo worthy of that name is rough .	St

1.6.1	You maybe dealing with several problems or actually dealing with the original problem of why the system was given or let go .	St
1.6.2	All this boils down to resolving all issues .	St
1.6.3	If you 're using the Dell OEM install discs , be sure you have what the Dell system was build as from day1 to lessen any hic-ups .	St
1.6.4	Further , due to age you can have a worn out mtrbd .	St
1.6.5	and/or dated one that may not accept whatever mish-mash of devices you have to make a system go 100 % .	St
1.6.6	The files you 're referring to can be a bad read of the install discs , the drive itself or again some device that was n't part of the install when sold .	St
1.6.7	Get the mnaual and review it as well .	St
1.6.8	I use HD wipes to totally remove any past installs and restart from scratch , the OS reload .	St
1.6.9	I visit Dell and enter the model s/n and see how it was build or typical for that model # .	St
1.6.10	Then , if possible similar build to try the install .	St
1.6.11	If the Dell discs are not OEM or for that model Dell , be sure to inspect that side of things .	St
1.6.12	Next , assure the mtrbd .	St
1.6.13	itself has no damage as Robert mentioned , & quot ; bad caps & quot ; as a possible issue .	St
1.6.14	Next , verify the PSU is capable for it to die and not come-ON suggest a weak PSU or mtrbd .	St
1.6.15	Check all that out and get back .	St
1.6.16	Alas , older stuff just bites the dust , prepare to move on .	St
