Please help!
My notebook running XP suddenly lost connection to wifi last week.
I have a feeling it was after I id a quicktune on AVG.
I've googled solutions and tried the ipconfig /allwhich shows media disconnected and 0.0.0.0 but none of the solutions on microsoft or any other site seem to fix it.
I can't evendo a system restore.
Be really grateful if anyone can anyone help?
?
