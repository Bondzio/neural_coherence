1.1.1	A few weeks ago , I picked up a music CD I wanted to rip to my iTunes library .	St
1.1.2	At the time I was not connected to the internet , so the artist/album/song titles were not automatically added .	St
1.1.3	I manually renamed the songs from & quot ; Track 1 & quot ; etc .	St
1.1.4	to their real names , and created a folder with the artist 's name as its title ( all from within iTunes ) .	St
1.1.5	Upon renaming the folder , the entire CD simply disppeared and I have not been able to recover it .	St
1.1.6	Is this an issue with iTunes ' DRM ?	Ques
1.1.7	Does anyone know what really happened ?	Ques
1.2.1	A lot has been said about DRM and it is getting the blame for everything .	St
1.2.2	DRM only applies to music that you download from the Apple iTunes Music store .	St
1.2.3	There is NO DRM on store purchased CD 's By Folder , do you mean playlist ?	Ques
1.2.4	Was it a smart playlist ?	Ques
1.2.5	Music that is ripped into iTunes does not just go away .	St
1.2.6	Take a look at your library and click on the Name column .	St
1.2.7	This sorts all the library by alphabetical name .	St
1.2.8	Be like Santa , check it twice .	St
1.2.9	Even if you delete a playlist , the tracks still stay in the library , even though the & quot ; folder & quot ; is no longer there .	St
1.2.10	If all else fails , rip it again .	St
1.2.11	It does n't take long , and then you will find the duplicates P	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	and these can be ripped into iTunes and burned out as many times as you want to .	St
1.4.2	DRM is applied only to those tracks that are purchased from the iTunes Music Store and the DRM information is coded as part of the track .	St
1.4.3	These tracks have a limited burn potential .	St
1.4.4	I think the limit is 5 but do NOT quote me on that , it could be higher .	St
1.4.5	There are also limits on the number of machines you can copy that file to .	St
1.4.6	Each machine has to be authorized , done locally , so that DRM usage can be controlled .	St
1.4.7	Burning the purchased tracks out to a CD and then ripping back in again , overcomes the limitation .	St
1.4.8	Should you feel the need .	St
1.4.9	This was the way that M $ advocated it 's WMP users use to move iTunes music into WMP .	St
1.4.10	This advice has since been removed from the M $ website , perhaps partly because they realized that translating a track from MP4 to MP3 or worse still WMA , was just asking for poor quality .	St
1.4.11	However , if you are foolish enough to be using WMP on the other side , you will find that M $ feels it necessary to question your honesty when it comes to CD 's that you have legally purchased and ripped into WMP .	St
1.4.12	Transferring these tracks to another PC , or even the same one with a new HD , will prompt WMP to cast doubt on your integrity .	St
