it's still a hard disk.
and to add insult to injury i found i could corrupt many usb hard disks if they were used as supplied.
many come with the somewhat unstable fat32 formatting so just a matter of writing to the drive and pulling the usb cable can have the entire contents vanish.
it's a magic trick i use to show how unstable these devices are when fresh out of the box.
i proceed to the second magic trick of wiping the drive, then making a ntfs partition.
while ntfs is not damage proof it certainly has faired better in my torture tests.
do they tell you this?
(no.)
-&gt; you're right to think that it shouldn't need to be backed up but the truths remain that it's a hard disk and could be the stock fragile fat32 formatting.
good luck in recovery.
