1.1.1	How can i have a smoothly transition from wireless network to Cellular network ?	Ques
1.1.2	The following always happens with any cellular enabled device .	St
1.1.3	- Wireless Device ( Tablet , cell phone , etc . )	St
1.1.4	functions properly on wireless router .	St
1.1.5	- Walk around with it and wireless signal gets weak .	St
1.1.6	- Device slows down and experiences lost network packets .	St
1.1.7	- After moving far enough away from wireless router , device will finally connect to cellular internet ( 3G / 4G ) Problem is extremely bad when I get in my car , because wireless device barely has a signal from the router and I get almost no internet connection .	St
1.1.8	I have to manually turn off Wifi to get the internet working properly .	St
1.2.1	To fix this we 'll have to create an entirely new communication system .	St
1.2.2	As it stands you see how the current systems work .	St
1.2.3	To really fix this we 'll have to have 2 radios or more and an entire rewrite done of how IP works .	St
1.2.4	For now I hope you have your basic grasp of how the IP stack works and we ca n't leave an open TCP/IP connection and move it from one interface to another .	St
1.2.5	And your apps will need a complete overhaul as well .	St
1.2.6	That is , if my app could buffer more than the transition could be less apparent to the user .	St
1.2.7	In fact , that 's how it seems on the Kindle Fire HD if I can mark a video for play later .	St
1.2.8	It 's buffer is huge .	St

1.3.1	An iPad will sit on a wireless router with 1 bar of connection , slow as molasses .	St
1.3.2	Why ca n't it just connect to 4G cellular internet .	St
1.3.3	This is the same for every device .	St
1.3.4	What is the excuse that it does n't even try to connect to an internet that will work better ?	Ques
1.4.1	If you look back at the days before IP networking became the accepted norm , you found all networking was proprietary .	St
1.4.2	You had Microsoft , 3Com , Novell , Sun and about a dozen others so when TCP/IP or Internet Protocal went public it looked to be a front runner and here we are .	St
1.4.3	I ca n't duplicate the history here .	St
1.4.4	So why are we here ?	Ques
1.4.5	Dough , clams , moola , greenbacks , etc .	St
1.4.6	The other reason it ca n't just connect is the code behind it all does n't do that .	St
