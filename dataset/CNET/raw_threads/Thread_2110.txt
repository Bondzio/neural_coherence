That said, it has been years since I built a computer from scratch and even then the machine was not built for any kind of real performance. I have been spending some time searching across the web, evaluating needs vs. wants, setting my budget, picking out parts, etc., and now I fall upon the graces of my online peers for advice. On to the nitty-gritty: Purpose: The machine will be used primarily for Graphic Arts. I work in programs such as Photoshop, Daz3D, Poser, Maya, 3DSMax, Illustrator, etc. The secondary use for the machine (and should probably be called primary) is gaming. Currently I play World of Warcraft, Rift, and Starcraft 2. I also do some work in Visual Studio. Budget: I'd like to keep it around or under $2000. Parts and Purchase: I am starting from scratch, with no preexisting parts and nothing currently purchased. Where I buy from is of little consequence, though to avoid exorbitant shipping costs I would prefer to buy as much from one place as possible. I am fine with online shopping. Peripherals: Not needed. OS: I have a copy of Windows 7 Pro 64-bit, but may be purchasing another Home version, not sure yet. Cooling: I would like to keep the machine as cool as possible but am tepid about liquid cooling, any advise/opinions on this is welcome. All of that said, as I mentioned before I have been looking for parts and have put together a list of what I think will take care of what I need. But, whether they are the best part for my dollar is unknown to me. I do not think I will have any compatibility issues, except perhaps with the SSD (I'm not sure on that one), but if you notice any glaring compatibility issues please note it. What I'd like is for any and all of you to pick my list apart and let me know your thoughts or any problems you see. I am open to switching out any of what I have chosen for a better and/or cheaper product as long as everything stays within my budget and functionality requirements. After researching, these are the parts that I am looking into buying: Case: Cooler Master RC-932-KKN5-GP HAF 932 Advance Full Tower Case - ATX, Black, SuperSpeed USB 3.0 PSU: Ultra U12-40841 X4 Gold Edition Modular Power Supply - 1000W, ATX, 80 Plus Gold, 135mm Fan, SLI Ready, CrossFire Technology, Active PFC, Vibration Dampener Included, Lifetime Warranty w/ Registration Mobo: ASUS P8P67 Deluxe B3 Intel P67 Motherboard - ATX, Socket H2 (LGA 1155), Intel P67 Express, 2200MHz DDR3 (O.C.), Dual Gigabit LAN, 8-CH Audio, SATA 6.0 Gb/s, USB 3.0, SLI/CrossFireX, Bluetooth CPU: Intel Core i7-2600K BX80623I72600K Unlocked Processor - Quad Core, 8MB L3 Cache, 3.40 GHz, Socket H2 (LGA1155), Retail CPU Cooler: Corsair CWCH50-1 Hydro H50 CPU Liquid Cooler - 120mm Fan, Copper Cold Plate, Aluminum Radiator, LGA775, LGA1366, LGA1156, AM2/AM3 RAM: Corsair CML16GX3M4A1600C9 Vengeance LP Desktop Memory Kit - 16GB (4x 4GB), PC3-12800, DDR3-1600MHz, 9-9-9-24 CAS Latency, 240-pin DIMM, 1.5V, Unbuffered, Intel XMP Ready Video: EVGA 01G-P3-1561-AR GeForce GTX 560 Ti Free Performance Boost Video Card - 1GB, GDDR5, PCI-Express 2.0 (x16), Dual DVI, HDMI, DirectX 11, SLI Ready SSD: Corsair Performance 3 Series CSSD-P3256GB2-BRKT 2.5&quot; 256GB SATA III MLC Internal Solid State Drive (SSD)

Please have a look and tell me what you think in comparison: PSU: Ultra X4 1050-Watt Modular Power Supply - 135mm Fan, ATX, Lifetime Warranty w/ Registration, 80+ Silver, NVIDIA SLI &amp; ATI Crossfire Certifications, Vibration Dampener Included Mobo: GIGABYTE Z68X-UD7-B3 Intel Z68 Motherboard - ATX, Socket H2 (LGA1155), Intel Z68 Chipset, 2133MHz DDR3, SATA 6.0 Gb/s, RAID, 7.1-CH Audio, Dual Gigabit LAN, SuperSpeed USB 3.0, CrossFireX/SLI Ready Also, I've left out the Optical drive just because they are easily obtainable and typically are inconsequential to the build itself. However, in case its needed for compatibility and/or PSU load assessments in my build, the one I am looking at is: Optical Drive: LG WH12LS30K 12x Blu-Ray Burner - BD-R, 12x, BD-R DL 12x, BD-RE 2x, BD-RE DL 2x, DVDR 16x, DVDR DL 8x, DVD+RW 8x, DVD-RW 6x, DVD-RAM 12x, CD-R 48x, CD-RW 24x, Internal, SATA, 4MB, LightScribe (OEM) Lastly, all of the product descriptions I have listed are directly off of TigerDirect for any search questions. I'm not too concerned about storage on the SSD. I only need about 100GB locally but wanted to make sure I had enough on there for overhead since I may store files locally for a brief time until transferred to a NAS device. Thanks again!

13316	3	534432	5170041	5169327	Willy	7/20/11 8:50 AM	1.3111518E12	IMO, I'll say...	Copy? of win7, 64-bit isn't going to help you. It may come back to bite you. Get the OEM version(DIY type) and go from there and be done with licensing. If you're going to be pushing the PC, then absolutely go add liquid cooling. While typical air cooling may suffice once you go liquid and it's done right, its a real plus. Unless, you find you really need 16gb of ram, you maybe better off with 8gb. You can hopefully upgrade ram later to 16gb. Even with your s/w demands, 8gb is still very capable, of course that can be addressed if the need arises, that's up to you. Last, use the SSD as a OS install rather than a pgm. tool area of work. SSD have weakness in repeated use of R/W and persistent use of the same data locations can spell bad news later. However, some pgms. install will only default to drive &quot;C&quot;, if you can install elsewhere, do so. I meantion that as thre SSD will get loaded pretty quick if no attention here. This is a known problem(google on topic), but has been addressed. High-end SSD drives that are hi-perf types and/or latest do well. I still recommend a typical HD to do the real grunt work you plan to do. tada -----Willy &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I have a legitimate (MSDN) copy of Windows 7 Pro 64-bit that I have not used, the reason why I lean toward using it is for networking purposes (setting up RDP and the like) that a Home version will not allow you to do. As for mentioning &quot;another&quot; Home copy, I currently have Win7 Home Premium (64-bit) that came on my Alienware M15X laptop that I bought some time ago. Apologies for any confusion on that strand, I merely mentioned the OS so you'd know what I planned to operate on. As for my choice on the 16GB of RAM, that was just a price-point decision. The pricing I am able to get on the 16GB was not much more than what I receive on like-RAM at 8GB. As for storage, I did toy with the thought of a smaller SSD to support only core necessities and using my NAS device for storage, I was thinking on the larger for those &quot;uh oh&quot; scenarios.
13316	5	534432	5170957	5170221	Willy	7/21/11 10:49 AM	1.31124534E12	OK...	To add to the OS side of things, the Alienware one isn't necessasy going to work &quot;if&quot; you plan to use on the new system. While the other OS supplied is OK, I hope it works well for ya. keep any papaerwork in case you have issues later. I also, like to comment on the memory, if that's good, then that's good. I hope it works well for ya. Now for the SSD, as I explained some SSDs won't last long if they get used extensively regrdless of how. The nature of SSD is that repeated usage of the same area will cause a failure or a fault, thought hey are more robust than flash drives, the problem is often seen on these as well. The whole reason for explaining this is that when they go bad, they just go, no clue they're gone. Please google on the topic of SSDs and find this out. Nwer SSD released maybe better at handling these issues since the newer Sandbridge(force?) releases. tada -----Willy

It would be a good fit for that i7 2660k Sandy Bridge. I didn't see anything about memory, but with graphics type stuff such as video editing and such, I would go for the max ( 1600 Mhz ). May be a bit of overkill as I think an 850w Corsair would be fine for that build with ample headroom. I am running the same Video card in here and it is a good one to be sure. As for the Corsaid Hydro H50, if you must go that route, I would consider at least the H70 although there are some very good non liquid cooling solutions out there.
13316	7	534432	5171913	5171823	Doh_1	7/22/11 9:34 PM	1.31137044E12	SSD	Yes, on the SSD, make sure that you get an SSD that supports the TRIM command. You absolutely need wear-leveling firmware to play with an OS like Windows 7 that will issue TRIM commands when needed, like when large blocks of memory are deleted. I have an Intel 160GB SSD, which I find perfectly adequate for a C: drive, I have another regular drive that provides a lot more storage for data, but is slower. However, all my programs run off the SSD, which gives me a very fast boot. I've also turned off the paging and hibernation files, since they take a fairly large piece of SSD, and are not needed if you don't hibernate and have a lot of physical memory (so you'll never swap). I'm very happy with my SSD, the computer boots and shuts down quickly, and programs come up quickly. And given that I'm always running out of physical memory, programs/games/apps run as fast as the cpu and memory speeds will allow. Which is pretty fast these days. Also, pay attention to your backup speed, make sure that you have Firewire, USB3, Thunderbolt, or some fast connection for backup devices, spending a lot of time backing up is not fun. One last thought, spend some time researching graphics/video cards. There's lots of benchmark results on the internet. Given what you want to do, you'll need a good, strong graphics card, so try and get what you'll need first time out. It's very disappointing to find that you have a great system, but your graphics card just isn't up to what you need it to do, and have to go out and do that one over. Only you know what you need your graphics card to be able to do, and what you can get for the money you have for it. On the other hand, getting a graphics card that's bottled-necked by your memory and CPU speeds is just wasting money. So do some research, the facts that you need are out there.

As for the Bottle necking aspect, with 1600 Mhz memory and the i7 2600k CPU, that won't be an issue. That card you have chosen, nor others will be bottle necked. As I previously said, An X68 based board would be a good choice these days.
13316	9	534432	5172621	5169327	Brechan	7/24/11 8:22 AM	1.31149572E12	Why Tiger Direct, and other questions	Why buy from this e-tailer when there are others out there with more competitive prices (e.g. newegg.com); from the list of components you have provided (although some are not available through newegg), there are far better choices/ prices provided by newegg http://www.newegg.com/Index.aspx?name=Home Second; do not scrimp on the PSU, although Ultra may be tigerdirects best (in-house) brand, for the same money you should be spending it on a more reputable company (e.g. Antec, Corsair, Silverstone, and the like). Third; while others may argue that &quot;all-in-one&quot; liquid cooling solutions (such as the Corsair H50/ H70/ H80) are the next best thing to custom water cooling, they are not. These solutions are no better than a &quot;lesser&quot; priced air cooler. Forth; while buying a computer case is strictly a personal choice only you can make, make sure the case you get fulfills all your needs...there's nothing worse than getting into the nitty-gritty of the build, only to find that the case you've chosen is more of a nightmare come true, rather than the dream you were wishing for. Fifth; I have to agree with Willy on the point of having an SSD, the point of having an SSD in your system is to make the O/S and other &quot;key&quot; programs run faster, rather than the &quot;old-school&quot; way of thinking, where the main HDD was for every program under the sun...then using other (internal or external) drives for storage and backup. Best to have a smaller SSD for the O/S and a few programs that are used often; then get another &quot;fast&quot; drive for everything else.
