hello all, my brother has just bought and installed a pc memory stick that gives me around 75gb extra memory.
i have no idea about the internal workings of a pc so he bought and installed the stick for me.
he has told me that the stick has been installed properly.
how can i access that new memory from my pc?
does the stick automatcally create a new disk drive in 'my coputer?'
where can i find the memory stick memory information on windows xp?
how do i save things to the stick instead of the my harddrive?
