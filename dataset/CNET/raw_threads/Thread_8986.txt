The DVD burner is a NEC DVD+/-RW. i read the article about how to install a DVD burner on here and thought i knew what i was doing. But when i restarted my computer it stayed on the Gateway screen for about 3 minutes and then loaded onto XP. then i went into My Computer to see if the drive was listed but it isnt. Then my Direct CD icon in the corner of the screen has a little red cirle around it with a slash that says there isnt any drive.... i put a DVD into the DVD drive to see if windows media player would read it, but it didnt. then i put a cd into my cd-r drive and it didnt even read that. so now my dvd drive and my cd-r drive arent showing up. i might have hooked the dvd burner up incorrectly.... i guess i need a little more help doing it. the article on here is a little to 'smart' for me i guess and i dont think i fully understand somethings. so, can anyway give me more in depth details about how to install it??? thanks!
