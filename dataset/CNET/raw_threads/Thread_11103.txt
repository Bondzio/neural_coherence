7610	0	201103	2157081	NR	R mcdaniel	8/25/06 6:27 AM	1.15648722E12	Wireless Networking Books	Can anyone recommend a concise, easy-to-read and understand book on home wireless networking. I plan to puchase a Dell XPS 410 in the future with Vista Premium Media and want to keep my Dimension 4300 and network the two. Any help is appreciated.

Just the supplied setup documents or a little trip to linksys.com or dlink.com has all the info I need. Most common reason it didn't work besides the instructions? Firewalls. Hope this saves you a buck or two. Bob
