I have bought a Seagate &quot;GO&quot; external portable hardrive. (640GB)I also have bought Cakewalk Music Creator 5, with the intentions of installing it to the external hardrive. Every time I try though, it tells me there is not enough space, despite the fact that I am installing it to a 640 GB external drive. I have no idea what to do. I am running Windows XP and both the drive and the program meet the computer's system requirements. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
