thanks good suggestions, especially the graphics comparisons.
i already have vista business ready to go, except that m-audio and much of the recording hardware is still behind the curve, so it will have to be xp for a while longer.
64 bit even later.
i have a new case / ps and wireless kb/mouse etc.
core duo makes sense as i'm already sold on multi-processors anyway.
