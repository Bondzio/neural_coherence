<s> I've been reading up about external hard drives since I plan on purchasing one for my laptop. </s>
<s> But for every good drive I hear about, there are 3 bad reviews of it. </s>
<s> It also seems that reviewers like Cnet give a good review, while the user reviews are completely different (poor). </s>
<s> Basically, which drive would you guys recommend as a reliable drive. </s>
<s> P.S. </s>
<s> I'm looking for a 250GB drive. </s>
<s> Thanks, Duckhunter </s>
<s> For me, I just buy an external USB case and then a drive to put in it. </s>
<s> I'm unsure what I'm missing by paying for them to put the two parts together. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I hear some of the USB cases have heating issues. </s>
<s> Has this ever been a problem for you? </s>
<s> I haven't seen this issue. </s>
<s> The larger case I use is for a 5.25 drive (can house CD/DVD/RW drives) and has a fan. </s>
<s> The smaller unit has slabs of aluminum that do get warm but nothing moreso that a drive in a desktop. </s>
<s> My answer is... no. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thank you for your help. </s>
<s> I'll look into getting a case and drive separatley. </s>
<s> I use a 60GB drive in a Belkin enclosure. </s>
<s> It has a fan and heat has never been an issue. </s>
<s> I like Seagate drives the best and find their recent switch to a 5 year warranty a good sign. </s>
<s> Recently Amazon had a 160GB Seagate external drive for $119.00 after rebate. </s>
<s> The drive stood upright taking far less desk space than my current drive. </s>
<s> I plan to watch for this offer and use it next time I see it. </s>
<s> Every Seagate drive I buy has a $50 rebate and they process and get you your money in a timely manner every time. </s>
<s> I have three seagate drives on the shelf. </s>
<s> They will provide additional space or replacements in our five desktops. </s>
<s> Hi Duckhunter, I can't tell you which external hard drive to buy, but I have a different caution. </s>
<s> If you are buying a USB 2 drive, make sure your computer has USB 2 ports. </s>
<s> If it doesn't you can add a PCI card with USB ports for a modest price, but then you have the issue of whether your OS can see a USB 2 device. </s>
<s> If it can, the third caustion applies only if you like to make images of partitions or drives from DOS. </s>
<s> Some imaging programs (Acronis True Image, Norton Ghost) can see a USB 2 drive while operating in DOS, but some others can't. </s>
<s> Good luck, Dan S </s>
<s> Thanks for the advice. </s>
<s> My computer has USB 2.0 ports so that is not a problem. </s>
<s> I plan on using the drive as drag and drop drive, but thanks for the warning about using imaging programs. </s>
<s> If you read this today 11-27 is still possible to order Norton Systemworks 2005 Premier for free after rebates. </s>
<s> (although at the moment they have the wrong rebate form posted). </s>
<s> In Includes Norton Ghost. </s>
<s> Norton acquired the Drive Image product, so it should be a good program which can backup under Windows. </s>
<s> The One Touch drives are very quiet. </s>
<s> Hopefully the new ver. </s>
<s> II drives are faster. </s>
<s> LaCie drives sound very good. </s>
<s> They apparently have no fans. </s>
<s> Tigerdirect has a very inxpensive enclosure. </s>
<s> Microcenter was selling Maxtor 250 GB for $119. </s>
