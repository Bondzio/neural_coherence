<s> I have a total of four Maxtor hard drives (all are Ultra DMA 133) that I am trying to decide which one to use as my main drive. </s>
<s> The others will be used as storage drives. </s>
<s> My main uses of the computer are web browsing, games and video editing. </s>
<s> I have an MSI K8N Neo2 Platinum mainboard, Athlon 64 3500 cpu, 1 GB memory and am using a BFG 6800 GT video card (nVidia). </s>
<s> All of this is running Windows XP. </s>
<s> My four choices (actually only three since one drive is a Maxtor External, 300 GB Firewire/USB drive)are: - 80 GB Maxtor D740X (Model 6L080J4) 2 MB cache, 7200 rpm, &lt; 8ms seek time - 160 GB Maxtor DiamondMax Plus 9 (6Y160P0) 8 MB cache, 7200 rpm, 9.3 ms seek time - 250 GB Maxtor Maxline Plus II (7Y250P0) 8 MB cache, 7200 rpm, 9 ms seek time Any opinions are welcome! </s>
<s> I would use the 250 GB as your main drive due to the large volume requirements needed for games & video editing. </s>
<s> My preference is to use the smaller drive for the OS and applications. </s>
<s> 80gigs will hold a ton of these. </s>
<s> Your 80gig shows quicker specs but I am not certain that is correct with a 2meg cache, however. </s>
<s> You do want your main drive to perform well. </s>
<s> The larger drives are well suited for storage and can be used as backups for other data. </s>
<s> I have mine done this way and use imaging software to backup my entire hard drive as a compressed image on larger secondary drives as part of my distaster recovery scheme. </s>
<s> In the end, however, your opinion and needs outweigh all outside advice. </s>
<s> Good luck with your project. </s>
<s> Can you recommend any software benchmark programs that are available to actually test these and get real test info? </s>
<s> I don't use them. </s>
<s> A bullet at 2500fps and one at 2550fps are both faster than my eyes can blink. </s>
<s> I believe some use one called SiSandra which may have a free version. </s>
<s> I will let you do the Google search. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
