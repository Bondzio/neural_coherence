i have western digital external hard drive that is compatible with both pc and mac.
it was working fine with both and now it does not work with pc.
when i connect it with mac, i am able to view all the files and can copy, edit, etc.
however, when i connect it with a pc, i can see the drive but i cannot see the content in the drive.
what could be the problem with it?
could i have deleted some of the files?
is there any way i can do to fix this problem?
thanks
