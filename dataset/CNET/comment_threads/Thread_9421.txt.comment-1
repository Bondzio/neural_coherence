I have a 2003 Small Business Server.
Just last week I had 37G total, 19G free.
A few days ago, I had 403 M free.
When I check the disk usage total it shows the builtin/administrators account using 35G, but I can't figure out what processes could be using it.
The shadow copy service had been running, and that was using 3G, once I disabled it I got it back, but the next day my storage was used up again.
Any ideas?
