what does such a shortcut link to (have a look in its properties)?
what happens if you doubleclick it?
i'm rather sure that windows won't run if all program files were converted to .lnk files.
explorer.exe for example is a rather essential program to run and it seems you still have your desktop, so explorer.exe must be running.
so maybe it's just a subset that you changed by accident?
so tell more.
