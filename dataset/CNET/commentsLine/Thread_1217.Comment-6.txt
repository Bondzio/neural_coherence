is when you put the drive internally on the machine is that the os boots up and you see that drive in the bios.
i can't tell where you missed a setting because the details are not here.
if it's the usual ide drive i suggest we unplug the cd/dvd drives and use that cable.
i'll stop here and not write how to jumper drives, what cable types, etc... bob
