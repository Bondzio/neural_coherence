You do not buy a cable modem, you let your connection provider supply it and connect your router to that.
You need to set fixed IP's on the 2 desktops and the laptop and see if you can Ping the IP of the other systems while connected.
If you can ping then you can get the internet working, file sharing will also be possible.
When you connect up to the router select START/RUN type CMD and hit enter or OK. Then type IPCONFIG On each system.
What IP does it show your network card using on each system?
You should get a different IP for each system, in the 192.168.x.x range.
If you don't get that then the router is not handing out addresses.
You can hard code the address by going to TCP/IP properties for the network connection and specifying the IP.
Once you do that you can then ping the IP of the other system to see if you can see it on the network.
