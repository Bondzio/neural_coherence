I was hoping somebody could give me any kind of insight or solution to this.
I bought my original emachine in May, 2 weeks later it starts freezing up not matter when.
So I take it in and 2 more weeks later they tell me my motherboard is bad and need to replace and because its still rather new they were having trouble getting a serial number for it.
So they opted to exchange mine for the floor model they had there.
Well everything was fine until about a week after I had it, it started freezing up , not as bad as the first machine but the fact that it does is annoying.
so any help on the situation would be greatly appreciated.
