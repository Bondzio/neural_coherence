Long Beach ball times, Apps locking up	Bought mac mini- I have had nothing but problems but I will tell you I am new to Mac. The apple store is even perplexed as I cant reproduce the problem. It is radom and sporadic but frequent. The basic issue is that i am having long wait times with the beach ball going and going. Apps stop responding. It happens randomly and appears (although not sure) to be related to connectivity or email or both. Using macmail. I have taken my router out of the equation but if we even assume that i have internet issues (cable) would this behavior be normal? Shouldnt i just receive a cannot connect error? Running Tiger and Apple did an 'archive and reinstall'. Took it home and same issue.
