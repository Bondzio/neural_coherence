Go with a company called Bunnie Computers.
I have their Hare performance pro, and I am in to the same thing converting to DVD.
Bunnie Computers has the New Pentium 4 Prescott that neither Dell, IBM, or Sony Has yet to offer.
This difference is; Dell (512kb L2 Cache) Bunnie (1MB) L2 Cache.
You do the math :o) Plus it glows
