The last server has similar specs (but only 2BG ram) as this new machine I'm planning.
It works great with about 30 domains on it.
However, there isn't any chat app, or sustained neck-breaking traffic like I expect for the new machine.
If anybody has an experience with a high-traffic website comparable to my pending website, I would like to know what hardware is used there.
