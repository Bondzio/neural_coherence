<s> I've been looking for a new computer for quite some time now but I can't quite decide on the company I should go with. </s>
<s> I know many of you are saying just build your own computer but I know nothing about building a PC. </s>
<s> Also, I've just recently moved into the area I live in and haven't heard very satisfying reviews from the local PC shops. </s>
<s> I like to game but I also do other things on the side such as recording music and work. </s>
<s> I narrowed my choices down to an Alienware Area-51 and the XPS Gen-4. </s>
<s> I've searched the net and cnet about Alienware reviews and their shipping and customer services make doubts in my mind. </s>
<s> People say Dell is also equally bad in customer services and they use cheap parts in their computers. </s>
<s> From another forum I've read that Alienware however uses top of the line parts... </s>
<s> Customer services is a big factor nowadays and with the big companies expanding and using cheap labor, it's going to be an even bigger problem in the future. </s>
<s> Any suggestions what which of the two I should buy or any other pre-made computers I should look at? </s>
<s> Your help is very appreciated. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Read http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7587-0.html?forumID=69&threadID=60674&messageID=719564 You really need to think over if it's worth dealing with this company. </s>
<s> As to Dell's service, it's been fine on the hardware end. </s>
<s> However many today don't understand that support may not be there to help with SPYWARE induced issues. </s>
<s> If you need software support, almost no company is doing this. </s>
