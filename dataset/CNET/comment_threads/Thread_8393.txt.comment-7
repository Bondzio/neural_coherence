These are all items I see in Zone Alarm, under the Firewall heading, in the Zones tab.
And, yes, Zone alarm has since been uninstalled from the main desktop.
That is the PC on which I had changed the installation of the program and which is physically connected to the Linksys AP\Router.
One other Desktop on the network is physically connected via ethernet cable to the router.
The other two are notebooks and they are networked via WiFi wireless.
On main desktop is only one entry, as follows: Name: Realtek RTL 8139 Family PCI Fast Ethernet NIC - packet scheduler miniport IP Address/Site: 192.168.1.100/255.255.0 Entry Type: Adapter Subnet Zone: Internet ----------------------------------- On the other Desktop are two entries: Name: SMC1211 Series NDIS 5.1 Driver IP Address/Site: 192.168.1.108/255.255.0 Entry Type: Adapter Subnet Zone: Trusted Name: PPP Adapter IP Address/Site: 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 Entry Type: Adapter Subnet Zone: Trusted ---------------------------------- On Notebook 1, two entries: Name: Instant Wireless Network PC Card V3.0 IP Address/Site: 192.168.1.106/255.255.0 Entry Type: Adapter Subnet Zone: Trusted Name: PPP Adapter IP Address/Site: 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 Entry Type: Adapter Subnet Zone: Trusted ---------------------------------- On Notebook 2, two entries Name: Broadcom 440x 10/100 Integrated Controller - Packet Scheduler Miniport IP Address/Site: 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 Entry Type: Adapter Subnet Zone: Internet Name: WLAN 802.11g Network Adapter - Packet Scheduler Miniport IP Address/Site: 192.168.1.102/255.255.0 Entry Type: Adapter Subnet Zone: Trusted Thanks, Rag
