hey all, i am going to purchase this machine very soon, waiting on tax refund i understand it come with 512mb ddr400/pc3200 dimm (2x256mb sticks) and it has 4 memory slots total.
so i want to leave the 2-256 modules in place and add 2-512mb ddr333/pc2700 dimm modules.
i want to use the pc2700 or ddr333 (i bielve these are the same) because i have one 512mb ddr333/pc2700 dimm already and then i would only need to purchase 1 more, since you have to have memory modules installed in pairs, i understand.
i have read on the motherboards website it accepts ddr333/pc2700 by the way.
you will notice i am trying to run different clock frequency memory modules simultanously.
do you think there would be much conflict?
in my experience it would not be a problem as the ddr400/pc3200 should clock to the lower demoninator, which would be the 512mb ddr333/pc2700 dimm.
lastly about memory.
it's not an issue that all the modules are not of the same capacity is it?
like i don't need all 512's or all 256's or all 1gb modules, right?
it never has been for any other pc i have had but want to make sure.
thanks for reading this far by the way!
that would give me 1.5gb memory running @ 333mhz.
i don't honestly think the frequency difference from 333mhz to 400mhz is going to be noticable.
do you?
i will also add a x700 pro pci-e video card.
which will free up the 128mb shared memory and rock my gaming world, i believe lol.
i am unsure about a sound card.
i will most likely hook it up as is and decide from there, it's not that important to me.
i see best buy has a 19&quot; crt flat screen monitor in their ad this week for $129.99 then $30 rebate for $99.99 + tax.
it's their own brand name (insignia).
i have read, so prolly only average performance but still 19&quot;!!
i will add this also :)- thanks very much for reading and responding :p
