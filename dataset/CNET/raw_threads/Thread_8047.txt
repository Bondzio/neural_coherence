I need some drivers to keep on my flash drive, can anyone help out? http://www.emachines.com/support/drivers.html Desktop &gt; ET Series &gt; ET1331G Those drivers only work on 7, so can anyone help me out?

It's getting harder and going to get worse. Read another reason why at http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8557144.stm Again, good luck in your XP 64 bit driver hunt. XP 32 bit drivers were not as hard but the version of XP (64) you are looking for means that it is almost assured most drivers will be never found. Bob

I'm all up for dual-booting XP and 7, I already know how to do that. I'll just need to acquire the right drivers, and then the rest will most likely be easy as pie.

Read http://www.sevenforums.com/virtualization/32942-i-got-xp-mode-display-24-bit-color-integration.html There may be someone that found a way to 32 bit color but it will take time for everyone to catch up and figure out all the tricks.

I have gotten the drivers before from talking to Emachine web tech support, i had to talk to 4 different people but i did get a copy of the drivers needed for xp on my machine ( et1331G-o5w) so they are out there just might have to talk to few different tech support people or go on a good search.
