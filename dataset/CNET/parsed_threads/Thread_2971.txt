<s> I have an old Dell desktop (XPS T500, Pentium 3 500MHz, 384 memory) that I would like to do some video work with (edit family vacation videos, etc). </s>
<s> My system came with a DVD player (not a burner), and I have added a CD burner to an available bay. </s>
<s> I wanted to get one of the newer dual layer lightscribe burners, like the one from HP, but it appears that the system requirements call for a minimum of 800 MHz processor. </s>
<s> Will it still work, albeit a little slower than desired, or will it not work at all? </s>
<s> I am running Windows XP on the system if that is an issue...any suggestions? </s>
<s> work, but it will be pretty slow since Drive Burning may take charge of alot of the CPU's power.... </s>
<s> I think it should work, but it might lock up, very slow, etc. </s>
<s> It may, but would be slower than you'd like. </s>
<s> You could try it, and if its too slow you could return it. </s>
<s> Save up you $$$$ and get a new PC. </s>
<s> Up grades to PC this old would be a waste of money. </s>
<s> Yes, you can edit video it may take overnight to do the rendering. </s>
<s> Burning a DVDs, well the only this you can do is try. </s>
