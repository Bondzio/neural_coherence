<s> will a antec 400 watt power supply be enough for my pc? </s>
<s> Im running a AMD 3200, 1gig ddr dualchannel ram, 2 raid serial ata 100gb Hd's, 2 GeForce 7800GTX GDDR3 SLI video cards. </s>
<s> Go here: http://www.slizone.com/object/slizone2_build.html Scroll down to SLI certified power supplies. </s>
<s> They are all over 500W. </s>
<s> I like Antec, but your system appears to really be pushing what can safety operate of that 400W. </s>
<s> The high wattage rating that any psu can supply can only sustain for a given time and continue to output such levels and the highest level is very short duration. </s>
<s> Thus, I recommend to look into at least 450W or better and 500W+ is truly worth the cost. </s>
<s> Those dual SLI cards are what is crushing the system psu, so think if the psu goes what else goes with it. </s>
<s> You got too much invested and installed, get a higher wattage psu, its the basis of a stable system more than you think. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Jeez, no. </s>
<s> Those 7800GTX's are monsters. </s>
<s> Especially in SLI. </s>
<s> Get a wattage of at least 650 watts, more if you can. </s>
<s> And don't get an unknown brand, like Nefarion Cooling Solutions. </s>
<s> Antect, Thermaltake and PC Power and Cooling. </s>
