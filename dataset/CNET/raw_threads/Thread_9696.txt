I just want to know what kind of power supply would be needed to support a system with something like: intel i7 920, ati radeon hd 5850 graphics. It seems to me like those are the major players in deciding a power supply. thanks.

That said there's no shortage of good PSUs made by companies like .... Corsair, Seasonic, PCPower and Cooling, etc., and having more watts and AMPs than required versus less than required is the better choice. Here's some possibilities between 600 and 700W. http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=2010090058%20113142557&bop=And&ActiveSearchResult=True&Order=RATING More questions .... we'll be here.
