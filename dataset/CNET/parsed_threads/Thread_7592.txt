<s> Let me detail the problem a bit further... My computer has been suffering from an ongoing 'random blue screen' problem. </s>
<s> When too many applications are running it'll just show a blue screen and I'll have to restart. </s>
<s> These are the hardware solutions I've tried so far: replacing graphics-card/motherboard/processor installing new case/heatsink fans reformatted hard-drive I was told that it was unlikely to be the ram so only yesterday did I try using only one of the 2*256 sdram sticks that I have. </s>
<s> I left the computer on for the whole night with just the one stick of ram and it worked absolutely fine with no problems. </s>
<s> I assumed that the other stick of ram was causing the problem (since it worked fine without it), but I've been running the computer with no problems today with what I believed was the dodgy ram! </s>
<s> I've been monitoring things vigorously and it now appears the computer only works error-free when running with a free ram slot. </s>
<s> Can anyone shed any light on this at all? </s>
<s> I'm very confused! </s>
<s> There are a number of motherboards that do that. </s>
<s> It can also be a power supply issue. </s>
<s> The suspect list is ... 1. </s>

<s> Robert's advice maybe just the ticket to follow. </s>
<s> I only suggest, if you haven't already to clean the ram slots themselves, use an old toothbrush(alcohol damp) and brush down, allow to dry and then try again. </s>
<s> If you're using non-similar brand ram, they are incompatible if only slightly, its not suppose to be a problem, but it can happen, try using a &quot;match pair&quot; even if only 128mb each to test. </s>
<s> Since, you didn't mention the OS, if win9x/Me 512mb is a known problem with that much ram installed, check here for cures: http://www.aumha.org find related topic. </s>

<s> Since my last post, I'm now using both sticks of ram, and I'm not getting any problems. </s>
<s> The problem had been persistent for over a month and now I'm having a stretch of close to 2 days with no troubles since I've been fiddling with the ram. </s>
<s> I think by reseating them, I might have indirectly cleaned them? </s>
<s> Minor oxidation can happen and repeated seating can break into a new contact(rescratch) surface. </s>
<s> However, if that is the problem it will come back, use a cleaner for electrical contacts found at local Radio Smack for a better cleaning. </s>

<s> the problem's not cropped up again, so I'm hoping it's sorted now... </s>
<s> I'll be sure to have some proper cleaner ready for next time tho </s>
