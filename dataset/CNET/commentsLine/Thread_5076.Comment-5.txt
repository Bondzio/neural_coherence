my os is win xp pro with sp3.
i have a sata disk 160 gb already where win xp is installed.
i was installing an additional hard disk with a higer capacity for data and back up.
according to the seagate site, their seatools will not detect a hard disk if it is not recognized by the bios (mine does) or the drive does not spin up.
fortunately i made my purchase from a neighborhood dealer.
he has promised to replace the disk immediately.
a slightly higher price is worth it.
thank you all.
