<s> you'll most likely be able to put in any mobo with a microATX form factor. </s>

<s> Your new M/B can be purchased with the features you want. </s>
<s> If you wish to use the existing memory and CPU the board must support them. </s>
<s> You must also match the size of the purchased M/B to the case size. </s>
<s> Make sure that the port plate is changable. </s>
<s> The Power Supply may also have to be changed. </s>
<s> Couple of post floating around on new builds, you may want to check them out. </s>

<s> sorry if i confused you with the abbrev. </s>
<s> before you get a motherboard, you need to make sure it will fit in your case (unless you're willing to get a new case) and your power supply can work with it (unless you're willing to get a new power supply). </s>
<s> the easiest way to determine that is to get the size and type of your current motherboard and/or your current pc's model number. </s>
<s> i don't want to recommend something that may not work for your setup. </s>
