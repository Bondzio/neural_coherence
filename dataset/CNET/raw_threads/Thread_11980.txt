I live in the middle of nowhere which makes highspeed out of the question, so I am stuck with dial up until they load highspeed in my area,and satelitte is out of my budget, so I was wondering if there is a device that I can buy to speed up my speed. I am desperate at this point.

Something that might help a little is a HOST file. It won't help your download speed but it might block some of those big ADS/GRAPHICS which will make some web pages load a little quicker. look here. http://www.mvps.org/winhelp2002/hosts.htm
