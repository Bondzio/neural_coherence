<s> I have an iMac that all of a sudden will not maintain its connection to my wireless network. </s>
<s> I have a Linksys WRT54G with latest firmware 1.02.2. </s>
<s> I'm using DHCP and MAC address filtering for security. </s>
<s> If I put my Thinkpad next to the iMac, I can get onto the network no problem. </s>
<s> But the iMac won't even recognize the network let alone allow me to connect. </s>
<s> I if unplug and power up the router, the iMac will reconnect to the network for an unpredictable amount of time and then lose the connection again. </s>
<s> But the Thinkpad maintains the network conenction even when the iMac disconnects. </s>
<s> Any ideas would be appreciated. </s>
