hi, i've bought a new pc, and it only recognises some of the dvd's i put in the drive.
i have burnt loads of back up dvd's off my laptop, howver lately when i pop them in the drive, the &quot;autoplay&quot; feature asks if i want to burn anything to them saying &quot;it's a blank dvd disk&quot;.. ..i put the dvd back into my laptop and it shows the files on the dvd no problem.
am i going to have send it back?
