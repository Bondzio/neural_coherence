<s> im going to buy a new LCD Flat Panel monitor but wasnt sure about the sizes. </s>
<s> I was under the impression that the size (example 17&quot;) is different from the viewing size....is this correct?....my current CRT monitor is a 17&quot; and id like one the same or roughly the same size. </s>
<s> id really appreciate anyone helping me out with this! </s>
<s> thanks alot guys! </s>

<s> Lcd and it went south after 3years of hard use. </s>
<s> But it was about the same viewing size as this 17&quot; crt. </s>
<s> So if youi get a 17&quot; lcd youi will seem to have more screen, as well as less eye strain. </s>
<s> Your 17&quot; CRT is probably 16&quot; (diagonal measurement) in reality. </s>
<s> A 17&quot; LCD will be just that...17&quot; diagonal. </s>
<s> There are some with slightly different aspect ratios out there that dont follow the normal 4X3 convention. </s>
<s> You can tell this by their published &quot;native resolution&quot; by doing a little math. </s>
<s> This just changes the relative width and highth of the images. </s>
<s> Also, the native resolution will be the only one that gives the monitors best image. </s>
<s> The resolution you like best on your current monitor might not be the optimum for a CRT of equivant size. </s>
<s> This may mean you accept some image degradation or go with the native resolution and get used to a change in icon and page sizes. </s>
<s> thanks guys! </s>
<s> thats helped alot....i think i know what i want now....thanks again frank </s>
<s> CRT's are measured from one top corner to the opposing bottom corner of the picture tube in a diagonal fashion. </s>
<s> You often hear the term &quot;viewable size&quot; and this refers to the amount of the tube not covered by the shroud or bezzel. </s>
<s> LCD screens are what you see is what you get though I think they are still measured from top corner to opposing bottom corner. </s>
<s> At any rate a 17&quot; LCD will usually have a larger screen than a CRT simply because none of the LCD screen will be covered by a shroud or bezzel. </s>
<s> One interesting thing I've noticed is that even though an LCD has a bigger screen it looks like it is smaller simply because of the smaller footprint of the monitor. </s>
<s> It sort of fools the brain because of the small package that contains the big screen. </s>
<s> We're all used to seeing 20&quot; deep and wide monitors and now they are only a few inches deep. </s>
