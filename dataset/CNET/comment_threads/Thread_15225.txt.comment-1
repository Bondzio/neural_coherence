I have intel 850GB motherboard and 128 RDRAM with 20GB seagate harddisk running win XP Pro earlier it was win 2000 pro ,my problem is that my computer stops working after few minutes of running and when i switch off and start again sometime it works fine and work for long hours or sometimes just boot and reboot , so guys kinly let me know what exactly problem is ?
is that due to low RAM , i not get RDRAM at reasonable price so i stick with that,or due to overheating , ihave two fans one for cpu and other for agp card .
kindly help
