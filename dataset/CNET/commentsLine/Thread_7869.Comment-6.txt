i must ask again if broadband is in the works.
with high speed internet this setup becomes almost automatic.
in any event, the settings i speak of are in the routers setup program.
you access that program by typing 192.168.1.1 in your web browsers address bar.
once in, you type admin into the password box, hit enter and you ahould be in the routers setup page.
referring to the manual on page 29 you will see the settings from gateway to router.
page 23 shows where to disable dhcp and page 25 shows where network address settings are disabled.
don't forget to save your settings after each change.
once this is done, your router should now be acting as a wireless access point with a built in switch.
you can run the internet connection wizard on the pc that has the dialup modem and configure it as the server of the dialup connection.
with any luck both pcs will be able to connect to the internet when the pc hosting the dialup connection is active.
