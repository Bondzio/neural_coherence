but if you remove the motherboard from the case (to avoid shorting out the backside in the case), add cpu/heatsinkfan, plus a speaker, with just that and a power supply (no memory, video, etc.)
you'll get beeps of protest unless the bios battery is dead, the reset jumper is on wrong, the cmos clear jumper is set to clear... if not you are staring at the four possible bad parts.
bad can mean wrongly jumpered too.
