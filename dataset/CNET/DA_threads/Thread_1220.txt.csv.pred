1.1.1	Hi , Im looking to turn my old desktop pc into a dvr to record some TV shows and watch them through my TV I hate to miss .	St
1.1.2	The problem is that Im a poor collage student so I dont have the mega-bucks to spend on the project .	St
1.1.3	Im torn between the Hauppauge wintv-150 and the ati TV wonder elite .	St
1.1.4	I know that the ati card has a better picture than the 150 but I dont think my pc can handle it .	St
1.1.5	The newest OS I have to run on this machine is Windows 2000 pro .	St
1.1.6	My machine has a 1 GHz pIII processor and as much ram as I can put in it .	St
1.1.7	Bottom line I just dont wont to waste money on something with poor resolution .	St
1.1.8	I also welcome alternatives	St
1.2.1	so your CPU is n't an issue .	St
1.2.2	the ati may have better video processing ( slightly sharper image especially in still frames ) , but both will have the same resolution .	St
1.2.3	i think you 'll be satisfied with the winTV .	St
1.3.1	... particularly on the PVR software .	St
1.3.2	I believe 1.6GHz is the normal cutoff point for MPEG-2 recording , so your box will probably only be capable of encoding in MPEG-1 , which leaves a little to be desired in terms of resolution quality .	St
