in order to play full 1080p hg video smoothly you need more video/graphics memory.
some new computers accomplish this by having the modest integrated graphics chip get extra needed memory by sharing the computer's system ram memory.
the minimum for decent hd playback is 512mb of video/graphics memory, but i recommend having more if possible.
we were in the same situation as you recently with my girlfriend's computer.
we solved it by adding a plug-in graphics.
i found an msi brand radeon hd4550 card with 1gb of its own video/graphics memory.
you can probably manage just fine with the next lower model called hd4350 with 512mb video memory or an nvidia gt210 model.
these cards are come with hdmi output jack and they're available online for $19.99 to $39.99 after a mail-in rebate (and remember no tax and sometimes free shipping).
check tigerdirect.com and newegg.com for availability.
