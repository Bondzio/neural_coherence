<s> Hi there. </s>
<s> Having an issue with my com and USB ports. </s>
<s> Trying to attach a microcontroller to my computer so that I can program it in AVR CodeVision, however every time I attempt to do so I get an error message telling me that com 2 is not available and that's what the program wants to use. </s>
<s> The USB to serial cable can be plugged into com ports 3 through 5 and has never been plugged into com 2. </s>
<s> I'm attempting to change the com port settings, however it doesn't seem to be available in the Device Manager. </s>
<s> Is it possible to change a com port coding conventions or to modify the program so that it can accept a different com port? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> And I use USB to serial dongles by the dozens. </s>
<s> Not one plugs into a com port but creates a com port when I plug the device into some USB port. </s>
<s> I've programmed and written code for AVR in the past but do not have your dev kit. </s>
<s> It may be time to avail yourself of AVR's support. </s>
