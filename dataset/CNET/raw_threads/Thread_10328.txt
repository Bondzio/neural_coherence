Things like playing Xbox games on PC or putting a mini lcd monitor in the drive bay or whatever. Whatever you guys can think of. Thanks.

I googled and here are some results: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&hs=bu0&sa=X&oi=spell&resnum=1&ct=result&cd=1&q=pc+modder&spell=1 Further, I found this website very useful: http://www.overclockers.com to include the links they provide. As for modding itself, if you really want to stand out, you must &quot;create&quot; rather than put together off-the-shelf parts. You'll get the idea once you delve into this. good luck -----Willy
