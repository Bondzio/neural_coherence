all of a sudden, my usb drives are running super slow.
i made no changes or additions to what is plugged in the drives.
whenever i plug in the drive i get &quot;this drive could perform faster&quot; (which never happened before) when i go to load a new large file onto my usb drive/portable hd, ect.
i get 1 mb/sec (at most).
any port i try it in, i get the same speed.
any ideas?
solutions?
