I believe that my Motherboard has gone bad, but I need advice before I Replace it, once i do get it to boot to windows it runs fine. Here are my Specs. Shuttle AK 35GT2 MB AMP Athalon XP 2200 CPU 1 Gig PC2700 Memory ATI 9550 256 Meg AGP Video Card Turtle Beach 5.1 Sound card Maxtor 120 gig HD Windows XP Pro SP2 (Full Version)

And if you do wind up needing a mobo, you'llwant a new PSU to protect it anyway! Good Luck
