I've been looking at tablets for quite along time now and i happen to come across these awesome deals. The only thing is I cant decide on which one is the best. Office depot has the Google Nexus 7 32Gb for $240. They have the Asus Transformer pad 32Gb for $300. They also have the Samsung Glasaxy tab 2 10.1 16Gb for $300. And lastly they have the Samsung Galaxy tab 2 7&quot; 16Gb for $170. I would like to use a tablet for school and use the polaris office to type documents. I would use it to play games often. The design and feel of the tablets does not bother me, but I would rather like to have a 10 inch tablet. Just please give me some insight on what is the best deal and which one would be best.

But the problem as I see it is I don't see how you could replace the common laptop with either. I did stumble over a deal for an Asus for 300 which is pretty nice if touchscreen is what you were after. It was a refurb and the office popped for it and it's not bad. http://www.woot.com/offers/11-6-touchscreen-core-i3-vivobook My only wish was it's fan was a bit quieter but for 300, I'm in. Bob

It has every Android gizmo (did you know it has the magnetometer?) and is very nice. The Transformer is the one with the keyboard dock so you get a few 32GB memory slots so it is probably the biggest storage tablet today. It goes for a few days on a charge and it's almost a laptop as I use it with a bluetooth mouse. But neither are used as laptop replacements but demo units for our apps. For work, I can't see how it could fill the laptop's shoes. Maybe and since they are all pretty equal in apps I'm going to write you should buy the cheapest tablet from your post so far. That way you won't get too burned. Bob
