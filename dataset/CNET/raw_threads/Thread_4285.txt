I have a Microtek Scanmaker E3 flatbed scanner that is several years old (guess 5 or 6 years - predates USB scanners). I have tried Omni Form Filler and I just got ScanSoft's Paper Port 10. Neither program will copy forms correctly that are lined. I also have Omni Pro and Pagis and have very few problems scanning plain text documents with them, so I know the scanner works OK. When I copy a form with lines, sometime I get the form just as formatted but no lines and sometime I just get the form that was a page full of text and lines reproduced as just the text squeezed into a paragraph at the top of the page, with all the lines gone. So I wonder, is it the scanner or the software? I just bought Page Port 10 and still have a few days left on the return guarantee. Is there better software out there or should I be looking at a better scanner?
