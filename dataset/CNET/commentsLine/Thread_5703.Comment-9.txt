for years i've been buying my ink on-line via  and have had nothing but good luck with their products.
it's all been non-oem stuff but it's also cost a fraction of what it would have cost me through the big name retail channels.
honestly, in the hundreds of cartridges i've used over the years i can count on one hand the number of bad one's.
if a cartridge is bad it's not so painful to just toss it because they are so cheap to begin with.
i'd suggest buying a few just to &quot;try them out&quot; and see how they work with your printers.
i certainly can't complain as they've worked great for me.
