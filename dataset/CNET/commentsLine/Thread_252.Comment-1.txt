i have a compaq pc, 733 mhz, p3, 128mb ram, currently running an nvidia tnt2 graphics card.
i'd like to upgrade the graphics, now that there are plenty of used g-force cards on the market.
i play a lot of older games (unreal tournament, riven, madden 2002, ghost recon), but there are some newer games that i'd like to get which require a better graphics card.
is there a noticeable difference between a g-force 2 and g-force 4 card?
any other suggestions?
