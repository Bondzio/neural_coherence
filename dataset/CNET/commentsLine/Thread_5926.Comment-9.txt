is this a brand new unformatted drive.
what operating system are you going to use??
if it is win xp it will let you do all of that during the installation from the cd.
the xp cd is bootable.
before starting, go into the bios and set boot from the cd as the first item in the boot sequence in the bios.
it could be second as long as you don't accidently leave a floppy disk in the floppy drive.
lol the comment by lions is that in most bioss there is a setting to enable virus protection.
it is for the sole purpose of letting youi know if something tries to write to you mbr [master boot recrd} most people leave it disabled.
there are some legitimate actions that write to the mbr, so the notice can be annoying [or confusing].
