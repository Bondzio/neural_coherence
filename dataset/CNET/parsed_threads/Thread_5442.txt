<s> I find decaf to help. </s>

<s> its a qtech windows xp home ,e, can u help ma speed up ma comp plz </s>
<s> Not much to work with so we'll have to just keep on the decaf for now. </s>
<s> Try telling the details of the PC such as video, CPU, RAM, hard disk, etc. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> something like adaware (you can download it at download.com) or ccleaner. </s>
<s> And ccleaner has a nice feature where you can go thru your startup in the tools section (they don't put them in your startup folder anymore), and individually remove startup processes. </s>
<s> Careful not to remove your antivirus or anything like that though. </s>
<s> Best to open up Google and do a search on each process, and see what it tells ya. </s>
<s> try a new graphics card in your pc. </s>
<s> Hi it sounds that you are maybe not aware of what components you computer is made up from. </s>
<s> Either try getting someone you know who knows what they are doing to look at it for you or alternatively take it to a computer shop and ask them what if anything you can do with it. </s>
<s> Not the best advice and probably not what you wanted to hear but i think probably the most sensible in this case. </s>
<s> Sheepy </s>
