1.1.1	i know its a older processor i'm building my Dell Optiplex 755 to do HD video editing (primarily COD and Halo Montages) using Sony Vegas pro my current specs: Intel Core 2 Duo e4500 2.2 Ghz Windows 7 HP 64 bit WD Caviar Black 1TB, 7200 rpm, 6.0gb/s, 64 cache 4 GB RAM Onboard graphics (bout to order a video card) The e4500 just cant seem to handle video editing, and my budget is low right now.. i can find q6600s for good deals all over the place, i heard it OCs well, and just wanted to know if it would be a good buy for me.. thanks guys	St

1.3.1	I was asking if anyone has experience with the q6600... so its not a duplicate post..	St
1.4.1	everyone said...its a little bit of a crapshoot....may work, may not work.	St
1.4.2	Trying it will be the only way to tell for sure.	St
1.4.3	Upgrading CPUs is more for generic clone PCs...not off the shelf boxes from Dell, HP, etc., VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	I own 2 HP quad core machines.	St
1.5.2	d4999t and d5000t.	St
1.5.3	Quad core was nice in its day but today I wonder if I would make the change you have discussed.	St
1.5.4	I would if it was under 50 bucks and then move on.	St
1.5.5	The problem is that beyond the CPU I bet I'd need a new HSF unit and maybe a bigger PSU.	St
1.5.6	And after all that, I wonder it it would be much faster.	St
1.5.7	That is, I moved from one video transcoder to HANDBRAKE and found bigger speed gains than what I would expect from changing the CPU.	St
1.5.8	Why?	St
1.5.9	Because this transcoder uses all cores of the CPU where my old software was single core.	St
1.5.10	Bob	St
1.6.1	If you can get the quad cheap.......go for it.	St
1.6.2	Looks like over 2x the cpu power.	St
1.7.1	ive found some excellent deals on it... i heard you can Overclock it easy (although i wont do that with this mobo) people say alot of good things about the Q6600.. im not a PC gamer, i just wanna edit Hd vids smoothly	St
1.8.1	the q6600 installed easily in minutes.. running cool, and running fast	St
