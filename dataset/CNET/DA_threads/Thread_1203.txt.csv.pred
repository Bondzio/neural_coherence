1.1.1	Which routers currently have good content filtering ?	Ques
1.1.2	I am looking at possibly replacing my NetGear 7230 since it seems to & quot ; choke & quot ; after too much use .	St
1.1.3	I like the & quot ; content filtering & quot ; subscription the router allows since I can keep my family from stumbling on certain sites .	St
1.1.4	I did purchase another router that claimed it supported content filtering , but that required entry of each site .	St
1.1.5	I am definitely NOT doing that .	St
1.1.6	Do any other consumer-grade routers support this ?	Ques
1.1.7	I have used a SonicWall SOHO for a several years , but their annual fee for content filtering was much too high for my usage .	St
1.1.8	Brad	St
1.2.1	See if the WRT54G with the upgrade addresses this .	St
1.2.2	http : //lifehacker.com/software/router/hack-attack-turn-your-60-router-into-a-600-router-178132.php As to the 'choke ' , if I see a router do that I update the firmware and make sure it 's not buried under a pile of trash ( heat kills ) .	St
1.2.3	If that does n't do it , it goes back .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	The cfs subscription is more expensive on a SOHO unit because the SOHO is postioned more as a business class appliance ( businesses are more apt to spend higher dollars than consumers ) .	St
1.3.2	Consider purchasing a SonicWALL TZ150 .	St
1.3.3	You should be able to purchase the firewall and the cfs for about the same cost as the SOHO for the first year .	St
1.3.4	The follow-on years should run you about $ 120 per year .	St
1.3.5	Let me know if you need additional details .	St
1.4.1	$ 120 per year is still 3x to 4x what I want to pay .	St
1.4.2	I do n't love my NetGear , but it works for about $ 30 per year for CFS .	St
1.4.3	Does the TZ150 limit the number of users ?	Ques
1.4.4	That was a real annoyance with my SOHO unit .	St
1.4.5	Brad	St
1.5.1	When I check for a firmware update I am told it is & quot ; up to date & quot ; .	St
1.5.2	The unit is also outside the warranty period .	St
1.5.3	I did purchase a NETGEAR WPNT834 RangeMax 4-Port Switch 240 Mbps MIMO 802.11g/b Wireless Router , since I found it for around $ 75 ( which may have been an error ) .	St
1.5.4	I will see if that works any better , though having a spare is not a bad idea either .	St
1.5.5	Brad	St
1.6.1	Take a look at the Zyxel Zywall 2 .	St
1.6.2	I 've had one for 2 years and have been very happy with it .	St
1.6.3	The content filtering subscription can be purchased for about $ 65. per year .	St
