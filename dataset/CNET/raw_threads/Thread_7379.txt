The system comes configured with 2 NEW!!! NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTS 320MB 16X PCI Express graphics cards (Major Brand Powered by NVIDIA) and a STANDARD CASE POWER SUPPLY. However a 500W Power Supply is recommended for using dual 7900 and X1950 or above video cards. Should I stay with the STANDARD CASE POWER SUPPLY or should I upgrade to 500W [for +$49], 600W [+79], or even a 700W (quad SLI ready) [+146]? I have more of the specs right here: - Free!

AMD has many CPUs...case in point THERE ARE TWO AM2 X2 4400s ... which ONE comes with your system ? The 89W or 65W CPU ? Or the 65nm or 90nm technology ? 2200Mhz or 2300Mhz ? 2MB Cache or 1MB cache ? http://www.amdcompare.com/us-en/desktop/SideBySide.aspx?opn=ADO5000IAA6CZ&opn=ADO4800IAA5DD&opn=ADO4400IAA5DD&opn=ADA4400IAA6CS The other point is you should ask to find out how much more for a 4800 or 5000. It's often the case you can upgrade to a faster CPU for only a few bucks more than the one you're buying. Can't figure why you're putting such a low-end CPU in an otherwise high-end system ? VAPCMD

You can see more specs @ http://www.cyberpowerpc.com/spec/getspec.asp?n=CPU&v=%28Socket%20AM2%29%20AMD%20Athlon%u212264%20X2%204400%2b%20Dual-Core%20CPU%20w/%20HyperTransport%20Technology . No I am not changing my CPU. I just need to know what power supply I should get.

But since you're not interested in knowing more or scoping out better options...I'll leave you to your power supply. VAPCMD
