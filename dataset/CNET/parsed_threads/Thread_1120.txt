<s> Well I want to upgrade my RAM on my HP m8000n to 4gb. </s>
<s> But heres, the problem, I have no clue what kind of RAm my computer has and I dont know if i should replace the current 2gb of RAM with better ram, add the same RAM, or add better ram and use it with the current ram that I have. </s>
<s> I really need help with this. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Go here http://www.crucial.com/ Input the computer specs or let it scan your computer. </s>
<s> It'll tell you what is right for the computer. </s>
<s> I've used them for years. </s>
<s> You didn't share what application you have that will use it. </s>
<s> Remember that Windows by default limits applications to 2.0 GB of RAM. </s>
<s> You won't see much gain from this move. </s>
<s> Tell more. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yes it would be helpfull to know all your computer specs but anyway. </s>
<s> Good idea going to crucial, i like it. </s>
<s> First you sould find out if your computer can even handle more ram. </s>
<s> if not, just upgrade the speed, not the size. </s>
<s> As far as knowing what you have now, you can normally see it being seen and recognized by the computer at boot. </s>
<s> the first screen you see when you turn your computer on, should have something like &quot;PC2 4200 or a large number of Kb's of memory with a speed next to it. </s>
<s> you can hit the pause/break key on your keyboard to freeze the screen if you want to look for this. </s>
<s> For the speed of your new ram: if you put in the same kind, it will run at the same speed. </s>
<s> if you put in better ram it will run at the speed of your old ram.Second: one thing to do would be to actually look at your ram to see if there is a sticker or printing on the ram that has a number such as a PC4200, or 667Mhz for example. </s>
<s> Then if it has a PC4200 number for example, look up that number to see what speed it represents. </s>
<s> Cannot make any promises on this to find out what kind you have though. </s>
<s> it worked for me. </s>
<s> how many slots for ram do you have? </s>
<s> if you only have two and are just going to put in the same ram, DONT. </s>
<s> it would be completely redundant. </s>
<s> You should upgrade to better ram if you do infact have only two. </s>
<s> if you do have 4 slots for ram, then you could put in more, better ram, on a few conditions. </s>
<s> one, if you have windows 32-bit, only put in a total of 4 gb of ram, thats all it will recognize. </s>
<s> two, if you have windows 64-bit, put in as much as you want. </s>
<s> Lastly, you sould only be upgrading your ram if you really need to. </s>
<s> For gaming would be a good reason, or if your computer is just laging and running slow, upgrading you ram might help. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, TheProblemSolver </s>
<s> That's really the place to start for product upgrades...esp RAM. </s>
<s> If after reading the manual you're still unsure..or you want a second opinion, then ask the question again. </s>
