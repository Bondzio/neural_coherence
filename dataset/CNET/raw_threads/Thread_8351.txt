Every time I restart the computer, the hard drive partitions erase themselves. This first occurred when I restarted for avast update (I was running XP). The computer can see the hard drive, and I am able to reinstall the OS (windows 7) and run it. I've tried reformatting it twice in the past two days and that hasn't worked. The computer is a custom built and the hard drive is a 750 GB Western Digital WD7500AADS-00L5B1. Do I need to replace my hard drive, or is there a fix?

Unless you put that drive in another machine or booted from a utility disk that could provide partition information, it would be difficult to know that this was happening. What error are you seeing and how did you make this diagnosis?

I can't remember exactly. But I had my boot order go from hard drive to disc drive, so it skipped the hard drive.
