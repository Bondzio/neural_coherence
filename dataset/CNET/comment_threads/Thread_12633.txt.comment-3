There appears to be an issue with NEC Dual Layer drives and ITunes 5.x I have 3 machines set up with 8x and 16x drives and ITunes 5.x will see them, the cd diagnostics show its fine, but it gives me a &quot;CD Burner or Software not found...&quot; error message.
There are lots of folks with this issue.
If you can install ver 4.9 it would probably work.
