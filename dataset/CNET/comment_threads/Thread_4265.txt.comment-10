Other forums indicate that this may be due to a memory card in your printer or memory stick in your computer.
If you click on Safely Remove Hardware before exiting (& select said memory card/stick), it'll go away.
I suspect that whether or not the memory card/stick is in place when you turn on the computer has a bearing on this.
I'm amused by this because I thought it was something to do with the Card Reader software (very old DOS program) which I continued to use until very recently as I had a load of contact details which only it could read.
I haven't used it for 3 months so I was amazed to keep getting this message - anyway, I think I understand now.
It's just another example of Micosoft's incompetence.
