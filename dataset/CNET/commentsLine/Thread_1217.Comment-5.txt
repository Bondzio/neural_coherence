hi again, sorry if i missed some info: have tried the external in different pd's but same problem, have also got a loan of another enclosure and tried it in that and also no differnce, so it sure seems that the problem is with the hd itself, hope this helps - my main focus is the recovery of the data - i know i can send the hd off to a clean room etc... but was looking for a fix i can do myself thanks again, ger.
