1.1.1	I have been unable to successfully load the driver for an external USB Drive in Windows 98SE .	St
1.1.2	The Drive mounts perfectly when attached to a machine running XP or ME .	St
1.1.3	The case ( Travelstar ) uses a Genesys GL811E Chipset .	St
1.1.4	When attached to the USB port , the system correctly recognises the presence of the drive .	St
1.1.5	However , when loading the final driver files the system crashes and locks up .	St
1.1.6	I have tried both the driver on the CD supplied with case and a driver I found at ''Driverguide '' listed for the GL811 chipset .	St
1.1.7	The driver files look pretty similar and neither one will load properly .	St
1.1.8	I have tried this on two separate machines running Win98SE .	St
1.1.9	The outcome is the same on both systems - no success .	St
1.1.10	Behavior is the same whether using the onboard USB 1.1 ports or a PCI USB 2.0 port .	St
1.1.11	Can anyone provide any suggestions on how to get this working ?	Ques
1.1.12	Thanks , JIm	St
1.2.1	Over at USBMAN.COM some pages are about some motherboard chipsets as well as USB 98se files .	St
1.2.2	I offer no do-this cure but the site I used to figure it out .	St
1.2.3	The crash or lockup is typical when an owner has not installed latest chipset driver packages .	St
1.2.4	Cheers , Bob	St
