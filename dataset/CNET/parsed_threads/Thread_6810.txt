<s> Hello, I am building a gaming computer with a intel E8400 and have been told that Vista is not a good choice for an OS. </s>
<s> Does anyone know what works best? </s>
<s> Is the XP pro X64 a good choice because I am using a the E8400? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for your assistance! </s>
<s> Very iffy as to driver support. </s>
<s> Be sure your machine's maker will back you up for drivers or replace hardware that doesn't work there. </s>
<s> Look at tomshardware.com and see what they run. </s>

<s> you might run into issues with older/obscure titles, but any popular game released in the past 3 years will run fine. </s>
<s> you will need to budget for more ram (2gb) than with xp pro (which runs fine with 1gb). </s>
<s> xp 64bit is not a good choice because few games supported it and it doesn't have the ability to mimic xp (and thus fool games into running properly) as well as vista 64bit. </s>
<s> I see. </s>
<s> I am seriously thinking of just getting XP pro as I intend on putting in 4 gigs ram. </s>
<s> I have a bunch of old games I still like to play, so vista looks like it may not be the best choice. </s>
<s> Appreciate your help! </s>
<s> http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/platform/server/PAE/PAEmem.mspx So what's the 4th GB for? </s>
<s> Does your application that use the IMAGE_FILE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE in the process header? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I havent actually recieved any components or software yet. </s>
<s> Just finalizing what I am going to buy for the OS. </s>
<s> The 4 gigs is to run games smoother, I hope it helps. </s>
<s> Although 4 gigs has gotten pretty cheap, only paying about $120 on newegg. </s>
<s> It's not much payoff past 1GB on XP. </s>
<s> I have seen a little payoff on just 2 games so far from 1 to 2 and those are Crysis and Bioshock. </s>
<s> Nothing else seems to care past 2.0GB. </s>
<s> However the number of machines going out with 4GB is phenomenal. </s>
<s> You just wonder when the questions will stop (where's my ram?) </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I was not aware. </s>
<s> The only reason I am choosing 4gigs is to hopefully make the PC somewhat (near) future proof. </s>
<s> I see what your saying though. </s>
<s> There must be a memory ceiling and being someone who doesnt readily through money out the window, I probably wont go past 4gigs in the near future. </s>
