1.1.1	I'm about to buy a tablet and need some help deciding between these wide aspect choices: http://www.adesso.com/products_detail.asp?productid=347 (2000 dpi., Affordable) Not sure if it will work well with Sketchbook Pro...	St
1.1.2	Anyone know?	St
1.1.3	http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000RAHUOW?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&tag=dealtime-ce-feed-20&linkCode=asn (Only 1000dpi., This one is affordable also) http://www.entercomputers.com/_e/Graphics_Tablets/sproduct/1011139868/Penpower_Tooya_Pro_USB_Graphics_Tablet.htm (A little more than I want to spend.	St
1.1.4	2000lpi.)	St
1.1.5	Wacom is too expensive for the size I want.	St
1.1.6	Looking to spend about $100(+,-).	St
1.1.7	I'm mostly unsure about how all of these will work with Sketchbook.	St
1.1.8	I think I like the Adesso but I'm just not sure yet.	St
1.1.9	Anyone have any other suggestions/advice?	St
1.1.10	Thanks for any help.	Polite
1.2.1	I would also go with the Adesso.	St
1.3.1	I can't find a single Adesso z12 product review.	St
1.3.2	It looks like a good one but I really wish I could read some reviews...	St
1.3.3	I did come across this tablet though: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16823102010&nm_mc=OTC-C173T&cm_mmc=OTC-C173T-_-Input+Devices+-+Tablets-_-Genius-_-23102010 This one is a little cheaper and appears to have a lot of the same features as the Adesso.	St

1.3.5	Thanks again.	Polite
