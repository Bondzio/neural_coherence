ok, well ive had this problem ever since i got a new hard drive, and new install of windows.
after i got everything basic done, i installed all my drivers from the cds, for my mobo, gfx card, and hard drive.
then i went online, and downloaded updated drivers for everything.
but now im having massive problems with my computer in terms of gfx, especially in gaming.
used to be i could run all the new source games just fine, long loads yes, but they still ran fine on medium settings.
now i can barely run the older half life games, i cant even play dod without tons of lag, and my framerate being shot to hell.
i have also experienced other problems, including the icons on the desktop, the semi-transparent area around them just comes out as black, so they look jagged and ugly.
i also cant watch videos on the internet.
i get this green screen instead and my computer slows down horribly.
now i have opened up my case, and i have made sure everything was tightened down, i even unhooked my extra hard drives to see if it was too much for my power supply.
i am clueless as to whats wrong, but my sister is willing to help me out and buy a few replacement parts.
not a full new system like i thought at first, but just things like maybe a new gfx card or power supply.
what i need to know is what i need to do, cause i am clueless as to whats wrong.
heres my system specs if that helps: gigabyte kt600 k7 triton 400 fsb motherboard amd athlon xp 2200+ 512mb pc2700 corsair memory gainward nvidia geforce fx 5200 128mb creative 24-bit sound card raidmax scorpio atx-868wbp black computer case w\420watts power supply segate 250gb ide hd sony cd-rw sony dvd-rom 8 led case fans im pretty sure thats it.
i mean before i installed the new hard drive, i added 2 new fans.
other than that i cant think of anything else.
any advice would rock!!
thanks before hand!
