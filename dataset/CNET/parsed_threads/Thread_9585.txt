<s> Normally, one can change the &quot;region&quot; on a DVD drive to play DVD videos a maximum 5 times. </s>
<s> My question is, what count as a &quot;time&quot; ? </s>
<s> For example if I change the original 1 to 2, then to 3 then back to 1, that be 3 times.(?) </s>
<s> If I change from 1 to 2 then back to 1 again, would that be 2 times or 1 time ? </s>
<s> i.e. </s>
<s> does returning to the last change count ? </s>

<s> Why do this? </s>
<s> CNet told a secret at this article. </s>
<s> http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-6603_7-5141963-1.html The result is your DVD which doesn't require such changes. </s>
<s> Due to the possibility of abuse I can only write this much and you must figure out the rest, but it is the answer to your issue. </s>

<s> ...for supplying the article. </s>
<s> Seems not very helpful - at first glance. </s>
<s> But then.. figure it out ? </s>
<s> Hmmm. </s>
<s> So, the result is that regional restrictions are removed ? </s>
<s> Well, too much trouble getting that result. </s>
<s> Will be getting three DVD burners - one for each region... </s>
<s> There are other benefits such as being able to skip forced previews etc. </s>
<s> This nicety is why you may find in my DVD cases not only the original but the DVDShrink copy. </s>
<s> Plus if I scratch the copy it's no big deal. </s>
<s> Hope it sinks in all the benefits. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> .... but is it legal, making changes to the original for a personal backup copy ? </s>
<s> Anyway, have you already reveal too much ? </s>
<s> It is supposed to be a secret, to prevent &quot;abuse&quot;, which you seemed concerned about....but then I guess many would be able to &quot;figure it out&quot; given that article. </s>
