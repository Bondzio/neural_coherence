<s> Mine has the WRT54G and the other has thw WUSB54G. </s>
<s> Both have internet but I can't share files or my printer. </s>
<s> I am not sure if I set up my network right or what. </s>
<s> When I go to My Network Places on my desktop I see the other computer but when I try that on the other computer I don't see my computer. </s>
<s> Also when I try to set up my printer for file sharing it says &quot;Printer Settings could not be saved. </s>
<s> Operation could not be completed&quot; I am not sure what to do. </s>
