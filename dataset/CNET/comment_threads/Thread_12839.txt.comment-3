It is enabled.
I read the MS white paper on it but it was over my head.
Power Options Sleep after 30min Hibernate Never Display off after 10min Keyboard & Mouse both allow to wake computer but NOT checked to allow pc to turn off device to save power.
Strange thing though.
I didn't power button it off and just left it to call Fry's and when I came back the screen was black (maybe screen saver mode came on or monitor?)
and I pressed a key and then everything works fine.
Could it be a power screen saving thing with the montior?
It's a LG 2286L.
