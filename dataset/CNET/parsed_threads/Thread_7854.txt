<s> They are certainly better than nothing. </s>
<s> The plain fact any help in keeping a laptop cooler is a plus. </s>
<s> Unfortantly not much is out there, while coolers are simple, they do the job. </s>
<s> Simply evalating the rear laptop case to expose to airflow is a plus. </s>
<s> You can help keep it cooler by &quot;throtting down&quot; the cpu even when used as a safe bet, then throttle up when really required. </s>

<s> I have a Toshiba Satellite 1830 laptop with XP Pro OS and was having heaps of problems with &quot;blue screens&quot; and sudden shutdoowns. </s>
<s> I tried the &quot;elevation option&quot;, which did reduce the frequency of the above problems but did not eliminate it. </s>
<s> Then, in desperation I purchased a &quot;YL Notebook Cooler Pad&quot; (Model NB-02) from a supplier on E-bay for AUD 29 including postage. </s>
<s> I'm overjoyed with the results ... </s>
<s> Since then, I've not experienced one Blue Screen or shutdown. </s>
<s> Additionally, the laptop seems to even funtion more quickly/efficiently when performing routine tasks. </s>
<s> It's a truly amazing result and well worth the money spent. </s>
