so is the owner.....the keyboard is clean, and i checked the mouse, and cleaned it.
i opened the cover and checked all the connections and the inside was clean.
the computer belongs to a 95yr oldfriend who likes the old computer better than the new one she has, because the card making program she's used to, is not compatable with the newer one, she just don't want to have to get used to a new compuer.
it was not coming on at all, and a computer expert told her the hard drive was gone.
i brought it home and got it to boot as far as the desktop....
