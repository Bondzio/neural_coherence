I currently have a Logitech MX Revolution mouse and I'm about to throw it through a wall! It constantly stutters and freezes while I'm playing simple computer games. I've tried uninstalling the software to see if that helps and the problem still persists. I've done a lot of research and I'm at a loss at what mouse I should try next. I really like the ergonomics of the Revolution which I think means I prefer a palm grip. I also like the cordless factor but I'm not completely opposed to a corded. I've been looking at gaming mice like the X8 sidewinder, the Logitech G5 & G9, Microsoft Habu and the Razer Death Adder but I'm not sure if the gaming mice would be overkill for me. The Sidewinder seems like it may be too big for me (I'm a woman) from reviews, but I like the wireless aspect. The Razer Mamba is the only one I can find that can switch from wired to wireless but paying over $100 for a mouse that has a lot of features I'll never use seems silly to me. I do not play any hard core games but I would like to get through a game of Luxor without slamming my mouse out of frustration. I have been looking at mice using a laser tracking system because I don't like to use a mouse pad and use it directly on my desk (wood) - another reason the Sidewinder seemed like a good choice due to the blue track system, but I am afraid of the size. Does the DPI or wireless capability have anything to do with the problems I'm having or is it just the mouse? I would really like a mouse with the same ergonomic build that doesn't have the problems I've mentioned. I have a new computer with plenty of RAM, large hard drive and dual processors so the computer is not the problem. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Some of the issues you have been having could be created by the surface and light refractivity.

Some are only good for optical and some are only good for laser. Aside from that, I do have some expertise in the mouse division. If you like the Revolution, you will probably like the similarly-shaped Logitech G5. It's a solid mouse with plenty of features. DPI switching is great, and the weight cartridge is a little gimicky, but is great if you're picky about weight. If you want something really cool, the G500 will be coming out, which is basically a super G5. Note that just because you like the Revolutions grip, you do not necessarily have a &quot;palm&quot; grip. You know you have a palm grip when you don't even squeeze the sides of the mouse with your fingers to move it because your palm is on top of it. If you DO have a palm grip, you can probably use one of the SideWinder mice. It's not really that much bigger than the G5 length-wise, but people feel like it is because of the height on the back. If you rest your whole palm on top of the mouse, you will be fine... unless your fingers are child-like small. It sounds like you don't need a lot of slick macro features and rediculously high DPI engines, so I would recommend the G5.

Because of that, they too are becoming another task the system has to service. A std. PS2 mouse just didn't have so many problems. Now add IF or wifi and batteries, etc., you get the picture. As others suggested, get the required pad for better operation. Understand that during gaming, intense PC usage is at hand even for simple games, that's fact. Your mouse being yet another device may falter under such conditions. A simple USB may help as being physically connected loses many of the IF or wifi issues. Further, they're cheaper and/or tend to work in all aspects of what many users want just being cabled is the holdout. Now decide....... tada -----Willy

I got the WOW pad today and I cannot even believe it - my mouse is working perfectly! *knocks on wood* Love this pad b/c it is super thin. I don't particularly like using a mouse pad to begin with but with this one it is so thin and large that I hardly notice it (except the mouse glides much easier on it than on the desk). I never even thought that would be a problem b/c I was under the impression that laser mice worked on any surface except glass. I have a wood grain desk and thought that would be fine. I also went to Best Buy to try out some mice and the Logitech G5 was my favorite fit, next was the G9. Did not like the Razer mice - way too flat for me. They did not have the Sidewinder to try and they also did not have the mice out of the packages so I had to feel them in the plastic. Staples had them out but had none of the mice I was interested in. I probably don't even need a new mouse now thanks to your great advice, but if I do I will probably stay with Logitech. Perhaps I'll wait for that new one that was mentioned to come out to have a good corded mouse on hand should anything happen in the future As far as the palm vs claw grip: I did some research on what each is and mostly hold my mouse in a palm grip but I did notice that for some games that need greater/more precise movement, I pull my palm up slightly and use my fingers more. I see they call that the fingertip grip. I suppose I actually use both grips, depending on what I'm doing and I do not use the claw grip at all (although I also found some people consider the fingertip grip and claw grips to be essentially the same thing - my fingers stay pretty flat which is why I think it's probably not considered a claw). Well, thanks again everybody. Your help was greatly appreciated! Jen
