Damage may already have been done to the psu beyond what a fan can correct though properly cooled. If new system, check warranty. If you replace be aware of your abilites, some fans are a drop-in, just unplag and swap. Others you &quot;unsolder&quot; and replace/swap. Further, be sure you get the right fan type, in voltage/vanes(blades) and cfm rating, etc.. This is the time to get a higher wattage replacement psu as the system can better from it, especially is a decent one(brand name). tada -----Willy
