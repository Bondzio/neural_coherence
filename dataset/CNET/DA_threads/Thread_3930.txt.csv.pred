1.1.1	i am having a monitor IBM P200 ( 6555-773 ) which is old IBM monitor with the following Scpecification please go to that link http : //www.dooyoo.co.uk/crt-monitor/ibm-p-200/details/ but mainly the Diagonal Size 20 & quot ; Dot Pitch / Pixel Pitch 0.31 mm Max Resolution 1600 x 1280 Max Sync Rate ( V x H ) 120 Hz x 90 kHz Image Colour Temperature 9300K , 5000K Interface VGA ( HD-15 ) i am looking for equivalent monitor which can work instead of that one and fulfilling the specs above , another question is what is the main parameters you can conside when u are looking for a monitor which will replace obslete monitor with a new one in the market nowadays ?	Ques
1.1.2	please help , that is urgently needed	Sug
1.2.1	refresh rate etc exactly .	St
1.2.2	There is a 20.4 Samsung LCD .	St
1.2.3	Remember that with LCD monitors the diagonal size is exactly the size advertised , while the CRT monitors are much smaller diagonally .	St
1.2.4	The native resolution for the 20.4 Samsung is 1600 X 1200 , since ther are 3 [ thinfilm transistors per [ 1 red , 1 green , 1 blue ] pixel , there arte a total of 1600 X 1200 X3 elements in order to fill up the LCD screen .	St
1.2.5	To use a lesser resolution the video/monitor circuitry runs an algotrithm to color the pixels that are not included in the resolution that you may use in order to still fill up the screen .	St
1.2.6	TFT 's can not be turned on and off as fast as the pixels in a CRT , however because they stay on when turned on [ they do NOT decay the way that the CRT phosphur does ] they ca n't run at the high refresh rates but really do n't need to since they stay colored until the next color change .	St
1.2.7	Possibly you should try to figure out exactly which parameters that are absolutely necessary for your application .	Sug
1.2.8	That Monitor has both an analog and a DVI input available .	St
1.2.9	I am NOT Toni , and NOT a Moderator , just borrowing her computer .	St
1.3.1	i am asking if i am having obslete monitor and i have to select a new monitor from the market nowadays to replace it what kinds of parameters i should consider when i am selecting a new monitor so it can work ?	Ques
1.3.2	is my question clear ?	Ques
1.3.3	one parameter is resolution ?	Ques
1.3.4	, should be the same ?	Ques
1.3.5	what about vertical and horizontal freq ?	Ques
1.3.6	should be in the new monitor at least high than the old one ?	Ques
1.3.7	is there any other parameters to consider ?	Ques
1.3.8	hope my question is clear ant not boring for you	St
1.4.1	in any way going to get obsolete .	St
1.4.2	CRT monitors are still better monitors than LCD monitors for most uses .	St
1.4.3	However the newer LCD monitors are also excellent .	St
1.4.4	Some will argue that the color on a CRT can be better , the response faster if one is a gamer playing the most demanding games .	St
1.4.5	However , the light weight and easy handling of LCD 's and the faster response time of the newer LCD 's usually makes those arguments not hold much water .	St
1.4.6	Only problem in comparing LCDs response time is that the LCD manufacturers do not use the exact same spec when stating response time , thus not all LCD monitors stated to be 8 millisecond [ or any other value of response time are equal ] .	St
1.4.7	The earliest LCDs were about 35 Millisecond response time , there are now claiming 4 Millsecond .	St
1.4.8	In general the lower number response time should be better , but again , one can not compare the stated response time values exactly .	St
1.4.9	CRT monitors are normally lower price than LCD 's , however the market for CRT 's is drying up thus the best models such as the top line Sony 's are not even made any more .	St
1.4.10	I am colorblind .	St
1.4.11	From what I read if one needs perfect color rendering to be happy , one must actually see the exact monitor that they want to buy to be sure of color satisfaction .	St
1.4.12	One can not be assured of color rendering to their liking by reading a specification , or advertisement .	St
1.4.13	Some LCD monitors can be run vertically like a page in a book as well as the normal horizontal use .	St
1.4.14	They include software that allows the two orientations .	St
1.4.15	Presently the trend in LCD for the 20 Inch and up monitors is toward the wide screen models .	St
1.4.16	The trend is to eventually support HDTV resolutions with a computer monitor , thus the ratio of height to width of the screen is is different than the CRT and older LCD monitors .	St
1.4.17	You need to investigate such things as possible HDTV to really determine what you want in your monitor future .	St
1.4.18	You should be able to do some googling of the subject of HTDV monitors and related computer info .	St
1.4.19	Hope that this helps a little .	St
1.4.20	Good luck .	Polite
