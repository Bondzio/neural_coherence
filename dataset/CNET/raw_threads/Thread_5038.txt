There always appear occasions in which we could not make right choices. That's why need friends who accompany us and give us sincere suggestions on what to do. So that is why I love the invention of &quot;forum&quot;. These days I have been considering to change a new notebook. Before this, I bought the next product and several bare Samsung SATA drives, preparing to deal with all data in my old Toshiba notebook. http://www.amazon.com/products/dp/B00EHDTQQ0 I am not so skilled in handling this process. I am worried that this gadget would come across problems resulting to data loss in the transferring. Is it reasonable for my worry? Or do you have any experience like this? which factors to pay attention on ?

If you plan to xfer data from one source to another that's been a common practice. I don't a problem here provided you follow any instructions given or supplied to you. if the posts required for such a device are available then agin it should work. I leave it at that. tada -----Willy

Then I know I've got everything from my old PC and can selectively restore whatever I want. I do export my email & contacts separately only because it's easier that way. In the past I've used Norton Ghost 15, but that's no longer on the market so I've switched to Easeus Todo Backup. Some people like Acronis True Image, but I've had a lot of problems with it, so I avoid it. An alternative is WET, Windows Easy Transfer, which a lot of people like. It's slow, and it's all or nothing with no options, which is why I don't like it. Like Willy, I got a blank screen when I clicked on your link. ` Good luck.

Sorry, it is very nice of you to remind the blank link. i searched and post it here again. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EHDTQQ0 I would rather to know the difference between the so-called &quot;docking station&quot; and hard drive enclosures. Which one is easier to operate?

Most of the higher- edition USB 3.0 devices support backward with USB 2.0? Is this one with the function or performance?

My friend also reminded me that the speed may reduce into USB 2.0 speed when it works on USB 2.0 devices. However , it still sounds great and attractive to me if it supports both.

The ease of use vs. that of ext. USB case becomes apparent, however either will work once you understand the limits of each. Though, I assume that the &quot;docking station&quot; is more open to use on as needed basis and/or immediate one. As for USB 2 and 3, then you assume the risk that it may not work on that basis alone. This is a very strong roadblock in Dell PC and maybe others. tada -----Willy
