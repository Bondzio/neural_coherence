I'm doing a community service project at a local nature center, and it involves installing network storage into their computer network.
I'm not sure of the details yet, but they have told me that they have an &quot;old&quot; desktop computer that I could use to convert to a network storage device.
Their computer network consists of around 4 or 5 computers, and is a peer-to-peer network.
If I had to guess I would say the desktop I would be converting is running Win 98 or ME.
Does anyone know a way to convert a desktop into a network storage device?
I would greatly appreciate any help.
P.S.- I'll have more details on this soon.
