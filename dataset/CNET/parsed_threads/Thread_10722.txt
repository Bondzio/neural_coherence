<s> i have an emachine T6522 and i was wondering what if anyone knows what psu will fit and has enough power to run a good graphics card. </s>

<s> Some OEM vendors tend to differ slightly only to make it hard for end-users to correct later issues. </s>
<s> This website provides some help on a source, but google for more: http://www.power-on.com/atx12vem300bt.html Further, the absolute best psu source are those from: http://www.pcpowerandcooling.com and find the replacement for your model. </s>
<s> The same advice goes for any replacement from any vendor, it MUST be compatible as a direct &quot;fit&quot; as well as power needs. </s>
