Since it would be surprising that I run your un-named software title I'll have to pass on answering your post.
However I will share that if I were to do this I'd look for a WAAS enabled NMEA compatible Bluetooth GPS.
I wonder what &quot;card&quot; you are asking about.
I use a variety of 20 or less dollar USB Bluetooth dongles in my system.
