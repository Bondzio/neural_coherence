Yes, this can be costly.
But in most cases, if a desktop, repair can be just the motherboard and/or CPU.
The reason why an incorrectly inserted board or part can fry components is simple.
Power is on some of the pins and the partial/incorrectly inserted part can send power to pins that can't take power.
A tactical error on your part is to run DEFRAG on a possibly damaged machine.
This is a great TEST of the hardware, but can result in a scrambled hard disk.
Installing the OS can outstrip most user skills.
Best of luck in your repairs.
