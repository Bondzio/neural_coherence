<s> Condition(s): 1 LAN/Network (5 pc's) with Cable internet connection, using Cable modem and a router (DHCP enabled, with router IP: 192.168.1.1) 1 LAN/Network (7 pc's) with ADSL internet connection, using ADSL modem and a router (DHCP enabled, with router IP: 192.168.2.1) Note: Both LAN/Network located in the &quot;same&quot; building/house. </s>
<s> Problems or Goal: to make both LAN/Network can share Data/files. </s>
<s> Question: How to setup the connection of both LAN/Network together, so it can share data/files? </s>
<s> Thank you for any help. </s>
<s> The simplist solution is to just drop DHCP and hardcode the IP address all around. </s>
<s> Use the same IP, Gateway, DNS entries and change the NETMASK to 255.255.0.0 and it will work fine with internet traffic still going to each respective DSL and Cable box. </s>
<s> If this isn't a solution for you, then you will have loads of fun with net route commands and another (real) router. </s>
<s> But I won't be doing that because it's too much for this small space. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The word &quot;same&quot; (IP, Gateway, DNS entries and NETMASK to 255.255.0.0), confused me a little. </s>
<s> Currently both LAN/Network are separated physically. </s>
<s> Can I just plug in both modem (Cable and ADSL) in one Switch (Cable + ADSL Modem -&gt; Switch --&gt; PC's) and make the IP, Gateway, DNS entries and NETMASK to 255.255.0.0, configuration as you suggested? </s>
<s> If I understand it correctly then: For the Cable modem I set the IP: 192.168.1.1 For the ADSL modem I set the IP: 192.168.1.2 Disable DHCP Set DNS (as per ISP (cable/ADSL requirement?) </s>
<s> Set Gateway (192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.2) Set Netmask (255.255.0.0 on both modem?) </s>
<s> For the PC's, I configure each PC's accordingly. </s>
<s> Does it matter if they use different workgroup name? </s>
<s> Please advice, Thank You </s>
<s> It should be: Cable modem --&gt; Router --&gt; Switch ADSL Modem/Router --&gt; Switch (same Switch), then from the switch to the PC's. </s>
<s> No changes were needed on the modems. </s>
<s> The cable/dsl routers might need one tweak. </s>
<s> Turn off DHCP. </s>
<s> Then you SET all the IP, DNS, GATEWAY on each client, but all the systems use the NETMASK value of 255.255.0.0 Done. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> After more coffee, it occurred to me that only 1/2 or less of the CLIENT machines and just ONE dsl/cable needs work. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Select which router has the most users or which one you want to set to DHCP. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Disable DHCP in the router that you will not want DHCP. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Alter the router that remains a DHCP server to hand out the NETMASK 255.255.0.0 4. on the Lan with no DHCP, change all the CLIENTS to Static IP addressing using what they got as a template and change the NETMASK to 255.255.0.0 5. </s>
<s> Connect the two LANs. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Both modem/router have a default IP 192.168.1.1 is this default only valid with DHCP enabled? </s>
<s> if both have that same IP.. and connected to the same switch, aren't they conflicting? </s>
<s> Anyway I will try it on monday, before that, Please help with this details: Cable modem-router, DHCP enabled, with IP address 192.168.1.1, netmask 255.255.0.0 no changes on the pc's ADSL modem/router, DHCP disabled, with IP? </s>
<s> ?, netmask 255.255.0.0 On the PC's, IP 192.168.?. </s>
<s> ?, Netmask 255.255.0.0, Gateway ???? </s>
<s> others?? </s>
<s> Thank You </s>
<s> In short, that was NOT in your first post. </s>
<s> So you would alter the NAT/Router of choice before you start so you can do this with some ease. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Cable modem router, DHCP enabled, IP: 192.168.1.1, netmask 255.255.255.0 -- Client pc's are Automatic IP.. (with an IP range 192.168.1.100 -&gt; 140) ADSL modem/router, DHCP disabled, IP: 192.168.1.2, netmask 255.255.255.0 -- Client pc's IP: 192.168.1.2xx, gateway 192.168.1.2, DNS: as ISP required. </s>
<s> It seems to works... but did I do it correctly? </s>
<s> Why you stressed out the netmask of 255.255.0.0? </s>
<s> Tried to use fix IP under 192.168.1.140.. on ADSL modem/router, but then I concern with conflicting IP when the PC's are started.. (thats the reason of IP above 200) Tried using different IP on each modem/router (i.e Cable IP: 192.168.1.1 and ADSL IP: 192.168.2.1), it didn't work for LAN(file/data share) If I could make it better or fix something, please advice.. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> It can work, but I was concerned that the NAT/Routers may not know how to handle the packet bound for the other LAN. </s>
<s> Good to see it works. </s>
<s> &quot;It seems to works... but did I do it correctly?&quot; The file sharing and route to/from each LAN may fail. </s>
<s> If so, you change the netmask so that both LANs are in the same LAN. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thank you for your help, I guess I have to stay with the working configuration. </s>
<s> But then I have another question regarding the 'Fixed IP' on a couple of Laptop involved in the LAN. </s>
<s> Those Laptop are configured to use the ADSL with fix IP address. </s>
<s> What should be done to make it 'mobile' from one LAN/network environment to another (i.e. </s>
