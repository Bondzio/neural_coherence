1.1.1	I have a $ 1500 budget to build gaming computer to be used for battlefield 2 and half-life 2 , and all those other good games .	St
1.1.2	Anyone have any ideas to help me meet my budget ?	Ques
1.2.1	Hi !	St
1.2.2	You 've come to the right place .	St
1.2.3	Hundreds of users can help .	St
1.2.4	1500 is plenty .	St
1.2.5	Newegg is the perfect site .	St
1.2.6	Lets go with the case first : CASE : A Thermaltake would be good , the Tsunami models look really cool .	St
1.2.7	It has plenty of open slots , and I 've heard good reviews .	St
1.2.8	$ :139..	St
1.2.9	If you want to keep the 400W PSU , thats fine , but if you want more power I 'd go with a Ultra-X 500W or even 600w .	St
1.2.10	MOTHERBOARD : ASUS A8N-Sli Premium , hands down .	St
1.2.11	To save a few bucks , go with the Deluxe instead of the Premium , or even more buy the refurbished one at Newegg .	Sug
1.2.12	$ 160 Processor : AMD 3500+ $ :230 Memory : 1 GB of Corsair $ 86 Hard Drive : 160GB SATA ( Samsung , Segate , WD ) $ 80 CD/DVD : A Sony DVD Burner $ 90 Simple Floppy ( IF NEEDED ) : $ 15 Sound Card ( Internal is also pretty good ) : $ 150 Video Card : 6600GT $ 200 OR WAIT 9 DAYS FOR ATI 'S NEW CARDS , PROBABLY FASTER ! !	St
1.2.13	OK , do u need monitors , keyboards , mice , speakers , any lighting ?	Ques
1.2.14	God , what am i forgetting ?	Ques
1.2.15	I 've only got 801 dollars ! !	St
1.2.16	OK , lets upgrade , bring the Video up to a 6800GT .	St
1.2.17	Bring CPU to 3700+ or go with the 3800+ .	St
1.2.18	Double the memory , or bring to 1.5 GB .	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	i would go for a dfi lanparty nforce4 mobo instead for the case i would suggest aspire or thermaltake ... instead of getting 3700+ processor , stick with the 3500+ instead i would go for a nvidia 7800gt .	St
1.4.2	i would also get a good powersupply from antec , enermax , etc that is at least 450 watts .	St
1.4.3	dont use the powersupply that comes with the case	Sug
1.5.1	Idk , I 've looked at all the great PC 's with the ASUS nForce..	St
1.5.2	They seem better , just my opinion .	St
1.5.3	-Ibrahim	St
1.6.1	Hello My subject line is a sort of double entendre since not only have you ''chosen '' an opportune time to upgrade because of industry cycles , but the timing and synchronization of the many timing related resources in PC 's is crucual just like it is to a V12 Ferrari .	St
1.6.2	Out of tune it may still look great but a well-tuned VW might beat it .	St
1.6.3	As for industry cycles and your good fortune , every so often extremely fundamental changes occur such as when the PCI bus was beginning to beat out MCA , VLB , EEISA , and all the other contenders for your main bus to connect peripherals .	St
1.6.4	Presently , multiple fundamental hardware resources and their protocols are poised for change .	St
1.6.5	PCI Express is almost de rigeur on new motherboards and that not only replaces PCI but also the AGP bus .	St
1.6.6	64 bit CPUs as well as dual core CPUs are now locked in as the wave of the future .	St
1.6.7	As these bus speeds rise so must the memory bus and it appears DDR3 will be at least the short term successor .	St
1.6.8	SATA hard drives , cdroms , dvds in fact just about everything is ''going serial '' since the parallel ATA bus is played out and can not muster any more speed/bandwidth , limiting the still greatest PC bottleneck , the hard drive interface , so much so that even SCSI is going serial Why am I talking about cutting edge technologies when you are asking to build a budget PC ? ...	Ques
1.6.9	Because the best deals can be had with technologies that are one or two steps removed from the bleeding edge and especially those technologies or forms that are essentially ''dead ends '' can provide huge savings .	St
1.6.10	Two important examples would be parallel IDE/ATA hard drives and various CPU interfaces such as Socket 754 and Socket 940 .	St
1.6.11	These ''cul de sacs '' are especially important because despite their ''dead end '' status both the technolgies replacing them are yet to be truly beneficial ( just as few games have yet to be written that take full advantage of even DirectX v9a ) as the rest of the industry ( hardware and software ) have yet to catch up and support will continue for many years yet , so you are n't throwing money down a rathole to suffocate mice .	St
1.6.12	For a budget gaming machine one simply can not beat AMD 's 64 bit offerrings and this has nothing to do with brand name loyalty , this is accross the board gaming benchmarks and now a simple widely accepted fact ( sort of like Evolution , despite the uhh jury not being in ) that at any given price point AMD 's 64 bit CPUs kick everything else 's butt and do n't even bother taking names , at least at gaming .	St
1.6.13	That is ratcheted up another notch now that Sempron 64 's are coming out ... . 64 bit CPU 's *well* under $ 200 and some actually under $ 100 .	St
1.6.14	If you search for great deals , especially if you do n't mind the rebate hassle , one can build an extremely competitive brand name component PC , including case and power supply , motherboard , ram , video card , hard drives , and CPU , for under $ 1500 .	St
1.6.15	One important upgrade comes with the nVidia 7800 where a single card can keep pace with *two* 6800 's in SLI in many if not most places where it counts for gaming .	St
1.6.16	This is especially noteworthy since two 6800 's , and a motherboard that will support them , can eat up the $ 1500 all by themselves .	St
1.6.17	A particularly good example of a very respectable budget gaming PC , complete with benchmarks , appears in this month 's ''Maximum PC '' magazine .	St
1.6.18	Right now , and for possibly two years yet , all these major changes in PC design make it possible to save fantastic amounts of money while still getting a great PC that even has some upgrade path left , considering for example that it is a safe bet that high quality AGP video cards will continue to be made and sold , despite their ''dead end '' nature , for a few years yet .	St
1.6.19	The same can be said for parallel ATA drives that can now be had on special for as low as 25 cents ( $ 0.25 ) a gig .	St
1.6.20	When you realize that it is still possible to pay a $ 1.00 a gig on a regular basis and consider $ 5000 plus rigs are commonplace , do the math and see that $ 1500 is not an unreasonable amount to hope to buy serious quality for and buying top brand names is not excluded by any means .	St
1.6.21	This is a *great* time to upgrade whether to go all out or on a budget .	St
1.6.22	Jimmy	St
1.7.1	Darn , you hurt me .	St
1.7.2	You make it sound so good , I 'm tempted to dump my 2 gaming rigs to start fresh again .	St
1.7.3	While the technology in my machines is almost 2 years old , I keep up on the latest trends .	St
1.7.4	I 'm still upgrading what I have , when I can afford it .	St
1.7.5	But your well-written report makes me consider the idea of selling them to start on another & quot ; Build Frenzy & quot ; .	St
1.7.6	Good work !	St
1.7.7	Keep it up .	St
1.8.1	Thought I had already replied to this thread , but that post just prompts A LOT OF REPLY DESIRE A ) FarCry , Half-Life 2 , Doom 3 ( if not D3 , Quake4 , the engine itself is able , not sure if D3 however is set to ) and a few others all utilize DirectX 9.0c to the full extent of SM3.0 and FP32 , but that 's only with an NV40 or G70 card , as ATi 's Radeon X series do not support SM3.0/FP32 B ) G70 is not being released on AGP , possibly a 7800nU type model , but GTX is staying on PCIe , Radeon X1800XT is not being released on AGP , want to know why ?	Ques
1.8.2	Because those cards are targetted for the enthusiast market , and the enthusiast market means PCIe is used , so that SMP 3D can be done C ) I have yet to see a legitmate benchmark of a single G70 beating a pair of decent NV40 's , and NV40 SLI does not eat up over $ 1500 ... it 's more like $ 900 , if your buying 512MB 6800 U 's at $ 850/per it 's closer to $ 1900 , but not $ 1500 D ) G70 is not fast enough to take down a pair of 6800GT 's or 6800 Ultra 's in benchmarks , or fillrate , in a few select games which are inable to utilize SLi technology it is able to win , yet at that point it 's more of a comparison of single G70 to single NV40 E ) Socket 940 costs more for a motherboard , and compatable RAM/CPU than Socket 939 ever would , Socket 940 is nowhere near phased out , it 's AMD 's professional grade CPU interface , designed to run toe to toe with Intel 's PGA 603/604 along with Itanium2 , it competes with both admirably F ) Socket 754 is a bad idea because of the single channel RAM , and lack of upgradeability in terms of CPU ( dual core on 754 ai n't gon na happen , it 's nowhere near being in AMD 's roadmaps ) Socket 754 however does have some life left , it 's designed as the value series socket G ) AMD is releasing a new socket next year , M2 , which introduces DDR2 to the Athlon64 H ) There is not a single implementation of DDR3 for a desktop system , and there is not a near-production solution for such a thing , DDR2 has A LOT OF LIFE in it , and the current battle is to get costs , and latencies , DOWN I ) Rambus ' XDR is a viable contender for the next spot as the de facto standard for RAM , as it provides downright head turning performance J ) The hardware side of the industry is at , and moving beyond , DirectX 9.0c at this point , Microsoft is releasing DirectX 10 with Windows Vista in 2006 , but DX10 will be avliable in Public Beta II if I recall correctly K ) DVD and CDROM drives going to SATA is n't to gain speed , it 's because PATA is being abandoned , and SATA provides a few benefits in terms of connection ( it 's hotpluggable for one ) L ) Most of your statements about things lasting for a long time are wrong , the industry is moving AMAZINGLY FAST to catch up to and move ahead of the software world , hardware wise things are on the level and beyond them for current needs , but that 's because we 're basically waiting on a few major releases , such as Microsoft 's Windows Vista , and Atari 's U3 Engine , Software has amazingly long devolopment cycles when your going from scratch , not to mention that most of these software advances M ) At this point i 'm going to stop correcting your post , I 've pointed out the most blatant errors , and anything beyond that would just be a waste of time , your talking out of your *** on almost everything your saying , trying to write it like a school paper , and your suggesting him to cut off his upgrade cycle options just because it saves him $ 5 now , spending less now but having to entirely rebuild in a year to catch up is crap , spend the extra $ 5 now and be ready for the future ... it 's a much better idea	St
1.9.1	nVidia does , Asus produces motherboards and uses the nForce chipset on a few of them ... and yes , the nVidia nForce4 is an excellent chipset	St
1.10.1	haha , sry ...	St
1.10.2	I knew that ( I really did ) just a typo	St
1.11.1	Cyberpower Inc .	St
1.11.2	Setup : X-Crusier Mid-Tower W/ Window , Display , and Fan Control Neon Lights 500W PSU with Fan Control AMD X2 3800+ A8N-SLi nForce 4 1024MB PC3200 Nvidia 7800GT 80GB HDD SATA LG DVD+-R/+-RW + CD-R/RW Dual Layer PCI Modem , Mouse Keyboard , Flash Card Reader , Floppy , XP Pro , 3-Year Warranty TOTAL COST : About $ 1305 That should last a long time..	St
1.11.3	I 've heard many good reviews about this company over at Maximum PC .	St
1.11.4	That price is without shipping , tax.. -Ibrahim	St
1.12.1	Replace that X2 with a A64 4000+ and change that 7800GT to a GTX .	St
1.12.2	You still have some money left over ( this is on newegg.com ) , so change out that 80GB HDD for a WD Raptor ( or two in RAID ) .	St
1.12.3	That 's gon na be a pretty cool machine !	St
1.13.1	For a Budget Gaming System , all your gon na need is a good video card like a Geforce 6600GT and higher .	St
1.13.2	For everything else , just search on the net for cheap + high quality parts .	St
1.13.3	Any audio card like motherboard audio , should be fine .	St
1.13.4	You can go for older CPUs like Athlon XP and early Pentium 4 , just STAY AWAY from Celeron ... trust me !	St
1.13.5	1GB RAM is plenty , since XP does n't take full advantage of RAM above 512MB .	St
1.13.6	A quality power supply and motherboard will keep you free of hardware problems .	St
1.13.7	Does n't matter which case you buy , as long as YOU like it .	St
1.13.8	Hard Drives and Optical Drives do n't matter .	St
1.13.9	Just make sure you keep your case cool and spend money on a good keyboard and mouse , even speakers/headphones to increase your gaming experience .	Sug
1.13.10	When you buy this stuff , make sure the CPU matches the socket of the motherboard and the video card is compatible with the motherboard .	St
1.14.1	Do n't do anything without checking out Cyberpower .	St
1.14.2	Go to www.cyberpowersystem.com and use their custom configurator .	St
1.14.3	I searched and searched for months on the internet for the best Gaming PC and I had an almost unlimited budget but wanted to make sure I got the best machine for my money .	St
1.14.4	Forget Dell , forget Widow , forget Alienware , especially forget New Egg , Cyber Power has all the latest Tech. , 5X 's the selection on every component , and the prices are far and away the best .	St
1.14.5	Go AMD 64 Dual Core , not as good as FX series but keeps you on budget , go ASUS Premium or Deluxe if you want to save $ $ , you want SLI capability if not for now definitely for future upgrade .	St
1.14.6	Without any doubt in my mind you get the most powerful gaming pc for your money at Cyber Power .	St
1.14.7	Not enough space to tell you about my machine , but I tried the same configuration on 9 other sites , most of them did n't even offer what I was able to get at Cyber Power and those that did cost a minimum of $ 700 more .	St
1.14.8	Oh yeah , service and Tech support rivals the best of them as well .	St
1.14.9	Enough said ! ! !	St
1.14.10	!	St
1.15.1	why not go to a 7800gtx ?	Sug
1.16.1	While I am personally a fan of building my own systems ( and I use Linux which is open source , ostensibly free ) , there are other benefits of buying from CyberPower or another similar company and that is that you get a warranty which is always good , and you are ensured that at least your OS is legal , which is also always good .	St
1.16.2	If the prices are even close , then buying prebuilt is a good solution .	St
1.17.1	either that your just inable to take the time to build your own machine cyberpower uses lower end PSU's/cases and has some horrible reviews with tech support about them , same for ibuypower newegg is far and away better for building your own , saying Cyber power has more selection is crap , they do n't , they are n't a parts retailer , newegg is a parts retailer , there is a difference Newegg is like the Nordstrom of computer hardware stores Cyberpower is like the McDonalds of computer OEM builders if that helps put it into perspective , Newegg has amazing in house tech support , but all they do is sell hardware , they do n't manufacture anything , do n't give me that whole shpeel that Alienware would love to throw out , about how building your own = more hours on the phone with techsupport , unless your a totally lost newbie , your not gon na have issues ( i 've seen people who hardly know a thing about hardware re-build their machines with no problems , so no , it is n't that hard ) they do n't have more selection , and they do n't have the latest technology , you sound like an advertisement bot ...	St
1.18.1	Perhaps you should read the original question being asked .	St
1.18.2	The person was looking for a budget gaming system on a $ 1500 allowance .	St
1.18.3	If they had the time and the knowledge for building their own system then I 'm sure they would not have asked for help .	St
1.18.4	I am a finance guy not a computer guy , I give people large loans not large ego 's .	St
1.18.5	Not everybody has the time or the knowledge to build their own system , that is why companies like Dell and Alienware are making millions of $ $ $ a year selling overpriced under valued computer systems .	St
1.18.6	I 'm sorry you disagree , but like I said , I spent several months comparing , researching , and configuring and found Cyber Power to be the best solution for Gamers to get the best bang for their buck .	St
1.18.7	Newegg was very good , however when I compared my configuration with the same name brand components Newegg came up short on price , they were exactly $ 847 more than what I paid at Cyber Power and & quot ; you could take that to the bank & quot ; .	St
1.18.8	Not to mention I got a monitor , and a THX certified 6 piece speaker sytem with my configuration that was not included in the price from your beloved Newegg ! ! !	St
1.18.9	I 'm sorry if offended anybody out there but sometimes you Techie 's out there sound real arrogant when all someone with less knowledge than you is trying to do is get some help .	St
1.19.1	doubtful , your the one telling him do n't do anything but cyber power , your basically telling him he has two choices , your almighty cyberpower , or to get scamed on prices THX certified 6 piece sound , can be had for around $ 80 and most people already have a monitor they are ok with keeping I was merely pointing out that your statement appeared to be an advertisement for cyberpower , and I 'm telling you that cyberpower uses lowerend PSU 's and RAM compared to newegg , and offers many less options not everyone can build their own machine , and even those who can ask for help , usually just to double check before hitting submit and watching $ 1000- $ 5000 be siphoned from their account faster than they could count it out in units of $ 500 Presenting my view point and suggesting him something , along with stating that your sounding like an advertisement bot , is not in anyway limiting his choices or hurting him , telling him his only & quot ; real & quot ; option is cyberpower , is basically trying to force him into buying cyberpower	St
1.20.1	So tell me whats the difference between ibuypower and cyberpower ?	Ques
1.21.1	About 12.3 Miles http : //img361.imageshack.us/img361/1104/power2lg.jpg	St
1.22.1	very funny as well	St
