ive bought several computers over a 20 year period.
if you think youre only going to buy once, your kidding yourself.
buy the most bang for the buck.
technology changes and with that comes demand.
if you wait, youll never buy, and then give up on the chance of the computing world as we know it.
like email phishing, viruses, hackers etc...just kidding.
