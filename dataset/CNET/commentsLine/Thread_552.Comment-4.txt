yes you have the situation correct.
so, if i buy another wireless print server (linksys wireless print server)like the one i already have (802.11g) and connect to a compatable printer (epson r300) or (hp 5440) i can print wireless downstairs from my wireless network upstairs as a stand alone?
thanks for the advise.
