I am not sure because i cannot find a report on it. Please answer my question if you know and if it doesn't, please tell me any programs that you know it works with. Thanks

It doesn't list the DVC-100 anywhere in the downloads area; however, I would think that perhaps the 150 USB drivers would work if the 100 is also USB. I've used my Dazzle DVC-150 with other video capturing programs, such as Power VCR-DVD II and even my ATI AIW software as well as the Studio 8 programs that came with the device. I preferred Power VCR-DVD over all of them. TONI
