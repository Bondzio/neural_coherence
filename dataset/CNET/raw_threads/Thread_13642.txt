Anybody else have experience with this or have suggestions on what can be done so my wireless connection is not disrupted? Sometimes it comes back automatically, but other times I must manually reset the modem. The modem is a Netgear WRN85RT (I think), either way, last time I checked there were no firmware updates available for it. The wired connection is not interrupted, only the wireless. Hope someone can help.
