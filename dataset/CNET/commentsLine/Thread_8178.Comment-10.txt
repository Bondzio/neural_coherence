i'm sorry, i don't know a lot about computers so i don't know what you mean when you say &quot;open the linksys configuration tool&quot;.
if i can get there, i think i can follow your instructions from there.
also, my desktop never has a problem disconnecting from the internet, it is just my wireless laptop that does this.
if you can instruct me on how to set whatever you want me to set to full duplex, i will try that as well.
any help you could give me would be greatly appreciated.
