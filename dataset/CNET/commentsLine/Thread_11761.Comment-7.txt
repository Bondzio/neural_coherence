ok, i enabled the guest account, and made sure it was added to the shared folder's permissions.
still get the same error.
it seems that if the wide-ipen guest account can't access it, even if i added a specific user and allowed the permissions, it still wouldn't work.
it (the xp laptop) see's the computer in explorer, so i know that it's possibly not a router issue blocking it, although there may be a setting in the router that i'm not aware of that needs to be changed?
i understand the implications of using the guest account, and may tighten up security once i get it working in general.
