6721	6	110301	1254655	1254201	aditya_nrg	6/21/05 12:13 AM	1.11931278E12	details	i m using a direct crosover cable... win xp on both mcs zone alram on comp1 which connects to internet... no firewall on the other mc... got the cables from the market... i hv shared printers and set some folders to be shared the problem is... COMP1-&gt;COMP2 comp1 shows comp2 in its work gp...but wen i try to acces it by double clicking it...says network path not accesible...and comp2 does not show comp1 at all in the work gp computers...so i guess the problem is not wiht cable and comp1.
