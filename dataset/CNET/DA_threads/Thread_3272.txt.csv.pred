1.1.1	I have an old Dell Inspiron 1501 which I love because it has Windows XP on it and I don't want to upgrade again.	St
1.1.2	However, I am unable to play many games and I just noticed that most of the games I have bought say it needs Pentium III or faster processor.	St
1.1.3	I can't figure out any of the information that I have looked at for the Turion processor but maybe it's not fast enough to play games?	St
1.1.4	How can I solve this problem?	St
1.1.5	Thanks for your help--Pups	St
1.2.1	The CPU was willing but the GPU was weak.	St
1.2.2	Let's keep to games 2009 and prior and they should be fine.	St
1.2.3	But do tell what graphics card this machine has.	Ques
