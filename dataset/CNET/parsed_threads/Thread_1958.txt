<s> I'm using a sony dvd model ddu1621. </s>
<s> When i load an image file of a dvd and run it, it runs fine. </s>
<s> Any idea what's the problem? </s>
<s> Yes the DVD may be bad. </s>
<s> Take it to another machine and try it, or try another DVD in your machine. </s>
<s> That isolates your IDE port and cable and the DVD. </s>
<s> Since it is not the DVD's it must be the drive or the connections. </s>
<s> Presumes you haven't loaded some sort of virus. </s>
<s> This is a common issue when an OS like Windows is installed, but the installer (person) doesn't install motherboard drivers, the latest BIOS or more. </s>
