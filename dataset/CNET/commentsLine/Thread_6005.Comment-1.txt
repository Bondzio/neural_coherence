i about fell off my chair when i came across this review this morning:  we ordered a pc from alienware amost 8 weeks ago.
it was supposed to arrive 8/28.
we finally got fed up and cancelled the order yesterday, 10/6.
the number of excuses alieware can come up with as to why they haven't built and shipped your pc is mind boggling.
i can only hope we don't have to contact the florida state attorney general and the federal trade commision to get the $3400 charge removed from our credit card.
cnet, stop stop stop stop promoting alienware!!!
they are turning your store ratings into a joke.
4 stars for alienware, gimme a break.
