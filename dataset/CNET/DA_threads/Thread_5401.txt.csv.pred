1.1.1	Hey everyone.	St
1.1.2	Here's my deal.	St
1.1.3	I use Logitech X-540, http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-X-540-5-1-Speaker-System/dp/B000JJM8XE/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1216074034&sr=8-1 , for my surround sound setup.	St
1.1.4	It's not much, but I don't need anything more.	St
1.1.5	I have a quick question though.	St
1.1.6	Is there something like this product, http://www.amazon.com/Console-Adapter-Convert-Plugs-Single/dp/B0006U3ACY/ref=pd_bbs_2?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1216073334&sr=8-2 , but rather than the red and white RCA cables, it would be an optical audio cable that's converting to the 3 3.5mm cables?	St
1.1.7	Or is there anyway to convert an optical audio cable to that kind of output?	St
1.1.8	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	Optical = digital.	St
1.2.2	3.5 mm = analog.	St
1.3.1	...I guess that means it can't be done?	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
