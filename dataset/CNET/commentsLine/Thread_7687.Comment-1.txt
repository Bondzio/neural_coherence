i have a hard drive inside of a usb external hard drive enclosure.
i dont know what model it is, but its a 200gb seagate that was originally in a hewlett packard laptop.
the other day it started making the clicking sound ive heard you never want to hear.
well i have tons of precious files on that hard drive... any ideas on what i can do to possibly recover all if not some of the files?
