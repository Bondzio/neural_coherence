you probably have a bad stick of ram.
try the new sticks one at a time and see if you can isolate which one is the problem.
i'm guessing that you see a blue screen flash up really quickly right before the computer restarts, after you see the windows xp logo on the screen.
this is because windows xp is set to reboot on a blue screen automatically by default.
you can disable this option on your system panel in the control panel, so you can read the error message.
anyways, try the new sticks one at a time.
also try the sticks in different slots, because sometimes the slot on the motherboard has a problem.
hope this helps.
