it doesn't appear to be the jumper settings.
both the hard drives are on the primary controller on cable select, as are the 2 dvd drives on the secondary controller.
it seems to be an intermittent problem, as all drives are currently connected and everything seems fine, but eventually, it could bsod since i'm using the 2nd hdd for the page file.
other times, i'd boot and it will give me the problem.
as a temporary solution, i've moved my page file back to my main drive, but are there any other solutions short of backing up my data and getting a new drive?
