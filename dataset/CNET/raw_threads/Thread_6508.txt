I already have 2x2gb of 1600 DDR3 in my FoxConn X48 motherboard, buut I'm not sure if I should be worried about compatibility issues between the new sticks and the existing ones. I've read mixed answers from &quot;Throw any type in, as long as it fits in your MoBo&quot; to &quot;If they have different timings your MoBo could get fried.&quot; So I figured I'd ask around.

I'm not looking at any particular sticks of RAM right now, as I don't know what I *can* look for. Current RAM (Not over-clocked): Brand - G.SKILL Model - F3-12800CL7D-4GBHZ Type - 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM Capacity - 4GB (2 x 2GB) Speed - DDR3 1600 (PC3 12800) Cas Latency - 7 Timing - 7-7-7-18 Voltage - 1.9V Heat Spreader - Yes As for my Motherboard: Memory-wise: Number of Memory Slots - 4?240pin Memory Standard - DDR3 1600 Maximum Memory Supported - 8GB Channel Supported - Dual Channel It's easy enough to find matching type, speeds and capacities. BUT I'm not sure about the importance of CAS Latency, Timing, or Voltage.

The greater the difference ...the greater the chance of minor problems. Don't be too disappointed if you don't see an noticeable speed increase...adding RAM beyond the sweet spot just doesn't make your PC move faster. Maybe there are other upgrade options you could explore.. VAPCMD
