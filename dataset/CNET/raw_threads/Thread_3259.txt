My core requirements are seeing photos, videos/movies, play cd/dvd, songs, easy switch on/off, etc... I am not at all interested in iPad.... I have seen portable dvd players but no where I am getting good feedbacks for these devices. So guys, please suggest me some device which can full fill these requirements. I will appreciate your quick response. Thanks. Prateek
