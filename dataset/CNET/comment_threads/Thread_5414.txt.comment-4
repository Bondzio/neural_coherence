The only item I see to a bottleneck for GAMERS is that GeForce FX 5200-256 video card.
Look at www.tomshardware.com and while it's better than what we had years ago, it's still at the bottom of the heap.
i.e.
a &quot;value&quot; card.
You can save yourself time and money if you just picked out a nice video card.
That will give you the biggest BANG.
