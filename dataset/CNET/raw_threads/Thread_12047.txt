I have 2 gig of RAM and a dual core AMD processor, yet when I print a document the printer queue seems to cause my mouse to jump. Is there a way I can install some sort of print spooler that will give me 100% of my computers resources back to me ASAP?

Go to the Brother site and look for updated drivers. 2. Look for a device conflict. Control Panel, System, Hardware, Device Manager. With the printer turned on, click the mouse and other point devices + sign and double click the mouse. Click the resources tab. If there's a conflict, options to correct this will be displayed.
