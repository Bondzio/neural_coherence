Although it was previously overclocked to 3.2 by its previous owner so that could be the problem but i don't know if he had the same problems with audio. Also the audio codec is realtech AC97 Im using directx 9.0c, audio driver version 5.10.0.6200, audio controller sis 7012, and AC97 codec ALC655 its a 6 channel card and when i change either the line in or mic port to a speaker i can get sound as if my computers speakers were the rear or center speakers. however this only gives me sound to windows and certain games as i play Savage and it either doesn't support surround sound or i haven't got it configured right. Any help would be appreciated.....I'll try anything other information: im using two speakers and a sub. the speakers connect to the sub and there is AV into it for sound from TV e.t.c but i have it to my computer using a cord that converts it. I also tried reinstalling XP onto another Hdd but that didn't work. I think i just need to buy a new sound card.........do I?

Sometimes it all works, another boot and it's &quot;what happened.&quot; Go back to stock settings and try again, however you can lose parts when overclocking so be ready to pop for cards or boards.

For some, it appears the goal is reaching the highest clock speeds...vice running the PC for it's intended use. VAPCMD

Ultra Cool makes a 3.5&quot; x 5.25&quot; frame with an 80MM or 92MM fan called the UC-002. So it fits a 3.5&quot; bay or 5.25&quot; bay and can make a big difference on the HDD temp. Good Luck VAPCMD
