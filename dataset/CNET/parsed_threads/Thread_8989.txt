<s> wen i m trying to ping the other computer even that doesnt work..request timed out </s>
<s> such as: 1) The physical nature of your network, wired/wireless?, broadband/router? </s>
<s> 2) Firewalls anyone? </s>
<s> 3) Who made the cables(in a wired LAN of course)? </s>
<s> 4) Anything shared? </s>
<s> i m using a direct crosover cable... win xp on both mcs zone alram on comp1 which connects to internet... no firewall on the other mc... got the cables from the market... i hv shared printers and set some folders to be shared the problem is... COMP1-&gt;COMP2 comp1 shows comp2 in its work gp...but wen i try to acces it by double clicking it...says network path not accesible...and comp2 does not show comp1 at all in the work gp computers...so i guess the problem is not wiht cable and comp1. </s>
<s> i found the soln.. the firewall was the problem now everythings fine </s>
