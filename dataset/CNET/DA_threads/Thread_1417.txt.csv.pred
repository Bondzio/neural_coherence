1.1.1	My parents have an eMachines desktop which was working fine until a couple weeks ago when Windows XP started shutting down almost as soon as they turned it on .	St
1.1.2	Sometimes it completes the startup and is on for a few minutes before it shuts down .	St
1.1.3	Other times it starts shutting down before the startup is complete .	St
1.1.4	What 's really bizarre is that it also started coming on by itself after being off for several days .	St
1.1.5	They had to unplug it to get it to stop booting up in the middle of the night .	St
1.1.6	Anyone ever seen this problem before ?	Ques
1.2.1	The first thing I do is remove the cover to see if the heatsinks are still where they belong and then I do the yearly dusting and cleaning .	St

1.5.5	If there is no surge protection , get some as possible outside AC line glitches can reek havoc on a pc 's psu .	St
