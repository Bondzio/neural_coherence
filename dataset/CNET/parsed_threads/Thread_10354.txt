<s> I am needing to purchase a hard drive enclosure. </s>
<s> My drive will be the Western Digital Caviar SE16, 250GB, 7200RPM, SATA II, 3.5''. </s>
<s> I am thinking of getting the Addonics AE5SACSUF. </s>
<s> Their website is &lt; http://www.addonics.com/products/enclosures/ae5idecsu2f.asp &gt;. </s>
<s> This enclosure has a Oxford 911 chipset. </s>

<s> 1.) </s>
<s> Has anyone used the enlosure above? </s>
<s> (If you have see questions 2, 3, 4, and 5). </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> Just not me. </s>
<s> 2.) </s>
<s> Does it heat up? </s>
<s> Absolutely. </s>
<s> The drive emits about 20 Watts so it will heat up. </s>
<s> That's quite normal and expected. </s>
<s> 3.) </s>
<s> Does the drive stay in tight? </s>
<s> The unit I saw was fine. </s>
<s> But we used the mounting screws. </s>
<s> Can you explain why this is a concern? </s>
<s> 4.) </s>
<s> Does it have any heat problems? </s>
<s> The one I saw was working so between that and my unit I'll write that as long as the fan works, no. </s>
<s> 5.) </s>
<s> Is the enclosure loud/noisy? </s>
<s> How good is your hearing? </s>
<s> 6.) </s>
<s> Has anyone tried Macally enclosure? </s>
<s> They have a new SATA II enclosure with no fan. </s>
<s> For 3.5 inch drives the only case I'd look at without a fan so far is the &quot;METAL GEAR BOX&quot; (google.com) It's construction helps get the heat out. </s>

<s> Any opinions/facts? </s>

<s> This question is telling. </s>
<s> I take it you had a bum unit sometime? </s>

<s> )Any recommendation on a brand name enclosure that has SATA I and II, a fan, quiet, fast, good chipset? </s>
<s> Just one question. </s>
<s> Why would a drive enclosure need a chipset if I connect with SATA? </s>
<s> Unless you need to connect with USB 2. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, Bob </s>
<s> like it's an ATA enclosure which has a chipset plus an SATA to IDE converter. </s>
<s> All things considered, might be better to get an SATA enclosure....no adapter required or an ATA IDE drive and enclosure and not have to pay the premium for SATA to IDE converter. </s>
<s> VAPCMD PS...Like your response to question one ! </s>
<s> What enclosure do you have that is very similar? </s>
<s> What model number? </s>
