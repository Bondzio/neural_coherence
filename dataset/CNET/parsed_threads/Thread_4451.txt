<s> Okay, I've had it with my Epson C80 and I'm looking for a new printer starting from scratch. </s>
<s> The Epson self destructed because I didn't use it enough and it's design is as bad as its inks are good. </s>
<s> Clearly, print quality alone, Epson would be it IMHO. </s>
<s> However, I'm now taking two other points into consideration: ink economy and maintenance. </s>
<s> I want a printer that doesn't jam easily and I'm looking at the Canon PIXMA iP4000. </s>
<s> Of course I'm also open to anything else that gets a strong thumbs up, so recommendations would be appreciated. </s>

<s> An Epson C80 would be some number of years old. </s>
<s> If you feel that printers should last longer than what's on the (ink printer) market today is not worthy of your desires. </s>
<s> I'd look at color laser since it does not have an ink drying issue and I'm getting 5+ years from such in office settings. </s>

<s> But you can't get photo quality or anything even near from a color laser, can you? </s>
<s> We have a high-priced one at work and the output looks terrible. </s>
<s> There are no subtleties in color and the color overlapping is just a tiny bit off. </s>
<s> Given the design problems of the C80, do you think the Canon would be any better? </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> The models you've noted last for just a few years. </s>
<s> You want more. </s>
<s> While the laser you have doesn't do photo, the current class of lasers is much better and doesn't have the ink drying issue or the short 2 to 3 year lifespan. </s>
<s> There was not a design problem in the C80. </s>
<s> But you wanted something like a refrigerator. </s>
<s> Something that just works for 7 plus years. </s>
<s> Again, any consumer ink printer will not satisfy what I've read in your postings. </s>

<s> Hi Confed, I am a printer engineer, and think that your office kit needs calibrating... the output is usually pretty good. </s>
<s> I don't like Canon Inkjets, partly because if there is a quality problem and you remove the ink cartridge, it can take up to 10 cleaning cycles (with the wastage that entails) to get it to print again. </s>
<s> I much prefer HP or Lexmark. </s>
<s> Bear in mind that due to the nature of my job I only see the problem kit, and I see far more Canons... </s>
