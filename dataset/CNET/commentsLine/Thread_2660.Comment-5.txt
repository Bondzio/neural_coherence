to all who have shared their knowledge with my pc problems.......i wanna say thanks.
i still have a few questions and am looking (now don't laugh) for a pc buddy that i can go to whenever an issue arises.
for information on my system, you can review it under ''my products'' i have questions about the system's bios and how to change/modify it, plus a host of other operating do's and you clicked what!.
one of my short terms goals is just to sit back and read cnet's forums rather than be in the forum.. once again thanks for all the great advice and the time you spent to comment..... dennis
