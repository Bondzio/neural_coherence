I believe the problem may be with the USB ports, but I have tried everything I can think of to fix it. The only other option I have left is to buy a powered USB hub. Does anyone have any ideas? I am using a Dell Inspiron 8600 and Windows XP. The USB ports are 2.0.

I don't think it is your USB ports - I had the problem on my Dell and then on my Toshieba Tecra - where I plug in my device but the Zen software does not see it - but Napster sees it. With some (or perhaps all and I never noticed) USB drivers, you have to use the same port that you used when you installed the device. But I think your problem is just a Creative problem. I don't have the problem with other MP3 players that I have (iRiver) and I dont' have it with other USB devices I use on my laptop.
