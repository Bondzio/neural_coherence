that other guy gave that drivers for it are available.
the part number should be listed on the webcam or on the driver cd/dvd, if not check the settings program within all programs.
some times drivers aren't created/designed correctly so they don't work.
contact this site for assistance.
one last note try totally uninstalling the driver before you install those available from this site.
this will provide a &quot;clean&quot; install of the driver.
over wrighting them sometimes causes trouble.
a question do you like the webcam when it works?
how is the hires?
is it really clear?
