1.1.1	Just built a new computer .	St
1.1.2	It 's my 5th one so I 'm not a newbie in doing this .	St
1.1.3	I am having a strange problem though .	St
1.1.4	Here it goes : Built the computer and installed the OS and everything was fine .	St
1.1.5	The following day when I came to use the PC I touched it , got a small static shock , which then shut down the computer .	St
1.1.6	I was quite alarmed , so took the machine apart and checked my mobo install and the front of the case USB ports ( heard this might cause this ) .	St
1.1.7	I then restarted the machine , created some static , touched the computer and it did not shut down .	St
1.1.8	Success !	St
1.1.9	Unfortunately it did n't end there .	St
1.1.10	The PC ran through the night and when I came to use it the next night I touched the computer with my leg and it shut off .	St
1.1.11	But there was no shock .	St
1.1.12	I then rebooted and touched the case , pushed the case , etc .	St
1.1.13	and it was fine .	St
1.1.14	A number of hours later I touched the case and it shut off !	St
1.1.15	This is crazy !	St
1.1.16	Any ideas as what the problem might be ?	Ques
1.1.17	I 'm thinking perhaps something to do with heat , but I 'm not even sure how to proceed ... . Any suggestions appreciated !	St
1.2.1	has a problem .	St
1.2.2	Seems that your third wire ground is not continuous from the computer to the ground in the Main box .	St
1.2.3	The erratic shut down times are simply when you have enough of a static charge .	St
1.2.4	The path of the current [ which can be momentarily high ] should flow with extremely low resistance and voltage level in the ground wiring , through the ground path .	St
1.2.5	Also could be caused by a ground wire problem within the Power Supply itself .	St
1.2.6	A UPS or surge protector in the line ? ? ?	Ques
1.2.7	Is your mobo properly grounded to the mounting plate ? ?	Ques
1.2.8	?	Ques
1.3.1	HI , NOW SINCE ACCORDING TO WHAT YOU ARE SAYING THAT THE COMPUTER JUST SHUTS DOWN AUTOMATICALLY OR ABRUPTLY , U MIGHT WANT TO CHECK THE PROCESSOR FAN AND HEATSINK ASSEMBLY FOR SEATING PROBLEMS .	St
1.3.2	MAKE SURE THAT THE FAN AND HEATSINK ASSEMBLY YOU HAVE INSTALLED ARE OF GOOD QUALITY AND IT IS SEATED PROPERLY OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT ENCOUNTER OVERHEATING PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE ALSO .	St
1.4.1	consider turning off the all caps .	St
1.4.2	It is considered to be rude and yelling in internet communication .	St
1.5.1	Static electricty can do crazy things and it NEED NOT be a sparky amount as seen by many .	St
1.5.2	Since , this problem repeats alot , at least touch some other grounded device/metal/static ( touch ) pad to discharge yourself .	St
1.5.3	Then proceed to the computer and continue on .	St
1.5.4	If you walk across a rug , carpet or wear staticly clothes that alone will generate the ESD needed and plaque you .	St
1.5.5	I suggest besides the above get a secerarty 's work floor mat used in office 's and place under your chair .	St
1.5.6	Many a mat has a metal contact button to route static to grd .	St
1.5.7	plug of AC outlet or get that type of mat .	St
1.5.8	Remember static can be in the thousands of volts range and the simple power ON/OFF swith only needs 5V to work .	St
1.5.9	These are simple suggestions and it maybe entirely something else , but came to mind as this is the season for such problems .	St
1.5.10	Also , understand previous static damage if the cause of problems could have comprised the system and its now too readily ease to shutdown for whatever reason as an end result .	St
1.5.11	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.6.1	Yeah i have the same.. well i would'nt call it a problem .	St
1.6.2	It 's likely to happen to any ones computer .	St
1.6.3	Just becareful do n't be going ahead and restarting your comp with your fingear cause that can really mess up your computer .	St
