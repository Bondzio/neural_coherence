<s> My 4 month old dog just made two holes on my SanDisk Extreme III SD 1GB card..and when I place it on the usb reader, it states &quot;Please insert a disk into drive X&quot;. </s>
<s> When I place it on my digital camera, it said the SD card is locked, So I moved the lil lock thing on the sd card and nothing. </s>
<s> It is physically unlocked, but the Canon camera says the sd card is locked. </s>
<s> I don't think it's possible for me to run data recovery since the media card is not even being read. </s>
<s> The two bite marks it has don't look THAT bad, I honestly thought it was going to work, although you can see the green chip inside, but no such luck. </s>
<s> Any possible solutions to maybe unlocking my sd card? </s>
<s> or is it completely ruined? </s>
<s> PC specs : Windows XP, 512MB Ram, Pentium III 800mhz </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> As Vapcmd implies try contacting the manufacturer, see what developes. </s>
<s> In such small locks, the sliding part internal to that contact themselves may have broken off. </s>
<s> It still remains at its position on the &quot;locked&quot; setting, physically. </s>
<s> Small tools if a physical impairment, access it and move if off to the unlocked position. </s>
<s> This is only a guess any actual damage and warranty to replace are at the makers discretion. </s>
<s> Remember, it not their fault your dog bit it, sorry. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
