i have a new dell latitude which replaced an older dell latitude.
my old dell had no problems connecting wirelessly to my router.
the new one connects then a few minutes later locks up the router.
i have to reboot the router for it to start working again.
its using windows xp professionl service pack 2. if i plug into the wired connection it works fine.
it also connects fine wirelessly at work.
any ideas?
