I opened my second box of the second HP1905B, and yet to discover again another quality issue.
There is a large of what seems to be a dust particle stuck behind the LCD membrane and it is in the middle of the screen.
Baiscally whenever there is white, you see a gray dot of dust that cannot be removed.
Needless to say, the two monitors I have are returning to the store.
I will get two HP F1905B though, just to give them a last chance.
I like the clarity of the image, and it is a shame that I had QA issues 2/2.
I will keep you posted.
