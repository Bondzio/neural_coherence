<s> I have just recently installed Windows XP Pro on one of my computers. </s>
<s> I cannot connect to other computers on my network. </s>
<s> I have run the network setup wizard many times, and the computer is on the same workgroup as the others. </s>
<s> Also, I cannot access the internet. </s>
<s> The version of Windows I installed did not include SP 1 or 2. </s>
<s> The network adapter is 3Com Etherlink XL 10/100 PCI For Comple PC Management NIC (3C905C-TX), according to Device Manager. </s>
<s> System Specs: AMD K6-2 300mhz 128mb RAM ATi Rage 128 Pro 4gb HDD w/ Windows 40gb HDD extra storage </s>
<s> Normally I find that reinstalling the network card driver solves that problem. </s>
<s> Look for the latest version out there. </s>
<s> I'd advise you to restart the other computers you have on your network (don't ask why!). </s>
<s> Hopefully you should get some network connectivity. </s>
<s> If the other comp's are ok then don't update their drivers! </s>
<s> Try run&gt; cmd &gt; ipconfig /release then in cmd do a ipconfig /renew If you have limited access then try to change your proxy settings to automatically detect. </s>
<s> Uninstall your Anti-Spyware Programs. </s>
<s> I was trying to access the internet on one of my other computers, and I couldn't. </s>
<s> I then noticed on the computer that was having problems connecting to the network said there is an IP conflict. </s>
<s> I shut down that computer and the internet worked fine on the other. </s>
<s> So, to fix this do I just do ipconfig/renew? </s>
<s> Thanks, it was an IP conflict, I had to change my IP address because it conflicted with the IP of another of my computers. </s>
<s> I currently have both computers running and the internet and network works fine now. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
