I am thinking about building my own PC in the near future (once I save up enough money).
I don't want to be spending a ridiculous amount of money on this computer, but I was wondering if, I want to run PC games on Max settings for example, will this make my PC too expensive?
It's probably a dumb question, but I am a beginner here, and am just interested in building a great PC!
So, my more specific question is, will I need a GTX 680 GPU?
What are other alternatives that will produce great results so I can run games on maxed settings?
Thanks for any help!
