there's places like gizmodo or engadget that have wide varieties of tech stuff as well as low end mac or 9 to 5 mac for apple stuff.
mac world... mac os x hints... lots and lots of places.
i mean if you google stuff like this, you're sure to find some info somewhere.
the joy of corporate giants like apple leaking info to us users on the net... i love that.
reading about rumored stuff when you know it's probably true or close to it is nice.
hope this fills you in a little.
