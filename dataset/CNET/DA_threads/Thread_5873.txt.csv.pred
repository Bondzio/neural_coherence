1.1.1	Hi, I recently bought a Dell Insprion Laptop and went to get the Verizon Wireless card for internet.	St
1.1.2	Much to my dismay I learned that my new laptop did not come equipped with a PC Card Slot, instead it is loaded with an Express Card Slot.	St
1.1.3	I am wondering if there is a PC Card reader that I can hook up to my laptop either through the Express Card slot or via a USB Port.	St
1.1.4	I really appreciate the help!	Polite
1.2.1	I just ran into the same compatability issue...all this time later, and I'm surprised no one else has replied to you on this.	St
1.2.2	I recently bought a Dell XPS laptop and went to my nearest Best Buy today for the great deal they've got running for the Verizon PC5740.	St
1.2.3	In calling Verizon twice in the last 2 weeks to ask about the service, plus stopped into 2 seperate stores, no one mentioned an issue like this existed, even though I'd told them the model computer I'd bought.	St
1.2.4	Every Verizon store and authorized retailer is happy to sell you the card, but no one said there might be a compatability issue.	St
1.2.5	According to Dell, all of the PC Card makers are updating their cards this June...which means, if we're lucky, they'll be available for Christmas!!	St
1.2.6	I'm really ticked off that no one mentioned this problem ahead of time.	St
1.2.7	How could this have gone on so long without the word getting out?	St
1.2.8	?	Ques
1.3.1	Type EVDO ROUTER into google.com to see how to get around this one.	St
1.3.2	But there are no known EVDO EXPRESS cards so it's time to call and ask for the laptop to be exchanged for one with a PC-Card slot.	St
1.3.3	They get this all the time.	St
1.3.4	Bob	St
1.4.1	I'm having the same problem, I waited several months and have searched endlessly and still not one single product has come out that works with the Express card.	St
1.4.2	So my new dell 1505 laptop can't use my 108 mbps wireless notebook adapter and is slower then my 5 year old laptop.	St
1.4.3	What a scam, Dell should have told me when I bought it.	St
1.5.1	http://www.everythingusb.com/elan_u111_usb_card_reader.html	St
1.6.1	USB to PC-Card adapters are still in their infancy with very few functional configurations.	St
1.6.2	Bob	St
1.7.1	Dell Computer gave me the name of a British company that Dell had previously referred its customers to for this sort of adapter, but said the company no longer produces them.	St
1.7.2	I found 2 locations that still sell the adapter, but it was to the tune of $198.00!	St
1.7.3	Just a little too much for the convienence.	St
1.7.4	So I wait with anticipation for Verizon the launch their service's ExpressCard...	St
1.8.1	I too just recently purchased a new laptop (HP) and no where on the outside box packaging does it state &quot;not compatible with type II pc cards.&quot; So, I assumed my purchase would accomodate Cingular's wireless network card.	St
1.8.2	After a lot of complaining on the phone with the Cingular customer service person, I was connected with a Cingular tech person.	St
1.8.3	He told me that they were starting to get complaints about the lack of compatability (new laptops don't have both types of slots to accomodate this transition.	St
1.8.4	)He was very nice and helpful.	St
1.8.5	My next call was to HP to explain my situation and they told me the express card slot was the &quot;next generation&quot; of slots for laptops.	St
1.8.6	Great, but in the meantime I must wait for the card slot makers to develop a new sized card to accomodate express sized slots?	St
1.8.7	Cingular uses a PC card manufactured by &quot;Novatel&quot; located in San Diego.	St
1.8.8	Novatel provided the following informative update; &quot;Novatel Wireless is at an advanced stage in the development of ExpressCards which should be on the market in 2006H2.&quot; &quot;In addition to getting regulatory approval, each of the service providers must approve the new cards on their networks.	St
1.8.9	Please contact your service provider(s) to find out when they are going to approve and sell the new cards.&quot; &quot;Your question to the service providers will help them to understand the demand and help them prioritize their approval process of the ExpressCards.&quot; Excellent advise!	Sug
1.8.10	In the meantime, I am stuck in a technology time warp with a new laptop but no wireless connectivity!	St
1.8.11	Personally, (in my case) the information provided to the consumer on the label and packaging by HP should CLEARLY state &quot;Not compatible with Type II PC Cards.&quot;	St
1.9.1	I note that the initial question was asked back in March.	St
1.9.2	In the beginning of May I wanted to buy a new laptop using Verizon's broadband service.	St
1.9.3	I decided on a Dell laptop.	St
1.9.4	I called Verizon and specifically asked if their card is OK in the Dell laptop, and the sales rep assured me it was OK. And here it's 2 months after Verizon knew about the Express Card problem, and the Verizon sales rep STILL gave me the wrong information that their card would fit into my Dell.	St
1.9.5	So much for Verizon customer service...	St
1.10.1	just as a heads up, I've been having to deal with this myself for the past month.	St
1.10.2	their current time frame is ''anywhere from 1 to 2 months'' on the express cards.	St
1.10.3	supposedly they had problems and are delaying them even longer.	St
1.10.4	they'll supposedly have an ''update'' on the time frame tomorrow at some point.	St
1.11.1	Most of today's new laptops hav ean internal card already installed.	St
1.11.2	If it doesn't, you can buy one, the port is a standard one and there are different brands.	St
1.11.3	They are really easy to install.	St
1.11.4	Just got one for my Dell Inspiron B130 for $15.00 at EBAY.	St
1.11.5	Hope this helps.	St
1.12.1	The problem I have been having is not with the card used to connect to a wireless network within a house, an office, or a Starbucks.	St
1.12.2	You're right, that's easy to get and use.	St
1.12.3	The problem is with the card used to connect without ANY wires to anything.	St
1.12.4	The PCMCIA card.	St
1.12.5	Here's the best example I can come up with: I'm not looking for a cordless telephone for my house, I'm looking for a cell phone so I can make and receive calls anywhere.	St
1.12.6	Anyone else out there have a better way to explain this more easily?	St
1.13.1	That some laptops are showing up with EVDO cards internal to the laptop.	St
1.13.2	Such cards are likely miniPCI form but are not widely available.	St
1.13.3	The word today is we are only weeks away from express form cards appearing.	St
1.13.4	Bob	St
1.14.1	where will the update appear...have you an address?	St
1.14.2	thanks!	St
1.15.1	The following update is from a company called Novatel and they provide the wireless pc cards for Cingular.	St
1.15.2	(I believe they are also Verizon's vendor as well.)	St
1.15.3	&quot;The Merlin XU870 ExpressCard is our second external ExpressCard/34 solution for notebook platforms that either contain both PCMCIA and ExpressCard slots or only ExpressCard slots.	St
1.15.4	By delivering our pre-commercial Merlin XU870 HSDPA ExpressCards for North American and European markets, ahead of schedule, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to leading the way in ExpressCard mobile broadband development,&quot; said Peter Leparulo, CEO of Novatel Wireless.	St
1.15.5	Commercial shipments of the Merlin XU870 ExpressCard are currently expected to begin in the third quarter of 2006.	St
1.16.1	alright, latest &quot;update&quot; is that they should either be out this week (which is highly unlikely) or in the first couple weeks of July.	St
1.16.2	And sorry, no address for news, I've had to go directly to a customer rep.	St
1.17.1	Alright, so here's the deal.	St
1.17.2	Dell has finally put an express card up for sale which is Verizon supported however you can only get it directly from Dell.	St
1.17.3	Verizon has yet to start selling them.	St
1.17.4	So you have to buy them from Dell http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&l=en&cs=19&sku=313-4357 then once you get it you have to call up Verizon and have them activate service for it.	St
1.17.5	Nothing's ever easy, is it?	St
1.18.1	It's appreciated.	St
1.18.2	Bob	St
1.19.1	Sprint has been stalking the company I work for, for some time now, our sister company made the switch in Northern Florida, now we're in the process of giving the boot to Cingular/ATT, apparently our tech guys have got tester cards from sprint and they are 10x the speed of Cing/ATT, being all our laptops have PC slots the subject of Express cards was never brought up, well we just got a new shipment of laptops and we brought it up, the Rep assured us that the new cards would be out before the Fall, sorry sweetie, not fast enough, she said she has seen them, and she will try to pull a few early, they are close, but Dell should have forseen this issue.	St
1.19.2	P.S.	St
1.19.3	I Spoke with Tiffany and Bruno from Dell Tech Support, whos offices just happened to be in New Delhi, they could not advise any new information	St
1.20.1	I hold in my hands the Training Guide issued to Verizon Wireless employees for the new V640 Wireless ExpressCard with assurances from a sales rep that the cards are shipping this week.	St
1.20.2	The guide includes a compatibility list, so everyone should be able to determine if their laptops will work with the card.	St
1.20.3	The associate did not know what the pricepoint will be, or if VerizonWireless will be offering any rebates with the initial release, but at least he had some knowledge of the troubles we've been lamenting about!	St
1.20.4	That's more than I (and based on the responses to this forum, everyone else) have gotten from Verizon in the past!!	St
1.20.5	Hopefully, there's light at the end of the tunnel, and it's not an oncoming train!!	St
1.20.6	!	St
1.21.1	Can anyone recommend the best way to order this item from Verizon?	Ques
1.21.2	It seems that the local wireless vendor shops (all providers) tend to specialize in only cell phone knowledge, sales and equipment.	St
1.21.3	It would be nice to have a single point of contact 800 number (or?)	St
1.21.4	as often the local wireless shops have limited knowledge regarding the laptop wireless connection options.	St
1.22.1	This is kind of an expensive fix at $189.95, but it is in stock and at least available.	St
1.22.2	It is a newer technology for 32 bit cards.	St
1.22.3	http://www.mp3car.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=214 It appears that most newer broadband cards are supported.	St
1.22.4	For the Sprint PC-5740 (the same card used also for Verizon), I am told it will work, but you will need to use a manual install for it.	St
1.22.5	Basically, the connection software provided by Verizon does not see the card so they assume the same for Sprints, but there are directions for manually enabling its use with this adapter here: http://www.elandigitalsystems.com/support/ufaq/newconnection.php I hope this helps some folks.	St
1.22.6	This has been very frustrating for us as well to have new laptops now without being able to use our existing Broadband modem cards.	St
1.23.1	Sorry, my post should have said USB, not USP.	St
1.23.2	Just a typo!	St
1.23.3	!	St
1.24.1	Sewell makes a USB adapter that will allow you to use a PCMCIA card on a notebook without a PC card slot.	St
1.24.2	Go to www.sewelldirect.com and look for part SW-4772.	St
1.24.3	It's $200+ and is backordered 4-6 weeks, but that's one solution.	St
1.25.1	It is August already; I just discovered this forum - too late, I'm afraid.	St
1.25.2	I too have a Dell Inspiron and recently ordered a broadband wireless card though Sprint, as my they are the provider for my mobile service.	St
1.25.3	I was really excited about the possibility of being connected at home (we live in the country and there is no way I'm going back to dial-up).	St
1.25.4	You would think that the online Sprint store would disclose compatibility issues, but noooo!	St
1.25.5	How hard would it be to post that their cards don't fit Express Card slots?	St
1.25.6	I'm so disgusted with not only Sprint, but Dell as well - why did they do this?	St
1.25.7	Dell has an Express Card Modem for $179 but it only works with Verizon.	St
1.25.8	Cingular compatibility is due out at the end of the year.	St
1.25.9	What's up with Sprint?	St
1.26.1	its now available thru verizon (internet has it now) retail office should have it by the 24th of August	St
1.27.1	Verizon on line now has this product if you order it thru the internet you can get the express card now, it wont be on their retail store till the 24th of August.	St
1.28.1	I hope they will be available at cingular soon	St
1.29.1	and when they might be putting out their express card please post it.	St
1.29.2	i went to verison and was told i would have to pay $20 more a month because i do not have phone service with them.	St
1.29.3	i have my service with cingular and i am not switching nor am i going to give verison more money for their soso coverage.	St
1.29.4	so i must either wait or return the computer i just bought.	St
1.29.5	just like a lot of other people i see.	St
1.30.1	The fee is there for either version card.	St
1.30.2	Did you consider an EVDO router?	St
1.30.3	Bob	St
1.31.1	Sorry to sound dumb, but what is the relationship between an AirCard that fits into an Express Card slot and an EVDO Router?	St
1.31.2	I am still waiting for a solution to the problem we all have - I have a Dell XPS M1710 - great computer - big screen, etc.	St
1.31.3	and I use it for business, but I need an AirCard.	St
1.31.4	Is the Verizon Aircard available yet?	St
1.32.1	If we google EVDO ROUTER we find out that we can pop the EVDO PC-Card into that unit and get access via wifi.	St
1.32.2	Which explains the connection to your Dell.	St
1.32.3	Some can only get the full size PC-Card so the EVDO router is a nice to know about solution.	St
1.32.4	Bob	St
1.33.1	via internet purchase only for now.	Ques
1.33.2	i just do not want to pay $79.00 a month for service.	St
1.33.3	it is $59.00 a month when you have phone service with them.	St
1.33.4	i am stuck with cingular for now.	St
1.34.1	i work on a boat on the coast where you can get strong cellular signals so the only thing that will work for me is a pc express card (the new laptop has only 1 express card slot)and the more i look the more i find out that i will have to wait for cingular to catch up.	St
1.34.2	verizon is the only one who has it i am just not ready to give them 20 buck more for service that is not as good as cingular in the area i work in.	St
1.35.1	can you provide a web address for the express card from verizon wireless?	St
1.35.2	thanks!	St
1.36.1	look under products then under wireless pc card.	St
1.36.2	it is the verizon wireless v 640.	St
1.36.3	$179 for 2 year and $229 for 1 yr contract.	St
1.36.4	$59 a month if you have phone service with them and $79 without.	St
1.36.5	the card is not in the stores yet but will be soon.	St
1.36.6	and so i hear so will cingular and that is who i will wait for because of the area i travel.	St
1.37.1	I read all the frustrations of PC Express Card users in this thread.	St
1.37.2	Over here in Malaysia, we have the same problem : Telcos offering PCMCIA cards for laptops with PC Express card slots !!	St
1.37.3	However the answer is, I believe, quiet simple : Use the 3G phone as a modem connecting either via bluetooth or usb cable.	St
1.37.4	I am using this set-up and it works fine everywhere I have the telco connection.	St
1.38.1	I have read all these messages and glad to hear I'm not the only one with problems.	St
1.38.2	My new problem is I just purchased a new Dell with the V640 Express Card and slot.	St
1.38.3	The problem is I already have Verizon on the 5740 card in my wifes work computer.	St
1.38.4	Dell does not put PCMCIA slots in their computers anymore and I want to use the same card in both computers.	St
1.38.5	I prefer to use the new Expresscard.	St
1.38.6	I can not find an adapter to change the PCMCIA slot to the new Expresscard or even purchase an Expresscard slot to put in my wifes notebook.	St
1.38.7	Does anyone have any ideas?	Ques
1.38.8	Thanks, Matt	Polite
1.39.1	I have read all these messages and glad to hear I'm not the only one with problems.	St
1.39.2	My new problem is I just am purchasing a new Dell with the V640 Express Card and slot.	St
1.39.3	The problem is I already have Verizon on the 5740 card in my wifes work computer.	St
1.39.4	Dell does not put PCMCIA slots in their computers anymore and I want to use the same card in both computers.	St
1.39.5	I prefer to use the new Expresscard.	St
1.39.6	I can not find an adapter to change the PCMCIA slot to the new Expresscard or even purchase an Expresscard slot to put in my wifes notebook.	St
1.39.7	Does anyone have any ideas?	Ques
1.39.8	Do they make a slot that is compatible with both cards?	St
1.39.9	Thanks, Matt	Polite
1.40.1	check these guys out, they sell the v640 for less than my local verizon stores do: http://booster-antenna.com	Sug
1.41.1	having the internal card what do you do then, i have the bl120 and i need an adapter or something to get wireless on the go.	St
1.41.2	any sugestions thanks	Polite
1.42.1	I have similar problem.	St
1.42.2	Thanks Dell.	St
1.42.3	Thanks Verizon.	St
1.42.4	Is there an EVDO router I could use with Verizon wireless Broadband to feed both my wife and me?	Ques
1.42.5	Thanks David	St
1.43.1	Yes, there are EVDO routers that would allow you to use Verizon Broadband Access on both yours and your wife's computers.	St
1.43.2	The Kyocera KR1 Router with the Kyocera KPC 650 can both be purchased from www.booster-antenna.com and would work for you.	St
1.43.3	Check out these products and read advice from the EVDO Experts at www.EVDOinfo.com !	St
1.44.1	My daughter purchased the Verizon PC5740 card for use with her Inspiron computer.	St
1.44.2	It worked like a charm.	St
1.44.3	The problem was she decided she needed a lighter computer and bought a Dell Latitude 420 notebook (refurbished).	St
1.44.4	She bought this particular computer because it has a PC slot and she assumed that she could use the Verizon card in the slot.	St
1.44.5	The card doesn't work.	St
1.44.6	Verizon says it isn't their problem because the card works in the other machine.	St
1.44.7	Dell says it has to be a problem with the card because when a WiFi card is inserted, the computer provides it with power.	St
1.44.8	Neither side will budge and she is left with a computer that doesn't serve her initial purpose.	St
1.44.9	The Dell web pages say the slot in the D420 will work with a Type I or Type II PC card.	St
1.44.10	Any suggestions other than to return the computer?	St
1.44.11	She has a two-year contract for the Verizon card that just started in August.	St
1.45.1	I have just run into the same situation.	St
1.45.2	I have had the Verizon CDMA Air Card for over 3 years.	St
1.45.3	I run thru laptops like they are consumables...I have to have at least 4 running all the time for my business and 1 that I take on the road.	St
1.45.4	As they break, I get another one to replace it.	St
1.45.5	Up til now, I haven't had a problem using my wireless access card while traveling...until I bought my last two computers (both from Dell).	St
1.45.6	They too only accept the Express Cards and I already paid $300 for the AirCard and it still works fine!	St
1.45.7	I don't want to buy another card but can't find any laptops that will still accept my card.	St
1.45.8	I am sure there must be some type of adapter out there (???)	St
1.45.9	but haven't been able to figure this out.	St
1.45.10	Maybe I am asking or looking for the wrong thing.	St
1.45.11	Can someone help me?	Ques
1.45.12	I use my Sierra Wireless Air Card by Verizon to &quot;dial-up&quot; to a cellphone signal and get reasonably fast internet connection when I am traveling and there are no wifi access points available.	St
1.45.13	I have my service for this thru Earthlink at a hefty $90 per month for unlimited usage but hear that Verizon offers it for less.	St
1.45.14	But do you then have to purchase the new card?	Ques
1.45.15	This is sooooo confusing.	St
1.45.16	Bottom line - I need to find a low cost laptop that still has a CDMA card slot.	St
1.45.17	I would like to change my existing service over to a lower cost carrier.	St
1.45.18	The CDMA card says Verizon but the service is thru Earthlink.	St
1.45.19	If I am unable to locate a PC with this compatible slot, is there an adapter available that will allow me plug into an express slot and use this existing card?	St
1.45.20	Thanks!	St
1.46.1	i dont have much of a suggestions for the computer and aircard compliance however i sell verizon phones and plans can be changed at any time.	Ques
1.46.2	if she is already a verizon customer with a phone and an air card then she can turn the air card into an extra line on the account for much less than 59.99. if all she has is the air card than she can turn it into a veizon cell phone acct.	St
1.46.3	to solve the phone dilemma since verizon will charge her full price of the phone she can look for cheap verizon phones on ebay.	St
1.47.1	What ever happend to reverse compatibility?	St
1.47.2	Do I understnad correctly that my current 3G PC Card Modem &quot;Sierra Wireless AirCard 860&quot; via Cingular EDGE will NOT work in the new EXPRESS CARD SLOTS?	St
1.47.3	WTF !	St
1.47.4	Please correct my understanding.	St
1.47.5	We all know Dell is a bunch of shisters!	St
1.48.1	It's not just Dell.	St
1.48.2	I just bought a new HP laptop, not realizing that it only had an express card slot.	St
1.48.3	Then I bought a new Verizon Wireless Sierra Aircard 595 PC card (the only Vista compatible card according to the Verizon sales rep) which doesn't fit into the express card slot.	St
1.48.4	So far the only possible solutions I've found are Quatech's USB adapter for 32 bit cardbus wireless modem cards for $179(which costs more than the PC card) from Sewell Direct or Elan's USB adapter for $189.	St
1.48.5	Both of these support Sierra Aircards although the specific model I bought isn't listed.	St
1.48.6	Duel Systems is &quot;testing&quot; the DuelAdapter which looks like a USB reader but fits into an express card slot.	St
1.48.7	It's not listed as being Vista compatible, only Windows XP and Mac OS X.	St
1.48.8	The PCIMCIA website (www.expresscard.org) suggests getting the Verizon V640 EV-DO ExpressCard but according to Verizon's website (and the Verizon sales rep I spoke to) the V640 doesn't support Vista.	St
1.48.9	If anyone has any other solutions I'd appreciate the info.	Ques
1.49.1	It's another way...	St
1.50.1	I purchased a HP Vista too what a mess nothing work with it.	St
1.50.2	Here is what they have to offer and they said there is an adapter to change your pcmcia to express at best buy and I will give you the update if I find what we need.This is getting very costly after buying a $2000 computer.	St
1.50.3	s http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&l=en&cs=19&sku=313-4813	St
1.51.1	Most of the time this is just a matter of doing your research ahead of time or asking your wireless provider for the newer express card.	St
1.51.2	The EVDO router sidesteps that issue.	St
1.51.3	Bob	St
1.52.1	The new EX720 express card from Sprint (only $59.99 a month regardless of your cell provider) is the way to go.	St
1.52.2	It can be had for $129.99 here: http://moremobileinternet.com/ex720 which is $50 less than from Sprint direct.	St
1.52.3	This devise works on All laptops with the Express slot...XP, Vista and even Macs.	St
1.53.1	I went ahead and ordered through Dell.com and ordered this for $220.00: http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&l=en&cs=19&sku=313-4813 I went to Cingular and they added the Laptop Connect feature to my existing Cingular service for 59.99 a month.	St
1.53.2	It's been smooth sailing ever since, it's just a shame I had to come out the pocket $200+.	St
1.54.1	At the time that I bought my new computer (the day after Vista was released) Verizon didn't have an express card that was Vista compatible.	St
1.54.2	After reading some of the threads on this discussion I priced EVDO routers and they were just as expensive as the adapters.	St
1.54.3	I didn't want to shell out more money after having just bought a brand new computer.	St
1.54.4	Verizon did eventually make their Express Card V640 compatible with Vista and they were nice about exchanging my air card.	St
1.55.1	I encountered the same problem.	St
1.55.2	I checked around, some phone companies have USB phone card that are easily transfered to any other computers.	St
1.55.3	But, Cingular is coming with a Express phone card in a couple of weeks.	St
1.55.4	You can already get info at cingular.com, go to business stuff and search for &quot;express card&quot;.	St
1.55.5	It seems that cingular is putting G3 everywhere, which is fast, very fast connection...	St
1.56.1	Hello I found 2 online...........RFWEL.COM has a dual adapter that will plug into your laptop that has the express card slot and then you will be able to plug your PCMCIA card (larger one) into the port at the other end.	St
1.56.2	It is $109.	St
1.56.3	Says it is compatible with most DELLS and network cards from your wireless provider.	St
1.56.4	I think it is ridiculous that NO ONE mentioned this to me either.	St
1.56.5	I was so mad when I found out my new laptop was useless!!	St
1.56.6	Dell TECH SUPPORT (on top of being rude and not having a grasp on the English language)told me to put my PCMCIA card back in the clear plastic &quot;jacket&quot; that it came in and then it would fit in the slot for my DELL INSPIRON 1521 LAPTOP WITH EXPRESS CARD SLOT!!	St
1.56.7	I could not believe that they were trying to convince me of such a ridiculous thing.	St
1.56.8	Obviously TECH SUPPORT doesn't even have any CLUE about the changes in their products!!	St
1.56.9	DELL SUCKS!!!	St
1.56.10	I HOPE THIS HELPS SINCE NO ONE ELSE WILL HELP IN THE &quot;SUPPORT&quot; DEPARTMENTS.	St
1.56.11	PS: BEST BUY, CIRCUIT CITY, & RADIOSHACK DO NOT HAVE THESE ADAPTERS.	St
1.56.12	SEWELL.COM HAD ONE AS WELL.	St
1.56.13	PEACE & GOOD LUCK!	St

1.59.1	Have just ordered a new HP, facing the same problems noted above to make my Verizon PCMCIA card work.	St
1.59.2	Based on what I read here, the DuelAdapter looked like the solution.	St
1.59.3	But when I called Duel Systems' tech support to make sure about compatability, &quot;David&quot; told me they HAVE NOT YET GOTTEN THE DUELADAPTER TO WORK WITH ANY HP PAVILLION 6000 SERIES LAPTOP.	St
1.59.4	Looks like I may have to purchase a new Express Card from Verizon and simply trash my 6-month-old AirCard595.	St
1.60.1	Does ANYONE know when or if T-mobile is going to get a driver for the sony ericson card to use with Windows Vista?	St
1.60.2	Now that I have solved the express card to pcmcia issue - i a finding out that T-mobile does not have a vista driver to make the whole freakin mess work!	St
1.60.3	AHHHHH Help!	St
1.61.1	I just bought a Fujitsu Siemens P Series Life Book P 7230.	St
1.61.2	It does not come with a dial up modem.	St
1.61.3	I tried using an old Dell (3com - 3CCFEM656) pcmcia ethernet + modem card, but the windows vista business OS on the notebook does not have a driver for it.	St
1.61.4	I searched everywhere for its Vista compatible driver but came up with nothing.	St
1.61.5	Can anyone suggest a Windows Vista compatible PCMCIA card dial up modem!!!!??	Ques
1.61.6	?	Ques
1.62.1	Can you tell me how I would do this?	St
1.62.2	My current bill runs about $112 for both my verizon cell phone and my aircard internet.	St
1.62.3	If I understand correctly, are you saying that I can get that much cheaper?	St
1.62.4	Thanks	Polite
