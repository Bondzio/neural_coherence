$60 is a good price on a used card.
Most people are selling them on EBay for 80-100 dollars.
Old Macs are great, but the laws of supply and demand will dictate the price of add-ons and upgrades.
Some hotels offer wireless access points that plug into the ethernet port ... maybe they can be had somewhere, or ask a hotel that uses them if they would sell a used one to you.
Good Luck, Greg
