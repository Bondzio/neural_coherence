<s> i have two winxp machines and i have the network working between the two computers, but i am having trouble setting up the internet connection sharing so far xp has not been able to set it up. </s>
<s> thanks for your help </s>
<s> the only suggestion I can give is to run the wizard again and post back where it fails. </s>
<s> Other tidbits to serve up would be: 1) type of internet connection 2) network layout 3) software firewalls being used for starters. </s>
