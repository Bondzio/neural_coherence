<s> Hi, Tech stuff out of the way: I am on a cable modem. </s>
<s> My desktop computer (PC - windows xp) is not wireless. </s>
<s> I just bought a laptop (Mac - OSX/leopard), so I bought the netgear WPN824 v3 router so that I could make it wireless. </s>
<s> and it is! </s>
<s> I installed it correctly, it works and gets ok speed on the wireless laptop. </s>
<s> One big issue though: Whenever I try to send someone a file over trillian or skype, it works OK. </s>
<s> However, when someone tries to send me files, it never sends. </s>
<s> Skype sends but it says that it's using some redirection thing, so it goes at like 100 bytes/second. </s>
<s> This has never happened before I got the router. </s>
<s> I called netgear and they were absolutely NO help at all. </s>
<s> I turned off the netgear firewall and tried to port forward things but that didn't seem to help? </s>
<s> Does anyone have any ideas? </s>
<s> I have clients sending me files and I can't force them to have to email me everything all the time! </s>
<s> That's ridiculous! </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> http://kbserver.netgear.com/products/WPN824v3.asp shows there is no firmware upgrade so try the usual settings we have in our forum sticky. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> yes, I have already set it up like it says in the sticky </s>
<s> All the routers work for me when I follow our forum note or else they have a defect. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> so it doesn't have anything to do with port forwarding? </s>
<s> should i not have to forward the ports at all if i turn off the firewall and stuff? </s>
<s> and...should I buy another netgear router or is there a better router out there? </s>
<s> thank you for your suggestion </s>
<s> But those apps work fine here without port forwarding. </s>
<s> I use our forum sticky (you could tell me your setup if you want me to verify it) without any forwarded ports just dandy on many wifi routers. </s>
<s> This is why I must call it DOA. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> sorry lol. </s>
<s> I have kind of fixed the issue..but not totally: I had 3 friends send me files, but only 1/3 could actually get the file to go through over AIM (trillian). </s>
<s> the one who could send me the file is on a mac, the other two on PCs. </s>
<s> does this change anything or do you still suggest swapping it? </s>
<s> But remember that port forwarding is NOT in the forum sticky as a suggested setup. </s>
<s> Yes there are valid reasons to forward ports but for me I don't need it and it works fine across dozens of routers. </s>
<s> Your PC could be the issue but I'm unconvinced your router is setup exactly per our forum sticky so that's still a possible issue. </s>
<s> I can't count how many times we see the member come back with hidded SSIDs, WEP and MAC filtering. </s>

<s> NIL </s>
