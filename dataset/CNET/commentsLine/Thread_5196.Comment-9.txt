thanks for all of your input.
this drive is still under warranty.
it is a 200 gb sata seagate drive.
i am first going to open the case up and reseat everything.
i am also going to swap the sata cables to eliminate a cable issue.
i am going to attempt to run the drive diagnostics again.
after that, i'll see what happens.
i suppose then i will have to install my os in my other drive.
i'll see if the problem goes with the drive or not.
i guess that will then tell me if my mb is fubar.
i have a replacement board picked out at newegg for under $50.
can anyone see any issues w/ my plan?
thanks again, jason
