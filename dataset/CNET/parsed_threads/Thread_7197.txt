<s> 2) I would like to watch Full HD movies(1080p) without having any kind of lag. </s>
<s> Colour combinations of movies should be good enough. </s>
<s> 3)For look,I prefer glossy. </s>
<s> But it can be changed according to you peoples suggestion. </s>
<s> I dont know which is good matte or glossy. </s>
<s> 4)Other basic features like BT,Wifi,HDMI,etc Questions --------- For watching Full HD movies, do I required external graphics card? </s>
<s> If it required, how much I require(1GB,2GB or more than that?)? </s>
<s> I found some laptop whose clock speed is less. </s>

<s> My Lenovo y530 with a core2duo, 4GB ram and the Intel 4500MHD does 1080p on my HDTV just fine over HDMI. </s>

<s> I was tol some people saying theat if we want to watch 1080p movies, we need minimum 1GB graphics card. </s>
<s> And I would like to watch the 1080p movies in the laptop not connected through HDMI port. </s>
<s> Please suggest me whether I should go for graphics card or not? </s>
<s> Also which type of screen?matte screen or glossy screen?will there be any difference in watching movies? </s>
<s> As to your glossy/matte, of course it differs. </s>
<s> You can see that in person so why would there be any doubt? </s>
<s> Also, it's a personal choice so no one should tell you which way to go. </s>

<s> Will there by any difference in watching movies with repsect to Glossy and matte? </s>
<s> I saw some samsung series which all are matte finish. </s>
<s> Does this mean that hd video clarity will be leser? </s>
<s> And I heard that some colour brightness will be less in the movies in matte screen. </s>
<s> Is that true? </s>
<s> Just find a shop and look for yourself. </s>
<s> Don't forget to look at both TV's and laptops. </s>
<s> They have the same kind of screen, so then can be compared quite well. </s>
