you can power down your internal hard drive from the power setting menu.
start &gt; control panel (switch to classic view) &gt; power options.
simply change the setting for turn off hard drive.
this will spin down the hard drive after the computer has been inactive for a set period of time.
note: it is often debatable as to what is really worse for a hard drive.
leaving it on all the time or turning it on and off constantly.
depending on design, it may be worse for some electronics and also some mechanical devices to be subjected to the thermal stresses and power surges of constant warming up and cooling down associated with turning on and off repeatable.
this has always been the similar issue when answering the question of what is best, leaving your computer turned on all the time or shutting it down?
