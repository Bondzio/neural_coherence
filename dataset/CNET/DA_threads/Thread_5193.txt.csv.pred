1.1.1	Hi everyone, I'm recently upgrading my video card on my desktop.	St
1.1.2	It's the ATI RADEON HD 2900 XT.	St
1.1.3	I'm just not sure what is the proper way of hooking power to it.	Res
1.1.4	This is my first video card that needs it's own power to it.	St
1.1.5	FRYS Electronics is selling this: http://www.frys.com/product/4734999 .	St
1.1.6	I'm not sure if I just need one of those.	Res
1.1.7	It's confusing if I need two 6 pin cables, one for the 6 pin connector and one for the 8 pin connector.	St
1.1.8	I know I'll need an 8 pin for it's connector if I want to overclock and so on.	St
1.1.9	Any help and I thank you.	Polite
1.1.10	I just want to get what I need before the card gets here.	St
1.2.1	You will need a power supply that has both a 6 pin connector, and an 8 pin connector.	St
1.2.2	Also note, that you will have to make sure your case is very well ventilated, as I have read that these cards get REALLY HOT &quot;..Ouch!	St
1.2.3	Using some AMD monitoring software, we noted idle temperatures of between 65 70-degrees Celsius from the core die and that is just sitting in Windows.	St
1.2.4	At full load halfway through a 3DMark06 benchmark run, we noted a maximum temperature of 84-degrees Celsius from the core die in other words, very hot!	St
1.2.5	&quot; http://www.tweaktown.com/articles/1100/ati_radeon_hd_2900_xt_amd_s_long_awaited_r600_dx10_gpu_arrives/index3.html	St
1.3.1	for this reason.	St
1.3.2	You didn't mention your power supply specs.	Polite
1.3.3	That it doesn't already contain the necessary connector means it might not be of sufficient wattage.	St
1.3.4	If it is of sufficient wattage, the adapter might work.	St
1.3.5	If not, you're going to need a new PS and these will probably already have a proper connector.	St
1.4.1	Sorry I didn't post about my power supply specs, it's a Sparkle Power Inc 350w.	St
1.4.2	I plan on upgrading the power supply, because of this video card.	St
1.4.3	My computer is an HP m1170n Media Center PC.	St
1.4.4	It uses a 24 pin ATX power connection for the motherboard.	St
1.4.5	Only problem, because of the size of the video card, it's blocking four of the motherboards ATX power pins.	St
1.4.6	I believe these have to be pins 1-4, which are important for operating the computer.	St
1.4.7	I don't know if there is a work around for this?	St
1.4.8	Those pins have to be powered, if not the computer can't run.	St
1.4.9	If you go here: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c00208497&tmp_task=prodinfoCategory&lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&lang=en&product=432780 .	St
1.4.10	That will show what the layout of my motherboard is.	St
1.4.11	It's the way the ATX power connector was placed on the motherboard, that the video card gets in the way.	St
1.4.12	I know it's a laugh, because of the overall specs of my desktop.	St
1.4.13	I can see why the video card won't fit.	St
1.4.14	That's why I'm never getting a brand named desktop again.	St
1.4.15	I would rather build one like I've always wanted to.	St
1.4.16	Any help would be great on what to do..	Polite
1.5.1	The position of the ATX Power Connector is pretty much in the same place as any other motherboard; the fact that this motherboard is a Micro-ATX form factor, is what's causing the problems with the video card install.	St
1.5.2	If the motherboard was a standard ATX form factor, we wouldn't be having this problem...Solution, might have to settle for a smaller (shorter) video card (for example: Radeon HD 5670 1GB GDDR5 PCI Express x16, comes in at around 7 inches long) to fit into the 9.6 inch x 9.6 inch motherboard.	St
1.6.1	I looked the 2900 XT and read somewhere it wants 39 AMPERES on the 12V RAIL.	St
1.6.2	I doubt a 350 Watt power supply delivers that because 39 times 12 is 468 Watts.	St
1.6.3	Even at idle it may be half that or 19 Amperes and many 350W supplies have 10 Ampere 12V rails.	St
1.6.4	You'll likely need to fit a 700+ Watt power supply with a watchful eye on the Amperes per rail.	St
1.6.5	Just asking.	St
1.6.6	Didn't the seller warn you of this?	St
1.6.7	Bob	St
1.7.1	I aleady have the video card, is there another solution?	St
1.7.2	I didn't think it through before getting it off eBay.	St
1.7.3	Needed it for my brothers birthday.	St
1.7.4	I forgot that my motherboard was a micro-ATX.	St
1.7.5	I don't know if there is some type of 90 degree ATX power adapter that would would fit?	St
1.7.6	Kind of like a SATA data cable.	St
1.7.7	Maybe there is something like that and would work?	St
1.7.8	I was lucky to get a really low price on this.	St
1.7.9	I never really planned on upgrading from my RADEON X700.	St
1.7.10	Mostly because my desktop is getting older.	St
1.7.11	I just wanted to please my brother for his birthday, so he could hopefully play this one game.	St
