I never thought it could really happen, but my pc did explode this morning.
I was working on it as usual, then I smelled a burning smell, then a loud &quot;pop&quot;, then my machine shut down on its own.
I unplugged and opened it up to see what I could see, but honestly I didn't know what to look for.
I haven't cracked open the power supply yet, but I wouldn't know what to look for.
Please help with any suggestions!
I'm so desperate !
