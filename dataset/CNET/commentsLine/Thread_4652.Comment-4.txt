i wouldn't worry about the hard drive, they are made for 24/7 use and unless you are shutting it down for security, you won't do any harm to it by leaving it on.
alternatively, you can get a lamp timer and have the lap timer shut down the hard drive after a certain time.
there are also remote control systems that will allow you to control power to outlets with a remote control, i belive radio shack has a fairly inexpensive line.
glad to be of help!
