&quot;I've tried reinstall but I didn't un plug.&quot; Why not?
I offered it as a clue to try.
&quot;Could you please explain the exact order of steps.
&quot; No, I give guidance and direction.
No &quot;steps.&quot; Steps are likely for paid support services.
&quot;Should I uninstall present software?&quot; In my first reply, I noted that.
Maybe I was unclear?
But hopefully this time you will unplug the scanner USB connection, look to an uninstall in Add/Remove, put in the CD add it as if it was new and see if it helps.
