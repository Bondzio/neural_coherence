1.1.1	Eee PC 1015PEM VS IPAD (OR BLACKPAD IF IT COMES OUT BY NOV) I know this has been the debate ever since tablets came out netbooks vs tablets.	St
1.1.2	I dont game, music yes, photos some, movies maybe, hd playback a must, college, facebook.	St
1.1.3	thats what i will use it for.	St
1.1.4	any suggestions?	St
1.2.1	But all college students I know would do poorly on either product.	St
1.2.2	I wonder who thought they could get by with either.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	From what you described, I would suggest an ipad.	St
1.3.2	I don't think you'll be able to get consistent hd playback on a netbook.	St
1.3.3	However if you plan on making documents (ie.	St
1.3.4	write an essay for class), then I'd say netbook in a heartbeat.	St
