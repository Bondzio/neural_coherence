Found out some stuff for ya.
Turns out, when you see the location of the Video Card as &quot;PCI bus 1&quot;, that is OK.
If you want to make sure, download the latest drivers for your video card from NVidia's website (www.nvidia.com), or use Gainward's own drivers from their website.
Also, if you are able to edit your registry (regedit.exe), go to the following key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\NVIDIA Corporation\Global\NVTweak Right-click the right side of the two &quot;sides&quot;, then click on &quot;New/DWORD Value&quot;.
Name the value &quot;CoolBits&quot;, then set it as &quot;ffffffff&quot;.
This will enable all the &quot;secret&quot; pages in the video properties page.
Right-click on the desktop and then on &quot;properties&quot;.
Under the NVIDIA properties, go to where it (should) says &quot;AGP Settings&quot;.
On that tab, there is a slider that enables you to change from &quot;PCI&quot; to &quot;AGP&quot;.
