That is when I came across OEM software. On Newegg currently, I can preorder Windows 7 Home Premium OEM for $100 less than retail. Now, this sounds good and fine and all, but I was under the impression that OEM usually has a catch, like getting another piece of hard/software with it. But this has no apparent &quot;chain&quot; that comes along with it... could someone clear this up for me?
