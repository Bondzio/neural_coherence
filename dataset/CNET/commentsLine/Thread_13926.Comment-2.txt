the ram makers you offered are good enough by me.
understand amongest those makers, they can classify thier ram produucts as budget, hi-performance, extreme or have heat exchangers/clips included, etc.
depending on your needs buy what you cab afford or desire.
i see no problem with the brands again as you offered.
as an added warning, get the best psu you can afford as you are pushing it with a 480w, even though antec, if you can get a 500w+, go for it as your system is stuffed.
