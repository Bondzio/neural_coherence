I have a walkman nwz-a818 and it shows up in &quot;my computer&quot; like a hard drive. It doesn't have a letter though, but it's just like a hard drive and i can put any types of files onto it, make new folders and stuff. So, is it possible to run linux on it? Thanks

You probably have an 8 track for sale (and a jethro tull tape to go with it). You can however install linux on some of the newer models of Hoover. s
