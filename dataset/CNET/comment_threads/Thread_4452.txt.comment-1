Hello.
I had an accident at a waterpark and no longer have my arms.
I get by with my feet pretty good but I want a tablet and have trouble using my feet on them.
What is the best one for tapping if you have big toes?
Does screen size matter or is it the screen tapping area that might be the problem?
Is there anything for the handicap out there.
I can spend up to 700 then I have to pay the rest myself.
Thank you JJB
