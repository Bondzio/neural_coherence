i have a t3312 e-machine.
on the machine it used 512mb ddr (1 512mb), 400mhz (pc3200).
i am going to buy superram ddr-400, but i will only have one 512mb ram not two (part number - mpxc22d-38kt3r)  after googling i found this as a compatible specs for ram on the t3312.
the t3312 ram and superram are both ddr ram, 400 mhz (pc3200), 184-pin, unbuffed, and non-ecc.
the difference is their voltage (t3312 - 2.6v, superram - 2.5v), cas latency (t3312 - 3, superram - 2-2-2-5 / 2.5-3-3-7), and type (t3312 - 184-pin dimm, superram - 184-pin ddr sdram) &lt;i am not sure about the last part&gt; can i install the superram into this computer?
