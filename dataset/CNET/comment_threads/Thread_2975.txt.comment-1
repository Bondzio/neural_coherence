Recently purchased a Macbook and have pc with linksys router.
The pc is hard wired however I want to use the wireless for macbook.
Only was able to get into the wireless using the admin password.
Question #1 how do I change from using a default (admin) password to get into router ?
Question#2 how do I set up a WPA Personal on the router?
