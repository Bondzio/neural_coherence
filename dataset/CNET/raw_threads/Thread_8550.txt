Anyway, it (obviously) doesn't have an operating system. I have another computer with vista (premium). I have the backup disks for that pc, can I use the backup disks to put the operating system on my upgraded pc? Or do I have to buy a stupid operating system again?

If you don't use the other system, yes, you swap over or re-install but again only one OS per system. The other system must now be defunct. This is all in the confines of a legal user. Visit MS support website on such details, they really provide it. tada -----Willy
