It was out of ink.
And I found out something useful.
When connected to the NAS the ink monitor does not work.
Installed it on the laptop, and after a few times of going through the tests and checks, I looked at the levels.
DUH!!
These levels do not show up correctly when connected to the NAS.
Put a new cartridge in and voila!
The NAS is nice but it will not display the printer monitor.
