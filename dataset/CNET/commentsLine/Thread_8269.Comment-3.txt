thank you for taking the time to answer my honest question.
i am not anti-apple, i simply have a vast and expen$ive support system of sony items and love the microsoft programs.
every time that i see the ipad on tv, i covet it.
but i know that as soon as it's out of the box, i will regret the limiting nature for myself.
being a zune pass holder, i've become used to the luxury of downloading 100's and 100's of songs for a flat monthly fee.
i'm fickle, musically, so i have no desire to own the latest *pop* and hip-hop music that i exercise with; i want new each month to hold my interest and motivate me to keep fit.
i also have the original sony e-reader with 235 books that i paid for and don't want to lose; if sony came out with an &quot;i-tab&quot; (&lt;what the ipad should have been called), i could transfer all my books to that device plus use my memory sticks.
well, i thank you for taking your time to answer me and not dismiss my curiosity.
have a great, glitch-free day!
