we'll let me expand, we picked up a viewsonic p225, the first one fizzed out after 10 min.
the second 1/3 of the screen is blurred not real bad but not what it should be.
i've been out looking locally and no one seems to be stocking the large crt's any more, i think what i'll go out pick up a 20&quot; lcd and try it out, i'll know after a day or two and if i dont like it i'll take it back.
