<s> I reside in a university residence and I own both a laptop and a desktop. </s>
<s> There is a single network point in my room. </s>
<s> I keep my desktop connected to this as this is where I get internet access. </s>
<s> I want to sync both my laptop and desktop and this usually involves me unplugging the LAN cable and plugging it into my laptop. </s>
<s> I'm looking for an easier solution. </s>
<s> Can I buy a USB wifi stick for my desktop and connect simultaneously to my laptop wirelessly and the university network via cable? </s>
<s> Note both pcs have Windows 7 X64. </s>
<s> Plug it into the college connection. </s>
<s> For some reason the IT department doesn't like it when guys attach routers to their ports. </s>
<s> I don't need the notebook to access the net. </s>
<s> I just want to sync it with files on my desktop. </s>
<s> Thanks though. </s>
<s> If so, I'd think you could add another Ethernet card to the desktop and use a crossover cable for data transfer. </s>
<s> You'd have to use static IP addressing for the laptop NIC and the new NIC for the desktop. </s>
