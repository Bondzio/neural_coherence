<s> Hi There is there such a thing as a broadband lan phone I can plug into my router lan connection without leaving my PC on all the time and just leave my router powered up? </s>
<s> Regards Tony B. </s>
<s> See Skype.com for those. </s>
<s> There are broadband phones, VoIP (voice over IP), VPN (virtual private network) and services that allow you to use your standard cordless or corded analog phone w/out tie-in to your PC. </s>
<s> If you can use a standard household phone and want to go one of the least expensive routes try this Vonage starter kit at http://www.amazon.com/Broadband-Phone-Service-Starter-Kit/dp/B001BJCYZ8 The box plugs into your router, then plug your cordless phone into the box and you're in business. </s>
<s> Best of luck! </s>
