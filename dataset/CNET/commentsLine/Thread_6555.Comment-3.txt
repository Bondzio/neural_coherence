i am simply trying to validate the following suggestion: since an airport express transmits a wireless signal, regardless of whether the voip device or any other device upstream in the chain is faulty, the airport express will continue to transmit.
of course if there is an interruption in the incoming internet pathway, the transmitted airport express signal will not allow the computer to connect to the internet.
if this is reasonable, it would suggest that since my computers are sporatically not receiving a wifi signal at all, the problem would reside in the airport express itself.
bob, you mentioned trying the forum suggestions.
could you please point me in that direction?
thank you.
