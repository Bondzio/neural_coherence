how is it going, my pc is making me ponder.
i have a 256 mb ddr 400 cl3 stick in a 3000+ amd sempron, my q is why is my available physical memory only showing 30mb yet my total physical memory is 256mb.
i am running xp but the computer is only 1 month old and i am only running internet explorer on it, also if i want to upgrade my ram to hopefully solve that issue and have it run quicker, do i have to buy same brand or can i get any other brand as long as it is 256mb ddr 400 .
i have 4 slots on my memory area how much can i upgrade to?
a million thanx for being there... ps: is there ever going to be the perfect computer?
