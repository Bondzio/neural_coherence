My take is if you can understand what they're saying and it's presented clearly (counter i.e., the 3 page review w/o a single paragraph break or period.
), let it go.
Some ppl post so much that in haste, they make typos from time to time.
For others, English ain't their native language.
The fact that the latter could actually converse on these english forums is impressive enough.
I would much rather receive a reply that has its fair share of typos and spelling mistakes, and grammar woes like &quot;their&quot;, &quot;there&quot;, &quot;they're&quot;, and &quot;theyre&quot; that are helpful and answer questions to those with correct spelling and grammar that don't really contribute anything.
Of course there is a limit to how much can be tolerated, as there is a threshold where a post is just unreadable, but IMO, this thread isn't the case
