1.1.1	I bought my computer with 256MB memory but windows only shows 224MB.	St
1.1.2	What is the problem?	St
1.1.3	How can I fix it?	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	Buy more RAM................lots more!	St
1.4.1	theres no problem that happened to my computer, it's just that you might have a lesser quality ram in your computer (no need to worry)	St
1.5.1	You don't have RAM loss, you're just using 32MB for your video card.	St
1.5.2	If you want to get it back you can purchase a video card with 32MB on-board RAM (not shared) for less than $30.00.	St
1.5.3	You really aren't going to be getting much processing power back from this, though.	St
1.5.4	RAM is pretty cheap, it would probably be more cost efficient and gain you a lot more performance to just buy another 256 chip and be done with it.	St
1.5.5	Good luck!	St
1.5.6	Teri	St
