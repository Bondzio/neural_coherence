I figured I post it in this thread instead of making a new one.
I currently have two 512MB sticks( PC3200 ) in my system.
It's a P4.
I want to upgrade to 2GB of memory.
Any performace differences between having four 512 MB sticks vs two 1GB sticks?
Of course two 1GB sticks are more expensive, but my friend's computer uses the same type of memory so I'd figure I'd sell him my two 512MB sticks if I went that route to offset some the extra cost.
Of course if the two 1 GB sticks don't offer any benefit then I just get 2 extra 512 MB sticks.
