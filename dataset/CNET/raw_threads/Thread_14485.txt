Here is my specs: Motherboard: Asus M2N-E SLi CPU: AMD Athlon X2 Dual Core 6000+ (3.02Ghz) Memory: Kingston DDR2 4GB RAM Hard Drive: WD 500GB PSU: Corsair VX 450W OS: Windows 7 Ultimate 32bit Graphic Card: Asus GeForce 8600GTS Without upgrading any other parts, what is the best graphic card now that I can purchase that will work properly and without bottlenecking the card? I also have a friend wanting to sell me his MSI GTX460 Twin Frozr II card. What minimum upgrade do I need to get the card running? All replies are appreciated. Thank you!

Another member settled on the 460 at http://forums.cnet.com/7723-7591_102-538859.html?tag=contentBody;threadListing It's quite a step up from the 8600. The power supply is a little on the low side. Be sure to cheap if the Amperes for this card can be supplied. Bob

Since your PSU is a Single Rail design it's probably fine. Unless this machine has some odd ball setup like 7 hard disk drives. Bob
