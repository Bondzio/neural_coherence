hi, i can see you concern about the difficulties of returns and system changes.
however, i think that apple has the required infrastructure in place for all the places that it sells equipment to.
you have not said where in the world you live so i cannot be more specific.
first generation machines are always a little suspect but the imac g5 is no longer a first generation machine.
it has been updated at least twice.
i know of 8 imac g5 owners and none of them have had any problem with their machines.
do some more reading and remember, you only hear about the fried few and never about the working thousands.
good luck p
