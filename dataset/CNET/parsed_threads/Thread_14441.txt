<s> Hey guys, I have a 500 GB WD external hard drive. </s>
<s> It was working fine this morning but when I came home today I noticed none of the 3 partitions drives had any files in them. </s>
<s> I shut off my computer and started it up again and I unplugged the hard drive from my computer and the power to it when my computer was shut down. </s>
<s> It still doesn't work after I plugged everything back in and powered on. </s>
<s> When I plug the hard drive into my computer's usb it still detects all 3 partitioned drives but I still can't see any folders on the hard drive. </s>
<s> Additionally the power button on the hard drive just keeps spinning indicating that its reading. </s>
<s> When I click on the properties for the hard drive it shows used space and free space as 0 bytes. </s>
<s> Can someone offer some insight on whats wrong with it as well as how to fix it or is it just a brick now? </s>
<s> If you didn't backup try titles like GETDATABACK, ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY. </s>
<s> Sorry but forensics on this issue can be done but most won't pay for them. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> Can you clarify what you mean about not paying for forensics? </s>
<s> Are you saying the manufacture can do forensics but they won't do it for free or are you referring to something else? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> You asked for the reason this happened. </s>
<s> Given the details so far not much can be guessed. </s>
<s> While we all know that many of these drives arrive in the rather fragile FAT32 formatting your post is void of that small detail. </s>
<s> There is also an issue of what happens if you plug that into someone else's machine. </s>
<s> If you want answers they do cost. </s>
<s> Places like http://www.drivesavers.com may offer that answer for a price. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yeah i formatted this to NTFS after I bought the hard drive. </s>
<s> Also what would the issues be if I plugged this to another computer? </s>
<s> &quot;what would the issues be if I plugged this to another computer?&quot; Same as any other device. </s>
<s> Can become corrupt, infected, etc. </s>
<s> All and anything that can go wrong can go wrong. </s>
<s> Its just one of the possible things that you would put on the list. </s>
<s> How are the titles I listed working for you? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hi, It seems to me, a logical problem. </s>
<s> Please don't create any new files and try some logical recovery program to retrieve the partitions. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Regards Laura </s>
<s> Hey, I downloaded both of the programs you suggested but when I open them it does not detect the hard drives at all so I cannot run any diagnostics. </s>
<s> This seems strange since my computer sees the 3 partitioned drives for the external hard drive...it just shows no data. </s>
