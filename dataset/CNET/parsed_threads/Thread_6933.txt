<s> Hey all, Im trying to reformat my hardrive to get rid of the minor kincks in the sytem. </s>
<s> And as long as Im wiping clean the HD might as well get the most out of it via partions. </s>
<s> Ive read an article here on a methode of backing up just the vital files like the service packs and all the other updates by installing them onto a separate partition from all the other stuff. </s>
<s> The question is, what do I need to 1. reformat the HD and 2. partion it. </s>
<s> I have the original Win. </s>
<s> Xp Pro. </s>
<s> cd and the intallation cd that came with the HD-Maxtor SATA 100GB Ultra Series. </s>
<s> Thanks in advanced. </s>
<s> When you start the install, one of the options will be to reformat and also to set the size of the boot partition [also select NTFS or FAT32]. </s>
<s> Then you can finish the install. </s>
<s> When XP is all set up, go into disk management and do the partitioning of the rest of the drive. </s>
<s> Remember that the partition that you want is called a logical drive. </s>
<s> You create a partiton and then divide that into logical drives or make the entire partition the logical drive. </s>
<s> Typical MS terminology confusion. </s>
