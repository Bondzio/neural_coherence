<s> Will I damage my computer if I replace my current 250w power supply with a 300w or higher model? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> amount of current that they need. </s>
<s> The voltages out of the supply to the devices is precisely regulated for voltage [5, 12, 3.3] thus the devices have no idea how much power the supply could provide. </s>
<s> Based on a standard supply, not a proprietary system such as the old Dells which used different wiring in the same connector. </s>
<s> Make sure it is the correct replacement type. </s>
<s> You didn't mention anything of your system. </s>
<s> But, installing a higher wattage unit is OK provided the connections are the same type, etc.. </s>
