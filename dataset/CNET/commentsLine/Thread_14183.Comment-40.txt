that would make it 1989... the thing had 64 kb of memory, and had to be hooked on a tv... it could load games by a usb key (lol), actually, the only way to feed it some data was through a tape recorder... later 5 inch soft floppy came out, but it was too damn expensive for me to get... since then i've gone through - 4x86 @ 66 mhz with 4 mb ram and 512 mb hard disk - pentium 1 @ 133 mhz with 16 mb ram and 1 gb hard disk (and a cd drive) - pentium 3 @ 450 mhz with 128 mb ram and 10 gb hard disk (and a cd burner) - pentium 3 @ 550 mhz with 64 mb ram (first laptop @ home) - pentium 3 @ 800 mhz with 64 mb ram (biggest crap i've purchased from hp) (and a dvd rom) - p4 @ 2.6 ghz (quite a jump, but happened in 2-3 years time) with 1 gb ram and 120 gb hard drive (wow... 2-3 years) (and a dvd burner) - crapbook pro - core 2 duo @ 2.0 ghz, 2 gb ram... a modern day machine (for now) that's about 7 months old now... wow... time flies... i'll be 30 before i know it...
