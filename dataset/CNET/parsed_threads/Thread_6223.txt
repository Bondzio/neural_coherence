<s> or inches, of the following: half height drive slim drive Which of these is standard? </s>
<s> I am trying to find a DVD Recorder for a Dell 4500S. </s>
<s> The height in this is about 1 1/8 inches outside the box measurement. </s>
<s> Thanks for any and all help Gordon </s>
<s> My advice is to get it from Dell, but my better advice is to go external. </s>
<s> The fastest speed I see today on internals is 2X. </s>
<s> This means that a full DVD recording session will be on the order of about 40 minutes. </s>
<s> If you get an external 8X drive, it could cost much less and bring that time down to under 20 minutes. </s>
<s> In fact, my external USB 2.0 and Fireware case was 35 dollars. </s>
<s> The 8X I picked up was 99 bucks on sale and it's been great. </s>

<s> Bob, Thanks for your response. </s>
<s> I tried 2 e-mails to Dell Sales and got nothing!Thus my use of the Storage Forum, I have 6 USB ports on my Dell Dim. </s>
<s> 4500s and all are used. </s>
<s> I know I can purchase a USB hub that will add many more ports. </s>
<s> But I have been told that the more USB devices that are added, the slower the computer will be. </s>
<s> I am trying to use an internal drive that Dell calls &quot;Slim&quot;. </s>
<s> The height may be 12.7 mm. </s>
<s> As you suggest I may just go with an extenal drive. </s>

<s> I've never read or heard of such. </s>
<s> There is an issue that is not a big deal is that your USB Hub must share the bandwidth, but if I add a PC-Card USB 2.0, then I see full speed from those ports (as fast as PC-Card can go.) </s>
<s> And the USB 2.0 hub is a good idea since I use one like a dock. </s>
<s> Makes for fast getaways. </s>
