<s> My wife bought this computer 2 or 3 years ago running vista and it came with windows media center. </s>
<s> I'd like to hook it up to my tv to watch shows and quit using my laptop however it doesn't have the proper board. </s>
<s> I need one with an s-video out but I don't know just what to look for. </s>
<s> Has anyone else done this? </s>
<s> Maybe an HD 4350? </s>
<s> It doesn't require any power connectors and has an S-video out and should give you great performance. </s>
<s> And it's fanless; no noise. </s>
