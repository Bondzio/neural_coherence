1.1.1	I'm wondering if my PSU and motherboard will support a new GPU and CPU upgrade.	St
1.1.2	http://www.sevenforums.com/hardware-devices/98358-can-i-upgrade.html#post850576 My original post is there please read it and give me your opinion.	Sug
1.1.3	Maybe someone here can straighten it out I have two people saying I can upgrade the CPU and another saying I can't.	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	What about the GPU?	St
1.3.2	Can my PSU handle that?	St
1.3.3	The +12 v rating min is 1.0a and 16a max on the psu.	St
1.4.1	According to NVidia's website; the 9800 GT requires at least 105 watts of power (Minimum Recommended System Power 400 watts), as well as (2) 6 pin power connectors.	St
1.4.2	The Phenom II x4 955 BE requires 125 watts of power...so if your current PSU is 450 watts, with no 6 pin GPU connectors, I'd have to say that you're SOL for the PSU.	St
1.4.3	http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_geforce_9800gt_us.html (see thermal and power specs) I would have to concur with posters from the other forum; your current motherboard only supports AMD Phenom CPU's up to (and including) the 9600 Agena series, and is limited to 65 watts max.	St
