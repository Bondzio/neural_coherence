1.1.1	Hello , as in my title .	St
1.1.2	I 've just built a new windows 7 64bit home prem .	St
1.1.3	machine for use as an HTPC , the problems I am having are as follow : - Firstly , I should mention that one of the sticks of RAM I put in the PC was corrupted which caused all sorts of issues but on removing that a lot cleared up but I am still left with the following issues .	St
1.1.4	( windows memory diagnostic also confirmed this stick has errors ) .	St
1.1.5	Also with the bad stick of RAM out I have run the Hload ( Heavy Load ) stress testing program for in excess of 4 hours with no problems .	St
1.1.6	Also when I first powered on the system I had an old copy of windows XP on the HDD which started to load up , could this have somehow corrupted the motherboard as it is specifically designed for Win7/Vista ?	Ques
1.1.7	Problems remaining : - 1 .	St
1.1.8	Powering on the system from a cold start results in a blank screen ( No BIOS/POST Screen ) then on powering down and trying again it works and proceeds to load windows .	St
1.1.9	2 .	St
1.1.10	When returning from sleep I get similar issues as above , the system hangs before the post screen , but sometimes it works .	St
1.1.11	3 .	St
1.1.12	Using windows reset or the motherboard reset button also makes it hang before the POST screen 50 % of the time .	St
1.1.13	The system specification is as follows : - CPU Intel E7500 Core2Duo 2.93 GHz Mobo ASUS P5G41T-M LX RAM OCZ Gold 4GB ( 2x2GB ) DDR3 PC3-10666C9 1333MHz ( of which I am only using one stick as one is faulty according to windows memory diagnostic ) Graphics card EVGA GeForce GT 430 1024MB GDDR3 PCI-Express TV Card Hauppauge HVR1700 PCI-E HDD Western Digital 2500YS 250GB SATA PSU Antec 350Watt ATX DVD Drive Pioneer OEM Writer This looks to be a hardware fault , although I could be wrong .	St
1.1.14	My question is , which piece of hardware is it , could it be a bad motherboard or PSU , or would doing somthing like reflashing the BIOS work , or reformatting windows ?	Ques
1.1.15	Thankyou for reading my post and any advice you can give !	St
1.1.16	Tom .	St
1.2.1	I 'd start with the power supply but first I 'd ask if it was new or old .	St
1.2.2	At 350 watts you do ok with P3 and some P4 systems that are minimally configured and the PS is in decent shape .	St
1.3.1	The PSU is indeed second hand , and from help from someone on another forum I have found that the Graphics card needs a 22A 12V Rail and this one only has around 17Amps .	St
1.3.2	So looks like its a mistake on my part .	St
1.3.3	Now I am thinking its the PSU it does seem like the symptoms I am describeing are to do with lack of power .	St
1.3.4	Thanks for your help Steven !	Polite
1.3.5	I 'll keep this forum posted on my progress , I am looking at ordering a 22Amp 12Vrail 500Watt PSU now .	St
1.3.6	Tom .	St
1.4.1	The 550W PSU ( link below ) comes in at 41A http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16817139004 VAPCMD	Ques
