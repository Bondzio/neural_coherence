<s> http://www.pos.epson.co.uk/products/printers/tmt88iii/index.htm notes that this printer (yours uses the same command codes) can do this, but since I consider this not a freebie endeavor I will only share its possible and don't do such work for free. </s>
<s> Sorry, Bob </s>
<s> Dear Mr. Bob, Can you instruction me like that: - There is program, that can load bitmap into printer, in this program, it can send command to order printer print out that bitmap. </s>
<s> ( you can see this program: Epson TM Flash Logo Utility's in http://www.epsonexpert.com/ ) - But how to order printer print out that bitmap in other aplication program? </s>
<s> It mean I have to know the command line and write it in printer drive such as Generic/text only. </s>
<s> (in this drive, I can adding command line to printer) Here is I don't know exactly how to set the command to order printer print out bitmap such as flash program. </s>
<s> Hope that you can know my mind and show me where can find that knowleadge. </s>
<s> Thank for your instruction. </s>
<s> Long Lt </s>
<s> I don't do many POS systems or terminals. </s>
<s> However, those that were done, suggest that the printer comes &quot;pre-loaded&quot; and was replaced. </s>
<s> I haven't seen one programmed out in the field. </s>
<s> The process maybe easy to do to transfer the logo, but not the make-up of the logo, so alot is in the air. </s>
<s> At best, you may get by with some &quot;text message&quot;. </s>
<s> On top of that some special s/w or standalone h/w would be needed to deal directly with the ptr. </s>
<s> at hand. </s>
