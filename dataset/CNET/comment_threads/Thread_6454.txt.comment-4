I don't use Netflix or watch any movies online if you are referring to me being the one that in doing that might cause the internet speed to be slower.
Or is it possible due to being on cable that people in my area using things like Netflix also affect &quot;MT&quot; internet speed as well?
I remember reading years ago that if enough people in the area are using the cable for internet, it can affect the speed whereas that doesn't apply to the DSL speed.
