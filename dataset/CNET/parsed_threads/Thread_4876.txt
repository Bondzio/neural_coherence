<s> I did several tests with occt and latencymon when I do 100% load to cpu or 100% load to gpu it's working fine when using 100% load on both the same time I got frame rate drop in spikes and hiccups on the 3d rendering I did a latency test with latencymon. </s>
<s> it was actually ok I even got less latency under heavy load then with normal use of pc Switching between programs gives a short high latency spike though in short how can I make the hiccups and framerate drops dissepear? </s>
<s> If you've been around there is a race between games that tax the hardware and hardware that improves and provides more CPU/GPU power. </s>
<s> If you reach some plateau then you have to improve or replace the PC or parts. </s>
<s> It's a shame you only posted what you did and not the reason you did all this latency testing. </s>
<s> In itself it's just a test and doesn't mean there is a real problem to solve. </s>
<s> Also, not a word about your Pentium 4 machine? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> ii'll go in more detail i have the problem with games on high settings give this framerate drops and sometimes my pc crashes because of it I was looking on the internet for a possible cause and ended op testing serveral things </s>
<s> I find that I get to check out the machine's power and cooling far sooner than diving into any latency tests. </s>
<s> Too bad there is so little detail about this PC. </s>

<s> my psu average should be 455w it has a 600w ocz zs single rail 12v has 38 amps on it (those are calculations I did) motherboard is gigabyte GA-H67MA-USB3-B3 i'm using a vga screen (not dvi or hdmi) samsung e2220n ram Kingston 2x2gb KHW1600c9D3BIK2/4GX processor core i5 2400 hard disk Western digital WD1002FAEX caviar black 3 120mm fans with fan control on the case </s>
<s> I haven't seen short term cooling problems for long term I can't say </s>
<s> video card is a radeon 7870 ghz edition </s>
<s> You always run into clients that tell you how many fans are on the case or &quot;it's not heat.&quot; I don't see the video (could have missed it) but you see the 8800's and others failing now. </s>
<s> You asked about latency so let's read this from toms. </s>
<s> &quot;Our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a $225 LGA 1155 Core i5-2500K and a $1000 LGA 2011 Core i7-3960X, even when three-way graphics card configurations are involved. </s>
<s> It turns out that memory bandwidth and PCIe throughput don't hold back the performance of existing Sandy Bridge-based machines. </s>
<s> &quot; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-cpu-review-overclock,3106-4.html Since you have a nearly same CPU and it can drive three cards without much issue, your issue must be somewhere else. </s>
<s> If it's crashing, then you know to try the usual. </s>
<s> Ask if you didn't know. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> and it gave around 75&#176;C at 100% load for one hour </s>
<s> But I've watched folk run MemTest for weeks and still have a memory issue. </s>
<s> You bring up a great point. </s>
<s> How did this industry get here without decent diagnostics? </s>
<s> (No, I really don't know.) </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I have some knowledge about it but not enough I think so you may spell it out </s>
<s> I missed what video card is in use. </s>
<s> When I see such I replace the heat sink compounds as we can't see what the original builder did. </s>
<s> Be sure to nod and smile at your client but do the work. </s>
<s> Leave the side cover off and point some fan at it and try again. </s>
<s> If it crashes take the inventory of the machine to ask if others are seeing this. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thank you for the advice, i'll take some time tommorrow to try it out then I'll say what I see </s>
<s> And find out this is an older card or one of the 8400/8600 line. </s>
<s> Even the 8800's are failing now. </s>
<s> Just old cards. </s>
<s> Some clients morn the loss. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I didn't clean the heatsink yet but I noticed what's the problem here I checked the cpu usage while running the gpu on 100% it only takes 5 to 10% of cpu usage but when my cpu and gpu are 100% loaded he can't do that 5 to 10% cpu usage correctly hence the framerate spike drops I do get this problem with games because it probably taxes my cpu too much as well I thought he would just lower the framerate of th gpu to compensate the load on the cpu but apperently i'm wrong </s>
<s> tdp of the cpu is probably the cause of my pc crashing </s>
<s> &quot;video card is a radeon 7870 ghz edition&quot;. </s>
<s> See 5th message in string. </s>
<s> It's obviously a buggy machine. </s>
<s> Ask the maker/seller what to exchange. </s>
<s> Sure, you could do the usual BIOS and driver updates and hope but this one is back to it's makers since it's failing when new. </s>
