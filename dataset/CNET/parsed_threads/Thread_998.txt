<s> Hello, I am having some problems with my drivers on my PC, they keep giving me a blue screen of death so I have decided to uninstall them, however I was looking at the uninstall guide and I did not understand step 7 Here the link to the uninstall guide. </s>
<s> http://www.voyager.bt.com/selfhelp/s...nstall_win.htm What does it mean by explore the 105 CD? </s>
<s> do I have to insert a CD or something at this point or does this screenshot automatically appear? </s>
<s> Also the last step requires me to reboot my pc, if I click reboot would I loose all my data that is saved on my PC? </s>
<s> what happens when I reboot, will the PC start again as normal? </s>
<s> or do I have to insert a CD or something? </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated, Thank you </s>
<s> First of all, the link doesn't work. </s>
<s> Part of it is replaced by ... Can you post a working link? </s>
<s> - Why do you think it's those drivers that give the blue screen? </s>
<s> - What device are we talking about? </s>
<s> - The usual way to uninstall drivers is to delete the device from Device Manager. </s>
<s> But I think it's more that drivers here. </s>
<s> What I think: - &quot;exploring the cd&quot; means &quot;put in the cd and open it in My Computer or Windows Explorer&quot;. </s>
<s> I can't say more at the moment because the link doesn't work - &quot;rebooting&quot; is no more than shutdown and start again (without the CD in the drive). </s>
<s> You won't lose any more data than you loose every night/morning when you do the same. </s>
<s> So you won't lose anything that you did save. </s>
<s> Kees - </s>
<s> Thanks for your reply, sorry about the link this one should work now http://www.voyager.bt.com/selfhelp/shc/usbuninstall/105_uninstall_win.htm </s>
<s> Hannah, It is as I thought. </s>
<s> In step 6 you clicked No, I don't want to reboot now. </s>
<s> Now, insert the CD and in My Computer browse to it. </s>
<s> Once you've done that step 7 instructs you to doubleclick Remid. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Also the reason I think it's the drivers that are causing the blue screen error is because when I restart my computer I get a message saying 'your computer has recovered from a serious error send error report to Microsoft'. </s>
<s> which I do and than another screen appears telling me the problem was caused by ADSL USB Modem (glausb.sys). </s>
<s> So the drivers must be corrupt right? </s>
<s> p.s sorry about my lack on technical language! </s>
<s> I dont know much about computers. </s>
<s> And are you sure I wont loose any of my work? </s>
<s> Cause I got a lot of my college work on there, and if I loose it I might just die! </s>
<s> Hey I just realised I dont actually have the 105 CD, I only have the CD AOL provided me with and that was How the drivers were installed, if I insert that CD than I dont think I can do step 7, because that CD starts up my AOL account! </s>
<s> all it gets you to do is follow the on screen prompts. </s>
<s> what do you recommend I do? </s>
<s> You seem to be right about that message. </s>
<s> But I hope you realize that your ADSL (Internet connection) won't work anymore after you uninstall that driver. </s>
<s> So I hope you've got some other way to get to the Internet. </s>
<s> And there's no need to send the report to Microsoft if it's caused by BT software. </s>
<s> Did you already contact their helpdesk? </s>
<s> If it's their program, they should now what to do about it. </s>
<s> No need to make an excuse for your language. </s>
<s> It's perfectly understandable. </s>
<s> I'm sure you won't lose any of your work. </s>
<s> Once you've uninstalled your driver, however, go our Computer Newbies forum and ask them for advice on BACKUP. </s>
<s> That's making a copy of your precious work on some other device (like a CD or DVD or USB-stick or external hard disk) so you won't lose it your computer breaks down or gets a serious virus or you delete the original just by accident. </s>
<s> Tell them how much data you have (maybe pictures and music also, or do you use this machine for schoolwork only?). </s>
<s> Better be safe than sorry, isn't it? </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Keep shift pressed when you insert the CD. </s>
<s> Nothing will happen then and you can open it in My Computer. </s>
<s> If that doesn't work, I'm sure there is a &quot;cancel&quot; button somewhere to click on before anything serious happens. </s>
<s> Then, after canceling, you can do your step 7. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> oh thanks I will check that out, and no I dont had any other way of getting on the internet, I was thinking on uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers, that would surely fix the problem? </s>
<s> and I am still stuck on step 7 as I dont think I have the CD they are talking about. </s>
<s> I know I should change from using BT voyager 105 USB ADSL modem, as it is quite outdated. </s>
<s> What do you recommend I do? </s>
<s> If you don't have the CD, how could you reinstall the drivers then? </s>
<s> Moreover, it isn't sure it would fix the problem. </s>
<s> If it would, it would do so without uninstalling also, most of the time. </s>
<s> Just reinstall the same drivers from the same CD as you did when you got the modem. </s>
<s> What I should do: contact your ISP that gave you the modem. </s>
<s> They might have a newer one, all ready to install, coming with a CD, or recommend you one that then mention the setup instructions of on their help pages. </s>
<s> Or they might know what to do about the current error. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Okay thanks for your help I shall try out what you have suggested. </s>
<s> thank you! </s>
<s> And just one more question =) If I just left things as they were would that damage my computer? </s>
<s> Cause all I do is just restart my PC every time I get the blue screen error. </s>
<s> It happens every few week or so </s>
<s> NIL </s>
