<s> I've been recently having problems with my PC. </s>
<s> For the past week, it's been freezing up in the middle of using it, but upon restarting it would be fine. </s>
<s> Until today that is, when I tried restarting it and it says &quot;Master Drive Fails&quot; and &quot;Slave Drive Fails&quot;. </s>
<s> The master is a 40GB Maxtor HD and the slave is a 250 GB Western Digital HD (I know, should probably switch the master and slave). </s>
<s> Anyway, I find it hard to believe that both drives would be corrupted, at least at the same time anyway. </s>
<s> Is there any way to fix this problem, or at least transfer my data to a new drive. </s>
<s> I'd prefer not to take it to the Geek Squad because they charge an arm and a leg so I'd like to just do it myself if possible. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> As to data recovery, that's so expensive that most won't get their files back. </s>
<s> As to geek squad you usually only surrender money for them to tell you the drive has failed. </s>
<s> Go ahead if you must. </s>
<s> Again. </s>
<s> Just one drive at a time to see how that works and a new IDE cable just to be sure. </s>

<s> Checked the capacitors ? </s>
<s> Lot's of possibilities....why not download the mfg's diags and see what they say ? </s>
