<s> Hi Friends, Building a 1U Linux Server is different from building a normal tower case because 1U is equal to 1.75 inches in height and I realized that it will be working within a smaller space than with other computer cases. </s>
<s> To this end, power supplies, fans, video cards, network cards, hard drives and CD-ROM drives all have been made with a lower height requirement. </s>
<s> So, I want to learn the process to build a 1U Linux Server. </s>
<s> If anyone having idea on it, then please share with me and help me for my mission. </s>
<s> Thanks and Regards, Rodger Hooks </s>
<s> so I'm locking this. </s>

<s> But such servers are readily available and all you do is install your server OS. </s>
<s> No one I know builds the hardware unless you count installing it into a rack. </s>
