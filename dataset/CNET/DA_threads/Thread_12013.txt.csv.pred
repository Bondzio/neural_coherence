1.1.1	My Lexmark X7170 printer prints extra black vertical bars when I copy or print anything .	St
1.1.2	I first noticed this when I was attempting to print a page from the internet .	St
1.1.3	I thought it might have been grayed out areas from the internet site .	St
1.1.4	Then I copied the page to Word and printed .	St
1.1.5	The same bars showed up .	St
1.1.6	Then I put a document on the scanner and copied .	St
1.1.7	The bars continue to appear .	St
1.1.8	I had the Black cartridge refiled before this happened .	St
1.1.9	Could this be the culprit ?	Ques
1.2.1	If you 've been around the usual service counters you find consumers that ca n't use a new cart since it costs more than a new printer .	St
1.2.2	And printers over 2 years old with rare exception are never serviced but tossed and replaced .	St
1.2.3	The x7170 looks to be that old .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I did n't want to buy another cartridge without being pretty sure the old refilled cartridge was the problem .	St
1.3.2	I know this is an older printer but it has been working great until lately .	St
1.3.3	I will buy another cartridge and hopefully this will solve my problem .	St
1.4.1	It could be the cartridge but it could also be traces of ink on the rollers , in that case you 'd get some roller cleaning sheets , available at most box stores .	St
1.4.2	A Mr. Proffitt stated , this is a pretty old printer , if a cartridge or cleaning sheets do n't resolve the issue , time to replace .	St
1.5.1	I appreciate your offered suggestion that the rollers may need to be cleaned however the lines I see are definitely printed , not smudges .	Polite
1.5.2	They are similar to bar codes .	St
1.6.1	That having been said , have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling the printer software .	St
1.6.2	You did n't mention anything about your system , OS etc .	St
1.6.3	I 'd reinstall from scratch and also take a look at Lexmark 's site for upgrades/updates .	St
1.7.1	Does it work the same on other PCs or even the & quot ; Self Test & quot ; ?	Ques
1.8.1	I am still running Windows XP Home .	St
1.8.2	The first thing I did was to uninstall and reinstall the drivers .	St
1.8.3	The Lexmark site provided me with no information on my printer .	St
1.9.1	I have not connected my printer to another computer .	St
1.9.2	The problem was there when I printed a print head alignment page .	St
1.9.3	I am assuming that would be like a self test .	St
1.9.4	The problem is also there when I make a copy .	St
1.9.5	I am convinced the problem is in the refiled printer cartridge .	St
1.10.1	And not the PC .	St
1.11.1	That , too , is part of my problem .	St
1.11.2	I do n't have another PC to connect the printer to .	St
1.11.3	When it prints the problem while making a direct copy and from the head alignment it convinces me the problem is in the cartridge .	St
1.12.1	But when I wrote the printer , a cartridge is part of the printer however I 've seen such things and only those new to the repair counter would know it 's the cart .	St
1.12.2	But worth changing as it 's cheap .	St
1.12.3	Bob	St
1.13.1	Evidently this unit has been problematic , there seem to be some fixes that Lexmark offers , driver fixes , etc .	St
1.13.2	Typically a cartridge should n't create garbling , I 'm still software suspicious .	St
1.14.1	They see it on a copy without using a PC so that 's a sign .	St
1.14.2	Not a good one .	Polite
1.15.1	Yuppers , toast city ... unless , and I doubt , it is simply the cartridge .	St
1.16.1	Reply to the top .	St
1.16.2	Yes , I know it 's not threaded but it 's how this buggy works .	St
