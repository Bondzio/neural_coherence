<s> I own a Cavalry 500 GB external HDD which I purchased on August 22, 2007. </s>
<s> It has worked great and I have not had any problems with it until today. </s>
<s> I took my external HDD to my friends house, so we could watch a movie on his TV. </s>
<s> My HDD was hooked up to his laptop which was connected to his TV. </s>
<s> The laptop was sitting on top of his TV cabinet and was pretty well supported and the HDD was resting vertically on the floor. </s>
<s> It was really really odd, but during the movie the laptop flipped off the cabinet and fell on my HDD. </s>
<s> My HDD then fell from the vertical position to the horizontal position, and momentarily after it started to make a weird noise - like it was trying to spin, but it could not. </s>
<s> Then the movie froze and the computer did not find the drive. </s>
<s> The HDD turns on and it starts to spin, and it sounds like it tries to spin several times, but it does not seem to spin all the way. </s>
<s> I am not sure if maybe some part became loose inside, or if there is damage to the magnetic drive itself. </s>
<s> I opened it up, and took the external case off, but I could not figure out how to take the actual drive apart. </s>
<s> I did not know what tool to use, I can send pictures to anyone if they would like to look. </s>
<s> I was just hoping maybe something got knocked loose inside. </s>
<s> So, my real questions are the following: 1) Is there anyway for me to tell what is wrong with my drive? </s>
<s> 2) If my drive is not fixable, is there any cheap way to get the contents off the drive? </s>
<s> When I came back home and plugged it into my laptop, it started to whir except the noise was different and it was louder. </s>
<s> Then my laptop detected a USB mass storage device and said new hardware found, and the HDD tried to spin several times but then it just stops and becomes silent. </s>
<s> Sometimes you get lucky and it's just the case. </s>
<s> A new external case? </s>
<s> I would like to see if there is anything I could do first without spending money. </s>
<s> I usually just wait till the owner gives up and tries the drive in some desktop or a new case. </s>
<s> Sorry if this seems cruel. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Well, I guess I am going to try to open it up all the way - even the internal part. </s>
<s> Is there anything in particular that I should look for on the inside that might be out of place? </s>
<s> I try the new case since it's usually that. </s>
<s> That is, the power failed in said case. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> I am not really sure. </s>
<s> The HDD is detected by Windows, but the HDD just doesn't seem to load all the way. </s>
<s> Oh well, if I can't get it then whatever. </s>
<s> I appreciate all of your responses and help. </s>
<s> I will let you know how everything turns out. </s>
<s> If you put it in some desktop, case, etc. </s>
<s> I don't know if it's time to mention data recovery software such as RECUVA, GETDATABACK or ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY. </s>
