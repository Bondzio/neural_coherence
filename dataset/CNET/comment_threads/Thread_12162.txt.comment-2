Not sure what dirver you have, but the specs.
for your board say that it has the 3D PCI Sound Pro, on board audio.
Typing that into Google reveals several sources for the driver.
It seems that pcchips no longer offers any support for your board, but other sites offer the drivers.
I've had to try several with older boards, before finding one that will work.
You may need to do some fishing for it.
Best of Luck
