I have three computers that connect to a US Robotics router.
The first two computers are fine.
The third one, however, seems invisible to the first two, even though it can see THEM.
All computers have Norton Firewall, which are all set to allow the network activity.
What gets me, is that all computers can ping each other with no problems.
What the heck is wrong with this third computer?
They are all running Windows XP.
