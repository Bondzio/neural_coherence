Hi all, Is there anyone own a HP PSC 1610 All-in-One Printer/Scanner ?
I'v just bought one and to my dissappointment, I think the scanning quality is quite bad.
Attached a scanned sample here: [IMG] http://i29.photobucket.com/albums/c267/liewss80/hp-scanner.jpg [/IMG] (If cant view the above pic, goto http://i29.photobucket.com/albums/c267/liewss80/hp-scanner.jpg ) Check out those straight lines in the attached picture, my original drawing is a very clean-cut straightline, very fine but my scanned result is like this.
Its the problem with my scanner or setting?
Any advise/comment?
Thank you Regards, Sean liewss80@yahoo.com
