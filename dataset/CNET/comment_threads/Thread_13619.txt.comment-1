These 2 monitors are on eBay for the EXACT same price ($119.99w/free shipping), and I would like to know which would be the best bang for my buck.
Again, they are the ASUS VE228H, and the VIEWSONIC VX2250WM.
Please DO NOT recommend me ANY other monitor, unless YOU can find it in the same price range.
If you can find a better monitor with DVI, HDMI inputs and a 1080p resolution under $119 altogether then PLEASE tell me.
Thanks.
