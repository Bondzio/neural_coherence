<s> Hi im thinking about getting a server anyone have any thoughts? </s>
<s> thanks mega-34 </s>
<s> Your question is really broad in scope. </s>
<s> Depending on what you need it to do, you may be able to use an older computer that you already own. </s>
<s> Tell us more about your goals. </s>
<s> for storing stuff and some online gaming. </s>
<s> iv got $400 saved up for it. </s>
<s> if i uae an old computer how do i turn that into a server? </s>
<s> Sorry but there is little known here and 400 bucks is very slim for a server since 100 bucks is not much to ask for just the hard disk and not much is left. </s>
<s> Let's say we could use Linux. </s>
<s> Here's a guide. </s>
