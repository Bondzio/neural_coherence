1.1.1	I was wondering if someone could verify that this is the correct memory for the motherboard, links are below.... thank you in advance for your help!	St
1.1.2	Memory - http://cgi.ebay.com/MAJOR-1GB-DDR2-PC2-6300-800-MHZ-240-PIN-PC-6400-1-GB_W0QQitemZ130318959015QQcmdZViewItemQQptZLH_DefaultDomain_0?hash=item1e579d81a7&_trksid=p3286.c0.m14#ht_3297wt_732 Motherboard - http://www.gigabyte.com.tw/Products/Motherboard/Products_Spec.aspx?ProductID=2507	St
1.2.1	recommendation based on many years experience would be something like this.	St

1.3.1	awesome, i will take your advice, so that's the ram i need to fit that mobo in the link you sent?	Sug
1.3.2	i'm always a little cautious because i ordered the wrong ram once.	St
1.3.3	thank you for your input!	Polite
1.4.1	kits... 2-1GB DIMMs.	St
1.4.2	Let us know how it works.	St

1.5.1	my son (10 yrs) bought the system for $125, 180gb hd, speakers, lcd monitor with a few scratches, not too shabby!	St
1.6.1	By the way....as soon as you get the RAM, unplug the PC, check the mfg instructions re installing RAM, remove all old RAM and install new RAM.	St
1.6.2	Then download and run Memtest86+ to test the RAM say overnight.	St
1.6.3	Assuming no errors...button up the PC and enjoy !	St
1.6.4	Good experience for a Father and Son.	St
1.6.5	And last...shoot us a note on how it went.	St
1.6.6	VAPCMD	St
1.7.1	I pulled the old ram out, assuming it had 2 sticks of 256 because it showed in bios as only 1/2 gig, to my surprise it had 2 sticks of 512.	St
1.7.2	I put the new sticks of 1 gig each in and it is only recognizing 1 gig and single channel, can anyone shed some light on how to get this motherboard to recognize both gig and as dual channel?	St
1.7.3	thanks!	St
1.8.1	work in slot 1 or A, then see if they both work in slot 2 or B.	St
1.8.2	If the both work in both slots, the retry bot at the same time.	St
1.8.3	Also send a note to GSkill asking for assistance.	St
1.8.4	Keep us posted.	St
1.8.5	VAPCMD	St
1.9.1	someone said i should flash the bios but which one should i flash it with?	St
1.9.2	none of them say anything about ram, only cpu http://www.gigabyte.com.tw/Support/Motherboard/BIOS_Model.aspx?ProductID=2507	St
1.10.1	first including testing the DIMMs and contacting GSkill.	St
1.10.2	Reason ...flashing the BIOS can leave you DOA where normally only a new BIOS chip can save you.	St
1.10.3	It might be the case a mild bump in voltage for the DIMMs might help too.	St
1.10.4	VAPCMD	St
