http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&dlc=en&cc=us&docname=c00100539 I see this and crucial noting you can installl 2 (two) 512MB sticks for a total of 1GB.
This is no offer to detail why 1GB sticks show up as 1/4 or 1/2 size.
They should and do.

That would take a too long discussion about chip selects and circuit design.
It's a common issue and why we stick with supported sticks on the list.
