here are my recommedations for mid-range pci express cards with 256mb ram that will be great upgrades for your m7570n.
higher price = higher performance and the 7900gs for $170 is probably the best bang for the buck.
$110: evga geforce 7600gts http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=322829 $140: evga geforce 7600gt ko http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=322786 $190: evga geforce 7900gs ko ($20 rebate avail) http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=322825 $205: sapphire radeon x1950pro http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=326853 I couldn't find the rating on your power supply so I suggest you check it.
All of the cards above suggest a 400W unit, but the 7600gt and lower could get by with 350W.
Here's a good 430W unit for $40.
