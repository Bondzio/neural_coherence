<s> Hello guys/gals, Some amatuer computer techy built my grandpa's PC. </s>
<s> He turned out to be a ******* so since then, I'm the techy. </s>
<s> A day ago the computer started to make beeping noises with 8 seconds between each beep... </s>
<s> It just beeps on and on and on... </s>
<s> I changed the CMOS battery, cleaned the RAM area, switched sticks, switched Keyboard, the video card is built in the motherboard. </s>
<s> I don't know what company the motherboard is.. there's no sticker or logo anywhere in site. </s>
<s> the PC monitor turns on and says CHECK SIGNAL CABLE. </s>
<s> The guy who built the PC gave us no documantions about anything... ( manuals etc.) </s>
<s> What do I do?! </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> While there are plenty of web sites to note how to install the CPU heatsink proper I can't supply the right one given so little about the machine. </s>
<s> You could look at the motherboard to find it's make and model. </s>
<s> Please be aware I won't respond if you ask me how to find the make/model without opening the machine since to fix this we will be going inside the box. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I've already opened the box.. ( I switched the CMOS battery and cleaned the RAM area) The motherboard has no sticker, logo... the big fan on it says Intel.. thats it. </s>
<s> Both found with google.com BELARC ADVISOR EVEREST But time and time again I open the box and ID the motherboard. </s>
<s> I never give up on finding the markings. </s>
<s> But leave the cover off for now until you can sort out the issues or get the CPU fan working (you are not telling details...) Bob </s>
<s> http://www.computerhope.com/beep.htm </s>
<s> The CPU fan is running fine... all the fans run, and all the connections are OK. Each time I open the PC it starts up and just beeps. </s>
<s> The PC monitor says CHECK SIGNAL CABLE. </s>
<s> I highly doubt the CPU overheated because the computer is used just for surfing the web and playing Freecell. </s>
<s> The Video card and Sound card are built on the motherboard. </s>
<s> There is only one RAM stick ( It's connected OK ). </s>
<s> http://www.computerhope.com doesn't help because none of the beeps they wrote down match my beeping. </s>
<s> its just long beeps every 8 seconds and don't stop until I shutdown the PC. </s>
<s> So you have to be our eyes and ears plus use supplied tools and report back gritty details. </s>
<s> You didn't tell if you left to cover off and if it had any effect. </s>
<s> You may not have checked the fan for proper seating. </s>
<s> And I see no report output from the supplied softwares that help you determine what is in the machine. </s>
<s> Once we get a board make/model we go get it's manual and see what the beep code means. </s>
<s> This may sound crass but it's to motivate you and explain something. </s>
<s> This is not tech support. </s>
<s> It's free support so you have to get out and push along or you won't get to the bottom of the issue. </s>
<s> It's either a heat issue or there is a fan sensor that isn't working. </s>
<s> In the CPU fan there is a new thing with 3 wires. </s>
<s> 2 are for power the third is the CPU RPM sensor. </s>
<s> If someone ran that to the wrong connection something like that can happen. </s>
<s> But all this guessing vanishes if we can get to the make/model then the manual of the motherboard. </s>
<s> Apply yourself a little with the resources noted and I'm pretty sure we'll cure the beep issue and maybe other items. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I can't run the softwares you advised me to check because the computer doesn't work... </s>
<s> The fans run and the beeping starts and the PC monitor says CHECK SIGNAL CABLE. </s>
<s> I've checked every inch of the motherboard. </s>
<s> No logo, no company name, nothing. </s>
<s> Thanks for the patience Bob. </s>
<s> That beeping with no boot is typical when... 1. </s>
<s> There is no RAM installed. </s>
<s> Your machine's maker could have done a dirty deed and taken some RAM out? </s>
<s> Again, I don't have a clear story so I'm guessing. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The video card is not fully seated. </s>
<s> Power off and unplugged then gently reseat the video card if it has one. </s>
<s> Same for any other card or connection. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The Video Card is built on the mother board... </s>
<s> The RAM is in it's place... </s>
<s> I even switched places and cleaned it. </s>
<s> Anymore guesses? </s>
<s> Any and all markings. </s>
<s> If it is indeed void of make and model, replace it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> First off..to TEST a Monitor/unplug its Cable(DIN)from the back of the PC..and useing its AC-120volt Power cable Plugged in..Turn-ON the CRT and a NO-INPUT sign should be showing.. </s>
<s> .......ALWAYS...dis-connect AC-power when inspecting your PC.......... As for the BEEPING SOUNDS.....depends on the MotherBoard design....... My PC gives off BEEPS when NO SOUND CARD DRIVER is installed.......... Also a BEEP sound could be a &quot;SHORT&quot;/maybe NOT...but Maybe-yes........ </s>
<s> If you even OWN this machine you need DOCUMENTATION:like the Boxes that the PARTS came in....the PART Numbers....and RECEIPTS.... ...................................................................... You could possibly have a &quot;butcher&quot; JOB...where the parts from differant machines were thrown together and its actually a Rip-OFF.. ...................................................................... </s>
<s> I would NOT tamper w/this purchase or what-ever you did to bring it into your house.. ...................................................................... </s>
<s> I would move to take the TECHY to small claims court..get your money back..or get your DOCUMENTATION.. You can NOT operate a PC DeskTop w/o SPECIFICATIONS..or software CD's or the OS..CD..or security software....or an ISP.... ...................................................................... First Things First.. right off you've been had. </s>
<s> Why do you respond without reading thru and comprehending? </s>
<s> Most of your comments where made pointless by the very message you where responding to. </s>
<s> Read then answer and try to have a little class, condescension sucks ya jerk. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> If you read that post below, doesn't that sum it up well? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> No. </s>
<s> Like I said, reread the thread. </s>
<s> You come off like a know it all jerk that can't be bothered to read through the messages without posting your condescending answers. </s>
<s> It's not about content as much as professionalism and respect for your members. </s>
<s> Feel free to pitch in. </s>
<s> But I'll only write this one time. </s>
<s> These are your first posts so you may have something you need to get out. </s>
<s> Feel free to make a new post, get it over with so we can work on the issues. </s>
<s> If you feel you have the answer, please share it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Geez, it was an observation. </s>
<s> You really don't get it so ....so be it. </s>
<s> Your arrogance is astounding. </s>
<s> Enough I'm bored with you already. </s>
