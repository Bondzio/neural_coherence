i have done this with two linksys wireless-g routers as described here: connecting two wrt54g routers together .
the same networking principles should apply to connecting two different routers, but there is no guarantee of success.
*** post the particular router models that you are using.
maybe someone has done this.
it doesn't fit your situation and is more complicated, but it is possible to wirelessly connect two linksys routers with the same 3rd party firmware that is capable of implementing wds.
