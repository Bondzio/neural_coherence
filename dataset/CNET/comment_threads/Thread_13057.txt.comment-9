I had only opened a computer once before to install a NIC card; I just decided to build my own rig since it would be completely for gaming and the ones from places like alienware are way too expensive.
There are many online tutorials that help you through the process of assembling your computer - it truly is not that complicated.
I got a lot of help from people on these forums and was able to get out for under $1000, but the rigs value is much more than that.
