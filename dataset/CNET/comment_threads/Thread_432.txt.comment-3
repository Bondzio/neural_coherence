This happens in Windows XP Pro or Home.The printer is a HP deskjet 970 cse and it is attached to a Linksys EFSP42 print server.One computer has 2 gigs of ram and the other has 1 gig of ram as well as one has a P 4 and the other one has an Atholon XP processor.Both have hard drives that are 40 or more gigs in size.They have all current Windows updates and drivers.I have been able to print multiple copies before from differant applications.I have found that I can print multiple copies from Outlook but not in Word 2000.
