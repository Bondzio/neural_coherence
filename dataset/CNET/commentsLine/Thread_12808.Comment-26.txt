my 24/7 computer is an ibm tablet which i never leave home without, but as far as desktops go i still need to use one for certain tasks.
i don't need a lot of whistles and bells, television shows, games or software i don't use, but i do on occasion need the desktop for some applications.
so why pay these giant corporations who are so arrogant that they make you stay on the telephone for 20 minutes and go through menu after menu only to find out that they've put you through to the wrong person for tech assistance, when there's a local guy with a small shop who will put in what i want and only what i want, do repairs and upgrades right there, and charge me way less than the behemoths?
i've had it with supporting people who make more in an hour than i will all week.
any time i can give business to a local shop and help out the local economy rather than give money to one of these megacorporations, it helps everyone.
