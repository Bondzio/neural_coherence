<s> I am writing to ask anyone how do i obtain a copy of my cd that is used to set up my netgear routre. </s>
<s> my disk was misplaced </s>
<s> Has notes about that. </s>
<s> But this model does not require the CD to setup. </s>
<s> I know many find it harder without the CD but you can get it done. </s>

<s> how do i do it. </s>
<s> I went to the link setup by netgear but the webpage won't display or it takes me back to the support of netgear website and it wants me buy a online tech support for the router and the cost is more what the router originally cost. </s>
<s> do u have a better and easier way of doing it </s>
<s> I paid all of 25 bucks for a netgear wrn2000 and no CD. </s>
<s> It took all of 2 tries to get to the routers web page to set it up but no CD was needed. </s>
<s> I hear you want to know how to do this but if there is some other issue such as a bad cable or forgotten info then it gets harder. </s>
<s> I then press the reset button on the router and read the product manual again. </s>
<s> If that fails I may replace the router. </s>
