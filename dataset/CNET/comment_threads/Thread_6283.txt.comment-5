Sorry for not including my specs....My OS is XP home and I am running Ad-Aware Plus and Zone Labs Suite, my system is a Dell from 2001.
All of a sudden my desktop icons went from their usual designs to a file-looking format.
And I can't run most programs.
My RegSeeker icon and my recycle bin icon are normal looking, but I still can't run them.
I have to go to my start menu to run my ISP.
I've gotten into my Regedit folder and tried to get permission to edit, but am denied.
Going into my File type tab and trying to enter an exe application won't cure my problem either.
