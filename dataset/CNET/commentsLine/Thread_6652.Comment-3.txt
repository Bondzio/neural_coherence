so, router is fine, no one changed anythig, it`s new.
i installed it , configured it : put the right ip gateway dns, cloned mac, but still no internet.
when i asked the person that is in charge with the internet services(i live in a student hostel) he said that he can`t tell me what i have to do, but if i figure it by myself it will be ok. in the hostel our lan connection its limited : we can not use torrents, or things like dc++ and also we can not have routers so we can share the lan.
i really want to work this out cause i have 2 laptos , ipad and phone so i need wireless.
