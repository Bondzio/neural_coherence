i'm afraid i don't understand- i'm not that familiar with pc hardware besides the basics.
&quot;it should support any of the 32 bit amd cpus that support the 333 mhz fsb.&quot; is there a certain speed that cpus get up to before that, or would i have to check them the stats on any mb i was interested in?
and is it a difficult processor to replace the processor?
i built this pc, but with assistance, and i had all the parts already.
i currently have a amd sempron 1.66ghz.
