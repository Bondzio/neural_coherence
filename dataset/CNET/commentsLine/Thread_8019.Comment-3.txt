i am sure because they never show up in the same area.
sometimes my screen will freeze and i will have to restart my computer.
then it works fine.
it seems to happen only when i turn my comp off and then turn it back on.
when i have it running for a little while it runs fine but i have to turn it on and off twice and let it run for a couple of minutes before i restart.
other wise it runs real slow and jumpy.
i have a good feeling it has to do with the monitor and video card because i put my old monitor on and it worked fine.
i have run virus programs and everything is a ok.
