I tried a duplicate monitor and the PC works ok with that. Has anyone any idea of what was done and more importantly to me how to fix it without going to the jokers

Using those, see if you can find a &quot;default&quot; mode. then set it, now tweak it for best operation. If none of this makes sense, IBM is pretty helpful via thier support website, find your model and get a &quot;manual/guide&quot; to help you. Of course make sure that some simple pgm. isn't working that really the culpit. Report it to your boss or manager and play an April Fool's, on your fellow workers, &quot;Your're fired&quot; bye, adios, your check is in the mail.
