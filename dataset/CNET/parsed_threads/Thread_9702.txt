<s> I have just started building systems for enthusiasts and every day users. </s>
<s> The average is one syetm a day basing upon different specs.The one thing my clients require is a full system recovery option (one button recovery solution)I would like to do the following: - Create a samll partition on my hard drive for drive image and be able to hide it as well. </s>
<s> - After fully installing and optimizing Windows XP Pro alongwith system drivers create a full-system image (like the OEMs) - Be able to access the image upon boot (like that one-button recovery stuff used by OEMs) whenever I want to resort to a full system restore. </s>
<s> - Also, please advise me on which software should I be using for this purpose which should be reliable and professional. </s>
<s> Help will be appreciated! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> I only need to listen (or read) to compalints about hard disk based backup failures to learn that such is an ok idea for a spare or fast copy but is too unreliable to be called professional. </s>
<s> Maybe some bootable CD with an image would work. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> This is something you, me and few others may understand but most people like the idea of &quot;one-button recovery with no-disks-to-lose solution&quot; and probably dont consider the CONS. </s>
<s> I initially gave them the idea of a single DVD-ROM based recovery solution and I think I'll press on with it. </s>
<s> So whats your advice on this one? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> The restore CD I taped inside the case. </s>
<s> It's never lost unless they lose it. </s>
<s> As such, it's never an issue if they have to pay up for it. </s>
<s> -&gt; Such restore systems are not free unless you are a programmer. </s>
<s> Most will pay homage to Acronis or another company to add in such a feature. </s>
<s> Are you a programmer? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I wasn't one but I thin i'll have to start off with something. </s>
<s> Just integration. </s>
<s> How about Norton Ghost 9.0? </s>
<s> What do you think? </s>
<s> Have you asked them for the numbers? </s>
<s> It's a shocker. </s>
<s> Linux images are a fav but I can't teach that here. </s>
<s> It's a trick of linux and it's fdisk, dd and maybe gzip. </s>
<s> When it works it's a great thing and the price is time to make it work. </s>
<s> http://www.dantz.com/en/products/express.dtml is another software I find on some laptops and more of those external USB drives for restoring an image. </s>
<s> Again, you pay for such a priviledge. </s>
<s> Well, to my experience True Image is excellent for making a backup image of OS. </s>
<s> I always use it, and I think it'll completely satisfy your requirements. </s>
<s> You could create a small hidden partition (called Secure Zone - because of its inaccessibility to any other software) for strongly compressed drive image and further incremental backups. </s>
<s> After fully installing and optimizing Windows, drivers create a full-system image. </s>
<s> You'll be able to access the image upon boot, whenever you want to resort to a full system restore. </s>
<s> But I think the best way to make sure in it to read review about most popular backup software. </s>
<s> reviews.cnet.com </s>
<s> This is quite relevant to my requirements. </s>
