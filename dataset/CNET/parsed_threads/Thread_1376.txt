<s> Hello, I've been looking at 3 computers one is a Sony Viao, the other one is a Systemax and the the 3rd one is a V2 Premier. </s>
<s> Can anyone tell me something about these or give me some advice please, so I don't make a major mistake for the second time? </s>
<s> Thanks, Sky </s>
<s> My experience with Sony support on a dozen office laptops has me writing that Sony needs some serious whacks around the head about after-sale support. </s>
<s> Out of the 12, 6 died immediately and we spent untold hours shipping and on the phone about the units. </s>
<s> In the end, the Sony story was these were not suitable units to be placed on a business desktop for use during the day. </s>
<s> In otherwords, you should only use them for an hour or two at a time. </s>
<s> Nothing in any printed literature noted such a limitation but it may have been true since we could only manage to eek usage out of the units by having the users shutdown during lunch. </s>
<s> Another issue with a Sony is they pretty much treat it like a TV. </s>
<s> If you change the OS or add a device, the support vanishes. </s>
<s> While this can be true with other vendors, Sony seems to be more extreme with this. </s>
<s> As to the other makes, such are clones and one would have to rip off the lid and survey what's inside to tell. </s>
<s> Why not a Dell/HP? </s>

<s> Thanks for the info and the warnings, I am now looking at a Dell Pentium 4,2.6 GHZ, 533 MHZ, 512 KB front side bus, L2 cache, Intel 845 GU chipset, 16x max DVD w/software decoding, DVD+RW/+R w/CD-RW, 3.5 diskette drive, 512 MB sshared single channel DDR, 333 MHZ SDRAM, 4 Dimm slots and a 120 GB hard drive. </s>
<s> Does this sound like a fairly decent unit for 2,000.00? </s>
<s> It also has a 3 year in house warranty. </s>
<s> It also comes with a 19&quot; ultra sharp flat panel monitor. </s>
<s> Thanks, Sky </s>

<s> The DVD recorder is not of current technology. </s>
<s> The non-multi-format DVD+R/W or DVD-R/W drives are going for abotu 69 bucks RETAIL. </s>
<s> The package you have may be trying to soak you for a recorder that is going to annoy you as you may want to record on either PLUS or MINUS (DASH?) </s>
<s> media. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> 2,000? </s>
<s> Is that CND (Canadian?) </s>
<s> For 2,000 you should be able to do better. </s>
<s> Keep the money in your wallet and keep shopping. </s>
<s> Don't accept a DVD recorder of a single format and especially without DVD authoring software. </s>
<s> Additionally, Windows Movie Maker does NOT qualify as good DVD software. </s>

<s> I don't know exactly what it is you are looking for in a home computer, but this looks like it should work for what you seem to be looking for, but you have buy a seperate monitor and speakers, but it will still end up cheaper than 2,000 here is what I think might work for you http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=32803&Sku=C122-2400&CatId=114 there are other desktops on that website too. </s>
<s> good luck </s>
