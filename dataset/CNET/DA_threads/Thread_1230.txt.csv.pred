1.1.1	OK , I 've seen and read other posts that are almost identical to my issue but none that are exactly like mine .	St
1.1.2	I 've been through Microsoft and Dell with no solution , I 'm hopeful that I can find a solution or at least a good answer here .	St
1.1.3	I have a Dell XPS 600 and I 'm running Windows XP Pro 32bit .	St
1.1.4	My computer came from the factory with 2GB of dual cahnnel RAM DDR2-SDRAM PC2-5300 ( 333 MHz ) I recently purchased two more GB of RAM from Dell making sure to ues the exact same type .	St
1.1.5	My computer has 4 Dimm slots and the motherboard can use up to 8GB of ram with a 64bit OS .	St
1.1.6	My problem is that the new ram shows up in the Bios but not in system properties .	St
1.1.7	It also shows in system information but system information is also telling me that I only have 2 GB available .	St
1.1.8	I have run PC wizard to see what it has to tell me .	St
1.1.9	PC wizard tells me that I have 1GB of RAM in each DIMM slot , but under the configuration tab when you click on the Windows logo it tells me that I have only 2GB of RAM , I 'm a bit confused , I have the same software telling me two different things .	St
1.1.10	I assume at this point that my OS is seeing 4GB of RAM but is only using 2 .	St
1.1.11	If there is anyone that can help me I ca n't even tell you how much I would appreciate it .	St
1.2.1	Even those informational ones .	St
1.2.2	Please do more research since it 's not busted .	St
1.2.3	Do try the /3GB switch .	Sug
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	how much ram does it say you have ?	Ques
1.4.1	Hey Bob , thanks for the reply .	Polite
1.4.2	I do realize that most apps in Windows can only access 2GB max , my problem is that I 'm getting info that tells me that I have 4GB installed but only 2GB are available .	St
1.4.3	For example in my system properties it says 2GB .	St
1.4.4	I have tried the 3GB switch but it changed nothing .	St
1.4.5	Thanks Again .	St
1.5.1	Hi there , system properties says that I have 2GB of RAM while system info says that I have 4GB .	St
1.5.2	Do you know of a way to check and see if more than 2GB can ever be used ?	Ques
1.5.3	I know people who have added RAM in their system and it allways shows in system properties for some reason in my situation it does not .	St
1.5.4	As I mentioned system info shows that I have 4GB as does the Bios .	St
1.6.1	If you read the articles the applications are limited to 2.0GB unless they are compiled with a special setting .	St
1.6.2	Nothing busted here .	St
1.7.1	from dell 's support website : http : //support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/xps600/en/SM/specs0.htm # wp1052939 Maximum memory : 2 GB or 8 GB NOTE : See & quot ; Addressing Memory Configurations & quot ; to verify the amount of memory available to the operating system .	St
1.7.2	http : //support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/xps600/en/SM/parts0.htm # wp1052391 If using a 32-bit operating system such as Microsoft Windows XP , your computer will support a maximum of 2 GB of memory .	St
1.7.3	If you are using a 64-bit operating system , your computer will support a maximum of 8 GB ( 2-GB DIMMs in each of the four slots ) of memory .	St
1.7.4	Sorry , but you max out at 2GB .	St
1.8.1	Thank you for the time and info Rob , honestly thanks to this forum I now know whats going with my computer .	St
1.8.2	Now to see if I can send the memory back .	St
1.8.3	Thanks Again .	St
1.9.1	Thats what I get for trusting the manufacturers of both the computer and the operating system that runs it to tell me what I need to know about their product .	St
1.9.2	Thank you for your time and your ability to state the obvious .	St
1.9.3	I use computers every day and I 'm almost always able to fix my own issues but this time I got the idea in my head that I could run 4GB of RAM on my computer , of course this idea was given to me by a salesman selling RAM of course .	St
1.9.4	Anyway , thank you for your help and now I 'll sit back and wait to see if the Apps I use will ever be compatible with an 64bit OS .	St
1.10.1	I am getting ready to build a new system and am thinking of using Vista-does it go past 2 gb ?	Ques
1.11.1	There are 64-bit versions of Windows but it 's a wasteland of hard to find drivers and support .	St
1.11.2	Bob	St
1.12.1	Thanks for the info .	St
1.12.2	I have been told the more ram installed the better & faster games would run.Why do they have four dimm slots in the new motherboards and tell you the capacity if it is n't going to be used ?	Ques
1.13.1	While the mfg could guess which OS you 're going to use , they do n't know for sure what OS and what version of the OS you will be installing .	St
1.13.2	And with 4 DIMM slots , folks can start with 2 @ 256MBs , 2 @ 512MBs , 2 @ 1GB or 4 @ 512MBs ... depending on budget .	St
1.13.3	VAPCMD PS ... DDR2 Ram has n't always been this cheap .	St
1.14.1	That was back when the average machine had much less .	St
1.14.2	Today and for now , 2GB is plenty with no benchmarks showing more is better .	St
1.14.3	Bob	St
1.15.1	There are boot commands to get around this and a MS fix for the memory adress problem .	St
1.15.2	But this will slow it down as it takes a different route to say , and isnt exactly worth it unless absolutely needed .	St
1.15.3	If so you should be running 64bit anyways .	St
1.15.4	Windows will usually recognize around 3/3.5ish , it reserves system memory and gpu ram that will affect the memory count .	St
1.16.1	How will you fix an app that was n't compiled with that special switch ?	Ques
1.16.2	Again , the benefits of over 2GB are rare today .	St
1.16.3	But I do see many that love to brag they maxed it out .	St
1.16.4	Bob	St
1.17.1	I have what I believe is a 32 bit operating system which i was told will only hold 2 , 1 gb ram sticks in its two open slots .	St
1.17.2	I already have one in there and the other 1gb is new .	St
1.17.3	I believe they both are DDR ( atleast the new one is ) and i have an intel processor .	St
1.17.4	My properties show 960 mb but my bios reads 2000 mb ?	Ques
1.17.5	please help !	Sug
1.18.1	What you noted can happen as some is used for video and or other things .	St
1.18.2	You are posting to a 2008 post so this old post is closed .	St
1.18.3	Make a new post with all the machine details .	St
1.18.4	Bob	St
