When I turn on the drive: -the drive light comes on -the computer makes the Windows XP 'dum-dum' sound -no drive letter is assigned -the drive is not visible under 'My Computer' -the drive is not visible under Device Manager -the drive is not visible under Disk Management -more ominously, the drive is ticking like a clock when I put my ear up to it I have tried with a different computer, and the result is the same. I have tried with a different USB cable, and the result is the same. My system is Windows XP SP3, fully up to date. I'm not sure what to do. Are there any utilities that might allow me to see the drive, even when it is (apparently) not assigned a drive letter? Is it really and truly dead? How might I salvage the data? Any suggestions would be most welcome. Thanks.
