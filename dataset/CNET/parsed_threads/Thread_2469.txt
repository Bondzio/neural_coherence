<s> I have DVD RW's on my two XP Professional systems and until recently I had no problem burning DVDs. </s>
<s> About a month ago both stopped writing DVDs but they will write CDs. </s>
<s> Both drives can not see a blank DVD RW, but they have no problem reading a burned or manufactured DVD. </s>
<s> I have used several different manufacturers DVDs in the past with no problem-but the plus DVDs did work better than the minus. </s>
<s> Now DVDs from the same cone just don't work. </s>
<s> One drive is a 4X 4 gig model (it lives on a P4 2.6Ghz with 1gig of ram) and the other one is an 8X duel density drive (its home is a P4 3.2Ghz with2 gig of ram). </s>
<s> I am using Nero 6 to burn my DVDs and until recently had no problems. </s>
<s> Any ideas or suggestions? </s>
<s> You didn't note the age of the drives. </s>
<s> While I've had some luck with updating the drive firmware it's no longer a viable shop repair option since a new drive is under 40 bucks and tech time would exceed that and to make matters worse the charge would be on the bill even if it didn't work out. </s>
<s> This is why you swap out the 1 or more year old drive and see if it's fixed rather than pump up the repair bill with time charges trying to save the drive. </s>
