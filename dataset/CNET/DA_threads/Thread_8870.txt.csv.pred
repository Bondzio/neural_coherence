1.2.1	Personally I dont care for gateways that much .	St
1.2.2	My friend had a couple and I wasnt impressed with the machine given the price .	St
1.2.3	I recently purchased an HP and have had problems with it as well .	St
1.2.4	My so called warranty isnt worth anything since my DVD+- died on me and the experts at their India & quot ; service center & quot ; run me around in circles for hours until I finally have given up .	St
1.2.5	Heard the same thing about other major brands .	St
1.2.6	Basically for the money I would go with a Dell/IBM ( if they still have em ) low cost server and purchase the extras seperately or get a year old workstation with dual processor capability and jack it up .	St
1.2.7	Since most of the service/call centers have moved overseas I wouldnt put much hope in getting something fixed if it breaks & quot ; under warranty & quot ; .	St
1.2.8	Definitely would not purchase an HP but I am sure others have had better experiences .	St

1.3.7	The one thing I do not like about almost all big computer builders , Gateway , Dell , HP/Compact etc , etc , etc .	St
1.3.8	Is that they come loaded with Salesware .	St
1.3.9	It seems like almost every program is trying to get you to upgrade and buy the & quot ; full version & quot ; .	St
1.3.10	This can create a situation where your machine is locking up due to all the programs trying to connect to their homepages .	St
1.3.11	Have someone help you clean up the machine before you end up with problems .	St
1.3.12	Happy Computing A custom rig will not have all this junk to start with .	St
1.3.13	BUY AntiVirus and learn how to use it .	St

1.4.1	I have only seen a few gateways and they were all older pentium 3 's .	St
1.4.2	I have been very happy with my HP pc since 01 , and just bought a new one , i think theyre the best , customer support was great , the one time i used it too .	St
1.4.3	Hope this helps .	St
1.4.4	By the way , the old one still works fine too .	St
1.5.1	I forgot to mention , that new HP pc only cost 500 bucks with tax at walmart , it has a celeron D processor at 2.93 gigs and ddr ram so its fast .	St
1.5.2	the thing to do , since it has windows xp installed is : disable the windows firewall and the norton anti virus and get Zone Alarm firewall and the AVG anti virus , theyre bothe free and have served me well since 2001 .	St
1.5.3	The windows xp has sp2 thats why i would do those things , theres been no problem since x-mas , hope i helped ya , later .	St

1.6.4	The Gateway came out of the box pretty clean .	St
1.6.5	Only had to deleat a couple of programs .	St
1.6.6	Do n't get me wrong all the computers have served me well .	St
1.6.7	I do n't think the brand makes any difference any longer .	St
1.6.8	All the parts on the inside are the same and the company is only putting them all together .	St
