Epox 8rga+ Nforce2 Mobo Amd Athlon XP 2500+ FSB 333mhz Barton 512 DDR pc3200 Ram 2 60gb Maxtor Harddrives BFG Nvidia Fx5900xtOC DVD rom and Cd burner WINTV video capture card Recently my computer Shutdown and wouldnt turn back on.. turns out the processor fan wasnt running and i think that is what caused it. Anyway i think im going to upgrade mobo and proc. I use the computer for all sorts of things like browsing the internet/online poker/word processing/computer games (counterstrike)/photoshop/Record some Tv programs.. ect I had no problems doing what i needed to do with my old setup. I like the Nforce motherboards. I havnt had any computer problems until recently so i havnt stayed up to date on what is all out there now. I know theres the AMD 64 or whatever but i havnt looked into it at all. I want to stick with AMD and Nforce mobo. If you have a suggestion on how i should go about upgrading any suggestions are welcomed. Thanks for you help.

A nice sound card isnt really something i want to throw down 100 bucks for either considering i havnt had one before and have been just fine. I have a nice dual fan 400w power supply so i wont need one of those.
