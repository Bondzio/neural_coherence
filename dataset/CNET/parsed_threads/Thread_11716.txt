<s> Hello, I want to add memory to my P3 computer and my board support Sdram memory. </s>
<s> I tried to put 2X 512MB pc133 Sdram memory, but my BIOS recognize only 256MB total. </s>
<s> I updated to the BIOS to those details(B1120IAG.BIN </s>
<s> Goto http://www.crucial.com and check there for definite answers for ram. </s>
<s> Enter your data and verify against what you have. </s>
<s> I suggest you verify you have similar is not paired ram or maker, hi or low density type, and the timing /speed of each. </s>
<s> You may have to play with it and also to delve into the bios to increase voltage level as a final tweek if needed. </s>
<s> Oldeer systems tend to be picky on how the ram was installed. </s>

<s> Look at http://homepage.hispeed.ch/rscheidegger/ram_bx_faq.html#Q:_Ive_just_bought_some_256MB_high and as you dive into this issue you discover it's just a limit of the old BX chipset. </s>
<s> The best sticks for those old machines were 128MB sticks and fill all the slots. </s>

<s> Thank you all for a fast answer, I'm looking for the solution. </s>
<s> Sorry, was I unclear here? </s>
<s> Let me try blunt. </s>
<s> The memory sticks are incompatible but will register as 128MB sticks and may function as such fine. </s>
<s> Trying blunt again. </s>
<s> The chip and board design doesn't support this memory size. </s>
<s> Is that clearer? </s>
