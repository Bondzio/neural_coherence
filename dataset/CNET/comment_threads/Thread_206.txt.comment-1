hi about 6 months ago i purchased a refurbished hp media center m7160n.
Just rencently i purchased a new ati radeon x1600 512 meg PCI-E Graphics card.
After i physically installed and booted up i noticed that there was no display on my monitor.
So i checked in troubleshooting and they said to upgrade my BIOS.
Which is where i am stuck, i cant seem to be able to indentify my motherboard so i can upgrade my BIOS.
I cant seem to find the model # on the motherboard or in BIOS.
I looked up my computer # on the internet and it says that a new one has a Intel 945G Express mainboard.
Would that be the same for a refurbished one?
This issue is making me very frusterated, moderator please HELP.
