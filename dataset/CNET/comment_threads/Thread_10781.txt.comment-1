I have cable internet (cable modem) with a wireless home network setup.
I have a desktop computer connected (wired) and a laptop which I use wirelessly via my home router.
Pardon what may seem like a &quot;dumb&quot; question but my wireless connection with the laptop...would that be considered a WLAN (Wireless LAN Connection) or is it still a LAN connection?
