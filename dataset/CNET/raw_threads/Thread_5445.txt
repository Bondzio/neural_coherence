If I run both sticks of ram in it, it crashes randomly after about 10 min in windows or before boot. I have troubleshooted using either stick of ram alone and they will run 100% stable for days using only 1 chip in any memory slot. This sounds like a mb issue to me what do you guys think? Please let me have some tips, Thanks Brian

The owner didn't take the free advice to put two more drops of heatsink compound on the CPU. They gave up and I did it for the 50 buck minimum charge. They were not happy. I'm unsure why some don't try the easy stuff first. There is also an issue with memory, bios, timings and more but I will not write more than that here. It's far too deep and in short a warranty+support problem. Bob

I know mine isnt a heat issue because I have played games on it for weeks and 0 crashes with either memory chip. About the bios and mem timings I have mine all on default right now which is 5 5 5 15 1.9v.

And found it ran with one stick so it couldn't be &quot;that.&quot; Shop counters thrive on such issues. Let's not let them have the easy ones. Or at least be sure about that. Again, the details in your post are not there for me to look into the other area of BIOS, memory timings and more. But you can research that on your own. Bob
