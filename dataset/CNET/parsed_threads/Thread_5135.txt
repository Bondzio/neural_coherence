<s> My question is would it really be worth it to add a GB of ram to my laptop. </s>
<s> right now my Acer TravelMate 8104WLMi has 1 GB of ram and i'm considering upgrading towards two. </s>
<s> I'm no expert or anything on Ram so im not sure that if i just went to a store and bought some that it would be compatible with my machine. </s>
<s> under the description on my computer it says it has 1GB DDR2 533 (support Dual Channel). </s>
<s> whatever that all means. </s>
<s> i went to kingston.com and http://www.crucial.com/systemscanner/ when i do a scan it offers me a kit thats described like this 2GB kit (1GBx2) CT540887 DDR2 PC2-5300 CL=5 Unbuffered NON-ECC DDR2-667 1.8V 128Meg x 64 For a little over $100. </s>
<s> i was wondering if this would be worth the time and money. </s>
<s> any help would be great </s>

<s> The second part of VAPCMD's question was just as important as the first. </s>
<s> If you only use your laptop for web browsing, e-mail, word processing, etc. </s>
<s> then you are probably just fine with 1 GB of ram in XP. </s>
<s> However, if you do use your laptop for other memory intensive tasks maybe video editing, gaming, etc. </s>
<s> then you may want 2 GB of ram. </s>
<s> So, it's really up to you. </s>
<s> 2 gigs is definitely better than one, but you need to evaluate what you use the computer for and if you really need the extra GB of ram. </s>
<s> If you decide to go for it then most major memory retailers have an online evaluator that will tell you what type of memory you need and give you prices on a few selected options. </s>
<s> The best part is that they generally guarantee that the RAM will work in your computer. </s>
<s> Try crucial.com or kingston.com Also, I didn't notice whether you mentioned it in your post, but you also want to consider what your current 1 GB consists of. </s>
<s> For instance, my laptop has 1 gb of memory that is comprised of 2 512MB sticks of memory. </s>
<s> Since my laptop only has two slots for memory I would have to buy 2 1GB sticks of memory to upgrade rather than just buying an additional 1GB. </s>
<s> The online scanner at crucial or kingston should tell you what you currently have installed and how many slots are available to receive memory. </s>
<s> Maybe you already knew some of that. </s>
<s> Hope I didn't get too elementary for you. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
