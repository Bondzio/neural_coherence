<s> It's a common acronym. </s>
<s> Try google when you find a new term As to the antenna, you can try it but at that distance it's far over what wifi gear off the consumer lines offer. </s>
<s> Must it work? </s>

<s> External antenna, then range extender at the wireless location furthest from the signal. </s>
<s> Gets a little pricey but if no major impediments good chance. </s>
