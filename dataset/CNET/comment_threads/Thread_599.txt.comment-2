the only things you might want to consider... is 1GB RAM enough for your PC needs with Vista right around the corner ?
And how do you plan to back up the system to minimize your downtime if the hard drive dies or hiccups ?
Re the RAM and the right amount to have in your PC....checkout places like tomshardware.com, anandtech.com, xbitlabs.com, etc.
They've got some good info on the issue how much RAM do i need ?
It's usually easier to go for the amount of RAM upfront than have to upgrade by adding later.
Re Backup....check though some of the posts in storage forum as there are some discussions on partitioning, backup strategies, backup software, etc.. Again it really depends how critical your access is on a day to day basis.
Let us know how it works out.
