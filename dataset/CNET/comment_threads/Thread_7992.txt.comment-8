I used to work IT and my boss told me a trick about PCs that kinda stuck that so long as you had a good monitor, everybody was happy.
So our kind of in-house unsaid policy was a fix on monitors.
And when you think about it, its the part of the computer that gets the most attention.
So even if you're a little slower, its still an overall benefit.
My personal preference is that the monitor gets top priority.
