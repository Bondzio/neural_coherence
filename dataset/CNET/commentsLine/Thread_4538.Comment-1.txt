i recently purchased a tv that didnt specify that only pc input was 1024x768 resolution.
the component cable connecters on back are 1080p and i want to connect to that port so my pc can display 1080p.
so i was wondering what do i have to get to make that possible?
specs: evga 7900 gt ko video card akai lct37z6ta telivison
