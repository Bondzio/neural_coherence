Replacement of the cyan and black tanks cost $31.11 for just one month of light use and no intentional color printing. This would mean more than $300 for one year, more than the printer cost! You do the math for the life of the printer! Contact with Canon technical support confirms my set up was in accordance with their recommended for black and white text. They also noted the printer will NOT operate with any of the tanks out of ink! I have bought a big black paper weight! Have you had this problem? Did you find a solution?

I didn't read if you had set it to Grayscale Printing. If not you may find the printer using color ink to create what looks like black from the color tank. Bob
