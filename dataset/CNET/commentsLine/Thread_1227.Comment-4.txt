lol, my thingies.
they are, i think, called circuit breakers.
they are in your house and if you have a short in your house, you would flip the switch.
yeah, it was working fine until that day.
yes it was connected to a surge protector, but that was unplugged anyways.
i tried plugging it directly into the wall, but it didn't work either.
well, this computer is on it's critches.
i would buy a new psu, but even if this thing turns on, it still has a lot of problems, lol.
so, in the end, i would have to replace something?
i am actually going to get a new pc, and am wondering if i can salvage anything from this one.
i just wanted to know whether this one is gone for good, or has some parts.
when i get the new pc, i'll use a few parts.
thanks, both of you!
