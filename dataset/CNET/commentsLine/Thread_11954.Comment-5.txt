i cannot ping the copier after i attach an ethernet cable to it a d give it a known valid ip on the network.
if i cannot ping it, then i cannot set it up as a network printer which is why i am writing this.
btw, i plug in a laptop and it picks up an ip with no problem via the same cable used by the non-connecting copier.
