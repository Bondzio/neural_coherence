Because usually in the benchmarks you see now, the Intel test systems are not optimized, while AMD is, because the AMD one usaully has Dual channel DDR400.
In order for a system to be optimized, the CPU's FSB must match half the DDR frequency.
AMD with 400MHz FSB + dual channel DDR400 = optimized Intel with 800MHz FSB + dual channel DDR800 = optimized http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/printpage/133
