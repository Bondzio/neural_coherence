That's my thinking.
I think the print head went bad.
Since I posted my query, I was able to locate and remove the print head.
I am not sure if I have it in properly, but I doubt the problem was the print head becoming &quot;unshipped&quot;.
There is no change in the printer's error message.
It's amazing how regardless of use or cost, they never seem to last more than three years.
Thanks
