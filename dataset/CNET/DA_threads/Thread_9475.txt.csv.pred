1.1.1	So my family is getting a new computer for christmas , and I can do anything I want with the old computer .	St
1.1.2	So I 've decided to turn it into a Media Center/ Torrent TIVO .	St
1.1.3	Mainly for just watching videos , listening to some music once and while , etc .	St
1.1.4	The computer is an HP Pavilion a320n .	St
1.1.5	Its has 2.98 GHZ AMD Athalon Processor , 512 megs of RAM , and 120 Gig hardrive , Windows XP home edition .	St
1.1.6	I have 512 Megs of RAM , so I 'm going to upgrade it to 1G , should that be enough ?	Ques
1.1.7	I do n't plan on using it record live tv or anything that intense .	St
1.1.8	I also need to upgrade to video card so I have tv out put .	St
1.1.9	Which card would be a good deal ?	Ques
1.1.10	I do n't want to spend alot , between 30 and 50 bucks is kind of my range .	St
1.1.11	SHould I opt for a card with a tv tuner instead ?	Ques
1.1.12	The hardrive is 120 gigs .	St
1.1.13	I do n't plan on stooring my movie collection on it really .	St
1.1.14	More like torrenting my favorite shows I miss and then wathcing , and once wathced delete them .	St
1.1.15	So should 120 gig hardrive be big enough ?	Ques
1.1.16	As for media center software , I 've been looking at Media Poral .	St
1.1.17	I do n't want to spend the money to get MS Media Center .	St
1.1.18	Are any other free suggestion for media center type software ?	Ques
1.1.19	Thats about it , have I covered all my bases for a basic media center/ torrent tivo device .	St
1.1.20	I 'm going to upgrade my ram , and get a video card with tv output .	St
1.1.21	Do n't think I need a bigger hardrive .	St
1.1.22	Anything else you all would upgrade .	St
1.2.1	http : //www.google.com/search ? hl=en & q=Torrent+TIVO & btnG=Google+Search finds nothing that I could discuss in this forum .	St
1.2.2	Almost all video content via Torrents is pirated so the forum policies forbid that disussion .	St
1.2.3	If we ignore that why ca n't you use the usual MCE and XBOX 360 combo ?	Ques
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I do n't have an xbox 360 , so that really is n't an option .	St
1.3.2	Thats why I 'm using my old pc .	St
1.3.3	Also , I 've seen most that stuff of bittorent and rss , but thanks anyways .	Polite
1.3.4	And I did n't discuss my use of bittorent really , so I 'm hoping my thread is n't veering into bad territory or even grey territory .	St
1.3.5	If so I will tweek it some .	St
1.4.1	As to a do-it-yourself item some have loads of fun trying to get such to work proper .	St
1.4.2	Maybe you can look on google.com about & quot ; Build your own Media PC & quot ; or such but the MCE+360 combo is nice .	St
1.4.3	Apple will have their iTV out soon so you should look there if you want to & quot ; see how it should be done. & quot ; Bob	St
