My desire is to use 4 ViewSonic VX2025WM's (which received high marks in its review here) running in their native resolution (1680 x 1050) turned 90 degrees (portrait orientation). I'm considering using 2 XFX GeForce 8800 GTS (320MB) cards to drive them. I have a dual PCI express slot motherboard with a Core Duo processor and I'm running XP SP2. I believe my most demanding application will be video editing. I use the Xbox 360 for games. I have a few questions that I can't seem to get a straight answer to: 1. Is changing the output orientation from landscape to portrait a video card software issue or an XP issue, i.e. does XP SP2 support this directly? 2. Does this XFX card support running in a dual card configuration? 3. Should I upgrade to the 640 MB card?

Just recently we discussed and I disclosed no payoff in highend GPU cards at this link -&gt; http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7582_102-0.html?forumID=28&threadID=236651&messageID=2420463#2420463 So at the office we use simple dual output cards (ATI or Nvidia) and see no speed loss during edit or rendering. We also save bucks on power consumption. Just my answers to your questions. 1. Is changing the output orientation from landscape to portrait a video card software issue or an XP issue, i.e. does XP SP2 support this directly? It's done with the drivers that come with said software. Microsoft is not keen on driver development. 2. Does this XFX card support running in a dual card configuration? From what I've read, yes. 3. Should I upgrade to the 640 MB card? For video editing? I'll write no. Gamers would. Bob

I actually got someone knowledgable at XFX that agreed that I could basically get two 7900 GS cards for the price of one of the 8800 GTS cards and accomplish my objective. And there's another benefit... apparently the 8800's are real power hogs, requiring one 500 watt power supply EACH! The other issue I guess is the distinction between Extended Desktop and Desktop Spanning. I was looking for Desktop Spanning, which is not possible with rotated displays I've been told. Extended Desktop is able to rotate and use all 4, apparently, &quot;with a little tweaking&quot; but not as one continuous desktop.

5544	5	237057	2422656	2422555	ramarc	3/6/07 2:50 PM	1.1731926E12	re: confirm	rotation is on a different tab than the monitor selection window, but regardless of which monitor i selected, only the primary monitor rotated. again this could be due to my setup (1 widescreen with DVI, 1 4:3 with VGA). still, enough folks have dual displays that you should be able to find someone who can confirm it for you.
5544	6	237057	2422718	2422656	richchrono	3/6/07 3:46 PM	1.17319596E12	Found the tweak!	Speaking with XFX, they said do not use the nvrotate utility. That only rotates the primary monitor. Instead, using the classic nvidia control panel (not the new one), go into nview, click display settings, highlight the monitor you want to rotate, right click, then rotate. They tested that in house and said it worked.
