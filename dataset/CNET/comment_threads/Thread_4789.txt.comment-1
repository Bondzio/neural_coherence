My dad has a large library of DVD's, and the dvd players in my house are really beginning to suck.
So I thought for this XMAS I would buy him an Apple TV.
What I'd like to do is buy a large HD (like a TB or something), and then rip his dvd movies to the drive so it can be connected to a computer and accessed by AppleTV whenever he wants to watch something.
Does anyone know what I could do to get this done quickly, because I don't have the time to sit on my MBP and rip 300+ movies to my hard drive and then drag them to an external HD...
I was hoping there was some hardware that could convert DVDs to digital format within minutes I could use.
Thanks, Alegoo92
