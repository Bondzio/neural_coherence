I bought an XFX geforce 6600GT video card for my dell demension 8200 pc.
The instruction manual that came with the card is pretty vague and I don't know much about the inside of computers.
Is there any place where i can find a step by step guide on how to install this hardware, preferably with some pictures.
Thank you, Nick
