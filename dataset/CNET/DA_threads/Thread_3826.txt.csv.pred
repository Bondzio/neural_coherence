1.1.1	my system ( purchased fall 2001 ) Gateway SELECT 1400CS 1.40GHz AMD Athlon 133MHz external bus 768 MB of RAM ( will upgrade to 1024 ; specs say supports 1GB , but BIOS utility says 1536MB ) 20 GB of Harddrive space ( want to add 2nd 160GB Seagate Internal Hard Drive .	St
1.1.2	circuit city , $ 49.99 [ ST3160023A-R ] ) 64MB NVIDIA GeForce2 MX400 AGP Video Card w/ DVI and TV Out Screen Area/Colors : 1280x1024 pixels , 16 million colors Monitor : SyncMaster 730B ( Analog ) Windows XP Service Pack 2 little confused on this ... Weekend Project - Get gigs to spare with a new hard drive , Step 3 : Assess your PC .	St
1.1.3	i want to add a 2nd internal HD ( 160GB ) , but the weekend project said & quot ; ... If your motherboard 's BIOS is more than a few years old , it might not recognize the full capacity of a huge modern drive ... & quot ; it said to google the BIOS version for specs and/or updates to see if it could handle the amount of HD space i wanted .	St
1.1.4	could n't find the specs though .	St
1.1.5	so in order to avoid problems i tried to update my BIOS anyway .	St
1.1.6	1st thru American Megatrends , Inc. website which after all the BS directed me to esupport.com which seems like a scam to pay for the update .	St
1.1.7	then i went to gateway and found the update for my BIOS version ( AMD Athlon BIOS update 0AAWV P09 ) now ... went thru the steps and put BIOS update file on a floppy and restarted the PC to update the BIOS just to get a non bootable disk , strike any key error .	St
1.1.8	possible problems ... had trouble with floppy drive ( Panasonic 1.44-MB Floppy Disk Drive Revision 5 ) before where with any disk ( new , old , formatted , unformatted , etc ) inserted a message would pop up saying disk needed to be formatted ... format now ?	Ques
1.1.9	and would sometimes make loud noise when reading a disk .	St
1.1.10	but i disabled , uninstalled , reinstalled , and enabled thru device manager and now it reads floppy disks .	St
1.1.11	questions i have : is it possible my BIOS has already been updated thru a windows xp patch/hotfix/update ?	Ques
1.1.12	or can it only be done with a boot floppy disk procedure ?	Ques
1.1.13	where would i find the specs of want my BIOS can handle ?	Ques
1.1.14	can i add RAM based on the 1024 MB max specs of my AMD ( Keystone ) Motherboard - 1.4-GHz ?	Ques
1.1.15	or can i go by the BIOS max of 1536MB ?	Ques
1.1.16	i get contradicting info on banks and slots ( 3 banks of 1 slot or 2 banks of 1 slot ) but i will open up the PC today and look .	Sug
1.1.17	do i need to do the BIOS update for my BIOS version to recognize my soon to be new hard drive total capacity ?	Ques
1.1.18	what if i want to keep my old drive as my master drive with the xp OS ( so i dont have to install xp on the new drive ) and use the new hard drive just for backup/storage ?	Ques
1.1.19	i dont need to install xp on the new drive if i 'm just using it as storage , right ?	Ques
1.1.20	apologies for all the info and questions .	St
1.1.21	just wanted get all that was on my brain .	St
1.1.22	thanx in advance	St
1.2.1	First the machine is new enough I would n't check the old disk size limit issue .	St
1.2.2	But the 20GB is getting to the age I 'd begin to not want it to be my primary boot drive .	St
1.2.3	Your new 160GB drive will come with drive copy software so you can move onto that new drive .	St
1.2.4	Not only that but they 'll have instructions to do that .	St
1.2.5	This is safe too since we do n't touch the 20GB but set it aside when we boot from the copy on the new 160GB drive .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	so i should be able to make an image of the old drive onto the new drive with given software ?	Ques
1.3.2	then i can clear the old 20GB drive and use that for storage ?	Ques
1.3.3	about the RAM max , should i go by gateway specs or the BIOS ?	Ques
1.4.1	Did you ask me to repeat my first answer ?	Ques
1.4.2	As to the RAM , you can check crucial.com as well .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	I am having somewhat of the same problem , only am using 512 of Ram but wanted to upgrade my 40GB hard drive ( as it is failing ) with a new 250GB hard drive .	St
1.5.2	I have basically the same computer , Gateway Select 1400CS with the 1.4 GHz AMD .	St
1.5.3	My computer will only show 127 GB of the new 250GB hard drive .	St
1.5.4	Wanted to update my BIOS but the only updated I could find was the one on Gateway , I ca n't find the current BIOS driver I am using or the motherboard exact model .	St
1.5.5	Which limits me on finding a BIOS driver update .	St
1.5.6	My floppy has never gone bad and am using new pre-formatted IBM floppy disk , at start-up comp will not read BIOS update from the booted floppy .	St
1.5.7	Returns with the same thing you stated ... & quot ; Non-system disk or disk error Replace and strike any key & quot ; You ever have any luck booting the new BIOS version or finding a better download to update BIOS .	St
1.5.8	Let me know , thanks .	Polite
1.6.1	The disk size problem noted at http : //www.48bitlba.com went away .	St
1.6.2	If this was mine I 'd update my BIOS if I found any item they noted worthy .	St
1.6.3	'My floppy has never gone bad and am using new pre-formatted IBM floppy disk , at start-up comp will not read BIOS update from the booted floppy .	St
1.6.4	Returns with the same thing you stated ... & quot ; Non-system disk or disk error Replace and strike any key & quot ; ' I find that many have forgotten how to make a dos boot diskette .	St
1.6.5	Tell me how you made this diskette so I can check your work .	St
1.6.6	Bob	St
1.7.1	followed instructions that came as readme file to BIOS driver , which stated to unzip a driver file to the hard drive then copy all files in stated folder to a new floppy disk .	St
1.7.2	That 's all I did , then booted of the disk .	St
1.7.3	Thanks for the 48bit website will have to read more of it .	St
1.8.1	& quot ; which stated to unzip a driver file to the hard drive then copy all files in stated folder to a new floppy disk. & quot ; The new floppy disk would be a DOS boot diskette .	St
1.8.2	No one bothers to tell you today about such since it 's been 2 decades that this has been the way of things .	St
1.8.3	I think you found the problem .	St
1.8.4	You followed the directions ... Bob	St
1.9.1	Well thank you Bob for that info , you know I really appreciate the reply .	Polite
1.9.2	I surely was n't looking for help , what I really wanted was a snide remark .	St
1.9.3	Oh sure , I will now look up on the internet how to make a DOS boot disk and figure out how to flash my BIOS .	St
1.9.4	So you certainly solved the problem .	St
1.9.5	But maybe next time when you ask to & quot ; check & quot ; someone 's work you will come back with a more informative response .	Sug
1.9.6	Such as , please look at this website , or simply state how you would make the disk .	Sug
1.9.7	But I sure do appreciate being treated like an idiot .	St
1.10.1	You did just fine .	Polite
1.10.2	My snide comment is that today you will find many of these instructions to assume that you would know that & quot ; you also need to do this. & quot ; If that is n't good enough for you consider this .	St
1.10.3	I will never rewrite a post if it gets the job done .	St
1.10.4	That is , this is all volunteer and if it will take me more than 30 seconds to rewrite it to avoid bruising someone 's psyche I wo n't .	St
1.10.5	Let 's get it done .	St
1.10.6	Ok ?	Ques
1.10.7	Bob	St
