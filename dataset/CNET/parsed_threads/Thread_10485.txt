<s> often go out. </s>
<s> It's easy to insert an inexpensive pci card to correct the problem. </s>
<s> I did and it still says the same thing,enabled but not started. </s>
<s> Run msconfig.exe and try booting in safe mode and then normal mode and see if it helps. </s>
<s> If not, go into hardware settings in control panels system icon and look for devices related to sound which may be disabled or in conflict. </s>
<s> You should also run Windows Update and contact Microsoft for a $35 incident if necessary. </s>
<s> I cannot update windows xp,and I don't know why </s>
