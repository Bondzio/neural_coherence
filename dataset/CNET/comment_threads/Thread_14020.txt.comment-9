&quot;Many motherboards lose the dual channel benefit if more than two matching slots are filled, so your question may be moot.&quot; I meant that the dual channel benefit (not necessarily dual channel mode) may be lost if a slot or slots are used beyond the two matching slot minimum (one in each channel) for dual channel operation.
It has been my understanding that adding a third module to a typical four slot motherboard may eliminate dual channel mode if all modules have the same density.
Thus, the dual channel benefit is lost.
An example is if you populate the two slots of the channel A with 256MB modules (totaling 512MB), but only put a 256MB module in either slot of channel B.
In that case, channel A has a total of 512MB and channel B has a non matching total of 256MB.
Intel's explanation: http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/cs-011965.htm * * * * * Adding a fourth module to a dual channel capable motherboard may cause the memory to clock down in speed.
Dual channel mode is still realized, but the dual channel benefit is lost.
Dual channel bandwidth increase of up to 10% http://www.crucial.com/kb/answer.asp?qid=3751 - versus - Memory clock speed loss of more than 10% when slowing from 400MHz to 333MHz as a result of having all four slots populated.
While those percentages are not &quot;overall speed&quot; indicators, they do give an indication of something lost for something gained.
