I've had luck in the past with ATI products, and this card works great for the most part. The one difficulty I am having however is that my TV OUT is not working. I cannot seem to open the Catalyst Control Center and am given a message that it failed to initialize properly. I've installed both the copy of Catalyst that came with the card and the copy found online. Both show the same problem. I've called tech support to try and solve the issue... yeah right. It is true what they say about AIT's tech support. Of course, that seems to be the case with almost every tech support out there nowadays. Anyway, anyone out there that has experienced similar issues?

I see this message from time to time, usually after using Nero to capture DV camcorder input via firewire and not through the AIW card. I just have to re-install the tv capture drivers (which I had to download after installing the software from the CD) and then the TV function works fine. I've included the description and link from ATI's driver pages. WDM Capture Driver version 6.14.10.6246 V3 is required for capture support on ALL-IN-WONDER and VIVO products. https://support.ati.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=894&task=knowledge&folderID=27 Good luck.
