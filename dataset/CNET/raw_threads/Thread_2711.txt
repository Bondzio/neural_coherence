Need help deciding Dell 4700 *sale or Emachines T6520	Here are the specs: Dell dimension 4700 2.8Ghz HT P4, 512MB, 17&quot; LCD Flat Panel, 40GB drive, CD-RW $549 - 100 rebate =$449 + Tax and free shipping (will upgrade the HD, and get more ram) Emachines T6520 AMD Athlon 64 3400+, 1024MB DDR (400MHz) 200GB HDD, ATI Radeon Xpress 200, DVDRW drive and separate CD-ROM $649.99 before $50 rebate without a monitor, has XP Media Center preinstalled The Dell is being offered at a low $ for a one-day sale, so I need to make the decision b4 midnight. I really want Windows XP MCE OS, and since the Dell one doesn't have it installed, I can get the cd on newegg. By installing it into the dell system however, the warranty would be voided. Pretty much, whats selling me for the Dell is that the 17&quot; monitor is included and the low $. Neither machine has a tv tuner card, so that will be something I need to get. To get the Dell w/monitor or cheap Emachines w/more ram and hdd storage??

Since she already has a monitor, she'll sell me the dell monitor. And now I'm free to get the emachines.! Works for everyone! Thanks though for your suggestion!
