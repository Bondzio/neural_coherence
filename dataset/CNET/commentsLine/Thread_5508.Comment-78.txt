i have an external 1 tb wd my book home, on which i store much of my data.
generally it behaves well, but unaccountably and apparently randomly, it disappears from the list of disc drives.
rebooting the computer doesn't bring it back, and i have to disconnect the cable linking the drive to the computer, remove the power connection, and then re-connect and re-boot before it will reappear.
so far (fingers crossed!!)
nothing has happened to my data, but it is a concern.
can anyone suggest what might be causing this and how to fix it?
the computer to which this drive is connected uses vista operating system.
