My initial problem is that i can't connect to any wireless networks without setting it up manually via the ISP. (obvs can't do that if it's a public one). I tried solving that, but no luck, and now, I can't even see the list of wireless networks, even though my wifi switch is on. I've checked the drivers, and it's Intel&#174; PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network Connection - which all seems to be on and functioning. I've tried updating the driver via the Intel website. Having trouble with that too. Can anyone help? Is it possible to update this driver? Can i install a brand new one? Any other tips? Thanks!!!

Just last month we installed XP and sure enough it could not connect to our Wireless LAN. Turns out XP could not work with our WPA2 WLAN. There is no fix for this as it's not a driver issue. After we connected it with the Ethernet LAN and let it update to XP SP3 and got a new driver from the laptop's maker (it was dated 2005) then the XP SP3 laptop could connect to our WLAN. 2. Can't see networks. Now there is a common issue that if some took the outdated advice from say -&gt; http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/hide-wifi-network-prevent-detected/ &lt;- then you would have to enter the information manual (which you did) and then it works. So here we are with a long list of issues and since you can make it work with the manual entry I have to write that all is as expected. Bob

However, I solved it by doing a system restore to when it was working. And now it's all good. I still had the issue of the browser not connecting, but after changing some firewall settings it's all good now.
