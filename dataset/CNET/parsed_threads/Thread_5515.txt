<s> I've been working with gaining space on my hard drive, I had 3 partitions: Primary (220 GB) Backup (around 8 GB) Empty (1 GB or something) Now, I've deleted the empty one and shrunk the backup one (It was Vista and I have 7 now), but I can't extend the primary partition in to the unallocated space. </s>
<s> the problem might be that the backup partition is &quot;in between&quot; the primary and unallocated areas. </s>
<s> Is there a way I can fix this? </s>
<s> By the way, I already know about the diskmgmt thing, that's what I've been using. </s>
<s> Feel free to ask for clarification. </s>
<s> Thank's for your support, Deven P.S. </s>
<s> Can I upload pictures to this, or is that not allowed? </s>
<s> generally speaking you can't change a partition if it's the one you're booting from. </s>
<s> If I needed to do it right now....I'd use Acronis DIsk Director. </s>
<s> You usually get the SW, load the program and create a bootable CD that allows you to modify the primary bootable partition and the other partitions, if any. </s>
<s> Question is....why do you want to do this ? </s>
<s> Before going further....have you backed up your data ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> 1GB is nothing. </s>
<s> Why not just extend the backup? </s>
<s> I've shrunk the backup drive since it wasn't in use. </s>
<s> Now it's more than just a measly little gigabyte and a half. </s>
<s> Thank's for the concern, though. </s>
<s> Thank's for your input. </s>
<s> And to answer your questions: &quot;Question is....why do you want to do this ?&quot; For two reasons. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> I've made more space than a gigabyte free since I've shrunk the backup partition because wasn't in use. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I'm paranoid about having as much free space as I can manage without having to skim down on progams and stuff too much. </s>
<s> You'd probably be AMAZED at some of the things I use on my laptop(s). </s>
<s> &quot;Before going further....have you backed up your data ?&quot; Not yet, but I'm about to. </s>
<s> Thanks for your concern. </s>
<s> I guess that I'm going to have to put the space-getting on hold for now, since the wireless internet capabilities have recently given out on me. </s>
<s> That's why I took so long to respond. </s>
<s> I typed this on my other laptop. </s>
<s> Thanks for all the help, Deven </s>
<s> Once you've decided you have a few backups and a few recovery plans, you could use GPARTED to push the partitions around and extend them. </s>
<s> This is not an offer to write the tutorial here. </s>
<s> This is YOUR DATA and YOUR CHOICE. </s>
<s> When you do this, it's never a sure thing and this has confused folk new to playing with partitions. </s>
<s> It's safer to juggle sticks of dynamite. </s>
