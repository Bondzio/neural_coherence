<s> for the occasional error: &quot;it can not be remove now, try later.&quot; I just waited a couple of seconds and remove it without problem). </s>
<s> But today i was trying to cut/paste some files from my laptop to the WD. </s>
<s> I pasted the 1ts one, but after that it gave an error saying: &quot;CANNOT COPY (put filename here) : THE DRIVE CANNOT FIND THE SECTOR REQUESTED&quot; i unplugged the WD and plug it in again... and happened the same, copy one file and then the error.... </s>
<s> Even thus this is happening i`m able to read all my files on the WD (all types: pics, clips...) and i was able to Copy/paste files from the WD&gt;&gt; laptop.. After doing this several times (3-4times)i was finally able to cut/paste all the files (no one by one, but as is suppose to be done) without getting this error again. </s>
<s> So even thus the problem seem fix now (without me doing anything) i would like to known what to expect, meaning: why did this happen? </s>
<s> should i check something that may be working wrong? </s>
<s> or any advice that you would consider helpfull. </s>
<s> Thank you ... </s>
<s> You didn't reveal the model number but some of those USB powered drives are unreliable on some machines. </s>
<s> To give it a second chance, copy out the files then delete the partition on the drive, create it anew, format it in NTFS and try again. </s>
<s> If it fails call WD for support or replacement. </s>

<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Dual+Inputs+USB+power+cable&btnG=Google+Search finds a nice dual input USB cable that helps to wring more power from USB ports. </s>

<s> i went to the link u gave me and them to a few sites on where to buy electronics stuff (including bestbuy, and price..something.. :P ) i found two of those dual input usb (did not even knew that existed), with good reviews and that i like... just in case u check this again.. do i need to be carefull with compatibility?? </s>
<s> Also i send a mail to WD (starting to wonder if they would ever reply..one day to reply ..yea right... oh well... patience..) and i would wait a bit to see what they say. </s>
<s> Thx for all ur help </s>
<s> About such without direct links to the products but the dual usb power cords are commidity items with no known compatibility issues. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> is doing it again..and the ppl from WD do not reply.. i would consider order the dual input cable thingy.... i can not believe the service of WD... i hope that it would get fix again... (silly question but i`m starting to think that is related somehow: if i have an animated movie on my external passport drive and i watched directed from it -the leght is about 1:30h- would that affect the drive?? </s>
<s> i ask a friend and he said no.. but just in case... any thought?? </s>
<s> Thx again..) </s>
<s> The dual usb power cord is ... a power cord. </s>
<s> An item that has no known &quot;compatibility&quot; issues found by anyone. </s>
<s> But there could be a first somewhere. </s>
<s> As such no one will or should tell you it's the &quot;fix.&quot; Does that help? </s>
<s> How about this -&gt; I'd buy one. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> yes i decide to buy one and i order one a couple of hours after i reply my preview post.. what i was asking on that post: &quot;...if i have an animated movie on my external passport drive and i watched directed from it -the leght is about 1:30h- would that affect the drive?? </s>
<s> i ask a friend and he said no.. but just in case... any thought?? </s>
<s> Thx again.&quot; is just me trying to think why it may be doing this error... bc i think that when it happens is i have been watching a movie that was one the external drive.... i would get the cord in about 1.5 week.. and still waiting for WD to reply my e.mail :? </s>
<s> I had the drive in some closed space where it could overheat. </s>
<s> Just guessing here. </s>
