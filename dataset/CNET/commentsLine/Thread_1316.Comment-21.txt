when my file server crashed last year, i decided to build a media center pc instead of a new file server.
one of the best decisions i ever made.
so i have a pc hooked up to my 46&quot; hd dlp tv in the living room and connected to my surround sound receiver with an optical cable.
the pc is also hooked up to my gigabyte network, so streaming movies from netflix or my main pc is no problem at all.
there are tons of legal (and let's face it not so legal)hd content on the web now, and find myself watching more of that then i do regular tv.
