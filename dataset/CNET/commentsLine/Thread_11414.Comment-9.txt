i know knoppix wouldn't be able to read raid 0 drives, (at least from a few years ago), so maybe ubuntu live cd can do that now.
just a thought though.
this os is fine, (at the moment), and no risk of running out of space.
unless i misunderstood what you say.
if the ssd's become read only then the os fails, but if the os is working then i haven't reached that point yet.
or perhaps i misunderstood in another way.
booting from ubuntu is a good test to see if any sectors have become read only?
whichever, it's time i got myself a replacement for knoppix so i will try ubuntu.
