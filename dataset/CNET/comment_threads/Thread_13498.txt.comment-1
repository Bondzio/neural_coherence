I am attempting to see if an HP 1702 can be salvaged.
The monitor flickers even before the PC is turned on, and continues to flicker after the operating system has loaded.
I opened it up.
Checked the capacitors on the main board and the power supply.
They look good, but could they still be the cause, or is something else more likely?
