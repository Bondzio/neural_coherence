i think i did delete lot of not use program such as spyware and maybe by mistake also delete ... than starting had problem on my dell 5100 loptop i used device manager verify the cdrw/dvd matshita ujda740 shown window can not load device driver ... code 39. then i down load driver from dell but shown supported driver is not connected.
so i think your suggestion was right.
but i do not know how to delete the filter registry file as yo mention on the ms article?
