i plan to buy a new notebook within a couple of months, either a pc or a macbook pro (that's another story---i've used pc's for almost 20 years but am looking into the macs).
my question concerns processors.
i've &quot;built&quot; two identical hp 6000's at  vista home premium 15.4&quot; wxga brightview widescreen (1280x800) 256mb nvidia(r) geforce(r) go 7400 hp imprint finish + microphone + webcam 2048mb ddr2 system memory (2 dimm) 160gb 5400rpm sata hard drive lightscribe super multi 8x dvd+/-rw w/double layer intel(r) pro/wireless 3945abg network w/bluetooth 6 cell lithium ion battery.
the only difference is the processors: 1. amd turion 64 x2 dual-core tl-60(2.0ghz/1mb) or 2. intel core 2 duo t7200 (2.0ghz/4mb l2 cache).
what kind of difference would i notice between the two processors?
the amd computer would be $90 cheaper, but the processor has only 1mb of cache while the intel has 4mb.
how much does that affect speed?
or, could i save even more by stepping down to a slower processor?
for instance, the amd dual-core tl-56(1.8ghz/1mb) would be $75 less than the amd dual-core tl-60 (2.0ghz/1mb).
the intel core 2 duo t5600(1.83ghz/2mb l2 cache) would be $100 less than the intel core 2 duo t7200 (2.0ghz/4mb l2 cache).
i thought i had read somewhere that the amd turion dual core chips had fallen behind the intel core 2 duo chips.
because i tend to keep my notebooks for several years (my present hp is four years old), i want the get the fastest processor practicable.
btw, i asked this in the laptops forum and have not had a reply as of now.
i really appreciate any input.
thanks, bill
