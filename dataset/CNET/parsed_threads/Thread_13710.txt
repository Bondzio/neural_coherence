<s> What is the fastest CPU on the market (that anyone can buy fairly easily). </s>
<s> Also what is the fastest prosessor for the G5, Pentium and AMD? </s>
<s> I am not so educated on the G5. </s>
<s> However, the fastest processor for AMD is the FX-55 and its specs are 2600/1024/HTT. </s>
<s> And the fastest for Intel is the Pentium 4 570J and its specs are 3800/1024/800. </s>
<s> As Christmas nears, Intel will release a new P4EE and we will retake the market. </s>
<s> That P4EE will be the fastest and its specs will be 3733/2048/1066 making for a speed daemon processor. </s>
<s> The fastest CPU cannot run on a table all by itself. </s>
<s> Manufacturers of MBs must be in on it too (and RAM manufactures also). </s>
<s> The availability of the whole package is as important as it is for a single component. </s>
<s> These new babies tend to be pricy and tempramental. </s>
<s> Athlon 64 FX-55. </s>

<s> The fastest chip on the market to day would have to be the AMD Athlon 64 FX55. </s>
<s> It isn't as versatile as the Intel P4EE 3.6GHz chip but it wins hands down in every other category. </s>
<s> The lack of DDR2 however, keeps me away from the AMD chip for now. </s>
<s> But the boards are coming. </s>
<s> G5? </s>
<s> I have no idea, I don't work with Macs, sorry. </s>
<s> -Mike </s>
<s> Which of these processors is the fastest for continuous maths calculations, used in programs that may take many hours to complete the calculations. </s>
<s> Fastest CPU is AMD FX-55. </s>
<s> Intel suks now especially with the expensive price and less performance. </s>
<s> The AMD FX-55 is faster, but you probably have to be a spoiled rich kid, or make a pretty good wage, to buy the FX-55 from $816-$840 (processor alone - Newegg). </s>
<s> Now the fastest CPU is the Intel Core 2 Quad Q8650. </s>
<s> I might have spelled it wrong but anyways it is the fastest as of 08/26/07. </s>
<s> Damn I got orientation for school tomorrow </s>
