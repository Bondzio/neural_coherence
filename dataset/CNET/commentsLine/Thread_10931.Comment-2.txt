no, you can't use that difference to free up space.
this has to do with the minimum size allocated for any piece of data.
most files require several allocation units but some of these units are not completely used.
consider that you needed 12 ounces of water but your cups only held 10 ounces.
you'd need 2 cups to hold the water.
one would be full and the other have only 2 ounces if done the way data is stored on a disk.
so, the size is 20 but size in cups only 12.
