Check out the Elgato offerings.
I have an EyeTV 250 and this has a console setting that is supposed to reduce latency in game play.
As someone said earlier, you hook your Wii up to this and tune it to the TV channel it's using Caveat - I have not tried this and the reviews are mixed.
Check out Elgato's site or the reviews on the Apple Store Oh - and if you are off to college and they have an aerial point(or a good signal) you can use the Eye to watch/record broadcast analog or digital TV!
