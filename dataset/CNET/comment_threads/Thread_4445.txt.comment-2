I have both Intel and AMD based units but the AMD units were selected because our office is testing 64-bit ports of our applications and we use a software that uses that.
There is little reason to go one way or the other unless we make up a spreadsheet to sort out which delivers the goods for the buck.
Today I'd consider the machines to be lightyears beyond the 233 MHz machine and it's use so &quot;almost any&quot; current machine would be quite nice.
