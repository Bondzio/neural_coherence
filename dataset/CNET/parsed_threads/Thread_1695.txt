<s> I'm a novice computer building and I'm trying to update my old Dell Dimension 4600 (circa 2003). </s>
<s> The original system had the following: 2.66 GHz Pent 4 512 MB RAM 40GB HDD I had added the following during the course of its life span: eGeForce 6600 AGP, 256 MB 300GB Hard Disk To help improve its sluggish speed, I recently upgraded the ram from 512MB (2 sticks of 256MB DDR, PC2700) to 2GBS (2 sticks of 1GB DDR, PC2700). </s>
<s> After installing the RAM, I've been encountering numerous problems. </s>
<s> These problems include the BSOD, numerous crashing, tons of Win32 errors, and just about all programs closing to due to fatal errors. </s>
<s> I've run memtest on both sticks of RAM together as well as each stick independently for about 2 hours each. </s>
<s> All the scans revealed indicated the memory was fine. </s>
<s> I attempted to reinstall windows xp, but it locked up about 3/4 of the way through (after it got to &quot;installing devices&quot;). </s>
<s> I eventually replaced the old original RAM and was able to finish the windows install, but I'm hesitant to add the new RAM back. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any insights ito what may be causing all these problems? </s>
<s> One idea I got from perusing these boards is a lack of power? </s>
<s> The power supply in the tower has an output of 250W. </s>
<s> Would this new RAM (4x the original) be too much for the supply? </s>
<s> Thank you so much for your help! </s>
<s> Does the motherboard support two Gig of RAM? </s>
<s> All things considered, two Gig is major overkill. </s>
<s> Have you tried with one stick of the new RAM? </s>
<s> If things are normal, swap the sticks. </s>
<s> If it fails, you have a bad stick. </s>
<s> If it works, the motherboard may not support two Gig. </s>
<s> Have you looked at the BIOS? </s>
<s> There may be settings for that much RAM if it is supported. </s>
<s> It runs smoother with just one stick in at a time. </s>
<s> The BIOS indicates that it can run the two gigs, but I'm not certain if I'm checking the correct area. </s>
<s> In looking around at my system specs, it appears that this model dell can run up to 2gigs. </s>
<s> Suspect the system is not designed to run reliably with two 1GB DIMMs (need mfg, series and model # to verify) or RAM settings in BIOS need to be tweaked. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> The System is a DELL Dimension 4600. </s>
<s> The system specs state that the motherboard is designed to handle up to 2 GBs of RAM. </s>
<s> I recieved this information from Dell's Website. </s>
<s> Also, when i have the RAM installed, it registers as 2GBs. </s>
<s> Where would I need to double check to make sure this is correct? </s>
<s> http://www.crucial.com/ Use the finder and input your PC's specs. </s>
<s> Crucial will tell you what you need. </s>
<s> As another/repeat thought, two Gig is still waaaaaayyy overkill. </s>
<s> Unless you're mapping the human genome you'll never use or need two Gig. </s>
<s> If it works with one Gig, return the other stick. </s>
<s> I really forsee problems in trying to make this work. </s>
<s> If the PC was happy with two Gig, we wouldn't be having this conversation. </s>
<s> This RAM was recommended by their advisor. </s>
<s> The amount was also recommended. </s>
<s> Do you have any opinion regarding the potential power source problem? </s>
<s> it runs better with one stick than two. </s>
<s> Have you tried each individual stick to make sure one isn't bad? </s>
<s> No, just because it's new doesn't mean it's GOOD. </s>
<s> Are you sure you handled them with care, or that you were properly grounded when you installed the ram, or touched other components? </s>
<s> Did you make sure the RAM slots are clean of dirt and dust and the Ram connectors are clean as well? </s>
<s> Are you sure it isn't the graphics card? </s>
<s> You said it was running sluggish before. </s>
<s> While 512 isn't top end, I have't seen too many computers run THAT sluggish on 512 unless it had other issues.Are you sure your cpu fan\heat sink are clear of dust and dirt as well? </s>
<s> I may not have caught what Power supply you have, what wattage is it? </s>
<s> Paul </s>
<s> Your 250w psu is getting a little light. </s>
<s> I can't think of a good reason why 2 sticks of 1GB would consume more power than 2 sticks of 256MB but keep the psu in mind. </s>
<s> Memtest for 2 hrs on 2GB of memory might not tell you much....let it run for 24hrs+. </s>
<s> Since your working with an old clunker check the maker for any bios/mobo updates that might address this issue. </s>
<s> Consider the possibility that 3/4 yrs ago no normal person put 2GB into a machine, so the maker didn't spend a lot of time making that work. </s>
<s> Crucial is talking about installing in pairs so I'll assume dual channel. </s>
<s> What happens if you install in single channel mode? </s>
<s> I'm 99% sure the ram is good. </s>
<s> I ran memtest on both sticks, indpendently, for 2 hours. </s>
<s> The RAM appears to be fine. </s>
<s> I'm using a 250 Watt source, which may be the problem. </s>
<s> OK on the quantitiy of RAM (2GB) what about the BIOS.? </s>
<s> Is BIOS the current version ?? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Thanks for the tip about memtest. </s>
<s> I've run the RAM in single channel mode and I get less errors, still not error free unfortunately. </s>
<s> The reason I suspect the power supply is that I recently (within the last 6 months) added a few power draining components. </s>
<s> A 256MB video card (which specifies needing a PSU of at least 300) and a 300GB hard drive. </s>
<s> I was unaware of the strenght of the power supply and adding 4x's the RAM may have been enough to drain all the power. </s>
<s> Is that a fair assumption? </s>
<s> Thanks for your help! </s>
<s> Yup, the BIOS is the most recent. </s>
<s> The motherboard is a Dell 02Y832. </s>
<s> 250 Watt PSU </s>
<s> The symptoms you are describing sound more like a result of a partition failure in you hard drive. </s>
<s> This is usually caused by a virus. </s>
<s> I would download a heavy virus scanner like Panda True Prevent, run it, and see what manifests itself. </s>
<s> People get complacent with Virus protection. </s>
<s> If you don't have a problem with that, go to Crucial Technologies and run the Memory scanner. </s>
<s> Crucial's stuff works. </s>
<s> I'd almost bet that a virus has slipped in the back door of your current AVP and screwed up your hard drive. </s>
