What will irk most is that service and support will cost more than replacing the printer.
Perils of lower costs.
I will not write much about why removing free support lowers the initial cost of the printer, but I have learned to just pay the piper on ink cartridges.
The Epson has some superfine nozzles and I can't say if non-Epson ink will clog.
But will note that your warranty is void now and I'd open the window before tossing it.
