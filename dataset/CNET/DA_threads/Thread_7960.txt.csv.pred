1.1.1	Hey there .	St
1.1.2	I have a Compaq Presario SR1300AN .	St
1.1.3	The spec 's are : http : //h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document ? lc=en & cc=us & docname=c00282472 & dlc=en & product=446896 & printable=yes & encodeUrl=true & I am wondering , is this computer worth being upgraded ?	Ques
1.1.4	Or should I build a new one ?	Ques
1.1.5	I am interested in using it for Gaming , browsing , listening to music , windows live messenger .	St
1.1.6	Should I just buy a whole new PC or just build one .	St
1.1.7	If so can you help me find a cheap setup ?	Ques
1.1.8	Thank you	St
1.2.1	When you change the motherboard the OS that came with the Compaq usually fails .	St
1.2.2	At a few hundred bucks , it can be the deal breaker .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	upgrade to a Proprietary computer such as a Compaq , Dell , HP , etc .	St
1.3.2	You can reuse some of the components , however the first major problem is the nifty little cases they use .	St
1.3.3	Simply too small to adequately cool any of the improvements you would want to make .	St
1.3.4	Start with a new case [ under $ 60 ] .	St
1.3.5	Best to buy one sans Power Supply and buy a separate supply that you verify has all the power needed as well as connectors needed for new mobos , videos etc .	St
1.3.6	Very possible that your Dell does n't even have a slot for a video card , which right there kills gaming .	St
1.3.7	The FSB shows as 333 MHz which ca n't be upgraded without getting a new mobo .	St
1.3.8	You do n't want to get involved finding out if the Dell mobo is wired for a standard ATX V2 supply or pay an arm and a leg for one from them .	St
1.3.9	Go to newegg and check prices .	St
1.3.10	Yep you will have to buy a new Op Sys [ XP Pro with SP2B , OEM CD from Newegg is $ 139 .	St
1.3.11	Home is $ 89 ] .	St
1.4.1	About all I plan to salvage from my old Compaq is the case and even that will need some sheet metal work .	St
1.4.2	Ever time I try and start a build ( price it out ) I find that buying a new OS ( must be real and complete ) causes the price to go up to the point I can buy for cheaper then I can build it .	St
1.4.3	I usally stop and decide to live with what I have .	St
1.4.4	Try here for more general info http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-7586_102-0.html ? forumID=68 & threadID=223495 & messageID=2347588 Look at my reply & quot ; Basic things to watch for when buying & quot ;	Ques
1.5.1	The off the shelf computer you have now has a cheap motherboard and processor , so most other parts will be selected on price rather than quality .	St
1.5.2	By using a top class motherboard and processor these parts will have a 3 year warranty .	St
1.5.3	A 400W-500W power supply in a large ATX case for better airflow is needed to run a good video card .	St
1.5.4	Use either a P4 or Athlon 64 motherboard with the latest socket size .	St
1.5.5	Gaming computers need to be top of the line with at least 1 gig of Ram and a core 2 duo processor or dual core processor .	St
1.5.6	You will not be able to build a cheap system if you want to play the latest games .	St
1.5.7	Brand name computers are built to a price first and foremost , this is why a lot of them give trouble .	St
1.5.8	The moment you cut corners on price you cut quality .	St
1.5.9	If cost is a real problem forget using it for serious gaming and put your present system into a larger case with a 400W power supply and install a DVD R/RW so you can burn DVDs and add 2x512 of ram discarding the 256 stick ( you may be able to trade it in if is lifetime warranty Ram ) .	St
1.5.10	Doing this will be a cheap option that will improve your performance and allow you to play older games .	St
1.5.11	With the adittion of a $ 300 video card more modern games can be played .	St
1.5.12	Have fun colo39	St
1.6.1	computers is you do n't have to worry about hardware mismatches and warranties .	St
1.6.2	And you 've got that support on their websites , which nowadays is often a live chat .	St
1.6.3	If you build your own , you run the risk of getting jipped and making mistakes that could cost you a lot of money .	St
1.6.4	Computers nowadays are n't at all what they were 10 years ago .	St
1.6.5	I do n't mean that in the speed and technology sense , but in the & quot ; do-it-yourself & quot ; sense too .	St
1.6.6	Those complete brand name systems offer consumers a no hassle , no nonsense , high quality alternative to the run around and being shafted by people who just want your money .	St
1.6.7	Compaq may have a faster video card , sound card , more memory , and faster chip for you on their web site that could cost you a lot less than a new computer .	St
1.7.1	The situation in USA is different to Australia as here computer shop builds of Desktops are far superior to brand name .	St
1.7.2	The PCUser magazine , almost monthly set a set of criteria to build a desktop too and the larger computer shop builders always are superior and cheaper .	St
1.7.3	Only occasionally do brand name desktops get anywhere near the selected criterior , that also includes price and performance .	St
1.7.4	PC User magazine is the largest Computer Mag in Australia and is highly regarded within the Industry .	St
1.7.5	Many Local computer shops are crooks here too , so by getting a desktop built to a PC uers specification can be the only safe way to build a system if you are not very computer savy .	St
1.7.6	When you buy a desktop here you get much more detail as to what is inside than USA sites I have looked at .	St
1.7.7	Good computer shops will give you a full 3 year hardware warranty as this is what good manufacturers give .	St
1.7.8	A good shop will just replace any faulty parts and deal with the manufacturer for you .	St
1.7.9	If components are sourced from a Chinese supplier direct , not a local agent this causes all the warranty problems .	St
1.7.10	Our overall pricing is cheaper here than USA Our AU $ is worth 75 cents US .	St
1.7.11	Overall computer salesman here are rated like car salesmen , not reliable and they tell lies .	St
1.7.12	A good honest local techie is hard to find especialy if you know about computer hardware and can not be bluffed and lied to .	St
