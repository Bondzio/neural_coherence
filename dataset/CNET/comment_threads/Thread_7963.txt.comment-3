Why fight it, it seems you've done all you can.
It flatly doesn't want to work under Vista.
Return it under warranty, etc.
for a refund or replacement.
The sooner you do this the better the outcome.
FYI - This usually has happened under XP when it first came out, many times the fixes were slow in coming if at all.
The end result some printers were dropped for any support under XP and drivers, fixes and such became only for popular models or expensive ones.
So, don't hold your breath.
