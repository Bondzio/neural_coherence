What wifi speeds would you be referring to?
I think that a 80% decrease in download speeds should not be warranted, given I've seen wireless hit almost 30Mbps on this laptop on other routers.
I'm not looking for 80-100 Mbps, but something over 9 or 10 would be nice.
Keep in mind this is an average over 24 hours.
There were times when it was as low as 4 or 5 Mbps.
This is my only router at this moment, and if I send it to linksys I go dark for awhile.
This wouldn't be an issue, but me and the wife use the internet for work.
