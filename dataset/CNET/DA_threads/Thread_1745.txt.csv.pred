1.1.1	Hello everyone , I have been using my P4 - 2.4 GHz , 512MB Ram , and 80GB Hard Disk and a 24 ! Bit Sound Balaster with 5.1 Speaker Computer for quite 2 years from now .	St
1.1.2	I have also recently added a wireless Router to My Existing Broadband Connection .	St
1.1.3	Some times in my house all the Electrical Applicances ( except the Normal Lighting ) fuse off ... do u think i should be investing on a UPS power Supply ... .Will it help make my computer 's life longer than normal Thanks in Advance ... Surut	St
1.2.1	I use a backup UPS so that I can finish what I 'm working on ( mine lasts for about 45 minutes ) , save my data , and shut down normally .	St
1.2.2	However , I do n't think it has much impact on the overall life of my computer .	St
1.2.3	While a 'normal ' shutdown is best , any damage that may occur from an instantaneous loss of power would be so slight I doubt it would cause any noticable damage down the road .	St
1.2.4	( Provided such is n't a common occurrance where you live . )	St
1.2.5	Now , a surge protector capable of handling your PC 's load is very important , as the ~ $ 50 product will sacrafice itself to save your $ 500+ computer .	St
1.2.6	That translates to a very good investment .	St
1.2.7	Just make sure that the one you get has ethernet and/or coaxal protection , as a power surge is n't limited to power cords .	St
1.2.8	Also , make sure that everything connected to your computer physically is also protected by the surge protector , as once again , electricity is n't picky about how it fries your computer as long as it gets the job done .	St
1.2.9	Hope this helps , John	St
1.3.1	The whole purpose of a UPS is to give you time or & quot ; auto mode & quot ; shutdown in an orderly fashion .	St
1.3.2	In the process saves your work and maybe some grieve .	St
1.3.3	Besides a decent UPS , look also into surge protectors as well , even cheap single AC types do better than nothing , besides a strip protector .	St
1.3.4	Since , you already know you 've some electrical problems , it good insurance .	St
1.3.5	Spend whatever you can afford , but you afford to lose data and/or rebuild data , etc .	St
1.3.6	back to a point you were ?	Ques
1.3.7	Answer that , gives you some practical guidelines .	St
1.3.8	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.4.1	I 'm having problems with UPS maker and the lifetime insurance they offer .	St
1.4.2	I have a somewhat fried computer from a blackout .	St
1.4.3	I can tell you a $ 100-150 one will not work as a $ 40-50 surge protecter .	St
1.4.4	I wo n't but a cheap UPS again it 's a waste of money .	St
1.4.5	The reason why is the cheaper UPS/battery backups do not protect from sine wave problems , although rare these can & usually occur with a blackout , brownout , or spike .	St
1.4.6	These can kill a computer chips quick .	St
1.4.7	Also cheaper UPS is not good for brownout or spikes , so if you buy a cheaper UPS you are buy a false sense of security and a fight should you get zapped .	St
1.4.8	Oh , watch the wireless in a thunderstorm lightning can get you if are close enough to a strike .	St
1.4.9	I got zapped , so good luck	Polite
