The make, model of the PC but I see the mix and match question is answered.
Crucial almost always gets you the right RAM.
But as to the speed that's an interesting issue.
No company wants to produce slower ram so this is why you use higher speed ram.
It will work at the lower speed happily.
But you do have owners that want to know more.
