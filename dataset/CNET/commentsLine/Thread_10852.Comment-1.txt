good evening, i have an hp a705w running win xp home edition that will not boot up.
it will come to a screen that indicates that there is no os installed.
when you try to run the recovery system it shuts itself down.
i have tried replacing the hdd according to the hp support site and as soon as the system attempts to access the hdd all it will do is shut itself off.
any other suggestions?
