I recently bought a new pc (all the computer parts) I needed, so far i have everything connected but the problem is when i turn the power on nothing happens, the monitor acts as if it is not connected to a computer. the fans and lights are on, but it is not doing anything with the HD, i have tried several different harddrives to see if it will work but attempts were futile, does anyone have a solution for this? (it is not the video card or monitor) thanks in advanced

I've seen many issues, but you supplied nothing for the forum to comment on. Start very small. A piece of cardboard, the CPU/HeatSinkFan(HSF), Power Supply Unit(PSU), Motherboard and a Speaker. Plug just that on the cardboard and touch the power up jumper with a metal pen tip or jumper. Beeps are a good sign. No beeps and one of the four parts are misconfigured or dead. Bob

(such as the processor)&quot;	The AMD would self-destruct if the heat sink is left off. You omitted the results of the cardboard test and the wattage of the power supply. For that list, the usual 450 Watt PSU is fitted. Bob

15004	6	3258	38502	38493	R. Proffitt	11/18/03 5:19 AM	1.06913274E12	An article and video about the CPU heat issue.	http://www.tomshardware.com/cpu/20010917/index.html Great way to show the issue. Bob

NEVER STRESS the power supply. But it's sufficient to get the machine up and tested, but you won't find me trusting it. I'd expect it to overheat, randomly crash, stress the motherboard capacitors and eventually need replacement of PSU and motherboard. Bob
