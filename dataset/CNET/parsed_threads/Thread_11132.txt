<s> Amongst video's, digital photo's, music, documents, and other files i probably have a need for upwards of 500gb but less then 1tb of storage. </s>
<s> I want to find a way for taking everything on my computer (currently a dying four year old ARC200 Gateway notebook with 60gb toshiba internal hdd), on a 200gb Maxtor One-Touch External HDD, on a 60gb WD Passport External HDD, on a 160gb WD external HDD, some 50-75gb of digital video stored on the internal hdd of another system, and all the media on about 40-50 old cd-r's to store it in one external stand-alone location. </s>
<s> ideally i'd like to have two of these, one to use on a day to day basis and another simply for a long-term incorruptible storage that can be updated every few months. </s>
<s> Understanding that technology is inpermanent and prone to failure, i am looking for a long term solution that will be the most reliable and efficient method for storing everything i have in one place. </s>
<s> thanks. </s>

<s> Back to CD/DVD and we find this -&gt; http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/894.05/docs/disccare.html Notice that &quot;long term storage&quot; are words on this page. </s>
<s> Also there are documents such as http://www.gcn.com/print/23_5/25166-1.html?topic=news in which you find 25 or more years noted. </s>

<s> you get enough hard disks, unreliable as they might be, you can play like the big boys and girls because statistics works in your favor. </s>
<s> Eg. </s>
<s> http://www.emc.com/products/family/disk-library-family.htm Storage is still at the point in time when cheap, uncomplicated and effortless are incompatible factors. </s>
<s> So it's up to you. </s>
<s> The only real proven technology that has lasted(i know of) and in use today, is mag tape. </s>
<s> I know oil co. have libraries of them and they're from the '60s and on. </s>
<s> For you though the best storage is a very hi-quality CD stored in climate controlled dark room for up to 100yrs. </s>
<s> and have several drives + systems to retrieve it. </s>
<s> Cartridge tape can do as well also. </s>
<s> The topic has been discussed before, google away for other real answers. </s>
<s> Offhand, you may want to look at &quot;flash drives&quot; or similar solid state storage to include HD types. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> The one was posting about getting money back from Seagate. </s>
<s> The HD crashed and cause of warranty period was active they had restored all the data and changed the HD... respect... </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Many copies of said drives and yearly testing... </s>
<s> In my case &quot;early tested&quot; by collegues (other users) </s>
<s> Most that tried that lost it all. </s>
<s> They tried it with common USB hard disks. </s>
<s> The drives slowly became infected, files changed, lost, etc. </s>
<s> Since they &quot;didn't have time&quot; to do the comparision of the master to the loaner but decided only one hard disk set was needed their entire company collapsed later under what is best called &quot;a bad plan.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> is the easiest way of getting out of problems? </s>
<s> or do you have any other ideas how that can work &quot;better&quot;? </s>
<s> a. </s>
<s> Many copies. </s>
<s> b. </s>
<s> Write protected media or similar to CD/DVDRW where you have to command erasure. </s>
<s> c. Off site copies. </s>
<s> d. Test of the system (wipe out a machine and see if you can put it back in operation from backups.) </s>
<s> It's that simple yet many try to ignore the old ways which were learned at great expense. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> for posting... </s>
<s> The thing is, although, as u've mentioned it's easy, most of us(including me) do know about them(statements), but ignore, hoping nothing will happen to our data and it's someone else who should meet those problems.... </s>
<s> What you need (aside from a new, non-failing computer) is a simple backup. </s>
<s> Either make periodic BUs to CDs or DVDs, or to a dedicated back-up drive in your computer. </s>
<s> I thin Norton's Ghost can mantain a fresh backup automaticaly. </s>
<s> DVDs are cheap. </s>
<s> Make a complete BU of what you can't do without and keep it in a safe place. </s>
<s> Better yet, make an additional BU and send it to someone to keep it just in case your house burns down (God forbid) and you lose the BU as well as the computer. </s>
<s> I cannot give much guidance as to what is a good long term storage solution. </s>
<s> I can give some advice as to a couple of items that are NOT a good long term storage solution. </s>
<s> Your home computer writes information to a CD/DVD by a different process from a professionally produced CD. </s>
<s> There is not a whole lot of discussion on forums etc. </s>
<s> about this issue, but the CD or DVD produced on your home computer will begin to lose information and become corrupt after only a few years. </s>
<s> I have CD's that became totally un-readable after only 5 years. </s>
<s> I have some that began losing data in less time than that. </s>
<s> I now always date a CD or DVD and make a new copy of it after 3 years. </s>
<s> The ink on Photos that you print with an inkjet printer also begins to fade sooner than an old &quot;film and photo paper&quot; picture does, too. </s>
<s> Five years is about the typical life of a photo printed on consumer grade photo paper on a consumer grade inkjet printer. </s>
<s> The salvation here is that the photo fades gradually and you have the opportunity to print a fresh copy before it is degraded beyond copying. </s>
<s> It is my understanding that magnetic tape is the most reliable medium for long term storage (25-100 years), but cost of equipment and the tapes themselves makes that method impractical for the typical home user. </s>
<s> I have heard &quot;experts&quot; extol the virtues of harddrives as a reliable long term storage medium, but I do not have any personal experience with this method. </s>
<s> 4.7gb DVD or 25gb Blu-ray discs, the only real safe and cheap way to back up your stuff. </s>
<s> I certainly wouldn't trust HDD's or Flash Memory Cards. </s>
<s> Make sure the discs are in plastic jewel cases and stored in a case in a dry not too humid place and they'll last a hundred years np, well longer than you live for sure. </s>
<s> (only use the basic single sided DVD or basic 25gb Blu-ray disc from a good brand). </s>
