7757	0	122309	1387636	NR	patbajamunde	8/27/05 11:38 AM	1.12514268E12	Screen is blank	I have a problem with my pc. PC specs, AMD 1.90ghz, 248mb RAM, 32 mb PCI video card. When I transfer the PC to the other room and connected back all the cables, I turn on the PC and the screen is blank. I check the PC to the other monitor, but nothing happens. I tried to disconnect the monitor to the video card and tried it on the top (stock one) and still the screen is blank. The PC runs fine. Fans are working well. Can someone have an idea how to solve this? thanks..
