1.1.1	I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for good quality webcams at the above price points?	St
1.1.2	I should say that my priorities are: (1) picture quality and ease of use (2) software (including in the box and connection) I have two girls (3 and 6) who do not see their grandparents nearly enough and I want them to be able to do so.	St
1.1.3	However, I have seen some really poor video from some webcams and want to have as good a quality going out (the system has an AMD 3000+ XP, 512MB, XP Home) as I can get (for the grandparents to view), while having at least better than average coming in (all systems meet the minimum requirements adequate for the purpose, based on specs I have seen for most webcams).	St
1.1.4	I haven't found any very recent threads on this, so I would appreciate your help.	St
1.1.5	Some webcams I have looked at online include the Logitech Ultra and Fusion, the Creative Live!	St
1.1.6	bunch, Microsoft's lifecams (found at BestBuy and others), and some other no-name/lesser brand webcams.	St
1.1.7	I guess this brings up recommended ways to connect the computers.	St
1.1.8	I guess the various IM clients and services, such as Skype, are the obvious choices.	St
1.1.9	Any suggestions for the best/biggest picture?	St
1.1.10	I'm willing to spend some money for a service, if it is worth it, but would prefer cheaper/free.	St
1.1.11	Any help is greatly appreciated!	St
1.1.12	Best regards, Scott	St
1.2.1	No one has any recommendations on this?	St
1.2.2	Is there another forum I should be posting this information request on?	St
1.2.3	Too bad C|Net hasn't done a side-by-side comparison.	St
1.2.4	The technology seems to be hitting a price-point, power, connection speed, and need (with all the military families separated for an extended period) &quot;sweet spot&quot; in which this type of connection is both practical/needed.	St
1.2.5	Heck, *I'll* do a comparison if C|Net will pay for the webcams!	St
1.2.6	Any help will be greatly appreciated!	St
1.2.7	Regards, Scott	St
