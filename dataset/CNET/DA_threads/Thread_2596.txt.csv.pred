1.1.1	I have a 2GB flash drive , vendor unknown , ( bought from Ebay ) , 4 computers all running under Win XP Home , with two desktops and two laptops .	St
1.1.2	The problem : I put two folders , each containing several MP3 files on the flash drive called & quot ; medialink & quot ; and & quot ; mrKeen & quot ; .	St
1.1.3	The drive is written using my IBM desktop .	St
1.1.4	After writing the files , I read them to see that they are OK. Then I eject the flash drive using the ejection software in the System Tray , then replug the drive and look again at the two folders .	St
1.1.5	Now one of them is empty !	St
1.1.6	Where did the files go ?	Ques
1.1.7	How do I retain them ?	Ques
1.1.8	It did n't used to work this way .	St
1.1.9	How do I determine the cause ?	Ques
1.1.10	Thanks for any help .	St
1.2.1	Simplest is to reboot your PC and replug in the drive .	St
1.2.2	When you eject the media , versus just pulling it out which should be ok for flash unless you changed the drive config , the PC disconnects the drive .	St
1.2.3	When you replug in , PC takes a while to detect it and the media .	St
1.2.4	You may have checked for folder before the autoconfig finished .	St
1.3.1	Faulty even .	St
1.3.2	Did you do a chkdsk on the drive already ?	Ques
1.3.3	Kees	St
1.4.1	I did a check of the flash drive by starting My Computer & gt ; Select drive & gt ; Properties & gt ; Tools & gt ; Error Checking .	St
1.4.2	It said the drive was OK .	St
1.4.3	But , I 'm not sure it is OK , because I can do the same things with another Flash Drive , and there are much more predictable results .	St
1.4.4	Does anyone have suggestions about how to thoroughly check a Flash Drive to verify its condition ?	Ques
1.4.5	Are there certain software utilities which can be employed , available somewhere on the Internet ?	Ques
1.5.1	By the way , I did reboot the computer and replug the Flash Drive .	St
1.5.2	The missing files are still missing .	St
1.6.1	I found a utility ( Flash Check v1.08 , freebie ) on the internet .	St
1.6.2	I ran tests on all my flash drives , and all had zero errors except the NoName 2GB drive which was giving me trouble .	St
1.6.3	This drive gave me about 260 errors !	St
1.6.4	This Flash Check Utility seems to be a very handy item .	St
1.6.5	If anyone knows of a better checker , please let me know .	Ques
1.6.6	I also observed that the board and USB connector on this troublesome drive is somewhat loose in its case .	St
1.6.7	I suspect the following : I have a clock radio next to my bed which permits playing MP3 files stored on a USB Flash Drive .	St
1.6.8	I had used this drive the night before .	St
1.6.9	It is quite possible that sometime during the night I hit this drive while it was still plugged into the radio and did it some damage .	St
1.6.10	It sticks out like a & quot ; sore thumb & quot ; and could easily be harmed .	St
1.6.11	The lesson learned : Do n't leave the flash drive in the machine over night if it is within reach .	St
1.7.1	Your flash drive seems to be logically wounded .	St
1.7.2	It is probably due to fatal virus attacks , file corruption or operating system failure .	St
1.7.3	I suggest you to consult data recovery experts www.eprovided.com who can not only fix your problem but can retrieve your data in minimum cost .	St
1.7.4	Consulting doesnt cost !	St
1.8.1	Just wanted to add that i am suffering a similar problem ( based on two XP Pro systems ) .	St
1.8.2	I thought that it would be a good idea to use a USB flash drive as a backup for my digital camera .	St
1.8.3	Thought it would be more useful for file sharing .	St
1.8.4	I have tried two different drives ( 16gb and a 32gb ) and the same thing happens .	St
1.8.5	I have always taken them out correctly , used all the scan disks and recovery utilites , and still no luck .	St
1.8.6	Folders randomly empty themselves , or leave corrupt files .	St
1.8.7	Any suggestions on what is going wrong would be really helpful .	St
1.8.8	thanks	Polite
1.9.1	Maybe I think you should scan your disk firstly by recovery software .	St
1.9.2	If it could find the data and preview , I think it will recover it .	St
1.9.3	I have the similar experience as you .	St
1.9.4	I download a demo version of EASEUS Data Recovery Wizard and try to scan .	St
1.9.5	It is fair to know if I should buy their software .	St
1.9.6	I think this is a good way to try if you can get the data back .	St
