i recently acquired a 250 gb western digital hard drive that had been formatted on a mac.
on both vista and xp machines it is seen in device manager and disk management but not recognized in explorer so i can't access it to reformat it or use it.
in disk management it does not have a drive letter assigned to it and when right clicking on its icon all options except help are grayed out.
other than putting it back on a mac (as that is not a convenient option) is there anyway that i can get windows to assign it a drive letter so that i can reformat and use it?
thanks james
