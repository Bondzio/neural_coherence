Gateway GT5220	Is THIS &quot;Gateway GT5220&quot; a good pc for someone like me that do little gaming, like battlefield 2, Dawn of War, CnC Generals, uses a lot MSN and hate freezes and slow pc, run small game server, and needs multitasking -&gt; talking about chatting while running a small game server (very small) uses Firefox, check my mail, hear music, photos.

As I understand it, shared RAM means you lose some of the 1GB making it only .988GB or 988MB. You have a PCI-Express (PCI-E x16) slot available so I think you could upgrade for just under 200 US dollars to a better card. Keep in mind when up-grading, a new high power video card may require a new bigger power supply (add 50 to 100 more US dollars). You may want to have gateway do it so you don't lose the warranty (yes that will cost more and reduce your selections of cards). I have a Gateway and have had to use the warranty to replace the hard drive, so be advised. Hope this helps.

Link comparing the two which notes in part: &quot;Without a doubt, the 3800+ should be the first choice of any AMD fan on a budget (or anyone needing a new processor who is pinching pennies). Taking into consideration price versus performance, low power demands and our great overclocking results we easily find that the AMD Athlon 64 X2 3800+ deserves our Editor's Choice Award.&quot; While that is a rather dated article they do compare the models you list.

The AMD comes to be more faster and reliable and the quality is sometimes outstanding. I personally use an Intel P4, but im getting outdated and it works good enough for my gaming and what I do.

The most I need is multitasking. THanks -ZP
