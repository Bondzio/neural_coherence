<s> I had a friend of mine build a pc for me last November and it is having booting problems. </s>
<s> I figure the problem is most likely the motherboard or power supply but I do not know how to narrow it down. </s>
<s> I have 1.12 gb of ram in the pc. </s>
<s> At first I thought i was slightly overclocking the processor so I took 128mb of ram out and went down to 1gig and was still having the same problem. </s>
<s> This morning I swapped them both out for one another and still nothing. </s>
<s> It all started a few months after I had the pc. </s>
<s> It wouldn't boot up again after shutting it down. </s>
<s> I would only get a blank screen. </s>
<s> I would have to constantly turn the pc off and then turn it back on by either unplugging it or hard reset(holding the button down) then reboot it to get it to come on. </s>
<s> Usually after a few tries it would work but I left town for a month and when I got back I had HELL trying to get it to boot up again. </s>
<s> I shut it down(big mistake)last night and got up this morning to boot it up and it won't do a thing! </s>
<s> The power comes on and the light on the monitor flashes a few times but nothing. </s>
<s> The fans are running fine, the hard drive is fine(i tested another hd and it won't work either), my dvd drives are blinking and working fine, and the lights on the pc are coming on and blinking. </s>
<s> There is a red light that usually flashes when there is some sort of activity on my pc, and it blinks a few times as if it's doing something then after about 10 seconds it stops and only the green light stays on. </s>
<s> There is no activity on screen at all. </s>
<s> Any help on this situation I would greatly appreciate! </s>
<s> Well beezie they could be several causes for this but if all lights come on it is definately not in your power supply.Second if it was the actual motherboard itself then your computer would not do nothing. </s>
<s> To name a few things that could be wrong is a ribbon cable could be plug in on the mother board backwards, or it could be half way off the mother board that is mainly some of the problems. </s>
<s> second you could do individual check first unplug each of your cdroms individually not the ribbon cable but the white plug. </s>
<s> one at a time unplug one and turn on computer still dont boot plug the cdrom back up then repeat for the other drives. </s>
<s> then do a individual swap with your ram sticks pull out one then turn on computer still dont boot pull the other ram stick out and put one back in still dont boot then you have eliminated the cdrom problem the floppy problem the power supply and the ram. </s>
<s> if the problem is not cured borrow a processor from someone and plug it in to see if the processor has gone bad on the computer. </s>
<s> one of these opinions will solve your problem if it dont then i would beat my pc builder </s>
