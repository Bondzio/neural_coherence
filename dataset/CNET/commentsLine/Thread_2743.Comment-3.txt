thanks for the advice.. 1. i will make it their problem 2. how exactly can the bios be the culprit here ?
perhaps you mean to say it may cause problems with the first stages of the windows setup process or the agp conflict ?
it was an ata hd not a sata, so i didn't need any additional drivers.
3. i'll try it without the cover tommorow, thought i think the hardisk failed already as the system now doesn't even detect it.
prompting me with a hardisk error.
4. every cd was reading ok, besides the ati agp driver cd, gives me some sort of x006e etc.
layer/kernel problem or something.
the whole system feels horrible.
