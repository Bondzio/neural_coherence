expect the delay/lagging or broken video transmission.. the internet connection is not that fast... beside, that small camera will only stationary on the table, and the lense are not wide enough to capture the scene (it only focus on small area) if someone going to hold the laptop and the camera.. then movement is going to be an issue.. if you put the camera high above, on the ceiling for example (think of it as a security camera) then you will see a distorted image.. well, it just a thought..
