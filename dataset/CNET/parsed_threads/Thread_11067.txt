<s> I just purchased some computer parts and put a computer together. </s>
<s> Now I am trying to install windows on it but it keeps restarting whenever the files are being copied ( I have noticed it ususally restarts when trying to copy the file drivers.cab more often than not). </s>
<s> Here are some specs: *Intel Pentium D 830 3.0GHz Dual-Core Processor *Intel Socket 775 Cooling Fan *MSI P4M890M-L Via Socket 775 MicroATX Motherboard / Audio / Video / PCI Express / 10/100 Ethernel LAN / USB 2.0 / Serial ATA / RAID *Ultra 1024MB PC3200 DDR 400MHz Memory *XFX GeForce 7600 GS / 256MB GDDR2 / SLI / PCI Express / Dual DVI / HDTV / Video Card *Caviar Special Edition 80GB IDE Hard Drive Any help would be appreciated, thank you for reading. </s>
<s> There's some parts missing from your list but I can't tell if you have a SATA drive. </s>
<s> That wipes out those that didn't read how to install to SATA. </s>

<s> If it passes 4-6 hours then, test the HDD with the MFG diags...available on their respective website Let us know what you find VAPCMD </s>
<s> I also have *Ultra Black Defender ATX Mid-Tower Case with 350-Watt Power Supply I just switched the powersupply to 400W. </s>
<s> Testing it now. </s>
<s> I already tried 2 hard drives and an external drive with no avail. </s>
<s> (though the external HD just seems to stop the setup and does not restart). </s>
<s> Still the ame problem with the new power supply, I have a new error though: </s>
<s> http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314474 I wonder if you are using some XP from another machine. </s>
<s> An owner reported this to me and they were trying to use their HP supplied CDs on a machine they built themselves. </s>
<s> Yup, that doesn't work. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yes, the cd is not from another machine. </s>
<s> Also that message doesn't come up, it was due to some pins getting bent on the IDE connector I think, well it's fixed and the thing keeps restarting, I have a feeling it could be the RAM but I have no way of testing it. </s>
<s> About that CD and what machine it was. </s>
<s> You may have discovered the issue and cause. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Did not know you can test your ram and HD without any OS set up. </s>
<s> Doing it now. </s>
<s> The CD works as my friend formatted his laptop and his computer using it, I have an old cd of Windows ME from my sony desktop and when I run that a gray screen appears saying that the cd is not from this machine. </s>
<s> I did the ram test with Memtest86, my first run through it at about 10 min into the session th pc restarted leaving the cd in the machin kept restarting non-stop until I removed the cd. </s>
<s> (no errors were found I think it got to about 37%) I am retrying the test again. </s>
<s> Well I just got another ram stick and the problem still persists, could it be the CPU or the Motherboard? </s>
<s> I am leaning towards the cpu but when I take off the CPU fan and run the PC when it gets hot it shuts down and it does not restart, unlike when I try to boot windows it restarts. </s>
<s> Can the motherboard be responsible for the PC to restart. </s>
<s> I have also tried installing Linux and I also ran a Windows XP cd that is loaded directly from the cd and does not use the HD and the thing restarts anyway. </s>
