no profit mate, i wanted to know some things about my pc fans as well as the rest of its problems.
especially why bios is stating system fan is at 0 rpm readings.
but moving on to my main problem, i will see what google says about i845 boards and bad caps.
about power supply box, i had it changed a year back and repaired couple of months back.
so its not that old.
i didn't understand what you mean by, &quot;leave the cover off until we think we've fixed it.&quot;
