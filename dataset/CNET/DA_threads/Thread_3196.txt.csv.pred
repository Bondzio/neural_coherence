1.1.3	Now I am trying to clone it to a brand new drive with no setup what so ever.	St
1.1.4	The problem is, norton won't see the new drive.	St

1.1.6	thanks Ask if you need any more information.	Polite
1.2.1	The issues there run deep.	St
1.2.2	This is why I use G4U (see google) since it's all of 3 (three) words to type to copy a drive.	St
1.2.3	It's also free.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks, you could have just told me that you have no idea.	St
