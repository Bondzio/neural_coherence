1.1.1	I have a Dell Dimension 2350 desktop with windows XP operating system .	St
1.1.2	Just lately when I shut the machine down completely at night I get & quot ; Program not responding & quot ; .	St
1.1.3	That seems to only happen at night afer the unit has been on all day .	St
1.1.4	If I shut everything down after its only been on for a few hours it works just fine .	St
1.1.5	Sound familiar ... and what should I do ? ?	Ques
1.1.6	Many thanks Mil	Polite
1.2.1	Mil , Does it show you which program is n't responding ?	Ques
1.2.2	If you press Ctrl/Alt/Del keys at the same time it should bring up the Task Manager which may show you which program is n't responding .	St

1.4.1	This was my first PC..a P4 1.8GHz..256 MBs RAM..Home Edition Sp1.. a FAT32 System Drive..30-GBs..McAFEE Security..it was a nice PC.. ..	St
1.4.2	I pulled the HDD first/added a MAXTOR 120-GB DiamondMAX [ NTFS ] File System..added a second RAM Chip for 512MBs of RAM..and the Microsoft CD came out for SP2..so my Home Edition was raised to SP2..how-ever..I also added the XP-Professional Upgrade CD ( SP2 ) ..and this is where I began to develop & quot ; complications & quot ; .. ..	St
1.4.3	So..for a DELL Dimension 2350 I would suggest the latest SP2 XP Full Version Operating System..no Upgrades or SP2 CDs.. Then 512 MBs of RAM..that Motherboard runs really slow RAM ( 133MHz ) if my memory serves me..that 's a problem in these times with HUGE Updateing Services..My Updates have DOUBLED in 6-years.. ..	St
1.4.4	So your running all day with a Shut-Down Problem..	St
1.4.5	I suggest you slow down on Shutting Down.. First..getting to the DeskTop..Signing Off the Internet.. Use the DISK CLEAN UP Program..but wait about 30-seconds before CLicking the ICON ( shortcut ) ..let it RUN..get back to the DeskTop..Click the START-Menu..Click ... TURN-OFF Computer..now wait until the DeskTOP darkens before Clicking TURN-OFF COMPUTER..and that should work..otherwise/yes some Device is still running..because of your Hardware Acceleration..the PC ca n't handle the needs of the programs and hardware..its time to drop some things.. Like a Digital Sound Card ( return ) to your Integrated Sound Card..	St
1.4.6	Remove Video Software..your PC is obsolete for VIDEO..and even DVD-ROM..if you had upgraded to DVD-ROM..you might want to put the CR-ROM and CDRW back in the machine.. ..	St
1.4.7	This was a solution to some of my problems.. My DELL Dimension 2350 was upgraded to a newer Motherboard and Processor and faster RAM..	St
1.4.8	But I purchased a DELL 1100-series DE051..that had numorious problems because of Hardware Acceleration-due to the DVD Drives..and VIDEO applications..also DELL delivered a machine with the wrong RAM Module..once that was replaced/I pulled the Drives and used the old Dimension CD Drives and used the DE051 DVD Drives in the Upgraded 2350..in the DE051 I dropped the Hardware Acceleration-one notch..viola'..one spectacular Internet PC.. ..	St
1.4.9	If your DELL Dimension 2350 is all original..I can almost assure you its obsolete..but would suggest you just slow down on Shut-Downs..let your DESKTOP -- -darken..and then CLICK -- -Turn OFF .	St
1.5.1	I tried to do as suggested but I got the same result .	St
1.5.2	It seems to be that way after the computer is on for a lebgthy period of time .	St
1.5.3	Does that make sense ? ? ?	Ques

1.7.1	I have been having problems with my printer of late..COULD the & quot ; card reader & quot ; aspect of which I speak have anything to do with the printer problems ( Brother MFC 4420C ) ? ? ?	Ques

1.8.1	Hi all New to this site .	St
1.8.2	I am having a problem when I am shutting down .	St
1.8.3	I run win xp , ECS 939pin mb , AMD Athlon 64x2 3800+ , 1 Gig mem , I get the following ( card reader lookup window ) I have to end process before I can shutdown .	St
1.8.4	Also the comp just came back from repair ; I notified them they were no help .	St
1.8.5	As I did have an EVGA mb 939pin that was better than the one they replaced it with , that went bad after only 10 months .	St
1.8.6	I am not satisfied with the work they did .	St
1.8.7	I got the unit back , they said they tested it , the hd power cable was off & the hd 's were switched .	St
1.8.8	How could they have tested it ?	Ques
1.8.9	Sorry just venting .	St
1.8.10	Any help would be great .	Polite
1.8.11	Than you MIke .	St
1.9.1	& quot ; I get the following ( card reader lookup window ) I have to end process before I can shutdown & quot ; Many discover that program is not required to read the cards in the reader so they stop using that and the problem is fixed .	St
1.9.2	Bob	St
1.10.1	Other forums indicate that this may be due to a memory card in your printer or memory stick in your computer .	St
1.10.2	If you click on Safely Remove Hardware before exiting ( & select said memory card/stick ) , it 'll go away .	St
1.10.3	I suspect that whether or not the memory card/stick is in place when you turn on the computer has a bearing on this .	St
1.10.4	I 'm amused by this because I thought it was something to do with the Card Reader software ( very old DOS program ) which I continued to use until very recently as I had a load of contact details which only it could read .	St
1.10.5	I have n't used it for 3 months so I was amazed to keep getting this message - anyway , I think I understand now .	St
1.10.6	It 's just another example of Micosoft 's incompetence .	St
1.11.1	I have a brother printer as well .	St
1.11.2	I suspect that you model has the memory card readers built in .	St
1.11.3	If I remove a memory card prior to shut down then MS will hang up at shut down .	St
1.11.4	It wants to save the files even though they are no longer open .	St
1.11.5	I do n't have the same problem with standard memory sticks or USB models for SD cards , just when I use the slots in the Brother Printer .	St
1.11.6	Given that you probably would catch on to that error , I would try try uninstall and reinstall the brother printer software .	St
