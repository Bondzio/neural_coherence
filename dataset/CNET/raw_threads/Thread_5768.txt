Systemax Systems AMD Athlon (tm) Processor 1.00 GHz, 512 MB RAM Windows XP Home version 2002 service pack 2 Last week my cdrw drive was left open and someone broke it with their knee. I went out and bought a new internal drive for $34 called &quot;I/O Magic&quot;. The instructions say the drivers will be installed when I reboot, no software disc needed. I removed the broken drive (taking photos of every move I made and I marked all 3 cables needed). I then installed the new drive. It opened and closed and the light came on. I then went to &quot;My Computer&quot; and the drive was not there. I put an audio disc in to see if it played and it didn't. I then went to I/O magics website and by it's appearance, I didn't expect much. I found drivers for this drive, downloaded and nothing. They recomended I restart in safe mode and it wouldn't. I removed he new drive and am now wondering if there's something I missed or shold have tried. Any and all suggestions are appreciated.

I reattached the same cables used in the broken drive. Thanks for your reply. p.s. I forgot to mention that my DVD drive did not appear either when I opened control panel. After removing the new CDRW it does appear.
