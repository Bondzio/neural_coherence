Hi there, I have recently bought a Dell Axim 50v pocket pc and I have a desktop running Windows XP with boradband connection.
Both of them got WiFi adapters.
But i do not have any router.
Is it possible to share my internet connection with my Pocket PC (thru my desktop) without installing a wifi router?
Like Ad-hoc networking or something?
