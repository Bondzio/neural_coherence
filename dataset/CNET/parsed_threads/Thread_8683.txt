<s> i have a dimension 4550 and i think 1gb is the max. </s>
<s> at least that's what my manual says. </s>
<s> its not even worth upgrading to 2gb anyway, the cpu is too old. </s>
<s> manual declares maximum of 512 per slot (2slots): http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim4550/specs.htm#1103227 </s>
<s> for the Dell 4550 which do you read from The 4550 Series entry indicates only 1GB VAPCMD </s>
