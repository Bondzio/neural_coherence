i can't know this one.
i can tell that without added route add commands, given the lan netmask is 255.255.255.0 and the lan ips are in the 192.168.1.x range, then that gateway is that &quot;x&quot; value from 1 to 254. but i can't tell with the supplied info which machine it is.
i'm only pointing out this is a flawed entry with the information supplied.
my hunch is that the new way of nt/2000/xp/2003 and that users have to be added to each machine can be daunting until you get it all entered on each machine.
