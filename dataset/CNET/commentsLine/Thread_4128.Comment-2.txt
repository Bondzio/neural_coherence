first, you need to create the container.
on one side of the object, have two loops extending from the top and bottom.
take a small rod and place over it two rods- each with a swivel joint- at the top and bottom of this rod with rubber washers to stabilize the area and prevent unnecessary moving.
connect the rod through the loops and cap off the top and bottom to prevent slipping.
with each rod running perpendicular to your box, make another rod with an arm in the middle and attach the two connecting rods at the top and bottom.
make a small plate with two loops close together and attach the other end of the rod to the plate.
from the plate, create a set of legs that wrap around and attach small screws with soft feet at the bottom.
you can use suction cups.
use this makeshift vise to attach the plate to the monitor.
