an inexpensive alternative would be the netgear wgr614.
it's a wired/wireless router, b/g but it cost only $29.99 at my local shack.
i had mine up and running w/ 3 laptops and two desktops within 2 hrs.
(ok, so i took the long route and maybe did some browsing to 'test' the connection) and there hasn't been a hiccup yet.
netgear stuff is fairly solid (imho) and i couldn't beat the price.
