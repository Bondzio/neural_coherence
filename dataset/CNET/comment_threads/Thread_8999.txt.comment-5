You don't need any kind of wizard to transfer data from a hard drive to a flash drive.
The reason I mentioned going with NTFS is only if you have some very large files as FAT32 has something of a 4gb limit and folks who download movies and stuff can have some fairly large files.
If you don't do that, there's no problem.
The flash drive is seen in explorer just like any other drive.
You can select files or entire folder and just copy and paste them from one drive to the other.
As for the flash drive being bootable after that....sorry...nope.
It's possible to make a flash drive bootable to run some utilities but not Windows.
