here's what i'd do... go to the windows &quot;start&quot;... &quot;control panel&quot; &quot;admin tools &quot;computer management&quot; &quot;disk management&quot; do a right (mouse) click on one of the cds....and select change the drive letter to say &quot;r&quot;.
then do the same to the other cd...make it drive &quot;s&quot;.
shut down the pc (uplug it from ac power) and disconnect power or data data cable from new hdd.
then reboot the pc to to see how the drive letters show up....you should have a &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot; plus an &quot;r&quot; and &quot;s&quot;.
if this is the drive line up ....open explorer and right click on &quot;c&quot; on type in a name for &quot;c&quot; in the &quot;label box&quot;.
if present do the same for &quot;d&quot;.
now shut down again (unplug from ac power) and reconnect the new hdd..and see what drives shows up other than &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot; or &quot;r&quot; and &quot;s&quot;.
then you should be able to identify the new hdd and prepare (partition and format) it for use with your system.
keep us posted vapcmd note: reason i suggest changing the cd-rom drive letters to r and s is to avoid the confusion that develops when you add a new hard drive or hard drives to the system... hdds takes precedence over the cds in drive letter assignments by leaving unused drive letters beteween the hard drive(s)and the cd-roms eliminates the cd-rom drive letters from being bumped/changed in the future.
