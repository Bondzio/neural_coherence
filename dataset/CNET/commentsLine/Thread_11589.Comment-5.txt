shows you what signal is on each pin.
it's fair for me to write that wiring up a vga connector is beyond your average technician or they don't have the equipment or patience.
not to mention the cost involved.
if you examine the pin out carefully you may see that pin 15 may not exist on some monitors (some may write it's broken!)
and some systems didn't use all the grounds (a bad idea in my playbook.)
as to the screen that shrank to 1/2 the size an dnow is a solid horizontal line, that is a classic failure a tv technician will know about.
but is not repairable by consumers.
in closing, lethal and fatal voltages are inside such devices even after the unit has been unplugged for more than a year.
don't open it.
