<s> I have 3 HP computers, and three HP printers. </s>
<s> I WILL NEVER BY ANOTHER HP PRODUCT AS LONG AS I LIVE!!!! </s>
<s> It is now July 2005 my problems began in April 2005 so we are taking about a period of 4 months!!! </s>
<s> Problem 1: Computer will not turn on (it is less than 2 months old). </s>
<s> They say owe well well send you a box pack it up and ship it to us. </s>
<s> So I did. </s>
<s> They send it back, claiming that they tested it, and I get a computer back that is missing the memory card (therefore, it will not boot at all). </s>
<s> So I call and of course they cant just send me my memory chip they have to have me send the computer back to them again. </s>
<s> So I do. </s>
<s> And they send it back (supposedly testing it first) and I again get a non-working computer. </s>
<s> So I send it back again, and they send it back again, and you guessed it, it still doesnt work. </s>
<s> So then I get to talk to the Sr. Quality Manager, HP Executive Customer Relations Management who guarantees me that I will get a working computer. </s>
<s> So again I send it and finally they send me a working computer. </s>
<s> But now they had the computer as long as I did. </s>
<s> So I continue to use the products as I have already paid for them and one of the other computers dies.it has a CPU fan that failed and will not boot up because of it. </s>
<s> So I calland again I am told that they cant send me the part (even though I told them I could easily install a CPU fan myself). </s>
<s> So I wait for the box, send the computer back.AND GET THE WRONG COMPUTER BACK!!!!! </s>
<s> Then when I call I am told they have no idea where my computer is but they will have someone call me back. </s>
<s> When they never called back I called them. </s>
<s> They then claim my computer was at their service center the entire time (BULL) and that they havent fixed it yet (BULL) and that I need to send the computer I got back before they can send mine to me. </s>
<s> Then the Service Manager tells me he cant guarantee my computer is coming back to meWHAT THE F***!!!! </s>
<s> He refused to give me anything in writing stating I will even get any computer at all back!!!! </s>
<s> Since I am doing the right thing and sending the wrong computer back I guess I can only hope and pray that I get something in returnBUT NO GUARENTEE AS THE SERVICE MANAGER told me THERE IS NO GUARENTEES IN LIFE!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> NIL </s>
