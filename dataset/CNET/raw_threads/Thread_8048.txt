And it is sorted by bucks! -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card,2521.html &quot;Radeon HD 5750 (Check Prices) Great 1920x1200 performance in most games Radeon HD 5770 Codename: RV840 &quot;Juniper&quot; Process: 40nm Universal Shaders: 720 Texture Units: 36 ROPs: 16 Memory Bus: 128-bit Core Speed MHz: 700 Memory Speed MHz: 1,150 (4,600 effective) DirectX/Shader Model: DX 11/SM 5.0 While the Radeon HD 5750 offers similar gaming performance to it's less-expensive competition (the Radeon HD 4850 and GeForce GTS 250), it has better longevity appeal with DirectX 11 support. Sporting Dolby TrueHD/DTS-HD Master Audio and three monitor outputs, the 5750 might appeal to those who want a low-power gaming card appropriate for an HTPC.&quot;

I can shave a few dollars off the price and at least put you into HD5770 territory.

Take a look at some benchmarks at places like tomshardware to help you choose the right graphics card for your budget and needs. http://howtoinstallagraphicscard.blogspot.com/ has some brief advice about choosing a graphics card and how to install a graphics card if you fancy taking a look. Generally speaking I think the ati radeon 5 series have been well received, however the 5750 is somewhat underpowered for many games and higher resolutions. Hope that is some help!
