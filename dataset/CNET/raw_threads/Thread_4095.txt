It has Linux installed on it, but after seeing I wasn't compattable with Linux I intalled WindowsXP. Since then, everything has been a bit sluggish. I believe someone told me to get a new CPU? And I know I need some RAM. However, my problem is, i'm completely oblivious to computer hardware. I don't know a damn thing about it. =( This is the information from my system control pannel. Computer: VIA Samuel 2 801 HMz 112 MB of RAM I have playback issues with particular movies I download. They're skip and jump, sound doesn't match up with video. I heard my processor was too slow for this job, and that I would be best off getting an Intell Pentium III. Also I was told I need a stick of 215MB of RAM, or something along those lines. Anyway, what i'm trying to get at is, I need to speed up my computer. When I play games, the graphics are really bad, I don't know if that also is my CPU or if I need to buy a graphics card. Also, how would I go about trying to find what my MotherBoard is? Seriously, any information will help..

That 128MB RAM is about 1/2 what I would try for DVD playback. Also, not a word in your post about OS, etc so go get a GEEXBOX (hint: google.com) CD and see if that plays your DVD. I don't offer any support for this since it's all documented on the web. Bob

The OS, the DVD player and more on a bootable CD with only 6.1 MB. It's a simple test to see if your hardware can play a DVD. If you can't do this, then what will we do? Bob
