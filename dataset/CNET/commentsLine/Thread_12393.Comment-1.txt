would anyone happen to have any advice for using speedfan?
im trying to figure out what the best setting would be in my case.
im using an intel core i5 760 with no overclocking and am wondering what the best settings would be in terms of what my desired temps should be and what my warning temps should be.
i am also using a gtx 460 gpu, also not overclocked... so what would be some good settings for that.
and to settings to maintain a quiet but still effective fan speed (im using the coolermaster 212 plus heatsink fan combo) only one fan shows the rpms (fan1) and i can only guess its the cpu cooler
