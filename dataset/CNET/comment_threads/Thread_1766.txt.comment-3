but $600+ have trouble running Obilivion on high settings.
I'm not kidding, once you step outdoors, major lag.
Trying to get a card UNDER $200 with that kind of performance is impossible.
I looked at the compatible cards and none will provide a great gaming performance and with 100% green.
The AI X800 is good, but it has two yellows.
The best card you can get is the nVidia 6600, which will not get you all the highest settings, many of them must be set at medium or low.
It does, however, get all greens.
