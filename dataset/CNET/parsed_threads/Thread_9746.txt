<s> Is there any advantage going from vga, to vga to dvi adapter, then to dvi input on monitor? </s>
<s> Or the same as going straight vga to vga on monitor? </s>
<s> Is there bigger advantage if i get a new vid card with dvi out? </s>
<s> Currently my machine has onboard Radeon X300/X550 series. </s>
<s> &quot;VGA &gt; vga to dvi adapter &gt; DVI any advantage ?&quot; None at all unless that's what is needed to connect the monitor you have. </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> The adapter is just wires to send the signal to the proper pins. </s>
<s> &quot;Is there bigger advantage if i get a new vid card with dvi out? </s>
<s> Currently my machine has onboard Radeon X300/X550 series.&quot; I want to lump these two questions into one. </s>
<s> Almost any video card can outperform onboard video. </s>
<s> So there is an advantage there. </s>

<s> Hello, Thanks. </s>
<s> I just did a search and found that the benefit of DVI is that digi signal goes straight to monitor whereas vga converts it to analog first and thats where the quality is lost. </s>
<s> So in my case I just stick with VGA or upgrade my vid card. </s>
<s> If you open it up, it's just wires to run the VGA signals from the VGA connection the the DVI. </s>
<s> What magic is this? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Is it correct that because the original video signal created by the CPU is Digital, then using the DVI output from the card eliminates a D to A conversion? </s>
<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVI notes the FIVE DVI connection types. </s>
<s> Which is being used in your system? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> common sense says I have to side with Robert. </s>
<s> For an average Joe user like me (surfing, doing a little video stuffs, etc. </s>
<s> ), vga should do just fine; I won't go out and spend big bucks for dvi hardwares. </s>
<s> But if hi-def video is your thing, then dvi will be needed. </s>
<s> So how's the new year been treating you so far? </s>
<s> Hopefully better than last year. </s>
