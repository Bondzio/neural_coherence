maybe you can help to start a company that will attempt to sell inexpensive computers with absolutely no junkware.
if there is a strong market for such things at a price that will be profitable, then it will be successful and you will be very wealthy!
heck, i'll even buy some stock after you ipo.
i wonder if r&d, purchasing, and marketing departments ever get together in these big companies to consider such things...nah, they wouldn't do that.
maybe they would even test-market such things...nah, they wouldn't do that.
market research and consumer polls?
...nah, they wouldn't do that.
price points?
...nah.
