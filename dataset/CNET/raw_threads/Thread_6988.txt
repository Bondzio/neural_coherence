First of all, will any graphics card work ok? Or does it need to be a particular configuration to suit my PC? What are the things I need to see if they are compatible with my PC when looking for a graphics card? Secondly, is there any difference between a graphics adapter and graphics card? Thirdly, I've shortlisted these graphic cards/adapters. Which is the one I should go for? I'm looking for one that basically lets me play the latest games at high FPS. Thanks! http://www.amazon.co.uk/Inno3D-GeForce-7600GS-512MB-Graphics/dp/B000M2WL62/ref=sr_1_1/026-0516226-3522044?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1181987817&sr=1-1 http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sapphire-Radeon-x1550-512mb-11093-10-20R/dp/B000N0OMDS/ref=sr_1_6/026-0516226-3522044?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1181987817&sr=1-6 http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sapphire-Radeon-X1650-512MB-Graphics/dp/B000RF4CDO/ref=sr_1_15/026-0516226-3522044?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1181987817&sr=1-15 http://www.amazon.co.uk/Inno3D-Geforce-8500GT-800MHz-Graphics/dp/B000Q2LRYA/ref=sr_1_16/026-0516226-3522044?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1181987817&sr=1-16

Read http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/05/01/the_best_gaming_video_cards_for_the_money/ and see if you picked one from their list. &quot;First of all, will any graphics card work ok? Or does it need to be a particular configuration to suit my PC? What are the things I need to see if they are compatible with my PC when looking for a graphics card?&quot; Yes. The units you picked appear to be 3 PCIe and the third one is an AGP. You need to figure out which your machine supports. Also some machines need a power supply upgrade. Since you neglected our forum note I can't answer which one would possibly work (agp or pcie). Here's the forum note you should see when posting. &quot;Note: If you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem. Also please exercise your best judgment when posting in the forums--revealing personal information such as your e-mail address, telephone number, and address is not recommended.&quot; Bob

(your list included both agp and pci-e.) your motherboard's manual/website will tell you this or you can download CPU-Z from here: http://www.cpuid.com/cpuz.php next, you need to set a budget. pci-e versions of radeon x1650xt and geforce 7600gt should run you about 75 while a geforce 8600gt will be around 85. agp versions are a bit more expensive. all of the above cards should work fine with most pcs. but if you have a slimline pc you may need a &quot;low profile&quot; card which can be harder to find. if your power supply is less than 300w you'll also need a more powerful replacement.

2102	4	252565	2517127	2517111	sunlord_clave	6/18/07 4:34 AM	1.18214124E12	Hmm..	Actually, hang on. How do I find out if my graphic card slot is a PCI or PCI-express? My graphic card is a ATI Radeon XPRESS 200 series (0x5A61)
2102	5	252565	2517150	2517127	R. Proffitt	6/18/07 4:45 AM	1.1821419E12	Can't tell yet.	Does your machine have a Make and Model? Share that. Bob
2102	6	252565	2517116	2517150	sunlord_clave	6/18/07 4:49 AM	1.18214214E12	....	It is an E-system Ei-302.
2102	7	252565	2517117	2517116	sunlord_clave	6/18/07 4:50 AM	1.1821422E12	Sorry..	Ei-system e302.
2102	8	252565	2517160	2517117	R. Proffitt	6/18/07 5:05 AM	1.1821431E12	Is this a Packard Bell?	Sorry but you have the machine so only you can tell. In fact, let's save me having to hunt it down and here's what I need you to do. -&gt; Reply with a link to the maker's web page on the machine. Bob
2102	9	252565	2517165	2517160	sunlord_clave	6/18/07 5:10 AM	1.1821434E12	Its not a packard bell, its an Ei-system.....!	They haven't got a homepage but this is kinda what my PC is - http://www.pcworld.co.uk/martprd/product/seo/686385 It says on there that it has 2 PCI slots but I'm not sure its the same as my PC because mine has a different graphic card.
2102	10	252565	2517180	2517165	R. Proffitt	6/18/07 5:13 AM	1.18214358E12	Then you have to open it up.	I can't find the maker's web site so here's a link with pictures for the various slot types. http://www.buildyourown.org.uk/pc-building/fitting/adapter-cards/ You can use google.com to find bigger pictures of each slot type but there should not be an ISA slot so don't bother with that one.

Here's a pic of my motherboard, what do you think? http://img368.imageshack.us/my.php?image=image098ah4.jpg The two white ones are standard PCI slots right? I'm hoping against hope the long black one at the top is a PCI express slot.
2102	12	252565	2517355	2517324	R. Proffitt	6/18/07 8:41 AM	1.18215606E12	I spy...	2 white PCI slots. I can't make out if that's a PCI 1X slot then above that is a blury slot and I can't tell is that's a PCIe slot. -&gt; The FOXCONN is the motherboard make so there is hope to identify the motherboard but your shot was too blurred for me to read it. Look up FREE EVEREST and see if it or BELARC ADVISOR reports the motherboard model. Bob
2102	13	252565	2517326	2517355	sunlord_clave	6/18/07 8:47 AM	1.18215642E12	Hang on...	...Let me get a better pic. Thanks for your help by the way!
2102	14	252565	2517362	2517355	R. Proffitt	6/18/07 8:53 AM	1.18215678E12	Why take a pic? You can googlecom that picture.	You can find online pictures of PCIe slots to compare with yours. But the real work you need to do is to identify that mainboard. Try the tools I just mentioned. Bob
2102	15	252565	2517328	2515615	sunlord_clave	6/18/07 8:57 AM	1.18215702E12	Er....	Is this any better? http://img129.imageshack.us/my.php?image=image0991tz9.jpg And I have tried downloading other 'System info' programs, none of them really gave me the info I needed. I will check out the programs you mentioned.

2102	17	252565	2517363	2517328	R. Proffitt	6/18/07 9:02 AM	1.18215732E12	Links..	http://images.google.com/images?um=1&tab=wi&hl=en&q=pcie Compare but that looks like a PCIe 1x and then a 16x slot. Bob
2102	18	252565	2517423	2517363	sunlord_clave	6/18/07 10:35 AM	1.1821629E12	foxconn	I haven't done a Belarc advisor scan yet (PC is busy) but it certainly looks like its this doesn't it: http://www.foxconnchannel.com/Product/motherboard_detail.aspx?ID=en-us0000240 Hurray, if it is!
