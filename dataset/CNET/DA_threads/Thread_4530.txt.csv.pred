1.1.1	For my Vista PC .	St
1.1.2	At the moment I have the Sound Blaster Live 24 installed ... On my XP Machine , it works great .	St
1.1.3	It comes with a Suite of Audio Software that all works ...	St
1.1.4	But not so on my Vista Machine .	St
1.1.5	It installs , but not properly and few of the features are available to use .	St
1.1.6	I think it 's a vista driver issue , but their website offers no relief .	St
1.1.7	I 'm peed off and would like to say goodbye to Creative and hello to some other replacement .	St
1.1.8	Thanks for any suggestions ...	Ques
1.2.1	Vista itself is riddled with bugs so you should expect the hardware drivers for vista to be even buggier than the OS itself , creative are the largest mainstream sound chip manufacturers for PC 's .	St
1.2.2	If the creative drivers dont get along with vista dont expect vista to play nicely with anyone else .	St
1.2.3	Yet another poor sucker that fell victim to microsoft marketing .	St
1.2.4	My advice , switch back to XP for 12 months until vista becomes a little less microsofty .	St
1.3.1	Thanks , I kinda expected to hear that .	St
1.3.2	I recently d/loaded a new driver for vista 32 from The Guru of 3D site .	St
1.3.3	It does allow a few of the Progs to work but not all .	St
1.3.4	Particularly the one I wanted most , The Player/Recorder .	St
1.3.5	It has the record & quot ; What-U-Hear & quot ; setting , and is pretty useful ...	St
1.3.6	It does show , but with no recording abilities .	St
1.3.7	I have it installed on my XP machine , and it runs well .	St
1.3.8	Thanks ...	Polite
1.4.1	except creative .	St
1.4.2	vista eliminated the hardware abstraction layer that most all sound cards depended on so you wind up with only the generic sound support built-into vista .	St
1.4.3	you 'll need to get an audigy x-fi if you want all of the bells and whistles you were accustomed to in xp .	St
1.4.4	creative is releasing better drivers for older cards like the audigy and live series , but their mostly for game support and wo n't give you the full feature set .	St
1.5.1	Vista has uncovered how lazy/immobile Creative and many other vendors are .	St
1.5.2	And such as MS 's bad press these days that it becomes their fault .	St
1.5.3	As the second reply to your post points out , the audio subsystem received a major overhaul ( mostly for the better ) in Vista , yet the vast majority of the vendors still do n't support it properly .	St
1.5.4	It is a major job to be sure but they 've known about the changes for ages .	St
1.5.5	Suffice it to say that older soundcards wo n't be supported with Vista from virtually anyone , and expect only whatever was available just before Vista launch to be supported .	St
1.5.6	You should be pretty safe with X-Fi cards as far as driver support in Vista is concerned .	St
1.5.7	It 's not complete now , but they should have it sorted out in a while .	St
