1.1.1	I have a small company which has separate computers for internet use and other computers for work use .	St
1.1.2	Currently all have access to the internet and the network I would like to limit those computers for internet for internet and the others for network only .	St
1.1.3	Very occassionally we would need remote access to these networked computers .	St
1.1.4	Is there some sort of router or device that I can put between our high speed modem and the rest of the network to control which pc get internet and which computer gets network access .	St
1.1.5	No I do n't want seperate networks this would be way to hard to maintain .	St
1.1.6	Especially for updates etc .	St
1.2.1	I could install a filter that denied such in the router for a specific PC .	St
1.2.2	Not that I 'll duplicate the manual but in the router you reserve IP addresses for those machines that need blocking ( so we can use DHCP ) then for those IPs we block sites outside our LAN .	St
1.2.3	- & gt ; Your IT staffer should be able to do this .	St
1.2.4	If not , talk to HR on how to replace them .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thank you for your help I will definately look into that .	St
1.4.1	By accessing the IP and then adding filter to the computers which are to be connected to the internet you can get solution .	St
1.4.2	Your network support services provider main role comes here and I think he can easily filter the IP address .	St
1.4.3	Concern your Network support service provider .	St
