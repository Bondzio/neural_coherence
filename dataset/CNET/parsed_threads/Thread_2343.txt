<s> Would anybody out there know if the Gateway E4100 will accept an aftermarket powersupply upgrade? </s>
<s> This unit comes with a 250 watt supply and Gateway only has an upgrade to 350watts. </s>
<s> I have been advised that in order to install a new AGP video card, such as a 7600 or X1650, that I'll need a 450 watt supply. </s>
<s> Gateway won't tell me so I thought one of you might know. </s>
<s> The ccase is a mid-tower ATX style. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> It's 0032602473 </s>
<s> Thought I might be able to help with this site but I see no number that even resembles the GATEWAY PN you provided. </s>
<s> Might double check and see if you see it. </s>
