I just replaced a hard drive in a compaq desktop, loaded xp home, and now dont have sound, or recognition of the wireless (on board) card that was operating prior to drive replacement. Downloaded original drivers for wireless card and sound and mb.. etc, and when i go to install them, error message says that &quot;c&quot; drive has no memory, (&quot;c&quot; drive now shows as a removable drive, and the OS is on &quot;H&quot; drive). only have one hard drive. 1.Did I make a mistake on original installation of OS (drive/partition choice) when installing windows? 2. Do I reinstall/format the OS and look for the &quot;C&quot; drive? 3. How can I reassign where drivers are installed? (tried to re-name primary drive from H to C, and windows wouldnt let me. 4. Is this something I can do in DOS? Thanks so much for any help! Rick:confused:

I do have the old drive still, and an enclosure I can recover old data from the folders. should I copy all drivers and try and paste into the new H drive? what folders do i retrieve?

We can clone (copy) a drive, we can copy files but drivers have more than files with registry entries and more. Its good you tried but why not clone the drive next time?

Is it still possible to &quot;clone&quot; the old drive if i get it mounted in an enclosure? how do i go about doing that??

Only have the CD drive and Hard drive connected when installing windows. But you still need to re-install windows if you don't wish to clone your original hard drive. A good cloning program is Paragon Drive Copy - you can get a trial version of the internet - many computer magazines offer such programs in a CD/DVD off the shelf for less than 5 - that's also an option.
