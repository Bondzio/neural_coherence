I went back in to delete everything I don't need backed up and it appears I have to delete each file one by one (which will take a long time). Is there a way delete entire folders? Thanks.

If it's all combined in one Windows file, can't you delete that and start all over. This is one of the risks of using proprietary backup software. It might use a proprietary lay-out for the data that it backs up, so the usual Windows tools don't work on it. Your choice to use it. Kees

I like having a backup of my files in case I lose something and an entire system backup in case my HD takes a dump. Thanks.
