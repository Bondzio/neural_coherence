More than likely it is some form of console cable. Etherent and USB are totally different, it needs much more electronics than just wire to make it work. There are a couple of types of cross cables but for 10/100 the wires in pins 1&2 is swapped with the ones in 3&6. A way that works most the time is to look at the color of the wires on left side of the connector. Generally they will be orange on one end and green on the other if you have a cross cable. They will be the same color on each end if you have a straight.
