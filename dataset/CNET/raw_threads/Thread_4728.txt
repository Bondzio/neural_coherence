It happens without a regular time interval. I tried to check the current running processes which may cause my PC to attain a 100% PC Usage without any avail. When it happens, it just turns my monitor blank. I have to shake the mouse to activate my running programs. Can anyone tell me what are the possible causes for the PC to have an unwanted behaviour? I am running on a Windows 200 system, 80GB HD and 256MB memory. It has both a DVD burner and CD burner (2-separate devices). Processor: x86 Family 6 AMD

Although you might have your Power Management area set to not go into Standby or Hibernation, some keyboard software that gets installed with way cool keyboards also have a setting in there somewhere that either uses a hotkey by default that needs to be disabled for that feature or has separate keys on the keyboard for Power, Sleep, and WakeUp and you might be accidently bumping the key activating the feature. I never installed any of my software for my keyboard, but found by accident the other day that they are all functioning anyhow because in the middle of trying to bring the keyboard closer to me, I bumped the Power key and shut everything off.
