6180 got a slightly higher score in most it journal reviews.
perhaps, 400 mhz cpu of 6180 has better performance than 333 mhz cpu of 6130. based on macreview, phaser 6180 may be worth to invest for your business for better performance and picture quality.
however, updated version of phaser printers cost much more than previous versions.
because both hp and xerox reduced their toner capacity from up to 10000 pages (eg phaser 740) to 2000 pages (phaser 6130 & 6180), you need to pay $350 for genuine toner set of 6180 and $300 for 6130 (2000 printing 5%).
for me, i have two old color laser jet printers: phaser 740 and hp color laserjet 4500. both printers are slow (~2.5 actual ppm color) and little bit noisy but the color qualities are as great as updated phasers and most of all, the price of consummables are extremely cheap in ebay (eg: fuser of hp 4500 costs less than $60 but you can print up to 100k with one fuser.
4 toner set of both hp4500 (6k pages) and phaser 740 (10k) are less than $100 at ebay.).
in conclusion, if you buy color laser printer first time, choose 6180, register your 1-yr warranty card, and learn how to manage color laser with free xerox as help.
better user management can increase printing capacity 500+ page more.
on the contrary, if you are experienced color laser printer user and do not want to pay for high cost consummables, check ebay or local craigslists and buy well maintained pre-owned color laser printer.
you can upgrade 128mb printer ram for $50 or less, and you can buy any part of phaser with small part of as fee.
