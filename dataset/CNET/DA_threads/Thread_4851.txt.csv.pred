1.1.3	!	St
1.1.4	!	St
1.1.5	This is my first topic on this forum .	St
1.1.6	I am newbie to this networking .	St
1.1.7	I really need your help you guys .	St
1.1.8	Recently , I bought D-Link DIR 300 Router for internet sharing .	St
1.1.9	The router is connected to my bro 's desktop which directly connects to internet through modem .	St
1.1.10	I share the internet through Wireless from my laptop .	St
1.1.11	Now we both wan na share files and stream videos .	St
1.1.12	Could anyone please tell me how to do this ?	Ques
1.1.13	?	Ques
1.2.1	The router needs to be plugged into the modem first .	St
1.2.2	Plug its WAN port into the modems Ethernet port .	St
1.2.3	Shut down and restart the modem so it will connect to it .	St
1.2.4	The router has 4 LAN ports + wireless capability .	St
1.2.5	You 'll share files through these connections and all the internet & quot ; sharing & quot ; will be done through the router as well .	St
1.2.6	Setting up file sharing is another topic but you 've got to get the wiring correct first .	St
1.3.1	My network works great , as far as the laptop connecting to the internet .	St
1.3.2	But I would like some input on setting up file sharing , as well as printing from the wireless laptop .	St
1.3.3	The PC is hard-wired to the modem and router ( D-LINK WBR-2310 ) .	St
1.3.4	The printer is connected to the PC .	St
1.3.5	The PC is running Windows XP .	St
1.3.6	The laptop is running Vista .	St
1.3.7	The printer is a Canon PIXMA MP450 .	St
1.3.8	Thanks .	Polite
1.4.1	your system but there are plenty of on line sources to help you sort things out .	St
1.4.2	Basically , you start with the PCs .	St
1.4.3	You enable print and file sharing for your network connection if it has n't been done so already .	St
1.4.4	You configure your local area connection as an exception in your Windows firewall .	St
1.4.5	I do n't know if you have third party firewalls but these may need to be visited too .	St
1.4.6	Then , you create & quot ; shares & quot ; on each PC which define what devices , folders , etc. , are to be shared .	St
1.4.7	If you want to share a folder , a right click on it should bring up the option to do so .	St
1.4.8	You need to decide who has access to the shares .	St
1.4.9	For home use you generally will define the same users on each PC that accesses the shares .	St
1.4.10	They need to have the same username and password .	St
1.4.11	As for your printer , and because you have two operating systems , you 'll need to have the proper driver on each PC .	St
1.5.1	I CREATED THE NETWORK BY STUDYING MICROSOFT AND D-LINK HELP FILES .	St
1.5.2	HOWEVER , I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR REPLIES .	St
1.5.3	THANKS TO YOU ALL	St
