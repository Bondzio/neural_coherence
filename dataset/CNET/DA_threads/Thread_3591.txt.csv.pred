1.1.1	Trying to upgrade boot drive ( 80GB ) to 100GB ( both Western Digital ) have partitioned and set active , formated NTFS .	St
1.1.2	Have not had any luck transfering to new drive .	St
1.1.3	Tried using & quot ; Data Lifeguard Tools & quot ; no go.. tried & quot ; PartitionMagic & quot ; would n't work also tried to use & quot ; Drive Image & quot ; 100GB drive has been working as a slave in computer .	St
1.1.4	Added larger drive for backup want to use 100GB for os .	St
1.1.5	Tried using Recovery Console now every time I try to boot off drive computer goes so far and reboots..	St
1.2.1	You 're right .	Res
1.2.2	Partition Magic is not a system transfer utility but I am curious as to why your Drive Image program did not work .	St
1.2.3	First , you need a version that supports XP w/NTFS and I believe this means 5 or above .	St
1.2.4	You do n't use the image function but the drive copy function of the program .	St
1.2.5	Since I have used this many , many times with and without success , I would be curious as to what went wrong and , if you still have the 80 gig drive in tact , maybe try again .	St
1.2.6	Now , if you did not override the default to hide the original partition of the drive you are copying from , you can not use it without reversing this .	St
1.2.7	You do not partition and format a drive before using drive copy from Drive Image .	St
1.2.8	Next , it seems you got something transfered and tried to use the recovery console but it sounds as if you 'd be better off doing a repair install .	St
1.2.9	The rebooting behavior can occur if you 've breached the hardware change limit and a repair installation / reactivation can fix this .	St
1.2.10	Good luck .	Polite
