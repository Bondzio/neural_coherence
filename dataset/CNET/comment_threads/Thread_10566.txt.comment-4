That I've seen where it can make a difference.
Lots of pundits out there but I'm sticking to what I think are nice enough machines.
Here's my short list for gaming today.
1.
Dual core or better.
2.
2 to more GB RAM.
3.
A current OS.
4.
Cards over the 100 buck mark from this list -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gtx-radeon,2151.html Having said that, my game rig is a paltry dual core 2+GHz, ATI 3850, XP SP3, etc.
Still nice enough but I'm not an avid gamer.
