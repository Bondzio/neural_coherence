1.2.1	& quot ; So this same 30 GB hard disk is 30,000 MB in decimal terms .	St
1.2.2	But its 27.94 binary gigabytes are equal to 28,610 binary megabytes ( 27.94 times 1,024 ) . & quot ; http : //keppanet.netfirms.com/keppanet/supports/harddisk.htm Nothing to fix here .	St
1.2.3	It 's something that takes awhile to sink in .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Robert did n't quite fill in the full calculation If you see 28GB you need to do this calculation 28*1024*1024*1024 That equals 30GB , exactly what you are supposed to have .	St
