what makes yourPower Supply an ATX 12 V. The 4 pin is the 12 volt power plug that many mobos use to power the CPU now.
[older mobos used the 5 volts or 3.3 volt connector] It's a mobo issue not a CPU issue.
A given CPU can be fed from the 4 pin 12 volt on a newer mobo and work without such a connector on a mobo not set up for that connector.
Had you plugged that in to the viseo card you would have fried video card for dinner.
Yellow wires are normally 12 volts [of course black wires are grounds / returns].
I might guess that the Greeen is for 3.3 volts, HOWEVER 3.3 volts is normally Orange.
The only green wire in the standard is the PS-ON lead on pin 14 of the 20 pin connector or pin 16 of the 24 pin connector.
Check with HP before plugging anything in.
