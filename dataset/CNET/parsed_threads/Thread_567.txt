<s> I was thinking about installing a Radeon X1600 PRO 512MB PCI Express video card. </s>
<s> Does anyone have this card or have first hand experience that knows how good the graphics are. </s>
<s> I want to be able to play games like Rome total war and the upcoming Medieval total war 2 on high settings. </s>
<s> Or is there a better card that I should be looking at? </s>
<s> I am getting a 400 watt power supply, have a pentium 4 processor and not afraid of spending some money, if it gets me what I want. </s>
<s> -Thanks </s>
<s> Or is there a better card that I should be looking at? </s>
<s> nVidia 7600GT. </s>
<s> The 512MB VRAM on the X1600Pro doesn't make a difference in performance; it's just for marketing. </s>
<s> The 7600GT SLAUGHTERS the X1600Pro AND the more expensive X1600XT. </s>
<s> You can get an eVGA 7600GT for $135 on newegg. </s>
<s> I am getting a 400 watt power supply What brand and model is that power supply? </s>
<s> and not afraid of spending some money How much are you willing to spend? </s>
<s> Also, what's the rest of your computer specs? </s>
<s> I ordered a hp 400 watt micro-atx power supply from HP. </s>
<s> I'm not sure of the model I would be willing to spend up to $ 300 if it is an outstanding video card (yeah, I know the best ones cost like $ 500 but I don't have the power supply for it) What other specs would you need? </s>
<s> I ordered a hp 400 watt micro-atx power supply from HP. </s>
<s> What are the amps on the 12V rail of that PSU? </s>
<s> The 12V rail powers the CPU, video card, motherboard, and some other important stuff, so you want to have at least 20A on the 12V rail. </s>
<s> The more amps, the more power that can be delivered to the devices that it's powering. </s>
<s> IE: If the PSU has 10A on the 12V rail, you multiply 10x12, and get 120. </s>
<s> That means that 120 watts are available for all the devices powered by the 12V rail. </s>
<s> A single high-end video card can use more than 100 watts of power, so you get the message. </s>
<s> I contacted HP, they said it has 1.5 amps on the 12V rail, I;m going to cancel that order. </s>
<s> They also said that installing a PSU with more than 1.5 amp would damage my mother board and that all HPs are give 1.5 amps on the 12v rail. </s>
<s> Apparently it's impossible to upgrade my computer cause i've been doing this for about 2 weeks and still nothing. </s>
<s> 1.5 amps? </s>
<s> Whoever gave you that info must be wrong because you can't even run a computer with 1.5 amps on the 12V rail. </s>
<s> My computer came from HP with a 300W power supply with 19A on the 12V rail. </s>
<s> It was powering a Pentium 4, one hard drive, two DVD drives, and a Radeon X600. </s>
<s> HP gave you the wrong information; don't cancel the order; just look at the sticker on the PSU when you receive it. </s>
<s> did you upgrade your power suppy and or video card? </s>
<s> I'm having the most difficult time tracking down micro-atx power supplies above 300 watts. </s>
<s> HP is really starting to **** me off, the keep giving me wrong info. </s>
<s> Is there any good graphics card that could just run on my current specs. </s>
<s> ? </s>
