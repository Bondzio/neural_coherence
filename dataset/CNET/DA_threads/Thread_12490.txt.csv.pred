1.1.8	All my settings are as they were on the Vista PC and the XP systems.	St
1.1.9	Sharing is on, etc, etc.	St
1.1.10	It's absolutly infuriating that I lost functionality after a supposed &quot;fix.&quot; Anyone else running into this problem??	St
1.1.11	?	Ques
1.2.1	Check my account on each machine.	St
1.2.2	For me it's &quot;bob&quot; and then I see if &quot;bob&quot; can access the files locally and then across the network.	St
