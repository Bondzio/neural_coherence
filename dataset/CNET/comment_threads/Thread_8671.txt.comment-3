But if you're asking if you'll need to upgrade your Macbook to run Leopard, other than maxing out on RAM, the answer is likely no.
While Windows machines are usually seen as lacking or requiring a hardware rebuild with a new OS, as long as your mac is running the processor de jour, i.e.
intel, you'll likely be able to function with the newest Mac OS for years to come.
My bet is that they will likely support the G4/G5 processors for a good bit longer.
My employer still has us all using OS 9 (yikes!)
and is only now considering moving us all to OS X since we can no longer get copies of Quark 4.1.
