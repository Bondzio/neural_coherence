After fixing too many multiple rail systems (re-jigger power connections) I am now a fan of the single rail PSU when ever possible.
One less thing for the builder to get wrong.
And half the work in those jobs was to give a short course in power supplies.
I don't know which was harder, the machine repair or explaining why we didn't replace parts and why.
