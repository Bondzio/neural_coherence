I wish to fill the remaining two slots. I see a deal at Mwave.com and want to know if I can use them. Their 512mb modules say PC24200 533MHZ CL4 240-PIN DDR2 DIMM. Is the only important part the PC2 4200? The price is right and the maker is Kingston who I trust.

Newegg also good selection and pricing ... worth checking there too once you know exactly what you want. Let us know what you get and how it works. VAPCMD PS...Might be a good opportunity to clear out the dust bunnies too.
