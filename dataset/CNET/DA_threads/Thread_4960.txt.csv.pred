1.1.1	Hi , I 'm interested in buying either the 19 & quot ; or 17 & quot ; LG LCD Monitor on page 17 , of todays Best Buy circular .	St
1.1.2	Model # L1933TR-SF or L1733TR-SF .	St
1.1.3	Prices are $ 229 and $ 199 respectfully .	St
1.1.4	I can not find a review of these monitors , and they do n't seem to be listed on the LG web site .	St
1.1.5	Are they too old or too new to be listed ?	Ques
1.1.6	Both monitors have the same specs ( only the size differs ) .	St
1.1.7	I was once told that 19 & quot ; s are 'grainy ' compared to 17 & quot ; models .	St
1.1.8	They both have the same screen resolution also ( if that matters ) .	St
1.1.9	Any advice as to which one to get , or are they bad monitors .	St
1.1.10	Thanks , Tom .	St
1.2.1	While I could not find a review of either display , I did find product page for the 19 & quot ; model on their Canadian website ... click here .	St
1.2.2	It is also primarily sold in Canadian stores , though Best Buy is debuting it here in the states .	St
1.2.3	The 17 & quot ; is from the same product line , so the information likely holds true for it as well .	St
1.2.4	Aside from that , I can tell you that they are both new models , with product pages being created about a month ago , and both have been certified to handle Windows Vista .	St
1.2.5	Thus , it may be a little while before full reviews and users opinions are available .	St
1.2.6	Overall LG tends to hover around a 6/10 when it comes to LCD monitors and televisions reviewed by the Cnet editors .	St
1.2.7	One thing you may consider doing is visiting a local Best buy or other electronics store and viewing it for yourself ... the sales associates usually have display models they can plug in for you to look at .	St
1.2.8	I have n't noticed a drop in quality with 19 & quot ; LCDs , but if there is you 'll be able to spot it before you buy .	St
1.2.9	Hope this helps , John	St

1.4.1	Hi , I am writing this note on L1933TR .	St
1.4.2	I bought it 2 days ago .	St
1.4.3	So far I like it .	St
1.4.4	No dead pixels .	St
1.4.5	Black color is really black ! ! !	St
1.4.6	LCD backlight is perfectly even .	St
1.4.7	After I adjusted color settings , colors are almost perfect .	St
1.4.8	No ghosting .	St
1.4.9	At the beginning I was not sure what to buy - L1933TR or L1900R .	St
1.4.10	However since I do not see difference between specifications and I do not like design of L1900R I decided to buy L1933TR .	St
1.4.11	And I have no regrets I will also repeat advice from previous reply - go to store and compare quality yourself .	St
1.4.12	( Only remember that default settings are not necessarily are the best ... ) Alex	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
