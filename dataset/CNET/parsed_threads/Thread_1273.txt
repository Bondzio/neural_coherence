<s> I store my mp3 music in the windows media library. </s>
<s> When a copy a selected mp3 piece of music and copy it to my external hard drive I think it looses its properties. </s>
<s> The mp3 icon is missing and if I bring it back to my library it wont play. </s>
<s> Please advise. </s>
<s> Try saving it to another location, my documents or my music and see what result you get, should be able to do that without issue. </s>
<s> Some properties are lost if the external hard drive is in FAT32 format. </s>
<s> Fix? </s>
<s> Convert it to NTFS and try again. </s>
