1.1.1	Recently I bought a new syste which I asembled myself and after the reboot from installing the video card drivers, the screen remains blank and the monitor loses its signal from the computer.	St
1.1.2	I thinbk that this might be some sort of driver conflict but am not sure.	St
1.1.3	Can anyone offer some advice as how to fix is problem?	Ques
1.1.4	p.s.	St
1.1.5	i am currently running the defult vga drivers.	St
1.1.6	Thanx, Cameron	St
1.2.1	I also can only run on standard vga.	St
1.2.2	the card is running on an ABIT fatality mainboard AA8XE Sys: p4 3.8 1gig DDR2 @675mhz win xp home with sp2 160gig SATA bassically if i install the drivers from the cd that came with the card, the system boots up but then the hole system locks up and the screen goes off (blank).	St
1.2.3	sometimes i can get into windows, but again as soon as i try and do anything with the mouse (cliking START for instance) the same occurs.	St
1.2.4	I have reflashed BIOS with the latest from ABIT and have upto date DxD.	St
1.3.1	I too am having problems with the drivers that came with my card .Let me know how you resolve your sissue I will do the same.	St
1.3.2	Mike	St
1.4.1	I posted elsewhere but I had a X700 brandnew and it kept loosing my vedio signal drove me nuts still not sure if I have it right but I reinstalled the 5.2 catalyst and the bios and the motherboard for a 775 chipset so far everything is going well but I haven't stressed the system yet as that could be a sure way to get my monitor to go on and off again,same driver I believe lots of issues with different boards in doing my research, I thought going to a 850 or some other PCI express vedio might solve my problem as they have a seperate powersupply, geuss not.
