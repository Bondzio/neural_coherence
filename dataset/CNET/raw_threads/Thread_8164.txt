As indicated on the following diagram: http://www.keyboardmag.com/pop-up.aspx?content_id=29104&section_code=1 This piece of equipment has a slot for a flash adaptor. I am unsure of what exactly I need to purchase, or what I SHOULD purchase. I was wondering if someone could point me to a website that sells exactly what I need and that ships to the US.

Look and see if there are 4 gold electrical connectors inside. If so, it's a flash drive adapter that would allow you to upload/download to and from it. What you'd be transferring I can't say...your own creations or someone else's probably, pre-sets, etc. This should be somewhere in the instruction manual.

In that vein you can then find that adapter and then use the more common &quot;flash memory&quot; you like and as flash memory varies maybe multiple kinds. It would have better if Roland settled on a USB port which far more generic. Maybe, it was intended for a &quot;ethernet&quot; connection via the PMCIA slot to dump data(music), etc. to a PC/laptop. I would think that the manual offers suggestions or details on that port use. tada -----Willy

The only say &quot;PC card slot&quot; that can use CompactFlash or SmartMedia using a &quot;Commerically available adaptor.&quot; pg 178 is the only section that has information I can see about it. You're all welcome to take a look. http://www.roland.com/products/en/_support/om.cfm?iCncd=1069&ln=EN&SearchBy=RcId&dst=P&iRcId=0000008921&dsp=1 I haven't bought the flash card yet, so it doesn't matter which adaptor I get. I'd like to use the dominate format, but at this point I just want to get the stupid adaptor.

That means, it will accept the same cards found for laptops(older PCMIA), further you get one that accepts flash data cards on the adpater. That way you dump your music files/chords, etc. to be saved. In all likelihood don't get a flash card bigger than 2gb(guessing), but if you get an adapter any similar smaller Mb/Gb data capacity will work to test it. So look at laptop PCMIA adapters that provide flash ports on the adapter. Just visit any decent online laptop website to get an idea of adapters out there. try here: http://www.newegg.com tada -----Willy http://www.roland.com/products/en/JUNO-G/specs.html

Its noteworthy the comments, buyers made of that adapter. It probably a cheap unit, so take that into account. Remember, you still need the flash card for data storage. enjoy -----Willy
