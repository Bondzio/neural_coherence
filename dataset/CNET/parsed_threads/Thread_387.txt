<s> hello I am looking for a cheap NAS for our firm. </s>

<s> What do you think about this solutions?? </s>
<s> Anyone use this NAS??? </s>
<s> --- Best Regards, Halemb </s>
<s> At the end of the equation, NAS is Network Attached Storage. </s>
<s> In no system I've seen have they escaped the need for a host CPU or OS. </s>
<s> As such, we often can take a simple Linux install and make it work as a NAS. </s>
<s> Cheers, Bob </s>
