hi, bob.
thanks for the reply.
i did clear the queue (cancel the document) manually.
upon doing so i noted that the printer status window still showed that there was &quot;1&quot; document, although none listed in the queue.
it appears to me that the os is creating something that is put &quot;first in line&quot; before my document ultimately, my document never printed from the laptop.
(no problems printing from the desktop) i hope my attempt at this clarification is helpful.
thanks again.
