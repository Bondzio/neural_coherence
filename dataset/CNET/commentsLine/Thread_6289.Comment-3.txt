i had a similar problem last week and i think i fixed it.
i changed the channel my network was operating on (i believe the default is 11).
i went into the wireless configuration screen and changed it.
after that it seemed to work fine, again.
i think a neighbour with a more powerful router might have been interfering with my signal.
hope that solves the problem.
