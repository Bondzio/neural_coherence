enable AGP as the first video search.
it shouldn't help anything.
it just tells the system during the boot to search for an AGP &quot;card&quot; rather than waste time [milliseconds] looking for a PCI card.
once the AGP card is &quot;found&quot; you are running from the AGP slot.
ATI drivers can give one fits.
I can't help you there.
