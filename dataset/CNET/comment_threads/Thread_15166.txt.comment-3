Hello Kaenash.
Acronis True Image creates an exact image of everything on the PC, every file, every registry setting, every save game on every installed application, just as it is.
You can restore this image at any time, so you'll get everything back as it is when you create the image.
Acronis has a secure zone it's a hidden partition where you can keep the imagies.
But you may not use is, if you want.
True Image has a high level compression option so if you make a backup from 160 GB the image file will be much smaller.
If you use an external HDD, you can create a bootable media CD, boot from it and restore the image from an external HDD.
At least if you need to upgrade to another HDD, you'll be able to restore the image on a new drive.
