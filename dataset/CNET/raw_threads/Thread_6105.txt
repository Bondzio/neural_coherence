I'm having a hard time deciding which route to go this time for the first time. I was at first going to upgrade my system to one using a 925X motherboard w/PCI-e, but it seems most of the reviews I've read, the Socket 775 processors do not perform as expected and tend to run hot to boot! I was then thinking about waiting for the nForce4 motherboards that run on the AMD 64 platform w/ PCI-e support. Is either of these platforms an option? Or is there something better? I currently have a system with a Asus P4PE 845 motherboard, a P4 2.53 processor with 512 meg of DDR PC2700 memory. One of the reasons I want to upgrade is so I can run a better AGP card than what I have now (mine can run only a 4x slot card. Thanks for any advise any of you can offer.

Gigabyte may be the latest to come out. If gaming is your thing, AMD still wins hands down.
