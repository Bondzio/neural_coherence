<s> I am hoping that the Cnet community can help me out with this strange problem. </s>
<s> I have a 1st generation Macbook. </s>
<s> Every so often, usually after first turning the system on, waking from sleep, or high CPU loads; the screen brightness flickers. </s>
<s> The screen doesn't go completely blank, it goes from bright to dim back to normal brightness over the course of 3 to 5 seconds. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, even though this problem is widely reported on Apple's support forums, Apple does not acknowledge that this is an issue. </s>
<s> I am on the fence as to whether or not I should call AppleCare. </s>
<s> I don't know if this will be covered by my warranty and if not I cannot afford to have it repaired. </s>
<s> It is becoming rather annoying. </s>
<s> If anyone out there has had this problem, do you have any workarounds for this? </s>
<s> Or should I call AppleCare? </s>
<s> Every day you delay lodging your issue and getting a case number is another day gone. </s>
<s> I find it best to resolve or lodge the complaint within hours of unpacking the machine. </s>
