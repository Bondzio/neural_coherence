We had a lightning strike close by a few weeks ago and everything is plugged into a surge protector that shows it is working properly with no damaged. My printer has a constant buzzing when plugged in now (I think it is shot). Anyway, since then my monitor works and my computer boots up, but the mouse and keyboard were not working (wireless) and I could not log into my account in XP Pro. I grabbed my son's wired mouse and keyboard to use for the computer and they don't work either. I have tried every USB port on the computer (Dell Precision), which has 2 in front and at least 6 in the back, and they don't work as well. The mouse shows lit up on the bottom and the keyboard lights go on when I first plug it into the port, but go off after 1-2 seconds. The USBs in the front give enough power that the external hard drive lights are on when computer goes on and the card reader light is on as well. Can someone please help me and let me know what the problem is. I want the info off of the hard drive at the least, but would like to have the desktop working. Thanks in advance, Steven

Basically, you really can't fix it and/or a simple solution. You swap and/or replace parts until it works. I suggest you remove the current HD as a safeguard. Mount a spare or borrow HD and be sure it works. Then do an install of the OS and be sure all is well. If the USB ports don't work then, bad mtrbd., etc.. If not and it seems to work as in everything does what it supposedly does, then mount the old HD and swap data over. Hopefully, you can continue from there if a new HD. If borrowed, get a new HD and repeat process. Otherwise, think new system or another PC, because by the time you fix it, it maybe another new system anyways. I suggest the above as possible attempts at fixing the HD or in that direction may corrupt the data and you lose it. You can also mount the old HD in a ext. USB enclosure and using another PC, get data and burn to discs. tada -----Willy

(Mine has a $$$ replacement/repair warranty on attached devices. (2) You stated the CPU boots, but you have no control. HD works. The motherboard has a problem. (3) Do you have a spare slot, and can invest less than $20? If so, get or borrow a USB 2.0 card, and see if that works. Your system is booting: PSU, Video card, and hard drive are working. It's the USB and serial ports that are out.
