the reason that you shouldn't defrag an ssd is not because it doesn't help, it is only because it uses up a lot of write cycles.
some people think it either doesn't work on ssds but that isn't completely true.
defragging has little to do with the hardware itself.
it is really an ntfs issue.
if your files are split among non-sequential clusters, you are guaranteed a multiple read or right operation (clusters = ms ntfs term).
defrags used to be really beneficial back in the days of the old mfm disks.
even so, what you received from dos or windows was still dealing with clusters.
i had a third-party defragger that used cylinder alignment to really improve speed but, starting in the days of the ide drive where sectors could be relocated anywhere, that sort of defragging lost a lot of its luster.
with ssd, even if you have to do two or three i/os to read a small file, so what.
i personally think that the write cycle issue is more important then squeezing out a little bit of extra speed by defragging, but it is whatever works for you.
