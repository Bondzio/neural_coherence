The problem is, When i go to the website to download an update, I just get a .cap file. I've tried updating it with that file but EZ Flash says no. So i was on the look out for a .cap to .rom converter, turns out that is what i needed and they gave a list to all of their converters but none was for my model of MOBO (which is a M5A99X EVO R2.0) Please help with this, I've been at it for at least 4 hours and i have had no luck with any other forums. Thank you in advance.

These sort of updates are treacherous so I rarely write how to do them. I must defer to the maker. I will quote the maker's instructions but in this case, please supply a link so I can check it out and see if there is more. Bob

I updated a motherboard 2 or 3 years ago and there was none of this &quot;.cap file&quot; stuff. Also, I'm running windows 64 bit, that probably doesn't make a difference though.

Under BIOS Tools I found at that link is a tool that reads: &quot;Bios Renamer for USB BIOS Flashback 1.Put Bios file and Bios renamer in same folder 2.Execute the Utility 3.Use new Bios file for USB BIOS Flashback.&quot;
6142	4	588727	5437955	5437962	Eyrl	3/17/13 9:06 AM	1.36351116E12	Thank you!	Thanks! i think i found it! do i just create a new folder, But the file and the renamer in it, then transfer the folder to my flash drive? Do i take the renamer out of the folder after i execute it? Again, Thank you! i think we're on to something here! I was confused because on the flash back tutorial they have, they didn't give me a link for my specific motherboard.
6142	5	588727	5437984	5437962	Eyrl	3/17/13 9:31 AM	1.36351266E12	Another thing...	One more thing, This link right here: ( http://event.asus.com/2012/mb/USB_BIOS_Flashback_GUIDE/ ) that has tutorial on how to use the flash back, They also link a .Cap to .Rom converter for those specific boards, Why doesn't mine have one? Or does it even need one?

Remember I can't help anyone do anything not documented and I hope you are not offended about that. Hope there tool fixed it up and you can move forward. Bob
6142	7	588727	5438002	5437984	R. Proffitt	3/17/13 10:11 AM	1.36351506E12	Sorry. I don't know.	After decades of seeing poor documentation I've grown a little accustomed to the lack of clarity. Right or wrong part of this has to do with how competitive the market is. It's all about price so for the price? Bob
6142	8	588727	5438112	5437984	bob b	3/17/13 2:23 PM	1.36353018E12	The manual	If you look in your manual they explain how to use the flash back feature. They tell you what to rename the file to. It looks like. Download the bios file.....zipped. Unzip the file. Rename the file. Copy the file to a usb stick.....note the restrictions about fat and partitions. Insert the usb stick in the proper port. Push the button.

On a video they have, it shows it's on a the back plate, but i cannot find it. https://mail-attachment.googleusercontent.com/attachment/u/0/?ui=2&ik=12d3a42412&view=att&th=13d7a5796e5fdd18&attid=0.1&disp=inline&safe=1&zw&saduie=AG9B_P84eUp1_OLIZOTqDmvpUP_k&sadet=1363557372765&sads=dk4vCVabzySMoQoVGafJMS0RXj4&sadssc=1

6142	11	588727	5438109	5438097	Eyrl	3/17/13 4:28 PM	1.36353768E12	Sorry!	Sorry about that, i usually do use photobucket, But i forgot my acount info and such, Anyway what do you mean? I have the flash back usb port, and there doesn't even seem to be a place for the button in the back panel. I've also tried using EZ flash but no dice. (sigh) Here's a working link: http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o750/Eyrl/photo_zpsa7054380.jpg

6142	13	588727	5438150	5438124	Eyrl	3/17/13 5:01 PM	1.36353966E12	Thanks!	ahhh i didn't see that! So it's inside, i was just going off the other models that supported flashback!
6142	14	588727	5438142	5438150	R. Proffitt	3/17/13 5:18 PM	1.36354068E12	Glad if it helped.	At they say, a second pair or eyes and hands can really make little jobs go much smoother. Now get out of my kitchen. Bob
6142	15	588727	5438143	5438142	Eyrl	3/17/13 6:54 PM	1.36354644E12	Light Stable?	So i opened up the case to press down the Flashback button, But the light blinks off and on (green) and then turns stable after two or three blinks, Anything i'm doing wrong? i don't have the file in a folder on my drive and i don't have any other files on it. What am i doing wrong?
6142	16	588727	5438144	5438142	Eyrl	3/17/13 7:00 PM	1.3635468E12	Another Question	Another thing, I'm going from revision number 04xx (can't remember the full number at the moment.) to 1503. Does skipping all the other updates affect anything?
6142	17	588727	5438159	5437904	R. Proffitt	3/17/13 7:15 PM	1.3635477E12	About bios versions.	That question is one that has been asked many times. While it's good to ask, be sure we are not repeating what thousands have asked before. So, my answer is -&gt; Install any version you want. It does not matter. Bob
6142	18	588727	5438524	5438159	Eyrl	3/18/13 5:11 PM	1.36362666E12	Light?	About about the light turning stable after only 2 or 3 flashes? I've tried everything, Even formatting it again to FAT32. I've also tried doing it with a different update, I really wish i could save $15 and not have to buy another bios chip, Then have to pay someone to put it in (because i have no idea how to) but that is looking like the route i'm forced to take.
6142	19	588727	5438527	5438524	R. Proffitt	3/18/13 5:20 PM	1.3636272E12	Sorry	But I don't own this model. My replies are using what I've learned over the years and decoding too many incomplete pages of information. I've never had to buy a BIOS chip in 2 decades so that would be a first. About the only thing I can add about USB updates is that we should always have a 1 or 2GB stick laying around for such work. Bob
6142	20	588727	5438954	5438527	Eyrl	3/19/13 9:46 PM	1.36372956E12	Thank You	Even if i don't get this working, Thank you, You have been a huge help. I really do hope i get this working soon. Maybe i'll contact customer support sometime this week. Again, Thank you very much for your time. These forums are such a help in times like these.
