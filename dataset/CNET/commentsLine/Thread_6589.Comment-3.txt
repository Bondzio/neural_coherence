thanks for the input, i'm still at a loss because i'd have to figure out this formatting issue on my pc, and i'm not sure that's possible from the research i've done.
in response, the mac is very new, it's some sort of a pro computer that i'm using finalcutpro on, so not only do i need my hard drive for memory but also to use as scratch disk space.
i'm not tech savvy at all, and i can't really try it out again because office depot told me that they made an exception, but there are no refunds on this item (just even exchanges).
so, unless i buy something online someplace else and wait and pay for shipping, then o.d.
is my only local option.
any additional input would be greatly appreciated.
i wish i were better at this stuff... marcy
