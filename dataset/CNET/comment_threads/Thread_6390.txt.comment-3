My description was probably a little confusing.
The desktop that is 80 feet away, and the X-box are hardwired with cat5 ethernet cable, as well as the desktop that is 3 feet away.
The X-box is approximately 25 feet away from the router.
Will there be a difference in response time based on the different factors?
( Distance, type of router, etc.. ) Thanks Dennis
