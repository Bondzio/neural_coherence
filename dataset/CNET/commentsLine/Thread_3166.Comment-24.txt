external hard drives do have a life expectancy, but they are much longer than an internal hard drive.
anything mechanical has moving parts.
eventually those moving will wear out.
just like the human body eventually gives out.
internal hd's have a shorter life simply because they perform more tasks and operations because they for the most part are intregal to the entire system rather than the external hd's that are primarily used for backing up system data.
backup's are not and every minute/sec occuring event, therefore prolonging it's life more so than internal hd's.
