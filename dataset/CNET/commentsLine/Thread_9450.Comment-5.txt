when you installed the drivers, let's hope you installed the right variety for the win7 you did install as 32 or 64-bit type.
while some 32-bit maybe accepted or seem so, these in turn cause issues when they're pushed or possibility the drivers aren't too keen as really ready.
so review all that, don't fall what was available on the os install alone, the drivers for the mtrbd.
maybe lacking for your needs, so a visit to the mtrbd.
website for what you need.
also, in some cases if you're dragging some old part into the mix, install the drivers from windows driver website, when prompted allow it to install from the www.
that one area i would check into as it maybe part of the overall siuues besides apsu one tada -----willy
