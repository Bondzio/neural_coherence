I currently use the built-in/integrated video card on my Dell 3.0-GHz computer for the display (I think it is called Intel Extreme Graphic, or something like that).
I do NOT play computer games, do some photo editing, watch DVDs sometimes, and just want my (LCD) monitor to display images/text to the best it can.
Would it make any difference in overall image quality (i.e.
colors, sharpness) if I used an add-on video card?
If it does, would a 64Mb or 128Mb make any more differences?
