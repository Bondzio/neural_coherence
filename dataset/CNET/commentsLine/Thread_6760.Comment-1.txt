the situation: i need to print to 640 printers on a single network.
i need to add these printers to my computer, and then print to them.
the printing should be as simultaneous as possible.
doing this by hand would obviously take forever, so i am open to third party apps (cheap), vbscripts (with instruction please), command prompts, or anything else that will work.
i've found programs to facilitate the &quot;printing&quot; part, i really am looking for suggestions on the &quot;adding&quot;.
all of the printers are tcp/ip.
any suggestions are greatly appreciated.
thanks!
you may be saving a small business!
