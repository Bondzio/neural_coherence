<s> I currently use S-Video to connect my Laptop to my LCD TV but found that I could get much better resolution using a borrowed VGA cable. </s>
<s> Neither my TV nor my laptop have DVI ports, so is a VGA cable the best choice for watching streaming movies or DVDs from my laptop DVD drive on my TV? </s>
<s> Can I attain HD picture quality through this connection? </s>
<s> Would I benefit from purchasing a VGA to HDMI converter like these: http://www.hdtvsupply.com/vgatohdco.html My graphics card is the stock Intel GMA X3100 capable of at least 1280x800 resolution (see specs below) - should I consider upgrading? </s>
<s> Also, what features (if any) should I look for in a VGA cable to get the best picture? </s>
<s> I went to an office supply store last night and found only cables that were for use with 17&quot; and smaller displays. </s>
<s> What's the difference between these and the cables that are used for larger displays? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>
<s> Hardware details below. </s>
<s> Sorry if some information is extraneous: Computer: Toshiba Satellite A205-S7458, Vista TV: Samsung LN46A630, 1080p, 40,000:1, 120Hz Video Card: Intel GMA X3100, Intel GM965 Chipset, 358MB Graphics Memory, displays 1280x800 on laptop (capable of more?) </s>
<s> Your video port/card is the final word on the specs it supports. </s>
<s> While a video port type determines it connectivity, the older the laptop the less likely a successful outcome. </s>
<s> Even, if you get it to work, the results maybe lackluster. </s>
<s> Plus, the adapter if found is just another cost and it too may introduce issues. </s>
<s> Most laptops don't provide any video upgrade other than ram, so don't expect to swap it out, UNLESS its capable(not likely). </s>
<s> As for HD quality, if the laptop ever offered it, yes, otherwise, no. </s>
<s> HD quality is also a ability of the DVD drive installed, if not HD capable won't have it. </s>
<s> For the time being since things change so much, this is the outcome I see for now. </s>
<s> good luck tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Ok, thanks Willy! </s>
<s> So for now you'd recommend just going with a regular VGA connection and maybe considering a laptop with a DVI/HDMI output for the future? </s>
<s> Is there anything I need to know about VGA cables? </s>
<s> What's the deal with the cable that claims that it's only for 17 inch and smaller displays? </s>
<s> Will it look distorted/pixelated on my 46&quot; and if so, what do I need to look for in a VGA cable? </s>
<s> the only question is what resolution your laptop can output. </s>
<s> it should be optimally be configured for 1920x1280. </s>
<s> other resolutions may be stretched and/or 'fuzzy'. </s>
<s> 1920x1280 shouldn't require any special cable. </s>
<s> just get a $10 cable from office depot or target, preferably with ferrite cores (the cylindrical bulges on both ends of the cable). </s>
<s> Alot goes on in a video cable, simple as it is. </s>
<s> The resistance or drop of signal lost on the distance can be lousy. </s>
<s> Cheaper cables offer too little when compared to pricier cables but cost saving. </s>
<s> It would be great if it works but there are times for whatever reason the display is plain no good. </s>
<s> The more info to cover a larger screen makes for a demanding link, so it pays to have better. </s>
<s> The simple video output of typical laptops won't always provide the best output but a capable one. </s>
<s> The more resolution deemed necessary the more likely of a display could be faltered by lacking componets. </s>
<s> One reason to review the specs of monitor, video source and cable and/or link as they should be within specs of each other on a &quot;native level&quot;. </s>
<s> Meaning, they compliment each other quite well w/o too fancy of setting. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
