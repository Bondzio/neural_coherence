Well, I removed the jumpers and then plugged in the connections and it works perfectly.
If I plug my headphones in the fron tthe speakers stop working and the audio goes to my headphones!
The retailer had wired the front audio to a 10pin connector so I was hoping that they had jumpered the pins inside the connector to replace the blue jumpers the manufacturer installed.
I guess they did.
Thanks for all your help!
