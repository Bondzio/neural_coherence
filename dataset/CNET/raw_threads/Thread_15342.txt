The funny irony is, when I first installed wireless using a $50 router, it was awful, but once I replaced the router with a refurbished $20 router sometime later, it worked like magic. So, if you've already tried changing the broadcast settings (like channels), and if you can tolerate lower speed, try setting everything on Wireless Mode-B, but if that doesn't work, I would say just get a new Wireless Router.

My &quot;computer&quot; room is at one end of the house and the DSL and router is there. To get good coverage at the other end I put an access point on the other end of the house on a closet shelf with an ethernet cable from router to access point. Now I have great coverage everywhere. This is just older 802.11g with different wireless channels on the router and separate access point.
