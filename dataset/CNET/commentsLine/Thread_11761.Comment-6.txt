i didn't read a clear answer about you wanting to get around the windows networking rules.
so let's note a common tool we use to auto login with your selected account.
-&gt; go get tweakui.
here's a google to help you along.
&quot; i have not created a user account on the vista computer because that creates an entire folder system as well as seeing their login icon on the scren during bootup, for each user on that computer which is what i want to avoid.
&quot; you have at this point declared you don't want to use the normal system.
enable the guest account and be aware of all the dangers it presents.
i don't duplicate web pages about why its a bad idea.
