1.1.1	I set my screen resolution at a setting that my monitor could n't display .	St
1.1.2	Now I get a black screen every time I try and turn on my computer .	St
1.1.3	I do n't get the usual boot up screen either .	St
1.1.4	I can boot up when I connect to the motherboard , but not when I use my graphics card .	St
1.1.5	Is there any way to fix this without connecting to a monitor which can handle the set screen resolution ?	Ques
1.2.1	Boot SAFE MODE and change the resolution there , then reboot .	St
1.3.1	I ca n't even see the screen that 'll let me do this .	St
1.3.2	It 's just completely black from when I turn on the computer .	St
1.4.1	All the PCs I 've used for years show a splash screen and could get the BIOS even with the Windows video setting being incorrect .	St
1.4.2	SAFE MODE seems to elude new users of Windows .	St
1.4.3	Let 's try this again .	St
1.4.4	Tell me how you tried to get to Windows SAFE MODE ?	Ques
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	thats the problem .	St
1.5.2	im not getting this screen anymore .	St
1.5.3	i 've actually done this before when I was using a different monitor , and used the & quot ; computer was n't shut down properly & quot ; screen to boot into safe mode and change it back .	St
1.5.4	this time though i do n't get that screen .	St
1.5.5	do you think I might have done something to the graphics card ?	Ques
1.5.6	could switching to this resolution cause the card to overheat ?	Ques
1.6.1	And no BIOS screen it does not look like a settings issue .	St
1.6.2	It now looks like a PC that needs repair .	St
1.6.3	As to the & quot ; done something to the graphics card ?	Ques
1.6.4	could switching to this resolution cause the card to overheat ? & quot ; I have yet to encounter that as a cause of a card failure .	St
1.6.5	Most failures are because of inadequate cooling , failed fan or a bad power supply .	St
1.6.6	Since there is no BIOS , splash or other screens the machine should be treated like a dead PC and we begin the repairs by replacing the parts we suspect first .	St
1.6.7	Bob	St
1.7.1	I can boot up fine using the integrated card , just not the external one .	St
1.7.2	I guess it must be the card then .	St
1.7.3	I was thinking that maybe changing the resolution could affect the splash screen .	St
1.7.4	If not , then I definitely destroyed the card .	St
1.7.5	I did mess with the card when it stopped working , and I do have a network card which partially obstructs the airflow from the card 's fan .	St
1.7.6	I probably screwed it up .	St
1.7.7	Crud .	St
1.8.1	Better than a real dead PC since repairs can be costly .	St
1.8.2	Since the card stops the machine cold I 'd keep that card out of the machine before it fries something in the PC .	St
1.8.3	Check the card warranty and you may get lucky , Bob	St
1.9.1	Thanks for your help .	Polite
