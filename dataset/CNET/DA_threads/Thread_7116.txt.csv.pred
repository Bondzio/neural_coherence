1.1.1	I connected a SATA HDD I got for christmas and it has never worked, the computer simply doesn't find it.	St
1.1.2	The HDD is a Seagate Barracuda 7200 RPM 200GB S150.	St
1.1.3	I am using a Asustek S754 K8T800 ATX A L R mobo (which is supposed to be SATA equipped) and my existing HDD is Maxtor DiamondMax Plus9 80GB UDMA133 which works fine.	St
1.1.4	Running Windows XP, AMD ATHLON 64 3000+, 2gb RAM, GeFrce 5950 GPU.	St
1.1.5	ATM I'm thinking the problem is in the Hardware but I need a way to determine that exactly otherwise I can;t return it to DABS (if I return it and they determine its not a problem with their hardware I end up paying all the delivery costs and still have an HDD that wont work) Would be grateful for any help	St
1.2.1	Download and install the SATA/RAID driver from the motherboard mfg website.	St
1.2.2	You need to have Windows XP (SP1) or later to handle HD larger than 137GB.	St
1.2.3	Reference: 48bitlba.com If installing Windows XP on that HD, you need to install the SATA/RAID driver by pressing F6 when prompted during the early part of the installation process.	St
