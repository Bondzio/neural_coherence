<s> ISSUE: Unable to maintain wireless connection to internet via router. </s>
<s> Signal strength starts off at 54.0 mbps and weakens to the point of disconnect and then immediately goes through the &quot;repair&quot; process repeatedly. </s>
<s> This happens no matter the distance from the router, whether right next to it or in the next room. </s>
<s> There are 3 other computers that connect to the same router (2 wirelessly and 1 wired) and DO NOT have this disconnect problem. </s>
<s> Have used WinSockFix.exe (version 1.0) obtained from Geek Squad, but still experience problem. </s>
<s> Wireless card has been reseated. </s>
<s> Tried to use Windows XP Network diagnostics, but wlan repairs connection before I am able to complete the diagnostics. </s>
<s> SYSTEM DETAILS: HP Compaq Presario with Win XP SP2. </s>
<s> Wireless card Broadcom 802.11 b/g with driver version 4.170.25.12 (09/20/2007) and HP Wireless Assistant (version 3.0). </s>
<s> Connects to Linksys Router WRT54GX4 (firmware 1.00.20) Would appreciate advice and/or suggestions on how to correct this problem. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Much about the setup of the router. </s>
<s> Is it set per our forum sticky at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7589_102-0.html?forumID=62&threadID=264135&messageID=2584349 There are some that will not update the router firmware because it works with other machines. </s>
<s> Sadly I have over a dozen personal instances of that and the owner paid the 120 bucks for the tech to come out and update the firmware they could have done themselves. </s>
<s> Yes, go ahead and ask why it fixes it. </s>
<s> Sorry, I don't know the answer or rather I do but it's too much for me to type in this small space. </s>
