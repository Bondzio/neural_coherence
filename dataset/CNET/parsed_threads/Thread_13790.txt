<s> I would like to be able to keep the PC in my bedroom, but be able to use it in my living room by using another monitor and wireless keyboard/mouse. </s>
<s> So I was looking for a longer monitor cable, about 50ft. </s>
<s> Right now I have it connected with the monitor cable that came with a Dell monitor. </s>
<s> I guess your standard monitor cable. </s>
<s> So I just want to buy a longer version of that..Will any 50ft VGA cable do? </s>
<s> It's just a regular Dell Monitor. </s>
<s> And my computer info is below,just in case you need it. </s>
<s> Operating System: Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit (6.1, Build 7600) (7600.win7_gdr.100618-1621) Language: English (Regional Setting: English) System Manufacturer: Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd.

<s> That's quite a distance. </s>
<s> You'll need some expensive cable to get that distance without suffering quality. </s>
<s> As well, your wireless keyboard and mouse may not work at all depending on what sort of physical obstructions are in the signal path. </s>
<s> You didn't say whether the keyboard and mouse you have now are PS2 of USB. </s>
<s> Since you'd be running 50 feet of video cable, you might as well go that route if you have PS2. </s>
<s> It's going to be awkward and cheap video cables will give you fuzzy images and poor color. </s>
<s> You'll need one that's well shielded and high quality. </s>
<s> Look at devices like this: http://www.aten.com/doc_data/pdf_dm/ce700a_specsheet_en.pdf </s>
<s> It's actually not 50 ft away. </s>
<s> I measured 25 ft but I needed a little extra cause it has has to go under the house and I thought the cables only came in 25 and 50 ft. </s>
<s> I found now they come in other lengths so I'd probably go about 30ft to 35 ft being that I want extra to go under the house. </s>
<s> If the graphics would improve with a smaller cable, like 25 ft. </s>
<s> I might be able to make that happen. </s>
<s> I really don't need a perfect picture since I mostly work in my room. </s>
<s> This is just for when I get tired of being in my room. </s>
<s> You said I'll need one that's well shielded and high quality. </s>
<s> I Guess that's what I was asking about. </s>
<s> What kind of cable exactly would you get then. </s>
<s> For about a 30 ft cable. </s>
<s> I mean I know you said high quality but how do you know what's high quality. </s>
<s> You said shielded ..is there anything else I should look for? </s>
<s> I think the Wireless keyboard and mouse might be okay since the place I want to have the monitor is in a direct route from my room. </s>
<s> In fact I can see it as I'm typing right now. </s>
<s> I figure I could keep the signal near the bedroom door and keep it open when I use the computer in the other room..You'd have to see a diagram to know what I was talking about, but I found a wireless not that expensive that signal goes for 30ft, and I wanted to get a wirelss keyboard and mouse for my room anyway. </s>
<s> So I might try that first. </s>
<s> I have a USB mouse and Keyboard right now. </s>
<s> I was thinking of the possibility of getting extended wires for that . </s>
<s> Why do you say to go that route if I have a PS2 connection? </s>
<s> Is it not possible to extend a USB connection..or is it too pricey? </s>
<s> thanks for the help. </s>
<s> I've looked at these and most of them are pretty expensive. </s>
<s> The cheapest one I found was over three hundred dollars. </s>
<s> The reason I thought of the VGA cable was that I thought I could pay less for that. </s>
<s> But the KVM Extenders I've found so far have been a three hundred dollars at least. </s>
<s> Do you know of any for less? </s>
<s> After decades of such queries and trying cables I think the answer is what you see here. </s>
<s> Imagine the (poorer) person who tries cables only to (re)discover the issues of long video cables. </s>
<s> Just trying to head off the losses. </s>

<s> I'll try one last time..sorry for all the replies but every time time I start to type a subject it submits my posts. </s>
<s> So I'm writing my post first this time. </s>
<s> Thanks for the advice. </s>
<s> I'm not sure.. if I were going to pay that much I might just get another computer and share files between the two. </s>
<s> I guess it's a good idea though. </s>
<s> I'll have to read more about it. </s>
<s> I still might try the cable thing. </s>
<s> they have one for about twenty bucks and it's got people saying how great it worked for them in the reviews..I know your shaking your head. </s>
<s> LOL But I don't think I'll be satisfied until I try it, for that price I've got to least least try..then I'll be telling other people not to do it.LOL thanks again.. and sorry about all those non posts. </s>
<s> (now I'll tpye my subject;) </s>
<s> For example some just want to play a video on their HDTV. </s>
<s> There are small 99 buck boxes that do that (Boxee, AppleTV, Roku to get you looking.) </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Mostly I work with images. </s>
<s> I do a lot of artwork and create things with 3d programs. </s>
<s> The thing is I'm just looking to get out of the room once in a while without having to spend a lot of monsey on equipment or a new computer. </s>
<s> Also, if I get another computer I'll have to share files which isn't always easy with the amount of files I have, and the amount of changes I make to them in one day. </s>
<s> So even if I could go into the other room to do some grunt work..like put things in order, sort through files.. </s>
<s> When you work with lot of images and files on your computer it gets overwhelming. </s>
<s> Whenever I work on an image I'm making changes to it and saving the old ones so it's necessary to constantly clean things up. </s>
<s> Or if I need to do some research on the web, stuff like that. </s>
<s> So even if I could just save that stuff for outside of my room, at least I would be able to work in another place for a while. </s>
<s> I'm not looking to play games or anything like that. </s>
<s> I'm not really looking to watch videos of course I wouldn't mind that but it's not my main focus. </s>
<s> I looked up those names you mentioned. </s>
<s> I wasn't looking for that really but that's pretty cool and not too expensive. </s>
<s> ;) thanks </s>
<s> In case anyone is reading this looking for help I just wanted to add that I went ahead and bought the RiteAV - SVGA Monitor Cable - 35 Ft. http://www.amazon.com/RiteAV-SVGA-Monitor-Cable-Ft/dp/B000V1LX3Q/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&qid=1295821971&sr=8-11 and it works perfectly. </s>
<s> I am sitting in my living room I write this and my PC is in another room. </s>
<s> Only a few things to think of before trying this. </s>
<s> I already had speakers that reach this room so I bought the cable without audio..you might need the one with the audio..if you're monitor accepts it. </s>
<s> You need either a USB extender or USB 2.0 Hub http://www.amazon.com/Targus-4-Port-Bend-Adapter-ACH103US/dp/B00180LGXQ for your mouse and keyboard. </s>
<s> Or I already had a wireless keyboard and mouse that works up to 30- ft away and I just happen to have a clear path from my computer room to my Living room where the monitor is set up So I set my PC near the door and so for the most part it works great..Sometimes the keyboard gets a little slow..SO I'm thinking of buying usb extension cable for that.But the mouse works fine. </s>
<s> Also this VGA cable I linked to above, only comes in Male to male..meaning you have to have a monitor that has a detachable cable so that you can directly plug it into the back. </s>
<s> Other wise you need a VGA coupler..which is not much at Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/RiteAV-Coupler-Gender-Changer-Female-Female/dp/B000V1PAWQ/ref=pd_rhf_shvl_1 Anyway, I was able to get my monitor to work in another room and i'm happy with the results. </s>
<s> The cost was 13.95 for the cable and I had the wireless set and speakers already. </s>
<s> I might get the USB extention cable for the keyboard as it tends to annoy me sometimes. </s>
<s> SO that might add another 20 bucks or so but it's worth it for me. </s>
<s> ;) Side note- I also got an extra long HDMI cable - http://www.amazon.com/Link-Depot-HDMI-Cable-feet/dp/B000IJY8DS/ref=sr_1_11?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1295822734&sr=1-11, and ran that from my computer room to the room next to it where I watch tv. </s>
<s> So I can now watch Netflix (or use the computer ) in my bedroom as well. </s>
<s> What's good about that is It's a new HD TV and the sound comes through the speakers so didn't have to worry about that. </s>
<s> So I was lucky with the cables I bought. </s>
<s> I looked at the reviews from people before I bought to make sure it was what I was looking for and what the opinions who actually bought those cables were. </s>
<s> MY only complaint is the keyboard which annoys me sometimes but I mostly work with photos so It's not a deal-breaker for me. </s>
<s> Plus I'll try better batteries or a USB extender before I give up on that. </s>
<s> ;) </s>
