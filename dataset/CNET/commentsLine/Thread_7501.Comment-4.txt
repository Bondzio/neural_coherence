this is an age old question.
first ran into it when i started as an engineer.
to sum it up &quot; is it better to blow or suck&quot;?
there is no hard and fast rule.
however if you are trying to cool a &quot;hot spot&quot;, heat sink-cpu chip-memory,then you want to concentrate the air on the spot or heat source.
for overall cooling of the interior of the &quot;box&quot; then you would want to get the fan near an entrance to get the maximun amount of cool air & blow it toward the heat sources.
what you do not want is to pull in dirty air (usually the bottom of the box) and blow it onto the electronic components.
hope this helps you think it through & helps you.
