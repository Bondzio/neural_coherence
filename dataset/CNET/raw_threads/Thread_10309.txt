I started out with an old HP Vectra VLi8 Desktop system. I put in a bigger CPU (1.3Ghz Celeron), increased the RAM(512mb), put in a 300Gb hard drive, I also installed a Hauppauge dual-tuner card WinTV-PVR-MCE-500, upgraded to a HP dvd840i dvd Writer(DL + Lightscribe), and to cap it off, I changed the operating system to Windows media center 2005 SP2. I am at my vertical limit with this problem. Can you tell me how to install the driver software for the HP dvd840i Super Multi DVD Writer? I can't burn the programs I've saved on my hard drive to dvd until I clear this up.

I replaced the Cd burner with HP Dvd840ri and now my 2004 Compaq Presario S5200NX (2.7ghz processor, 512mb memory,120gb hard drive) thinks the dvd burner is a cd burner.I have XP Home.I've tried everything short of a different burner. I don't like the Nero program and want to use Dvd Architect. Any suggestions?
