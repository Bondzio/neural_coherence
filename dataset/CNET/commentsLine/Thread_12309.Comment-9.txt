hi,maybe you have some explanation!!!
i had two hard disks,system and data.few weeks ago i saw a message &quot;secondary hard disk error,press f1 to resume&quot;,which i did and everytime when i turn on pc it was ok. system red from secondary /data/ hard disk.
i checked it few times with system tools/xp/,everything was ok. and... once,when i chehcked,jumper and cables /on secondary hd/,after that,when i turned on pc again,i saw same message but i didn't see hd!
sometime bios see hd /when i put it to find it manually/ but system doesn't.
there weren't any strange sounds or &quot;clicks&quot; or bad sectors and hd is spinning as i can notice.
cables and contacts are ok. i gave it to some good boy to change electronic board ,he did but it without any results?!
that's the story!
regards zoran
