Your video port/card is the final word on the specs it supports.
While a video port type determines it connectivity, the older the laptop the less likely a successful outcome.
Even, if you get it to work, the results maybe lackluster.
Plus, the adapter if found is just another cost and it too may introduce issues.
Most laptops don't provide any video upgrade other than ram, so don't expect to swap it out, UNLESS its capable(not likely).
As for HD quality, if the laptop ever offered it, yes, otherwise, no.
HD quality is also a ability of the DVD drive installed, if not HD capable won't have it.
For the time being since things change so much, this is the outcome I see for now.
good luck tada -----Willy
