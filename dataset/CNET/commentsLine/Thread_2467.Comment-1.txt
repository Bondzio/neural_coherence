sorry for if this sounds ludicrous but i wanted to troubleshoot as best as possible w/ as little headache as possible.
i just finished building a new pc from scratch.
when i went to plug in my monitor (hp w2207h) i see that the mobo accepts dvi (and hdmi) and the monitor has vga (and hdmi).
since there is no vga to dvi adapter, i am thinking i may need a new monitor (which is fine, if this is the case).
i tried to use the hdmi but the monitor says that is does not detect the hdmi input and goes to sleep.
does something else need to be installed, perhaps?
i need a screen so i can access the bios and later install my os but, as of now, i can not get my current monitor to work with the new build.
thoughts?
like i said, this sounds ridiculous and i feel stupid typing it but i'll take the heat.
if i have to purchase a new monitor, is there anything in particular that i should look for so that the monitor &quot;works&quot; without installing software, etc.
since this is a new build?
thanks for any feedback that can be offered.
trying to troubleshoot w/, as i said earlier, as few headaches as possible.
