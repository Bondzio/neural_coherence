1.1.1	I can not access the Internet through my router because it has been reset to its factory settings .	St
1.1.2	We have a strange , perhaps illogical network setup in our office .	St
1.1.3	Although it was set up before my time , I have figured it works as follows : ( 1 ) A wired/wireless router ( let 's call it Router A ) is connected directly to the DSL modem .	St
1.1.4	( 2 ) An Ethernet cord runs from this router to a 5 port switch .	St
1.1.5	( 3 ) 4 cords run from the switch to individual workstations .	St
1.1.6	These computers obtain their IP addresses automatically .	St
1.1.7	( 4 ) 1 cord runs from the switch to another wired/wireless router ( let 's call it Router B ) .	St
1.1.8	( 5 ) Two cords run from Router B to individual workstations ( let 's call them Workstations C ) .	St
1.1.9	These computers used permanent IP , subnet mask , default gateway , and DNS server addresses .	St
1.1.10	I understand that this was done because they could not obtain their IP addresses automatically .	St
1.1.11	The problem I 've caused seems to stem from me resetting Router B to the factory settings while trying to secure its signal and changing its IP address from 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.1.1 ( in order to avoid conflict with the modem which has the same IP address ) .	St
1.1.12	Once I did that , Workstations C could not access the Internet .	St
1.1.13	I have tinkered with the TCP/IP settings for Workstations C ( e.g .	St
1.1.14	by changing the default gateways to the Router B 's new IP address ) , but it does n't work .	St
1.1.15	What else should I be doing ?	Ques
1.1.16	Should I go into the router admin to change settings there ?	Ques
1.1.17	I would appreciate any help .	Polite
1.2.1	Rarely mix .	St
1.2.2	Why not set it up properly ?	Ques
