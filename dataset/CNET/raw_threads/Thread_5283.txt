The PC runs XP and the laptop runs Vista. The printer is an older HP 6110xi all in one and is currently used only by the PC. Is it as simple as buying a printer server and plugging in both computers? Do I need to load the HP drivers onto the laptop? If so, are drivers available for Vista? Can I get away with using a simple A-B switch? I'm not even sure what other questions to ask. Thanks, Sheldon
