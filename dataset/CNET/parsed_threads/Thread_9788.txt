<s> Hi, Usually I'm pretty confident with IT... but evidently not with wireless routers. </s>
<s> I have a Belkin Wireless G Router with Modem. </s>
<s> According to the manual, to set it up you; 1) Plug in the Ethernet cord from between the Belkin to your pc... it all lights up like a Xmas tree. </s>
<s> Check. </s>
<s> 2) Plug in the phone line to the Belkin. </s>
<s> Cool, more lights -it seems to be connected. </s>
<s> Check. </s>
<s> 3) Type in 192.168.2.1 into the address bar of Internet explorer and hit return. </s>
<s> Errrr... </s>
<s> I'm then asked by IE how I'd like to connect to the internet. </s>
<s> What the? </s>
<s> I assume its still trying to connect with my old modem? </s>
<s> If I disconnect the Belkin and connect to the internet with my previous BT Modem again, then I can go to 192.168 etc fine. </s>
<s> But that's not really any use is it. </s>
<s> What do I do? </s>
<s> This is supposed to be easy!! </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Sounds like you successfully accessed the Belkin outer's administration/configuration page by going to 192.168.2.1. </s>
<s> Then the router asked you a question about how you would like to connect to the internet; that is, the router is asking you to configure it for use with your particular Internet service. </s>
<s> Sounds normal. </s>
<s> No sorry, what I meant was, I cant connect to the 192.168 page! </s>
<s> Because windows asks me to connect to the internet first! </s>
<s> If I click 'work offline' then I get the usual page. </s>
<s> Does your computer indicate that a successful wired (not wireless) connection has been made to the router. </s>
<s> (Start &gt; Connect To &gt; Show all connections.) </s>
<s> Hold in the reset button for 10 seconds while the router is powered on. </s>
<s> Now try http://192.168.2.1 Any luck? </s>
<s> of the address. </s>
<s> My D-link wants 192.168.0.1, and a friends Linksys wants 192.168.1.1. </s>
<s> Another thought. </s>
<s> Define &quot;Phone Line&quot;. </s>
<s> What kind of broadband connection do you have? </s>
<s> After connecting everything, have you tried rebooting? </s>
<s> Sometimes XP needs a reboot when hit with a new IP address. </s>
<s> Or you might open a command prompt and type in: ipconfig /release ipconfig /renew Just some thoughts. </s>
