4275	1	261035	2566615	2566593	tubaloth	8/20/07 8:16 AM	1.18759776E12	depends	really depends lot little things main size program example windows xp faster processor small ram okay windows xp run smaller ram vista ram faster processor same hold true applications virus scanning program probably work faster processor video game probably work ram end ram way go stored ram retrieved faster cpu
4275	2	261035	2566570	2566593	jbking2	8/20/07 8:17 AM	1.18759782E12	couple thoughts	how determining frames per second game metric how extreme set doing iow small slow compared fast large actually isnt necessarily maximized unless plans substantially overpaying things cases machine utilize power case ram case processor likely paying big bucks something cheaper soon look historical cpu prices midrange values likely good assuming interval values reasonable eg ram capacity large gb bit system while small mb days regards jb
4275	3	261035	2566655	2566570	rickoy	8/20/07 9:25 AM	1.1876019E12	consider pc	ghz processor running pc ram often use video photo editing norton antivirus installed sometimes programs take too long start sometimes crashes need greater ram faster processor
4275	4	261035	2566697	2566655	jbking2	8/20/07 10:38 AM	1.18760628E12	probably something else	quadcore cpu motherboard faster fsb suggestion speed things video editing upgrading processor good idea though id likely quad core processor simply trying fastest socket running photo editing guess where bus amount ram factors things ram help faster bus big help id regards jb
