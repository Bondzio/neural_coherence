When staring up, my machine will show that the mouse keyboard, hard drive ect. has been installed. Then The Windows 98 screen is displayed. In a few seconds the initial screen reappears indicating the mouse, keyboard, etc has been installed. The Windows 98 screen appears again and the cycle continues. It never gets to the point of displaying my desktop. What is wrong? What can I do to get this thing to work?

Also, if you have installed a program or a virus has got on to your computer that could be causing it not to boot. Go into Safe Mode (hold down F8 or Ctrl when you turn your computer on) and remove any programes you have recently installed and run a virus scan. Hope this helps, JoshHendo.
