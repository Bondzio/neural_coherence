1.2.1	eMachines t6522 if it exists .	St
1.2.2	If not , get the HP 7150e , with the amd athlon x2 4400+ Roger	St
1.3.1	Having Media Center usually jacks up the price too much .	St
1.3.2	Try this : http : //www.emachines.com/products/products.html ? prod=eMachines_T6520 The X200 graphics is more than enough for light gaming .	St
1.3.3	However , the sound is weak and you need a TV tuner .	St
1.3.4	For sound : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16829102162 For the TV : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16815100136 For the monitor : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16824116355 Price before rebates : $ 1217 I admit , the monitor is a little pricy .	St
1.3.5	If you want to shave off $ 100 or so , do that with the monitor , as it is $ 420 .	St
1.4.1	In todays weekly flyer , in not in your newspaper , then get inside of Best Buy , a Gateway ( model 840GM ) with the new Dual-Core processor , Intel Pent D Processor 830 ( 3.0GHz ) , with a 17 & quot ; LCD Flat-Panel Monitor and color printer .	St

1.4.4	It has the new Integrated ( on board ) Intel Graphics Media Accelerator GMA 950 , but has a PCI-E x16 slot , so just buy a Geforce 6600GT ( around $ 160 ) or 6800 for less than $ 200 , and have a excellent high end gaming machine .	St
1.5.1	it is in the same case as my slightly outdated gateway 820gm .	St

1.6.1	Thanks to all for the replies .	St
1.6.2	The Gateway looks like a great deal .	Polite
1.6.3	The only thing I see missing is the light scribe technology .	St
1.6.4	I am not very familiar with that .	St
1.6.5	Is that something I should get ?	Ques
1.6.6	I do burn a lot of CDs .	St
1.6.7	Also , the GeForce 6600GT is listed at $ 250 at best buy .	St
1.6.8	Where can I find it for $ 160 ?	Ques
1.6.9	I also saw the SonyRB42G at best buy for $ 1279 after rebates , $ 1429 after adding the DVD-ROM , 640 processor and graphics card .	St
1.6.10	This seems like a good deal also , even though the Gateway has the Pentium D. What are your thoughts on this compared to the Gateway .	St
1.6.11	Thanks	Polite
1.7.1	Newegg sells for that price .	St
1.7.2	Lightscibe-marketing bs .	St
1.7.3	Sony=Overpriced piece of junk	St
1.8.1	is HP technology and as such may not be available elsewhere yet .	St
1.8.2	It came on my new HP and it is kind of neat because you can burn labels on CDs and DVDs without the messy labels .	St
1.8.3	Media runs around $ 8 for 5 either CD or DVD , but should drop in price eventually .	St
1.8.4	http : //www.lightscribe.com/index.aspx	St
1.9.1	you can chat online with gateway for free anytime except on weekend , i never liked sony 's support .	St
1.9.2	i have 2 sonys currently and they are good machines .	St
1.9.3	lightscribe is only if you want to put your own custom graphics/words/titles on to your cd .	St
1.9.4	most people including me just use sharpies the graphics card was on sale for $ 180 after rebates .	St
1.9.5	i would hurry to your store , or check the ad , and buy one because that was one good offer that did NOT disapoint me .	Ques
1.9.6	of course there is always newegg i would for sure go for gateway because it has dual core which is the future and it has a great case .	St

1.10.1	NIL	St
1.11.1	Just now reading your post after waking up from a nap .	St
1.11.2	I 'm not familiar with Light Scribe and it is not on these Sony or Gateway computers .	St
1.11.3	The ATI Radeon X300 PCI-Express cards are the lowest performer in the PCI-express line up as rated by Tom 's Hardware and can be had for $ 65- $ 66 at Newegg .	St
1.11.4	They would however be an improvement over the standard integrated GMA 900 graphics that would come with the Sony 's without a video card .	St
1.11.5	Note , the standard integrated on the Dual-Core Gateway is the newer GMA 950 graphics .	St
1.11.6	The BFG GeForce 6600GT PCIe graphics card that is on sale at Best Buy this week for $ 179.99+tax+ after mail-in rebates , is a overclocked version that normally sells for $ 212+ $ 4.50 shipping at Newegg .	St
1.11.7	The standard Geforce 6600GT PCIe like the Gigabyte sells for $ 162 + $ 3.50 shipping at Newegg .	St
1.11.8	You should not have any worries with Newegg , get deliverery in about 3 working days , can order over the net indicating to pay by check or Money Order , then immediately call on the phone and give your credit card number ( I do n't key my CC # on the PC ) .	St
1.11.9	http : //tinyurl.com/8vnkz The Gateway already has a DVD-ROM .	St
1.11.10	The Pentium 4 , 6xx processor series that Sony is using just came out this past January by Intel , and is an upgrade of the 5xx series by having the 64-bit support ( EM64T ) .	St
1.11.11	A few months later Intel came out with the Pentium D , 8xx series Dual-Core processor that also has the Extended Memory 64 Technology ( EM64T ) .	St
1.11.12	If you are unfamiliar with the new Dual-Core technology , you should read up on it .	St
1.11.13	If going with Intel Pentium computers and comparing these two particular Gateway and Sony computers , there is no doubt in my mind that I would definately choose the Gateway , mainly for the price comparison/dual core tech .	St
