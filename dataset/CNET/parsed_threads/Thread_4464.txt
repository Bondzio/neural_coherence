<s> I want to add a new HDD 120 GB to my computer. </s>
<s> I need to know on which IDE controller, and Master or Slave? </s>
<s> System running XP, existing HDD 40GB IDE 0, CD drive, DVD burner dual Layer. </s>
<s> New HDD to be used as storage. </s>
<s> Thank, in advance. </s>
<s> Add the new drive to the center connector on the IDE cable. </s>
<s> If the old drive is set for CS (cable select), set the new one the same. </s>
<s> If the old drive is set to master, set the new drive to slave. </s>
<s> Done. </s>
<s> You'll now need to have XP recognize the drive. </s>
<s> Go to Control Panel and click Administrative Tools, then click Computer Management. </s>
<s> On the left, click Disk Management. </s>
<s> Locate the new drive on the right. </s>
<s> Doing this from memory now, but there should be an option on the new drive to activate it or such. </s>
<s> And to format it to get it ready for use. </s>
