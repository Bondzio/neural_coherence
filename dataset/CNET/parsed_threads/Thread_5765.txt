<s> Just got a My Book Essential 1.5 TB HD A few things I want to ask: - How exactly do I add files / folders *manually*? </s>
<s> - I read online that seemed to strongly advise you do Not add or use the WD Smartware. </s>
<s> Ok. </s>
<s> Already installed & used it. </s>
<s> What have I done or what's in store for me now? </s>
<s> What to do from here? </s>
<s> - How exactly do I double check that what *appears* to be backed up in the HD is Really there? </s>
<s> Thanks for any help. </s>
<s> Let's be 100% clear here, *ANY* ext. </s>
<s> HD storage is NOT permanent, so take heed and save critical data to discs. </s>
<s> If super critical, then make multiple copies. </s>
<s> Next, treat your ext. </s>
<s> HD like eggs just to cover it should be treated well. </s>
<s> No matter how they advertise it, HDs still have moving parts,etc. </s>
<s> and damage can be done one way or another. </s>
<s> Mount and dismount using the proper procedure, don't just disconnect, even though you may have done this many times before, it can bite you. </s>
<s> Oh yeah, power issues, be sure to take care of that, remember, most ext. </s>
<s> HD need low voltage to run, so spikes aren't good. </s>
<s> Last, treat the ext. </s>
<s> media like any other media storage. </s>
<s> That's all it is another area to store media. </s>
<s> While you want this as back-up or similar, use what came with it, it works. </s>
<s> However, if manual, then again the user need only make a folder or directory or even partition it and use that storage. </s>
<s> Do this as if it were like an int. </s>
<s> HD, same-o same-o, like you've done before, that ext. </s>
<s> HD, is drive ???. </s>
<s> You can check shareware s/w or freebies, check out GoodSync as an example. </s>
<s> The www.download.con here is a good source among others. </s>
<s> tada ------Willy </s>
<s> I'm definitely very careful about handling these things. </s>
<s> This is my 2nd ext. </s>
<s> hd. </s>
<s> From what I was able to see/try on this new one, I can't see where in the WD screen that I can do any folder creation or dragging. </s>
<s> I'll have another look. </s>
<s> You familiar with these particular models? </s>
<s> ('cause the official WD forum is slow as molasses) </s>
<s> The real quick and dirty way is to have the source and destination both displayed. </s>
<s> You create the folder or directory you want on the new drive. </s>
<s> You click on it and menu pops-up make &quot;new&quot; etc.. Once done, you click on your source data and click and drag to new location you just made -OR- drag to open area of desktop then drag from there to new final location. </s>
<s> http://www.lightroomforums.net/showthread.php?15567-Exporting-Folders-into-new-External-Hard-Drive- (without-photos) The above link seems to cover much of any PC would need to do. </s>
<s> It offers to use &quot;sync s/w&quot; as well. </s>
<s> This maybe all trial and error, so you may want to play with this using less important files/folders, etc., before you do the big move. </s>
<s> I suggest some dummy .DOC file or less important one. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> What I ended up doing (& I should've thought of it way earlier), was go to My Computer, click & open the WD hd icon & simply dragged/dropped from there. </s>
<s> I went back into WD & everything seemed to be in place where I put it. </s>
<s> I definitely want to save my music in at least 3 separate places, on cd etc, but it's a real pain since I have a good 30+ GBs of music. </s>
<s> Even if I used DVDs, it'd still take several disks to do that. </s>
<s> =/ </s>
<s> I know that it's a PITA to do all this copying and several at that. </s>
<s> BUT! </s>
<s> if you check this forum all those users that ask for advise in helping recover data or steps to save from further damage, yada, yada, it's something you have to accept. </s>
<s> It's the nature of beast, frequent back-up or syncs to store data in several places. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> I just gotta bite the bullet & do it. </s>
<s> Thanks a bunch for your time & advice. </s>
<s> You were an enormous help. </s>
