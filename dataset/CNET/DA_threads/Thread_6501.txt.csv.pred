1.1.1	Ok , so i 'm in the market for a new desktop .	St
1.1.2	I 've been looking around at different types of computers , IBM , HP , Gateway , Alienware , the usual suspects .	St
1.1.3	Now , i currently have a Dell , and despite a few problems , i have had few complaints with them .	St
1.1.4	Tech support to me is probally a lower issue for me , as I can troubleshoot most issues that arise .	St
1.1.5	I 'm a power freak .	St
1.1.6	I love raw computing power .	St
1.1.7	I play games off and on .	St
1.1.8	Mostly the computer would be used for internet , playing music , email , etc .	St
1.1.9	I do n't want to build my own computer .	St
1.1.10	So what type of computer , just the computer , do you think is best ?	Ques
1.1.11	Dell Demension 8400 Power Mac/I-Mac Alienware Area-51 3500 Some HP Pavilion Some IBM	St
1.2.1	Something has happened to alienate one brand name .	St
1.2.2	They are also not shipping the product as you agreed to , substituting parts to get you the machine and hope you accept it .	St
1.2.3	For now , they are to avoided until they learn to treat customers with respect .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Yeah , i just saw that on Alienware .	St
1.3.2	Does n't look good .	St
1.3.3	So much for A+ support .	St
1.3.4	Any other suggestions ?	Ques
1.4.1	IBM is not about the latest fire breathing system .	St
1.4.2	So you decide if you like their units and what remains to be in the PC industry some of the best support .	St
1.4.3	The Apple is top in service and if you pump enough into a box you have a nice dual CPU machine that will run what you can have on the Mac with ease .	St
1.4.4	The HP/Compaq has a wide selection from boxed ready to use units to custom units that can be what you want .	St
1.4.5	Service seems to be above average .	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	Thanks for your help .	Polite
1.5.2	Just a few more things about each company .	St
1.5.3	IBM .	St
1.5.4	I noticed they were n't the fastest , coolest , etc computers , but my sister has had her laptop for years and loves it .	St
1.5.5	Tech support seems good .	St
1.5.6	However , do you think that the recent buyout of IBM will affect tech support or quality ?	Ques
1.5.7	Apple .	St
1.5.8	Seems awesome .	Polite
1.5.9	Only 2 problems are obviously the switch of OS , trying to transfer my files and software , if at all .	St
1.5.10	Other problem is cost .	St
1.5.11	Not sure if I 'm willing to shell out 3k for a computer .	St
1.5.12	I had bad experiences with a Compaq laptop .	St
1.5.13	Nothing but problems .	St
1.5.14	Did the HP purchase improve tech support/quality at all ?	Ques
1.5.15	And lastly Dell .	St
1.5.16	What about the 8400 ?	Ques
1.5.17	I think that looks good , but I got my laptop right before the Dell boom , and I am unsure if the product quality has deterioated .	St
1.5.18	So bascially , I 'm wondering about the quality of the actual machines for the price .	St
1.6.1	Your choice here .	St
1.6.2	I 'm writing from my observations and what I see in our office and from the field ... IBM is n't sold yet .	St
1.6.3	In fact the Feds seem to have the last say here .	St
1.6.4	So far , no change has been noticed from what little I see .	St
1.6.5	Nothing in the major news either .	St
1.6.6	Let 's call it a & quot ; steady Eddie & quot ; .	St
1.6.7	Apple .	St
1.6.8	For top performance , you need the bucks .	St
1.6.9	File transfer is n't the hassle it used to be .	St
1.6.10	Does n't sound like you have a great reason to go there .	St
1.6.11	Certainly if gaming is one thing this must do ...	St
1.6.12	The games are nice that appear , but not all do ( Halo ? )	Ques
1.6.13	HP/Compaq .	St
1.6.14	Again , let me keep this personal .	St
1.6.15	In my personal collection there are now 4 Compaq laptops .	St
1.6.16	Two ancient Pentium class machines that wo n't die and 2 Athlon 64 models from last month 's upgrades .	St
1.6.17	The units look and feel great .	St
1.6.18	While the video is all of the Nvidia 420 Go with 64MB RAM dedicated , some gamers will still not be happy .	St
1.6.19	I 'd get more of these at the office .	St
1.6.20	We have n't had any issues with HP or Compaq so I can only write about old ( 2 and up year laptops ) that people need repairs on .	St
1.6.21	The laptop way of things send some into convulsions when they see the repair bill or estimate ... Dell .	St
1.6.22	Have many at the office .	St
1.6.23	Boring machines that work , people drop or kill and if it 's not abuse , Dell fixes .	St
1.6.24	Bottom line ?	Ques
1.6.25	I like all the above makes .	St
1.6.26	Bob	St
1.7.1	Thanks man .	Polite
1.7.2	I 'm glad i 've picked decent models .	St
1.7.3	You 're advice has helped a great deal , not i get to pick	St
1.8.1	i dont know about how you may feel about this , but i thought i could throw it out there .	St
1.8.2	how comfortable do you feel with asembling your own system .	St
1.8.3	pick the raw power that you want yourself .	St
1.8.4	for me , researching the latest and greatest is just as impressive as using it .	St
1.8.5	( well , almost ... )	St
1.9.1	I 'm not crazy about building my own system .	St
1.9.2	i could probally do it , but i do n't have the time really to invest in learning about all the parts and assembly necessary to get a good system	St
1.10.1	The Dell has the 925XE motherboard and new 6xx Pentium 4 with DDR-533 everything the best , and is cheaper than getting it at alienware	St
1.11.1	Just bought another Dell Desktop yesterday .	St
1.11.2	Plain vanilla 4700 for office .	St
1.11.3	Could n't beat the components at that price and free monitor thrown in .	St
1.11.4	However - last year wanted a really hot home system and called Polywell and had one configured .	St
1.11.5	Could name which video card , sound , nic etc .	St
1.11.6	and they would build .	St
1.11.7	Very nice on phone and got exactly as ordered .	St
1.11.8	Not a company for handholding but they are responsive .	St
1.11.9	Better than building your own cause you get what you want exactly and all burned in and working .	St
1.11.10	Now I 'm looking for a good new system for me .	St
1.11.11	I 've headed over to Velocity Micro and am working on a config there .	St
1.11.12	Have n't heard much either way on them - another not so huge company - so think I will try them out as their machines are getting good reviews in the mags .	St
1.11.13	I still love my now 3 yr old IBM laptop .	St
1.11.14	It 's a workhorse .	St
1.11.15	Have not had good luck over time with either Compaq or hp except for hp printers and the old Ipaq .	St
1.11.16	One thing I 've learned with any system .	St
1.11.17	Absolutely necessary to put them on an UPS not just a surge protector .	St
1.11.18	The newer machines are all very sensitive to even tiny power fluctuations and the UPS makes it all smooth .	St
1.11.19	Has made all the difference in the world in & quot ; no problems & quot ; with weird crashes etc .	St
1.11.20	on all our machines .	St
1.11.21	Happy hunting .	St
1.11.22	I always love an excuse to go computer shopping .	St
1.12.1	I would suggest holding off for just a little while buying HP , Compaq , and most others if you plan on buying a Pentium 4 .	St
1.12.2	Pentium 4 recently introduced their 6xx models with 64-bit ( EM64T ) support .	St
1.12.3	It seem like most companies are still trying to get rid of their Pent 5xx models .	St
1.12.4	The Dell 8400 Pentium 6xx would be my choice as of now and it has the Intel 64-bit ( EM64T ) support .	St
1.12.5	Alienware 51-3500 in their basic $ 1142 with Pent model 5xx does n't show me much .	St
1.12.6	http : //www.alienware.com/Product_Pages/desktop_all_default.aspx This Dell 8400 would be much more and better equipped customized around $ 1041 : http : //configure.us.dell.com/dellstore/config.aspx ? c=ussd & cs=19 & kc=6V658 & l=en & oc=D84MC & s=dhs # bottom_anchor	St
