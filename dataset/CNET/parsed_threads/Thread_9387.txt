<s> I have three PC's with XP Pro. </s>
<s> Only one PC correctly recognized a K-Byte 128 mb Thumb drive when connected to USB port. </s>
<s> How can I force the other machines to see the drive? </s>
<s> Isn't recognized as new hardware and no drivers are needed or available. </s>
<s> Widely noted at http://www.usbman.com is the need for the (person!) </s>
<s> installer of XP to have: 1. </s>
<s> Current BIOS. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> USB in BIOS enabled. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Motherboard and possibly USB drivers installed. </s>
<s> None of these items are performed by Microsoft for most machines and certainly not items 1 and 2. </s>
<s> In closing USBMAN notes many issues with some onboard chipsets that can result in mis-identifying an USB device or failure. </s>
<s> If you can tell the make/model of the motherboard or chipset, I'd point to more specific USBMAN articles. </s>

<s> One of the machines I'm using is a brand new HP with a current BIOS. </s>
<s> USB works with every other device I've tried -- card readers, digital cameras, hubs etc. </s>
<s> Just no the thumb drive. </s>
<s> http://www.usbman.com notes not only the issues I noted that XP Pro without latest updates may have issues with USB 2 devices or ports. </s>
<s> Both &quot;USB 2 devices&quot; have issues without SP1 and I've seen issues with USB 2 ports working with USB 1 devices. </s>
<s> One workaround was to use an USB 1.1 Hub inbetween. </s>
<s> Without you give explicit details on chipsets, SP status of the XP Pro and more, I must leave you to research the USB site. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> One person found the front USB plugs were non-operational. </s>
<s> Some BIOS allow enabling of front/rear seperately. </s>
<s> Again, YOU get to check this. </s>
<s> Test the device in a port you know works and not just the one that's empty. </s>
