<s> Hi all, I am looking to assemble a PIV machine; and the vendor has offered me the following configuration: -PIV 2.66 Ghz -Mbd Intel 102 -Transient (or is it &quot;Transcient&quot;) Ram 1 Ghz (&quot;533 Mhz speed&quot;) I would appreciate inputs and insights on the capabilities of the mbd and the Ram. </s>
<s> Any URLs that I can read up on? </s>
<s> TIA, Sanjay. </s>
<s> There are many Pentium 4 processors and many Intel motherboards that work with the P4 processor. </s>
<s> &quot;Intel 102&quot; is not a common name for an Intel motherboard. </s>
<s> Look at these current Intel motherboards to see typical names: http://www.intel.com/products/motherboard/index.htm?iid=HMPAGE+Header_2_Product_MB </s>
<s> There are also &quot;Intel compatible&quot; motherboards, which means that there are companies other than Intel that make motherboards that use Intel processors. </s>
<s> &quot;transcend&quot; is the brand name of your RAM. </s>
<s> &quot;102&quot; is probably the vendor's internal designation of the motherboard. </s>
<s> i don't recommend buying any P4 now since most will be effectively discontinued at the end of the month when core 2 duo debuts. </s>
<s> the remaining P4Ds will drop in price dramatically so you'll be able to afford a faster CPU. </s>
<s> P4D 945 3.4GHz 800MHz 2x2MB $163 (now $316) P4D 915 2.8GHz 800MHz 2x2MB $133 (now $169) P4D 820 2.8GHz 800MHz 2x1MB $113 (now $169) P4D 805 2.66GHz 533MHz 2x1MB $93 (now $115) </s>
<s> Hello there, Thanks for your response. </s>
<s> I got back to the vendor, who says it is original Intel D102 motherboard. </s>
<s> Does that help? </s>
<s> I would like to know the performance of this mbd, and whether there are any known bugs for which patches are available / not available. </s>
<s> Thanks again, Sanjay. </s>
<s> Hello, Thanks for the tip! </s>
<s> My purchase decision gets postponed till end July / first week of August! </s>
<s> Which motherboard will suit the PIV Duals best, btw? </s>
<s> And, is there anything better than Transcend RAMs? </s>
<s> How is the performance of these Transcend memories? </s>
<s> Any inputs on these are highly appreciated. </s>
<s> TIA, Sanjay. </s>
<s> This is the only Intel &quot;D102&quot; motherboard I could find at Intel.com: http://www.intel.com/products/motherboard/d102ggc2/index.htm Intel makes solid motherboards, but they don't have a reputation for being great overclockers (important for high-end gamers). </s>
<s> The board is very small-- microATX size, so it is not very expandable. </s>
<s> Look for a full ATX motherboard if you plan to make this a gaming, media center, or a computer for some use that might require many add-in cards (sound card, 56K modem, TV tuner, PhysX card, etc. </s>
<s> ). </s>
<s> transcend's an ok brand. </s>
<s> corsair probably has the best rep as high-performance ram companies. </s>
<s> crucial is considered high-quality ram also. </s>
<s> ocz, geil, patriot, and transcend are other companies who make high-performance (flashy) ram. </s>
<s> kingston and pny are mainstream ram and generally slower. </s>
<s> as for motherboards, it depends on your budget. </s>
<s> if you're willing to spend another $100, you can probably get a core 2 duo CPU and a 965 based motherboard. </s>
<s> but you'll have to wait a few more weeks and run the usual risks of being an early adopter of new technology. </s>
<s> if you're budget concious, but want to be able to possibly upgrade to a core 2 duo in the future, i'd recommend getting a mobo based on the 946g chipset. </s>
<s> here's intel's model: http://www.intel.com/products/motherboard/d946gzis/index.htm it has built-in graphics, sound, LAN, supports 4 SATA devices, 2 ATA(IDE) devices, 8 USB ports, and PCI Express slots (for high-performance graphics). </s>
<s> It only 2 RAM slots, so I'd recommend filling them with 2GB. </s>
<s> if you just want a good, inexpensive PC now, then get a motherboard based on the 945g chipset. </s>
<s> here are 2 suggestions: biostar, $93: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=246442 asus, $115: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=247080 </s>
<s> Hello ramarc, Thanks for the insight and detailed information. </s>
<s> Much appreciated. </s>
<s> Cheers, Sanjay. </s>
<s> Hello linkit, Oh, okay, this feature (of microsize) was not pointed out by my box-pushing vendor!! </s>
<s> I guess I will go in for the 945 series motherboard that 'ramarc' has recommended in this thread. </s>
<s> Thanks for your tips; much appreciated. </s>
<s> Regards, Sanjay. </s>
