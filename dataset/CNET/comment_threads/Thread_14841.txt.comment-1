I was wondering what the risks were of flashing my BIOS.
I bought a new stick of RAM that isn't working and I've narrowed down the problem to an out-of-date BIOS.
When booting up with the new RAM I get the error message: Failure initialising CONFIGMG: Windows protection error.
You must restart your computer.
850Mhz Duron 256 MB RAM (existing) Gigabyte GA-7IXE4 Windows 98SE I'd be glad to hear any ideas.
Thanks Adam
