I recently added a Pioneer DVD writer (Pioneer DVD-RW DVR-110D) to my computer as a slave drive to my existing DVD/CD Combo. However, I couldn't get the Pioneer DVD Writer to be in Ultra DMA Mode 2. The Master drive is set to DMA if available and the current transfer mode is Ultra DMA Mode 2. However, the slave drive is set to DMA if available but the current trasnfer mode is still PIO Mode. I have tried uninstalling the Primary IDE Channel and let Windows XP reinstall it but the problem still remains. Please advice me of what to do. I am using: Dell 4700 3.4Ghz 512MB RAM 40 pin connector Pioneer DVD-RW DVR-110D (as slave)on cable select HL-DT-ST RW/DVD GCC-4481B (as master) Thanks for your help.
