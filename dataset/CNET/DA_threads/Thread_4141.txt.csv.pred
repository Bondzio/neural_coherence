1.1.1	When using my laptops in the other end of the building from the present router , the wireless is disconnected , and signal is zero , because of many walls in between .	St
1.1.2	Rather than spending on wireless extenders , or repeaters , or antennas , I thought of plugging in a second dsl modem into the phone outlet in that other end of the building .	St
1.1.3	This means I would need to buy a second router for that second setup .	St
1.1.4	So , is there such a thing as a combo modem/wireless router available , that I can just plug a cable into the phone outlet ( like a conventional dsl modem ) , and then 4 wired connections to computers from the same combo unit , plus getting the wireless capability ?	Ques
1.1.5	Sorry for this wordy description .	St
1.1.6	If any info , would appreciate links to some vendors or models .	Polite
1.1.7	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	My home can accomodate 2 DSL modems and my DSL supplier has that device you ask for .	St
1.2.2	BUT the charge would be another 39 bucks a month to turn on the second DSL line .	St
1.2.3	Seems rather steep , but it can be an option for those willing to pay .	St

1.3.1	Thanks for your prompt reply Bob .	Polite
1.3.2	Expensive - I 'll find an alternative .	St
1.3.3	I thought it 's like plugging in a second phone into another phone outlet .	St
1.4.1	You can find a multitude of adsl2 modem/wireless router combos everywhere at very reasonable pricing - or even used/ good working condition on eBay for less than $ 20 .	St
1.4.2	You are correct in that they can plug directly into your phone jack - dsl filters are only for phones/ faxes where you do not want a dsl on the line , otherwise as stated - no filter in the jack & you have a instant access to dsl which the modem is plugged into .	St
1.4.3	Word of advice , stay away from 2Wire modems if you can - especially if you 're looking to get some range out of the device .	St
1.4.4	.	St
1.4.5	.	St
1.4.6	they are horrible & setting up or using WPA is a complete nightmare .	St
1.4.7	I have heard that Linksys cause some a bit of a headache also when initially setting them up - but there are very good , reasonably priced modem/router combos by D-Link ( my favorite , mainly b/c I 'm used to the interface ) , Belkin & am currently looking into a few new ones myself by Zoom ( X6 model , for example ) , etc .	St
1.4.8	One other thing to make sure of is the compatibility - 802.11b/g should be fine for all computers/ laptops/ netbooks these days & 802.11n has even faster speeds/ range without much interference ( i.e .	St
1.4.9	portable phones , etc .	St
1.4.10	) , but make sure you 're compatible - or at least that they are backward compatible w/ 802.11b/g & you 're off to the races	St
1.5.1	The answer in 2005 means that old answer has expired .	St
1.5.2	Let 's lock this old post so it drops in time .	St
