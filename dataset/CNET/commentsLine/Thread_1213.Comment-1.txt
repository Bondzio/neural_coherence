i have an unknown motherboard.
connector for the bluetooth is the same connector on the bluetooth module, but not 8 pin.
on the motherboard is a 6 pin connector, the same shape as on the module.
&lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt;does anyone know compatible cable connector?
&lt;span&gt;where we would it be bought?
&lt;span&gt;the figures for the bt module connector.
&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span&gt;  &lt;span&gt;  &lt;span&gt;  &lt;span&gt;
