1.1.1	I recently upgraded to a new computer and got a Seagate 120GB SATA hard drive with it .	St
1.1.2	I have a DVD-ROM and a CDRW also .	St
1.1.3	But me being me I hate getting the computer with all the different crap on the hard drive so I reformatted and reinstalled WinXP Pro .	St
1.1.4	I know you have to go into device manager under IDE ATA/ATAPI Controllers and make sure you have & quot ; DMA mode if available & quot ; selected .	St
1.1.5	Well I am pretty sure my DVD-ROM and CDRW are configured to Ultra DMA Mode 2 on my Primary IDE Channel .	St
1.1.6	That would leave my hard drive under the Secondary IDE Channel configured as Ultra DMA Mode 5 .	St
1.1.7	Here is why I ask : # 1 ) I really do not know how the computers hard drive was configured originally because I reformatted and reinstalled the OS .	St
1.1.8	# 2 ) When I run SiSoft Sandra Pro 2004 it continually tells that my hard drive is underachieving .	St
1.1.9	It says it should be set to Ultra DMA Mode 6 .	St
1.1.10	# 3 ) When I get my hard disk check results at PCPitstop.com I get unusually low percentage results ( % 43 ) in either cached or uncached speed ( cant remember ) .	St
1.1.11	I have a DFI I875ProB motherboard and have the latest BIOS installed .	St
1.1.12	The BIOS is setup to use ICH5 Raid type .	St
1.1.13	Not Highpoint Raid because I only have a single hard drive .	St
1.1.14	Plus when I install and configure for Highpoint Raid the computer boots completely different ( meaning extra boot screens for the Highpoint Raid controller ) from when I originally got the machine .	St
1.1.15	Any help is appreciated as I am totally in the dark on this problem if it is a problem ? ?	Ques
1.1.16	?	Ques
1.2.1	Before I reply , note that some will never understand the benchmarks are rarely duplicated or repeatable .	St
1.2.2	You have to take it with some salve that you may never see the numbers that you see posted .	St
1.2.3	Too often , the person posts the best numbers they ever saw or just fibs .	St
1.2.4	Another issue is what 's in the benchmark is not the same hardware as you have .	St
1.2.5	But let 's give it a go ?	Ques
1.2.6	Here is why I ask : # 1 ) I really do not know how the computers hard drive was configured originally because I reformatted and reinstalled the OS .	St
1.2.7	No question here .	St
1.2.8	# 2 ) When I run SiSoft Sandra Pro 2004 it continually tells that my hard drive is underachieving .	St
1.2.9	It says it should be set to Ultra DMA Mode 6 .	St
1.2.10	While interesting , what was the score ?	Ques
1.2.11	# 3 ) When I get my hard disk check results at PCPitstop.com I get unusually low percentage results ( % 43 ) in either cached or uncached speed ( cant remember ) .	St
1.2.12	Most complain about uncached speed .	St
1.2.13	Which is interesting only in benchmarks since in real life we let it cache .	St
1.2.14	Only by changing hard disks to say 10,000 RPM units and such will you push this number .	St
1.2.15	Let 's ask this - & gt ; Are you going to replace hard disks , motherboards and such just for a better benchmark ?	Ques
1.2.16	Bob	St
1.3.1	Already set I think everything is good now .	St
1.3.2	Thanks anyways !	St
1.4.1	I am facing problem SATA drive for Windows 2000 Pro installation .	St
1.4.2	Purchased WD 300GB SATA drive INTEL 865GBF MOBO .	St
1.4.3	2.4GHZ P4 processor .	St
1.4.4	While installing Windows 2000 Pro showing HDD non partition or damaged partition .	St
1.4.5	Copy image from old Windows 2000 by Maxtor partition copying .	St
1.4.6	Then install windows XP pro fresh install .	St
