<s> I have a question. </s>
<s> My building has wireless access via a hotspot from a non-for- profit agency that registered the SSID. </s>
<s> An electric block occurred and for a second Thursday morning, knocking out the lights and forcing my pc to re boot. </s>
<s> After that I havent been able to connect toward the net. </s>
<s> My connection tells me its acquiring for an IP address. </s>
<s> I tried to put non valid IP's... </s>
<s> It showed a connection but the IP addresses wasnt valid given they wasnt from the routers DHCP. </s>
<s> Given the router for the building isnt within my range so how do I configure this problem? </s>
<s> Do, I talk to the manager about re booting the router or configuring it so the DHCP can send an IP. </s>
<s> How do explain this situation to someone who is a newbie toward all things wireless. </s>
<s> Remember I dont have access to the router nor the APs. </s>
<s> So, Im limited in what I can do on my own and trust me, I tried numerous situations. </s>
<s> Any information is appreciated. </s>
<s> Make sure you're within range and try opening a command prompt and type, ipconfig /release and hit enter. </s>
<s> Then type ipconfig /renew and hit enter. </s>
<s> Thanks for responding sir. </s>
<s> I tried ipconfig. </s>
<s> Didn't work. </s>
<s> I think its a matter soley on the router then my setup. </s>
