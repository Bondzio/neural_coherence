To all intents and purposes AGP 4x and 8x are the same. Very fast AGP graphics cards are still widely available. The nV 7800GS, ATI X850XT, and the GT6800 Ultra can be used in AGP4x and AGP 8x motherboards, and will be able to handle any game on the market, even at high detail settings. http://tomshardware.co.uk/2006/02/02/nvidia_7800gs_confirms_agp_aint_dead_yet_uk/index.html GeeBee
