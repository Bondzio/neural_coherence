Hi.
I have a WGR614 v8 Netgear Wireless router.
It is not connected directly to my computer.
I need to open ports 3658, 3659, 6500, and 27900 so that I can connect to other servers while playing Star Wars Battlefront II for PC.
Does anyone know how to open these ports?
If so, please reply.
I have been trying for over a week.
Thanks Nick
