I am looking to purchase a new printer and am unsure as to whether I need a network ready printer or a wireless printer.
I have an older desktop connected in my kids room which is connected to a wireless router and then to the DSL port in the wall.
I also have a Dell laptop which I use wirelessly in a separate office room.
I want to be able to print from both computers, but I want to set the printer up in my office not next to the desktop with the router.
The way I understand what I have read so far is that a network ready printer would actually need to be wired to the router, and a wireless printer would not, but would pick up the signal from the router.
In either case it seems I would be able to print wirelessly from the laptop.
But if I buy a wireless printer, would I be able to print from the desktop to the wireless printer if it is set up in another room?
I hope I explained this clearly enough....
