i did not want to temper with the bios as long as the pc can operate, this was fine over a year until recently the sata hdd was suddenly undetectable.
i guess i'm wrong.
should/must i update the bios?
i was forced to re-install xp on an older ide hdd and it is working.
but a newly purchsed sata hdd cannot be detected, so i suspect the motherboard's sata function is damaged.
