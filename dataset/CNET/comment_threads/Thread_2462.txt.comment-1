I am a hospice chaplain and I am looking for a program and hardware to use to track my mileage and visitations.
It needs to tell me where I've been, for how long and how many miles it took to get me there.
I also want to be able to get directions to the addresses that I have to visit.
i also want to be able to submit reports (mileage and visitation notes) to the home office via a laptop in my car (or from my house office).
I also plan to use my computer to edit video and audio for worship services.
I am curently usinf Primere Pro and Sonar but could be convinced to make changes.
Can you help me decide what software and hardware to purchase?
Jonathan
