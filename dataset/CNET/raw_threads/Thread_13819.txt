It's a sad issue with name brands that once you change the motherboard your OS license is null and void. Some go ballistic on this but &quot;it's in da agreement.&quot; Given you had to install another OS my bet is someone forgot motherboard drivers or some other BIOS or other than the TV card driver. Good luck finding which one but it may be time to review posts with google.com about HOW TO INSTALL WINDOWS XP. Bob
