1.1.7	All suggestions appreciated , -Larry	Polite
1.2.1	anything you want to put on them..not just movies .	St
1.2.2	Might also consider going to 120GB ... they 're almost same price as then 80GB and they 're under the size limit where almost any OS would recognize the full capacity ( see 48bitlba.com ) .	St
1.2.3	Check over at Newegg.com ..they 've got a wide selection of HDDs and and DVD burner 's .	St
1.2.4	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	I 'd just install the OS and everything else on the new HD and forget about the old 10GB clunker .	St
1.3.2	It 'll be faster and quieter .	St
1.3.3	You can put any type of file on a DVD as long as it fits .	St
1.3.4	There are good dual layer DVD burners ( read and write to both CD 's and DVD 's ) for less than $ 40 online .	St
1.3.5	What is your computer manufacturer name and model ?	Ques
1.3.6	What operating system ?	Ques
1.4.1	My system details are : HP Vectra VL400 DT Windows 2000 SP3 ( But I will probably upgrade to XP SP2 ) Pentium III Processor	St
1.5.1	You should be OK with a 120GB hard drive or smaller .	St
1.5.2	The issue of hard drives larger than 137GB : http : //www.48bitlba.com/ http : //www.48bitlba.com/win2k.htm * * * * * Your motherboard may not support newer Ultra ATA hard drives ( ATA/66/100/133 ) , so you may have to add an ATA/100/133 hard disk controller card to a PCI slot .	St
1.5.3	Something like one of these : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.asp ? Submit=ENE & N=2000150410+1193212548+119340940+1193512552 & Subcategory=410 & description= & srchInDesc= Also , make sure you use an 80-wire ( not 40 wire ) Ultra ATA data cable .	St
1.5.4	See the pictures here : http : //www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/confCable80-c.html * * * * * The maker of your new HD has a free utility to transfer the image of the old HD directly to the new one .	St
1.5.5	This is much quicker than reinstalling the OS , drivers , OS patches , software , and personal files .	St
1.5.6	However , if I have n't performed a fresh installation of everything in years , I like to take the opportunity of a new HD to do just that .	St
1.5.7	It eliminates a lot of junk and fixes corrupt system files .	St
1.5.8	REMEMBER to implement your plan to backup all important file to CD or DVD before you try any of these solutions .	St
