If you want to sell it after 7 months and everything is still working as it should, try to get 80% of what you paid for it (after subtracting and removing at least 2 Gb of RAM, because XP Home can't use more than 3.2, so that's just money spent for nothing). I don't think you'll get it, but it's worth a try. Kees
