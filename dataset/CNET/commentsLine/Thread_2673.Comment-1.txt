i play luxor a lot also star wars etc.
video starts to shake, then starts to jump ball in one place now three balls over, person on left now on right.
system will either restart or end game play.
if i stop the game will get blue screen and restart, system will not shut down completely using proper shutdown procedures after game play.
works fine with office 2003 and all associated programs.
system fans increase and decrease in speed at any time, checked ac power in via ups and its a solid 120vac out.
need help on this one.
thanks in advance
