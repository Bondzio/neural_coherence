<s> I have a problem with the wireless connection on my mum's laptop. </s>
<s> It's been working fine but recently the message &quot;wireless network connection not connected&quot; has appeared. </s>
<s> We can no longer connect through wireless. </s>
<s> I've tried re-enabling it but no luck. </s>
<s> I've tried the windows repair option but no luck. </s>
<s> I've tried setting up the network again but still nothing. </s>
<s> when i try to view available networks it says none in range. </s>
<s> Is this a hardware failure? </s>
<s> Can anyone advise me?? </s>
<s> More Info We normally have to press a button for it to search the wireless networks and now when we press it nothing happens. </s>
<s> Also if i right click the monitors and click view avaliable wireless networks its blank and nothing comes up!! </s>

<s> For now try the usual quick fix. </s>
<s> Lookup WINSOCKFIX and run that. </s>
<s> Some laptops have a button to disable the wifi (aka Flight Mode) so be sure you don't have it in that mode. </s>
