<s> Hey all, Great forum, I have found many useful tips on this site. </s>
<s> It finally looks like I need some help of my own. </s>
<s> Actually, I have a few problems at the moment. </s>
<s> The one that is frustrating me the most is probably a fairly simple one...however, I can't seem to find a solution. </s>
<s> I recently had my nieces using my computer and they must have been playing with the buttons on the monitor. </s>
<s> Now the screen is off center and difficult to read. </s>
<s> No matter how hard I try, I can't quite get it to look like it used to with the monitors controls. </s>
<s> My question is this, is it possible to reset your monitor to it's original factory settings? </s>
<s> I have a cheap Lenovo E75 17&quot; CRT monitor and I can't seem to find any info on how to default it's settings back to the original. </s>
<s> It does have an option called &quot;Recall&quot; on it's menu screen but it only seems to default it back to it's original contrast and brightness settings. </s>
<s> Any info or help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> And thank you very much in advance. </s>
<s> and fills the screen. </s>
<s> If so, it's not the monitor but display settings. </s>
<s> If you could test it on another PC, that would help to rule out come causes or narrow the possibilities. </s>
<s> Steven, Thank you for the reply. </s>
<s> I have tested it on another computer and it shows the same distorted picture. </s>
<s> Also, I tried another monitor on my computer and it is totally fine. </s>
<s> Any suggestions from here? </s>
<s> I just wish that I could just press a button and reset the damn thing. </s>
<s> Thanks for the input... </s>
