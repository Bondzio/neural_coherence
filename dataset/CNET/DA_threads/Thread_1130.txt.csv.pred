1.1.1	Hi All I am running windows XP pro and just install 200GB hard drive as a slave however, after I format the drive I only get 127 GB out of it, is there any way I can get the max 200 GB out of this drive?	St
1.1.2	I use a 80GB as master, anyone with an idea could please e-mail me at winperry@hotmail.com Thanks much	St
1.2.1	you need a pci contoller card to get your computer to recongnize the 200GB Hard drive	St
1.3.1	To go past that, you need SP1 (SP2 preferred) and a BIOS that supports 48BIT LBA.	Sug
1.3.2	More at http://www.48bitlba.com/ Since you have just XP Pro and no SP1 or SP2, a PCI card will not fix this.	St

1.4.1	I just went through this, I installed a 200Gb Seagate as drive D: and kept OS on drive C: (80Gb)on XP.	St
1.4.2	The new drive intructions had me go online and download a file that made XP see past 127GB.	St
