<s> The CD ROM drive in our DELL CPU doesn't seem to want to read disks. </s>
<s> The operating system is windows XP, and at one time the ROM drive worked correctly. </s>
<s> It opens and closes, but the green light never comes on like it use to when it was reading a disk. </s>
<s> We have tried uninstalling the driver, and then reinstalling to no avail. </s>
<s> On the device manager tab is shows a yellow exclamation point over the drive. </s>
<s> Where should we go from here? </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> Make sure the cables haven't gotten loose. </s>
<s> If they're OK . </s>

<s> Replace the drive. </s>
<s> With power-OFF, reseat the CD drives cables(both ends) several times and try again. </s>
<s> If no go, then at least blow out any dust and use a CD cleaner as well. </s>
<s> If the problem persists, then consider the drive is kaput. </s>
<s> These CD drives don't last forever and find a replacement. </s>
<s> You gave no clue of the age of the Dell system but after 1yr. </s>
<s> of use, expect some type of problem. </s>
<s> As for the yellow flag at the device mgr., note what error it displays and google for it. </s>
<s> IMHO, in most cases the drive is kaput and new one usually solves many an issue. </s>
