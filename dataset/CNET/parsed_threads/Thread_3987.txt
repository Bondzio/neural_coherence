<s> Does anybody know if they are any coupons for the Dell SE198WFP? </s>
<s> It's a pretty cheap monitor as is (plan to buy it anyway), but I was wondering if anyone had any dell.com coupons to knock another 10% off. </s>
<s> I scoured for some on Google for awhile but had no luck, although I did find when this monitor was originally released, it was $189 vs. $199 it is now. </s>
<s> Anywho, any help is appreciated. </s>
<s> I wouldn't mind saving a buck or two (which is why I'm getting this monitor in the first place). </s>
<s> Try here: http://www.retailmenot.com/view/dell.com I didn't see one for that particular model, but there were some for others. </s>
<s> Yeah, it's not there, but thanks for the link. </s>
<s> I'll use that site in the future (good layout compared to the other coupons sites I've seen). </s>
<s> Well Dell just dropped the price today of that monitor by $10 bucks and it turns out they have no price guarentee. </s>
<s> I should have waited ten more days to order. </s>
<s> Oh well, but if there's anyone out there wanting to get it for cheaper, now's your chance. </s>
<s> The sale lasts until Oct 4th. </s>
<s> At least I didnt lose as much as the iPhone guys. </s>
