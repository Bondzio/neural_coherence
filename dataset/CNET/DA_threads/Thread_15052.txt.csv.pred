1.1.1	I have a Samsung 24&quot; widescreen monitor and I know the native resolution is 1920x1080.	St
1.1.2	I also am aware that this equates to a 16x9.	St
1.1.3	I want to change the resolution because I cant see 1920x1080 that well.	St
1.1.4	Out of all the optional resolutions, the only other one that equates to a 16x9 is 1360x768.	St
1.1.5	When I change the display to that resolution everything on the screen gets fuzzy.	St
1.1.6	It doesn't happen with any other resolution.	St
1.1.7	Any ideas?	St
1.2.1	No resolution other than native will provide the optimum image.	St
1.2.2	There are some tweaks in Windows that might help.	St
1.2.3	Make sure you use &quot;clear type&quot; for text.	Res
1.2.4	You can change icon size on your desktop, Windows XP and 7 both have features to help those with vision problems.	St
1.2.5	In 7 it's called &quot;ease of access&quot; or some such...an accessory.	St
1.3.1	What about upgrading your video?	St
1.3.2	Perhaps you already have, if not that might be a thought.	St
1.3.3	An aftermarket slot card could/would increase your options.	St
1.3.4	Good luck!	St
1.4.1	I tried the clear type option but it didn't help.	St
1.4.2	Its not just the type but everything on the screen looks off.	St
1.4.3	Why does it happen only with this one resolution?	St
1.5.1	Steve's post mentioned NATIVE RESOLUTION, which would be optimal for that monitor but not necessarily for the onboard (computer) hardware, that is why I asked if you had upgraded your system, specifically an aftermarket video card that could give you more options and potentially better performance.
