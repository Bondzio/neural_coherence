two reasons for paper curling, tension and heat.
due to humidity and/or environment, paper is prone to curl to its weak side.
its the way the paper ream was cut.
leave a sheet of paper by a sunny window and show it start to curl overtime.
as for tension, when going through the paper path, the bends and curves will cause this.
under heat more so, like in laser printing.
cheap paper too is prone to this condition.
again on tension, if possible use the straight paper path if available(some models do).
the tension rollers keep the paper firm in its paper path, but under wear&tear will lessen over time.
any correction may cause less curling but over time will cause jamming, crimps, kinks or off-shrew as the paper isn't flat as can be.
