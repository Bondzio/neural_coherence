i posted this on a different forum and then came across the networking forum- any help would be appreciated thanks: &quot;i have two computers, and i use linksys b wireless broadband router to connect computer #2 to the internet from computer #1. comp #1 is my primary cpu and i do not use comp #2 that often.
i am going to be purchasing a new printer primarily for photos and will connect it to comp #1 and take my old printer and use it with comp #2. now, comp #2 is on a different level on the house.
i plan on networking the two computers, so i can send a print job (documents etc.)
to the comp #2 printer.
here is my question- is it possible to have the computer in power save mode and still send a print job to the computer?
by sending a print job, will the computer wake up and then print??
my printer turns on by itself when a print job is sent to the printer.
since i use comp #2 very infrequently, i don't want to keep it on all the time- i would prefer to leave it on powersave mode.
is what i am suggesting on doing feasible???
i've never really networked computers except for internet access so i am very naive in this area.
thanks for any help and suggestions!&quot;
