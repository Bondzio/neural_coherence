My computer has just been getting worse and worse lately.
I run AVG and ad aware scans regularly but it gets no better.
I think it's time to do what i've heard others do which is a system rebuild?
I just want to be sure that i wont screw it up so i would be really grateful if someone could give me a basic guide to rebuilding the software on my computer (drivers and OS etc.)
