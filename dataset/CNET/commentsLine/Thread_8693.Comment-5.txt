i have installed a lot of these, had a high rate of failure, one client had the keyboard and mouse both die twice in a year and were replaced under warranty, the third time they were out of warranty and they just went back to wired devices.
in other cases they claimed the batteries were pretty new but it didn't work, changing the batteries again resolved it.
as the other message mentions, hitting connect buttons on keyboard and mouse can usually fix this, but not in many cases i have seen.
