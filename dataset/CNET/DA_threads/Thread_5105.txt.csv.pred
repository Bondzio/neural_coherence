1.1.1	I built a PC with the following configuration : MOBO- ASUS M2N-32SLI which includes Nvidia RAID controller Windows 7 Professional ( 64-bit ) AMD Dual Core Athlon processor 4 GB RAM Current RAID confguration is 2 disks mirrored for drive C ( all program installs ) Mirror 2 has all docs , data , etc My question is this : how difficult would it be to reconfigure the RAID to 5 ?	Ques
1.1.2	Would the best solution be to break each mirror , and add an additional drive for drives C and D and convert them to a separate RAID 5 virtual drive for each ?	Ques
1.1.3	Also , would I have to lose all of the data and/or programs , or does the RAID controller automatically reconfigure the data and convert it to RAID 5 ?	Ques
1.1.4	The reason that I 'm using RAID instead of backup is that I have huge video and music files ( I create videos and arrange music ) and do n't want to add a 2 TB drive to back up everything .	St
1.1.5	However , I ca n't risk losing my information and files .	St
1.1.6	I hope that this is a bit clearer than mud .	St
1.1.7	If anyone needs clarification or additional info , I will be happy to append it to this original post .	St
1.1.8	Thanks in advance for your help .	St

1.2.1	Let 's start by you supply the MANUAL to this RAID controller .	St
1.2.2	I 'll read it if you supply it and see if they document how to do this .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	I appreciate your wiilingness to look at the documentation and I really feel stupid asking this question , but i ca n't find anywhere in this forum thread where I can attach a pdf file of the manual .	St
1.3.2	I can reply with the instructions in the message body , but the chapter on the RAID controller is 17 pages long .	St
1.3.3	I have searched the FAQs and every other place on this site , but can not find where I can upload the pdf .	St
1.3.4	Please forgive my ignorance , but this is the first forum where I 've encountered this problem .	St
1.3.5	Thanks , jeff	St
1.4.1	You can supply the maker 's web link or even a dropbox public link .	St
1.5.1	I 'm so sorry - I did n't even think about doing that .	St
1.5.2	Here is a link to the manual .	St
1.5.3	The pdf download is about at the middle of the page .	St
1.5.4	Again , I thank you for willing to take the time to see if you can help me .	Polite
1.5.5	Hope you 're having a Happy Turkey Day !	St

1.6.1	& quot ; Sorry .	St
1.6.2	Model description .	St
1.6.3	ASUS M2N32-SLI Deluxe is temporary unavailable. & quot ; Did I try for the wrong board ?	Ques
1.6.4	Is this at the ASUS site ?	Ques
1.7.1	in outline format .	St
1.7.2	1 .	St
1.7.3	I would create an image of the RAID 1 array and store that on another HD .	St
1.7.4	2 .	St
1.7.5	I would create the RAID 5 array on a new set of HDs using the BIOS utility to do such .	St
1.7.6	( This will break the RAID 1 array ) You will also want to make sure your HD selection is designed for RAID operation .	St
1.7.7	3 .	St
1.7.8	I would restore the image to the new array .	St
1.7.9	4 .	St
1.7.10	I would attempt to boot the PC .	St
1.7.11	With a little luck and cooperation from the imaging software , this should work since the array is considered as one drive .	St
1.7.12	I have used this method to move an OS on a single disk to a RAID 1 array and it worked fine with XP .	St
1.7.13	I 've not gone from one RAID configuration to another , however .	St
1.7.14	Your MB claims to support RAID 0/1/5 and JBOD .	St
1.7.15	Good luck .	Polite
