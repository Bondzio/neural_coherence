thanks anmor for the link to this excellent site.
i found an ati 8500 pro graphics card on e-bay for a good price.
it has 64mb with tv out.
i know it's a couple of years old but i found a professional review that said it was very good card.
i know you can't make a silk purse from a sow's ear but if i can improve my video, i can think about buying a new desk top in a couple of years.
