<s> Anyone I am a very beginner. </s>
<s> This is the first time. </s>
<s> I am trying to install a 2nd drive with the old drive. </s>
<s> The old drive is a Western Digital, I think, a 5 pin jumper selection. </s>
<s> My new drive is Maxtor. </s>
<s> I've been trying to find out the jumper settings for the old drive. </s>
<s> There is one jumper on the old drive on 1-2 pins. </s>
<s> I want to set the old drive to CS, cable select. </s>
<s> I really don't wish take the old drive out if I don't have to. </s>
<s> All I have about the old drive is that it is 40GB, Ultra DMA HD, 5-pin, by Western Digital. </s>
<s> I don't understand much of the language or what they are talking about at Western Digital site. </s>
<s> Or anywhere else for that matter. </s>
<s> I would appreciate any help anyone has to offer. </s>
<s> thanks ron </s>
<s> And the drives should be set to all Cable Select which means the master and slave is determined by what connection you use. </s>
<s> FULL DETAILS about this at http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/confCable80-c.html Bob </s>
<s> Thank you for your reply but I still don't know how to set the jumper setting on the old drive - Western Digital drive. </s>
<s> Maxtor did include the 80 conductor cable. </s>
<s> They did tell me to set both drives to CS/cable select. </s>
<s> But where is cable select? </s>
<s> Their drive has a 5-pin selection. </s>
<s> If I set to slave but I'm afraid of data loss, or whatever. </s>
<s> with much appreciation ron stebbins </s>
<s> Look either on the botom of the drive in line with the jumper pins or on a label attached to the HD. </s>
<s> Cable Selec is usually CSEL, but what ever they call it it will be apparent which you need. </s>
<s> Setting to wrong configuarion won't wipe your data, but drievs will not be recognized if nit set correctly. </s>
