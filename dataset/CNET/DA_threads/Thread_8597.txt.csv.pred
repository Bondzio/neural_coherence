1.1.1	Hi, I have just bought a new Asus A8N-SLI motherboard.	St
1.1.2	I plan to buy a SATA hard drive to install along with it in the case (It will be the only hard drive in the PC).	St
1.1.3	Do I have to have the drive in a RAID?	St
1.1.4	Or can I just have it as the primary drive?	St
1.1.5	(I realize there is no secondary drive with a SATA cable).	St
1.1.6	Also, will I be prompted by Windows XP install to install the drivers for the SATA drive (F6?)?	St
1.1.7	Or will Windows XP automatically &quot;see&quot; the drive and start installing to the drive?	St
1.1.8	Thanks for any help you can provide.	Polite
1.2.1	Since your just doing the one drive, you don't need to worry about anything RAID.	St
1.2.2	Raid is for mid-level workstations and servers.	St
1.2.3	Also, since it's just SATA on the MoBo you will not need to load any other drivers during install... Good luck!	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
