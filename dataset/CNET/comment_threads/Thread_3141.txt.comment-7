Generally they aren't noticeable unless they react with something else.
It would seem that something in your speaker system is acting as a detector/demodulator.
This could be a faulty component, a design flaw or any of a number of things.
A simple diode can act as a detector and some oscillating circuit act as a demodulator which just removes the carrier signal.
Even a poor ground or solder connection can act something like a diode depending on the circuit it's in.
An unintended oscillations in electronic circuits would be hard to isolate and resolve without proper instruments.
You can try shielding but my guess is your success will be limited.
At least you have something to work with now.
Good luck.
