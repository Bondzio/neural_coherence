Well, to my experience True Image is excellent for making a backup image of OS.
I always use it, and I think it'll completely satisfy your requirements.
You could create a small hidden partition (called Secure Zone - because of its inaccessibility to any other software) for strongly compressed drive image and further incremental backups.
After fully installing and optimizing Windows, drivers create a full-system image.
You'll be able to access the image upon boot, whenever you want to resort to a full system restore.
But I think the best way to make sure in it to read review about most popular backup software.
