My speed, range and connectivity are very low (12%). I was wondering if upgrading my router would help with this issue? Which should I upgrade to - Wireless G or the newer Wireless N? Should I stay with Linksys since that is what the laptop card is? I noticed that Linksys has WRT54GT, WRT54G and WRT54GS. Is one better than the other? Thanks so much. It is really hard to get this info.

I replaced my chip set Ethernet Adapter with a wired Ethernet Card and the speed increase was very good, exceeding a second Giga bit of RAM that was installed. You might consider this rather then the router replacement. The card was a 10/100/1000 with a GB of memory.
