consider a more robust, more efficient psu.
it can save you money in the long run as it can often be used in another system requiring more watts and amps and greater efficiency generates reduced energy use.
less efficient power supplies simply use more electricity to generate the power required to run the system.
by purchasing a higher quality, more powerful, more efficient psu now .... the psu will reliably support the current system, use less electricity and be transferable to a future system requiring more power.
