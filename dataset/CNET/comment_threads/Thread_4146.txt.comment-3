just my preference, when I put in a second drive I always format it as a system disk and put an OS on it too in case the other drive dies suddenly.
I don't know XP but I always do &quot;cable select&quot; on the jumpers.
works well for me and makes things easier and more versatile if you're &quot;the mess around with it&quot; type.
I also always put in a second parition of about 1 gig so I can put my delorme map CD on that and not have to put it in the CD drive for it to work.
