My options are 1) dual Western Digital 7200RPM configured to RAID 0 or 2) WD Raptor 10k RPM + a seperate 7200 for storage Now, config #2 is actually a bit more expensive than the dual 7200RPM, and I know RAID 0 adds speed by combining the read/write speeds, etc, but I dont know enough to make an informed decision without help. Thanks in advance, zach
