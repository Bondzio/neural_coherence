<s> I've set up a home network using my work laptop, called MSHOME. </s>
<s> I can see the other machine in Microsoft Windows Network both ways - between PC and laptop. </s>
<s> When I try to open the machine, I have to log on. </s>
<s> The PC is called ORANGEROOM and the laptop is LAPTOP28. </s>
<s> My log on username for both machines is &quot;cool&quot;. </s>
<s> When I try to log on to the laptop through the network, by typing in &quot;cool&quot; with a password, it changes to ORANGEROOM/cool but won't log on. </s>
<s> When I try to log onto the PC from the laptop, I again have to log on and I get an error message: The username you typed in is the same as the user name you logged on with. </s>
<s> That user name has already been tried. </s>
<s> A domain controller cannot be found to verify that user name. </s>
<s> I'm running XP Pro SP2 and would really appreciate some help! </s>
<s> Any firewalls running? </s>
<s> Set any folders to share? </s>
<s> When faced with a login box I usually put in the user name of the computer I am trying to access. </s>
<s> No joy. </s>
<s> Folders are set to share and I have disabled NIS firewall. </s>
<s> I think the logon problem is to do with the way the networking has been set up. </s>
<s> At work, the laptop connects to a domain. </s>
<s> I asked the administrator to set the machine up to also work as a home network. </s>
<s> Would this make a differerence? </s>
<s> &quot;I asked the administrator to set the machine up to also work as a home network. </s>
<s> Would this make a differerence?&quot; Absolutely, your work machine is looking for a Domain to join. </s>
<s> What did your IT guy say? </s>
<s> It was a &quot;she&quot; actually! </s>
<s> I just asked to set the machine up for a home network. </s>
<s> She seems to have retained the work domain: is it not possible to have a domain and a home network? </s>
<s> When I click My network places, I can see my school network &quot;CHschool&quot; and &quot;MSHOME&quot; - my home network. </s>
<s> It's a built in limitation of the XP Home OS. </s>
<s> You need XP Pro to interact with most work networks since they have a Domain login requirement. </s>
<s> Your IT should help you with this. </s>
<s> Also worth noting is that a VPN connection will have restrictions to what shares you can connect to. </s>
<s> This is by design! </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Both machines are running XP Pro, Bob. </s>
