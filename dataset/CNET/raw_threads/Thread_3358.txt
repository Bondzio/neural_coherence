7006	0	268203	2608090	NR	vapour_lock	10/16/07 9:30 AM	1.192527E12	Sata ODD not detected	Hi running intel e6750, asus p5kse, 2x sata seagate HD's on vista business I have windows running and bought the Samgsung SH s203 dvd writer and im trying to get it installed. I plugged it into sata port 3 on the mobo. when i boot up it doesnt get recognized by the system. Ive gone into bios and designated ports 3/4 as cdrom and that hasnt worked. Ive tried all combinations of plugging in the 3 sata drives into the sata ports. no dice. Anyother ideas? thanks
