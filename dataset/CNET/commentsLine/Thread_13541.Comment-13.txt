i'm going to download 3dmark and run it as a soak testing on my graphics card.
my power supply is labeled 500w with a max of 408w on the +12v output.
as you mentioned in the earlier test, this power supply does look like a bit under the bar.
i&quot;ll see if i can try with a 650w power supply.
however, when running memtest, i'd assume the video card is running at lower power comsumption.
also, stucking at exactly the same place everytime is not really a sign of under geared power supply.
morever, i tried with my old ati x800 card as well, the problem remains.
