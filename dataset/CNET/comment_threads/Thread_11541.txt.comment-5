I got a used computer from a relitive.
They said the computer was off and there was a storm.
They heard a loud crack from the computer.
The next day, when an attempted power-on was done, the power light did not come on, and there was no image on the monitor.
I got it to work on.
I wasn't sure what was wrong, so I stripped out all the PCI cards (modem, sound card, etc.
)and I turned it on and it worked.
I suggust you try taking out the PCI cards.
