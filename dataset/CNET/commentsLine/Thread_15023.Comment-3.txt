i'm personally in the middle of building an x2 4200+ system.
if i was going to go with a 4400+, but since the am2 versions are no longer being made/sold, i'm stuck going cheaper since i capped my own price.
anyway, enough about me.
i agree with the other guy.
if you can wait a good 3-4 months, i'd build a core 2 duo/core 2 extreme-based system.
it will be expensive, but as of right now, the most expensive chip will still be cheaper then the afforementioned fx-62 by around $300.
it will also destroy the fx-62.
of course, if you're like me and you want to build something immediately, go with an amd processor of your choosing, whether it be fx or x2.
and i'd also go with an am2 socket processor, just so you can upgrade down the line if you need to.
ddr2 667mhz memory runs about the same speed as ddr 400mhz, so there's plenty of good memory if you need it for cheap.
just make sure you have a graphics card capable of jumping through hoops if you're wanting all the fancy effects of vista.
