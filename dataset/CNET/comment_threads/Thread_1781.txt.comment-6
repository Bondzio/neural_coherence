If you do not want to make things worse when you use the program to recover formatted files from hard drive, there are a few precautions to keep in mind: First, before you recover your data, do not save any new files onto the formatted hard drive.
Second, do not install the recovery software onto the formatted drive, install it on a different disk drive or to a separate PC.
Third, if you are afraid of damage to the formatted drive during recovery process, you can create a disk image of the drive to pull the data from rather than directly from the disk, some of the recovery software includes disk imaging function.
