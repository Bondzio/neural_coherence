i need to run a computer about 500 feet from a wireless router, the problem i am having is i am using a linksys wireless router, and the signal is very weak at the ending computer i have tried range boosters, with no help at all i do have a coax cable (from a old network) running from the building with the router in it to the building with the computer in it, but cant find an adaptor to convert from coax to rj45 i also have thought about putting an exterior antenna up, but have never played with them any ideas would be great thank you
