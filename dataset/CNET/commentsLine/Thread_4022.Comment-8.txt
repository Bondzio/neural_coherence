bob i was searching for a solution that enabled me to connect my plextor 230 cd drive to a newish sata dell (insp 520).
i'm not a hardware guy at all so am having to take this slowly.
there is no ide connector that i could see although there is a plug-in for a floppy drive connect in tghe diagram of the motherboard which looks like an ide cable connection point.
assuming a can connect here will i need to install a pci card?
if this option fails i wonder whether a simple ide to sata dongle would be the way to proceed ... assuming i have spare sata connection and power points.
i am hot at home where the dell is but will return there for a week in 6 days and would like to get any stuff i need on the way home.
would appreciate yours and others advice about this.
