7364	0	288968	2736568	NR	geofos	3/24/08 1:23 AM	1.20632178E12	Monitor trouble	Three weeks ago I purchased a 19 inch widescreen monitor model #S199WFP from Dell. Starting last week from time to time a thin purplish vertical line appears in the left quarter of the screen at various times and then disappears, sometimes for a few hours at a time but it always returns. Tech support at Dell has been very poor, they requiring I keep a journal for a week to note every time the problem occurs and what I'm doing at the time, despite the fact it came with a three year warranty and I'm to call them at the end of that week if the problem continues. My question is could it possibly be the video card causing the problem and not the monitor? My system is a Dell Inspiron 530s which I bought five weeks ago. Or could it be something else I'm doing? I would rather not have to deal with the rude tech support from Dell of India. Anyone else have issues with Dell Tech Support or is this just an isolated case? Any help appreciated.

Whatever you do or try, be careful not to do such that Dell might consider it as voiding your warranty. About all you can get away with is to swap the monitor onto another PC or try another monitor on yours so see what happens. I can't think of a connection issue that would cause this. Do make sure you're using the native resolution of the monitor and defaults for the video card as far as refresh rates.

You have a problem, they should address it and since monitor is relatively new, go for the replacement. Understand, you may not get a brand new monitor(you could) but one certified for use as &quot;refurb/rebuild/tested&quot; but will be fine for use. Anyways, also you may want to get a &quot;monitor test pgm&quot; or similar o disaply test patterns to get tests done. Your video driver pgm. if ATI or nVidea should also do some testing. The DX9 or DX10 can have similar test, type at run [dxdiag] no brackets, press enter check into all that, what are your results, act accordingly. tada -----Willy

I just found this thread and wanted to reply here as well to make sure you saw. From what you describe it sounds to me like the problem is with the monitor itself. Steven Haninger's suggestion to try the monitor on another computer and/or another monitor on your computer would help confirm whether the problem was the monitor or not (if the problem follows the monitor then the monitor is the problem). If you still need help getting it replaced please contact me (customer_advocate@dell.com) and I'll be happy to help you. Larry Dell Customer Advocate

It doesn't show well for Dell that to get help I had to start a thread on CNET, but Larry exemplified great customer service. Thanks Larry

I agree that things could (and should) have been taken care of better before this, however, I have passed on feedback about what happened so we can take steps to try and improve things.
