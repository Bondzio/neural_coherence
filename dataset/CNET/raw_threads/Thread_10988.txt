7848	0	343026	3045096	NR	Shepbob	5/16/09 7:35 AM	1.2424593E12	Won't recognize USB	I was given a custom built computer with XP Pro. It has no plugs for keyboard or mouse only 3 usb plugs in back and 2 in front. I have tried plugging in a USB keyboard and a USB Mouse in all but at boot in Cmos it says &quot;No Keyboard detected&quot; Then &quot;No Mouse detected&quot;. It then proceeds to the windows sign on screen wanting a password. I know the password but unable to enter or by pass the screen because Keyboard and mouse are not recognized. Any ideas?

You might consider recycling parts into a new machine that works. Who's to say that all the USB ports are blown? And no, an USB PCI card rarely works in this sort of blown board issue. Bob
