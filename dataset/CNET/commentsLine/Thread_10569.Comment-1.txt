i have two hard drives in my hp, one with xp sp2, and the other drive has linux mandrake.
how do i remove linux from the second drive (i'm pretty sure it's the slave) and free up that drive so i can use it for xp?
i'm not very computer savvy, so if you can help please don't get too technical on me!
thanks very much.
