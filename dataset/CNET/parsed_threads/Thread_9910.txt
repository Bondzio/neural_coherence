<s> Hello all, im here looking for some really good help on building up a new desktop. </s>
<s> I just got an very old desktop that has basically nothing in it. </s>
<s> The hard drive only has 7gb max, 128mb of RAM, I odnt think theres a sound card or w/e. </s>
<s> So yeah its pretty old and 'basic'. </s>
<s> I want to upgrade everything but really dont know where to start; Should I start with the Hard Drive? </s>
<s> A new Mobo, or start with RAM? </s>
<s> I dont wanna dish out thousands of dollars, I just want something that decent for gaming and entertainment and doing shcool stuff. </s>
<s> So any simple help on where I should start would be great. </s>
<s> You cannot simply upgrade your system as you go. </s>
<s> Do not toss your computer as you may find it fun to play with it later learning about different OSs without having to mess with DUAL booting. </s>
<s> You can also make it into a router, NAS, print server, WIFI router, USB hub etc. </s>
<s> If you lay down a price I'll help you build one on newegg. </s>
<s> http://www.pcper.com/hwlb.php Good starting point...mix and match as the budget allows. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> You RAM, Motherboard, power supply unit and CPU ALL have to be compatible. </s>
<s> Compatitbility comes in generations. </s>
<s> By slowly upgrading you would lose a lot of bang for your buck. </s>
<s> Whilst just replacing would be an effective way to get a nice computer. </s>
<s> Also please list any games you would actually want to play. </s>
<s> You can look up the recommended hardware for the game you want to play and keep those specs in mind when picking out parts. </s>
