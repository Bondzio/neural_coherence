Here's what I've got so far... i5-2500k sandy bridge Nvidia geforce 660 500gb hdd 8gb RAM (depending on mobo) Cooler Master HAF 922 pretty much everything except a good motherboard. $200-$300 price range. Not looking at SLI. Needs HDMI. Ideas?

I know for sure I need HDMI (tv will serve as monitor for now) and two front usb 3.0 connectors. When it comes to pci, pcie, sata, raid, etc... I don't know what I'm looking at and the difference between a $150 or $250 mobo.

Also, for video cards I like this link. http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html Bob

Your basic drive hook ups are going to be SATA, HDD, DVDRW....etc., that has become fairly standard.
