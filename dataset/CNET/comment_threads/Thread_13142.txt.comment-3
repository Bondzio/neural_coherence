Sorry for the confusion, that is not the actual cooler I bought, I was just using the picture to show the bracket.
I actually bought it from tigerdirect.ca, anyone know how they are about returning things.
The cooler I did buy is this one http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=235454&Sku=ULT31424 .
I'd rather not have to deal with returning it, but I wouldn't risk my mobo either, sooooo.....yeah.
