I have an old HP that ran windows 98SE that I think the power supply took a hit and would like to install the HD into another pc (gateway) running windows2000 pro.
I don't care about the data on the old HD, just would like to have the extra storage space for videos.
If this can be done I would appreciate any info as to how to do this.
Thanks, Rick
