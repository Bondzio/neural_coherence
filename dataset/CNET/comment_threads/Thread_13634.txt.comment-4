There are a few solutions that might work.
The first one is pretty obvious and most people don't want to do this, but you could get a really long ethernet cable (CAT5) and run the cable from your router to your PS2.
Or you can share your internet connection from a computer in your house that is already on the wireless network (I don't know how to do this, but i believe it is possible).
Also Linksys makes a Wireless ethernet bridge, which connects to an ethernet port on a game console, or computer and sends and receives information via the wireless network ( http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?id=1056281391242&skuId=5732889&type=product ) has one but it is expensive.
There is also the WET11 Linksys wireless ethernet bridge, but I don't currently have a link to that.
I bet it is easy to find.
I believe that is cheaper as well.
Hope this helps
