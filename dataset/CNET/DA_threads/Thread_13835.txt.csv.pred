1.1.1	I have an IDE HDD with an SATA DVD/RW and it takes about 5 mins to boot .	St
1.1.2	Once it finally boots everything runs as smooth as a baby 's bottom .	St
1.1.3	But it just takes forever to boot up .	St
1.1.4	But when I unplug the SATA DVD rom and plug in a regular ide cd rom drive to the same cable as the HDD and set its jumper to slave it boots in seconds .	St

1.3.1	Well that 's a bummer , I have all kinds of DVD burners that are SATA and all kinds of hard drives that are IDE .	St

1.3.3	Thanks Bob , Beau	St
1.4.1	http : //www.geeks.com/details.asp ? InvtId=CX-ITS1002 The downside is it does n't give me 2 devices per IDE channel but it did allow me to use some cheaply acquired DVDRW drives .	St
