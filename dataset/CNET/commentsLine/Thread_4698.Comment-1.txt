i recently replaced the motherboard in my system and when i hook everything back up, i get an error that ntldr can't open multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1).
i know for a fact that absolutely nothing happened to the hard disk during transition, so i really don't think it could be a hardware problem, can anyone maybe point me in the right direction?
-motherboard is a socket 754 nvidia nforce 3-a w/ athlon 64-bit 3700+ -drive is a samsung 160gb sata disk.
-windows xp pro sp2 -2 gb ddr 400 ram any thoughts or assitance would be appreciated.
thanks.
