if i wanted such a tablet i might opt for the new dual boot windows and android thing instead to get more use from it.
tipping my hand i am in a company porting apps to android and get to play with a few more units that some folk however this model is just out and doesn't stand out in any way for us to ask for one.
some folk are returning pads as they discover what they are not or that it's video file compatibility isn't what folk expected.
tip: i use handbrake and settings found on the net for the tablet in question.
how to sum it up?
android tablets seem needy when it comes to care and feeding.
