<s> Ive been reading about this and it seems that there are alot of people against it. </s>
<s> But here is my situation. </s>
<s> I live on about an acre lot. </s>
<s> The house is mid yard, maybe towards the street alittle more. </s>
<s> Where im trying to get internet to is the shed, which is more of a game room, flatscreen, surround, ps3, desktop took to tv, slingbox, cable, yadda yadda. </s>
<s> I went out and bought a N router to put in the upstairs window to try to get a signal out there but is too weak. </s>
<s> On a good day i get like 10% of a signal. </s>
<s> SO what i did is i move the modem and router to the basement, and ran a CAT5E wire in piping under the ground and put a wall mount plate in so i can plug into it. </s>
<s> That works great. </s>
<s> unfortunalty i have more than one toy that requires the internet, plus id like to have &quot;wifi&quot; out there. </s>
<s> My network currently stands like this, ATT Modem Steamstream somthing or other goes to my D-Link DGL-4500, that creates the wifi in the house and plugs the house comp and office, and printer into it. </s>
<s> From my fouth port is the wire that goes all the way to the shed. </s>
<s> from the shed wall i have it going to my second router. </s>
<s> Linksys E2000. </s>
<s> Pluged into that i have the Desktop, PS3, Slingbox, and TV into it. </s>
<s> As well as the wifi which my laptop is currently connected to. </s>
<s> I turned of the firewall off the Linksys router and on the DHCP its assigning diffent IPs then my house router so there is no conflict. </s>
<s> Everything works great, The PS3 connects no problem, the desktop and tv is fine. </s>
<s> My only issue im haveing is my slingbox. </s>
<s> When im in the shed connected to the Linksys Router i have no problem streaming my cable from it. </s>
<s> But when i go inside and connect to my D-link it cant be found. </s>
<s> Im not sure if there is a different setting in the routers i need to change or what. </s>
<s> I know this was a long post. </s>
<s> but i felt that it was better to inculde all my details so i wouldnt be yelled at to just get a switch or hub, or to cancel out the second router. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help </s>
<s> I forgot to mention the firmware on my D-link DGL-4500 is Current Firmware Version : 1.22NA Current Firmware Date : 2010/01/19 Linksys E2000 Firmware Version: v1.0.00 My slingbox is a Slingbox PRO-HD Firmware Version 1.4.60 </s>
<s> We cover that setup in the forum sticky. </s>
<s> I apologize because the first link died and I haven't had time to replace the post. </s>
<s> Also I can't duplicate items in the sticky. </s>
