<s> Hello, I have a question regarding the compatibility of SATA II on my current rig. </s>
<s> I currently have a Seagate ST-3160023AS (Barracuda 7200.7 160 Plus, Serial ATA) as my primary drive. </s>
<s> I'm looking at getting a ST-3160812AS (Barracuda 7200.9 160, Serial ATA NCQ) which has SATA 2.0 w/NCQ as a second hard drive. </s>
<s> Will the 2nd Barracuda with SATA 2.0 w/NCQ be compatable with my computer, although the primary drive is only Serial ATA? </s>
<s> I plan on also purchasing Norton Ghost 10.0 and use that in conjuntion with the two drives. </s>
<s> IOW: Will the SATA II drive work on my computer? </s>
<s> ..with the SATA I cable? </s>
<s> ...with the SATA II cable? </s>
<s> ...with the SATA I to II converter cable? </s>
<s> ...or do I have to buy a SATA I hard drive? </s>
<s> I believe my motherboard is a ACPI Multiprocessor PC? </s>
