I want to use the All in Wonder TV card but the only output from the card is cable or S video. How do you convert that to component video or can you? Nordite

Unless we are talking about upconversion which is not true HD (might be close). Another way around this might be to get a video card with DVI output if your tv has dvi input connection. Just thinking out loud.

Yes if your TV has a DVI conector you can use that. The ATI HDTV wonder card works very good on XPSP2, with XPMCE there are some problems getting it working corectly. XPMCE won't use the analog tuner in the HD card, but will use the analog tuner in your All in Wonder TV card and the HD tuner in the HD card. Wiht OTA HDTV you need a good strong signal. her is alink with lots of info on HTPC. john http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/forumdisplay.php?f=26&page=1&sort=lastpost&order=&pp=35&daysprune=2
