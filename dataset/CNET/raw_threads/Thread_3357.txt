This should resolve your problem if not W2K, try XP type only if no W2K drivers. Post back with results. If the driver is presnt and all goes OK, but it seems still yet have another problem, try resetting the bios to SPP from ECP mode but only after proper driver is installed. tada -----Willy

Did a check and found no W2K drivers at Epson's support website. http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/supDetail.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=yes&oid=14388&prodoid=8255&infoType=Downloads&platform=Windows There are Windoze NT3.x and NT4, you can try that to see if it works. But, it appears the 800 model is too old and maybe considered only for win9x system. Its time to move-on, unless someone posts a deeper resolution to your problem. In many cases, no work around. That model printer just isn't supported no more into newer OSes. sorry tada -----Willy
