<s> My daughter is planning on giving me her old ibook. </s>
<s> I currently have 2 pc desktops. </s>
<s> Can an ibook and 2 pc desktops be easily put on a network with a wireless router? </s>
<s> I don't need to interact between the computers, I just want to be able for all 3 computers to use the Internet. </s>
<s> Any recommendations on which router to use? </s>
<s> I do know that the laptop is 802.11b technology. </s>
<s> Thanks for any info you can give me. </s>
<s> In fact, it was so easy that I don't have to research it. </s>
<s> I just set the Mac, PC, other thing to &quot;obtain an address&quot; or &quot;DHCP&quot; and that's it. </s>
<s> If one has secured the WIFI network, one will have to enter that information again to the new device. </s>
<s> However, if it doesn't work, set the WIFI network to open/unsecured to get it working then find if WEP works, etc... Bob </s>
