<s> I just got service with comcast for cable internet. </s>
<s> I have a zoom modem that works fine with my desktop pc. </s>
<s> When I hook it into my IBM Thinkpad T23 laptop, the browser will not display any web pages. </s>
<s> I get the page not found error. </s>
<s> I have installed the driver for the built in ethernet and the device manager says it is working properly. </s>
<s> There are 2 leds on the ethernet port. </s>
<s> One shows green and the other orange. </s>
<s> When I type IPCONFIG into the cmd box, It reports 0.0.0.0 for IP address and Subnet Mask. </s>
<s> I do not really know what this stuff means, but I do know that I cannot connect. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> If so, it locks onto your ethernet MAC address and will work on the next machine if you unplug and try again tomorrow. </s>
<s> Fix? </s>
<s> Get a router. </s>
