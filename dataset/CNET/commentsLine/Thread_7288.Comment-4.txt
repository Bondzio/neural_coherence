sorry but some machines like a dell need one more thing after i install the os, motherboard drivers and the wifi card driver.
it's called quickset and maybe your machine needs this or something like it.
i'm going to plead with all members to start making good posts.
include those make and model numbers to save you time and getting asked for the detail.
