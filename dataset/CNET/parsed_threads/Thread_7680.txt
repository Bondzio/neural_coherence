<s> I'm part of a Tech Support department of 50 located along the Gulf Coast. </s>
<s> In years past we have found hurricanes and other disasters may have forced Engineers to work from home or out of hotel rooms for several weeks. </s>
<s> Since that time we are now using VoIP phones that require a power over Ethernet (PoE) LAN connection. </s>
<s> Along with the phone we already have an external power brick that we can take home that supplies the PoE LAN connection. </s>
<s> However, that requires that you have access to the router so you can run a physical cable from the router to the power brick. </s>
<s> That's fine when you are at your own house and have access to your own router. </s>
<s> But in the case of a hotel, you can't run a cable to the router. </s>
<s> Many hotels have gone to wireless only and don't have a physical LAN jack to plug into. </s>
<s> So I've been looking at something like the Netgear WNCE3001 Dual-Band Internet Adapter. </s>
<s> That will supply a physical LAN connection from WiFi only. </s>
<s> But it does not have PoE. </s>
<s> So now if we are going to work from a hotel room, we need the VoIp phone, the power brick and the WiFi Internet adapter. </s>
<s> 3 seperate items to lug around. </s>
<s> Is there such a device that would allow you to pickup a WiFi signal in a hotel room and has a physical LAN jack that is also capable of PoE? </s>
<s> I could at least lose the power brick then. </s>
<s> I guess it depends what you mean by VoIP. </s>
<s> If all you want to do is make calls via internet many of the newer cell phones have the ability to make skype or other &quot;VoIP&quot; calls directly over a wifi network. </s>
<s> There are of course many phones that will directly talk to skype or vontage or whatever via wifi also. </s>
<s> Now if you mean you are using something like a H.323 or SIP based phone to connect to a corporate VoIP network then it gets more complex but there are phones that will connect directly via wireless it just gets complex if you have a vpn layer on top of it. </s>
<s> Lately I have been using a app that runs on a android based cell phone that lets me use SIP over WIFI to access a corporate network. </s>
<s> I found the maker of the PoE phones had solutions for things like this. </s>
<s> Your new IT staffers often forget to ask the makers about this so back to the PoE phone maker and see what they offer. </s>
