ive ordered the computer, i don't have it yet, i will have it tomorrow.
the os ill be installing will be windows xp, not that i dislike vista, but vista seems to take more resources that i don't need while gaming.
also if i check the official game webpages i often see that the minimal/requirement/optimal system page asks for a heavyer system when your os is vista and lower when your os is xp.
so if they say xp needs less powerfull system to get the same results then im not going to run vista because it prolly slows the system down a bit.
at least thats what my logic tells me, anyone let me know if i am wrong.
