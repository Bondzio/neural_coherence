i appreciated your help, but maybe i haven't explained what i'm interested in.
i simply want to purchase a router which will pass external ip addresses to an apache server log, or allow something like phpbb to associated external ip addresses to posts.
i just need to know what to look for when i'm shopping for a new router.
thanks.kah
