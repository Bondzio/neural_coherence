1.1.1	Hi , My current system comprises of the following , of which I am looking to upgrade the motherboard : Processor : 6.00 AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core Motherboard : ASUS M2A-VM1.XX Hard drive : Hitachi HDT 500Gig SATA 2 x 1G Ram NVIDIA GeForce 8500GT IEEE 1394 Firewire card I have 3 main uses for this PC , which are : 1 .	St
1.2.1	Why would the motherboard be an issue here ?	Ques
1.2.2	That is , is n't wiring something any skilled technician be able to handle and would n't have to find a motherboard with the exact pin for pin connections ?	Ques
1.2.3	Hint : There is no standard for the onboard audio connections .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I just assumed that because the motherboard in my pc does not have the pin for pin connectivity that I require that there would motherboards on the market that do .	St
1.3.2	Ian .	St
1.4.1	are you 'planning ' to reuse the CPU and the RAM or not .	St
1.4.2	If yes ... is your MB a socket 939 and what RAM are you using DDR , DDR2 and what speed ?	Ques
1.4.3	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	You will never find such a board besides the make or model you have now .	St
1.5.2	The internal connections for audio and a few others are not standardized so your skill at rewiring will come into play .	St
1.5.3	bob	St
1.6.1	Yes I am planning to reuse the CPU & the RAM .	St
1.6.2	The MB is socket AM2 & the ram is unbranded DDR2 & the only other numbers on each stick is 667 .	St
1.6.3	Unfortunately I can not find the invoice which lists the specific details of the pc 's components .	St
1.6.4	Hope this is helpful .	St
1.6.5	Ian	St
1.7.1	As Bob said no need for new motherboard to add a capture or sound card .	St
1.7.2	For info on your mobo download Belarc Advisor http : //www.belarc.com/free_download.html Find what free pci slots are available and buy the appropriate cards .	Sug
1.7.3	Choose a capture card that does not require a seperate audio connection , and problem solved .	St
1.7.4	My Compro Digital/Anolouge TV tuner capture card requires no connection to the sound card .	St
1.7.5	No doubt there others .	St
1.8.1	it 's up-to-date .	St
1.8.2	here 's the link for your motherboard ( mobo ) : http : //usa.asus.com/products.aspx ? l1=3 & l2=101 & l3=496 your mobo uses standardized usb pinouts .	St
1.8.3	if your firewire card has an internal port , it will be standardized also .	St
1.8.4	your mobo has front-panel audio port ( page 1-30 ) and an s/pdif port ( page 1-28 ) with simple and fully documented pinouts .	St
1.8.5	if you 're still having problems connecting your multifunction panel , you should replace it , and not the motherboard .	St
1.9.1	My apologies for not repling sooner , but I have been away this week .	St
1.9.2	Just like to say thanks to everyone for their replies .	Polite
1.9.3	I have taken on board all your comments and suggestions .	St
1.9.4	I can now plan what hardware I must have and find a way to achieving the connectivity that I require .	St
1.9.5	Regards Ian	St
