Hello, I am running a computer with Windows 7 Service pack 1 64 bit OS and I'm trying to install a wireless Canon MX420 printer.
My computer is connected to my router through an ethernet cord and I have managed to set up my printer's wifi just fine.
It appears connected on the printer's screen and I have disabled all firewalls on my computer yet it still won't detect it...
Please any help and insight would be appreciated.
