1.1.1	Hi, I am looking to replace my old Netgear rangemax wireless router WPN 824v2 with one that meets the following criteria: 1.	St
1.1.2	Good range, my router will be in the basement and my gaming computer is 2 floors up from here.	St
1.1.3	2.	St
1.1.4	Much better speed, 300+ would be good.	St
1.1.5	I have been looking at the Netgear wndr3700 is there a better one out there?	St
1.1.6	Thank you	St
1.2.1	Since all the advice is to not put WIFI routers in the basement you decided to do that in spite of all advice.	St
1.2.2	I don't think any router will deliver in this scenario.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Was received.	St
1.3.2	You ask NEW QUESTIONS so let's tackle those head on.	St
1.3.3	&quot; What do people do who work in large office buildings or apartment buildings regarding wireless routers.	Ques
1.3.4	Most likely they cannort have a router on each floor.	St
1.3.5	If I cannot relocate from the basement where it is now what would you recommend?	St
1.3.6	Maybe a bridge using 2 routers or what?	St
1.3.7	&quot; A bridge might have wifi on the other end.	St
1.3.8	I've noted AC POWERLINE BRIDGES that have wifi at one end which is a really nice and easy to setup solution.	St
1.3.9	And you could use 2 routers with some bridge but some folk are challenged by the configuration (which is noted in this forum's sticky post about post 18 or 19.)	Sug
1.3.10	The wndr3700 is a great choice but when we don't follow the maker's recommendations we often are disappointed.	St
1.3.11	Example at http://forum1.netgear.com/showthread.php?p=235362 Post 3 notes more.	St
1.3.12	You can try just one wndr3700 in the basement and have a backup plan if you are disappointed.	Sug
