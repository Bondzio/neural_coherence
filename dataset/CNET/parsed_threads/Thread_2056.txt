<s> I have an organization with a small network, maybe 10 PCs and a Windows 2000 server. </s>
<s> All workstations are XP. </s>
<s> I'd like to setup remote access to files from off-site. </s>
<s> I was considering VPN, but it seems you need two servers. </s>
<s> Is there a simpler solution for a small network? </s>
<s> We just want to be able to view and edit files from off-site. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> But let me share what we do when we don't use VPN. </s>
<s> We install OpenSSH on a server and open that one port to/from the internet and that server. </s>
<s> While it's not friendly we consider the security concerns to outwiegh the friendly aspects today. </s>
<s> Never give them an easy target. </s>
<s> You can also invest in VPN routers and servers. </s>
<s> But since the usual maker's websites suffice on that (as well as wikipedia) I'll pass on writing about VPN. </s>
