if you have win xp you should be ok with 512 ram, but if vista i would crank it up to 1 gb if not 2 gb.
i run 1 gb on win xp and can still use my computer while its doing its thing.
you might consider some external storage for your media.
on average it take 13 gb for one hour of raw video.
some crawfish etoufee would be sweet!
