I thought I'd go with a mini and conserve power and keep the heat down.
I'd also be able to get that IDE cable out of the tower and improve air flow.
I've found one for $14.00.
I saw them at CompUSA for $30.00.
The improvement might well be worth the expense, if I don't crash my system.
I do have the partial back up, however.
I'm also planning on getting Acronis but in the future not now.
Perhaps I should wait on the mini card and get Acronis first.
