<s> I am building a computer for the first time. </s>
<s> So far have decided: OS:Windows XP CPU:Intel Core 2 Duo E6700 Do I need to decide on chipsets now before choosing the motherboard? </s>
<s> Do I need to know what RAM first? </s>
<s> (I think 2GB DDR2 but don't know more yet, would also like to add more later) HDD will be either WD or Seagate SATA 250-500GB dependent on $ (not sure if you need to know this) Would like to add another HDD later (do I need RAID?) </s>
<s> Will need PCIE for sound card This is not for gaming just music production/sound engineering so basic graphics ok. Will not be used on internet or LAN. </s>
<s> Asus P5K seems popular but there are many different varieties. </s>
<s> Which one? </s>
<s> Thankyou, Anna </s>
<s> e6750 is about $205USD compared to $300USD for e6700: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=10005522 go with 2gb right off the bat since it's so inexpensive. </s>
<s> ocz gold ddr2-800, 2gb kit, $90 before $30 rebate: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=85236 the asus p5k motherboard series is a good choice as is the gigabyte ga-p35-ds series. </s>
<s> both have mobos in the $125-$150 range depending on features. </s>
<s> but if you don't need advanced 3d graphics, this gigabyte ga-g33m-s2 has the latest intel chipset, onboard graphics, the features that most people actually use, and is only $118: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=10006319 hard drive wise, 320gb and 500gb are the 'sweet spots': 250gb: $67 320gb: $75 ($8 for additional 70gb) 400gb: $100 500gb: $108 ($8 for additional 100gb) raid is a matter of preference. </s>
<s> If you are talking production, I believe you want to invest in RAID so you do not lose the music you produced because of disk failure that can happen just from random bad luck or heat. </s>
<s> Writing steady streams of digitized music, and read/write of large chunks of digitized music during audio editing can heat up a drive fast. </s>
<s> Everything you are buying is for creating the music. </s>
<s> It's the only valuable stuff. </s>
<s> Raid-5 starts with 3 HDDs; Raid-10 starts with 4. </s>
<s> Gets expensive! </s>
<s> However, I just read about the Data Robotics Drobo that provides the same protection as Raid-5 but starts with only two HDDs. </s>
<s> You can read about it on this PC World link.. http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,134339/article.html Cost of this box is pretty competitive. </s>
<s> Check it out. </s>
<s> Thankyou for the suggestions Drobo does sound really great and simple actually, and reliability is the biggest concern for me. </s>
<s> Is there anything stopping me just getting say a 320GB internal HDD now, then buying a Drobo a bit later on and another HDD and transferring the first one to the Drobo (when I have the $, and when prices down a bit)? </s>
<s> I am in NZ and am having trouble even finding a NZ price/seller for Drobo, and not sure whether it would be any cheaper to order things from US after shipping and tax included. </s>
<s> Also, if did do as I mentioned above (say use one HDD for a few months) would the kind of setup we are talking about be at much risk of overheating problems if in a regular sized box (mid-tower?)? </s>
<s> Would moving to the Drobo setup eliminate a lot of heating issues? </s>
<s> Thankyou again for your help, it is greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> Anna </s>
<s> Just checked out pricing, and will definitely choose the E6750 thankyou ramarc. </s>
<s> Also the gigabyte ga-g33m-s2 is mATX - which I am thinking means it is smaller than regular ATX? </s>
<s> Why not just ATX? </s>
<s> Would it make a difference in terms of heat? </s>
<s> Thankyou, Anna </s>
<s> mATX is microATX. </s>
<s> bigger boards are usually more expensive to manufacture so many desktop boards are now microATX. </s>
<s> microATX mobos still have the features that most people use (8 usb, firewire, 4 sata ports, 8 channel sound, etc)... full size ATX boards usually add things like on-board wi-fi, additional sata/ide ports, dual ethernet nics, dual graphics slots, etc. </s>
<s> if you're interested in raid, the GA-G33M-DS2R (the next step up) has raid support built-in. </s>
<s> all you need is add a second hard drive. </s>
<s> the DS2R uses intel matrix raid which allows you mix raid levels without only 2 drives. </s>
<s> so for $210 (dual 500gb drives) you could have a mirrored (raid-1) 200gb boot drive to store the OS and important files (e.g. </s>
<s> final masters), and striped (raid-0) 550gb to house the pagefile, temp/scratch areas, and work-in-progress. </s>
<s> GA-G33M-DS2R, $142: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=10005399&ref=lmcd </s>
