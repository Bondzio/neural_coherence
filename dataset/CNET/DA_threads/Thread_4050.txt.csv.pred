1.5.1	the following enclosure: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817153061 It come with everything you need including the internal SATA to bracket with eSATA connector and eSATA cable to eSATA enclosure Looks like a decent unit from Thermaltake with active cooling for those that leave their externals HDDs on.	St
1.5.2	I only use mine for backup and afterwards remove the cables and turn 'em off.	St
1.5.3	The nice thing about the Adaptec units was they could handle HDDs up to 1TB for the last 3-4 years whereas other USB-eSATA enclosures were capacity limited to smaller drives.	St
