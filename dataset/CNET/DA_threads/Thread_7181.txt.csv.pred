1.1.1	hello , I just built a new system with an abit kd7a board and an AMD athlon 2200 cpu .	St
1.1.2	a few questions -- the CPU speed is setting up as 1500 mhz , is this correct or is it defaulting to a slower speed ?	Ques
1.1.3	( I ca n't find info on the ghz speed of this 2200 cpu anywhere ! )	St
1.1.4	note i do not want to overclock .	St
1.1.5	.	St
1.1.6	.	St
1.1.7	and , should I bother to clear the cmos memory ?	Ques
1.1.8	thanks - fj	Polite
1.2.1	For a 2200+ , 1500mhz seems a bit low .	St
1.2.2	Maybe you should jack it up to 133mhz fsb .	St
1.3.1	I wish they would give the specs someplace .	St
1.4.1	didnt you get manuel with board or call supplier as its a needed item	St
1.5.1	well finally long weekend is over and I called AMD and they gave it to me over the phone -- gee whiz , what a silly thing for both board and chip manufacturer to leave out !	St
1.5.2	- fj	St
1.6.1	Actual CPU mhz speeds are only a search away on the internet .	St
1.6.2	Google Search keywords : & quot ; Athlon 2200+ mhz & quot ; 2200+ Athlon = 1.8Ghz ( 133Mhz FSB x 13.5 ) Motherboards are generally set to 100Mhz FSB as this is the lowest FSB used by the AMD Durons that the boards can use .	St
1.6.3	By having it set as 100Mhz default allows every CPU to work at boot up without danger , but of course old Althons need the FSB increased to 133 , and new XP lettered Athlons need this increased to 166Mhz .	St
1.6.4	G .	St
