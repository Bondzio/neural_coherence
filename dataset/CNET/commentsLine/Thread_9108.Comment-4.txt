wow roger, sounds like a lot of fun!
intermitents in anything can be a nightmare.
have you checked the inverter(most lcd's use one) could be iffy connectivity there that is the first place i would look.if that isn't the problem, like bob said, get out your jeweler's loop and check solder joints but i wouldn't put a lot of time into it.
it is just a fair monitor to begin with.
good luck!
