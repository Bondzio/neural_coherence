<s> I recenetly had to wipe my hard drive. </s>
<s> I am trying to reinstall my external Ezhub external drive and can't get it to instal. </s>
<s> I have the installation disk. </s>
<s> When I try to run it I get an error that says &quot;Can't open file D:\setup.exe access denied&quot;. </s>
<s> Can anyone offer some advise? </s>
<s> I've found a few borken'ed installers that we have to work around such things. </s>
<s> I have tried it in two different drives, still the same thing. </s>
<s> No OS noted, is the OS have it's own service packs installed, why was the OS wiped, what &quot;protection software&quot;, any firewall, Peer guardian and the list goes on and on. </s>
<s> Tell more. </s>

<s> I'm running Windows XP. </s>
<s> I have downloaded the latest smart pack. </s>
<s> I have a firewall running, disk drives work for everything else. </s>
<s> If this matters, when I restart my pc I get an box open up for the EZ Dub disk but then it tells me I need to install the Nero software first. </s>
<s> But when I try to load the installation cd I get the error message posted above. </s>
<s> Maybe you need to uninstall ezdub, and install nero first? </s>
<s> Remember I don't have answers to why the OS was reinstalled, if the reinstall has all the drivers for the machine and more. </s>
<s> For example I'm working with assumptions such as the Nero CD is the retail version. </s>
