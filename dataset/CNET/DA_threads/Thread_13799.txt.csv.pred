1.1.1	I have Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit with a GA-EP45-UD3P ( Rev 1.0/1.1 ) motherboard .	St
1.1.2	When I play games I get a BSOD STOP 0x0000001E .	St
1.1.3	It occurred to me I did n't install all my drivers or the new BIOS for my system since updating to Windows 7 64-bit .	St
1.1.4	I have installed all current hardware drivers , but when I try to install the BIOS it says it is not compatible with 64-bit and to contact the company .	St
1.1.5	I have contacted them , but without a reply .	St
1.1.6	Is windows just saying it is n't compatible when I try to run the update in windows , but really is compatible if I used a disk to update the bios ?	Ques
1.1.7	Thank you !	St
1.1.8	http : //www.gigabyte.us/Support/Motherboard/Driver_Model.aspx ? ProductID=2914	Ques
1.2.1	The ability to update the BIOS while Windows is running is a very new trick .	St
1.2.2	I 'm not trying to offend you but if you think back just a few years such updates were done with DOS boot diskettes for years and arcane command lines .	St
1.2.3	It 's improved but I have no qualms with a boot CD or diskette to do this update .	St

1.3.1	I just updated the BIOS on my GIGA-BYTE P55-UD3R while running Win 7 Pro 64 bit and it went without incident .	St
1.3.2	VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	Thanks for the input , I appreciate it .	St
1.4.2	However , I think my question was misunderstood , it 's an odd question .	St
1.4.3	I was trying to ask if , since I tried to update the BIOS within Windows , would it give me a message stating the BIOS update was not compatible with 64-bit windows , EVEN THOUGH it was actually compatible IF I used an alternative method to Windows .	St
1.4.4	So in essence , should I try to update the BIOS with a USB drive ( since that 's all I have ) even though when I tried to update within Windows it said it was not compatible ?	Ques
1.4.5	Hopefully that 's a little more clear .	St
1.5.1	Still a very new trick .	St
1.5.2	I expect it to not always work .	St
1.5.3	Hope that 's clearer .	St
1.5.4	Bob	St
1.6.1	floppy disk but when I ran the program ... the file was too large for a for a floppy disk .	St

1.6.4	VAPCMD	St
