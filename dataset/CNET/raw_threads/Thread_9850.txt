I am trying to configure it for my LAN which has a DIALER. &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt;The links are as follows: &lt;span&gt; http://connect.net.pk/home.php &lt;span&gt; http://dialer.connect.net.pk/dialer/...nnectGreen.exe &lt;span&gt;or http://dialer.connect.net.pk/dialer/...nnectRed7V.exe &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt;I tried to configure my NG but it is unable to connect to the network on its own. I have to use CONNECT dialer from my PC to connect which is useless because I can't use my wi-fi enabled devices to access network. &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Please give me some tips / solutions. &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Thank you. &lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt;PS: I will attach the settings used by my dialer soon. I'm unable to find right option to upload the image files.
