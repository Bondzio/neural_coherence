<s> ok, so i updated these drivers for my nvidia video card, and in installation it said that it hadnt passed windows logo testing, and could harm the computer, and i asked someone about this and hey said not to worry about it, so i continued to install the driver.it finished, and it seemed to be working fine, but then the computer started acting weird, so i shutdown, and when i started it up again, and the message said there was keyboard failure,and i got on to the computer, and everything was normal...except of course the fact that my keyboard had stopped working, can anyone ell me if there is a way to fix this? </s>

<s> or exclamations marks in the listing. </s>
<s> If not, then click on the keyboard. </s>
<s> Right click on each of the listed keyboards to see if the new driver is listed as being used. </s>
<s> When you find the suspect driver, tell it to roll back the driver to the previous driver. </s>
<s> If that does not fix your problem, try system restore and roll back to a date before the problem occurred. </s>
