But sometimes...when users have no backup or quick restore, and they can't get their system running efficiently, users take the path of least resistance ...wipe the HDD and reinstall the OS and the APPs.
Thats fine for store-bought PCs that have easy installs and few apps... but when you build your own, the last thing most of us want to do is reinstall it all.
I don't reformat because I've got image backups that can be put back in as little as 15 minutes ... the OS, the drivers, the apps, prefernces, favorites, all the data ... everything.
