i have vista for os and i have been battling with trying to get the cd to play for 2 days now.
i have gotten the program to appear on the screen but when i push say,+ part one fractions or any of the commands, table of contents..nothing i have installed or tried to upgrade my quicktime like it instructed but i get an error.500 i changed my default once to try ie and when that didn't work i change the default to foxfire.
i went and downloaded directx sample browser to tell you the truth i don't know what prompted me to do that, should i uninstall?
i click on computer and right click the dvd introductory and still no results and i don't know what else to do.
this all for trying to prep for getting into college, scary huh?
i'd give anything to be knowledgable on the computer.
please help me
