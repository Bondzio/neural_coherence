as most of us know, dell cannot recommend third-party options for upgrading any hardware - thus the hardware that comes with it remains... however, i have heard that you can replace the existing psu (power supply unit) with a third-party one (such as a thermaltake, antec, etc).
however, i have also heard that such psu's are not compatible with the dell motherboard.
which of these are true?
i don't want to ruin my system - thanks.
btw, i have a dell xps 410
