I just bought the apple Mini about 5 months ago and know I want to graduate to a G5 computer.

Then got the news that Steve Jobs has announced the marriage of Macs with Intel. And I was the unhappiest man on earth for having bought this Dell thing. Personally speaking, I hate windows for the heavy maintenance it requires to keep away the viruses, defragment drives and clean up the registry. Still, I went for it just because all the software I already have runs only on Windows. The fact remains that Mac users spend most of their time in productivity with their computer, whereas Win Doze users spend their time doing useless things - which doesn't come as a surprise taking into account the design and vulnerabilities of the operating system. In fact, I'm willing to buy entire new set of mac versions of all the software I have... because it'll save my time tremendously! At least I won't get a notification every two hours - ''Norton Internet Security : A recent attempt to attack your computer was blocked. Click here for details''. But now there's hope, and I am definitely going to wait until Steve announces shipping of MacIntels. I'll sell Dell and buy a MacIntel. If Apple decides to release Mac Os Leopard that can run on my existing Dell laptop (as Michael Dell wants Steve Jobs to do), I would be very happy to keep the existing laptop and get rid of windows. (By the way Steve Jobs is the CEO of Apple Computers, and Michael Dell is the CEO of Dell Computers)

I too want to know whether to wait for the new Intel chip machines or just go ahead and buy a Powerbook now? The only 2 posts so far are either cheerleading or kvetching about Windows - I just want the facts. Will the Intel units be worth the wait? Will they be a quantum leap? Or, buy the current unit and save money when the new ones come out? I want some real comparisons - will I regret buying a Powerbook now?

One thing to keep in mind is that the first rollout of any new technology is often fraught with bugs, etc that can take a while to sort out. I'd be leery of buying the first generation of Intel-based macs until I'm convinced that they run reliably and my main software applications (such as Pro-Tools) etc runs well on it. The g5's are going to be around for awhile, so I think they are a good investment.

However, it would be extremely difficult to compare an Intel Powered Mac, which does not exist in the wild, with a IBM powered Mac, which does. Unless, of course, you have inside knowledge of what is going to be driving the Intel powered Macs. I merely answered the question: Should I buy or should I wait. Not exactly cheerleading. P
10496	7	128550	1462521	1462147	URTido	10/7/05 12:18 PM	1.12868748E12	Current today, expired tomorrow	Technology moves at a pretty good pace, especially computers. I too am debating an upgrade, and here is more or less my take on upgrading now versus waiting until the MacIntel machines come out: 1) What are you working with now? - In my case I have a 800 MHz iBook which made me fall in love with OSX and want to switch permanently from Windows to the Mac. I'm starting to run low on hard drive space, but otherwise my current system meets my needs. 2) How often do you plan to replace/upgrade your computer? - Desktops are fairly easy to make upgrades to, but not so for a laptop. Ideally I'd like to replace my computer with the next to latest and greatest every 2-3 years. Therefore, if I bought a new Mac with PowerPC processor now, in 2-3 years I would replace it with a new machine which by then would be a MacIntel. 3) Software - The full change from PowerPC to Intel based software is going to take a year or two. Many programs will likely work fine with Rosetta (albeit slow), but running natively on the computer will always be faster. Therefore, getting a PowerPC based Mac now means that when you replace your computer all of the software should be fully rewritten to run on Intel processors. 4) Money - Replacing your computer is an expensive thing to do; though not as bad as if it were a car. Still, if you have no use for your old system there's always eBay or other online sales sites to sell your computer on in order to offset the cost of a new machine. The newer the machine you're selling, the more money you'll get for it. Wait too long and you'll need to pay someone to dispose of your computer or recycle it. - If you get a desktop computer, such as the PowerMac G5, invest in a good display, keyboard, and mouse, as these peripherals can be reused on future systems after upgrading the tower. So the bottom line, if your current system is out dated, upgrading to a new PowerPC based Mac is a sound investment because you should be able to get at least some of your money back to go towards an Intel based Mac once the bugs are worked out.

If you continue to wait for the next &quot;bigger and better&quot; technology you might as well have stayed with pencil and paper. From what I've read about it, the next Intel PC microprocessor (the one that will go into the next generation of Macs) will not be that much of a technological improvement over the G4s and G5s. It will finally have a better power management, AND it will just allow Apple to compete on the (silly) GHz race.
10496	9	128550	1462881	1462625	cadedraco0093	10/7/05 3:22 PM	1.12869852E12	You never know but ......	Well a mac that is 3 ghz would be nice, the g5s out now are as good as it will get for macs right now. Even the Intel macs will have some bugs to work out and it will take them a while to get the machines as reliable as the g5s are now. If your might think about getting a laptop, the same is preety much true. While the g4 isn't the best chip, the new powerbooks will be able to keep up for a long while, and even if IBM manages to get a mobile g5 chip, it won't be for a long time, and even then it won't be much more powerful than the g4's. So buying now isn't a bad idea, or at least not one that you will regret. I even just ordered a 15-in. Powerbook which has a better preformance than the old power mac g4 I'm typing on right now.

If you need a new computer now, buy it now. If you're okay with your machine now and simply want to try out a Mac for giggles, wait until the MacIntels come out. Please be aware that most Mac sites with discussions devoted to this expect the initial MacIntels to be the consumer machines (iMac, eMac, iBook, Mini). If you're looking for a pro grade machine, buy now. Also be aware that the MacIntels aren't expected for another year though that could change. Rumors - RUMORS - have it that OS X on the development Pentium 3.2's absolutely screams but there are no video or sound drivers optimized for it so those both lag significantly.
10496	11	128550	1463377	1462126	bblackley	10/7/05 9:07 PM	1.12871922E12	None of us &quot;outsiders&quot; know	The move to a Mac based Intel chip machine is eagerly awaited by some and mourned by others. In theory, changing out the Motorola chips for Intel chips shouldn't decrease performance, as the technology for Intel and Motorola ought to be competitive. And if Intel chips can run OS X, it won't be like you're buying a Windows box which performs like a Windows box (or trading in your Cadillac Mac for a Pinto Macintel, as some would say). The ultimate answer is most of us Mac enthusiasts -- and I am pretty hardcore -- don't know what the future will bring. The theory I subscribe to is the wait plus one model before buying. Here's what I mean: The first boxes to come out are bound to be &quot;glitchy&quot; (do any of you guys remember the constant freezes and HD problems of the first blue and white G3 USB Macs?) as the new hardware and software work out the glitches in their young marriage. The next model (NOTE, the SECOND generation release) should boast improvements and enough stability to merit making the buy, though you'll want to watch the reviews to see what happens. Apple went to Intel to get a cheaper chip and to bring costs down learning something from what happened with the Mac Mini (We have one at work and it's an impressive little bugger for the dough). By waiting for an Intel Mac, you'll probably be saving some cash. Now is any of this absolutely assured to happen? Well, of course not. These are computers in all their glitchy and techno-driven glory. So in concluding, I'd say wait a year if your current unit will hold out that long. If not, take the plunge now and look at upgrading in 24-36 months to the Macintel unit. Hey, even if Macintels suck, they are bound to be better than Wintel machines if for no other reason than the Unix core OS and the fact that hackers don't seem as intent on manufacturing Mac viruses and worms.

The loyal user brainwashed to shell out more dough for completely new hardware. Back from the Apple III, Lisa attraction. Upgrade Mac 128K to 512 K does not came from Apple. You need some good 3rd party supplier. Future bus, SCSI different connectors, Even ADB to USB KBD and mouse. Apple do not care user's early investment. Apple will always try to maximize the profit and get those fat cat fatter.

Apple performs because each machine is optimized to get the most out of its native architecture and loaded OS at the given time. Apple sticks to a price point to make money... smaller company needs a higher profit per machine to stay afloat. Apple has been slower to adopt some features as &quot;standard&quot; opting to make them an add on upgrade instead, to boost their profits. Apple tries to put out the best product they can for a profit margin that keeps them afloat and allows Jobs to vacation where ever he wants, when ever he wants. This is true. I wish I could build a mac from off the shelf parts like a pc but you can't. As for Macintel... I'll wait for the bugs to be worked out but thats just because I'm still waiting on my fortune to come in. grim

While Mr. Jobs did receive that massive grant, and he also was given a jet worth some $84 million, this is the only compensation Mr. Jobs has received from Apple since returning to the helm of the company in 1997. In addition, Mr. Jobs' grant vests over three years, meaning that they do not become fully his until March of 2006. That moves his total compensation for 10 years of service to Apple to approximately $158.8 million, or $15.9 million per year.&quot;&quot;&quot; http://www.macobserver.com/article/2004/12/28.2.shtml A little bit more than $1.00...

Heck, the G4 is so hot I bought a chill mat for my iBook to avoid roasting my chestnuts on the couch while I check my email. Extra generation of heat also uses up battery power.

My Dell Inspiron 7500 (Pentium II) came with Win 98SE, and it crashed or froze so frequently that my friends got tired of hearing me complain, and said to upgrade to XP, as it was far more stable. I did. It is. BUT they didn't tell me that this system was bordorline capable of running it, & that it would be s o o o o o slow! My c64 system was as quick; didn't have as much capability, but did what I needed. I do like what else I can do with this Dell XP system, just deplore spending almost as much time waiting as working. Therefore, I have been considering a G5, but dread the chore of converting my files and getting Mac versions of my Win software. Then I wondered about putting Windows on the Mac so I could continue using my existing softwars, BUT worry about the posibility of this combo just being a more expensive continuation of &^#$*(*&(@ speech results that my wife complains about. Anyone have any experience with a G5 running XP vs starting over with all Apple software? (PS I really don't want to replace a computer every 2-3 years - nor can I afford to.) My main goal is for it to keep on working at a reasonable speed.

Obviously the more ooomph you have in the G5, the better it will run. It will NEVER be a gaming machine though. What software do you have that is so important to you that you cannot afford to part with it? You are going to be spending around 15K for top range iMac G5 and maybe more if you go for the PowerMac G5. P

Currently the top of the line powermac G5s are liquid cooled because they need to be. The processor module on a dual processor G5, when ordered from apple, includes the liquid cooling, and is actually bigger than a mac mini. on the iMac G5 the Bus speed is reduced so it doesn't require as much cooling, but it's certainly no PowerMac in comparison. A Pentuim M processor would allow apple to move forward with a &quot;G6&quot; powerbook in the near future.
