<s> I have multi harddrives with operating systems on them. </s>
<s> I access each one through Bios. </s>
<s> I just went to access the one with Vista on it and it says NTLDR file is missing. </s>
<s> But if I access it with out the other hard drives connected I can get through. </s>
<s> Could some one help me out please. </s>
<s> Wendell H </s>
<s> XP has been known to look at other drives after boot and mark them &quot;non-bootable.&quot; How did you stop XP from doing that and breaking your boot method? </s>

<s> I access all my hard drives with operating system on them through Bios. </s>
<s> I go to Advanced Bios Features. </s>
<s> For instance my main drive is a WD 74 gig 10,000 rpm HD XP. </s>
<s> So I have &gt; 1st boot set as SCSI Snd boot set as CDrom 3rd boot set as Floopy and then I have it set on Sata To get to my other HD XP. </s>
<s> I just change the 1st boot to HDD and leave all the rest the same. </s>
<s> To get to my HD with Vista on it I Change 1st boot to SCSI 2nd boot to CDrom 3rd boot to Floopy and put it on Raid And I have one hard drive with know operating system on it for storage. </s>
<s> The other night I unlocked all my hard drives from my main drive which has XP on it and did a through maintenance and ran Avast and I deleted a trojan from my Vist hard drive and I wondered if that was my problem wiht my Vista hard drive. </s>
<s> I was not having problems with it before. </s>
<s> Wendell H </s>
<s> I don't see how you fix that XP issue and now we find out there is a trojan. </s>
<s> Either issue has you looking at XP/otherOS repair procedures. </s>
<s> Just look at google.com and links about NTLDR and your error message. </s>
<s> I won't repeat prior discussions about this but wonder how you get around the item I've run into. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I am still trying to find out what is wrong with all hard drive hooked up and not being able to get on just one drive that has Vista on it. </s>
<s> How can I get that file NTLDR and install it. </s>
<s> Thank You Very Much Wendell H </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=VISTA+NTLDR+REPAIR&btnG=Google+Search Remember I don't duplicate web content. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thank You for your help, I searched around on the site that you gave me and I tried a few tips. </s>
<s> The only tip I did not take until last was the one about changing hardware the easiest one. </s>
<s> I took out my storage drive to put in a larger HD, and to do that I had to remove two raid cables. </s>
<s> 1)One to the HD I was replacing with a larger HD 2) One That had Vista RC1 on it. </s>
<s> I got the cables switched up, and that what was causing me to get that error message. </s>
<s> Well I did not have to do what I usualy do is to reinstall the operating system. </s>
<s> Which it would not made a difference. </s>
<s> I Thank You For Your Help Wendell H </s>
<s> All of the OSes I know of don't like moving the hard disks around. </s>
<s> Most lose their OS, some lose their files. </s>
<s> The more seasoned owners have backups. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> All my programs are backed up, the big issue is I do not have a partion recovery with the back ups on it yet. </s>
<s> I am working on that now to see exactly how I am going to do that and what software I am going to use. </s>
<s> Having a partion recovery would save me a lot off time when I do not have to install software and updates. </s>
<s> Trying to make a decision on which software to use to help me make a partion or have another HD to install my operating system and software from. </s>
<s> I have read this article bellow. </s>
<s> http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2014359,00.asp Thank You: Wendell H </s>
<s> Even with partition and drive backup software let's take the scenario of moving a partition from one machine to another. </s>
<s> One machine had the XP partition (working) on a second drive. </s>
<s> The new machine will have it as the boot drive. </s>
<s> No tool today can move the partition and have the OS boot. </s>
<s> The activation issue is not the issue here and you'll likely see the NTLDR message. </s>
<s> Keep at this and you'll discover this is one of those areas. </s>
<s> Maybe a better plan is to backup our stuff but install the OS and programs? </s>
<s> In closing, one word. </s>
<s> ACRONIS. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I misunderstood what I read on the article Recovery Partition. </s>
<s> I went to Acronis site and read some more there besides reading the article on Cnet. </s>
<s> It said it could make an exact copy off your HD. </s>
<s> I will purchase this software. </s>
<s> Thank You for your help: Wendell H </s>
