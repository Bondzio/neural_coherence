I am looking to buy a multifunction photo printer.I have heard that Epson are leaders in printers but now Cannon has new technology.
I think I have narrowed down the search between the Cannon MP950 and the Epson RX700.
I had photos printed on the RX700 but not on the MP950.
The Cannon has a DPI of 9600 X 2400 and the Epson has 5760 BY 1440.
What does that really mean?
I printed pictures on the Cannon IP6600D(on Epson photo paper) which is also has a DPI of 9600 X 2400 and the Epson pictures looked clearer and had brighter clors.Will the Cannon look better on the Cannon paper?
I am so confused.
