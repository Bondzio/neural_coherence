many times the person installed the os to boot from the older drive.
microsoft did not provide a way to move the os from drive to drive (and have it function.)
no one else has provided such software either.
from what's been told, all is as it should be.
it is possible the drives are misconfigured.
not everyone will research about the ide cables, jumpers, bios settings.
i can't comment further given the limiter information in your post except to note that at 5 years old, many machines did not support booting from 250gb drives.
