1.1.1	I have a Belkin Pre-N Wireless Router and can get online and have an Type 2 NAT with the Playstation 3 Network , but if I try to play Resistance Fall of Man On-line multiplayer all the other players do n't look like they are running , they sort of appear in one spot and then appear in a new spot while making a clicking sound .

1.1.2	I know its the router because it worked fine with my old router .	St
1.1.3	Is there some setting that I need to chage on the Belkin to allow for smoth online play with Resistance ?	Ques
1.1.4	Thanks !	St

1.2.4	Configure the router for 802.11g only if you can .	St
