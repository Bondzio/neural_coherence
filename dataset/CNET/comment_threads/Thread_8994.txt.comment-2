Maybe the wifi is turned off?
Tell the forum the FN KEY you use or switch to turn it off and on.
I find some owners don't want to know this area of the machine but let's try this question and hope you know.
Also there are folk that wipe the drive and install some other Windows and don't tell.
Do tell the full story.
