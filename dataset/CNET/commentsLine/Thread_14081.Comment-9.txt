hi, first you need to know what manufacture made the hard drive.
you can try and go to the hard drives website and see if they have a small hard drive program that will automatically setup your hard drive for you to run on your system.
most of the hard drive companies have a program for this.
also check to make sure your system bios is up to date.
many system bios are not up to date, by the time you get the new pc up and running an update is already out.
hopefully your system is new enough to run large hard drives.
if you submit more info as to the name of your hard drive, with model,the name of your pc (compaq 4300, ibm , ect.
)name and model i can get you the info you need.
