ok... my bios has the date of 10/17/2001... the latest iwill update has a file name of kar1017b.exe ist that the same bios version as mine, or does the &quot;b&quot; mean that it is newer?
let's say it is a newer version, how do i actually update the bios?
iwill's site has instructions that look rather complicated..... is there an &quot;easy&quot; way or will i be playing with batch files for a while.. thanks!
