we have 3 computers networked via cable modem.
two desktops, one laptop.
the laptop has lost browser capability, and i'm not able to find what the problem is.
i've run norton, adaware, no-adware, and done a system restore.
nothing is working... does anyone have any idea's on what may have caused this and how to fix it?
i'll appreciate your input.
thanx
