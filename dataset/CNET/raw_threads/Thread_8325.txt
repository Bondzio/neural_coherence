I recently purchased a new system from a random dealer and thought I would be happy with just average. My problem is this, It gets old looking at the hourglass all the time more than I think I should have to. I dont have many programs in the background and I keep my system clean daily from spyware, reg probs and other slow downs. I know its a lousy system atm but here is what i have. - 3200 sempron (I know, Iknow ) - asus socket 939 motherboard - ati chpipset (dont like nvidia) - 1 gig 3200 400mhz ram - ultra ata 133 HD (I cant aford 2x WD raptors on a raid 0 config lol) - ATI x550se - pci-e (added this) These are the main thing i am working with here. I dont want to drop alot fo cash on this system but I want to replace a few peices to make my daily internet and gaming use runnning smooth enough. I play WoW so nothing that is graphically strenuous. I like to play at mid high setting and I can raid in a high end guild quite easily. Processor is a big concern but I just want someones knowledge as to what should really be my first priority because a higher processor with a sub par things around it is usless. I have run several benchmarks on my system after several tweaks I have done. I have used SiS sandra and PC Mark05, keep cpuz and passmark's performance test (I get roughly a 310 score) I know its a convoluted questiosn but I just dont want to drop money on parts that are going to make the biggest diff. Any information anyone can provide would be awesome

Anyways, your motherboard is a 939 socket which is nice so you can upgrade the processer, and check out the ati x800 all in one its a nice card for overall computing, and just buy an external harddrive, i have seen nice 200-300gb ex hardrives for around $200 dollars.

If dma shows off then turn it on, exit out and test. If dma shows on, turn it off, exit out, go back and turn dma on, exit out and test. Some folks have a whole bunch of unnecessary tasks and processes running in the background...dead weight. I'm not an XP user but I suspect if you were to search around in the forums for how to shutdown unnecessary task/processes you might get some hints.
