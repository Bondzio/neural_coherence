ok i whent out and got a 512mb chip for my computer (compaq 4410us sdram 168 pin), first i thought the chip was bad because after instaling it, the computer only read 64mb and was slow as all hell.
turns out each of the two slots in my computer can only support up to 256mb... so i still only got 265mb in there and a 512mb chip i can use or return.
my question is could placing this 512 chip in my computer have damaged it?
if so where could i get it tested?
