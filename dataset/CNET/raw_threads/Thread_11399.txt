I am curious as to whether or not to leave my computer on mostly or not. One item is that I read that keeping connected to the internet makes me more vulnerable. Another is how much electricity that uses. I wonder if anyone has any idea of what size of light bulb might use about the same amount? I ask that way because technical data would be hard for me to understand and compare. Not very important.

I am wondering if there is away, after I do that, to disconnect from the internet but still have my computer running. AFter connect by clicking on one of those browsers, I can click on the X and close the browser window but I am still online.

No one can tell you an exact answer. Here's the Note in case you missed it: Note: If you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem.

If I had, I would have had yet another reason to call myself an idiot. I'm installing Vonage broadband phone service and I got to wrongly thinking that I'd have to have my computer on in order to use the phone sevice, as though the phone would be connected to the computer, when, in fact, I'll have a phone adapter with one cable going to the computer and the other to the phone. However, I am still curious about the question of how much electricity my computer uses when it is on. I have a DEll Dimension 3400, Intel Premium 4 CPU, IE6, Windows XP. Should I provide anything else? One reason I don't provide that information when I should is that I forget, a very common habit which is getting worse as I get older. Another is that I never have collected that information in one place, in my case in MS Works, so that I can easily copy it. For example, to provide the above information, I had to spend quite a while trying to remember or figure out where it was. I couldn't recall what the model of Dell Dimension I have and it's not on the computer and my owner's manual is somewhere. I now want to collect all the information in a document in Works. You might let me know what information besides the above it would be a good idea for me to have handy. Thanks.

That revealed enough that I can find http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/corporate/environ/3400MP.pdf which states the average power draw to be in that range. That usually doesn't include a monitor but you can guess about a the same for Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) models and about 1/3 that for an LCD. Hope this is close enough for you. Cheers, Bob

You should also be able to copy the report into Works and save a copy. Good luck! http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html

The website for Belarc is &quot;www.belarc.com/free_download.html&quot;...just copy and paste it into your browser. (It was blocked in Alan's post because it contains the word ''free,'' which apparently evil. To avoid this, drop off the ''http://'' to stop the automatic linking feature.) However, I prefer another free program, Everest, whcih can be downloaded by clicking here . Hope this helps, John
