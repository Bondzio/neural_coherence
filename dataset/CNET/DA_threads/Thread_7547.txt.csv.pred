1.1.1	Periodically , my ethernet connection drops on my MacBook -- 2.16 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo , 4GB Memory , 10.5.8 .	St
1.1.2	I also have a iMac and a ThinkPad hooked up to the same router , and they never experience this problem .	St
1.1.3	The router is a Linksys WRT54G2 V1 with Firmware : DD-WRT v24-sp2 ( 01/01/09 ) micro-plus .	St
1.1.4	The outage seems to happen most frequently when I am doing a large file transfer or watching online video .	St
1.1.5	This used to happen every few days , now it is happening more and more frequently .	St
1.1.6	After it goes down , the port seems to close and I need to restart the machine to restore its ability to connect to the internet .	St
1.1.7	Where should I begin ?	Ques
1.1.8	( It is not the cable , for starters ... )	St
1.2.1	1 .	St
1.2.2	Another machine on that cable .	St
1.2.3	2 .	St
1.2.4	If it is your machine , post in one of the Apple forums for ideas about OS repairs .	St
1.2.5	If you enabled a firewall in the Apple , reconsider your choice .	St
1.3.1	Thanks , tried my ThinkPad on the cable , it works fine .	St
1.4.1	Connect with wifi .	St
1.5.1	Is this a solution ?	Ques
1.5.2	Or will this help diagnosis the problem ?	Ques
1.5.3	If the former -- I actually want to fix this problem , not circumvent it .	St
1.6.1	If you want it fixed , take it to the Apple repair counter .	St
1.6.2	You have proved to me it 's that machine .	St
1.6.3	As it could be a board issue and you demand a fix then let 's get to the right counter .	St
1.6.4	Otherwise try the Cnet Apple forums and ask about the OS repair .	Sug
1.6.5	Then again I 've run into folk that DEMAND to know if that will fix it .	St
1.6.6	For the demanding types you have to go back to what will absolutely fix it .	St
1.6.7	That is the apple repair counter or a new machine .	St
1.6.8	Bob	St
