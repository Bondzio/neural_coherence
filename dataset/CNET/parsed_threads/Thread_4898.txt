<s> Hiya - I'm looking for an LCD screen, preferably internal, but not a necessity, 8.75-9&quot;, traditional shape not widescreen, that would be compatible with a G4 iBook. </s>
<s> If not directly compatible, if it's just a connector problem, if an adapter of some sort is available or could be fashioned, that'd be close enough for jazz. </s>
<s> Does anyone know of something that'd fit the bill? </s>
<s> That sells for a reasonable price? </s>
<s> Not an immediate rush, got a few more things to take care of before the screen's needed, but it'd be good to know for when I get there. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> 9&quot; is not a size that would fit any G4 iBook though. </s>
<s> Remember that screen size is measured diagonally. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> Yeah, I know - it won't fit in an iBook. </s>
<s> iBook uses a 12&quot; screen. </s>
<s> It'd be crazy to stick a 9&quot; screen in there. </s>
<s> But it _would_ fit in an empty Mac SE case that's been given the Retro-Bright treatment - and so would the logic board of the iBook, the battery, the DVD drive, a USB floppy drive, the iBook VGA adapter, a VGA splitter, a VGA-RCA/S-Video adapter, an NTI USB-ADB adapter... well, you get the idea. </s>
<s> Oh, and an improvised iPod Dock (that space behind the handle's perfect). </s>
<s> Well, the LCD screen would fit after the opening for the display is puttied and flattened out to hold it seamlessly. </s>
<s> 1987 on the outside, 2005 on the inside. </s>
<s> Like I said - a cool mod idea. </s>
<s> So - any thoughts on a compatible 9&quot; LCD screen? </s>
<s> I have three of those SE/30's at the house, interesting thought. </s>
<s> About the only thing that uses a screen that small would be one of the Windows Netbook devices. </s>
<s> You may find a used one on eBay. </s>
