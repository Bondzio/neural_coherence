disk prices are dirt cheap compared to what we have invested in our systems in money, time and the emotional value of our data.
do not trust any one single drive to keep your precious data.
for example, a friend lost everything when her $1400 laptop crashed.
a new eide drive cost only $87.00 ($37.00 if it would've been the new sata technology).
what an unnecessary nightmare.
i have a clone hard drive for all three of the systems in our home.
i use multiple external drives for routine backup of my treasured data.
life expectancy is a crap shoot.
i have several old hard drives (one age 20) from old systems that i now use as extra external drives via a universal usb adapter ($12.00 on ebay for usb to sata, or 40 pin ide, and or 44 pin ide - power supply included).
then i had a laptop drive die after only 11 months.
a bit of advice for all of you that have the older ide drives (40 pin desktop - 44 pin laptop) that plan to stay with your system for a while.
buy a replacement disk now while they are still available because all the manufacturers are in high volume production of the newer sata drives.
it's more important for those of you with a laptop because you can not easily and neatly use an ide to sata converter like desktop owners can.
moral, if given the choice of losing your precious data or buying extra backup disk, a new disk looks cheap at five times the price!
