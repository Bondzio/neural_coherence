<s> Sir, I am a new member to your august forum. </s>
<s> Kindly help me out. </s>
<s> I want to know how to fix a new hard drive to my pentium celeron. </s>
<s> It has a mercury motherboard with 256 mb RAM. </s>
<s> Hi Karthik, How big of a hard drive are you hooking up to the old computer? </s>
<s> Some motherboards aren't capable of recognizing some of the larger sized hard drives. </s>
<s> You will have to read your motherboard manual and find this out. </s>
<s> In some cases, you will have to upgrade your bios in order for your motherboard to recognize the new drive. </s>
<s> You're other option is to purchase an external hard drive and use it that way. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, Howard </s>
<s> Hello Howard, Thanks a lot for the message. </s>
<s> Since i got the computer assembled i do not have the manual. </s>
<s> I am thinking of going in for 40 GB. </s>
<s> Regards Karthik. </s>
<s> I did find motherboards with the ''i810-W83627HF'' combination. </s>
<s> They were all from 1999, which means they used ultra ATA/33 hard drives, and maybe ultra ATA/66 at fastest. </s>
<s> Today's new ultra ATA drives are ATA/100 and ATA/133. </s>
<s> If you want to get a new HD, but your motherboard's HD controller chip doesn't support it, you still can add an ATA100/133 HD controller card ($10-15 USD, less on eBay) to an empty PCI slot and connect the HD there. </s>
<s> So, you do have options. </s>
<s> If you are running Windows XP and the HD is less than 127GB, you should be OK with new PCI hard disk controller card. </s>
<s> What operating system are you using? </s>
