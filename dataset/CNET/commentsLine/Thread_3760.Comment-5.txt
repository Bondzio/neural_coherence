used your suggested route, and it tells me that my system has, version 6.0.6001 service pack 1 build 6001 so, i guess we're ok there.
here's my network hookup info: desktop is cabled to lan port on router modem (fujitsu speedport dsl) is cabled to wan port on router printer is usb cabled to desktop laptop is using a dell wireless 1490 dual band wlan mini-card there are never any problems with internet connections.
in the interest of giving you what may/or may not be good info up front, i need to let you know that i have two printers installed on my laptop (same printer - canon ip4300, but installed on two different ports; both as local ports - one titled &quot;usb002&quot;, and the other titled with the address of the resident printer on the desktop).
both were installed per kaufmanmoore:  .
i did not intentionally install the two printers, but this was the result of many attempts to get printer sharing &quot;on&quot; in network and sharing center.
i worked on this for a long time and one day i looked and surprise, printer sharing was &quot;on&quot;!
i then noticed the two printers being installed, but i thought maybe that was the reason why printer sharing had gone on.
so i left them there.
sorry about the long story, but i thought it may be meaningful, and if so, you should know asap.
thanks for your assistance, ajtrek.
