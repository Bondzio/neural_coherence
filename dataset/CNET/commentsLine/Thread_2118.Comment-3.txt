ticking sound at boot, before snd drivers load.
low volume in one speaker, none in other.
devices appear-disappear.
using headphones instead of speakers may show same result.
sounds like blown audio to me.
too bad you can't add an audio card, and that the dell is out of warranty?
if the cdrom has headphone outlet, it is run by audio hardware anyway, so no workaround.
ask for verbal ballpark estimate from local dell shop or online fixers, so you don't have to pay $$ look fee.
