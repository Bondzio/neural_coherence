1.1.1	hello , okay , I have this old PII PC ( soyo 6ba mobo ) and I was using it to format/erase some old hard drives before discarding , when an old maxtor drive I had hooked up made this singing sound and when I restarted I got this message after a good POST : & quot ; your program caused a divide overflow error ( if problems persistst , conctact vendor etc ) & quot ; this message occurs whether I use a win 98 startup in the a drive or using the win 98 on the hard drive .

1.1.2	I am going to toss this machine and sell for parts anyhow but was curious as to what this is .	St

1.3.1	well since I ca n't get past a POST screen I 'll try swapping out the memory .	St
1.3.2	thanks for the tip - fj	Polite
1.4.1	well silly me , I lied , turns out the floppy drive was unplugged .	St
1.4.2	was able to boot with it .	St
1.4.3	so I think what happened was when i plugged in this old drive , it was jumpered as master and took over as C drive , probably wrote somehing into the OS on the main HD in the comp , corrupting it , giving the error .	St
1.4.4	thisd is all win98 -- -- fj	St
