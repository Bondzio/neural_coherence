<s> I am new to the Mac world. </s>
<s> I just bought a Dual G5 with all of the goodies however, am having trouble getting the Airport to work seamlessly with my LinkSys Wireless G router which runs two other systems in my home. </s>
<s> As soon as I log onto the internet, I find that accessing web pages and so forth takes a very long time, almost as if I were connected via a dial up modem. </s>
<s> I am able to see another wireless access point in my wireless icon at the top of the screen and when I click on it, IT SCREAMS!! </s>
<s> So, this is obviously my neighbors wireless system which I don't wish to use. </s>
<s> I am upset however, that mine is so darn slow. </s>
<s> It is slow whether or not my other computers are on using the wireless router. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any recommendations? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Seems to be in order here. </s>
<s> You must have some setting in the wrong place but without seeing it, everyone will be shooting blind. </s>
<s> You do not mention if the other two systems are having speed issues. </s>
<s> Try setting it up again, this time exactly as it say in the instructions. </s>
<s> Or, your could ask your neighbor to explain exactly how he has set his up. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> Now that you mention it, I'm having the same problem. </s>
<s> I'm a new pc to mac convert. </s>
<s> I have a PowerBookG4. </s>
<s> I'm also using a linksys wireless router. </s>
<s> It only runs my home network. </s>
<s> My download and general usage speeds are horrendously low on the mac. </s>
<s> The pc laptop is much better. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Do I need to get one of those airport express or airport extreme routers and scrap linksys? </s>
