1.1.1	It started mid November when my computer suddenly would n't boot up .	St
1.1.2	It would look like it was going to and then go to blue screen , then to another screen and then to the initial Microsoft Windows picture , over & over again .	St
1.1.3	All I can think that happened shortly before that that I had done was try to download a couple photo viewers that were suggested in a couple emails my father had sent me .	St
1.1.4	I ca n't seem to figure out if they actually installed onto my computer .	St
1.1.5	At the same time , I thought , as long as I 'm into this process , I should install the CD that came with a 5.0 Polaroid camera ( disk has : Photo Express 5.0 , Photo Explorer 8.0 and PC-CAM Driver .	St
1.1.6	Again , not sure if it installed or not .	St
1.1.7	I then thought I could plug the cord that came with the cameral into the front USB port on my computer ( HP Pavilion a600n .	St
1.1.8	That did nothing .	St
1.1.9	Then I remembered I could put a SD card into the battery compartment & download pictures that way and forgot about it .	St
1.1.10	The problem did not arise immediately after any of these things , but not too long after .	St
1.1.11	My computer is also set for automatic updates , so that is a remote possibility .	St
1.1.12	Now I ca n't recall when it first happened .	St
1.1.13	Whether i was using the computer or when I turned it on .	St
1.1.14	I tried over and over to turn my computer on and always the same thing .	St
1.1.15	I ended up with a DOS screen and none of the options there to start the screen worked except the option to take the computer back to out of the box condition , which I did n't want to do , as I 'd never get it back to where it was & had n't backed up my computer for a long time .	St
1.1.16	I simply did n't even try to use it for at least a week .	St
1.1.17	Then I tried once more and it booted up fine .	St
1.1.18	When I went to print something , I realized I had powered off my printer while I was n't using the computer , so I turned it on and immediately : Blue Screen .	St
1.1.19	Recently , I 've figured out that basically it 's anything that connects to my computer via a USB cable that also has its own power cord that causes the problem .	St
1.1.20	The few USB devices I have that use the computer 's power seem to work without causing the boot problem .	St
1.1.21	My big problem is I ca n't figure out how to back up the computer at this point since my external hard drive connects via USB & has a power cord , so causes thecomputer to not boot .	St
1.1.22	Any ideas would be appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	It is one long paragraph so while it would be nice to know the make and model I may have missed it because of that long paragraph .	St
1.2.2	Let me share a laptop I own had a similar issue .	St
1.2.3	I cured it by using a powered USB 2.0 HUB inbetween the PC and the drive .	St
1.2.4	Now it boots up fine .	St
1.2.5	If you get a random reboot , check your laptop 's maker for & quot ; motherboard & quot ; drivers .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	Hi there , I am being driven demented by what appears to be the same problem as you have had and I was wondering if you solved it yourself and if so , how exactly ... ? ! ?	Ques
1.3.2	here 's hoping and thanks a million ? ? ?	Ques
1.3.3	Graeme	St
1.4.1	& quot ; check your laptop 's maker for & quot ; motherboard & quot ; drivers. & quot ; I deal with a lot of machines .	St
1.4.2	The issue pops up a lot but sadly many owners ca n't deal with finding drivers so what are we to do ?	Ques
