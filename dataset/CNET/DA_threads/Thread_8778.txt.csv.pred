1.1.1	1gb SanDisk micro SD Yesterday I added some new songs to my card and noticed they would n't play on my phone .	St
1.1.2	Error message said files contained unrecognizable data ... Two hours after that , I found that nothing could be either added or deleted from the card ( tried to delete files using phone and computer ) .	St
1.1.3	Upon suggestion from my manager , I copied everything I had on the memory card to the hard drive on my computer and tried to reformat the card .	St
1.1.4	It would n't reformat in 2 phones ( Cingular Moto krzr and Samsung D807 ) or on my digital camera .	St
1.1.5	Both phones said the card was corrupted and the camera merely said card error .	St
1.1.6	I did find that after I tried to format the card in the camera , everything was in fact wiped clean .	St
1.1.7	Now , all that 's left is to format the darn thing .	St
1.1.8	Tried it in the krzr first ... appeared to format , but actually did n't .	St
1.1.9	Tried it in the D807 ... also appeared to format , but did n't .	St
1.1.10	Tried it in the camera ... card error .	St
1.1.11	I tried to format it on the computer ( card no longer auto-runs , but you must manually run it and it prompts you to format ) using FAT and FAT32 , but again it was unable to format .	St
1.1.12	Is there anything else I can try ?	Ques
1.1.13	Or should I just scrap this card and buy a new one ?	Ques
1.1.14	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	Read http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-7593_102-0.html ? forumID=58 & threadID=260721 & messageID=2564853 See if SANDISK has similar and definitely the 1GB should be in warranty so ask for a freebie .	St
