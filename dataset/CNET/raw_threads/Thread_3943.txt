Hey, I've been using a Nvidia GeForce 9600 GT for a while now, and for the games I play it just isn't cutting it. I'll give you the basic specs of my PC: Pentium dual core CPU E6300 @2.80GHz P5QL PRO motherboard 8GB Memory Nvidia GeForce 9600 GT My budget is about $300, but I'm willing to go over for a good card, I don't really know that much about PCs so any help is greatly appreciated.

Does it have enough? I don't know until I look but given how much most 9600 cards pulled in the past, most cards draw same or less unless you go with old cards like the 9800. Bob
