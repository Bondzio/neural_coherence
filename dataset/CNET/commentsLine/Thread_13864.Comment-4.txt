well make sure that there are nt drivers for the new mb and video card and any new hardware.
w2k server or w2003 server would be better.
but it's $$$$$.
if your makeing a new server pc this would be the time to do the change over.
bring the new one online with the nt server and do a change over then take the nt offline.
