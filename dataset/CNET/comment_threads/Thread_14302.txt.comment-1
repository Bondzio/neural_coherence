I bought an acer aspire Z3750 which is an all-in-one model.
Very happy with the performance, but struggling with the tilted screen, which has an uncomfortable angle.
When chatting or skyping, the webcam only picks up the upper part of the face, as the screen is facing up the ceiling.
and my six-year-old has to sit on his knees on the chair in order to see the screen properly.
has anyone a solution for this problem?
