i wonder if seagate or vantec has a &quot;known issue&quot; of incompatibility?
some hard drives makers have issued a firmware upgrade for certain hard drive models that are incompatible with popular chipsets.
maybe it's worth contacting seagate and/or vantec to see what they know.
maybe it's not worth it the time and trouble, and it's time to consider starting the return process to exchange it for an enclosure known to be compatible with your seagate model family.
i wish you all the best!
