thank you all for helping me out!
i have finally decided that i should go ahead and buy a computer soon, rather than wait for ever.
i have already waited too long.
i know that both intel and amd are coming out with new processors and chipsets but rather than wait, i have decided to buy a computer now.
so this is the config i selected based on my budget.
intel pentium 3.2:- 233.137 usd (price converted to dollars ) intel 945 g chipset board :-156 usd memmory:-transcend 2gb 533 mhz ddr-2 :- 226 usd hdd 160 gb seagate :- 95 usd monitor 17'inch flat crt samsung 793s:- 154 usd (lcd monitors are way too expensive in india.)
lite-on sohw-1673s dvd writer :- 69 usd kunhar atx cabinet with 400 watts smps:- 48 usd altec lansing atp3 speakers:- 75 usd geforce 6800 gs 256mb pci-e card : - 322 usd tv tuner card: - play tv @p7000 ( internal ) pixel view 110 usd total :- 1500 usd well i wanted to buy amd but they are rare and expensive here in india.
as far as the tuner card is concerned , i wanted to buy a much better one , but unfortunately this is the best one available here.
i want this computer for gaming (play all latest games at decent resolution) and also wanna use this as a media center pc.
i will be using windows xp with mce 2005 and then switching over to vista when it arrives.
ya i know ....if i were in us , i would get a much better computer for this budget.
but computer products are expensive here in india.
since i will be using my computer for watching/recording tv i want a system that doesn't make any noise.
can someone here tell me whether the p4 chip or the graphics card make a lot of noise and if so is there any way to reduce it????
noise during gameplay is okay though.only wanna keep noise down while watching/recording tv.
this is the first time i am building a new computer.please let me know of any combatibility issues or what should be changed .
also is it better to build or buy a media center system that can play games?
also please state whether this config would be enough for vista.
