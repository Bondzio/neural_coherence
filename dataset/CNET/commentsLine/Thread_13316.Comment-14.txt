you should allow the interior air of the case get over 100 f. what room temperature do you live in???
when you talk temperature let's be very specific whether we are talking cpu temp or internal ambient air.
if you have 122 f ambient internal something is drastically wrong.
you have virtually no airflow.
any chance that the fans are fighting each other rather than creating airflow??
?
