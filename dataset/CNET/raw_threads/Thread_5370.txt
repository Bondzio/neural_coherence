Sometimes the Ati is the default sound device and sometimes the Realtek HD is the default sound device. In fact I do not use Realtek HD, I use ATI with HDMI.When the Realtek HD was the default sound device I checked the sound devices and I found that the Ati Sound device is not connected but it is always connected. To solve the problem is to unplug the HDMI cable and plug it again or restart the computer. So how can I use only the Ati as the default sound device without uninstall or disable the Realtek HD built in on Asus Rampage III extreme.

So I am not able to select the listed playback devices to make it default. I also checked the BIOS and the setup is: Onboard Device-- Standard High Definition Audio -- Enabled Front Panel Type Audio -- HD Audio SPDIF out Mode Setting -- SPDIF (I changed to HDMI) What I did in the past was I changed the graphic card PCIE Port such as the first time I used was the MSI Graphic Card in the PCIEX16_1 port and XFX was in PCIEX16_2 port then I changed it MSI was in the PCIE16_2 and the XFX was in the PCIEX16_1. After I have problem of Playback sound device then I've changed like before. When I tried to open the playback devices is also always slow.
