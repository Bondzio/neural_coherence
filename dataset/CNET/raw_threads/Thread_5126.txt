Verify the required parameters, and reenter them.The synthax supplied for this command is not valid . Check help for the correct synthax. Usage: delete sslcert [ipport=]&lt;IP Address:port&gt; Parameters: Tag Value ipport - The IPv4 or IPv6 address and port for which the SSL certificate bindings will be deleted Remarks: deletes SSL server certificate bindings and corresponding client certificate policies for an IP address and port. Examples: delete sslcert ipport=1.1.1.1:443 delete sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:443 delete sslcert ipport=[ :: ]:443 I am not sure but it all started when OneCare was updated to v.2 (could it be involved?) I would greatly hope/appreciate if someone out there could help me further.
