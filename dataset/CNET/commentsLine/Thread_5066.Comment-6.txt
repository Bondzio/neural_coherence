the 2.8v module shouldn't blow up your machine, but it may cause bsod errors if you use it with a 2.5v or 2.6v module look at the timing or &quot;cas latenciy&quot; in the specifications for each module.
lower numbers are faster and cost more, but that still won't matter on your computer.
cas latencies of 3 or 2.5 are usually the less expensive value ram--perfect for your rapidly aging computer.
heat spreader?
not important unless overclocking.
(you don't need it.)
what is xms?

ram is sold in pairs because there is an advantage to some systems that are capable of using modules in &quot;dual channel mode.&quot; if the motherboard supports dual channel mode, then the two similar memory modules will operate in tandem to combine their bandwidths, which increases performance.
crucial.com indicates that your computer isn't capable of dual channel operation, so you don't have to worry about getting matched modules.
a dual channel kit often means that there are two modules that have been tested to operate properly in dual channel mode.
if you are planning on purchasing two 512mb modules, try to get two of the same exact model.
this is not required, but helps to avoid the potential of two vastly different modules that just won't play well together.
whether you purchase them in a two module kit or two separate modules shouldn't matter, especially since your computer isn't capable of dual channel mode.
also you could purchase one 512mb module and add it to your 256mb module.
768mb should be enough for xp if you are not a gamer.
save the rest of your money for a new computer.
