<s> I am in the middle of building a new HTPC. </s>
<s> I have a Thermaltake W0070RUC TR2 Series 430W Power Supply and an EVGA nforce 730a mobo. </s>
<s> I just realized that the power supply's CPU power connector is 4pin and the mobos is 8. </s>
<s> DO I have to get a new power supply? </s>
<s> or can i just plug the 4pin into the 8? </s>
<s> PLease help thanks, Mike </s>
<s> You can plug the 4 into the 8 but you will see that you do not achieve a fully functional motherboard in most cases. </s>
<s> The answer is to purchase an adapter. </s>
