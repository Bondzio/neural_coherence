<s> My dog chewed threw the cable to my wireless adapter for my keyboard and mouse. </s>
<s> Is there a way replace the adapter so that I can keep using the same keyboard and mouse? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Without make, model and such I can't guess this one. </s>
<s> Unlikely you will get the just the adapter but they may be sold. </s>
<s> If it is just the cable and not the unit on the end of the cable you should be able to buy any cheap USB cable and splice it. </s>
<s> The wire colors in these seem to be pretty standard so you should be able to match them up. </s>
<s> Soldered would be best but I am sure you can twist the wires together and tape them and they will work. </s>
<s> I tried that, do you have any idea how small the actual wires are inside a usb cable? </s>
<s> http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/hs_usb_pdg_r1_0.pdf on page 13 note a smallest size of 28 gauge. </s>
<s> Now that I know the exact size of the wire, a simple google search yielded many places to get one for wire that small. </s>
<s> Now for the real interesting part, splicing them together! </s>
<s> Wish me luck, I've never sliced wires this small. </s>

<s> I didn't do it, a guy at work did it, works just fine. </s>
<s> Thanks to all who posted - saved me some $ and a lot of aggravation! </s>
<s> Thanks for the report. </s>
