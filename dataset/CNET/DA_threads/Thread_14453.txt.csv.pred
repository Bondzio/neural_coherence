1.1.1	Hello, I have a computer that has access to multiple printers.	St
1.1.2	It mainly prints using a Minotla printer and sometimes prints using a HP printer.	St
1.1.3	A week ago, the default printer was set to the Minolta printer.	St
1.1.4	The only exception was that when a document was printed from the application Simply Accounting, it would use the HP printer (which is how it should be setup).	St
1.1.5	I removed a few printers that were no longer in use from the Win XP Printers and Faxes screen.	St
1.1.6	Since then, Simply Accounting prints off the printer that is setup as the default printer.	St
1.1.7	I have tried to setup the HP printer as the default for Simply Accounting, but by doing so, it changes it to the default printer for all applications, which should be the Minolta and not the HP.	St
1.1.8	Is there a way that I can setup the Minolta as the default printer for all applications, except Simply Accounting, where the HP should be the default printer for that application?	St
1.1.9	I'd like to have the printers setup the way they were before, but I just can't seem to make it happen.	St
1.2.1	Try.. http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=change+default+printer+script Tailor to fit your need.	St
1.2.2	And ... Windows doesn't do this for you.	Ques
1.2.3	You have to help it.	St
