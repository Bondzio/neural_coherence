I have this motherboard ( http://www.ecs.com.tw/ECSWebSite/Product/Product_Detail.aspx?DetailID=1139&amp;CategoryID=1&amp;MenuID=19&amp;LanID=0 ). When I install Windows 7/Vista I have an issue with the sound card driver. When I open an audio file, the CPU usage (Amd Athlon x2 250) goes up to 70%. What can I do?
