I will soon be purchasing a new desktop pc and a new 50'-60' HDTV (I do not know what of the above I am purchasing yet...). I would like to be able to sit-down and watch cable tv in full 50'+ HDTV. I also want to be able to play games/work on the full tv. Finally, I would like to be able to watch TV on half of my TV while playing games/working on the other half of my TV. I also also like to take advantage of some video cards' abilities to act like Tivo (record/pause live TV). I do not intend to purchase a DVD player and plan to use the PC's DVD reader to play any movies I wish to watch in HD format, therefore I probably need a kick-ass sound system coming from my pc...... IS THIS REALISTIC????? If so, can someone point me in the right direction as to what to buy or hardware requirements? I'm hoping to be at or below $5,000 (I assume approx. $1500 for a good desktop PC (im thinking a 64-bit Athlon with Windows Media Center), approx. $2000 for an HDTV, and approx. $500-1000 for sound system/installation/incidentals. THANK YOU for any advice or direction you can provide!!!!

Now your MCE PC can have a HDTV tuner in it, using the TV tune and playing games at the same time??? Also keep in mind that most HDTVs are just a monitor and do not have a HDTV truner in them, this is changing and soon they all will have the HDTV turner in them. The best ones I have seen are the Apple cinamavison LCDs. John http://reviews.cnet.com/Televisions/2001-6475_7-0.html?tag=dir.cat
