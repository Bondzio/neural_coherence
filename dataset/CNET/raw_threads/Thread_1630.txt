She was getting memory error messages, so we increased the memory to 768. She is still getting the messages and must shut down her system, as it keeps locking up. Any suggestions?

But there is no detail in your post for me to suspect hardware issues yet. If you feel it's a software error (more likely), try a post with more details in one of the OS forums. We have XP, Windows 98, ME, Linux and Mac. Bob
