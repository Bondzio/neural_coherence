<s> Perhaps you recall the Startrek show that featured aliens called 'The Borg'. </s>
<s> Each alien member on the spaceship was connected to a network in a way that their brains combined to make something superpowered. </s>
<s> Let's say you have a small LAN of 50-100 PC workstations and each of these PC's has a 1TB SATA hard disk. </s>
<s> Let's also assume that users only use about 25% of that 1TB disk for applications and data on the local PC. </s>
<s> So a 100 PC LAN has 75TB of unused disk space. </s>
<s> Is there any software that would allow one to take unused disk space from each PC and add that capacity to a pool of storage space? </s>
<s> It would seem you could even use striping and mirroring of data over multiple PC's for performance and reliability. </s>
<s> In other words, could each PC contribute unused storage space to a big pool that a designated server could treat as one big storage space, as in a storage area network? </s>
<s> Is this that old idea that is new again? </s>
<s> Google Microsoft DFS and see. </s>
<s> The problems are such that anyone that wanted to do this would just do it. </s>
<s> Those that can't deal with it, won't. </s>

<s> From what I understand of DFS it cannot utilize all the unused storage space that lives on Windows 7 or Windows XP workstations. </s>
<s> It can only distrubute/replicate data between Windows Server 2003, 2008, 2012. </s>
<s> I would like to utilize all that unused storage space on all those workstations. </s>
<s> It appears DFS can't do that. </s>
<s> Your post sounded as if you were going to write code, drivers to make this all happen. </s>
<s> At no point was Windows listed in your top post so I thought, hey, that old idea. </s>
<s> These ideas were kicked around for years but as disk space costs dropped, the idea went with it. </s>
<s> You seem to want to try it again so why not? </s>
<s> In other words, you'll have to create it. </s>
