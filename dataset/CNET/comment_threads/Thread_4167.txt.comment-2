All your equipment must support 5g and this is uncommon.
In addition all your equipment must support N since you can't run B or G over 5G only A.
Your nic's will clearly say they are DUAL MODE when they support 5g.
They should have options in the drivers to select only the 5G band.
I suspect the equipment that does not work does not support the band.
This is the problem with replacing routers with newer ones expecting better performance.
You in general must replace everything, If you attempt to run a mix of B,G and N devices they will get in each others way and you will get poor performance.
