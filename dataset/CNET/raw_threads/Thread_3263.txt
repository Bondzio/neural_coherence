I am wondering, what would be a &quot;safe&quot; frequency to overclock it to. I was hoping I could get something around 3.0Ghz without it blowing up on me. My Specs if needed: OS: WinXP Home CPU: Intel Pentium 4 2.66Ghz GPU: Radeon X1600 Pro RAM: 1.5Gb

This depends on several things which will vary according to the hardware. Most important is the processor and the motherboard. Manufacturing variances will determine the possibilities. First look up the motherboard to see if you can even start. The motherboard that will allow overclocking will have the access in the BIOS. So let's start there. What motherboard do you have?
