I have already had it replaced once (the company I bought it from said it sounds faulty) but I was disappointed to find the problem was still there.
2 months of waiting for Netgear support to reply (lol) I get a personal phone call from one support tech who's currently trying his best to solve the problem.
We were hoping the version 3 (I had version 2) would be the fix, but we were wrong.
Still, I got a nicer (more expensive too!)
looking router as a replacement.
It's still frustrating though... =o(
