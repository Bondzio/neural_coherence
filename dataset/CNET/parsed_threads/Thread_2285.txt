<s> I just switched from 98SE to XP-PRO and I'm having trouble setting up my Visioneer 7600 Parallel Port Scanner. </s>
<s> I'm using Paperport 8 and the software seems to work but the driver doesn't seem to work correctly. </s>
<s> First: I have a P4, XP-PRO, 256MB Ram and two hard drives. </s>
<s> I tried the compatibility wizard and the program just crashed. </s>
<s> Without the compatibility mode the program works with older scans completely but when I try to scan or preview an image the program does some funny things. </s>
<s> It will start the scan and never quit making multiple copies of the image and I can't close the scan window. </s>
<s> Is anyone running this setup? </s>
<s> Do I have to upgrade (buy new) my scanner? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, Denny </s>
<s> Visioneer does not support any of their parallel port scanners with XP, PERIOD. </s>
<s> I have had a few clients that were burned by this, Visioneer just decided it wasn't worth it. </s>
<s> You need to buy a new scanner if you want to run XP. </s>
<s> Fortunately USB scanners are under $100. </s>
<s> Parallel port devices are losing support all over. </s>
<s> For much less that 100USB you find complete units like (excuse the vendor link) http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=HPSJ4400C-N which includes updated software to use with your updated OS. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> I have a few HP scanners and they seem OK. </s>
<s> Thanks for your advice. </s>
<s> I went to Sam's Club and bought a OneTouch 9220 Visioneer and it is working wonderfully. </s>
<s> I stuck with Visioneer because I like the Paperport 8 software. </s>
<s> The scanner is 4800 x 2400 and it only cost $80. </s>
<s> It was worth the cost to get rid of the headache with the compatibility problems. </s>
<s> I'm almost up to par with the XP configuration and so far(although a lot of work) I like it better. </s>
<s> Thanks again, Denny </s>
