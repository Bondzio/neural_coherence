I am not concerned about 60fps, although a steady 30fps would be nice. Just wondered if I need to go for a top-end core i7, or would an i7 920 be sufficient? Thx xdantespardax

You then up the ante and buy the best you can afford to maintain a higher level or prolonged std. that produces enjoyable results. Basically, spend the $ now will provide a longer period before yet another upgrade. ALso, keep the PC as cool as possible. tada -----Willy
