<s> I have just bought an Inspiron E1505 with Intel PRO 3945 and Dell 350 Bluetooth Internal Wireless Cards. </s>
<s> I'm thinking about setting up network in my house. </s>
<s> So I 'm consider between a WGU624 with a WGT624. </s>
<s> I'm a newbie at this, so I need advice about seeting these things up. </s>
<s> Which device do you think have simplier setup. </s>
<s> If you have another recommendation, please go ahead. </s>
<s> I am seeking for help and advice. </s>
<s> Thanks!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> If don't want to spend too much money, the Intel PRO 3945 is a wireless-a/b/g adapter, so you don't need to purchase a wireless network adapter. </s>
<s> Any plain wireless-g (or a/g) router will work with that network adapter. </s>
<s> You can get one for as little as USD$30. </s>
<s> Stick with major brands like Netgear, D-Link, and Linksys. </s>
<s> Also not an expert, I too have a new Inspiron E1505 with the same Intel Pro Wireless 3945 and I just connected to this router: Linksys SRX200 Wireless-G Broadband Routers with SRX (WRT54GX2) and then networked with an older laptop Dell Latitude C600 (wired). </s>
<s> I currently have PowerLink highspeed internet that is 100 Mbps via WIRED connection. </s>
<s> Is there anyway to get higher speed than 54 Mbps WIRELESS???? </s>
<s> Also I find when running on battery power my Inspiron has a very hard time maintaining the wireless connection. </s>
<s> Is there a configuration I need to change? </s>
<s> Could my cordless phone be effecting connectivity??? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> The the theoretical maximum connection speed from your computer to your router is 100Mbps with a network cable. </s>
<s> The the theoretical maximum connection speed from your computer to your router is 54Mbps with a regular wireless-g adapter. </s>
<s> Typical Intrenet download speeds for Cable/DSL are less than 10Mbps (say 1.5Mbps). </s>
<s> If you want faster internet speeds, you need to subscribe to a faster service from your ISP. </s>
<s> Therefore, the speed limiting factor in your Internet downloads and uploads is the level of your PowerLink service and not the speed of connection between the router and your computers. </s>
<s> Where you will see the faster 100Mbps or 54Mbps speeds is on transfers in your local area network (LAN), say when you transfer files from one local computer to another local computer (not to/from the Internet). </s>
<s> Wireless speeds faster than 54Mbps? </s>
<s> Yep. </s>
<s> Look into MIMO or Pre-N routers when using the compatible MIMO/Pre-N wireless adapter. </s>
