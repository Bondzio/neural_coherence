you can install another wireless router in your home office.
this router can be configured to forward dhcp requests to your main router.
most routers come with a built-in switch with 4 to 8 ports.
you can run patch cables to the switch from the devices.
the cable drop from the other route can still be a back-up method.
but you would still need a switch to split the connection with either method.
