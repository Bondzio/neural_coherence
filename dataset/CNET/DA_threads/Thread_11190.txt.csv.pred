1.1.2	Could they be a new setting under bios which maybe doing it i dont think its overheating.	St
1.1.3	When i play a game afte about 10 mins my screen goes white and the card reboots and windows says the graphics card stops responing.	St
1.1.4	Im running vista and my mobo is an ecs p965t-a Cheers chris	St
1.2.1	The software that came with it has some overclocking features.	St
1.2.2	Set it to default.	St
1.2.3	Also, when you update bios you change all the settings.	St
1.2.4	So go into the bios and make sure all the settings are right.	St
1.2.5	I think with that card you disable shadowing.	St
1.3.1	i did have it overclocked but then i set it to defalt and still no luck.	St
1.3.2	ill look in bios and let you know the results.	St
1.3.3	BTW im running vista home premium if that helps Chris	St
1.4.1	seems to be overheating but i have never had ant problems its not overclocked.	St
1.4.2	is they an after market cooling way to solve this Chris	St
1.5.1	If you can't run your video card with the new bios update.	St
1.5.2	Have you tried restoring the old bios and seeing if that resolves the issue?	St
1.5.3	I had a question a while ago about my ati card and I went to their ati.com website support forum.	St
1.5.4	They were pretty fast in replying.	St
1.5.5	But anyway, usaully when they update the bios for those boards they back up the old one.	St
1.5.6	I'd try that first, and if it persists I'd open up the computer and make sure everything was seated properly and working.	St
1.5.7	Uninstall the drivers and update them with the latest (especially if i'm running vista).	St
1.5.8	And if that didn't work I'd have a very serious problem with my video card.	St
1.5.9	An expensive problem.	St
1.6.1	need if you burned up the card.	St
1.6.2	Newegg.com has a number of GPU cooler ... some by Arctic Cooling, ThermalTake, Vantec, Zalman, etc., VAPCMD	St
