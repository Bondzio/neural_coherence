Would a ''DVD Burner'' such as the http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16827152052 be able to read any type of media and data?
I want to be able to use the drive as a regular, CD-ROM game-playing and software-installing drive, a drive which would play music CDs and be able to burn them as well.
And can you use DVD-R discs such as http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16827152052 to burn music files and play them in stereos and your computer?
