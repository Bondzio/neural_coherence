1.1.1	My Dell notebook is set up as follows : Dell E1505 Intel Next-Gen-Wireless Card Vista Netgear WNR 834B Originally the only connection I could get was to the router with limited connectivity ( no internet ) .	St
1.1.2	After hours with a friend in IT I have an internet connection .	St
1.1.3	Strangley we could n't get a connection when we secured the network so we just allowed my notebook mac address access .	St
1.1.4	Now everything seems to be working fine except my download speed sometimes drops to almost nothing occasionally .	St
1.1.5	I always have an excellent connection .	St
1.1.6	It seems to be random .	St
1.1.7	I have read some other forums where there are suggestions that the drivers for the Netgear WNR 834B are not yet toatlly ready for Vista although it is advertised that way .	St
1.1.8	Any thoughts out there ?	Ques
1.1.9	Mike	St
1.2.1	This is well worn areas .	St
1.2.2	I could n't tell if your router has current firmware , if a driver for your Vista was current and which encryptions you tried .	Sug
1.2.3	WPA2 is indeed busted until you get a patch from Microsoft so you need to know that some have to call it in .	St
1.2.4	Microsoft may kick you back to the machine 's maker so be sure to call whichever is free first .	Sug
1.2.5	Hope this helps , Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the reply .	St
1.3.2	I am not too concerned about the security as i am the only one wireless in my house .	St
1.3.3	The mac address approach seems to work .	St
1.3.4	I am more concerned about the unreliable internet connection .	St
1.3.5	I ahve the latest firmware from Netgear .	St
1.3.6	I have n't checked the drivers for the wireless card but its only 2 weeks old so I have to assume it is the newest .	St
1.3.7	Just seems crazy that Dell put the whole package together including recommending that Netgear router to go with their card .	St
1.4.1	I set up my dad 's netgear and while testing it dropped .	St
1.4.2	It took awhile to hunt it down to some old phone .	St
1.4.3	But it still dropped when the phone was in the next house .	St
1.4.4	Why would Dell be on the hook for that issue ?	Ques
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	Well Bob I do n't know about that situation but if I 'm losing my connection because the Netgear router does n't have the kinks worked out with Vista I think Dell does have some responsibility .	St
1.5.2	In fact since they recommend it I 'd say they are totally responsible .	St
1.5.3	Mike	St
1.6.1	With wireless it 's open to interference and degradation as you put walls inbetween .	St
1.6.2	Get wired if you want it to not drop .	St
1.6.3	How long have you used wireless and how many systems have you installed ?	Ques
1.6.4	Bob .	St
1.6.5	PS .	St
1.6.6	I 've lost count here .	St
1.7.1	I do n't disagree with that .	St
1.7.2	What I am saying is that & quot ; if I 'm losing my connection because the Netgear router does n't have the kinks worked out with Vista & quot ; I think that it is irresponsible of Dell to market this router as working & quot ; slicker than s # # t & quot ; with their pc .	St
1.8.1	I 'll agree that WIFI is not ready for people who want things as reliable as a light bulb and also there is poor tech support out there .	St
1.8.2	But from my experiences I 've done too many site surveys and found people with their router on the same channel as their neighbors , interfering components in their homes and the list just keeps going .	St
1.8.3	Is this Dell 's fault or Netgears ?	Ques
1.8.4	Sorry I do n't think so .	Res
1.8.5	There 's other things they do n't tell you such as getting your system up first with SSID enabled and no security then trying locking it down .	St
1.8.6	Go back to what works rather than complain when you find a combo that does n't work .	St
1.8.7	There 's a limit to some drivers today , especially in WPA and WPA2 .	St
1.8.8	- & gt ; Point blank .	St
1.8.9	Your post has too few details for me to point to some setting you chose so I 'll have to just write ideas until you tell me that 's it or not it .	St
1.8.10	Bob	St
1.9.1	What kind of details do you need ?	Ques
1.9.2	I am not particularly computer savvy and I do n't pretend to be .	St
1.9.3	Mike	St
1.10.1	1 .	St
1.10.2	Did you do a site survey to pick a RF channel that the neighbors are not on ?	Ques
1.10.3	2 .	St
1.10.4	Did you change the SSID ?	Ques
1.10.5	3 .	St
1.10.6	Did you leave SSID broadcast enabled ?	Ques
1.10.7	4 .	St
1.10.8	What distance and walls are from the router to the laptop ?	Ques
1.10.9	And look at all these replies and it 's taken this long to get to work .	St
1.10.10	Not that I do n't mind but you can see it 's not ready for people to take home and install .	St
1.10.11	Bob	St
1.11.1	1. no 2. yes 3.yes 4. no walls 12 feet	Res
1.12.1	Use what works best .	St
1.12.2	Autochannel will cause drops in my experience and is proper to do so .	St
1.12.3	Think about why .	St
1.12.4	Think about how to do a site survey .	St
1.12.5	I have a laptop and my Palm TX which I can view networks and what channel they are on .	St
1.12.6	You 'll have to dream up something or just try 1 then 5 then 11 and see what works best .	St
1.12.7	As to WZC , that 's another one to try enabled and disabled .	St
1.12.8	Bob	St
