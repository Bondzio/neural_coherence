1.1.1	I am using Windows XP and I am the administrator and have my son set up as one of the users.	St
1.1.2	I'd like to know if it's possible to set up or require a password if someone wanted to send something to the printer.	St
1.1.3	My printer software does not allow this option, so I wondered if there was something that could be done on the XP side of things or on user settings.	St
1.1.4	The only thing I found and changed was the times the printer could be accessed so I just set it for 1 min from midnight to 1 min after that since my son would not be up to use the printer at that time so I'm safe The only thing is, I am then limited to only those times if I want to print......so requiring a password would be easier.	St
1.1.5	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	1.	St
1.2.2	Uncheck Simple File Sharing.	St
1.2.3	http://windows.about.com/library/tips/bltip542.htm 2.	St
1.2.4	Find the Security Tab on your printer.	St
1.2.5	http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=282902 &quot;To Delegate Security For a Printer 1.	St
1.3.1	I dont have an NTFS volume so I dont have a security tab.	St
1.3.2	Do I have any other options that your aware of?	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	Do you have XP Home or Pro?	St
1.5.2	If Pro, it should partition as NTFS by default.	St
1.5.3	Right click on the HD and check Properties.	St
1.5.4	Under the &quot;General&quot; tab, it should show your file system and it will be FAT32 or NTFS.	St
1.5.5	If FAT32, it can be converted to NTFS.	St
1.5.6	If NTFS, Bob is correct about unchecking simple file sharing.	St
1.5.7	Now, if you have XP Home, it basically uses simple file sharing and you cannot change that anywhere.	St
1.5.8	However, you can set permissions for users by starting in &quot;Safe Mode&quot;.	St
1.5.9	I have not tried this with printers, however, so you would need to check this yourself.	St
1.5.10	You would want permission granted to yourself and administrators only.	St
1.5.11	You would make sure no one not authorized such permissions was given them by user name or group.	St
1.5.12	You may post back your finding if more specific instruction is needed.	St
