i have a 30gb maxtor bought at least 6 years ago that's still going strong.
it's been in 2 different pc's and has been continuously running my os flawlessly.
it's been a great drive.
i also trust the western digital drives, having owned 2 of them with no problems.
i can't say that i don't trust seagate drives, but i have had a problem with one and would think twice before buying another.
