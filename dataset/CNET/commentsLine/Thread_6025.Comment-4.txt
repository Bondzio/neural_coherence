cpus, can be swapped amongest other mtrbds.
provided they're supported.
the cpu type, model and/or class is best described by the mtrbd.
specs and what it entails.
you should have available new heatsink compound to use as the old may not work well once the seal is broken from removing the hsf and then cpu.
i've done this mucho times and rarely have a problem.
beware, though proper handling procedures from esd(static) should be followed plus proper ordination into cpu socket.
good luck -----willy
