1.1.1	Hello cNET , My name 's Robert , and I recently got a upgraded video card which has been causing some issues once I installed it .	St
1.1.2	I was using a Radeon HD 4600 series then upgraded to an ASUS Radeon HD 7770 .	St
1.1.3	Before installing the new card I uninstalled the old driver through Control Panel , then shutdown , installed new card , rebooted and installed the new driver .	St
1.1.4	During my gaming sessions I would notice random screen tears happening , it would only be for less than a second but it would happen every few hours sometimes back to back when it did occur .	St
1.1.5	After the tears started to become more frequent then I would be getting blue screens , I was always checking my temps they were fine , my 6pin is connected .	St
1.1.6	I then read online to install & quot ; Driversweeper & quot ; to remove all existing drivers that may be causing interference which I did , then after I uninstalled those drivers it had me reboot , now during startup and I ca n't get to my desktop without getting a bluescreen .	St
1.1.7	I was just going to whipe my computer with my Vista disk but that is not working .	St
1.1.8	Any way to resolve this without whiping my computer ?	Ques
1.2.1	But not one code from a blue screen so I 'm going to write it 's some overtaxed power supply .	St
1.2.2	I see various sites write about 100 Watts just for this card and http : //www.amd.com/us/products/desktop/graphics/7000/7770/Pages/radeon-7770.aspx # 3 asks for a 500 Watt or better PSU .	St
1.2.3	While I 'm inside I 'd replace the CPU heatsink compound and ask the machine 's maker about BIOS updates and compatibility .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Sorry I was at work when I made this post so I was n't able to provide better information .	St
1.3.2	I found out that my power supply is in total 700 watts .	St
1.3.3	I 'm not sure of a program I could use to show all my information , for example the dxdiag does n't display my information for some reason .	St
1.3.4	I know this much about my computer ... Intel Quad Core Q6600 2.40GHZ Heatsink is a Hyper Master 212 Plus Asus Radeon HD 7770 8 Gigs of Ram OCZ 700 watt PSU ( 12v ) Windows Vista 64bit Below I was able to provide a screenshot of the bluescreen I am getting .	St
1.3.5	I tried swapping out the Radeon 7770 with the 4600 series I was using before I was getting the Bluescreen and I still get it right before it shows the Windows logo then goes to desktop .	St
1.3.6	I ended up taking out everything , cleaning out the computer which built up some dust , and replaced everything and still ended up with the bluescreen .	St
1.3.7	Screenshot of Bluescreen provided below .	St

1.4.1	https : //www.google.com/search ? hl=en & as_q=stop+0x50 & as_epq=atikmpag+sys I see a few marked & quot ; Solved & quot ; so see what they did .	St
1.4.2	At least it 's not my first guess .	St
1.4.3	I hope you see why I could only guess without the details .	St
1.4.4	There is some thought that since it works for a time it could be heat related .	St
1.4.5	Did you try it with the cover off and pointing a fan at the open box ?	Ques
