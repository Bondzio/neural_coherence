greetings from scandinavia.
i just bought an i7 950 with the extreme6 mb, i choose to pick my tri-channel ram-blocks among the few ddr3 on the market operating at 1.5volts.
read that the memory-controller in the i7 chip can get damaged by higher voltages!
ram-specs: kingston valueram 3 x 2 gb - product code: kvr1066d3n7k3/6g 1066 mhz, pc3-8500 - 7-7-7-20 on-die termination (odt) / intel extreme memory profiles (xmp) as-rock's mb-support page does not have these modules on the compatibility list!!
now im afraid these kingston ram will cause a problem, this is my first rig-build!
help me figure out whether i should send the ram back
