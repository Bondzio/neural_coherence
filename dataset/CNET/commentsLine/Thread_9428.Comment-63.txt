will get you a lot for your money.
like dells 400xps for $999.
19&quot; flat panel and a gb of memory included.
(not that i'm pushing one brand over another) a little time visiting manufactures websites is time well spent.
now &quot;if&quot; you're wanting a high end expensive machine, all of the breaking edge tech is going to change soon.
unless you just gotta have it, waiting at least 6mo after their release can save you big bucks.
this coming christmas season should have some hot deals.
but, if you're just wanting a fast machine now, and have the grand to spend now, those deals will keep you up to par with what most gaming software manufactures will offer for at least a year.
