But when I double click it to open it shows an error message box &quot; Location is not available f:/ is not accessible Access denied&quot;. And when I see properties by right clicking it is shows Used Space 0 bytes Free Space 0 bytes Capacity 0 Bytes Also tried to check it for errors from tools It shows error message &quot;The disk check could not be performed because windows can not access the disk&quot; And also i have to tried to access it from command prompt (Run as administrator) using command f: It shows &quot;Access denied&quot; When I try to change access permission from properties/security by providing full control or changing the owner it shows &quot;unable to save the changes in permission information&quot;. And finally when I try to format the disk It shows &quot;You do not have sufficient rights to perform this operation&quot;. &lt;div&gt;And I have also tested two other external drives(WD &amp; seagate)but faced the same issue.&lt;/div&gt;How could this is possible that one day disk is working fine and next day it has this issue. Please provide some solution to fix this.

There is malware that can cause such but as presented I would be guessing if some malware was recently cleaned off. How did the new administrator account test work out? Bob

So i am not able to figure out what is wrong with the access for hard disks and pen drives.

Actually as i have mentioned in my first post itself that I am also not able to change any permission setting for the drive. it shows &quot;unable to save the changes in permission information&quot;. and same error windows have no access to this object. I think this is not a permission issue because in this case it is not even showing the disk capacity when I check properties.

This is a hardware forum so we won't dive into repairing the OS and since I can't tell how the OS was damaged I'll have to write that a reload is next. Bob

I have tried the NEW admin thing that you have noted but the behavior is same in every particular access method that i have stated in my first post and even changing the permission showing same error message.

Proffitt	7/23/13 8:46 AM	1.37456916E12	Then research that error message and hope	I don't know how the OS got into this state so I can't write any other fix other than to reload the OS. If you need a little help in the research, see this link -&gt; http://xkcd.com/627/ I know a fix, even if it's unpopular. Bob
