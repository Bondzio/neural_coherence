<s> I have an Wacom Intuos Graphics Tablet with a serial port connecting cable, but I have not serial port on my computer. </s>
<s> What kind of Serial port to USB adapter can I use to connect the tablet to my computer? </s>
<s> The operation system is Word 7. </s>
<s> But let me share I've used hundreds of this model -&gt; http://serialio.com/products/adaptors/usb_serial.php (the standard unit.) </s>
<s> It's quite odd to find Wacom selling serial port devices, in fact I didn't see that on their site. </s>
<s> Too bad the story and model number is missing but I can write the standard model I noted is great for serial port work. </s>
<s> You can find that adapter at Newegg and Amazon as well. </s>

<s> I am sorry, my mistake. </s>
<s> It is not Word 7 but Windows 7. </s>
<s> The Tablet is Intuos Serial Graphics Tablet, Wacom, GD-1212-R. Alexandra </s>
<s> http://forum.wacom.eu/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=195 Around here all Windows 7 I encounter is 64 bit. </s>
<s> The news is not good. </s>
<s> That model looks to be many many years old. </s>
