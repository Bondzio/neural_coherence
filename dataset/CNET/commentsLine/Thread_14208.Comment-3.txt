thanks, i wasn't to sure if my power supply could handle it, but i remembered that 18+18=36, and a graphics card usually takes 2 6 pin power connectors, but i still needed a professional opinion on it just to be on the safe side, since this will be the first time ill be going with a top level graphics card from evga, as i have a budget card from them right now.
