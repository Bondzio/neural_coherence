hello, i am doing my very first computer build as i am into 3d design and video editing and all of the ready made ones are far too expensive!
as this is my first time i am having trouble working out which parts are compatible with eachother and i decided to come here for help!
here is my list of parts mobo gigabyte ga-970a-ds3 socket am3+ 7.1 channel audio atx motherboard cpu amd bulldozer fx-8 8120 3.1ghz socket am3+ 8mb l3 cache retail boxed processo case nzxt phantom black full tower case cd drive samsung sh-222bb sata dvd optical drive | oem hard drive seagate 500gb barracuda hard drive wifi tp-link tl-wn727n wireless-n150 usb adapter gpu &lt;div&gt; sapphire hd 5450 1gb ddr3 hdmi dvi vga out pci-e low profile graphics card psu cit 700w black edition psu 12cm fan dual 12v rail 20+4pin 2x sata ram &lt;/div&gt; corsair 8gb ddr3 1600mhz vengeance memory could someone please tell me if these parts are compatible and if they would be good enough for 3d design.
also, i was wondering what i would have to do if this computer broke, only the individual parts would have a warranty and i may not know what is broken and what needs to be sent back to ebuyer.
thanks a lot in advance, alistair
