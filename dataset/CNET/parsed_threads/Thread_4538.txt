<s> i recently purchased a tv that didnt specify that only pc input was 1024X768 resolution. </s>
<s> the component cable connecters on back are 1080p and i want to connect to that port so my pc can display 1080p. </s>
<s> so i was wondering what do i have to get to make that possible? </s>

<s> You need a PC video card with that resolution and connector output. </s>
<s> I didn't research your video card. </s>
<s> If it doesn't have the proper output you'll need to get one that does. </s>
<s> There's no way to change the TVs PC input. </s>
<s> I am guessing you don't have 1080p on that TV. </s>
<s> If it has 1080p, I am pretty sure there would also be hdmi connection. </s>
<s> What kind of contents are you trying to view at 1080p? </s>
<s> You have a PS3 or blu-ray player on that PC? </s>
<s> I will also venture to say if you don't have a HD video card you might not have much fun trying to output 1080p contents. </s>
<s> Just my thoughts. </s>
