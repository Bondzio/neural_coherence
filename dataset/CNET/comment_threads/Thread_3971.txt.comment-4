Yeah right now I'm running it with the cover off.
If I put the cover back on the case will vibrate and the fan will make a loud buzzing noise.
My computer basically crashes out of nowhere unpredictably, even while idle.
I've checked the system health in bios and the cpu temp is only around 47-49C.
I'm still trying to figure out why my computer crashes and which piece of hardare is causing this.
Also, its been crashing on my old system too which is why I replaced the CPU, motheboard and memory, and it still does it.
The only thing I havent replaced for a long time is my hard drive, but I ran the manufacturers utility did burn in tests and such and it says the hard drive is error free.
Also, crashing either gives a blue screen just saying &quot;the system has halted, contact your hardware vendor&quot; or it just plain freezes while im doing something and I try to click on a window and it gets stuck and I have to reset, other times it beeps a constant beep when it freezes, so I'm thinking that might mean something...
