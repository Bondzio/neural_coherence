<s> Hi, my girlfriend and I are both experiencing the same problem. </s>
<s> We will be in the middle of doing something and the computer will just turn off. </s>
<s> Not even like it's going to reboot....turns off completely. </s>
<s> Both on laptops....her's is a compaq and mine is an IBM thinkpad both running XP Pro. </s>
<s> What could be causing this....very annoyed </s>
<s> Similar problem with my IBM T60 Laptop running Windows XP. </s>
<s> (sp3) I can use the m/c for a long time if I am just accessing the Internet and doing email. </s>
<s> Problem usually occurs pretty quickly when I use an application like Access or Powerpoint. </s>
<s> I have removed the battery and left just the plug in. </s>
<s> Same issue with Battery removed. </s>
<s> I have re-installed the Operating System, Same issue after new O/S installed. </s>
<s> I have replaced the Hard disk. </s>
<s> I would like some opinion as to what would be the next (easiest, cheapest) step. </s>
<s> Replace ?? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Memory; 2 Power supply; 3 Mother board; 4.Display; 5 laptop;...(yeah I know..the last one...) Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Generally speaking...laptops don't 'breathe' or expel heat as well a desktops so making sure vents are NOT blocked during use is critical. </s>
<s> Using a laptop on your lap, on a pillow or sitting on a bed often blocks the vents that help laptops breathe. </s>
<s> Laptop coolers ....flat surfaces with fan can also help. </s>
<s> Another thing....dust often builds up inside laptops and dramatically reduces their ability to stay cool....a little compressed air can help eliminate some of that. </s>
<s> Having enough system RAM and free hard disk space also helps. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> That is, clean it out and replace the CPU heat sink compound? </s>
<s> It's an older machine so why not do the usual maintenance? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> How do I get info on changing the heat sink compound...ie: opening up the laptop...looks like a lot of tiny screws on the bottom....do they all just come out and the bottom pops off? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> so Disk should be fine..I use the laptop on a flat desk in a generally cooler room.... </s>
<s> I'lll check the venting...thanks </s>
<s> compartment for dust bunnies. </s>
<s> Might also try installing PCWizard ....download it, run it and minimize it....it will show a series of system temps in the upper right hand corner of the screen. </s>
<s> It could help tell you whether it's a computer component temp problem or not. </s>
<s> Keep us posted how it works out. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> While it may not be this exact laptop, after you have worked on a few they begin to look the same. </s>
<s> From your reply this laptop is not being maintained. </s>
<s> That is, it was not getting a blast of canned air on the vents every 6 months or even yearly. </s>
<s> CNET has a video about cleaning and it looks like a Thinkpad in the video. </s>
<s> Here's the link -&gt; http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-3121_7-6679060-1.html Try that and if that doesn't help, move to the heat sink replacement. </s>
<s> It's only a few dollars for the compound and I can't look for the specific model Thinkpad (no model number in the posts I could find) so here's one of many -&gt; http://support.lenovo.com/en_US/product-and-parts/detail.page?&amp;LegacyDocID=MIGR-71805 Bob </s>
<s> Aside from the wonderful hints above, (as overheating would cause the laptop to do this) I would try to verify that the laptops are good and clean with anti-virus and anti-rootkit software. </s>
<s> If it was just one laptop, sure I could see the above being true more so, but for both laptops (not out of the question) shutting down? </s>
<s> I am sure you must share files? </s>
<s> music perhaps? </s>
<s> I just start with easy then dig inside. </s>
<s> The difference in hardware also supports my decision. </s>
