I am replacing the power source on an HP computer.
Had to order the replacement and it has a 4-pin video connector and the computer has a 3-pin connection.
Can I buy an adapter to convert the connector to a 3-pin or do I need to return the power source.
The power source is smaller in size than usual (thanks HP) and finding a replacement has not been easy.
Thanks for any info you may have.
Butch
