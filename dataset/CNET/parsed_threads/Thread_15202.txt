<s> My friend is parting out a computer. </s>
<s> He has offered me his RAM and trying to determine if it will work in mine. </s>
<s> My 2006 HP pavillion a1510n (WINMCE 2005) has currently 1 gb of &quot;Dual channel memory architecture 4 x 184-pin DDR DIMM sockets support unbuffered non-ECC 400/333 MHZ DDR memory modules.&quot; My friends RAM he is giving me is Kingston DDR KVR 400/512R. </s>
<s> There is an &quot;ASME1680613&quot; written on the stick. </s>
<s> Model # of 740617076349. </s>
<s> They are both 184 pin. </s>
<s> he is giving me two of them (2 512's for a total of 1 gb)... though not specifically listed as being &quot;dual channel&quot; yet he purchased the two at the same time, just not in the same package. </s>
<s> Would that suffice as dual channel? </s>
<s> HP said that single sticks will work, just not as fast. </s>
<s> Any thoughts? </s>
<s> Thanks Wayne </s>
<s> It will be fine. </s>
<s> http://www3.shopping.com/xPO-Kingston-Technologies-512MB-DDR-SDRAM-Desktop-Memory-KVR400-512R I wonder where people are getting the idea of dual channel memory? </s>
<s> When dual channel came out no one wrote that. </s>
<s> We just needed PAIRS. </s>
<s> I guess the marketing got busy. </s>
<s> Go figure. </s>
