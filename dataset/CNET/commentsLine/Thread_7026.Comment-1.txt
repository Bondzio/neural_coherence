winxp sp3, ram 2gb,hd 160gb when i first time put my memory stick of my camcorder into the slot of the case of my computer it jolly well recognizes it and the contents get displayed very well.
i use 'safely remove hardware' icon and then remove the stick from the slot.
now supposing i want to use the memory stick again the slot does not recognize it.
i have to reboot the pc and then it gets recognized.
this cycle ---remove reboot -- remains the only solution to me at the moment.
this is true for all the memory sticks i do have here.
kindly guide if this problem could be solved?
thanks in advance.
