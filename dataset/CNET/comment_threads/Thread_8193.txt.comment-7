Having been there and done that, water cooling did help my CPU temps and did wonders for my GPU temps, but decent air cooling (case with 120mm fans, Zalman or Thermalright heatsink, Zalman VF700-AlCu GPU heatsink, Seasonic S12 series power supply) will get you quiet without the complexity and additional power consumption from a water pump that you'll get with water cooling.
Well, OK, if you have a reasonably high-powered system and want quiet, air cooling might not cut it.
Water works well there.
Plan on spending about $300 in parts to do it right.
See http://www.dangerden.com and some of the better water cooling forums like http://forums.overclockers.com.au/forumdisplay.php?f=24 if you're serious.
