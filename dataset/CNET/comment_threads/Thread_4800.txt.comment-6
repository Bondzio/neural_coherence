If you have the restore/recovery CDs, use them to reload the USB ability and/or drivers.
If you don't have them, then inquire at Acer, there maybe a small cost or argue for them as you didn't get them.
Its avaluable item to have, regardless.
The Cd should provide a menu item to load USB directly, if not then the Acer support website should provide them.
