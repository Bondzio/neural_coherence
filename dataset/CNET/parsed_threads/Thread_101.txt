<s> HI, I am at work so I do not have the info about my system other than it is an HP Pravillian two years old, has an anthlon chip, it is still not totally outdated. </s>
<s> I am running Windows XP. </s>
<s> My problem started when my husband called me at work and told me that he couldnot enter a passward to get into his section of the computer. </s>
<s> He rebooted and then it let him enter his password. </s>
<s> Then after a while he could no longer enter data into Outlook or Word. </s>
<s> SO he had to reboot. </s>
<s> after the reboot he was able to enter text again for about 30 or so minutes then it dissallowed him to enter text again. </s>
<s> I took the passwords off so we could at least get into the computer without that problem occuring. </s>
<s> I changed keyboards rebooted and it allso does it on the other keyboard. </s>
<s> I am going to get a wireless keyboard and try that to see if there is something wrong with the serial port the keyboards are plugged into. </s>
<s> in any case I was goign to get the wireless Keyboard and mouse anyway. </s>
<s> I can type a new messate when I get home to let you know what the computer sys info is. </s>
<s> Things I have done so far is try to backup all my files. </s>
<s> Delete temp files from Windows and IE7. </s>
<s> Completed all Microsoft updates. </s>
<s> Deleted all programs that I DID NOT WANT OR USE ANYMORE. </s>
<s> checked to see if there were any driver updates that were ok to install. </s>
<s> Actually my son is IT so he helped with the driver needs. </s>
<s> after we worked on it for a couple of hours he thought it may be a keybosrd problem. </s>
<s> But we then found out it was't. </s>
<s> So he told me to get a new USB or wireless Keyboard and call him back if the problems continued. </s>
<s> SO here I am going shopping for a keyboard. </s>
<s> Oh by the way I run Norton antivirus and it said there were no viruss, adware, or spyware, I also have Ad Aware and Spyware. </s>
<s> All are finding nothing at present. </s>
<s> I was just hoping that someone has had a somilar problem and knows if I am going in the right direction. </s>
<s> I hate to do a system rocervery if I don't have to do that. </s>
<s> Tell us if you cleaned the heatsinks and fan this year. </s>
<s> That time to stop working is often a sign of heat issues. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hum.....I have not completed this task, and am not sure what I should do, but how would this cause my computer to disallow me to type within a program. </s>
<s> It does not shut the system down or anything like that. </s>
<s> I have to do a reboot to be able to type again. </s>
<s> I will do that tonight and thank you for the info on the heat sinks. </s>
<s> HP said that cleaning out the computer would help with heat problems and even provided puctures on how to do it! </s>
<s> I have done this before, but regret to say that I have not done this in a while. </s>
<s> I will take the computer outside tonight and use an airsprayer to clean it out. </s>
<s> I hope it works! </s>
<s> HI, Thank you for the info about cleaning teh dust out of the computer. </s>
<s> I have to admit, I had let that task go for too long and it was filthy inside. </s>
<s> I also got a new keyboard a USB type as the one that came with the HP computer was a serial port type or a round one. </s>
<s> So whether it was the dust or the need to use a USB port Keyboard my computer seems to be working OK now. </s>
<s> I then began cleaning up a lot of other things like windows temp files and internet temp files. </s>
<s> I ran Spyware, Ad Aware, abd Norton Virus. </s>
<s> I did a security check and then fegragged the computer. </s>
<s> My computer now feels like a new car! </s>
<s> I am sure there are more things I could do like clean up the regesteries, but I am not astute enough to do that. </s>
<s> Once we fix it is to stop fixing it. </s>
<s> But keep your guard up with the AV and spyware scans... Bob </s>
