<s> I have a linksys Wireless-B Notebook Adapter (2.4 GHz/802.11b)for my Dell Inspiron 4100 computer. </s>
<s> It is probably 2 years old (the adapter). </s>
<s> The router is a LinkSys, too, and is about the same age. </s>
<s> I often have a lot of difficulty connecting to the Internet through this computer. </s>
<s> Right now, for instance, it shows connectivity very low and cannot find new IP address (REPAIR). </s>
<s> Should I buy a newer adapter - i.e. </s>
<s> do adapters wear out or go bad? </s>
<s> We have another laptop with an internal adaptor which connects just fine. </s>
<s> Adapters do not generally wear out (although there is the occasional case...think blue smoke of death) What does happen more often is they become outdated, just like any technology. </s>
<s> If you are working with 802.11b, I would upgrade to a B/G compatible adapater ASAP. </s>
<s> Most wireless networks nowadays are running the faster, more capable 54G standard, and a $30-50 PCMCIA card is the only thing separating you from the glory of high(er) speed wireless access. </s>
<s> Do remember, however, that the internet connection, not the LAN, will be the bottleneck in your case, as it is with virtually every network today. </s>
<s> But you can still benefit from the extended range and increased LAN throughput that comes from 802.11G. </s>
<s> You should try updating the Wireless-B Notebook adapter. </s>
<s> Think about it: You probably have updated your Windows operating system more than 10 times over the past 2 years (via Windows Update). </s>
<s> When was the last time you updated the driver for your wireless adapter? </s>
<s> For example, if you have a Linksys WPC11 Wireless-B Notebook Adapter, the latest driver was released on 12-FEB-2004. </s>
<s> Check out www.linksys.com. </s>
<s> Also, see if there is a firmware update to download and install on your router. </s>
<s> Just to add to what ''pigonthewing'' wrote, another advantage of G over B is better wireless security. </s>
