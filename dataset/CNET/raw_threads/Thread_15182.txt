An internet search revealed the problem was probably a bad hard drive. So we bought a new one from a computer store and I installed it. I couldn't get into BIOS to tell it to locate the new drive, though. Afterwards, I went to use the system recovery discs purchased from HP, but it's not working. I've gotten two errors: 0xc00000e9, and 0xe0ef0003. On a couple of occasions, I got to the HP recovery disc option screen, and first tried choosing to &quot;restore to factory&quot; and then, when that failed, tried telling it to check the computer. It responded that I needed to put in the first recovery disc (the one it was operating off of!), so I removed it and reinserted it, but it refused to recognize it and the drive door became unresponsive until I'd restarted the computer. Now, I can't even get to the HP recovery screen options - the error messages shut things down. My husband and I are both students - we need this computer for our classes, and I'm completely out of ideas. I'm not an expert - this was my first shot at even installing a hard drive (I used the HP whitepaper on it, and am pretty sure things went OK with that - although this failure is demoralizing). Is there anyone out there who can give me a heads up on what to do? I read after installing the HD that HP puts a secret partition so only hard drives bought from them will boot with recovery discs - is that the problem? ARRGH!!!

Try to reset the CMOS first to see if it will then boot recovery CD successfully. Consult your manual or online for how to reset CMOS.

Otherwise, it will error or complain and try to boot from HD and then goto the restore disc(CD drive). If already done and set in the bios, then you may have a further issue. HP and other provide a 2nd partition on their HDs to access the restore/recovery process. Also, this is where the creation of making your own restore/recovery discs for you usage if needed. Replacing the HD, of course removes that option. Provided you have working restore discs, then it should the process. You say you have them but encounter problems. Excluding any other issue, &quot;do you trust the restore discs&quot;? If these are factory provided, then OK, if you made them some doubt maybe at work. Otherwise, in most cases it should have started the recovery process. The other half of this is not a recovery issue but a true h/w fault with the mtrbd., bios, or related cause. If you have warranty, then use it. You can post your query in the HP forum here and see where it leads. You maybe asked to drop this one and/or be informed of any continuation of this thread. FYI- I have found HP issues to be problematic in the last few yrs. and resolving them more hassle than encountered before. While success is at hand, too often only a new part or factory supplied one seems to resolve the problem. Basically, IMHO it seems more constricted to apply true tested fixes from the past. &lt;div&gt; tada -----Willy &lt;/div&gt;

If so, then I have done that, both before and after replacing the drive. The discs are from the manufacturer. So, according to you guys, I can trust them. As far as changing any settings in BIOS, I can't even get to it. The computer gets as far as the HP screen, then freezes there. I've tried repeatedly pressing the button that would cause it to go to the options shown on the HP screen - not sure which one leads to BIOS, but I think it's the one that you press ESC for. Doesn't do anything - either I can't get in before it freezes, or the new drive lacks anything on it for it to go to. The computer does start to run the recovery disc and gets as far as the recovery homepage, so it knows it's there and is able to access it. But I can't get it to do anything from the disc. Any chance replacing the SATA cable would fix this? Or is this for sure something like the motherboard? (Computer is about three years old and out of warranty.)

In your case, since 'all else failed', what have you got to lose by reading the manual? Clues: the CMOS reset is usually a DIP switch but may vary by models, so read and find it! The BIOS entry is usually F10 for HP but again may vary, so read and find it! When you get to recovery CD homepage, what does it offer? Make sure kybd and mouse are ok. If USB type, plug in another port to try. Stop fixating on hard disk as root cause. And hardware does die, but less often than most owners think, unless broken by their owners. Troubleshooting and fixing a PC takes time and logic. Impatience is not a virtue.

Checked the HP website, which was no help on resetting CMOS, but according to what I read online in other forums, removing the button battery should've done it. No information in the manual on BIOS, but since I can't get into it, that probably wouldn't help me anyway. The keyboard is working, as is the mouse. The CD recovery homepage offers two options. One is to check the computer's functioning. The other is to restore to factory default. I've tried both. Neither of them work.

One of those keys should do it. Sometimes, HP is generic in providing info as they are similar to various HP models, so don't be too disconcerted if not directly to your model#.
