my motherboard does indeed have onboard video.
i tried unplugging my graphics card and using the onboard video and still no video.
i removed one module of my ram, since i've got a v8 cooling fan for my processor stuffed inside my case; and it blocks one of the modules of memory from being removed, meaning that one is quite snug inside it's slot.
no video using just that module.
