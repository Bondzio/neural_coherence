1.2.1	components for you .	St
1.2.2	Take your credit card to a reliable builder and tell them what you want .	St

1.4.5	You can peruse these many help forums for bits and pieces of information if it 's your intention to build this machine yourself but if your intention is to have the fastest/strongest in the world you need to know that should that objective be met you will be the champion for no more than a few seconds .

1.5.1	If I was a gamer I 'd get some i7 2+GHz based machine and then go as high on the list as I could from http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html Then I 'd get a nice display , keyboard and mouse and call it quits .	St
