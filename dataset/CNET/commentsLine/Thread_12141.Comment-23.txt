but only because it gives me better performance than similarly priced intel processors.
i never took the leap for the os because my computer is a tool for work and i couldn't justify spending a few hours setting up a dual boot system for no real world payoff.
i guess that is my point.
i consider myself to be an early adopter of many technologies (wifi, bluetooth, hdtv, tablet pc, tivo, smart display) but some of them fail to live up to their promises.
we savvy users can tolerate the let downs, but when we profess our enthusiasm to others, who follow our lead, only to then be underwhelmed by the actual performance, we might not get them to follow so willingly the next time.
