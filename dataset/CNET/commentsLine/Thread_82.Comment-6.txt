thanks compuser78 for your response.
yeah i get that the number of computers that should be able to recognize my external drive is really not the issue, as long as it was partitioned and formatted correctly.
but then you finish off with &quot;and as long as windows could read the partition off you go&quot;.
well, that's the heart of my question, which your response didn't answer!
once i correctly create 2 partitions and correctly format each of them using one computer running windows xp professional, will another computer running windows xp professional (bug-free) &quot;recognize&quot; in the typical plug and play fashion the same partitions (and formats) once i swap the drive over to that computer?
