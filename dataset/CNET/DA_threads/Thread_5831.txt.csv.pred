1.1.1	Hello I 'm going to build my own gamer PC for the first time .	St
1.1.2	I have a list of the hardware I 'm going to buy .	St
1.1.3	- Graphics card : GeForce GTX 580 - CPU : Core i7-950 - Motherboard : ASUS Rampage Extreme III Republic of Gamers - RAM : 2 x 6 GB Kingston HyperX - Hard Drive : Hitachi Deskstar 7K2000 - Blue-ray : BH10LS30 Super Multi Blue - Power Supply : Corsair TX650W It would be nice if you could make some comments about what you thought about it and may also make some suggestions on what else I can buy but it should not be much more expensive than what I 've already selected .	Sug
1.1.4	Thanks in advance	St
1.2.1	- I 've heard Antec Performance cases ( for ex .	St
1.2.2	the sx630II ) are good because they have built in filters to catch all the dust and it never gets in ur machine .	St
1.2.3	Idk if you already have a case or not .	St
1.2.4	- Make sure you have a couple fans since that is gon na generate alot of heat .	St
1.2.5	- That is an excessive amount of RAM unless youre using your computer as a server .	St
1.2.6	Nothing wrong with it but it would save you alot of money to drop to one 6Gb stick .	St
1.2.7	4Gb is sufficient for almost all games right now .	St
1.2.8	- I prefer Western Digital hard drives for myself .	St
1.2.9	If ur looking for speed maybe check out one at 10000RPM 's instead of 7200 - And hopefully youll be using Windows 7 on a machine like that .	St
1.3.1	One thing you may want to look into is a liquid cooling system .	St
1.3.2	They are not much $ these days and can help keep your system cool .	St
1.3.3	You may want to look at http : //www.frozencpu.com They have all kind of gaming ideas .	St
1.4.1	I too like Western Digital HDD .	St
1.4.2	If you look into them stick with the & quot ; BLACK & quot ; since they are built better , run cooler and have better warranties than the green or blue .	St
1.4.3	Cost a little more but are worth it .	St
1.5.1	You might want to recheck that ram .	St
1.5.2	I 'm getting the impression this mobo uses tri-channel .	St
1.5.3	4GB per slot limit and maybe 2GB per slot limit depending on speed .	St
1.5.4	I 'll let you dig into that .	St
1.5.5	http : //www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx ? model=Rampage % 20III % 20Extreme	St
