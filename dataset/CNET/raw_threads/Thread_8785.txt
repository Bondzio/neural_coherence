The power supply itself seems to be in its last days. When I start the PC up an electrical noise is noticeable coming from the supply. Plus the computer is increasingly witnessing a repeated problem. What happens is, the screen will suddenly turn off and go into the power saving state (because the graphics card stops sending a signal to the monitor), then immediately comes back on and the picture is all scrambled and the computer becomes unresponsive all together. I don't believe it is the card itself because if music or such is playing when it happens the sound will also cut off, so I think the entire system freezes. I also am unable to overclock the motherboard (even a little bit) since the system locks up after a minute or two after it boots. This also points to a power problem. So is it actually a power problem or is it sometime else I may be overlooking?

With your symptoms the first thing I would do is swap out the PSU. A GOOD 450w supply should handle your PC. But $35 450w PSU may not. John
