1.1.1	My Emachine T2682 desktop 's motherboard recently died .	St
1.1.2	I replaced the motherboard with a Biostar P4M80-M4 from TigerDirect .	St
1.1.3	Even though it is my first time , I believe I have replaced the motherboard properly and all the wires are firmly connected but when I tried to turn on my computer , no display turned up on my monitor and the lights on my keyboard would n't turn on .	St
1.1.4	However , a usb device receives power when plugged in , the fan inside the computer still spins , the lights on the hard drive and power button still turn on and the computer sounds as though it is turning on like it did before the motherboard was replaced .	St
1.1.5	I do n't understand why there is no display on my monitor as I have tested it 2 different monitors .	St
1.1.6	Any help would be appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	If you 're running XP , the system OS sees that too much has changed or it appears so , thus the OS will not run/boot .	St
1.2.2	You need to re-install the OS , but that invalidates the OS as it was supplied , read the EULA .	St
1.2.3	You need a retail version of the OS , as the OEM version wo n't allow to install or be 100 % .	St
1.2.4	Google away but the answer lies as I explained it , any other solution is outside your EULA provided .	St
1.2.5	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	I appreciate the help willy but that is not my problem .	St
1.3.2	When I turn on my computer I get no display at all .	St
1.3.3	I am running Windows XP but I can not see the Bios or boot a Linux Live CD .	St
1.4.1	OS or software .	St
1.4.2	It is true that the computer will not like to boot up when you do a major change like the MOBO but you should at least get to a point where you get error messages that new hardware is found ETC .	St
1.4.3	What was the problem that occurred to make the MOBO change ?	Ques
1.4.4	It could be that it is something else .	St
1.4.5	Was the CPU changed also ?	Ques
1.4.6	How about RAM .	St
1.4.7	When you boot up unplug all except the HDD , Mouse , Keyboard and one optical drive .	St
1.4.8	Post back .	St
1.5.1	unplug everything from the motherboard including the cpu .	St
1.5.2	now reinstall the cpu , its fan , and 1 stick of ram .	St
1.5.3	now connect the power supply to the motherboard ; be sure to connect the secondary cpu power lead if required ( a step lots of folks forget ) .	St
1.5.4	if your mobo does n't have built-in video , install your video card .	St
1.5.5	now , connect your monitor and power up the pc .	St
1.5.6	if you still do n't get any video , there 's a hardware problem with either your video card , the monitor , or the motherboard .	St
1.6.1	did you set the first display in the bios to pci card ?	Ques
1.6.2	this thells the motherboard that you have a card in instead of the onboard graphics .	St
1.6.3	i have the same board from mach speed at tiger direct and it works just fine .	St
1.6.4	tests as the fastest with fresh devices cpu benchmarks i am running a intel celeron d 3.33 gh and this board flies , ca n't wait to try a dual core in it	St
1.7.1	I thought that the motherboard had built-in video but I guess I was wrong .	St
1.7.2	I 'll go buy a video card and that should solve my problems .	Sug
1.7.3	Thanks for all your help you guys !	St
1.8.1	I have the same problem with the same motherboard .	St
1.8.2	I replaced the blown MB in my eMachines T1742 with the Biostar and now the CPU fan spins , but I do n't get any POST beeps or display .	St
1.8.3	I sent the first MB back and got a replacement , same thing .	St
1.8.4	I replaced the memory DIMM , same thing .	St
1.8.5	The board has built-in VGA , LAN , etc and nothing shows on my monitor when I power up .	St
1.8.6	I have double checked all the wiring and it 's OK .	St
1.8.7	I sent Biostar an email asking for some tech support .	St
1.8.8	I re-seated the CPU and even tried another of the same CPU I have here and still nothing .	St
1.8.9	I 've run out of ideas .	St
1.9.1	MOst T1742 's came with a 1.7 Celeron processor .	St
1.9.2	This motherboard does not work with a 1.7 Celeron .	St
1.9.3	That processor is based on the Wiilamette core and is not supported .	St
1.9.4	Check your manual for CPU support .	St
1.9.5	The original poster in this thread has a T2682 .	St
1.9.6	Most of those had a 2.6 Celeron .	St
1.9.7	It 's probably too late to help him , as his last post was 4 days ago and he was heading out to buy a video card .	St
1.9.8	If a board has a port to plug in a monitor , then it has onboard video .	St
1.9.9	That is not your problem .	St
1.9.10	Your CPU may have been damaged when the motherboard died .	St
1.9.11	The only way to find out is do what the previous answers said .	St
1.9.12	Plug in just the motherboard , cpu , keyboard , mouse , ram , and monitor .	St
1.9.13	If you do n't even get a bios screen , then you 'll know it 's a hardware problem , and nothing to do with Windows , because you do n't have a hard drive plugged in yet .	St
1.10.1	I 'm working on a friend 's box .	St
1.10.2	Having the same problem with the same model motherboard during a replacement .	St
1.10.3	I double checked , and the CPU is a Northstar .	St
1.10.4	I do n't have any spare socket 478 CPUs here , so I 'll have to take the box home to work on .	St
1.10.5	Still , it 's striking me odd that this particular model is showing up as much as it is on the search engines .	St
1.10.6	Anyone else ?	Ques
1.11.1	In such cases where nothing seems to work as stated before by a previous poster , I reduce the system to minmium .	St
1.11.2	I remove the mtrbd .	St
1.11.3	and place in on cardboard or any & quot ; non-conductive & quot ; surface .	St
1.11.4	Attach only the kybd. , psu , ram , speaker , and video .	St
1.11.5	You do n't even need the cpu , power it up and check results and see if the psu fan remains on and if beeps at all .	St
1.11.6	If it does beep like crazy , then add the cpu ( it supports ) and see if beeps goes away .	St
1.11.7	of course add cpu with power-OFF .	St
1.11.8	Attach more as things progress .	St
1.11.9	If problem remains at the beginning , then the psu is kaput .	St
1.11.10	There 's a chance the mtrbd .	St
1.11.11	maybe at fault , you ca n't do much if you ca n't get the bios at least to display .	St
1.11.12	It suggests something power or the mtrbd .	St
1.11.13	itself .	St
1.11.14	That 's about as basic it gets .	St
1.11.15	I certainly would look at any possible jumpers , or sws .	St
1.11.16	it may need to be set and review the manual , etc .	St
1.11.17	to verify all that .	St
1.11.18	But , if a user intriduced mistake is at fault from the begiing it may have taken the mtrbd .	St
1.11.19	down , especially if the real problem is a bad psu .	St
1.11.20	You just wo n't know that unless you have a spare psu to check things out .	St
1.11.21	AND if the psu took out the mtrbd .	St
1.11.22	it may reproduce the same symptoms as bad psu , it wo n't display .	St
1.11.23	In other words you have dual problems at least .	St
1.11.24	tada -- -- -Willy the mtrbd .	St
1.11.25	is now kaput due to bad psu .	St
1.12.1	The T2682 system supports PC2100 ram , while the Biostar model supports DDR400/333 , the DDR333 is th same as PC2700 .	St
1.12.2	Biostar may not like the slower PC2100 ram if it expects at least PC2700 and ca n't be changed if no bios display if possible to accept slower ram .	St
1.12.3	Just FYI .	St
1.12.4	-- -- -Willy	St
