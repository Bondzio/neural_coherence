spinrite is an outstanding program for hard drives.
steve gibson is an amazingly talented individual in both software and computer security.
it was with spinrite and cable swapping that i was able to determine that the hard drive issues with one recent client's machine were actually in the southbridge of the motherboard.
if you are going to buy an external and want to know longevity, it's going to vary.
drive lifetimes can vary.
* read the reviews, especially those that actually test performance * treat it like an internal drive - pack it carefully when moving it * make sure it has good ventilation * once a year, back up the old data, clean the drive, and then reuse -- this will help keep the magnetic data bits chipper and active * like internal drives - run maintenance programs - defrag, but also a deeper maintenance like spinrite * like desktops, make sure your power is regulated to protect the electronics (via avr on ups; that's automatic voltage regulator on uninterruptable power supply) * back up to secondary source for important/unique information, such as dvd and/or secondary drive stored at secondary location * decide if you want to buy a &quot;prebuilt&quot; external drive, or buy a kit to convert an internal to external * consider the newer technology of the bubble-memory drives; more expensive, but no internal drive mechanism to fail down the road when it comes to drives - don't skimp on quality.
i have run seagate and maxtor and wd drives.
the caviar series of wd, for me, have been not particularly fast, but extremely reliable.
speed is nice, but i'm willing to put that second to having it work reliably and for years.
that same rule should also apply to external drives.
drives that run faster also run hotter and wear out faster, and will need more cooling to maintain viability.
