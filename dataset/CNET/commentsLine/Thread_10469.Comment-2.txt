these seem no better or worse than all the lines from hp, dell, gateway and the ford or chevy pc makers.
what i do find is that acer seems to have fair out of the box experiences and you can make a set of restore dvds (and then copy those!)
then use the machine.
if you want reliable, get a toaster.
pcs are not very reliable... bob
