Basically I'm saying the current wireless/wired lan is working.
Because My friend New Laptop with windows XP pro SP1, get connected with no problem, that also why I suspecting the SP2 setting The access point is dhcp 'disabled', using WEP security, Channel is 'Auto' (it get the IP from the router which is dhcp enabled).
The Firewall I'm talking about is Windows XP firewall (this is a brand new laptop, with standard 4 software Adaware, Spybot SD, Spywareblaster and AVG 7 free) While using manual IP, I can ping the router but not external address.. when I use the dhcp enable on the laptop (I get 169.xxx.xxx.xxx) I can not ping anything.
Note: just incase you are wondering that my home wireless lan is at fault, tonight I will try in different Lan location (A friend house or in the office) Thank You
