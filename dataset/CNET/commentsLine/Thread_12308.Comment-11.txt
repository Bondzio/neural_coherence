in the last 6 years, i've had two hitachi, two wd, and two samsung drives die on me.
in their defense, the wd and samsung drives were over 60 degrees c in a poorly-ventilated case, which is beyond the rated temperature, but i'm placing my bets on my two fairly new seagate drives for now.
i have yet to see a recent seagate/maxtor drive die.
i think the last bad seagate i saw was an 80 mb 5.25&quot;.
(yes, megabyte).
