<s> Lately my computer has been freezing in the midpoint of sleep mode, i have no idea why. </s>
<s> Ive looked into i and people say it could be i need to clean my registry, so ive done that and i even tried yesterday and i had no registry files that needed to be cleaned, now i have no idea why its doing this at all. </s>
<s> Please help! </s>
<s> Have you scanned for viruses? </s>
<s> There are several good free programs, available, such as Avast and AVG. </s>
<s> But I think Avast is the best, there is a really good blog that has reviews of virus software and talks about computer issues such as yours, &lt;a href=&quot; http://thebestfreeantivirussoftware.com/&quot; &gt; http://thebestfreeantivirussoftware.com &lt;/a&gt; </s>
<s> Well ive scanned and scanned again with my Mcaffee Software and found nothing. </s>
<s> Do i need another anti virus software? </s>
