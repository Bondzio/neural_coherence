<s> Recently I've got a job... and I believe its time to upgrade my pc now.... </s>
<s> Things I wont change(yet) is my Sapphire 7870XT and my ram 8GB 1333..... </s>
<s> I've seen some hardware...but I need your help to choose good stuff... (my budget is max 650 euro) Case : http://www.aerocool.us/pgs/pgs-b/mechatron_b.htm Motherboard: http://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/Z87 Pro3/ OR http://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/Z87M Pro4/ OR http://www.msi.com/product/mb/Z87-G45-GAMING.html#overview or ASROCK Z87M EXTREME4 (which is better?) </s>
<s> SSD: http://www.samsung.com/us/computer/memory-storage/MZ-7PD128BW (does this support Trim? ) </s>
<s> CPU: INTEL CORE I5-4670K 3.40GHZ LGA1150 OR INTEL CORE I7-4770K 3.50GHZ LGA1150 (since I use my pc mostly for games...I believe i5 is enough...) CPU cooler: coolermaster Hyper 212 Evo what do u think? </s>
<s> Pls suggest me more hardware if its better and at same price range... </s>
<s> I'd stay with the I5. </s>

<s> I'll assume your going to put the OS and your games on this unit. </s>
<s> Some games can grab big chunks of storage. </s>
<s> You might be in for an exercise in cleaning. </s>
<s> any other replys? </s>
