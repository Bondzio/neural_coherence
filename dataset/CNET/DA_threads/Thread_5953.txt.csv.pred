1.1.1	Does anyone know where I can learn what the ideal CPU temperature is ?	Ques
1.1.2	I 've heard 45 deg C when not being used and 65 deg C when heavily active .	St
1.1.3	I 've been annoyed with my fan running at 80 % all the time to ensure that my CPU stays cool .	St
1.1.4	So I just lowered it to around 65 % and now my temperature hovers around 65 % when I 'm gaming .	St
1.1.5	I want to make sure I 'm not going to blow the darn thing up .	St
1.1.6	Thanks ahead of time .	Sug
1.2.1	heatsink fan you 're running ... kinda difficult to provide any further response .	St
1.2.2	Download and run CPUZ ... then repost specifics .	St
1.2.3	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	I still have a prescott p4 3.6ghz and it idles at 52-57 C , but than the local temp is in the high 80s F. My P4 has gone up to over 100 degrees celcius , w/ no fan because for some reason , the automatic shutdown failed on me , and nothing happened to the processor ... I 'm using that computer right now to type out this response .	St
1.3.2	Highly not recommended to try at home .	St
1.4.1	CPUZ is a great program by the way .	St
1.4.2	Processor ( s ) Number of processors	St
1.5.1	Maybe you need a better , higher performance CPU heatsink fan ... one that 's quieter .	St

1.6.1	I have just completed the setup of my new vista HTCP .	St
1.6.2	I am using the il-90mv .	St
1.6.3	Core 2 Duo 2 Ghz .	St
1.6.4	Nmedia 200A case .	St
1.6.5	Install went pretty well , I even got the Viiv software installed and working correctly .	St
1.6.6	My issue is the CPU temp .	St
1.6.7	The nmedia case has two temperature sensors that display CPU and Case temp on the VFD.The CPU temp starts around 75 F and within 30 minutes heads up to about 93F .	St
1.6.8	It will then stay at 93 F for as long as I have it on .	St

1.7.1	I did n't realize that utility actually tells you the temperature .	St
1.7.2	Thanks again	St
1.8.1	I have an Athlon 64 3200+ Venice on socket 754 ( its ancient but it works for me along with Vista ) connected to a Thermaltake Golden Orb II with no fan control but running at 2200RPM tops and Arctic Silver 5 grease .	St
1.8.2	It is very good if it runs 20^C but anything under probably may be sensors incorrection up to what you said .	St
1.8.3	Anything higher , you should probably turn off the machine and check if the heatsink is properly attached or if the Thermal grease needs to be wiped and freshly applied .	St
1.8.4	If there is no grease but a tape , buy a small pack of Arctic Silver 5 which is usually around 5 bucks and apply a bead size or a specific amount that Intel/AMD recommends .	St
1.8.5	Whoever told you 45^C needs to do some more research ...	St
1.9.1	If those temperatures are in Fahrenheit , then it should usually be around 35^C for 75^F and 40 to 50ish for the 90s .	St
1.9.2	I 'm just guessing these conversions but I assure you if those are fahrenheit and not celcius then it is fine	St
