<s> I use my Epson Stylus PHOTO 785EPX printer a lot and it seems that I have to do the Head Cleaning routine every two or three days, usually the black ink check pattern has gaps. </s>
<s> Ayway, I found the following site that has a lot of information about Epson head cleaning and a link to download a program, SSC Service Utility, that allows cleaning selected print heads instead of all of them: http://www.maxpatchink.com/epson-tips.shtml I haven't tried the single head cleaning yet but the SSC Service Utility looks interesting and does all kinds of stuff with the printer. </s>
<s> By the way, I refill my cartridges and have excellent results although I am sure refilling isn't for everyone...and don't tell me the refill ink clogs the heads. </s>
<s> I don't clean the heads any more than I had to with new Epson ink cartridges. </s>
<s> Interesting post, Fitz, As a printer engineer (mostly...) my company insists that if the user is using refills/3rd party consumables we should walk away! </s>
<s> I had HP refills a few years ago for my deskjet 690c and they were terrible - ink bled, smudged, took a long time to dry, etc. </s>
<s> Recently I needed to print some stuff but was skint, so I went to a local Cartridge World-type place. </s>
<s> The result really impressed me, and I would recommend the shop. </s>
<s> However, where Laser Toner Cartridges are concerned, the story is not so good. </s>
<s> I have seen leaks of toner, poor quality due to the drum having marks on it, or repeated lines caused by problems within the cartridges. </s>
<s> They don't seem to last very long, either, so maybe Toners are in a different league from ink cartridges:-) </s>
<s> One of the things the SSC Service Utility does is make my printer produce a horrible grinding noise when I used the utility to &quot;Move head to exchange position&quot;. </s>
<s> So pass on this utility. </s>
