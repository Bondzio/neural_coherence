1.1.1	Specs : Two laptops running Windows Vista x86 Belkin G Wireless Router Cable internet with at least 6mbps connection When one laptop is running Skype , MSN , Chrome , and MMORPG , the second has significant difficulty accessing the Internet via any web browser - slow speed , lag , pages hanging , unable to load , etc .	St
1.1.2	It does n't matter if the second laptop is connected first to the Internet , adding the second , especially with the IM programs and/or the MMORPG causes the issues with the second laptop .	St
1.1.3	I do n't have a lot of knowledge regarding home networks/networking as my knowledge trends more towards the hardware/software aspects of computer function .	St
1.2.1	I used a second router as an access point ( see post 18 of this forum 's sticky for how . )	St
1.2.2	20 bucks later I had a second router serving up 802.11b for the other machines and I get my own WPA 802.11g connection all to myself .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Your problem could be in 2 places .	St
1.3.2	Since you say you have 6m internet be sure one machine is not using it all .	St
1.3.3	Most likely you will not get 6m anyway but you should be able to tell from a screen on your router how much each machine is using .	St
1.3.4	The more likely reason is that you have a wireless issue .	St
1.3.5	The machine that is closer to the access point will almost always be able to use more since in effect it can yell louder than one that is further away .	St
1.3.6	You also have the slim possibility that the router is running out of processor capacity .	St
1.3.7	With 2 machines its unlikely but this is why a commercial access point cost more money .	St
1.3.8	To test this I would get some long lan cable and run them over the floor temporary .	St
1.3.9	Even attaching just one machine via LAN and the other wireless will help in testing .	St
1.3.10	If you still have issues with both lan to the router then you have a lack of internet bandwidth ... even though they say you have 6m .	St
1.3.11	If your router has QoS ( quality of service ) you can somewhat give certain application priority .	St
1.3.12	This is a advanced network topic that is hard to explain in a forum .	St
1.3.13	If it works cabled then you have a wireless issue .	St
1.3.14	Again some routers have the ability to run QoS to solve this .	St
1.3.15	A couple of thing you can try is to change the & quot ; channel & quot ; you are running on .	St
1.3.16	You may get better signal reception or reduce interference on one of the machines .	St
1.3.17	As a last resort temporary turn off the encryption .	St
1.3.18	This is not a good thing to do but will show if the router is out of capacity .	St
1.3.19	Things like games or any streaming media transmit constantly so they tend to talk over anyone else .	St
1.3.20	Unfortunately wireless is like the old days of networking with everyone competing for the same bandwidth .	St
1.3.21	... . A last thought make sure you are running G on both PC .	St
1.3.22	You can not really run B and G off the same router .	St
1.3.23	Some routers will attempt to switch back and forth or they will just slow to B only .	Sug
