I have an external seagate harddrive inside an enclosure.
lately there has been a problem.
If i copy files to my harddrive, i can do whatever i want to them, and they aren't corrupt.
However, if i delete them, i dont free anymore space.
After i ran out of space, ( while the hdd was empty) i formatted it.
There is now 75gb free, but the same problem is happening.
