didn't think the heat would be a problem, but it seems as though it could be.
with the upgrade i replaced the motherboard, cpu, memory, case and psu and everything worked fine.
it's only recently the problem started happening, so was reluctant to think the heat could be the problem and thought it was down to the remote registry service running on startup which i was told about by an i.t.
technician where i work, or some sort of software corruption to the mouse drivers or registry.
anyway, taking the cover off seems to solve the problem, so would investing in another fan solve the prob?
