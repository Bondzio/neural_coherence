We had a Dell Dimension 3000 power supply fail when shorted by a live bug; not a PS fault.
I had other new name-brand PS's on hand that wouldn't fit in the case.
My guru said Dell has the supply re-packaged to offset one of the four mounting holes so only the Dell mechnically fits.
Otherwise, the 3000 has been reliable for over three years.
I'm about to get an HP P6150T (special sale) because my built-system motherboard died and is NLA.
Maybe I'll get some on-topic HP info for here.
