I have never had a problem until now. When I installed Call of Duty 2, I got an error message that my video card did not support alpha blending, which was strange to me because I have two other Call of Duty games as well as many other pc games that never gave me a problem. I looked at the NVIDIA web site to see about downloading an update, but I'm nervous about picking the correct one. Can anybody tell me which download is the right one?

How can I get my display (desktop picture, icon size and internet display, etc.)to be the same size as before? If I use system restore, will it take out the newly downloaded driver? Is there another way to change the display? Some of the page is so far off the screen that I can't even get to the arrow to move it across the page. Sue
