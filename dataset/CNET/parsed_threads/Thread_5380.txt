<s> I just got a computer case to build a computer, and i need to decide which Motherboard i need.. Im looking for a not so expensive but good quality that has 2 PCIe x16 slots at least, and 2 or more PCI slots, 4 or more USB ports, and a socket 755 CPU connector thing. </s>
<s> I was thinking a nVidia nForce 600 series, but i want to know if theres anything that is better, for the same, maybe a little more. </s>
<s> Also, if its bundled with a CPU that would be great, but it isnt that important. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Also, its got to be ATX form factor, and compatible with 800mhz memory </s>
<s> 650i will be less expensive. </s>
