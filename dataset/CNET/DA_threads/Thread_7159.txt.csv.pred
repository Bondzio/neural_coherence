1.1.1	I 'm using Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit on a eMachines ET1831-07 with 4GB of RAM and a Pentium Processor .	St
1.1.2	Yesterday , I plugged in an HP OfficeJet 4215xi printer and set it up for network printing .	St
1.1.3	When I tried to print from Vista 32-bit Home Premium , the printer refused to print .	St
1.1.4	I checked the queue , and it 's showing the document and a & quot ; Remote Downlevel Document. & quot ; I 've researched it and I know that it 's causing the problem , but I ca n't figure out why it wo n't delete from the queue .	St
1.1.5	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.2.1	I suggest you reboot the whole shebang and the try the removal/delete of pending document to print before anything else .	Sug
1.2.2	If it fails then , then be sure the printer is acknowledged as default , etc. , to be active , do n't swap USB ports , return to actual port .	St
1.2.3	Otherwise , the printer port resets to # 1 , # 2 , start to collect , delete all those and reboot .	St
1.2.4	Now , when the USB port acknowledges the printer ( default ) , then send to print document .	St
1.2.5	This problem is also present to non-networked printers .	St
1.2.6	tada -- -- -- Willy	St
