Some move a drive like that and hope the software keeps running (from the old drive). You can guess the result. -&gt; Also, XP will mark the drive as non-bootable and others weep as they have to repair it when they stick it back in the old machine. Bob

I assume that its flat cable will fit into the regular IDE slot of the mobo, but won't be able to share the cable of the primary SATA drive. By the way, what are the short pci express slots for? Thanks.

I am currently running a Maxtor 200GB SATA drive as the master and a Maxtor 120GB IDE drive as the slave. You must be sure to set the jumpers to master and slave, this should be identified by the diagram on the drive. I am using the appropriate cables for each drive. You will have to ensure your motherboard can accommodate and additional IDE drive, same as the CD/DVD Rom. I hope this helps.

Windows manages the two hard drives separatly so you shouldn't have any problems. I have my SATA drive setup as the primary because I bought a Wester Digital Raptor Drive (10K rpm) which is a bit faster than the normal SATA drives. and my standard ATA100 drive is a secondary. I installed Windows on the SATA drive. I built this computer myself and haven't had any problems with this configuration.

You cannot mix the two on the same controller to my knowlege. I have an Intel motherboard with two built in IDE controllers and two built in SATA controllers. I'm running 4 IDE/ATAPI devices (160GB HD, 80GB HD, CD-RW Drive, and a DVD/CD-RW Drive) on my IDE controllers. I've had a 200GB SATA running off my separate SATA controller for three months now. No problem. You won't have a problem. Your mobo sounds similiar to mine. You should have a spare IDE controller or at least a spare channel/port. If your system didn't have any spare IDE ports, then you could buy a separate IDE/ATA/ATAPI controller card that plugs into an empty PCI slot. Same goes for SATA controllers. I think some SATA drives have legacy IDE plugs on them, but I'd only use the SATA plug with the small serial cable.

Depending upon your bios and startup options, if it is like mine you have the option either within the bios, or at startup, which drive to choose as the primary. I have OS's on both drives and can boot from either by selecting which one I want to be the primary at startup(note this will have an effect on drive letters). When running more than one OS on multiple drives you can use this option, or if running a properly installed NT/2000/XP, you can add boot options into the boot.ini. There are a few additional considerations to take into account if you are running multiple SATA drives in a RAID array (like making sure all OS's are installed with RAID drivers) but this can be made to work as well.

My primary was a SATA and 2nd hd bay was an IDE. My SATA conked out, and I wanted to get up and running right away, w/o buying an expensive SATA at a brick&mortar store nor wait 5 days for a it to ship in from online, so I just used my 2ndary IDE and swapped it to primary where my OS and other stuff is. I'll be having a SATA later on for my slave drive. It's better to have SATA for primary, but the speed wouldn't be a big difference

I can boot off the SATA only if I have no IDE drives attached. There is no option on the mobo to boot from SATA. So I'm going to have to upgrade to be able to boot from SATA and add back all my IDE drives. I haven't found an upgrade for the mobo so I can make the SATA (WD Raptor) my boot drive. Any other ideas out there? Thanks, Laurie

I have two SATA drives as my main drives, and I have two IDE drives (one refuses to operate), so I installed the one IDE drive into my system, and have had no compatibility problems at all. The only problem I've had though is with both SATA drives when I had to format my C: drive to do a fresh install of Windows 2000 - each drives' last partition became free space and I lost valuable data. I was told because I wiped out a registry entry (related to the SATA drive setup) and there was a problem due to the fact Windows 2000 can't see anything over 135 GB without this entry - these drives are each 200 GB's. I have still been unable to recover the lost data, using recovery programs, etc., I think the info is still there, but I'm not going to pay a high price to get the info recovered manually! I've wised up and I now image my main system drive and restore the image if I ever have a crash.

I have a Gigabyte motherboard that will take 4 SATA drives, 2 PATA drives and 2 CD/DVD drives so I can use the PATA drives in a RAID Array as the mobo came with Intel software for this.

The problem of reinstalling Windows on a SATA boot device still happens with XP, but almost the first message from Windows asks you to &quot;press F6 to install a Raid controller&quot;. But it only recognizes a floppy as the source for the SATA controller. So be sure you have the driver on a floppy and it should have come with your motherboard. That way it will recognize your Sata drives and install Windows on the drive you select to be the boot drive. I would advise disabling IDE Hard Drives by temporarily removing their power connectors so you can't accidently make a mistake and boot from the IDE drive.

I just rebuilt my PC using an ASUS A7V880 Mobo, AMD AthlonXP 2800+ with 1Gb RAM. I can boot off of the SATA drive regardless, but the OS (WinXP Pro) will not see the IDE drive. It sees any other IDE drive attached, but not the HDD. I have tried setting it up as Master, Slave, Cable Select, Primary, Secondary...all to no avail. Did you ever find out what your possible problems could be? I can't get these 2 drives to coexist & am wondering what I am doing wrong. If you find out any good info, please let me know...thanx!

Therefore most people can run 6 devices note that each sata connector MUST NOT be shared you may only connect 0 - 2 sata devices and 0 - 4 IDE devices.If you need more devices you can add more device controllers in a PCI slot and you can add data storage devices as USB devices, if you get crazy don't forget to upgrade your power supply. There are two things to keep in mind, do not overload your power supply or strange difficult problems will begin to occur and make the correct BIOS settings for your data storage device complement. I'm using an Asus P4P800-VM mobo and it requires an advanced (not for beginners says the user guide) BIOS setting to use both serial-ata and parallel-ata devices. Enhanced mode device support must be set on to use a mixed device configuration. My best advice is read your documentation if you don't understand it have your dealer help you and then do what it says, and really be certain to use an adequate power supply. I'm using 3 maxtor HD's 80 & 120 gb sata + 200 gb pata, and 3 dvd burners BENQ 1625, & 1610, + LG GSA 4163B. An ATI aiw 9600 video & Creative SB audio card + web cams and dual monitors + TV, Logitech thx 560 watt surround sound and serving a small lan and sharing my HP1210 PSC on the LAN. Oh yes and too many fans trust me about the power supply problems I'm removing some fans so I hope that I don't have to replace my power supply, mixing sata and pata is great otherwise.

GET DATA BACK FOR NTFS SEARCH AND RECOVER 2.5 EASY RECOVERY PRO 6 PARTITION MAGIC 8 no luck with getting data back.the only files i was able to retrieve was simple deleted files. Problem 2 now i have 2 hard drives with windows on them.so i set the ide to a slave and reboot reformated the ide drive set it back as a master.when i tried to boot bios seen the ide drive but windows didnt used windows disk management did a delete partition create partition format partition.windows seen the drive.next day windows cant see the drive again.tried to do another format.came up with error (the operation did not complete because the partition or volume is not enabled. to enable the partition or volume,restart the computor.) did the restart still no luck. question 1 what is the best program to get back original files i had? question 2 would it be best to use ide drive for operating system and use the sata drives as storage drives?

Solution: 1. Convert all partitions on IDE HDs to extended. (This option maybe optional) 2. Because Windows, and system, detect HD SATA and primary IDE HD in ID 0 Bus 0 ATAPI, i move my IDE HDs to secondary IDE Channel e move my DVD/CDROM to primary IDE Channel. 3. Temporaly desativate secondary IDE Channel, while installing windows on HD SATA, because windows insist in write MBR both HD SATA and old IDE boot HD. 4. After boot windows xp/operating system on HD SATA, i re-activate IDE HDs and after backup data, repartitioned like i want. 5. Ready to use, my system boot by HD SATA and use HD IDE as swap and backup drives. It's all.

Tudo funcionando com Windows XP e Linux __[ Problema ]__________________________________________ Resolvi colocar um HD Seagate 250 SATA-2, mas aps instalar o windows xp e ativar este HD como primeiro dispositivo de boot, recebi a mensagem &quot;Erro ao carregar sistema operacional&quot; e em alguns momentor &quot;Error loading operating system&quot;. __[ Tentativas ]________________________________________ Tentei desabilitar o canal ide primrio, tentei carregar os drivers sata_ide fornecidos pela ASUS (fabricante da placa-me). No funcionou. Apesar da instalao do windows detectar o HD, sem precisar dos drivers SATA, aps instalar data o problema. Tentei no desabilitar o canal IDE primrio e no colocar o HD SATA como primeiro dispositivo de boot. Funciona, mas s porque existe o HD IDE como primrio. Assim, o gerenciador de boot do windows, NTLOADER, fica no HD primary master e carrega os arquivos e depois carrega o resto do windows no HD SATA. Mesmo assim no era isso o que eu queria. __[ Objetivo a ser solucionado ]_______________________ Eu queria e quero que funcione o HD SATA como primeiro dispositivo de boot e que o windows e o linux o utilizem para gravar seus gerenciadores de boot, ainda quero utilizar os HDs IDE como backup, swap, memria virtual. __[ Soluo ]__________________________________________ Aps vrias pesquisas e vrias tentativas, as dicas passadas me levaram a conseguir resolver o problema e observar algums coisas. 1. transformei as parties dos HDs IDEs em estendidas. Talvez este item seja opcional 2. durante a instalao do windows notei que tanto o HD SATA quanto o HD IDE Primary Master, apareciam como ID0 no Barramento 0 atapi, ou seja, eles &quot;concorriam&quot; para ser o primeiro dispositivo, desta forma o Windows queria gravar a MBR em ambos. 3. Resolvi isso invertendo a ordem dos dispositivos IDE, ou seja, o DVD/CDROM passou a ser instalado no canal IDE primrio, sendo o Primary Master, e colocando os outros HD no canal IDE secundrio. 4. reiniciei a instalao do windows e o HD SATA passou a ser o primeiro dispositivo, e os outros HDs respectivamente, segundo e terceiro dispositivos da listagem. NOTA: no precisei pressionar o F6 durante o incio da instalao do windows, com isso no utilizei quaisquer drivers especficos para enxergar o dispositivo SATA. O Windows reconheceu o HD SATA como estando no barramento ATAPI/IDE. 5. Mesmo assim o windows queria gravar informao no MBR do antigo disco de boot do Windows, para isso desativei temporariamente no setup este disco, para poder concluir a instalao do windows. 6. Conclui a instalao do windows com sucesso, e depois pude iniciar o sistema via HD SATA sem problemas. 7. Ativei o HD IDE desativado no item 5. O sistema continuou iniciando como feito no item 6. 8. Aps backup do contedo, reformatei os HDs IDE para se adequarem s minhas necessidades. 9. Pronto, tudo funcionando e pronto para receber o linux. Espero ter ajudado, pois as diversas discusses na internet, inclusive essa colocada por diversos participantes, me ajudaram a chegar na soluo que atendia minha vontade. []s Claudio

I put in a new motherboard recently and couldn't figure out why I could no longer access my IDE HD. I have a sata HD running as my main drive and another IDE HD, formerly my main one, that I use for music files and backup storage. It used to work but after the mobo install the bios recognized an unknown drive instead of the other hd. It was driving me crazy. Jumper settings did nothing. Nothing showed in Windows XP at all-didn't show up in disk management either. I've looked all over but couldn't find anything related to this issue online. I finally read your post and remembered that was how I had altered it before(accidentally, about a year and a half ago) to get it to work. The IDE HD had to be on the secondary IDE cable in order for it to be recognized by the sata drive. I just switched the cables, put my dvd and cd writer drives on the primary IDE cable instead, restarted, and voila! My drive lettering is messed up now A:floppy C:SATA HD ------ ok so far, then F:dvd emulator G:IDE HD H:cdrw I:dvd No d: or e:? Before, the cd and dvd drives were e: and f:, the hd(when it was recognized) was still g: Not sure why it happened (I might try removing all emulation drives first and see what happens-that's a known issue with drive lettering iirc) but it's a minor issue compared to not being able to retrieve my music/ITunes folder and backup info.

My configuration is as follows: Intel P4D; Intel chipset/mobo; 1 - Seagate Barracuda 7200 RPM 320GB SATA Drive --&gt; this is my main OS drive {connected to SATA 0} 2 - 300 GB maxtor IDE drive {connected to SATA 1} 3 - 200 GB Maxtor IDE drive {connected to SATA 3} I have a SATA adapter on the 2 IDE drives, hence their connection to the SATA ports on the mobo. I have 2 DVD drives on the IDE cable. I have ensured that with the SATA adapter on the IDE drives, the jumper settings on the IDE drives are all set to master. Prior settings of the jumpers to &quot;slave&quot; would result in no boot screen at all upon powering on. That mistake recognized and rectified, I still cannot figure out why XP won't load under my current setting. The BIOS settings have been set so that SATA 0 is the drive to boot from (the true SATA drive). In the BIOS, the system is recognizing the other HDD's connected to SATA 1 and 2 without a problem. SATA 1 has my old image on it (also XP), and when I set SATA 1 as the drive to boot from, I get the same problem of Windows freezing at the black &quot;Windows XP logo&quot; start up screen. Anyone know how to overcome this? Thanks.
