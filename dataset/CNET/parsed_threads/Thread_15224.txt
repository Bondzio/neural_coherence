<s> Hello - I'm shopping around for a new video card, and I noticed that there are a number of cards that appear to be ATI cards, but have a different brand name. </s>
<s> For example, I found a &quot;Sapphire ATI Radeon X800 PRO Video Card&quot; in one online store. </s>
<s> My question is, is there any difference between cards like this and the ones labeled specifically ATI, other than the price? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> They use the model ATI chip advertised, but they may set it up entirely differently, including the rate that they clock the memory or set other parameters. </s>
<s> Some sites provide the clocking info. </s>
<s> Thanks for the info, I'll remember to look into that. </s>
