Greetings everyone, I just did a clean Windows Xp install on my laptop and I have run into problems setting up my wireless conection.
Thing is, I cannot set up my wireless connection if my wireless (adapter?)
cannot even turn on/off.
The only way I know how to do this is by pressing FN+F2 on my keyboard.
So if anyone knows another way to turn it on or off or what could be the problem of my keyboard's fn+f2 not functioning properly, any advice is greatly appreciated.
btw: the dimming of the monitor's brightness by pressing fn+f7 or Fn+F8 work, so It is not the keyboard malfunctioning.
Specs: Gateway 7330Gz Windows Xp SP2 Pentium 4 3.20Ghz 480Mb of Ram one more thing, The option to go to Stand-by is grayed out on the &quot;Turn off Computer&quot; options and I cannot put my system to stand-by, any fix to this?
