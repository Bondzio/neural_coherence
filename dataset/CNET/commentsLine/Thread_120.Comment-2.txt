i'm certainly no sound expert, but i've used many different speakers over the years.
harmon kardon, altec, nec, to name a few of them.
i have an older pair of nec desktop speakers that i've used for the past 4 or 5 years.
when playing music, none of the others, that i have experienced, seem to sound as good.
they are approximately twice as large as most newer models.
i suspect that may have something to do with it.
