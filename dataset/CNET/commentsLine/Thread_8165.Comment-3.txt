other than the eyetv, i don't really have a not of experience with these products.
when i look over specs, it's very confusing and not very enlightening in trying to determine &quot;which one?&quot;.
in particular, i do want to be able to get digital channels, even without a set-top box or antenna like the eyetv does and especially to be prepared once the digital transition occurs (soon).
i was hoping to get a little more guidance than just finding a source for a list of products.
