my dell desktop is 7 years old and and laptop is 5. i've been storing backup data on discs (i try to remember to do this every month, and i make 2 copies).
i'm afraid of one of these machines suddenly &quot;dying&quot; and taking all of my records with it.
but most of the info that i backup is retrievable from other sources (go ahead and laugh, but i still keep paper copies of my business files) so if i lost them it would be a lot of work, but i would be able to get everything back into a new computer system.
however, i bought a digital camera several months ago.
i have been keeping all of the photos on discs, but i read that after a few years discs can become unstable and the photos may be lost.
so should i get an external hard drive to store the photos on?
so far, i've taken about 2,000 photos and these are taking up a lot of space on my laptop.
how do i store them safely, and for an extended period?
and should i also be storing my business files on an external hard drive?
i was researching brands and several reviews mentioned that the user plugged in the external hd one day and it just didn't work.
this happened with a few different brands and i'm wondering what happens in that case.
is the information remain retrievable (such as the thousands of photos) or would all be lost?
i apologize for sounding so &quot;scattered&quot;.
although i am relatively comfortable with my computers and how they work, it has taken me years to be so.
any problems just put me into panic mode.
i would appreciate any help that anyone can give me.
thanks!
