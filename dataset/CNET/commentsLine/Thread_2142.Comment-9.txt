i think (i may be wrong) you have to create a user account for everyone, on that pc (the one with windows 2k and the printer...) make sure anyone or everyone can access each other .. or atleast to the pc with the printer ... and usually, you connect a printer to a pc, install a driver, enable files and printer sharing, add printer to the other pc (install driver if needed)... .. your way of accessing the printer via network places .. is common on a printer server environment (where the printer is connected to a printer server) again i may be wrong... merry christmas and happy new year...
