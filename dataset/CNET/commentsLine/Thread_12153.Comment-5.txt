thanks willy, this is what i thought.
just to clarify anyway, i'm running xp sp3, on a dell dimension 5190. an old machine but its suits my needs.
there are two hdds.both 149gb.
i'm a hobbist using daz3d, and over time, its grown to 100gb, so i currently have 8g free, and thats after deleting a load of stuff i use rarely i'm getting a seagate 2tb sata-600 7200rpm 64mb barracuda.
i had thought that maybe i could go into the bios, make it my master, install the os, then change back to the original set up, and continue to install onto the new drive at my leisure.
a shot in the dark, but worth asking, i suppose
