i totally agree.
that's why i upgraded the router for a gigabit wired connection.
but, the wireless is essential for remote services like our phones, pods, laptops, guests that are not near the wall, etc.
wireless is totally convenient, but i opt for wired as well whenever possible.
all my desktops are wired, my tv is wired, my bd player is wired, etc.
that alone makes streaming movies and music through our new samsung products and dlna products a dream, 8mbps or 12 and gigabit if local.
clearly 12mbps would be better (especially during peak traffic hours).
