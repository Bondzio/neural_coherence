Windows Explorer only shows partitioned drives.
Is that second drive partitioned?
You need to go to the disk management tool in the control panel under administrative functions/computer management.
It's possible XP sees it as unpartitioned space.
You'd need to click on it and follow the prompts to partition and format it.
Once done, it gets a drive letter and Explorer can see it.
