The green led of the power and the yellow of the battery flashes continuesly. I have pulled all the parts out and put every part one by one and nothing helped. So i pulled the CPU out and placed this after 8 hours again. I cleaned the cpu-cooler with air. all the dust went out. After putting all the parts the notebook starts working again, when i press the power-button. Only the screen went sometimes black when i moved it open. So i thought the connector went off or didn't put in well. I opened it again and opened LCD screen too. Put all the connectors in. Now the notebook is not working again. The led's are flashing. Oo, i forget to mention this. My wife has find out how to start the notebook. With the key combination SHIFT+power button. Only power button does not help to start it. Does anyone know what is this with my notebook?
