<s> i ordered up a 256 MB GeForce 7900GS GPU, just a few minutes, they called up and said that they would give me, instead, a 256 MB GeForce 8500GT GPU... i said yeah! </s>
<s> of course, then i checked it out and found out that it's not better than the 7900 (i think) coz of the memory interface and memory support! </s>
<s> can someone check this out? </s>
<s> http://www.palit.biz/en/products/nv_pcie_7900GS.html http://www.palit.biz/en/products/nv_pcie_8500GT.htm#spec btw, here's my computer specs: Pentium 4 3.0 GHz Intel D915GAV mobo 500W Power Supply 2x 320GB Seagate SATA HDD 1.5GB DDR400 RAM * i think other specs such as optical drives are not necessary also, if anyone can tell me what the memory interface and support are for, it would be greatly appreciated... it's urgent since they're ordering it from their supplier and are delivering it to me in 2 days! </s>
<s> need to answer this so i can tell them which one i would really get! </s>
<s> THANKS </s>
<s> the 8500GT is bullsh*t! </s>
<s> after going into some benchmark scores, i found out that i was really REALLY weak! </s>
<s> i'm better off with the 7900GS even though it doesn't support any DX10 games... this is just to tell people that don't get the 8500GT with the SAME PRICE as the 7900GS! </s>
<s> good thing i was able to change my order to the original! </s>
<s> here's the link to the benchmark scores: http://forumz.tomshardware.com/hardware/8500GT-benchmark-ftopict233848.html </s>
<s> and faster than 8600gts in most games. </s>
<s> http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.aspx?i=2975&p=2 if palit is trying to sell you a 8500gt for the same price as a 7900gs, they're ripping you off. </s>
<s> 7900gs are going for about $155USD and 8500gt are only $90USD. </s>
<s> 8600gt runs about $125-$155USD (depending on clock speed) and 8600gts is about $170-$200USD. </s>
<s> The only really &quot;good&quot; DX10 cards that are out there right now are the 8600 GTS, 8800 GTS and 8800 GTX as well as the 8800 Ultra. </s>
<s> All of the other ones are crap. </s>
<s> For now, unless your a hardcore gamer who wants tobe on the bleeding edge, stick with the Geforce 7 series. </s>
