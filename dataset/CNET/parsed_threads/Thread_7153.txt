<s> I have a lot of rare stuff on VHS I need to transfer to DVD. </s>
<s> Can anyone recommend a video card with s-video inputs, perhaps bundled with some basic, yet decent video editing software. </s>
<s> I have a VCR with S-outs and just need the video card. </s>
<s> I built this computer a few years ago and it should be up to specs... </s>
<s> It currently has Windows XP Pro; 512 RAM; and an AMD 2100 Athelon CPU. </s>
<s> how about look for a video capture card; or maybe a dvd recorder instead. </s>
