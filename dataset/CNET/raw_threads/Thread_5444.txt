The connection is great and the computers communicate, just one problem minor problem. WinXP can view the &quot;Shared Files&quot; of WinME computer Thru its Network Places - No Problem But when WinME attempts to view the &quot;Shared Files&quot; Of WinXP Thru it's Network Places, it causes WinXP to restart the computer without notification Is there anyway this can be fixed, thanx

I don't know why you do it that way, but many people will connect the Cable modem to the Router, then the pc's go to the router port. This way you don't have to use Internet connection sharing (and turning on other pc) As for your problem, it can be the firewall or your internet connection sharing conflicting configuration.
