Thank you so much for your information.
I am a little hesitant to do that because I was told that the Dell power supplies for that model have a flaw.
The flaw is that they run hot and burn up the copper wire.
I was hoping to find a better power supply that does not have that issue.
Thank you again at least the dell power supply is better then none at all right....
Thank you again and have a great day!
