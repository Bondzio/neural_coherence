I put the original XP driver back, and still only landscape, no matter what I try. The default is set to letter. I have had this problem with other networked HP printers. Any suggestions?

You should go to Properties and find a variety of options. One would be landscape or portrait. Is there no option to do that at all? As well, you said it was networked? How is this done? Does the printer have it's own network interface card....is it shared on another PC (and, if so, what OS is on that PC), or are you using a print server? If it's networked, can you connect it directly to your PC instead to see if it will work that way?
