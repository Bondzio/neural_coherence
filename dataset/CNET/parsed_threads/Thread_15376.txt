<s> Samsung 10.1 ATT OS 4.1.2 using FF browser that started crashing daily and many times multiple times......Mozilla search must added to more frustration. </s>
<s> ....did a OS update and ATT had none.....yes. </s>
<s> leared cache and if I clear all data then it means anothe half hour trying to remember how I set up sync again... </s>
<s> The selling point of FF is the ability to use the SYNC function and can access all webpags in my bookmarks with password log ins if an other browser did this I would dump FF in a second...... </s>
<s> So now awaiting your feedback.....thanks much.... </s>
<s> Be sure to repeat this crash to the developers. </s>
<s> With that out of the way I'm finding a new type of computer user out there. </s>
<s> This new type seems to think all this software is debugged and without issues. </s>
<s> I'm unsure what makes them think this stuff is ready for error free use. </s>

<s> I'm an old geezer user but tablets are new to me....not naive about software but FF initially worked fine within a month it declined quickly.....to the point lf not being useable. </s>
<s> ...to me then it become a problem not a mere inconvenience..... </s>
<s> Was an early beta and did have issues. </s>
<s> Later Google issued Chrome and that seems to work more smoothly with the system. </s>
<s> No doubt the Chrome team has easy access to Android developers. </s>
<s> As it stands you see the same old story as before. </s>
<s> Android is the new Windows. </s>
