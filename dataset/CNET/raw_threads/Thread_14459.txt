THE LATEST IS TO SELECT THE FLOPY, CLICK &quot;PROPERTIES&quot; AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE I SEE THREE BOXES AS FOLLOWS; 'READ ONLY' - &quot;HIDDEN&quot; AND &quot; ARCHIVES&quot;. USUALY THE READ ONLY IS CHECK, SO I CLEAR THAT AND TRY THE OTHER TWO ATTRIBUTES OR NONE . AN &quot;APPLY&quot; BOX APPEARS AND I CHECK THAT, BUT NOTHING CHANGES. DO YOU KNOW HOW I CAN GET RID OF THE &quot;READ ONLY
