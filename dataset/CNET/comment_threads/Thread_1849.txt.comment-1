I'm a newbie to wireless networking and am looking for some setup and equipment advice.
I currently have a desktop PC, with a wired cable internet connection.
I also have a Mac laptop, equipped with a wireless Airport card.
Is there a wireless router I could purchase that would let me keep the wired connection with my PC (since it is not equipped with a wireless card) but allow my laptop to access the internet connection wirelessly?
Would the router be compatable with my current ISP?
If so, any recommendation on specific brands/models?
I just need the basics, so something relatively inexpensive would be ideal.
Thanks in advance, Adam
