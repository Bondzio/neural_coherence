<s> i bought a linksys type n router a few years ago and thought i'd try to hook it up again now (i couldn't get it to work then either). </s>
<s> there seems to be a compatibility issue between the router box and my wired verizon dsl modem, but it may be with my windows 7 laptop. </s>
<s> i tried before on my xp desktop with similar results. </s>
<s> does anyone have suggestions that don't involve more money? </s>
<s> linksys wouldn't help without a fee, even though i've never called them before. </s>
<s> boooo! </s>
<s> Let's see: - Try to hook it up, no details about the cable(s) used - A linksys router, no type mentioned. </s>
<s> - A wired verizon dsl modem, no type mentioned - There &quot;seems&quot; to be a compatibility issue, no details mentioned. </s>
<s> - You tried both on your Windows 7 laptop and on your XP desktop, but you don't tell what you tried. </s>
<s> - You don't even mention if you tried that wired or wireless or both. </s>

<s> There is a compatibility issue with the Verizon firmware, the only way to get around it, if you can, is to contact Verizon(Frontier) and here we go again, good luck with that one. </s>
<s> If anyone can get a straight answer from Verizon, please let me know. </s>
<s> It seems there was a transition a while back with Verizon and Frontier (the internet side) and their system is exteremely proprietary. </s>
<s> Ciscokid16 is NOT the only one having issues trying to use his/her own hardware. </s>
<s> westell adsl2+ modem for verizon dsl linksys dual-band type n router new ethernet cables 2011 dell studio laptop dell 2005 desktop neither computer will work. </s>
<s> on the connection drawing on them, it shows a red x between either the computer and the modem, or the computer and the router. </s>
<s> i've followed the directions on the linksys disk every time. </s>
<s> i don't know what else to say. </s>
<s> sorry. </s>
<s> Is not the Westell unit a DSL gateway? </s>
<s> Typically that is what Verizon/Frontier furnishes, at least recently. </s>
<s> It is a combination unit wireless capable, modem/router in one unit, which would preclude the use of another router for general purposes. </s>
<s> Whereas if you were to use your Linksys unit you would use a separate modem. </s>
<s> The problem is DSL, your Linksys router is set up for use with a cable modem, which is a different ball game. </s>
<s> That is I guess you could say, a &quot;GOTCHA&quot; with Verizon/Frontier DSL hook ups since they are fed by a phone link instead of cable. </s>
<s> Is there a work around? </s>
<s> Well that's the question for Verizon/Frontier, I would love to hear their answer to this one. </s>
<s> It goes to firmware and of course hook up(s). </s>
<s> What I meant to say is that your Linksys router is used generally with a cable modem, tapped off to the router via ethernet but not with a phone link as is the hook up for DSL. </s>
