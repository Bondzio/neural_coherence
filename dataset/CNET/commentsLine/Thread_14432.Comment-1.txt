sorry to repeat this issue, but have read through previous discussions, and am still unclear what to buy and do.
i am square one...except i got a new laptop.
i have a pc at home connected to a comcast cable modem.
house is @3000 square feet i have a new power book g4 i would like to use all over house.
1. any cheap, fast routers that could cover my house for the mac.
2. i would like to leave the pc hardwired and not wireless.
3. how to setup?
