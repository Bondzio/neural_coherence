<s> Hello, I am having problems getting my computer to recognize my digital camera all of a sudden - it worked just fine a few weeks ago. </s>
<s> When I plug my USB mouse into both USB ports, it works fine. </s>
<s> But when I try the same thing with my camera. </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> and Palm Pilot, I don't get a response when I try to synchronize. </s>
<s> The strange thing is my computer does make a .wav sound when I try to sync the Palm, it just never makes a connection. </s>
<s> But it does recognize it. </s>
<s> I don't have any conflicts in my hardware manager and I haven't installed anything new other than the Windows XP updates. </s>
<s> Some background my my system, I'm running Windows XP on a Dell Dimension desktop - 600 meg, 128 megs of RAM. </s>
<s> Any help you can provide is greatly appreciated! </s>

<s> &quot;all of a sudden&quot; Use XP's System Restore if a reboot doesn't clear up such items. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The Palm Pilot is another issue. </s>
<s> It's either related to above, the configuration/version of Hotsync or you have one of the models in which the USB port gets blown out (m500?) </s>
