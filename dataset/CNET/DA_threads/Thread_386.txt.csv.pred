1.1.1	Alright , my computer is a custom built PC from newegg , I will try to give my basic configuration and a synopsis of my problems : Gigabyte DS3 mo/bo 4x 1gb GSkill pc6400 EVGA 8800GTS 320mb vid card Intel e6400 cpu/ Zalman 9700 heatskink ( h/d , soundcard , floppy , peripherals that arent needed - & gt ; all currently removed ) -Currently , when I turn my pc on everything ( fans , lights ) powers up , but there is no video signal .	St
1.1.2	-I tried using a different monitor , no luck .	St
1.1.3	I tried plugging my laptop into my monitor , works fine .	St
1.1.4	-I tried removing every peripheral except ram , cpu , fan , and video card .	St
1.1.5	No luck .	Polite
1.1.6	-I tried using only 1 stick of RAM ( all 4 of them independently ) and no luck .	St
1.1.7	-I tried bringing my pc to a friends house and tried my video card in his system , it works fine on his mo/bo .	St
1.1.8	I tried his video card in my system , but still no signal ( it worked when we put it back in his as well ) -I tried powering my friends pc up with my powersupply , worked fine .	St
1.1.9	-I tried pulling the CPU battery out and leaving it out over night , then putting it back in .	St
1.1.10	No luck .	Polite
1.1.11	-I receive no beeps when powering up .	St
1.1.12	So now I 'm trying to limit my options of what could possibly be going wrong .	St
1.1.13	It seems like either the CPU or mo/bo is the problem from what I 've found so far .	St
1.1.14	Two other things that seem strange : The reset button does not work when powered up ( it used to before I had this video problem ) , and the CPU fan takes about 4 seconds to kick in ( it used to start up before anything else ) .	St
1.1.15	I am really hoping I do n't have to RMA my entire board , but any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated before I take that step .	St
1.2.1	Power supply .	St
1.2.2	Power Supply problems are going around today .	St
1.2.3	I ca n't help you further .	St
1.2.4	Be patient someone well come along shortly .	St
1.2.5	One last suggestion how 's the connection ?	Ques
1.2.6	Every thing plugged in OK ?	Ques
1.2.7	I know you 've been thorough but check again .	St
1.3.1	I should add the power supply is a XION PowerReal XON-600F14T-201 ATX12V 600W I can add the exact specs of my system if it might help .	St
