that's how you'd set it up.
if it's working it should be able to give you an ip address and you'd see the router as a gateway when you run &quot;ipconfig&quot;.
knowing that gateway, you'd use a browser to enter the web interface and configure the router.
it's possible that you might need to reset it to defaults first.
you'd need to find a manual to let you know how to do that.
if you don't have one, check d-link's support site.
good luck.
