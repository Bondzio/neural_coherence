hello, i've never posted here before, but i'm hoping for some help.
i'm looking at getting a netbook for travel purposes, and just to not have to boot up my bulky 5yr old toshiba laptop all the time.
i just want to be able to do quick emails/basic web stuff on the road, and the big thing is i want to be able to do skype video calls.
so, my question is, what netbook do you recommend/not recommend for this?
i want a built-in webcam, too.
there's a special on an e-machines brand right now i was thinking about.
suggestions?
