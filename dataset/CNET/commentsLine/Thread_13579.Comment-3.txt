promedia 2.1 and it's served me well for quite some time.
i don't game but i do enjoy music at reasonable quality.
it's really a matter of adjusting the bass to the right level as any sub-woofer can get muddy sounding.
my main home speaker system is still a pair of old jbl l65s ( a studio monitor series) that spoils me but the klipsch are nice on my pc.
i don't need or want more than 2.1. good luck in your search but it's your ears that should do the judging.
