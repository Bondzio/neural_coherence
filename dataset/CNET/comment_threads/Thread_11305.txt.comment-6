Thank you this is just what I wanted to know.
Sounds like I should put the two 150s in raid 0 and use the 500 for the os and media files like music.
Just have to remember to make a back up every week or so.
This will be a hardware RAID.
I am building a new game computer and have been looking up alot of things that iv never tryed before.
My next questions will be on overclocking.
I dont know enofe about it to have a question yet.
maybe soon.
Thank you very much for your reply.
It helped alot.
