the year is 1986 my first computer mmm forgot its name... something z80 then to the comodore8 or was it 16 nightmare stuff, then the amiga 500 and finally the xt with a 10mb hard disk.
computers have come a long way, so have i, at the age of mid thirties, i cried when i first had to use an windows environment to type a letter... think i knew something... of the trials and tribulations of windows... save us from bad microsoft programming.
i had left the country town of griffith to the big city of sydney to learn about computers i could see they were the future way... i wanted to become a programmer, but soon learned my maths was sorely learned and a major handicap to becoming a good programmer so decided to paint instead, and set up an online gallery at  have fun jenny
