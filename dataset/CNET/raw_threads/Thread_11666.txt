One problem: i dont have the said keys as i have never had the roxio software that supposedly causes xp to restart rather than shutdown. if anyone has any idea how to fix this i would appreciate it. I have taken it to a techie already and he was unable to help me saying it was a microsoft software issue. so i went home and checked the site with no luck. Thanks. (and i'll keep checking the site) Loren

Here's what you'll have to note. There is no &quot;do this&quot; to cure your issue. As to the ROXIO software, you may be unaware that WMP (Windows Media Player) can install a piece of that for you without you knowing. To pass up a fix because you haven't installed Roxio may have left a fix untried. Ooops, that's the magic word. You have to &quot;try&quot; each fix. Bob
