I need a wireless bridge because I have a few network appliances that cannot use wireless in that fashion(like a wired network camera).
I have four or five wireless routers (all are configurable as access points, also), plus one regular access point.
Also, I have a few wired routers and a few switches/hubs.
Just no bridge.
Also, I do not want to use a wireless-equipped computer as my bridge, which I have heard of.
Mainly, I just want to use a wired network camera with as little equipment as possible (camera, hub, bridge) to watch over my baby's room.
