1.1.1	I would like to set up a Wireless B network in my home, not for my laptop, but for my Palm TX.	St
1.1.2	The reason is for the Palm TX has wifi, but can only connect to 802.11 Wireless B Networks, so I am currently out of luck.	St
1.1.3	I have an 802.11 Wireless G network, but that is after B came out.	St
1.1.4	I want a B router and range expander to cover my whole house.	St
1.1.5	Please help.	St
1.1.6	What are the right products for an 802.11 wireless b network with a router and range expander?	St
1.2.1	most 802.11g are downward compatible with 802.11b already.	St
