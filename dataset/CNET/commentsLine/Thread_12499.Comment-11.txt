i have a fully functional atari 800, it runs as well as it did for the first 5 years of its existence.
i start it up every year or so to plop in an old cartridge and marvel at some of the old games which were less mind intensive.
the only real reason for a new one, imho, is if you want to keep up with the latest graphically orientated software which usually only requires a better gpu but that the gpu you want is not compatible with your motherboard and the powersupply is insufficient anyway.
at that point, you have to decide whether the cost of this sort of upgrade is worth it on your current computer.
its the graphics chip that rules the roost.
the new bells and whistle upgrades to most of the old tried and perfectly function software which were not originally graphics intensive, have become so.
and there are the games... i read somewhere that the lifespan of a harddrive averages about 10 years.
get an external one, make it your primary.
most of them will probably be bigger than that which came with your original purchase.
who knows how long it can last if its not expected to be a game console.
