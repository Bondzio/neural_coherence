Can I use this modem for dialup or do I need broadband to use this modem on. Thanks to all who answer this query. Kindest Regards Tony B.

You need a &quot;dail-up&quot; modem and internal types cost in the under $20 range, maybe even $10 for a real cheap one. A freebie if brought at OfficeMax as a rebate $0 deal. good luck -----Willy
