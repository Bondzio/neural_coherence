<s> I have a Thinkpad T22 running W2k with all the updates and hotfixes installed. </s>
<s> I am having issues with a Linksys WPC54G wireless adapter. </s>
<s> When starting the laptop with the adapter software installed, I get this error when the wireless monitor and wireless connection are enabled: External exception E06D7363. </s>
<s> I also get a runtime error on WPC54Cfg.exe file saying abnormal program termination. </s>
<s> I can eliminate this by removing the configuration utility from the Startup menu. </s>
<s> I think there is a software conflict somewhere, but have no idea where. </s>
<s> I can get it to work after I exit the wireless monitor providing I don't have any security enabled. </s>
<s> I am using a Linksys WRT54G wireless router. </s>
<s> The other wireless computer on the network (a Dell tower running XP Professional using a USB wireless adapter) works fine. </s>
<s> It's clear the drivers and apps are defective so either look for new ones at linksys or try another adapter. </s>
