...doesn't require a modern 20pin + 4pin power supply.
With one of these older boards you simply plug in the normal 20pin plug and shove the the 4 pin plug out of the way, and forget about it for years!
There is of course a method to test your PSU (and it's the best way to test a water cooled rig safely for leaks too) safely, but first unplug all devices such as motherboard, drives, CD-rom etc.
Then go to this URL : http://modtown.co.uk/mt/article2.php?id=psumod Be VERY carefull, and double check which two pins you are connecting, BEFORE powering up the PSU!!!!
We await results... Good luck, GeeBee.
