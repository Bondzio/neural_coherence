in my motherboard manual it says pc1600 ddr ram but my local computer store only sells pc133 ddr ram or pc 400 ddr (think that is right) ram.
motherboard in question is an msi kt2 combo.
has 2 ddr and 2 sd ram slots.
they constantly say they can't supply pc1600 ram and i am wondering what the actual differences are?
i was wondering if it is really worth the effort to hunt down the exact type of memory listed in my user manual.
