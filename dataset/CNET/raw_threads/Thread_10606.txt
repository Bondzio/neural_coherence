Power off, remove AC, the battery, press hold the power button for 60 seconds, release, slip in the battery, apply AC and try again. Bob

I believe the user needs to hit F1 or F10(depends on bios level), or some key(instructions on website) then follow repairs. If a recent bios update or system upgrade and/or power status change, it could generate your problem. tada -----Willy

Go get the service manual and power off, remove ac and battery (that's in the service manual) then remove the hard drive. At this point, if it's the usual failed HDD the boot from USB and CD should work. Bob

Better have that repaired. If you install from a non-original copy, there's a good chance something is wrong with the copy. In that case, contact HP and order that recovery disk. Kees

Maybe the shop where you bought this machine help you to find something that works. There might be a recovery partition on the hard disk. If no help from the shop or the local tech, see if http://www.google.com/search?q=&quot;Sources\install.wim&quot; leads to a solution. If not, better buy an original DVD. be sure you have or can download from hp.com all needed drivers for the OS you choose. That might be difficult. Kees

5206	14	531476	5155735	5155577	Willy	6/27/11 10:00 AM	1.3091688E12	Recovery disc	HP offers from their support website to order the recovery/restore disc(s). They are for a small cost though but definitively cheaper than anything else and made for your PC. Just goto the HP website, find support, enter your model# and check for the ordering hyperlink. Provided they still have Vista available, its worth the wait. As for any recovery via the WWW source, they usually is only for minor recovery possibilities. Its a generic source of recovery so it won;t be capable to fix either true h/w faults or anything other than the basic Vista OS footprint. I would also do this from disc rather than a flash drive if I assume you got the .ISO file. good luck tada -----Willy
