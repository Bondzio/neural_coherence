since the drive is defective it is possible to freeze the drive for several hours in a freezer.
then install into your compuuter and format the drive this should destroy the data.. also you might be able to access some data on it before it heats up...for some reason the freeze method has worked.. with sensitive data I would just buy another non WD HD&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
