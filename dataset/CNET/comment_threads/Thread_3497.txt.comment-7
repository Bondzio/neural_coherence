A lot of units come with software that you can set up to do what you're asking (assuming you're XP/Vista) Some of the applications are limited to backing up either only My Documents or the whole disk, whereas others will let you do specific folders.
You can schedule it, or set it to go manually.
Personally I can't stand when a backup comes on while I'm tryin to finish my work.
One example (not a plug, just a product I'm familiar with) is Seagate's One Touch.
You buy the drive and it comes with the program.
