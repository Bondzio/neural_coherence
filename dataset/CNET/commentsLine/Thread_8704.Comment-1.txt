hi, i am looking for an hdtv tuner or someway to watch tv on my computer.
i prefer not to actually buy the service like cable and pay monthly but to rather pick-up some local channels.
here are my comp specs: 2.8ghz p4 1024mb pc3200 geforce ti 4600 qdi sis superb4fx, motherboard.
broadband i know that if i buy a tv tuner card thingie it'll most likely be from either ati or nvidia, i think.
also can a tv tuner card like run with my other card.
i'm not looking for sli or anything just wondering if i can use both at the same time.
thanks in advance ibrhaim jadoon
