Bob, thanks again, I got a little farther and I did have an SP2 version to try, but when it asks for the driver it only wants it from a floppy drive, which on the DP35DP MB, I don't have.
I can install an EIDE drive and load windows on it, then install the 500GB SATA drive and partition etc?
More help would be great.
Thanks Tom
