All we know: the power supply works and the fans and motherboard are powered.
It's up to you to find out what's wrong.
Possibilities include: - bad motherboard, CPU, memory, video card, monitor or cables - wrong or bad connections The least that should happen is the BIOS showing itself on the monitor, indeed.
Hope you find it.
