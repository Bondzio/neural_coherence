Recently I bought a new syste which I asembled myself and after the reboot from installing the video card drivers, the screen remains blank and the monitor loses its signal from the computer. I thinbk that this might be some sort of driver conflict but am not sure. Can anyone offer some advice as how to fix is problem? p.s. i am currently running the defult vga drivers. Thanx, Cameron

I have reflashed BIOS with the latest from ABIT and have upto date DxD.
