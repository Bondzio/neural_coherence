<s> I have just bought an external hard disk (Philips 250GB SPD5110CC) ostensibly for backups. </s>
<s> But I'm wondering if there's any reason I can't use it as a 'main' disk (not for Windows itself, of course). </s>
<s> Any thoughts? </s>
<s> Thanks, Chalkbel. </s>
<s> The drive even on USB 2.0 is 1/2 to less the speed of internal drives and prone to vanishing. </s>
<s> Read http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-7590-0.html?forumID=67&threadID=28919&messageID=328179 It is a fine copy, but fails on too many points for real backup. </s>

<s> Once the ext. </s>
<s> HD is attached, its resources are available. </s>
<s> However continued use in such a matter defeats the purpose of a &quot;back-up HD&quot; since it no longer is as safe as it can be. </s>
<s> You expose it to any malware threat and possibility power problems or any other system problem. </s>
<s> In its simplest terms a back-up HD stores related data to be used later if and when needed. </s>
<s> You can partition the ext. </s>

<s> HD itself. </s>
<s> If you read the threads here, problems crop-up to ext. </s>
<s> attached devices, HDs or not, so its not an invalid caution to safeguard as best as possible. </s>
<s> Of course do what you need to do. </s>

<s> Thanks, Bob & Willy, I think the answer is No! </s>
<s> It's OK - I was just wondering, but that's a clear indication from you both as to the way I should go. </s>
<s> I have plenty of HDD space, so no problem. </s>
<s> Thanks, Chalkbel. </s>
