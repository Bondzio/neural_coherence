<s> Purchased a Usb powered extension some time ago. </s>
<s> Did not try it immediately as I didn't need it. </s>
<s> Finally decided to try it and I get an error message stating &quot;USB device Not Recognized&quot; &quot;One of the USB devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned&quot;. </s>
<s> I have tried the cable on two laptops and two desktops; operating systems ranging from the current Windows 7; Vista and Windows XP. </s>
<s> All with the same results. </s>
<s> Going into device manager on the Xp system; it tells my that there is an &quot;Unknown Device&quot; and that there are no drivers installed for it. </s>
<s> Did extensive research on the web; and every where it says that no drivers are required for a powered USB cable. </s>
<s> Any suggestions or alternatives. </s>
<s> Have had the cable to long to return it; so that is out! </s>
<s> So all I can do is ask if there is a detail available like that. </s>
<s> How long a cable is needed? </s>
<s> It is a 5m standard USB powered cable. </s>
<s> Male connection on one end female on the powered end. </s>
<s> No make or model! </s>
<s> Go get another one. </s>
<s> I too see no drivers and there is nothing in your post that suggests it's your machines. </s>
<s> Me thinks that is what I will have to do. </s>
<s> Just got to figure out what I can do with 15 ft. of usb cable!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> And you would have to be perfect. </s>
<s> I use a 10 foot extension cable and it is just wires. </s>
<s> Well, a good gauge and twisted like the &quot;spec&quot; but it does work EXCEPT for USB HARD DRIVES which we do expect to fail on such things. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Since the cable is powered, PnP is trying to install drivers for the attached device. </s>
<s> What device did you attach that failed to install or did you just leave it open ended? </s>
<s> It fails when it is left open. </s>
<s> I have tried it with a memory stick attached and got the same results. </s>
