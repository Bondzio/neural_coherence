Motherboard MSI K7N420.
I have 3 additional USB slots on my MB.
I have 2 USB ports on front of my case and D-Bracket with 2 USB and 4 LED.
I had the D-Bracket connected, but the USB ports would not function and the 4 LED remained green, always, which is supposed to indicate that the Operating System is Booting.
Whats wrong with the D-Bracket?
How, if possible, can I use all the available USB ports?
