4144	0	270344	2620693	NR	drfugawe	11/2/07 3:44 PM	1.19401824E12	Not able to share printer/files	Dell Dimension 2400 (XP) Host Dell Inspiron 1521 (Vista) Zyxel P-300W router I set this network up last month with the Zyxel CD, and out of the box, the network worked fine. However, I've managed to somehow mess up the system so that now it will not share printer or files - no problem with web connection. Much of my confusion centers on terminology, namely the difference between &quot;network name&quot;, &quot;ssid name&quot;, &quot;local area connection&quot;, and &quot;router name&quot;. Currently, it looks like the same name is being applied to each depending on where you're looking - is this problematic? Frankly, I'm not sure where one sets or changes these names, especially with the two different OS. If I look at &quot;My Network Places&quot; on the host Dell D-2400, all I see is the router and something named, &quot;My Web Sites on MSN? (???) - No mention of any computers or printer. And if I look at &quot;Network and Sharing&quot; on the laptop, the map of my network shows both computers and the router, but no printer. I've done and redone network and wireless setups on both computers multiple times (this may be compounding the problem!), and always must try to make manual settings, since my &quot;host&quot; computer will only allow me to make a network system disk on a floopy, and the laptop has no floopy drive. And when I try to use the XP Install disk, it simply deposits some files on the laptop, and thats it! So I try to do manual setups, but something's not right. I suspect that I've simply changed a setting somewhere, but after 3 days of changing and re-changing everything, I'm at my wits end. I've spent a good deal of time looking at the archives here, but am not finding anything that helps. Thanks for any advice or suggestion on how to resolve this. john

If you were able to see each computer, share files and printers when you first set up the network, then the most likely cause or your initial problems (at that time) would probably be related to an issue with your Internet Security software. Norton, McAfee or other firewall software are famous for blocking the network interaction between computers. Try disabling all Firewall software on both computers. If that works, then you will have to go into and change the settings in each firewall until you find the problem. Unfortunately, since you have been playing with the system you may have created a whole new set of problems. So, in general you need to check all of the following to allow the computers to talk to each other on the network. 1. Each computer must have a uniquely DIFFERENT computer name. 2. Each computer must be assigned to the SAME Workgroup name. 3. Firewall software must be configured correctly. 4. File and Print Sharing must be turned on in the Windows Firewall, if using it. 5. A file, folder and printer must be actually shared (as indicated by a hand under the file or printer name). Dana Wayland Computer

I don't know how to merge the two workgroups or delete one. Although I've tried to add my printer (Canon S750) to my correct workgroup, it won't show here. And when I try to add a &quot;wireless device&quot;, Vista says it can't find any. Under CP/Network and Sharing, it correctly shows the laptop, the correctly named network(private), and the internet. On Network Map, it shows, correct network name, both computers, switch, and internet. No printer here either. I'm also noticing something strange in the laptop's Control Panel/Network Connections - it shows two connections: a Local Area Connection (using Broadcom Integrated Controller) that is X'ed out, and a Wireless Network Connection (using a Dell Wireless WLAN minicard) that is active. I haven't touched these as yet. That's enough for now - I suspect you'll find some issues in all that, at least I hope you do. Thanks, Dana, for helping with this. john

However, only the XP driver was available. So I dl'ed that one and installed on Vista laptop. Do you think that'll cause problems? john

Your answer lies in this post. http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7589_102-0.html?forumID=62&threadID=232132&messageID=2395292#2395292 Udating the drivers for the printer does help, but if you look at how kaufmanmoore gave the instructions on how he solved this problem and everyone else responded to him about how it worked, you'll understand what I'm trying to tell you. Read the post entirely and I think you'll have a better understanding on what is going on. Rick

You never want 2 firewalls or 2 antivirus programs running at the same time so disable 1 firewall. Please Review this document on Print and files sharing with Vista. http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb727037.aspx Network Connections should show 2 types of connections. One is your wireless and the other Local Connection is for a hard wired ethernet connection. The hardware local connection should show that it is disconnected at this point unless you plug your laptop directly into your network. Some people may even disable the local connection if they want.
4144	7	270344	2622432	2621611	drfugawe	11/4/07 9:21 PM	1.19421126E12	Thanks Rick - Almost Home	I read and followed the suggestions of kaufmanmoore - at first I couldn't get the host desktop to create a new local port, but then, being a basically paranoid guy, I uninstalled both instances of Network Magic (came with the Zyxel router)from each machine, and backed up each to a date prior to NM's initial install. Worked like a charm! Now I'd hate to be left thinking that the folks at Network Magic slipped a gremlin into their software that causes newbies like me to think nothing will work except buying that expensive solution, but, ... I do anyway. Only problem left is I'm still getting a message each time the laptop prints that says the printer driver needs updating - However, I did dl the new needed driver, but since there is no actual printer to install in the laptop, I had to manually install the driver, and it installed into the same folder in dl'ed into. I suspect that's incorrect. Any final suggestion on how I can get it into a better location? Thanks Rick - I appreciate your invaluable assistance. john
4144	8	270344	2622491	2622432	PudgyOne	11/5/07 1:55 AM	1.1942277E12	Like I said	this is really a Vista glitch. Most drivers are in the system32 folder. c://windows/system32 Printer drivers need to be installed in each computer. My home printer setup is Dell wireless printer adapter 3300 plugged into my Dell Photo AIO Printer 964. I installed the printer drivers in all three laptops(Windows XP). I do NOT have to leave a host computer on to print. Daughter can print from her room, son can also, aand I can print from the back patio, when it's nice out. We use a Netgear router that has the firmware updated Broadcast SSID Use WPA security(WEP can be hacked) Use nothing else. Never loose a connection and we can always print, scan, copy or fax when we want to. Rick
4144	9	270344	2624211	2622491	drfugawe	11/7/07 9:12 AM	1.19442672E12	Many Thanks, Rick	All is well - I can print from the laptop, and share files from the host computer as well. But there are two remaining nags, both of which are not killers, but I'd like to solve them anyway. Each time I print from the laptop, I get a popup message that says there is something wrong with the print monitor, and it suggests that printer drivers be installed at all locations in the network (just as you said). But I have done that, as best as I know how - I dl'ed the only available drivers from the Canon site (a Win XP driver, and a Vista patch), manually installed them (god only knows where they installed - no indication of where during the process) and it ends by telling me that they were successfully installed. But, ... ???? However, as I'm getting that pop-up message, the printing process is going on sucessfully! The other nag is that if I go into &quot;Network and Sharing Center&quot; on the laptop (Vista), under &quot;Sharing and Discovery&quot;, it says, &quot;There are no printers attached to this computer&quot;. Is that OK? Seems to me it should be telling me if there is a printer attached to this network, right? And there is a printer on the network. But, as I said, I can live with both of these, but of course, I'd like them both to be correct. Thanks again,Rick, for all your help. john

I don't have Vista so you may be able to find the answer wating for someone to post or you may want to post the question in the Windows Vista forum . If you have to, post the url for this post and maybe this will also help someone steer you in the right direction. Rick
