<s> You can purchase wireless-G network adapters that are compatible with USB 2.0 and USB 1.1. </s>
<s> The Linksys wireless-G USB network adapters are compatible with USB 2.0 and 1.1 (go to Linksys.com and look at the ''Data Sheet'' for the individual USB wireless-g network adapter). </s>
<s> It is my experience that USB wireless network adapters perform equal to or better than PCMCIA network adapters. </s>
<s> Theoretical max speeds: USB 1.1 = 12Mbps USB 2.0 = 480Mbps Wireless-g = 54Mbps Typical home Internet = less than 10Mbps You can see that the drawback of using wireless-g on a USB 1.1 port is that it will limit your connection speed to the local network (12Mbps &lt; 54Mbps), but not your Internet speeds (12Mbps &gt; 10Mbps). </s>
<s> I recommend purchasing a wireless network adapter that is the same brand as the router to ensure maximum compatibility and one-stop customer support. </s>
<s> If you desire to have USB 2.0 ports in your computer, you can purchase a PCMCIA card with USB 2.0 ports. </s>
<s> Presently, there are 12 such cards listed on NewEgg.com . </s>
<s> You can find them online and at at local computer stores, electronics stores, and office supply stores. </s>
