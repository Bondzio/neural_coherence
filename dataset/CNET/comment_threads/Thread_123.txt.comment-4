Thanks S and Bob.
Apparently S didn't read about my ignorance as to the &quot;bios&quot;.
I don't even know what that is, much less how to check if my motherboard can handle this.
Can you guys help me there?
How would I check to find out if it can support the new 80G?
Good point on checking for a slot for the new drive, S.
Duh...I just assumed it would fit.
I swear, sometimes I feel like an idiot.
I just assumed there would be room in there...it's a big tower...lol.
