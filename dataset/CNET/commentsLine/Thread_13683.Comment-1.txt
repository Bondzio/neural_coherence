hi guys i have a d-link dir-615 and 4 pcs in my house, now since my house is 3 floors im not going to wire all of them to the internet.
so i set up a simple network at first securing my network with wpa2 and it worked fine then my dad wanted to put mac filtering on so i set it up and all my computers connect and can use the internet including my laptop, but at random times my laptop can connect to the network but can't access the internet.
when i restart the wireless adapter it will eventually get back online, but can anyone tell me whats wrong?
how come i can't go online sometimes?
my laptop is a hp dv6000 im running windows 7 32-bit.
