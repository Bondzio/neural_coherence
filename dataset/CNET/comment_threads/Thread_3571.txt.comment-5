Thanks so much, I did as you say, I disabled DCHP on the DLink and is now hooked into one of the 4 ports of the Cellpipe into one of the 4 ports of the Dlink.
It seems to be working fine now - all my computers have switched over to the new subnet of 192.168.2.XX However, I can get access to the original DLink router setup page (presumably left at 192.168.0.1) - how do I get access back into the original DLink router?
It doesn't show up in my Cellpipe device table - what's its setup page?
I tried just connecting one computer to the DLink by itself to see if I can re-set the setup page to something in the 192.168.2.XX range, but the old 192.168.0.1 setup page isn't responding - is it because I disabled DCHP on the DLink that it won't accept new connections?
Currently everything is working and my old Wifi settings from the DLink still seems to be working, but I would like access to the setup page in case I need to change a Wifi setting sometime in the future.
Thanks
