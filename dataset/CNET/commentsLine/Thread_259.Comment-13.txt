i'm not sophisticated enuf to know what you mean by ``history of packet writing software or install and incorrect uninstall of burning software and upper and lower filters that came into the registry somehow.''
`` if you tell more, somebody might be able to help.''
what more do you need?
last sunday i tried to drag and drop some photos from my husband's golf trip from my hard drive to a new cd-r to give to a friend of his.
i have two cd/dvd drives.
when i tried to copy them to the top drive, it told me to put a disc in the drive.
it already was in the drive.
i put a prerecorded dvd in the same drive, but the drive didn't see it either.
neither did the bottom drive, although sometimes i can copy the pictures to a blank disc in that drive.
