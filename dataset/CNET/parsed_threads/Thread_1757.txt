<s> I have set up a home network which includes a desktop computer that is connected to a wireless router in my downstairs home office. </s>
<s> I primarily use a MacBook throughout the rest of the house and now would like to set up printers. </s>
<s> I have two printers that I would like to connect to this network and I'm not sure how or even if its possible to set it up how I would like to. </s>
<s> I would like to keep one printer (b/w Canon) in the home office and place the other printer (color Canon) on another floor, to be the primary use printer. </s>
<s> I would like to be allow both computers to access either printer depending on whether the job requires b/w or color printing without having to go up & down for access to the printers. </s>
<s> I bought a Netgear wireless print server but am wondering if I should return it since the diagram/instructions call for both printers to connect via USB to the server. </s>
<s> Can someone tell me if its possible to set up my home wireless network this way and if so, what is the proper equipment needed? </s>
<s> The desktop is a Dell, running on XP, the modem is a Verizon issues Westell, the Router is a Linksys. </s>
<s> The desktop PC uses a USB hub to connect it to the b/w Canon printer as well as a Scanner and an external hard drive. </s>
<s> I'm hoping that being a little more specific about what kind of equipment I already have helps you help me?! </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Also, since I primarily use the MacBook (which is brand new), would an Airport base work better to solve the printer connection problem? </s>
