hey guys, i've got a problem with my pc.
it seems that my pc does not boot and gives me a black screen.
i've tried cleaning it, unplugging all of my hardwares, testing my hard drives and nothing works.
the pc turns on but all it gives me is a blank screen.
is it my processor, ram, cmos battery?
anyone know what the problem is?
i'd appreciate your advices.
thx
