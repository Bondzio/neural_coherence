Hi I've just taken delivery today of a Fujitsu Siemens Amilo D1845 laptop with a Conexant PRISM 802.11g (3886) network adapter. OS is XP Home. Am able to connect to open network in my building but cannot get IE or Outlook Express to connect - error messages inc &quot;Cannot find server&quot;. Signal strength is generally good and have Internet options configured to &quot;Automatically detect settings&quot;. It is not running through a client at all, Windows is controlling the Wireless Network settings. A friend could connect with their HP laptop running an Intel PRO 2200BG wireless card no problem. What might I be doing wrong? All suggestions greatly appreciated!

The internet works fine now. Before, it worked like a really sick dial-up connection. I use D-Link Wireless router. I also found this on the web: http://www.cableforum.co.uk/board/archive/index.php/t-21444.html
