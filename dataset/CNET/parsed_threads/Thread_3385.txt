<s> Someone is using my wlan after having cracked its WEP code. </s>
<s> Is there anyway to track that person down? </s>

<s> They are in so many feet of your router. </s>
<s> Try this. </s>
<s> Enable MAC filtering, change the WEP key and disable management over the WIFI link. </s>
<s> Also, turn off the wifi or router when you don't need it. </s>
<s> That alone will send them away since they won't know if they can get on or when. </s>

<s> I have tried them all, not practically effective. </s>
<s> I know that when a person access my net, he is transmitting. </s>
<s> I am thinking of some equipment which can indicate the direction and the distance the transmission is coming from. </s>
<s> This would help to narrow down the possible culprits. </s>
<s> What would be the cheapest equipment which can do this? </s>
<s> wl </s>
<s> Why isn't turning off the WIFI effective? </s>
<s> More important than tracking the intruder, is to stop the intruder from continuing to access your network. </s>
<s> The first thing you need to do is dump WEP. </s>
<s> WEP is hiddeously insecure and can be, and (as you found out) frequently is, trivially hacked. </s>
<s> In fact, the FBI did it in 3 minutes using Kismet, Airodump, Airplay, and Aircrack. </s>
<s> The proccess is not very complicated, and the above listed tools are readily available. </s>
<s> You really need to move to WPA2 if your equiptment will support it, or at least WPA, with a randomly generated sufficient complex passphrase. </s>
<s> Now the bad news, WPA/WPA2 has a vulnerability as well. </s>
<s> You do not want to use a short passphrase consisting of a word found in the dictionary. </s>
<s> This will leave you vulnerable to an offline dictionary attack (A type of brute force attack where words found in the dictionary are thrown against a passprase to recover the passphrase) by someone using KisMac or coWPAtty. </s>
<s> (Two popular wireless hacking tools that are also freely available) You will want to use a randomly generated complex passphrase consisting of at least 34 characters. </s>
<s> Most publications say 20 characters, but you get about 2.5n bits of security per character +12 bits (2.5n+12 total) in a passphrase. </s>
<s> So, this would only give you 62 bits of equivelent security. </s>
<s> Bare minimum you want want 96 bits of security, so 34 characters will give you a total 97 bits. </s>
<s> Ideally, you will want to use a 64 digit hexadecimal. </s>
<s> This will give you a full 256 bits of security, plus using a 64 digit hex avoids the hashing process used to create the 256 bit Pairwise Master Key, because the hex is used directly as the key. </s>
<s> It is this hashing process (Specifically, the MIC hash value)that leaves WPA/WPA2 vulnerable to a dictionary attack when short dictionary words are used as the passphrase. </s>
<s> Now the good news. </s>
<s> The brute force dictionary attack is the only known effective attack against WPA/WPA2. </s>
<s> if you use a 64 digit hex you will make your network reasonably secure against any sort of brute force attack in that each of the 2^256 possibilities must be tried since your passphrase can not be found in a dictionary. </s>
<s> This is a huge number 1.1579208923731619542357098500 869x10^77 or in decimal format: 1,157,920,892,373,161,954,235,709,850,086,900,000,000,00 0,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 Now the really good news. </s>
<s> To check each of the 2^256 possibilities, you would have to have a device that could crack a billion billion keys per second and it would still take you 3.671x10^51 years to check every possibility. </s>
<s> (3,671,743,063,080,802,746,815,416,825,491,118,336,290,905,145,409,708 years) As you can plainly see this is significantly longer than the 3 minutes it took the FBI to hack WEP. </s>
<s> Now the best news of all. </s>
<s> The DES cracker Deep Crack (something your local wardriver is not likely to have) could only do 90 billion keys a second,and would take 4.0769221021355023274397357709461x10^58 years to exhaust all the possibilities. </s>
<s> Newer devices can do 256 billion keys a second These computing Goliaths (something your local wardriver is even less likely to have) would still take 1.4332929265320125369905321069732x10^58 years to exhaust the possibilities. </s>
<s> The two most popular tools, KisMac and coWPAtty (something your local wardriver IS likely to have) can do 100 and 60 keys per second respectively. </s>
<s> Now, this can actually be subtantially increased to around 76,000 keys a second using precomputed hashes and very large dictionary files (again, readily available). </s>
<s> But, 76,000 still falls way short of even the DES cracker, and precomputed hashes in a dictionary attack are of no use if your SSID hash is not in the hash file, and your password is not in the dictionary file. </s>
<s> But, for the sake of argument it would still take 4.8279340683183580193365292024362x10^64 years to run through all the possibilities. </s>
<s> In reality at 100 possibilities per second it would take 3.6692298919219520946957621938515x10^67 years to exhaust the possibilities. </s>
<s> So as you can see if you use a sufficiently complex and random passphrase, you can have a fairly secure network. </s>
<s> if you use something like: toast Thats exactly what you will be, and it will take anywere from 0.2 seconds to around 5 minutes to hack your network. </s>
<s> However, if you use something like: DE9350EB9F96D947A962E5C9D71A6F5FC3DE5D006BF1340400050D30354AF49F (a 64 digit hex) Your would be hacker is going to be busy for quite some time trying to hack your network. </s>
<s> If you don't have the means to generate these sort of passowrds, you can go to: https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm You'll want to get this on a computer that is wired to your network. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> P.S. </s>
<s> if your equiptment does not support using a 64 digit hex, you can still use 63 character randomly generated passphrase like: &gt;66X&gt;XC'kidz^7{u(,v}*C&-X\[|hl}? </s>
<s> @O&gt;Kc6w6&gt;goGNB**wO&quot;&quot;,0ADq]x*yUg or 1ZuyAQP3yaqsoyJgBRu0XWidkTm2nWZj6iZVLcArL0C4zeKGyneEC7ZqmKRsyZ6 But be aware that this will only provide 169.5 bits of equivelent security. </s>
<s> So, this leaves only 1.0582402237152498756263674716231x10^51 possibilities to check. </s>
<s> At a billion billion keys per second, it will take your hacker only 33,533,609,137,426,479,695,108,863.5 (3.35336091374264796951088635x10^24 years to crack your passphrase by brute force. </s>
<s> By the way, the age of the universe is believed to be 15 billion years 1.5x10^10. </s>
<s> So as you can see, it is possible to keep intruders at bay with a reasonable amount of effort. </s>
<s> There is no such thing as bullet proof. </s>
<s> Remeber, it used to be computationally infeasable to brute force DES, and now it can be done in hours. </s>
<s> What is impossible today may be child's play tomorrow. </s>
<s> But for now, use randomly generated complex passphrase (64 bit Hex or 63 character ASCII) with WPA/WPA2,and your would be hacker is probably only going to waste only so much time on your network, and go in search of a softer mark. </s>
<s> thks for all the info. </s>
<s> i agree with your suggestion. </s>
