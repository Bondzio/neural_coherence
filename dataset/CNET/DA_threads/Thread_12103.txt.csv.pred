1.1.2	No icons of any kind.	St
1.1.3	I have tried to pull things up with the keyboard but that doesn't work either.	St
1.1.4	I have swaped around three different monitors and they all do the same thing.	St
1.1.5	Any ideas what it might be?	St
1.2.1	The OS had become damaged and was no longer booting fully.	St
1.2.2	Repair methods vary on what OS, what CDs we have and what options we have due to no backups, missing CDs, etc.	St
