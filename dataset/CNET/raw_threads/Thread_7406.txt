If not, then visit your support website to finbd out via the specs page what that ranm requirement is. You gave no mention of the system but quoted this and that of the ram needed, but since no refernce to system, only guess will be a response. Offhand, manufactors of systems will always be more expensive but you get extactly what you need. Check with www.crucial.com or www.kingston.com for possible ram prices for your system. Generic, is always cheaper but there's the offchance it may fail as they're not as tolerant of extremes of system demands and basically are at times, 2nd rate ram, so check carefully for any return policy. good luck -----Willy

In terms of help and guidance it is the best and easiest I have seen. And they have an interactive live help as well. It explains everything from Ram to CLx to ECC, you name it. In search mode you just type in the exact model of your Pc and it pinpoints the right Ram, albeit their product, but do you blame them. In any case their memory is well known and trusted widely.

Go to www.crucial.com to fin out what memeory is needed for your motherboard. They have some of the best quality memory available today. I do NOT recommend &quot;generic&quot; memory, as thy are usually POORLY built and you will waste money. Go with Crucial/Micron to be SURE. They GUARANTEE that the memory they suggest will work for your motherboard, and if it fails at ANYTIME, they'll replace it for FREE.
