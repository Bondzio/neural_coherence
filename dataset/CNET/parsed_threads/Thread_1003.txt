<s> I have a 250GB external hard drive which I use as backup and storage for the concerts I download with Bittorrent. </s>
<s> My drive is very quickly getting full, and I plan on upgrading to at least 750GB, but in the meantime, I'm trying to make some space for more shows. </s>
<s> I'm not very familiar with compressing files, so I'm wondering if it would be okay to zip these files to save space? </s>
<s> Is it a good idea? </s>
<s> Is there a better way to do this? </s>
<s> They're all FLAC or SHN files, so maintaining the quality is the most important factor. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>
