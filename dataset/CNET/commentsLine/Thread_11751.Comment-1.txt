purchased an identical hdd for my toshiba 6100 laptop.
with an ide cable adapter i will install it into my desktop as a slave.
with the use of norton ghost or other mirror software i hope to mirror and back up daily my laptop hdd onto the desktop slave hdd over my network.
the reason for identical drives is so i can swap it into my laptop in the`event the current hdd craps out (calling this toshiba hdd crap is being kind, i am on my third unit in two years!)
my main concern is will i be able to boot from it like nothing even happen.
i dont want to deal with recoveries or reload my os i just want to plug it in and go.
i spoke with the norton people but i get the feeling there not sure.
thanks!
