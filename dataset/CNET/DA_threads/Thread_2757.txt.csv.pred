1.1.1	I have a Netgear router which also acts as the DHCP server.	St
1.1.2	Within the configuration, the IP address range is set to be 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.9.	St
1.1.3	Until recently, there were 3 devices on the network with the router, and their IP addresses are all within that range.	St
1.1.4	A netbook added recently has IP address of 192.168.1.130, and ironically, this netbook cannot communicate with other devices on the network, yet it surfs internet okay.	St
1.1.5	I am blaming the problem with netbook being excluded from the network to its IP address, but I can't quite figure out how it has its IP address set outside the range by the router.	St
1.1.6	Any idea?	St
1.2.1	All devices within the range 192.168.1.xxx can share the LAN.	St
1.2.2	Have you made sure the netbook is in the same work group?	St
1.2.3	Have you run the Network Setup Wizard on the netbook?	St
1.2.4	Have you turned on File and Printer Sharing on the netbook?	St
1.2.5	Your router has a default range of 192.168.1 - 192.168.1.255.	St
1.2.6	The default group is 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.199.	St
1.2.7	Anything within that range is accessible.	St
1.2.8	And on a more complicated note, you can change the entire range to almost anything.	St
1.2.9	A friend changed his range to 10.10.10.1 - 10.10.10.20.	St
1.2.10	Be prepared to troubleshoot and pull your hair out.	St
