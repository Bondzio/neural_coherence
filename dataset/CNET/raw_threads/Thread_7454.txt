Hello, this is my first thread on the CNET forums. anyway, i plan on buying a netbook pretty soon, which is the asus eee pc 1005 hab, which includes windows XP. i plan on using it for itunes, backup storage, maybe some school work, but i think the main focus is for itunes. can the netbook i mentioned be used without problems? will itunes be limited because of the netbook hardware? i know you cant watch HD or SD video, play iTunes extras and whatnot, but can i use itunes for iPod management, like restoring and downgrading and whatnot? also, just a personal preference, but can you change the color of the XP taskbar from the blue color? :P

I bet the color of the taskbar is covered too. As to Windows XP, no version I know of has such a limitation or needs any work around. Bob
