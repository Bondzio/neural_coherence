1.1.1	I am thinking about building my own PC in the near future ( once I save up enough money ) .	St
1.1.2	I do n't want to be spending a ridiculous amount of money on this computer , but I was wondering if , I want to run PC games on Max settings for example , will this make my PC too expensive ?	Ques
1.1.3	It 's probably a dumb question , but I am a beginner here , and am just interested in building a great PC !	St

1.4.1	Maybe I 'll find someone 's custom build then .	St
