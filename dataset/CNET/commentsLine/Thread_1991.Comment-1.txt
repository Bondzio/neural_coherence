about a week ago, my computer started giving me this error message, so i googled it.
i rebooted it, and immediately went to it again.
i tried going into the bios, and tried cd rom first.
i have a windows xp service pack cd(i forgot to mention i have that version of windows), and tried that.
when i put it in my cd rom drive, it goes in, does nothing, and the door opens up.
so, i put it in the dvd and it spins, but nothing happens.
i have tried f8, f10, and nothing.
there are tons of files, pics, that i really can't lose.
please help.
thank you.
