1.1.1	I have a ASUS mobo which came with onboard NIC .	St
1.1.2	Now this NIC seems to be dead ( no light at the back , ca n't connect to Network , ca n't access internet ) .	St
1.1.3	So I uninstalled it from Device Manager and bought this D-Link DFE-530TX PCI Fast Ethernet Adapter ( rev.C ) .	St
1.1.4	Everything is fine except for this : Each time I start Windows 2000 Pro , it tells me that it has found new hardware and to insert the cd that came with it .	St
1.1.5	I would like this not to appear each time I start Windows .	St
1.1.6	How would I do that ?	Ques
1.1.7	PC particulars : MoBo = ASUSTek P4S533 REV 1.xx Bus Clock = 100 Mhz BIOS = Award Software , Inc .	St
1.1.8	Revision : 1009 09/09/2002 OS = Win 2000 Pro RAM = 768 MB Processor = Pentium 4 2.0 Ghz If you need more info pls ask .	St
1.2.1	Go to your bios select Advance under Integrated Peripherals your network settings should be there and this disabled it .	St
1.2.2	If not , refer to your manual .	St
1.3.1	You can just bring up Device manager , double click the onboard NIC and click on Disable and that will do what you need .	St
1.3.2	If disabling it in the BIOS does n't end this problem that works just as well , you do n't need it disabled in the BIOS to use another network card .	St
