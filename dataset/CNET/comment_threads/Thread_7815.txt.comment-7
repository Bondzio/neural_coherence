...and will study it intensely.
Of course, the driver & manual floppy that came with the eBay-purchased SCSI adapter (Adaptec 2940) does not work w/ NT, so I will prepare the necessary driver CD.
For Disaster Recovery, I have imaged the drive to multiple CD's using Norton Ghost.
I will also burn all important files to CD before attempting installing anything, PLUS imaging the entire drive to my PC's HDD using Drive Image.
Is that safe enough?
If the server takes a dump it will only hasten the upgrade, we've been trying to avoid spending a jillion dollars on new software & a new server when this server actually performs quite well for what we need, right now my crisis is not being able to get a daily backup.
Thanks for your advice.
I will post later with an update.
