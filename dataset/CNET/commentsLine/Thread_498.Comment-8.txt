earmonivergh; hi thank you for the reply.
i think that you may at some point in time want to try a better printer.
i have had two epson printers epson stylus c42 and now epson stylus c65.
the life of the c42 expired and the c65 although i got some problems installing the same, it works really good.
the reproduction is fantastic.
i am happy with it, although i need to have a printer that would give me 18 b/w's per minute and 15 colour per minute.
having said this, you will not doubt understand that i will be going for an epson.
you will get quality for your money.
i have tried hp and canon.
none compares.
visit epson website.
standeb.
