<s> The difference is their voltage (T3312 - 2.6v, SuperRam - 2.5v), CAS Latency (T3312 - 3, Superram - 2-2-2-5 / 2.5-3-3-7), and type (T3312 - 184-pin DIMM, SuperRam - 184-pin DDR SDRAM) &lt;I am not sure about the last part&gt; Can I install the SuperRam into this computer? </s>

<s> Thank you for directing me to this website. </s>
<s> I guess the question I am asking is can you mix RAM with different voltage, CAS Latency, and if DIMM and DDR SD-Ram can work together. </s>
<s> comes to RAM...I do all possible not to mix brands, speeds, timing or voltages ...I prefer to eliminate as many of the problem possibilities or incompatibilities as I can. </s>

<s> I strongly recommend getting the max you need when you originally buy the system thus avoiding the upgrade and the potential mismatch conundrum. </s>
