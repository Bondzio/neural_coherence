<s> Hi, I live in an old house, and I do not know how current the wiring is. </s>
<s> The outlets are all three prong grounded. </s>
<s> What I would appreciate knowing is, what should/can I do to protect my computer? </s>
<s> I am already using a Dynex battery backup/uninterupted power supply. </s>
<s> The outlets on the UPS that I am plugged into are marked &quot;surge/battery.&quot; There are three additional ones for &quot;surge&quot; only. </s>
<s> Will this setup be sufficient, or do I need something else? </s>
<s> Thank you, </s>
<s> Your setup is the most basic for your needs. </s>
<s> I suggest you get at least a singular AC plug type surge protector for that UPS to plug into for yet another simple level of protection. </s>
<s> The Dynex brand is a cheapie, so don't expect miracles other than simple protection. </s>
<s> You can also have an AC line conditioner to better squelch AC irregualrites on top of the UPS. </s>
<s> If you like and can afford to, have a electrician check the line and if possible, place a elect. </s>

<s> for that computer line(that room). </s>
<s> Further, that the AC line is truly grounded as older homes can be iffy. </s>
<s> Visit the Tripplet and APC websites for details on wants/needs of systm protection. </s>

<s> Thanks Willy, I will checkout the websites that you suggested, and I am glad to know that my setup is basic, and how to improve it. </s>
<s> Thanks again, </s>
<s> I wouldn't assume it's actual 3 prong wired and have someone check into it. </s>
<s> What some did was take an old wiring system and throw 3 prong outlets in which lack the ground. </s>
<s> Best way to tell is if you take an outlet cover off and check for the black, white, and copper ground. </s>
<s> In some old mobile homes they used aluminum for the ground and black\white and came loose eventually. </s>
<s> Of course there are cases where parts of a home have newer wiring and other parts still have the old stuff. </s>
<s> As well, there are cases where the ground isn't grounded and just runs through the walls into oblivion. </s>
<s> If you want to be sure, have a licensed electrician look at it, wiring in a home should be &quot;one&quot; of the first priorities and taken seriously. </s>
<s> Then at least you know what you have. </s>
<s> Some electricians do a cheap or free inspection depending on where you live. </s>

<s> Go to Home Depot or Lowes and buy a three prong ground checker. </s>
<s> It is a bit more than five bucks if I remember correctly. </s>
<s> Use it on every outlet in your house to be safe. </s>
<s> The lights are explained on the device. </s>
<s> It assures you that there is ground, and the wires are correctly connected. </s>
<s> It is also useful for insuring that an outlet has really been turned off if you need to make a repair like fixing a broken outlet. </s>
<s> For switches you need to use the lamp to tell you power is off for fixing a switch. </s>
<s> If you are not sure of your skills DO NOT attempt repairs, get skilled help. </s>
<s> Do you have a breaker box or fuses? </s>
<s> Are all circuits labeled? </s>
<s> It is worth making a list of what outlets and or lights are on every circuit. </s>
<s> duke </s>
<s> Use an outlet checker, as mentioned in another post, to check for a proper ground. </s>
<s> This is for safety. </s>
<s> A bad ground won't bother the computer at all. </s>
<s> A battery-backup is overkill for simple protection. </s>
<s> It's main purpose is to protect against a power outage. </s>
<s> Most batery backups, as far as I know, don't isolate the computer from the power line. </s>
<s> They switch to an isolated supply (the battery) when the outlet loses power. </s>
<s> Otherwise, power from the outlet goes through a filter, then to your computer, just like a surge-protected power strip. </s>
<s> &quot;Surge&quot; and &quot;glitch&quot; are misnomers. </s>
<s> What you really need to wory about are lightening strikes sending very high voltage spikes into your house's wiring. </s>
<s> Most spikes are brief and low-amplitude, and don't get through the computer's power supply. </s>
<s> A lightning strike, however, can punch through the insulation of the power supply and then into the electronics. </s>
<s> A surge protector shorts out this high-voltage before it gets to your computer. </s>
<s> For most people, a 15$, surge-protected power strip is all you need. </s>
<s> It's all I have, and I've never had any problems with a power spike since the early 80s, when an unprotected modem was destroyed by a lightning storm. </s>
