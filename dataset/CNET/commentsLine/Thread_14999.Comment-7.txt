you find the larger tablet can give you more control over where the line ends.
however i find folk struggle over zooming in/out and well, it takes time to master the tools.
my first comment is that the artists i run into don't use the model you noted.
they head up to the cintiq.
but a pad is just that.
i can only guess how long you've been using one.
