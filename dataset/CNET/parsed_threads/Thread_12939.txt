<s> I need help with a small office network. </s>
<s> I currently share an office with another company and want to restrict them from seeing my computers. </s>
<s> I have 3 machines all running XP. </s>
<s> I have a linksys wireless router that all three are connected to. </s>
<s> I have an connection from the internet going to the correct port on the router. </s>
<s> I only want two of the three machines to have internet access but I would like all three machines on the intranet because they all share files. </s>
<s> How can I configure my machines and router to accomplish this task? </s>
<s> I'm assuming this router is yours. </s>
<s> If so, after all your PCs are set up and running wireless, turn off SSID on the router. </s>
<s> Make sure you are running WPA/2 for encryption. </s>
<s> SSID broadcasts its presence to all PCs. </s>
<s> When you turn it off, only PCs that have been identified and logged in will see it. </s>
<s> Yes, this can be overcome by specific software that sniffs out signals. </s>
<s> But hopefully the other business is more professional. </s>
<s> That seems simple enough! </s>
<s> Firstly, yes the wireless router I am using is owned by me. </s>
<s> But the one additional question I have is I do NOT want one particular computer on my network to access the Internet, but I do want it to be able to communicate with other computers and network printers. </s>
<s> How would I do this? </s>
<s> Setup ip's on router? </s>
<s> I'm not certain. </s>
<s> Thanks to anyone who can help. </s>
<s> since all my PCs have full access, I've never done this. </s>
<s> Maybe someone else will chime in. </s>
<s> There is probably a setting in the router. </s>
<s> You might look into the configuration. </s>
<s> It may jump out at you. </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=linksys+router+setup+block+ports finds how to block ports on your common linksys router. </s>
<s> Sorry that I can't offer a STEP BY STEP but what you want to do is two steps. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Use DHCP RESERVATION so that machine always gets a specific IP assigned. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> With that IP noted we use the articles above to block PORT 80 (example) to that one IP entry. </s>
<s> Blam. </s>
<s> No more Web browsing for them. </s>
<s> Now block more ports as needed. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I will give all this a try and let you know. </s>
<s> Thanks everyone! </s>
