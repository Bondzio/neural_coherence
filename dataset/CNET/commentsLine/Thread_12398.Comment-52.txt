i bought the 8560 a few months back (about 2 i think) and i have been so happy.
it takes everything i feed it....80lb cover, vellum, startdream, labels, etc.
everything looks so great too.
i love the raised feel to the ink the most.
it has lost connectivity by ethernet 2x, but i was able to have it serviced quickly enough and was able to use the usb connection until it was repaired (one time they were able to fix the problem over the phone!).
so i recommend this printer for sure
