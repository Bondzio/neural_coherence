<s> I've been researching different tablets for enjoying media/social networking and I was originally only looking to pay 200 for a tablet. </s>
<s> &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;After learning more, I understand that price is definatley a factor in production value, survivabilty, and usability.So now I'm looking for the best that I can &lt;/div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I need something that will last me a while I would appreciate is if it had could fuction as a Calendar, To Do List, Skype, and use Internet. </s>
<s> &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I live in the USA </s>
<s> And it seems the price range has gone up? </s>
<s> http://forums.cnet.com/7723-19686_102-549834/tablet-help/ Why not the last model we mentioned? </s>
<s> Yeah, the price has gone up now that I know a little more. </s>
<s> I haven't actually seen that HP touchpad for 200. </s>
<s> I was thinking of getting that one anyway, but I wanted to check what the best one was in 300-400 price range or does it not really change? </s>
<s> With prices moving faster than usual what is best for the buck moves too fast for me to give any answer. </s>
<s> I would go with the names. </s>
<s> Even if the name is Viewsonic. </s>

<s> Thank you Bob. </s>
<s> Any other opinions? </s>
<s> I'm really just weighing my options with the little money I have. </s>
<s> I want to find out what the best tablets I can find for a higher price and see if it's worth saving more money as opposed to getting something under 200 that may not be as good. </s>

<s> Let me warn you about the lesser tablets. </s>
<s> Some don't have multi-touch, the android market, g sensors, etc. </s>
<s> If you don't get the basics you may be unhappy. </s>

<s> A 160 buck Vizio with all the items but refurb. </s>
<s> REMEMBER what we discussed about &quot;Apps.&quot; </s>
