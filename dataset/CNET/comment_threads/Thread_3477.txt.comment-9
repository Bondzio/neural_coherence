I really like hearing the feedback!!!!
It's greatly appreciated to hear some good opinions!!
So, I was just wondering since you said USED TO WORK, did you really have that many high performance machines at your store.
I mean, the high performance machines coming out now, I believe but could easily be mistaken, are a fairly new thing.
I would think that bb or cc would have sales on all of there stuff around the holiday season.
thanks again in advance!
