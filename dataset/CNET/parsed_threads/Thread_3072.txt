<s> I have recently moved to a new apartment, prior to moving I could run the video game I play primarily at all very high settings and get a static 75FPS. </s>
<s> Now I get 30 or less than that and I'm on low settings. </s>
<s> The conditions of the transport of my PC were as follows: Wedged between back seat on ground, stable, my AC was on full blast and the windows were foggy upon leaving vehicle, was around a 30 minute drive. </s>
<s> Could the moisture of the AC have potentially shorted something? </s>
<s> I've ran CHKDSK, no bad sectors. </s>
<s> Ran prime95 for processor and memtest for RAM. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> I'm very frustrated. </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> You need to take nothing for granted. </s>
<s> I thought that any car A/C will cause damage and if it did just wouldn't work if that severe. </s>
<s> You/re going to have to check it out top to bottom and verify all is well. </s>
<s> Clean it out, reseat components, etc., fan(s) operation and same type of location as before. </s>
<s> Doing all that helps eliminate or resolve your problem. </s>
<s> It's not the same anymore, no matter how you want to view this, you moved it and relocated to different area. </s>
<s> Sorry, no easy, replace or do this or that. </s>
<s> Once all of the above is done, then look at possible damage. </s>
<s> Overall, I don't see that for now. </s>
<s> You may need to do a total teardown and rebuild to best ideal conditions. </s>
<s> FYI, I've seen PCs moved but didn't work at yours. </s>
<s> One case involved that the user sat the PC next to the door for over a week. </s>
<s> Moved and then issues. </s>
<s> Upon teardown, found a mouse had visited the PC and chewed some harness and peed inside(stains) thought the PC booted and all, it never was the same. </s>
<s> Another had roaches move in. </s>
<s> So, don't take things for granted whatever your cause is. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks alot for your input. </s>
<s> This is what I had feared, haha. </s>
<s> I have to do actual physical work nooooooooo. </s>
<s> Haha. </s>
<s> Just kidding. </s>
