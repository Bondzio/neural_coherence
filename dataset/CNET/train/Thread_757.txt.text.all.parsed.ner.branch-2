14819	11	100591	1161823	1161747	john robie	4/29/05 5:19 pm	1.11479514e12	hmmm......	that is your opinion ozos, perhaps from some you have come across in the past, but not the later dell's imo, especially in the 8400 series and xps. even the 4700 series (along with the 8400/xps now all have the pci-express x-16 capabilities instead of no upgrade. the cooling is ok on the 8400 with their bigger case and the ram is now adequate imo. dell will also be coming out with the new intel dual processors as recently reported.
