a work colleague just told me this.
his mother purchased a dell notebook a few months ago and it would not start this morning.
she rang dell cs number and was answered by a person with indian accent.
he was talking fast and hard to understand.
after a few minutes, he told the lady to get a screw driver and open the case and see if we can work things out.
what is dell thinking?
