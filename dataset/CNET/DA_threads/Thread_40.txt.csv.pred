1.5.1	http : //kvmswitchdirect.co.uk/Belkin-OmniCube.htm Alows you to run 2 ( or more depending on model ) pcs from one keboard/mouse/mon .	St
1.5.2	Will need an OS on each machine though .	St
1.5.3	As for sharing the resources/drives , you are going to need a network to share drives/storage .	St
1.5.4	If you are using a router already then that will prbably have at least 4 ports on it .	St

1.6.7	This router might do ( I do wish it had a firewall .	St
1.6.8	One Firewall would be better then two ) : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16833124309 & cm_re=routers_wired-_-33-124-309-_-Product	Ques
