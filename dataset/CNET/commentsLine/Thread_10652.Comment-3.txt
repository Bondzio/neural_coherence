i'm going to try this out, but yes definetly no vital data will be stored i know linux handles this: [setting up linux with firewire-based shared storage for oracle9i rac]  you can actually have more than two servers connected to the storage via firewire at the same time.. it would be kind of cool to have a shared hard drive at home with all the mp3s.. not much writing, mostly reading.. so they wouldn't have to struggle for access rights that much..
