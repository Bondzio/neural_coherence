I haven't tried using different sizes but I'm just imagining that if one took a 22&quot; LCD and a 17&quot; LCD and had both plugged into the same video card, how would that work for anything trying to go &quot;full screen&quot; as it is no longer a simple rectangle.
I was just taking a guess and never tried it myself, sorry.
