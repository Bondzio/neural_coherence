1.1.1	Okay so I have a dell dimension 4600 .	St
1.1.2	Pretty old , got it around 9 years a go .	St
1.1.3	It still works and is holding up .	St
1.1.4	I can do the usual stuff but if I have more than a few windows open , it starts to slow down big time .	St
1.1.5	Here are the stats : Intel & # 174 ; Pentium & # 174 ; 4 at 2.6ghz 256mb DDR RAM Nvidea GeForce FX 5200 and its running XP The CPU is fine , it does n't use up more than 20 % and it almost never even gets to 20 % .	St
1.1.6	I do n't need to upgrade video cards , I do n't really play games and that will be for a different computer .	St
1.1.7	So I 'm thinking of upgrading the ram .	St
1.1.8	So my PC runs Dual Channel DDR SDRAM and has four memory connectors .	St
1.1.9	The memory capacities are 128- , 256- , 512-MB or 1-GB .	St
1.1.10	The maximum memory supported is 4gb and the Memory types are PC2700 ( 333-MHz ) or PC3200 ( 400-MHz ) DDR SDRAM ( non-ECC ) So I was thinking of getting four 1gb sticks .	St
1.1.11	But I never really changed the hardware on my computer .	St
1.1.12	I know that RAM is easy to change because it does n't store anything 1 ) but would I have to change anything in the BIOS ?	Ques
1.1.13	2 ) would it be a good idea or not , considering the fact that I may be getting a better computer in maybe a year ?	Ques
1.2.1	Head to crucial.com and see how much but it 's a common upgrade .	St
1.2.2	As to 4GB , be sure to not expect all that to show up on XP .	St
1.2.3	It 's a common complaint that you read 1.9 to 3.5GB reported after this upgrade ( varies with the machine ) so some feel ripped off .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I want to upgrade to 4gb because its not that much more in price than 2gb .	St
1.3.2	So you think I should get 2gb for xp ?	Ques
1.4.1	I shared this because some felt cheated in some way .	St
1.4.2	There 's more to this with 2.0GB limits per app but if 4.0GB is available and is cheap , why not ?	Ques
