How much difference would that make? Also company says you have to buy new fan with heat sink(about $10-15.00)otherwise the warrenty is void. Any thoughts on that? Thank You

I'll write &quot;don't do this.&quot; The Compaq BIOS or motherboard or &quot;box&quot; is unlikely to support such a newer CPU. But it's a cheap gamble. I sense you may be second-guessing the need for the new heatsink, but could be wrong. In short, the new CPU can generate more heat and in that alone a new proper sized heatsink is required. This also brings up a nagging problem in that Compaq may not have fitted the box with a whopper power supply and you may experience hangs and freezes as the new CPU makes a power demand and there is no spare Watts. The case design can also be less than stellar and the extra heat may not find a way out. Simply leaving the cover off may fix that. Bob

The computer came with a cpu fan+heatsink and a case fan(is that what you call it, it sucks air out of the comp to the outside?)Mabey if i e-mail Compac they can tell me what watts the power supply is. How many watts do i need anyway? Thanks fishingman

Since my hint was not strong enough, then let me repeat that the supplier's warranty notice was the proper response to those who will not fit a new proper sized heatsink with a new fan. How else will they make this issue known? I strongly suggest not to do this. Unless you double the clock rate, the effect is usually lost since the rest of the machine is the same old speed and you may not feel any gain at all. But it's a cheap upgrade if it works. It would be amazing to see HP/Compaq support this endeavor. As to the power supply Watts. The system will only draw what it needs, but as a power ages, it's spare capacity dwindles. Effects of an overtaxed power supply are random booting, unannounced reboots, lockups and such. Since garden variety 450 Watt power supplies are under 20 dollars, I fit nothing less than this size.

That is all i wanted to know. Buy the way, Compac says it has a 400 watt power supply. It actually seems to run just fine for what i use it for so far,mild games, internet, and keeping track of expenses and what not. My kids have a slightly newer comp. with a 700 celeron and mine runs circles around it. Thank You
