<s> I am currently expanding my home network to support a digital Movie library (both SD and HD) and am looking for some recommentations on network storage that I can incremental expand as my storage requriements increase. </s>
<s> My needs are for media streaming over my 1000Mbps network and centralized backup. </s>
<s> I have looked as some of the Windows Home Server soultions, but would prefer an network device, so I don't have the hassle of another windows operating system to manage. </s>
<s> I have looked at the LinkSys Media Hub (NMH410 $ 430 on Amazon) , but would like something that has more upward expansion (it currently supports two SATA 1 TB disks). </s>
<s> Does anyone have any other suggestions? </s>
<s> Do a shopping search for NAS. </s>
<s> Network Attached Storage. </s>
<s> Here's what I've found...I encourage you to run a search on &quot;Network Attached Storage Reviews&quot; or Network Attached Storage Recommendations&quot;. </s>
<s> PCMAG, CNET, Network World, PCWorld, Amazon.com all have lists of some sort. </s>
<s> What I do is evaluate other users' reviews consistency across the board for an overall sense of the NAS' which bubble to the top. </s>
<s> In the end, it all depends on what you want to do. </s>
<s> HP's MediaSmart next model was launched recently, as was Western Digital. </s>
<s> However, it seems that NetGear(Infrant) models are getting consistently higher reviews from a wider range of users. </s>
<s> Buffalo Technology's Terastation or Linkstation Pro are also seeming to be more consistent across a larger base of users. </s>
<s> There are others (Synology, Iomega, Seagate/Maxtor) which may warrant closer examination. </s>
<s> I'm hoping to narrow my choices down, but for me it's important to have remote web access, RAID redundancy, ease of use for the typical user, printer sharing, etc. </s>
<s> But I can identify with you that it is a bit daunting, particularly since this will be a new venture for me. </s>
<s> I must say that some of the reviews tend to be more directed toward a small/medium business user or small company with an IT dept. </s>
<s> I just desire more of a PnP type assembly for the home user with lots of media growing needs. </s>
<s> My 2 cents. </s>
