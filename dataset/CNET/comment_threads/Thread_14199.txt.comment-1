I bought a Dell Dimension 8400 series about 6 months ago.
So far its been running smoothly but I have been considering upgrading and possibly installing new hardware.
I have been able to find most of the systems specs at the Dell site but for the life of me I cant seen to find anything on the motherboard.
I had heard that Dells customer service/tech support had a lot to be desired.
Well I found that out first hand, needless to say I still dont know what brand, make or model the motherboard is.
Does anybody know who makes Dells boards and how I can find out which board I have.
Thanks.
