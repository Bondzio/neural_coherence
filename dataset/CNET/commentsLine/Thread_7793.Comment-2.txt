i'd remove it and put it into an external enclosure with a usb connection and collect data that way.
unreadable areas of that hard drive are going to create problems for some backup software.
you do this manually.
i'd also think that, if he technician is going to replace the hard drive, he's also going to recreate the recovery partition during the restore process.
hidden partitions are something that regular backup utilities don't deal with.
some imaging/cloning software will but they may halt on read errors.
get what you can manually.
