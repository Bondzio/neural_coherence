i've got a pair of 62ts connected to my main stereo amplifier but in a basement room.
i'd rate them as ok but not terrific.
my primary speakers are an old pair of jbl l65 jubals bought in the '70s.
they make the 62ts sound like a budget boom box from walmart.
believe it or not, i also have a set of klipsch promedia 2.1s connected to my pc.
i think there is more than one version of these.
mine have a black and orange plastic oval near the bottom that says klipsch thx.
if you have these same speakers, i'd say leave them alone.
i wouldn't consider trying to connect them to the satellite wiring.
they work well with the sub woofer.
i don't see what a couple more small woofers are going to add and i also doubt that the signal from the sub woofer would be properly equalized to power other low frequency speakers.
i doubt that's what you're looking for but can't offer much encouragement here.
