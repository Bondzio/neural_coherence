<s> Can anyone recommend a scanner to scan Farbic Collage? </s>
<s> They're not very thick - a few layers of fabric. </s>
<s> I print a photo on my inkjet printer which is then sewn onto fabric -usually silk. </s>
<s> The fabric can be shiny and doesn't photograph well. </s>
<s> I thought a scanner would do a better job. </s>
<s> The end result will go on my website. </s>
<s> Most forums concentrate on photo scanning. </s>
<s> My intent is rather unusal. </s>
<s> I think a resolution of 3200X6400 dpi will do. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help! </s>
<s> I need to think anything with much texture is going to be a challenge for any scanner. </s>
<s> These don't do well with shiny surfaces either. </s>
<s> I am not sure what problems you are having with photographic methods. </s>
<s> If you use a flash head on, this will not work. </s>
<s> Light can be manipulated quite a bit. </s>
<s> If the light is well diffused, it should come out fairly even. </s>
<s> If you want the image to show a little sheen in the fabric, you can leave it somewhat wrinkled and use some side lighting which which can be angled to cause some subtle reflections. </s>
<s> I'm for going back to the camera. </s>
<s> The problem I'm having with the camera is that the camera is a not much - a Gateway w/5 mega pixel. </s>
<s> I can take good pictures of cotton fabric but it's the silk or exotic fabrics that don't do well. </s>
<s> My options were to buy a realy good digital camera ($$$) or a scanner so I thought a scanner would be less expensive. </s>
<s> Also, I don't know much about photography or scanning but I have a feeling I'm going to have learn one or the other to get what I need. </s>
<s> Thanks for your response. </s>
