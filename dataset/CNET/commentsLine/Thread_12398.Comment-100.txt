i am looking too for something that can handle cardstock really well.
i have 2 xeroxes 7750 and 7760 the both curl the paper as it comes out.
the 7750 likes to move the paper so nothing prints straight.
the 7760 like to feed 5 sheets at once and jam every 5 minutes, it also a big fan of printing the first 300 or so ok then after that it starts printing a lot lighter, and i have to give it a break.
i have a canon 3220 that is the worst it hates anything heavy than regular paper and card stock has to go through the special side tray so every time the paper tray is empty you have to go to the printer and set up what size and type the paper is, big pain in the ass, especially when you have to print over 800 copies and the tray holds 25 sheets of paper.
i had a xante cl30 hse which was the best so far, takes it fast, print quality is awesome, what's not awesome is there customer service department you have to fight them to get someone to fix the printer when it goes down.
i pay for a service contract for piece of mind, they did everything not to send someone out to fix the machine.
the machine is 3 years old and dead.
has anyone found anything else i refuse to believe xante is the only company to solve this problem.
