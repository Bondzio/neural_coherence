1.1.1	I have a ethernet enabled device that I would like to connect to my wireless network .	St
1.1.2	I can not add a wireless nic to this device ( e.g .	St
1.1.3	PCI , PCMCIA , USB , etc ) , so I purchased a wireless bridge ( Morotola WE800g ) .	St
1.1.4	I configured this from a laptop and then connected it to the device .	St
1.1.5	The device can connect to other devices on my network , but nothing on the network can connect to the device behind the bridge .	St
1.1.6	I tested this with two laptops .	St
1.1.7	Laptop A connected to network with either builtin wireless , or wired directly to router ( 3Com OfficeConnect ADSL Firewall Wireless Router - 3CRWDR100A-72 ) , and laptop B connected to the bridge .	St
1.1.8	B can connect fine to A ( e.g .	St
1.1.9	ping , ftp , etc ) , but A can not connect to B .	St
1.1.10	Sometimes when doing a & quot ; ping -t & quot ; , I might get 1 response in 10 , but generally I get timeouts .	St
1.1.11	I found some comments on web of similar problems with the WE800g , so I got a Netgear WGE101 bridge , but I 'm having same problems with that one .	St
1.1.12	Neither of the laptops have a firewall running , and I 've also tried turning off the WEP encryption on the network .	St
1.1.13	Also , two laptops on the network ( one with builtin wireless , and one with PCMCIA wireless card ) can connect to each other fine .	St
1.1.14	One other point to note : when using the Motorola bridge , only the computer behind it turns up on the network ( as reported by the assigned IP list in the router ) , but when using the Netgear , both the bridge and the computer get assigned IPs .	St
1.1.15	Anyone have any idea ?	Ques
1.1.16	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	maybe your ''ethernet enabled device '' is broken..	St
1.3.1	I know this is pretty obvious but have you tried a cross over Ethernet cable ?	Ques
1.4.1	When I found that it didnt work on the ethernet enabled device , I tried a number of differnet setups using two laptops .	St
1.5.1	Do you mean from device to bridge , or just connecting a computer to the device using a crossover cable ?	Ques
1.5.2	With the first bridge ( Motorola WE800g ) , I got it second hand and there was no cable with it , I 've mostly been using a standard patch cable , but tried once or twice with a crossover cable ( but have not tested this extensively ) .	St
1.5.3	With the second bridge ( Netgear WGE101 ) , I 've been using the cable provided with it .	St
1.5.4	If you mean connecting a computer to the device with a crossover cable : that 's what I have been doing to transfer stuff to / from it ( and works fine ) , but for convenience I would like to simply have it on the wireless network .	St
