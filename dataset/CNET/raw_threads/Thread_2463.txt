I have been able to replace my IR remotes but now want to be able to do away with my RF remotes as well. Can someone tell me how to take the RF signals from my various remotes , and be able to channel through some device and then through my iPAD then to the appliance? Is it possible?

Unlike the IR controls which is a pure bit on software kit, this requires much more work. I find many are not ready for this work but as I have done this in the past I do have solid ideas on how to create it. However there appears to be no off the shelf system to note yet. If there is something made it would be specific to what you would control. Bob

I'd get something like a IP controlled relay box like http://www.controlanything.com/ Now I can wire up those relays to that curtain or even the RF control device. Like I said, this is not for a consumer to do but for those that create stuff. Bob
