<s> Hi, my name is Mike Myatt and I have a problem with my computer It has an AMD Athlon 64 X2 4200+, at 2.2GHz, Socket AM2 wich is just turning off with no warning. </s>
<s> I think this is because the CPU is overheating. </s>
<s> Can I correct this by changing the heatsink ? </s>
<s> Now it looks the heatsink is properly attached. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>

<s> Take a look at this software here: http://www.download.com/Motherboard-Monitor/3000-2086_4-10518385.html?tag=lst-0-1 This should tell you what you are just guessing at now. </s>
<s> If it conforms what you suspect, then you can take a look at the heat sink and fan assembly for the CPU. </s>
<s> It could be something else but at least you will have an idea where to look. </s>
<s> Is this an off the shelf, big box mfg PC or a BYOPC ? </s>
<s> The onlyh real way to tell is remove the HS fan, clean the surfaces, reapply thermal grease and reinstall the HS fan. </s>
<s> I recommend downloading/installing 'Sensorsview' to give you CPU and HDD temps. </s>
