<s> My computer is gone. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, while I was waiting to get into college, I was staying at this very bad place and it got very hot and even when my computer wasn't on or plugged in but I lost everything (but I still have everything backed up so I can re-install everything again) and when I tried to do that, it crashed once again. </s>
<s> Is it too late to do anything about this? </s>
<s> Am I wasting my time? </s>
<s> Am I going to have to replace it?? </s>
<s> It is a compaq with memory card readers. </s>
<s> Right now the fans turn on high and all it has is a blank screen where the &quot;Windows XP&quot; loading thing should be at. </s>
<s> I probably need to replace my Samsung Color Laser Printer. </s>
<s> Look at the items on my profile for pictures of what they look like. </s>
<s> At least I don't have to get an entire system since I have a mouse & keyboard & 19&quot; LCD monitor. </s>
<s> Try opening the system case and place a household fan to blow-in and see if that helps. </s>
<s> Understand, if the room temp is outrageously hot or humid, that it maybe too much and far more attention to cooling is required. </s>
<s> If you continue to operate the system is such conditions w/o proper cooling it can only lead to a failure of some sort. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I have moved the computer to a much cooler location in an air conditioned room. </s>
<s> In addition to cooling it off with a fan, would vacuuming the inside of it help get rid of any dust it might have?? </s>
<s> I tried to re-install the operating system, and it says that the hard drive can't be formatted, so the hard drive is really messed up. </s>
<s> I looked at the prices of a replacement, and also possibly a new operating system, and both of these prices are reasonable, I am just worried that installing a new hard drive on the affected computer system might possibly damage the new hard drive or something. </s>
<s> I knew I needed a new hard drive. </s>
<s> I got a new one. </s>
<s> The fans BROKE, as in the blades fell off... Wow. </s>
<s> But the people that fixed it installed new fans and thermostats that says what the computer's temperature is, and has a control of how high the fans are. </s>
<s> Right now the fans are set to 100%. </s>
<s> There are several other things that came with the repaired computer. </s>
