1.1.1	Hi, I currently own a Dell Dimension 3000.	St
1.1.2	I know, I know.	St
1.1.3	But anyways, it has one CD Drive, which is just that.	St
1.1.4	Not CD-RW or DVD Drive.	St
1.1.5	What the weird thing is that when my computer goes into Standby the CD seems to turn itself off.	St
1.1.6	It is not seen in either the Device Manager or in My Computer.	St
1.1.7	I have to restart the computer to find it.	St
1.1.8	I've checked for Virus' and Spyware/Adware.	St
1.1.9	Nothing found using McAfee and AVG 7.1.	St
1.1.10	I've done the basics, checked the power cables on the Drive and also the IDE cables.	St
1.1.11	The weird thing is that the drive still opens and closes when the computer can't &quot;find&quot; it.	St
1.1.12	Thanks!	St

1.2.1	that your computer is just turning the drive off just to save some power...	St
1.2.2	But to me it might be a virus...	St
1.3.1	But I'd never heard of a computer shutting down a IDE device to save power.	St
1.3.2	I've heard of the computer maybe shutting down a USB device, but never of a IDE device.	St
1.3.3	Either way I scoured the device manager properties of the CD drive to see what it had about power.	St
1.3.4	It was listed as S3.	St
1.3.5	But like I said, it still get's power and it'll open and close the drive bay.	St
1.3.6	I'd thought about virus' but as I mentioned I scanned with two virus' programs...	St
1.3.7	Thanks for the reply!	St
1.3.8	~Ibrahim~	St
1.4.1	Check Dell's suppport website for any FAQ's or details that direct you to frequent problems.	St
1.4.2	It maybe a known problem with a cure.	St
1.4.3	I suggest for now to &quot;turn-off&quot; stand-by and see if that alone rids the problem.	St
1.4.4	Then proceed to what if any cures are provided by Dell.	St
1.4.5	If none, check MS knowledge base for again any problems associated with CD drives.	St
1.4.6	You can google away and see what responds as well.	St
1.4.7	More often than not, someone has already experienced your problem and provided the solution to install or guide you through it.	St
1.4.8	tada -----Willy	St
1.5.1	I've realized that it wasn't stand-by that was causing the problem, but when I exited Age of Empires 2 the CD drive would disappear.	St
1.5.2	I'm going thru the FAQ's as I type.	St
1.5.3	Thanks!	St
1.5.4	~Ibrahim~	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
