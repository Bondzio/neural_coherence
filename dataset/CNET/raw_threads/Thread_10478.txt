I will try to explain it as much as I can. Say I connected to my network, but then, if I turn off the router without turning off the wireless on my laptop, and then I turn the router back on again, my laptop wont connect to the network again -- it can't even find any access points! (I got two access points in my house) -- (I have to restart my laptop to fix it) But, I wont have any issues if I turn off the wireless on my laptop before turning off the router. It would connect again with no problem. Does anyone think it could be a service that I disabled or put on manual? Any help greatly appreciated. Thank You!
