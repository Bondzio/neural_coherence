i just purchased a new dell pc which runs windows vista.
i would like to connect the harddrive from my previous pc (running xp) to the harddrive for my new pc (running vista).
after connecting the harddrives, how would i go about formatting the secondary harddrive?
do i simply right-click the drives that appear and click format?
after formatting, how do i partition new drives for the harddrive?
thank you.
any help will be greatly appreciated.
