If so, it might be possible to recover some data while you can as it may be that the drive is in a failure process if not gone already. There are tools to repair the master boot record or reinstall system files. Again, you need a startup or recovery disk. The &quot;fdisk&quot; utility on the startup disk, by using the /mbr switch, might accomplish this but I don't remember if the &quot;sys&quot; command works as it did with old DOS originals. Otherwise, you can try to reinstall Windows from the CD without reformatting first. No guarantees but maybe worth a shot. Good luck.

Startup problems are noted at http://support.microsoft.com/?id=188867 There is no single item that sticks out in your post. Bob
