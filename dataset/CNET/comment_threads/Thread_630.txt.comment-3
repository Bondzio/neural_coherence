Thanks for the advice, I looked at the 7300's and never thought about them being a temp solution.
Once I upgrade his card, I can install the 7300 in my computer and give it a little tweek.
Of course being in Canada I can't buy from newegg, they don't ship up here.
But I did find one locally for only a couple of dollars more than the listed price on newegg.
Next I have to actually build this thing...
