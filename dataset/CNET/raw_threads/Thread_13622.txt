I've been very helpful so far, but the problem is still there, and it boils down to this: How do I convert a FAT32 formatted drive which the system says is a RAW drive into NTFS without losing all my data on there? I would hate to have to install all my programs again... And if that is not possible, how do I format D: into NTFS? I tried the setup CD, but it didn't really get me there. Rather with a 98 disk and FDISK? Thirdly: Is there any way to divide my D: (64GB) into more partitions via Windows? Could anyone help me to convert it without loosing any data there? Gee, I hope, anybody has a clue to this...

The plain fact is any so-called s/w that does this will claim, &quot;back-up&quot; before use anyways. You proceed at your own risk using whatever s/w. Take that as a warning and decide whta you want to do. Quite franky, if you have another HD, then clone one drive to another. Once you verify everything is OK, then re-use the HD and reformat it to the way you want it. You mentioned W98 disk and FDISK, these are old OS tools, so just what are your end uses? devide a 64Gb HD may not if you use XP or better in more than 2 partitions wouldn't provide much storage once done, etc. Even, if you did this and then try using in W98 setup, that won't work period or hic-up in some way. . Checkout Parition Magic and/or Gparted or even Norton's old Ghost s/w. Freebies or shareware, check website filebases for all that. I look at these or goolge away: http://www.jumbo.com http://www.majorgeeks.com http://www.tucows.com Check below and find the DOWNLOADS area of CNet as well for any helpful s/w. tada -----Willy

I want to point out, too often when it comes to saving data after some mishap or misstep it becomes even harder to recover it's out of the end user's hands any more. As a tech that tries when the poor results or even during a 2nd attempt at recovery is nil or hapless as any s/w won't do especially if there is a h/w fault at core of problem. You seem to have a working HD, but some condition that made it less capable or as expected. Again, you did well and the s/w used was able to get good results. Please, take all this a lesson and checkout the &quot;storage forum&quot; sticky that has many hints, clues, and tips for similar recovery problems. enjoy ------Willy
