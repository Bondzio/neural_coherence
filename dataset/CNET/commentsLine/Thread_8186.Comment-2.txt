it's definitely some hardware problem (if i define the boot portion of the bios as hardware), most likely the motherboard.
if you were able to get into the bios setup, you could try to reset it to defaults, but i expect that doesn't work (is it your f8, or is there another key on the e-machine to do so?).
then all you can do is repair the machine yourself or have it done.
be sure the costs are reasonable.
if they have to replace everything, a new pc could be cheaper and better.
but if it's just a rotten memory stick, it could be very cost-effective.
