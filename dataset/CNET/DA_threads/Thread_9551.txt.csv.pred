1.1.1	My current desktop monitor just died , so I am faced with the decision of whether to get a regular LCD monitor ( that could play TV with a tuner in my computer ) or a HDTV .	Sug
1.1.2	They would both be the same size ( 19 inch ) , but I wanted to see what people think the pros/cons would be of getting one vs the other .	St
1.1.3	I assume they would be able to achieve roughly the same resolution and performance as a computer monitor , and if I got an HD tuner for my computer , they might be similar as TVs too .	St
1.1.4	Would there be any difference in expected life or other factors ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	your primary use is as a TV away from the desk , get a hi-def monitor .	St
1.2.2	TV/monitor combos usually lower res than monitor alone in your size .	St
