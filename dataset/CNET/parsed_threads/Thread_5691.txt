<s> Currently i have this configuration for my desktop: Intel P915GAV mobo Pentium 4 3.0 GHz 1.5 GB DDR RAM 1 x 320 GB 7200rpm HDD GeForce 6200 TC GPU 1 x DVD-RW 1 x DVD-Rom (Optical Drives are connected via Y-cable splitter (power)) 500W Power Supply I'm planning to upgrade my GPU to a GeForce 7900GS and ADD another 320 GB HDD... both these need to be directly connected to the power supply, meaning i'm going to use another 2 Y-cable splitter for them. </s>
<s> is my power supply going to handle all these? </s>
<s> And i am a heavy computer user... 24x7 use of PC and maybe an 8 hour rest every week or two... </s>
<s> I think it will be fine. </s>
<s> My kid has a similar setup with similar power supply. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> right now, my mobo temperature monitor already goes up to high/critical as it is... i only have a single fan from my generic ATX case... how would it do if i just completely remove my side case? </s>
<s> i don't have an option for liquid cooling coz it's not available in my country... </s>
<s> I haven't taken the time to punch a big hold in the case cover yet. </s>
<s> Good workaround. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> you said it's ok if cooling is great... if i leave my case off, i would have any fan (except for the power supply fan), but i would have a big hole... you think this is good enough? </s>
<s> ...if i leave my case off, i WOULDN'T have any fan (except for the power supply fan)... </s>
<s> Should be fine. </s>
<s> In fact I'd pull the case cover now since the high temps age the parts faster. </s>

<s> Use an AC desk personal 6in. </s>
<s> fan or a &quot;clamp-on&quot; fan to direct airflow into the open system case. </s>
<s> I've done this for yrs. </s>
<s> when the old home is too hot and want to cool the system. </s>
<s> I can probably use typical 120mm fans with a mtrbd./psu connection but the household fan does just fine and lessen the psu for that. </s>
<s> When it gets real hot inside the house a 10in. </s>
<s> fan is a back-up. </s>
<s> Yeah, I don't live in a A/C cooled home, but for the bedroom. </s>
