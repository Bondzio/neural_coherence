Hi- I too am having a terrible time getting my new scanner to scan properly.
I'm running on an HP with Windows XP, don't think my computer is the problem.
When scanning slides, I get half the photo green, half red.
Anybody have any idea what would be causing this?
It's a brand new scanner, I have yet to have any useable scans completed.
Grrrrrr...
