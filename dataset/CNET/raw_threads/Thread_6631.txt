Any known issues with the slimline models? It appears you can't add a second HD (I can live with that).

That's my two cents worth. http://www.shopping.hp.com/product/computers/desktops/s3200z_series/rts/3/computer_store/GN567AA%2523ABA;HHOJSID=SnqTHvhZ7fnQQKT6lKsFkLfnNvYvSmxXQKhfLbYGD2P1PcV13QqR!-892243380 This thread untracked

I can play Call of Duty 4 with no probs even with the resolution set at higest. I also got the HP pocket drive. This machine was worth the bang for the buck. I am not a serious gamer but more or less both gamer and work user on the comp. I like it!

Generally....I don't like slim lines: minimal heat dissipation, low capacity PSUs, limited expandability for additional drives (no drive free/open drive bays) and limited slots and choices for peripherals . . . esp. GPUs (because of slim/low profile case). VAPCMD

What kind of power does your graphics card draw? I would like to upgrade my s3220n card but am fearful about this.

But, you need to be aware that your video card upgrade options are more limited because you need a low-profile card. That said, I think the Intel Core 2 Duo version - s3200t - offers more flexibility in configuration than the AMD version. You can configure one starting at about $450. BTW: I own an HP Media Center PC and it's the best designed and most reliable PC I've ever owned. In my experience, HP is a good choice for PCs.

It was a standard video card but I unscrewed the bracket, took the VGA port from it and used a low profile bracket instead. I am not using the TV Tuner though, so I took it from the PC since it would allow more room for the video card. (Video card's fan was too close to the TV Tuner) So far I havent had any problems. Been playing COD4, Gears of Wars and Bioshock without any problems.
