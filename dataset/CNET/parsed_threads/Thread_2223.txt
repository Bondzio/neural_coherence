<s> I have an old HP Laser Jet 2100 that was running under Windows 2000, non USB port. </s>
<s> I want to connect the printer to a laptop HP Pavillion dv1000 with USB port. </s>
<s> I went to HP site and found drivers that I suspect are for later models of the 2100. </s>
<s> I got the physical connector to enable me to use USB port of the laptop. </s>
<s> How can I get a driver that will run under XP on my laptop. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any ideas? </s>
<s> http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=293378 However, the number of times I see people who install XP and forget the motherboard drivers is amazing. </s>
<s> The dv1000 came with XP so unless you did something odd, it should just work. </s>
