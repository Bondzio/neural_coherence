I have been looking at a LG BD360.
I cannot determine if it will play other video like networks (abc, nbc etc) and free tv.
It sounds to me like it will but do not want to purchase something that will not do what I want.
I looked at your suggestions but doesn't sound like they will let me watch free tv from the web.
I appreciate your response.
Thanks
