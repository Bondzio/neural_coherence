I want to purchase a new desktop and have tried to learn all I need to know to make the best purchase. Now my brain is fried. I'm pretty sure I want an Intel Dual 2 core proc, alteast 2-5 gigs of fast ram, a fast bus, a great video card, etc (in other words I want the thing to be fast) The biggest software program I run is Quickbooks Pro, soon to be 2008. I'd love to download music and small videos without problems. I don't know how to build a puter, and can't find one that's got all I want in a package. BTW, don't want to spend more than $800-$1,000. My question is can someone tell me where's the best place to buy and exactly what specs to make sure are included? I promise not to hold anyone responsible later and will be eternally grateful not to think about this again for another 5 years. Thanks in advance.

Proffitt	3/10/08 10:26 AM	1.20514476E12	&quot;2-5 gigs of fast ram&quot;	Given that today's most common versions of Windows don't give more than 2GB of ram to the application and even then only 3G with cajoling and the application compiled &quot;special&quot; why are you thinking of going beyond 2GB?

How about future needs and wants? Both of these sites allow you to customize for your needs and wants. Both sell pretty good Computers. I like HP myself but I would buy a Dell. Dell: http://configure.us.dell.com/dellstore/config.aspx?c=us&cs=19&l=en&oc=DDCWDE2&s=dhs HP: http://www.shopping.hp.com/webapp/shopping/computer_can_series.do?storeName=computer_store&category=desktops&a1=Category&v1=Versatile+computing&series_name=a6360t_series You might also want to see some reviews: http://reviews.cnet.com/desktop-computers/?tag=ont.desk I'd suggest a Desktop....avoiding mini towers, mid towers, and laptops. When it comes to computing it's all about speed and power. These other systems lack speed and power in differing ways. Only choose a laptop if you need portability. You want a work horse not a center piece. When you get your choices narrowed down to two or three I'd check out the motherboard on them. This component will determine how much you can upgrade the system in the future. Hope this helps. Good luck.

They don't use cheap but overpriced proprietary equipment like I've come to expect from most of the big name brand company's (like dell, packard bell etc.). They also have reasonable prices and make some very nice budget gaming systems.
