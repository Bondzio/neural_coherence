<s> I have a new HP Pavilion a1510n with XP MCE 2005. </s>
<s> It has the built onto mother board sound (AC 97) with Realtek drivers. </s>
<s> It sounds ok, but I have wondered if I would notice any real inprovement with installing a seperate sound card, or would that just be more money for negligible improvement? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> What I found was that it did have less hiss and noise but I had to connect it to a rather big speaker set to notice it. </s>
<s> On the headphones I could barely tell. </s>
<s> NOW THERE IS ONE AREA THAT WAS REALLY BETTER. </s>
<s> This was the audio capture. </s>
<s> That was definitely many steps up. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, Bob </s>
<s> i think there's a definite improvement in sound quality with an audigy 4/x-fi over built-in sound. </s>
<s> definitely worth the $40. </s>

<s> I bought a X-Fi gamer and love it. </s>
<s> I noticed a lot of sounds that I was missing with the AC-97 Hi def onboard sound. </s>
<s> I spent about $100 on mine and I think it was worth it. </s>
