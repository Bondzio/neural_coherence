i'd start with a clean install of your good old legitimate windows 7. install sp1, installl all updates, install antivirus and only install trusted applications.
if you still get bsod's it's a hardware issue.
if everything is fine and you install other software and troubles begin, you know where to search for the cause.
and maybe even everything stays fine.
