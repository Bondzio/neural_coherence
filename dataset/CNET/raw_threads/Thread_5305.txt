I ended the day with a $900 list specifying what I needed to make a custom gaming rig. Funny how things work out, amirite? So, anyway, I found a guide that outlined things you had to look for in your hardware and what specs would be good for a middle-ish gaming rig. I myself am an avid WoW player (Level 80 tankadin on the Dark Iron- US server, same name as my username), but I see myself expanding in the realm of games in the future, so I tried to get some &quot;wiggle&quot; room in the future. The main reason I am posting all of this is to see if any tech-savvy people could comb the list I have and see if I am missing something or my parts don't work &quot;like clockwork&quot;. I'd also like to know if someone could recommend a certain tower to house all of this; it is rather hard for me to envision the dimensions of this project, so someone who has done this before could really help out. xD So, here it is: CPU: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115057 CPU Cooling: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835186134 Motherboard: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128359 RAM: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231121 Hard Drive: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136098 Video Card: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102822 Monitor: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824009127 Power Supply: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139005 Keyboard: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16823175103 Mouse: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16826104318 I know it is a laundry list essentially, but I'd love some comments on this. Besides the tower, I was also wondering what OS I should use (XP/Windows 7) and what the best way to get it would be; I mean, $200 for an OS? Ugh... BTW, will I also need to buy cables to connect all of this, or do the come with this &quot;gear&quot;? I know, I'm such a newbie xD But when I can see that getting a rig with these specs in a custom fashion can save me a hundreds... I'll swallow my pride.

I would also get a bigger hard drive, at least 500gb with 16mb cache(16mb would mean faster performance). Both items are only a few dollars more. I would also suggest getting 4gb of ram minimum. I think you would be better off getting a higher clocked dualcore instead of the quad core. You could probably getby with an overclocked pentium dual core and its half the price of the processor you currently have listed. if you are a student, microsoft is offering a full version of microsoft windows 7 home or PROFESSIONAL for ~$40, but you must have a valid .edu address. Alternatively, you could also get windows server 2003R2, windows server2008, and windows server2008R2 via dreamspark, also need a valid .edu email address.

Unfortunately, I am not a (college) student, so it looks like I ain't getting any subsidies. :P About the RAM; I read that only 64 bit versions of OS's can utilize more than 4g of RAM... do they mean 4g and above, or just above 4g? Great call on the processor! I found one that is practically 100 dollars cheaper and should run all my gaming needs: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116072 BTW, if you don't mind me asking, what allows that dual core to perform as well or better than a quad core which is 100 dollars more? Or do quad cores excel in something other than the dual cores?

6677	4	362147	3142000	3141929	Scien	10/4/09 10:25 AM	1.2546519E12	Funny you should suggest that.	Lol, I spent some time looking for RAM and eventually settled on that model. So, I settled on a case as well and now the only hole in this list would be the OS. I am probably going to go for a 64 bit version, Windows 7 if possible. Is there anything that might convince me to go with an XP version?
6677	5	362147	3142003	3142000	Scien	10/4/09 10:34 AM	1.25465244E12	To reply to myself...	I just went onto Newegg and found the option to buy a 64 bit Windows Vista Home Premium which &quot;comes with a Windows 7 Upgrade coupon&quot; for 100 dollars. Could someone tell me what this means? Does that mean I'd have to install Vista first, send in my coupon, wait for a Windows 7 Upgrade disc, and then install Windows 7? Or is it more streamlined than that?

Keep shopping over the next 3 weeks and you'll skip the upgrade and the usual &quot;now what is that file?, is that from Vista?&quot; questions. Bob
6677	7	362147	3142047	3142006	Scien	10/4/09 1:06 PM	1.25466156E12	Alright	Thanks everybody for replying. Hopefully I can get all this together... if not, you'll hear from me :P

6677	11	362147	3142218	3141637	ramarc	10/4/09 5:49 PM	1.25467854E12	replace hd 4830 with hd 4770 or hd 4850	4770 is as fast as 4850 and both are faster than the hd 4830. either can be found for $99 on newegg. WD5000AAKS is a 500gb caviar blue and is a bit faster (due to double the cache) than the 320gb model for only $10 more. WD6400AAKS 640GB is the next generation and a good bit faster than the 320gb version. Antec EarthWatts EA650 650W is $85 and a very good power supply for your mid-level rig. here's a [url=http://www.hardocp.com/article/2009/09/18/antec_earthwatts_750w_psu_review/]review of the 750w model[url]. and windows7 is no-brainer over xp. spring for win7 pro (same price as xp) and it will include &quot;xp mode&quot; so you'll have the best of the new and the old OS flavors.

Thank goodness you pointed that power supply out; the one I had listed I never saw the actually price, just the reduced price! You sir, saved me 80 dollars xD As for your other suggestions, I have gone through with them. I also decided to keep the monitor I have now, shaving off some of the cost. And while Windows 7 Pro would be optimal... its pricing isn't. So I'll just stick with Home Premium.

6677	14	362147	3143120	3142277	Scien	10/5/09 8:20 PM	1.254774E12	Well the Newegg price is reduced right now.	The original one I had was 169.99, but was reduce to 90 with a 10 dollar mail in rebate. Right now I've been reducing and increasing the prices of all my materaisl, and it always comes out around 900. I know someone who has a potential .edu address, so I'm hoping I can get the subsidized Windows 7.
