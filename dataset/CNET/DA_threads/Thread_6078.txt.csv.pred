1.1.1	i have an emachines t6536 and just bought an evga geforce 7300gt i followed the manual perfectly , ( even disabled onboard video adapter ) , and when i plug the moniter into the new card , and start up my computer , i can hear it logging in ( all the normal windows music and stuff ) but the screan is blank !	St
1.1.2	if i plug the moniter into the onboard , it still works for some reason , and the screan has been loaded !	St
1.1.3	this is not the first time this has happened , ( other video cards too , all nvidia ) i just want to play the games that i bought this computer for .	St
1.1.4	send tips to bizsystm @ inbox.com or post here	St
1.2.1	also i have new 680w psu , upgraded to 2gb ram , both work perfectly	St
1.3.1	Reverify that the bios video port was disabled .	St
1.3.2	Check the Nvidia setting pgm .	St
1.3.3	for any selection of video ports or displays , swap if need be .	St
1.3.4	Boot into safe mode and goto the device mgr .	St
1.3.5	and delete all reference of video ports/cards , exit out and shut down .	St
1.3.6	Attach cable to new video card , reboot and enter the bios , reverify video port disabled , if correct OK , no , correct it , save and exit out .	St
1.3.7	Allow it to continue booting , hopefully it sees new h/w and you proceed with install then or its a plain video connection , now start the install after finish of boot .	St
1.3.8	This all becomes a & quot ; catch-22 situation & quot ; if it keeps defaulting to build-in port , that a bios glitch , see if eMachines has any new bios patches that may address this .	St
1.3.9	Are you sure any extra video power plugs are attached on the video acrd itself ( if required ) ?	Ques
1.3.10	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	thank you ill try that but i know its not a problem of missing power cables because the fan is running	Polite
