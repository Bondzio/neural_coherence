1.1.1	I really enjoy bass but i do n't necessarily need my teeth chattering .	Polite
1.1.2	I want to hear and feel the thump from the bass but not so heavy that it drowns out the mids and highs .	St
1.1.3	Ive done some research but i get mixed reviews on whether or not the Gigaworks can provide a clean heavy bass ( not exactly sub-woofer quality but still great ) .	St
1.1.4	Also Klipsch is a known high quality brand and i 'm hoping to use these speakers for a long time .	St
1.1.5	If anyone here has owned or heard both i would love your input , if you have n't then any advice can help .	Ques
1.2.1	I 've also selected the Bose companion 2 series 2 as a possibility .	St
1.3.1	Promedia 2.1 and it 's served me well for quite some time .	St
1.3.2	I do n't game but I do enjoy music at reasonable quality .	St
1.3.3	It 's really a matter of adjusting the bass to the right level as any sub-woofer can get muddy sounding .	St
1.3.4	My main home speaker system is still a pair of old JBL L65s ( a studio monitor series ) that spoils me but the Klipsch are nice on my PC .	St
1.3.5	I do n't need or want more than 2.1 .	St
1.3.6	Good luck in your search but it 's your ears that should do the judging .	Polite
