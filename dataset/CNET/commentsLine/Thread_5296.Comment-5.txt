first of all, you asked two separate questions.
the answer to the first is that shared memory means that the on-board graphics card shares memory with the system ram.
for example, if you have 2gb of ram and the graphics card uses 256mb of shared memory, then 256 mb of the system ram is used for the graphics card and subsequently the usable system ram for applications is reduced by that amount to 1.75 gb.
the second question asks whether the integrated graphics card is &quot;up to snuff&quot;.
this depends on several factors, including the onboard graphics chipset and the quality of the drivers.
for most applications, the onboard graphics card will perform well.
however, for very graphic intense applications such as video editing and high performance gaming, you would probably want to update to a dedicated video card with a better graphics processor and drivers, and possibly more memory, such as those from ati and nvidia.
this will also free up the 256mb of shared memory for applications to use.
