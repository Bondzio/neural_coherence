<s> I have an old Dell Dimension 4300S PC (Windows XP) that needs to have the video card replaced. </s>
<s> It is an ATI #1027311302(Rage 128 Ultra Video Card, a 16mb AGP (found this searching the part #). </s>
<s> While I know this is a very old computer, it is part of a business network of computers that need absolutely no bells or whistles at all. </s>
<s> I would like to find a simple video card that will replace the old one - and would like to buy a new one from a reputable seller vs. buying something refurbished from a company I don't know. </s>
<s> Cross referencing on the net seems to be difficult - I'm sure due to the age of the card but are there still &quot;simple&quot; video cards available? </s>
<s> If so, can you point me in the right direction? </s>
<s> Thank you - Carash123 </s>
<s> Given the case form factor...a low profile model might be a smart choice too. </s>

<s> I'm sorry to inform you, but older laptops are almost impossible to find replacement video hardware for. </s>
<s> AGP is old and only a select few even make them any more and those are all for desktops. </s>
<s> I'm not sure about your specific laptop but the graphics are more than likely atached to the mother board and you would not be able to replace it any way, when you looked up the part number it gave you the specs for an agp gard because they use the same chipset but I doubt that you have an actual agp slot inside. </s>
<s> Again this is atrue for 90% of laptops the highend gaming ones do have replaceable cards but there twice as expensive as there desktop counterparts. </s>
<s> Sorry I read the post on low profile and thought this was for a laptop. </s>
<s> Any of these cards should work fine. </s>
