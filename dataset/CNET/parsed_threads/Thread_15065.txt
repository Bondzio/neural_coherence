<s> I'm about buying a new monitor and i've to choose between 22 and 24 inches. </s>
<s> What would be better for gaming/movies, and why? </s>
<s> Can i enjoy full hd on 22&quot; as good as on 24&quot;? </s>
<s> Also, I'd like to hear your opinion about this one: http://www.iiyama.com/gl_en/products/prolite-e2409hds-1/ Note: I'm from Poland, so don't need opinions on the price (it's very small ;)), but on the technical site. </s>
<s> I'll be grateful for your help! </s>
<s> That human vision is a complex field. </s>
<s> The answer I've found over and over is to go with what the person likes or wants. </s>
<s> In watching movies, the usual person wants it to fill their field of vision for most scenes but at times the small screen is better. </s>
<s> Who needs a forty foot talking head? </s>

<s> But to know what is the best, I'd need to spend some time in front of that monitor, and I'm not able to do it. </s>
<s> I have no exp with LCD desktops (especially with 22 - 24&quot;), so I'm looking for some opinions which could help me to decide. </s>
<s> One of the specs I look at is the contrast ratio. </s>
<s> Your cheap displays have lower ratios. </s>
<s> Given nothing else, I pick by that number. </s>
