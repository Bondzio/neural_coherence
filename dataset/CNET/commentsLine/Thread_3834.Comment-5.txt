hi &quot;cvmallory&quot;, i hope i did not misread your mobo code (?k7s5a).
anyhow, i have the latter mobo in one machine and like yourself have had several (soluble) problems with it: 1. i could not get sound to work with win98.
2. when upgrading to minme, the os did not have the appropriate driver but the cd that came with the mobo installed sound without problem.
3. i could not get it to work with linux mandrake 9.1 and 9.2, but 10,0 had the right driver.
cheers eric
