<s> I've got a Dell DM051 series computer that was working fine till it started re-starting by itself and giving the following error message: &quot;Alert! </s>
<s> Previous attempts at booting this system have failed at checkpoint [ithr].For help in resolving this problem, please note this check point and contact Dell Technical Support.&quot; This is how I tried to solve the problem: 1) Unplugged all USB devices and any other devices except the Monitor. </s>
<s> 2) Entered CMOS & disabled &quot;Boot From USB&quot;. </s>
<s> 3) Cleared CMOS by removing the battery & moving the &quot;Clear CMOS&quot; jumper. </s>
<s> I did not add any new device to the PC!!! </s>
<s> What else can I try? </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> I can't tell how old and if you as a PC tech did the usual inspection for BAD CAPS (see google) as well as the usual cleaning and fan checks. </s>

<s> On top of what Robert offered to do, you should start looking at a replacement or swap it out, the PSU. </s>
<s> provided a direct replacement or one that can work for the time being, see if that makes any improvements. </s>
<s> Besides heat stress, a weak or poor PSU can cause restarts. </s>
<s> However, you can stop restarts as that is a bios action upon any failure. </s>
<s> In order to stop the re-looping of restarts, do that check the bios and &quot;disable that option&quot;. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> So it doesn't give you enough time to attempt booting into Safe Mode? </s>
<s> What OS? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> So you did what was suggested and contacted Dell Technical Support to help you resolve the problem? </s>
<s> What did they say when you told them about the [ithr] error? </s>
<s> Or didn't you yet? </s>
<s> Why not? </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> E-mailed Dell. </s>
<s> Still waiting for an answer/solution. </s>
