<s> What is the difference in the speed of SATA compared to ATA Raid 0? </s>
<s> Which one of the two is faster? </s>
<s> Also, which of the two is the most cost effective solution of the two options? </s>
<s> I would also get a motherboard that would support either of the two because I am planning on building my own gaming machine. </s>
<s> If you look at http://www.tomshardware.com you find that SATA and PATA can be, for arguments sake, speed equivilent. </s>
<s> Raid on either would have to be benchmarked. </s>

<s> SATA is the means by which the hard drive connects to the computer. </s>
<s> Raid (Redundant Array of Independant Disks) was originally a security backup device using multiple identical hard drives. </s>
<s> If one failed, all the data was still on one of the other drives. </s>
<s> RAID 0 changes this a bit however. </s>
<s> It takes 2 drives and creates a single drive. </s>
<s> Not unlike dual-channel memory. </s>
<s> It nearly double the rate that data can be both read and written. </s>
<s> It requires a special controller that is either built into the motherboard, or can come as a seperate controller card. </s>
