i recently bought an emachines t6410, and i'm quite impressed with the power, especially for the price, but i'm planning on adding a new video card (  ), and adding 1 gig of extra ram.
is the video card compatible (i'm pretty sure i have the pci express x16 slot), and what kind of ram should i look for?
do i have to worry about static-electricity?
