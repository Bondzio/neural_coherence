program that it comes with.....and enter all of the configurations there.
I about went crazy trying to get the correct settings of Svideo vs the other options only because I wasn't using the TV at all and was instead trying to configure it for my vcr.
A couple of emails back and forth with ATI tech support got me up and running pretty quickly and I kept the notes on what I needed to do.....but it was all in the tv player program settings and they were the same for a vcr as they would have been for the tv so start there.
If you need more help, post back and I'll hunt down the notes I took about this.
