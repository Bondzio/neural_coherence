I know how to set a DVD/CD rom to autoplay (MyComputer or Explorer, drive letter, properties, AutoPlay tab etc etc), and have tried various methods, including regedit to make it AutoPlay/AutoRun when any disc is inserted.
And nothing has worked.
All other functions with the drive works fine, just nothing I do will enable autoplay.
Is this a typical problem with this particular DVD drive?
If not, does anyone have advice on how to enable autoplay with this particular drive?
