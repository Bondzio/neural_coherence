i've tried most of the optimization suites you've seen out there--nothing even comes close to norton.
unfortunately, you have to buy their resource-hog antivirus with it.
i recommend not installing the antivirus section and use something better instead.
i use avast!
but norton's registry cleaner, windows debugger, and their defragmenter are the best i've found and very simple to use.
