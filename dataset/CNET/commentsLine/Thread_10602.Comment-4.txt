there was a 5700ultra, 5700, and 5700le.
the latter is still in production in light numbers.
i picked up a bfg 5700le and oc'ed it to 450/550 with stock cooling.
it played call of duty, metal of honor, and in the upper settings.
now its sitting in my junk box until i install it in my older dell.
the 9250 is much slower.
it doesn't even have a fan.
stick with the 5700le, which is much better.
