I was thinking of setting up a wireless print server and hooking up a printer. My desktop doesn't have wireless, Is it possible to use my wireless router to connect to a wireless print server? thanks

Let me share that if you try and fail it's not because it won't work but usually because of firewalls or other issues. Follow the directions, learn your firewalls and be ready to pack and return in the number of days the vendor gives you. Don't waste months trying to get it to work. Do not accept it if you can't make it work in one day. Bob
