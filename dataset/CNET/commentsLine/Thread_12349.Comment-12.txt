i would like to add to cflazone's remarks that brands do matter - especially if you have different brands on a network.
i had a linsys as my main router and a netgear on my second computer.
the problem arose when one went down and i called the linksys tech people.
they tried to fix the problem but said it could be the netgear, but they couldn't offer any help with it.
it almost felt like i should have a conference call with both the links and netgear technicians.
i changed my netgear for another linksys and now only have one technical help line to call.
