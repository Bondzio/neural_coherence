first, let me say, i'm very impressed with the knowledge of the members here.
last weeks question about sharing files and printer between pcs prompted my own question.
i have a mac g4 os 10.2 hooked up to a hp smartjet printer.
i also have a fujitsu laptop pc running xp pro.
they're both on a linksys wireless network.
my question is does anyone know if it's possible to share files and the printer between the mac and my laptop.
if so, how would i go about doing that?
thanks
