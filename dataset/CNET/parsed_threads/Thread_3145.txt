<s> Hi, I have a Dimension 3000 Pentium 4 computer with 256MB ram. </s>
<s> I would like to upgrade to 2 GB. </s>
<s> I found cheap ram on ebay and I contacted the seller to be sure that the ram is compatable. </s>
<s> The seller replied that my computer only can work with &quot;Low density&quot; ram and s/he refered me to another product that is more than double the price because it is &quot;low density&quot;. </s>
<s> The high density ram page is: http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=310096884056&ssPageName=ADME:X:RTQ:US:1123 And the Low density page is: http://cgi.ebay.com/1GB-PC3200-DDR-LOW-DENSITY-UNIVERSAL-RAM-MEMORY_W0QQitemZ120268766088QQihZ002QQcategoryZ44936QQcmdZViewItemQQ_trksidZp1742.m153.l1262 What do you think? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> All that link tells me is that it uses DDR ram, 184 PINs but it doesn't mention whether they are &quot;high density&quot; or &quot;low density&quot; and whether the &quot;high density&quot; ram would be compatible. </s>
<s> you something that won't work and will have to be returned for the right product. </s>
<s> That's a lot of hassle and wasted energy. </s>
<s> If you look at Crucial.com, RAM for your PC is in the same price range. </s>
