1.1.1	I have an 1100a with the attached scanner .	St
1.1.2	Worked fine on my old PC ( 400mHz P-2 , w2k ) .	St
1.1.3	Moved to a newer PC ( 3gHz P-4 , w2k ) and the scanner does n't work .	St
1.1.4	Gives error : & quot ; !	St
1.1.5	UNABLE TO LOCATE SCANNER Unable to start a scan session .	St
1.1.6	Device is disconnected. & quot ; Tried to query HP support , no reply , probably because 1100a is no longer supported .	St
1.1.7	Bought a CD which I hoped would be a newer driver but when installed , fails in the same way .	St
1.1.8	And it was the same 4.3.2.50 release even though the part number on the CD was different .	St
1.1.9	I installed the software on my laptop ( 500mHz P-3 , w2k ) and it works fine although if I unplug the parallel port cable I get the same error message .	St
1.1.10	Any suggestions would be appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	These tend to not work on new machines ( port speed changed ) or the OS is n't installed proper ( motherboard drivers ) .	St
1.2.2	You did n't share the gritty details .	St
1.2.3	If you supplied just what you did in your post above , HP and others may just write you off .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Its on a parallel port ( tried LPT1 & LPT2 ) and except that some of the older ones were not bidirectional am not aware of any settings it can do .	St
1.3.2	Of course it could be flakeyness in the MB/BIOS as I have found other glitches in this MB ( ECS 848P-A ) and I am considering scrapping it and putting in a better one .	St
1.3.3	I selected it because it was on sale together with the P-4 .	St
1.3.4	What would I look for in the BIOS ?	Ques
1.3.5	Rich	St
1.4.1	The new screamer machines are just too fast on the parallel ports .	St
1.4.2	I did have a few clients that would never say die and the fix was to install a PCI LPT card .	St
1.4.3	The timing appears to be the older centronics speed then .	St
1.4.4	But it cost as much as a new USB scanner !	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	Sorry for the delay getting back to you Bob .	St
1.5.2	As a matter of fact I have already done that with a PCI card from SIIG with identical results .	St
1.5.3	I already have another scanner , not a USB but on a parallel port ( shared with another printer ) .	St
1.5.4	It works fine on LPT1 ( have n't tried it on the SIIG card ( LPT2 ) ) .	St
1.5.5	What I like about this scanner ( and I suspect that any new scanner would be different ) is that its a sheet feed , which scans a page in seconds and I am able to feed additional sheets in which is especially handy when I am sending a multi-page fax .	St
1.5.6	The flatbed scanner takes several minutes per page and can only do one page at a time .	St
1.5.7	A multi-page fax takes too long and must be saved as multiple winfax attachments to send as a fax .	St
1.5.8	Rich	St
