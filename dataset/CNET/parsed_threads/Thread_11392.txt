<s> By building your own you can pick and choose. </s>
<s> I've see new hard drives with a Tera-byte of space. </s>

<s> I found a case, slipped a drive in and it's years old. </s>
<s> I wonder if the units you buy would be as good since I can assure my case has a fan. </s>

<s> First by manufacturer: Seagate who just acquired Maxtor. </s>
<s> Seagate has newest high density technology, flash memory and reputation. </s>
<s> If you have a LAN, I'd make sure that the drive had a 10/100 Mbps ethernet interface as well as a USB 2.0 interface. </s>
<s> Then it can have it's own IP address and web server to function as a network attached storage for backups and large file storage. </s>
<s> By waiting for sales and sending in those rebates, I've picked up a couple 250-gigabyte Acomdata hard drives from a chain computer store for $100 each. </s>
<s> They're available in USB, Firewire and both. </s>
<s> I don't stack them because they generate a bit of heat. </s>
<s> But over nine months they've been solidly reliable. </s>
<s> You just have to remember to shut down the USB 'safely remove hardware' function before hitting the on-off switch. </s>
<s> I would definitely consider an external hard drive with more than 100 gigabytes because it won't cost you a lot more and you'll be surprised how fast you'll get spoiled with all that extra elbow room. </s>
<s> I use a Buffalo Linkstation on my wireless network. </s>
<s> What a dream for backing up and accessing files. </s>
<s> Then, few files are kept on my hard drive, making fresh installs much easier. </s>
<s> I even include application setup files on the Linkstation if I need them. </s>
<s> My NAS is nice but on the 100 megabit ethernet is still annoyingly slow. </s>
<s> Can't wait to see when we get this LAN to 1Gb. </s>

<s> I just picked up a Western Digital My Book 160g for $80 on sale at Best Buy. </s>
<s> If you are only looking at a 100gigs - just buy two of these cheap drives, and take one to your office or leave it at a friend's house. </s>
<s> Keep another one on hand for regular backups, but squirrel away another copy of your most important files somewhere else (your pictures, your music library, your tax records etc.) </s>
<s> You can lose your digital data a couple of different ways: Your hard drive dies. </s>
<s> You have a fire, flood or some other calamity like that. </s>
<s> Lightening hits the power pole near your house and fries everything electronic connected to the grid in your house. </s>
<s> You get robbed. </s>
<s> Only in the first of these scenarios does having a backup HDD sitting on your desk and somehow connected to your computer or home network help you out. </s>
<s> I'm using a CoolMax case with firewire connection for my Maxtor 300gig SATA 1 harddrive. </s>
<s> It only runs about half the speed of my internal Sata 1 drives, but is fast enough for video editing, which is what I wanted. </s>
<s> This case also has USB 2.0 and SATA connections which I haven't tried. </s>
<s> Do go for more than 100gigs. </s>
<s> With the price of HDs as low as they are today and with backup needs growing exponentially every year, you won't regret having the extra space. </s>
<s> If you buy a pre-made external drive, any major mfr will be good -- Maxtor, Western Digital, etc. </s>
<s> The differences are so subtle in consumer-grade products, it's splitting hairs to compare them. </s>
<s> If you make your own by buying a hard drive and a separate enclosure, be careful. </s>
<s> #1, make sure the enclosure has a fan if the drive will be on for more than several hours at a time. </s>
<s> #2, make sure the hard drive is designed for back-up. </s>
<s> Many drives are not built to handle sudden, mass bursts of data on a regular basis as most hard drives read and write small amounts. </s>
<s> Either way you go, I'd definitely recommend getting some type of network connectivity if you happen to be running a home network. </s>
<s> Also, go bigger than 100gb -- that's chump change these days and you can get a 250gb for so little. </s>
<s> Alternatively, you could always switch to Mac and subscribe to iDisk. </s>
<s> I went to a major computer store recently looking for an external HD for my tablet PC. </s>
<s> Although I could not get a salesperson's attention, 2 fellow customers steered me to LaCie external hard drives. </s>
<s> Both gentlemen were IT director's for their companies. </s>
<s> The first man, &quot;Dave,&quot; said he had &quot;a few dozen&quot; Lacies for his company's it system. </s>
<s> Dave said thatit performs really well and that he has not had any trouble. </s>
<s> Since he knew I was not a techie, he assured me it would be very easy to use. </s>
<s> After Dave walked away--and as I remained to compare prices with other brands--a totally different customer came up and noticed the Lacie box in my hand. </s>
<s> He assured me I would be pleased with my purchase. </s>
<s> He not only buys them for his work, he also uses them at home. </s>
<s> &quot;Dont bother comparing prices,&quot; he tells me, &quot;it's a good deal. </s>
<s> You'll be happy you got it.&quot;&quot; So far, the have both been right; it is easy to use, and I am happy with my purchase. </s>
<s> I got the Lacie 250GB USB 2.0 hard drive. </s>
<s> (I had expected to get a 100GB, originally, but the 2nd guy assured me it would fill up quick1y with pictures & videos.) </s>
<s> It's simple to set up, runs super-quiet but quickly, and is easy on the eye. </s>
<s> Brushed metal, designed by F.A Porsche. </s>
<s> Love those nice, clean lines--no clutter or dust-collecting contours. </s>
<s> And it is small, keeping me mobile. </s>
<s> It comes with an AC Power Adapter, an item for which similarly priced competitors charged extra! </s>
<s> It only uses one USB port--others required 2. </s>
<s> Even though it was easy to install & use, it seems more advanced user's can customize its use. </s>
<s> This I deduce from reading the PDF users manual that was on the installation CD. </s>
<s> I just bought a Western Digital My Book 160 GB Hard-Drive. </s>
<s> It's awesome even thought it comes in FAT32 format as a default. </s>
<s> I'm still debating wheather or not to change it NTFS or leave it as is. </s>
<s> Anywho it is awesome just plug it in and let it rip. </s>
<s> I got it on sale from Best Buy for 90 bucks.I would recommend it highly. </s>
<s> ain't gonna go networking so no need for advanced stuff. </s>
<s> wonder if it's safe to do what you rcmnd. </s>
<s> also, is it dfclt? </s>
