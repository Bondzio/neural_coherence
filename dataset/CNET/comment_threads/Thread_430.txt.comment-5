Ray: Try some WD-40 on the micro switches just inside the flip door.
the one on the right looking in is the write protect, and the one on the left is the media sensor switch.
What i have found in many cases is that those switches get gummy from the atmosphere and do not actuate properly when you insert a floppy, particularly, the media sensor.
If this stays down in a stuck position, the drive thinks it has a 720 disk, but your command has told it that it was a 1.44, therefore you may get a message &quot;cannot read, disk not formatted etc.&quot; A little WD-40 on the finger nubs with working a disk in and out frees up these switches, and often puts the drive back in service.
Its worth a try, I fixed one this past weekend for a friend.
