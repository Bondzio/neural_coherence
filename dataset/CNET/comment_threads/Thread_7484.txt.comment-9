If you are running a gigabit system (hardwire) 10/100/100 as opposed to 10/100, that is where the CAT 6 instead of cat 5 comes in, faster transfer rate, that is also where (hardwired) the gigabit (10/100/1000) hardware comes in, nic cards for desktops more specifically.
And again, depending on upload/download rates from server.
Wireless is another story dual band n gigabit router and n antennae for wireless units, it can go on and on.
Gaming and streaming wirelessly can be a bit iffy, lots of variables, hardwire is generally a bit more reliable.
