1.1.1	can someone suggest products that are similar to Apple's airport express?	Ques
1.1.2	I am looking for a compact device that would boost/extend my wifi using the same SSID/dhcp.	St
1.1.3	it'd great if anyone can suggest a dlink product - already have a dlink adsl modem & wifi router print server.	St

1.1.5	thanks!	St

1.3.1	hmm.. so evry wifi extender/booster device means a different SSID, rite?	St
1.3.2	that means, my wifi client (eg: laptop) would theoritically discover multiple wifi networks/ssid in the house - obviously, the upstream one would appear weaker than the downstream one... hmm!	St
1.3.3	by the way, should the wifi booster be placed in an area with strong signal to extend the coverage or can it be placed some place where the signal is already weak?	St
1.4.1	how do i access #18 on 'this forum's sticky'?	St
