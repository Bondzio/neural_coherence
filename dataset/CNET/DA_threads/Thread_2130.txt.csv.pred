1.1.1	Alright , so I am waiting for black friday to buy all ( most ) of my pc components to build a new pc .	St
1.1.2	This is the first pc I have ever built but my dad is an electrical engineer , which will hopefully help .	St

1.1.4	1.Budget : Currently the build up there is & lt ; $ 500 so trying to keep it that way .	St
1.1.5	2.Brands : No preference .	St
1.1.6	3.Multitasking : Not ridiculous amounts but I want to be able to .	St
1.1.7	4.Gaming : I actually never game but I definitely want to be able to ( and I will try it for awhile ) 5.Calculations : No 6.Overclocking : I do n't want to over clock but it would be nice if I had the option ( currently the mobo and processor are said to be oc compatible .	St

1.1.9	Ive never filled a computer to 80gb but there are cheap hds that have way more ... so whatever .	St
1.1.10	8.Legacy Support : No , this is a completely new build .	St
1.1.11	9.Operating System : Do you want Windows XP or Vista , or Linux compatibility ?	Ques
1.1.12	All of them 10.Case : I 'm not educated enough to know what type of case I want .	St
1.1.13	11.Accessories : Already got'em .	St
1.1.14	12.Recycled Components : If anything , just hd .	St

1.2.1	It 's not free so tack 100 to 200 on the list so that leaves us 400 to build a machine to run Crysis .	St
1.2.2	We know that we 'll want a dual core CPU and 2GB RAM so that 's a bare minimum .	St
1.2.3	Now blow the rest of the budget on the video card from this list - & gt ; http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card,2064.html Please get as much video card as you can as Cysis is going to use it all .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	you can OC just about anything if you want to consider overclocking your system , have someone help or get components that allow you to reap the benefits of overclocking without much trouble .	St

1.3.3	On AMD 's side we have the 5000+ and 5400+ Black Editions , the adjustable multiplier helps , bump it up and you can get 3.2 w/out voltage increases , if you need more , set multiplier to 15 and play with the FSB and vcore .	St

1.9.5	What do you think ?	Ques
1.9.6	Thanks !	St
1.10.1	do n't put rebates in your budget .	St
1.10.2	that ram costs $ 40 for 2gb .	St
1.10.3	if you 've only got $ 500 to spend , do n't spend $ 600 thinking you 'll get the $ 100 back in rebates .	St
1.10.4	some rebate clearance houses are on shaky ground .	St
1.10.5	http : //www.hardocp.com/article.html ? art=MTU4NCwsLGhlbnRodXNpYXN0 the ram i suggested is $ 48 for 4gb .	St
1.10.6	some games can consume 2gb on their own , so getting just 2gb is being very short-sighted .	St
1.10.7	also , you 're paying $ 100 for a case+fan+power rather supply than $ 75 sonata iii which includes all three .	St
1.10.8	if you like the other case , fine , but you say you do n't want to try to keep the build to $ 500 so why spend extra money if you do n't have to .	Sug
1.10.9	likewise , what features are on your $ 110 mobo that the $ 80 mobo lacks ?	Ques
1.10.10	and you 've said that you want to be able to play crysis .	St
1.10.11	but you 're trying to cheap out on the video card .	St
1.10.12	look at the benchmarks ... a 9600gt will struggle in crysis .	St
1.11.1	never go over 5400+ on Athlon X2 's Processor : AMD Athlon X2 5000+ BE Overclock to 3.2 and leave it there or AMD Athlon X2 5400+ X2 , Overclock to 3.5 ( hint , a multiplier only OC wo n't get you that far , play with fsb and multiplier combos )	St
1.12.1	I trust rebates , I would n't be surprised in waiting on $ 300+ in rebates , I do n't mind I am actually going to go for $ 80 case+powersupply , screw the fan .	St
1.12.2	Same case , this psu- http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16817341010 ( Combo deal makes it $ 50 ) Can you suggest me a better mobo ?	Ques
1.12.3	I picked it b/c of the good rating .	St
1.12.4	Thanks	Polite
