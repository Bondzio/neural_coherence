Existing processor is most likely an A1400AMS3C type on a Keystone Motherboard #2514316. Processor is 1400 MHz with 266 MHz data bus DDR. System runs Windows ME with 128MB 133MHz SDRAM expandable. I am really just looking for a suitable replacement - not an upgrade or anyhting. Swap out the old for a working one. I started looking ( new egg etc. ) just want to speed up the process. Thanks
