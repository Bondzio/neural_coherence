12086	0	142647	1598777	NR	geneg	12/12/05 8:44 PM	1.13442024E12	I can only startup in safe mode after installing printer	operating system is XP home edition and the printer is a Lexmark X73. i've loaded software on a new drive after having problems with an old one. before having problems with the drive, the printer in question worked fine. i have tried to install the printer using 2 methods. one is to use the disk provided with the printer. the other is to use a downloaded install procedure from Lexmark. after installing, using either method, i can print. my problem is that after a shutdown/startup, i can only restart in safe mode and restore to a time before the printer was installed. I've been sending emails back and forth to lexmark for three weeks with no useful suggestions. does anyone have a suggestion besides buying a new printer which i'm about to do. thanks in advance, geneg
