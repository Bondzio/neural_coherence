8825	0	400346	3334066	NR	RyanH	7/5/10 1:39 PM	1.27833714E12	Connecting Mac to TV	I have a MacBook 2.4 GHz intel Core Duo 2GB Ram running 10.6.2 I have connected it to my new Sony Bravia KDL-26S55 TV using a standard cable with an Apple adaptor, to watch streamed tv content from the BBC iPlayer (British tv). I use a wi-fi link to connect to my broadband. It plays ok except that there are frequent 4-5 second breaks when the tv screen says 'no signal 1024 X 768' but the content continues playing on the Mac screen, then it all starts to work again. Any suggestions how I can resolve this? Thanks

Your owners manual may also mention other video resolutions that it will support. You need to try and match the video resolution output of your computer to what the TV will best accept. You can choose the best video output by going to System Preferences &gt; Hardware &gt; Displays ... then select the resolution best handled by your TV.
