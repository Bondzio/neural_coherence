1.1.1	Unable to install Epson R280 on Lion.	St
1.1.2	Drivers don't seem to be available from Apple or Epson websites.	St
1.1.3	Need this printer to print labels deirectly onto CD and DVD printable discs.	St
1.1.4	Any insight/guidance/tips?	St
1.2.1	http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/supportLionDetails.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=yes&oid=89901#stage1 P	St
1.3.1	mrmacfixit, Thanks for the assistance.	St
1.3.2	The problem is that the Epson Lion setup advisor (to which you linked) directs you to install the printer through 'System Preferences...Add Printer...' process.	St
1.3.3	SysPref then looks for the printer software, then advises 'software unavailable....check manufacturer website, etc'.	St
1.3.4	It winds up being an endless loop.	St
1.3.5	I find it hard to believe that a company like Epson would fail to keep its fairly recent products current with an OS as widely used as OSX 10.7.	St
1.3.6	But it appears that that may be the case.	St
1.3.7	Any other ideas/recommendations would be gratefully appreciated.	St
1.4.1	or any of the other Generic drivers would work.	St
1.4.2	Once Add Printer finds the printer, do you have an option of select a driver yourself?	St
1.4.3	P	St
1.5.1	I don't think so, but I'll check when I get home tomorrow.	St
1.5.2	I'll see if they allow independent search and install for drivers.	St
1.6.1	or Gimp Print now is a package.	St
1.6.2	I would go for it.	St
1.6.3	The best driver suite, IMHO.	St
