An external drive consists of an enclosure and the drive itself that you put in, connect and fasten with a few screws.
Both can be gone south.
If it's the enclosure, you can mount the drive in a new one and everything will be fine.
If it's the disk, you'll have to buy a new disk and put in in the old enclosure or buy a new set.
You can only find out by trying.
If you don't feel confident to do it yourself, a visit to a nearby computershop might be useful.
They'll be happy to check it for you provided you buy the replacement with them.
