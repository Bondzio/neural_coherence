1.3.2	Sure a double layer is not needed for that file size, but since they are getting cheap, Im planning to get them unless there are bigger problems with them.	St

1.3.4	Adolfo	St
1.4.1	But I expect you to find that sending a double layer to friends and family to result in a better than 50% reduction in who can play it in their DVD players.	St
1.4.2	Just my advice.	St
1.4.3	Buy the recorder if you want, but send out the single layer media... Bob	St
1.5.1	You need a good media (use branded one)and a very good burning software.	St

1.5.3	Just an added information.	St
