<s> Hey guys and gals, I have an MSI Radeon 6970 and the fan is unbearably loud. </s>
<s> I turn down the fan speed to deal with this, but as a result the GPU really heats up when playing games like BF3 and Skyrim. </s>
<s> I was wondering if you guys know about any good GPU fans I can replace the default one with. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Pull the card out and examine it. </s>
<s> If the bearings are shot then a visit to a computer store might provide a replacement. </s>
<s> You really answered your own question. </s>
<s> If the fan is operating as in trying to cool your gpu, then its doing its job. </s>
<s> You already noticed the reduction of fan speed doesn't help matters, thus I suspect the fan is again doing exactly its job. </s>
<s> Overall, you're whole PC needs to be cooled as the &quot;airflow&quot; isn't getting the heat out fast enough. </s>
<s> Either improve the case airflow setup or mount at least a slot card fan to directly exhaust near the gpu. </s>
<s> Replacing the gpu fan won't necessarily help as it still needs to exhaust the heat. </s>
<s> If your PC case doesn't have a &quot;side fan&quot; maybe you should think of mounting or making one. </s>
<s> Your gaming is sooner or later will defeat your current cooling efforts. </s>
<s> If once you case cooling is controlled, then the gpu fan may throttle down as it doesn't need to be high RPM all the time. </s>
<s> If you case also has an empty fan mounting port, get the required fan. </s>
<s> Make sure your case is as dust free as possible, clear vents or filters on frt. </s>
<s> panel if need be. </s>
<s> FYI- It always helps to post all details of your PC. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> If so, it is time to arrange for return since modifying would void the warranty. </s>
<s> If your machine's builder is there, talk to them about changing it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> And go to places like http://www.frozencpu.com/ for replacement cooling things. </s>

<s> Thanks, for answering my question and next time I will post more about my computer. </s>
<s> There is nothing wrong with the GPU fan that I have, the default fan is just really rubish and I am going to replace it and was seeing if you guys knew about any good ones. </s>
<s> Next time I will try to word the question better. </s>
<s> Thanks, for giving me some ideas and I will try to get all the dust out of my computer more often. </s>
<s> I built my own PC, so I can't return it. </s>
<s> Thanks, this is exactly what I need. </s>
