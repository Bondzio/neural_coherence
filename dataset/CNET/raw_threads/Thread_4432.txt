It has been replaced by the MP 510 and MP 530 (with fax). Now owning the the MP 530, and knowing what I do about the ink cartridges, the Canon is a better value than the HP. However, the HP will do a good job on photos. If cash is not a problem, and you want the best AIO without a fax look at the Canon Pixma MP960. Look at what you really want to do, neither of the ones you want will print directly on photos, only Epson's will that I know of. The HP isn't bad, but the cartridges will end up costing you more in the long run.
