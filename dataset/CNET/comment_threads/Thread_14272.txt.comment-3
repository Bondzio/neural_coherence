thanks, sorry i wasn't specific enough, I don't want to increase my virtual memory, I just want a flash drive to store music files and data files, but my concern is if the ready boost feature takes up a significant amount of space on the flash drive because I want all the space I can get for other files.
So I just wanted to know if those features could be taken out or any comparability issues I may run into..but by your post, I suppose just reformatting the flash drive will take care of any extras.....
