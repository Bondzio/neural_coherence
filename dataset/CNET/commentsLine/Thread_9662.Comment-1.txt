i own a sony vaio vgc-ra826g, currently running vista ultimate under 2gb of ram (400mhz pc3200 ddr; 4x512mb modules).
is there a bios limitation that would prevent the system from working if i were to put four 1gb 400mz pc3200 chips in?
or is it more of a physical limitation of the motherboard?
i'm also wondering if the motherboard would support a more recent cpu.
right now, it has the oem 3.4ghz pentium 4/ht.
i've asked both questions of sony but did not receive any response.
