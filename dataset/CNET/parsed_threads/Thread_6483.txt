<s> I have a MacBook and I'm trying to use the audio line-in to hear audio from my game system. </s>
<s> I use an RCA to Miniplug adapter and plug it in, I checked the audio preferences and it looks like signal is getting through, but I hear nothing from the speakers. </s>
<s> What am I missing? </s>
<s> Surely you should hook up speakers to the line-OUT (indicated by the headphone icon) Udayan. </s>
<s> Yes, my speakers are connected correctly through the line out or headphone jack. </s>
<s> My problem is with the line-in jack right next to it. </s>
<s> I've plugged my game system's audio OUT to the macbook's line IN, and I see signal in the system preferences sound window, but I don't hear any of the audio through the speakers I've plugged in. </s>
<s> Regular system sounds play just fine, and audio through programs play fine. </s>
<s> that you will need another piece of software running to process the incoming sound and push it out through the Audio Out port. </s>
<s> For example: I have a microphone connected to my Line in Port and speakers connected to the Audio out port. </s>
<s> Following your logic, I should be getting heavy feedback because the microphone is always on, as are the speakers. </s>
<s> The Mic should be picking up my voice, and all the other sounds in the room, and pushing it out of the speakers, but it doesn't. </s>
<s> Now, if I launch a sound recording app, and hit record, all the sound from the mic comes out of the speakers. </s>
<s> The Mac cannot be used as an amplifier for your Game System's sound. </s>
<s> Try putting the sound from your Game System into your Stereo Amplifier and then see what happens. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> Though I'm not sure that's exactly the case. </s>
<s> In the System Preferences, I can only choose one input source--the built in microphone, or the line in audio input. </s>
<s> I've tried adjusting the input level for the line input in AMS, but I don't notice any change, either. </s>
<s> However, the amplifier part of it might be more what's going on. </s>
<s> I suppose it doesn't exactly work like my PC's sound card line in, hehe, where it would supposedly amplify it. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help! </s>
