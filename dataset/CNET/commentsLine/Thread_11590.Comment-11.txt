i meant writing out my math as one thing and highlighting in digital textbooks as another.
writing out my math requires my authentic handwriting to prove it's my work.
i don't think it could recognize my poor handwriting anyways .
i only need to have 7 hours for one school year.
afterwards, i won't need that much.
if it halves in 2 years, then it quarters in a year.
one school year is about 2/3 of a year, and 2/3 of 1/4 is 1/6.
5/6 of 9 hours is 7.5 hours on a full charge, the samsung ativ 500t would reach 6.7% of it's usable capacity at the end of the last day of high school.
