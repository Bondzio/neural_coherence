<s> Ive done much research on both. </s>
<s> I am leaning towards emachines because of the built in tuner...can anyone tell me what brand it is and the quality? </s>
<s> If its total garbage I can get the hp. </s>
<s> Also is there the ability to add another dvd drive if you choose in the emachines? </s>
<s> I am concerned over emachines qulaity vs hp....any feedback would be appreciated. </s>
<s> i think its a bette buy. </s>
<s> as for the tv tuner, i am not sure but since gateway owns emachines, and i have an 820gm, its an Aver media or Aver tech something. </s>
<s> there is nothing wrong with hp either. </s>
<s> either way you go, you will have a good pc. </s>
<s> konny </s>
<s> You can add another drive, but itll look really weird because the front of the case is round. </s>
<s> have to buy from emachines... http://parts.emachines.com/emachines/MenuBar.asp?Category=Desktop+Parts&Sub_category=CDROM%2FCDRW </s>
