PC mfg ... with the series and model number you have?
If I understand correctly, you have 1GB of system RAM with 128MBs used for video RAM which is minimally sufficient to run your PC efficiently.
Adding more system RAM ... for a total of 2GB or 4GB would make the system run significantly better.
What are you using the PC for ?
If games, you really need a distinct (vice integrated) video card with it's own RAM.
