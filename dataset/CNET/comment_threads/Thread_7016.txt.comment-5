Install the usual remote access software (gotomypc, VNC) and network, password, secure as needed.
As presented it's a mess.
I can't tell what &quot;content&quot; is.
It could be some HTML pages, maybe it's the usual &quot;I want to access my PC from home&quot; or something else.
What's clear so far is that the solution is not going to happen given the current skill set.
