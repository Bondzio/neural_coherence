<s> Hey all, I have (3) 500GB Hard drives. </s>
<s> I am trying to find a SATA Controller card that supports Raid 0 (stripping) with a hotspare. </s>
<s> If i remember correctly this is Raid 5. </s>
<s> Can anyone here reccomend a card that will do this. </s>
<s> I can't seem to find one out there. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com/2004/06/25/cheap_and_reliable_raid_5_storage_compared/page2.html Fast forward to today and the story hasn't changed much. </s>
<s> Still the same name and the article covers it all. </s>
<s> awesome! </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> By reading some of the articles, it looks like Raid 5 does support 3 disks. </s>
<s> I was worried that I would need a minimum of 4. </s>
<s> Now I'm going to do some digging and see what one i should buy. </s>
<s> They tested a few but Im still not quite sure if all of the controllers out there support only 3 drives for raid 5. </s>
<s> Only reason im worried is because the controller thats built onto my mother board doesnt support 3; you have to use 4 drives. </s>
