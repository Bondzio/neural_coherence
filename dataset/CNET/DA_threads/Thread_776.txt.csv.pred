1.1.4	This is as far as I've gotten.	St
1.1.5	Please be kind	St
1.2.1	And the first GPU (video card) I checked noted over 400 Watt power supply so you are pressing your luck there.	St
1.2.2	As to which video card, for the past few years I still like this list updated almost every month.	St
1.2.3	Read and pick from http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/radeon-geforce-price,2323.html Toms did motherboard comparisons a few times and found less than 2 percent variation in benchmarks when using same settings for RAM, same GPU, etc.	St
1.2.4	Go with the board that people review nicely (see newegg.com comments.)	St
