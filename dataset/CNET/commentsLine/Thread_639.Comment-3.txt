i will check on the bios version and update if i need to.
i will try the 80 wire cable.
is this a fix?
on top of the wd 8gb drive (jumpered as slave) there is a note about if used with a 2gb drive a special jumper settings maybe needed and the diagram shows an additional jumper placed on the pins beside the slave pins.
ill get the drive model numbers and see if wd has any info on this.
