<s> I have a new DVD writer that burns dual layer DVDs with the proper disks. </s>
<s> Thing is, will any other DVD drive read a dual layer disk burned on this drive, as the ones on my other computers? </s>
<s> Or must it only be one of the new dual layer drives? </s>
<s> Thanks, Dan </s>
<s> Many commercial DVDs are already dual layer. </s>
<s> But recordable dual layer while fine on most drives is expected not to work on many DVD players connected to TVs. </s>
<s> Widely discussed so I'll skimp on why. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Excellent. </s>
<s> I'm concerned with backing up primarily. </s>
<s> I'm a photograper and generate gigabytes of digital photo files. </s>
<s> I have a separate mirror hard drive that I keep up to date, but also like to do periodic incremental updates on disc. </s>
<s> The most recent took 12 DVDs, so I thought the dual layer might be a more practical answer, but it wouldn't work if regular DVD drives couldn't read the dual layer discs. </s>
<s> Thanks very much, Dan </s>
<s> Seems to me that 12 DVDs is less than 60 GB; a lot of DVDs but only equal to a small hard drive. </s>
<s> If it was me, I'd get a very small hard drive - a local electronics store recently had the Western Digital 200 GB hard drives on sale for $59. </s>
<s> Then I'd spend another $45 for a kit to convert the Hard drive into an external USB drive. </s>
<s> For about $100, you'd get MUCH more storage and could have all your files appear in Windows Explorer in a single view (making files easier to see/find). </s>
<s> In addition, this would sooner or later be cheaper than buying all those DVDs, which could only be used once. </s>
<s> Some of the external hard drive kits even have Fire Wire connections in addition to USB. </s>
