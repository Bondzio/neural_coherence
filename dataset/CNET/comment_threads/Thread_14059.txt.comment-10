Bob; I wasn't aware of any Win XP Home limitation on hard drive size (My Win XP-equipped laptops' drives have all been less than 120GB.)
For my last desktop, a Win98SE machine, I purposely stayed at 120MB for a replacement drive but I had thought that the Windows XP Service Packs 1 & 2 took care of that.
( http://www.48bitlba.com/winxp.htm seems to imply that.)
Or are you saying that geehon1999 has a pre-Service Pack edition of XP?
