Your post neglects information such as how the old drive was setup.
Some use Partition Magic, EZDrive or other in some other machine and that makes the drive non-portable to another machine.
If the unit was a DOS format, boot a DOS diskette and type DIR C: when that's the only drive in the system.
What happens?
