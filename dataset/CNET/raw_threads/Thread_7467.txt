The place in the case where it looks like it's meant to go &quot;underneath the floppy and cd drives&quot; there are two metal walls with lots of big oval shaped holes, but no places for screws to fit and the open sides face both the case doors. The case didn't include any manuals or instructions and the people on the Spire website refuse to even respond to my emails. If anyone can shed some light on my problem I would be very thankful.
