Its a brand new motherboard, I have never touched any of the components on ir and I always wear an anti static wrist band.
The sata-IDE convertors are broken because they are cheap ones from hong kong, and even the ones that do &quot;work&quot; dont actually convert sata-IDE, so I simply removed them all.
