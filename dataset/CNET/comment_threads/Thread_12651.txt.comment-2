Your wifi and the internet is a &quot;network&quot; so your request fails on the gitgo.
However, we often turn on WEP, WPA and even MAC filtering to harden the home network.
In answer to &quot;can other people steal file from me?&quot; the answer is very likely.
Do a little research about the EVIL TWIN problem of wifi hotspots and you quickly learn to distrust unknown spots.
