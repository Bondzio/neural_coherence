first, let me say that i tried to be an early adopter of the technology.
i purchased a system 4 years ago and thought an ssd would be the way to go.
after multiple drive failures, i switched back to a conventional hard drive.
on all occasions, i received replacement ssd drives and had to reload the operating system and other programs i had.
i had always backed up my personal files and documents on a raid-enabled conventional drive.
it was during the time i was using vista but i don't think that had anything to do with it as many others i know have used vista without any problems.
after giving up on ssd drives, i received a regular hard drive from the computer manufacturer and installed it as well as upgraded to windows 7 at the same time.
i have been happy since then.
i have seen the newer drives and lower prices but have shied away due to my past experiences.
