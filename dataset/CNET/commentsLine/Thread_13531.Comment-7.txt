jim, first let me agree with bob, there is no such thing as secure wireless access.
second, it also isn't near as difficult as the previous poster makes it.
here in the atlanta area, almost every doctor i or my family have had to visit in the last year or so have wifi and are using it successfully.
let me make this suggestion, contact some other doctor's offices in your area and ask their office manager if they use wifi and who they recommend.
i think you will be pleasantly surprised by their responses and help.
as to the &quot;getting ripped off&quot; problem, while that may be a legitimate issue, the dallas area has a great pc users group.
you might want to also contact them and see what type of expertise they have and can recommend.
the biggest issue is don't get frustrated or overwhelmed by the problem.
it has been solved and does work, so you just need to concentrate on making the right choices for your business.
and also, thanks for taking care of the kids out in the dallas area.
these days, being a doctor, means a lot more than people give credit for.
good luck and please let us know how you make out or if you have any other questions.
