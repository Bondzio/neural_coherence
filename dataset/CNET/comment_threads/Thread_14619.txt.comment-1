what is the average life span of a PC?I'm at #3 since I started about six years ago and the one I have at present,about 17 months old,is starting to act up.I am no finaciado with computers;the last one died completely now this one may be going the same way.would it be wise to think about putting in a new mother board (not by me,of course!)
or a hard drive?
