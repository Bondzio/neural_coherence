<s> My work PC died quietly in the night. </s>
<s> (PS, MOBO, CPU) but the harddrive functions. </s>
<s> I have reports on this drive that are due yesterday. </s>
<s> Since I'm the IT department, I thought I would swap the drive into a working computer that I have at home. </s>
<s> Both computers are XP Pro. </s>
<s> The computer boots, &quot;the windows did not start normally&quot; screen comes up-- and no matter what option I choose it freezes and will not boot into safe mode. </s>
<s> I'm thinking it's a driver issue due to the old computer being Intel based and the New one is AMD based. </s>
<s> Otherwise I'm dead in the water until we replace my work computer. </s>
<s> Here's my question: Should I do a re-install of Windows Xp? </s>
<s> What is my danger of losing data? </s>
<s> Are there any better ideas than what I am doing? </s>
<s> Any input is appreciated. </s>
<s> New machine is a SOYO MOBO with a 1.8GHZ AMD (athalon?) </s>
<s> chip, 680+ MB ram. </s>
<s> It worked fine with the previous harddrive (a Seagate 40GB). </s>
<s> The new drive is a WD 80 GB, already loaded with XP Pro. </s>
<s> to being put into a new [diffetrent] system. </s>
<s> XP has stored data on all of the original and that was made the only acceptable to it when you activated it. </s>
<s> If the switch were to be permanent MS MIGHT allow uopu to make the exchange and give you the info on how to re validate it in the new system. </s>
<s> Doubt if your reason will suffice. </s>
<s> Taking from a commercial company's computer to a home computer will go over like a lead baloon. </s>
<s> I'm just offering up one of my old computers as a loaner to shorten the time I'm without a work Pc. </s>
<s> I work for a non-profit and it could be over a month before I see parts to repair the old computer at work. </s>
<s> We have several unused legal Windows XP PRO liscences (Microsoft is very generous to non-profits.) </s>
<s> -- this is not the issue. </s>
<s> (Although it is my understanding the XP PRO is supposed to allow you to make 4 major hardware changes before it asks you to re-activate.) </s>
<s> I've done this before -- I'm just concerned about data loss. </s>
<s> I'm starting to think it may be better to piggy-back this drive on the drive that was orginally in the AMD computer. </s>
<s> (which I really don't want to do...) And I agree, taking a company harddrive for home use would go over like a lead ballon -- but that's not what I'm doing here. </s>
<s> Thanks for the input. </s>
<s> I ended up piggy-baking the company drive onto one of my drives. </s>
<s> Not my first choice but data-integrity was vital in this case. </s>
<s> That company drive has been backed up to a fare-thee-well now. </s>
<s> LOL However, if anyone else should have this problem, you can reinstall Xp as a repair install and it will update the proper drivers to the new Pc the harddrive is in. </s>
<s> You will need your CD Key. </s>
<s> Activation is another story, but Microsoft is pretty decent about most diasters. </s>
