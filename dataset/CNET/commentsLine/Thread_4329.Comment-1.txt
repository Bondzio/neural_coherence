it's for a new desktop, and the phone line with dsl coming out of it is pretty far around the house, lots of walls in the middle.
if i was going to run a cable, i'd need 200+ ft of cable (i think, very rough estimate).
i know that the general creed is that a hardwire is always stronger than wifi, but at that kind of distance, would the latency in transferring signal over that much wiring justify wifi to just save the time?
i'd get pretty good reception, i already have wifi running for an xbox360 in that room.
