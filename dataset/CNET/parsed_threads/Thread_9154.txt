<s> I'm in the process of purchasing a new desktop. </s>
<s> During a scouting trip to Best Buy I was told that an Athlon 64 X2 equipped system would be well suited for my gaming. </s>
<s> I decided to look the processor up on the internet before pulling the trigger. </s>
<s> When I got online I started reading great things about AMD's combination of price/performance, I was naturally intrigued. </s>
<s> I was also puzzled as AMD's chips were performing better yet clocking (sometimes significantly lower) than Intel's competition. </s>
<s> Now, during my research I have found that the Dual Core processors will not greatly increase my systems performance initally, however, once dual threaded software begins appearing it will help, obviously. </s>
<s> The system I am looking at has an Athlon 64 X2 3800. </s>
<s> The 3800 is clocked well below (at 2.0 or 2.2 GHz I believe) similarly priced computers equipped with Intel based 3.0 GHz chips. </s>
<s> If someone could be so kind as to explain to me why AMD processors consistently perform so much better in game benchmarks, even though the games are not 64-bit capable, than Intels with numerically higher GHz ratings I would be very appreciative. </s>
<s> Even though AMD processors run at lower clock speed than Intel chips thay can out perform them because they do more work per clock cycle. </s>
<s> It's kind of like having two people with wheelbarrows. </s>
<s> The one guy might not move as fast, but has a bigger wheelbarrow. </s>
<s> He can move more in 2 trips than the other guy can in 3 or 4 trips. </s>
<s> The other reason for the great performance of AMD chips is that the memory controller is right on the CPU. </s>
<s> This is good because the CPU can directly acess the memory rather than going through the Front Side Bus (FSB) like an Intel processor. </s>
<s> When it comes to Intel alot of people have considered the FSB to be a major bottle neck for a few years. </s>
<s> Also Intel dual core chips have to use the FSB for the two CPU cores to talk to each other. </s>
<s> AMD chips use a direct commect architecture that allow the cores to communicate DIRECTLY. </s>
<s> And as far as the 64 bit thing, using a 32 bit or 64 bit system usually turns out the same benchmarks. </s>
<s> The only real performance advantage is being able to address more memory. </s>
<s> 64 bit won't be mainstream for another year or two, but it's good to have the capability when the time comes. </s>
<s> low revving, high torque American muscle cars and high revving, low torque imports. </s>
<s> An American made V8 push rod engine can't rev as high as an import 4 cylinder overhead cam engine but it makes up for it in shear brute force. </s>
<s> Personally, most of the time, I'd rather have the more efficient high revving four cylinder. </s>
<s> That's why I build my SLI rig around an Intel CPU. </s>
<s> But there's times when I like a lot of brute force. </s>
<s> That's why I have a couple AMD systems. </s>
<s> Thanks for the replies, great analogies. </s>
<s> I'm understanding the difference now. </s>
<s> Would someone please give me a rough idea as to what an AMD would clock equivalent to? </s>
<s> ie: 2.0 AMD-2.8 Intel? </s>
<s> The AMD model numbers all the way up to 4000+ (excluding the dual core 3800+) are supposed to represent what the comparable clock speed and performance on an Intel processor is. </s>
<s> For instance Athlon 64 3000+ ~ Intel P4 3.0 Ghz Athlon 64 3700+ ~ Intel P4 3.7 Ghz Athlon 64 4000+ ~ Intel doesn't make a 4.0 Ghz processor The 3800+, 4200+, 4400+, 4600+, 4800+ are all dual core and hard to directly compare with Intel models with out reading some reviews and benchmarks. </s>
<s> AMD chips are very good, they perform well, run cooler, and are usually less expensive. </s>
<s> equal to a P4 2.6 to 2.8Gh. </s>
<s> An Athlon XP 3200+ is roughly equal to a P4 3Gh as far as power is concerned. </s>
<s> The &quot;speed&quot; is self explanatory. </s>
<s> 2.0 and 2.2Gh, respectively. </s>
<s> Make all the comparisons you wish. </s>
<s> Knock yourself out: http://www23.tomshardware.com/index.html </s>
<s> all. </s>
<s> It told me my P4 630 is equal to an Athlon 64 FX-53. </s>
<s> Unfortunately my Athlon XP 3200+ based system only equals a P4 2.4Gh. </s>
<s> -DIVX 5.2 - encoding time- Athlon 64 FX-53 = 2.00 min. </s>
<s> P4 630 = 2.03 P4 2.4Gh = 2.30 Athlon XP 3200+ = 2.34 </s>
<s> As far as games are concerned, Athlon 64 chips blow Intel out of the water. </s>
<s> The FX versions are always near the top of the chart when games are selected. </s>
<s> Non-game tests, they don't do as well. </s>
<s> The closest an Intel chip comes to an AMD on Doom 3, the first selectable game, is 4th spot below. </s>
<s> 3rd spot- Ahtlon FX-53 = 94.70 fps 4th spot -Intel P4 EE 3.72Gh = 92.90 fps! </s>
<s> Time to start planning for an Athlon 64 based system. </s>
<s> I updated my &quot;Want-it&quot; list! </s>
<s> Do you see the trouble you cause for being so helpful...LOL </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Thanks for the chart. </s>
<s> Very helpful. </s>
<s> My one last question before I let this thread die is: does anyone know if the dual-core processors clock speed (2.0 for the 3800 I'm investigating) is the speed of both cores combined or the speed of each individual core? </s>
<s> i.e. </s>
<s> Does each one have 1.0 GHz? </s>
<s> Thanks again to everyone who replied. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
