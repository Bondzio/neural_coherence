This is a great monitor, however, if you live in the States, you should be prepared to spend about $1500.00 to get one because you must buy it as part of a computer package.
I approached HP about buying one and was told that they could not help me.
It seems strange for them to be so unhelpful, but nobody (and I talked to at least 6 people) could tell me where to buy one of these.
It is available as a stand alone product in Canada www.futureshop.com.
I was just about to give up when I found one on eBay.
I love it and would by a couple more if they were available here.
