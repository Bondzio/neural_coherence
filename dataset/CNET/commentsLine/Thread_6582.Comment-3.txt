could use a memory boost... they all love ram.
add a 1gb stick (probably giving you 1.25gb) and you should see the vaio really perk up.
also, copy as many data/work files from your laptop hd to the external hd, defrag, and set a fixed page file of about 1gb.
then copy your stuff back to the laptop hd.
that could speed you up also.
