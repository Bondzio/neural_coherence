normally, one can change the &quot;region&quot; on a dvd drive to play dvd videos a maximum 5 times.
my question is, what count as a &quot;time&quot; ?
for example if i change the original 1 to 2, then to 3 then back to 1, that be 3 times.(?)
if i change from 1 to 2 then back to 1 again, would that be 2 times or 1 time ?
i.e.
does returning to the last change count ?
thanks.
christy.
