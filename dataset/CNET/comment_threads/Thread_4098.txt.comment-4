Since we can't format a drive unless it has a partition I'd like to know how you stored data on a drive without a partition!
I bet you meant there is one partition?
And just fixed an ESATA today.
The owner didn't know the external needed a power connection too.
They had some case and the SATA all right.
The clue was the drive didn't spin.
