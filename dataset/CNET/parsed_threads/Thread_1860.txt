<s> I learned from HP tech support one call, that all HP printers have the drum as part of the toner cartridge (meaning that you don't ever have to shell out $150 for a drum, it gets replaced automatically). </s>
<s> But how about other brands? </s>
<s> Is this the way it is with all laser printers now, or do some manufacturers still make printers with drums that need replacing? </s>
<s> There are pros and cons for either system. </s>
<s> Just like in printers that just print heads or not. </s>
<s> At 150 for a drum I can only guess this is a printer over 150 bucks new. </s>
<s> All drums need replacement some day but the HP and Canon design has you paying a bit more each change versus toner only systems. </s>
<s> I can't guess why I would be concerned here but the drum and toner system keeps the machine in very near new condition. </s>

<s> The only laser printer I've ever had that had a separate drum was a Brother. </s>
<s> In other brands the toner and drum are packaged together so when you replace one, you replace both. </s>
<s> There are kits you can buy to replace just the toner, but there, but you have to buy them from a different company from the printer manufacturers. </s>
<s> along the way, either. </s>
<s> HP toner costs $70 on amazon; I get it now for $10 from aftermarket sellers. </s>
<s> So I'm definitely going to go with a laser that (1) allows me to use third-party ink, and (2) has the drum in the toner cartridge. </s>
<s> No offense, but I clicked on &quot;Best Answer&quot; when I meant to hit &quot;Reply&quot; to your post. </s>
<s> Is there a way to UNmark a response as Best Answer? </s>
<s> I'd prefer not to close off discussion, and folks might think there's no use in posting in a thread that has already been marked as answered. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Even the forum gods could not change that. </s>
<s> I can delete my reply if you wish. </s>

<s> The only reason why I'd pick a Brother would be saving $50 or so over an HP (the cheapest Brothers are at least that much cheaper than the cheapest HP lasers), but that of course is left in the dust by the expense of at least 3 drums over the life of the printer. </s>
<s> Thanks for letting me know about the others, tho. </s>
<s> I've never used a non-HP printer, so I had no idea that (most of) the others didn't make you replace the drum as well. </s>
