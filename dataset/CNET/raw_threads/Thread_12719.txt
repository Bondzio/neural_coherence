If you want a USB device to in effect amplify the signal to your internal wireless card I have not see such a device. To be truly &quot;Passive&quot; you would have to hook a antenna directly to the internal wireless card. You have 2 options. You can use what is called a signal extender to amplify and repeat the signal or you can use a USB based card that allows you to attach external antenna. Some signal repeaters also can take external antenna. All depends if you must have it USB connected or you can tolerate a second box. The extenders are a little easier to get a store if that is a consideration.
