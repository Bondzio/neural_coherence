what type of internet service: cable, dsl, edge, evdo other?
if cable/dsl what modem and/or router model?
if edge/evdo, what is the wireless card model and service provider.
the options i see thus far are: - internet connection sharing (ics) - router if you give more specifics, then we can give more specifics.
