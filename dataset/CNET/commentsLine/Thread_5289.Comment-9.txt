1) companies, buy, endorsements, its been happening for years, you'll learn it eventually.
2) fear only supports eax 2.0, in game 3) refer to 1 and 2 in response to farcry as well 4) lets see: hothardware, not considered &quot;authority&quot; hardocp, the website that doesn't give performance figures in favor of &quot;the feeling of the hardware&quot;, also the subject of most enthusiast jokes anandtech, hardocp except the jokes aren't as catchy additionally, gamers rarely know a thing about system performance or hardware, they just buy what marketing execs wnat them to buy, along with those websites you've listed being hardware enthusiast websites, not gamer websites gaming websites would be: ign gamespot gamespy wow forums steam forums any number of clan forums and so on i'm done trying to defend my side to you, i'm guessing in the next 5 to 10 years you'll actually experience the hardware you're defending so valiantly, you'll experience the non-existant customer and software support it ships with, you'll realize that benchmarks aren't anything, and you'll stop following marketing... ...one can only hope
