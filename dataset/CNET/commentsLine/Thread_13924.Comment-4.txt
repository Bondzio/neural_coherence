i had the same dilemma a few days back, didnt know what to do with my old pc, no one wanted it for free.
did some research spoke to some techs, was adviced on buying an enclosure kit which would allow me to use my old hard drives as files/media back up & my dvdrom/cdrw cud be used to copy media onto my new dvdrw in the same kit.
i had one slot for memory empty on my new pc so i pushed in the old one on the other slot.
looking forward to donate the motherboard, nvidia ti geforce 64mb & p4 processor.
hope this helps.
