Compter A: is a eMachine t6410 XP, AMD Anthlon 64 Processor. 2.19 Ghz, 512 MB of RAM. Computer B: HP Pavillion w/Windows Millenium. AMD Celeron 1ghz processor with 125 mb of ram. I am trying to network these two with a RJ-45 crossover cable but have had no success. I ran ''Network setup'' on my ICS (computer A XP) & on my Comp. (B (ME). But when i completed it, it said to run Network Setup Wizard on my other computer from the XP CD. My computer did not come with it and does not have a floppy, so i ran the one that came with my Windows ME computer. Maybe thats the issue?.. both are set for default workground 'MSHOME' and checked off file/printer settings to be enabled. Problem: When i try to access my network/view my network on my XP(A), i get the message: ''MShome is not accessible. You might not have permission to use this network resource. Contact the adminstrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions. -This list of servers for this workgroup is not currecntly avialable.'' And when i try to access my network on my (B). It only shows my (B) on the network workgroup list and not my (A). so anyone please help??

The default networking setting for Windows is &quot;Obtain Address Automatically&quot; but with a 2-system crossover, there is no DHCP server giving out the addresses. Thus you have to manually assign one. Use 192.168.1.101 for the first system and 192.168.1.102 for the second system. 2) You mentioned that you had already set both systems to the same workgroup name and turned on file sharing in the network properties. You must ALSO set the particular drives/folders you wish to work with as shared. Right click on it in Explorer and then go to the Sharing item in the context-menu. Further with XP, you need to manage the firewall settings to allow the other system to come through. HTH dw
14633	2	117384	1334548	1333659	macramonii	8/1/05 4:25 PM	1.1229135E12	some progress...	i set a manuel ip address to my second computer (Win Me) and added files/folders to be shared. I also fixed my firewall settings (zonealarm 4.5) to allow connections from my (Win XP). So when i try to view my workgroup MSHOME, it only shows the computer by itself, not the other. This also applies to my other computer, exactly. But for a moment, it showed &quot;Hpcomp&quot; on my XP. But when i try to click on &quot;Properties&quot; on the Hpcomp icon in my workgroup, it says &quot;the server Hpcomp could not be found on the network.&quot;. But the icon was there... And when it tryed to run the icon (Hpcomp) it said: &quot; \\Hpcomp is not accessible, you do not have permission to use this network resource. Contact administrator of this erver to find out if you have acess permissions. The network path was not found.&quot; But now, it doesnt show it no more, and i cant ping it by name either. So in the work group on my Win Me and XP, it only shows it the computer name by itself. and not the other one... ????

The first three parts of the dotted numbers must be the same and the fourth number is different for each system. I am assuming here that you connect to the internet by dial-up? The dial-up connectoid would still be set to automatically acquire an IP address from your ISP. Second, turn off ZoneAlarm and the Windows firewall for now. Establish connectivity between the systems with no interference from the firewalls and once you know you can see the systems from each other, then bring the firewalls back up and fight with them as necessary to get them to behave. As for pinging, try pinging from one to the other by IP address rather than by name. dw

But when i try to use the internet on the Win Me comp, it doesnt work. Just as if i was Offline...I remember when i ran the Network Wizard that i chose my XP to be my ICS and when i ran it on Win Me, i chose that it wasnt an ics but connected to the internet through another computer...and any idea why it dont work??
14633	7	117384	1338266	1338220	Dick White	8/3/05 10:44 AM	1.12306584E12	now you're reversing course...	The internet was not part of the original question. You asked about networking the two computers by crossover cable. So how do you (or maybe I should say &quot;how did you&quot;) connect to the internet? Dialup, broadband, how? We need to see the whole picture to give the right answers. dw

My XP is the ICS and my Win Me, is going to connect to the internet when it needs it through my XP...&quot;so how do I?&quot; -Modem used on XP: SoftV92 Data Fax Modem with SmartCP -Provider: PeoplePC Online

Here is a tutorial on setting up ICS in XP http://www.practicallynetworked.com/sharing/xp_ics/ When setting it up, choose your dial up connection as the connection to be shared, and select your network adapter as the bridge to your internal network. On the client ME system, skip the &quot;client wizard disk,&quot; don't really need it. Just be certain the TCP/IP properties of the ethernet adapter in the ME system is set back to &quot;obtain address automatically.&quot; It should acquire such an address from the XP system - if the XP system is turned on. The probable address it will acquire is 192.168.0.2. The trouble with ICS is that the server (your XP) system must be running in order for the client (your ME) system(s) to connect to the internet - but with dialup you don't have many options, at least not free ones. Also, which is not as often recognized, the server system must be already on before the client is turned on. The server issues the inside IP addresses, and if there is no server when the ME system boots, it is going to search in vain for 30 seconds and then assign itself a default 169.?.?.? address. First, you waste 30 seconds in the boot time, second, the address you get will fail to connect to the ICS server as it is a different series. The ideal solution is to ignore the standard guidance I gave above about setting the ME system back to &quot;obtain automatically.&quot; Instead, set a static IP for the ME's ethernet adapter to 192.168.0.xxx where xxx is between 100 and 254. This will allow the XP ICS server to issue up to 98 of its own addresses to other clients (not likely in your house, right?) before it would ever run into conflict with the assigned address of the ME system. This will also cut that wasted 30 seconds off the ME boot time when it looks for the XP system which may not already be on. dw
