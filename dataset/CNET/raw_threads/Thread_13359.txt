13604	0	113986	1294731	NR	pablonava	7/12/05 7:33 PM	1.12119678E12	HELP ME PLZ!!	OK I BOUGHT THIS COMPUTER 5 YEARS AGO. ITS AN HP PAVILION 6645C. I HAVE DONE A FEW UPGRADES BUT I WANT TO UPGRADE THE PROCESSOR. WHEN I BOUGHT IT HAD A 566MHz CELERON PROCESSOR, A MODEM, A CD-RW, NO VIDEO CARD AND 64MB OF RAM. NOW IT HAS NO MODEM WHICH WAS REPLACED BY A NIC CARD FOR MY DSL CONNECTION. IT HAS 384MB OF RAM AND A NEW NVIDA 64MB GEFORCE MX4000 VIDEO CARD. I WANT TO UPGRADE THE PROCESSOR TO A NEW 1GHz CELERON OR A NEW PENTIUM 3 PROCESSOR. WHAT A NEED TO KNOW IS IF MY MOTHERBOARD CAN HANDLE IT. MY MOTHERBOARD IS COGNAC-F, AND I RECENTLY SAW ON A WEBSITE THAT THE MAX IT CAN HANDLE WAS 800MHz. I NEED TO KNOW IF THIS IS TRUE SO THAT I WON'T BUY THE PROCESSOR WHICH WILL COST $45 WITH SHIPPING. EMAIL PLZ ON YOUR INFO SINCE I DONT KNOW IF I WILL BE READING YOUR REPLYS IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. EMAIL ME AT res18zzb@hotmail.com

(Not to mention it can't handle anything above 800MHz!) I have a four-year-old HP Pavilion 6736 (see my profile) which won't cut mustard anymore. I bumped it up to 512MB RAM, a 60GB HD, and a CD burner so that I can use it as a test machine. I rarely use it, and only to test programs or go to websites which I know will screw up my computer. However, there are so many programs that it won't handle, I created a second partition on my primary system for testing as well. Thus, I'm now looking for another use for my old 6736, most likely as a hardware firewall. Since yours is even older yet, you only have a few options, and upgrading it so that it can remain your primary computer shouldn't be one of them. Second, since you are new to the forums, I would like to point out that typing in all CAPS is considered shouting, and thus fairly rude. In the future, please keep this in mind. Hope this helps, John
