<s> So...I have two Hard drives that I want transferred to one. </s>
<s> One is a western digital slave drive that has a 232 gig capacity The other is my master drive: Segate with a 465 Gig capacity. </s>
<s> Both hard drives are near full and very old. </s>
<s> I'm going to buy a 1TB hard drive to transfer to. </s>
<s> And I'm curious if the two different drives are compatible to transfer to one HD of either brand. </s>
<s> (Seagate or Western Digital) I'm not too tech savvy, but I'm familiar with computer components. </s>
<s> Use Acronis to clone the boot drive to that new drive. </s>
<s> Then change the new drive to the boot drive then copy the folders and files from the second drive to the new drive. </s>
<s> Folders and files have never cared about the make/model of the drives they were on. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Many partition manager software can help you on this matter. </s>
<s> You can find the ones on google. </s>
<s> Just do it. </s>
