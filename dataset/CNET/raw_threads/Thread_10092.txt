First my monitor went black with an amber light on it signaling that there was no video signal comming from the pc. Its an ATI 9600xt -128m, I sent it back to be replaced. In the meantime I installed my old video card Matrox G400 now every 15 to 20 min the monitor goes black but the green light stays on. I shut off the monitor and turn it right back on and the video comes up. Question is this a sign that the monitor is on its way out? Its a Viewsonic A90 about 2 years old. System is as follows mb Asus A7n8x-e deluxe 1gig corsair matched 3000 memory AMD Athlon 3000 ATI 9600xt ( out for replacememt) epson stylus photo 825 usb epson perfection 1670 usb 2 maxtor external usb hd's Ipod Please give me some direction...Thanks all.
