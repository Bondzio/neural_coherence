534	0	519189	5092984	NR	WildClay	3/3/11 2:56 PM	1.29916416E12	Server / Database Benchmarks	I am looking for some benchmarks on database performance comparing Sybase ASE on a Sun/Sparc systems and MS-SQL on a WinTel box. The key is someone matching the boxes to roughly the same level, so it is as like for like as possible. I know this is not really in the domain of this forum but I was here so I figured I would ask. On a pricing level I was looking at a 32 Core Sun M5000 and a HP Blade Server with 32 Cores, both with 72G of RAM. However I really need database performance benchmarks. Thanks

That is a great site in general for benchmarking. I may be stuck with vendor published results or bite the bullet and use the TPC tools to create our own, something I am really trying to avoid. Thanks
