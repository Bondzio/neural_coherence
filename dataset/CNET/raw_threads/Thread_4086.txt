I thought I would be moving on up after I bought an Asus P4S533-MX motherboard with a Pentium 4 1.7 GHZ processor and 512 MB PC2100 DDR RAM on an auction website, but instead I am moving on down. lol I installed it in my computer case and it worked great for a week. I was running Vista on it and everything was going well until it started giving me errors and the blue screen of death and it kept restarting. Then I thought maybe the operating system isn't agreeing with the motherboard or some hardware connected to my motherboard so I took out my old Windows XP cd and tried installing that. As it was installing, that is when an error occurred and it would restart my computer. Then I thought maybe my hard drive is going bad, but it wasn't going bad when I put my old motherboard back in. Now I think I have a memory problem. I can't pinpoint if there's a problem with the 512 MB PC2100 DDR RAM or a problem with the memory slots. My motherboard can take both DDR or SDRAM. I took out the DDR and put some working SDRAM in. I turned on my computer and it kept beeping at me. Nothing was showing up on my monitor screen. Do you think I need to set something in the bios or on the motherboard to make it realize I am using SDRAM or do you think I have a memory slot problem? When I put the DDR back in, it starts up perfectly. I took the bios off of quick boot and it ran a test ont he meory and it said that the memory failed. So now I think I have bad DDR RAM. So how can I get this motherboard to see my good SDRAM? If you all think my memory slots have gone capooey, do you all think I should get another motherboard or is there a way of saving this motherboard? I almost forgot to tell you that I have the latest bios for this motherboard. It is 1006. I can't wait to see what solutions you have for me. Thank you for reading this!

I found out that I have a jumperfree motherboard so there's no way of setting a jumper on my motherboard to recognize the sdram. I ran across something as I was googling. A person was told by an Asus vendor that the sdram controllers on this motherboard aren't stable. I have a feeling there's no way of making them stable. I think I'll be buying a new motherboard.
