not booting.
thanks for the added details since it gives a better view of the situation.
given it was moved, i'd try the following.
remove the power cord from the pc.
open the pc cover and gently push what cards and cables you see into they slots and sockets.
gentle is the key word here.
it doesn't take a lot of force on most machines.
leave the cover off, connect the power and watch inside the machine as well as the screen as you turn the pc power on.
tell what you see and hear.
fans turning?
beeps?
