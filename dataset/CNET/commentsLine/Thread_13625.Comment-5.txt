that didn't fix it.. i think it is because the modem is also a router itself (if that is the correct way to call it).
based on another suggestion, i turned my new wi-fi router into a wap and now it works (connect the modem cable into one of the lan ports), though the speed seems to be reduced... it is weird because with my old wi-fi router i there was no prblem ....
