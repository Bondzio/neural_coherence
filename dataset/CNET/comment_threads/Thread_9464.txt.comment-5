START/RUN/ALL PROGARMS/PCHelp & Tools/ HP PC Recovery CD-DVD Creator Make the DVDs (mine required 2; yours may only require 1).
Then START/RUN/ALL PROGARMS/PCHelp & Tools/HP PC Recovery Tools CD.
You need the Recovery Tools CD to wipe the D: partition containing Restore information (I deleted mine) and to start the PC if it crashes so you can use the recovery DVD.
Send a set of both to your Mom.
Good luck!
