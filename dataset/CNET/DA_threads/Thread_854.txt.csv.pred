1.1.1	Hi I use win 7 OS and it is 1 yr old Dell Optiplex 780 desktop .	St
1.1.2	I had no issue when it was new to put the machine in hybernation , now it does not go into the hybernation mode !	St
1.1.3	Also it does not recognize the external HD ...	St
1.1.4	I cant backup my data files No problem with the USB it recognizes it so no problem with the USB port .	St
1.1.5	If some one has any suggestion what is causing this issue Thank you Pat	St
1.2.1	the machine recognizes the HD Control Panel under the Search devices .. but when I go the computer to look for the device it is not there .	St
1.2.2	Unable to back up my files .	St
1.2.3	In the task bar it has the icon to safely remove the hardware .	St
1.2.4	I use that before removing the HD .	St
1.2.5	I also checked the drivers and the it indicates that drivers are up to date .	St
1.2.6	Thank you for your help .	St
1.2.7	Pat	St
1.3.1	You could try doing a restoration to an earlier time to see if something might have changed within the system , doing this will not delete or remove anything , it is not the same as a full restore/recovery .	Sug
1.3.2	Unless you have tried this already , I 'd give it a shot .	St
1.4.1	Thank you issue .	St
1.4.2	I will try that and see what happens .	St
1.4.3	Ofcourse over the months I have added some software like CCleaner , Spyaweeper , Defrag and Advancedcare .	St
1.4.4	I am aware that sometimes some software cause issues .. but not recognize the HD was a new one for me .	St
1.4.5	As I indicated earlier external USB are recognized .	St
1.4.6	I connect this HD to an older computer running Window XP and it recognizes the HD .	St
1.4.7	So it seems that some setting in this new Dell machine does not allow the HD recognition .	St
1.4.8	Thank you so much for your suggestion .	St
1.4.9	Pat	St
1.5.1	I also wanted to provide this info : On Devices and printers I see the external HD .	St
1.5.2	I check the properties of this HD and check the device status and it says that device is working properly .	St
1.5.3	Is there anything else I can check to see what is causing this external HD not to be recognized .	St
1.5.4	Thank you Pat	St
