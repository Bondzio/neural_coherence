i've read most of the reviews of the printer, but they fail to mention anything about the cost of replacement cartridges.
i currently have a canon mp160 multifunction printer, which has been all right, but i'm mostly dissatified.
my main complaint, after relatively few color print jobs, i fork out $50 to replace the ink cartridges.
i could have bought another printer for the cost of these!
i've tried lower priced office depot refurbs, but the printer will not recognize the quantity of ink and the longevity is still pretty lacking.
i'm willing to spend a little more on a color printer if i don't have to constantly replace ink cartridges.
