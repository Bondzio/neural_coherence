1.1.1	I was watching that on newegg they sell a dual geforce gigabyte video card for like 280 dollars but I like to know its good for gaming.	St
1.1.2	Here's a link to it http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814125203 I am not sure if I can post it though.	St
1.2.1	trust me, the performance difference between a 6600 sli and a 6800 vanilla is pretty sad.	St
1.2.2	buy a 6800gt or vanilla and it will out perform those two cards.	St
1.2.3	konny	St
1.3.1	Well they say its two video cards in one.	St
1.3.2	Since I dont have two pci e x16 slots for SLI configuration I was looking into that one since it has two 6600 gts on one video card and fits into one pci e slot.	St
1.4.1	I am not sure about the gigabyte card since I read that it only works if you use it with a compatible gigabyte board is that true?	Res
1.4.2	Sorry for double posting.	St
1.5.1	you can't just put it in a normal PCIe board, the board has to support SLI also, like he said, buying that is a waste of money	St
1.6.1	I hear what you say but why do I need an SLI board if its just one PCI Express x16 slot?	St
1.6.2	They are two cards in one.	St
1.6.3	Besides what card would you recommend with a 400 watt power supply?	St
1.7.1	NIL	St
1.8.1	the PCB is the same, but it's two cards on 1 board, each chip will use 8x PCIe just like SLI it's not actually different from a dual card solution, it just looks cool and takes up less space you need the Gigabyte motherboard with the SLI chipset, or any other board with the SLI chipset for it to work (or a moddable Ultra, but that's only 10,000 in circulation that can be modded, and most have shipped and sold) also, depending on your 400W PSU you could use a 6800GT, but i'm going to assume given your overall lack of knowledge in this area that you don't have a high quality unit capable of handling the 6800GT with ease, I would suggest purchase of a high quality 450W or 500W unit alongside a 6800GT or 7800GT	St
