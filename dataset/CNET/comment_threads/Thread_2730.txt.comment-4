I am currently having the same problem.
I have a self-built pc with Windows Vista Ultimate 64-bit edition.
Has been running for about 6 months with no problems, then out of the blue, when I start my computer, it will load my ASUS screen, then the Windows logo screen comes up, and it says &quot;please wait&quot; as it is loading, then the screen goes black and stays that way.
On this black screen, my cursor is still visible and I can move it around, but the screen is completely black.
I have tried many troubleshooting solutions, including: - system restore - trying a boot repair off of the Vista disc - unplugging/replugging USB components Any ideas?
