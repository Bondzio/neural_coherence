Main PC with XP Home acts as server to Dell Laptop with XP Pro and a second PC with XP Home. These were all linked with a Cable connected BT wireless router into Ethernet mini switch which was then connected to Laptop, Server PC and second PC with ethernet cables. All were able to see each other and all were able to access internet and mail individually. I now have the router wirelessly connected to the server which links to other PC's via ethernet cables to mini switch. All units can see each other and Server can access mail and internet. But second PC and laptop are now unable to connect to internet or mail. The server is now and has always been protected with Zone Alarm. Sorry for length of this but needed you to understand the connections. Am I now missing something? Grateful for advice, Peter

If you are using a router of some kind, that should be giving all of your systems access to the internet. I guess I am just a little confused on exactly how you have your systems configured. Were you using internet connection sharing or something?
