i clean once every few months when i open my computer to add more parts.
sometimes i just want to look inside because i am bored and end up cleaning it.i clean it with a cloth most of the time.
i would never put a vacuum cleaner in their unless if it was one of those keyboard ones because i am scared of it damaging the computer.
there is normaly a little bit of dust bunnies but not much.
most of the dust is on the fans and on the grills.
