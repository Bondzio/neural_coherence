The case temps range from 22c to 24c. It came with 2 cooling fans in the case. Would more fans help? Do you think it might be something else? (Motherboard, bios, etc..) Any suggestions?

It's an ATX 430W P4 POWER SUPPLY WITH DUAL FANS. Retail is approx 80 bucks. I wouldn't think it's going bad already. If the computer were 5-6 years old, and it was a cheap power supply, maybe. I am getting no indications (random reboots, smell, sounds, etc) that it's going bad.

You can get something like a Sparkle power supply, 450Watts or so, for around $50. That is the first step in trying to figure out where the problem is. The only other thing to replace is the motherboard. Those are the only 2 things that really could cause what you are seeing.
