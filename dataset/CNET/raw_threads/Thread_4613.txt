My question is, when i opened the case and looked i saw an area labeled AGP1 and there is nothing there, is it possible to ADD and AGP slot? if so how hard would it be? Any help would be great full. Thank you

Post the results here. I will note that some motherboard models used by big name computer makers will specify that there is a particular slot or other ports, but they end up missing or as dummy ports that never were wired. How hard would it be? Entirely too difficult and expensive. The solution is to get a new motherboard with the slot you want or just purchase a new computer. Maybe a PCI (not PCI Express) video card will suffice?
