i'm running a wireless network for 3 computers (2 xp and one me) and all 3 computers are able to access the internet via the wireless router.
however, i haven't been able to setup a working home network for sharing files, etc.
i've made several attempts to use the ms xp software (setup home or office network) to setup a network without success.
i wondering if anyone can recommend a reasonable software package that would support xp and me in setting up a home network.
i don't want to upgrade the me computer to xp because of hardware issues.
