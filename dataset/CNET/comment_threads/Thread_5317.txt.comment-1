Hi.
I need a 1GB DDR PC2700/PC3200 RAM module, a DVDRW, and a 128/256 MB AGP graphics card.
Right now my mobo is P4VM800 ( http://www.asrock.com/mb/photo/P4VM800%28Enlarge%29.jpg ).
Hard disk is Maxtor 60GB.
Still with Windows XP.
So tell me, should I just buy a new desktop PC, or continue with the upgrade?
The primary reason why would I bother to upgrade is I want to switch to Windows 7 with its Aero support... Any advice is greatly appreciated!
