Nobody was using it, I just saw the message as I was walking by. The first 2 times I rebooted, it started up normally. The 3rd time it gave me a ''harddrive not found'' error. I am using XP sp2. The hard drive is less than 6 months old. I don't have any extra hard drives, just a cd-rom & a 3'' floppy. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Otherwise check your physical connections, power and IDE (if relevent), then go to the BIOS on boot and see if the primary device is recognised.
