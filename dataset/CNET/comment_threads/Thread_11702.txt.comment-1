My sister-in-law has a Gateway computer with a DVD drive installed.
Since reinstalling the OS from the Gateway recovery disk, her DVD player will not read DVD's.
You can put a CD or a DVD in and open Explorer and view the contents.
But, when you use a DVD Player program (and I tried several to see if it was just a software problem) the programs come back with a message stating that no DVD player was found.
Everything looks good in device manager, My Computer shows it as a DVD player, and I've gone through an updated all the drivers.
Any thoughts on this???
Thanks, Cameron
