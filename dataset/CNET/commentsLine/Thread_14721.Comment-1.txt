hi guys, need to know if i should get a dual *simultaneous* band router.
this wireless adaptor is n class with an ism maximum frequency of 2.4ghz, and a unii maximum frequency of 5 ghz.
does this mean it will work in the more stable and faster 5 ghz band, or is it strictly 2.4ghz?
i have to buy a new router so for $100 more, i'll get one that does both bands, *simultaneously*, but if this adaptor can't run on 5ghz, i'll save some money and just get a dual band.
thanks for any help!
