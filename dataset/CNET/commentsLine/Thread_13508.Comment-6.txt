here's some of my pc specs.
system: microsoft windows xp professional version 2002 service pack 2 computer: intel pentium 4 cpu 2.53ghz 1.92 ghz, 1.00gb of ram connection: 802.11g wlan (125 mbps) ______________________________________________________ i just formatted, so i only installed my video and sound card drivers, sp2, winamp, msn and firefox.
i never had the problem before with the same hardware.
i conventionally know little of computers, but my guess is that windows update or the service pack is running something new pertinent to wireless connectivity.
hope my input helps you solve the problem, mat.
