whats too much?
is there any &quot;guidelines&quot; as to what is &quot;safe&quot; and what is not?what i'm asking is how high of a temperature can i hit before i have to implement more cooling?
can i det the clock too high?
i currently have the clock set at 570.38mhz and memory @418.5mhz and nothing negative has happened?the tempoerature is currently at 44c with the fan speed on the card at 70% (i modified the fan speed as well just to be safe).
