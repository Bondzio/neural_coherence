I fully agree that the HDD is on its way to the big scrap bin in the sky - Incinerate it if you can, to destroy your personal data, or smash it flat with a heavy hammer.
Spinrite has got to be the absolute best in surface recovery.
If you don't know about it - it is a sort of non-destructive low-level formatter.
It low-level formats, high-level formats, pattern tests and then, only if the sector passes all tests does it put the data back.
If it fails, the data is transferred to a safe area on the HDD.
I've revived loads of drives with it.
Ideal for rejuvenating sectors Before they fail.
It can also recover data.
