In short, most MP3's are STEREO.
The entire idea of MP3 is to shrink the filesize and there is no reason carry more channels than 99.99% of the people will have.
The reason the other setup may emit sound is that it's setup to just copy stereo out that back channels.
Your SKILL in finding all the settings may be needed, but I do not see any flaw in hardware or software here.
