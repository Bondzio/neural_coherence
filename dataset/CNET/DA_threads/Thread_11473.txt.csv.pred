1.1.1	This has probably been asked before but i am wracking my brain looking for an answer.	St
1.1.2	I have a new Dell Inspiron Desktop with the new i3 processor and Win7.	St
1.1.3	I wanted to set up a network with my older Dell Dimension which has P4 proccessor and WinXP and a Dell Inspiron laptop.	St
1.1.4	Neither desktop has wireless cards but the laptop does.	St
1.1.5	I purchased a Netgear Wireless N 300 router and a Netgear N300 wireless usb adapter.	St
1.1.6	Both feature the Push n Connect security feature.	St
1.1.7	I connected the router to the new desktop and the adapter to the older desktop.	St
1.1.8	Everything is now connected, up and running and the network is secure.	St
1.1.9	The laptop can be connected to the network by typing in a passphrase I created.	St
1.1.10	My question is: I was under the impression I needed a wireless adapter for the new desktop.	St
1.1.11	Is this true and is it necessary?	St
1.1.12	What will happen if one is not installed.	St
1.1.13	Sorry but I am still learning about all this.	St
1.1.14	Thanks anyone!	St
1.1.15	!	St
1.2.1	It's rather simple.	St
1.2.2	You either need a cable for a wired connection between the Dell and the router, or a wireless adapter.	St
1.2.3	If you go for a wireless one, you can choose between one connected via USB or one connected via the Ethernet port.	St
1.2.4	So, all in all, you've got three things to choose from.	St
1.2.5	Kees	St
1.3.1	Thank you.	St
1.3.2	I kinda figured.	St
1.3.3	I guess I have a wired and wireless connection hooked up?	St
