1.1.1	I bought a WD-VelociRaptor 300 Gig Hard Drive 32 MB Sata-6 G Piriform Speccy Tells me Somthing Different How do I tell if what Speccy is corect or wrong The Seller tells me something different , and western Digital told me to give them the Serial # I got what was Stated above .	St
1.1.2	Speccy is corect about everything else on my computer .	St
1.1.3	DC WD3000HLHX-01JJPV0 ATA Device	St
1.2.1	The label/decal/sticker provides the info you need .	St
1.2.2	It readily IDs the HD and you need proceed to the support website and use that for any further details .	St
1.2.3	Finding your similar posts for s/w help , the decal , etc. , has always all that is needed .	St
1.2.4	The only way it could differ if the vendor is somehow deceiving you but not the manufacturer .	St
1.2.5	So other than that , the decal is good enough .	St
1.2.6	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	Decal is wrong Western Digital Says So They Told me to give them the Serial # and thats how they new .	St
1.3.2	A lot is wrong Stating on the Label and the searial # I do not care what the label says just as long a I get what I ordered .	St
1.3.3	Wendell	St
1.4.1	You better care as the label IDs the product .	St
1.4.2	using that SN # and since WD already says , they 're not what is suppose to , then you have a case .	St
1.4.3	You need to contact the vendor and address the issue .	St
1.4.4	If you have n't already , stop any payment .	St
1.4.5	If local , contact them .	St
1.4.6	If not , then contact by whatever means in order to resolve this .	St
1.4.7	If in fact this is something on the illegal nature you need to report it .	St
1.4.8	besides contacting WD to help resolve the problem , that vendor has to be held accountable .	St
1.4.9	Take notes , save paperwork , whatever in order to prove your case as now if you proceed it may become a legal matter if the vendor does n't stand behind the product .	St
1.4.10	As for WD , besides being contacted how or what they once you explain the matter would be a matter they may want to press .	St
1.4.11	It 's up to you as to how you proceed but i would n't become uncivil in this issue .	St
1.4.12	tada -- -- -- Willy	St
1.5.1	I should identify your disk including the serial # to make sure it matches the label .	Sug
1.6.1	The serial # does not match the what was sent to me it matches what I ordered it is Sad .	St
1.6.2	Two different Statement confirmation emails .	St
1.6.3	Thank you Wendell	St
1.7.1	You did n't mention where you got it so no one can tell if you purchased from a reputable vendor .	St
1.7.2	I could wonder if it was n't a & quot ; refurb & quot ; drive that had the controller board replaced as the SN and other drive parameters would be burned onto the board 's circuitry .	St
1.7.3	This being the case , you need to confront the seller with the information and see if they 'll make this right .	St
1.7.4	The other option ... and if you got a very friendly price ... is to keep it and live with it .	St
1.7.5	Caveat emptor .	St
1.8.1	It is not refurbished it is OEM , but I am starting to wonder what it is .	St
1.8.2	I spent money at this place since 2004 .	St
1.8.3	You buy something and then it is all out of stock ?	Ques
1.8.4	Wendell	St
1.9.1	I Do not want to take a Chance on the next one they where going to send me because it still does not match up to what I first ordered .	St
1.9.2	I will buy HD from another Vender .	St
1.9.3	( TRUST ) Thank You Everybody For the Help Wendell	St
1.10.1	sounds to me - from china .	St
1.10.2	took a smaller drive and made changes to the fat to say its the right size etc and stuck a label on that matches what he wanted .	St
1.10.3	I ran into that with SDHC cards - smaller cards - label changed and the report back in the fat says higher mem and class .	St
1.10.4	not so - some dont work at all or you just end up with a 1 to 4 g card .	St
1.10.5	these were purch IN the usa with no mention of where from .	St
1.10.6	only use reputable sellers for electronics !	St
1.11.1	NIL	St
1.12.1	I did use a reputable seller one I have been using over a decade .	St
1.12.2	Built three computers from buying parts I bought from them .	St
1.12.3	I do not chose to use their name .	St
1.12.4	They have refunded my money back into my account .	St
1.12.5	I am not happy off what happened , and hope it does not happen again to me or some one else .	St
1.12.6	To everybody just be carefull when you buy parts or anything online .	St
