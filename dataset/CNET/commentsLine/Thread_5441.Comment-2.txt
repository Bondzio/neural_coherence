while building a pc is a time honored tradition, is that the goal or is getting the work done the real goal?
for fast desktops i suggest any of the quad or six core intel i7 machines with 4gb ram to start, windows 7 64 bit and a nice graphics card.
start at the nvidia gt220 with 1gb ram and go up from there.
