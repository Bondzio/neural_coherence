<s> Hey everyone, havent been on the forums in a while, especially not in the desktop section. </s>
<s> My question today has to do with using an HDTV as a computer monitor. </s>
<s> With black friday coming up I am currently contemplating picking up a cheap (~400$) 32&quot; 720P LCD HDTV, and using it as my computer monitor. </s>
<s> I am running an HP s3600t desktop with the 256mb NVIDIA graphics card, 64 bit windows, 3gb ram, etc. </s>
<s> How well will this work? </s>
<s> I've heard of people doing it, but im not sure how this works for a basically average desktop system with a few upgrades in it. </s>
<s> You didn't tell us what type of video output you have on the desktop. </s>
<s> If the graphics card has an output that will match the TV's input, just plug it in. </s>
<s> I have both a VGA and an HDMI output on my graphics card. </s>
<s> Will one have a better picture than the other? </s>
<s> i would assume the HDMI one would but who knows. </s>
<s> The big thing i was wondering though was how well the resolution would be and if there would be any issues with lag time between movement and response. </s>
<s> For a very simple reason and that I won't write about since it's been done and overdone. </s>
<s> As to lag. </s>
<s> Only a gamer's top end machine can reduce lag. </s>
<s> I have yet to be told VGA vs HDMI has a difference beyond 4.2 milliseconds. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> We have several companies using DVI outs on their pcs to achieve a brilliant video quality. </s>
<s> Check TV.....most have VGA, DVI and HDMI anymore... All will look pretty good though. </s>
