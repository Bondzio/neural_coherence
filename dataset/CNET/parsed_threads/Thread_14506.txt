<s> I have a personally built PC with AMD 1.4Ghtz, 2 hard drives, DVD burner, and broadband. </s>
<s> A few months ago a strange problem started occurring. </s>
<s> Whenever I power-up the computer, within the first 5 minutes of it being on it will either freeze, automatically restart, or the screen will go black. </s>
<s> Either way I have to totally restart the computer. </s>
<s> This problem can occur once, a couple times a day, or it can be a couple days before it happens again. </s>
<s> There are no viruses, and a brand new power supply. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> could be anythin...ram, faulty hd, dust and gunk from dirty case affecting airflow, video card, etc. </s>
<s> could also be virus, spyware, etc. </s>
<s> does this happen in safe mode? </s>
<s> Failing, leaking, swollen motherboard capacitors then dust off the heatsinks and leave the case cover off till you find the issue. </s>

<s> OK, no viruses. </s>
<s> What about spyware? </s>
<s> I have checked for spyware, viruses, etc. </s>
<s> and there is nothing found. </s>
<s> This problem also occurs during bootup before Windows even starts loading. </s>
