true single 1tb hds are not that plentiful yet but available.
the brand that seems to pop-up is that from hitachi and wd while others really offer dual-500gb setups in ready made ext.
cases and/or if you diy.
it rally doesn't matter what hds are out there, as all are prone to damage for whatever reason, being 1tb isn't going to isolate it from similar damage.
i tend to lean towards wd and seagate for typical installs, seagate more as they have a better warranty period compared to anyone else.
samsung is another to look for when 1tb is made by them.
imho, wait for seagate offerings if at all possible.
so far, i haven't heard any horror stories, but i don't fix a zillion hd problems neither.
