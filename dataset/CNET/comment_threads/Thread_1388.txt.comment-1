HI.
I do a lot of graphic work on my PC and a lot of the time I'm trying to learn from tut or use photos to do my work by.
Anyway, I heard that you could hook up two monitors to 1 PC and i thought this would really help me out.
I was hoping someon here might be able to help me figure out what equiptment I would need and how to set things up.
here are the specs on my PC.
