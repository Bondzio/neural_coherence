<s> I just set up a dual platform hub with G4 and XP machines. </s>
<s> As a previously pc-only user, I have many bookmarks in IE, though I now use only Safari and Foxfire on the Mac. </s>
<s> Is there any way to get my bookmarks (including my many folders) transferred to my Mac? </s>
<s> (I am not actively networking the machines (though can if I need), but sharing peripherals, including an external hard drive). </s>
<s> Thanks for any help. </s>
