<s> Recently both my iPod 5th gen video and my laptop a 7 year old Hp dv4150us died. </s>
<s> now i am facing a problem because after my iPod died i would listen to my iTunes collection on my laptop/desktop computer. </s>
<s> i mostly use iTunes for its DRMd HD Tv shows and movies and a little bit of music (a combo of Pandora and my riped cds) so it would only make sense to buy a product that runs iTunes so i can do both. </s>
<s> so i was thinking of buying the Hp Mini 311 sense it has the Nvidia ion graphics processor and a 720p screen, but that left me thinking mabey i need something smaller like an iPod touch. </s>
<s> from a price standpoint to buy a 32 gig ipod touch would set me back $300 for $99 more i could have a fully functioning computer, HD hardware support+ and HD screen, and not to mention flash support. </s>
<s> i wouldn't mind having an ipod but i dont really want to carry around a giant netbook if i feel like listening to music. </s>
<s> i really dont know which to pick. </s>
<s> But i can tell you this i don't want an iPad because i need something cheep that isn't useless. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> I can only warn you that the usual netbooks do not play HD. </s>
<s> You have to look at the better netbooks that have the HDMI connection and the Nvidia ION or better display chipset. </s>
