1.1.1	Every time I have to re-start my computer I lose the connection to one of the computers on our network .	St
1.1.2	Can somebody help me fix this ?	Ques
1.1.3	We are currently running Windows XP on all computers .	St
1.1.4	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	what is it you mean ?	Ques
1.2.2	Is this a peer-to-peer network and you can not see this one in & quot ; Network Places & quot ; ?	Ques
1.2.3	is it a mapped drive that does n't show up each time ?	Ques
1.2.4	Is this the only one of several with which this happens ?	Ques
1.2.5	If so , I 'd look at that computer and your own .	St
1.3.1	I should have been more specific , I apologize .	St
1.3.2	It 's a peer to peer and yes I keep losing it from my Network Places whenever I have to restart my computer for any reason .	St
1.3.3	We also have a mapped netork drive that keeps dropping from some of our other computers as well whenever they have to restart byut thats a whole other issue = ) Thanks !	St
1.4.1	With peer-to-peer networks , there is some sort of an & quot ; election & quot ; process that takes place and one PC is designated to keep track of all the shares .	St
1.4.2	So , when you go to view your network places , it 's through that one device ... .or so I understand .	St
1.4.3	There is some sort of & quot ; pecking order & quot ; that can determine which PC is most fit to be the & quot ; master browser & quot ; .	St
1.4.4	PCs that drop off and come back on ( are reset ) or are added later , trigger some sort of polling activity to rebuild the list of network shares .	St
1.4.5	Of course if the master browser is reset , the whole voting process needs to be repeated .	St
1.4.6	This will probably account for temporary absences or devices that are slow to show up .	St
1.4.7	I do n't understand this process very well and I 'm sure someone here can explain it better .	St
1.4.8	You can google & quot ; master browser & quot ; for more reading .	St
1.4.9	But , one thing that will affect this and might have something to do with your problem is which network services are running on each PC .	St
1.4.10	Of course firewalls are a factor .	St
1.4.11	I 'm assuming you 've already made your local network and exception in any firewall settings .	St
