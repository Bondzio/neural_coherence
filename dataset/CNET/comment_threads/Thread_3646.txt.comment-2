The label/decal/sticker provides the info you need.
It readily IDs the HD and you need proceed to the support website and use that for any further details.
Finding your similar posts for s/w help, the decal, etc., has always all that is needed.
The only way it could differ if the vendor is somehow deceiving you but not the manufacturer.
So other than that, the decal is good enough.
