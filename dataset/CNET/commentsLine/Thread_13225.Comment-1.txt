ok so im looking to purchase a 320gb western digital sata hard drive(retail - includes sata cable).. i will also be pairing this with the gigabyte ds3r p35 motherboard (has 8 sata slots).. do i need to buy some kind of adapter in order to use this sata hard drive?
i'm not really knowledgable with this at all =/ what exactly can i do with a sata hard drive that gives it an advantage over the old ide style?
ive been reading about people saying that you need a sata adapter and all kinds of cables in order to run a sata hard drive.. any input would be greatly appreciated, thanks
