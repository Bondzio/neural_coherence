I checked the event log, to be honest, I am not real sure what I am looking for, though I thought I would be able to spot a problem if I saw one.
It could be &quot;user error&quot; that I didn't notice troubling though.
I am not too sure how to check my temps on the CPU, but was able to check my GPU and it runs between 75C-77C it seems.
