For all purposes (especially malware), a Windows 8 Pro tablet is a PC.
It is to hope that the Windows App store for 'metro' apps (to run on the Windows RT tablets) is kept malware-free (or, even better, that there are no security gaps in the part of Windows that run those apps).
Time will tell.
For an iPad,I think, at the moment antivirus is not necessary.
For Android I see that both Avast and Avira already have security programs that include antivirus (it's kind of a mobile security app).
So that new market surely is present.
