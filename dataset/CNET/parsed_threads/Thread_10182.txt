<s> Ok, i know it sounds weird asking if something thats free is worth it, but heres the story. </s>
<s> i was at my buddies house today and i noticed his partialy gutted computer lying around. </s>
<s> i asked if he would be willing to part with it and he said i could have it for free if i wanted, since he had no use for it. </s>
<s> thing is, its missing some key components. </s>
<s> Its missing a processor, but thats no problem, i have an athlon XP 3000 lying around. </s>
<s> its missing a graphics card, but thats not a problem either, i have various AGP graphics cards around my house. </s>
<s> missing a hard drive, but i have a PATA hard drive lying around as well... What i DONT have lying around is RAM. </s>
<s> it takes PC3200, two slots. </s>
<s> a trip to the Futureshop website showed a 1GB stick for 30 bucks (kingston) so i would probably get 2 of those for 60. another thing i dont have is a monitor. </s>
<s> a good LCD will set me back what, 150, 160 dollars? </s>
<s> so i feel like im spending too much money and effort on a PC thats realy quite old and slow, but i always wanted to have a desktop in my room so :lol: . </s>
<s> so do you guys think im wasting money, or is this a reasonable amount to spend to fix up a PC this slow? </s>
<s> thanks for reading this far. </s>

<s> and then theres a keyboard, mouse, and wireless card since it will be in my room and there is no physical connection near there. </s>

<s> sorry, i copied this from my post on another forum and for some reason it doubled the post. </s>
<s> On FREECYCLE I see free CRT monitors weekly it seems. </s>
<s> So the display could be a freebie too. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> well first off i've never heard of Freecycle, lol. </s>
<s> secondly a CRT would be too big to put on my desk. </s>
<s> The class of machine you are looking at was plagued with far too many issues. </s>
<s> The Athlon core would vaporize in a split second (watch http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCmai6Q9DoM ) and far too many had the BAD CAPS issue. </s>
<s> Unless you can get it all for free it's not a good deal. </s>
<s> It would be a shame to spend one dime and then discover why the machine was stripped and set aside. </s>
<s> If you want something small and nice I'll share I picked up that 350 buck Acer Aspire One. </s>
<s> It's been a hoot. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I've run an athlon core for like 4 years with no problems. </s>
<s> it will only vaporise if im retarded and take off the heatsink when its on. </s>
<s> Having seen this machine class at the shop counters far too often my advice is to not spend a dime to get it working. </s>
<s> If you get it all working FOR FREE then you can decide to upgrade the display, etc. </s>
<s> Remember you are asking for opinions and I'm sharing mine freely. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> i think what i'll do is this: Buy the RAM, put the whole thing together and sell it. </s>
<s> Maybe on ebay or in a local paper. </s>
<s> Just sell it as tower only and all i'll have to buy is the RAM. </s>
<s> i could definitely sell the tower for more than the price i paid for the RAM. </s>
<s> its a good moneymaking scheme </s>
