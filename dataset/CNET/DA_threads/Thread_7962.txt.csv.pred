1.1.1	I want to know if Mac users go through all the security updates like Window users .	St
1.1.2	I am tired of the updates .	St
1.1.3	I was told that Mac users do n't have security updates like windows .	St
1.1.4	Is this true ?	Ques
1.2.1	Macs need fewer ( a lot fewer ) updates/patches because of two things : * The operating system is much more stable and secure than Windows .	St
1.2.2	This , in part , comes from its simplicity .	St
1.2.3	*Such a small percentage of users have a Mac , that hackers do n't devote much time to hacking it .	St
1.2.4	The more people that use it ( Windows ) , the more appealing it is as a target .	St
1.2.5	Thus , Macs still have security and misc .	St
1.2.6	updates to download , but not to the extent of its Windows counterpart .	St
1.2.7	Hope this helps , John	St
