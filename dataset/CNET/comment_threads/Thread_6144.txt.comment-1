Hey guys, recently I purchased new RAM memory for my desktop.
It is 16GB Gskill RipjawsX 1600Mhz, with 10-10-10-30 timing.
I installed it, set proper timings and speed in BIOS, and after a few minutes of work, I got BSOD.
When I restarted my PC, it said it could not load my graphic card drivers.
I downloaded newest one from nVidia site, I thought it might be a problem because I was using beta drivers.
But the same thing happen.
I went and reset speed and timings to auto, which is 1333Mhz, 9-9-9-24, and since then it is working properly, which is some 2-3 hours.
I was hoping someone can help me with this problem.
Anyway, my configuration is: AMD FX-8320 3.5Ghz Gigabyte 990FXA-UD3 nVidia GeForce GTX480 WD 1TB HD.
