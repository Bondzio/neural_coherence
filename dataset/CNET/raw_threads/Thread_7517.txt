When I place a DVD movie in my computer I get the message &quot;No Windows 2000 compatible DVD decoder installed on this system.&quot; I like Windows 2000 and dislike Windows XP, so I had wiped XP off the system and installed 2000. For the most part it went well, though there are three drivers I am still trying to track down and install. How can I find out what DVD decoder needs to be installed on this system? Any ideas on where I can find it? I very much appreciate any help. Just in case you may be a real wizard, the three drivers that are missing are listed as: 1) Multimedia Audio Controller - Location PCI Bus 0, device 20, function 5 2) PCI Device - Location PCI Bus 0, device 20, function 0 3) Unknown device - On Microsoft ACPI - Compliant System. How on earth do you find a driver for an unknown device, or find out what the unknown device is?? HELP!!! Shouldn't people be able to place any operating system on their computer they want without the computer being proprietary to a particular operating system?

I had the same issue on Win 2000; try downloading POWERDVD (trial) which has a software decoder built in rather than having to buy a $15 or $30 decoder for Windows Media Player and other software.. if you can't install the original motherboard and system drivers (which you CAN'T because HP doesn't support that on your Pavilion) I know that because I have the HP A1250n, the same family. HP only supports the Media Center Edition they supply, and no other drivers.

If not it may not be supportable on 2000. If not, search for AC97 generic codecs/driver for Windows 2000. You will also probably not get USB 2.0 speeds from your PC, Win 2000 doesn't support it AFAIK. XP didn't until SP1.

If what you write is true, they would have thousands of versions. Bob

It is like Nvidia's PureVideo DVD decoder. Most PC's have it built in to decode DVD's, but a bare reinstall needs one. A good player that doesn't require it is VideoLAN. Here is an old ATI decoder that should work with Radeon X200.. http://drivers.soft32.com/driver/download-ATI_DVD_Decoder-24075.html
