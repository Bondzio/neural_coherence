Every time I try to get online the page doesn't load, so I opened the Networking part in Device manager and it shows the Intel Ethernet adapter &quot;not functioning&quot;, it says it has a error and then it says (Code 10)....I googled it and I see a lot of people seem to have the same problem as me, some have it with their USB devices and some with their wireless cards. Now is there a way to fix this, does anyone know, or should I go out and buy a new Ethernet card, or will I get the same problem again. I connect my Ethernet cable into the motherboards Ethernet input, I don't have a separate PCI card for it, the internet worked perfectly on this before and I turned off the PC and then a hour later I turned it on again and it stopped working, I have no clue whats going on. Please help!

Intel Core 2 Duo 400 Gb HDD 3 GB RAM nVidia 8600 GTS I have all the Vista Updates I also checked if the drive is out of date, but every time I update it says that the drive is up to date..I wanted to uninstall and then reinstall the drives, but the problem is that I don't know where to find the drives for this Ethernet thing.
