this is the only intel &quot;d102&quot; motherboard i could find at intel.com:  intel makes solid motherboards, but they don't have a reputation for being great overclockers (important for high-end gamers).
the board is very small-- microatx size, so it is not very expandable.
look for a full atx motherboard if you plan to make this a gaming, media center, or a computer for some use that might require many add-in cards (sound card, 56k modem, tv tuner, physx card, etc.
).
