thanks for everyone's feedback.
i happen to have two spare sticks of 1 gb ram that i think is compatible with the vaio, and which would nominally increase the ram from 1.5 gb to 2.5 gb.
so, i think i'll do a &quot;hail mary&quot; and plug those two 1 gb sticks into the pc and see what happens.
i will report back in the next day or so on what happened as a result.
by the way, i installed the linux distro kubuntu 11.10 onto the vaio as the os.
willy--i have no experience in updating bios, but might consider trying that after seeing what happens with the upgrade to 2.5 gb.
at any rate, this viao pc is just an extra pc that i can experiment with, and if things go bad with it, it's not really a problem.
