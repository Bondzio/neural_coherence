question: is there a life expectancy on external hard drives?
i have been using the same 250gb external hard drive for more than five years.
i backup quicken files, thousands of photos and a lot of other files to a portable drive several times a year.
i would like to know if it has a life expectancy and should i eventually retire it?
are there maintenance procedures that will enable me to prolong the life of these drives or is it just a matter of luck when it goes south?
thanks so much!
