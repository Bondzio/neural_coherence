<s> Hello - My wife's Graphite Clamshell G3, 466mhz, 512mb ram, 10 gig hd [7.1 free], Panther 10.3.9, started running very slowly a week ago. </s>
<s> She's using the Firefox browser, we're on WIFI at home, and accustomed to great performance from this wonderful old computer. </s>
<s> I had thought to do a clean install of the Panther OS thinking that might help, but disk #1 would not 'initiate' in the computer and now is 'stuck' in the computer, recycling constantly through its attempts while 'quit installer', 'restart' have no effect. </s>
<s> And, during this process, somehow, upon startup, the computer shows a small picture of the world, changing to a blinking folder showing a question mark on it. </s>
<s> I don't have the original install disks that came with it, having bought it used some years ago. </s>
<s> I did find an Apple download for the AHT one could make by burning a cd of it through Disk Utility and using Firewire through my PowerBook G4 to 'boot' into AHT. </s>
<s> But I'm unable to complete this process. </s>
<s> I can see the HD of the G3, and the AHT disk on the G4 Finder, but I'm unable to do anything with it. </s>
<s> Thanks much for your help; hoping this little computer can be saved. </s>
<s> I find I had to replace CD/DVD drives, get new media and more. </s>
<s> While the machine may be saved some don't want to replace a few parts. </s>

<s> Press, and hold down, the power button until the computer shuts off. </s>
<s> Once it's off, press the power button again and hold down the mouse button. </s>
<s> Keep it held down until the disk pops out. </s>
<s> The &quot;world&quot; icon indicates that the iBook is trying to find a startup volume on the network. </s>
<s> If it continues, and you are unable to complete the boot process, shut down the computer again and when you restart, hold down the option key. </s>
<s> Keep it down until you see a choice of startup volumes. </s>
<s> Choose the internal HD and continue the boot. </s>
<s> Once booted, go to the &quot;Startup Disk&quot; control panel and set the startup to the internal HD. </s>
<s> You could then try repairing the permissions, not always a cure all but worth doing. </s>
<s> As Bob mentioned, things wear out over time. </s>
<s> Do you have an external firewire HD you could use? </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> Panther disk released from captivity. </s>
<s> Holding down the 'Option' key brings up a blue screen with the choices of a reversed arrow, and a 'continue' straight arrow button. </s>
<s> Neither would 'fire' a response. </s>
<s> In the meantime I found a G3 'boot from 'c' install disk', may not have been the correct one, but it started and Disk Utility gave the HD a clean bill of health. </s>
<s> I also found the manner to do the AHT from the burned disk I'd made from an Apple download. </s>
<s> It ran three times, clearing all, mass storage, ram, and logic board. </s>
<s> Either of these tests could be wrong of course. </s>
<s> I also tried zapping the 'pram'. </s>
<s> But I'm determined, is there a next step? </s>
<s> Thanks much for your help. </s>
<s> the blue screen is normal but you should have had an icon or two on the screen. </s>
<s> The icons represent the choices of boot disk that are available to the computer. </s>
<s> Selecting one of the icons and then pressing the &quot;straight&quot; arrow should start the boot sequence from the selected source. </s>
<s> I don't know what you mean by &quot;boot from &quot;c&quot; install disk&quot;. </s>
<s> Is this a OS X installation disk? </s>
<s> If the machine boots correctly from its hard drive, and you have not said if it does or not, is it still slow? </s>
<s> If the answer is yes, then it may be time to do an &quot;Archive and Install&quot; of the OS. </s>
<s> This is quite easy but does require that you have a working installation disk for OS X (10.3.x) When you find one, let us know P </s>
<s> Well, I don't know why this simple operation won't work for me, but holding down the 'option' key reveals only the 'post-selection' arrows, not the choices of boot disks which would get me to where progress is possible. </s>
<s> I have it at that state now, and perhaps will just leave it for awhile to see if anything better developes. </s>
<s> I'm doubting that without these choices being available a solution here is coming? </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> will not be forthcoming unless you have the working OS X installation disks or the computer boots correctly from the hard drive P </s>
<s> I may not have had the original Install OSX disks, but those I had worked! </s>
<s> All's fine on it now, except it's running 10.2.8, Housecat?, instead of Panther 10.3.9. </s>
<s> Eventually I'll buy the Panther disks again, but for now it's fine. </s>
<s> I can now see that the ram is 320mb; what would be the max ram, and would there be any real benefit to going there? </s>
<s> Thanks again very much for your help. </s>
