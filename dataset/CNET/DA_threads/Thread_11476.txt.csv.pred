1.1.1	I recently reformated my hard drive and reloaded about 3000 music files back on to my computer.	St
1.1.2	WMP plays them all, but they're all in one 'Music' folder, which takes about 5 minutes to open up because there's so many files.	St
1.1.3	It used to organize the files automatically by artist and album (all though this was sometimes sporadic).	St
1.1.4	What I'm asking is if there is a way to turn on/off WMP's file organizing feature and how do I get it to organize my files?	St
1.2.1	WMP doesn't run very often on my computer.	St
1.2.2	Why use this program?	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
