It is bound to happen I suppose.
Of all the thousands of computers sold every year around the world by Dell, HP/Compaq, etc, some of them are bound to have faults.
It is the same with anything that is manufactured.
Sometimes they fail.
From my own experience I have now purchased 4 retail computers, from Packard Bell, HP, and Dell, and have had no problems with the machines themselves except old age.
If you are having problems, perhaps we can help?
There's a lot of free advice available on forums like these.
