you have to have the all carts installed as its seen as an error otherwise.
that's just the way it is.
now, if thew optional setting provide for a &quot;monochrome&quot; usage, set it and forget about, thus only black output.
provided it so optional, otherwise, you're stuck.
if truly all you ever do is print black, then look into a b&w laser printer as that will overall be cheaper to run and be very good on output speed and quality.
if you brought this ptr.
because it was cheap or on sale, then consider you made a bad decision and doing the above will correct for it.
however, many newer ink cart ptrs.
don't provide for black only output unless they are so optioned.
check the support website for details on any possible setting that may help for final quest.
fyi, i don't know of any gimmick that defeats the color output.
