DVD media rolled out at over 10 bucks a pop and stayed there for a few years till just recently.
I reserve dual layer for the few instances its needed.
-&gt; I'm found of a program called Alcohol 120% which can emulate a dual layer dvd media and drive so we can test burn and play a dual layer dvd without actually recording it onto real media.
A real time and money saver.
