I have a 250GB hard drive all set up with windows XP and norton ghost. Now I am trying to clone it to a brand new drive with no setup what so ever. The problem is, norton won't see the new drive. Which is weird since I did the exact same thing a couple of minutes ago with another blank drive and it worked just fine. thanks Ask if you need any more information.
