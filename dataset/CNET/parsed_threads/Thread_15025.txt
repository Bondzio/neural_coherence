<s> I'll soon be in the market for a new laptop and I've been wondering if there's much difference in performance between the pentium M and the Core2Duo (2.0Ghz). </s>
<s> I tend to use my notebook for graphics editing (Photoshop, Illustrator), medium gaming (aoe3, sims2), listening to music, and Internet. </s>
<s> It also seems like most laptops I look at either have a base Intel 950 or high-end geforce GPU, how would this factor into my needs when complemented by either of these CPUs? </s>
<s> Much better. </s>
