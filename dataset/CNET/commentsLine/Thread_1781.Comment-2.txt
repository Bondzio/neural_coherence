you don't have to use a data recovery program, that option is entirely yours to make.
but if you want this data back you either try those or send the drive to some data recovery business.
that 2nd option will cost a lot.
have a look at the software suggested in lost and found.
or the storage forum sticky, .
there are some good suggestions there, but which ones work best, if at all, can only be found by trying.
remember, you are unlikely to recover all your lost files.
i assume you have no backups?
