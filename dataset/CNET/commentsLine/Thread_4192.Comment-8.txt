usb 2.0 has max transfer rate of 480 mbits/s; ieee 1394b-2002 has 786.4 mbits/s.
wouldn't iomega or wd use slower drives for usb 2.0 external drives than they do for firewire 800 external drives, to minimize costs.
what would happen if i put a slower sata drive inside the firewire 800 external drive enclosure.
does it still work except for slower transfer; or my mac won't mount the drive on its firewire 800 port?
i'm interested because i'm looking for a fast firewire 800 external drive to make periodic bootable backups of the boot-disk on my macbook pro.
i think i need about 500gb to keep the most recent 2-3 bootable backups of my 200gb boot drive on my mac to recover from disk crash or system hang.
i already use an iomega ego 1tb mac edition for time machine backups.
is it wise to assemble my own firewire 800 external storage or buy one off the shelf?
my problem is mfgr's like iomega and wd don't give you enough details of the hard disk inside the box to compare.
i'm a computer hardware professional in a past life but is not sure how to make sense of the info published by hard drive manufacturers.
any recommendations for a refresher or tutorial.
