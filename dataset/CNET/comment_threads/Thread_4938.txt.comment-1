I have two (2) sticks of 512 MB DDR Ram.. One is PC3200 Apacer the other is PC2700 Crucial.
When I put the two together, it said Running at DDR 333 in DUAL CHANNEL MODE as I booted up.
The problem I have is when playing vice city, if I play for about 5 - 10 mins (it varys), then it will pop up with an error and say Unhandled Exception.
Also other things started to crash like MSN Messenger, and I wasnt even using it.
I removed the PC7200 ram and I played Vice City for 3 hours lol and it didn't have the error any more.
I just want to know why this is happening and if I get another stick of Apacer 512 PC3200 if the problem will go away or not :-| I have an AMD Athlon XP 2500 + and I know thats not where the instatability is at because its not overclocked and not overheating.
I have an NF7-S Abit Motherboard.
Thanks for any replys
