Windows only knows such about partitions.
It can't calculate anything about blank CDs or DVDs.
It doesn't know what kind of disk is in the drive at all.
I presume it defaults to CD because they've been around longer.
Only your DVD software can look at the drive to see if it's DVD capable and attempt to access the disk.
If nothing's on it, it cannot view it.
