hello, and thanks in advance for your time.
i'm running a dell latitude e6500, and ever since i pulled it out of the box a few days ago, the disk drive will not recognize new disks.
if an audio cd is in the drive, and i switch it to a data cd, it will not change the icon or name of the disk in the drive.
for example, if cd a is in the drive on boot, and ten minutes later i replace it with cd b, when i open computer i still see the information for cd a instead of the information for cd b. when i hit &quot;explore&quot;, however, i see cd b's data.
even after i have done this, cd a's information remains displayed.
i run windows vista ultimate, and the drive is an &quot;hl-dt-st dvd+-rw gsa-u20n&quot;.
i already checked for driver updates, loose contacts, and autoplay issues.
any help would be greatly appreciated, and as you can see, this is my first post on these forums, so if i left out any necessary information, let me know and i should get back to the thread within a short time.
