first, i had the hard disk on my dell optiplex break, no notice, it just stopped working.
the computer was just used for web browsing, so no important files to loose.
just last week my 3 month old external hard disk broke, and the bad part is that it was the actual drive, not the casing circuits.
i had just reformatted my laptop, and this was where all of my archived files were.
i just hope hitachi will send me a replacement, and i can find some software to recover the files.
