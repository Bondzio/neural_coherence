I think my earlier reply didn't go through, so ...
Thanks.
However, my question unfortunately was not academic - I am experiencing the exact symptoms I described so the situation is not a normal clock-throttling situation.
Basically, my question is: What hardware situation (and I'm 99.99% sure it is hardware)can produce these symptoms?
