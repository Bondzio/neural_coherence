you have to go inside the computer.
before you do, be certain that the power is completely off, by unplugging the power supply [or turning it off by the switch on the rear of the supply].
be aware that the computer always has some power on the mobo as long as the power supply is plugged in to a hot outlet.
[un less its switch is off].
when you take the cover off, be sure to touch some part of the metal chassis to ground yourself and discharge any static electricity that could damage components, touch the metal as frequently as possible.
the video card, of course, is the one that has the monitor cable connected to it.
remove the card and reinstall it physically.
the agp socket takes considerable force to engage the card fully.
