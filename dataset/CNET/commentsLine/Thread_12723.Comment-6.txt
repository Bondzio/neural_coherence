it recognized all the hardware which is what threw me initially.
i think i found the problem, i was able to view the hardware monitor and the cpu temps were in the high 80's and going up.
so it looks like the mb is defective and a replacement is in order.thanks for the suggestions rob, you always seem to have a good answer and i appreciate that.
