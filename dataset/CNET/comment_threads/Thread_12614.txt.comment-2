If purchasing a new desktop today, I'd start with an Intel Core 2 Duo CPU.
Entry level CPU is the E6300 (2MB L2 cache).
The E6600 fits my definition of a CPU sweetspot (4MB L2 cache).
It is the cheapest with 4MB cache, which translates into a nice performance bump.
Spending more money on the offered faster clock speeds doesn't give as much a performance bump.
Check the CPU CHARTS at TomsHardware.com for performance scores.
Now, tomorrow the sweetspot will be....
