I am having some issues with my Samsung HD 501 JK internal that came installed in my HP Pavillion a6500f.
I am very concerned that it is about to die.
After a little searching, I have read that even the replacements that Samsung sends out are junk.
Any suggestions on a different HD of similar size/speed to replace it with?
