i have an i/o magic dvd+rw+r external usb 2.0 duel format 8x dvd rewritable drive with instantcd/dvd and pinnacle studio 8 it use to work just fine till i put it up for awhile to get through the holidays now when i plug it up it will stay on for just a few minutes then go off and on.
i see an icon in the taskbar that says found new hardware.
i try to click on it but nothing happens finally it will show an icon to safely remove hardware what can i do to solve this problem
