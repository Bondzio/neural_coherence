<s> Looking for some input. </s>
<s> I have a desktop that is in need of an upgrade. </s>
<s> It runs fine but slow even if I am just browsing files in Documents or pictures. </s>
<s> Its an AMD Athlon (tm ) XP 1900+ 1.61 GHz., 256 GB of RAM. </s>
<s> What need to be upgraded? </s>
<s> Would I have to get a whole new motherboard or can I just upgrade the RAM and possible the processor? </s>
<s> My cousin built it and usually does upgrades but I am really into electronics and want to start learning on my own. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> I know you don't have 256GB of ram, no one has. </s>
<s> You meant 256MB of ram and all you posted suggests you have an older PC. </s>
<s> However, if possible increase ram itself, as I'm sure it should increase to at least 512MB or upto 1GB(guessing). </s>
<s> Yet, IMHO, just toss it. </s>
<s> Too much has taken place in the PC world. </s>
<s> Of course, if you can get this or that, upgrade the old PC. </s>
<s> But, if you can get your hands on a newer but yet 2-3yr. </s>
<s> old PC then you see far better improvement on that alone. </s>
<s> Check your local Craigslist or eBay if you like for what out's there. </s>
<s> Even, http://www.shopgoodwill.com has something to offer, worth the look or visit the local shop. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> to do (that it can't do now) and what's the budget for the upgrade ? </s>
<s> For example, if you want to play games with the PC, you need emphasis on the GPU. </s>
<s> Without knowing that, it's really hard to make recommendations that match the use or budget. </s>
