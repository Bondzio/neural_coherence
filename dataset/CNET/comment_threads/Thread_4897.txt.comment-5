you say your mobo suports &quot;266mhz, 533mhz, and 800mhz&quot;.
i think you're getting your terminology mixed up.
the ddr2 standards are: PC2-3200 200MHz DDR2-400 PC2-4200 266MHz DDR2-533 PC2-5300 333MHz DDR2-667 PC2-6400 400MHz DDR2-800 So memory running at 266Mhz is DDR2-533.
You should visit kingston.com or crucial.com, enter your motherboard or pc make/model and find out exactly what type of memory is compatible.
If ddr2-800 is supported by your motherboard, then you need to find out what your CPU's FSB is.
If its FSB is 533mhz, ddr2-800 is really overkill for it.
