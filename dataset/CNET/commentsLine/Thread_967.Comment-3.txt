i was thinking the same thing and loaded the drivers and software on the wireless laptop and still couldn't it to work.
a friend of mine has the same router and printer setup i do and has no trouble at all getting his wireless laptop to print.
the big difference is both his desktop and laptop are windows 7 home premium.
it must be a problem with windows 7 and vista not working with each other causing the problem.
the techs at bb said it wouldn't work, but they were also trying to sell me either a wireless print server or wireless printer.
i am going to another computer tech today that does this for his living and see what he says about it.
will let you know what he says.
