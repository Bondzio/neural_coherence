i have internet through cable provided by comcast.
ever since it's installation i am unable to get wireless access to my ibm r51 laptop (windows xp), although lan works perfectly.
i have netgear cable modem gateway cg814wg v2.
whenever i try to connect wireless, it initially shows that it's connected followed by the message &quot;limited or no connectivity&quot;.
however, the wireless works perfectly in my other dell notebook.
please help me find a solution.
