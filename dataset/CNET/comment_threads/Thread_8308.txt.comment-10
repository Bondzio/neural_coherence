Unfortunately, among all my old computers laying around, no PSU will fit properly into my daughter's case.
It's a PSU that mounts with a hinge and 2 screws.
I could prob.
rig it so that an old psu could hang by 2 screws, but I'd probably set the place on fire.
Will let ya know how it goes.
I have 1/2 mind of simply dragging the whole thing to the shop, but the owners aren't there where they'd prob fix the thing for nothing.
Will let ya know how it goes.
Thanks for input, Ray.
