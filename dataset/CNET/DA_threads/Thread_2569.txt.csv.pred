1.3.1	Even w/o O/C'ing , video issues are a problem should they arise .	St
1.3.2	All too often the makers themselves have done alot to give the best performance and more importantly , & quot ; stability & quot ; .	St
1.3.3	O/C'ing will increase unstability and really the reward is n't that much plus you may damage the video chipset or vram .	St
1.3.4	The other poster gave some links , follow them .	St
