1.1.1	Hello everyone , so I 'm looking into buying a powerline adapter and have narrowed down my decision to two possibilities : the TP-LINK TL-PA4010 AV500 or the TRENDnet TPL-406E2K AV500 .	St
1.1.2	The thing I 'm really concerned about is any disconnection problems - if the connection happens to drop for some reason , I would hope that it would be able to reconnect itself rather than having to manually plug it back in .	St
1.1.3	I know the TPL-406E2K has a high editor 's review on here , but the TL-PA4010 has more reviews on Amazon with a higher percentage of favorable reviews .	St
1.1.4	It 's hard to find any other sources of reviews on the latter though .	St
1.1.5	Any guidance about either would be greatly appreciated .	St
1.2.1	And never found them to drop UNLESS they are on different legs or AC phases .	St
1.2.2	That issue will dog powerline use for the current and future users .	St
1.2.3	As they document that , I 'll just note it and nod that all seem fine if they are on the same AC side .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I do n't have knowledge of either of those particular units , but I 've had luck with very similar adapters .	St
1.3.2	I 've never had a problem with disconnections .	St
1.3.3	The link was always solid .	St
1.3.4	Just remember to plug it directly into the wall and not into a surge protector or power strip .	St
1.3.5	Surge protectors will interfere with these devices , and you will very likely have issues if you do n't plug it directly to the wall outlet .	St
1.3.6	TP Link and Trendnet are both trustworthy to me ; I own networking gear from both companies .	St
1.3.7	I would recommend just relying on the reviews and be sure to purchase from a place with a good return policy should anything not work correctly .	Sug
1.4.1	For that matter , I would pay attention to those powerline adaptors that use AC pass-through .	St
1.4.2	These have an integrated AC socket which is infact filtered so as to ensure proper powerline-network throughput .	St
1.4.3	As well , you do n't forfeit an AC outlet just because you are using it for your powerline adaptor .	St
1.4.4	In a few markets , most notably UK and Europe at the moment , there are powerboards that have integrated powerline-adaptor functionality thus providing the functionality of both devices in one box .	St
