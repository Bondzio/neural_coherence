I have been all over looking for help on the web. HP will not help without paying more or will Geek Squad. I have a Linksys Router WRT54G that I am using and both wireless laptops connect to the internet fine, but just can't get a network. I have made sure all PCs have the same name and been through settings after settings. Can anyone help?

Your post writes you've researched this but not a word about it. I see nothing about firewalls either. More at http://www.vistax64.com/vista-networking-sharing/124061-network-discovery-between-vista-xp.html when the LLTD and more is covered. Bob

I try to connect to that Vista machine and get that message. BOB may not have an account on that Vista machine. It's simple if you think about it. Bob
