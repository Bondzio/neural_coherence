1.1.1	The door on my superdrive won't open using the button on the door or with eject from Toast software, I have a firewire drive attached and it does open from Toast.	St
1.1.2	Superdrive is a Pioneer DVR-103.	St
1.1.3	Computer is Power Mac G4 733 digital audio running OS X 10.2.8.	St
1.1.4	Drive shows up on system profiler and on Toast.	St
1.1.5	Do I have a bad drive?	St
1.2.1	I found the problem, the tray was jammed against a piece of plastic under the tray.	St
1.2.2	Fiddled a bit and unjammed it.	St
1.2.3	I do have another issue though.	St
1.2.4	In OS X the profiler says burning is fully supported but I can't burn files without making a disc image of the file first.	St
1.2.5	The disc works fine on the mac but doesn't read on a PC.	St
1.2.6	My version of Toast only works on classic, do I have to get Toast for OS X to burn cross platform discs?	St
1.3.1	This is probably a function of your old version of Toast.	St
1.3.2	You really should be moving away from anything &quot;Classic&quot;.	St
1.3.3	The OS X version of Toast will burn just about anything, including PC compatible disks, DVD, D/L DVD, CD and all the other neat stuff.	St
1.3.4	Toast 6 Titanium OS X version, is the earliest version you should be looking for but Toast 7 would be nice.	St
1.3.5	Happy burning P	St
