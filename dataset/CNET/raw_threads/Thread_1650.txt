I like the total price point I'm at, though I could deviate if I can get a nice performance boost if I spent a little more(meaning ~$100 more) - Intel Core 2 Duo E8400 3.0GHz 6MB L2 Cache LGA 775 65W Dual-Core Processor http://www.newegg.com/Product/Produc...82E16819115046 $189.99 -Corsair Dual Channel TWINX 2048MB PC6400 DDR2 800MHz E.P.P.

This will be for gaming and general purpose(Web Browsing, MS Office, etc). I do have one specific question... Is my RAM matched up well with my CPU? Or will the RAM speed be a major bottle neck? All other suggestions are appreciated.

And its performance with DDR3 is slower than DDR2! So, it's not buying you anything. The P35-DS3L is a bit faster. If you must have MatrixRaid, get MSI's P35-Neo2-FR ($110). Ultra's power supplies get very mixed reviews... some are good, some are crap. (check out jonnyguru.com, hardocp.com, and anandtech.com.) make sure that specific model has good marks or go with a better brand. antec tru power trio 650w, coolermaster's extremepower 650w, corsair's 650w, OCZ's gameXstream 700w are all about $90 after rebates. OCZ's 600w is one of the best power supplies for the money ($69 after rebate): http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817341010 if you're willing to spend the money saved on the gigabyte mobo, just get a 8800gts/512. as for ram, you could go for faster cl4, but it won't make hardly any difference. likewise, ddr2-1066 is faster but only noticeable in benchmarks. i'd pop 4gb in just since it's so cheap now and you won't have to crack the case open anytime soon.

9869	3	293254	2762881	2762722	ramarc	5/1/08 5:39 AM	1.20962034E12	3.16ghz e8500 is $275 vs 3.0ghz e8400 for $200	only 5.3% faster but 37.5% more expensive.

A more efficient power supply will use less energy. Think 70%+. The weight of it is also important. More weight the better the PSU. This is due to the the number of windings in the transformer. Power supplies are transformers they convert AC current to DC current. Windings defined: http://www.dictionary.net/winding This thread untracked.

9869	7	293254	2763409	2762980	ramarc	5/1/08 3:20 PM	1.2096552E12	your corsair ddr2-800 ram will work fine with either	the gigabyte or msi motherboards.

9869	9	293254	2763709	2763513	ramarc	5/2/08 5:17 AM	1.20970542E12	you also quadrupled your cost	those sticks are way overpriced . for that price you could get ddr2-1066 with the same 5-5-5-18 timings: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820227289 here's another ddr2-800 2x2gb kit with the same timings for $81: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820146693 tighter 4-4-4-12 timings are only a few bucks more: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820211282 p.s.: 4x1gb is fine if you run at stock speeds (and you don't seem to be interested in overclocking).

It actually comes out about the same. the rebate on the the RAM originally listed was good on only one of the sets. so I wasn't getting both sets for ~$30 for a total of $60 Also the RAM I'm getting is listed for more than I what I paid for it. I think an offer expired. Either way it was going to be ~$120. Also, a big factor in switching was that the corsair message boards were saying the MOBO I got didn't do well with all the slots filled up with the RAM i originally listed.
