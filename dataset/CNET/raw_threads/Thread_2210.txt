If you're gaming, then you're going to probably want the drives to be SATA as the throughput is greater on a SATA than it is on IDE. Now if you want to get crazy, you can invest in SCSI drives from Western Digital spinning at 10,000 rpm, the Raptor drives, then you'd need to bump your ram up to balance the sheer amount of throughput coming from the SCSI interface at 10,000rpm instead of the 7200rpm standard drive speed. As far as optical drives, either way isn't going to make that much of a difference as the read/write speed isn't going to change, just the transferring of that information.
