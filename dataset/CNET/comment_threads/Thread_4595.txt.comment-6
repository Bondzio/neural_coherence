I misread the sticker at first, because the input was 200W.
My PSU is 350 watts, so enough for the GT220.
I suppose the fan on that card is just broken or something.
A friend of mine recently gave me a HD6670 free of charge, which needs a 400W PSU.
Do you think my problem would be fixed if I bought a 500W Power supply and used that card?
Do you think its better to buy a more expensive branded PSU than a cheap one?
Thanks a lot for the help
