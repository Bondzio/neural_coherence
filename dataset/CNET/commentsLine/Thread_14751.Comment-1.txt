i bought a 320gb western digital scorpio blue hard drive (wd3200beve) for a laptop that died.
since then i have gotten rid of the laptop but wanted to use the hard drive externally for my pc for storage.
i bought a gigaware 2.5&quot; ide hard drive enclosure.
i set it up and the enclosure light turns blue.
the pc searched for the drivers for quite a while and failed.
from what i see on the wd website they don't offer drivers for external use of the hard drive.
any help is appreciated.
thanks.
