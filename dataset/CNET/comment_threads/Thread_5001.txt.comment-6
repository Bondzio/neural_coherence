Try GiMeSpace Desktop Extender.
It lifts all restrictions on the desktop size and your windows sizes.
Very handy for netbooks and other small screen computers.
It works like pan and scan but better because your desktop icons and taskbar stay always at the the same place.
Has also heaps of other powerfull options.
Works very well for me.
