1.1.1	Hi , I have a Dell Dimension 4600 purchaed 1 1/2 years ago .	St
1.1.2	About 2-3 weeks ago , I installsed a 200 GB Maxtor 7200 ATA 133 in the machine in addition to the 40GB original drive .	St
1.1.3	A week later , the system acted funny by making a sound ( HD ) and giving me the follwoing message : Primary drive 0 not found , strike the F1 key to continue , F2 key to run the setup utility .	St
1.1.4	The following morning the system worked fine .	St
1.1.5	A couple of days ago it came up with the message but it did not work in the morning .	St
1.1.6	I moved the controller wires around but no luck .	St
1.1.7	Any idea how I can get my machine working ?	Ques
1.1.8	At this time I will be happy with having access to my original drive ! !	St
1.1.9	Thanks Tinman6g	St
1.2.1	I am also a Dell Owner and recently installed an IDE in addition to my Serial ATA .	St
1.2.2	I began receiving a similar error but only after powering off the machine .	St
1.2.3	A restart would go cleanly so it appeared sporadic .	Sug
1.2.4	You will probably be able to duplicate this after a complete shutdown .	St
1.2.5	Anyway , I will make a couple assumptions .	St
1.2.6	1 ) You are installing a Serial ATA in addition to your Primary IDE Hard Drive .	St
1.2.7	Here is how I believe I resolved my issue .	St
1.2.8	Go into Bios - Press F2 for setup .	St
1.2.9	Serial ATA will probably say say Yes - Press the Space Bar and turn it Off .	St
1.2.10	You should see the Bios request status for two ATA drives .	St
1.2.11	Under your Serial ATA Drive 1 - set it to Auto ( so that it will autodetect on bootup . )	St
1.2.12	After rebooting , you should get a message 'new hardware found ' Shutdown and reboot the system .	St
1.2.13	Your F1/F2 to continue error should go away because you are forcing your system to recognize the hard drive in question and not confuse it with other .	St
1.2.14	If this still does n't work , a slightly riskier steup would be to set your Primary IDE Drive in Bios to Auto and make sure all Other IDE Drives ( Primary/Secondary ) are set to OFF .	St
1.2.15	Here is a link from Western Digital to look at for checking your jumper settings on your primary IDE drive .	St
1.2.16	http : //wdc.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wdc.cfg/php/enduser/std_alp.php ? p_cv=1.123 % 3B2.u0 & p_pv= & p_prods=0 & p_cats=123 & p_hidden_prods= & prod_lvl1=0 & cat_lvl1=123 & p_search_text=jumper+settings & p_new_search=1 & p_search_type=answers.search_fnl Best Wishes on resolving this .	St
1.2.17	I hope I helped a little .	St
1.2.18	Michael	St
1.3.1	I had this problem .	St
1.3.2	My research leads me to believe it is a common problem take a look at this link : http : //www.dataclinic.co.uk/maxtor-hard-disk-recovery.htm I rang these guys and they told me it is normally one of 2 things , if it is clicking or making a 'musical ' tone it is mechanical fault , if it is quiet then it is most likely a firmware fault .	St
1.3.3	No cheap way of fixing them unfortunately ! !	St
1.3.4	I do n't know what firmware is exctly in relation to a hard disk drive but there you go !	St
