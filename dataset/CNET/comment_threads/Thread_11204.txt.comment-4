While you can install the card if there is no ethernet connection in the machine, an unused ethernet can result in 10 minute or so &quot;freezes&quot; that confound owners.
You also may not be able to test the card, but absolutely can install it, the drivers and then disable it to sidestep the freeze and thaw that may happen.
