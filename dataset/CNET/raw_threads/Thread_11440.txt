After purchasing a Packard Bell I Extreme 6091 from a Big....... retailer I was assured of all the usual things, but when my Computer arrived from the Big....... retailer there was no operators manual and also when I log onto the Packard Bell Website to upgrade any drivers the Website tells me that the Serial number it finds is not recognisable and will not upgrade my Drivers. I contacted Packard Bell and the Big....... retailer and the one passed the Buck to the other and neither would help me out. So I will just have to treat this as a Lesson Learned and NEVER WILL I BUY ANOTHER PACKARD BELL AND MORESO NEVER WILL I deal with the Big....... retailer I hope a lot of you people out there recognise which Big....... retailer I am talking about. T. Quinn tomarin23@hotmail.com P.S. I would be grateful for an operators Manual and I would pay or could someone lend me their serial number so I can update my Drivers

After all, they give no support and how can you use it for the long term if you can't get vendor/OEM updates. Do this NOW! If you had this for a while, then google for PB support websites that are more friendly in providing some details on support and thier own files/pgms. etc.. Further, make sure that some info isn't provided on a resource CD of some kind, but you have to print it out. Check that. enjoy -----Willy
