<s> I bought a seagate 40gb hard disk.when i installed in my computer and later started to create partitions of 2 drives of 20gb each but it said that i have maximum availability of 5%.Please assist me what could be the problem in the hard disk? </s>
<s> First, is this going to be a master/boot drive or is it going to be a slave to one that already exists? </s>
<s> What disk are you using to create the partitions? </s>
<s> One that came with the harddrive from Seagate or a windows bootdisk? </s>
<s> What version windows is the bootdisk for and does it match with what you plan to install on the drive or already is installed on another drive? </s>
<s> If you are using this drive as a slave, are you accidently working with the boot drive and don't realize it? </s>
<s> TONI </s>
<s> it is the masterboot drive and i tried to create the partitions using windows bootable floppy disk which i created from win 98. </s>
<s> The &quot;later&quot; makes me wonder if you hadn't put something on the drive before trying to partition it. </s>
<s> have????? </s>
<s> There was a time when 2 GB was the limit in the BIOS. </s>
