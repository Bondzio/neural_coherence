Handle the hd with care, not touching the circuit board. Static elec. can damage the drive. However if Winxp is on the drive, don't expect it work in the old computer until it is formated, and the O.S. re-installed. XP won't boot in just any computer, unless it was installed with the drive in that machine. It looks for the same hardware as the original machine. When it's not the same, it balks.
