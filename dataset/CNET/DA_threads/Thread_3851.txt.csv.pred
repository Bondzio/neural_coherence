1.1.1	Thanks in advance for any help anyone could give me .	St
1.1.2	I am on an older Dell Desktop that does not have high speed USB 2.0 A lot of the External Hard Drives I see have 2.0 in the name .	St
1.1.3	For example a random google says & quot ; Toshiba 's 400GB USB 2.0 External Hard Drive & quot ; .	St
1.1.4	Does this mean it has to have a 2.0 drive to work ?	Ques
1.1.5	Secondly I am almost exclusively going to be storing music on this hard drive as a means of moving around my growing music collection .	St
1.1.6	Will moving music onto the hard drive and possibly back onto another computer degrade the quality of the track ?	Ques
1.1.7	And lastly if anyone could make recommendation for a good external hard drive that will work for my needs and computer it would be much appreciated .	St
1.1.8	I am running Windows XP and Service pack 2 , not a terribly old computer by some standards , it just does not have a 2.0 highspeed USB slot .	St
1.1.9	Thank you again for any help !	St
1.2.1	The USB 2.0 refers to interface between the external enclosure and the host PC system ... not the HDD itself .	St
1.2.2	Might consider getting a USB 2.0 Hi-Speed PCI card for your Dell to take greater advantage of the USB 2.0 speed ( 480Kbps ) over the older USB speed ( 40Kbps ) .	St
1.2.3	The difference is significant ... even if you 're not doing it for profit .	St
1.2.4	Just keep in mind ... it 's never ever safe to keep the only copy of your family photos , music , or anything else you can not afford to lose or easily replace on a single hard disk drive .	St
1.2.5	It can die , take a voltage spike , or succumb to a virus in an instant .	St
1.2.6	Re recommendations ... if you buy retail ( a fully assembled external enclosure with a hard drive installed ) ... I recommend Seagate or Western Digital .	St
1.2.7	If you build your own ... buy an enclosure and a hard drive of choice..I 'd pick Seagate or Western Digital drive and a brand name , quality enclosure .	St
1.2.8	The difference ... most Seagate and WD drive have 5 year and 3 year warranties respectively .	St
1.2.9	Most retail HDDs I see have one year warranties .	St

1.3.1	Thank you for the reply , so from what I gather you are saying a 2.0 drive will work with my computer I will just not be taking advantage of the fast speeds I could be if I had a 2.0 usb correct ?	Ques
1.3.2	My only other issue is the question about will storing music on an external hard drive degrade the quality of the music file if I was to move it between computers using the hard drive .	St
1.3.3	From what I have read and gathered it does not but I just wanted to ask to be sure as these things are not my expertise .	St
1.3.4	I planned to just copy My Music folder onto an External drive for a bit of extra protection as my collection is becoming large .	St
1.3.5	Thank you once again for your insight .	St
1.4.1	It 's an exact copy , like any copy of any file on any drive .	St
1.4.2	So no loss of quality .	St
1.4.3	Kees	St
1.5.1	Thank you for the reply , so from what I gather you are saying a 2.0 drive will work with my computer I will just not be taking advantage of the fast speeds I could be if I had a 2.0 usb correct ?	Ques
1.5.2	Quick answer ... & quot ; YES & quot ; But keep in mind mind ... & quot ; USB & quot ; is the interface standard between the external HDD enclosure and the PC ... . it has nothing to do with the drive itself .	St
1.5.3	Even faster is the eSATA interface and for future use ... it 's faster than USB 2.0 .	St
1.5.4	If possible ... get an external with USB 2.0 and eSATA .	St
