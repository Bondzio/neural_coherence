few, if any, of that hp software you run is tied to the motherboard.
that's proven by the fact that it still seems to run with the new motherboard.
the only 2 advices that can be given: 1. only run the software you need.
2. repeating what bob said: this isn't hardware issue, and any more software oriented forum would want to know what exact software you mean.
