1.1.1	So i have a wireless network connection and a LAN connection and they are both displayed under the network bridge section in the Network Connections window, however, there is no bridge icon so i cant disable the &quot;bridge&quot; or configure my network adapters by themselves.	St
1.1.2	Is there another way to disable the bridge that doesn't seem to exist?	St
1.1.3	Ive tried a method that dealt with the registry and it removed the bridge but screwed up the adapters so i had to run a system restore and so im back to where i started.	St
1.1.4	what it looks like... http://img216.imageshack.us/img216/5017/89979969fl3.jpg thanks	Polite

1.4.1	I am not trying to bridge anything.	St
1.4.2	I am trying to disable the bridge but as shown in the pictures there is no bridge icon.	St
1.4.3	That prevents me from disabling the &quot;bridge&quot; or seperately modifying the adapters to turn off the ICS option.	St
1.4.4	I would like to stop this bridge so i can configure my netowrk adapters.	St
1.5.1	For me I went to the Add Remove Programs page and uninstalled ICS.	St
1.5.2	That turned it off.	St
1.5.3	Sorry, I missed that you installed ICS in your first post.	St
