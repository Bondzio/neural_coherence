3898	0	597929	5480787	NR	heehee62	7/25/13 4:50 PM	1.374771E12	Why does my router keep disabling itself?	Have a Belkin Play N600 router with Tomato v 1.28 on it. Both the 2.4 and 5 ghz frequencies often seem to reduce throughput speeds substantially when I use them and then completely disable completely (both bands disable at same time even when I'm using just one). To get back online, I have to either turn on/off router or manually enable the wireless bands again through a wired connection and the tomato GUI. What's going on?

Many of the other images overclock the CPU or just have a bug. When the office see any of those custom images we swap in a stock router. Bob

Folk that install that (these are called images, roms, flash and such) usually are experts at such a thing. As it stands you have a router that no one could support. And yes that's what I said. Bob

Long ago DDNS was not done on a router so I'm left to guess you wanted it on the router. But fast forward to today I no longer need DDNS as I solved my need in new ways. Bob
