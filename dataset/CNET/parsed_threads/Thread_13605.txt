<s> Hi we are looking to get a new PC would anybody be able to advise if we should get HP Pavilion All in One MS210 or perhaps Dell Inspiron One 19 - we need it mainly for sufing the internet, downloading itunes, photos and the odd letter writing. </s>
<s> Ideally something basic and not complicated to use - any advice would be much appreciated </s>
<s> I doubt that ease of use changes with model to model as they are all basic Windows once you remove the name tag. </s>
<s> The makers are not altering the Windows experience so ease of use is something I'd have to put aside during the purchase cycle. </s>
<s> For ease of use I'd have to go with Apple. </s>

<s> Given the two models you have narrowed it down to I would suggest the Dell. </s>
<s> I am a computer specialist at the school I attend so I have worked on every brand of computer. </s>
<s> I own three dells and an apple. </s>
<s> Based on specification the dell is a bit more expensive but offers a much more robust and powerful machine. </s>
<s> Also, HP computers tend to come with a ton of applications that clog up your computing experience. </s>
<s> Dell is a much simpler computer to use. </s>
<s> That being said. </s>
<s> If you are looking for simplicity, I would agree with the previous message. </s>
<s> Buy an apple. </s>
<s> It might be a bit more expensive but a baseline mac mini will perform in step with each of the computers you mentioned. </s>
<s> And it will offer a longer shelf life. </s>
<s> Coming from someone who repairs computer for a living, you should buy a mac. </s>
