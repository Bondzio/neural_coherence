to give a sound card last rites, i boot up a knoppix cd and test the functions.
as to the dvd, i must write that i can't help you with your dvd decoder board issues.
that technology was nice, but can strain support and i don't want to deal with them anymore.
we install a new dvd drive (20 bucks in bulk) and then a software player.
somewhere past 600mhz, dvd playback via all software began ot work.
there are a few that cling to the hardware cards and we let them cling, but find it best to pretend we know nothing about them.
it's not that we don't, it's the hours making it work is costly, then they want you to fix it everytime it breaks again for free.
so the standing order is to &quot;know nothing.&quot; hope this sheds some light on the issue.
