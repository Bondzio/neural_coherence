I recently changed the settings of my ethernet adapter.
I don't remember what I have done and I don't know the default values.
I went to the Device Manager and changed the advanced settings of Marvell Yukon 88E8056 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Adapter.
Please tell me the default values so that I can change it back I am using Windows Vista Service pack 2 Your help will be appreciated Chris christarzan@gmail.com
