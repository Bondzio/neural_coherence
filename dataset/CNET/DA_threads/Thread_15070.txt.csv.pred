1.1.1	I have a Mac Mini, running OS X and for ages I have been using an external drive for transferring pictures and videos between friends and family and for backups of a few documents for work etc.	St
1.1.2	I have never had any trouble using the drive and it has always worked OK.	St
1.1.3	The drive is an unknown brand, but for a few years it has worked with no problems.	St
1.1.4	I took the drive round to my girlfriends house to transfer some pictures and I lost my cable somewhere between my house and hers.	St
1.1.5	The cable supplied with the drive was a USB 2.0, and went from USB A male one end to 2x USB A male on the other end.	St
1.1.6	One of which I would use to transfer files over.	St
1.1.7	The other just seemed useless and I never plugged it in to any USB port.	St
1.1.8	I replaced the cable with a single USB 2.0 cable and the drive powered up, all lights flashing, but nothing appeared on screen.	St
1.1.9	I tried it on my housemates laptop, and my brothers laptop, both running Windows Vista.	St
1.1.10	The laptops both installed drivers, and told me that everything was OK - good to go - but then nothing appeared on those either.	St
1.1.11	Does anyone have any idea what is wrong with the hard drive?	Ques
1.1.12	I assume it is the type of cable that I have bought, as it was working fine before I lost the cable and replaced it with a single USB lead?	St
1.1.13	Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!	Polite
1.1.14	Thanks to anyone who can help out!	Ques
1.1.15	!	St
1.2.1	If via USB you'll need a power source or the right USB cable.	St
1.2.2	This can confuse some since it might power up but fail when used.	St
1.2.3	BTDT, Bob	St
1.3.1	Isn't USB already powered?	St
1.3.2	The hard drive isn't seperately powered, and only uses 1 cable?	St
1.3.3	Are there different types of USB cable I am unaware of?	St
1.4.1	One USB port is only 500 milliamps and every drive I see needs a little more than that.	St
1.4.2	So that is they they had two USB connections.	St
1.4.3	I think you found the cause.	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
