<s> Anyway I am having a problem with the computer power switch. </s>
<s> I have an emachines W3080 and it's about two years old. </s>
<s> Lately the power switch seems to be getting stuck in the case a lot. </s>
<s> When you push it to turn it on, it's not coming back out it stays there for some reason. </s>
<s> Not all the time but a lot. </s>
<s> I was wondering if anyone else had this kind of problem and what they did to correct this issue? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>

<s> You should check the &quot;fit&quot; of the power sw. to the case. </s>
<s> Not always but sometimes, a physical obstruction due the case skin or path is causing the sw. to be stuck. </s>
<s> You can better fit the case(relocate) for the best operation, plus clean and lube(use spray wax) to lessen stickness. </s>
<s> However, some sw. do surcome to wear&tear and replacement is recommended, of course you then need eMachine support for that. </s>
<s> These sws. </s>
<s> are simple in design and offer little in repair but replace and above advice. </s>

<s> If I would get it fixed I would probably have to do that, being I don't like to mess around with hardware. </s>
<s> I'm kind of a computer dummy when it comes to that, I would be to afraid to open the power case. </s>
<s> Thank you for giving me some advice though on what to do. </s>
<s> Do you know how much this would cost in the end? </s>
<s> Would that be expensive to do? </s>
<s> Thank you for your help. </s>

<s> Mostly the 'button' is a round blob of badly molded plastic secured with two lesser blobs to some arbitrary part of the case front. </s>
<s> I know, because the slot button on my Sony DVD writer broke, and wouldn't eject (it did on command in 'My Computer') I had to stick cardboard behind to force it forwards. </s>
<s> Works fine, but shouldn't be necessary. </s>
<s> This isn't that time consuming if that's what it is. </s>
<s> You should expect at least 30-min billing or an 1hr. </s>
<s> if that's the minium amount to bill or along those lines. </s>
<s> If you have a more computer savy friend, it's a straightfoward attempt to correct if a physical thing. </s>
<s> Check eMachine support website for any &quot;graphic&quot; displays or part diagrams/exploded views if available. </s>
