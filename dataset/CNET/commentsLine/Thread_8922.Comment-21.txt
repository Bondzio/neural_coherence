i bring my laptop.
we plug directly into the isp's supplied gear.
if that drops, it's an isp issue and we are done.
if it's fine, then you try their pc plugged directly into the gear.
you might have to go back and forth a few times but if the line drops on the client's pc then you have a very odd issue.
since it is possible to tell a device to reset or drop you pull out a bootable os such as ubuntu to load up and download a file.
that test is crucial to tell if the pc has some odd issue.
the neat part about this sort of work is the pay is good.
you get to be nice as possible and the meter runs all the time.
i've seen the meter exceed two thousand bucks on such a call.
