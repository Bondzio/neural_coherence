i was watching a tech-tv show a while back and they were talking about hd's and ata100 vs ata133.
what they were saying was in their tests they saw very little diff.
however they did see a diff with hd cache size, bigger is better.
so if you want to run the tech-tv benchmarks get the bigger cache.
do you need the bigger cache to run your stuff??
i have no idea.
i'm thinking most folks won't see a diff.
