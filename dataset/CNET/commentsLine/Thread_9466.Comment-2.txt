you can try to add that to the list.
it's possible to set up multiple hardware profiles with xp that would allow you to run with different settings in different locations but i can't give step by step instruction.
some laptops come with software that will do similar.
i know lenovo uses something called &quot;access connections&quot; which assists travelers to set up networking profiles that can be switched easily.
you might check to see if your ip department can set that up for you.
