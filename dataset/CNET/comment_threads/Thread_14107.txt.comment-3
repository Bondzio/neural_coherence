I'm just curious about what &quot;data&quot; really is.
======= Think about it like this.
Data is characters...A&gt;Z...0&gt;9...etc.
Movies are data.
Does an unformatted 200GB hdd weight less than the same drive filled with movies?
======== Think about it like this.
A new unformatted HD is filled with something...let's call it blanks.
If you send a movie/data to the HD you 'change' the blanks to data.
Blanks and data weigh the same.
