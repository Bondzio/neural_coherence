i realize you are probably trying to build the cheapest upgrade possible, but shaving $50 dollars off of the price means degrading pretty severely in performance.
i don't know what you use your computer for (gaming, office, home theater, etc.)
so it's kind of hard to make a solid recommendation.
the cpu/mobo combo i listed above is what i would call a budget, best-bang-for-the-buck, upgrade.
if you want nothing to do with gaming or multimedia then you could easily get a celeron d and save another $50 or so.
the pci-express thing is more about &quot;room to grow&quot;, agp is an eol (end of life) technology, which means that at some point graphics card vendors are going to stop producing cards that use the agp bus.
if you at some point to want to upgrade your video card, you could end up having to do a complete system upgrade.
as a stop-gap, inexpensive upgrade however an agp motherboard is fine.
as for dual core (64bit extensions are not as important for your needs i would think); it's pretty much the industry standard now and for $120 is a helluva deal.
