i have been trying to find the binary file for an old soyo bios - 5eh-1bc1.bin - no luck, even from the 'obsolete' section on the soyo website!
my old pc is working fine, but won't recognise hard drives over 40gb.
so i've a choice between using a smaller (second user) drive, or buying a new motherboard.
any other suggestions?
hope the question's clear enough; i'm new round here cheers, sj
