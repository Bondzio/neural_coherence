1.1.1	I have searched high and low on here for this answer .	St
1.1.2	Got close but no cigars .	St
1.1.3	Anyway .	St
1.1.4	We just bought an external hard drive ( Seagate-desk 500gb ) .	St
1.1.5	We have moved a bunch of music , pictures , documents and other stuff to it .	St
1.1.6	What I 'd like to know is , will it copy the same file or program again and again or will it know that it is already on there and move past it ?	Ques
1.1.7	Just as when downloading pictures from our camera to the desktop , it will only download the new pictures .	St
1.1.8	Do these hard drives operate the same way ?	Ques
1.1.9	This thing came with no directions except how to connect it and plug in the power .	St
1.1.10	Then you visit their site which spins you in circles .	St
1.1.11	Thanks for any help	St
1.2.1	works exactly like an internal drive .	St
1.3.1	that depends on what you copy .	St
1.3.2	If you choose to copy files that already exist on the target drive , they will be copied again .	St
1.3.3	So it 's totally up to you .	St
1.3.4	Of course , there 's backup software that you can use to copy only changed or new files .	St
1.3.5	Your choice to use them or not to use them .	St
1.3.6	Did you already know that external drives are much less reliable than internal drives .	St
1.3.7	If you do n't believe me count the number of posts in our Storage forum about the theme & quot ; I ca n't access my external drive & quot ; .	St
1.3.8	So it 's essential to have more copies of your data ( for example , burned to DVD ) than just on such a drive .	St
1.3.9	You say & quot ; move & quot ; ; that means they are no longer on your internal hard disk .	St
1.3.10	Otherwise you should have said & quot ; copy & quot ; .	St
1.3.11	That 's an essential difference !	St
1.3.12	Let me hope that you choose the wrong word , not the wrong action .	St
1.3.13	Kees	St
1.4.1	The reason your documentation with the external HD did not cover subjects such as & quot ; copy , replace , or restore & quot ; is because the HD is not involved in the decision of which to do .	St
1.4.2	It does what it is told to do .	St
1.4.3	Some application on your PC , either at your direction or by its own default , will make that decision .	St
1.4.4	Typical PC copy/paste operations generally give you one opportunity to select replace , replace all , ignore , or ignore all .	St
1.4.5	If you choose either of the & quot ; all & quot ; functions , then all files that are on the drive and also being moved will be treated that way , Otherwise , you will be given one opportunity per file , to select & quot ; replace & quot ; or & quot ; ignore & quot ; .	St
1.4.6	And , if you are moving lots of files , you will tire quickly of this option .	St
1.4.7	Unix and derivatives like Linux generally have utilities ( rsync , e.g . )	St
1.4.8	that can automatically over-write only files that have since been updated , while leaving others untouched .	St
1.4.9	Speeds up archiving dramatically .	St
1.4.10	However , although it seems likely there would be something similar for Windows , I am not aware of it .	St
1.5.1	On nearly every file system I have ever worked with , including Mac , Windows , and Linux , if you paste a file in a folder and then you attempt to paste ( or move ) another file with the identical name , it will ask if you want to replace the first one or cancel the second one .	Sug
1.5.2	If you are moving or copying a bunch of files and just a few are already in the file where you are moving them to .	St
1.5.3	then the same window will pop up asking you if you want to replace ( or overwrite ) the existing file or skip on to the next file without pasting that identical file a second time .	Sug
1.5.4	You can even check a box so it will take the same action for all you are trying to move when a copy already exist , so you do n't have to sit there and press the same button again and again .	St
1.6.1	I have found that it depends upon which directory you send the info to .	St
1.6.2	I keep all my data in My Documents and just copy the whole file to my External Hard Drive .	St
1.6.3	When i copy new data to the file it tells me thier is already a file with this name etc .	St
1.6.4	If i just paste the whole file it asks should i copy the old date Just copying the whole file will update the file in your back up .	St
