Guidance and advice please: I have a rather old desktop, with PC2100 2600 MHz DDR memory.
I cannot find a good deal for this obsolete memory, but I can find many good deals for later RAM versions such as PC2700 or later versions.
QUESTION: will a PC2700 DDR memory card work when installed into the memory slot of my desktop's motherboard?
Thank you in advance for any advice, thank you.
