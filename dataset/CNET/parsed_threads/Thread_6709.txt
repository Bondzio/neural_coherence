<s> Thanks for whomever reads this. </s>
<s> I bought a computer back in '99 and it hasn't given me much problems. </s>
<s> i currently have a 400MHz Intel Celeron processor and I was thinking of buying a new motherboard, preferably a MSI. </s>
<s> I was just wondering that if I did find a board with a Celeron compatibility, could I just take off the processor of my current board and just transfer it over. </s>
<s> Does pin number count? </s>
<s> Keep in mind this was purchased back in '99 from Gateway. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> If using the same processor? </s>
<s> You must get one that supports use of the Socket that the CPU uses, probably a socket 370. </s>
<s> Not quite sure where you would get any improved performance unless your present mobo doesn't support the maximum FSB and use faster memory that the 400 MHz CPU can support. </s>
<s> The best solution in your case would probably be to buy a new system. </s>
<s> You and now find reasonably fast systems for a little over $300. </s>
<s> But if you really want to upgrade then read the following reply. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, any decent MSI motherboard that you purchase will have a socket 478 CPU socket for Pentium processors. </s>
<s> I have never seen an adapter than could make a Slot CPU(like your Celeron I presume) work on a Socket 478 motherboard. </s>
<s> That means your CPU simply would not be compatible. </s>
<s> A couple of years ago there were a few models of hybrid motherboards and CPU adapters(daughterboards) that were marketed to people looking to switch from older processors to new designs. </s>
<s> Today there are not as many solutions. </s>
<s> One of the reasons for this is the variable power requirements of the different CPUs. </s>
<s> My suggestion to you is that you think about upgrading a couple of other parts such as the CPU and and memory. </s>
<s> As for memory, most motherboards today use DDR SDRAM rather than the single-rate memory that you probably have in your gateway. </s>
<s> And as for the CPU, you could easily upgrade to a socket 478 CPU such as a Celeron 4 without spending too much. </s>
<s> Here's an example of a sufficient CPU Upgrade. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=19-112-169&depa=1 I would suggest more if I had more information about your computer usage requirements. </s>
<s> 256 MB of RAM is a sufficient amount of RAM. </s>
<s> If you plan on running anykind of graphically intense programs such as games, then 512 MB atleast is what I recommend. </s>
<s> It really all depends on your spending budget. </s>
<s> The CPU and Memory upgrades would add just over 100+ dollars to your current spending budget. </s>
<s> The performance increase is well worth it. </s>
<s> However, as I said, the best solution would be to look for new computer system rather than spend your hard-earned money on upgrades that may need to be replaced again in less than a year. </s>
<s> You may find a new mtrbd. </s>
<s> that accepts your old cpu(just ask), but believe me you're better off starting anew. </s>
<s> Plainly, its time to move on as that cpu is very dated and any new offering are at least 2-cpu generations ahead. </s>
<s> Look for a kit, that's made of a cpu and mtrbd. </s>
<s> together being the best value for you as well as being ATX ready(your system capable of that?). </s>
<s> Further, you can still find bargains out there, e-Machines being well within or lower $500 range. </s>
<s> HP and Dell offer similar deals at least in the $700 or less range. </s>
<s> Monitor may or may not be included but if anything you can carry-over the old monitor to new system. </s>
<s> You could shop for a &quot;used&quot; system that's at least 800-1ghz or better by buying just the &quot;box&quot; of a working system, again re-using your old kybd, monitor, etc.. You can try here for that: http://www.computersurplusoutlet.com http://www.pcliquidator.com or similar sources. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> I presumed that your CPU is a Slot 1 CPU for I have never worked with a Celeron of that age and speed that used a socket. </s>
<s> If you did manage to find a compatible motherboard with compatible socket/slot and the correct voltage requirements then, you could easy swap the motherboard out with no problems. </s>
<s> Pin count does matter. </s>
<s> While it might seem reasonable to put a CPU in a socket with more pins, you can not. </s>
<s> Other than that, just make sure that the motherboard supports the type of memory that you are using. </s>
<s> Make sure that the board is exactly compatible with your CPU and not a similar model based on a different core with different voltage requirements. </s>
<s> (undervoltage/overvoltage can cause bad result for your CPU) </s>
