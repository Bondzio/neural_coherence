oh lol.
found the solution on some european world of warcraft forum.
apparently there's some glitch with the .exe file intel's update uses that makes vista unhappy.
so i had to download the zip file for the 945gm driver, and then tell the driver to update from a disk, but actually find the place where i extracted the zip file to and say that's where it should update from.
specifically a .inf file in the extracted updater.
tricky.
so yeah nothing wrong with driver or hardware or anything.
just vista + intel = stupid.
the forum was  if anyone wants to read up on it more.
so yay happy ending.
my video driver is now up-to-date.
thanks for your effort and patience rob.
