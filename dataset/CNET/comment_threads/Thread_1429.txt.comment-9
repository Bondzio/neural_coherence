i did try changing the speed thru jumper setting and software settings.
i never knew if either action actually did anything but neither made the drive be recognized by the bios.
i gave up on the sata drive and ordered an ide drive i hope it works but now im nervous about it.
at 60 bucks each plus another 50 for some memory, i am starting to think i should have just bought a new computer.
