1.1.1	& lt ; span & gt ; I 'm buying a larger fan for my computer .	St
1.1.2	It has a 4 pin connection , but all the fan 's I 'm seeing online has a & quot ; round & quot ; pin instead of a & quot ; Square & quot ; pin connection .	St
1.1.3	Below is what mine looks like .	St
1.1.4	http : //img.misco.eu/resources/images/products/106/SRH/FA/FAN4EXT12//FAN4EXT12_500x500 .	St
1.1.5	But this is all I 'm seeing online ( Round hole ) : http : //www.dvinfo.net/forum/attachments/non-linear-editing-pc/7552d1210860165-powering-two-9800gtx-gpus-enough-connectors-800px-molex_female_connector.jpg Will it work ?	Ques
1.2.1	http : //www.9mart.com/9dollar/Budget/EG1121-23-4pin-cable.jpg	St
1.3.1	If I could not find the fan I wanted with the proper connector I do n't think it would take me very long to cut+splice the connector from the old fan to the new fan .	St
1.3.2	Looks like a 4 wire & gt ; 4 wire splice job .	St
1.3.3	The molex/round pin is a common connector .	St
1.3.4	That square pin connector may be a specialty item .	St
1.4.1	Yes I could get all technical on you but that one is so you can tap power from the usual ATX power supply .	St
1.4.2	The square one looks to be the rare 4 pin that has RPM and possibly temperature sensing .	St
1.4.3	I wo n't discuss the latter without full details on the host PC .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	I have a acer aspire x1430g tower .	St
1.5.2	It only has a small cpu fan , and the same size exhaust fan..	St
1.5.3	So I bought a 120mm fan for intake on the side of the case but did n't realize it has & quot ; Round & quot ; pin holes .	St
1.5.4	Do you know if there is an adapter I can buy ?	Ques
1.5.5	Or ?	Ques
1.5.6	I only paid $ 4 for the fan so it 's not like I 'm out anything but would still like to use it .	St
1.6.1	I would splice wires , but there is no fan connected to it .	St
1.6.2	It just has a plug in on the mobo .	St
1.7.1	You just said that the 120mm fan you bought has the & quot ; round hole & quot ; ( molex ) type but , earlier , it sounded like your connector was square .	St
1.7.2	Your link in the first post was dead so is your second post link what you actually have or the type you think you need ?	Ques
1.7.3	If you have the standard molex type , only two of the pins will be wired as this type connects directly to your PS an not on the motherboard .	St
1.7.4	It wo n't be speed controlled unless it has internal circuitry to do so or a speed selector switch .	St
1.7.5	If the molex type , you connect it to the PS with no special adapter needed .	St
1.7.6	Most such fans I 've seen already have a adapter if no free PS plugs exist .	St
1.8.1	Sorry for the confusion .	St
1.8.2	It 's a Pita to post stuff on here when you ca n't edit your posts .	St
1.8.3	Anyways , I have 2 connections on my motherboard .	St
1.8.4	One is the & quot ; CPU & quot ; fan which is a & quot ; Square & quot ; 3 pin , and the other is a & quot ; System & quot ; fan ( What it shows in Bios ) connection that is a & quot ; Square & quot ; 4 pin ( Same as the picture in post # 2 ) The issue is , the fan I bought has a Molex plug in .	St
1.8.5	I found an adapter that should hook up to the mobo and use the molex fan .	St
1.8.6	And like you said , it seems I ( The Mobo ) wo n't be able to control the fan speed if I went that route correct ?	Ques
1.8.7	It looks like I can buy a touchscreen fan controller but if I 'm running just 1 fan it seems kind of pointless .	St
1.9.1	http : //www.manualowl.com/m/Acer % 20Computers/Aspire-X1430G/Manual/257842 ? page=92 If you want to forgo the PWM , Sensor you can use a standard fan connected to the PSU but that 's your decision .	St
1.9.2	Bob	St
1.10.1	I 'm going to have to see on that .	St
1.10.2	I am not seeing a molex connection coming off of my PSU .	St
1.11.1	Example at http : //www.amazon.com/Cables-To-Go-Internal-Multi-Color/dp/B00007JO36/ These are pretty abundant at most computer shops .	St
1.11.2	Bob	St
1.12.1	Unless it 's hidden behind my CD driver I am not seeing any spare molex connectors .	St
1.13.1	And they have splitters for SATA power too .	St
1.13.2	If this is too hard , find a friend that has built PCs before and have a chat about power splitters .	St
1.13.3	Bob	St
