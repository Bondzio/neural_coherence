Hi, I have a problem in the way i have now set up my network can not get the computers in the kids bed rooms to print. I have a connection from Virgin Media cable comes into a wireless router and the printer is connected to this (HPCM3530). Then as the signal is not good up stairs i have taken a connector from this router to a home plug via the mains. Then up stairs i have connected a wireless router to the home plug and all the kit upstairs connect to the net fine wirelessly on this router. However i can not see the printer. If i try to ping it i just get time out. Is there anyone can point me in the right direction please? Andy
