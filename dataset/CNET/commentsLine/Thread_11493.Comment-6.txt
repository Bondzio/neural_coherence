john, i appreciate the info you have provided also...but the new cord seems to have fixed the problem.
i guess a new cord would have fixed the adaptor end you were talking about too!
as to the uninstalling being a problem, dealing with my cd rom issue taught me that this is much more of a problem than i ever imagined.
i will check this out if the problem crops up again.
thanks everybody for their help!
jackie
