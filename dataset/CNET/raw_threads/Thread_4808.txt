I have downloaded John Haller's portable Firefox,Thunderbird, and Sunbird. They work fine but Haller and PC mag in their article on same recommend creating a root directory for the drive but do not tell how to do it. Is anyone out there using portable apps who knows how to create a root (C?) directory for this drive? I've just downloaded another portable app from Haller and he talks about unzipping this file into the profile of the earlier Firefox version. I know how to unzip files, how to delete on the flash drive but that is the extent of my knowledge. I think the directory will create a way to bring the drive up on my PC and will make updates and changes possible----not sure. My CompUSA drive does not require drivers. How to make the directory? Do I really need one and will it change anything about the portability of the flash drive? I've Googled and can't find any answers. Please help. Donna

Perhaps it is my fault for not stating my problem correctly. On my own I found a link from PC Magazine that explains WHAT I want to do but not HOW to do it. Here is the link: http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1846801,00.asp Since my familiarity with Windows Explorer is limited I would like some honest help with my problem. I like learning new things and this flash drive is a new toy I sincerely want to learn to work with.

Proffitt	9/21/05 8:25 AM	1.1272911E12	Thanks for the link.	http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1846801,00.asp on the first page doesn't mention this need to create a root entry. Compassion has little to do with this discussion. If you want to discuss that, please note so and we'll go down that road. -&gt; In short, all drives we use already have a top or root directory. Your basic books on Windows, Dos should cover this in depth. If you need NEWBIE information, just ask for it in the Newbie Forum. You posted in a not-newbie forum so the shorter answers will come first to see if that suffices. From there we expand on the discussion. Some will expect long detailed answers but this will not happen since all replys are from volunteers. This is not tech support, but where we discuss the topic and dig into it and hopefully come away with some answers. If you want tech support.... --&gt; &quot;To do all this, create a text file named Autorun.inf in the drive's root directory, with contents something like this&quot; That's on the second page of the article. It did not ask you to create the root directory, but to place the items there. This is bashing words but we must be careful and read the sentance with care and double-so if we copy that elsewhere. In closing, you have the root directory. It's the top or the one with just the backslash. Hope this helps. Bob
