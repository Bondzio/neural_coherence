and this discussion has so little detail about the setup that i can't offer much more.
that is, do you feel that a member should post no details, get asked, then begin or should the member go ahead and share the details and skip the first round?
in closing, did you try turning off vista's broadcast flag?
and if you want a direct link, i'm going to bow out.
that flag on vista is widely discussed and quite a pain.
in closing, why dig up an old thread when you have a new issue?
