I have long sough an automated CD/DVD duplication system that is capable supporting continuous CD reloading while the system is copying and be able to sort out bad copy from a good copy.
The MicroOrbit by MicroBoards is the closes product I can find but it doesnt do what I want.
Does anyone know of a company that makes one?
