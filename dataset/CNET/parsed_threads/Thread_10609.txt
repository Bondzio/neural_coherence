<s> I have lost the use of the Geforce graphics card I installed over a year ago. </s>
<s> I have an IBM Netvista with Windows ME o/s. </s>
<s> I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but windows keeps defaulting back to the Intel video card the computer came with. </s>
<s> I can not figure out how to disable the Intel card and enable the GeForce card so that my system defaults to it. </s>
<s> When I plug my monitor into the GeForce card I get a blank screen. </s>
<s> I have to plug back into the original port to see anything on the monitor. </s>
<s> I am as fustrated as can be. </s>
<s> Any ideas are welcome. </s>
<s> Thanks, Todd </s>
<s> Did you try going to control panel, system, device manager, click on display adapter, highlite the intel graphics controller click properties uncheck the box that says exists in all profiles? </s>
<s> Try that or highlite the intel graphics controller and click remove. </s>
<s> Try to update your driver from the nVidia web site. </s>
<s> I believe the new driver is 56.04. </s>
<s> If not it will tell you the latest driver. </s>
<s> You might have a conflict problem running both devices. </s>
<s> Good luck hope I was able to help. </s>

<s> Ken, Yes, I tried exactly what you discribed. </s>
<s> Everytime the system finishes it says that it must restart in order to complete changes. </s>
<s> When it restarts, it reloads the hardware and software for the intel video card. </s>
<s> I went on their website asking for assistance but was disappointed with the results. </s>
<s> Thanks for the comments. </s>
