<s> I have an hp pavillion dv6000 with vista premium, and use a wireless conection. </s>
<s> It all worked fine until one day the wlan disappeared! </s>
<s> It doesn't even show it in device manager, nor in the &quot;view network connections,&quot; and the wireless switch doesn't do anything. </s>
<s> It also doesn't load hp wireless assistant anymore... No hardware problems, and I'm pretty sure I didn't manually change anything... any ideas? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> ...control Panel/Network Connections ? </s>
