I am using a Huawei USB wireless modem to connect to the Internet on my iMac (OSX 10.6.4).
I am trying to share that connection via AirPort to my PowerBook (OSX 10.4.11).
My PowerBook recognises the AirPort network but will not access the Internet.
If I put the modem on the PowerBook and share it back to the iMac it works.
I do not want to leave the modem in the PowerBook because my toddler uses it, and, well, she will destroy the modem!
Can anyone help me please?!?
!
