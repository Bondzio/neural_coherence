hi arrow new computer or upgrade: ''the right time to buy is when you need it!''
&gt;&gt; that is really the only factor.
every day you hear about something new and often it sounds better than what you have now.
i still have my 1st computer, works with twin 360k floppy disks and no hard drive.
was great!...
but when we could stop swaping floppies over and over by upgrading to an xt with a 10 megabyte hard drive; it was a no brainer.
today you can buy a whole computer for what we paid for a ''pentium 75 cpu'' to use in our first custom built gamer.
we average upgrading every few years, and sometimes several minor upgrades in between.
all of these are based on ''when we need it!
; and what is needed''.
i can guarantee you that someday we will have computers that you can ask about someone or something and get the right answer: just like on ''startrek''.
you can wait until that is available if you want to: but what will you be doing while you wait?
using a typewriter?
maybe a lot of stick-up notes?
if you want to wait i can even send you one of our old systems.
you pay the shipping.
what do you want?
a 286, 386, or maybe even an amd k6.
we probably still have that ''pentium 75 cpu'' too.
give you 90% off and throw in the rest of a computer with it.
so the bottom line is ''know what you want a computer to do and then find one that does what you want now'': or wait for it to be created.
make it a good day!
