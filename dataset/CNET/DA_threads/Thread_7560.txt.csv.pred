1.1.1	Just bought one at BestBuy the other day and the RAM makes a lot of noise , since I set it up .	St
1.1.2	The Specs in the PC are : AMD Athlon 64 Porcessor 3500plus .	St
1.1.3	512 MB with 200 GB .	St
1.1.4	It is a AMD Athlon 64 .	St
1.1.5	I asked the Best Buy staff if this is a better PC than the ones they had out .	St
1.1.6	He stated it is better , and far greater capcaity for memory .	St
1.1.7	My last PC was an Emachine with a Celeron Processor , and I do not like the Celerons .	St
1.1.8	I wanted something smoother , quicker and more effective .	St
1.1.9	Is it normal for the Tower to make so much noise being it 's a new PC ?	Ques
1.1.10	Is it normal for the pages to load much slower as well ?	Ques
1.1.11	I been told this is a HP Compaq Preserio and that there pretty good , but unusre if this is even the case .	St
1.1.12	Should I bring this PC back ?	Ques
1.1.13	Any other suggestions on what other PC to buy under $ 699 price tag ?	Ques
1.1.14	This Pc was under $ 500 .	St
1.1.15	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	... is coming from the Hard Drive , because RAM is silent .	St
1.2.2	In your case this is ominous .	St
1.2.3	Why ?	Ques
1.2.4	Computers in the last 10 years regardless of whether they have been AMD , Intel , ( or VIA / Cyrix / Winchip ) have not had any problems loading web pages quickly , because this is not a hard task they have ever struggled with .	St
1.2.5	Replacing one for another these days will have virtually no speed difference ( unless you can tell the difference between an 850th of a second , and a 1000th ?	Ques
1.2.6	) , but if you have a Hard drive problem ... .omionous .	St
1.2.7	When you access a website , your browser has to use hundres of files , that move about onto and off of the hard drive .	St
1.2.8	That 's all that noise you 're hearing .	St
1.2.9	If you see a slowdown as that occurs you have a Hard Drive problem on your hands .	St
1.2.10	The reason is that modern hard drives , are all relatively quiet , and speedy .	St
1.2.11	They access and store data quietly and quickly , but if you have a noisy slow one ... things will slow down even if the rest of the hardware in the computer is better , faster , more expensive .	St
1.2.12	Think of hard drives as books , and you 're in a library .	St
1.2.13	You go to each book , new and old , and flick through the pages of each .	St
1.2.14	They whir by at great speed even if the books are new or old , thin or fat .	St
1.2.15	Whether they are from one publisher or another makes no difference either , and they only make a little noise .	St
1.2.16	Now you find one book with pages made out of cardboard .	St
1.2.17	It still has those pesky word things in , just like the rest of the books , but the pages ca n't be thumbed through quickly now , and they also seem to make and odd thwacking noise as they have to be manually turned one by one .	St
1.2.18	It takes ages to to get through just one book .	St
1.2.19	Hard drives are like that .	St
1.2.20	They all have many pages that can whirl past in the blink of an eye , but if you have a noisy one ... .you 're on that one cardboard book !	St
1.2.21	That 's your hard drive !	St
1.2.22	It does n't matter if the rest of the PC is fast or slow , as you can only read the pages as slowly as the pages can turn .	St
1.2.23	The noise it makes is the ominous sign , because as I 've said drives are all relatively speedy and quiet these days .	St
1.2.24	It 's not impossible that a drive can be faulty or damaged in transit , or have it 's connecting ribbon come partly adrift enough to cause problems ( requiring multiple attempts to read ) , but really as this is a new PC it is up to the vendor to address , and correct .	St
1.2.25	Take it back , and get a quiet book ( in simpler words ) .	St
1.2.26	Compaq , Emachine , Celeron , or Athlon64 it makes no difference , web pages whould be just as quick on one or the other , and typically quite quiet .	St
1.2.27	Good luck , GeeBee .	Polite
1.3.1	First of all , the noise you are hearing is either the fan or the hard drive , or something vibrating inside the case .	St
1.3.2	Is it a steady , consistent noise , a vibration , or a grinding , scratchy noise ?	Ques
1.3.3	If the computer is located in a warm room or does n't have adequate ventilation , the fan will run a lot .	St
1.3.4	Giving us a better description of the noise will help is sort that one out .	St
1.3.5	Now , some questions : What will you be using the computer for ?	Ques
1.3.6	( mostly web browsing , word processing , games etc ) What model is the Presario ( the numbers ) ?	Ques
1.3.7	Pages loading slower - is it only web pages that are slower or are other programs slower too ?	Ques
1.4.1	Is it normal for the Tower to make so much noise being it 's a new PC ?	Ques
1.4.2	Is it normal for the pages to load much slower as well ?	Ques
1.4.3	I been told this is a HP Compaq Preserio and that there pretty good , but unusre if this is even the case .	St
1.4.4	Should I bring this PC back ?	Ques
1.4.5	The noise you are hearing could be the fans in the system which keep the system cool enough to run properly .	St
1.4.6	Fan noise levels run anywhere from 10 decibels ( db ) to a very noisy 75db ( think of servers in a lab environment with lots of fans running ) .	St
1.4.7	A whisper is 20db .	St
1.4.8	Most fans run in the 20-30db range and the more fans you have , the noisier it can be .	Sug
1.4.9	It 's possible that one or more of the fans in the system could have failing bearings and need to be replaced .	St
1.4.10	If this is the case , you can take the system back to be repaired , usually at no cost within the first 60-90 days .	St
1.4.11	If it 's the hard drive making the noise , as one of the other posters indicated , then definitely take it back and get it repaired .	St
1.4.12	If the fans are simply too noisy and there does n't seem to be anything wrong with them , then you can buy quieter ones for about $ 10- $ 20 a piece .	St
1.4.13	The quietest fans I 've found are the Papst 8412NG series , but they do n't have a high airflow ( measured in cubic feet per minute - CFM ) .	St
1.4.14	A typical fan noise and airflow should be about 20-30db and 25-45 CFM , respectively .	St
1.4.15	Do check these things and I hope this helps .	St
1.4.16	Timothy	St
