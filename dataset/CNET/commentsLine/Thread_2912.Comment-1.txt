re:  hey old buddy, new 450 watt ps ws delivered today.
installed same, and my old odd noise is gone.
of course this supply has 2 fans, so now listening to a bit more &quot;whoosh&quot; noise.
but this is totally acceptable, compared to what i had been hearing, so ps did fix my problem.
just wanted to let you know.
