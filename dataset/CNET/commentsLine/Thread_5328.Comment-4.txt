there should be no different drivers needed just because of a firmware update.
------------- perhaps that's true for a dvd??
what i've seen with other hardware is the firmware update seems to change the device type/id.
when windows goes looking for a driver to match the type/id there is no match.
now it's back to the maker's site to find a driver that supports the new firmware.
