my 1st brought computer was a pcjr.
(don't laugh).
at least i was able to transfer alot of pgms.
and data later to a pc clone.
i did play with atari and appleii for awhile but felt s/w was limited as in my budget at the time.
however, i do remember playing with a pet(comadore?)
in hs.
i thought this was only a toy at the time, but it got me out of another boring class.
i did work on burroughs(1st computer job, late 70's) systems for awhile, but only in sections of it and really it was shared system for the repair depot/center at the time.
it's been so long, i don't rememebr the model#'s any more, i think 90 or 900. many of these were used banks & govt.
sites, so fixing them was serious business.
pcs didn't show up until much later in any common use.
but, repairs for tandy one(you know the 1st useful system)systems were done and users really put them to tasks outside of what thier mainframe or mini-system couldn't and for some dept.. that's my story.
