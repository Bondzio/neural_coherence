1.1.19	Links to things would be appreciated .	St
1.1.20	Thanks in Advance !	St
1.1.21	!	St
1.2.1	Viewsonic or Samsung , both make good monitors and both offer models with built in speakers , if that is what you are looking for .	St
1.3.1	... you should be able to support bigger monitors at least in terms of pixels .	St
1.3.2	I would suggest you double-check , but 22 & quot ; level resolutions of 1680 x 1050 - ish should not be a problem .	St
1.3.3	Not sure how the bigger picture will look or how it will perform though .	St
1.3.4	( BTW your HP link is dead ) At $ 200 , you 're in 22 & quot ; territory .	St
1.3.5	Samsung make some decent budget 22-inchers - shop around on Newegg , etc .	St
1.3.6	I 'm not an enormous fan of large cheap monitors ( since they tend to be based around TN panels , which results in noticeable colour changes at the edges of a & gt ; 20 & quot ; monitor when sitting in front of it ) , but a 22 & quot ; is bearable for me for the most part and I 'm sure for most , the colour shift would n't even register most of the time .	St
1.3.7	I 've used the '08 predecessor of this monitor in quad-monitor configurations and I felt it was as good as any 22 & quot ; monitor I 've tried .	St
1.4.1	http : //h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp ? lang=en & cc=us & objectID=c00572527 this is my pc i will post again in a little bit with more info .	St
1.5.1	thanks for the answers thusfar .	Polite
1.5.2	Basically , What I would like to have is a little bit bigger screen , but it doesnt necessarly have to be a 22 & quot ; screen , a 19 & quot ; wide screen could be just fine .	St
1.5.3	So far , I have been looking at Dell , Samsung , and HP Monitors .	St
1.5.4	I know there is a blue billion generic brand monitors , and while I have nothing against them , I question their reliability as well as quality .	St
1.5.5	I wont be doing anything but surfing the net , watching DVD 's ( Not worried about High Definition for the most part ) and running Online Poker Programs such as PokerStars ( www.pokerstars.com ) as well as the various other Online Poker Sites .	St
1.5.6	I would either like built in speakers or some USB on the monitor itself , it does not have to have both .	St
1.5.7	( If it did that would be great , just not required . )	St
1.5.8	If I need to sacrafice a little smaller screen to have a better picture ( resolution etc ) then so be it .	St
1.5.9	I really do n't want a monitor that makes it hard to read text .	St
1.5.10	( yes , I use Clear Type ) The NEC Multisync 1700M+ that I 've had for about 8 years has been outstandingly reliable , but was made in 2001 , and im sure there are some new monitors out there that would just blow my mind when comparing this NEC to whatever is so many years newer .	St
1.5.11	I have looked at Ebay , at pacificgeek , Ecost , and a few other sites and have been trying to look at the innumerous lcd monitor reviews , and keeping them all straight has become quite a challenge .	St
1.5.12	I have hoped to come across a review site that had a dropdown of features so I could compare easier , but I have yet to find such a site .	St
1.5.13	again , thank you for any input you may have , I am not as technologically ( is that a word ?	Ques
1.5.14	heh ) smart as many are .	St
1.5.15	Thanks again .	St
1.5.16	All Links to monitors that might fit what I am asking for would be GREATLY Appreciated .	St
1.6.1	I really am not to concerned with a swivel , but I am in a tilt feature .	St
1.7.1	Am sticking to my guns , still say Samsung or Viewsonic , either one both would meet your requirements at a reasonable cost .	St
1.8.1	A number of monitors .	St
1.8.2	Viewsonic and Samsung are in those makes that I 've owned and own today .	St
1.8.3	Good call .	St
1.8.4	Bob	St
