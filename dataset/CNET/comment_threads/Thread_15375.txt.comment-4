- http://www.dell.com/home/laptops calls it's 10&quot; machine a netbook, everything bigger (up from 11.6&quot;) a laptop.
- Lenovo calls it's 12.1&quot; machine still a netbook.
- Wikipedia says: By mid 2009, CNET noted &quot;the specs are so similar that the average shopper would likely be confused as to why one is better than the other,&quot;[1] noting &quot;the only conclusion is that there really is no distinction between the devices.&quot; So what's in a name?
Don't shop for a certain class of devices, shop for what you need.
Luckily, I see you found one you like.
Nothing wrong with Lenovo, of course.
Did you see and touch it already in a shop?
