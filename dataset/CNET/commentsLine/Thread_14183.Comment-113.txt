around 1982-83 i was a computer repair technician for ti.
the ti99/4a was indeed a 16k computer, 32k with the memory expansion added.
when the home computer division folded, i was privy to use the ti pro (8088 based 286-like clone).
i built my first 286 clone, then moved to 386 and then 486. then i took a giant leap and went to an amd based 586 then athlon and athlon 64. during my foray into the ti pro i saw $500 non-smart modems, $600 5meg harddrives and the first internet tools(besides unix) written for os/2 and, lotus 123 that came on 4-5 5-1/4&quot; floppies due to it being written in assembly language.
things have really taken off since then.
i'm really glad to have seen the industry in it's infancy.
