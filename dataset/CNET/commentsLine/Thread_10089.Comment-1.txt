by sugarbear246 - 8/25/10 10:51 pm i have a pioneer dvd-rw dvr-107d--(dvd/cd rom drive) (burner).
i am trying to update the (firmware to the latest version v1.22) i successfully downloaded the (firmware) and know the command to run at the:&quot;command prompt&quot;, and i have the firmware downloaded and installed in the (proper directory to receive my command)!
got one problem though, the command prompt tell me (i need the &quot;kernel&quot; that goes along with the firmware update, but i'll be darned if i can find (&quot;where to download (dvr-107d v.122 &quot;kernel&quot;?
anybody out there got any ideas?
