1.1.1	I was brought a computer , that did n't want to start ( it turned out to be too much dust on the VGA card and it was n't working .	St
1.1.2	After I run the PC there came up a problem with the HDD & quot ; replace the damaged hard drive & quot ; etc .	St
1.1.3	After I replaced it , cleaned the whole pc ( it 's some old P3 ) and ran it there was a & quot ; hardware error , enter power setup menu for details & quot ; .	St
1.1.4	Here 's what I find in the power setup menu : VCORE Voltage 1.72V +3.3V Voltage 3.72V ( it is in red ) +5V Voltage 4.99V +12V Voltage 12.28V -12V Voltage -11.50V -5V Voltage [ Ignore ] So I guess that the problem is the one , colored in red .	St
1.1.5	I do n't understand much , but I think the one in the left is what it should be , and the one in the right is what it is ATM .	St
1.1.6	Can this damage something , or it is too little to worry ?	Ques
1.2.1	That 's the voltage for main memory , so you can see the results once the system gets used .	St
1.2.2	Voltages vary by at least +/- 10 % are n't that much but it should n't be constantly at those levels , if so then replace with new power supply .	St
1.2.3	Being an older system system , the psu probably saw better days , but the expense of new psu and other repairs suggest to start looking for a newer system when funds are available as problems may crop-up sooner than later .	St
1.2.4	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.3.1	Well , meanwhile came clear , that a new PC will be bought in the next 2 months , so I guess it 's not THAT much of a problem .	St
1.3.2	In the worst case scenario - the new PC will be bought sooner , than later	St
1.4.1	go into the bios and reset it to defaults .	St
1.4.2	increasing memory voltage is a common technique to overclock ram to higher levels .	St
