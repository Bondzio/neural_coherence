The box says &quot;For Best Ports Connection&quot; and it uses an ALi chipset, 4 USB's plus firewire. The drivers never seem to install right, I also tried one from another site. Now the hardware wizard comes up everytime I boot. ANyone have luck with this card? I got this off eBay for a bargain, but that seems not to be now. It appeared to work for a bit, but not all devices initially, now it seems useless. any help? -thanks, Russ

I'm finding it works fine with camcorders, but reports of dataloss on Windows with firewire drives just continue. I know of no fix other than to move the drive to USB. In closing, I install no drivers for such cards with XP SP2. bob

My problem is with a PCI card that is supposed to give me USB 2.0 & firewire ports. The card seems to have major driver issues with WIN XP and I do have SP2 loaded. The people who sell this card seem to play dumb. Just looking to see if this is a lousy generic card and that there are in fact no legit drivers out there for this. I can't seem to find a legit tech support site for this as well. Maybe someone can even recommend a bargain USB 2.0 card out there. -thanks, Russ

I can not get this card to work. The card manufacturer is not labled but packaging refers to &quot;Best Ports Connection&quot;. My BIOS acknowledges the card but the the BIOS and driver monitor tells me that the COM ports need to be reconfigured. MosChip.com has driver information and documentation but not enough for me to configure the COM ports for my application. Anyone have information on this card or how to configure the COM port parameters?

On your new post supply: a. A link to the product. I will not hunt it down. b. The OS in question. c. Machine details. Best of luck, Bob

It has the 5 USB port connections (1 internal, 4 external). I have installed it in the top PCI slot of my motherboard and I let Windows XP SP2 find the driver(s), which it did with no problems. In &quot;device manager&quot;, the new card shows up and shows to be working properly with no conflicts. Now the problem.......No matter what I plug into the new usb card, it doesnt recognize any of them (mouse, digital camera, printer, etc.) I get a small balloon at the bottom right corner that says &quot;unknown device&quot;. If I plug any of these items back into my motherboard usb slots, it finds them correctly with no issues....but my motherboard usb slots are 1.1 which is why I bought this new card. Any fixes or tech support for this problem?

I built my own pc.....Motherboard &quot;ECS Elite Group&quot;, &quot;K7VTA3 V.8&quot; Everything on my pc works fine, it's just the new card that doesnt. My motherboard AND windows see the card and acknowledge it, but the card itself doesnt recognize anything I plug into it.
