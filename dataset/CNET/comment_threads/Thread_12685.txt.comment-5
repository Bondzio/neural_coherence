Well Bob thanks for your help but I've found a work around on this one.
Since I'm not a gamer and don't need all of that fancy stuff I decided to go this route.
I totally uninstalled the drivers and supporting software and did a Driver Cleaner Pro run (you can get this at www.majorgeeks.com) - and downloaded the older Catalyst 5.11 drivers with the classic control panel.
So far running well.
