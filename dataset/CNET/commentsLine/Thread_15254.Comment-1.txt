i'm attempting to set up an hp2420 32 bit printer on my network with a cat5e cable.
i have all winxp pro pcs.
i previously always attached this printer to a pc but i want this one on the lan now.
i googled the steps but still can't see the printer.
here's what i did... --print an hp2420 configuration page with jet direct page ip address 10.34.204.4 --add printer wizard --choose &quot;local install&quot; option and create a port.
--use the dropdown list for a tcp/ip port , --then use that ip address 10.34.204.4 --got to the manufacturer's list page choose &quot;have disk&quot; and browse to my driver.
--highlight one of the files there and click ok and follow through with the rest of the steps that ip address doesn't look like my normal ips.
i had planned to use 192.168.2.113 before i read the google blog, but using 192.168.2.113 fails also.
and as always someone wants to use it yesterday.
i'm self taught on systems since this is only part of my job, but i'm a good monkey if it's explained.
thanks for any help
