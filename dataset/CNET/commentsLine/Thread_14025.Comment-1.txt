when i turned on my system yesterday morning, the fans ran for a time, then completely quit.
nothing.
i guessed that the power supply was at fault, so i replaced the power supply with one from another computer.
now, when i flip the switch on the powersupply, the fan in the ps and the fans on the mb run and an indicator light is lit on the motherboard, but nothing else works.
the moniter does not show any signal at all.
i cannot shut the system off from the front panel on/off switch.
to turn it off i have to flip the power supply switch.
i think the power supply failure took out the motherboard.
could this be what happened and what are the chances it took any boards (sound, video, etc) with it?
