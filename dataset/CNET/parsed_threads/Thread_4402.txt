<s> I bought a Buffalo hds-ph320u2-us external hard drive that requires a password to mount, but this hard drive does not support Mac OS X 10.6 and later. </s>
<s> It works on my Windows 7 pc and i know that I can access it through VMWare or BootCamp, but I want a way to access it without any of those. </s>
<s> Is it possible to bypass or format the external hard drive so I don't need to enter a password in order to mount it on my Mac? </s>

<s> Try this on the Buffalo tech forum. </s>
<s> yea, i asked that on yahoo answers the link you showed me did not help b/c i want this to work on MAC and want to get rid of the password </s>
<s> I thought you should have asked this on the Buffalo forum. </s>
<s> I don't have this drive to try the usual tools. </s>
