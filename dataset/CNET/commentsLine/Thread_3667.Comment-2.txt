if it's a diskette or cd or dvd or usb-stick or memory card: throw away without trying anything.
if it's a hard disk: format.
if that results in more than 0 errors or bad sectors or such, throw away also.
that's the most likely outcome.
if no errors left, distrust the hard disk in the future and be very careful to have excellent backup of what it contains.
throwing away includes physical destruction if the medium contains private information.
