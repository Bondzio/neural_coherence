I accessed the information on this website, which instructed me to download/run a program called ARO 2012. After running this program, I was confronted with instructions to buy this software; I declined. There were no further instructions as to installation of the requested drivers. Was this another Internet scam?? I only wish to reinstall the drivers foe my admittedly old component. Perhaps my attempts are futile. There are several websites claiming to offer these drivers. Can I find a place to simply download these drivers which I purchased previously with this device? Any input would be appreciated. I have looked in many websites.

I can't search for you because the details are missing such as which OS, what PC, etc. HOWEVER I have used a LiveCD call UBUNTU to get the data off the Zip drive media without too much pain. I use that method since we usually only need to get the files out then with that out of the way we can put it back in storage, sell it or give the old thing away. Bob

I am attempting to reuse this drive, not simply transcribe infirmation. There are many websites claiming to have the required drivers for this device. They state that it will work with Windows XP, which I am using. I have used this USB 2.0 Zip100 drive in the past with this computer. I see no reason why it should not function now, except for the &quot;planned obsolence&quot; I have read about regarding the home computer business. I should not be required to junk my older peripherals if this is indeed the case. I am now living on retirement income and cannot afford to keep up with the new products. I don't want to sound sarcastic, but as I try to rejuvenate my older hardware, I am encountering a dearth of infomation. As an aside, after downloading/running &quot;ARO 2012&quot; from this website, my Dell Dmension 5150 computer is dead; it will not boot to Windows XP: the floppy disk drive light remains lit, as though it is attempting to boot from this drive. The usual F keys on power on have no effect. This software screwed with my registry. I have read elsewhere that should to be avoided. I guess I may be too late, unless i can find some WnXP boot disks or resort to &quot;dban&quot; reformatting, which I was hoping to avoid. I would appreciate any positive input regarding my situation. Must I write of this computer? It was functional before I began searching for Iomega Zip100 drivers.

There are advertisements galore and if you click on some advertisement and proceed to wipe out a PC with some registry cleaner then what is to be said? Frankly I don't equate an advertisement with a scam. Some will! Back to your issues. Since you have not updated your post to note if XP was updated if I were to do this I'd update my XP first, head to Dell and put in my service tag to see if I have their latest BIOS, Drivers and Apps then I'd take a look in the device manager after I booted to SAFE MODE to see if any unknown USB things are there. I delete those and reboot. At this point I have a choice. My choice would be to plug in the USB Zip and see if Microsoft will get the driver for me. I did this about 6 months ago and without any drama, XP SP3 fetched a driver for me and the Zip drive worked. HOWEVER if someone ran a registry blaster or optimizer they may be very upset over reloading the OS and engaging in driver hunts. Iomega.com still has the drivers. Can you answer why you would go anywhere else? https://iomega-na-en.custhelp.com/app/subproduct/p/1 Bob

My favorite is called &quot;XP Repair Install.&quot; Here's a duckduckgo for that. http://duckduckgo.com/?q=XP+Repair+Install It's an old, well worn procedure and may avoid a full re-install. Bob

Most solutions seem to require a functioning cd drive. Fortunately, this is a refurbished unit for &quot;learning&quot; purposes and has nothing to lose, although I did make a data backup for some reason. I have an MS DOS boot disk, and the 6 floppiy Win XP Setup disks, if required. Most of the Repair Software seems to require a functioning cd drive, which I have not. Due to my blunder, I am past that stage.I will never again run any program that touches my registry, although &quot;CC Cleaner&quot; was reviewed by CNET. As it is past midnight here, I will start tomorrow, after checking back at this website for further advice. Grats!.

I must download a program which I can use on my currently &quot;crashed&quot; computer. I must be able to boot from my floppy drive. I have an external floppy drive. I doubt if I can use this. Internal floppy drives (refurbished) are cheap and easy to install, but will require a trip to a computer shop which sells one. In addition, I have found they are not generic. I am using an internal floppy purchased from Dell because the &quot;generic&quot; drive I purchased locally does not have the data/power cable configuration which fits my computer. I would not mind the $20 expense, but cost of excursion must be considered. Perhaps I can download the required software program and send it as an email attachment to the &quot;learning&quot; unit. I would still be able to boot the computer somehow, presumably from the A drive. I have &quot;setup&quot; diskettes (6). That is my next step. I have previously backed up the data from this computer, none of which is crucial, knowing I was just &quot;learning&quot;. Thus I have nothing to lose here. I will await any further suggestions.

This only fails if there's a hardware issue with the drive or the motherboard, because it's totally independent of the current installation of Windows. And we mean this repair install: http://michaelstevenstech.com/XPrepairinstall.htm http://pcsupport.about.com/od/operatingsystems/ss/instxprepair1.htm Kees

It appears that you want exact steps for your hardware. I don't see you supplying a link to your Dell or such machine so we'll have to defer to two links which I've used to help folk as a guide. http://www.blackviper.com/os-install-guides/windows-xp-home-install-guide/ http://www.theeldergeek.com/xp_home_install_-_graphic.htm Good luck!
