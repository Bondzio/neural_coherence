The 5010 (without the &quot;i&quot;) doesn't work right. I'm running latest XP Home, 512DDR, 40 gig HD. Don't want to buy anything. Thanks, Tom

Went to Compaq, routed to HP, plugged 5010i, got a page that said this: Downloads for this product are not available through this website. Please contact your local HP representative for information on the specific update methods available for this product.

HP apparently doesn't support this product any longer. By the way, the reason I need the driver is because the monitor buttons have lost functionality. I cannot make any adjustments to the display, including the power button. Thanks for the effort.
