1.1.1	4x512MB or 2x1GB (all are PC2-5300, same latencies etc)?	St
1.1.2	I don't intend to add more memory, ever, so I'm just wondering on the off-chance that the performance may differ.	St
1.1.3	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	Gives us a chance for more later.	St
1.2.2	Less load on the bus.	St
1.2.3	Less parts is more reliable (almost everything!)	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
