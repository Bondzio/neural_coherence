&quot;If I connect a switched hub to my BEFSR41 wired router, why will the PC to PC traffic move faster?&quot; Because the switched hub in the BEFSR41 doesn't keep up with 100Mb transfers.
Even the cheapest switches hubs helped curb the time when I copy a file between machines.
Since routers were pricey back then I would connect up the modem -&gt; router -&gt; switched hub -&gt; PCs to get the best overall network speed.
