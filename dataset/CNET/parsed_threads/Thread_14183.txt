<s> 1990s (What computer was it?) </s>
<s> 2000s (What computer was it?) </s>
<s> Just starting now (So what do you think of it?) </s>
<s> If you have a story behind your first personal computer use, get nostalgic and tell us all about it! </s>
<s> We'd love to hear about it. </s>
<s> My 1st brought computer was a PCjr. </s>
<s> (don't laugh). </s>
<s> At least I was able to transfer alot of pgms. </s>
<s> and data later to a PC clone. </s>
<s> I did play with Atari and AppleII for awhile but felt s/w was limited as in my budget at the time. </s>
<s> However, I do remember playing with a PET(Comadore?) </s>
<s> in HS. </s>
<s> I thought this was only a toy at the time, but it got me out of another boring class. </s>
<s> I did work on Burroughs(1st computer job, late 70's) systems for awhile, but only in sections of it and really it was shared system for the repair depot/center at the time. </s>
<s> It's been so long, I don't rememebr the model#'s any more, I think 90 or 900. </s>
<s> Many of these were used banks & govt. </s>
<s> sites, so fixing them was serious business. </s>
<s> PCs didn't show up until much later in any common use. </s>
<s> But, repairs for Tandy one(you know the 1st useful system)systems were done and users really put them to tasks outside of what thier mainframe or mini-system couldn't and for some dept.. That's my story. </s>
<s> -----Willy </s>
<s> did work on Burroughs machines but started in 1969. </s>
<s> First PC was an IBM &quot;Classic&quot; upgraded to 256mb of memory and 2 single-sided, single-density 5.25&quot; floppy drives. </s>
<s> Epson 80 character dot-matrix printer. </s>
<s> I later upgraded to a 5mb hard drive. </s>
<s> Cost me over $600! </s>
<s> Talk about feeling old!! </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack p.s. </s>
<s> Hey Willy, wanna reminisce? </s>
<s> I think this was the model of my first computer, A TI-99 4A. </s>
<s> They sold them cheap about 1980. </s>
<s> The only storage system was a tape recorder with a counter so you could retreive your program. </s>
<s> The computer sounded like a modem when it stored the programs. </s>
<s> We used an old TV for a monitor. </s>
<s> I remember it a programming similiar to Apple-soft. </s>
<s> It came with a program to make a man on a screen. </s>
<s> I modified the program so he would move. </s>
<s> It would be 4 years later when I used Apple 11e that I learned how to use a disk drive. </s>
<s> I programmed my own word processor in Applesoft Basic. </s>
<s> The next year I had a friend who bought an IBM 286. </s>
<s> It had a 20mb hard drive. </s>
<s> At the time, people thought no one would need a bigger hard drive. </s>
<s> Bill </s>
<s> I bought my TI99-4A in 1983. </s>
<s> It was SO cool! </s>
<s> 32K (yes K) of RAM, built in OS and Basic plus a color display. </s>
<s> (Well it was color if you hooked it up to a color television) In all honesty, it was pretty darn cool for 1983. </s>
<s> At first I only had cassette tape for storage. </s>
<s> But soon I got a single sided single density 5.25 in floppy drive. </s>
<s> I had a Multiplan spreadsheet cartridge and actually tracked financial information with it. </s>
<s> I used the TI99-4A for several years for entertainment and real work. </s>
<s> I finally replaced it with a 286 that ran DOS in 1988. </s>
<s> In 1984 I was working in a structural engineer's office, and they had me use an IBM for typing client documents. </s>
<s> The screen looked like DOS (no gui) and had a: and b: drives. </s>
<s> I had to code in text attributes the same way we do in html today (&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, etc.). </s>
<s> One day the boss brought in a brand new Apple computer with the funny model name of Macintosh, and he let me play around on it. </s>
<s> That's when the computer bug bit me, and I've been happily PCing ever since in both Windows and Mac OSes! </s>
<s> :o) </s>
<s> My first was a Tandy, TRS-80 Model 1. </s>
<s> 16Kb ram, a cassete tape drive adn very few apps. </s>
<s> It forced me to learn BASIC programming in order to make real use of the system. </s>
<s> It was God awful slow and dummer than dirt compared with the cheapest cell phone today. </s>
<s> My first 12/1969 Commador VIC 20, 2nd 03/1980 C-64. </s>
<s> I miss my C-64, that was a great little machine. </s>
<s> Ran all the Atari games and accepted the Atari Joy Stick. </s>
<s> The color was great. </s>
<s> My favorite games were ChopLifter,Zaxxon, and Zaxxon 3D. </s>
<s> Anyone know if either of those games were ever made for the PC? </s>
<s> I may just have to by another C-64. </s>
<s> I looked at all the Retro's but no one has produced those 2 games. </s>
<s> Message was edited by: admin to remove email address to prevent spam bots from picking it up </s>
<s> Does the name, Wang, ring bell for anyone?? </s>
<s> LOL!! </s>
<s> My undergrad Alma Mater had a Wang in the Natural Sciences building. </s>
<s> What a monster that thing was! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> sorry... that wasn't a PC was it? </s>
<s> Never mind. </s>
<s> My first was the 128K Macintosh released in 1984. </s>
<s> Yes, the First Mac, one of the more reliable computers I have used. </s>
<s> I still have it and will turn it on just to turn it on and see how much has changed from the 1st mac to the iMac and OSX. </s>
<s> Apple IIc about 1984. </s>
<s> No HD, built in green monitor. </s>
<s> Appleworks program provided first experience with wordprocessors and spreadsheets. </s>
<s> Most of that has not fundamentally changed. </s>
<s> Example: Control-C for COPY and Control-V for PASTE or INSERT were Apple-C and Apple-V respectively. </s>
<s> (Apple was a key on the IIc.) </s>
<s> The closest thing to the internet was a subscription to Compuserve where you used cryptic commands and waited a reply. </s>
<s> Like &quot;Go WEA LAX&quot; I think to get the weather in LA. </s>
<s> The &quot;fast&quot; response would come trickling across the monitor in simple text that could be seen moving from left to right. </s>
<s> A paragraph could take several seconds. </s>
<s> WOW! </s>
<s> Printing was on dot-matrix printers. </s>
<s> Media for programs and data was with 5.25&quot; floppys that had to be shifted in and out. </s>
<s> I had an external floppy drive in addition to the built in drive which saved a few steps. </s>
<s> (All programs were on floppies because there was no HD.) </s>
<s> Surprise- It never crashed, ever. </s>
<s> That came later with MS-DOS pcs. </s>
<s> Though I have used Windows exclusively since because of compatibility with workplace programs, I've always had a 'soft' spot for Apple computers - and may again go back. </s>
<s> Technically the first computer I remember using was the Apple 2 in elementary school in the early 1990's. </s>
<s> In 94 my uncle gave my family his commodore 64 setup with everything he had. </s>
<s> Then in 1999 I got my first internet PC. </s>
<s> I believe it was a cyrix 2 366mhz eMachines. </s>
<s> I learned some light coding, which is a bit surprising even to me because I was born in 83. </s>
<s> It wasn't anything impressive, just having my name flash on the screen and some simple math problems. </s>
<s> It also forced me to spell &quot;CATALOG&quot; because in order to play most games I had to type that. </s>
<s> It would have also helped if the machine didn't have a QWERTY keyboard; I definitely did not understand why they put the letter in &quot;random&quot; order. </s>
<s> The Talking Whiz Kid had a much easier keyboard to find the letters. </s>
<s> Oh yeah we also had a Talking Whiz Kid which we got about the same time as the Apple IIe, but it did not have nearly as many fun games as the Apple. </s>
<s> The best game was Mario Bros. </s>
<s> I played that all the time with my sister, and apparently it was a bootleg game because it was never actually released for the Apple IIe. </s>
<s> The year is 1986 my first computer mmm forgot its name... something z80 then to the comodore8 or was it 16 nightmare stuff, then the amiga 500 and finally the xt with a 10mb hard disk. </s>
<s> Computers have come a long way, so have I, at the age of mid thirties, I cried when I first had to use an windows environment to type a letter... think I knew something... of the trials and tribulations of windows... save us from bad microsoft programming. </s>
<s> I had left the country town of Griffith to the big city of Sydney to learn about computers I could see they were the future way... </s>
<s> I wanted to become a programmer, but soon learned my maths was sorely learned and a major handicap to becoming a good programmer so decided to paint instead, and set up an online gallery at www.ArtisticAussieArtists.com.au. </s>
<s> have fun Jenny </s>
<s> I recall paying $4200 Canadian for it including free delivery and setup in December 1983. </s>
<s> Plus another grand for a dot matrix printer that never worked. </s>
<s> But that computer was built like a tank and WordPerfect 3.0 worked just fine on that green monochrome monitor. </s>
<s> AND it never broke! </s>
<s> If only I'd waited a month I would have been first in line for the first Mac. </s>
<s> I suffered through several Windows incarnations on a perpetually upgraded Pentium PC until dumping everything for Mac's in 2002 and I feel I've gotten my original non-breaking PC productivity back. </s>
<s> My first computer I built was the cosmac elf, now that is old. </s>
<s> The Zenith 248. </s>
<s> No training in how to use it, just some manuals and disks. </s>
<s> I learned how to turn it on only to be greeted by a blinking cursor following the C:&gt; prompt. </s>
<s> I had just learned how to use the Xerox 860 Word Processor then to have this dumped on my desk. </s>
<s> Oh, I was in the U.S. Navy and was soon to deploy aboard the USS Nimitz in 1985. </s>
<s> Such was my introduction to MS-DOS and the personal computer. </s>
<s> It was a HP Pavilian.. umm.. 7000 or something. </s>
<s> and it was only for items i was picking-up for our branch, so very little per time spent overall...(unless you can count hands of solitare). </s>
<s> but i got my 1 st home pc end 2001. bought it used & it was a compaq w/ 8gb hd, and 64k memory..it had win98, and i upgraded to 98se,but i learned alot from trial and mostly error. </s>
<s> and when i got my new hp in 2003 i turned around and sold it to someone who was also was their 1st home pc. </s>
<s> I remember it well. </s>
<s> It's stinn going. </s>
<s> Windows ME. </s>
<s> Sold to a friend. </s>
<s> Rick </s>
<s> My wife's brokered generic 486 with Windows 3.1, 360 MB HDD which the broker set up as compressed. </s>
<s> Do you know how long it takes to defrag a compressed C: drive? </s>
<s> I wasted lots of Saturday mornings in the basement doing just that. </s>
<s> And I was backing up My Documents on 3.5 inch floppies. </s>
<s> Including AOL's download folders which included FOUR copies of PowerTools! </s>
<s> When I had to install a replacement FDD three years later, I bought a Dummies book to get through it. </s>
<s> And then had to install a modem card and that was an adventure. </s>
<s> Now I am retired and doing pro bono computer repair for elderly (older than me!!) </s>
<s> folks!! </s>
<s> Desktop? </s>
<s> Wasn't any such animal then! </s>
<s> Although not a &quot;personal&quot; computer, the IBM MagTape word processor we used at work was a far cry from the normal IBM Selectrics of that day. </s>
<s> This monster whirred, snorted, ground gears, and maybe tooted as it wrote typed words onto reels of tape. </s>
<s> It was great as long as nothing had to be edited. </s>
<s> If so, one broke sweat trying to find the beginning frame of the document, then the beginning of the part that had to be edited, ad infinitum. </s>
<s> We hired one person to work the thing, and 6 months later she began to get proficient. </s>
<s> My first strictly personal machine was a TI 99/4A bought in I think 1982. </s>
<s> It was an Apple IIe in an elementary school computer lab in 1991- I primarily used Print Shop on it to make cards and drawings. </s>
<s> It had 2 floppy drives, a few kb of RAM and that was about it. </s>
<s> The first computers I owned were a 1996 Panasonic ToughBook CF-25 and a 1992 Tandy 2500SX/20, which were decent machines for their respective time periods. </s>
<s> The Tandy was obtained in 1999, the ToughBook was obtained in 2001, as my first desktop and notebook, respectively. </s>
<s> As I posted later in the forum, my first three computers were an Apple IIe, a DOS-based Tandy 2500SX/20 built in 1992 and a 1996 Panasonic ToughBook CF-25. </s>
<s> The cheapest cell phone available today has more available brainpower than all three computers combined!!! </s>
<s> Also, I played around with BASIC for some things, but have never really needed it since my first experience with Windows 9x/Me (which was in High School, in 1999, a full four years after Windows 95 launched). </s>
<s> Hi ya...My first computer was a C-64. </s>
<s> Then went on to a 286, 486...etc. </s>
<s> You can download Dosbox and use it to play lots of those old games. </s>
<s> Ultimate Wizard was my favorite C-64 game. </s>
<s> Check out http://www.lemon64.com/links/index.php?genre=3 for lots of links. </s>
<s> Have fun! </s>
<s> I was a Special Education teacher and we used Apple's at work starting in the early 1980s. </s>
<s> They had one floppy drive, no hard drive, green monatone screens. </s>
<s> I bought an Apple IIc for myself in 1986 and took a class in Basic and tried to convert it to Apple basic for myself. </s>
<s> Thanks for asking the question. </s>
<s> It is fun to surf down memory lane. </s>
<s> Margie, a first time poster. </s>
<s> My first computer was an XT model, with a harris 8086 processor. </s>
<s> I didnot have a choice in getting one as I desperately needed it for uni. </s>
<s> I paid over 1000 for it in south africa, it was the dogs proverbial at the time, within 6 months the AT 80286 was on the market, from there the cpu chip rapidly changed in capabilities and price. </s>
<s> I kept the XT 8086 until 1993 when I left to come home, it was still working as well as the day I bought it. </s>
<s> The hard drive was a conner 40Mb, all the ram was plugged as chips straight into the motherboard. </s>
<s> According to my inlaws it is still going well. </s>
<s> and I bought a Tandy that actually had a hard drive, which I guess not every computer had in those days! </s>
<s> I really loved the Deskmate software. </s>
<s> It was easier to use than Dos and the early version od Windows; however, they had knowledge that Windows was on it's way - when I inset\rted a disk with a Microsoft program, I got a message saying something like: this product is not equipped for Windows. </s>
<s> Basic was great fun! </s>
<s> pmsl </s>
<s> It was 1980 or 81 and I forked over $999 for an all-in-one keyboard/cpu/monitor with no storage except a cassette tape recorder (sold separately). </s>
<s> It came with a whole 16K (not Meg) of memory and a black and white TV tube for the monitor. </s>
<s> I maxed it out with 48K of RAM, added two 180K single-side 5 1/4&quot; floppies, a serial port and &quot;Level 2 Basic&quot; (wow, level 2 no less) for an added cost of about $1200. </s>
<s> That doesn't count the $850 dot matrix printer just in case I wanted to print something from a word processor (oops, I didn't have one of those). </s>
<s> I bought mine while I was in the Navy living on the ship. </s>
<s> I rented a motel room for the weekend and started learning BASIC. </s>
<s> Luckily I had somewhere to store it onboard. </s>
<s> The most use I got from it was learning to program and cruising the &quot;bulletin boards&quot; with my super fast Hayes Smartmodem 300 (thats 300 baud). </s>
<s> Those were the days when nothing was compatible with anything else. </s>
<s> The good thing about that is there weren't any viruses either. </s>
<s> the Spectrum Zx81 ! </s>
<s> wow what a power house . </s>
<s> then the commodor 64 followed by the amiga 500 (i think) bbc miro , atari 520 / 1040 st the atari`s i used for music with cubase the only one i attempted to program (in basic ) was the bbc micro , wow great times typing programs on store demo machines in c1981 then watching with great pleasure as the sales staff scratched there heads as how to remove my name (or whatever , ahem cough cough) i had flashing all over the screen , like I said great times! </s>
<s> ps never had an apricot though, anyone remember those, what happend to them ? </s>
<s> My first PC was an Amstrad computer. </s>
<s> It had a 4 digit processor number (8086 or 8088, I forget which) and had two 5-1/4 floppy drives and no hard drive at all. </s>
<s> You had the Operating System (DOS 3, I believe) on one floppy and your application on another. </s>
<s> My next one was a screamer: 80486 running at 66 Mhz with a 540Mb hard drive and a 3.5 floppy drive and CD ROM drive. </s>
<s> I worked at the depot here in Ohio. </s>
<s> Many a componet or device was sent back for repairs/rebuild. </s>
<s> The logic modules on devices were before ICs became common, descrete componets and I replaced many a &quot;top hat&quot; xsister. </s>
<s> Fixed many a &quot;decoder&quot; for the teller machine for banks. </s>
<s> Did you use any &quot;Marvel Mystery oil&quot; as some techs did to help keep the solenoids from freezing and thus not change a decoder. </s>
<s> I cut my fingers on those dang steel bands!!! </s>
<s> An old bench tech taught me the quick and easy way to replace and bother it made a difference. </s>
<s> Saw the 1st tape cart drives, Plessley drives, cermanic drives, huge printers, huge HDs, heck the compressor alone was good for home projects. </s>
<s> Thanks for the trip back... -----Willy </s>
<s> Hey my first computer was a VIC20 I bought at a Montgomery Wards store. </s>
<s> I had a cassette player I hooked up to it and loaded software from cassettes. </s>
<s> I had a 13 Inch Black and White TV I connected to it for the monitor. </s>
<s> I remembered ordering software collections on cassettes from ads that were in some of the early magazines. </s>
<s> One of the most frustrating things I remember was trying to figure out where a program would start on the cassettes. </s>
<s> You would fast forward or rewind to get close and then you had to hit play and it would load when it found it. </s>
<s> Kept that computer for a while and then got a CompuAdd 4.77 Mhz PC-XT Clone with a 20MB Hard Drive. </s>
<s> That was a great improvement for the time. </s>
<s> Bought a 300 baud modem for it and could dial into the BBS's. </s>
<s> That was pretty cool back then. </s>
<s> Could download some things but you had be sure and matchup the protocols (remember zmodem). </s>
<s> Next PC was a Gateway 486DX2..... Great memories. </s>
<s> i was born on 1991 so a im 16 right now my first Computer was when i was 4 my dad bought a Macintosh Quadra 610 and i liked it a lot specialy for games and drawing... i had that computer iuntil 1997 because i used at school Windows Computers and i started to hate the mac because i had no new Games jaja that was when i got my first Pc A Compaq Presario 3333 With Windows That was also the first time i new the internet and i still love it! </s>

<s> it was an Amstrad c 1984/5 really handy as the cassette deck was built in , well stuck on the end . </s>
<s> its really bugging me as I cant recall its full designation , erm they were navy blue if that helps jog anyones memory? </s>
<s> That would make it 1989... </s>
<s> The thing had 64 KB of memory, and had to be hooked on a TV... </s>
<s> It could load games by a USB key (lol), actually, the only way to feed it some data was through a tape recorder... Later 5 inch soft floppy came out, but it was too damn expensive for me to get... </s>
<s> Since then I've gone through - 4x86 @ 66 MHz with 4 MB Ram and 512 MB hard disk - Pentium 1 @ 133 MHz with 16 MB Ram and 1 GB hard disk (and a CD drive) - Pentium 3 @ 450 MHz with 128 MB Ram and 10 GB hard disk (and a CD burner) - Pentium 3 @ 550 MHz with 64 MB Ram (first laptop @ home) - Pentium 3 @ 800 MHz with 64 MB Ram (biggest crap I've purchased from HP) (and a DVD Rom) - P4 @ 2.6 GHz (quite a jump, but happened in 2-3 years time) with 1 GB Ram and 120 GB hard drive (wow... 2-3 years) (and a DVD Burner) - CrapBook Pro - Core 2 Duo @ 2.0 GHz, 2 GB Ram... a modern day machine (for now) that's about 7 months old now...

<s> I'll be 30 before I know it... </s>
<s> The first computer I used was a Commodore Vic 20, back in 1982 or 83 I think, and the first computer I owned was a Commodore 64, which I think I got in 1984. </s>
<s> I had an Okimate 10 color thermal printer that at the time was hot stuff. </s>
<s> That was also the first computer that I ever used to connect to my first BBS, using my lightning fast 300 baud modem. </s>
<s> At that speed, simply chatting on a DDIAL with 3 or 4 other people would sometimes have you backlogged for minutes, unable to keep up with the conversation. </s>
<s> When I got my first 1200 Baud modem (which someone kindly donated to me), I thought it was the best thing since sliced bread! </s>
<s> Commodore 64s were great for games, far better than any equivalent IBM PCs at the time, but they weren't great for much else. </s>
<s> The first &quot;real&quot; computer I owned was an antiquated Tandy 1000-25 IBM compatible that I got in 1989. </s>
<s> It was an XT, but technically it only ran at about 4MHz, not even the full 4.77 MHz that an XT should. </s>
<s> This computer was so slow it wasn't even funny, and it certainly didn't have a hard drive, just dual 5.25, low density floppies. </s>
<s> In fact, Radio Shack who manufactured the Tandy line, claimed this computer wasn't capable of supporting a hard drive under any circumstances. </s>
<s> I found that out after spending countless hours trying to install a 10MB, full height MFM hard drive brick into it. </s>
<s> Amazingly though, a good friend of mine who was a computer Guru in the true sense of the word, figured out somehow that if he soldered a small piece of metal onto the MFM controller, he could get the controller and the system to recognize the drive and we eventually got the whopping 10MB hard drive installed. </s>
<s> Things were definitely different back in the day... DOS ruled and when Windows came along, 3.11 loaded faster on an 8MHz 286 with 256K RAM and a dog slow MFM hard drive than XP does now on a 3GHz Dual Core P4 with 4 gigs of RAM and a 10,000 RPM IDE drive. </s>
<s> None of that Plug and Play crap, it was all about jumpers, com ports, and IRQs. </s>
<s> Your bios was on a floppy disk and if you misplaced it you might as well throw your computer away. </s>
<s> No internet to find and download drivers from or find information about anything, though a small percentage of companies by the early to mid 90s had a BBS, but they usually didn't have much on them and trying to find the # of the BBS to begin with wasn't easy. </s>
<s> 16 color EGA graphics were hot and 256 color VGA graphics were the wave of the future. </s>
<s> If you had an 8-bit Sound Blaster you were the man. </s>
<s> Oh and let's not forget there was no such thing as Email, just messages posted on bulletin boards. </s>
<s> CD-ROM drive? </s>
<s> What's a CD-ROM? </s>
<s> On the flip side, viruses were almost non-existent and only propogated by attaching themselves to files on your floppy, so it wasn't that hard to protect yourself and everyone used DOS based McAfee VScan. </s>
<s> There was no such thing as Spyware or Adware, what a WONDERFUL thing! </s>
<s> Things were a lot simpler in many ways, more difficult in others. </s>
<s> I have some fond memories of computers in the 80s and early 90s, but I wouldn't want to go back . </s>
<s> I believe this gentleman means Kilobits of memory not Megabits... </s>
<s> I needed {4} pieces of 256K to make 1M of SIPP memory... And I thought I was a Hot-Rod at the time </s>

<s> Have no idea who built it. </s>
<s> You pushed 7&quot; floppy discs vertically into a drive beside the screen and the keyboard was attached.....used to take ages to &quot;update&quot; your spreadsheet every time you made a new entry, so there was an option to not update the spreadsheet until you had finished all your new entries. </s>
<s> AMIGA 1000 baby! </s>
<s> YEAH! </s>
<s> So much better than the other machines out at that time. </s>
<s> AMIGA forever! </s>

<s> 1982 Televideo TS-802 running CP/M OS. </s>

<s> Visicalc and Wordstar were the only programs it had on it </s>
<s> The Timex/Sinclair ZX80. </s>
<s> Was available as a kit that you put together yourself and sold for $100.00. </s>
<s> It came with 1K RAM and 16K ROM and for another $40.00 was expanable to 16K RAM. </s>
<s> I was a great way to learn BASIC programming and for a time was a very popular computer based ob the Zilog Z80 processor. </s>

<s> When I worked for a law firm the summer of my 2nd year of law school (1981) the firm had a WANG room. </s>
<s> Climate controlled; you had to put things to be typed through a little window. </s>
<s> They let me do part of my law review article on it. </s>
<s> (I'd started with the law schools TRS-80). </s>
<s> You had to climb up onto a little platform with a special seat. </s>
<s> My very first computer was a nameless little thing that had a cassette tape drive and used the TV as a screen. </s>
<s> In 1985 we got a IBM, whichever model was before the AT. </s>
<s> I too learned BASIC and told my young son that if he ever typed &quot;format&quot; lightning would strike him dead. </s>
<s> But my very first computer experience, indirectly, was in 1967 while my then husband was in grad school. </s>
<s> He typed his programs (in Fortan, I think) onto little punch cards and submitted them to what I faultily recall as robed priests at the Stanford Computer Center. </s>
<s> I used to go over with him in the middle of the night; there was a priestless reader available where you could run your punch cards through and it would print out whatever was on them. </s>
<s> So I would type out letters home on punchcards and then print them. </s>
<s> So cool to send letters on wide lined computer paper. </s>
<s> First computer I used was an Atari 400 in the early 1980s....I also have used a Tandy TRS-80 (in school & in the early 90s at the Veterinary clinic I worked for). </s>
<s> My first PC is one I built for a company I worked for, it came in kit form. </s>
<s> It was a SOL Processor Tech. </s>
<s> I believe main memory was 4 or 8k. </s>
<s> You loaded each piece of software with a cassette deck. </s>
<s> We used it run software in a chemical lab. </s>
<s> It's side pannels were made of wood, very decorative. </s>
<s> I saved up money from my paper route and bought an Ohio Scientific OS2. </s>

<s> I think ours was the original reason the machines got the nickname &quot;TRaSh-80.&quot; It spent more time in the repair shop than it did on our desk, and eventually we were able, by dint of excellent record-keeping and threats of legal action, to return the thing and get our money back. </s>
<s> About a year later we got an Apple II+ and found out what a real computer was. </s>
<s> A few months later we got a second one and computerized our business. </s>
<s> We'd have been Apple users for life except for the fact that when they came out with hardware upgrades (the Apple IIe and subsequent models) they weren't backward compatible. </s>
<s> All of our custom programming would have had to be rewritten, and there was no guarantee that the rewrites would work with the next version of the Apples. </s>
<s> So we continued to use the II+es for as long as we could, then switched to IBM compatibles which had the advantage of backward compatibility. </s>

<s> I still have these systems (and the Atari still works). </s>
<s> Every few years I dig out the old stuff and plug everything together to make sure I remember what classic computing was like. </s>
<s> There's nothing like waiting for a cassette tape Shamus, Blue Max, Jumpman or Temple of Asphai to load. </s>

<s> If you were lucky, you could go intereractive on the green sceen terminals, or one of the two graphics terminals. </s>
<s> I remember we booked both graphics terminals one day and played 'star wars' on them. </s>
<s> I think we took a good proportion of the processor cycles to do this. </s>
<s> We also had Commodore PETS with the built in tape drives. </s>
<s> I managed to collect a large number of games for this. </s>

<s> It was an Epson QX10 with dual floppy drives (5.25) and 256k of memory. </s>
<s> It was quite high-end at the time. </s>
<s> It ran CP/M and an integrated office suite called &quot;Valdocs&quot; for valuable documents. </s>
<s> It got me through Law School and made all the difference in the world. </s>
<s> No hiring a typist. </s>
<s> I could do revisions up to the last minute. </s>
<s> It got me hooked. </s>
<s> I used it all the way until 1990, when I bought my first Mac. </s>
<s> Yeah, remember programming in Basic? </s>
<s> Remember the luxury of 80 column screens versus 40? </s>
<s> Remember the VIC (only 20 columns)? </s>
<s> Remember how 64K seemed like oodles of memory then, and oh my gosh, affordable color computers (in just 256 solid colors)? </s>
<s> Remember using cassette tapes and rewinding the tapes to store and find programs? </s>
<s> Remember the luxury of actually owning your own floppy disk drive? </s>

<s> 2 years later it was headed for the scrap pile, beat out by P3 600 Mhz </s>
<s> Early 70's I think... </s>
<s> I had been a programmer since 1964, and read as much computer stuff as I could get a hold of, so when the Imsai kit was announced I had to have it. </s>
<s> My wife was a programmer also which made it easier to justify the high cost of my hobby. </s>
<s> I had been a Design Engineer in the design labs at NCR working on their early mainframe computers in 1960, so the idea of assembling a kit computer didn't bother me at all. </s>
<s> My IMSAI 8080 (serial # 17) was a S100 bus machine with an Intel 8080 processor. </s>
<s> It initially used front panel switches to load a boot up program in binary form (a real pain), that in turn could access THE only I/O device I had at first, a Teletype KSR unit. </s>
<s> The kit had 1 memory board with 4 K of RAM originally, that I eventually maxed out at 64 K. I eventually added 4 of the 8&quot; double sided floppy disk drives as well as a kit built keyboard, a monochrome monitor, 1200 baud modem, and an Anadex dot matrix printer. </s>
<s> This all became a good little machine including Digital Research's CPM for it's operating system. </s>
<s> I finally built my 1st &quot;PC style&quot; machine with MS DOS in 1985, and am still reluctantly in the camp of M$. </s>
<s> Every once in a while I'll dip my toe into the linux pond, but I've avoided jumping in, and at 70, I doubt I will. </s>
<s> We got a TRS-80 Color Computer in December 1983. </s>
<s> It used a tape recorder as a tape drive instead of floppies, and no hard drive. </s>
<s> There was not a monitor, you hooked it up to a TV. </s>
<s> Not long after that, I got to use a TRS-80 with dual floppy drives (5.25 single sided), when I took a BASIC programing course. </s>
<s> Well, i started very early, my first pc was an 8086 from IBM, 64k of memory, CGA display and a low density diskette unit. </s>
<s> LOL, then my father buys a IBM PC286, of 8MHz and 640k of memory, then some years later i changed to a IBM 386Mhz, hdd of 60Mb, an 4Mb of memory and as a showing of riches lol, we set it with an Adlib Gold sound card. </s>
<s> As far as I can remember, the first computer I used was way back when we had a Compaq Portable. </s>
<s> If I remember correctly, that was in the early 90's. </s>
<s> I used to play Pacman and Wheel of Fortune on that Compaq for hours. </s>
<s> It ran DOS of course. </s>
<s> In the 80's I had a Commador that I played a couple of games on, but the kids wrecked it and it wasn't til the early 90's when my cousin who was a vice-president of a retailer called Software, Etc. </s>

<s> My wife complains I spend more time with my computers than I do with her. </s>
<s> She's probably right. </s>
<s> I know it dates me, but anyone out there remember the Monrobot? </s>
<s> It was a special purpose computer that was built by Monroe Calculator for Gulf Oil Corp. </s>
<s> The one I worked on was at the port of Ft. Lauderdale, had a Baudot code based processor and was used to accumulate and transmit inventory and delivery data from the oil distribution centers to Gulf Oil's central office in Jacksonville, FL. </s>
<s> It had a 100 track, 10 inch drum memory that was driven by a leather belt that required continuous cleaning to keep the belt from squeeking. </s>
<s> I helped maintain one when I was a student at University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL back in the early 60's. </s>
<s> I first fell in love with computers in 1983 when the first clones of Apple II-style keyboard and cpu units were available in the Philippines. </s>
<s> As a college student living in a 3rd world country, we were not given an affordable choice with regards to computers back then. </s>
<s> As far as I can remember, the system was MS-DOS and I have to put in a special card (I forgot the name of this card, can anyone help me remember it?) </s>

<s> In was 1982. </s>
<s> The 8th Grade Science Fair had just finished and a friend built a Sinclair ZX81 kit computer that he failed to get working. </s>
<s> But that didn't matter to me and my friends; our love affair with these new machines was set in stone. </s>
<s> The Atari VCS was at it's peak despite the release of a *very* disappointing rendition of Pac-Man. </s>
<s> Me and my friends were already &quot;computer crazy&quot;. </s>
<s> Not one of us owned a game machine like the VCS or Odyssey-2 (Intellivision was still a year away). </s>
<s> We were holding out for full-fledged computers. </s>
<s> After prolonged begging and extolling the virtues of the &quot;Commodore Vic-20&quot; to get my parents, my high-school drop-out step-father revealed that he has been looking at computers and found the &quot;Atari 400&quot; to be the superior machine. </s>
<s> I disagreed and we immediately went to the mall to compare the two. </s>
<s> The computer store in the mall had an Atari 400 parked in front running a near perfect rendition of Pac-Man that was attracting customers like flies. </s>
<s> The 400's flat membrane keyboard was a real turn-off, but when I learned it came with nearly THREE times as much memory (16K) as the Vic-20 (which, despite its name, only came with 5K), and seeing the quality of the game that was running, I quickly concluded the Atari-400 was the better machine. </s>
<s> Rare was the time I admitted my step-father was right, so he immediately bought a 400 on the spot. </s>
<s> To our disappointment though, they were out of Pac-Man cartridges, so I had to settle for a low-quality game stored on cassette tape called &quot;Maze of Death&quot;. </s>
<s> In the years to come, I taught myself how to program in BASIC and even started dabbling in &quot;Assembly Language&quot;. </s>
<s> By the time I reached college, I had a HUGE jump-start on the other students and Aced every programming course. </s>

<s> It was certainly worth the $200.00 dollars I payed for it. </s>
<s> The first computer I bought was in 1986, it was a Commadore 128 which ran CP/M, C64, and C128 programs and I paid about $1000 for it plus a color monitor. </s>
<s> In 1987 I bought my first Amiga, a 500 also for about $1000 with monitor and in 1989 (or was it 90) I splurged and bought an Amiga 4000 with a 68040 chip, 2 megs of chip ram and 8 megabite memory card with multi sync monitor for about $2500. </s>

<s> Specialist in Systems/Network Administration/Management. </s>
<s> My work was on Concurrent/Perkin Elmer/Masscomp medium systems & networked 286/386/486 PC's (self-taught). </s>
<s> I never would've made it thru SDSU w/o my Mac: I bought a Mac in &quot;The 1st 100 Days&quot;, on March 6, 1984 after seeing the Super Bowl ad in January & have had 1 ever since. </s>
<s> It had 1 800/400 KB floppy drive, 256 KB of RAM, no HD, a sharp B&W display, & an Image Writer dot-matrix printer. </s>
<s> It was the 1st computer that I could see any use for @ home. </s>
<s> I had turned down the opportunity to buy a full-blown Apple IIE clone in Taiwan because I couldn't see what I would use it for! </s>
<s> I hooked my Mac up to the Internet with a 1200/300 baud modem and spent many an &quot;all-nighter&quot; doing assignments after the on-campus computer labs were closed. </s>

<s> The first personal computer that I used was an HP (can't remember the name), which was a portable witha small screen--similar to one from compact. </s>
<s> It predated the IPM PC, but was probably concurrent with the first Apple II's. </s>
<s> I learned VisiCalc using it, but quickly found that the desk type HP's did not use the same OS, so I could not transfer the info from one to the other. </s>
<s> I think this was in the fall of 1981 or 1982. </s>
<s> The computers were owned by the company. </s>
<s> Taking the need to transfer data by the &quot;sneakerdisk&quot; method to heart, my first purchase of a personal computer was an IBM PC. </s>
<s> This was to match the PC's that were purchased at my new employer for both design work and letters so that I could use the &quot;sneakernet&quot; approach. </s>
<s> Software was pfs Write and File along with Lotus 1-2-3. </s>
<s> A lot of simple engineering design calculations could be made in spreadsheet format and templates, along with finance calculations. </s>
<s> I recall an income tax estimator &quot;program&quot; (template). </s>
<s> We also tracked my wife's business inventory using 1-2-3 for several years. </s>
<s> Shortly after purchasing the IBM PC I won a drawing for a TI Professional. </s>
<s> The machine came with Lotus 1-2-3. </s>
<s> This became a hobby machine and I found several improvements at the various PC swap meets. </s>
<s> I bought a hard disk upgrade and a sound card for peanuts. </s>
<s> Also, several software programs (used) over the years. </s>
<s> Also, there was a 286 card upgrade with 1Meg memory that converted the TI Pro to a 286 which could run PC software. </s>
<s> TI had an outstanding impact printer with great fonts that we purchased before our first laser printer. </s>
<s> In the pre- laser printer days, we also used an electric typewriter with a serial connection for quality letters. </s>
<s> The shareware word processing program, PC Write, had been converted to run on the TI Pro so that was used for both the IBM and the TI. </s>
<s> It was a snap to have various printer code templates stored, so that the document could easily go from one printer to another. </s>
<s> I first started using computers in the 1970's. </s>
<s> They were DOS systems, had 5inch floppy disks, then one of the early macs, then onto mainframes and PC's. </s>
<s> When windows 95 came, It was like being in another world! </s>
<s> I used a wide range of applications, studied programs like COBOL, FORTRAN and BASIC and of course the Windows stuff. </s>
<s> When using Macs for the first time I liked to write progrms in BASIC for jokes. </s>
<s> For example, I created one that when booted, the attached printer, which was an old teletype machine, would start printing some kind of countdown saying This machine will self destruct in 10 seconds and then start a series of moving the platen up and down until switched off. </s>
<s> Now that I have &quot;grown up&quot; (my humour is the same) I have just switched over to Macintosh again and am giving Bill Gates the flick. </s>

<s> My first PC was a Sanyo 770 portable, or should I say luggable and the size of a full size sewing machine. </s>
<s> It weighed about 50-60 lbs., had the keyboard as a base for the computer and cost about $3,000. </s>
<s> It was purchased to take between my office and home. </s>
<s> It had a built-in (color, yes I said color, monitor). </s>
<s> It came with 128kb of ram with two 5.25in DS/DD floppy disks. </s>
<s> I used it for word processing and mailing lists. </s>
<s> This is the computer that taught me that packaged software with a computer is not always a bargain. </s>
<s> I purchased a Canon Dot Matrix printer to use with it which really limited the portability of all this equipment. </s>
<s> I thought I was King of the block because it was twice as fast as the office machine which was an IBM PC at 4.77MHz. </s>
<s> I eventually put in a 32MB harddrive and a multi-function card to expand the memory to the max for DOS of 640kb. </s>
<s> The upgrades alone cost about $800. </s>

<s> Rapid planned obsolecence of computers and computer media seems to be an even worse problem than what has happened in audio. </s>
<s> My first computer was a KayPro PC with two floppy drives. </s>
<s> This was an &quot;IBM-compatible&quot; rather than a clone because of its proprietary backplane architecture. </s>
<s> I later added a Seagate 30 MB hard drive and a modem. </s>
<s> One of the floppies failed; it cost $150 to replace it! </s>

<s> It came with a fully loaded 48 KB of ram and I bought the Atari Basic cartridge. </s>
<s> My programs were all stored on tape cassettes and, sadly, most of those are all dead now. </s>

<s> It was purchased on a deep discount sale at SEARS for about $600 (regular price was $999), and this was 1981 dollars. </s>
<s> Translated into current money, that $600 is about $1,415 for a machine running a CPU at 1.79 MHz and with a 320x192 maximum graphics resolution. </s>

<s> It was an IBM PS/2 Model 4, if I remember correctly. </s>
<s> I bought it in 1986 or 1987 because I was taking a graduate level course in Technical Writing and Editing at N.C. State University and, since I was working full time, I didn't want to have to rely on a computer being available in their lab for doing the coursework. </s>
<s> It was fairly expensive, about $4,500. </s>
<s> I had to buy an Apple Laserjet printer because no other laser printer was available at the time. </s>
<s> The printer cost about $4,000 and weighed a ton. </s>
<s> The salesperson had to write a macro for me to run each time I needed to turn the printer on so the Apple printer could talk to the IBM PC (they should put that in their commercial). </s>
<s> I have neither the computer nor the printer now. </s>
<s> I was hired as a COBOL mainframe programmer in 1978 and worked on an IBM 370 that was housed in a large data center in London. </s>
<s> It was accessed through &quot;dumb&quot; terminals located in the bank I worked for in the Wall Street area, NYC. </s>

<s> A test was given to anyone who showed up and lived in Tarrant County and the top ten scores were offered the seats. </s>
<s> I was lucky enough to earn one of those seats. </s>
<s> We saw one computer. </s>
<s> It was at a steel company and filled the perimeter of a large room and we could walk around the room and follow the computer's computing progress (meaning it was pretty slow). </s>
<s> In those days everything was done using desk debugging and a programmer had a time slot on one day each week. </s>
<s> If their program was not ready to go, they had to wait until the next week. </s>
<s> Shortly after that, don't remember the exact date, Texas Instruments came out with the TI 99-4A which I immediately purchased. </s>
<s> It had 4k memory and used a cassette tape for storage. </s>
<s> Of course, it was programmed in basic. </s>
<s> I wrote a program to calculate auto insurance rates in Texas, which was huge at the time, and would run out of memory frequently and would have to go back and rewrite some of the lines of code to gain more memory so I could finish the program. </s>
<s> I would go into the study to work on the program for a couple of hours and suddenly realize I had been there 5 or 6 hours. </s>
<s> In the end, the program served its purpose very well and was used for quite some time. </s>
<s> I loved that machine and have not gotten as much thrill working on any computer since as I did that one. </s>

<s> It was an IBM (I think.) </s>
<s> Anyway the next chance I go to get my hands on a computer was when I took another computer class (again in programming) at La Verne College in California. </s>
<s> It was an Apple IIe. </s>
<s> Finally I got my hands on a computer to use at work and learned about the programs. </s>
<s> The company sent me to class to learn Access and they had mini classes in other Microsoft programs at work for all of us to learn to run the machines. </s>
<s> I was put in charge of a program that monitored all the machines in the production floor. </s>
<s> It was written in QNX (a cousin to Linux) and now it is run on Unix. </s>
<s> I am still working with it and trained myself to run the program. </s>
<s> Again I bought all kinds of books on Unix and Computers. </s>
<s> A Co-worker teased me about spending my money on books when I could get a machine and start using it instead of reading about it. </s>
<s> I said, yes, but if something went wrong with it I wouldn't know how to fix it. </s>
<s> I eventually joined the NRI school to learn programming again. </s>
<s> They sent me a machine, a 286 generic with 16 megs of memory. </s>
<s> I went through the first part of the training and got anxious to complete it. </s>
<s> (I never completed the course even though I paid the full $3,000.) </s>
<s> I installed a CD rom and Sound Blaster card in that machine. </s>
<s> I went on to build my own. </s>
<s> I still have the one from the school even though I don't run it anymore. </s>
<s> The one I built is an AMD 586. </s>
<s> I bought the machine at a second hand store, brought it home and rebuilt it from the motherboard up. </s>
<s> Since then I have bought several from the second hand store and got them up and running. </s>
<s> I got my son interested to doing this and gave him several of the machines to see what he could do with them. </s>
<s> He never completed school, but he can get a machine up and running. </s>
<s> Right now I am a 66 year old still learning how to make the machine do what I want it to. </s>

<s> Sorry I keep gushing but this thing is the best thing since American cheese came sliced thin &lt;g&gt;. </s>
<s> My first contact with a computer was an old Compaq LTE5300 series laptop. </s>
<s> It was thicker than Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix, the screen was 12&quot; and ran on 16-bit color, it had a 113MHz Intel processor, an external CD-ROM drive (upgrade) and a very miniscule hard drive that I can't even remember. </s>
<s> It ran Windows 95 because Windows 98 didn't come out yet then. </s>
<s> Friends and myself had a number of early personal computers- Atari 800/800XL, Vic-20, C-64, Timex/Sinclair 1000, Commodore 16/+4, not to mention the early video game consoles- Atari 2600/5200, Magnavox Odyssey2, Colecovision, Intellivision, and the best system at the time- the original Nintendo NES. </s>
<s> Most of these golden age home computers have emulators available that run pretty well on a pc, you just need to do some searching to find them. </s>
<s> ie: for C-64 try the VICE emulator- http://www.viceteam.org/ and there's good emulators for Atari and other computers as well. </s>
<s> Amiga 1000. </s>
<s> A thousand curses on Commodore for botching their business and sinking their machines. </s>
<s> I would love to see what the design team would have done to stay ahead of everyone else if they were still together. </s>
<s> Followed by an A2000 and then A3000. </s>
<s> My wife went to the dark side and I got an IBM Aptiva as the next upgrade. </s>
<s> I have been homebrew builder since then. </s>
<s> Nothing fancy, I just haven't seen the advantage of Dell, Gateway, or HP for desktops without incredible incentives that don't show up. </s>
<s> Still think that the TI 99/4A never reached it's full potential. </s>
<s> The TMS 9900 chipset was top flight military chip. </s>
<s> Had full system with peripheral expansion box and hard drives. </s>
<s> TI marketing never appreciated the product and gave feeble support. </s>
<s> TI extended basic Gave very high accuracy decimal calculations, like a scientific calculator. </s>
<s> Please at my young age I only started using a PC in the early 2000's, but back then at school I didn't care for computers . </s>
<s> I got my first PC in November 2005 and have been getting into them ever since. </s>
<s> It's a custom made PC so no branding. </s>
<s> Not much of a story I suppose... </s>
<s> Boy, you just brought back some memories with that Casio organizer; I traveled all over with that stuff. </s>
<s> I went through a few of them and constantly got the newer models with more memory. </s>
<s> Neat little gadgets! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Started in '86 w/ Comodore 64 - not quite a PC by our standarts but... Ilearned basic programing, wrote a payroll program, I used all they way through 1992 long after my first real PC Info: Actually started rewriting rhe program in Machine code throgh a compiler (Merlin) and though never finished it, the function in code worked just as fast as C++ under win 3.1 on a 386 - Thats why I'll always keep griping about these oversized slow monsters written by the current programers. </s>
<s> Dec 1989 (or was it 88) bought a 383 2x25MHz, 4 meg, 40 mg hard drive 15&quot; monitor for $ 2800 ... and thats where the empty wallet started (90) 300 for a second 40 meg RLL/MFM drive (90) 1100 for a 212 meg SCSI drive (91) 980 for a double speed external CD rom (91) 3000 for a Laser printer w/ 600 dpi enhancment card 1600 for a 486 and motherboard which could hold 1 gig Meg in memory *** Too bad that would have cost 10,000 to populate *** (92) 2800 for a color ink-jet ( well it was 17&quot; wide trackt) My cellphone can almost do what all my old PC's could do together and my new PC - 1 Ghz Pent, with 1 gig , 4 + 80 Gig drives, DVD burner , cheap ink-jet all for less than 700 a couple of years ago. </s>
<s> - and oh yeah how much would my one gig have been in 91 --- $ 10,000 - now 50-100. makes me feel prety stupid </s>
<s> You should be right and the killer was it took 4 for 1 meg - BITTs and therefor we ended up with 4 x 9 per megabite - 4 meg of memory took the space of a laptop - well floor space anyway - obviously not height. </s>
<s> Ah the old times and if these guys whant to talk about pre-PC's lets see at my Fathers NCR operated office 64 K of actice memory was the size of a desk and Hardrives like washing mashines with individuall platter units stacked on a spindel that was dropped top loaded into the darn thing - 14&quot; mad tape reels ruled the world. </s>
<s> It all took about 1000 sq feet do do less than my HP-21 calculator (except for storrage) </s>
<s> i started using a personal computer when i was in my college time that was 1999 its my 3rd year in college my pc was a pentium IIIMMX technology only 400Mhz processor but i used to play before a 3d game which is the counterstrike game which i know it was very popular to all..my computer was still fast before because i was only using a windows 98 with 128mb memory...but when i did have updated with a windows xp my pc gets slower and i can't play my counterstrike game anymore...only games that are not 3d can be played...but i still love my first pc...cliff </s>
<s> The first time I started using a personal computer was in the 80s. </s>
<s> 1- A pocket computer from Casio ( http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~wayrich/computer-history/fx702p.jpg ) 2- Then a SINCLAIR ZX 81 ( http://content.answers.com/main/content/wp/en-commons/thumb/b/b5/280px-Sinclair_ZX81.jpg ) 3- then came the NCR Decision Mate V ( http://www.zock.com/8-Bit/D_DMate.HTML ) which I traded with 4- a ATARI 520 STF ( http://shopping.ntcstudios.co.uk/images/atari_st_520_computer_and_monitor_1.gif ), 5- and then a ATARI 1040 STE. </s>
<s> I traded the ATARI 1040 STE with 6- a Personal computer (a PC Pentium 1). </s>
<s> Take care everyone. </s>
<s> Wow, you guys are stirring up fond memories. </s>
<s> The first system I worked on was a GE S-200 series. </s>
<s> The next system I worked on was the Philco 900 which got replaced by an RCA Spectra 70... that was our DMV's first on-line system. </s>
<s> Mag cards were pretty cool. </s>
<s> In 1967 I went to work for a service bureau as a computer operator on a Burroughs B-260. </s>
<s> It had a whopping 4.8K memory, 2 card readers, a punch and a 700 LPM drum printer. </s>
<s> A while later I ended up working with a Burroughs B-1700, B-3500 and the B-4700. </s>
<s> Burroughs had some pretty neat things in their OS, but the hardware was not very reliable. </s>
<s> Oh for the days when RSI was unknown. </s>
<s> The first personal computer I had was an IBM PC. </s>
<s> I worked with them at work too and we had a couple of Tandy 1500's. </s>
<s> We ended up standardizing on the IBM. </s>
<s> I ended up with a PC XT-286 that I ran the legs off and upgraded the motherboard to one with an AMD 386-40. </s>
<s> That sucker ran all the way until I built my own box with a Pentium 166 MMX a number of years later. </s>
<s> The only reason I replaced it was because it just wasn't quite fast enough. </s>
<s> It was bulletproof otherwise... never a bit of trouble. </s>
<s> As a Mechanical Engineer, I worked in Research Wing of Indian Railways in Lucknow (India) from 1968 to 1971 and was given a weeks training by IBM in FORTRAN-IV. </s>
<s> Then I started developing programmes for the Railways, traversing on alternate days, all the way to IIT Kanpur ( About 50 miles away, local transport, rail and then again local transport), punched cards there, got them listed and submitted them to the computer center (Main Frame 4406 or some similar number. </s>
<s> I am not sure now) spending almost whole day, and would get the result on my next visit, again to revise and re-submit for further run. </s>
<s> Left Railways in 1971 to join a steel plant and had nothing to do with computers for next 30 years. </s>
<s> Now I am retired, own a PC as pastime, initiated by my NIIT trained daughter, have learnt *** bits of C++, made a few programmes, and run them by F4 and F9, a matter of one or two seconds, performing a task which necessitated commuting for whole day in 1968-71. </s>
<s> (NARENDER KUMAR ) </s>
<s> It was sometime in the mid-90s, when we started to use computers in schools. </s>
<s> At first, I hated computers with a passion. </s>
<s> I got frustrated very easily and never wanted to use one again. </s>
<s> A few months afterwards, my parents purchased a Packard Bell machine, and I began playing with it more. </s>
<s> I still find it funny that I at first despised computers, and now cannot live without them! </s>
<s> I had my first computer on 1988, it was an IMB XT, an old dinasour with 10MB HDD, 128KB RAM, 5.25&quot; FDD and a very slow processor (Intel 8088 - 4.7MHz). </s>
<s> With a DOS operating system and monochrome CRT monitor (green characters). </s>
<s> At that time I had to connect to the primitive Internet (Usenet) thru a dial-up US Robotics modem of 9.6Kbps. </s>
<s> A lot of water has flowed under the bridge since then. </s>
<s> I don't know if you would call this a personal computer or not but you could program with it and, with the help of Visa Calc, you could do business on it. </s>
<s> I think I enjoyed the basic programming the most but I used it practically as well. </s>
<s> My first IBM compatible was a Compaq duel floppy, 5 1/4&quot; drives. </s>
<s> Had 512k but I upgraded it to 640k, now I was really flying. </s>
<s> Had to have the operating system on one floppy and the program on the other. </s>
<s> Ahhh sweet monochrome days. </s>
<s> I remember that if you put a notch on the other side of the floppy, you could make a dual sided floppy. </s>
<s> Seemed to only work on good quality disks. </s>
<s> I have now have more memory on usb flash drive than a whole stack of MFM full height drives that I later had for my pc. </s>
<s> Who says size doesn't matter? </s>
<s> Man! </s>
<s> I can't believe I never bothered to check for replies to my post, way back. </s>
<s> My thanks to Willy, newkiki, aultwa and isaacm30 for you posts. </s>
<s> Fond memories of days gone by, with Wang. </s>
