i just got a second monitor, plug and play worked and was fine even though my main (laptop) was 1280 x 800 and the second screen is 1024 x 768. it went to sleep.
i woke up my laptop, and both screens showed the waking up loading windows, then the second screen went black.
before, it still let me use the second screen even though i couldn't see anything, now i can't extend to the second screen through display settings.
if i try now, the laptop seems to get set to the lowest display settings possible, and the second screen stays dark.
help?
