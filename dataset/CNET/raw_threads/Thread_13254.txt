But recently, when I'm done transferring files from my external HD to my computer and I close all the windows and safely removed the hardware an error message saying: &quot;The device 'Generic Volume' cannot be stopped right now. Try stopping the device again later.&quot; I also have tried to go to some other drive first like my C: drive and then go to my documents files and close everything and refresh the whole dekstop and when I try again the error message appeared again! I wonder howcome there's no program running but the HD can't be stopped. Is there like any hidden program running at the background that I may not notice? please help!

Processes don't just stop immdeiately when you click on the X at right corner of a window. You may want to wait a while. If that doesn't work, just wank the thing off. It won't cause any serious problems... err... usually... And what is with Generic Volumes? Isn't there a driver or something? o_O
