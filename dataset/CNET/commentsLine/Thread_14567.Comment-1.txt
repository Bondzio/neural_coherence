hello i got an imac and i'm looking for an external hard drive that i need.
i don't record or do movies and games.
i've got music, pictures, docs done in excel and word.
i'm not sure what to get: -portable or non-portable -what size?
1tb or less than 1tb -what brand that is compatible to a mac?
i appreciate your recommendation or suggestion.
thanks, jake
