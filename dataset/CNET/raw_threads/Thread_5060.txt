The most important factor for a new card is audio quality for MP3 and games. I have 4.1 creative speakers so 7.1 capabilities aren't really necessary. I was thinking about the audigy 2 gamer or audigy 2 zs.

Looking to build a new system for college that'll last awhile. The gamer card is pretty expensive though. Hopefully it'll come down by late may.
