<s> Pretty simple question, but I thought this would be a great bunch to ask. </s>
<s> Where is the cheapest place to buy a hundred feet or so of CAT 5 cable. </s>
<s> I need to do some routing through my house. </s>
<s> It is for stuff that I can't do wirelessly. </s>
<s> I know that the cable is pretty cheap, but I have a feeling that the local stores are going to try and gouge Joe average consumer. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> newegg.com and http://www.geeks.com/products.asp?cat=CBL#NetworkCables In closing, it's not wired 1 to 1, 2 to 2 etc... You must get the pairing right or else. </s>

<s> Hello! </s>
<s> We order our cable from a great company called Deepsurplus.com along with the jacks that we use for our business. </s>
<s> It is about 44.00 for 1000'. </s>
<s> Make sure you order cat5e not just cat5 whoever you order from. </s>
<s> You can also buy cat5e by the foot, or a 500' box from home depot for about 40.00, 1000' for 55.00. </s>
<s> The jacks are pricey--about 5.00 ea., or 30.00 for 10 at the depot. </s>
<s> Cheaper at the surplus and the delivery time with the company is great. </s>
<s> Good luck on your project, and remember to keep your cable away from all your electrical lines when running it. </s>
<s> I bought this from compgeeks. </s>
<s> It has the crimpers and ends, so you can make up any cables that you need. </s>
<s> 300ft roll cat5e/. </s>
