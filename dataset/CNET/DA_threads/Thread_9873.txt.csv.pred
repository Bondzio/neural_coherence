1.1.1	hard drive for my laptop ( HP Pavillion zx5000 ) .	St
1.1.2	It currently has 512MB of RAM and 56.8GB of total Hard Drive space .	St
1.1.3	I would like to expand both but I know that there are limits to RAM and the limit depends on the laptop .	St
1.1.4	What would be the limit and in accordance to the limit of RAM my laptop can handle , how much can I expand my hard drive ?	Ques
1.1.5	Other specs would include an Intel Pentium 4 processor that gets 2.80Ghz .	St
1.1.6	The laptop is already 4 years old .	St
1.2.1	much RAM you can install .	St
1.2.2	But how much RAM your system can actually use depends on the OS ... .you did n't indicate that .	St
1.2.3	Re hard drives ... might look here http : //www.seagate.com/www/en-us/products/laptops/momentus/ or http : //www.wdc.com/en/products/productcatalog.asp ? t=1 & language=en VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	I 'm not sure where my manual would be but I 'll try looking for it .	St
1.3.2	Thanks for listing these sources .	St
1.4.1	download it from the mfg 's web site .	St
1.4.2	Re the OS ... with any Window OS except XP Pro 64 bit and Vista Premium 64-bit , you 're limited to about about 3.5GBs RAM .	St
1.4.3	VAPCMD	St
1.5.1	I am going to dual-boot XP Pro 32 bit with Ubuntu 64 bit .	St
1.5.2	Would the extra RAM do harm to XP Pro , or would it just sit there not doing much ?	Ques
1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	There can be problems if you put RAM in all the slots of your motherboard .	St
1.7.2	Sometimes it 's fine .	St
1.7.3	Other times the controller ca n't keep its voltage high enough for all 4 sticks .	St
1.7.4	That problem , if it arises , wo n't be with 32-bit XP , but rather with the hardware .	St
1.8.1	If it acts up , retest the RAM .	St
1.8.2	If unstable under load ... bump the voltage in small increments 'til it stabilizes .	St
1.8.3	Let us know .	St
1.8.4	VAPCMD	St
1.9.1	I was thinking of putting 5GB of RAM in my system and it will take up three of the four slots .	St
1.10.1	your PC ( motherboard manual ) and using matching pairs for dual channel operation .	St
1.10.2	Failure to follow those guidelines often leads to unstable operation and lower performance .	St
1.10.3	VAPCMD	St
1.11.1	If I have my two 2 Gigs sticks of RAM in the proper dual channel slots and the 1 Gig stick is occupying another slot , would that affect performance at all ?	Ques
1.12.1	with 2GB in the dual channel mode ( 128Mbits ) vice 3GB in the non-dual channel mode .	St
1.12.2	The only way to really tell is test it with one of the memory benchmarks .	St
1.12.3	Let us know what you find .	St
