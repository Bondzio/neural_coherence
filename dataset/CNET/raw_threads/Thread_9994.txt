My first thought is to try the monitor on another machine if possible and/or check your PC with another monitor. This considerably narrows the possibilities. You rule in or out what's the easiest to do. You can also see if the anomaly exists while running in safe mode. If you still have the scan lines in safe mode, it's more likely the monitor or display card. If not, you start looking at the driver, some setting, or the monitor's failure to respond to it properly.

I don't know what the difference is between LCD, CRT, or any other type. The scannlines are thin horizontal lines that are constantly there, just like on old TVs except computer graphics aren't designed to work with them. We can't hook the computer up to another monitor. Yes, the problem is still there in safe mode.

7502	6	534856	5172334	5172300	Steven Haninger	7/23/11 4:01 PM	1.31143686E12	Sorry, I mistook your reply as the PC's hardware	Ok, here's what I'd do to rule out the OS. Can you download some &quot;Live Linux&quot; iso or even some utility iso and burn to CD. See if the lines are still there. If they are, it's not Windows. You're left with the display card or the monitor or cable. If the cable is detachable, you can try another or just reseat things. I suspect you have. You're going to run out of options if you cannot try another monitor or plug this one into another PC but, if it came down to only the video display device or monitor, my guess would be the monitor has the problem.
