i want to share some files on the network.
i am in city 1, and have a buddy in city 2 that i want to share a drive with.
i want him to have read only access for most of the files, but want to designate one folder in which he can write files.
my main system is a desktop using windows xp pro, and i am behind a dlink firewall/router.
i also have a wireless notebook running xp home on the same router, and of course i myself also want to have full access the files from that computer as well.
another possibility i am looking at is to make some folders and files on the shared drive publicly read-only, so that i can sort of use it as a server to host some larger files that i make available via my blog.
i have two scenarios i am considering.. the first is one of those new network drives that i can plug into my router.
can this be done, so that my friend in city 2 can have access to the drive, even though i am behind the firewall?
this would be the preferred method, since i would not have to leave my systems powered up, just my router.
the downside of this solution is that i would need to buy a network drive.
the other scenario, is to share an existing external hd on my desktop system (xp pro), but of course, this would mean i need to leave the system on in order for him to access the drive.
the upside of this solution is that i already have several external drives available to share, and would not need to buy a network drive.
can either of these solutions be done, and if so, specifically how?
if this has already been addressed and answered, just point me to the the link.. thanks!
