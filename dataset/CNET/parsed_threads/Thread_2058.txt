<s> Hi, My friend let me borrow her SimpleTech 500mb external hard drive. </s>
<s> When I plugged it in, it doesn't do anything. </s>
<s> The computer doesn't recognize it.. nothing. </s>
<s> At least I know it's not the power because the light turns on. </s>
<s> We called Simpletech and they said that it was probably dropped. </s>
<s> They said to open it and try connecting it to the computer directly. </s>
<s> My PC is IDE and not SATA so is there another way to do this. </s>
<s> I know it's not my USB ports because I have two external hard drives myself and it works just fine. </s>
<s> My friend wants me to recover it since GeekSquad charges alot and I know it's something simple. </s>
<s> I've recovered internal hard drives before but not external. </s>
<s> Simpletech External Hard Drive has a Mitshubishi Hard Drive. </s>
<s> If you are shopping for one, I would highly recommend not getting this one. </s>
<s> I have a Seagate Free Agent and it works great. </s>
<s> No problems for me and I use it alot. </s>
<s> Platform: Windows XP </s>
<s> You replace the case first. </s>
<s> The led light is connected to only 1 of the 2 power supplies so it is NEVER a test you can rely on. </s>
<s> After you replace the case, then you replace the drive. </s>
<s> There are only 2 parts to such things. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
