i currently have a wireless network with a cable modem.
i am thinking of switching to dsl because it is cheaper.
do i need to have one computer on at all times for the dsl network to work?
i can't find a direct answer to this question.
all i want is to be able to have my wireless network on like it is now so that any computer (and the tivo) in our house can connect at anytime.
is it possible to do this with a dsl connection?
thanks for the help.
