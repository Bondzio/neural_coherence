<s> I'm looking at an Asus F50 laptop and it says &quot;G120&quot; graphics but I'm not sure what this is...is it the rumored &quot;G102M&quot; product I saw a story about a while back? </s>
<s> there's not such thing as a g120 in a netbook. </s>
<s> the asus f50/f70 are laptops for folks &quot;on the go&quot;. </s>
<s> the f50gx using nvidia 9400m graphics; the f50z using an ati gpu that's slightly faster. </s>
<s> the &quot;g120&quot; (if it exists) is a rebranded nvidia 9500 (the &quot;g100&quot; is a 9400; and &quot;g130&quot; is a 9600. google gts 250 and you'll see that it's the new brand for the 9800gtx). </s>
<s> there' nothing special or revolutionary in this lineup. </s>
<s> essentially just another rebadging/shuffling of model numbers. </s>
<s> Although on balance I guess it makes mobile GPUs more in line with the GTX series of desktop ones (and desktop replacement notebook GPUs). </s>
