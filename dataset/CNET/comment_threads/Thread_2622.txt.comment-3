Thanks for getting back to me.
Maybe I shouldn't have used &quot;back-up&quot; to explain what I was trying to do.
Basically, I need a place to off-load all my files so I can upgrade to Tiger from Jaguar.
There's some glitch preventing a simple install, so the Apple people told me I need to start from scratch, which will erase my HD.
With 25 GBs of stuff, I figured an external HD made the most sense for simple storage for this task and future, general storage.
I was considering a LaCie product but reviews are mixed.
Western Digital might make sense, as would Iomega, but does that come pre-formatted for PC.
As ytou can tell, I'm pretty green when it comes to this stuff.
