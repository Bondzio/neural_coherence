1.1.1	Lately I 've decided i wanted to upgrade my computer , and seeing as how my CPU , amount of RAM , and pretty much all other components are fine , I looked to my seemingly ancient 7800GTX 256mb video card , and wondered how i should upgrade it .	St
1.1.2	I 've been reading around , but I remain confused as to whether it is more cost/performance efficient to get two 512 mb cards or a single 1 gb card .	St
1.1.3	I 'm not sure how big a factor memory alone is to how good a video card is , and am wondering to what extent , if any if the memory is the same , 2 GPU 's would have an advantage over 1 .	St
1.1.4	My confusion arose out of that 2 512 cards would have the same amount of memory as memory as a 1 gb card , and yet a 1 gb card would seem to be cheaper .	St
1.1.5	For that matter , would there be any other better solution to this , generally my budget for this would be around 400-600 dollars .	St
1.2.1	if it does n't have dual pci-express x16 slots , dual cards are out of the question .	St
1.2.2	for nvidia sli , you 'd need a mobo based on an sli chipset .	St
1.2.3	amd crossfire works best with ati or intel chipsets .	St
1.2.4	if your mobo can support dual cards , then you need to decide on your budget .	St
1.2.5	2 geforce 9600gt cards ( $ 280 ) is faster than a 9800gtx ( also $ 280 ) in some games but slower in others .	St
1.2.6	http : //www.xbitlabs.com/articles/video/display/geforce9600gt-sli_6.html # sect1 any cards below the 9600gt are n't worth sli since they 'll be outperformed by a single 9600gt .	St
1.2.7	likewise , crossfired ati radeons are generally outperformed by their nvidia counterparts at the same price point .	St
