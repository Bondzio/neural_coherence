i would try three things: 1) place the hard drive on the ide 0 channel(that's the first channel) without anything else on ide 1(that's the second channel).
see if it boots cleanly.
2) try the same except this time on ide 1, with nothing on ide 0. what do you get?
3) call the vendor you got it from and get the machine fixed.
