ok when i started my computer up it was fine but after 2 min.
it started up it crashed.
it rebooted and norton goback said that it had encountered a problem and reestarted the computer so it could not crash.
it also said that if it dident reboot drive #1 would have crashed.
i tried everything to get back to my operating system safe mode ( still rebotted)...... i tried to disable goback but it wouldent let me.
it always froze.
can anyone help me fix my computer?
