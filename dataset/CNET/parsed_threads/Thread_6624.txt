<s> Hello everyone, I'm just looking to upgrade from my old computer to something a little more modern. </s>
<s> I mostly use the the computer to browse the internet and play games. </s>
<s> I'm not looking to spend too much on a new PC but this is the best deal i have found: DELL XPS 420 PROCESSOR: Intel Core2 Q6600 Quad-Core (8MB L2 cache,2.4GHz,1066FSB) OPERATING SYSTEM: Genuine Windows Vista Home Premium with Digital Cable Support MEMORY: 4GB Dual Channel DDR2 SDRAM at 667MHz - 4 DIMMs HARD DRIVE: 500GB - 7200RPM, SATA 3.0Gb/s, 16MB Cache OPTICAL DRIVE: Blu-ray Disc Combo (DVD+/-RW + BD-ROM) MONITORS: No Monitor VIDEO CARD: 512MB Nvidia GeForce 8800 GT SOUND CARD: Integrated 7.1 Channel Audio TV TUNER & VIDEO XCELERATOR: Hauppauge HVR1250 Hybrid TV Tuner and Remote KEYBOARD: Dell USB Keyboard MOUSE: Dell Optical USB Mouse BLUETOOTH AND MEDIA READER: Dell 19 in 1 Media Reader with Bluetooth FLOPPY & MEDIA READER: Dell Media Card Reader included in Dell Bluetooth Package WI-FI AND MODEM: 56K PCI Data Fax Modem All this runs for $1,214.92 with taxes and shipping. </s>
<s> Tell me what you guys think. </s>
<s> Good deal, I am seriously considering purchasing that machine. </s>
<s> I would recommend a downgrade of the RAM from 4gb down to 3gb (Windows 32bit can only use a maximum of 3.3 gb). </s>
<s> And I noticed that you're &quot;upgrading&quot; from the original 3gb that runs at 800Mhz, the 3gb at 800Mhz is more suitable for gaming. </s>
<s> Also, keep in mind though, that there have been numerous Dell threads that talk about how the eSATA port doesn't work. </s>
<s> It's fixable, but the current solution is a complete clean reinstall of Vista. </s>
<s> If that's not a huge problem for you, then this deal definitely looks really sweet. </s>
<s> I'm going to decide on this config by the end of the day... yes or no... hmmm..

<s> I'm considering this configuration (almost) also, but they don't offer it with Windows XP. </s>
<s> They do offer their XPS 210 computers with XP. </s>
<s> I'm going to call them today to see if they'll make an exception. </s>
<s> yeah the eSATA isn't really a big deal for me. </s>
<s> So i should just get it with the 3gb then huh? </s>
<s> im down for that too. </s>
<s> I really wanted this to be available with XP too. </s>
<s> I've heard of way too many glitches and problems with vista. </s>
<s> Is there anything else that i need if i wanted to use my 42&quot; HDTV with this machine? </s>
<s> if so what else would i need? </s>
<s> hey if you give them a call can you let me know what they said? </s>
<s> if they say yeah then id give them a call as well </s>
<s> Just finished chatting with the Dell guy. </s>
<s> Getting this computer with XP just isn't an option. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any experience installing XP on this computer, or is it a &quot;Vista&quot; Centric computer? </s>
<s> i remember somebody telling me that one can install both OS on the same computer and that you get the option of choosing whether you want to use XP or vista. </s>
<s> I remember reading that somewhere a long time ago. </s>
<s> Anybody know if i right or wrong? </s>
<s> As you can probably tell im not really great at computers. </s>
