On the main directory there are 4 folders. 3 of them are movies and the 4th folder contains about 7,000 other documents (.txt, .php, .tpl, .gif, etc.) amongst several sub-folders. When I put the DVD into any computer (I've tried my laptop and desktop, and my brothers' computers) it stops reading after a minute or so. I can still open up the 3 folders with the movies in them and even watch the movies, but the 4th folder just doesn't open at all. I can't open it, copy it from the DVD to my hard drive, nor even right click it to see the properties. I know the files were burned successfully because I checked the size of the space used on the DVD and it all adds up right. I assume the drive stops reading the DVD because there's just too many files to read/index. Is there anyway I can get around this? Is there anyway to force the drive to not stop reading? Or does anyone know any way I can retrieve those files? I really need them. Edit: Here is a screenshot.. http://vgcache.com/datas/images/3431-ruhroh.jpg
