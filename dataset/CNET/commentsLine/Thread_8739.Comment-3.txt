i would try to run your same configuration without the powerline adapter.
you could take a long cable and see it works.
you could also move your &quot;ap&quot; closer and use short cable and simulate only being able to see the &quot;ap&quot; by turning the radio off in the router.
as mentioned it could be firmware in the routers or the powerline.
i would load the latest versions on all.
a number of years ago i used a different brand of power extenders and it had a very low limit of mac addresses.
i tried to hook a switch at the far end it would just stop when i connected more than 3 machines.
you could test for this by using the wan port on the remote &quot;ap&quot; and enabling the dhcp for a different range that your main router is using.
i would recommend you only use this to test since running router behind a router tends to make file/printer sharing a challenge to configure.
