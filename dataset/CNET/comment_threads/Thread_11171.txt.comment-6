1.
I have removed the firewall 2.
I have not changes the WPA2/WPA to just WPA2 because one of my wireless cards doesnn't connect if it's just WPA2.
3.
I have moved a small obsturction out of the routers way.
I am now getting a bit better internet speed.
just as a comparison, if I am sitting next to the router the speed of the internet is above 20Mbps, but in a room upstairs (router is downstairs) I am now getting about 3.5 Mbps, so ideally I would like to get up to atleast 10 Mbps is the upstairs room.
