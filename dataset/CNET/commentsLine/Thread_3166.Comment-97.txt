i was a hardware technical specialist for 30 years.
1. electronic failures were more prevalent in the 1st year then in the following 10 years.
2. systems that were powered on 24/7 had less failures then ones that were powered off everyday; so don't power off your computer if you will be using it within an hour or 2.
3. the heads in disks actually fly over the surface of the platters closer then the particle of cigarette smoke(i think maybe about 10 microns).
every time the drive stops the heads touch down on the platter surface with a potential for a head crash.
a former post had the stats for 50,000 average start/stops before failure.
4. after you backup your data, no matter what media you use, read the backup.
one of my customers did not do this and when he needed his backup copy could not read it!
