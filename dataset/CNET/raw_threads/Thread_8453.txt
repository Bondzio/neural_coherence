I was thinking of putting my computer, CRT monitor, Internet modem, and router on the UPS. In addition, maybe I'd have it set so that the computer shuts down five minutes after the battery power kicks in, just in case it wasn't a 1 second power out. If the powerout lasts longer, then the computer and monitor go off, and I have my modem and router plugged in. From there, I could use a laptop to connect to the wireless. So, besides the five minutes the computer & monitor are on, what do you think I should do to get something that will last the modem and router about twenty minutes? 9watts (nominal) Motorola SB4200 29watts Netgear WGR614 (I read this somewhere from Google) 500 watt aspire power supply for my computer ??? watt CRT monitor
