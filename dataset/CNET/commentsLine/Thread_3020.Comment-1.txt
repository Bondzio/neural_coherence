i have a wired home network between 2 desktops using netgear router.
replaced the client desktop with new.
now i continue to get this &quot;unplugged&quot; message and have done absolutely everything i can think of to make this work.
i have no internet on new computer while the host computer is fine.
yes, i have checked the connections and everything is hooked up properly.
the connection wizard does not help.
