Thanks for the suggestions and comments.
Since I have nothing to lose, I will try the Australian solution.
I am challenged by the prospect to resurrect it.
&lt;div&gt; I could not believe my eyes that the problem first surfaced in 2006 and Netgear never fixed its Firmware Upgrade after the bricking of their routers.
What amazes me is that 2011 Tech Support (somewhere in Asia, probably the Philippines by the names of their staff) could not identify the issue on the first email ( no voice or chat support since I was out of warranty).
Any suggestions on a reliable new Router brand or model?
I already own a few Apple (Mushroom, Time Capsule and Express) and a still working Netgear as well.
Thanks &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
