the usual method to boot from somewhere other than the os on the hard drive is to put a restoration cd into the drive and hit esc during startup.
i just replaced my internal cd drive with an external, dismanteled the internal and renamed the external &quot;d&quot;.
now the esc procedure does not work.
why?
i am running windows xp and fantom makes the drive.
my computer is the gateway solo 1450 laptop.
i have all six windows setup floppies.
when it asks for the os cd the process stops.
