correctly.
the multiplier for the xp's are fixed [can't be changed without surgery].
thus you can only acheive 2.083 ghz when the fsb is set properly.
many mobos have circuitry that drops the fsb back to a safe speed if you have a bad shutdown or it detects a problem.
the mobo mfrs/bios varies on whether you set the fsb to the single speed or the double speed.
example 133 mhz or 266 mhz [an aspect of double data rate memory] the memory is clocked at 133 but it is read on both the leading and falling edge and thus reads at double the rate [266].
same for 166 and 333. as already stated the amd xp 2800 + actual clock speed is 2.083 ghz.
if it supports 166/333 mhz memory the multiplier would be probably be listed as 12.5.
