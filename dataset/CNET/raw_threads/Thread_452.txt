I have a SanDisk Cruzer 1 GB flash drive which works erratically. Sometimes blinding fast; sometimes snail pace--on the same computer. Why the variability?

Later on problem came back. I bought an inexpensive &quot;Self Powered 4 Port USB 2.0 HUB&quot; Important that it be certified as able to operate USB HIGH SPEED devices. Some PC internal USB ports lack sufficient power to properly operate USB HIGH SPEED devices. Second problem I was finally able to spot -- connecting external USB Hub to each internal USB port (one at a time) and copy data to Flash Drive - use stop watch on each port using identical data. Only on 1 internal USB port I got a message from Windows XP that &quot;this port is not USB high speed capable&quot;. So when I stopped using this 1 internal USB port problem was finally totally gone. If still a problem - another solution is to use Windows XP to ZIP (compress) Folder - the data you wish to copy onto the Flash Drive. I found this also greatly helps. Hope this helps readers. Remember problem with slow data writing on Flash Drives can also be a conflict with CDRW / DVDRW burner software or with anti virus software. For other ideas try reading the Flash Drive Manufacturer website. Good luck.
