the machine recognizes the HD Control Panel under the Search devices .. but when I go the computer to look for the device it is not there.
Unable to back up my files.
In the task bar it has the icon to safely remove the hardware.
I use that before removing the HD.
I also checked the drivers and the it indicates that drivers are up to date.
Thank you for your help.
