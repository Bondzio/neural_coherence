Hello everyone I just got a new computer (I am not a computer pro btw) and It has a AGP Slot.
The problem is I am not to sure to know which one I have.
The computer user manual don't tell, neither it says so on the mother board or in the computer periphical section.
I checked a few sites about AGP cards but they made me confuses even more.
My card is Brown and has a key in the middle near the front of the computer.
I found a site that might be usefull: http://www.abcd.com.au/v/agp_slot.htm It looks like the Green one model, but it's brown.
I supose color doesn't mean anything but I just want to be sure before buying any cards.
Let me know please.
Thank you!
