Sales seem to be nowhere and blogs and makers try and try again.
Seems like a niche product since no one reports they can play video on such things.
Maybe with USB 3.0 that will finally let you watch a movie but if you have seem the average notebook tank on performance my bet is that folk will again go back to HDMI.
Besides, without HDCP, your average BluRay title will not play on this.
