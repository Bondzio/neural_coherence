First, SD has been updated several times in the last two months; maybe YOUR version is old.
Second, I just saw something about the partitions on external drives to the effect that they may need a firmware update; see http://www.finetunedmac.com/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=5120#Post5120 Anyway, I am glad you resolved the issue!
