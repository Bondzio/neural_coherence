<s> I have a hauppage win pvr usb2 and i updated the drivers and one everything but it keeps on having problems and now the computer won't even recognize it it says it a unknown device. </s>
<s> Something is wrong. </s>
<s> Should i get a Usb 2.0 hub and connect it to that because the computer is usb 1.1 </s>
<s> Since the machine is USB 1.1, the hub will work at USB 1.1 speeds. </s>
<s> Given the machine's details I can't comment further. </s>

<s> &quot;Intel(R) 82801FB/FBM USB2 Enhanced Host Controller&quot; That great news. </s>
<s> What I would do now is install Intel's latest chipset drivers. </s>
<s> Since you posted enough details I'll supply the link to the proper package. </s>
