hello, yes, there is a reason id like 10.4 and 10.5 on my machine because the mac zbrush runs on 10.5 and my maya runs on 10.4 i have just purchased a lavie external hard drive and mac osx 10.5.4 and im going to give it a try hopfully i can figure out how to upload the 10.5 to the external drive without messing up the internal drive.
i have an imac 10.4. oh you mentioned that i cannot have 10.4 and 10.5 running at the same time.
how would i transfer files then?
sincerely michael
