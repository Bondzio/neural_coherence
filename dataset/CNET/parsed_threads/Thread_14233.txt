<s> I have a pentuim 2.53 and i also have 2/512mb of 2100 ddr ram. </s>
<s> My question is.. would 512mb of 3200 dddr ram be that much faster then 2100. </s>
<s> Would 1 stick of 3200 beat 2 sticks of 2100 or would spending the extra money for 2 sticks of 512 3200 make that much of a differnce? </s>
<s> Your memory speed will not increase with faster RAM. </s>
<s> That's set by the CPU and mainboard, not by the RAM. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> so you are saying that ram does not increase your pc speed? </s>
<s> and waht is a mainboard? </s>
<s> is that a motherboard </s>
<s> yes mainboard/motherboard </s>
<s> my motherboard can handle higher ram! </s>
<s> If i put the ram in it still wont make it faster. </s>
<s> The memory may be faster, but the machine in total will not see a speed increase in over 99% of the cases cited. </s>
<s> You'll have wasted your money. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> i understan now thanks for the help and saving me money so waht would be a good way to increase my computer speed. </s>
<s> Your machine, as configured, should be plenty fast. </s>
<s> Some things you can't speed up with Processor, or ram. </s>
<s> Like e-mail, and web surfing in general. </s>
<s> Or printing. </s>
<s> Is there something in particular that seems slow? </s>
<s> Simple things like running less apps at the same time. </s>
<s> A full hard disk is much slower than one that is 1/2 full for instance. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hmmm....If your computer/motherboard was designed for DDR2100 then the later designed computers for 2700 or still later designed computers for 3200 would make no difference on your 2100 designed MB. </s>
<s> Course you can up your RAM beyond 512MB but your computer if designed for 2100 would show no improvement using 2700 or 3200. </s>
<s> Crucial.com will tell you what type and max RAM for your particular computer. </s>
<s> Personally, I have not heard of any speed increase in gaming for RAM over 512MB, except for bragging about having XXX RAM. </s>
<s> Higher RAM for video editing and other intense graphics work may be necessary and advisable. </s>
<s> You can decide, if your ram is capable of sending back and forth 1100 more megabytes per second to the chipset on your motherboard is it going to be faster? </s>
