Find the right cable, the right connector on your TV, the right connector on your card and the right settings on both devices.
That's all.
Without manuals and CD's it's somewhat more difficult than if you should have them.
The basic rule: try using the same connector on both ends (be it analog, HDMI, Scart, DVI or composite video).
Sorry to be of no more help.
If you can't find out, take your PC and the manual of your TV with you to the shop and ask them for the right cable.
That might be a good start.
Then explore the settings of your video card.
