<s> My drive will only read and write a few 250 Zip disk and refuses to read others. </s>
<s> It just freezes up and the light stays on as though it is operating. </s>
<s> Those it will not recongize it will not format either. </s>
<s> Lets say that I have 7 zip disks. </s>
<s> Four will be read and writable. </s>
<s> Three have files and Folders on them but are not at least readable. </s>
<s> Nor can I format them. </s>
<s> This does not make any difference whether they are 250 or 100 size disks. </s>
<s> I also have a paralel 250 drive that stopped reading 250 zips and will only read the 100's. </s>
<s> Anyone have any suggestions. </s>
<s> I am mainly interested in the USB drive. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> But they only use them for those that are willing to move to CDRW media and surrender the old disks. </s>
<s> It's a strange thing but the IT gestapo has to kill it off somehow. </s>

<s> ZIP drives aren't that good once they get into old age. </s>
<s> If you have used older zip disks and found them to be failing, they've reached the end of the line. </s>
<s> Further, a bad ZIP disk can effect other good disks as the wear&tear on the drive itself could be at at fault -OR- become faulty due to bad disks. </s>
<s> Once, you experience a bad disk, save whatever data and try to another one, swap data. </s>
<s> Overall, I don't recommend ZIp drives unless you got to have them. </s>
<s> They have fallen out of favor with users due to this. </s>

<s> Thank you Bob and Willy. </s>
<s> My Zip drives are now going to the junk pile. </s>
<s> Only thing that I don't like is, the files on the disks, I can not retrieve unless i send them to Iomega and for a price they will get the files off. </s>
<s> This i don't intend to do, as they got enough of my money. </s>
<s> Also they are of no help with the problem. </s>
<s> Thanks for your replies, larry </s>
