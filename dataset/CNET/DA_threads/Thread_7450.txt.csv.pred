1.1.1	Well , after 7 years my Dell Dimension 4300 HD finally up and died on me .	St
1.1.2	Even though this computer was old and slow , it was perfect for some functions I needed to conduct .	St
1.1.3	I have several laptops for serious processing power .	St
1.1.4	I want to resurrect this box and I was wondering what I could buy to replace the dead HD .	St
1.1.5	It was a 40G IDE drive .	St
1.1.6	Any suggestions are appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	While I could safely write any 120GB drive of the old IDE interface will do , small details such as the version of the BIOS , the exact version of your XP CD ( ? )	Ques
1.2.2	will be needed if you want to go past 120GB .	St
1.3.1	but do n't know for how much longer .	St
1.3.2	I would n't try to go larger though .	St
1.3.3	Seagate and WD 's should be fine and run under 40 bucks web priced .	St
1.4.1	For what I use this computer for increasing HD to 80G is fine , it doubles the size of the original HD .	St
1.4.2	I figure I will spend some $ $ $ to attempt to get some of the data transferred .	St
1.4.3	Do you have a recommendation on manufacturer , model , etc ?	Ques
1.5.1	Here in the US I paid 60 bucks for a refurb 750GB SATA hard disk .	St
1.5.2	Surely you can find an 80 for not much more at newegg.com or geeks.com As to paying for transfer of the data , why would I do that when I have a cable like http : //www.geeks.com/details.asp ? invtid=2020 & cat=HDD and free cloning software like G4U ?	Ques
1.5.3	Sorry but this is an area I feel you DIY or pay up .	St
1.5.4	Bob	St
1.6.1	I am located in the US as well , so finding a drive I think is a rather easy feat .	St
1.6.2	The question had more to do with I did not know what I could replace the drive with and was looking for recommendations ( size , type , manufacturer , etc . )	St
1.6.3	Can I replace an IDE drive with a SATA ?	Ques
1.6.4	As for transferring the data , if the original drive worked , then I would have no problem in transferring data myself .	St
1.6.5	So , I figure if the data is recoverable , then I will happily pay to have the data recovered and transferred .	St
1.6.6	Thank you to everyone who has replied thus far .	St
1.6.7	It has been very helpful .	St
1.7.1	Find a drive that fits your need ( or case , etc . )	St
1.7.2	Look at the user feedback .	St
1.7.3	For the most part the ones that write & quot ; I could n't make it work & quot ; are the ones to avoid .	St
1.7.4	- & gt ; In closing , currently the hard disk makers are just like getting gas from Texaco , BP or Hess .	St
1.7.5	Maybe there is someone that can write a convincing treatise on why one is preferred over the other .	St
1.7.6	Bob	St
