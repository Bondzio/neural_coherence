I recently bought a PS3, and it has the option to search for a media server.
It doesn't find media on my network attach computer hard drive.
Is it looking for a networked hard drive like the HP Media Vault MV2120 or D-Link DNS-323 2-Bay Network Storage Enclosure with media on it?
Do I have to get a &quot;media server computer&quot;?
Can I use my computer and run some program to make it recognizable as a media server to the PS3?
Can someone help?
