Hello I have Intel's D845HV mother board and P4 2GHz CPU.
I know its old!
but I need the best graphic card that works with that board.
I currently have nVidia GeForce 4 4800 Ti which is damaged somehow so I need to change it.
I want best graphic card which suites this board.
thank you Info about my board can be found here: http://support.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/d845hv/
