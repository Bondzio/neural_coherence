When I bought it, it came formatted as Fat32. I reformatted it to NTFS. I want to be able to hook this up to a Mac so that I can copy the Mac's music collection onto the drive and then, take the music from the external drive, and put it on my PC. When I tried this, the Mac would not allow me to copy and paste files onto the drive, but recognized it as Read Only. What do I need to do to be able to get the files from a Mac, onto the External, and then onto a PC. Will reformatting to Fat32 do it (if so, how do I do this), or is there an easier way? Please help!
