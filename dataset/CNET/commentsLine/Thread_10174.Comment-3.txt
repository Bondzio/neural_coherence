our computer help has more readers.
my thought is the old stop and start the print spooler issue or fix.
i make no apologies for microsoft leaving this unfixed and decline to dive into a dissertation about it.
so the short answer is that its still buggy.
you can improve it sometimes with the latest service pack and hp's drivers but even then, i'll have to open the command line up and stop the spooler, delete a few files and restart it.
in closing you may not know this so let me add the video driver is used to render some content.
this means we want the video driver to be current too.
good luck, bob
