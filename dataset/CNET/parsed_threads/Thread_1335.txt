<s> I was looking to put a Hauppauge WinTV-HVR-2250 into the PC but I don't know if it will work. </s>
<s> I have Comcast cable and though one box is a DVR the other is not. </s>
<s> While researching I've come across the fast that Comcast may or may not broadcast in clear Qam. </s>

<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> More about : turning htpc </s>
