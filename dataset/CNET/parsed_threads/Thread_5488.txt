<s> Hello, I have an asus g73jh-bst7 and i recently repasted the gpu, and now the screen is fine until the mouse goes within about 5 pixels of the left border of the screen, while the cursor is close to the left edge a horizontal tear line appears across the screen at the same vertical position as the mouse, external monitors dont give the error, I've reconnected the monitor cable about 5 times now to no avail, anyone got any tips... p.s. </s>
<s> its not under warranty </s>
<s> You didn't reveal why you were inside the laptop but it's usually the cable to/from the LCD, the LCD or the motherboard. </s>
<s> The external working is a good clue but is not enough to tell us when part to replace. </s>
<s> When in doubt, replace the cheapest part first. </s>
