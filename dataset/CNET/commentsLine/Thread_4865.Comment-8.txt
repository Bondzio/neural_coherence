thank you so very much for the help .
we seem to be thinking along the same wavelength .
i was thinking that trying the drive in my friends machine will answer that q too .
i am not sure of his psu size , but, with his rig set-up i know he has to have no less than 450 , raid 4 , big nvidia sli cards , so on so forth .
thankx again
