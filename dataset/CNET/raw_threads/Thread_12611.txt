One is an Emachines while the other is an HP. If I get the E-machines, I will upgrade the video card from a Radeon X200 to a 9600. I am having doubts because some of my classmates say I am better off building one than work with an Emachines. But I did my homework and found out they are really good computers. I was wondering I should even bother upgrading it or give it a shot and see what I come up with.

I guarantee that if I knew then what I know now, I'd definitely build one. When I bought the Emachines I knew nothing about PC tech. It got me started, though. You could build a nice little PC for about the same cost as buying a fully assembled PC and still have a better and more powerful system. My advice would be to build one. Rely on this forum for help. This is one of the best, if not the best, forums on the World Wide Web. If you do build a PC, make certain you stick to basics and buy the least expensive parts you can. Once you get past this, you'll be building screaming demons.

At least see what the eMachine is putting out before getting into a upgrade mode. Just get a feel for it, if an upgrade is needed then by all means upgrade. tada -----Willy

If you want to get better quality, build your own ... if you have lots of self-control. I thought I'd build my own, then started planning the system out. It only costs a few dollars more to get this better motherboard, and the better case, and the better video card, and the better ... get the idea? All those just a few dollars more add up ... and fast. Before I knew it, I was spending double what the eMachines cost me. Sure it was a better system ... had what I wanted in it, and would have cost even more to buy it completed if I could find one like it. If money was no question, I'd have built my own ... money was tight, I bought eMachines and am upgrading at my pace .. well ... as money allows. As for the video card, you'd want PCI-e over AGP anyway ... twice the data bus, over twice the speed.

Here's some things to think about: Standard (built) computers have at least a 300 W power supply. These (emachines and HP) have about 200 or LESS in general. Put a high end video card in there and the power supply may pop like a fire cracker. These manufactures usually use the cheapest, sorriest, most proprietary junk they can find. They also load the hard drives up with so much junk that you have about 1% of system memory usable after loading all the garbage. Example... My Fiance has a Dell with 2.5 GHz Intel, 1GB ram, Gforce video card. I built mine with an Athlon 3200 (1.8GHz), 1GB ram, ATI Radeon 9600. Well....My computer runs about 30% faster than hers. The first thing to learn about computers is the &quot;store bought ones&quot; are absolute garbage. I'm not sure where you did your homework that told you that the emachines are good. Maybe they're good compared to HP or other store bought or Dell machines. However, that would be like comparing a pinto with a duster. Comparing store bought with one you build is like comparing a pinto with a ferrari Testarosa.

Emachines are very upgradeable and hardly has any spyware or adware when out of th ebox. As for hP/compaq, definitely opposite. Sonys are okay. Gateways are good. DELLs, nope, i wouldn't buy if possible. BTW oems use pretty good parts that are off-the-shelf, but usually modified in that certain features are disabled. ROger

4291	8	131683	1488283	1487534	yorba	10/21/05 7:29 AM	1.12987974E12	Look Again	The eMachines T6524 came with a 300W power supply. Of course, that is still not enough to run the new high end video cards. I had to upgrade the psu for the ATI Radeon X800XL I added to my system. Proprietary? Not any longer. The MB is an OEM version made by MSI, granted a low end version, but used by at least eMachines, HP, and Compaq (yeah, same as HP, I know) in their systems. But it is still a 939 Socket MB and includes a PCI-e slot, 4 RAM slots, an open drive bay, 3 open pci slots ... very upgradable, a good starting point. As for junk on the hard drive ... nothing Add/Remove Programs couldn't resolve.
