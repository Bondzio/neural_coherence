1.1.1	i have a macbook pro ( the first generation ) with 2.16ghz core duo and 1gig of ram ( hopefully upgrading that soon ) .	St
1.1.2	i was hoping to be able to install vista on an external harddrive and somehow run it with bootcamp without installing it directly onto my laptop 's on-board harddrive .	St
1.1.3	any suggestions as to how to go about doing this ?	Ques
1.2.1	So far , no version of Windows runs off external drives .	St
1.2.2	I have not read of a successful external drive install of Vista yet so you would be the first .	St
1.2.3	Let me be clear that said externals are connected with USB or Firewire but not SATA .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	does that & quot ; no version of Windows runs off external drives & quot ; apply to all machines or just the Boot Camp mac ?	Ques
1.3.2	P	St
1.4.1	1 .	St
1.4.2	Windows versions from Microsoft .	St
1.4.3	Not going to comment on hack jobs .	St
1.4.4	2 .	St
1.4.5	USB , Firewire drives .	St
1.4.6	With that short constraint list , no version of Windows installs and runs on external USB , Firewire drives .	St
1.4.7	Yes there is BART , but that 's a hack , does n't run everything and is a hack .	St
1.4.8	Bob	St
1.5.1	and a little surprising .	St
1.5.2	I have been booting off external drives , SCSI & Firewire ( no usb ) since my first Mac .	St
1.5.3	I thought that the Primary drive only , boot thing had moved along .	St
1.5.4	P	St
1.6.1	I thought that if I installed OSX on an external drive , then booted off of that drive to install BootCamp on it I could get around the internal drive requirement , but it did not work .	St
1.6.2	Maybe they 'll finally let you do that with 10.5 .	St
