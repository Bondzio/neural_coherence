<s> Hi, I've been using the original iPad since it came out, and lately it's really started to slow down, and it's gotten to the point where it's nearly impossible to watch videos on it. </s>
<s> From what I've read, if certain specific fixes don't work, (I've tried them and they didn't help) then it's most likely just a matter of the hardware getting out of date. </s>
<s> So now I'm looking to upgrade. </s>
<s> I want something that can stream HD video (mainly Youtube and Netflix) smoothly and browse the web well. </s>
<s> (A good e-book app is a plus but isn't necessary.) </s>
<s> I don't really play a lot of games on it so that isn't so much of a concern. </s>
<s> Could someone point me in the right direction of what kind of specs I should be looking for and/or any suggestions on devices that work well for this? </s>
<s> It's been the best of the lot. </s>
<s> At the office we have a few tablets such as the Transformer, Google Nexus 7 and a few too many others but this one is the best streamer of the lot. </s>
<s> It's so good that I have it connected to the HDTV via HDMI almost all the time. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
