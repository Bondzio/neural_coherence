i have a windows xp with 150 gb of hard disk space and 1 gb of ram.
the printer worked fine on a dell demension 2400 that was 6 yrs old.
the demension 3000 is five years old.
the message reads that it is setting up for intial settup but it never finishes the setup.
any other information needed to give advice?
