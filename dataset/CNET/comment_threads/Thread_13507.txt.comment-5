What motherboards are good but cost effective?
I would like to build a decent dual processor system below $1500 is at all possible.
Also I thought AMD had some processors that could be used as dual processors if the motherboard supported it?
Will the multi core be faster than dual processor systems nowdays even though they sound the same?
I'm really not all that dumb when it comes to putting a computer together I just am not good at putting this processor with that motherboard.
If I can just get those 2 picked out I think I can take it from there.
I would have bought a system but I can't find many places online that sell dual processor desktops.
Thanks!
