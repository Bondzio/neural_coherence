Thank you for replying the post.
The C drive is 183G in total, while there is another 6G reserved for recovery task.
My major concern is that once if I try to make new partition, I might accidentally format the entire C drive and lose everything, including the operating system.
Please advise where can I get the partition resizer as mentioned?
Thank you again.
