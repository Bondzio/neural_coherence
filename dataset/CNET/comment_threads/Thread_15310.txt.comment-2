&quot; Simple question.
Will a P3 handle a 160 Gig harddrive?&quot; Yes.
P3's can do that, but the BIOS must have been updated.
But a BIOS is not a P3.
A &quot;P3&quot; is just the CPU of the machine and this CPU is not limited in this respect.
There is an end run around a BIOS with a limited support and that is to put the drive in an USB 2.0 enclosure and use a compatible OS.
Also, the OS is an issue... Bob
