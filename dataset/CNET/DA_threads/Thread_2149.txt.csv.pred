1.4.1	If this is an old psu , just get a new psu .	St
1.4.2	Damage may already have been done to the psu beyond what a fan can correct though properly cooled .	St
1.4.3	If new system , check warranty .	St
1.4.4	If you replace be aware of your abilites , some fans are a drop-in , just unplag and swap .	St
1.4.5	Others you & quot ; unsolder & quot ; and replace/swap .	St
1.4.6	Further , be sure you get the right fan type , in voltage/vanes ( blades ) and cfm rating , etc..	St
1.4.7	This is the time to get a higher wattage replacement psu as the system can better from it , especially is a decent one ( brand name ) .	St
