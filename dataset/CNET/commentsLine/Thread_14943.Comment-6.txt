cnet is a little slow on reviewing tabs unless its an i something or samsung.
dont know what donald bell has been up too lately this is suposed to be his thing.
i have been watching this product.
if your looking and trust posted reviews.
check out the bestbuy.com site.
seems people like this.
i also like it but i just wish it had more internal memory.
plus is the gps, wifi takes a sim and con is no flash support.
something else if your just looking for an entertainment tab creative ziio 7 (waiting for an review on this one too)
