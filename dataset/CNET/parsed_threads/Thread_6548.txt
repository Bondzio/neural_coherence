<s> While organizing the case wiring as my last step in completing a clean installation of XP pro on an A7N8X-E WD Raptor SATA RAID 1 array computer, I unknowingly rebooted the machine with the hardrive(s) power connectors disconnected. </s>
<s> Now upon restarting, the post continues until I get the System Disk Failure &quot;hit any key to continue&quot; message,then at this point the restart won't continue. </s>
<s> Do you know of any possible way restore from this point and save the installation? </s>
<s> Thank You in advance from Mr. Putz </s>
<s> I have not had this happen but have had system freezes during an installation requiring a manual reset. </s>
<s> I would try booting from the XP CD and doing a reinstallation using the &quot;Repair&quot; option. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
