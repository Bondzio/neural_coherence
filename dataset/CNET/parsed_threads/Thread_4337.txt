<s> Hey, I'm planning a Christmas Upgrade for my computer this year, in preparation for Windows Vista in February. </s>
<s> So far I've had a processor reccommended to me - the Intel Pentium D 945 - would you agree that's pretty &quot;high end&quot;, or am I setting my standards too low? </s>
<s> Also, I've pretty much extended my current (old!) </s>
<s> motherboard as far as it can go - so I need a new one to use that processor. </s>
<s> I have 3 questions about that ... 1. </s>
<s> Do most motherboards come with RAM, or will I need to order some? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Will it be possible to plug my existing RAM sticks in (2x 512MB DDR PC2700 sticks) into a new motherboard, or do I need to stick it on eBay and start fresh? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> How much RAM do you reccommend to get the best out of that processor? </s>
<s> Will 1GB be enough? </s>
<s> Also, if anybody can reccommend a decent and cheap motherboard I'd really appreciate it. </s>
<s> Apologies for the long post, but I don't know who else to ask! </s>
<s> Many thanks. </s>
<s> Since you wrote that you have PC2700 RAM, I'm guessing that your current motherboard is a socket 478 Intel board. </s>
<s> Too old for today's CPU's. </s>
<s> You need to start anew. </s>
<s> Try to get a ''Core 2 Duo'' CPU. </s>
<s> New: motherboard CPU DDR2 memory PSU Likely needed new: case hard disk DVD burner sound card 1. no, most don't come with RAM 2. no, a desirable new motherboard will take DDR2 memory. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> 1GB is a good place to start with Vista Motherboard and other hardware recommendations come when you tell us how you want to use your comouter. </s>
<s> You'll also need a new PCI Express X16 (not PCI or AGP) video card if the motherboard doesn't have integeated video. </s>
<s> I have an MSI mobo at the moment - Last time I got my computer upgraded I ended up with an AMD processor. </s>
<s> Thanks for the advice regarding which RAM I should be looking for, that will be helpful. </s>
<s> The reason I chose a Pentium D is because I'm on a fairly tight budget, and I've heard that not many programs use the full power of a ''Core 2 Duo'' processor yet. </s>
<s> I'm planning to get a new case anyway, so that's not a problem - but why would I need a new DVD burner, hard disk and sound card? </s>
<s> I think mine should be fine with most new motherboards, but I may be wrong. </s>
<s> Finally - the PC is used for all sorts of things, so it's hard to say. </s>
<s> Sometimes it's a home desktop, sometimes I use it for designing, sometimes it's used for playing some pretty hardware-intensive games (Such as The Sims 2). </s>
<s> Thanks for your response. </s>
<s> Gaming is usually the most hardware intensive activity for the general use computer, and today it requires a decent CPU, at least 1GB RAM, and a mid-level to high-end video card. </s>
<s> Of course, all this depends on your budget. </s>
<s> I was just guessing about the DVD burner, sound card, hard disk, and other components because of the type of RAM you stated (older RAM type means older components). </s>
<s> If you have good components, then by all means add them to your new machine. </s>
<s> If you tell us what you want to keep (kbd, mouse, monitor speakers, HD, DVD burner, sound card, etc.) </s>
<s> and then give us a budget for the rest of your machine, then we can suggest some builds. </s>
<s> All I wanted was a CPU, a case and a motherboard, but it's becoming clear that's not realistic - so let's make that a CPU, motherboard, a decent amount of RAM, a case and (only if I NEED one) a more recent GPU. </s>
<s> Here's some of the stuff I've got at the moment - bear with me, though, because I didn't install it and don't know much about it. </s>
<s> - Two HDs - A fairly recent DVD burner - A Creative Soundblaster Audigy 2 ZS sound card - An nVIDIA 6800 LE GPU (AGP, not PCI) - Obvious stuff such as mouse and keyboard (not USB) Ideally, my budget is only 300 ... that's not a lot, I know. </s>
<s> I hope my PSU and fan (both fairly new) can be put in a new case, otherwise I might as well not bother with this upgrade! </s>
<s> My Dad's paying, but I suppose he could be swayed slightly as I'm giving him my old RAM and Processor to speed up his machine - we both had the same but I decided I needed more speed about a year ago. </s>
<s> Call it a part exchange, I suppose! </s>
<s> Again, 'scuse the long post. </s>
<s> Many thanks. </s>
<s> Alright, here's what I just got last week: - ASUS P5B Socket T (LGA 775) Intel P965 Express ATX Intel Motherboard - SAPPHIRE 100106L Radeon X850XT 256MB GDDR3 PCI Express x16 Video Card - Intel Core 2 Duo E6400 Conroe 2.13GHz LGA 775 Processor Model BX80557E6400 - Patriot 2GB (2 x 1GB) 240-Pin DDR2 SDRAM DDR2 667 (PC2 5300) Dual Channel Kit Desktop Memory Model PDC22G5300LLK And I spent $691.89 on all this from Newegg.com. </s>
<s> I suspect these prices will drop as the Core 2 Duo's become more popular, and AMD comes out with their new Quad-Core processors around Christmas time. </s>
<s> If you go to anandtech.com, they will show you the trends of hardware prices and have very good reviews on hardware (it's where I did all my research for my Mobo). </s>
<s> Newegg is typically the best place to get them, but there are other great deals out there. </s>
<s> Also, tomshardware.com is a good place to compare CPU speed using benchmarks that are most useful to you (For example, AMD X2 +4400 processors are faster than the e6400 at some things like gaming, but not multitasking and dvd burning, which is what i wanted). </s>
<s> My new setup runs like a dream, and on a scale of 1-10, my computer would now probably be about a 7. </s>
<s> I used my existing Case, CD drives, Floppy, and Power Supply. </s>
<s> I ended up needing to get a new power supply for $70, because mine was 400w and the minimum requirements for my new hardware was 400w, so I upgraded to 600w because the power was acting funky. </s>
<s> I suspect if you wanted to go lower in RAM (2GB is the most you'll ever need, so 1GB would probably suffice), and also go for the Core 2 6300 which is almost just as good as the 6400 but for 50 bucks cheaper, and they also make decent PCI-e graphics cards for only $70, this would all save you about $150 from what I paid, not to mention the drop in prices that should occur in 3 months. </s>
<s> I would suggest keeping your old case, HDD, and dvd burner, as they will be compatible even if you have IDE drives. </s>
<s> You can upgrade to SATA later, as they perform much better. </s>
<s> So I spent about $750 getting all this stuff, which is 397GBP, but I did manage to sell my old mobo, processor, RAM, and extra PCI cards on eBay for $300, so it came to around $450 for my upgrade. </s>
<s> The new board more likely to have agp8X slot and I have learned it is not backward compatible. </s>
<s> So the old video board might not be compatible. </s>
<s> I've worked out a way to stretch my budget a lot, and I've found a load of stuff that I think should work together. </s>
<s> How does this sound, and will it all work? </s>
<s> Intel Core 2 Duo E6300: http://www.aria.co.uk/ProductInfoComm.asp?ID=23931 1GB RAM: http://www.crucial.com/uk/store/partspecs.asp?imodule=CT12864AA53E nVIDIA GeForce 7950 GT: http://www.aria.co.uk/ProductInfoComm.asp?ID=24557 Foxconn motherboard: http://www.aria.co.uk/ProductInfoComm.asp?ID=24021 Antec NSK 3300 case: http://www.xcase.co.uk/acatalog/Antec_NSK_3300.html Note that I picked 1GB RAM so that I can always add more later if I need it - but with that processor I'm sure I won't! </s>
<s> (Does anybody know if I'll end up with all the cables I need? </s>
<s> Will I be able to use ones from my existing system? </s>
<s> Obviously that's important!) </s>
<s> Thanks for your speedy replies. </s>
<s> Video card slots: Best &gt; PCI Express X16 &gt; AGP8X &gt; PCI &gt; worst New boards should have PCI Express X16 and not AGP4X/8X. </s>
<s> Motherboard is incompatible with your CPU and video card. </s>
<s> 300W PSU won't support your video card (too low). </s>
<s> Motherboard should come with all the cables you need. </s>
<s> &quot;Motherboard is incompatible with your CPU and video card.&quot; Good reply, but can I ask why? </s>
<s> What do I need to be looking for that's different from the one I chose? </s>
<s> I picked one from the &quot;Socket 775 (Intel)&quot; section on the Aria site, to match my processor, and presumed that was enough. </s>
<s> Some other chipset will also work but 965 should be a sure thing. </s>
<s> What's the benefit of having the same chipset - will it cause problems if I don't, or is it just a case of the processor being ''guaranteed'' to fit? </s>
<s> The reason I ask is that having a 965 chipset board adds almost 60 to the price (on Aria, at least). </s>
<s> http://www.aria.co.uk/ProductInfoComm.asp?ID=24272 ^ That's the one I've got my eye on at the moment, it's got PCIe x16, DDR2 RAM and it mentions the Core 2 Duo. </s>
<s> It's also got 4 USB ports, which is something I was hoping for - my current 2 means a lot of mucking about. </s>
<s> Will that one be alright? </s>
<s> It's an Intel 945G chipset one - presuming the numbers go in order, that's pretty close? </s>
<s> Right? </s>
<s> Just because a motherboard has a particular CPU socket, it doesn't necessarily mean that all CPU's of that socket type will work. </s>
<s> The motherboard BIOS also needs to support the particlular CPU type. </s>
<s> The link you posted states that the motherboard is compatible with &quot;Intel Pentium D, Pentium 4, Celeron D processors, Socket T (LGA775).&quot; Hmmm...I seen no &quot;Core 2 Duo&quot; in that list. </s>
<s> Now, you may go to the motherboard maker's website to discover if there is a BIOS update for compatibility with C2D processors; however, there may never be such an update for that particular board. </s>
<s> Bottom line: Make sure the motherboard specifically states that it is compatible with your CPU family. </s>
<s> Note that some motherboards are compatible with C2D, but not C2D Extreme CPU's. </s>
<s> That's the one I almost got, but it had problems I didn't like. </s>
<s> Look at the layout, the PCI-e card is way close to the large Power supply cable you'll be running, and that heatsink may also get in the way. </s>
<s> For some reason, manufacturers are being complete retards with their motherboard layout, so make sure you take that into consideration. </s>
<s> Otherwise, that board will work and it's a good bang for your buck. </s>
<s> Listen to that Linksis guy and me, we know what we're talking about. </s>
<s> Ignore that other guy, he has no idea what he's talking about. </s>
<s> All Socket 775 boards require PCI-e, AGP sucks. </s>
<s> But yea, also be careful because not all Socket 775 boards support Core 2 Duo Processors </s>
<s> Thanks very much for your help so far... </s>
<s> I think I've almost got it! </s>
<s> If you could confirm this will all work, that'd be excellent... Intel Core 2 Duo E6300: http://www.aria.co.uk/ProductInfoComm.asp?ID=23931 1GB RAM: http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=290019936431 nVIDIA GeForce 7950 GT: http://www.aria.co.uk/ProductInfoComm.asp?ID=24557 Asrock motherboard: http://www.aria.co.uk/ProductInfoComm.asp?ID=24272 I'm also thinking of this case, just because it's the cheapest: http://www.aria.co.uk/ProductInfoComm.asp?ID=23750 Will that be alright, and can you reccomend a PSU from aria.co.uk? </s>
<s> The nVIDIA FAQs say I need at least 400W, but that doesn't help much - I never know exactly what I'm after. </s>
<s> Get one that's 600w. </s>
<s> Also, I hope you do realize you're getting Micro-ATX stuff. </s>
<s> It will all work with each other, I'm just pointing that out so that you know you may need a micro-ATX power supply also. </s>
<s> That's one hell of a video card you got here, too. </s>
<s> And if you're only getting 1GB of RAM, it might be cheaper to get 2 DIMMs (2x512MB Dual Channel). </s>
<s> I do realise I'm getting microATX stuff... the motherboard being cheaper is the main reason. </s>
<s> Also, I often cart my PC accross the country when I'm visiting my Dad - so I expect that might make it slightly easier. </s>
<s> Why would I need 600w, Isn't that a bit OTT? </s>
<s> Obviously you know more than me - I'm just making sure I don't waste money if it's more than I need. </s>
<s> Re: the graphics card, that could end up being different depending on my budget. </s>
<s> The idea of this upgrade is to not need another one anytime soon, but I think I might end up going for an older model in the GeForce 7 series. </s>
<s> It all depends on how much I have to spend on the case and the PSU - do I need a microATX one for the case I just posted? </s>
<s> Check this article for info on selecting a gaming video card: http://www.tomshardware.com/2006/09/26/the_best_gaming_video_cards_for_the_money/ Compare for yourself: http://www23.tomshardware.com/graphics.html Make sure the +12V rail on the PSU has the number of amps (A) that the video card requires. </s>
<s> One 7950GT model I saw on NewEgg.com states that it needs 28A on the +12V rail. </s>
<s> This is in addition to the high maximum Wattage rating. </s>
<s> It is better to have more Wattage than to skimp. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
