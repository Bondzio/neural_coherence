Actually not just good i want it Really good. I decided to upgrade it. I bought a new graphics card and a new processor. The graphics card was &quot;Geforce 6200 Vram 512&quot; , I wanted 6 series . It was cheap so i took it. The processor was &quot;Intel P4 2.8ghz HT tech&quot;. I'm wondering if this was a good choice. 1st i bought the graphics and tried it. Games were good but sometimes slow because of my old Processor &quot;Celeron D 1.8ghz&quot;. I didn't try the new proccesor yet cuz the store guy told me he should change the motherboard too. He had to format so he told me to come Tomorrow &quot;which is today&quot;. It's 11:18 am here and i'll pick my PC at 7:00pm . I'm excited about the new processor. But i'm wondering is these upgrade good? specially too bad i didn't search alot b4 buying and that's a big mistake. thank u

With graphics cards and computer parts in general, you get what you pay for. In gaming, your performance will improve more if you just get a better graphics card rather than a new processor. Where did you buy your graphics card, and what did you pay for it?

It's a famous St. where there're alot of computer stores. I paid 27 k.d for it. About 81 US Dollars. But i heard Intel Celeron D is not good for gaming. So i thought changing the processor may boost gaming. Speciely HT tech. i though it might help. thank u

Read the minimum specs for the game, and double them to play comfortably. Remember Tetris, Jezzball and Pacman? Work perfectly on my 8 years old 200 Mhz-48 Mb-S3 machine. But World of Warcraft goes much better on 1 Gb than on 512 Mb. Hope this helps. Kees

I have a game &quot;Act of War&quot; . I have the recomended specs but the proccesor . Recommended = p4 2.8 and mine celeron D 1.8. Even on low i suffer for fps drops. The thing that confuses me is in &quot;Battlefield 2&quot; . When i play single player battle the game is slow on Low although i have the recomended &quot;but processor :p&quot;. The game runs smooth and great on High on multiplayer if there're few players or only me. So i think the proccesor in the problem i face in gaming which should be changed
