I am using Trendnet wireless router TEW-631BRP and Trendnet pc card TEW-621PC on a brand new laptop running Windows XP.
I turned on WPA2-PSK and am running ZoneAlarm security suite.
After reading the forum posts I have checked for firmware upgrades and driver upgrades.
The problem I am having is the connection holds for a few minutes and then drops completely.
It forces me to find the network and sign in again with a password- only to be dropped 5 minutes later again.
If anyone can help would be appreciated!
