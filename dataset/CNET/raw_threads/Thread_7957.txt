The internet access is through the P4. Messenger will sign on using the P4 but will not sign on using the P2. I can access all other MSN pages. Also, on the P2, eBay will let me sign on but will not allow me to d/l the items for sale just the categories. Can anyone help? Thanx Woody

But worth noting is that many put in firewalls and can't configure them. I can't offer ANY support for a firewall since Zonelabs has their own support. Your setup is unclear, the firewall effect seems to be indicated and I wonder what changed since it worked. Bob

The high speed modem connects to my P4 via USB. The P4 connects to the hub via ethernet as does the P2. I used XP pro to set up the home network. I can access messenger on the P4, no problem, but when I sign in on the P2 it just sits there. I have tried to connect on the P2 after turning off the XP firewall (on the P4) but that doesn't work either. The hub doesn't have a firewall. Yahoo messenger works fine on the P2 & P4.

ICS may or may not work in it's default setup, but to use MSN messenger networks, you can try using GAIM instead from http://gaim.sourceforge.net/ http://www.cyberwalker.net/columns/mar04/msn-messenger-audio.html gives us clues that MSN Messenger is not going to work all over.
