i had a look at the manual for your board, and it is a zif socket.
this design is intended to make the bios &quot;switcheable&quot; whether you decide to make a go of this yourself is entirely up to you.
if you feel you have the expertise to do it, then i say try, but be careful, the pins on a bios chip are delicate.
make for absolutely sure you're grounded.
esd build up can turn your new chip into a really expensive little ornament.
i can only assume as was stated in a previous reply, that you opted to replace the chip as a less expensive alternative to replacing the board?
