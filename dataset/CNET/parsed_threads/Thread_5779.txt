<s> I was attempting to help my friend with his computer problems... he has a dell desktop, not sure what model, but I don't believe that is relevant in this case. </s>
<s> He wasn't sure when it happened, but he thought it might have been when he uninstalled DVD43. </s>
<s> Under My Computer, both his CDRW (sony crx216e) and DVDRW (pioneer dvr-110d) drives were missing. </s>
<s> After going into Device Manager, it showed both drives, but they both had yellow exclamation points next to it. </s>
<s> First step was to uninstall the drives, and reboot windows. </s>
<s> Same problem. </s>
<s> The drives showed up under Device Manager with the yellow exclamation point. </s>
<s> Second, I attempted to update the drivers (found at each respective company's website). </s>
<s> When installing the drivers, an error came up for both of them saying &quot;available target not found.&quot; After that, I tried to Rollback the drivers, but it said something along the lines that there was no previous driver installed. </s>
<s> I considered using system restore, but he isn't sure when the problem started happening, and I don't want to restore it too far back because I'm not sure if that will harm anything else he's done since the problem occurred. </s>
<s> Also, in another form someone mentioned that a system restore did not help them. </s>
<s> I attempted to look into the BIOS, but Dell's bios is nothing like mine, and barely has any options. </s>
<s> I've searched through multiple forums, but to no avail. </s>
<s> One mentioned going into the registry and editing a few things, then uninstalling the drives and rebooting, but I am a bit nervous editing the registry on a computer that is not mine. </s>
<s> Noted and linked at http://forum.aumha.org/viewtopic.php?p=128113&sid=ca56a6d141f6f7b8e75b458ae13785c1 </s>
<s> I looked over that forum, but I don't see where that relates to my problem. </s>
<s> That forum seems to be about drives that are recognized, but do not recognize a CD-RW. </s>
<s> Maybe I am missing something, could you specify which post on that forum describes a solution to my problem? </s>
<s> http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314060 dont worry about too much about editing the registry,as long as you follow the instructions right it will be fine , besides you can back it up before changing/deleting , it may make some installed burnning software to malfunction if it have an upper/lower filter driver but thats all , nothing beyond , if that will happen its very easy to uninstall and reinstall that specific software. </s>
<s> That looks exactly like what I've read in the other forums... </s>
<s> I was hoping there would be a fix without a regedit, but I'll just back up his registry before I do anything. </s>
<s> I'll give it a shot and repost the results later tonight. </s>
<s> Don't want to use regedit. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thank you all for the fast help... </s>
<s> I followed Stephen471's advice and everything is back in order. </s>
