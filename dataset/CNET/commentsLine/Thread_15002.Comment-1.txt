i'm planning to add a dvd-rom to my new computer (it currently has a dvd/cd rw drive with light scribe).
i've found numerous models (much cheaper than i ever could have imagined $17 to $25) but have no idea what i'm looking for or what names mean quality.
some of the brands i've found are: benq, toshiba, lite-on, lg, samsung, sony, asus.
can anyone recommend one of those brands over another?
do the dvd-rom access times, cd-rom access times, and cache times mean a lot?
for dvd-rom access times the one i like has 80-220ms but others have as low as a constant 90ms.
for cd-rom access times the one i like as 165ms but others have as low as 95ms for cache the one i like has 512k but other have as much as 2m.
thanks for your help.
