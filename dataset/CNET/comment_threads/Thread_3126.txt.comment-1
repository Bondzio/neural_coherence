Hi, I'm a student, and I am in need of a new comp for christmas.
I am considering a fast computer (Core 2 duo) that can run many apps.
I was looking at the 20 inch imac and the slim xps desktop for dell.
I am not sure what desktop to get.
Do you guys have any suggestions of a desktop that is perfect for fast performance?
I also want to play a little games.
I don't want to waste my money and crappy computer so what is a good one?
core 2 duo at least 1 gb ram 250 above gb hard drive GOOD graphics card THANKS
