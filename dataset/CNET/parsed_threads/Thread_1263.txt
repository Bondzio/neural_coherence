<s> I am using a LG-4082B, and am burning some videos to DVD with Nero Express 3. </s>
<s> I have been experiencing problems, and I am not sure what it is. </s>
<s> I have copied some DVD's of mine with no problems, and burned some data discs with no problems. </s>
<s> It seems that the problem only occurs when making DVD Movie's. </s>
<s> Nero works fine until the very end. </s>
<s> It burns about 4.4GB out of the 4.6 and then has an error and stops. </s>
<s> I saved the Nero Logs from two seperate burns and they are different, although they have the same characteristics: burns about 4.4GB then stops and a error message comes up. </s>
<s> In one of the logs, it says: [17:12:16] NeroVision ???? </s>
<s> 05:12:08 </s>
<s> I have read something about Nero having problems with the AC3 Audio format, how do I find out if my file is using that format? </s>
<s> And if it is, how to I recode it? </s>
<s> I am sure AC3 audio format is not the problem now. </s>
<s> Turns out the audio was in mp3 format. </s>
<s> I tried to burn the same thing on my BenQ 1620, worked perfectly. </s>
<s> So I dunno what the problem could be... </s>
<s> I only use these medias. </s>
<s> Ritek Taiyo Yuden Pro Disc Verbatim I dont want my burner going south because of cheap media. </s>
<s> Easy guide, http://www.dvdshrink.info/nero-video.php </s>
<s> Reports are too numerous about this issue. </s>
<s> I can almost assure you that the issue is not you. </s>
<s> My only fix? </s>
<s> Use something else. </s>

<s> I use prodisc, so I don't think its the media... Anyways, I'm just gonna stick with my BenQ for burning movies now. </s>
