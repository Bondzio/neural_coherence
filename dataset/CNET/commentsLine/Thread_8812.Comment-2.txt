also, if no one has any suggestions as to what could be done about the drive/bios, what about a suggestion as to how big a windows install/system partition should be.
i haven't been able to find any recommendations online as to how big a system partition should be.
from what i can tell, windows and the my document's type folders are taking up about 10gb on my current drive, how much more than that might be needed?
maybe ill just install windows fresh on the new drive, with my xp pro install disk only recognizing 136gb, then try and figure out the issue of my motherboard/48-bit addressing at a later time.
any thoughts?
?
