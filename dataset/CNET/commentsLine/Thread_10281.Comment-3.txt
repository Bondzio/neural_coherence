i have four drives and 8 partitions between them, one of which i partitioned about 9gb for c: and i used my d: drive to install all programs.
another disk is partitioned for mp3s, another for photos and another partitioned for downloads only.
i named another drive/partition &quot;resources&quot; and i keep copies of xp pro (the entire cd) and xp office and other data/files from other computers, etc.
it is always a good idea to not use the entire c:\ for the operating system and your programs because if it crashes then you are risking losing all your programs and data, etc.. if you partition enough room for the root drive (c:) and install programs, etc., on other drives/partitions, you will not lose as much.
