<s> Hello to everyone.Ihave a few questions and i need some answers.Ihave 5 years old computer Intel pentium 4 with mobo ASUS P4P800-X,RAM 1GB{2X512},HDD 160GB NVIDIA G-FORCE 6600.I was made 2 partitions .the first working XP I will never change,Isuppose and the second partition was windows 7.My question is does it worth to keep it with some more memory or a new video card or to buy a new one desktop with 300-400 euros?Iam a daily user i was using for videos, photos, music and a litle games. </s>
<s> If this was my dilemma, I'd get a newer machine but keep the old one until I could fully transition to the new rig. </s>
<s> You might even find a use for the old one later. </s>
<s> They can become decent file servers or test boxes. </s>
<s> The fact that it can run win7 is a good sign that the system has some more life in it, but it has limited or will reach its end soon enough for a 5yr. </s>
<s> old system. </s>
<s> If possible add more ram, but that's about it. </s>
<s> A new system, plainly said, will have the latest goodies and continue to work as time marches on, so be happy with what you got until you decide to buy new. </s>
<s> That decision is more to what you feel you need for now, but while you mentioned it, you are really using the old system in a heavy way. </s>
<s> IMHO. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Your computer is five years old, indicating its inner parts may be starting to wear out. </s>
<s> If it runs good however, I would just keep it. </s>
<s> The only thing that I may do is add more RAM and either another internal hard drive or get a good external hard drive. </s>
<s> 1GB RAM isn't a whole lot but for five years it is very good. </s>
<s> My 5 year old computer has I believe something like 512 or 715 MB of RAM. </s>
<s> And 160 GB HD is pretty good as well. </s>
<s> You may want to get a new desktop just because the hardware would be much more efficient and effective; i.e. </s>
<s> a faster RPM hard drive or a more energy efficient processor. </s>
<s> And speaking of processor, a new system would be sure to have a higher GHz processor. </s>
<s> Overall, its really your choice. </s>
<s> If you don't have any issues with your current system and it isn't too cluttered up or anything like that and has no viruses, I would keep it. </s>
<s> If it is cluttered, slow, and has some issues with it, I would replace it. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Why not both? </s>
<s> Upping the old one to 2 GB of ram would be the only thing I would do with it. </s>
<s> It would extend the life of it for a few more years until XP is no longer supported. </s>
<s> As for a new system you can either build one, and it sounds like you could (if you don't already), or buy a pre-built system. </s>
<s> Now I don't know currency exchange rates very well, but I've put together an inexpensive system for around $500 US. </s>

<s> My oldest system I keep for old games and other old programs. </s>
<s> My XP system has become a media server, and my newest Vista system is the one I use all the time for everything. </s>
<s> Another plus to a new system is that it should run cooler and use less energy. </s>
<s> Hi Kostas, I work in a place where we fix computers so I hear this question quite a bit. </s>
<s> The answer isn't always that simple. </s>
<s> It would be helpful for you to answer these questions: 1. </s>
<s> Is my current computer doing what I want it to do for me? </s>
<s> If not, is it possible to upgrade it to meet my needs. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> If I upgrade the computer, will the new parts I buy be usable in a new computer at sometime in the future? </s>
<s> For example, if you add RAM to your old machine, will it work in a newer machine later? </s>
<s> The same logic goes for Video Cards and even CPU Upgrades. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> If my current computer is usable, will I gain an advantage by putting a bigger, and newer hard drive in it. </s>
<s> I say this for two reasons. </s>
<s> First, if you're still using your original hard drive, you should replace it as it's nearing the end of it's life cycle. </s>
<s> With a new hard drive you can still salvage the data from the old one, and since your system is capable of running Windows 7, it's likely to be much faster with a new and larger hard drive. </s>
<s> With these questions in mind, you should also thoroughly inspect your existing computer to make sure all of the capacitors are still in good shape (not swelling or bursting). </s>
<s> Also, if your old machine is capable of running DDR2 Ram, you'll probably be able to upgrade the memory for a very reasonable price. </s>
<s> If you're using the computer for videos, find out what sort of video card (if any) your current system is using. </s>
<s> If your board accepts a PCI Express card you're in good shape, but if it takes an AGP type card, upgrading would be a waste of money. </s>
<s> Finally, find out what kind of CPU you're using. </s>
<s> You mentioned it's a Pentium 4, but how fast is it. </s>
<s> There are a lot of good deals to be found out there for faster Pentium 4 CPUs up to 3.2GHz. </s>
<s> Don't pay for any upgrade less than 3GHz on the CPU. </s>
<s> Most desktops of this type use a socket 768 type processor. </s>
<s> You might find that after the cost of upgrading the CPU, RAM, and Video card, you're better off buying a new desktop but there are good deals out there to be had if you shop for them. </s>
<s> Also you should remember that if you buy a new unit, you'll be getting an new optical drive, at least a dual core processor, in most cases a much larger hard drive, and a probably upgrade to a DVD Burner that your old unit doesn't have. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
