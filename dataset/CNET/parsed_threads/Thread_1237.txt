<s> When I try to print a photo I get a: Insufficent memory to complete operation. </s>
<s> Dell laptop 1100 256 memory Help What does this mean I need to do. </s>
<s> It said that on a Lexmark and now on a Brother printer Thanks </s>
<s> It sounds like you don't have enough system resources to complete the print. </s>
<s> When you choose print, the document is sent to either the printer's or the computer's memory for printing. </s>
<s> Sometimes not enough memory exists for a document to be printed, especially if it is a large file or has pictures included. </s>
<s> First, I'd suggest closing any programs that don't have to be running (ctrl+alt+del), and disabling them from start-up (start-&gt;run-&gt;msconfig). </s>
<s> Just make sure what you are closing before you close it, as some of the processies are required for your computer to run properly. </s>
<s> You may have to restart for everything to take effect, or to clear out any current errors/glitches. </s>
<s> If this doesn't help, try going start-&gt;&quot;printers and Faxes,&quot; right-click the printer you are using, and selct &quot;properties.&quot; Under the 'advanced&quot; tab, try alternating between &quot;spool&quot; and &quot;print directly.&quot; Another option, although you may not have such, is after you press &quot;crtl+p&quot;, go &quot;properties,&quot; &quot;basics (tab),&quot; &quot;advanced features,&quot; and check &quot;low memory mode.&quot; Finally, you may want to try reinstalling the printer software/drivers, as they may have become corrupt, especially if this happens when you try to print one-line documents. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, John </s>
