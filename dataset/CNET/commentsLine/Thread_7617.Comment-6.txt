oh, i agree disabling the ssid isn't really a security measure since it is so easy to obtain anyways.
disabling it will potentially cause more problems than it solves.
i don't care who knows my ssid because it is a random generated vaule, so it won't be in a pre-computed hash table [actually, i use wpa2 with an 802.1x authentication server, so i'm not vulnerable to the dictionary attack anyways.
just so you know donna, i do not hide under my bed ] .
unless i mis-read her post, it appeared that donna was advocating open wireless networks, and this i do differ with, for the stated reasons, and others.
