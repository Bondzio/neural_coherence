the low 3dmark06 is due to the graphics card.
your sony can't be upgraded to a core2duo, but it can probably accept a dual-core upgrade.
here are my suggestions: 1) call sony/visit tech support and see if your motherboard supports the pentium-d. if so, a pentium-d 945 is $170 (2 3.4ghz processors vs 1 3.6ghz) and would you give a boost in day-to-day activities.
you can ebay the 560j for about $80.
(if sony tech support is hard to contact, you can download cpu-z from  if your mainboard chipset is i945 or i975 it *should* support a pentium-d.) 2) consider getting a 7900gs (about $180) or 7950gt (about $240) based video card.
you may have to upgrade your power supply for another $50.
3) consider adding another 512mb to 1gb of ram if you have 2 free slots ($60-$120 or so).
for about $400 you'd have a pc that won't be very far behind today's curve and should keep you happy till next christmas at least.
