<s> Ive been looking all and find a bunch of graphics cards but none of them tell me what they require for a power supply. </s>
<s> I am running a 300w power supply with windows xp. </s>
<s> I have a pci-e 16x slot. </s>
<s> I don't want to spend a bunch, just need something to up the performance of my on board graphics. </s>
<s> This is not for gaming but for photo shop and other programs like that. </s>
<s> any help would be great. </s>
<s> unless you're using the gpu acceleration features of the latest version of photoshop or playing 3d games like bioshock, crysis, call of duty, quaker wars, etc., a new video card won't speed up your pc much. </s>
