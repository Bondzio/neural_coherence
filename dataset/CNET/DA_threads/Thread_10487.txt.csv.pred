1.1.1	Hey guys any help would be awesome.	St
1.1.2	My Maxtor Basics 500GB external HDD powers up (Solid power light comes on) and makes a breif &quot;whirr&quot; but fails to start spinning properly.	St
1.1.3	Drive doesn't show up in My Computer.	St
1.1.4	The &quot;whirr&quot; continues to start and stop but nothing further happens.	St
1.1.5	Could this be an enclosure problem or is my drive screwed?	St
1.1.6	It hasn't been dropped or anything and i've only had it about 2 months.	St
1.1.7	Any idea what options i have?	St
1.1.8	It will be under warranty but is Maxtor likely to repair and save my data or just replace?	St
1.1.9	Any help much appreciated!	St

1.2.1	They take in your old and hand you another unit.	St
1.2.2	If you want your files (which begs the question about where the backup copies are) try reading this forum where people put the hard disk into a new enclosure and better than half the time (yes I know, not 100 percent) the drive comes back to life.	St
1.2.3	If you want them to save your data, they charge for that.	St
1.2.4	I prefer http://www.drivesavers.com over most.	St
