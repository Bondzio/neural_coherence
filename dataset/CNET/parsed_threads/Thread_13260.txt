<s> Hi, I bought a splitter to split (obviously) the only ethernet port from my modem to two different computer, but for some reason I can't. </s>
<s> When I try to connect two different computers to the splitter, both of them keep struggling to stay connected. </s>
<s> The messages than appear are: Limited but not connectivity The cable is unplugged The normal message than appear once there's a successful connection established I believe than both of them are using the same IP Address What can I do? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance </s>
<s> You cannot use a splitter for either cable or Ethernet. </s>
<s> Each device needs its own port. </s>
<s> Get a router. </s>
<s> I almost forgot to check for replies. </s>
<s> Thanks, I'll buy one. </s>
