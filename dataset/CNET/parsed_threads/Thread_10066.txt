<s> You mean you lost the CD case for the expansion pack? </s>
<s> That's where the code is. </s>
<s> Each one is different. </s>
<s> If you really lost it, you will have to uninstall your game and buy a new version of Hot Date so you have a new password. </s>
<s> Weather you bought the cd on line or in the store, i'm sure their web page help will gladly help you out. </s>
<s> I've bought things on line and lost or misplaced my code or password. </s>
<s> If they have your name on file they will give you a code or new password...buying on line helps you because they send you an e-mail, usually with your user name and password, so any time you have to re-install they will send you to a site to re-install....good luck </s>
<s> The reason is in the Forum Polices... Bob </s>
