i agree completely with the above post.
it all depends on how you use your computer.
for most basic uses, web surfing, word documents, etc, then either ddr2 or ddr3 will be fine.
if you are a heavy pc user (gamer, graphics, calculations, ripping, etc) then spend a little more for the faster memory chips.
i also agree that processor choice, and video cards are also major factors in the makeup of your system.
point being, makes no difference how fast the memory is if the processor is bogged down.
so there really is no way to tell you what is best for you without knowing all the particulars, and how you plan to use the pc.
