Browse the network for the PC that hosts the printer.
Click on it and see if the printer shows.
It should if the sharing was set up properly.
Do a right click and select &quot;Connect&quot;.
I remember years ago older NT systems had an &quot;Install&quot; option from this point but not sure if this works the same.
The ideal way is to use a print server but this costs a bit and not all printers and print servers work happily together.
