I have made some recent changes: Motherboard: http://tinyurl.com/3ecfs9h Optical Drive: http://tinyurl.com/3bq8qow USB 3.0 Card: http://tinyurl.com/3mt397p I want the desktop to be able to handle 1080P movies (blu-ray or not).
Should I still go for a cheaper mother board with built in graphics?
Also, is the stock heat sink enough?
The case comes with 2 fans but I was thinking of adding another.
What do you think?
