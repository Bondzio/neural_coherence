He actually had to order the 200GB hard drive for me and he got it in the next day.
The claim about the 30GB, 60GB, and 160GB, etc HD's I got from 2 different people, not just the guy who is fixing my pc.
He's been in this business for a while so I dont think he'd lie... Never know I guess.
As far as getting a better hard drive for $99, I dont have the time or energy to go online and buy crap, besides I dont trust buying stuff from the Internet and having it sent to me, especially fragile things as computer parts.
So I think I got a good deal in a timely manner.
Any other good thoughts or questions?
Thanks for your help!
