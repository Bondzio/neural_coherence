hello.
my pc is shutting itself down without provocation.
i can't attribute it to any particular use or software.
it just happens sometimes.
sometimes, but not all the time, on restart a screen appears that says that there is a cpu temperature error and to press f1 to continue.
i've vacuumed the vents and ensured that there is adequate ventilation but this keeps happening.
is the fan assembly what needs to be replaced?
how can i figure this out?
any suggestions greatly appreciated.
stuart
