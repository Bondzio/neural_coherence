I did not disconnect it to anything else in the computer, just unscrewed it from the back so i could slide it over and see the sticker on the side. I put it all back but now the power button on the outside of the case you normally use to turn the computer on is not working. The only way i can turn on the computer right now is by opening it up, and pressing the power button on my motherboard. Everything else works perfectly. 1) So why is the outside power button not working? 2) what should i do to fix this? Any help would be thoroughly appreciated -WooDy

You'll need to trace the wiring but it should have a 2 connector plug and the wires are often red and black. You'll want to make sure you didn't dislodge it when you moved the PS. I've not seen the front panel harness dressed around PS harnesses but it could happen and moving the PS could be enough to unplug the connector.

Trace the wiring up to the power button? or are you saying trace it to power supply or motherboard? I tried tracing up to the button on the inside but i have no idea how to get in there. I didn't see any screws that open that section up. win7/64-17 870 custom in an altec 1200 case

You need to remove the side covers first. I've built PCs using Antec cases and they usually have some barbed projection that passes through the frame. You need to get to where you can see them clearly. There will be two or three on each side and you need to push them to one side to release them. From there you can get to the innards of the front panel connections and one of these will be the momentary switch that powers on the PC. Note the color of the two wires and trace that through the front of the frame to the motherboard. There should be an array of pins somewhere on the motherboard that these connections go to and it's usually two rows of about 8 pins. If you find a disconnect at the motherboard, you've probably found your problem. If you're not comfortable with doing this, you probably need to seek help. If you take it to a shop, be prepared to pay a hefty bench fee just to look at it. I don't know the rates these days but they are probably upward of 80 bucks just to plunk it on the counter.
