Have ECS k7s5a board, DIMM, DVD, CD Burner.
First PC would start intermitently, then it stopped turning on.
I only have power to HD and floppy.
PC appeared to post,saw monitor scroll for a few seconds then go blank.
HD ran for a few minutes then system shutdown and will not start.
I have connected monitor to another pc and it is ok.
Using Antec power supply tester PS seems to be ok; PS is 250w which may be low but system has been running for a couple years without a problem.
What else should I check?
