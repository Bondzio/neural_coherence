1.2.1	I had the same problem you do ; I purchased a NEC DVD burner and could play CDs , but not DVDs , even though I had installed the basic Nero software that came with the drive .	St
1.2.2	I contacted NEC and was told that the DVD Codec I needed was available from ( intervideo ) WinDVD or other such sources .	St
1.2.3	I installedd the 30 day trial version and the player worked as it should .	St
1.2.4	I immediately purchased the full version once I was confidant that my issue was resolved .	St
1.2.5	You can go to Intervideo 's site and download the trial version to see if that helps .	St
