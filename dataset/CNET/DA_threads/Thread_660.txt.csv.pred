1.1.1	I am wondering if anybody has heard anything about what I am trying to do here , or if you think it would even be possible .	St
1.1.2	My cell phone ( Nokia 6010 ) has the normal handsfree jack ( 1/8 & quot ; slot ) , and I was thinking that since a handsfree accessory has the normal send and receive plugs that it might be possible to splice that into a RJ11 jack so I could use the cell phone for data via my modem .	St
1.1.3	I have unlimited minutes , but the data transfer costs money .	St
1.1.4	If I could use my cell phone just like I would a normal home phone line with a RJ11 input then I would in essance be cheating the system .	St
1.1.5	All the phone company would see would me be on a voice call .	St
1.1.6	From there I could either try and have the computer dail an ISP ( probably not possible ) or manually dial the phone and then connect that way .	St
1.1.7	Is this even possible ?	Ques
1.1.8	Or am I going to blow up my phone in the process ?	Ques
1.1.9	Thanks for your help and advice , Brandon	Polite
1.2.1	Brandon : Did you ever get an answer to this question .	St
1.2.2	I have searched high and low for the same capability , but all the cell phone makers and specialty stores give you a blank look .	St
1.2.3	Surely , you and I are not the only geniuses on the planet ? !	Ques
1.2.4	Even with a blue-tooth enabled phone ( mine a Motorola V551 ) and blue-tooth pcoket-PC , I still need to go through an external modem to connect to an ISP .	St
1.2.5	I would be interested in an update ( dropbox999 at hotmail dot com ) thanks .	St

1.3.1	I am not quite sure how it works , but a friend of mine found an adaptor that plugs into the 1/8 inch port on your phone .	St
1.3.2	The idea was to be able to use your home phone in conjunction with your cell phone so that you do not have wasted minutes at the end of the month .	St
1.3.3	However , his idea was to use the device in his car , with a power inverter so basically , he hooked up a home phone set in his car .	St
1.3.4	I saw this and wondered the same thing your ... since all a computer does is listen to the beeps and such , this should work on a computer as well .	St
1.3.5	I have yet to find the hardware , but am still looking .	St
