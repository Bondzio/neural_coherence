Hello I am having the same problem with my Mp3 player - it is a small USB Hitachi &quot;Ebay&quot; purchase.
It worked fine for 6 months and I can copy files from it to the PC but nothing from the PC to it.
I recently installed iTunes for my wife and wondered if this had anything to do with it?
Any help out there appreciated
