Immediately after, system failed to boot because only 4MB RAM was recognized on POST. Repeated tries showed 16 or 24, but never enought to boot Win 98SE. If I remove one DIMM, system boots normally. In fact either DIMM in either slot works normally, but not both together. I took out one of the DIMMs and successfully flashed back to A02. Now boots normally. Reinstall second DIMM and have SAME PROBLEM! I guess it's not the BIOS after all. If I put either DIMM in either socket, machine works normally; if I put in both, neither A02 nor A05 BIOS will recognize more than 24 MB of RAM. Problem began immediately after the first BIOS flash. I'm starting to think about some kind of secondary chip or mobo damage. The diagnostic lights show all 4 green. Any ideas?

It's entirely possible the failed connection is a Chip-Select or &quot;other&quot; that will only make a difference when both are present. My background includes embedded controls with... various types of these sticks of memory. I'd make the visual inspection if it was my machine. My collection of tools include some small dental surgical tools that have brought back such boards. But if I didn't look at the sockets then I would have never repaired them. Bob

I'll presume that something on the order of 10x magnification would show something I may recognize as abnormal. I'll further presume that I may end up using the machine w/ 256MB RAM, but will advise if I make any progress...thanks again. Ron

Anyway, I have the *identical* system with the *identical* problem. 128mb, 256mb - all work individually in either slot, but *NOT* together. What gives??? (also have A05 BIOS) Ran

I started testing out different BIOS's, and when I flashed to the A00 BIOS, voila! Both 255mb sticks worked, and Memtest86 gave *no* errors!!! HAH! Now, I've got to see whether I can begin flashing &quot;upwards&quot; and determine at what point I lose the ability to use both modules!!! Pretty weird! Ran
