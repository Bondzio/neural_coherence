<s> do you think that the antek 1200 cpu case is the most suitaqble one for my msi eclpse motherboard loaded with 3 video card, 5 hard disk, 2 blu ray, psu included. </s>
<s> any good suggestion. </s>
<s> or better cpu case, much larger than antek 1200 is more likely appreciated. </s>
<s> it should be big enough to hold everything. </s>
<s> I think the only issue might be some longer cable may be need (you will get that solution when you get to that point). </s>
<s> I like Antec stuffs..Good building. </s>
<s> not a CPU case, easier to assist if the terminology is correct. </s>
<s> Picking out a computer case for a new build (or as an addition) is strictly a personal choice; however, with new technology comes more problems in regards to heat management, and making sure there is ample room for the newer video cards, etc. </s>
<s> The Antec 1200 is a nice case (20.2 x 8.4 x 22.9 inches); the Corsair Obsidian 800D is only $40 more than the 1200 (24.0 x 9.0 x 24.0 inches), offering more room, better airflow, better cable management http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811139001 </s>
