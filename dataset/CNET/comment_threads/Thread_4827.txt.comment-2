&quot;(fastforward, rewind, etc.)
up audio- and video-recordings&quot; is not something I see as a feature in RealPlayer so I'll write that it's not possible with this selected player.
&quot;The computers involved are of diffent operating systems and models.&quot; All this means is that once you solve the player issue then you get to work on getting each one working proper.
Sounds like good work porting to Linux, MacOSX, Windows versions, and support of all the machines.
My background includes some CCTV programming and while I know what you are after, your specs push this product's price through the level that most will pay for.
With cross OS and platform support that could hit the 1 million dollar mark with some exorbitant fees for onsite support to sort out specific machine issues.
