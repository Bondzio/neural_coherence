hi, nope didnt make my own cables, using a belkin cat5 25metre cable (not crossover), the other 2 pcs are using crossover.
router said it doesnt matter which cables i use as it auto detects.
strange thing is today its fine, maybe a restart cured it?.
i'm hoping it will continue to be ok!, dont want to return this new cable, is there any way to test the cable properly to ensure the cable is ok?, right now i'm getting transfers like i used to.
will probably have a look at sisoft sandra but that probably only does benchmarks.
thanks again
