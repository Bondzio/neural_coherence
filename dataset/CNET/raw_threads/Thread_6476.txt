If I have music, pictures and say read a book how can I tell which size Ipad will I have to purchase. Also the data use on the monthly charge is different in size.

Some can't do that so they need more. Only you can know this. As to the data plan, you didn't give what sizes there are. It matters. One plan was 6 megabytes or such and that's barely enough for some tweets. Bob
