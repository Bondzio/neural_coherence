Does anyone have this printer because mine has just decided to only allow me to print 1 page at a time. This is since I printed something on card (not successfully) and since then, it just jams up after printed the first page when the printer is first turned on. If I turn it off and on again,it will print a first page but then gets jammed. It has an automatic paper sensor but for some reason that is not working. Is there a way of getting into these machines or do I have to assume that I just chuck it out and buy another

A side effect of not paying 500 plus dollars for a printer. With such low prices, the repair costs more than a new printer. Since it's broken, my advice is to not fret about breaking it but to DIVE IN and try to look at it. First step I do is to remove any staples, tape, torn strips of paper from the machine's internals and then a light vacuuming and close it up with a damp cloth to wipe down the rollers. Sometimes I find the item. A rare bird was some HP that had no real CPU in the printer and all commands were done from the host computer. Including paper feeding. A flaw in the host could cause multiple sheets to be fed, but I doubt this in today's machines. You can try removing and reinstalling the drivers for a last fun thing to try. Bob
