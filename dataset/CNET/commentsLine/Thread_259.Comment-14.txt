you've told a partial story but haven't taken the time to condense it down to &quot;when i do this, that happens.&quot; instead we read about a golf trip which while interesting it begs the question.
how does this gold trip affect the cd/dvd drives.
but that story was barely enough for me to tell you this.
try this!!!
-&gt;&gt;&gt;  if you don't try this and don't tell a better story then i'm going to take it that you are looking for tech support and not self support.
here the forums are people helping people help themselves.
and for tech support you have to usually pay for that.
