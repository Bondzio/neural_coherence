I have a motherboard (ASUS P4PE-x) that supports PC3200, which gives the machine a faster front side bus (fsb). I originally began with a single PC2700 - 512 RAM. I bought two 256 RAM sticks of PC3200, and removed the PC2700. My question now is, I have three slots for memory, can I run PC3200 w/PC2700?
