A few months ago a strange problem started occurring. Whenever I power-up the computer, within the first 5 minutes of it being on it will either freeze, automatically restart, or the screen will go black. Either way I have to totally restart the computer. This problem can occur once, a couple times a day, or it can be a couple days before it happens again. There are no viruses, and a brand new power supply. Any help would be appreciated.
