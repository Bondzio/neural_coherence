bob: thanks for your timely reply!i have the problem playing the dvd movie with my rca tv/dvd player,as well as my magnavox vhs/dvd, phillips vhs/dvd, and ge dvd player playing through tv.
again, it doesn't happen with every movie i burn.
sometimes the movie will play ok, but will exhibit the problem the next time i try to play it.
