160gb (decimal, the way we count) = 149gb (binary, the way computers count) this is because a decimal gigabyte is defined as 1,000,000,000 bytes, and a binary gigabyte (actually a gibibyte) is defined as 1,073,741,824 bytes.
more info than most want to know:  the bottom line is that you can expect a computer to calculate a difference of close to 7% less than the decimal size indicated on the hard disk retail packaging.
strange, but common.
