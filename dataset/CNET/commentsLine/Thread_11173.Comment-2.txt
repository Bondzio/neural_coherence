besides opening case, clean it out and blow out any dust build-up, etc.. further, make darn sure all *fans* are working 100%, not intermit.
makes ure the psu fan itself is running, if itsn't it won't be apparent and the psu becomes weak and cuases power problems, plus it may blow.
also, verify the cpu hsf(heatsink) is ok, not dangling at an &quot;angle&quot; or such, because it must be fully in contact with the cpu to disperse heat and do its job, in other words don't take anything for granted, check it.
finally, being 6yr.
old it could be on its last legs and showing that the psu just has degraded to a point to become, &quot;iffy&quot; and replacement is the real cure.
further, all componets together due to age taht any one componet is dragging down and being old system it won't take much.
however, you probably have a weak psu, rep;lace it.
