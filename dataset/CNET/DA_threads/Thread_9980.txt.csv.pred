1.1.1	I currently have Sony Vegas 7 video editing software but need a capture box to capture video from vhs .	St
1.1.2	I was considering a moviebox from Pinnacle and see two kinds I could try to bid for .	St
1.1.3	Is there a difference between the Deluxe version and the Plus version besides cosmetics ?	Ques
1.1.4	Does the newer model produce better quality ?	Ques
1.1.5	Or , would you recommend a different breakout box ?	Ques
1.2.1	I currently have a Pinnacle Moviebox and I must say I am not too happy with it .	St
1.2.2	I used it to import VHS video onto my computer , but I found that even with a good spec on my system the sound was n't matching up right .	St
1.2.3	Perhaps they have improved the Moviebox with the & quot ; Plus & quot ; version but I would suggest looking through some forums and reviews on it before you make the purchase .	St
1.2.4	Now I have since built a new system that is more than suitable for editing video but I may just dub vhs tapes using a DVD recorder , then import them into the computer from the DVDs .	St
1.2.5	That route may work better in terms of preserving the overall quality of the picture + the sound if you have a DVD player that records .	St
1.2.6	I 'm unfamiliar with other brands or alternative methods beyond that discussed here so far , but hopefully your set-up works out .	St
1.2.7	I suppose if you 're able to return the product after it 's been opened you can always just take it for a test run .	St
1.2.8	If you are set on the Moviebox though I heard the & quot ; Plus & quot ; is n't that much different technologically for transferring VHS video into digital than the regular version , but you 're probably better off with it anyway since we 're probably all suckers for & quot ; later models. & quot ;	St
1.3.1	Be patient , and shop around some more .	St
1.3.2	I bought a pinnacle moviebox , and it 's been nothing but a royal pain .	St
1.3.3	Even worse , there 's no tech support available - they do n't answer the phone , and email replies , when you get them , are just like automated searches of their FAQs .	St
1.3.4	For me , I ca n't even submitt a tech assistance request , because my & quot ; product & quot ; is n't listed on their drop down menu .	St
1.3.5	the software that came with it , Studio 9.4 seems to work well enough , mostly , except that it incorporates Quicktime , which has always given me problems in the past ( hangs and stop errors , etc ) There are several other similar products out there .	St
1.3.6	Do n't go with the pinnacle just because they 're the only ones on the shelf at Circuit City .	St
1.3.7	Check out other forums , like at camcorderinfo.com or consumerreports.com , and see what they have to say .	St
