with an unknown video display, windows won't know its capabilities and will use some default settings.
when you change these, they may not stick as windows will rediscover the same unknown display device each time it starts.
your first quest should be to identify the display device and find a proper driver.
if possible, you also look for a driver for the monitor.
once everyone gets to know each other, they work better together.
