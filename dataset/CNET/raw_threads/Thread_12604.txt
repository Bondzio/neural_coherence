My old hard drive, which I copied to the new drive using Copy Commander, was a 13gb with only a few hundred mb of space left. My problem is, the new drive is only being acknowledged as an almost full 13gb drive, My system is now slower than ever and acting exactly like it would with a very full hard drive. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!

I do not have Copy Commander and it sounds like Copy Commander just copied the partitions as they were. Try again? BOb
