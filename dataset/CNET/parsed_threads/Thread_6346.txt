<s> Hey folks just wanted to know if there are dedicated USB servers? </s>
<s> I'm not sure if that's what they are called but basically I am looking to hook up a couple of external hard drives to a wireless network. </s>
<s> I also plan on attaching a printer as well. </s>
<s> I have found dedicated printer servers, but haven't been able to find just a usb one. </s>
<s> I know of a couple wireless routers that have usb ports built in but that will be a last resort. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> I can share printer servers and (USB) drive servers but so far there are not many &quot;usb&quot; servers. </s>
<s> There are reasons why but why not get what you need? </s>

<s> Alright. </s>
<s> I guess it was all wishful thinking. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
