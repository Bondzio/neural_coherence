either a rimm, dimm or ddr 2 dimm in addition a video card is a seperate controller for processing 3d objects in real time your computer uses an onboard solution, compared to a stand alone solution (onboard means it's on the main board, stand alone is a seperate card such as a geforce fx 5900 ultra, which is a stand alone agp 8x card) you can add a video card, in the form of a pci card as for ram, you will just need whatever speed and type of ram stick that your mainboard supports in addition to that the written information of your processor is way out of whack (just figured i'd correct you to help you out) xeon is not a company, it's a seperate model from the same company that produces celeron that company would be intel and it's 2.7ghz, not mhz (if it were 2.7mhz it'd be amazingly slow (1985 apple computers operate at around 1-2mhz, modern desktops operate between 1.5 and 3.8ghz)) xeon is a professional grade server processor offereing from intel, while celeron is a consumer grade low-range to mid-range offering from intel and it depends on what your doing to whether a graphics card is key to performance in gaming yes, the graphics card is king but in most applications the processor and memory are the best upgrades (memory not just capacity, but also timings and speed, and as far as processor goes, the more powerful = the better) then down the line from there would be hard-drives, but that's a rather pointless thing to fret over
