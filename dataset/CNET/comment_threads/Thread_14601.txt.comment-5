Sure, pretty much any of the Biggies have a VGA hook up also DVI but that would require a DVI capable Vid card in your puter.
Just go with VGA and you should be fine.
A really good one is a Samsung and I would stick with LCD instead of Plasma for your purposes plus a bit less expensive.
Good luck and have fun!!
