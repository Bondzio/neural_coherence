If so how much would it cost to have that light bulb turned on all the time. Is the cost of this more or less than what it might be if something went wrong to reasons contributed with turning on and turning off the PC. I myself turn off my PC after a while. I think that things are more likely to go wrong if something is in constant use. i.e. a freind of mine had his fan/cooler breakdown on him and when this happened the motherboard got too hot and became partially non-functional and so he had to have his motherboard replaced. Surely if the fan was left to run for too long then this would get too hot and the motor or circuits would burn out, causing more damage in the long run ?

Providing you have adiquate coolage for the processor, it makes good sence. Leaving it on gives the computer a smoother path, where through turning it off every day, you leave the risk of causing errors. No matter how careful you are. Like a car engine, the processor needs time to warm up in order to work at its fullest. We already know that our computers only use a fraction of what they are capable of, but if the computer is turned off, then the processor cools, the computer is set back to sqaure one, and in time slows down in doing the simplest of tasks. To leave it on, is to prolong the life of the battery, and keep the working parts moving. Surely this makes sense to you all?
