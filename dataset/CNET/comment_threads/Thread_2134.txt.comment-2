Toni, its far easier to move on.
An item like a mouse just gets too many new geewiz changes its hard to keep up with.
I suggest you check local Goodwill or Sal.
Army as time permits and see if any are on the shelfs or local shops.
Further, try another new one from whatever source until then.
With there being so many versions of the mouse available a visit to the OfficeMax, etc.
is a good start too.
