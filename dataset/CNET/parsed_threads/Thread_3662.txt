<s> Hey ive had my Logitech mx518 for a bit and its never shown problems until now. </s>
<s> The problem ive been having is that it will randomly disconnect while im browsing and gaming and such. </s>
<s> I am pretty sure its disconnecting because my computer does the disconnect/reconnect &quot;ring&quot; when it freezes. </s>
<s> Incase this is important, right before it started happening i uninstalled the Logitech Setpoint program from my computer, but even after reinstalling this i still get the problem, Ive also tried using different usb ports to no luck. </s>
<s> If anyone has any idea what the fix is, how to test for it, or possibly even just finding out specifically what the problem is, i would appreciate it. </s>
<s> Thanks PS: Here are some of my comp specs Computer Brand: HP CPU Speed/Type: AMD Athlon 64 x2 2.6 ghz RAM: 2 GB DDR2 Video Card: Radeon ATI X1950 Pro Sound Card: OnBoard Mouse: Logitech MX518 </s>
<s> I think the mouse is probably defective. </s>
<s> I had an issue like that with my MX1000 as well. </s>
<s> However you are in luck! </s>
<s> Logitech has a wonderful warranty service. </s>
<s> Just give them a call at +1 702-269-3457 and they will be glad to replace it for you. </s>
<s> They will probably even upgrade your mouse to the latest corded gaming mouse, whatever that may be at this time. </s>
