the zenith 248. no training in how to use it, just some manuals and disks.
i learned how to turn it on only to be greeted by a blinking cursor following the c:&gt; prompt.
i had just learned how to use the xerox 860 word processor then to have this dumped on my desk.
oh, i was in the u.s. navy and was soon to deploy aboard the uss nimitz in 1985. such was my introduction to ms-dos and the personal computer.
