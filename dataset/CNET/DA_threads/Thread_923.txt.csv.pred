1.1.1	I just got a TV tuner card, but channels 2-9 on cable input look fuzzy even as most, but not all, other channels look better than on my 25&quot; TV.	St
1.1.2	I'm wondering if this has to do w. the lower resolutions on TV sets, anti-piracy protection, or what.	St
1.1.3	Thanks a lot.	St
1.2.1	Tsee, I'm having the same problem, but I believe that the cable companies signals are bad.	St
1.2.2	I still haven't been able to fix this problem (since Sept 2005).	St
1.2.3	I'm moving soon so I'll find out if it's my cable provider or not.	St
