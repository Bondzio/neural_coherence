Bob was suggesting that Printers and &quot;Servers&quot; have a constant address.
The computers on your network do not really need a static IP address.
However, if you have one computer that all the others share files from, then it would be beneficial for that computer to have a Static IP address.
An address that remains constant makes it easier to find on the network.
System preferences &gt; Network &gt; Built-in Ethernet and select Static for the IP address.
You would then enter an IP address into the required fields and hit Apply.
Make sure that the IP address that you allocated to the computer is outside the range that the DHCP server, usually in the router, will be assigning.
