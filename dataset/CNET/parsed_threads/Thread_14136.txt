<s> I have a Xerox 470CX Printer, Scanner, Copier, and Fax Machine that a friend gave me. </s>
<s> I downloaded the drivers, and everything works fine, but I do not have the manual. </s>
<s> I tried to download the PDF file from Xerox's Website, but it locks up. </s>
<s> My problem is Scanning. </s>
<s> I'm using Windows 98 Imaging Program to scan with. </s>
<s> The scanner (Twain) works great, but after I scan something the program closes and there is no image in the Imaging program. </s>
<s> I can't print, or save anything! </s>
<s> I mean where does it go, and what file name is it under? </s>
<s> Xerox Tech. </s>
<s> Support says it saves it to the hard drive, but where on my hard drive? </s>
<s> Not in Xerox's Folder. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I can't help either. </s>
<s> The details are missing in your post. </s>
<s> Your PC may need motherboard drivers that Xerox will not usually help you with. </s>
<s> Tell more, Bob </s>
<s> Hey Bob, thanks for responding! </s>
<s> What more &quot;details&quot; do you need? </s>
<s> The scanner works fine, I just can't do anything with the image after it's scanned. </s>
<s> Most Scanner Programs I've used, let you save the scanned image as a BMP file or something. </s>
<s> I can't do anything with Xerox's Twain Scanner Program. </s>
<s> There is no save, or save as options, and right clicking doesn't bring up any new windows with options. </s>
<s> The only thing I can do is look at the image, and exit out of the Twain program. </s>
<s> I just can't figure it out! </s>
<s> I'm going to try and download Xerox's Manual again. </s>
<s> Please let me know if you come across anything, and thanks for your help! </s>

<s> Such is noted with each post. </s>
<s> There could be a need to install motherboard drivers or other. </s>
<s> You didn't tell how it was plugged in, any version software and more. </s>
<s> Any clue would be helpful. </s>

<s> Hey, I'm re-downlaoding the drivers for the Scanner. </s>
<s> Also, I downloaded a image scan program called 20/20. </s>
<s> I'll let you know weither it works or not. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Some of your issue may be the PC's drivers. </s>
<s> But without sharing this information I can't comment if you need an updated motherboard or other driver. </s>
