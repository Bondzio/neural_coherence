newegg [great outfit].
They state exact replacement only, HOWEVER, call the 800 number, talk to their customer support, they'll work with you.
They won't do a direct exchange however will give full credit when they get the part back and inspect that they got all of the pieces back.
Meanwhile place a new order for what you want.
You'll have to pay then but you will get the refund when they get the part back.
I've done this with newegg a number of times.
