i took the ram out of an old computer and it is no longer compatible with my current and i'm wondering if anybody knows any cpu's out there that would be able to accept this ram.
i'm not sure what info you'll need so this is all the info i can see on it.
on the ram: hyundai korea hy57v658020b 0024b tc-75 on the sticker: hym7v631601 hyundai btfg-75 ba korea pc133u-333-542-a1 0028 this was taken from an older model dell dimensions...1000 i believe.
most likely a fairly minimal amount of ram, but some data i'd like to retrieve.
any help appreciated, thanks.
