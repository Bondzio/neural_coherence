I have a 4x AGP-compatible mobo.
I am looking to get a 128 MB vid card, and I am thinking that it would probably make sense to get an 8x AGP card.
I would assume they are backwards compatible to a 4x mobo without any major issues?
I would rather not update the mobo at this time if I can help it, but I also don't want to limit myself for the future by getting a 4x AGP card.
I was looking at probably the Radeon 9600 or 9800, although the 9200 is a possibility too.
I don't know much about Nvidias, but I would be open to looking at them too.
The biggest thing is that it needs to be DX 9.0 compatible.
