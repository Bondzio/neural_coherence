Okay so I just got a new sound card from creative and put it into my Lenovo motherboard via pci express and when I plug in my optical cable the light is on but when I plug it into my receiver, nothing I am trying to get 5.1 and on my computer when I set the optical to default it says it's outputting sound, I cannot get it to make any sound for the life of me.
The analog works.
