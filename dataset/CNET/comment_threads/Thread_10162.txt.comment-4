I've re-formatted before and not had any problems, i've never installed a driver for the motherboard.
Everytime i've re-formatted i have installed audio and video drivers.
I have tried to repair the connection in network properties and it fails to renew the ip address.
I didnt know about the ipconfig/release and ipconfig/renew commands, i will try that and see what happens.
I have also tried copying the settings from one of the other pc's on the network which can connect to the internet, setting my own ip and gateway and dns etc, with a different ip.
When i do this and start up windows explorer to see if it is going to connect it tries for longer before timing out and failing, than when it obtains the ip automatically.
Could there be a problem with the network card, even though in device manage it says it is working properly Thanks for helping i've run out of ideas Jules
