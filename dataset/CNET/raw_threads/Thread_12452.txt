Your expert comments on what will work best is welcome. I have collected at least 5 USB HDDs ranging from 160GB to 2TB. I hate to connect and disconnect all of them one after the other to my laptop and having a 3 year old at home makes me scared that he will topple the HDDs. So I would like all these (or at least 2 of these with auto-power option) to be connected to network all the time for me to access. I wonder if there is any device for cheap that I could hook up my external HDDs to. I am no geek so a simple set up is appreciated. If such device does not exist, I have 1TB internal HDD that I use on HDD dock. I could place that one in a NAS enclosure. I wonder if anyone has a recommendation for 'best bang for the buck' enclosure. If you have any suggestion for another setup, I welcome the suggestion. I checked old threads on this forum and devices suggested in those threads are not available anymore. Hence this thread. Many thanks in advance for all the suggestions and recommendations.
