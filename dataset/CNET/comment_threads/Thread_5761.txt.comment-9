just like a western digital passport will work.
these drives use low power hard drives (like those in notebooks/laptops) and get their power solely from the usb cable.
there is no ac adapter.
older drives needed 2 ports.
newer drives only need 1 port but the hub for that port should not be shared by another device with a high power draw (like a scanner, another portable hard drive, usb sound device, or a usb powered coffee warmer).
for most folks with newer pcs the &quot;go&quot; and &quot;passport&quot; are plug-and-play.
