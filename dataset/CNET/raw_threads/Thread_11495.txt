My friend built my computer with windows me when I go to system information it tells me that my drives have been partitioned into 3drives Disk#0 partion#0, Disk#0 Partion#1(which is my c-drive) and Disk#0 partition#2. Somebody tell me how I can fix this problem as whenever I load anything it tells me I have no space but yet I have a 40gb hard drive. My computer is a 900 amd athlon with a chaintech socket a nvidia nforce2 motherborad.

Bob, The partition is in Linux form that makes it harder to get rid and reloading my windows disk doesnt resolve the problem. They had a thing on c-net called partition magic which was a free version but because it was Linux it wouldnt do anything about it.
