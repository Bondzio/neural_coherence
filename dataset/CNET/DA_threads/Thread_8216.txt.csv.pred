1.1.1	Hi , I am in the market for a new printer and would be grateful for any info , advice , suggestions , and/or warnings before making the purchase .	St
1.1.2	Its been years since I 've owned a printer and am not at all tech savvy , so would appreciate any and all help .	St
1.1.3	I have spent many hours online researching manufacturers and reading reviews , but am struggling with the numerous options and differing opinions .	St
1.1.4	A general rundown on what I am after is - something that is reasonably easy to understand and operate ( I 'm not a total idiot and am able to follow most instructions , but computers and anything related are not my forte ) , prints quality photos ( my main motivation for getting a printer ) , costs no more than $ 150 to buy ( on a budget and price is definately a factor , but am willing to shell out a bit more for quality and durability ) , and that uses reasonably priced toner or ink cartridges .	St
1.1.5	The printer will be for personal use only and do n't anticipate using it too often .	St
1.1.6	As mentioned , I am mainly looking for something I can print decent pics with .	St
1.1.7	I am also trying to figure out what would be more cost effective - laser or ink jet .	St
1.1.8	Based on what I 've looked at online , the laser printers appear to cost substantially more , but do they work out cheaper in the long run if the cost of replacement ink/toner cartridges are factored in ?	Ques
1.1.9	I would be thankful for any info at all , including any warnings about printers to avoid .	St
1.1.10	I would like to stay away from HP 's - bought an expensive HP laptop and experienced issue after issue ending with it being beyond repair about 2 weeks after the warrenty expired .	St
1.1.11	Realize such crappy quality may not apply to all HP products , but the experience left me with an aversion to anything with the HP name on it .	St
1.1.12	If you have taken the time to read all of this , thank you !	St
1.1.13	Thanks in advance as well for any words of wisdom you may have for this tech challenged girl !	St
1.1.14	Soozalooza	St
1.2.1	For the consumer market , the best photo quality still comes from inkjet printers .	St
1.2.2	Laser printers would be the better choice for B & W as far as cost per page .	St
1.2.3	As for durability , that comes with a price and so your $ 150 budget is n't going to promise you years of reliability .	St
1.2.4	You 're mention that your printer will see limited use also works against you with an inkjet printer .	St
1.2.5	You will waste a lot of ink due to cleaning cycles and risk clogging of the print head due to drying of the ink .	St
1.2.6	As well , that $ 150 .	St
1.2.7	just gets you a printer and & quot ; starter & quot ; cartridges which means they are not full and produce only a few pages .	St
1.2.8	Your major cost will be in ink .	St
1.2.9	Perhaps you 'd be better off to figure cost per page or cost per print .	St
1.2.10	If it were n't that you wanted the best print quality , I 'd suggest a color laser type .	St
1.2.11	Their text quality and their color quality for brochures and such will be quite good but photo quality will be lacking when compared to good inkjets .	St
1.2.12	Laser printers also do n't need cleaning cycles and do n't dry out between uses .	St
1.2.13	It does sound as though your purposes would be better suited by an inkjet printer but be prepared for the higher cost per page .	St
1.2.14	As for brands , I 've always used HP color inkjets and have an HP B & W laserjet that 's been running well for 8 or 10 years .	St
1.2.15	HP made printers long before they made PCs and do a decent job ( IMO ) in that market .	St
1.2.16	Epson and Canon also do well .	St
1.2.17	One thing you will also want to consider is the availability of ink locally .	St
1.2.18	Check out your office supply stores to see what ink stock they carry .	St
1.2.19	A good price on a printer without ink readily available is n't a good deal .	Polite
1.2.20	Best of luck .	Polite
