1.1.1	My other mac 1.2GHz PowerPC G4 512 MB DDR SDRAM OS Z 10.4.11 Last night it had been closed and asleep .	St
1.1.2	On opening , it made a very loud noise ( i was not there to hear it ) very similar to either the normal sounds of the CD drive or the fan working overtime .	St
1.1.3	It did not wake up .	St
1.1.4	The CD drive is empty .	St
1.1.5	On re-booting , we get the grey screen with the spinning gear for a very long time and then the blue screen of death , which fades to slightly darker shade of blue after a few seconds .	St
1.1.6	None of the start-up shortcuts seem to make much difference .	St
1.1.7	& # 8984 ; -Option-P-R followed by holding down the option key on restart led to the select startup disk prompt , but no further .	St

1.2.2	An iBook G4 or a PowerBook G4 perhaps ?	Ques

1.2.6	If it will not boot from the disk , reboot and hold down the Option key until you see the Select Startup Disk prompt .	St
1.2.7	The Command-Option-P-R sequence is the correct way to zap the PRAM but all the keys must be held down at the same time .	St

1.2.9	If you have been running the computer , then you do have the cables necessary to run the other , identical , one .	St
