I just bought a set of Logitech Z-5500 THX speakers. http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/speakers_audio/home_pc_speakers/devices/224&cl=US,EN I almost bought this card http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16829102005&nm_mc=TEMC-RMA-Approvel&cm_mmc=TEMC-RMA-Approvel-_-Content-_-text-_-N82E16829102005 but I found out I couldn't make a direct digital connection to the speaker systewm via optical or digital coax. So I'm seriously considering getting this card http://www.auzentech.com/site/products/x-fi_prelude.php I have seen some reviews where people had problems with crackling popping etc if they use a mobo with an Nvidia chipset. http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductReview.aspx?Item=29-156-005&SortField=0&SummaryType=0&Pagesize=10&SelectedRating=-1&PurchaseMark=&VideoOnlyMark=False&VendorMark=&Page=1&Keywords=nvidia Here's what it says on Auzentech's site &quot;Q: Why do I hear cracking and popping in the audio? A: Apparently this problem can affect a portion of users using soundcards based on the X-Fi chipset in computers that include NVIDIA hardware. Below is a quote from NVIDIA: Creative and NVIDIA have been investigating reports of performance issues in some systems that have NVIDIA components as well as Creative's Sound Blaster X-Fi soundcard installed. There were complex, bandwidth-related issues involving memory allocation that made isolation of the issue and subsequent resolution time consuming and difficult. After thorough QA and testing, NVIDIA released a BIOS update for motherboards designed by NVIDIA and based on the NVIDIA nForce 680i SLI MCP, which has resolved such issues. For any X-Fi owners using these motherboards but are still experiencing issues, we advise you to contact your motherboard manufacturer regarding the availability of an updated bios.&quot; I am using an ASrock 939 dual sata2 mobo http://www.asrock.com/mb/overview.asp?Model=939Dual-SATA2&s=939 which has the ULi 1695 chipset (ULi M1695/ ULi M1567) . Anyone think there would be any problems using this sound card with my mobo? I'm running XP SP2 Thanks

I went control panel, then to sound and audio devices, and where it used to say the sound card I have, it just says no audio devices. I know I have a sound card, but I think my sound card might have come loose or something when I was messing with my computer. I have no idea how to check or anything. Can someone please help me to figure out how to get my sound card to work? thanks

Digital In/Out requires the i/o module. Your older mobo won't suffer from the x-fi/nvidia 600 chipset issue (which has been corrected for over a year). vista 32bit x-fi drivers are also stable but 64bit drivers may still be problematic.
