1.1.1	Hi all .	St
1.1.2	I have been using the Corsair H50 water cooler for some months with the fan that came with it and no problems at all .	St
1.1.3	I decided to buy a new fan for the radiater just to see if I could get cpu temps .	St
1.1.4	down even more .	St
1.1.5	I bought an Akasa Apache Black PWM fan , took out the Corsair fan and installed the Apache .	St
1.1.6	Now when I BOOT I get an error beep .	St
1.1.7	In BIOS it reports that the CPU fan which the fan has to be connected to is n't spinning .	St
1.1.8	I turned off CPU fan fail warning .	St
1.1.9	In Windows I used Core Temp to check cpu temp .	St
1.1.10	and it was stable at 35-36c meaning the fan was working .	St
1.1.11	Question is why does the Apache fan cause an error and the Corsair does'nt ?	Ques
1.1.12	Both are 4 pin PWM fans and all I did was take one out and replace with the other .	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	Watch Corsair video for installation .	St
1.3.2	Connect H50 circulation motor to CPU fan header .	St
1.3.3	Connect radiator fan to any 12V supply and adjust speed using potentiometer for fan .	St
1.4.1	I have watched the Corsair Video extensively and read many posts from various forums plus it is common sense .	St
1.4.2	The pump that fits over the cpu has to have 100 % power all the time so is connected to a 3 pin power connecter that 's why the pump connecter is 3 pin .	St
1.4.3	The fan connects to the PWM/cpu fan connecter as this is the variable speed for cooling the raidater that 's why the fan comes with a 4 pin PWM connecter .	St
1.5.1	Only email I could get with Akasa was a @ sales mail .	St
1.5.2	There is no support for fans in general .	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
