that the new hardware are actually motherboard devices and you should be using the motherboard cd to install them with.
the easiest way if you don't have that cd is to first get on the net to the maker of the board and download the newest drivers for the board that are available.
if you don't know what hardware devices are in your system use the free on-line scan at belarc and it will list the maker and model numbers for all your currently installed hardware (physically in the case, not necessary driver installed yet).
the report is printable, but you may not have your printer up and running yet so you will have to write them all down manually.
and that's only if you are able to get on the net since you may be here using a different computer completely.
belarc hardware id: this one is free.
run it on line, d/l or copy to a floppy (500k+).
anyone who is wondering what is in their machine should find this useful.
the &quot;belarc advisor&quot; is useful, and free for personal use.
it &quot;builds a detailed profile of your installed software and hardware.&quot; it runs on windows 95/98/me, nt 4, windows 2000 and xp, and in just a minute or so, creates a local web page (one that resides on your pc--- nothing is sent back to belarc).
the page contains a rundown of all the hardware in and attached to your system, plus information on all the installed software including license and version numbers.
makes a handy reference.
