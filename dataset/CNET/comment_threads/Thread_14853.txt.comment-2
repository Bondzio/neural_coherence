BIG BUCKS There are a lot of recovery companies out there but all of them charge a lot of money to recover a disk.
Expect to pay at least a couple of thousand to recover a decent size drive.
I would be tempted to give Disk Warrior a chance at the disk but from your description of the sounds, I would not hold out great hope.
I know it is a little late now, but perhaps your client will now consider a backup strategy, Time Machine for instance.
