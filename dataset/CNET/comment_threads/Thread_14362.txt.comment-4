While the above is generally true, the Asus A7N8X-E Deluxe board will run successfully in dual channel mode with, say, two sticks of 256MB PC3200 in Channel &quot;A&quot;, and one stick of 512MB PC3200 in Channel &quot;B&quot;, providing a total of one Gig of memory.
This board has only three memory slots, and the configuration data supplied in the Asus manual can be confusing.
