per manual meaning put in the right pci slot because manual says to first disable old graphics card which is what brought me here!
so can we still do this wihthout going by the manual.it doesnt give good details.
step 4 do you mean connect to onboard monitor port or new radeon monitor port that works.
step 5 can u explain how to access bios im installing pci card.
step 6 switch monitor ports if needed?
