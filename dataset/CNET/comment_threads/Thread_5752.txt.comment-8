just installing the os level drivers won't change the bootloader's drivers which are part of the master boot record.
so when the image is applied to the raid volume, xp won't boot since the bootloader will be using ata/sata drivers, not the vendor specific raid driver.
raid 1 is often transparent to the OS since the controller makes 2 drives look like 1, but striping (and raid 5) always requires a low-level raid driver since 2+ drives are being merged.
and, striping cannot be enable without having some drives to stripe.
once enabled, the controller will clear the partition tables on the striped drives.
