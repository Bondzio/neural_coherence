<s> I have an HP Pavilion quad core m9040n that I want to attach an external hard drive to. </s>
<s> I am getting conflicting advice on how exactly to connect it. </s>
<s> The HP does not have an esata port, but all I think I need is to buy an esata plate for the back and connect it internally to one of the spare ports. </s>
<s> If I do that, what kind of esata cable do I need to buy? </s>
<s> A regular esata cable, or an esata-to-esata cable? </s>
<s> I want to buy all the right parts at the same time. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> contains a lot of drives so make sure it has an unused SATA port before you buy the &quot;eSATA bracket&quot;. </s>
<s> There should be one metal slot cover you can remove and install the bracket. </s>
<s> Hopefully your external drive has an eSATA port...if so, get an eSATA-to-eSATA cable and you're good to go. </s>
<s> If your external has a SATA port (L-shaped instead of I-shaped), get an eSATA-to-SATA cable. </s>
<s> If the PC has no unused SATA ports, you should be able to still buy and install a PCI-E SATA card with an external eSATA port. </s>
<s> In this case you'll need to install the driver for the card. </s>
<s> Google the terms I used above if you are wondering what they look like. </s>
<s> If your external drive has the eSATA connection then you want the plate to have the eSATA connection as well. </s>
<s> Normally the drive should come with the cable as well (in this case, it would be a black shielded cable). </s>
<s> The internal sata cable will most likely to red. </s>

<s> FYI: I bought the bracket/plate (whatever it is supposed to be called), and I plugged the red cable it had internally to an empty sata port. </s>
<s> When I connected my external hard drive to the plate with an esata-to-esata cable, my computer detected it right away! </s>
<s> I was really expecting that I would have to buy an esata pci card, rather than just the bracket, but I didn't, WOOHOO! </s>
<s> The only downer was I was dismayed to see that it came preformatted as FAT32. </s>
<s> I reformatted it to NTFS, but it is a 1TB drive and it took FOREVER, like more than an hour, at least - I don't know exactly how long - instead of watching the progress bar painfully crawl along I went out and had some fun and came back hours later and all was well . </s>
