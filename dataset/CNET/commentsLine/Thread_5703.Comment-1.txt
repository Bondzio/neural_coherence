i need to buy a lot of ink cartridges, so i'm trying to find a place online to buy these for the least cost.
i wasn't sure if anyone had any favorites.
so far i have checked with: staples office depot office max circuit city best buy cd amazon antonline beach audio ace photo digital j&r the nerds.net b&h video direct inkjet superstore ebay wal-mart kmart also, if you have any negative experiences with these sites i appreciate that info as well.
thanks
