<s> I have a laptop PC running Vista (I have a windows 7 upgrade but am afraid to try to install it) I also have a cannon mp830 all in one fax/printer/etc. </s>
<s> Internet service is high speed cable from comcast. </s>
<s> I would like to minimize my cables and add some flexibility to my current set up. </s>
<s> I want to add a wireless router, add capapability to print/fax etc wirelessly, and maybe add a budget friendly modem (I lease mine from comcast however $5/ month starting to add up)... my condo is not that big (under 1000 sq ft) and pretty open. </s>
<s> Home office set up in living room. </s>
<s> the farthest i would get from the router is walking up a flight of steps to my deck outside above my condo, maybe 20 ft vertically above me. </s>
<s> is there an all in one router/modem that will also enable me to print wirelessly? </s>
<s> I tried asking a couple of online retailers however 2 declined sales support and the other recommended equipment that would be suitable for an office. </s>
<s> I only have one computer and a single printer. </s>
<s> it does not need to be overly complicated or high tech (or expensive). </s>
<s> I know that speed bottlenecks can occur anywhere in the system though im sure that current routers (and a new modem) will eclipse what i currently have speedwise. </s>
<s> also, will i have compatability issues if i decide to upgrade to windows 7 suggestions.....thx </s>
<s> I might suggest you get your own modem and router. </s>
<s> I run a D-link DCM-202 modem and a D-link DIR-655 router. </s>
<s> Both mine. </s>
<s> The modem is DOCSYS 2.0 (will handle the highest speed connection) and the router is wireless N and Gigabit wired. </s>
<s> With this setup you are wired and wireless for the future. </s>
<s> I do not recommend a modem/router combo. </s>
<s> Waaaaay too much trouble to configure. </s>
<s> Print wirelessly? </s>
<s> Is the printer a wireless printer? </s>
<s> If so the router will find it. </s>
<s> If not, keep it wired. </s>
<s> There are wireless printer adapters out there but they can be a PITA. </s>
<s> My router is printer compatible (wired). </s>
<s> It can act as a print server. </s>
<s> Connect it to the router and carry the laptop around. </s>
