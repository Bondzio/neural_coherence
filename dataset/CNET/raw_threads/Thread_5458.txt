Are there any other symptoms besides the noise? Does the system work properly otherwise? How long has it been going on? Does it sound like a fan bearinng going bad (more of a squeal than a whistle to my ears)? Frank

While there inspect and clean out the system case to include all fans as well. Re-inspect for noise source. If it is a fan, replace with compatible one. FYI - You didn't provide much info on your system, it matters. tada -----Willy
