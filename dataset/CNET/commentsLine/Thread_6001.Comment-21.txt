what a great program!
it was bad memory.
i couldn't find a page that explains what all the data was (if you know of a link, i'd be interested in reading it), but it was clear enough that something was awry with 3-7000 errors per sweep and at least 20 notations of bad ram.
instead of trying to figure out which stick was bad though, i decided to replace.
given that i will not be able to buy a new computer in the next year or at worst maybe two or three, i decided after seeing the rdram prices that buying without upgrading would not be so smart.
2.2 ghz is still a pretty decent speed for an old model, and i found a semi-okay price for a 2g set.
throwing $500 into an old computer might seem excessive, but i can't tell you how pleased i am - i'm working on an image-packed publication right now, and this computer sings!
i don't have to reinstall or transfer anything, i can sit back while the rest of the world works out the vista bugs, and i'm not adding to the mountain of discarded hardware (yet).
god willin' (if something else doesn't go wrong), someday we can make this sweetie into a server or have an extra computer for someone else to use.
thanks for all your help.
