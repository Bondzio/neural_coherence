<s> Hi, I have two computers on a network. </s>
<s> They access the internet via an adsl modem router, which works fine. </s>
<s> One has xp home, other has just been re-installed with xp pro. </s>
<s> Before I reinstalled xp pro, it all worked. </s>
<s> Now, I can't copy files from one computer to the other. </s>
<s> I have run network wizard on both pc's, folders are shared on both pc's, workgroup is mshome on both pc's. </s>
<s> I am logged in as administrator on both pc's. </s>
<s> Each computer can see the shared folders on the other, but trying to acces them gives an access denied message. </s>
<s> What have I overlooked ? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> create an identical user account -same name and password on both machines? </s>
<s> If not, do so and then recreate the shares. </s>
<s> Shares created prior will not be accessible. </s>
<s> Also double check that Print and File sharing is checked in the Windows Firewall on both computers. </s>
<s> Disable any other firewalls such as Norton or McAfee. </s>
<s> Does this mean that I have to unshare all the shared folders on my machine I didn't re-install xp on, then re-share them ? </s>
<s> I presume I won't need to change anything on this machine, as nothing has been changed on it. </s>
<s> On a separate note, this machine lists under my network places all the shared folders that used to exist on the other machine, but don't any more. </s>
<s> How do I stop this machine showing shared network folders that no longer exist ? </s>
