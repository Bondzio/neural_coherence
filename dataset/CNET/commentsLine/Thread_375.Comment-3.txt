i have an old win98 machine that comes on in the middle of the night too.
i have assumed that it is doing maintenence which is scheduled to be done by the program which you set up to do these things (forgot the name--i don't use the pc much).
check the program list--i think under accessories.
&quot;scheduled maintenence&quot; or some such.
