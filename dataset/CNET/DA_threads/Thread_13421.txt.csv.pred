1.1.1	Hi , I have a little problem , and i 've been trying to find some answers on the net , but nothing .	St
1.1.2	I have put a new cpu cooler - Coolermaster Hyper 6+ in my computer .	St
1.1.3	It 's a 4-pin cooler connected on a 4-pin connector on the Intel D975XBXLKR Bad Axe motherboard with 975X Express Chipset .	St
1.1.4	I have Intel Pentium D 930 processor .	St
1.1.5	So , the problem is that the temperature of my CPU is 46 degrees with opened case , and 51-58 with closed case and the fan speed is max .	St
1.1.6	1750rpm .	St
1.1.7	The cooler specif .	St
1.1.8	says that the fan speed is from 1800-3600 rpm .	St
1.1.9	I have installed speed fan and all the fans ( front , rear and cpu-fan ) are monitored and controlled trough EMC6D103 chip and as I understand , PWM function .	St
1.1.10	I 've tryed to change the speed with speedfan , but nothing happends .	St
1.1.11	With the default processor fan i had the same temperature results , but he changed the speed normaly , from 1900-2500 rpm .	St
1.1.12	Help please , if You have any idee .	Sug
1.1.13	THX !	St
1.1.14	!	St
1.2.1	http : //processorfinder.intel.com/Details.aspx ? sSpec=SL94R notes some 63.4C temperature and a CPU that can emit possibly 93 Watts .	St
1.2.2	To drag the temperature down you 'll have to work very hard to improve the cooling .	St
1.2.3	But so far you are in spec .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	As I understand it , the 4-wire fans ( 2nd level ) only work when needed once a certain temp is reached .	St
1.3.2	Once , that theshold is meant , then the higher rpm fan setting kicks in to help cool an over-heated cpu .	St
1.3.3	It seems after reviewing the website Robert posted you 're within std .	St
1.3.4	specs .	St
1.3.5	of the cpu operation .	St
1.3.6	Unless , your bios has a fan setting to change , then all this is done at a h/w level and no action from you will change it .	St
1.3.7	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	you 're setup is working as intended , but not as expected .	St
1.4.2	intel mobo 's do n't consider pentium 4/Ds & quot ; warm & quot ; until they hit about 55C and they 're not & quot ; hot & quot ; until they hit about 62C .	St
1.4.3	that 's why your cooler 's fan hardly spins up beyond its minimum setting .	St
1.4.4	( i 've got a 650 ( 3.4ghz ) with an artic cooler and its fan only spins about 500rpm most of the time and idle temp is about 55C .	St
1.4.5	if you have intel 's desktop utilities installed , open the mobo monitor and notice the green/yellow/red temp ranges . )	St
1.4.6	your bios may have an option to turn off its fan management .	St
1.4.7	doing so may allow speedfan to handle the management .	St
1.4.8	also make sure your version of speedfan supports the 975 chipset .	Sug
1.4.9	when i downloaded it last year it could n't work with my D945GNT mobo .	St
1.4.10	Alfredo Milani-Comparetti ( speedfan 's author ) sent me a beta build with support for the 945 chipset .	St
1.5.1	hey , thx a lot for youre answers , and , i have one more question - my defaul fans input is 0.42 A and this one 0.62 A. is it possible that my mobo doesent have enough power to run it ? !	St
1.5.2	and if it 's so , could i connect my cooling somewhere directly to power supply ( i'am working in 3ds max , bryce , autocad so i need a cold case Intel D975XBXLKR power supp .	St
1.5.3	Aopen , atx2 , 700w graphic card Wildcat Realizm 500	St
1.6.1	i think your cpu fan has both 4 and 3 pin connectors so you can plug it in several places .	St
1.6.2	with your mobo monitor , check which fan is running fastest and swap it for your cpu fan .	St
1.6.3	alternatively , you could get an $ 8 antec fan with speed control from cc/cUSA/bb .	St
1.6.4	you should be able to pull the molex adapter off of it and use it to plug your fan directly into the power supply .	St
1.6.5	then just mount the antec fan in the rear and plug it into the motherboard .	St
1.7.1	That 's a normal temperature for that CPU .	St
1.7.2	Why not just leave it alone and live with it ?	Ques
1.8.1	well , for frst i have built my configuration for 4 months and i 'd like it to work as i wanted to ( i know it 's impossible , and second , i hate when something is not working within specifications , or when i have some yelow ? ?	Ques
1.8.2	in my device man.and so on anyhow , the problem is not the cooling but the expectations	St
