1.1.1	Hi all I haven't been here for a very long time, since my last PC build just a little under 2 years ago, so I am really out of the loop with hardware and stuff, so once more I have returned to ask for the help and support of those more technology-knowledgeable than I.	St
1.1.2	Basically I start university on the 16th of September and will be moving away from home for the first time.	St
1.1.3	After much consideration, and due to my limited budget I have decided to try and build a new desktop PC, rather than buying a cheap laptop.	St
1.1.4	My budget is around &#65443;500 for the system and monitor, and due to limited desk space I will definitely need an LCD screen (19&quot; maybe?	St
1.1.5	): Primary Uses: - Listening to music, I am planning to purchase a set of 2.1 speakers and to use my PC as my main audio device instead of taking a hifi system down to university.	St
1.1.6	- The usual sort of office stuff, word, excel, running together with IRC, MSN maybe and also the music playing together with any other background things (Makes me wonder if I need a dual core?).	St
1.1.7	Secondary Uses: - I will likely watch movies regularly, in order to make use of the unlimited download bandwidth in campus in the first year.	St
1.1.8	- I will probably play on a few games, but I'm not a big gamer and if I do play games they tend to be strategy games and the like, rather than first person shooters and stuff, so frame rate isn't a huge problem for me, but a nice looking screen would be good.	St
1.1.9	As I will go very soon, this leaves me just a few days to decide upon what parts I want for my PC so that I can order them and get the system put together before I head off to university.	St
1.1.10	Therefore I would really, really appreciate any support and advice any of you can offer on this subject... as to be honest I just don't know what combination, within my price range will give me the best performance for the above stuff?	St
1.1.11	Thanks in advance to anybody who is willing to give me a helping hand!	St
1.1.12	Kindest Regards John	St
1.2.1	My budget is around &#65443;500 for the system and monitor, and due to limited desk space I will definitely need an LCD screen (19&quot; maybe?	St
1.2.2	): What's your budget?	St
1.2.3	I can give you advice, and give a rough list of parts, but I have no idea what UK prices are like, as I live in the US.	St
1.3.1	That budget is 500?	St
1.3.2	(The ''pound'' symbol didn't translate in your post.)	St
1.4.1	I've been working at a major computer retailer here in the States for the past two years, and it made me realize, for that price range, it can be really hard to beat a Compaq, eMachine, etc.	St
1.4.2	I am talking regular, no rebate, full retail prices.	St
1.4.3	So my advice is just make sure you price match some pre-built systems against what you are going to build, you may be suprised.	St
1.5.1	Yeah it is 500 (UK) pounds.	St
1.5.2	As for retail machines, I check with dell and it seems they cut corners in areas which I could cover in I choose carefully.	St
1.6.1	What website are you buying from?	Polite
1.6.2	Can you post a link?	St
1.6.3	If you post a link, I'll make a list of parts that fits your budget.	St
1.6.4	Thanks -Nathan	St
1.7.1	unless you're a serious gamer, something like an acer aspire 1642zwlm for 425 pounds (inc VAT w/centrino 1.7ghz, 512mb, 60gb, dvd burner, 15&quot; widescreen) is hard to beat.	St
1.7.2	you can probably shop around and get this one for less or a better one still under your budget.	St
1.7.3	you can tote a laptop to class/library and bring it home on holidays.	St
1.7.4	in the US, laptops are required at a number of universities as you must bring them to certain classes.	St
