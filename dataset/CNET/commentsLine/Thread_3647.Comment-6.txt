thanks for your response ray.
i've only got one black lever on my assembly.
then these two clips which were a bugger to get in properly in the first place, and seem even worse to get out.
last time i had a go i was trying to do it with the mobo in place, next time i'll remove it and have another go... and cross my fingers, toes and everything else.
cheers darren
