thanks for the response, i'm definitely looking into a seagate right now and i've definitely learned my lesson on backing up and keeping data secure because after a year seeing my hard drive, digital camera, cell phone and other technology fail, i'm very cautious.
what other media should i keep data on besides maybe a rotation of external hard drives.
my recovered data is coming back on about 17 dvd -roms ugh
