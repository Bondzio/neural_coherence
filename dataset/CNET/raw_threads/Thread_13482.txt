Put new heat sink compound on and re-installed. Now computer will not begin to start but will stop and start again. anyone have this problem?

Those cheesy plastic 1/4 turn locking mounts are the worst...if that's what you have. You need the thermal compound evenly spread. No gaps. And you need the heat sink flush across the entire CPU with all mounts exerting even pressure. If one mount pops up, heat transfer is severely compromised.

Also, the cpu surface should be 100% cleaned before application. Smear the compound out and then re-attach the HSF to it. As explained by Steven, if applied wrong or at a slight angle, etc., it may not have full contact. Any ducting is in place as it should be. Any wiring(fan or sensor) re-connected, etc..Also, don't over-tighten screws as well. Since, you know its related to the previous work you did, it needs to be rechecked.
