<s> Yesterday I changed my computer case ever since my computer has randomly been giving me 3 beeps (base read/write error) the first time I just wobbled the ram, it worked. </s>
<s> then a couple of hours later windows randomly shutdown on it's own, when it rebooted the POST stalled on dram initial b.1. </s>
<s> so after messing around I found if I removed the ram sticks from a particular slot the computer would boot. </s>
<s> Slot 1, but I decided to keep at it and try to get it to work. </s>
<s> now slot 1 is oporational, but slot 2 has decided to copy it's brother and stop working no matter what ram stick I put into it, it will just stall on POST with the status dram initial b.1 also the ram in slot 1 is not being detected Steps taken to attempt to resolve this Taken all ram sticks out when slot 2 was playing up Put all sticks back in slot 2 worked again, slot 3 stops working Cannot use slot 2 at the moment Flashed the BIOS multiple times with the latest BIOS release from my motherboard manufacturer Took the CMOS battery out and cleared CMOS. </s>
<s> All steps have proved inconclusive. </s>
<s> any suggestions what is wrong with my computer? </s>
