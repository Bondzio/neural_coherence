<s> I've noticed that whenever I make or receive phone calls on my iPhone 3G I lose my wireless internet signal. </s>
<s> Anybody else have experience with this or have suggestions on what can be done so my wireless connection is not disrupted? </s>
<s> Sometimes it comes back automatically, but other times I must manually reset the modem. </s>
<s> The modem is a Netgear WRN85RT (I think), either way, last time I checked there were no firmware updates available for it. </s>
<s> The wired connection is not interrupted, only the wireless. </s>
<s> Hope someone can help. </s>
<s> I've seen that a lot. </s>
<s> I visit the maker's site to see if new firmware is out and if not try a new router. </s>
<s> I'm guessing you already have the router set per the Cnet Networking Forum suggestions. </s>
