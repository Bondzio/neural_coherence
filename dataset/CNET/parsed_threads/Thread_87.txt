<s> I'm building a comp. </s>
<s> and I was wondering if any has any experience with sli memory? </s>
<s> I'll be putting it on an asus striker extreme motherboard/E6600 cpu. </s>
<s> I just want to know if it is all hype or is it good. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> I personally haven't used it yet, but I'm getting ready to use some in a system I'm building next week. </s>
<s> Apparently, it comes pre-loaded with a few different performance specs to make overclocking easier, or at least that's my take on it. </s>
<s> The only company I know of that manufactures SLI RAM is Corsair, and that's due to the partnership they created with Nvidia to use the SLI moniker. </s>
<s> It isn't going to enhance SLI performance, it's just using the same 3 letters. </s>
<s> It should work just as well as any other RAM on the market. </s>
<s> Ocz makes sli memory also. </s>
<s> But you are right, Corsair is tight with Nvidia. </s>
