(another interesting thing is why it doesn't show op on their website) 2) how can you you install windows 7 without an optical drive? i have read some of the articles on how to do this but i have been unsuccessful. i know you must format the USB drive a special way using the command prompt but i am not sure about the rest. Thanks, Brian

And to cut costs there is no CD/DVD drive. YOU have to decide if you will buy such now or later. Nothing new here but I'm encountering folk that feel entitled to restore media and DVDRW drives for odd reasons like &quot;it should have come with it.&quot; Bob
