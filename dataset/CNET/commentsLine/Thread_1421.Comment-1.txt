my new broadband provider has sent me a netgear dg834gt (108mbs), but i already have a dg834g (54mbs).
my house has no wired ethernet, my wireless router just plugs straight into the phone line via the filter.
we have three laptops and currently we don't get wireless reception in one part of the house.
i was wondering whether i could use my spare router (my old one) to create an access point somewhere in the trouble spot (which, obviously, is at the opposite end of the house to the main router).
my understanding of the difference between access point, repeater and wireless bridge is really really vague.
any help would be greatly appreciated.
