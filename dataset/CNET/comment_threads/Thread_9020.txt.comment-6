I'm convinced.
Should I order the wireless keyboard and mouse or stick with the default wired units?
I've read that some don't like Apple's mouse and use aftermarket products.
I'm still not sure about the difference between Bluetooth and wireless but is a Bluetooth enabled keyboard and mouse worthwhile technology?
I'll probably install Virex if only to keep from transmitting viruses with email.
Do I need to use an antispyware program periodically?
I presently spend the first 15 minutes of my day clearing spyware that Counterspy detects on my PC.
Thanks again.
Jay
