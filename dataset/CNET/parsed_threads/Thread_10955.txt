<s> Does anyone know of a way to make color corrections using the Photosmart 8250? </s>
<s> I have read the brief manual, gone through the HP imaging software, and tried every way I can think of to correct the extreme amount of magenta the printer is using for photos. </s>
<s> This problem is especially bad with flesh tones--they come out a bright pink. </s>
<s> While I can &quot;guess&quot; and make changes with Photoshop for each image, life would be better if I could adjust the printer settings to more accurately match the computer screen. </s>
<s> How did the CNET editor--who gave the 8250 a 7.4--miss this?? </s>
<s> It's a major problem. </s>
<s> I'm beginning to think there is no way to make color corrections with the printer--I want my Epson Stylus back! </s>
<s> Thanks for any suggestions! </s>

<s> I have the HP 8250 and had some what the same problem when I first got it. </s>
<s> Right click the 8250 in the control panel. </s>
<s> Click printing preference. </s>
<s> Click color, which should be the last tab on the right. </s>
<s> Click advanced color settings. </s>
<s> You should be able to adjust the colors to pretty much what you want. </s>
<s> I was printing a lot of photos of people and couldn't get the skin tones right until I set the the color managment to Colorsmart/sRGB. </s>
<s> I am taking wedding photos now for a little extra money and picked up a Epson Stylus Photo R380 and if people want a print, I use that printer over the 8250 because of the quality of the pictures. </s>
