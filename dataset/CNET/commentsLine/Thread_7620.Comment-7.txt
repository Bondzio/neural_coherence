hi, linkit, first, many thanks for your continued help.
the router is a linksys befw11s4 - ver.
4. i have downloaded an updated driver, but want to wait until tomorrow to install this.
my wife uses the dsl connection in her home office and is working there today.
when opening the control panel of the router it's clear how to browse to the file i placed on my desktop and upload the new firmware.
no, there's no other equipment on the newtork, just the router hard-wired to the dsl modem, three desktops with usb adapters (1 linksys, 2 d-link), and two laptops that have built-in adapters but are used only occasionally.
the network is configured as an &quot;infrastructure&quot; one; that is, the computers talk to the modem and not to each other.
tomorrow i will upload the new router firmware and, hopefully, report success.
