<s> I want to buy a pentium 3 on newegg but they only have them oem. </s>
<s> What does this mean. </s>
<s> Does it at least come with the instructions. </s>
<s> The site says processor only. </s>
<s> The P3 has been out of production for years now. </s>
<s> But to answer your question, it will be just the chip and nothing else... </s>
<s> It's mainly for those that need to fix a machine so no instructions, but look on the web? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Bob is correct but you need to know if the processor is a Coppermine or Tualatin core and which your motherboard can support. </s>
<s> Tualatins were late entries as the P4 release was imminent, as I recall, so older socket 370 boards did not support it. </s>
<s> BTW, OEM means &quot;Original Equipment Manufacturer&quot; which means these are the components PC builders buy in bulk and get a better deal. </s>
<s> You don't get the boxed products warranty from Intel and you do not get a fan/heatsink. </s>
<s> Hope that adds some helpful info. </s>
<s> does it at least come with instructions </s>
<s> What instructions are needed? </s>
<s> Ask here since many forum members have replaced a P3 CPU. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Making the CPU work and operate at it's potential is dependant on the MB more than anything else. </s>
<s> You must insert it properly and cool it. </s>
<s> These are &quot;keyed&quot; so you just about can't put it in wrong. </s>
<s> You will need to find an adequate fan and heat sink. </s>
<s> These are readily available and P3s don't produce the heat P4s do. </s>
<s> The fan will probably plug into a MB near the CPU socket. </s>
<s> You may have to set jumpers or core voltages but most modern MBs are jumper free and can autodetect the CPU and configure it. </s>
<s> You should have a MB manual handy and the web site of the manufacturer is usually a good source for these. </s>
