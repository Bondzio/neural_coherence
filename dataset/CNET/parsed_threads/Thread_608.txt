<s> fter a couple months use, my monitor started showing horizontal lines all over the screen. </s>
<s> Some of the lines were small and some were quite large. </s>
<s> Then my system started crashing. </s>
<s> Sometimes it would recover and give me a message that said &quot;VPU Recover has reset your graphics accelerator as it was no longer responding to graphics driver commands.&quot; Other times it would not come back and I'd need to reset the computer. </s>
<s> Here's what I've tried so far: 1) Uninstalled video drivers and reinstalled from files downloaded from ATI site. </s>
<s> When that made no difference, tried also with file downloaded from MSI site. </s>
<s> Still no help. </s>
<s> 2) Tried two other monitors, one an LCD and one CRT. </s>
<s> Same thing on both other monitors. </s>
<s> 3) Sent card back to MSI. </s>
<s> They checked it out & said it was fine. </s>
<s> 4) Installed new power supply. </s>
<s> No help. </s>
<s> 5) Finally I uninstalled the Radeon video adapters and the ATI drivers. </s>
<s> That stopped the system from crashing but I still get very small lines throughout the screen and the screen is very jerky when I scroll up & down. </s>
<s> Everything else is fine. </s>
<s> I can run all my programs. </s>
<s> The display is just very bad. </s>
<s> I'm aware that this is not a very good VGA card. </s>
<s> Is it possible that the drivers for this card are not compatible with my mobo? </s>
<s> Or could it be something else? </s>

<s> Your story is typical of an overheated machine. </s>
<s> Who made this? </s>
<s> You should contact them and get them to fix the machine since it's lifespan may be just a year or two. </s>

<s> The problem is undoubtedly with your video card. </s>
<s> Either it is defective, or it is overheating. </s>
<s> hi, I am also having the same problem but the same monitor is working fine with some other machine. </s>
<s> and some other monitor is working fine with the fault machine. </s>
<s> i tried renisatlling the os itself but i could not get retrified. </s>
<s> i am usiong intel 845gvsr motherboard and philips 105sf and samsung 793s both giving the same problem. </s>
<s> My problem was solved when I upgraded my VGA card. </s>
<s> I bought a Winfast PX6600GT, which is made by Leadtek, and everything cleared up. </s>
<s> Apparently, the card I had was not powerful enough to give me good video performance on this system. </s>
