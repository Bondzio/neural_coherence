<s> Hello everyone and Happy New Year! </s>
<s> For the new year I thought I'd build myself a new computer, but Ihave encountered some problems and I thought I'd ask for some help. </s>
<s> System specs: Mobo: Asus P5W DH Deluxe Processor: Intel D850 Dual Core RAM: 512 Power Supply: Xilence Power 600W Hard Drive: Barracuda 7200 80 Gigs DVD ROM: Samsung writemaster Video Card: MSI NX7100GS I only installed the basic hardware just to get the system up and running. </s>
<s> The hard drive is an old drive that I had in another PC. </s>
<s> The PC boot up but stuck in the Bios screen and does not go past that. </s>
<s> It recognized the hard drive and DVD-ROM drive. </s>
<s> I have checked ASUS' website it suggested to update the bios if the PC felt to boot. </s>
<s> As per ASUS's &quot;This problem can be resolved by updating BIOS to 0604 or later. </s>
<s> Please use a non-Core 2 processor to boot and perform this BIOS update.&quot; My question is: Since I don't have another processor to perform the upgrade, is there any other way of upgrading the BIOS? </s>
<s> Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Cheers and Happy New Year to everyone. </s>

<s> a cheap celeron CPU that will work in your MB and let you update the BIOS for the C2D processor. </s>
<s> What's the Intel D850 ??? </s>
<s> VPCMD </s>
<s> Sorry VAPCMD I meant to write Intel D805 not D850. </s>
<s> I think the D805 is the least expensive Celeron processor out there. </s>
<s> So I'm thinking it's not possible to upgrade the bios via the DVD drive...am I correct? </s>
<s> versions for that MB and it's not a Celeron. </s>
<s> http://support.asus.com/cpusupport/cpusupport.aspx?SLanguage=en-us&model=P5W%20DH%20Deluxe Did you plug the ATX12V in (4 pin square connector)? </s>
<s> Exactly what does it do when you turn it on? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Yes the ATX12V cable is connected to the board. </s>
<s> It's safe to say the processor and the motherboard should work together. </s>
<s> I have checked the link you provided and my bios version is Rev:1.03G higher than Rev:B0 version listed on the website http://support.asus.com/cpusupport/cpusupport.aspx?SLanguage=en-us&model=P5W%20DH%20Deluxe ..so I can safe say it's not the bios that's causing it not to work. </s>
<s> I'm getting a one beep during the bootup process. </s>
<s> According to the User Guide manual, the possible errors could be: &quot;keyboard controller error&quot;, &quot;Refresh time error&quot;, or &quot;No Master drive detected&quot;. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> The keyboard is working fine, because I'm able to navigate within the Bios screen. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I don't know what they mean by Refresh time error, so I have to look into that. </s>
<s> If you know what ii is, please tell me. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> No Master drive detected - but I can see the drive description within the bios screen. </s>
<s> Any suggestions as to what I should do next? </s>
<s> In the meantime I will try to find out any info on Refresh time error. </s>
<s> Thanks a million for your help...looking forward to your reply. </s>

<s> VAPCMD, Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> I think I&quot;m having a hard drive problem instead of Bios. </s>
<s> So I'm in the process of getting new hrad drives. </s>
<s> I'll keep you up to date. </s>
