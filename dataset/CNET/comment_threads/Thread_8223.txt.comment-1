My PC: HP Pavilion Media Center m7750n Athlon 64 X2 (W) 5000+ 2.6 GHz 4 GB DDR2 ram 400 GB SATA 7200rpm HD Running Vista I purchased a HP 1TB Personal Media Drive to use in the removable drive bay about 1 month ago.
Well the drive is loud and rather annoying to say the least.
I have one free internal 3.5&quot; bay available.
Is there any preference (internal or external) with regards to speed, noise and performance if I wanted to replace the noisy drive?
My use for the drive would be to store all my media and the drive would be used frequently as I stream my media to my PS3.
Any good brands to use?
Thanks in advance
