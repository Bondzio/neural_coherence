So when the user logs into different computers I do not have to keep adding the printer for the current user. I hope I made myself clear... Thank you for

Sadly I can't condense it to fit in this small box so here's the fine books on Windows Server Administration. http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596008000/

Also do I need to purchase all six books or could you make a suggestion? Sorry to bother you with such trivial questions I am new to all of this and learning as I go. It can be very frustrating. We do not have the money to hire a real IT person. Thanks again for your time and assistance

Let's try a google. http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=site%3Awww.microsoft.com+%22windows+2000%22+administration&btnG=Google+Search&aq=f&oq= This is where your courses in Windows Server Administration pay off. Or you can keep google handy and see if anyone was able to condense what you need to know in a small paragraph. Bob
