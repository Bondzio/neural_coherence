You're looking at a wide range of PCs including media center PCs.
You should decide the top 3 things you want your PC to do, then pick a PC that's good at those things.
For instance, don't spend the extra cash on a media center PC unless you want it to be your media center and you'll be watching TV/movies, timeshifting TV, recording TV/DVDs, and listening to music on it all the time.
A regular PC can do these things with a few upgrades, but if you want to put a PC in your living room to do these things often, then get a media center PC.
If your top 3 things you want to do are &quot;play the sims&quot;, &quot;surf the web&quot;, and &quot;download music&quot;, then just get an inexpensive PC.
If you're top three things are &quot;play battlefield2&quot;, &quot;convert DVDs to DivX&quot;, and &quot;edit videos&quot;, then get a PC with an AMD X2 or P4-D and a fat video card like an ati X1800 or geforced 7800.
