<s> Hey guys, I need help deciding on a new video card for my computer. </s>
<s> I have a P4 2.8 gh, 1 gb RAM, and a FX 5700 LE 128MB video card. </s>
<s> I might need to upgrade my power supply to accomidate the new card. </s>
<s> I do not know the wattage rating of it. </s>
<s> I have a AGP slot. </s>
<s> My current choices are: A Diablotek GeForce 6600 LE/256MB DDR for $95 from Tiger Direct, a Diamond Radeon X1300 / 512MB DDR2 for $130 also from Tiger Direct, and these Newegg cards: An Apollo 6800 Geforce 6800 128MB 256-bit DDR for $130, an ASUS 512MB Geforce 6800 128-bit GDDR2 for $180, A BFG Tech Geforce 6800GS 256MB 256-bit GDDR3 for $200, A DIAMOND Radeon X1300 512MB 128-bit GDDR2 for $114, A eVGA Geforce 6600 256MB 128-bit DDR for $100, eVGA Geforce 7800GS CO 256MB 256-bit GDDR3 for $270, and a PNY Geforce 6600 256MB 128-bit DDR for $112. </s>
<s> I would prefer to stay below $200, around $150ish. </s>
<s> I want to be able to play Oblivion at decent settings on a 17&quot; moniter, and some other games like it. </s>
<s> Any other video cards that I have not listed here that you recomend would be fine as well. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> If I had the funds to upgrade my (motherboard, CPU, Memory, Vidoe card PCI Xpress) I would have but I plan to do that the end off the year. </s>
<s> I got the BFG 256 6800 GT AGP in January, which replaced the XFX 256 5700 LE. </s>
<s> A week or two latter the 7800 AGP cards came out. </s>
<s> I am not planning to upgrade the video card any more. </s>
<s> as far as my mobo is concerned it is maxed with the bigest Socket A CPU AMD XP 3200 you can put in it & 2 gigs of PC3200 memory duel channel. </s>
<s> Power Supply Thermaltake 680. </s>
<s> Get a bigger power supply. </s>
<s> I would say get one of the 7800 AGP cards. </s>
<s> the specs on them are realy nice. </s>
<s> (That is just my opion) Good Luck: Wendell H </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814131010 7800GS is a ripoff because AGP is dead. </s>
<s> I do not know much about ATI, so can you clear something up? </s>
<s> What is the difference between the ATI cards: the X 800, the X 1300, and the X 1600? </s>
<s> Hope you can help me with this. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> watch out for tigerdirect.com rebates. </s>
<s> you will NOT get you money. </s>
<s> I know that most people with newer computers have the ability to use the PCI-e cards, but for those of us with older, can't afford either new computer or new mobo/chip and have the AGP slot, there is still a market. </s>
<s> It may be smaller, but it exists. </s>
<s> My older Althon XP 1800+ uses AGP. </s>
<s> Do I want to upgrade my mobo, etc.? </s>
<s> You bet. </s>
<s> Can I afford to upgrade? </s>
<s> No way, not this year at least. </s>
<s> I recently bought from newegg an eVGA FX5500 256mb 128-bit AGP card for under $50. </s>
<s> Notwithstanding that I am having weird problems with errors and freezes (could be the driver? </s>
<s> ), I'm getting a beautiful clear screen for general use. </s>
<s> I have the same FX5500 video card, and I like it. </s>
<s> (I'm not a gamer.) </s>
<s> In general, it's not that one shouln't get an AGP card for an older system. </s>
<s> It's that investing so much (about $300 for the 7800GS) on an AGP video card is not advisable. </s>
<s> If you get a new system, which gamers tend to do more frequently than gereral purpose users, then you can't transfer your $300 investment to the new computer's PCI-Express X16 slot. </s>
<s> IMO, a big waste of money. </s>
<s> I understand your point about upgrading AGP is a waste of money. </s>
<s> My system has been glitching a lot, and I am thinking of getting a new one. </s>
<s> That way, I won't have to waste that money that would go toword a new system. </s>
<s> Thanks for the advice! </s>
<s> ...you can get a new PCIe motherboard and a pretty decent PCIe card. </s>
