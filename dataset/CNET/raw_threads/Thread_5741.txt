Please be patient and I will reconnect it to a monitor so I can get the model #. This machine is 6yrs old and it is a power spec with xp operating system. It has been a great system up until now. Everthing else works fine except the usb ports. I just went and bought another tower its a dell with windows 7 os. I would still like to be able to transfer files through the usb ports if at all possible. Is this something I can fix or is this computer junk? Thanks Troy
