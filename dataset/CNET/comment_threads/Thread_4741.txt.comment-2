That is VERY VERY ODD!
The last time we encountered such a thing... 1.
The case was far too hot.
It was cooking the drives.
2.
The power supply was fair too out of spec.
I've used from 9 dollar to 30 dollar CDRW drives for years now and they do very well.
At this price I'm very happy as they go past 2 years old.
My thought here is that something else is wrong.
