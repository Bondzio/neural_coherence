<s> I am building a new PC with two CD drives using one from an older PC and a brandy new CD/DVD with all the fancy bells and whistles. </s>
<s> They both play music CD's with the audio coming out on the Wave channel level control but neither one on the CD channel control. </s>
<s> I checked the input pins on the mother board by injecting audio on both left/right inputs and they work OK. Also used a signal tracer to listen for signals on the CD output cable pins with dead silence. </s>
<s> What am I missing? </s>
<s> Is there a software switch to control the analog output from the CD's? </s>
<s> All software switches are unmuted. </s>
<s> 2.4 ghz. </s>

<s> Never experienced this in the many PC's I have built.. </s>
<s> Thanks for any suggestions or leads... BigBill </s>
