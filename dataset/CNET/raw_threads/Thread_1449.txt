12570	0	275667	2653228	NR	robalan88	12/13/07 11:05 AM	1.1975439E12	Need help to setup a new home network for my TV, Xbox 360...	I need suggestions and recommendation on what type of equipment and make/model numbers of what works well. I want to set up a hime network for the following: Toshiba 42LX177 HDTV (built in RJ45 port) XBox 360 Directv HR20 HD-DVR HP Laptop with MS Vista & Intel 4965AGN Network & Bluetooth enabled Canon Pixma MP610 Printer Sirius Stiletto 100 Portable Sateliite Radio Player I do not have any service yet, but will be signing up for my local DSL service real soon. The TV, Xbox 360, and DVR are all in the same entertainment center. I don't mind having the DSL modem right there too when I get it, so everything could be hardwired to a router and then to the DSL modem. However, I want the freedom to have wifi for the laptop so I can be in various rooms in my house to surf the web, etc... and to use my Stiletto 100 in wifi mode to listen to Sirius radio over the internet. Also, I want the freedom of not having to connect the printer to the laptop directly. I could use Bluetooth between the printer and laptop but I hear that Bluetooth is not as good as wifi because of range and speed issues. What router(s) and other pieces of equipment do I need for my configuration. Thanks
