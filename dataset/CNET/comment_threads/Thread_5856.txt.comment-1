I have XP Pro, Pent 4, 3.2 ghz, 1 gig RAM.
I just took the plunge and finally bought the Maxtor One Touch II external hard drive for backup.
It comes with Dantz Retrospect Express HD.
I have been wondering if I should use Acronis instead.
(I have not ordered Acronis, just heard great things about it.
I think it does more, but not sure what.)
Can anyone summarize the difference for me?
Thanks in advance.
