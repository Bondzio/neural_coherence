i am trying to build a computer for the first time and i am confused about the jumper config on my intel d865perl mobo.
in order to route speaker to back panel the manual says to place jumpers in 3 locations.
i also need to place jumpers on 2 locations for my bios.
my board came with 3 little blue plastic things already placed on some of these locations (not the correct ones according to the manual).
my problem is that i have removed them and i forgot how they were installed.
on one side of the plastic thing is 2 holes and on the other is 3 holes.
it seems to fit both ways.
which way is correct?
also, the board only came with 3 and according to the manual i need 5. can someone please tell me if i am missing something here or where i can obtain more of these little plastic things.
thank you in advance.
mike
