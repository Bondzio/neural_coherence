I am running an HP JetDirect 170x with a HP DesignJet 500 connected to it via parallel port.
I am running a Windows Server 2003 server and Active Directory with over 100 computers running Windows XP Pro SP2.
Only one computer is able to print to this printer.
I have installed this printer on other computers with seemingly the same configuration; however I cannot get any of the other computers on the network to print to this printer.
From any computer on the network, I am able to ping this device and get a postive reply.
I am also able to telnet and access the web-based manager from any computer.
I have done everything I could think of to get this to work.
I even tried to install the DLC protocol on a computer, and nothing works.
I appreciate any ideas and help provided.
