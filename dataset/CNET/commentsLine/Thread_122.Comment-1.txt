i've had 3 different hp reps try to help.
many hours later, they sent me another printer.
same problem.
computer displays &quot;printing&quot;, printer displays &quot;printing&quot;, but nothing happens.
early on i was able to get one word doc to print but then it went back to the &quot;ghost&quot; printing or error.
i have uninstalled my other two printers and scanner so the hp can be the only one.
i've also tried installing the hp with the driver from their website.
still nothing.
the printer will print the demo page by depressing the button on the printer.
if i don't get a resolution by monday, i'll be returning both printers and find another brand of color laser jet printer.
any suggestions?
i need good color copies for pattern covers.
thanks.
