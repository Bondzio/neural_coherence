&quot;as far as customer service is concerned i did call them once when initially setting up the network.&quot; with my linksys, i've never once had to call for tech support.
even during setup.
d-link remids me of a d grade in school (which i never was subjected to).
why any fool with any compamy would chose a name thusly is beyond me.
all reading this all can make up their own mind as to which is best.
