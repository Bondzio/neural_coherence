Well I believe these are the programs I have.
Windows Media Player Windows DVD Maker Cyberlink DVD Suite Avega Media Centre Quicktime Muvee Nero 7 For audio I usually just use Windows Media Player and for DVD's I have been using Nero.
But whatever works best or if I need to download something else is just fine.
Thanks, Tom
