<s> If you need a half-way decent graphics card just go with the 7600GT. </s>
<s> It won't run games on their high settings, but it will work for basic uses and casual gaming. </s>
<s> I think u should go to newegg.com and get the X1900GT they have it for $300 but rightnow there is $100 rebate so u can get it for $200. </s>
<s> im thinking of getting it too. </s>
<s> On a bunch of tests the X1900GT even beat the 7900Gt would be allot better than the 7600GT http://www.tomshardware.com/2006/08/09/a_tale_of_two_gts/index.html check it out </s>
