I would like it to become the replacement for a worn out Emachines AT power supply. I can't seem to find the right cable or adapter I need. I did find an ATX to AT converter but it looked like the ATX side was male and I need it to be female. plz help. This plans to be my Linux learning tool

I did find an ATX to AT converter but it looked like the ATX side was male and I need it to be female. &quot; Upon double-checking I find the ATX side of such a cable would indeed have male electrical contacts. But now you write: &quot;Anything more? Like where I might find what I need? What the exact name is of what I need?&quot; This confuses me. Your first post stated you already found it? What changed?
