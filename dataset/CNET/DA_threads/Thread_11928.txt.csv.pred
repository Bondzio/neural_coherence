1.1.1	I am switching from a PC to a MAC and am somewhat unfamiliar with the inner workings of MACs .	St
1.1.2	I am going to order an iMac G5 ( 2.0 Ghz ) next week .	St
1.1.3	I intend on ordering 1Gig of RAM and was thinking of ordering a single one gig DIMM ( so I could upgrade later without wasting memory ) .	St
1.1.4	But I have seen some comments posted around the web arguing that the imac may run faster with matching pairs ( i.e .	St
1.1.5	2 512 MB memory sticks are better than one 1 Gb ) .	St
1.1.6	I was wondering what you guys , who are obviously more experienced with MACs that I , think .	St
1.1.7	Any thoughts .	Polite
1.1.8	Franklin	St
1.2.1	Apparently the iMac will perform a little better with matching pair of memory modules .	St
1.2.2	I doubt you will notice the difference in everyday use .	St
1.2.3	Get the Single 1Gb and later you will be able to get the second on and have a matching pair .	St
1.2.4	I do n't know what the Bench marks are for the different configurations but I 'm guessing that unless you are doing something really RAM intensive , it will not show .	St
1.2.5	Good luck P	Polite
1.3.1	Was the info you refer to on the web was recent ?	Ques
1.3.2	Old Macs often had to have memory in 'pairs ' , but not any more .	St
1.4.1	1 GB stick of RAM is better than 2 512MB .	St
1.4.2	Face it , would u like to search for a book in 2 bookshelves or one .	St
1.4.3	Same thing w/ RAM .	St
1.4.4	It 's faster to transfer data to 1 stick of RAM that 2 .	St
1.4.5	Data transfer through the North bridge will be faster w/ one stick than if u utilize 2 RAM sticks .	St
1.5.1	http : //docs.info.apple.com/article.html ? artnum=300082 Hope this is of some help .	St
1.5.2	Jay	St
1.6.1	I 'd get the single stick of 1G RAM because the difference in speed will be smaller than the difference in expense .	St
1.6.2	By that I 'm referring to the expense of losing two 512s to the stockpile or a reseller .	St
1.6.3	If you upgrade as you say you might later , that is .	St
1.6.4	If money is no object then get two 1G sticks .	St
1.6.5	Also , it 's nice to be able to squeeze the last bit of speed out of a computer when it 's older and the components cost less .	St
1.6.6	Just my 2 cents -- your universe may vary .	St
1.7.1	I too remember those days .	St
1.8.1	Thanks for the info Franklin	St
1.9.1	My universe tends to agree with you , but I remain confused as the apple web site , referenced by hjh above , recomends buting in matched pairs , I remain confused .	St
1.9.2	But I think I 'll go with the 1 gig DIMM and upgrade later .	St
1.9.3	Thanks to everyone .	St
1.9.4	Franklin	St
1.10.1	as I said in my first post , if you only have 1 X 1Gb Dimm installed , you will probably NOT notice any difference .	St
1.10.2	Installing matching pairs with only 1Gb of memory ( 2 X 512 ) means that you will have to replace BOTH the dimms , only two slots in the iMac , when you decide to upgrade your memory if you want to maintain the matching pair strategy .	St
1.10.3	Install 1 X 1Gb now , upgrade later , with another 1Gb , and you now have the matching pair that Apple recommends and will not have wasted any money .	St
1.10.4	P	St
1.11.1	I 'm pretty sure that Apple , the designer of the logic board , are correct when they say that there is a speed difference when using two like sized Memory Modules in their iMac .	St
1.11.2	Could it be that the memory data path is expanded when both slots are in use ?	Ques
1.11.3	P	St
1.12.1	I took your advise and just ordered it with a single 1 Gig DIMM .	St
1.12.2	Thanks for your help .	Polite
1.12.3	Franklin	St
