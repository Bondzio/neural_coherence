<s> I currently own an ATI All-in-Wonder 9600XT and I recently bought a Magnavox 51&quot; supposed &quot;HD&quot; but it only has YPbPr(RGB) and S-Video connectors. </s>
<s> Anyway, I hooked my PC to it with an S-Video cable but it's pretty blurry. </s>
<s> Video looks terrific but anything else in Windows is terrible. </s>
<s> Is there anything I can do to drastically improve quality? </s>
<s> Is there a software to increase the quality or will my quality increase at all if I connect through YPbPr? </s>
<s> if it will could you give me a link for a cheap yet good VGA &gt; YPbPR converter. </s>
<s> Thanks, Maynard </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I wish but no, that would make things a great deal easier. </s>
<s> Well I've found a few VGA &gt; RGB converters but I'm not too sure if that would resolve my issue. </s>
<s> If anyone has used these before and could give me some insight on them that would be great. </s>
<s> someone might be able to help there. </s>

<s> That helps quite a bit, doesn't answer the S-Video question but if it does not cover it I guess that means S-Video with not look good at all... oh well. </s>
<s> Thanks again, Maynard </s>
