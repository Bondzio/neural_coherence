I have a few questions regarding my build, can u guys please shed some light on my build? hopefully i'm heading on the right track Approximate Purchase Date: Next Week Budget Range:1800 just CPU (without monitor and other peripheral) System Usage from Most to Least Important: Gaming (BF4) and Movies Are you buying a monitor: Already own a QX2710 Parts to Upgrade: Everything Do you need to buy OS: No Preferred Website(s) for Parts: All US websites are ok. Location: City, State/Region, Country - Chicago, Illinois, USA Parts Preferences:Intel Overclocking: Yes (not confident with current skills) SLI or Crossfire: One GTX 780 (Future SLI with another 780) Your Monitor Resolution: 2560 X 1440P Additional Comments: I will game heavily on BF4, so this built has to run BF4 at high And Most Importantly, Why Are You Upgrading: I have a very old CPU I have a few question, since i am using a 1440p monitor, would a single 780 be sufficient to run BF4 at very high settings? Do i need to add more fans? It seems that the Bitfenix case is pretty good with airflow. Furthermore, im not sure if i should spend more money on mobos, should i look for an even cheaper mobo? Asus Maximus seems like an overkill, or am i missing something. Many people have suggested getting an i7 as future game might need an I7 haswell?

Let's look at a current Haswell for just under 1K -&gt; http://www.pcworld.com/article/2040319/build-the-ultimate-intel-haswell-pc-for-under-1000.html The 7790 looks to fair well against the 780. I have to step out but will get some benchmarks here later. Bob
11186	2	601347	5497718	5497672	joey19890	9/12/13 4:08 PM	1.37900208E12	cpu	I believe the i5-4670K delivers a better gaming performance. A few guys told me that it would be more worth it to get?
11186	3	601347	5497732	5497718	R. Proffitt	9/12/13 4:14 PM	1.37900244E12	Still the odd list.	Here's what I advise. Always copy someone else's design. At least I tried to save you from creating a new combo. Here's what I promised later. http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/gpu.php?gpu=Radeon+HD+7790 = 3050 http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/gpu.php?gpu=GeForce+GTX+780&id=2525 = 7864 Looks like you are going to very high end. Seems you'd want the i7 IMO. Sorry about not having the time to look over the video cards but I had to scoot. Bob

Proffitt	9/12/13 4:20 PM	1.3790028E12	Link about the 780.	http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107-6.html I rarely see folk pop for this class card and skimp on the CPU. Strange. http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gtx-780-performance-review,3516-6.html shows you get the 60+ FPS at 2560x1440 but I find folk rarely have that display. Many are running the usual 1080. Notice the rig they used to get that performance. http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gtx-780-performance-review,3516-5.html Bob
