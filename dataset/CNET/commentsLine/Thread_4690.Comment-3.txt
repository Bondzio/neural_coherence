linkit is trying to help me but i have been trying now since christmas and have come to a dead end .
i will watch with interest to see if you crack it because i can't keep asking linkit and others to help when they must be sick of me.
truthfully i haven't even been to bed for the last 3 nights where i keep trying various things but nothing arghhhhhhhhhhh.
it seems ott not going to bed but i can't stand it if something is wrong and pc world don't even answer my requests for help
