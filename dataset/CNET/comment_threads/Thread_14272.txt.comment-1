I'm running a windows 98 on my home pc , and windows XP on the laptop.
Now I'm seeing all these new flash drives with enchanced Windows Vista ready boost.
My question is, do I really need a flash drive with this feature, or should I just get a regular normal flash drive without this feature and the useless U3 feature as well.
Also I know the U3 feature can be taken out, but can the ready boost feature be taken out as well?
I'm concerned if it will take up space for something that I won't use.
Thanks very much :]
