would you run out in the road naked waiting for your clothes to dry on the line or in the dryer (for all you yuppie/x'ers out there)?
why would you want to wait for your windows machine to boot from a cold start?
going out in the nude has got to be more fun!
i've only cut off the computer (since 1985) i use when on vacations extending over 2 days, really bad lightning storms in this southern town that are close, and whenever windows takes a mind to just quit working.
in all these years, i've had one catastrophic failure (a regulator on a motherboard fried, and took the cpu with it).
that after 4 years of good service (amd k6-2/550 cpu and ecs mb ((last ecs i'll ever have))).
all other problems (cooling fans only) have been detected through smell and good hardware/software compatibility and selection.
i repair computers of all makes and models, sizes and descriptions.
most of these repairs are due to spiking of power by using the surge protector to turn the machines on and off, or the wear out of the actual on/off buttons for the power supplies themselves, or lightning going in to the mb via modems.
the spiking problems are inherent in hard drive failures, ram quirks all of a sudden, or power supplies fan failures (usually just the fan itself).
don't you all know that electrical spikes at start up cause more damage than just continually powered up equipment?
come on - get a life -spend your children's inheritance on the power company - you do own stock in it, i'm sure!
be a good shareholder and invest in this most necessary of everyday conveniences.
or just go out and be the cavegirl/boy and stick your head in the sand.
