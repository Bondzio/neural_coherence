<s> I've been shopping around for a gaming machine for a few weeks now and I've almost settled on Digital Storm to build my first true gaming rig however the more I look at the benefits of building my own PC the more tempting it becomes. </s>
<s> There's a few things holding me back, among them are how to troubleshoot? </s>
<s> How to avoid compatability issues. </s>
<s> Fear factor (BIOS scares me a little). </s>
<s> No tech support. </s>
<s> Did I spend my money in the right places? </s>
<s> I have a budget of $2000-$2500 for this so I know the savings of building my own will be very significant however that warm fuzzy feeling of warranties and tech support will be gone. </s>
<s> I do like that I'll be getting educated as I go but fear the pain and frustration that education may cause (not to mention money) so I guess after all my rambling my question is...Will that education, pain and suffering (assuming Murphy's law is in full effect) end up as a rewarding and satisfactory experience or should I play it safe? </s>
<s> Yeah, get some good education, you won't regret it. </s>
<s> I've built three computers and when/if something goes wrong with them, I enjoy fixing the problem (because I know what is in the computer and how it is put together); and I've had absolutely zero regrets about building my own computer, I'll NEVER go back to a pre-built piece of crap. </s>
<s> You just can't get past the quality of a homemade machine (so to speak). </s>
<s> With warranties and stuff wherever you buy your components, it should come with its own warranty; and you're your own tech support. </s>
<s> I purchase my components at http://www.newegg.com . </s>
<s> P.S. </s>
<s> Don't worry about BIOS', because you just shouldn't upgrade BIOS', you'll have to build a whole new computer before you'll want to do that. </s>
<s> Build it, you won't regeret it. </s>
<s> For 2k you can build a pretty decent system and then you KNOW what you have. </s>
<s> It is not hard to do, by the time you get done you will be surprised at the result. </s>
<s> For 2k (or less) you can build a slick system, far superior to what you can buy retail, unless you spend a ton of money and go to Alienware. </s>
<s> Just do it, you will have fun!!! </s>
<s> Good luck!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> http://www.anandtech.com/guides/showdoc.aspx?i=3497&p=5 btw, $2000 builds a high-end pc... you can have a great gamer for far less. </s>
<s> you could build a core i7, but i wouldn't recommend it for a first-time builder since the mobos are still a bit finicky. </s>
