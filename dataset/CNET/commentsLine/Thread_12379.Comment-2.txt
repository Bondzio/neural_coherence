most will have to find an older computer to scan with and network it over to the newer machines.
the pair of network cards and cable to do this is abotu 20 dollars at places like fry's.
othere will scream at the cost of the scsi card kits and then will get &quot;really mad&quot; when they learn that the scanner is not supported on the new os or find another problem.
i've learned to never help a person move a scsi scanner to another machine.
while that sounds mean, it's better to have the person mad at hp or someone else.
i hope you understand this issue.
