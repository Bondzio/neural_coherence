<s> HI I have a Dell Dimension 5100 - purchaced 2 years ago. </s>
<s> I also use Norton, AdAware SE, Spybot, C-Cleaner and Windows Defender. </s>
<s> I run regular Defrags and regular Internet history and temp files deletions. </s>
<s> YET my compuet is getting slower, especially when on the internet. </s>
<s> Is there anything that anyone can suggest? </s>
<s> As the disk fills the zones get progressively slower. </s>
<s> That's not a bug. </s>
<s> Also as updates come out Microsoft's patches seem to go slower and slower since it's not a priority OS for them. </s>
<s> You also have Norton... </s>
<s> I'd uninstall any software you haven't run in a year to start with. </s>
