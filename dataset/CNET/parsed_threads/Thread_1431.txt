<s> Hello, I wonder if anyone can help me with this. </s>
<s> I have an old Dell Optiplex 170L (Service TAG DMZ491J) on which I've just reinstalled windows XP on. </s>
<s> I would also like to upgarde the processor on it as at the moment its only a Celeron 2.6. </s>
<s> I have done a little research but just need someone elses experienced confirmation. </s>
<s> I have found one of these for sale: http://www.cpu-world.com/sspec/SL/SL7B8.html I think that will work according to dells web site. </s>
<s> http://en.community.dell.com/what-do-i-buy/f/3510/t/18868551.aspx I also would need a little advice on the memory as I'm sure I'll need to change it. </s>
<s> Currently it is running PC2700U-25330 333MHz CL2.5. </s>
<s> What would I need to change the memory to? </s>
<s> Thankyou for your assistance </s>
<s> Why are you sure you have to change it? </s>
<s> I'm sure there is no need for that. </s>
<s> Anyway, http://www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx?model=OptiPlex%20170L%20Series&Cat=RAM shows the options. </s>

<s> The best place for memory info is http://www.crucial.com . </s>
<s> It will analyze your computer and give you some options. </s>
<s> You don't have to buy from them, but you can if you wish. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> That cpu seems to be supported. </s>
<s> I don't think you need to change the ram to get that cpu to fly. </s>
<s> If it was me. </s>
<s> I'd get the latest bios installed and test. </s>
<s> If all ok. </s>
<s> Fit in the new cpu and test. </s>
<s> If all ok. Get some benchmark numbers. </s>
<s> If I had some extra bucks I might go here. </s>
