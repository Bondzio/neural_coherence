my idea for your situation is pretty close to the others.
buy a usb 2.0 expansion card very inexpensive and easy to install with xp, just carefully plug it into an open pci slot.
then get an external hard drive 120 gig should do and this is the low end of the price spectrum right now and you will not have to worry about possible bios limitations.
move as many user created files as you can to this to free up more space on your c: drive give it some more breathing room.
then you have a great external backup drive for a new system down the road a few years and a very easy way to transfer files to a new machine later on too.
