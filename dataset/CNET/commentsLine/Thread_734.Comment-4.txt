i still can't explain what the solution is but the computer seems to be working again.
i started by unplugging all but the primary hard drive (i have 3 sata drives hooked up to the mobo - a primary/software/boot drive, a data drive, and a backup drive).
with only that drive connected everything worked/booted fine.
so then i added the backup drive and that worked fine as well.
the i added the data drive and i got a &quot;reboot with primary boot drive...&quot; message after the flash screen.
i unplugged it again and everything is fine.
then i start swapping cables to see if the and sata or psu cables were bad.
nope, each worked individually on the boot drive.
the weird part was when i started adding the other drives there was no clear consistency.
sometimes a drive would work in one configuration (mix and match cables, change mobo slots) and sometimes it wouldn't.
but in the end i found a new combination of drive/mobo slot order and cable hookup that seems to be working.
i still can't figure out why this originally happened while i was in the middle of using the computer.
no software/hardware changes were happening, it wasn't during startup, i was just playing a music project file.
anyway, the problem isn't happening (can't say it is 'solved') so hopefully that will end this thread.
thanks
