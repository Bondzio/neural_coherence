I was naive in thinking my new computer would come with a firewire port - it didn't.
I also was unaware that even with a firewire port, I would need digital video, not analog.
SO, my question is, without replacing what I consider to be a very good graphics card, are there any good dedicated video capture cards out there that can stream analog video from a VCR or Analog video camera to my computer?
I need the best quality I can get on a budget (less than $100 preferred), because I already spent a load on the system I bought!
I look at ratings on Amazon and epinions, but most budget cards don't seem to rate that high.
I would like to preserve my home videos in the best quality I can afford.
Any suggestions?
TIA!
