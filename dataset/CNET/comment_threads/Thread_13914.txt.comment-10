the 6800 has 256 bit way better....and 12 pipelines way better....big boost in performance..... also 256mb is not really required in most games...but some new games do take 256mb if u put like all settings to high and anti aliasing and all on i would go with the 6800. even though the 6600gt has faster core clock, the pipelines and memory interface makes up the difference
