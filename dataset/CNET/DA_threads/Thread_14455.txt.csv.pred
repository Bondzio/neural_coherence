1.1.2	When I turn it on hard drive access light stays on , power supply fan runs , small fan on heatsink does not , ( will turn freeley by hand . )	St
1.1.3	I liked my old emach , so I purchased a new one model T5010 .	St
1.1.4	I do not want to donate or give my old one away as it has a lot of personal info on hard drive .	St
1.1.5	I can not transfer the info to my new one as it has a sticker on the cover that if broken voids the warranty .	St
1.1.6	Should I take the hard drive , cd , and two 256 merory sticks out and throw the rest in the trash .	St

1.2.1	All you have to do is take out the hdd of the old computer , and use a kit to make it a usb hdd case .	St
1.2.2	http : //www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp ? skuId=6991605 & type=product & id=1099392683637 After you transfer your important files , I 'd format it and use it as a back up drive , or wipe it with any free programs ( like bcwipe ) and dispose of it .	St
1.3.1	I have an old system with spyware , but I still want to use it .	St
1.3.2	You can take the memory and add it to your surrent computer ( given it 's the right format ) , you can build a totally new machine with your parts .	St
1.3.3	Get a new motherboard , a new case , and use the parts in your dead emach like hdd , memory , optical drive , and before you know it , you have a brand new computer .	St
1.4.1	What everyone forgot to mention here was the fact that emachies has a shutdown temp control in the bios and if your cpu gets to hot , it wo n't boot or function .	St
1.4.2	Replace the cpu fan for fifteen\twenty bucks , it will recognize the fan is going , temp down and it may run again .	St
1.4.3	I own one so I know , replaced my fan , had SAME problem .	St
1.4.4	There is a chance the cpu is dead but I would try it .	St
