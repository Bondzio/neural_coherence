<s> However I'm able to read DVD disks without any problems. </s>
<s> Would someone please help me find out why I'm not able to burn DVDs from this drive? </s>
<s> You need a DVD burning program to do this. </s>
<s> What DVD burning software have you tried? </s>
<s> Hi Linkit, I have tried to installed Nero Express 6, but that did not install. </s>
<s> The drive came bundle with the Nero CD software. </s>
<s> But I have not be successful installing any of the software it came with. </s>
<s> What is the best software to use for burning DVDs? </s>
<s> Nero burning programs are pretty good. </s>
<s> What problem do you have with installing it? </s>
<s> What version of Nero is it supposed to be? </s>
<s> What type of DVD discs are you trying to burn? </s>
<s> What max speed are the discs? </s>
<s> Here is a good free program to try until you get Nero working: http://www.download.com/CDBurnerXP-Pro/3000-2646_4-10409087.html?tag=lst-0-1 I usually use Nero Ultra and CDBurnerXP Pro. </s>
<s> Also, there is a firmware update for that drive: http://www.liteonit.com/ODD/English/e_downloads/e_firmware_dvd%20rw.asp </s>
<s> Thanks linkit, I really appreciate your help. </s>
<s> Sorry for responding so late. </s>
<s> When I tried to installe Nero Express 6, the software wants to installed the previous version I have installed which is version 4. </s>
<s> I'm afraid if I uninstall the older version, my CD burner may not work anymore. </s>
<s> SO I did not want to take that chance untill I was sure it all would ok. </s>
<s> I'm using ''Tevion'' disks...and a generic brand from Germany. </s>
<s> Max speed is 8x. </s>
<s> I will try one of these two programs suggested and I will report back to you as to how things are going. </s>
<s> Thanks G </s>
<s> CDBurnerXP Pro is free. </s>
<s> Nero Ultra is expensive. </s>
<s> I'd try the free software first. </s>
<s> install the newer v. until you ditch the old v.. </s>
<s> If nero came with that burner, it is tied to that burner and will only work with said burner. </s>
<s> Hello guys, I downloaded CDBurnerXP and installed...now the burner is working just fine. </s>
<s> Thanks linkit for the help..much appreciated. </s>
<s> CDBurnerXP I will be using it for a while. </s>
<s> He introduced CDBurnerXP to me. </s>
<s> I like it, too. </s>
<s> That program is a winner. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks Oil_Tan for your help. </s>
<s> But the DVD burner is working like a charm... </s>
<s> Yeah CDBurnerXP is nice and it's free. </s>
<s> The burner is working fine. </s>
