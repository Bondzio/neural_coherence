<s> Lately my home-built computer has been making a strange popping sound after it is turned off. </s>
<s> Specifically, the computer's hard drives stop spinning, etc. </s>
<s> and only the fans are running, which it typically does for about 10-seconds. </s>
<s> Once the fans stop running the computer makes a popping sound which is heard through the speakers, while the power light on the computer's front panel briefly glows at the same time. </s>
<s> The popping sound continues with a brief delay between each. </s>
<s> The popping sound also diminishes in volume as does the brightness of the power light. </s>
<s> The continually diminishing popping sounds (and light) continues for about 10-seconds. </s>
<s> I have noticed absolutely no other odd behaviour by my computer, including any other strange noises. </s>
<s> Regarding the computer itself: home-built with XP Pro (all current updates), 1GB Corsar RAM, 2 Western Digital hard drives, ATI All-in-Wonder video card, Antec case and 450-Watt power supply, Asus motherboard and Pentium 4 2.4GHz chip over-clocked 5% through a BIOS setting. </s>
<s> I suspect the issue is the power supply as the sound only occurs after everything else has shut down. </s>
<s> Any thoughts will be appreciated. </s>
<s> &quot;Once the fans stop running the computer makes a popping sound which is heard through the speakers&quot; This annoyance is not just your PC. </s>
<s> I've seen and heard this on dozens of machines. </s>
<s> Sadly it's not a defect but a sign of poor design of the audio system on that board (mother or whichever.) </s>
<s> I have fixed it in the past by disabling the onboard sound and using (my choice of) Creative Labs sound cards. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You are correct that I use the on-board audio and not a separate audio card. </s>
<s> Is it common for a problem such as this to crop up after three years of use; out of the blue, so to speak? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> R. Proffitt, moderator extraordinaire, thank you. </s>
<s> I was going to try swapping for another power supply, but I think I will try buying a sound card and installing it. </s>
<s> Hopefully you are very much right and this will solve matters. </s>
<s> Thanks for the advice! </s>
<s> My 10 year old home built recently developed the same issue, but with a couple different twists. </s>
<s> Since I didn't see a post from forkboy whether the sound card solution worked, I'm reposting the issue. </s>
<s> Like forkboy, the popping noise begins after everything else has shut down and gradually diminishes and stops after a half minute or so. </s>
<s> Now however, the noise can begin a random even several hours after shut down and it is continual. </s>
<s> I have to shut down power to the computer for it to stop. </s>
<s> When I opened the case, I noticed the 4 fans inside (2 case fans, power supply, and cpu)would jerk slightly along with the popping noise. </s>
<s> Then my plan was to systematically disconnect peripherals to see if any were the cause of the issue. </s>
<s> The first cord disconnected was the keyboard, and the popping stopped. </s>
<s> I plug it back in, and it started again. </s>
<s> Is it possible the keyboard is causing the problem? </s>
<s> Granted it's an ancient PS/2 keyboard, so upgrading wouldn't be a bad thing. </s>
<s> Are you in a standard outlet, UPS or using some surge protector? </s>
<s> As well, is this coming through your speakers and is their power applied to them with the PC off? </s>
<s> It sounds like the PS is responding to some transient and wanting to start. </s>
<s> This could have internal or external causes. </s>
<s> I'd make sure the speaker system is turned off and see if you can tell if the fans still jerk. </s>
<s> Work with the AC outlet configuration if you can as well. </s>
<s> I also have to wonder about stored voltages in the PC's capacitors that aren't bleeding off properly. </s>
<s> Sounds like a good one. </s>
<s> But after too many cures over the years I continue to use the card since to replace the motherboard for this fault is more expensive. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It's all plugged into a Belkin surge protector, which is connected to a standard outlet. </s>
<s> The speakers are not self-powered, but connected to the case via RCA jack. </s>
<s> If I disconnect the speakers, the fans still jerk, I just don't hear the popping. </s>
<s> I hooked up a USB keyboard and the noise and fan jerk were still there, though it seemed to lessen in duration. </s>
<s> Oddly, like the PS/2 keyboard, the noise stopped if I diconnected the keyboard. </s>
<s> No other USB connection seems to affect the noise. </s>
