<s> I was given a few computers that had been torn down for parts, but never really parted out (I received most of the parts). </s>
<s> I was able to resurect 2 of the 3 minus the hard drives. </s>
<s> One is a HP Pavilion 7920. </s>
<s> The power supply had been removed from the case. </s>
<s> That is where my question comes in. </s>
<s> There is one connection off the power supply that I haven't seen before. </s>
<s> It is similar to a floppy connector design style, but it is a little smaller. </s>
<s> It only has 3 wires (1 green and 2 black). </s>
<s> There is a connection on the motherboard that fits this connector. </s>
<s> The motherboard states PS_FAN at this connection. </s>
<s> Someone mentioned this could be a lead to monitor the PS fan (but they also mentioned different colors for the wires). </s>
<s> I'm wondering if the lead out of the ps should be hooked to this connection? </s>
<s> Here is a snapshot of the motherboard (scroll down). </s>
<s> http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/genericDocument?cc=us&docname=bph07170&lc=en&jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN The MB connector I am referring to is #21 on this page. </s>
<s> I contacted HP via email and they were of absolutely no help - they routed me to a generic PC building site, and then general instruction on a power supply replacement - nothing specific to the 3 pronged wire and receptor, which is where my question lies. </s>
<s> I thought the lead out of the p/s had something written on it, but I don't have it in front of me at the minute. </s>
<s> I'll try to post an update tonight. </s>
<s> Any help appreciated! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> That connector is for board control of the power supply fan. </s>
<s> IF ou are using the original motherboard and original P/s then attach it. </s>
<s> If it is a different motherboard, you don't need to use it. </s>
<s> If you buy a new replacment power supply it will not come with that connector. </s>

<s> Hello I have an hp7920 and the three wires are connected. </s>
<s> anyone know why mine is shutting off when my wife runs the vacume cleaner is it a bad power supply or a power problem in my house. </s>
