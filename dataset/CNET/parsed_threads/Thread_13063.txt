<s> How can i have a smoothly transition from wireless network to Cellular network? </s>
<s> The following always happens with any cellular enabled device. </s>
<s> - Wireless Device (Tablet, cell phone, etc.) </s>
<s> functions properly on wireless router. </s>
<s> - Walk around with it and wireless signal gets weak. </s>
<s> - Device slows down and experiences lost network packets. </s>
<s> - After moving far enough away from wireless router, device will finally connect to cellular internet (3G / 4G) Problem is extremely bad when I get in my car, because wireless device barely has a signal from the router and I get almost no internet connection. </s>
<s> I have to manually turn off Wifi to get the internet working properly. </s>
<s> To fix this we'll have to create an entirely new communication system. </s>
<s> As it stands you see how the current systems work. </s>
<s> To really fix this we'll have to have 2 radios or more and an entire rewrite done of how IP works. </s>
<s> For now I hope you have your basic grasp of how the IP stack works and we can't leave an open TCP/IP connection and move it from one interface to another. </s>
<s> And your apps will need a complete overhaul as well. </s>
<s> That is, if my app could buffer more than the transition could be less apparent to the user. </s>
<s> In fact, that's how it seems on the Kindle Fire HD if I can mark a video for play later. </s>
<s> It's buffer is huge. </s>

<s> An iPad will sit on a wireless router with 1 bar of connection, slow as molasses. </s>
<s> Why can't it just connect to 4G cellular internet. </s>
<s> This is the same for every device. </s>
<s> What is the excuse that it doesn't even try to connect to an internet that will work better? </s>
<s> If you look back at the days before IP networking became the accepted norm, you found all networking was proprietary. </s>
<s> You had Microsoft, 3Com, Novell, Sun and about a dozen others so when TCP/IP or Internet Protocal went public it looked to be a front runner and here we are. </s>
<s> I can't duplicate the history here. </s>
<s> So why are we here? </s>
<s> Dough, clams, moola, greenbacks, etc. </s>
<s> The other reason it can't just connect is the code behind it all doesn't do that. </s>
