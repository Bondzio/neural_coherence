1.3.1	7900gs is the fastest card on your list .	St
1.4.1	If you 're getting the GeForce 8600GTS get the factory overclocked ones .	St
1.4.2	They have more performance .	St
1.4.3	{ RHWW } DMan	St
1.5.1	I know exactly what you mean , I 've been researching for the last couple of weeks myself .	St
1.5.2	I 've finally settled on the 7600GT .	St
1.5.3	Its reasonably priced , and it gets over the top reviews on tigerdirect.com .	St
1.6.1	Read http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-7591_102-0.html ? forumID=26 & threadID=250498 & messageID=2503641 # 2503641 and see if you find a better one .	St

1.7.1	The 7600 cards are good cards and have gotten good reviews , but if you buy the 7600 expecting to be able to play games like Oblivion and Dark Messiah at high ( or even mid-high ) settings at a reasonable frame rate , you 're going to be dissapointed .	St
1.7.2	It just does n't have the horsepower .	St
1.7.3	If you 're willing to stretch your budget a few bucks you should be able to snag a 7900 based card at around $ 160 which will get you a pretty good jump in performance .	St
1.7.4	The second thing ... why do n't you want an ATI ?	Ques
1.7.5	Their last generation of cards were great performers and you can get them now for very reasonable prices .	St
1.7.6	The 1950pro cards provide a great bang for the buck and you should be able to get them cheaper than the Nvidia 7900 cards .	St
1.8.1	The last time a bought an ATI i was greatly dissapointed ... it was partially my fault for picking the card i did but the customer support did not let me return the card even though i never put the card in my system ... so ya i guess i could give ATI another try ; what ATI cards do u recommend under my cirustances ( budget and PCI-e ) ?
