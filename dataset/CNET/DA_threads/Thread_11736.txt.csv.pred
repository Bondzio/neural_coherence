1.1.1	Hello, I would like to buy a Dell Ultrasharp 1905FP 19&quot; TFT monitor, but unfortunately my video card is an old NVidia GeForce2 MX 400 which doesn't have a DVI connector.	St
1.1.2	Has anyone tested these two together?	St
1.1.3	How is the image and text quality like when the monitor is connected via the analog input?	St

1.2.2	Dell Dimension 8100 series, pentium 4 1.5gHz 256mg pc800 rdram, running windows XP with same video card.	St
1.2.3	I would like the same question answered and if we need to upgrade the video card before getting the 19&quot; flat panel.	St
1.2.4	I am looking at the same flat panel also.	St
