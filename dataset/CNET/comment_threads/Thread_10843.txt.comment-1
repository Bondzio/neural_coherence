Hi, I have a Dell Dimension 4700 that has all stock parts and Windows Xp Home Edition 32Bit.
It is a mid tower case and I am looking to upgrade it as I want to play newer games without getting another computer.
I was wondering if someone could help me pick out certain parts for it that are both compatible with it and will fit in my case.
I am looking to upgrade the Power supply to at least 500 watts, get a new motherboard that supports intel core 2 duo, 4 expansion slots for memory and can support pci express x16 and 2.0.
Also I want to get a good cpu that can either be overclocked or that is good for gaming (Crysis).
I know im asking for a lot but i am new to the whole upgrading thing.
