no, the printer does not show up in printers.
yes, the usb plug works for other devices, my mp3 player is recognized and usable.
but the printer is not recognized when i plug it in to the usb.
i have removed and reinstalled the software but the program says it can't find the printer.
maybe my usb printer cable is bad.
just a guess, i'm not much of a geek.
