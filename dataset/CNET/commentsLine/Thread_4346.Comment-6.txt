i use a cd cleaning disk which will play an animated cartoon while cleaning.
that means its cleaning and reading the cartoon and supposely gives a &quot;thumbs-up&quot; in being readable.
its by alstop or allsop makers.
the price is less than $8us and available in most stores.
as for the cds themselves, use a cleaner for them as well.
greasy or sticky fingers can play havoc overtime so its worth it to get a device that cleans disks.
plus a can of air to blow out any dust as well.
*note* cd drives no matter what type will fail sooner or later, but a quality drive tends to last longer.
also, users using a dvd drive to read plain cds may find getting/replacing a std.
cd drive(read only) so when it fails the cost is cheaper to replace plus you keep the more expensive dvd or cd/rw drives for those tasks alone.
that's my 2-cents -----willy
