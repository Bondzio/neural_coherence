1.1.1	Anyone I am a very beginner.	St
1.1.2	This is the first time.	St
1.1.3	I am trying to install a 2nd drive with the old drive.	St
1.1.4	The old drive is a Western Digital, I think, a 5 pin jumper selection.	St
1.1.5	My new drive is Maxtor.	St
1.1.6	I've been trying to find out the jumper settings for the old drive.	St
1.1.7	There is one jumper on the old drive on 1-2 pins.	St
1.1.8	I want to set the old drive to CS, cable select.	St
1.1.9	I really don't wish take the old drive out if I don't have to.	St
1.1.10	All I have about the old drive is that it is 40GB, Ultra DMA HD, 5-pin, by Western Digital.	St
1.1.11	I don't understand much of the language or what they are talking about at Western Digital site.	St
1.1.12	Or anywhere else for that matter.	St
1.1.13	I would appreciate any help anyone has to offer.	Polite
1.1.14	thanks ron	Polite
1.2.1	And the drives should be set to all Cable Select which means the master and slave is determined by what connection you use.	St
1.2.2	FULL DETAILS about this at http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/ide/confCable80-c.html Bob	St
1.3.1	Thank you for your reply but I still don't know how to set the jumper setting on the old drive - Western Digital drive.	St
1.3.2	Maxtor did include the 80 conductor cable.	St
1.3.3	They did tell me to set both drives to CS/cable select.	St
1.3.4	But where is cable select?	St
1.3.5	Their drive has a 5-pin selection.	St
1.3.6	If I set to slave but I'm afraid of data loss, or whatever.	St
1.3.7	with much appreciation ron stebbins	St
1.4.1	Look either on the botom of the drive in line with the jumper pins or on a label attached to the HD.	St
1.4.2	Cable Selec is usually CSEL, but what ever they call it it will be apparent which you need.	St
1.4.3	Setting to wrong configuarion won't wipe your data, but drievs will not be recognized if nit set correctly.	St
