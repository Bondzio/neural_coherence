i have like 5 different drivers downloaded..but when i install one of them it still does the same thing.
i've tried everything.. uninstalling my s3pci card, taking it out and puting the gforce in and installing the driver in safe mode..but still when i boot in normal mode it freezes up on the load screen.. this was my first and last time buying an nvidia card..prolly just gonna scrap this one and go out and buy a ati card
