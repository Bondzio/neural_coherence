After changing the motherboard to a Compaq one [sorry, I don't know the model, but it came with 3.06 ghz P4 processor] Windows XP simply isn't recognising the internet connection anymore. When I try 'set up home or small ofice network', it announces that it couldn't find and network hardware. As I connected the network cable [ethernet] to one of motherboard's ports, I guess it's a problem with onboard netowrk card. Anybody has an idea what I should I do?
