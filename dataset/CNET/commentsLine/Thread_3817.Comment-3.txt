hey matt voodoodan from hp here.
if given the choice between running integrated graphics vs. pci-e graphics card, i will always go with the card.
the steps described above are correct; make sure you disable the integrated graphics in the bios, and uninstall the ati drivers.
you will also want to run a little program called driver cleaner pro, as ati and nvidia drivers don't always remove all of the files when you do an uninstall.
you can get it here:  i would actually recommend that you disable onboard in bios, uninstall the ati and the nvidia drivers, run driver cleaner pro, reboot, and do a fresh install on the nvidia drivers.
hope that helps.
let us know how it goes.
