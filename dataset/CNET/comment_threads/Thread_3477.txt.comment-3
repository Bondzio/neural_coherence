I was thinking around a total price tag of $1000-$1100, so the intel high performance gets close.
http://www.shopping.hp.com/webapp/shopping/cto/computer_customize_components.do I was really trying to ask if I should wait to get a quad core.
Will it be worth it?
Or do you think that average person/engineering student would really benefit that much from a quad core?
Also, why would you strongly recommend only 2gb ram?
I will probably just run vista home premium.
Thanks for the reply!
