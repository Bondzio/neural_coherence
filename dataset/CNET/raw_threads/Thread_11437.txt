The lan cable I have is too short to reach the dsl router that I have and was wondering if I could do one of two things and if I can how to do it. Maybe I can do neither but here is my thought. First way: I have a d-link model DI-524 so could I plug in the cable from my dsl modem to the d-link wan plug and then run a cable to the computer, or Second way: I have 2 built in lan ports on my Asus P6T-Deluxe so could I run a lan cable from the second lan port to the other computer. I have long enough cable to do either one of these, just don't know if it will work. Any help would be appreciated. I really don't want to string another cable through if I don' have to. Thanks Sean Hope this is clear and enough info.

If bridging between the ports on another computer is possible, so is getting the right length of cable. They aren't that expensive. While it's probably possible to bridge two Ethernet ports on one PC...and I've not done that...there is going to be a downside. Is a longer cable not an option?

The computers are on the same floor so easy to run a cable. The dsl modem is on a different floor and at the othe end of the house, running a cable would not be easy so I thought maybe with equipment I have I could cheat and make it easy. Oh well, just a thought. Thanks very much Sean

A router also offers another measure of security. Even if I had only one PC, it would connect to the modem through a router.
