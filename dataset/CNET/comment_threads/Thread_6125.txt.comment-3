Here's a reasonable explanation of how to do this on youtube.
I was in error stating that both wireless devices would need to be in bridge mode.
Only the remote device will.
But, once that device is in bridge mode, it will no longer provide a wireless signal to PCs.
You would need another AP connected to it or, if it had wired ports, use those.
Good luck.
