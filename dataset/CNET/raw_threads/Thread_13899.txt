I've had no problems for about 2 years until yesterday when an error message said &quot;Cable not connected&quot;. Same message on all 3. I checked all the cables and they worked fine when not using the router. I saw a reset button on the router, nothing. What should I look at now? A new router? I'm hoping someone has an idea. Thanks

You may have corrupted firmware, and newer may be available. Good luck, Click here to see the CNet faces, learn a little about internet connections and data, and download free software.
