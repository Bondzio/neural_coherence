1.1.1	I had to reset my Netgear Router .	St
1.1.2	Now the wireless is turned off .	St
1.1.3	I need to configure/setup the router without the internet .	St
1.1.4	The setup CD seems to require internet access .	St
1.1.5	Is there a way to connect my computer to the router without connecting to the internet ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks for any help !	St
1.2.1	Do n't get confused by the way you address a router -- the setup pages are in firmware in the router -- not on the internet .	St
1.2.2	Log in to your router via Internet Explorer ( or similar ) using its IP address -- usually 192.168.0.1 but see the manual for precise details of default IP address and Username Password for accessing interface pages .	St
1.3.1	I tried without the cd .	St
1.3.2	Default IP is 192.168.1.1 .	St
1.3.3	It said it could n't find that address .	St
1.3.4	I tried www.routerlogin.net .	St
1.3.5	Could n't find that either .	St
1.3.6	Thanks again .	St
1.4.1	Link up computer/router by ethernet cable .	St
1.4.2	Go Start , All Programs , Accessories , Command Prompt At the black and white screen type IPCONFIG /ALL this will show you the IP address of all connections including the gateway which whould be the address of the router .	St
1.4.3	Failing that you could press reset button on router to get it to revert to factory default IP address -- but this may default all other settings in the router too .	St
