<s> I would like to get hold of a Tape drive and software that will work with Windows XP sp3 to utilise these tapes for Back-up etc. </s>
<s> Can someone help please. </s>

<s> Don't bother with these tapes anymore. </s>

<s> or recover, I second Bob's motion. </s>

<s> Did you ever find out where to purchase a tape player and if it can be hooked up to WIndows XP? </s>
<s> I have tapes that I need to get data from and I'm not sure what to do. </s>
