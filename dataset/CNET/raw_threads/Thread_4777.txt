I have a second hand computer that has the following come up in the boot up: ''Serial Presence Detect (SPD) Device data missing or inconclusive''. This seems to be an intermittent problem as occasionally it boots up to Windows XP no problems. I had replaced the hard drive when it initially happened but is still occurring. I'm guessing it's a hardware problem as it seems to happen if the computer is moved or bumped. The computer has an Intel Inside Pentium III motherboard, 866 mhz and 256 mg ram. Could anyone please tell me where to check to see if I can fix this? Thanks. Lyn

If so, the connector for the SATA drives inside the case and at the back of the harddrive are notoriously loose to begin with and any bumping will dislodge it easily. Which means it will either not get the signal at all and make you think the drive is dead or it will intermittently get the signal so that it goes in and out. TONI

The chip has the data that tells the system what timing settings to use for the memory. If the SPD chip has gone bad, POSSIBLY, go into the BIOS and disable &quot;by SPD&quot; and use a conservative timing setting for CAS etc.

First off, try a different IDE cable, and make sure the jumpers on the hard drive are correctly set. Also, can you see the hard drive in the BIOS? Or is it not coming up at all?

It's all fixed now and seemed to be a couple of problems. Ram is changed, cable changed and has a different hard drive. Old cable didn't work with the new hard drive, new cable didn't work with old hard drive! I appreciate all the help.
