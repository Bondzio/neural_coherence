because i know you cannot accomplish this with just your router settings.
a bridge is an association between two components.
that's why i said you need cooperation from the ap.
the ap will connect multiple users to a wireless network but not bridge networks which is, essentially, what you're wanting to do.
you're right.
i don't know how to set up your router as a bridge.
what i'm saying is that it's not going to help do what you are trying to do.
if the ap has a bridge mode and you can change it as well, you've got a chance.
the little bit of wireless bridging i've done fixes the devices on their mac (hardware) addresses and uses authentication codes for security.
here's a link that might help.
sorry if i can't.
