<s> Hey, does anybody know why my new epower psu is making a wierd clicking noise? </s>
<s> heres the link. </s>

<s> Visiting the website you offered, a poster there made the point, it has loud operating fan, maybe too noisy. </s>
<s> If that's the case, the cause is the fan. </s>
<s> It can be unbalanced or simply too cheap of a fan installed. </s>
<s> However, smaller fans will be loud if they operate in high RPMs. </s>
<s> Better quality fans even if high RPMs are quieter and made from metal generally are noiseless if one can even find one nowadays. </s>
<s> -OR- the clicking noise is a poor component starting to breakdown but hasn't failed yet or even a dusty fan. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> yeah, the clicking noise sounds very electrical. </s>
<s> What do you think I should do? </s>
<s> It's brand new. </s>
<s> And it started doing the clicking noise about 5 minutes after I started the computer up. </s>
<s> Take a can of air or air hose and with no AC power applied, simply whirl the fan with the air. </s>
<s> If it makes the noise, then you have a bad fan. </s>
<s> If you recently got this new, then see what the warranty issues are, return it. </s>
<s> , etc.. </s>
<s> However, if the that poster is correct then I suspect that brand PSU model may have noisy fans and even the replacement one is going to be noisy. </s>
<s> So consider yet another in its place, providing you get credit, etc and buy a better PSU or just another brand of similar rating. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> ok, thanx </s>
