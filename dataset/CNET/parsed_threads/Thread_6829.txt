<s> I am using AMD K6 2/400 CPU P5 SS-ME mainboard, recently I bought a new 40 G harddisk try to replace with the defeat one ( which is only 6 G ) and it couldn't detact even if I put the jumper on Master or Slave, and it can be detacted only when I put the jumper in CS ( cable select ) , and the motherboard can only reconized it in &quot; Slave &quot; mode, The data cable was correct, jumper was correct, is it because it cannot detect more than 40 G since it was only AMD K6 ? </s>
<s> Is there anything I can do ? </s>
<s> You should be using an 80 conductor IDE cable which means CS is the right jumper. </s>
<s> Master is determined by what connector you plug it into. </s>

<s> You didn't mention if you replaced the C:drive or a secondary drive. </s>
<s> Assuming that you replaced the second drive.. </s>
<s> Check to see what the C: drive jumpers are set at. </s>
<s> Here is the proper way to set drives: If your C:(boot)drive is set at CS (cable select) then the second drive has to be set at CS also. </s>
<s> If the boot drive is set at Master then the second drive must be set as the Slave. </s>
<s> The Master drive should be plugged into the end connector of the data cable with the slave plugged into the middle cable. </s>
<s> Also, make sure no pins are bent and that the cable is properly seated to the drive. </s>
<s> good luck Jack </s>
