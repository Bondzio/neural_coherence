<s> Hi, I noticed that the LG x130 comes with a Hidden Partition that stores the backup-recovery for the netbook. </s>
<s> Is there any way to completely remove the hidden partition (or just disable the F11 option after the BIOS)? </s>
<s> I would like the extra space and removing that F11 function would really come in handy. </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> the partition or whatever you'd like to do with it. </s>
<s> 3rd party partition managers can do this or you can use something like ptedit or ptedit32 to make it visible and do as you with within Windows. </s>
<s> These are generally quite small so you don't gain much in the way of hard drive space. </s>
<s> I presume you already have your own fool proof backup method in place. </s>
<s> Would I be able to use PTEDIT32 under Windows 7? </s>
<s> I have a feeling that the F11 option after the BIOS loads directly from the hidden partition. </s>
<s> So removing the partition would mean removing the F11 option. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> Other comments are still welcome since I would rather not use 3rd party software to make this hidden partition visible. </s>
<s> I get an error trying to run ptedit32 (failed to start PowerQuest engine). </s>
<s> I've not tried from a DOS boot disk, however. </s>
<s> I know Acronis Disk Director works but that cost money. </s>
<s> As for the F11 option, I can't speak to that as it may come from the BIOS or some special boot loader. </s>
<s> Personally, I'd not worry about such a small loss of space but, if you want to try anyway, I'd make a full HD image including the recovery partition as well. </s>
<s> You could always wipe the drive and just restore the primary partition to the full size of the drive. </s>
<s> It would accomplish the same purpose. </s>
<s> I use CLONEZILLA to backup the entire image to a file on my USB external NTFS formatted hard drive. </s>
<s> And it's free. </s>
<s> Sorry if I don't write a tutorial but it's a little easy to use. </s>
<s> I also use GPARTED as well as EASYBCD for other minor duties. </s>
<s> And those are free and well discussed on the net. </s>
<s> Hope my sharing helps you save a buck, Bob </s>
