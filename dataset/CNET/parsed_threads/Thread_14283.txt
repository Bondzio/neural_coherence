<s> First off, let me say that I know very little about hardware...I'm more of a software guy. </s>
<s> That being said, a few days ago, I built this new PC: Chaintech V915P Mobo GeForce 6200 256mb video card 1gb 3200 Corsair Ram 120gb Western Digital HD w/ 8mb cache Intel 3.0ghz Processor 1mb cache (Socket 775) The processor is the problem I am concerned about. </s>
<s> it's running at 60C at idle. </s>
<s> i have 2 80mm case fans in it. </s>
<s> But I'm going to be adding more. </s>
<s> I would like to know how I would go about cooling it down. </s>
<s> Just looking for suggestions. </s>
<s> I'm thinking I might try a third party heat sink, right now I'm using Intel's. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> It's just a basic airflow problem. </s>
<s> Try it with the case cover off before you add more fans. </s>
<s> Another recurring issue are power supplies that are taxed to the limit. </s>
<s> You'll want the 450Watt or larger PSU. </s>
<s> Tax that PSU and it generates more heat as well. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Sorry, I should have mentioned it...I am using a 500W PSU And I have tried it with the side off, it doesn't drop much, maybe a degree or 2 </s>
<s> In other words, don't add fans yet. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> so i'm wondering if I should try a different heat sink </s>
<s> Since 60C is in spec, why do this? </s>
<s> BUT...I do a lot of processor intensive tasks with my computer such as 3D animation. </s>
<s> and I found today, just running a simple tutorial with a quicktime video embedded in it, the processor shot up to 68C. </s>
<s> And in a couple cases, the program even crashed. </s>
<s> could use another case fan. </s>
<s> Remember that both the video card, and possibly the memory will also get hotter and increase the interior ambient air temp around the CPU's HSF. </s>
<s> Intel says [for their HSF] that holding the ambient by the HSF 38 C [100F] or below will keep the CPU in spec. </s>
<s> Howevwer that is about what you are getting. </s>
<s> Try to get the air in the vicinity of the HSF about 33 C [91 F]. </s>
<s> a friend of mine just informed me that he found out that the P4 530 (the one I'm using) requires a BIOS update, and in fact the temperature showing is wrong. </s>
<s> Does anyone happen to know where I would find this update? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Thanks for the suggestions </s>
<s> Maybe find a mod shop in your area and pick up a tube of Arctic Silver 5 thermal compound. </s>
<s> The stock thermal pad on a P4 heatsink is........well lets just say it's not Arctic Silver. </s>
<s> Trust me I've done the experiments. </s>
<s> I'm not using the stock pad anymore...I was thinking about that too, I took the fan off and cleaned all that off, right to the copper and then added some OCZ Silver Compound...that's what's on there now </s>
<s> Apparently I was mistaken about the update and the CPU Temps...it's still showing 60C </s>
<s> Well My P4 560 runs at 50 degree Celcius at idle and running graphics intensive, can rise up to 67 degrees. </s>
<s> But idle at 60, wow that's hot. </s>
<s> Advice, get 2 fans in the rear if possible, 2 fans in the front, 1 on the top, and 1 on the side and get a better heatsink/fan, with maybe a PCI fan cooler. </s>
<s> Guarnteed temp drop. </s>
