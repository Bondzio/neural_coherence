i have a fx5200 video card but yours doesn't have a fan&quot; as mine does.
well, mine is cool for the most part and if yours has a heatsink only(a big one) then heat is already affecting it so any bad spikes aren't going over very well.
to have the 2nd monitor act so quickly in a bad matter suggests the video card is bad as well when the 1st monitor was taken, so you need to attack both ends of problem, replace both.
also, its possible another problem exists if the monitor going down took others componets/devices with it if things never settle down or become flaky that's the orginal cause.
another thought you drove the monitor into a hi-freq.
operation that it shouldn't have been or tweeked to extreme and it was short to live that way, especailly for older devices.
when you get the lcd, i strongly suggest to get new video card anyways in light of this as lcd is very intolerate of this type of operation.
