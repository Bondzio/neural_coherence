I don' want to spend a lot of money on something I don't really need. However I would like it to last for at least 2 to 4 years. I do some onling gaming (but not hard core). Microsoft office suite, Internet, Netflix, and remote work. I would like to reuse some if my hardware if Possible (if not, oh well).

Something new WILL NOT run your existing software that much faster as to cause a wow! BTDT. If $$$ is burning hole in pocket, buy something that adds up to a Grand and you'll sleep nites...and don't get buyer's remorse.

Swapping an OS and getting everything to function again can put a major hit on the beer supply. If the OS you have works.........leave it alone. Your call.
