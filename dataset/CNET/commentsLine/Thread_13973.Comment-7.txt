ok so my last reply was actually false.
i was under the wrong option.
i double cheked and i followed the steps the right way this time, and i entered the submenu and switched the input from digital to analog and the screen goes black for about 2sec and then goes right back to digital.
almost as if i dont have an avg cable connected.
any ideas?
