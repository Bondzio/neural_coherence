<s> I am in need of a new pc as my old Emachine crashed. </s>
<s> I believe the motherboard crashed and it seems that in many forums states that Emachines tend to blow the mobo quick. </s>
<s> I would like to stick to XP and it seems that my only way is to go online. </s>
<s> I am not a gamer only a budget minded user. </s>
<s> Any site suggestions? </s>
<s> I would like to build a pc one day but just not right now. </s>
<s> My only concern is that will I be able to recover my old system drive if i use it as a slave on the new pc? </s>
