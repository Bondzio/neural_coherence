I would like to minimize my cables and add some flexibility to my current set up. I want to add a wireless router, add capapability to print/fax etc wirelessly, and maybe add a budget friendly modem (I lease mine from comcast however $5/ month starting to add up)... my condo is not that big (under 1000 sq ft) and pretty open. Home office set up in living room. the farthest i would get from the router is walking up a flight of steps to my deck outside above my condo, maybe 20 ft vertically above me. is there an all in one router/modem that will also enable me to print wirelessly? I tried asking a couple of online retailers however 2 declined sales support and the other recommended equipment that would be suitable for an office. I only have one computer and a single printer. it does not need to be overly complicated or high tech (or expensive). I know that speed bottlenecks can occur anywhere in the system though im sure that current routers (and a new modem) will eclipse what i currently have speedwise. also, will i have compatability issues if i decide to upgrade to windows 7 suggestions.....thx

Both mine. The modem is DOCSYS 2.0 (will handle the highest speed connection) and the router is wireless N and Gigabit wired. With this setup you are wired and wireless for the future. I do not recommend a modem/router combo. Waaaaay too much trouble to configure. Print wirelessly? Is the printer a wireless printer? If so the router will find it. If not, keep it wired. There are wireless printer adapters out there but they can be a PITA. My router is printer compatible (wired). It can act as a print server. Connect it to the router and carry the laptop around.
