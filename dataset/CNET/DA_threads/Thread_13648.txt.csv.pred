1.1.1	Hi , I just built my first computer and it actually works ! !	St
1.1.2	The issue I 'm having is there is no sound .	St
1.1.3	The motherboard I purchased has a sound jack , so I thought I did n't need a sound/audio card .	St
1.1.4	Do I need to add a sound card , install a driver from of the CDs that came with motherboard , other ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.5	And yes , I checked the volume level on both the monitor and computer .	St
1.1.6	Here 's the link to the motherboard I bought .	St

1.2.1	What I find is many of the newer home PC builders are unaware of how Windows installations work .	St
1.2.2	That is , it 's a very old system that rarely works on its own .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	You do need to install drivers from that .	St
1.3.2	You did n't mention your OS but let 's assume it 's Windows .	St
1.3.3	Windows wo n't have all the needed drivers .	St
1.3.4	A trip to & quot ; device manager & quot ; will probably show you what hardware has been found but not configured .	St
1.3.5	Here 's where you do this from the CD .	St
1.3.6	You start by installing the chipset drivers and then add the on board devices .	St
1.3.7	The CD might have an autorun feature to help guide you .	St
1.4.1	Sorry , I should have mentioned OS , it 's Ubuntu 10.04 .	St
1.4.2	I browsed the CD , I do n't see a linux driver .	St
1.4.3	Not saying it 's not there , I 'm just looking for the file name that says LINUX in bold letters with lights flashing etc .	St
1.4.4	Any thoughts ?	Ques
1.5.1	Also , without a working link or make and model number folk ca n't look for you .	St
1.5.2	Bob	St
1.6.1	11.01 just recently came out and I loaded it on , but did n't care for it .	St
1.6.2	I 'll eventually install it , but until I get my computer up and running like I want , I think I 'll stick to an operating system I 'm somewhat familiar with .	St
1.6.3	I 'm very very new to Linux .	St
1.6.4	I 'm not sure what happened to the link .	Res
1.6.5	Here 's the make and model and I posted the link again .	St
1.6.6	GIGABYTE GA-P67A-D3-B3 LGA 1155 Intel P67 SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16813128487	Ques
1.7.1	http : //www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx ? pid=3800 # dl does not list a single Linux driver .	St
1.7.2	Time to ask for these in the Ubuntu forums .	St
1.7.3	About 11.01 .	St
1.7.4	I see 11.10 at the Ubuntu site .	St
1.7.5	Since you can run that LIVE without installing you should be able to test the sound there .	St
1.7.6	Bob	St
1.8.1	Thanks Bob !	St
1.8.2	!	St
