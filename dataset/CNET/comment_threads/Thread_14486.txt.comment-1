Hey guys, I'm looking into possibly upgrading a few components of my PC, but I'm a bit out of the loop regarding current compatibilities between some of my hardware/software.
I really need to upgrade my RAM, but its the area giving me the most trouble.
I'm currently running a eVGA, nForce 680i SLI 775 T1, LGA775, nForce 680i SLI, 1333MHz FSB, DDR2-1200 8GB /4, PCIe x16 SLI /2, SATA 3Gb/s RAID 0+1 /6, HDA, GbLAN /2, FW, ATX motherboard, with Windows XP Home, and I'm unsure as to what the best RAM choice would be that is compatible with this.
I know I have a 4G limit at DDR2-1200 speed, but if anyone had some suggestions please let me know.
I'm also running a GeForce 8800 GTS 320 MB RAM, that I am thinking about upgrading or maybe running two with SLI, what do you guys think would be the better option?
Thanks a lot everyone.
