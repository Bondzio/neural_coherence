there was an issue long ago.
today it can be debated if there is or not.
i won't enter into that debate but will share i do have it enabled and need it for a device i own.
i also see i can refine the google search to add the word port number or ports and see people talking about port numbers.
i purposely did not look at the maker's web site for documentation.
