<s> I'm putting together an old PC I brought home from school with all the same parts except for the case. </s>
<s> When I hook everything in, turn on the PSU, and turn on the power, the fans run for less that one second before turning off. </s>
<s> I am positive the motherboard is not shorting out on the case, nor is any other component. </s>
<s> I've triple-checked all of the connections, but I still get the same problem. </s>
<s> It's possible that on the trip back, one or more of the parts may have sustained damage. </s>
<s> Can anyone diagnose this problem? </s>
<s> Specs: Asus P5B motherboard Intel Core 2 Duo E6300 2x Corsair 512MB RAM Rosewill 480W PSU Seagate 150GB HDD Geforce 7600GT VGA Lite-On DVD-ROM drive </s>
<s> Since this was free and you may not know the previous history, you're probably experiencing the original problem of the PC. </s>
<s> While you mentioned you're sure no shorts on mounting, you should return the system to a minimum level plus have it on a non-conductive surface(aka, cardboard). </s>
<s> No drives, only video, some ram, and mtrbd. </s>
<s> with kybd. </s>
<s> and mouse. </s>
<s> Power-ON and see what it does. </s>
<s> Take steps to proceed if it boots or signals its OK. </s>
<s> I further suggest you inspect the mtrbd. </s>
<s> for any leaking, bulged, distended, blown capacitors(looks like small soda cans). </s>
<s> Try all that... tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I did what you said, but the same thing happened. </s>
<s> I couldn't find anything visibly wrong with the motherboard or any other component. </s>
<s> If there is a 110/220 switch on the PSU make sure it has not been changed. </s>
<s> This board may need the four wire plug to be used. </s>
<s> If all else fails one can short between the green and any black wire on the wide plug to see if the PSU fires up and stays on. </s>
<s> And lastly do the drastic. </s>
<s> Sometimes it is necessary to bench check a computer that will fail to start. </s>
<s> This involves Pulling the Power Supply and Pulling the motherboard. </s>
<s> Remove everything from the motherboard and place the bare board and Power Supply on a piece of Styrofoam or cardboard. </s>
<s> With the power supply on the table connected to the motherboard and Power supply plugged in, Use a small tool to momentarily short the two power on pins. </s>
<s> The Power supply should turn on and stay on noted by the supply's fan running. </s>
<s> Power off. </s>
<s> Now put the CPU/HSF on, add one stick of RAM, and mount the motherboard And power Supply back into the case. </s>
<s> Connect the Power Switch wiring, no mouse, keyboard or monitor or case fans and again see if the power supply turns on and stays on. </s>
<s> Get past this point power off and connect the keyboard, mouse and monitor, If needed Get into the BIOS to set boot options. </s>
<s> Add one thing at a time checking each item. </s>
<s> Case fans first. </s>
<s> First drive to add should be your CD. </s>
<s> drive then hard drive. </s>
<s> I shorted the green and black wires on the PSU and it worked, but there's something I don't understand: should the PSU be on as long as the two wires are touching, or should it continue to work after they have been separated? </s>
<s> When I tried it, it would only function when the two wires were touching. </s>
<s> I have already taken everything off of the motherboard and hooked it up to the PSU, and it still would only work for a second. </s>
<s> OK, pull everything off the mtrbd, all ram, cpu, cards and what have you. </s>
<s> It should be like the day it was build, blank. </s>
<s> Attach PSU and speaker and power-ON, it should beep like crazy or some beeping. </s>
<s> If you like leave a fan that gets power from mtrbd. </s>
<s> connection. </s>
<s> If that fan stays on plus the PSU fan you have a possible mtrbd. </s>
<s> issue. </s>
<s> If not or it simply twitches its a PSU problem, replace with known good/new one, retry. </s>
<s> If you continue to get no fans running or no beeps the mtrbd. </s>
<s> has had it for whatever reason. </s>
<s> Some people may try to short the bios pins in order to clear the bios and return to defaults. </s>
<s> ATX mtrbds. </s>
<s> have a start ckt. </s>
<s> and/or VRM area(maybe module) which may have failed and unless you're capable and able to find parts, its a wash. </s>
<s> Replace the mtrbd. </s>
<s> with a new/old one and march on. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> When the two pins are connected. </s>
<s> Did you get a chance to try the rest of the procedure, I.E, Hook up only thing at a time to determine where it ceases to stay on? </s>
<s> In my previous tests, I always left the processor in because I thought it would have no weight on the matter. </s>
<s> When I performed your test I removed EVERYTHING (including the processor) and only connected the PSU and the case speaker to the motherboard. </s>
<s> When I did this the PSU fan ran consistently until I cut the power, and when I replaced the processor, it went back to only turning on for a second. </s>
<s> Does this mean that the processor is the problem? </s>
