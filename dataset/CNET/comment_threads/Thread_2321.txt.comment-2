But as a test to see if it's your network, try it at a hotspot out at starbucks, macdonalds, panero bread, etc.
This will tell you if it's the network or the laptop.
I'd like to discuss this but I have to use networking terms such as WPA2, settings and more.
It's best if you tell what those settings are.
