I believe the NVidia board dominates the noise category.
Between the two the ATI board is a tad better in most games, but you'll find a lot of camps parked on both sides of the fence.
Personally I use ATI because it integrates well with my ATI USB video capture box for recording satellite movies.
NVidia has the speed crown now with the new 7800 but ATI is coming around with a new process technology.
Time will tell...
