1.2.1	I just move ahead since the install instructions are far too generic and may note steps that don't apply.	Sug
1.2.2	As to CPU upgrades, you research on Google ang Google Groups to see if anyone else successfully installed a faster CPU, but fair warning.	St
1.2.3	No such upgrade is assured with these ready to use boxes.	St
1.2.4	They may as well weld the CPUs into place.	St
