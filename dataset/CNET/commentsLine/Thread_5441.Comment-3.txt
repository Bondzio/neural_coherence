thanks for the suggestions r well, my goal is to invest in a machine that get my work done basically ofcourse, and also that wouldn't require me to spend time and money on upgrading later (someday or the other time will come but...until then) i am thinking of i7 cpu at the moment with least 4gbram, a good gpu ati/msi/nvidia.
the problem is i have been outdated with all the new hardware avaiable in the market today.
motherboards, gpus, dualgpus etc.
any bonus suggestion would help alot.
thanks.
