<s> i purchased a hp monochrome laser printer and would like to connect it to my airport network. </s>
<s> at hp's website they show a bluetooth device which plugs into the printer's usb port. </s>
<s> my question is will this device work with my airport network? </s>
<s> Given no model number I can't check if a wifi print server would work but bluetooth is something of a non-starter for many reasons. </s>
<s> The number one reason is either it doesn't connect to wifi and the other being the 5 or more minute page printing time. </s>

<s> I set one of these up on a mobile cart in a school and it worked fine. </s>
<s> Bluetooth is a horse of another color and works only with other compatible hardware. </s>
<s> The HP wireless device was bit pricey, as I recall, but it worked. </s>
<s> Others cost less and might work as well. </s>
