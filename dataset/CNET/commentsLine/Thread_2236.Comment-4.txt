bought this computer yesterday, and tv locked up minutes after install...saw lots of peoples' reviews at retail stores after purchase, who stated same problem.
found it hard to believe the &quot;pros&quot; at consumer reports #1 retailer - microcenter (ks) did not have a clue about this problem and recommended this as a great media center computer for tv use.
went back to store next day and they offered to exchange..hahaha.
luckily, searched google one last time for a solution tonight...and here it is...the update from microsoft provided by &quot;the wesker&quot; fixed the problem asap!!!!!
have been running tv now for about 2+ plus hours without skips, stalls, freezing, etc.
