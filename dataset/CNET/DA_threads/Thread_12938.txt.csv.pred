1.1.1	Hello ...	St
1.1.2	I have a bit of an unusual networking situation here in my home and need advice on proper configuration , so I stop losing my web connection on a daily basis .	St
1.1.3	First a basic diagram , followed by an explanation as to why this is necessary : & lt ; img src= & quot ; http : //i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n616/grindy45/Network_zps422c85d5.png & quot ; / & gt ; The reason I 'm forced to have the 2nd router is that my wife telecommutes and the 1st ( primary router ) is provided by her company .	St
1.1.4	For whatever reasons , her company will not allow the wireless radio in their router to be turned ON - which forces me to add the 2nd wireless router for our 3 computers that require wireless access .	St
1.1.5	My questions are : 1 - Since the primary router has DHCP enabled , I am assuming that I should Disable DHCP on my wireless router .	St
1.1.6	Am I correct ?	Ques
1.1.7	2 - What other settings on the wireless router do I need to pay particular attention to in this situation ?	Ques
1.1.8	All input will be appreciated here , and any suggestions you might have are particularly welcome .	St
1.2.1	Some of the cable modems have a DHCP in them so we disable on both routers and not use the WAN ports .	St
1.2.2	It seems close but a detail is missing so I ca n't offer anything exact except it looks very close .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Assuming that DHCP is properly configured to begin with , 1 .	St
1.3.2	Yes , you would disable DHCP on the wifi router .	St
1.3.3	2 .	St
1.3.4	You would connect from LAN port to LAN port ( do not use the WAN port on the wifi router ) .	St
1.3.5	If you have further problems , you may need to provide more details ( ISP , make/model of all networking devices , error messages , etc . )	St
