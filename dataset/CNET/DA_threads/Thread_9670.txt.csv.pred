1.1.1	Have a G5 with a Samsung LCD monitor.	St
1.1.2	Has worked fine until the other day when the monitor turned black and blinks with a white box in the top left corner.	St
1.1.3	Can also see the desktop sometimes during the blinking.	St
1.1.4	I hooked up another working monitor (same brand/model) and an older monitor to the G5 and had the same problem.	St
1.1.5	Changed cables and still nothing.	St
1.1.6	I am able to get the monitor to work if I restart in safe mode (extensions off).	St
1.1.7	Any suggestions?	St
1.2.1	Have you installed something new lately?	St
1.2.2	Starting in Safe Mode, as you know, turns off extensions.	St
1.2.3	If the graphics card works with extensions off, then the problem is obviously software.	St
1.2.4	Think back on what you have installed lately.	St
1.2.5	P	St
1.3.1	Thanks.	St
1.3.2	We installed CS4 package about a month ago so maybe something in that is causing a conflict.	St
1.3.3	Will uninstall and see if that works.	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	I think you have gotten your solution to the problem you were facing.	St
