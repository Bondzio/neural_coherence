then your PC is not the problem.
XP will not let you install a new MB an boot right away.
This is it's behavior when it sees itself on a new PC.
You will probably need to do a repair installation of the OS and reactivate it.
A repair installation does not (usually) cause data loss.
You also cannot just put the old MB back now to back things up.
Go for the repair installation and reactivate the OS.
