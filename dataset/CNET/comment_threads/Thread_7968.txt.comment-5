The difference between the networked drive and the USB external drive is that the networked drive is &quot;shared&quot; over the LAN network and the external is a HDD on the end of a serial bus.
I prefer to use networked drives, it's much easier than having to pull out hardware all the time when I move it from machine to machine.
