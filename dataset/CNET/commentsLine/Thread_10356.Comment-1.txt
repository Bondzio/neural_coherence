yo--i new here and need some advice on streaming netflix wireless to sammy bd6500 blu ray or sammy un60d7000vf tv.
i do fine till about 45 minutes into movie.
no stutters etc.
then router shuts off and a reset needed.
my set up linksys wrt 300n with 2 yagi 9db antennae.
(router is across the street in my office).
my download speed (measured 300 feet away in my residence is down 26.6 mbps and up is 2.6 mbps.
great signal and noise readings.
the problem only occurs when streaming through the tv or blu ray at hd.
anything less is fine.
streaming same movie to laptop is fine (however laptop needs better video hardware as stutters occur).
fix for router or new router suggesions would be appreciated.
if new, the router needs to have external antennae so i can hook up to outdoor yagis.
