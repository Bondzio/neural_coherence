All was working fine for about 3 months until my entire PC froze randomly (no mouse movement or anything else). I restarted my PC, got past the welcome screen, and would have about 10 seconds before my PC froze on me again. I did multiple restarts with the same result. When I unhooked the secondary drive, my PC would start up fine. I bought a real SATA hard drive and replaced the IDE-&gt;SATA one and my PC now works perfectly. Now here is the real problem. When I put my old IDE hard drive in an external USB enclosure to get my stuff off of it, Windows will not completely recognize it. The drive spins up fine and doesnt make any weird noises. I get the found a new device screen, and then installing drivers, but it wont get past that. I cannot see it in Disk Management, but I can see it in my Bios as a USB device. I tried two other PCs (one XP, one Vista), as well as a different enclosure, and the same thing happens. I have also set the jumpers on the drive to ever combo (including none at all). I can only think that stupid adapter corrupted my hard drive, but would love to hear some opinions! Any help would be GREATLY appreciated, thanks!
