<s> I was all happy with a low cost Netgear print server until i saw it needs Windows or Vista. </s>
<s> What would be Mac-compatible please? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I'd use theirs. </s>
<s> Using theirs would be fine. </s>
<s> They don't make one. </s>
<s> We are talking about something that plugs into a parallel port and connects a printer to an ethernet network. </s>
<s> I had one that connected through the Appletalk port, but no longer works because of Snow Leopard. </s>
<s> if you know for a fact that Apple makes one, I will be as delighted as surprised. </s>
<s> Best, - Bill </s>
<s> I missed that detail in your first post. </s>
<s> Also, try our other Mac specific forums and especially the one with the sticky note about printing issues in the new land. </s>
<s> I found a post over there that referred me to Netgear, but it's not compatible. </s>
<s> i've sent Netgear a request for a tech note to see if i can configure with a PC and run on a Mac. </s>
<s> I can't think of a good reason why the OS would be a problem for an ethernet converter, but it's probably more than that. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> Sorry but I haven't seen a parallel port printer since about 1999. </s>
<s> I can see why makers are not making print servers anymore. </s>

<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I'm aware of those posts, and they don't help at all. </s>
<s> I'm still hoping someone will have an answer to the question I asked. </s>
<s> I did ask it for a reason and did know what i was talking about. </s>
<s> None of the posts come close to helping me except one on the absence of Appletalk. </s>
<s> i'm not sure what the implications are, which is part of what I'm trying to find out. </s>
<s> Hey, it's an old printer from 2000. </s>
<s> But it works very very well and is overkill these days when i print less than 1% of the documents i generate. </s>
<s> Not about to get a new one unless i figure out that the price is close to what it will cost to get this working again. </s>
<s> i think the Netgear doodad will work if i can configure it with my PC, but surely there is one with Mac software. </s>
<s> By the way, i have run through 3 inkjet printers while this one soldiered on with no problems whatever. </s>
<s> Thanks for the comments. </s>
<s> Hope someone else will chime in though. </s>
<s> With all these replies, I am concerned people will figure my question was answered. </s>
<s> Should i repost, you think? </s>
<s> I guess that sounds ungrateful, and i'm not. </s>
<s> I'm just frustrated. </s>
<s> Your top post did have an answer. </s>
<s> But later we discover you had other than the run of the mill printer so what we all can use do not apply to your situation. </s>
<s> Good luck in your search. </s>
