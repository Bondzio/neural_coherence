What I usually have to do is to install the motherboard driver package... but you post didn't supply make or models numbers for the forum to work with. Try that. &quot; if i uninstall then reinstall &quot; WHAT? Bob

Your board supplier should have given you the CD with the SIS 735 drivers. If not, fish at http://www.sis.com/products/chipsets/oa/socketa/735.htm Bob

This is getting very strange ..... the DVD drive will now play DVD movies , but will not read DVD-R discs that have been burned on a friends machine ( these DVD-R discs do play on other PCs ok though),Nero info tool says it should play them.Now when the DVD and my Samsung SW-252 CD-RW are both connected the Samsung will not work - there is an exclamation mark in Device Manager and it does not show in &quot;My Computer&quot;.When it is connected on its own it is fine , but when both are connected the CD wont work.Why wont both work when both connected?

If not, IDE devices do not work together. As to the DVD-R, not all drives read/play recorded media. Reasons abound, but the most usual is... the drive is getting old or had dust on the laser lens.

The DVD is set to master and the CD is slave ( i have also tried the other way round) , the IDE cable came with the DVD and was fine before.Oddly when the CD was master and the DVD was slave the CD showed as a &quot;Local Disc&quot; in &quot;My Computer&quot; and with a big red question mark on it

I found that when such don't play together, one of the drives has failed or just is incompatible with the other drive. But a magic procedure I use is: 1. Set drives to Cable Select. 2. Use a shiny new 80 conductor cable. 3. Update each CDRW and DVD drive FIRMWARE per the maker's instructions. For me, this works well. Bob
