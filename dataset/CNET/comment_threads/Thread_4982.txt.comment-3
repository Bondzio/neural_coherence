The chances it was damaged are probably very small.
I don't know if there is any place that would test it for you.
If you know someone with a PC that can use the memory willing to let you borrow the PC for a few hours to test the RAM, you could do it that way.
To test RAM, get a program called memtest86.
Available at www.memtest86.org I believe.
It is free, and you put it on a CD or floppy and the system boots directly into it and begins testing your RAM.
Leave it running for at least a couple passes, and a full pass might take awhile depending on the speed of the PC.
If there are errors, memtest86 will find them.
