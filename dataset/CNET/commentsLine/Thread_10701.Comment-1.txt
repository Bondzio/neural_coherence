i have a small network of 3 computers (2 pc's & 1 laptop) @ home running on win xp prof edition.
everytime i try to remotely access one of the pc's, i got an error message that it cannot be connected (the client cannot be connected to the remote computer.
i check my firewall settings and also the window's one, they're all allowed to have remote desktop connection.
i can ping any one of the computers from using one or the other.
i can also share files between them..i just cannot connect remotely.
any help please!!!
thanks!
