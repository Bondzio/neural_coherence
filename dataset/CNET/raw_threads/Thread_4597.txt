It has two 256 mb sticks in it now. Can I put a single 1 gig stick in, and when I can afford the second put that in then? Running XP home, 3.0 pentium 4 with HT. Thanks Rick Davis

Your computer does not require both slots be used, so you can safely run it using the 1GB and add a second GB down the road. For that matter, you can insert the new 1GB module in one slot and leave one of the 256MB modules in the second slot until you purchase a new 1GB stick. Hope this helps, John

Later you could add another 1GB DIMM if desired. VAPCMD

Makes more sense to buy a single stick of 1 gig now, then upgrade to two as money permits.And I will keep that single channel vs dual in mind. To be safe I will get the identical stick down the line. I appreciate your help! Thanks Rick Davis
