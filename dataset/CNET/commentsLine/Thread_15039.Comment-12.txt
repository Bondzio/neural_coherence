hi graham, good advice so far.
what i would do is download the live cd version of partition wizard iso and burnit to a cd, then boot from the cd.
use partition- modify-hide partition to hide all the disk(s) you don't want to reformat.
this isn't strictly necessary but it will prevent any possibility of infection from the disks you are reclaiming.
then for each disk you want to reclaim, use partition wizard partition-delete and select the &quot;secure erase&quot; option.
for all partitions on the disk.
this will delete the partition(s) and overwrite with binary zeros.
your disk is now clean and empty.
use partition wozard to allocate whatever partition(s) you want to define on the disk, you might even want to rebuild the mbr (master boot record) to make sure that is clean too.
when you've done this for all disks, unhide the partitions you originally hid and reboot the machine into windows.
format (full format) all of the new partitions you created above and you are done.
this will take some time but you can guarantee there is no malware on any of the diisks.
good lick!
