<s> How can a USB modem be connected to an ethernet input only router? </s>
<s> I want to create a stand alone (PC local, but not connected) wireless hotspot using a Verizon EVDO broadband wireless modem and a WRT54GL router. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Two different protocols. </s>
<s> Unless you can find a &quot;USB to Ethernet converter&quot;. </s>
<s> I've never seen one, but who knows what's out there. </s>
<s> Do a Google on my quotes. </s>
<s> There is a whole raft of ethernet to USB converters for converting ethernet to USB for a PC with USB input but no ethernet input. </s>
<s> I was hoping that the opposite would exist, also. </s>
<s> I have found others with the same problem, but no solution so far. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> You could buy a router that would support a usb modem http://www.aztech.com/prod_3g_hw550.html Alternatively you can setup internet connection sharing on your desktop and use your computer as the gateway for your router. </s>
<s> Looked at the hw550 and it should work for my application. </s>
<s> I appreciate your help. </s>
