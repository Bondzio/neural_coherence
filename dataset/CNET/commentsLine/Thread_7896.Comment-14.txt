sounds like comp2 is trying to get the dns address from your gateway, comp1.
i'm still not sure that comp2 is even making a good connection to comp1.
that is why i suggested the ping test.
any results?
your cousin is on the right track--the router allows you to do away with all this ics junk.
i prefer routered networks.
