1.1.1	I 've found a barebone system with every thing I want , but hesitant about the Harddrive bundled .	St
1.1.2	It 's a 120 gig IEDE Maxtor ultra ATA 133 , but only 5400 RPM and & lt ; 13 average seek time .	St
1.1.3	Since I am upgrading equipment ( P4 3.0 Mhz , 512MB PC3200 DDR 400MHz ) to speed things up ; Is this drive considered & quot ; old stuff & quot ; .	St
1.1.4	Or does ist matter .	St
1.2.1	I read a report a while back where someone had done a test of 5400 vs 7200 .	St
1.2.2	In their test they did not see much of a diff .	St
1.2.3	Yes 7200 was slightly better .	St
1.2.4	Where they did see a big diff was in cache size .	St
1.2.5	Bigger is better .	St
1.2.6	So if your looking to squeeze out all the juice get a 7200 unit with the biggest cache you can find/afford	St
1.3.1	but you may never notice the difference between it , and a newer 7200 drive .	St
1.3.2	However , if you are upgrading things , may consider getting a new 7200 drive .	St
1.3.3	and using the old drive for a backup .	St
1.3.4	Just a thought , as the 5400 drive will probably serve you well .	St
1.4.1	Thanks guys .	St
1.4.2	I may unload the unboxed drive on ebay , and go for a newer one to put in this barebone kit Rob	St
1.5.1	There is a significant and immediately noticeable difference between a 5400RPM drive and a 7200RPM drive .	St
1.5.2	You do n't even want to consider the slower drive in anything but a laptop .	St
1.5.3	I have upgraded many in the past and in every case the owner immediately noticed their system was quite a bit faster .	St
1.6.1	Particularly with everything else you 're getting for your system .	St
1.6.2	The hard drive is about the slowest thing in a computer .	St
1.6.3	So the faster it is the faster the entire system is .	St
