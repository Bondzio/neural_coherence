both my mini-mac and my powerbook have a strong airport signal from my airport extreme base station.
The internet connection always works on the mini-mac (running10.5.4).
The internet connection is sporadic on the powerbook G4 (OS 10.4.11).
Like now there is no internet, but the airport signal strength is great.
Restarting the base station or the Powerbook does not solve the problem.
You had this problem in the past.
What was your solution?
