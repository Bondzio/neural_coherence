yup.
unlikely to be your hard drive.
if you already did the vga test (i.e., if your pc uses a video card but has an onboard chip too, remove the video card and plug into the on-board one.
this was outlined in the link i posted before.)
however, is almost definitely your motherboard, only other possibility is the cpu.
if you don't feel capable of doing your own hardware repair and are frightened to waste money on getting a new motherboard wrong, the take it to a reputable repair shop.
you can get motherboard and cpu sets, often with ram too for prices varying from fairly cheap to very dear.
go for a mid range in your budget, or try to get the same motherboard, possibly from ibm or lenovo, or see if you can trace it elsewhere.
chances are it may be difficult to find, though, and better to take the opportunity to upgrade a little.
your present hard drive should work with a new motherboard, and you should not lose any data, although will need to install drivers if it's a different motherboard.
nevertheless, as with anything to do with hardware replacements or software upgrades, back up what you need to keep.
the repair shop will probably offer you this service too if you don't have the facilities.
other option : depending on the age of the pc, it might be more worthwhile to go for a new pc rather than throw a lot of money at the old one.
get the repairs priced, and compare with a new pc.
if it's going to cost more than 2/3 of the cost of a new one, go for the new one !!!
you could install the drive in your new one, either as master, making its drive a slave, or as slave to the new one's drive.
depends on whether you've got backups for all your programmes so you can re-install them or not, and whether you want the newer os (vista at present).
good luck !
