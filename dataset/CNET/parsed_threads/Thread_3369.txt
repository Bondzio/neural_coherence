<s> what store? </s>
<s> whichever got the best deal of course! </s>
<s> i would recommend getting the a1250n. </s>
<s> it features a dual core amd processor, 1gb of ram, and 250gb hd. </s>
<s> i would also look into the gateways with the btx case designs and pentium d processors. </s>
<s> usually cost around $1000 in ads. </s>
<s> i dont recall the model # though. </s>
<s> Also, I don't have a thousand dollars to spend currently. </s>
<s> Since you have a decent cash in hand. </s>
<s> It would be nice to build your own so you can focus on customizing your PC. </s>
<s> Otherwise, gateway has good deals, Dell has good customizations. </s>
<s> Either way. </s>
<s> It would make it interesting to buid your own rig. </s>

<s> I just got finished rebuilding a Dell Dimension L-series computer and it was like trying to stuff a shoebox with a CRT TV. </s>
<s> The motherboard didn't want to fit in, the ps was always in the way, all the drive bays were in the way of the right corner's motherboard clip (that's what I hate about it, it uses clips instead of screws and spacers) the cables didn't want to go the way I wanted them to go, basically, I need a bigger case than that. </s>

<s> Hello. </s>
<s> Well you did not specify a budget, but here is a good computer for the needs you listed at the beginning of this forum. </s>
<s> I would recommend a HP d4100e. </s>

<s> Another option is to build your own like recommended by &quot; Francisjakee &quot; . </s>
