1.1.1	I 've built a number of PCs without ever experiencing this common problem , here 's what happened and how I fixed it .	St
1.1.2	I built a micro-ATX machine for my wife , all moderate components .	St
1.1.3	I researched their power requirements and figured a 150-watt Antec power supply should do the job .	St
1.1.4	After installing Win 2K , I always install chipset drivers first , then ZoneAlarm , then Norton AV and hit the 'Net for updates .	St
1.1.5	When I tried to open IE , spontaneous crash & reboot .	St
1.1.6	Hmmm .	St
1.1.7	After several repeats , I booted into Safe Mode , all was well , but when I booted normally and tried to run an app the crashes returned .	St
1.1.8	Figuring the machine was underpowered , I schlepped off to Fry 's to get a 350W ATX PSU .	St
1.1.9	After shoehorning it into the case , imagine my surprise when the same incident occurred .	St
1.1.10	I had purchased the mobo with the CPU installed and figured the assembler might have messed up the install , but before I went to that extreme ( there was a piece of tape saying Warranty Void if Removed ) I re-traced my steps and realized my problems started when I installed NAV .	St
1.1.11	I re-booted into Safe Mode , removed Norton , and voila !	St
1.1.12	Problem solved .	St
1.1.13	I re-installed Norton and updated , machine ran SiSoft Sandra 's burn-in routine with no problems .	St
1.1.14	I guess there was some conflict between ZoneAlarm and Norton , or just a bad software install , for whatever reason .	St
1.1.15	I 've heard of bad drivers , bad PSUs & bad CPU installation causing this problem , never a bad install of software .	St
1.1.16	Keep this info in the back of your head for the future .	St
