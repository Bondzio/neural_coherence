<s> My system is no punk but could use a good boost for gaming. </s>
<s> O.k. </s>
<s> so, my specs are as follows: Amd64 3000+ (Venice no oc) 2 GB geil dual channel pc3200 Asrock 939-dual (pci and agp) 256mb ati aiw x800 agp 2 x 160 GB Seagate drives Lite-on dual layer dvd-rw Lite-on DVD-ROM Blah, blah, blah So what I am wondering is, say Im limited to about a 500.00 upgrade which way should I go? </s>
<s> I mean I love my all-in-wonder but should I go with a newer gaming card and run both (agp and pci) or do I really need more ram (4gb seems excessive). </s>
<s> Or the motherboard does support the dual core CPUs. </s>
<s> Any input is appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Before I begin, that machine looks solid: Good Job! </s>
<s> Let's go! </s>
<s> I'm gonna skip the CPU and talk abt in the end. </s>
<s> The 2GB is good, very good actually. </s>
<s> Storage/Removable storage looks good. </s>
<s> For clarifcation, this is your motherboard, correct: http://www.asrock.com/product/939Dual-SATA2.htm Motherboard looks good, I like the hybridish combination of AGP and PCI-e. (btw, is that a typo in the mobo description?) </s>
<s> The only thing that isn't very very best in it's field is just the CPU and GPU. </s>
<s> If you are getting solid numbers in games, I would upgrade the CPU. </s>
<s> If it is sluggish in non-gpu intensive apps, like uh... word? </s>
<s> (lol) jk, but you know that I mean, right? </s>
<s> Also, whats the wattage, make, and maybe rails of the PSU? </s>
<s> Name and series would work, too. </s>
<s> A reasonable upgrade for the mobo would be either semi-entry line X2, maybe the 4200+ or if you look hard enough, you could squeeze in a 4400+. </s>
<s> (Mobo does support X2) I think they have the same clock, not sure though. </s>
<s> Think it is more advanced in other things. </s>
<s> Anyways, if you get a GPU I'd go for a 7800GT, easily in your budget. </s>
<s> Or do want to buy both a GPU and a CPU? </s>
<s> Otherwise, the machine looks good. </s>
<s> Good luck, and remember in the end: Its your call. </s>
<s> ~Ibrahim~ </s>
<s> Yes that is the board and I thought that was a neat feature myself. </s>
<s> they can be used together believe it or not, one for editing (aiw) one for gaming (hmmm) at the same time as I understand it. </s>
<s> I had not thought of the psu, it's some off brand 480w that came with my transformers case (yes, I am that geek with the autobot case). </s>
<s> unfortunatly i am pretty sure i'm limited to either a cpu or the gpu (i think i'll upgrade the psu no matter what). </s>
<s> so i know it's up to me in the end but if it was your system and your money which would you choose? </s>
<s> i found a 4200 x2 and a 7800gt both for around 680.00, not sure if i can pull another 180.00 out of nowhere though. </s>
