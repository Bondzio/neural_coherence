1.1.1	Hallo, We have a storage array arranged at as a High availability cluster (So everything I described is doubled for redundancy) consisting of a Dell PowerEdge 1950 server, 5 iSCSI disk storage Dell MD3000i + 2 Dell MD1000 extensions and sevral one and two TB SATA disks connected to the storrage array trough interposer boards.	St
1.1.2	Now we want to add more storrage and I was thinking of adding Seagate Barracuda 3TB 7200RPM (ST3000DM001) disks.	St
1.1.3	But I read that MD3000i drivers can't handle 3TB disks and that there is a 2TB disk limit.	St
1.1.4	Does anybody have more information about this or exprience with adding 3TB disks to an MD 3000 storrage array?	St
1.2.1	Certainly Dell can answer this question.	St
1.2.2	I assume you have a maintenance contract with them, since the hardware seems rather critical for your company.	St
1.2.3	So why not go with what Dell supports, even if it isn't a Seagate disk?	Sug
1.2.4	Kees	St
1.3.1	I'd not get too excited about 3TB drives.	St
1.3.2	Backup is getting to be a chore as it is.	St
1.3.3	I'd re-evaluate why the space is needed and move stuff to other storage areas.	St
1.3.4	Bob	St
1.4.1	I actually send a mail to Dell customer support with this question about a week ago and haven't gotten a reply yet.	St
1.4.2	I am not particularity attached to Seagate disks any 3 TB 7200rpm 3.5&quot; SATAu disk is good.	St
1.4.3	I just used those as a reference since a couple of the disks we bought from Dell were made by Seagate.	St
1.5.1	Believe it or not the storage array is not a backup system.	St
1.5.2	Its part of a NASA/ESA project in order to distribute data from the Solar Dynamic Observatory satellite.	St
1.5.3	This satellite sends about 1,5 Terabite of data to the earth every day.	St
1.5.4	At our site we keep about six months worth of data to distribute among scientists.	St
1.5.5	Data older then six months is deleted.	St
1.5.6	Adding more storage means we can keep data for a longer time period or keep more interesting events.	St
1.5.7	If we were to lose data we would download it from an other site.	St
1.5.8	The reason to order now is because at the end of the year the budget is either spend or lost.	St
1.6.1	You may want to ask if there is firmware in the works to extend this to 3 and more TB drives.	St
1.6.2	Bob	St
1.7.1	3Tb is a rather large HD that the OS has to handle, which at times can be troublesome on its own.	St
1.7.2	The technical specs offer it can handle that, but you HD enclosure may have limits in how it handles any HD larger or not OEM to it.	St
1.7.3	Controller(or think replacement) may require a firmware update in order to handle these 3Tb drives, so you have to review the specs or visit the maker's support website.	St
1.7.4	Query there or flat out ask them as well.	St
1.7.5	All this I mention is a &quot;huge assumption&quot; for even regular PC's this is a huge step.	St
1.7.6	You can check Dell's &quot;upgrades site&quot; maybe accessories and see if they offer this as an option or path.	Sug
1.7.7	-OR- see if any newer Dell servers offer a similar solution to include the 1950.	St
1.7.8	On a similar topic, users of NAS type setups have not always been easy for 3Tb or simply can't be done.	St
1.7.9	You have a deadend setup, however in many cases 2Tb HDs seem to work, again all the above applies.	St
1.7.10	Oh!	St
1.7.11	woo is the budget.	St
1.7.12	Just order them, even if not used in your task, they won't sit long if they become part of stock wares.	St
1.7.13	Though, I lean with 2Tb drives for now.	St
1.7.14	example: http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/category.aspx?c=us&l=en&s=bsd&cs=04&mfgpid=167752&chassisid=8743&ST=dell+poweredge+1950+server&dgc=ST&cid=256432&lid=4560128&acd=sQBb0089R&p=3 Need not buy from them, but you see what they offer.	St
1.7.15	tada -----Willy	St
1.8.1	I got a reply from Dell.	St
1.8.2	They told me that 2TB is the maximum and since they stopped selling MD3000i controllers, it will remain the maximum.	St
1.8.3	So we went with the 2TB disks Thanks for the help.	St
