the sticky disc would bother me so much that i would want to replace the drive asap.
i would hate to lose a good movie dvd or some other valuable disc.
you can get an 18x dual layer dvd burner for about $30 + shipping.
do you think some sticky liquid or food got inside the drive?
have you inspected the inside of the case for something spilled or anything out of the ordinary?
is the drive/disc hot when you attempt to remove a stuck disc?
