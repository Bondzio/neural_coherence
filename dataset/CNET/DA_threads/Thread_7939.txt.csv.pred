1.1.1	Computer ( Dell ) has been working fine then yesterday I went to watch a video and it played fine but no voice .	St
1.1.2	So I checked to see if the volume might have gotten on mute but it was on it 's regular setting .	St
1.1.3	The icon is no longer in the tray as it usually is .	St
1.1.4	Then check Sounds & Devices and everything is grayed out staying no audio device can be found .	Sug
1.1.5	I checked everything else and update all the drivers but still no sound .	St
1.1.6	How could it suddenly disappear .	St
1.1.7	Any help , as always is greatly appreciated .	St
1.2.1	So I 'm going with GENERIC ADVICE .	St
1.2.2	1 .	St
1.2.3	Use system restore to the day before yesterday .	St
1.2.4	2 .	St
1.2.5	NEVER ACCEPT DRIVERS from Microsoft unless you are ready to deal with the failures .	St
1.2.6	3 .	St
1.2.7	Look in the BIOS settings for the enable/disable of on board sound .	St
1.2.8	A few reply they did n't change it which is nice to know but still something we must check .	St
1.2.9	Sorry for the generic answers but no model number to work with .	St
1.2.10	And do n't panic if the audio card is gone and failed .	Sug
1.2.11	There are 2 dollar USB sound devices to take over for a cheap fix .	St
1.2.12	Bob	St
1.3.1	Now that is crazy .	St
1.3.2	I have n't had to do restore for a very long time .	St
1.3.3	Went to System Restore and to click on a restore date .	St
1.3.4	There are no dates showing .	St
1.3.5	The & quot ; calendar & quot ; is blank .	St
1.3.6	As for the drivers I only checked to see if they were all up to date and they were .	St
1.3.7	What would cause this issue with system restore ?	Ques
1.3.8	Going to check the BIOS settings now .	St
1.4.1	Nice when it works but it fails for far too many reasons for me to list here .	St
1.4.2	No model number , no OS listed so we are still in generic answers .	St
1.4.3	Oh , here 's the 2 buck audio fix I use too often - & gt ; http : //www.amazon.com/Virtual-5-1-surround-External-Sound-Card/dp/B000N35A0Y/ That 's $ 1.46 today to my mail box .	St
1.4.4	I carry one with me if I 'm out to troubleshoot/fix an audio issue like the one above .	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	Dell Inspiron and Windows XP .	St
1.5.2	Sounds like a easy fix if all else fails ... will order one today .	St
1.6.1	I see you see why I carry one in my bag of tricks .	St
1.6.2	Bob	St
1.7.1	Once again ... .you 've help solve a issue without a great deal of cost .	St
1.7.2	Thanks Raven	St
1.8.1	But it 's not a done deal yet .	St
1.8.2	It is something I 've used a few times and sometimes I do n't even have to install a driver for that thing .	St
1.8.3	Try it without the driver and hope .	St
1.8.4	- & gt ; About system restore .	St
1.8.5	If it 's empty try the old Windows thing .	St
1.8.6	Disable SR and then re-enable SR. Bob	St
1.9.1	I tried what you suggested and that still did n't fix the issue .	St
1.9.2	So I ran Disk Cleanup and SR now show the calendar but now it wo n't allow me to chose a date .	St
1.9.3	My only option is restore today .	St
1.9.4	I went into Device Manager and there is a yellow question mark beside Multimedia Audio Controller .	St
1.9.5	I did right click on it , disabled and enabled and check properties .	St
1.9.6	It appears their is no audio controller or driver ... I 'm not sure which of those is the issue and how to fix it .	St
1.9.7	Thanks	Polite
1.10.1	Just remove the sound controller .	St
1.10.2	Windows should try to reinstall it .	Sug
1.10.3	Another way to approach this is to see if you have a disk that came with the computer with a chipset driver .	St
1.10.4	A Chipset Driver is software that tells windows what hardware you have on your computer 's motherboard so it will know what it is and how to use it .	St
1.10.5	Usually this comes with a motherboard or a computer when you purchase it .	St
1.10.6	If you take your model number of your computer you should be able to go to Dell 's website and download it or an updated version .	St
1.10.7	Look for the support section at dell 's website .	St
1.10.8	Sometimes drivers become corrupt .	St
1.10.9	This can happen if the power supply is going bad or the hard drive is failing and you get file damage .	St
1.10.10	If the computer is really old things may be waring out .	St
1.10.11	Hard drives fail and this may be a sign of a failing hard drive .	St
1.10.12	Of course your audio devide could be bad also .	St
1.11.1	Only if there are restore points after the repairs you did .	St
1.11.2	There are many issues with System Restore and the lack of any backup or restore of this feature is one of them .	St
1.11.3	Bob	St
1.12.1	I right clicked on Multimedia Audio Controller and properities .	St
1.12.2	It states there is no driver .	St
1.12.3	I searched around and the driver they are suggesting is Realtek 97 and it keeps crashing my pc midway through the install causing the Blue Screen of Death .	St
1.12.4	After I two attempts at installing it I gave it .	St
1.12.5	I also went in Services , Windows Audio and clicked on restart and nothing .	St
1.12.6	Still no audio .	St
1.12.7	I shut down and rebooted and still no sound .	St
1.12.8	I just keeps stating there is no driver for Multimedia Audio Controller .	St
1.12.9	I downloaded the suggested one from here but for some reason it wo n't allow me to run it .	St
1.12.10	Any suggestions .	St
1.13.1	And dozens of drivers for each one .	St
1.13.2	So it is almost a sure thing you ca n't get the right one .	St
1.13.3	-- -- & gt ; & gt ; & gt ; & gt ; & gt ; I ca n't find the MODEL NUMBER of this Dell .	St
1.13.4	Then means I have to go with generic advice along with the usual head to dell.com , put in the service tag from the machine for the drivers .	St
1.13.5	Bob	St
1.14.1	Sorry I thought I had posted that info .	St
1.14.2	I also was wrong on what Dell it is .	St
1.14.3	It 's actually Dimesion 4550 not a Inspiron ( that is my laptop ) .	St
1.14.4	Not sure if it 's any help as I did n't post it but the Audio Device is Unimodem Half Duplex Audio Device .	St
1.14.5	I 'll give Dell a try and post whatever results I get .	St
1.15.1	Reply to the top post to carry on .	St
