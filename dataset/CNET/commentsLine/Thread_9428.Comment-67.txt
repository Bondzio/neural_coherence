i'm trying my best to avoid having vista or any new hardware with the &quot;fritz chip&quot; on it.
i want to get a new pc while i can still buy one without the fritz chip.
preferably a build-it-yourself with a retail version os that belongs to me instead of my hardware vendor (dell, gateway, hp, etc) so i can upgrade my own motherboard without microsoft disabling my operating system.
vista is the next generation of &quot;big brother&quot; - apps that &quot;phone home&quot; and let vendors disable and even delete files from your machine remotely.
the new vista machines have complicit hardware such that the hardware itself prevents you from disabling anything that microsoft wants in your pc, including a new operating system.
i do not want vista on my pc, in my home.
i don't &quot;pirate&quot; anything and don't do music on my pc at all (i'm 65), but i decidedly wish to own my own pc rather than microsoft and vendors having control of it.
i mean, really, what about its latest drm scheme that opened a hole wide enough to drive a truckload of trojans through?
microsoft is turning out to protect vendors at your/our expense - that's what it's &quot;trustworthy computing&quot; means - don't get the mistaken idea that it's more &quot;trustworthy&quot; for you - it isn't; it's more trustworthy for vendors - including microsoft.
the only user-friendly thing microsoft has done imho is to move the drivers out of the kernel, but that's just correcting one of its original design mistakes.
i have protection all around and have never had an unfriendly software invasion, so that is not enough reason for me to turn control of my pc over to microsoft and other vendors.
so, my advice would be to buy a machine while you can still get one that will belong to, and can be controled by, you, instead of microsoft and other vendors.
