I got an external enclosure and an 80gb HD off Newegg to transfer all my stuff from my desktop to so that way I could ditch the desktop and just use the external HD for storage for my laptop. I followed all the instructions in assembling the enclosure with the HD and then plugged everything. The computer says the device is working working fine but the drive won't show up in the My Computer folder. Any help would be greatly appreciated. This is the enclosure: http://www.newegg.com/product/product.asp?item=N82E16817155512 And this is the HD: http://www.newegg.com/product/product.asp?item=N82E16822145069
