i purchased an emachine with a sempron 3000+ processor, 120 gb hard drive, double layer burning dvd, 512mb memory, nvidia geoforce 4 card, and i use a high-speed cable modem.
the box advertising said it was designed for &quot;multimedia use.&quot; i recently went back to the store (walmart, by the way) and noticed a new emachine &quot;bundle&quot; on the shelf with an amd athlon 64 processor.
it was designed for &quot;gaming.&quot; uh-oh.
why wasn't the bundle with the athlon there before?
i am enjoying my system, but my question (if i haven't bored you to tears yet) is: if i want to play games, for example, like half life 2, area 51, riddick, call of duty (games i've read about and would love to play) is my sempron 3000+ up to the task?
can i get by with it?
is there that much of a performance difference?
several months from now, am i going to go to the store, look at a program's (be it a game or grafx tool) requirements and say, &quot;oh well, looks like i can't run this one on my machine.&quot; i've tried googling, but i'm somewhat perplexed with the information i've found concerning doubling clock speed (how?
), cache, fsb, etc.
the last computer i owned had a 386sx chip and i remember that i should have gotten a true 386 chip.
did i inadvertantly do the same thing again?
cognitive dissonance is running somewhat high.
thanks for your help.
