The black cartridge filled OK but the color did not.
The printer would not recognize the color cartridge after refilling.
We had them refilled at Walgreens.
Saved $10.00 on the black, would have saved the same on the color.
The same evening that the color failed we picked up the color cartridge at Meijer for the same price new that we payed for the refill.
This was not an &quot;on sale&quot; item.
Black works fine, so far.
