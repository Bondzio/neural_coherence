<s> I would like a list of good quality camcorders that work well with our new Pro and iMovie'11. </s>
<s> Was hoping to get HD camcorder but, if the Mac Pro can't handle MPEG 4 files, we will settle for what the Mac can handle. </s>
<s> We want to record classical music ensembles (good audio required, probably low light, maybe zoom to single players) as well as modern dance and gymnastics. </s>
<s> Important that modest editing can be done in iMovie (though could purchase another program, but not the very expensive professional program). </s>
<s> Want to produce good quality audio + video file that can be played on PC's as well as Macs and that can be burned onto DVD. </s>
<s> Would also like to play videos from the Mac on our HD-TV. </s>
<s> A full list of camcorders would be appreciated. </s>
<s> There were so many &quot;Visual stabiliztion limitations&quot; with iLIFE'09 (listed on the Mac website), I suspect that the list of compatible camcorders for iLIFE'11 is small. </s>
<s> I hope that Apple and Mac fans will be upfront and guide us to a camcorder that really works well with a new Macbook Pro. </s>
<s> Thanks very much, I will report back on our choice, hopefully in the next 4-5 weeks. </s>
<s> I can tell you that most of the Hard Drive based cameras work well with iMovie. </s>
<s> Avoid, like the plague, any camera that puts the video directly down onto a DVD. </s>
<s> Because the DVD is the finished thing, it is extremely difficult to edit the footage without having to convert the footage to DV or something similar. </s>
<s> And then, because it is Sunday and I have nothing to do right now, I went in search of a definitive answer for you. </s>
<s> I finally found it in iMovie 11, under Help. </s>
<s> http://help.apple.com/imovie/cameras/en/index.html?lang=en_US Just select the options that you want, remember to avoid DVD based cameras, and hit the Go button. </s>
<s> Voila! </s>
<s> A list of compatible cameras. </s>
<s> Let us know what you decide P </s>
<s> iMovie 11 is capable of stabilizing a shaky picture on its own. </s>
<s> All the warning is saying is that any camera that uses the CMOS image sensors often use a technology called a &quot;rolling shutter&quot; and that, if you use iMovie 11 Video Stabilization when you are editing the raw footage, you will likely have a result that looks distorted. </s>
<s> A workaround is to either use a tripod while filming your event, which will give you a stable picture to begin with OR Do not use iMovie 11's built in Video Stabilization feature. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> help.apple.com is one of my trusted websites, but the options, in any combination, render a warning window with an exclamation in a yellow triangle and a &quot;yes&quot; with an OK button. </s>
<s> When I click the button, nothing happens. </s>
<s> Why is this happening? </s>
<s> I have tried several combinations, same result. </s>
<s> am running a Windows 7 OS (my daughter owns the Mac Pro). </s>
<s> Thanks for the info about the stabilization issue, especially if we get a camcorder with a CMOS image sensor. </s>
<s> Does this mean that we can turn off iLIFE's built-in video stabilization feature to get a less distorted picture? </s>
<s> (I can't check that right now - Mac Pro is not in the house.) </s>
<s> I will definitely get a tripod for concert and dance recordings, so I hope the pictures will be stable to begin with. </s>
<s> Thanks again, awaiting reply about the Mac website with options to find compatible camcorder (though maybe I have to ask for help from Apple). </s>
<s> the video stabilization is not something that needs to be turned off in iMovie, it is off by default. </s>
<s> To stabilize a piece of video there are a number of steps to got through before it does its thing. </s>
<s> Not sure what is happening with the Apple site for you with Windows 7, I'll check with a Winbox here, only XP, and see if I have the same problem. </s>
<s> Just checked, works fine in XP with IE and Firefox. </s>
<s> Try it with Firefox and see if you get the same result. </s>
