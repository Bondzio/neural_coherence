1.1.1	Are you an intel or AMD fan?	St
1.1.2	post the results here!	St
1.1.3	(if your AMD what do you think about the new Phenom, If intel, about there quad core) (also I anyone has some CPU benchmarks to prove there core better post it here.)	St
1.1.4	well to get this started I'm an AMD fan.	St
1.1.5	And I think that phenom will be the best chip out there as soon as all the bugs are worked out.	St
1.2.1	and the q6600's replacement penryn chip will be about 10% faster at the same speed so phenom will be 15-20% off the pace by march '08.	St
1.2.2	phenom production can barely hit 2.8ghz, while core2quad was at 3+ ghz in its prior generation.	St
1.2.3	(even q6600s OC easily to 3.2ghz.)	St
1.2.4	sorry, but phenom has no chance of being the best high-end processor.	St
1.3.1	I see some quad core AMDs out.	St
1.3.2	The price looks fine so they'll sell.	Polite
1.3.3	Are you buying?	St
1.4.1	I'm buying the Phenom yet because I can't afford it yet	St
1.5.1	Tomshardware says....&quot;Our recommendation hence is simple: Keep your Athlon 64 X2 if you can and wait for the Phenom B3 stepping.	St
1.5.2	Not only will it fix the TLD bug, but we expect most motherboard manufacturers to be ready with proper Phenom support by then.&quot; No point in buying something's that's not right.	St
1.5.3	By the time you save your pennies, maybe B3 will be available.	St
1.5.4	VAPCMD	St
1.6.1	I just found out this, AMD has been making CPUs for the military!	St
1.6.2	and Lucas Arts used the Quad core to make there movies.	St
1.6.3	Intel don't be jealous.	St
1.7.1	Just because they bought a flawed product, doesn't mean you should.	St
1.7.2	The Phenom has been plagued with problems since it was introduced and by the time they get the B3 stepping out, Intel will have the Penryn core on the street.	St
1.7.3	Only a fool stands on train track and denies the oncoming train will hit him.	St
1.7.4	Your $, your call.	St
1.7.5	VAPCMD	St
