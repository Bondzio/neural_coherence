Same problem here.
Windows ME.
I lost my display settings the same day (12/17/04) your message was posted.
Have 16 colors and no more settings seem to be available.
Tried system restore, didn't work.
System information report says: Item name Value Standard PCI Graphics Adapter (VGA) Adapter type: not available Adapter description: (standard display types) Adapter RAM: not available Installed drivers: not available Driver version: vga.drv INF file: 4.0 (MILLDISP.INF section) color planes: VGA Color table entries: 4 Resolution: 16 X 640 X 480 hertz Bits/Pixel: 0 Memory Address: 0xA0000-0xAFFFF Memory Address: 0xB0000-0xBFFFF I/O Port: 0x03B0-0x03BB I/O Port: 0x03C0-0x3DF Memory address: 0xFF000000-0xFF7FFFFF Memory address: 0xE7EF0000-0xE7EFFFFF I/O Port: 0xCC00=0xCC7F Memory adress 0xC0000-0xC7FFF Driver c:\windows\system\vmm32.vxd (, 1,008.75 KB (1,032,956 bytes), Not Available) Can anyone help me?
