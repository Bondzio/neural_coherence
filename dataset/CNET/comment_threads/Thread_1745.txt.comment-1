Hello everyone, I have been using my P4 - 2.4 GHz, 512MB Ram, and 80GB Hard Disk and a 24!Bit Sound Balaster with 5.1 Speaker Computer for quite 2 years from now.
I have also recently added a wireless Router to My Existing Broadband Connection.
Some times in my house all the Electrical Applicances ( except the Normal Lighting ) fuse off... do u think i should be investing on a UPS power Supply....Will it help make my computer's life longer than normal Thanks in Advance ... Surut
