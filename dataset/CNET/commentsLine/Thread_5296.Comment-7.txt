i have built 3 pc's.
i always thought i should buy the best graphics card i could find.
then i decided to buy a complete pc from costco (quad core w/integrated card).
i did add more memory and use additional external hard drives.
i can't tell any difference.
i don't play high graphics games.
i am a retired grandmother; my kids and grand kids can't tell any difference either.
