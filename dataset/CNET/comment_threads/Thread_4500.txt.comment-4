Thanks for clearing all that up.
I do know a bit about high end ATI cards, because I want to buy I new computer sometime soon.
I am also fairly knowedgable about Crossfire and stuff.
I was wondering, if I was to upgrade my AGP FX 5700 LE video card to something less than $200 tat plays Oblivion and other such games fairly well.
Would the X800, X1300, or the X1600 fit into that criteria well?
Thanks for the help!
