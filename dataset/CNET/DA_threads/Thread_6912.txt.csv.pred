1.1.1	I have a Gateway laptop (Windows Vista) with a built-in wireless receiver.	St
1.1.2	I like to work outside (mall food court, park, sidewalk cafe, etc.)	St
1.1.3	and cannot always get a good signal from the nearby free wi-fi transmitters.	St
1.1.4	Could someone recommend an external antenna/receiver, that is plug and play via a USB connection, to help receive the weak signals?	St
1.1.5	Thanks, AC	St
1.2.1	http://www.cantenna.com/laptop.html	St
1.3.1	its called best buy.	St
1.3.2	jsut go look.	St
1.3.3	there will be usb wireless adaptors in the computer section.	St
1.3.4	ask somebody.	St
1.3.5	and its alright the get the cheapest one, they all work more or less the same.	St
1.4.1	For my own sanity, I will ask a seemingly &quot;Wi-fi for Dummies&quot; question: Plugging in an &quot;Advanced Wireless USB Adapter&quot; like the Hawking Technology antenna or the Dynex Adapter will not conflict with the antenna already inside my laptop?	St
1.4.2	By conflict I mean the laptop deciding which antenna receiver to use.	St
1.4.3	I assume Windows Vista will give me the choice which to use... or can/will both antennas be used ?	Ques
1.4.4	Thanks	Polite
1.5.1	I could use one or the other depending on my need...	St
