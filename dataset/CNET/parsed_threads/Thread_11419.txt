<s> I am a writer and have accumulated a large number (into the thousands) of files over the years that are all very precious to me - songs, poems, parts of my novel - from a number of systems. </s>
<s> Two laptops, and three PCs. </s>
<s> Before I left for college last year, I wanted to combine all these files into one place. </s>
<s> I bought a Western Digital 1 Terabyte MyBook. </s>
<s> I put all of my pictures, music, and documents on there. </s>
<s> It took up around 200 GB. </s>
<s> However, now, most of the files are inaccessible. </s>
<s> Some still are, but more than not are causing errors. </s>
<s> When I try to open word documents I get the message: &quot;cannot start the converter mswrd632.&quot; Trying to move or copy documents to another drive: &quot;the directory or file cannot be created.&quot; Open a picture: &quot;a suitable graphics importer could not be found.&quot; What the heck?! </s>
<s> Why does NOTHING open, copy, or transfer? </s>
<s> These files are very important to me. </s>
<s> I thought Western Digital would be a reliable brand - but this is driving me off the wall! </s>
<s> That nothing looks to be lost. </s>
<s> However the error messages are well discussed so I won't tackle them all. </s>
<s> Except that one -&gt; &quot;the directory or file cannot be created.&quot; This one is common on drives that the top directory has become full. </s>
<s> To get around this, remove some file or folder and create a new folder then put your stuff in folders in that folder. </s>
<s> --&gt;&gt; But that's not why I write here. </s>
<s> It appears you are repeating the BIG MISTAKE many make and that is to think this thing is STORAGE. </s>
<s> It's not that reliable so keep a few spare copies on other media and locations of what you can't lose. </s>
