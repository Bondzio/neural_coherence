Not much was revealed so only generic and dodgey answers are possible. I will note that for me, XP glides onto new hardware if it's good stuff. Many won't update the BIOS since they think it's a new board. What they don't know is it was made on a production line and stuffed in a container to float across the ocean. Along the way, bugs in the BIOS are found and fixed. The system builder is the person that gets to update such. Tell more about the machine, the power supply rating and if you can run on one stick of RAM, one CDRW/DVD drive and no USB parts. Bob

Everything is basic until the O/S starts analyzing what you have and that's when conflicts cause problems. Make sure the CDROM and hard drive are not in contention (master / slave) if on same cable. Make sure settings on motherboard are correct. Are you upgrading or a new install. So many possibilities.
