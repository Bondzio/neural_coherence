Diablo 3 also looked like that but Path of Exile was fine. I even played for a minute, ran smoothly. I upgraded windows 8.original to 8.1 on Sunday but had no problems all of yesterday with Civ 4. I have no clue what to try. I have 8 gigs of DDR3 1333 memory. My video card is the NVIDIA Geforce GT 610.

While the 610 is about as low as you can go for a gaming card, if it worked on Windows 8 it's time to go back to the setup that worked until your machine's maker catches up with drivers and more. Bob PS. No. I don't expect good gaming experiences on the 610.
