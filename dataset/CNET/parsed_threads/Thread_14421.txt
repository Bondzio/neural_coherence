<s> My daughter's computer has been acting up lately. </s>
<s> It's old and slow anyway, so I decided to move my previously planned upgrade ahead by a few months in order to give her the Dell 8200 I'm currently running. </s>
<s> Each system has 2 hard drives. </s>
<s> The secondary drive on each holds all the data. </s>
<s> The primary drives hold only programs. </s>
<s> What I plan to do is swap Abby's secondary drive into the 8200. </s>
<s> I'll remove my secondary drive and put that into the new XPS when it arrives. </s>
<s> This should be just a screwdriver job, correct? </s>
<s> WinXP should recognize the drives all by itself? </s>
<s> There is one complicating factor: the new XPS ships with a serial ATA HDD. </s>
<s> The secondary drive I want to put into it is an EIDE. </s>
<s> I already bought a controller card for the old drive. </s>
<s> Is there anything I should look out for? </s>
<s> The whole point of this exercise is to save myself the trouble of copying all this data over our LAN. </s>
<s> By the same token, it would be a bad thing if I lost the contents of either of these drives. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for any helpful advice. </s>
<s> i believe the computer that you have is shipped with a SATA connector for your HDD and that the Optical drives (DVDROM/CDROM) are actually attached to an IDE connector using an IDE cable usually a flat and gray cable, the other one or the middle socket of such cable (usually for the slave) should not be in use, so that you could use/attach the old HDD. </s>
<s> anyway, it's just a matter of connection availability. </s>
<s> can i have the specs of this XPS? </s>
<s> is that from dell? </s>
<s> i believe it has an IDE connector native to the MOBO. </s>
<s> goodluck. </s>
<s> You are exactly right about the optical drives. </s>
<s> I hadn't (but should have) thought of them. </s>
<s> Since there are 2 optical drives on the XPS, I've already used those 2 channels, but by nature of their presence, can I assume that I won't have to worry about drivers for the new IDE controller card? </s>
<s> When I've just added new hard drives to systems in the past they always shipped with all this software I didn't need anyway, at least for WinXP. </s>

<s> card as the &quot;controller&quot; for your IDE drive. </s>
<s> Like so many newer systems the XPS only has a single IDE port [2 drive]. </s>
<s> No reason that shouldn't work. </s>
