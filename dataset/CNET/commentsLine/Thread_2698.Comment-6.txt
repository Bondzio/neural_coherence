but i try to never duplicate web content like how to partition in xp or vista.
let's find some pages on that.
yes!
the very first link is about how to use the vista partitioning tools.
after i have removed the old partition i create it anew and format it (quick mode if possible).
again it does not matter if firewire works on your camcorder.
try usb if you fail on the firewire link.
