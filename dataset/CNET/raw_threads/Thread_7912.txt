I would like to keep using my Dell M1110 monitor, 1998 vintage with a 21&quot; (19.7&quot; visible) screen. At least until a reasonably priced, 19&quot; LCD becomes available. The monitor works well in conjunction with my current computer, a Dell XPS R450. Will there be problems, disadvantages using this monitor with new equipment?

You may have to set the video card to be within the capability of the display, but in short this issue is a non-issue. Bob
