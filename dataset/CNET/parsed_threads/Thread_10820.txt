<s> I am thrilled with my new Canon Pixma MP 600 it seems to do everything I want it to do very quickly, quietly and efficiently. </s>
<s> It takes up much less space than a printer plus copier. </s>
<s> It looks great and its fun to use. </s>
<s> BUT, I have not had a good picture out of it yet. </s>
<s> Can you tell me why my prints have vertical white lines all along the picture please? </s>
<s> Also, regardless of the vertical white lines the picture quality is nowhere near as good as on the computer screen, the picture is not cleanly cut, it seems slightly fuzzy. </s>
<s> I have read that it is best to use Cannon paper for good results but even that would not cure the white line problem! </s>
<s> Try cleaning and aligning the print heads under the maintenence area. </s>
<s> I have a MP600 and my picture quality is great on the two types of paper I have used. </s>
