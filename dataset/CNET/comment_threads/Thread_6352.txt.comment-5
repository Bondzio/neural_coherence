I shorted the green and black wires on the PSU and it worked, but there's something I don't understand: should the PSU be on as long as the two wires are touching, or should it continue to work after they have been separated?
When I tried it, it would only function when the two wires were touching.
I have already taken everything off of the motherboard and hooked it up to the PSU, and it still would only work for a second.
