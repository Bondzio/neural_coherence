<s> I have a Netgear WPN824 wireless router and three laptops. </s>
<s> The newest laptop is about 2 years old. </s>
<s> I know that the recommendation when enabling wireless network security is to not use WEP because it is too easily broken. </s>
<s> Assuming that I am using a router that supports higher protocols, how can I tell if my wireless devices support the higher protocols as well? </s>
<s> If not, is it just a matter of upgrading firmware or would I have to replace the device? </s>
<s> I subscribe to the theory that some deterrent is better than none. </s>
<s> I'd use WEP if that is your only option. </s>
<s> The WAP (often a wireless router) will have its supported encryption protocols listed in its product specifications on the manufacturer's website. </s>
<s> Note that your wireless network adapters must support the same protocol to connect using the WAP's enabled protocol. </s>
<s> Check a firmware update's descriptions at the manufacturer's website to determine just what the update does. </s>
<s> All of the 802.11 standards, whether it be a/b/g, supports WEP and WPA. </s>
<s> I assume your your laptops are using one of these Wi-Fi standards? </s>
<s> Therefore if your router offers WPA, use it. </s>
<s> It's my understanding that a particular 802.11 standard may include a lot of features, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they all are implemented in every wireless device. </s>
<s> An example: If I implement WPA encryption on my wireless router and my wireless network adapter in my computer only supports WEP, then I can't connect. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, some adapters don't have firmware updates that add newer abilities, such as WPA or WPA2. </s>
