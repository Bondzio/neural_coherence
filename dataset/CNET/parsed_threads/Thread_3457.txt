<s> Hello everybody, I wanna upgrade my 5 years old laptop with a desktop computer for doing graphic design (not multimedia). </s>
<s> Basically I would like to build a desktop making use of the latest technology hoping to have a system to comfortably work with on years to come. </s>
<s> What configuration/parts should I consider? </s>
<s> I believe a budget up to 3000 is reasonable, could be more if some more expensive parts can give me a boost in performance/productivity. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Wait for Windows 7 to show up and consider that for Graphic Design we always show a Huey. </s>
<s> See http://www.pantone.com/pages/products/product.aspx?pid=79 It's hard to imagine a 'graphic designer' without this. </s>

<s> Hi I would wait not only for win. </s>
<s> 7 but by this spring, intel is coming out with more core i7 cpus. </s>
<s> As well, here it gets intresting. </s>
<s> More and more we are seeing gpu based processing. </s>
<s> some sre out now, which take the load off the cpu. </s>
<s> Just look at some of the gpus out now Gforce 285-295, ATI radeon saphire series, like the hd4870. </s>
<s> Botum line? </s>
<s> The more processing done via the gpu the better. </s>
<s> I`m building one soon. </s>
<s> Core i7 940 @ 293ghz, (I wont pay double for the extreme just for an xtra .2ghz) I haven`t picked out which x58 mobo to use, 6gb corsair ddr3 ram, Dual nvidia gpus, 1100w psu, etc. </s>
<s> I`m into 3d graphic design, (Mostly for automotive parts design) Only one thing missing. </s>
<s> A very good touch screen. </s>
<s> So you can manipulate objects with a stylus. </s>
<s> Wonder how much something like that costs? </s>
<s> Now; as soon as I sell my blackbird I can start building! </s>
<s> Let us know how it goes. </s>
