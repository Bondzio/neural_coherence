<s> I'm running Windows XP with the Minolta driver. </s>
<s> This printer was working fine with Windows 98 (And my second computer was also printing to this printer fine under WinXP) Now I've updated the Win98 computer to WinXP (Not an upgrade, a full install of WinXP Pro on a clean drive) I've downloaded the driver from TWO different locations and I get the same results both times. </s>
<s> When I try to print a page on the internet, I get page 1, followed by a blank page and then pages 2+ never print. </s>
<s> The print job is stuck in the Que and won't print. </s>
<s> I don't have a banner page selected and I've tried setting all the Processor options with worse results. </s>
<s> (Usually the job won't print at all.) </s>
<s> Lastly, when I go into the Printing Defaults, I get the strangest looking page! </s>
