1.1.1	My computer is very loud and noisey..	St
1.1.2	It make a humming sound most of the time , but then other times it can be so noisy you can hear it from downstairs .	St
1.1.3	How can I make it silent , or at least close to .	St
1.1.4	I have an Asus P5GD1 motherboard ( intel P4 HT with 3.2GHz ) , 1GB of DDR RAM , 200 GB S-ATA 7200rpm 8MB Hard Drive , ATX Med Tower Case with 400W power , LiteOn 16X Double Layer DVD +/- RW , Asus PCI Exp Powered by ATI X300 w/126MB , and im running Windows XP Home Edition .	St
1.1.5	Thanks for your help .	Polite
1.2.1	Most likely all that noise is coming from the case fan I just build a sempron based system with the help from my cousin .	St
1.2.2	The cpu fan is really quiet , so I 'm assuming it is coming from the case .	St
1.2.3	Lets say it is the cpu fan or the case fan or both you do have the option of using watercooling devices this site has a good how to about purchasing and installing a watercooling device if that is not your cup of tea then i would get something in between an internal liquid fan .	St
1.2.4	You might want to check the section about watercooling and check it out .	Sug
1.2.5	I was thinking about doing it myself but I do n't have the guts to do it myself .	St
1.3.1	In all liklyhood , a fan or two maybe getting old .	St
1.3.2	Its either worn down or so dust cluttered its become unblanced .	St
1.3.3	That alone willl wear a fan down and cause the bearing and blades to be too noisy .	St
1.3.4	The only true cure is to replace .	St
1.3.5	Open side cover or system casea and find any fans causing problems and replace .	St
1.3.6	-OR- find tyhe noise source and proceed from there .	St
1.3.7	Buy a & quot ; quality & quot ; fan and install them .	St
1.3.8	Google for fan sources , plus make sure your power supply has n't goner bonkers as well , it 's not readily seen so check it too .	St
1.3.9	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	three words : Zalman !	St
1.4.2	Zalman !	St
1.4.3	Zalman !	St
1.4.4	replace all of your case fans and cpu fan with Zalman heatsinks and fans .	St
1.4.5	They specialize in silent air cooling for your PC .	St
1.4.6	If you felt comfortable doing so you could also go the watercooling route , but that would be much more expensive and require a pretty high comfort level on your part , tinkering with the insides of your computer .	St
1.4.7	So in short : for the novice to intermediate computer builder I 'd suggest Zalman air cooling , for advanced users with more cash to spend then go watercooling	St
1.5.1	Thanks everyone for your help !	Polite
1.6.1	Yes Zalman is teh win and is full of sexy .	St
1.6.2	ooh all copper heat sinks .	St
1.6.3	Powersupplies make a bit of noise as well .	St
1.6.4	i dont know about anyone else but i like RoseWill for power supply units	Ques
