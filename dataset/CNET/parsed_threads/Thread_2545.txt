<s> My computer turns on but the monitor will NOT turn on. </s>
<s> The keyboard flashes randomly and the harddrive does NOT turn on. </s>
<s> But if i unplug it from the MB it will turn on with just power from the power supply. </s>
<s> The green light is lite on the mother board and the fans are working. </s>
<s> I Im thinking its the motherboard or its a virus. </s>
<s> I tried taking out the video card and puting it directly to the MB, still didnt work. </s>
<s> My computer is a 1.8 p4 cpu with a intel desktop board, 512 ddr, and 256 gforge video card, and 160 gig harddrive </s>
<s> cause the problems you describe. </s>
<s> Well I was playing a game when the computer shut off earlier that day. </s>
<s> when it shut off the power would turn on and off really quick so i decided to unplug it. </s>
<s> The fan from the power supply was making a real loud noise for the past few days proior to it crashing. </s>
<s> So I thought it was the power supply, so I ship a new tower with a 450 wat power supply, and had it tested before it got shiped. </s>
<s> I put the computer together correctly (checked at least 20 times to make sure). </s>
<s> The computer turned on but the monitor didnt and keyboard flashes, like before. </s>
<s> Here's the rub, if your PSU failed or is weak and starting to fail, it may take other componets with it. </s>
<s> -OR- in the same vein degrade so much that when the PSU is replaced, its too late, the other componets are weak and probably fall down. </s>
<s> In your case, the unplugging of the AC cord, allows the start ckt. </s>
<s> to de-energize and makes relays truly turn OFF, thus then power is applied and power-ON started it energizes and system starts a boot-up, however, those same relays are weak, and won't work properly when restarted unless repeated attempts or NOT. </s>
<s> The logic ckt. </s>
<s> that applies here has failed. </s>
<s> You replaced the primary fault(PSU) but secondary problems arise and in some may cause the new PSU to fail as well, its a domino effect at times. </s>
<s> sorry... tada -----Willy </s>
