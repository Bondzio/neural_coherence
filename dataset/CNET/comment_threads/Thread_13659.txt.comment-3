Thank you, those are both great deals.
I have started thinking about getting a new card.
The only reason I didnt already was because I have a 3 year warranty with PNY.
Out of those two you showed, I would perfer the one with the heatsink and fan (8800GS) just to prevent future overheating.
I havent heard nice things about the &quot;Silent&quot; cards.
Any other suggestions
