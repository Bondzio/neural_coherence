1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	Irfenview A very easy and FREE photo-editing program that will fit on a floppy .	St
1.7.1	Both disk fragmentation and registry problems can ruin computer performance .	St

1.9.1	Acronis True Image 9+	St
1.10.1	Whenever I help one of my friends with their computer , I install SpywareBlaster , Spybot-Search & Destroy , and Ad-aware .	St
1.10.2	If they do n't have antivirus protection , I install AVG Free .	St
1.10.3	On my own computer , I also have Atomic Clock Sync , Moffsoft FreeCalc , Notesholder Lite ( handy reminders and notes ) , ShortKeys Lite ( simple way to enter things like often-used addresses ) , Weatherbug , Webshots , Citi Virtual Account Numbers ( from my Citibank credit card service ) , Auction Sentry for eBay , and Photoshop Elements .	St
1.10.4	On my kids ' computer , I also have Webroot Spy Sweeper for additional protection with scheduled updating and scanning for spyware threats .	St
1.10.5	The vast majority of my favorite utilities are free .	St
1.11.1	A great way to selectively synchronize your files across two or more machines is Allway Sync : http : //www.allwaysync.com I need regular access to certain files from both machines , and I wo n't always be connected to the network with my laptop .	St
1.11.2	This free utility has been a real boon .	St
1.11.3	There are various automation features , but I just have a couple of separate jobs I created that I manually initiate at the end of the day .	St
1.11.4	Not only does it ensure that the files are in sync , but you have the added benefit of an automatic backup onto another machine .	St

1.13.1	time well wasted	St
1.14.1	My take is if you can understand what they 're saying and it 's presented clearly ( counter i.e. , the 3 page review w/o a single paragraph break or period .	St
1.14.2	) , let it go .	St
1.14.3	Some ppl post so much that in haste , they make typos from time to time .	St
1.14.4	For others , English ai n't their native language .	St
1.14.5	The fact that the latter could actually converse on these english forums is impressive enough .	St
1.14.6	I would much rather receive a reply that has its fair share of typos and spelling mistakes , and grammar woes like & quot ; their & quot ; , & quot ; there & quot ; , & quot ; they 're & quot ; , and & quot ; theyre & quot ; that are helpful and answer questions to those with correct spelling and grammar that do n't really contribute anything .	St
1.14.7	Of course there is a limit to how much can be tolerated , as there is a threshold where a post is just unreadable , but IMO , this thread is n't the case	St
1.15.1	some of these may not be utilities , but I 'll let you folks be the judge of that .	St
1.15.2	* = freeware MinMaxExtender aka mmext .	St
1.15.3	If you 've used Mac OS or linux before , you know that windows are capable of more than just minimized , maximized , and restore .	St
1.15.4	This utility also lets you maximize vertically , maximize horizontally , set a window to alwasy be on top , shade ( just leave the title bar ) , and even minimize windows to system tray .	St
1.15.5	ScreenPrint32* takes screenshots .	St
1.15.6	Let 's u save images in 4 major formats , whole screen or partials , and even to set naming schemes Magnifier* this basic utilty comes with Windows .	St
1.15.7	When i wan na zoom in on pictures or text , it 's quicker to use this than to DL and blow it up in M $ Paint and Fax Viewer IconConverter Not a necessity , but now that I have it , I can spice up my folders and desktop icons with custom icons VirtualDub* compress , convert , and tweak ( screen size , aspect ratios , filters ) video clips winzip 7-zip* may be better for file compressions , but I 'm already used to this , and it 's paid for too .	St
1.15.8	winrar again , I got winrar before i heard about 7-zip .	St
1.15.9	Otherwise , 7zip would probably have replaced winzip and winrar WinAmp* I do n't do anything fancy other than basic playlists , equilizer settings , and skins SpyBot search & destroy* + Ad Aware* scans and removes ad/spyware and configures settings prevent/block 'em as well Norton AntiVirus 2005 It work 's adequately for now .	St
1.15.10	In the future , maybe I 'll switch to Avast* , AVG* , or some other freeware AV apps if the renewal fee for NAV becomes ridiculously high .	St
