<s> I have a scan disk cruzer flash drive, and sometimes I can save to it and sometimes not. </s>
<s> Sometimes I can move from my hard drive to it and sometimes not. </s>
<s> I generally get the message that the directory of file cannot be created. </s>
<s> I've got room on the disk, any idea what's up? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> The host machine may be NTFS which allows some name that isn't allowed on the SANDISK drive. </s>
<s> Too bad you didn't share the gritty detail of the names. </s>
<s> It's also possible to overflow the ROOT DIRECTORY of a filesystem. </s>
<s> How many files and directories are in the ROOT? </s>

<s> Hi Jeff, Just wondering if you got an answer to this question. </s>
<s> I seem to be having the same problem. </s>
<s> I have data stored on a ScanDisk cruzer mini 256MB, I can see it there and it will not let me transfer it to a file. </s>
<s> Ugh! </s>
<s> I haven't had that problem, thank God. </s>
<s> I moved some things off it, and it seems to be working fine. </s>
<s> Maybe it was fuller than it indicated. </s>
<s> I have had that problem w/CD roms, however. </s>
<s> Never been able to solve it. </s>
<s> I have the same problem. </s>
<s> Unfortunatly, Cruzer Scan Disk offers absolutely NO support. </s>
<s> Did you ever get an answer to correcting the 'file cannot be created' ? </s>
<s> Jeff, Were you ever able to resolve the &quot; cannot create file&quot; issue. </s>
<s> I have the same situation, and unfortunately Cruzer Scan Disk offers NO, NONE, completely void, Help. </s>
<s> If they have a tech site, I'll be damned if I can access it. </s>
<s> Did you read what I did? </s>
<s> I wonder if it's the same issue I noted. </s>
<s> I have no idea what you did. </s>
<s> My flash disk is 1 GB, ~~ Properties show 650 MB used, 350 MB free. </s>
<s> In attempting to add ANY file, I recieve the error &quot; the directory or file cannot be created&quot; I have Win XP. </s>
<s> Obviously I was able to. </s>
<s> initally write on the disk and can read the existing files I created on it. </s>
<s> Could I have accidently changed the file sysyem ? </s>
<s> File System properties shows my &quot;C&quot; drive NTFS but the &quot;F&quot; Drive (flash disk) is FAT. </s>
<s> In this discussion I noted how to create the issue. </s>
<s> Hope that helps. </s>

<s> Proffit mentionned it in passing in one of his other replies, but for some reason there is a limit to the no/size of files you can have in the root folder. </s>
<s> Create a new folder (if necessary delete a file to allow you to do this), then use this folder for you extra files. </s>
