<s> This is a Dell Dimension 8200 with 256 RAM. </s>
<s> It has a 30GB drive that was pre-installed, a Maxtor 120GB drive that I installed, a Liteon DVDROM LTD163, and a HL-DT-ST CD-RW GCE-8400B CD drive. </s>
<s> I turned off the computer, took out the 120 GB drive, restarted the computer, used it a few times, and noticed that the CD drives were not working: they showed up in Device Manager as having damaged configurations in the registry. </s>
<s> I tried uninstalling the drivers, but that didn't work. </s>
<s> What should I do? </s>
<s> Check the jumper configuration and BIOS settings, then from device manager uninstall both the drives and scan for hardware changes. </s>
<s> Both the drives will be detected and installed automatically. </s>
<s> You probably unseated the connections when you removed the hd. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
