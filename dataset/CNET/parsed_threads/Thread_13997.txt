<s> Hello All I'm looking to purchase a 500 GB external hard drive to do backups. </s>
<s> My computer is Win XP SP3 with USB 2.0 ports. </s>
<s> I have Norton Ghost v 15. </s>
<s> I've researched and have seen both good and bad for both Seagate and WD drives. </s>
<s> Realizing individuals wants/needs/opinions are specific to an individual, I would like some feedback on what people think of the above manufacturers and the various drives they produce. </s>
<s> I'm leaning towards a Desktop external rather than a portable, just for the sake of the Desktop having a connection to a power supply that's not the computer. </s>
<s> This drive would be used once a week, explicitly for backing up the internal drive. </s>
<s> However, I am not adverse to purchasing 2 drives and doing a 'double' backup every week. </s>
<s> Any comments are appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Given the choice of either Seagate or WD, I would choose WD every time without hesitation. </s>
<s> All three Seagate external drives I had failed within 9 months &amp; started behaving erratically well before that. </s>
<s> By contrast, my WD replacements have given me no trouble at all. </s>
<s> I have a WD Elements which I was suppose to use as a backup but got lazy and used it twice when visiting my brother in another state who would put movies etc on it. </s>
<s> Found on a the second trip I could not drag or copy anything off it. </s>
<s> Had I/O error had it checked and told it was not going to work. </s>
<s> My brother is advising me to get a 1t seagate passport as he thinks WD's are rubbish but I see the consensus is divided. </s>
<s> I have been looking at the WD My Book Elite 1t but I am so confused what to get. </s>
<s> I am not tech savvy just want to back pics and family history records. </s>
<s> thanks appreciate any advise </s>
<s> Maybe it's time to have one of each make? </s>
