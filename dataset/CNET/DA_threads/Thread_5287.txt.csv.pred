1.1.1	Good Day, I was wondering what was the best way to clean a dvd burner or dvd rom drive.	St
1.1.2	Can you use Cleaning disks, Compressed Air,etc.	St
1.1.3	I have a Dvd Rom/CD-+RW burner and a Dvd Burner.	St
1.1.4	They need to be cleaned, but I need some advice first because I don't want to accidently ruin the drives.	St
1.1.5	Any Advice?	St
1.1.6	Thanks..	St
1.2.1	Disassemble and clean the old fashioned way with qtips and alcohol.	St
1.2.2	Modern way is to toss the cleaner CD in and let it do its thing.	St
1.2.3	With dual layer 18X lightscribe DVDRW drives at under 35 bucks we can't have the techs do this right anymore.	St
