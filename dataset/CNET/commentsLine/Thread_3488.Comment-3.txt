thanks for the &quot;reduce the hertz&quot; messege.
it was at 60hz when the flicker began, and as it worsened.
i changed it to 75hz yesterday and it worked fine for about a day, then began flikcering again.
i begins slowly and gets worse.
sometimes the screen turns red and there are lines across the screen.
any other suggestions?
