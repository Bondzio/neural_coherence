guys selling branded pcs often keep basic information like motherboard model ,chipset,psu details as topsecret .even if we ask them they wont tell.
as mentioned &quot;256mb&quot; graphic memory but what are its details like model number for example .
intel based onboard graphic solutions are not futureproof many games dont run on these even if u take the newer ones like &quot;dales&quot; so if u are living onboard go for ati amd or nvida graphic boards like for instance jetway ha07(featuring ati 3300 graphic and of course u can run many recent games on it except the ones called graphic beasts or games like crysis for example) yes assemble u r own pc ,go for amd if u r on a tight budget
