I share a computer with other family members, I have a very large music collection, and download about thiry songs a day, I would also like a little security when it comes to my music or video, and i also like to portability of the hard drives. The computer i am using has a 200GB internal hard drive, but i want my own place to dowload too. Do i really need one? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I am very new to the computer market.. Thanks
