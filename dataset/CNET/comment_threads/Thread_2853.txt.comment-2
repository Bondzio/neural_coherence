DVI-D is an older interface, normally what you'll find is DVI-I which works fine with VGA to DVI adapters.
Additionally, if the card is including adapters, likely an indicator of the adapters working (Sapphire wouldn't sell you extras that won't work with the main product, wastes their money).
One thing on using DVI to VGA adapters, ensure they are attached firmly before you attach the monitor, if they wiggle around it can actually bend their plugs (and cause various distortion on the screen).
Also, as it sounds like you wanna do multi-monitor with this X1950, remember to download HydraVision from ATI (www.ati.com) if it isn't included on the CD, it'll give you better driver-side support for multiple displays.
