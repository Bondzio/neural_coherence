1.1.1	compaq presario sr1950nx Windows Xp 2.4Ghz processor 2G ram Vid Nvida 8400 Gs The other day I was installing a new game and recieved a processor error .	St
1.1.2	This was how I was notified of this issue .	St
1.1.3	My processor has recently stopped registering as 2.4g and is now registering as a 1002.2 Mhz .	St
1.1.4	I 've been trying to find answers with little success .	St
1.1.5	I was hoping someone here would have an idea for me to try .	St
1.2.1	it 's normal for most newer CPUs to throttle down if power saving features are enabled .	St
1.2.2	download cpuid and you 'll actually see your cpu speed fluctuating .	St
1.2.3	http : //www.cpuid.com/	St
1.3.1	By 2 ways .	St
1.3.2	After the game notified me i did not have a powerful enough processor..	St
1.3.3	I opened the properties to & quot ; My computer & quot ; It told me My processor was registering at 1002.2 Mhz , then I ran a benchmark Perform test and same thing , it registered as 1002.2 .	St
1.3.4	I do not have power save turned on .	St
1.4.1	and use it to determine your cpu and its standard operating frequency .	St
1.4.2	the & quot ; specification & quot ; should be an x2 4800+ but also check the & quot ; clocks & quot ; area .	St
1.4.3	my x2 4400+ , is currently running at a core speed of 1004.6MHz , 5x multiplier , 200Mhz bus , and 1004.6Mhz HT Link .	St
1.4.4	these are typical values if cool-n-quiet is installed and running .	St
1.4.5	turning cool-n-quiet off in windows xp is somewhat counter-intuitive .	St
1.4.6	open & quot ; power options & quot ; in control panel , and choose a plan other than & quot ; minimal power management & quot ; .	St
