<s> I have previously burned a DVD-RW (Verbatin) with all of my downloaded software installation programs. </s>
<s> The DVD was previously UDF formatted using InCD Version 4.3.23.2. </s>
<s> I have previously used the DVD-RW to write to and retrieve files. </s>
<s> This time, I loaded the DVD in my drive to extract one of the files and the computer rebooted every time that I tried. </s>
<s> Ultimately, I got an error message telling me that there was a critical error on the disk and the disk would be marked as read only to protect the data. </s>
<s> However, there appears to be nothing on the DVD now. </s>
<s> When I insert it in the DVD drive, it seems to be labeled &quot;InCD Auto-Formattable&quot; I've tried to read the DVD on 2 computers with the same results. </s>
<s> Does anyone know how I can retrieve the lost data? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> InCD should be installed to read it. </s>
<s> Yes, it's not required according to some but my experience is otherwise. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Go use your backup copy. </s>
<s> DVDRW disks are all of 1 dollar here. </s>
<s> I hope your files were worth that much. </s>
<s> In closing, ISOBUSTER has worked sometimes to get the files out. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thank-you for your reply. </s>
<s> If you are inferring that I should have backed up the DVD. </s>
<s> Yeah! </s>
<s> I know that it would have been a good idea to have 2 copies of the DVD but I didn't. </s>
<s> I did try ISOBUSTER and it merely reported that the DVD was a blank disk. </s>
<s> It is my understanding that (on a hard drive) even if the file allocation table is damaged or erased that a disk recovery tool can restore files. </s>
<s> I'm assuming that something like that happened to my DVD-RW. </s>
<s> Are there any other ideas? </s>
<s> But there are copies of said files back on the machine you made the DVDRW on. </s>
<s> Time to go get those. </s>
<s> A recurring lesson is that if you want to lose files, make sure there is only one copy on one &quot;thing.&quot; -&gt; Next up. </s>
<s> Go get ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY and GETDATABACK and see what they think. </s>
<s> If blank, then it's likely that you can send it to DRIVESAVERS and for a few hundred they'll see what can be done. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks again Bob, First on the backup strategy.... </s>
<s> The files on the DVD that I'm trying to recover are original installation programs that were downloaded from the internet. </s>
<s> These programs are installed and working on my computer but the installation programs are not on the computer HDD. </s>
<s> They only existed on the DVD. </s>
<s> ....and yes! </s>
<s> It is a lesson. </s>
<s> That being said, I tried both ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY and GETDATABACK. </s>
<s> Unless, I totally screwed up, these programs will only recover data from a FAT or NTFS file system disk. </s>
<s> In fact, ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY wouldn't even recognize my DVD drive. </s>
<s> The DVD in question was UDF formatted using Nero InCD. </s>
<s> I previously did a search on &quot;UDF data recovery&quot; and found a couple of shareware programs that claim to recover data from a UDF disk but they failed too. </s>
<s> It looks like it's lost cause. </s>
<s> I'll put the experience &quot;in the bank&quot; and learn from it. </s>
<s> Thank-you again for your help! </s>
