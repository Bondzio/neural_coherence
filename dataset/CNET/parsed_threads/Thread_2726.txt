<s> Personally, I always liked 3Com but they got bought by HP. </s>
<s> We picked up a 48 port baseline model for our school. </s>
<s> Its auto-sensing, 10/100 with a gigabit uplink and has worked fine. </s>
<s> We've a couple of 24 port 3Coms and one POE used for the wireless system. </s>
<s> None have ever had a problem. </s>
<s> These are all their &quot;baseline&quot; models which are unmanaged, rack mountable and moderately priced. </s>
<s> I'll recommend 3Com any day if you can still find their products but more about your needs would be helpful. </s>
<s> We have 2MBPS Direct Internet Line ( so 2 UP and 2 Down ). </s>
<s> I am looking for a unmanaged switch nothing too complicated </s>
<s> has anybody had any issues with 3548XL-EN? </s>

<s> Since you are considering Cisco for part of your system, you might want to stick with the brand. </s>
<s> Here's a 48 port POE switch they offer. </s>
<s> I don't know the price and suspect it might make me drop over. </s>

<s> Like most cisco gear it will run forever. </s>
<s> This device is end of life and end of support so don't pay a lot for it maybe $100 All depends what you want to do with it, if you just want to hook a bunch of stuff to your router it will do fine even if you run vlans and such. </s>
<s> Note this is a managed switch, you may have to do some basic config. </s>
<s> Will review that. </s>
<s> I am not married to Cisco, I am also looking at HP Procurve unmanaged switch. </s>
<s> I really don't want any managed or smart Switches Rupesh </s>
<s> and since you mentioned VOIP, it sounds more like a business application for telephone use. </s>
<s> Digital phones need power and this is why I wondered if POE would be a better choice. </s>
<s> I think you've not given enough details as to exactly what you want to accomplish but if all you want is a 48 port un-managed switch, you are can pick any name brand that offers such and consider it to be expendable. </s>
<s> This is about $1900..WOW </s>
<s> You did say you wanted VOIP and 48 ports but what I see is a business use system. </s>
<s> If you're using VOIP type phones such as I've seen in some environments, they need to be powered by something. </s>
<s> I can't imagine 48 wall outlets so suggested the POE switch. </s>
<s> These will power phones but not all of the ports will necessarily have that power on by default. </s>
<s> You turn power on only to the ports that need to power devices and you have a maximum amount of current to work with. </s>
<s> There is some management involved with POE switches but it's not all that technical if it's just power management. </s>
<s> But, if you've already got power to all of your phones via some other method, you can still use a baseline switch. </s>
<s> I just thought this would eliminate a lot of extra wiring by getting it from the switch. </s>
<s> It's up to you since we really cannot envision the scope of the entire project. </s>
