Sounds like you are using a &quot;mono&quot; sound cable and not a &quot;stereo&quot; sound cable.
If so, the solution is to use a stereo cable.
Count the number of black (or green) rings on the 1/8&quot; (Sony) ending: 1 ring = mono 2 rings = stereo Even if you have a stereo cable, it may be faulty, so try another stereo cable.
Does another source, such as an iPod, CD player, Walkman, etc.
work with the speakers?
