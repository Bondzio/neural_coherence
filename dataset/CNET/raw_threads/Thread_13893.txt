However, on my motherboard there is a VGA port which has a cover blocking it (placed by the Manufacturer, HP). I have tried simply connecting a monitor to this port but it is not recognized. I cant find any settings on the computer to use this on board port. is there something I am missing, or is it simply not possible. I am trying to be able to have dual screen monitors, without having to use the HDMI port. Thanks.
