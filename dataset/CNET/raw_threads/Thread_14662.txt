9087	0	1292	14723	NR	mrsubway	10/29/03 11:40 PM	1.0674708E12	Frequency settings in bios	I have an Anthlon XP 1900+ CPU. In my bios, there are three setting. CPU frequency 100mhz/RAM 100mhz, CPU frequency 100/RAM 133mhz, and CPU frequency 133mhz/RAM 133mhz. Which is correct for this CPU? It seems the bios only displays the correct name for the CPU with the 133/133 setting. All else and it says 1200MHZ CPU, which I know is wrong. Still, I'd like to know.

There is a feeling that all such settings may have to vanish because it creates too many support calls. Bob

9087	3	1292	15146	15061	R. Proffitt	10/30/03 8:31 AM	1.06750266E12	Exactly.	&quot;But I don't have PC133 RAM. I have PC2100 DDR.&quot; PC133 was to note the clock rate to the memory. In (most?) DDR RAM, the numer refers to some bytes per second. The math then looks like this: clock rate times byte count on stick x double (data rate) = number OR 133 x 8 x 2 = 2,128 Since no one will note PC2128, they round it off. Bob
