i just got an hp pavillion a1510n, still not sure of what to think of it yet.
i was told it is compatible for all the new software coming up like windows vista, then of course i didnt have a computer at the time to confirm anything, considering i needed the internet to do that.
so if anyone knows how this model of computer will do in the future let me know.
And ill take any suggestions and opinions on what would be a good investment to boost my computer performance.
such as graphic cards, ect.
ect.
