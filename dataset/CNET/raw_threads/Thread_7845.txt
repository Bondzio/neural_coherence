I'm looking to buy a new computer that can handle all that video editing can do. I'm looking at an HP Pavilion a6750y. Phenom 2.3gz quad core processer, 8GB od RAM, 750 GB hard drive. I'll be uploading with a Pinnacle Dazzle Recorder thru a USB. Will this machine let me get the job done. Any suggestions?? Trying to stay under $1000.00 Thanks bobmj14120

And after a few tapes I declared &quot;This is nuts!&quot; I went and bought a simple 55 buck DVD recorder, connected it to my VCR, popped in the blank DVD+R, a tape, pressed play then record on the respective boxes and came back in 2 hours to retrieve the finished DVD. Feel free to repeat the lesson I learned. Bob

When you use the computer as the capture you can count on about 4 hours of computer work for each hour of DVD video. I'm sharing my lesson learned and a cheap fast economical solution. Bob
