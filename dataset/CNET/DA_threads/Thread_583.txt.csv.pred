1.1.1	I'm in the market for a new desktop and would like some advice on making the right selection.	St
1.1.2	My primary use is for viewing and editing photos using Photoshop.	St
1.1.3	I plan on upgrading to the most current edition of Photoshop along with the purchase of the desktop.	St
1.1.4	I won't be upgrading my monitor.	St
1.1.5	Could you make some recomendations as far as system requirements to help me select a system?	St
1.2.1	I have a HP computer with AMD 4200 duel core processor and 2 gig of ram.	St
1.2.2	I am using Photoshop CS2 and that combination seems to work great.	St
1.2.3	After I bought the computer I added the 2nd gig of ram and a 256mg video card and did see better performance.	St
1.2.4	I also do video editing through the firewire port and so far nothing seems to slow it down.	St
1.2.5	The graphics forum on CNET has a lot of good information so you might check there.	St
1.3.1	Most any new system today would probably work out for what you are looking to do - the biggest factor may be price.	St
1.3.2	If you are looking for a system with good performance you should be able to find multiple choices for around $500-600 that would come with the complete system, a 19&quot; flat panel monitor, and a basic printer.	St
1.3.3	I would start with the major OEMs such as Dell, HP/Compaq, or Sony and see what you can configure as your best price.	St
1.3.4	Don't hesitate to call them and see if they can improve the deal as well - they often have unadvertised specials and incentives that can get you a great system at a great price.	St
1.3.5	If you are looking for something specific or a certain brand and would like some more help or have other questions post back and I'll see what I can do.	St
