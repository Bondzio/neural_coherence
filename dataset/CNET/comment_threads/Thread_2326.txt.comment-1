I just had verizon come in and set up my wireless network at home.
I'm running two laptops on it and would like to run my printer through the router.
The printer is hooked up and the router recognizes that something is plugged into the ethernet port, but the ping test always fails.
I've tried adding the printer as a standard TC/IP setting, but the computer can't find the printer (I suppose because it's not communicating with the router properly).
Printer: HP Laserjet 2840 Laptop: Windows Vista Any help would be appreciated.
Networking this printer would be a great help.
Thank you
