Hi, I'm building a new system, and I'm asking for recommendations for a motherboard.
I bought a cpu/mobo combo, and got a crappy mobo.
What I'm building around is: Athlon XP 3000+ barton (333FSB) 1 gb dual channel PC3200 DDR ram (400FSB) Ati Radeon 9800 pro 256 video card Hercules gamesurround Muse 5.1 DVD sound card (is this crap ?)
Features I'm looking for are: dual bios or an easy way to en/disable dual channel for ram (depending on what I'm doing) integrated lan 2 SATA channels 4 PATA133 channels firewire I'll be running win98 and linux.
I'll be using it for gaming and video editing thanx
