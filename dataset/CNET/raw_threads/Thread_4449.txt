I would like to put my old Hard Drive in as a slave just to get some of the information off of it. Both Hard drives are SATA connections, and both have windows XP installed on them. How do I put my old Hard Drive in as a slave so that the computer doesn't boot off of it?

Usually starts with a zero. Make sure your &quot;boot&quot; drive is in the lowest number and the 'old' drive is in a higer number. POST will look at this sequentially at first. Or, as your computer is POSTing (before the Windows logo appears, your screen should give you a chance (however small) to enter setup... usually by pressing the &lt;delete&gt; key several times during this initial start-up phase. Once you are in setup... you will see the opportunity to change the boot sequence. Select your desired drive here and continue the boot-up process. Let us know, OK? regards, Jack
