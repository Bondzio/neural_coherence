Thank you for the helpful links.
It seems that all of my drivers were current except for the VIA AGP driver.
I had v4.60a now I have 4.80a...
I went through the entire hyperion 4-in-1 installation anyway.
Was this the culprit?
Nonetheless, I tested by playing several files (.avi .mp3 .mpg2 .ogm & .wmv) The system remained stable through each!
Hopefully it will remain so...
Thank you!
