<s> I am trying to connect my 820GM Media center to my tv but my TV is having trouble picking up the signal. </s>
<s> I tried the VGA output directly to the back of the TV abd I tried the S-Video both were unable to be detected by the tv. </s>
<s> It there anything on the computer I need to do to send the signal to the TV </s>
<s> Well actually there is something that you need to do to send it to your TV, first connect your cables then you need to right click on the desktop select properties, then click on the settings tab, then click on advanced, then click on displays, and then turn tv on, and click on tv power icon in the display tab. </s>
<s> this should send the signal to your TV. </s>
<s> Just wanted to sya a long overdue thanks. </s>
<s> It worked like a charm. </s>
