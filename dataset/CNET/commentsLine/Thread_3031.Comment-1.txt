hi!
i have an elements by wd 400gb external hard drive.
i have a small hard drive in my laptop, so i keep most of my information on this drive.
i'd like to share it off of my desktop computer so i can access my files from anywhere in my house, but don't want the rest of my family messing with my drive.
is there a free program to secure the drive, or even a windows utility?
i'm running windows xp home sp2 on the desktop and laptop.
thanks for your help!
