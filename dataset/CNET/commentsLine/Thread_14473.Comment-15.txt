i know you dont need the remote, and that not everyone uses it.
but i mean come on all im saying is that it was dumb for apple to do.
apple products, as i mentioned before, are more pricey, and i know the price of all the hd and memory came down.
but technology advances and therefore prices must come down, the macbook upgrades have been the same price for over 9 months, so the price drop is nice.
but still, why did apple take it out.
they used to have it, so why did the suddenly drop it out.
and ok you must agree with me on this.
it would have been nicer if apple hadnt dropped it.
even if you dont ever use it, there must be some time when you have felt like you just wanted the remote.
if you dont, just put it away somewhere, but still you have to admit it would be nicer for apple to include it in the box.
*though i do think there are more useful things they could give u. i think they should have gave you a bluetooth mouse in the remotes place.
that be nice.
