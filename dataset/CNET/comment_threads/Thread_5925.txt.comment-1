This might be a very stupid question.
but i dont get it.
dual core is supposed to be twice as fast, so if dual core is 2.6GHz does that mean its really 5.2Ghz?
if not how do you figure out if your PC can run a certain game or something?
because its all chaos to ME!!!!
please someone dumb it down for me example: game is recommended 3.0 GHz and you have a dual core AMD 5000 (2.6) does that mean it is not fast enough?
