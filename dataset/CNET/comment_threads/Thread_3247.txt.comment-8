In my confusion and worrying on planning of using WiFi, I might said something odd..
I know you gave me a good advices and tips ... That is why I welcome you to my home.
And I'm not kidding about the connection and WiFi user in my country... that is why my first concern is to get my WiFi LAN connection works, then setting the security.
Anyway please apologize for my mistake and misunderstanding, if there is still any...
Thanks again for your reminder on the important of security.
