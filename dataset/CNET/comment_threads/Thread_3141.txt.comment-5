So I tested my speakers on an external device (I don't know why I didn't think of that...), in this case an mp3 player, and for a while it was perfectly fine, and so I thought it was the computer, but I let it play for a bit longer just to make sure, and it ended up making those same sounds in the left speaker.
But the weird thing is, with the mp3 player, the sounds are much more infrequent and much less noisy than with the computer.
Also, the subwoofer isn't making any sound when the speakers are connected to the mp3 player.
One idea I just had is that it could be because the subwoofer is so close to the two satellite speakers.
It does have a sticker on the top that says that &quot;the subwoofer is not magnetically shielded and should not be played near a video display.
Placing the subwoofer on the floor under a desk is recommended.&quot; What do you guys think?
