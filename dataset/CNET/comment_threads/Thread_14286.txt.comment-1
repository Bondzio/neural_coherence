I have server 2003 and Win XP pro work stations.
I've created a policy that I want to enforce on a user that will change the work station for that individual.
I created a work station policy but want different user's to have different rights.
When I attach the server policy it does'nt restrict the work station as it should.
I must be missing something ?
