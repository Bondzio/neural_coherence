Your system is 5 years old now, and at the end stages of it's useful life, you could start having serious hardware problems with it any time now, so don't overinvest....but if you think you want to extend its life you should really consider getting a faster processor, they are quite cheap and an 800Mhz processor would definitely make a bigger difference than 256meg more memory (unless you only only 64meg now).
Memory for your older system is more expensive than for current systems, costs almost 2 times what it costs for a new system.
Adding more than 256meg of memory is unlikely to make any noticeable difference , how much do you have now, adding 128meg might make more sense, you probably won't be able to tell the difference unless you only have 64meg now, and in that case adding 256meg more would help if you are running XP, but probably won't help at all if you have Win98 or Windows ME.
Your motherboard was not originally configured for an 80GB drive, but will support it, you may need a BIOS update, unless you have updated it since you bought it.
