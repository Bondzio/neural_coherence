I'm having trouble pairing my laptop with my desktop bluetooth.
I successfully paired another device only a few days ago so I'm 99.99% certain I'm using the correct pairing key.
How can I check the pairing key on my laptop bluetooth to be sure I'm using the correct key?
P.S.
I changed it from the default key a long time ago, and I have been successfully pairing devices up until now.
