Hello every one From the past few weeks I've been facing this issue, My PC lags a lot when i open huge applications like Adobe Photoshop (or) Dreamweaver . I Installed Speedfan and i came to know that my core's are reaching temp 50C when idle and when ever i open applications like photoshop/dreamweaver the core's temperature raises to 65-70C . i am totally afraid what to do ? any suggestions please P.S : My cabinet has two built in fans to pull out the heat . but still i face the same issue . Here is a link to the image taken from Speedfan http://img217.imageshack.us/my.php?image=core2duohn4.jpg System Information generated by CPUZ . http://www.yousendit.com/download/WnBUa3ZPUzd3NUpMWEE9PQ Thanks for reading my post .

Heat problems could be related to thermal compound; to the HS Fan no longer making good contact with the CPU heat spreader or to insufficient case cooling/ventilation. RE Lagging....have you checked your system for MALWARE or checked your STARTUP for unneeded programs ? They can have a significant affect on your system performance. Use something like MSCONFIG to see what's running at STARTUP... and you can disable all programs running at STARTUP or selected programs by unchecking boxes.
