With the switch off of analogue television transmitters in the UK fast approaching, and me being a bit of a cheapskate, i was wondering if it is possible to share television from one PC to others on your wireless network. For example, i have 4 PCs, all over the house, all but one in rooms that have a TV on an internal aerial, and the other with a TV card connected to an external aerial. Is it possible to share that television over my home network (perhaps in a similar way to printer sharing), so that i could browse TV from any computer as i please, or am i going to have to pay up for more digi boxes? Thanks, Alex.
