Hi, Here is my problem.
After I restarted my computer, it stopped working.
Tried the following things, no sucess: 1- A different monitor.
2- Changed the VGA/DVI cable.. 3- Different graphics card 4- Different HD 5- Memory sticks 6- Different CPU 7- All cables Can't even see the POST.
Noting on the screen, no beep.
Nothing.
When I turn the computer on, the mouse and keyboard lit up.
Even cleared the CMOS according to Intel's support.
The MoBo is a Intel D945GNT/D945PSN.
I appreciate any help.
