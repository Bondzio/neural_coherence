<s> So I've built a heavy hardware near top of the line computer. </s>
<s> Its got Intel Core 2 Duo with Stock Fan 2GB RAM 320GB HD DVD-R Drive Stock Power Supply It won't stay on for more than like 1 or 2 minutes after I hit the power button. </s>
<s> My theory is either its overheating because the CPU fan was sort of hard to click in and seemed loose. </s>
<s> Or the fan just sucks. </s>
<s> I only have one other fan besides the stock one and I have a Zalman system cooling fan on hand that is extremely big and probably would keep the whole system layered with frost. </s>
<s> Anyone have any other ideas? </s>
<s> A new heat sink and fan, and use lots of Thermal goop. </s>
<s> at all and you'll need some thermaol grease. </s>
<s> Something's definitely wrong here. </s>
<s> If that fails to solve the problem and you're sure the HS FAN is properly installed ... here's an efficient but modestly priced CPU cooling option. </s>
