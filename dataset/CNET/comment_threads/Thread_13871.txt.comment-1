I have a cable modem that is also my wireless router.
I have a desktop connected to my router and two laptops at home.
Is there any way to log the usage of the wireless connection from the desktop?
I want to know when the wireless was used, what hours of the day (what they were using it for is less important but might be nice).
I know there are programs that I can track if I install them on the laptop, but for this case that is not possible.
Amy ideas?
