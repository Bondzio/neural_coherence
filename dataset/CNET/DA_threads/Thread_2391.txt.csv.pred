1.4.1	You have to go inside the computer .	St
1.4.2	Before you do , be certain that the power is completely OFF , by unplugging the Power supply [ or turning it off by the switch on the rear of the supply ] .	St
1.4.3	Be aware that the computer always has some power on the mobo as long as the power supply is plugged in to a hot outlet .	St
1.4.4	[ un less its switch is off ] .	St
1.4.5	When you take the cover off , be sure to touch some part of the metal chassis to ground yourself and discharge any static electricity that could damage components , Touch the metal as frequently as possible .	Sug
1.4.6	The video card , of course , is the one that has the monitor cable connected to it .	St
1.4.7	Remove the card and reinstall it physically .	St
1.4.8	The AGP socket takes considerable force to engage the card fully .	St
1.5.1	P.S .	St
1.5.2	on what Ray said .	St
1.5.3	Many MB have a small locking device on the AGP slot so you will have push a small lerver or pull a small button to get the card out .	St
1.5.4	Also it could be a memory poblem .	St
1.5.5	John	St
1.6.1	just like what you did on the video card , try reseating the memory module as well .	St
1.6.2	( these are much smaller and flat than the video card ) try to push the edge levers of the memory socket simultaneously , then CAREFULLY , insert it back following where the notches of the memory should fit and wait until a click sound or it locks up with the lever .	St
1.6.3	( YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH THE MEMORY MODULE )	St
