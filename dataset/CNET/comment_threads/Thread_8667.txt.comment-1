Good Day, I know laugh at the newbiee.. however I have the following system on order and am waiting for it to arrive.
eMachines T6524 AMD Athlon 64 3500+ 2.2GHz / 1GB DDR / 200GB HDD / Dual Layer DVDRW/ Integrated ATI Radeon Xpress 200 / Flash Media Reader / Windows XP Media Center 2005 /.
Now all that looks real pretty to me being a novice and upgrading from an HP pavilion v70s running the Windows XP Home edtion.
I also have an XBOX 360 and am wating to see how the two inter-react with each other.
I have discovered CNET and am looking for a breakdown of the specs as to what it is, what it does and and how to upgrade if possible.
I have been bouncing around seeking information.
Thanks
