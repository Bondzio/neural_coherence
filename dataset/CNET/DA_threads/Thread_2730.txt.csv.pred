1.1.3	NOTHING SHOWS UP AFTER THE FIRST &quot;LOGO&quot; troubleshooting i have already done are: resetting CMOS, trying to boot from vista dvd to reinstall OS unplugging and replugging some stuff... what happens when i start is...i see the gigabyte logo, then it shows the normal boot screen and then nothing... i didn't touch my computer and it was fine the night before... thanks for reading, i really need your help...any troubleshoot tips are welcome, thanks	St
1.2.1	Does it stop at vista splash screen or the computer bios splash screen.	St
1.3.1	First you say that after the logo nothing shows up.	St
1.3.2	Then you say that after the logo you see the normal boot screen.	St
1.3.3	That's a contradiction.	St
1.3.4	If you can't make your problem clear, you won't get effective help.	St
1.3.5	By the way, what do you mean with 'normal boot screen'?	St
1.3.6	Kees	St
1.4.1	I am currently having the same problem.	St
1.4.2	I have a self-built pc with Windows Vista Ultimate 64-bit edition.	St
1.4.3	Has been running for about 6 months with no problems, then out of the blue, when I start my computer, it will load my ASUS screen, then the Windows logo screen comes up, and it says &quot;please wait&quot; as it is loading, then the screen goes black and stays that way.	St
1.4.4	On this black screen, my cursor is still visible and I can move it around, but the screen is completely black.	St
1.4.5	I have tried many troubleshooting solutions, including: - system restore - trying a boot repair off of the Vista disc - unplugging/replugging USB components Any ideas?	St
