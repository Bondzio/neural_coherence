Where can i ask them directly via mail? i previously backed up the laptop via time machine and i can fully use it on the external display , so would a restore of system folders HELP at least rule out system errors??? i searched for similar problems but none seems to match mine because other people always had a system error , and i don't seem to have one.. Please Guys any answer might help me , i have tons of work...

Your laptop uses the same components/firmware/software to produce the video and is then directed to ALL the outputs on your laptop. ie. LCD screen and VGA/DVI connection. I suggest you call Apple in whatever country you are in and go from there. P
