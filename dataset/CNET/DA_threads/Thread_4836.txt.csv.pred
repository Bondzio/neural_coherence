1.1.1	I changed hard drives .	St
1.1.2	I had an 80 Gig and added a 160 Gig .	St
1.1.3	I left the 80 Gig the master and made the 160 Gig the slave .	St
1.1.4	Then , I used the Western Digital program that came with the 160 , Data Lifeguard Tools ( Maybe I should have used Ghost , instead !	St
1.1.5	) , to copy the files from the 80 to the 160 .	St
1.1.6	After that I switched master and slave since I wanted the 160 as the master .	St
1.1.7	I am using Norton System Works 2004 as a computer help program and have used it regularly .	St
1.1.8	When I ran it after changing HD 's around , it showed a lot of errors .	St
1.1.9	I can run the WinDoctor and it gives me a bunch of problem areas mostly Invalid Active X/COM Entries ( 100 problems ) .	St
1.1.10	Those I can automatically repair .	St
1.1.11	But the one that worries me is : Drive Change from C to E. ( 177 problems ) A removable drive has been inserted or removed , or , a director was moved to a new drive causing drive C to appear as drive E. These problems should not be fixed automatically .	St
1.1.12	If I ca n't repair them automatically , I have no idea what to do to repair them .	St
1.1.13	I did notice that when I tried to optimize , it got an error message that said it failed to open and I ca n't open it .	St
1.1.14	I do n't know if its related to all those errors or not .	St
1.1.15	Also , I noticed that MS Outlook opens up but wo n't successfully send or receive .	St
1.1.16	Also , MS Word wants to & quot ; install & quot ; and then gives and error message but then goes ahead and works .	St
1.1.17	Anyway , can you tell me what to do to help with the drive change problem ?	Ques
1.1.18	Thank you very much .	Polite
1.1.19	Jerry	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	How do you manage to keep it together ?	Ques
1.3.2	bob	St
1.4.1	I apologize .	St
1.4.2	I was n't getting a response so I thought I would rephrase the subject and better write the comment .	St
1.4.3	And then I thought I might be in the wrong area ( s ) for a response .	St
1.4.4	Anyway , I am not wanting to mess up my computer by doing something I should n't but I 'm not sure what to do and it is n't letting me do emailing through Outlook ( even though it opens up ) right now .	St
