<s> MY granddaughter has a older Compaq 7000 computer and has lost the use of both the CD and DVD drives. </s>
<s> I went into devise manager and they both have the yellow exclamation sign. </s>
<s> I uninstalled both of them and added them again in add new equipment that didn't work. </s>
<s> I removed them and did a restart that didn't help. </s>
<s> I took the side off and checked to make sure the ide cable wasn't loose all is well there. </s>
<s> I removed the drives and installed a couple I had from a old computer along with a new cable and get the same thing. </s>
<s> I changed the jumpers to cs, slave/master and that doesn't do any good. </s>
<s> It shows all the drives in bios when I use detect drives and exit command. </s>
<s> Any help would be very much appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks Wayne </s>
