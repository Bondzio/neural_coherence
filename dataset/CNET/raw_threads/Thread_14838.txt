If you mean &quot;doesn't show in My Computer and Windows Explorer&quot;, there are 2 possibilities: 1. See if it comes up in Disk Management. That means the fileystem is damaged somehow. Delete the partition(s) on the drive, make a new one and format it. 2. If it doesn't even show in Disk Management on several machines it's broken. Throw it away then. Kees

According to this article - http://www.usbtalk.net/2009/09/recovering-broken-unformattable-and-ghost-usb-flash-drives/ - it may be possible to fix your problem as long as the drive is still lighting up when you plug it in. Give it a shot, may work, just be sure to follow the instructions well cause it warns running both programs at once can cause damage, so be careful!
