It detects some cards just fine, but not my Linksys PCI wireless network adapter. At first I thought the Linksys card was dead, so I returned it and got a new one. Well this one doesn't work either. I've tried it in multiple PCI slots (including one that I know works for another card), and I get nothing. The card does not show up in the device manager, even when I tell it to search for new hardware. The install software won't run without the card detected. A) is there any sort of known problem with these newer Intel boards and Linksys cards? B) what are the odds that I got two defective cards in a row?? C) is there any sort of manual way to force this thing to work without relying on the autodetect?

If not, then you could have blown the boards, admittedly unlikely, but still possible - especially in winter when the humidity is lower, and less likely to &quot;bleed off&quot; the static buildup. Check for BIOS updates for your Motherboard, plug and play may not recognize the board if it came out after the BIOS (for configuration purposes). However, I'm reasonably certain that it should show up in the PCI scan that flashes by late in the boot sequence. There can be voltage compatibility problems in the PCI bus. Older PCI boards used +5 volts, newer ones use +3.3v. (some will auto sense, and use either) There is a slot key that prevents plugging in the &quot;wrong&quot; board, but since it was a late breaking add-on I'm believe that it won't prevent all cases of incorrect installation. Likewise for the 66Mhz key.

The card wants 3.3V, but I can't find a spec on what voltage the PCI bus is trying to source. How can I tell? I went through Intel's web site and literature with no luck ... can you tell by looking at the board????
15026	3	55353	663653	662242	holtnr	1/7/05 9:17 AM	1.10508942E12	red herring	I'm afraid my concern about voltages was a red herring in this case. It's a new MotherBoard, so it certainly should provide 3.3v, and you said thats what the card wants, therefore voltage is probably not the problem. Of course, if all your other PCI boards used +5... But I wouldn't chase it very hard. Sorry, but I'm out of ideas. You don't have another system to try it in do you?

I have an old Aptiva though PII 350 512megs of ram, 40 gig running Windows XP PRo. I've installed regular NIC's no problem, but I actully have 4 different kinds of Wireless NIC's (I'm a PC TECH) And the PC/WINXP won't detect ANY of them! It picks up all the regular NIC's no problem, but when it comes to the wireless... forget about it! I'm lost... I'm updating BIOS now, if that doesn't work i'm out of Idea's!

I'm planning on taking it into my local PC repair joint and make them put in a card. I tried updating bios, by the way. I got nuthin.
