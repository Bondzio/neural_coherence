<s> I am looking to replace a Compaq PC that is close to 5 years old (I think). </s>
<s> I would use it for internet access, downloading small Docs and Word files, writing, picture storing, and occasionally watching videos. </s>
<s> I want reliability and I will probably also replace my monitor but my space for the monitor is only 22 inches wide. </s>
<s> I have plenty of room for any size tower. </s>
<s> As an example I took a desktop and in 3 months it could not access the internet. </s>
<s> We had done nothing to the machine but it's antivirus suite expired and &quot;to be safe&quot; it shutoff any networking. </s>
<s> This is reliability? </s>
<s> Sorry but for now, there are no know reliable Windows PCs. </s>
<s> This and other issues plague this industry. </s>
<s> Can you imagine a toaster that stops working in 3 months? </s>
