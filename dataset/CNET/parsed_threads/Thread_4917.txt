<s> Hi, what limitations does the Kindle Fire have versus some other tablets? </s>
<s> I've heard it only lets you use the Amazon Apps store(although it seems to be you could use any app store with the Silk browser, I guess they're incompatible?). </s>
<s> That is the sort of limitation I'm concerned about. </s>
<s> Does the HD have these limitations? </s>
<s> Android Kindle Fire SIDE LOADING. </s>
<s> I'll not duplicate open discussions but Android tablets are all over the map here. </s>
<s> Some can't use the stores, others do, I can't keep track of the some thousand models out there but the KF HD is a great device. </s>

<s> I'm thinking of these &quot;limitations&quot; compared to say, the Nexus 7. </s>
<s> Let's compare the walled garden that is the iPad to the wild wild west of those android tablets from makers you never heard of. </s>
<s> In order from garden to wild wild west I think it's like this. </s>
<s> iPad, KF (current models), Nexus and then a long path to the no-name models. </s>
<s> Great to have choices. </s>
<s> I can't dissect all of this in 3 paragraphs and all this has open discussions so I will summarize. </s>
