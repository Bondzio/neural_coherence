i bought usb 2.0 (high speed storage) crucial technology device some years ago.
it worked fine up to the time i changed my os to windows 8 and ubuntu on my pcs.
now i can not get it to work.
i have been in touch with the manufacturers but in spite of their honest efforts to help i am non the wiser.
the driver disc was made before even xp was thought of.
it is undamaged in good physical condition but does not seem to be compatible with the current os.
is there any way i could find appropriate drivers to use it?
