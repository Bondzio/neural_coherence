any noice noticable coming from the hd isn't good but there's the outside chance it was trying to access a pgm/file that maybe corrupted or fragmented and doing alot more work to do so.
regardless, do a backup asap just to be safe.
goto the hd makers support website and get thier diags as that is the required process in order to proceed with any &quot;warranty&quot; returns provided you're still covered.
even so, the diags themselves will readily check the hd.
if a problems exists, use warranty or open wallet.
if the problem seems to be a pgm/file(s), reload them but a good hd defrag seems to be in order anyways, just get that backup done as well.
