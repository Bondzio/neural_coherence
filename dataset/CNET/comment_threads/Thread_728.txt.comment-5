Thanks for your answer.
This is exactly what I was going to do.
I'll just delete all the partitions and redo the install.
The reason why I want to partition the HD, is I want to use XP on one partition (C), Windows Server 2003 on the second and Ubuntu on the third.
I'll do a quick wipe out with DBAN and reinstall XP.
Thanks again.
