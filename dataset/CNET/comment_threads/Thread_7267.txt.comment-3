After trying to delete the reg key many times and it still not working I decided to do a system restore to the day before I first tried to install the drivers - BINGO it now works fine.
Only thing is the router is approx 10 ft away and the signal is up and down all the time.
There is only a stud wall in between the PC and router.
Bit disapointed with the performance so far..... thanks for your help bob.
