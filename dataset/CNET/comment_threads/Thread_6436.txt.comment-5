Those wall protectors are still basic protection, but better than nothing.
You can use them AND a strip surge protector(plug into) that may allow better access for AC warts and such.
I do suggest don't use all plug-ins as you may turn the AC outlet into electrical &quot;hot spot&quot;.
If you can, use yet another AC outlet.
I understand you maybe limited but its important as a safety fire issue.
If you like spend better $ on protection as you're items are high cost, its worth it.
As an added note, I put &quot;singular plug surge protector&quot; at the end of a AC cord, then into the strip or wall protector and/or UPS.
It seems redundant, but I've experienced mucho lightening hits over the yrs.. tada -----Willy
