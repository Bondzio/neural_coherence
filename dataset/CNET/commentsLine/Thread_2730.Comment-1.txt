hi, i'm new here and i have a vista pc that i built myselft.
the mobo is a gigabyte ds3 the problem i have is the os won't boot, from the hard disk or even from the vista dvd.
nothing shows up after the first &quot;logo&quot; troubleshooting i have already done are: resetting cmos, trying to boot from vista dvd to reinstall os unplugging and replugging some stuff... what happens when i start is...i see the gigabyte logo, then it shows the normal boot screen and then nothing... i didn't touch my computer and it was fine the night before... thanks for reading, i really need your help...any troubleshoot tips are welcome, thanks
