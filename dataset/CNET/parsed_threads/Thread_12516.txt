<s> is it possible to charge devices such as iPod, Psp, and cell phones without having the pc on but still pluged into the pc? </s>
<s> it has to be since computers at my school's Computer lab is able to do this. </s>
<s> I also read about self powered usb hubs could i plug my devices into it and be able to charge them with out having the computer on or having the hub not being pluged into the computer? </s>
<s> USB chargers satisfy your needs? </s>
<s> PCs that will offer startup by mouse or kbd might do this but I've not seen that on USB. </s>
<s> The current isn't generally sufficient for charging with the PC turned off. </s>
<s> i know that there are usb chargers but im just asking about if it was possible and if self powered usb hub could charge devices alone </s>
<s> You'd have to know their specs and test them. </s>
<s> What you'd be looking for is how much current they offer versus a standard charger. </s>
<s> As well, a good charger will sense the amount of current being drawn and adjust itself accordingly. </s>
<s> USB attachment to a PC or non-dedicated charging device may work...or work somewhat...but this isn't a substitute for a proper charger. </s>
<s> If you read the usual USB spec, the power should be off until a PC commands the hub to power up. </s>
<s> Of course there may be a hub that doesn't meet the USB specs. </s>
<s> Because of this I picked up a wall mount USB charger. </s>

<s> Why not get that? </s>
<s> Here's something similar to what I use: http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=5750794 </s>
<s> Google for &quot;charging station or dock&quot; should get you in the right direction. </s>
<s> The key for your needs is the flexibility of various different connections and/or universal one if supplied(adapter?). </s>
<s> http://www.cpdocks.com/ Of course, if your university/school uses such, why not see what they use. </s>
<s> You may find that such a station may offer to charge only similar same devices because so many devices get used and returned to be charged. </s>
