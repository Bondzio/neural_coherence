I have a Gateway Select 1000 running ME and it locks up continuosly the first 5-10 minutes after startup.
If I let it run for 10 minute and then re-boot or leave it on it works flawlessly.
I've done a complete re-install of Windows ME to make sure it isn't a software problem.
I feel this is hardware problem effected by heat.
Is there a way to check the possibilties without bringing it in?
