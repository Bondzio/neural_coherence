<s> Greetings, I have been using a WD external hard drive for over a year now with no problems. </s>
<s> Today I have suddenly ran into one. </s>
<s> After restarting my computer the drive no longer shows up in Windows Explorer. </s>
<s> Device manager shows the drive as connected and working properly. </s>
<s> The problem is not just with windows explorer. </s>
<s> For example, if I try to play a song on iTunes (all of my music is stored on that drive), iTunes can no longer find the song file. </s>
<s> I have restarted my computer and switched usb ports but neither step helped. </s>
<s> I am running XP SP2. </s>
<s> Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks, Dan </s>

<s> Thanks for the link. </s>
<s> I tried that, but it did not help. </s>
<s> I should also note that I have tried this on two different computers, with two different cables for both, and continue to have the same problem. </s>
<s> Where I note the usual names. </s>
<s> Getdataback, Zero Assumption Recovery have demos to see if they can help. </s>
<s> In other discussions we find we remove the drive and put it in a new case. </s>
