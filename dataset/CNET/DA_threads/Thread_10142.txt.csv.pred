1.1.1	My friends Fan burnt out in his laptop.	St
1.1.2	He was going to have it replaced but the company that was going to do it was going to charge $250.	St
1.1.3	Is an external cooling source an acceptable alternative.	St
1.2.1	That fan is vented directly to the processor.	St
1.2.2	An external fan will not be.	St
1.2.3	A fried processor will be the result.	St
1.2.4	With a little investigation, and small tools, the fan might be replaceable by the owner.	St
