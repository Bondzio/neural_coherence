1.1.1	I installed a new wireless optical mouse.I have a windows 7-64 bit.	St
1.1.2	The install went ok,I check it out and where the other mouse was installed and the message said that this is operating fully.	St
1.1.3	I checked the drivers,and they where install and up to date.It's a Labtec mouse,made in china.	St
1.1.4	The question is, why wont it work?	St
1.1.5	The battery light is on,I push the reset button under it.	St
1.1.6	I need some help with this one.	St
1.2.1	Assuming that you installed the drivers that came with it, and that the drivers are 64-bit compatible, it seems that either the receiver or the mouse itself is defective.	St
1.2.2	For a new mouse this means that you return it under warranty.	St
1.2.3	If the driver doesn't work with 64-bit Windows 7 that's also reason to return it.	St
1.2.4	Kees	St
