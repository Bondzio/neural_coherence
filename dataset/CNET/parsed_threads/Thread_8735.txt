<s> You didn't reveal what CABLE MODEM you are going to use it with. </s>
<s> That 12.99 shipping looks a tad high. </s>
<s> Have you used USPS shipping. </s>
<s> I shipped something like that from/to US-&gt;Canada for half that. </s>

<s> I was going to use it with an RCA modem thought was given to me by Comcast. </s>
<s> By the looks of it though, I do not think I will be able to use it. </s>
<s> I emailed the guy about the shipping cost and he said that he is mailing it in a medium flat rate box and that USPS charges around twelve dollars for it. </s>
<s> It looks to me the usual router that I would use with the usual cable modem. </s>
<s> Ask the seller if they are providing setup support. </s>
