no!
no reason to regret the purchase later for having integrated graphics.
with integrated graphics the computer builder/seller is able to give you a very affordable machine.
when they build a machine such as the one you're buying they have no way knowing exactly what it will be used for.
buying/building them this way allows them to get the computer out the door cheaper to you!
after you buy this machine you can then upgrade the graphics card as time and money allow.
you may be able to play the games you want just fine with the integrated graphics, and you may be able to adjust the integrated graphics solution to suit you.
if you're a gamer or getting into gaming you probably already know that many games require more memory/processing intense graphics cards.
choosing a proper upgrade can be helped by taking the time to research a potential card before purchasing.
with time on your side, you can make a good decision on that upgrade if and when it becomes necessary.
not long ago 256mb of memory in a graphics card was pretty hefty.
what you'll find once you begin your search is that graphics cards and games are way ahead of the curve in the processor/memory department compared to your basic desktop.
in other words the games are processor intense and the graphics cards have to be intense to play those games.
i'd say the standard now is more like 1gb of ddr5 memory.
amazingly with all their improvements, a decent graphics card is still pretty affordable.
so unless you are playing older games or mildly intense games, then plan on doing an upgrade.
and really take your time to research which graphics card to upgrade to.
good luck!
