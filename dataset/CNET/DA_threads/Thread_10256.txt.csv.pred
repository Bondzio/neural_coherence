1.3.1	I suspect that the HD in the original system was n't readable or available , it will repeat the same problem on another system .	St
1.3.2	If that 's the case , then what is the original problem or reason to try to recover data .	St
1.3.3	Once , that 's explained we can go from there .	St
1.3.4	Otherwise , you may not be resolving the real problem .	St
1.3.5	Please explain system specs and details or order to give a some resolution .	Sug

1.4.1	You 'd better try data recovery software , no matter to which computer you connect this hard drive .	St
1.4.2	I recommend you a product Data Recovery Wizard I 'm so appreciate it and it has saved me many times .	St
1.4.3	Do n't write anything new to this hard drive before you could confirm that you have recovered the files .	St
