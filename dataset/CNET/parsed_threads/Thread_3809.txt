<s> I was looking at a hec X-Power Pro 650 650W Continuous PSU. </s>
<s> It costs only $55 off new egg and it seems perfect for a gaming rig I want to build. </s>
<s> I've read the reviews but came across no horror stories, yet. </s>
<s> has anyone had experience with this PSU or others like it? </s>
<s> I'm on a tight budget and that's why it seems to perfect for me Also, does anyone know of a device that will ensure that if my PSU fails, the rest of my hardware will be OK? </s>
<s> The PSU is far more important than any other component in your system. </s>
<s> It is the basis for a stable h/w demand for power. </s>
<s> If that's lacking or compromised the system falters or fails. </s>
<s> While many PSU makers claim x-wattage rating, you should consider what your true needs will be AND add room to grow on. </s>
<s> The industry std. </s>
<s> 82%(use 75% for quick math) of label rating is what you're really getting at any given time. </s>
<s> The full measure of the labeled wattage rating is only for peak periods and they shouldn't on a constant demand level. </s>
<s> If so, your PSU is underrated and a bigger unit be sought. </s>
<s> Determine what each device draws in power and add them up, them seek a required PSU. </s>
<s> Remember, cheap is cheap. </s>
<s> There is a reason better PSUs cost more. </s>
<s> However, since so many vendors offer this and that, a good rule of thumb, find your wattage value of your system, then add 100W to it. </s>
<s> Thus if your system needs 415W, add 100W to get 515W as a basis for a decent PSU. </s>
<s> Thus, a good brandname of 550W will do fine. </s>
<s> If you find a generic brand, then anything above that 550W is what you really need, so a 600W may do OK, but again, the make-up of the PSU in question, thus why I mention &quot;cheap is cheap&quot;, above. </s>
<s> Its up to you. </s>
<s> Alas, be sure whatever PSU that it also contains the proper cabling and look for &quot;safety decals&quot; and/or tested proof its OK. tada -----Willy </s>
<s> well from what you have said, this is a cheapo PSU and should not be trusted and my other hardware depends on this thing working what would you recommend for under $100? </s>

<s> I did a lot of digging on the individual parts and came up with a modest 400 watts, rounded up and added 100 watts. </s>
<s> Is this right? </s>
<s> GPU-180 CPU-65 HDD-6 MB-200 RAM-10 Fan-10 rounded and +100 for good measure = 400 </s>
<s> is preferred as compared to what you have calculated (400w) for which, the lower it is, the more work the PSU will have to do, thus leading to more heat generating, which will create more heat. </s>
<s> Furthermore, SLi cards running on 400w is a little too weak, and if you are lucky, it will run ably. </s>
<s> I would suggest you looking for at least a 500w PSU, for future, as you may never know the possibility of adding an additional hdd, or optical drive, or even plug in more power-draining external devices and who knows, an additional GPU card. </s>
<s> This will at least covers you all possible upgrades in future, plus letting your PSU to run cooler and quieter. </s>
<s> Do check the power output is the true consistent output or the maximum segmented output (the output is can sustain is the same throughtout instead of those PSU which only can sustain a short moment as I have encountered before with my friend's) </s>

<s> You add all devices, thus all fans installed and maybe the LEDs, ram modules, etc., you get the picture. </s>
<s> That's why the extra 100W comes into play plus anything left over is the room to grow. </s>
<s> As i stated, if the rated value of the PSU is 550W, then the real dependable amount is 82% of that. </s>
<s> As i stated earlier so many makers and vendors offering, and only a small number is ever tested by some PC website like http://www.tomshardware.com should offer some clue. </s>
<s> I tend to buy Antec and if generic go into the large wattage units. </s>
<s> Thermolake has some offerings too. </s>
<s> Newegg is a good source and if they offer it, I tend to feel comfortable buying from them. </s>
