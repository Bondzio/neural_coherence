<s> Looking to purchase a quality wireless printer but hear alot about problems with setting them up. </s>
<s> Can you recommend a wireless all in one that is good for home use. </s>
<s> Most of the consumer models are 2 year devices so is that quality? </s>
<s> Or are you going for some Office version that gets you a few more years? </s>
<s> dependable for at least two years use, easy wireless set up as I'm not that great with technology, will be used to support three home computer/laptops, used primarily by my two children, college/highschool, was looking at a Canon at best buy for around 99 dollars. </s>
<s> 99 buck printers usually make it to 2 years on average. </s>
<s> So while I give the nod to HP, other makes seem to fair well at 2 years. </s>
<s> Be honest. </s>
<s> At 99 bucks there is almost no money for quality components. </s>
<s> It's all just plastic and cardboard and something that will never be repaired. </s>
