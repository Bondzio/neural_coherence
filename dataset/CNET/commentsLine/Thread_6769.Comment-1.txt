hello there, i'm running a hp g62 and trying to connect an iomega 1tb hdd and it shows up in &quot;devices and printers&quot; as usb to serial-ata bridge but not in my computer so i obviously can't access anything.
after surfing the web for an answer, everyone says i should give it a letter in computer management, but when i try the option to change the letter and path is grayed out so i can't click it=[ can anyone please help?
thankz!
