My friend has offered to build me a pc if I buy him a motherboard.
There are so many choices out there and I'm a noob anyway so I would like some suggestions.
I need a motherboard that can handle games like Age of Empires 2, Blood Bowl, Team Fortress 2, Portal 2, and other similar games.
I don't think I particularly need a gaming computer but I want something reliable and capable to get me through college.
Any feedback would be appreciated thanks.
