I have plugged the cable in but am not sure what else, if anything, I need to do. Please can anybody walk me through, at novice level, as to what I should be doing. Many thanks

Luckily, most often they put a pdf-version on the install cd also. Have a look. With all these possibilities (and cables included) you should be able to make at least one match with your TV, whatever it is. Kees

That's all. Without manuals and CD's it's somewhat more difficult than if you should have them. The basic rule: try using the same connector on both ends (be it analog, HDMI, Scart, DVI or composite video). Sorry to be of no more help. If you can't find out, take your PC and the manual of your TV with you to the shop and ask them for the right cable. That might be a good start. Then explore the settings of your video card. Kees
