Windows XP finds the drive and you can see it in &quot;my computer&quot;, but it will not read dvd disks. I can put cd rom disks in all day long and it reads them fine. but as soon as i but in a movie...nothing.. doesnt even recognize the disk. Anyone have any ideas?

Basically stop and go situation. The problem just started a couple days ago, I had no problem before. I have performed every possible test and diagnostic service that Dell provided on my computer, but to no avail. I know it's not the playback software that I am using (PowerDVD loaded by Dell) as the same problem occurs when I am using the MS Media Player or Real Player. The DVD ROM that Dell installed on my computer is Samsung SD-616T. Unfortunately my warranty has expired so I cannot get any help from Dell. Can anyone help? Please? Thanks in advance. Paul

Setting all IDE channels to PIO, and then back to DMA didn't work, however, deleting the files in the registry as suggested in the second link on the Google page did the trick, and thanks to you I am now back to normal and am very happy about it. Appreciate your help! Paul

If I insert a disc (CD or DVD)i can hear it spinning then stopping then spinning, as it would if the disc were dirty, but it happens with any disc, even brand new ones, and will not read any! Help Please
