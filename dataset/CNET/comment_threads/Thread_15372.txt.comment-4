In real world testing.
Consumer base wireless is a lot less than its spec.
I've tested some Linksys and Netgear wireless routers.
802.11B mode goes anywhere between 3-6Mbps and 802.11g mode goes anywhere between 7-9Mbps.
The &quot;rest&quot; of the bandwidth are overhead for wireless transmission.
100Mbps switch goes around 80Mbps with overhead.
