i decided to replace the power supply , the computer responded well, no problems.
i had the system temp sensor tested, it was ok. it was just the power supply itself that was running hot and malfunctioning.
everything is back to normal.
it is still running well.
p.s.
this was the first time i had a power supply unit fail in my own equipment.
this was a great lesson learned.
i know what to look for in the future.
thanks to everyone.
