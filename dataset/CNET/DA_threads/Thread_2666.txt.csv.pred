1.1.1	Hi guys , I have always used Web mail in the past so never needed Outlook Express until now .	St
1.1.2	I 'm trying to send photo attachments via Outlook Express and it is not working .	St
1.1.3	Everything is fine till I hit & quot ; send & quot ; and get an error message : Domain or Host name invalid .	St
1.1.4	I know this is probably because I set something up wrong .	St
1.1.5	But I do n't know how to fix it .	St
1.1.6	I have an isp called Intergate which makes you do alot of the installing of things yourself , where other isp 's do it for you automatically .	St
1.1.7	This leaves alot of room for error needless to say .	St
1.1.8	Can anyone tell me how to go about fixing this ?	Ques

1.2.1	Can you send and receive a plain vanilla ( no attachment ) e-mail to yourself ?	Ques
1.2.2	If yes ... .then your mail account would seem to set up correct .	Res
1.2.3	If no ... .Call your ISP ... .they have a script to walk you through every setting needed to use their mail server .	St
1.3.1	Ive been using Yahoo for my personal account & Gmail/Google for my business account , to NOT be dependent on my IP provider .	St
1.3.2	( I 've switched several times ) & gt ; as Clearwire sucks , Verizon is good for wireless , and Time-Warner Cable has the speed for those fast downloads @ home .	St
1.3.3	I also recommend using Mozilla FireFox and ThunderBird , as it is much more secure and less likely to be hit with worms , viruses , trojans and denial of service attacks if properly defended by a good anti-virus/anti-spyware program .	St
