I'm not looking into a printer that can feed out detailed pictures but if the price was right, I wouldn't mind a high end result. My budget is roughly $150CDN MAX and I've been looking at the HP Deskjet 3845, 3620 (very similar or so it seems), HP OJ5510 4-in-1, Lexmark P6250 3-in-1, HP PSC 1610 3-in-1 and Brother MFC420CN 6-in-1 (Brother; a company I know little about). Which of these, or any others I have not mensioned, is a the best reliable machine I can buy within my budget. As well, which make has the least expensive ink replacements? I am leaning towards HP or Lexmark because I am not sure about Brother (i've only seen commercials on television). Most of these also have scanners. How are scanner/printer-in-1 combinations? The scanner is okay? I'm thinking I might as well get one that has a scanner as it will come in handy in the future. Thanks in Advance - Mo

How is each function a compromise? The printer will not be of the same quality on the all-in-one compared to the regular printer?

You can do a pretty good job of faxing with a flatbed scanner and printer, so I would go with that choixce rather than the all in one.

Unless you do a high volume of faxes I would get a printer and a stand alone scanner. If you need color, get an ink jet printer. If not, get a Laser. Laser toner will last a long time compared to ink jet cartridges.

I need a crisp text output as well as decent colored images. PPM is not a big issue but what does the dpi have to do with? These mostly had 4800 dpi resolution.
