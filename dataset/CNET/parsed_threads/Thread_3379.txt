<s> Looking at some budget PSU's and came across a hec HP585D. </s>
<s> Anybody had any luck with these? </s>
<s> I'm not putting too much of a load on my system at all, but cannot get by with my tiny 250w. </s>
<s> How are you measuring 'the load' ? </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> You gave no details of your system. </s>
<s> However, if you have an OEM type such as Dell, HP, etc., then what's installed is considered capable for your needs. </s>
<s> They have determined its enough. </s>
<s> But, once you add or install other devices, then yes you start to tax the PSU. </s>
<s> Even so, unless you really stuff the system it helps to upgrade the PSU. </s>
<s> However, its been my strong advice, don't settle for cheap. </s>
<s> Cheap is cheap and it will falter in time and when it does it makes for a bigger problem than a poor PSU, if you're unlucky. </s>
<s> Calculate your needs then add 100W to it just to be safe, even with a cheap PSU. </s>
<s> Here is a link for a calculator: http://www.journeysystems.com/?power_supply_calculator -OR- google for another PSU calculator of your wattage needs. </s>
