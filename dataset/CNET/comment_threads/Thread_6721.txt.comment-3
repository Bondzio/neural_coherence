anyways A) the small ones are PCIe x1 slots B) the large ones are PCIe x16 slots, for SLI C) 20pin + 4pin has been the standard for ATX power since the year 2000 with the introduction of the Pentium 4, the 24-pin is just to provide even more power D) most PSU's ship as 20+4 or 24+4, none ship w/o the extra 4-pin E) yes the red thing is a specially shaped heatsink for the Asus board, it's just an Asus design (I have an Abit that has the NB HS actually cut so that it says Abit from certain angles (Abit VT7)) F) those blue connectors are Serial ATA or Serial ATA II, and have been around for a while also, that board uses DDR2 (just FYI) and features the new LGA 775 &quot;Socket&quot; T interface for Intel Pentium 4 and Pentium D processors also if you notice, that board has the following for power input: 1 24-pin ATX connector 1 4-pin ATX connector 1 4-pin molex connector any other questions?
