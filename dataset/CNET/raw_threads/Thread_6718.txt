Greetings, I am interested to build a Home Theater PC and would like to know if there is a graphic cards that fit the following requirement: (1) PCI-E interface. (2) HDMI output port. (3) Component video (YCbCr) output port. (4) Can support both Blu-ray and HD-DVD players. I did the research and narrow down to the VisionTek X1650PRO HDMI. However, I do not know if card is reliable & support of Blu-ray and HD-DVD players. Thanks for your help.

This can only be done via a DVI or an HDMI connection to a graphics card that supports HDCP decryption. Currently, Sony says there are no cards that support this.&quot; Later we finally started to see a few cards but you discover you can't use most displays since they must have HDCP as well. It's a minefield of issues so be sure you have return privileges if you find your selection doesn't work. http://compreviews.about.com/od/general/a/HDParadox.htm covers this as well as http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/vista_cost.html tells more about the Vista angle of copy protection.

Dear Bob, Thank you for your answer, the graphic card that I had mentioned The VisionTek X1650PRO HDMI has the following description in its spec: &quot;256MB DDR2 Memory HDCP eprom onboard.&quot; That is why I interested to do more study about this graphic card. However, you had mentioned another ineresting point that I did not know before about HDCP on the monitor/TV as well. Did you mean that my widescreen 1080p LCD HDTV need to also support HDCP?. Again, many thanks for your information. Regards, Hiep Nguyen
