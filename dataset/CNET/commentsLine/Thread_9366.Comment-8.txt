if you buy a upgrade version you must have the previous version of windows before it or other wise it will not work because its an upgrade but if you have the non upgrade one your fine.
if you want to put your upgrade copy on a new drive you have to install xp and you can go strait to window's 7 but if you dont have any previous full complete os then your best bet would be to mirror copy your old hard drive to your new one.
