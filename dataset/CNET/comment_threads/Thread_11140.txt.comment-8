Many thanks John, Both you and the others have given me some idea as to what I can do.
To summarize you're telling me I should upgrade my USB from 1.0 to 2.0 then buy an extenal 2.0 USB hard drive that can act as the repository for any music or photo albums I have...Right?
Ummm, when I load photo's onto my computer or try to download music will they go directly to the extenal drive then or do I have to do some computing to get them there?
