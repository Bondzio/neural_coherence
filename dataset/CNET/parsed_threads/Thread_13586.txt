<s> I have just purchased an external floppy drive for my desktop(vista), when I try to view a floppy disk that whas created on my laptop(XP) it tells me that the floppy needs formatting, of course this will delete all information on the floppy, when I did try to format on the desktop after a few seconds it tells me that Windows was unable to format, I need access to the information on the floppy, does anybody know what the problem is and how to fix it, Regards </s>
<s> If the floppy reads on other machines, this new drive is dead. </s>
<s> no, the drive works fine with a new floppy, i formatted a disk and saved work to it, it will not read the floppy disks that were formatted on my lapyop </s>
<s> Floppies are notoriously unreliable. </s>
<s> Certainly not suited for long-term storage. </s>
<s> But a good (albeit somewhat oldfashioned, slow and low capacity) way to transfer files between machines that don't have Internet or USB. </s>
<s> All you can try: read the diskette on your laptop and see if that recognizes it. </s>
<s> That's not impossible, although unlikely. </s>
<s> Then transfer the data using mail or USB-stick. </s>
<s> This is the umpteenth (if not more) proof that having data on one place only is an invitation to the gods of IT to destroy it and lose it. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> There are some worms that alter the boot area of floppies and you get this sort of complaint. </s>
<s> But if new diskettes work fine and diskettes from other machines are fine but not from this laptop then you found the problem. </s>
