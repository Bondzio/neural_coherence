pam: i too will soon be faced with that same dilemma; my 6 year old pc which is very old runs on win 95, is a p2 or a p3 and has a 4.0gb hd.
you mentioned you have a new dell 4700. is it a dell 4700 or the mini-tower dell 4700c?
how long have you had it and how do you like it?
anything come up yet requiring you to contact dell's tech support?
