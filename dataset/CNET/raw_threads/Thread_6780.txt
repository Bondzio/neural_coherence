I currently have a dlink wireless network adapter connected allowing me to have internet. I have allowed internet connection sharing under my wireless network connection. And i still cant connect to xbox live. I believe it might be my wireless network because i have messed around with it in the past. Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Broadcast SSID Use WPA security mixed b and g mode use channels 1, 6 or 11. Most devices(wireless adapters) work better on these channels. Use nothing else or maybe you want to read this . Rick
