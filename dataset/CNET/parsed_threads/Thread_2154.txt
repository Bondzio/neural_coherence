<s> I have a VPR Matrix Series 210, Model FT-6100 running XP home edition with SP 2, 2.53 ghz P4 with 512 MB ram. </s>
<s> Ok here's the problem, while running it will shut itself off and restart out of the blue... no warning, no blue screen of death nothing, just boom restart. </s>
<s> After restarting it does a normal load and comes up to say that it has recovered from a serious error and links to Mircosofts utility. </s>
<s> The Utility says to upgrade my bios. </s>
<s> My question how do I know that this is problem? </s>
<s> Second if it is the problems how do I go about upgrading my bios... </s>
<s> I have always been under the impression that it was hardwired into the motherboard. </s>
<s> And third will this fubar the rest of the components in my box? </s>
<s> Any and all help will be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> How long since you cleaned the heatsinks, checked fans? </s>
<s> I blew it out about two months ago. </s>
<s> Is there anything else I should have done? </s>
<s> Part of what is needed is diagnosis. </s>
<s> Right now there is only an idea. </s>
<s> Remove the case cover and if the issue vanishes or moves to 8 hours you know something you didn't before. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Bob, Thanks will do and see what happens. </s>
<s> I bought my VPR Matrix at Best Buy several years ago. </s>
<s> When I bought it, it cost $1399.00 without a monitor. </s>
<s> It was almost the type of the line, atleast for Best Buy at that time. </s>
<s> It had the most equipment for the money. </s>
<s> (2.2ghz Pentium 4, 64meg video card, DVD drive, CD drive, eithernet connections, 3.5 disk drive, and it came with a whopping 512 megs of ram. </s>
<s> Since I bought it I upgraded the ram to 1 gig and upgraded the video card to a ATI 128meg card. </s>
<s> Last year the computer stopped working so I took it to a PC shop and they fixed the system for about $100 bucks. </s>
<s> But I wound up losing everything on my Harddrive. </s>
<s> I wound up with just Window XP on it. </s>
<s> This year, the computer did what your computer did a few times. </s>
<s> Whenever I play my RTS game like Warhammer 40K, the computer will freeze up sometimes. </s>
<s> Two things can be wrong. </s>
<s> The computer can be overheating or it may just be very old and ready to retire. </s>
