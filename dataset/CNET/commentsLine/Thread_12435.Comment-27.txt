i have worked with a major computer company testing and replacing thousands of hard drives in computers.
the clicking sound as described always signifies a deteoriation of the hard drive.
it will not take long before it dies in most cases.
that is my experience.
the age of the drive or the brand doesn't matter.
when ibm first to come out with their 120gb hard drive they died even before some of them reached the customers.
they were not perfected before they were rushed them unto the market and that clicking sound was evident in some before they died.
replace the hard drives.
