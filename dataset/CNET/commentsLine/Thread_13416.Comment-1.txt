i have an e-machine t1440.
it has a 1.40ghz intel celeron processor,running windows xp home edition.
it came with 128mb sdram.
i added a stick of 256mb sdram to it.
when i check the computer to see how much memory there is, it still says 128. i was told that it will detect the added ram automatically.
i added the ram because i was getting low memory popups.
i am still getting them.
did the computer not take the new ram?
the new stick of ram has been tested good also.
