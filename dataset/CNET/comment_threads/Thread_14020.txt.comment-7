that meet your first statement???
I've seen it with those fo six slots where the third pair reduces the speed, not disavbles Dual Channel.
I feel that your reply may be very misleading.
The double bandwidth that one gets from Dual Channel is far bwetter for those CPU's such as Intel P4's that can handle the extra bandwidth.
