<s> I will be buying a netbook and need to install msoffice for reports. </s>
<s> Is there a way to do this without also purchasing an external CD/DVD drive? </s>
<s> I appreciate any information about how to do this, if there is a way. </s>
<s> Thank you, Cathy </s>
<s> You need some USB DVDRW eventually to create the restore media. </s>
<s> Your choice here but reading the forums today's owners seem upset when the OS becomes corrupt and they didn't make the media. </s>
<s> Back on point. </s>
<s> I tried this -&gt; I copied the Office 2003 CD to some USB memory stick and installed from that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> thank you for the input. </s>
<s> How likely is it for the OS to become corrupt? </s>
<s> Also, where could I find out how to copy msoffice to a memory stick? </s>
<s> This is probably very elementary knowledge but I am not a techie. </s>
<s> Thanks again, Cathy </s>
<s> That's the first accessory we bought and I'm glad we did. </s>
<s> Have no doubt that, when talking about hardware/software failure, it's not a matter of &quot;if&quot; but &quot;when&quot;. </s>
<s> Even the USB drive is going to fail at some point. </s>
<s> You can get external CD/DVD drives (almost all are burners too) for 50 bucks or under. </s>
<s> The difference in cost to you will the drive minus the price of the flash drive. </s>
<s> Many...if not most...netbooks come with a backup utility that can burn rescue media to such drives. </s>
<s> Reconsider, if you can. </s>
<s> Sorry but there is nothing new here. </s>
<s> Just copy and paste from one to another place. </s>
<s> you may use pen drive or external hard disk. </s>
<s> You may use USB port for this. </s>
<s> You might consider installing Open Office which is free and available via download. </s>
<s> The only drawback that I can see is that there is no application like MS Outlook in Open Office. </s>
<s> Is open office compatible with msoffice? </s>
<s> I have msoffice on my desktop and I will need to save reports made on the netbook to my desktop. </s>
<s> Would I be able to save the reports made with open office on the msoffice files? </s>
<s> Thanks for any information on this. </s>
<s> In a word: NO. </s>
<s> Yes, Open Office can open MS Office files through Office 2003, the version that I have installed on my desktop, but it cannot keep the formatting; therefore, it is NOT compatible. </s>
<s> If the formatting is not important to you, then there's no reason not to try Open Office on your netbook. </s>
<s> It's similar to MS Office, but not identical, so if you're familiar with MS Office and don't want to learn new routines, you will be disappointed. </s>
<s> If you don't mind learning new routines, then it may be just what you need and want. </s>
<s> Whatever works for you and whatever you like is good, better, and best for you. </s>
<s> I you have MS Office 2007, forget Open Office altogether. </s>
<s> I have that on my netbook running Windows 7 Ultimate RC1. </s>
<s> Works perfectly. </s>
<s> No problem whatsoever. </s>
<s> Look on the MS site for a 60 day trial download of the version of office you are buying and install it. </s>
<s> Enter the licence code from your 'purchased' MS Office. </s>
<s> Simple! </s>
<s> Thanks for the input regarding open office and msoffice 07. </s>
<s> I am leaning towards getting an external drive. </s>
<s> Does it matter what brand external dvd drive or are they all basically the same? </s>
<s> Best Buy is offering the ASUS netbook at a good price,though the external dvd drive is $89. </s>
<s> But they also recommend getting their initial 'tune-up'which enhances performance, removes things, etc., for $49 Is this tune-up a worthwhile thing to do/invest in for best functioning? </s>
<s> Thanks again for any feedback. </s>
<s> Are you in the USA? </s>
<s> Try http://www.geeks.com/products_sc.asp?cat=348 I see new units under 50. </s>
<s> More at newegg.com, amazon, etc. </s>
<s> As to the tuneup. </s>
<s> Fine way to pay for them to mess up your machine. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I like Open Office. </s>
<s> I really don't, however, think &quot;I don't have a DVD drive&quot; is a good reason to switch to it. </s>
<s> Switch if you support open computing, or think MS Office is a bloated poopy product, or cuz you wanna stick it to the man, or you're cheap. </s>
<s> I find it not too difficult to switch between MS Office, Star office/open office, iWork. </s>
<s> It's easier nowadays than it ever used to be. </s>
<s> Choose &quot;Save As...&quot; and it's an easy double-click to open as you switch from system to system. </s>
<s> But for most people, one office suite is enough. </s>
<s> If it were me, I'd use the interwebs to download install files for MS Office (trymicrosoftoffice.com). </s>
<s> It'll take a while, but it's not like you have to watch the progress bar the whole time. </s>
<s> The tune-up from Best Buy is really quite good on regular laptops. </s>
<s> They'll get it set up, do a lot of the initial chores for less than what I consider a reasonable cost for the time it saves me, and they do a better job than most users are capable to do. </s>
<s> I feel the same way about my local garage who changes my oil for about the same price. </s>
<s> On netbooks, Best Buy charges more for set-ups but does a lot less, so I'd not recommend it unless you can't manage it yourself. </s>
<s> On a netbook with XP, you really just need antivirus and you're ready to go. </s>
<s> Pricewise, if you shop around you'll save on an external dvd. </s>
<s> Big box retailers can't make money on netbooks, but they have to pay for those helpful folks, local brick-n-mortar, free interest financing, etc. </s>
<s> So accessories are more $$ there compared to mail-order. </s>
