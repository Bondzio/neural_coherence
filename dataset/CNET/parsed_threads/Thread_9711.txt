<s> I think I know what I did wrong now that caused me to lose pictures, files, music during a backup this weekend but my question is - is there a way to &quot;restore&quot; or &quot;go back&quot; to a previous day (like 3 days) so that my E drive is the way it was before I did the backup? </s>
<s> I know some OS systems allow you to &quot;go back&quot; or restore - but I don't know if my Western Digital hard drive Retrospect program has the option to undo my last backup?? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> Hi, Peggy (or anyone who may know the answer) Did you ever find out how to &quot;restore&quot; or &quot;go back&quot; after an unsuccessful WD backup? </s>
<s> I am having the same problem and unable to recover lost files! </s>
<s> Many Thanks. </s>
