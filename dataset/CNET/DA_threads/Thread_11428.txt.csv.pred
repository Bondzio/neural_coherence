1.6.2	Having MS Office on the IPAD would be terrific .	St

1.6.5	!	St
1.7.1	First time I used MS Office was on a MAC SE before the & quot ; office & quot ; concept using Word , Excel , and later PowerPoint .	St

1.9.1	A lite version would be beneficial .	St
1.9.2	I use Excel , Word , PP , OneNote , and picture manager daily .	St
1.9.3	I do n't think a full blown version of Office on a tablet or phone would be very useful .	St

1.9.5	I just put together a PowerPoint presentation today .	St
1.9.6	I would not consider using my tablet to do something like this .	St
1.9.7	However it would be great to view or do some light editing on the run .	St
1.10.1	This is the very reason we ( 155 users ) went away from Microsoft .	St

1.11.5	I open that document in Adobe , and one document each in the office apps .	St
1.11.6	If MS Office for Android eliminated my need for the workarounds , I 'd definitely consider it , provided that the implementation was reliable and reasonably priced .	St
1.11.7	There may be other Android apps out there now that have the features I need , but I 'm pretty sure there were n't any available on Google Play when I went looking for them last year .	St

1.13.5	I miss database software !	St
1.13.6	If reasonably priced & most of the functionality from Windows - YES , I would use MS Office on a mobile device in a heartbeat !	St
1.14.1	I have had situations where I was standing , entering data read off into a workbook on a mobile device .	St
1.14.2	Most mobile devices weigh less than laptops .	St
1.14.3	YES - the workbook gets transferred to PC for any major manipulation , but at least I got my data entered quickly on the fly .	St
1.15.1	Even though Tablet tries to cover most work aspects , when it comes to documents we really do n't have strong , unified and platform independent tools .	St
1.15.2	Microsoft office is plays an inevitable role on every kind of business on the PC front and if the same potential can be leveraged into tablets i would definitely go for it .	St
1.16.1	Also , I discovered that the & quot ; Speech-to-Text & quot ; option on all my Android devices is re-markedly accurate and requires very little editing .	St

1.18.2	Microsoft and Adobe think most of us have more money than we do .	St

1.18.4	At this point , I use Evernote to take notes , then copy/paste them into Word .	St
1.18.5	Evernote is great , but limited to simple text formatting .	St
1.18.6	I want a multilevel outline framework , for example .	St
1.19.1	Office 365 is already available on the Android platform .	St
1.19.2	I have it , and have it installed on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 .	St

1.20.9	For those seriously working , they already have laptops , using Office work alikes to great creations .	St
1.21.1	Microsoft is a software company , they should try to improve the software and OS already in market or yet to be introduced .	St
1.21.2	their Windows8 is not running as good as expected , Vista has fail .	St
1.21.3	They should give consumers a good service , their software will automatically make their own place and people will replace others to adopt them .	St
1.21.4	A good thing and service always pay better .	St
1.22.1	All serious work on desktop and to be free and handy one must adopt a tablet for easy going .	St
1.23.1	Since I have free things that work for me this may be a steep hurdle for them to overcome .	St
1.23.2	I generally prefer other products over Microsoft except for Excel , which is unfortunately a well deserved industry standard .	St
1.23.3	The other products ?	Ques
1.23.4	Not so much .	St
