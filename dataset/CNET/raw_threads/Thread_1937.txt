But I didn't read properly before I bought it and it seems this drive doesn't burn on '-R' DL DVDs only the '+R' DL disks. I'm thinking of returning it because it is my understanding that '-R' even a '-R DL' disk is more friendly with commercial DVD players... Like if I burn something on a DL Disk I want to make sure it will work at home not just on my computer. Is this correct? If so can anyone suggest a burner I can buy when/if I return the Plextor PX-716UF? Maybe a better burner with more capabilities? Thanks in Advance! ohh, I have a Macintish computer so whatever burner I get has to be Mac compatible.

Did you update the firmware?	http://www.plextor.com/english/support/downloads/firm_716.htm writes: &quot;#Date posted: June 15, 2005 # Improved the write performance on DVD-R Dual Layer Media.&quot; Would I win a bet your firmware is out of date?

But here's the funny part, In some places on Plextor's website is says it does support DVD-R DL and in other places it says it does not support it. I updated my firmware because thed update says it will burn DVD-R DL but then I emailed Plextor about it and the response I got was that the Drive does not do '-R DL' But you're right the Updated firmware says it does, only probelm is Plextor still says they don't. They need to make up their mind about this. I want to test it out myself but I can't seem to find DVD-R DL disks anywhere. I think I'll have to order them online or something.

I'm been pummeled for adding a feature in some devices and causing web and printed content to go out of sync. Just asking, why must you have DL DVD-R? It seems odd since you can't find the media. I did see DL DVD+R out there and my friend says it played fine on his players. Bob

So I want to try what I can to make sure if I burn any videos they will play in most DVD players. and I always thought +R worked, but -R worked better. Is that wrong?

At first I found -R to play widely. Now the list is reversed with more +R than -R. Here's why I know. I have to keep a list of what type to send to who for demos. Cheers, Bob
