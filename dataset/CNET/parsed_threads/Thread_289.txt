<s> Router: Netgear WGR614 Number of computers: 2 desktops (1 Dell and 1 Gateway) 1 laptop (Acer) Operating System: All have Windows XP home edition I've been pulling my hair out for a week trying to get this to work. </s>
<s> The 2 desktops have been networked for a long time now. </s>
<s> I am trying to add a laptop wirelessly to share files and a printer Computer A (dell) can not find the laptop on the network but can find the other desktop (computer b) Computer B (gateway) can find both laptop and computer A but when I click on laptop it says \\laptopname is not accessible. </s>
<s> Laptop can not find any of the other two computers. </s>
<s> When I click on the network name it says that network is inaccessible...... </s>
<s> I have disabled all the firewalls. </s>
<s> In fact, when I started trying to set this up the laptop didn't have any virus scan at the time. </s>
<s> Computer A has AVG free on it, as does the laptop now. </s>
<s> Did not find any sign of a firewall with that virus scan. </s>
<s> All computers have guest account as active. </s>
<s> All computers have a folder set as having permission to be shared. </s>
<s> All computers can ping each other using their IP addresses. </s>
<s> I'm stumped. </s>
<s> I don't know what to do. </s>
<s> I don't know how I got computer b to find the laptop but it can't access it anyways. </s>
<s> Please help and thanks in advance. </s>

<s> Presumably you are fighting your way through XP's Add A Network Place enigma. </s>
<s> Sometimes it works instantly even without the complete computer name, sometimes it just refuses to work unless everything is just so. </s>
<s> How Microsoft imagined that the average consumer could use this is beyond me. </s>
<s> I would suggest that you check that all firewalls are off (especially if your have 3rd party ones). </s>
<s> Don't attempt to set up wirelessly -- use ethernet cable between the computers until things are working. </s>
<s> Try running the Network Wizard on the new machine. </s>
<s> Other than that just stick at it and eventually it will work. </s>
<s> Didn't see any mention of this in your post, but have you checked that the laptop belongs to the same workgroup as your two desktops? </s>
<s> (Right click My Computer &gt; Properties &gt; Computer Name tab) </s>
<s> Thanks for the help guys but I actually got it. </s>
<s> I had to install the NWLink IPXSPXNetBIOS Compatible Transport Protocol on the laptop. </s>
<s> As soon as I did that, they all found each other and they were all able to &quot;talk&quot; to each other. </s>
<s> Once I found that, it took me 10 seconds to fix it. </s>
<s> Pretty frustrating when it is something that simple and I was looking for the answer for a week, but at least it's fixed and so far it seems to be working well. </s>
<s> Thanks again, Tracy </s>
