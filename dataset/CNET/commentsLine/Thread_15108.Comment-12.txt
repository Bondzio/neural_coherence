his 375w has 30amps.
the card requires 26amps.
watts is not the whole picture, it's the combined amp rating on the 12v.
for example here is my psu specs: 305w dell psu 22amps on the combined 12v rails 18a + 18a 264watt maximum combined watts on the 12v rails divided by 12 = amps 264 divided by 12 = 22
