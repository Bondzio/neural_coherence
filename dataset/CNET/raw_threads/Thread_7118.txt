A computer (desktop) I'm looing at has an Integrated video card and I was wondering if it is something I can upgrade or if by integrated it means its interated in the motherboard??? Any help would be great!!! Thanks

You also may have problems cooling the system if you have have one of the cute, but tiny, cases such as used by HP, Dell, Compaq, Esystems, et al. You might want to post the name and model of your system and which card that you are considering.

Specs indicate the PC has a PCIe slot however adding such a high wattage video card to an off the shelf box without knowing the power supply specs could be a recipe for an unstable PC without a warranty.

I had a previous post of a computer I built using the HP website and I had a Intel Dual processor in it but I was quickly informed that AMDs are much better and after seeing the proof I decided to go with a AMD. Now that I want an AMD tho I'm having a hard time finding somewhere I can build a AMD with the price range I've got ($1300-$1600) and get the video card I want as well. If that pre built HP wont work, what sort of components are crucial to make sure it can handle the Nvidia Geforce 7800GTX?

Take a look here... http://www.pcper.com/hwlb.php?&guide2=y#guide2 You can mix and match, add or subract, as desired. The one thing you might want to consider is 2GBs RAM...for that reason ...go to Tomshardware.com and read the article on 'How Much Ram' .... My observation is go to the MAX RAM you think you might want upfront...then you won't have to worry about adding later and matching speeds, brands and using 2 DIMM slots vs. 4 DIMM slots. The other thing is the RAPTOR is a great drive ... however its outrageously expensive. You could easily save yourself some big $$ on the drive upfront and add one later if you really decide you want to put out the extra dough. In lieu of the 150GB RAPTOR ... you could also get a 74GB RAPTOR and a good 200-300GB hard drive to go with it and have $$ left over. With a system like you want...you need someplace to store your system backup...2nd internal hard drives are great for that purpose. Once you pick out the components...post it for comment...believe me you'll get plenty. The only problem is knowing which comments are factual and worth considering further or just people repeating what they've 'heard'. Other sites with interesting reviews...

The MB listed &quot;NF4SLI-A9&quot;....not a review found anywhere not even on the BIOSTAR website. However I did find a reference to a BIOSTAR N4SLI-A9 on BIOSTAR website (below) and a product under that model number is available at NEWEGG (link further below). Suggest reading the buyer reviews to see what they say about the BIOSTAR &quot;N4SLI-A9&quot;. http://www.biostar-usa.com/mbdetails.asp?model=n4sli-a9 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813138253 Think I'd rather look for another MB for the heart of my system. 2. The Ultra PS is not one of PSs that I typically recommend. They're a new or relatively new brand and I haven't seen enough on them to justify put one a high end PC. Besides it's a modular PS that many DO NOT RECOMMEND simply because it's modular and offers additional failure points Here's a site that has some good info on PS that warrant reading. http://www.rose-hulman.edu/~freemawa/featured/psu/trusted.php &quot;Modular power supplies Yes, they're pretty. And removing unused cables can be easier than tucking them out of the way. But be careful. Part of the problem is inherent in the supplies being modular: adding another connection adds another source of resistance, another possible point of failure, and just one more thing to go wrong. The bigger part of the problem is that most of these supplies are absolute garbage. If you take junk and make it worse, it's still junk. The market leader in modular supplies has been Ultra with their X-Connect line. And their X-Connect line is unequivocably terrible (it wasn't, originally, but it is now). So if you are going to go this route, spend the money on a quality supply&quot; The best of the best is &quot;PCPower and Cooling&quot;. If you can find one of those at a price you're comfortable with .. that's the way to go. If not, take a look at the Seasonic S-12 500 or 600. They seem to get great reviews wherever they're rated. Fortron Source is also good too. Here's more reading on PSUs.. http://www.hardforum.com/showthread.php?t=1000883 3. Really want/need RAID 0 ??? And if YES...how will you back it up ? I'd much rather have a standard drive system and reduce the risk of corruption and data loss. In a RAID ZERO...there is NO REDUNDANCY WHATSOEVER...the files are split on two or more drives. Any drive failure under RAID 0 means you lose it all unless it's backed up somewhere else...ergo the reason I suggested something like a 74GB RAPTOR as a primary boot drive with the OS, APPs and DATA and a second HDD for backup. Last but NOT LEAST.....there are new AMD processors (Socket AM2) coming out soon that will also use differnt RAM DDR2. if you can wait for that...you might be better off toward future ugradability-expansion.

This would be my first half decent computer, that's why I'm trying so hard to work it out so that I don't end up with some thing that wont be any good a week after I buy it.

How about a X2 4400+ instead of the FX-55? It is only about .4GHz slower, and it has two of them. Bigger cache, as well. That'll shave some more. That is alot of space... You could save by maybe bringing it to a 200GB. Your call. Just my $.02 ~Ibrahim~ P.S. Just wondering, is there a major difference in onboard sound and PCI sound cards?

If you drop the sound card and get the X2 4800+ you'll save about $181 +$75 = $266 ...that should be enough to get 2GB RAM and 2 hard drives. Then add the sound blaster later..it's an easy add and a much better way to do this.

With your system...you've already offset most of that with the 2GBs RAM. --re drives... The primary drive in my system setup is usally smaller than the secondary drive. I put the OS and the APPs on drive 0 partition 1 (C:) and my data on drive 0 partition 2 (D:). This way I can backup the OS and APPs or the DATA or the entire hard disk using GHOST 2003. The images ..usually multiple copies of images, are stored on drive 1. That's partly the reason I suggested the 74GB RAPTOR as drive 0 (OS and APPS) if that might be large enough and whatever fits the bill for drive 1...the bigger the better until the cost/MB gets too high. Usually the best buys per/GB seem to be in the 200-300GB range. If drive 0 gets corrupt and I can't restore point it or correct it, I just pull the last image of drive 0 partition 1 and simply put it back on C: If drive 0 dies...then I replace it and use the same technique to restore both C: and D:. I actually take that one step further and put copies of the mages on an external USB drive ...just in case and the system is protected by a good UPS. This method minimzes downtime and avoids spending hours and hours finding CDs, locating product keys, loading the OS, the drivers, the APPs, set all the preferences, and then get to the WEB and do all the SW updates. Wow..I'm getting tired already. So I want to avoid that at all costs. Hope this helps. Let us know how it goes and how you like it. VAPCMD
