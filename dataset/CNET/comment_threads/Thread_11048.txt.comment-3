Sorry but this issue is one of those repeating ones.
When I find a cranky drive I try the cd/dvd lens cleaner and then retest.
If I don't feel it's a software issue I swap the drive out and that cures it everytime.
What happens a lot today is that many owners don't realize how cheap these drives are.
The makers think nothing of them lasting 24 or so months.
