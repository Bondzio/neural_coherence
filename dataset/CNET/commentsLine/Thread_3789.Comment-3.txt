i have over 600 cds, and i converted every one of them to mp3, and the best way to do it is through your pcs cd-rom.
i've noticed that running rca cables to and from your sound card degrades the quality of the sound.
your files will be the same size (depending on your settings) no matter what they end up sounding like.
it's going to be a long process, but you can always walk away while it's working.
what i did was start as soon as possible (i think i had about 350-400 cds at the time) with your conversions.
each time you buy a new cd, make ripping it the first thing you do.
it'll take you about 5 minutes and then it's done!
another tip for you - and this is coming from my own experience - stick with a bit rate of 128. my first several cds were done at 192, to get that higher quality sound.... no difference in quality in both my high end car stereo and my high end home stereo systems.
and the space that you save will be worth it in the future.
i used xing mp3 for ripping.
i've head a lot of complaints about it, but i've never had any problems with it.
the id3 tags were not very important to me, but that is a time consuming task with xing; so i just passed on it.
good luck and enjoy the convenience of having all of your music available at the click of a mouse for making audio cds, playlists, and (my personal favorite) mp3 cds!
