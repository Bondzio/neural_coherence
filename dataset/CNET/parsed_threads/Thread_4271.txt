<s> I have an old dell dimension 2400 that i'm trying to get up and running. </s>
<s> I installed win xp with service pack 3 on it, and everything seems to work fine, except when i try to play a dvd or cd. </s>
<s> (BTW it has 1 gig of memory) I don't think it is hardware related. </s>
<s> When i try to play a dvd the sound is almost inaudible and along with the video it starts and stops. </s>
<s> The sound sometimes is almost ok but sounds like theres an echo. </s>
<s> The cd player is the same way, it plays the cd but starts and stops. </s>
<s> I can take both players out and install in another computer and they work just fine. </s>
<s> I worked on this for 3 or 4 days off and on and am about to get tired of messing with it. </s>
<s> I have run dell diagnostics and installed and reinstalled drivers and checked everything i know of but nothing seems to help.Anyone can help with this i'd sure appreciate it.....thanks </s>

<s> Starts and stops has me think about the old XP DMA issue. </s>

<s> Echo. </s>
<s> I'm finding folk to not know their machine and I turn off sound effects like reverb in the sound control panels. </s>
<s> No, I can't tell you exactly where since this area is not standardized. </s>

<s> Always try VLC PLAYER for Video DVD playback. </s>

<s> thanks for your reply, i had already tried the dma thing and tried it again today but seems to make no difference. </s>
<s> Using the vlc player also does nothing. </s>
<s> I just don;t get it, sound and videos play fine on everything except the dvd and cd players. </s>
<s> I can play videos on youtube and everything is good. </s>
<s> Swap drives and use one of those USB 3 dollar audio solutions to sniff out where the issue is. </s>

<s> what exactly is a (USB 3 dollar audio solution) </s>
<s> http://www.amazon.com/External-Sound-Adapter-Desktop-Notebook/dp/B000BUDHNQ/ This and a few others are under 3 so it's something you carry around to figure it out. </s>

<s> thanks for the info Bob, i've orsered one of these, but still don't understand how it can help with a audio and video problem while playing a cd or dvd from either player. </s>
<s> One is a Pioneer dvd rw and the other is a samsung cdrw drive. </s>
<s> But like i said i can put these in another computer and they work fine--thanks </s>
<s> When dealing with old gear you may have a failed sound card. </s>
<s> But I'm unsure how to convey that optical drives over 2 years old are iffy. </s>
<s> Some owners dig in their heels and you can't get them to change out an old drive. </s>
<s> So you let them be until they are serious about fixing the machine. </s>
