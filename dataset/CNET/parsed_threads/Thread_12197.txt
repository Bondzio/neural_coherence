<s> hi there, I am thinking of buying an old PII 133 laptop, (I will probably install win98 on it) but it doesn't have USB port so I am wondering, to xfer various files larger than 1.4 mb, can I hook this thing up to my win 2000 machine via a parallel cable? </s>
<s> and if so, what do i need beyond the cable itself? </s>
<s> will windows just start talking back and forth or do I need some software? </s>
<s> speed is not a big issue here --fj PS it has a &quot;IrDA 1.0&quot; port, whatever THAT is - fj </s>
<s> Documented at http://www.techno-link.com/wown/dccmain.htm Bob </s>
<s> The best s/w to do this is called, &quot;Laplink&quot; which also includes the cable. </s>
<s> Older Laplink s/w ver. </s>
<s> will do fine, it seems too many bells and whisltes are part of the s/w now and but check to be sure it will handle your OS. </s>
<s> Win98 and above offer MS own &quot;DCC&quot; s/w whcih does basically the same thing but very basic and that's OK for most users. </s>
<s> That's installed from the OS install CD from the add/remove s/w icon. </s>
<s> You still need the laplink type cable parallel or serial links as required. </s>
<s> The IrDA is &quot;infared connection&quot; ability. </s>
<s> That's also possible if goping that route, but it can be complex at times. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
