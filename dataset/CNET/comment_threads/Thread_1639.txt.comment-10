I was looking at this: http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3952307&SRCCODE=LINKSHARE&cm_mmc_o=-ddCjC1bELltzywCjC-d2CjCdwwp&AffiliateID=NKa3hZyYoHA-toMiJ08VH4nDJ9dcrfZ00w It looks like the &quot;standard&quot; configuration would work for my application where it creates two separate hard drives.
This is probably a stupid question, but can i connect directly from my laptop to the enclosure with an ethernet cable?
My airport express does not have an available RJ-45 port.
