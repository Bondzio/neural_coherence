Ok so I own the same computer: http://www.dealtime.com/xPF-Hewlett-Packard-HP-SR2170NX-Compaq-Presario-Desktop-PC and am looking to upgrade so I can play ElderScrolls Oblivian.
I was looking at the Nvidia e-GeForce 6200 LE 256MB DDR2 PCIe Video Card: http://www.microcenter.com/single_product_results.phtml?product_id=0281568 Will this work with the computer.
It has the PCI express slot but I wasn't sure if vista, the motherboard, or the onboard radeon xpress 1100 would cause problems when I put in the new Nvidia.
Thank you
