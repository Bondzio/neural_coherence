<s> I have two notebook computers. </s>
<s> One is for work ( company owned) and other is personal. </s>
<s> I travel a lot for business and carry my work computer with me. </s>
<s> During the traveling I cannot do any personal business as I lack the personal notebook. </s>

<s> Copy files from my personal computer and carry this hard drive when I travel. </s>

<s> I use outlook express and Microsoft Outlook for my personal business. </s>
<s> How can I copy outlook express and Microsoft Outlook from personal computer to external hard drive? </s>
<s> How can I use this with my company computer ? </s>
<s> The company computer has Microsoft outlook installed but I want to keep my personal e-mail seperate and on the external hard drive. </s>

<s> I read all that thread. </s>
<s> Very good solutions. </s>

<s> Please provide any suggestions. </s>
<s> Why not the cheap exit? </s>
<s> (don't have to answer.) </s>
<s> As you may have discovered the answer varies with the email client. </s>
<s> There is NO portable version of Outlook so that's a dead end unless you look at U3. </s>

<s> Bob; Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> U3 drives are very limited. </s>
<s> Only available in flash drives max capacity 2 GB. </s>
<s> Meantime I downloaded Thunderbird portable application on one of my 1GB flash drive. </s>
<s> on first try it worked fine. </s>
<s> No trace of e-mails on computer once I removed the drive.I am going to use this on other computer and see how it works. </s>
<s> If this works fine then I will install it on my portable USB drive. </s>
<s> This might be the solution. </s>
<s> Also if this works I would like to copy all my old e-mails from Outlook express to the Thunderbird portable. </s>
<s> any idea on how to do this ? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
