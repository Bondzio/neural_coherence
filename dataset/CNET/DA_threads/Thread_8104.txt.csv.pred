1.1.1	The support forums at Apple are going crazy right now !	St
1.1.2	There are a huge number of MacBook owners with logic board failures and Apple seems to be oblivious to this issue .	St
1.1.3	It must be pretty big since people are waiting over two weeks for repairs .	St
1.1.4	Mine went in last week and the repair is on hold due to parts on back order .	St
1.1.5	I am worried this is gon na be a huge problem in Apple 's attempt to get switchers .	St
1.1.6	Anyone here having these problems ?	Ques
1.2.1	http : //www.engadget.com/2006/07/08/apple-sneaks-new-logic-board-into-whining-macbook-pros/	St
1.3.1	: ) -8 -- & lt ;	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	I 've had two logic board failures and one hard drive failure on my G5 .	St
1.5.2	The hard drive and first logic board failure were covered under warranty .	St
1.5.3	The replacement logic board was also defective .	St
1.5.4	First symptom was whine .	St
1.5.5	Was told to reset the SMU .	St
1.5.6	Temporary relief .	St
1.5.7	Then freezes and sleep shutdowns started .	St
1.5.8	Was told to try OS reinstall .	St
1.5.9	It did n't work .	St
1.5.10	Tried erase and reinstall .	St
1.5.11	Same result .	St
1.5.12	Was told to upgrade memory .	St
1.5.13	Same result .	St
1.5.14	Shop diagnosed the new logic board as bad , after the totally inadequate 90 day replacement part protection period , but the unit was clearly defective at install .	St
1.5.15	Called Mac and they said screw you .	St
1.5.16	It is clearly unacceptable for Mac to sweep such a major and widespread systemic problem under the rug .	St
1.5.17	The only option in light of Mac 's bad hardware and customer protection is to go back to PC , where competition among hardware manufacturers forces them to step up quality and service or go out of business .	St
1.6.1	Hmmm ... ..I was n't aware that Macbooks had the same logic board problems .	St
1.6.2	I just posted a new thread asking which mac computer was of the best quality , but in light of reading this thread , I think I will go back to PC for a while .	St
1.6.3	Damn shame too , I like OSX .	St
1.7.1	you might want to actually read & quot ; news & quot ; ... not & quot ; old information & quot ; ... my understanding is those issues are gone ... or at least substantially diminished .	St
1.8.1	http : //www.macbookrandomshutdown.com/ The forums under this link show that it 's a widespread and on-going problem that includes the core 2 duo macs .	St
1.8.2	The problem does not appear to be & quot ; substantially diminished. & quot ; Do not buy a MacBook unless you like a $ 2k+ screwing .	St
1.9.1	I counted 77 distinct user IDs going back to 9/28/06 .	St
1.9.2	On that day , they hit the 1000 mark .	St
1.9.3	Many of the posts were getting their repairs cleared - not quickly , but cleared .	St
1.9.4	the number of new complaints is going down .	St
1.9.5	I never said there were NO problems .	St
1.9.6	I said there were fewer problems since the first machines ' release ... and suggested that current - rather than 6 month old data , which is what the CNET link was pointing to , might be more appropriate .	St
1.9.7	Being a member of a Macintosh User Group , I know dozens of people with no problems on their machines ... a few have had issues , yes , but overall , the more recent machines have had substantially fewer problems ...	St
1.10.1	Knowing that Apple has achieved & quot ; substantially fewer problems & quot ; with their new macbooks is no comfort .	St
1.10.2	Somehow I doubt that 's even true , but the point is Apple has had logic board problems with their laptops since at least when my ibook came out in 2001 .	St
1.10.3	That was FIVE years ago !	St
1.10.4	If Apple ca n't SOLVE the problem COMPLETELY within five years well ... that should tell you something .	St
1.10.5	Look , you buy mac if you want , but for my money , if I 'm going to pay a premium on a something that is ordinarily very expensive to begin like a notebook computer , it sure as hell better WORK right first .	St
1.11.1	are not the same logic boards used now .	St
1.11.2	So saying that they have had logic board problems since 2001 and have not fixed them yet is a bit of a stretch .	St
1.11.3	I wonder if you would say the same about Windows ?	Ques
1.11.4	They have had 11 years to solve the security problem and still have not .	St
1.11.5	P	St
1.12.1	The logic board problems I 'm aware of are on G5 macs .	St
1.12.2	That 's post-2004 .	St
1.12.3	If the logic board problems really have been persistent since 2001 into the development of the G5 , that 's an extremely discouraging statement on Apple 's product development .	St
1.13.1	iMac flat panel ... bought it new in 2005 ... added RAM , use it regularly to edit high def video .	St
1.13.2	Works great ... no problems ... Just as solid as the G4 QuickSilver tower it replaced , the G3 tower it replaced , the Quadra 610 and 650 it replaced , the Mac II and the SE they replaced ( which I still have and which still boots up ) ... not to mention the PowerBook 140 , 180 , 540 and Duo in-between those other machines ... and the PowerBook G4 and iMac CoreDuo my son uses today all work - or did work ( when they were in use ) pretty much flawlessly ...	St
1.14.1	to someone who seems to be the source of all knowledge when it comes to Mac Logic board problems .	St
1.14.2	I have seen no definitive evidence to support his claim that all Mac logic boards , at least since 2001 , are defective .	St
1.14.3	My G3 iBook ( Clamshell circa 2001 ) is still going well , ditto G4 cube and the G4 tower .	St
1.14.4	I have been fixing Mac 's , in one way or another for a long time , and have never had to change out a logic board that & quot ; just failed & quot ; Coffee , paper clips , lightning , power surge and one where the cat walked across the open door of a G4 tower .	St
1.14.5	I 'll accept that electronics fail but what sort of percentage are we talking about here ?	Ques
1.14.6	P	St
1.15.1	Nobody 's claiming that & quot ; all & quot ; Mac logic boards are defective .	St
1.15.2	There is , however , definitive evidence of a disturbingly high failure rate if one clicks on the links in previous posts in this thread , and in Apple 's extension on original logic boards on some of the early G5s .	St
1.15.3	And no , these failures are not triggered by coffee , paper clips , power surges , or cats .	St
1.15.4	There seems to be something cult-like about the denial of the seriousness of this problem on the part of dedicated Mac fans .	St
1.15.5	Really , it 's nothing you need to get so defensive about .	St
1.15.6	Closing one 's mind with religeous devotion to a brand is one of the worst mistakes a tech consumer can make .	St
1.15.7	In another forum , one repair professional offered the opinion that , while component failures occur at varying rates on specific models for all brands , brands that use a lot of proprietary component configurations ( the example was Dell ) leave fewer options for replacing defective components and are more likely to have recurring problems after repair .	St
1.15.8	For obvious reasons this would also apply to Mac , supported by the number of people having recurring problems on one component .	St
1.15.9	FYI - I migrated to Mac as a result of the Windows 95/98 stability and security debacle .	St
1.15.10	However , it 's a myth that Mac OS is inherently more secure than recent versions of Windows .	St
1.15.11	Mac OS also has its security flaws , but they have not been targeted by as much malware and Macs are less likely to be used in networked environments , which accentuate security flaws .	St
1.15.12	Also , having seen the vast improvement of Windows XP over earlier versions in terms of stability , I 'm not convinced that there 's still an advantage to Mac OS at this point .	St
1.15.13	Looks like time to migrate back and get away from the disadvantages of a brand that has more proprietary components than any other .	St
1.16.1	Thank you Igiveup2 .	St
1.17.1	With all the logic board problems that Apple has with their MacBooks , all the Security Problems they have with the Operating System , the instability of OS X , the danger of using one in a networked environment , the large number of proprietary parts , ( they would be ? ? )	Ques
1.17.2	I support your intention of migrating back to the the more secure , stable and networkable environment that is Windows .	St
1.17.3	P	St
1.18.1	Certainly the the Dell , HP/Compaq , Toshiba , Sony , Acer and all the other Intel and AMD machines which require different BIOS configurations ( among other tweaks ) , their 'proprietary & quot ; stuff and running Windows whatever would be just a fine hardware and software environment for you .	St
1.18.2	Take care !	St
1.19.1	I am a truly horrible person for suggesting that Macs are anything but infallible .	St
1.19.2	It would serve me right if I start looking like that pudgy guy representing Windows in the Mac commercials .	St
1.19.3	Mac guys are SO hip ( like the commercials show ) and SO reasonable ( like this forum shows ) .	St
1.20.1	You have a choice .	St
1.20.2	I encourage you to switch back .	St
1.20.3	Really .	St
1.20.4	If you have a problem with Apple gear , go elsewhere .	St
1.20.5	No big deal .	Polite
1.20.6	I do n't have the same issues you are having .	St
1.20.7	If I did , I 'd be switching to another operating system running on another manufacturer 's hardware , too .	St
1.20.8	But I do n't , so I 'm not .	St
1.21.1	I will if you want me to , though ... Because that 's how we are ... helpful and accommodating .	St
1.22.1	just annoyed that one person could have had so much bad luck with their computer choice .	St
1.22.2	Of course this is a caring forum and we would love for you to be a happy computer user which is why , based on your posts , I supported your proposed move back to Windows .	St
1.22.3	Sorry this post is kinda in the wrong place but I could not reply directly to your post due to forum length .	St
1.22.4	P	St
