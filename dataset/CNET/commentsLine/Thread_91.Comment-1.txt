i have read here that putting a non-working hard drive in a freezer will make it work again.
i am asking for the specifics on the max temperature the hard drive can sustain in a freezer and how to bag it properly.
i have 2 failed hard drives, a 250gb and a 10 gb, so, i am desperate to try a way to start these drives since a professinal data recovery and a new computer is out of the question due to the prices.
