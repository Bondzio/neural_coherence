well i want to upgrade my ram on my hp m8000n to 4gb.
but heres, the problem, i have no clue what kind of ram my computer has and i dont know if i should replace the current 2gb of ram with better ram, add the same ram, or add better ram and use it with the current ram that i have.
i really need help with this.
thanks.
