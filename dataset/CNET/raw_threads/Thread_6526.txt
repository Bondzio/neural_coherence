I just bought an external hard drive, and it is recommended that I format the external drive the same as the internal one. But, for the life of me, I can't find where it indicates type of file system.

I knew I had seen it somewhere but drew a blank as to where and started looking in hardware profiles, etc., etc. Guess I was making it more complicated than it needed to be. Thanks again.
