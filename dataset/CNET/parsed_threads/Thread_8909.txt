<s> My old Tiny PC is running win98 SE. </s>
<s> Whatever adaptor/driver i select i con only display 2 or 16 colours and a resolution of 640x480. </s>
<s> Detected as a Plug and Play moniter. </s>
<s> Is 17&quot; Tiny monitor. </s>
<s> Been happening since i restarted windows because of another problem. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> If any more details required please ask. </s>
<s> boot up in Safe Mode and remove ALL Video drivers [you probably have multiple, and Safe Mode is the only way to see that]. </s>
<s> After removing them, reboot, and when Windows detects new hardware [video] install the correct drivers. </s>
<s> Due to a glitch Windows had defaulted to its basic VGA driver. </s>
