<s> External HD: Cavalry 500GB Started using: around early April Used: 120GB out of 500GB(would like to save if at all possible) A week ago, started to have the problem of not able to access the drive, with a warning message saying the drive is not accessible, and that the file or directory is corrupted and unreadable. </s>
<s> When I go to the Properties for the drive, it shows 0 byte for everything and format is shown as RAW. </s>
<s> Yesterday, I finally got around to try to fix it. </s>
<s> I first went to the Properties for the drive and tried to run check disk from there, the dialog window disappeared as soon as it started checking. </s>
<s> Then I went to the DOS prompt to use chkdsk /f /r from there, that actually worked. </s>
<s> It fixed a number of indexes as well as the MFT. </s>
<s> After that is complete, my correct volume is shown under properties again for this drive, and the format is back to NTFS. </s>
<s> But the weird part is none of the files and folders is showing up, even though it said I used up around 120GB of space. </s>
<s> Could anyone help me here? </s>

<s> Mine actually has a letter assigned and all, everything looks recovered, except that I cannot see the files that are taking up 120GB of storage. </s>
<s> If you tried the noted softwares. </s>
