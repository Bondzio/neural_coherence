New technology always costs more especially after release.
Besides the AM2 is going to be the future of cpus from AMD, so really get it if you can.
HOWEVER, if you wait just a little longer the &quot;older&quot; stuff will come down in cost for sure, maybe in 30days or so.
You should already see some lessing of pricing of older cpus, etc.. tada -----Willy
