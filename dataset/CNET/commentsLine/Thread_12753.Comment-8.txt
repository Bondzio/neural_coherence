notice that &quot;winblows&quot; partition in the top pane has a listed capacity of 44.46 gb.
this was it's original size (before i attempted to resize it).
in the lower pane, the &quot;winblows&quot; partition is listed as 62.5 gb.
this is the size that i was resizing it to.
if i look at the drive in explorer, it also tells me the partition is 44.46 gb.
so basically i'm missing the ~18 gb.
44.46 + the sizes of my other partitions do not add up to an 80 gb hdd.
and thanks for all your help so far, bob.
