1.1.1	I want to upgrade my mother board because I have found that I have an off brand and I would like to upgrade my video card .	St
1.1.2	I do n't however want to have to buy new memory or a processor .	St
1.1.3	I have an Intel Pentium 2.6 ghz processor .	St
1.1.4	And i have ddr sdram .	St
1.1.5	Does anyone know what mother board I could get .	St
1.1.6	Can ddr and ddr2-dimm ram run in the same motherboard ?	Ques
1.2.1	No .	St

1.5.1	What motherboard do you already have ?	Ques
1.5.2	What video card do you already have ?	Ques
1.5.3	What do you want to be able to do with the new video card ?	Ques
1.5.4	Download and run CPU-Z ( cpuid.com ) to learn the manufacturer name and model number of your current motherboard .	St
1.5.5	You should have a socket 478 CPU with a Northwood core ( confirm this with CPU-Z ) .	St
1.5.6	That means you need to start your search by looking at socket 478 motherboards that support a P4 ( not just Core Solo or Core Duo CPUs ) .	St
1.5.7	I only knew of three socket 478 P4 motherboards that had a PCI Express slot , they were n't the greatest boards , and they are getting difficult to find these days .	St
1.5.8	You should still be able to find some good boards with i865 or i875 chipsets and AGP 8X video slots .	St
1.5.9	Another option that will allow you to keep your DDR memory is to move to a socket 939 AMD CPU & motherboard ; but , if you are going to spend that much money , I 'd just bite the bullet and build a complete Core 2 Duo system .	St
1.6.1	Got to this site via google .	St
1.6.2	Hope someone can help .	St
1.6.3	Thanks in advance .	St

1.6.9	It did n't come with its own OS disk -- just a restore disk .	St
1.6.10	TX DD	St
