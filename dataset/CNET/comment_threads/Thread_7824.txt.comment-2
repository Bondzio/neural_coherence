That's not unique enough, maybe.
http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/ProductList.jsp?lang=en&cc=us&prodTypeId=12454&prodSeriesId=402657&taskId=135 lists 5 different subtypes.
They have a lot of documentation on their site, but I couldn't easily find if it has the PCI-Express that's needed for the card you asked about.
Can you find something about available slots in the documentation that came with the PC?
