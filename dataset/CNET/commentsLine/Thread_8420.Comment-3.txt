not good.
after 2 decades of watching people with various raid systems, raid 1 never paid off.
the most common damage to the system was the delete key.
the damage was mirrored to the other drive and that was that.
same story for corrupted files, virus, trojan and malware.
-&gt; never in 20 years did raid 1 save anyone i know.
raid 0 paid off for those that wanted speed, and raid 5 for those that wanted better hardware reliability.
many attempt raid because they are under the impression it will save them from performing a backup.
the lesson about backup appears to be one that many will learn firsthand.
