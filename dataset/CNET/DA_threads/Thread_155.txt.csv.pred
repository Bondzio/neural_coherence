1.1.1	I have a HP Pavillion 8756 that I just upgraded to XP from ME , I find it kind of slow and would like to upgrade my RAM ... .	St
1.1.2	I have 2 x 126MB sticks and would like to put in 2 X 256MB sticks .	St
1.1.3	( There are only 2 slots on the mother board ) Problem is that I 'm not too sure what speed these ram sticks are ... Probably 133MHZ but , how can I be sure before I go ahead and purchase the 2 new sticks ? ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.4	Is there a way to find out in the computer configuration ?	Ques
1.1.5	I do n't have my original books either ! ! !	St
1.1.6	!	St
1.2.1	Many online computer hardware stores such as http : //www.crucial.com/ offer automated services to determine exactly what kind of sticks and max RAM a machine can use .	St
1.3.1	Here is a link to all of the specs for the Pavilion 8756 .	St
1.3.2	The first chart states that your computer uses PC100 SDRAM , not PC133 .	St
1.3.3	Be careful when purchasing an upgrade ... some PC133 SDRAM is backwards compatible with PC100 , but not all .	St
1.3.4	Hope this helps , John	St
