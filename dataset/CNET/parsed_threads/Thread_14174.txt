<s> I need advice. </s>
<s> i know virtually nothing about computers. </s>
<s> Iuse the computer to email and surf the web. </s>
<s> My childrne will use it for games and homework. </s>

<s> Speed and graphics are my most desirable features and cost too!! </s>
<s> Circuit City is running a sale Compaq: 512MB DDR-SDRAM memory 160GB hard drive 9 in 1 memory card maker DVD Pentium 4 Processor 515j Desktop package Flat Screen monitor for $549 They also have a EMACHINE with the same features except a memory card reader is not listed..a 8 in 1 digital manager is. </s>
<s> AND it is 60GB NOT 160GB. </s>
<s> On sale for 419 I have also looked at the emachine t6212. </s>
<s> This one is considerable more expensive @800...but may be on sale as well..I have to look. </s>
<s> HELPHELPHELP!! </s>
<s> What is the better fit for my needs???? </s>
<s> Thank you!! </s>
<s> Kim </s>
<s> wait until its on sale and can be had for $600. </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> Kim, It seems the Compaq package you described is no longer being offered at circuit city, as it is not on their website. </s>
<s> Same for the Emachine. </s>
<s> I could not find an Emachine available for $419. </s>
<s> You stated that the Compaq had: Pentium 4 processor 512 MB of RAM 160 GB harddrive The Emachine likely had: Celeron processor 256 MB of RAM 60 GB harddrive You should be looking for a computer more like the Compaq than the Emachine. </s>
<s> You should be looking for a computer with 512MB of RAM and atleast an 80GB harddive. </s>
<s> These computers would work: http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=999934100050000&type=product&productCategoryId=cat01173&id=pcmprd34200050000 (However the rebates on that expire in 2 days) http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.gsp?product_id=3649964&cat=41937&type=19&dept=3944&path=0%3A3944%3A3951%3A41937 (Good buy) I reccommend these: http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=999935300050015&type=product&productCategoryId=cat01173&id=pcmprd35400050015 (Worth the extra money) Also like you said, watch out for the Emachines T6212 package deals in bestbuy and circuitcity. </s>
<s> Like the Gateway I showed you, it's worth the extra money!. </s>
<s> Shop around and watch out for sales in the flyers on the weekends. </s>
<s> the emachines is good that it is 64-bit and future applications and win. </s>
<s> longhorn is going to be 64-bit. </s>
<s> Also amd is better than amd as it is faster in games and are not as hot and powersucking as the pentium 4s. </s>
<s> The t6212 graphics are upgradable with the pci express slot. </s>
<s> Also the service from emachines is not bad as when my dvd burner broke, they sent me a replacement in 4 days! </s>
<s> Kully offers more power than those two systems for less. </s>
<s> www.kully.biz </s>
<s> Website is not so reliable given that they don't even have any company info. </s>
<s> They may offer a warranty, but i doubt the company's very reliable. </s>
<s> Monarch, suggest by John Robie offers a wide range of parts for a pretty decent price and is quite reliable. </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> The Emachine you are describing is the T3103 ...Simpron 3100 processor and is on sale at Circuity City until Saturday night with 17&quot;CRT(large-not LCD) monitor and printer for $419.97. </s>
<s> http://www.circuitcity.com/rpsm/oid/121906/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do#tabs http://www.circuitcity.com/rpsm/oid/121906/bundleId/1281/rpem/ccd/bundleDetail.do This is apparently a new product as emachine does not have it listed yet, and I am unable to tell if it has a AGP or PCIe slot for graphics upgrade. </s>
<s> The Compaq Intel Pentium4 Processor 515J (2.9GHz) Desktop Package that you describe is shown in the Circuit City flyer, but not online. </s>
<s> It is also on sale with 17&quot; CRT(large-not LCD) monitor and printer for $549 until Saturday night. </s>
<s> It has integrated on board graphics with the Intel 915GV chipset, so does not have an AGP or PCIe slot. </s>
<s> When you see media or digital reader 8-1 or 9-1, it is the same as memory card reader. </s>
<s> As others have suggested, I would also suggest waiting on the T6212 sale package to reappear. </s>
<s> It was on sale around the 1st week of last month for $549.98 with 17&quot; CRT(large-not LCD) monitor and printer at Circuity City and Best Buy. </s>
<s> Clicking on to the kully 'Pre-Built', the starting at $399 Budget System is not equalivent and then clicking on to &quot;Customize this System&quot; does not give a list of components & prices to customize like other builders, but wants you to email, or contact by telephone. </s>
<s> Now my quandry is THIS...I had read a couple weeks ago BIG DISCUSSIONS about the problems with this particular model. </s>
<s> I am not sure what the problem was but I read there was one. </s>
<s> It was allegedly going to be fixed in this month..May. </s>
<s> Do any of you know if the problem has been fixed? </s>
<s> and if not how will I know the problem has been fixed? </s>
<s> Kim PS thank you for all your insightful replies! </s>
<s> As I recall, the &quot;BIG PROBLEM&quot;, was that one person had a problem with the hard drive and said a person at Best Buy told him it was a defect in the T6212. </s>
<s> Others have not had a problem with the hard drive and one person said no one at the Best Buy store he checked are aware of a problem. </s>
<s> I also talked to a Best Buy rep in my city and he is unaware of any hard drive problems. </s>
<s> RielTime talked to the emachine people Friday AM to get info on the power supply. </s>
<s> If you are concerned, you could call emachine. </s>

<s> What is this all this business I have been reading about upgrades? </s>
<s> What are the most common upgrades and what do they provide? </s>
<s> Kim </s>
<s> For what you and your husband current need, no upgrade is necessary. </s>
<s> The upgrade is mainly for gaming, and would also help in video editing, but especially your kids when they want to play more advanced games and or get older. </s>
<s> The T6212 caught on for gamers (and others) mainly because of the features it has for the price. </s>
<s> It has a fairly powerful processor, the Athlon 64 3200, which has the 64-bit support for the future, AMD's better socket 939 which usually doesn't come with inexpensive computers (I don't know of any), a motherboard which has a PCI-Express x16 video card slot allowing for upgrade of the Integrated on board grahics. </s>
<s> The new PCI-Express (PCIe) video cards are the future slowly replacing AGP cards. </s>
<s> A 160GB hard drive, 512MB of RAM (memory), 17&quot; monitor and printer are also a plus for an inexpensive computer. </s>
<s> What the upgrade people are talking about is (mainly for gaming) replacing the Integrated on board graphics with a PCI-Express video card. </s>
<s> The RAM is currently ok for current games, but some gamers believe the really high end games will benefit with up to 1024MB of RAM. </s>
<s> Over that is really throwing away $$ at this time for any benefit IMO. </s>
<s> Many inexpensive computers come with integrated graphics and no way to upgrade to a AGP or PCIe video card (they don't have a 'slot'). </s>
<s> The only way they have to upgrade the graphics is to use a regular PCI card, which is less powerful and limited to how high you can go in performance. </s>
<s> You can expect your kids, as they get older, to ask you to upgrade to a video card, and the PCIe is actually less expensive than AGP. </s>
<s> In addition, perhaps your husband will observe a game he likes and get into it. </s>
<s> Or even you. </s>
<s> I was 66 years old and watching a nephew play some PC games which got me interested in buying my 1st computer. </s>

<s> The eMachine you are discussing, I think T3313 with a Sempron processor is , based on the processor a socket A mobo or possibly sockey 754. </s>
<s> Definately AGP video. </s>
