I had thought I would go with the 54K drives myself.
Question about the watts... how would that be measured?
Is that measured as a constant draw on power @ the hard drive's maximum speed over a measured period of time?
Is there an industry standard or would each manufacturer have their own way of coming up with the numbers?
I imagine the information would only be available from the manufacturer's web site if they thought to post it.
