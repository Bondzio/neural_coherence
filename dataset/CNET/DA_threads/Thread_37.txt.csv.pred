1.1.1	hi i am unable to network my 2 computers .	St
1.1.2	Compter A : is a eMachine t6410 XP , AMD Anthlon 64 Processor .	St
1.1.3	2.19 Ghz , 512 MB of RAM .	St
1.1.4	Computer B : HP Pavillion w/Windows Millenium .	St
1.1.5	AMD Celeron 1ghz processor with 125 mb of ram .	St
1.1.6	I am trying to network these two with a RJ-45 crossover cable but have had no success .	St
1.1.7	I ran ''Network setup '' on my ICS ( computer A XP ) & on my Comp .	St
1.1.8	( B ( ME ) .	St
1.1.9	But when i completed it , it said to run Network Setup Wizard on my other computer from the XP CD .	St
1.1.10	My computer did not come with it and does not have a floppy , so i ran the one that came with my Windows ME computer .	St
1.1.11	Maybe thats the issue ? ..	Ques
1.1.12	both are set for default workground 'MSHOME ' and checked off file/printer settings to be enabled .	St
1.1.13	Problem : When i try to access my network/view my network on my XP ( A ) , i get the message : ''MShome is not accessible .	St
1.1.14	You might not have permission to use this network resource .	St
1.1.15	Contact the adminstrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions .	St
1.1.16	-This list of servers for this workgroup is not currecntly avialable . ''	St
1.1.17	And when i try to access my network on my ( B ) .	St
1.1.18	It only shows my ( B ) on the network workgroup list and not my ( A ) .	St
1.1.19	so anyone please help ?	Ques
1.1.20	?	Ques
1.2.1	1 ) When using a crossover cable , you usually need to assign each system with a proper TCP/IP address .	St
1.2.2	The default networking setting for Windows is & quot ; Obtain Address Automatically & quot ; but with a 2-system crossover , there is no DHCP server giving out the addresses .	St
1.2.3	Thus you have to manually assign one .	St
1.2.4	Use 192.168.1.101 for the first system and 192.168.1.102 for the second system .	St
1.2.5	2 ) You mentioned that you had already set both systems to the same workgroup name and turned on file sharing in the network properties .	St
1.2.6	You must ALSO set the particular drives/folders you wish to work with as shared .	St
1.2.7	Right click on it in Explorer and then go to the Sharing item in the context-menu .	St
1.2.8	Further with XP , you need to manage the firewall settings to allow the other system to come through .	St
1.2.9	HTH dw	St
1.3.1	i set a manuel ip address to my second computer ( Win Me ) and added files/folders to be shared .	St
1.3.2	I also fixed my firewall settings ( zonealarm 4.5 ) to allow connections from my ( Win XP ) .	St
1.3.3	So when i try to view my workgroup MSHOME , it only shows the computer by itself , not the other .	St
1.3.4	This also applies to my other computer , exactly .	St
1.3.5	But for a moment , it showed & quot ; Hpcomp & quot ; on my XP .	St
1.3.6	But when i try to click on & quot ; Properties & quot ; on the Hpcomp icon in my workgroup , it says & quot ; the server Hpcomp could not be found on the network. & quot ; .	St
1.3.7	But the icon was there ... And when it tryed to run the icon ( Hpcomp ) it said : & quot ; \\Hpcomp is not accessible , you do not have permission to use this network resource .	St
1.3.8	Contact administrator of this erver to find out if you have acess permissions .	St
1.3.9	The network path was not found. & quot ; But now , it doesnt show it no more , and i cant ping it by name either .	St
1.3.10	So in the work group on my Win Me and XP , it only shows it the computer name by itself .	St
1.3.11	and not the other one ...	St
1.3.12	? ? ?	Ques
1.3.13	?	Ques
1.4.1	You will need to manually set the IP address of the ethernet port on both computers .	Sug
1.4.2	The first three parts of the dotted numbers must be the same and the fourth number is different for each system .	St
1.4.3	I am assuming here that you connect to the internet by dial-up ?	Ques
1.4.4	The dial-up connectoid would still be set to automatically acquire an IP address from your ISP .	St
1.4.5	Second , turn off ZoneAlarm and the Windows firewall for now .	St
1.4.6	Establish connectivity between the systems with no interference from the firewalls and once you know you can see the systems from each other , then bring the firewalls back up and fight with them as necessary to get them to behave .	St
1.4.7	As for pinging , try pinging from one to the other by IP address rather than by name .	St
1.4.8	dw	St
1.5.1	I got it , i dont really know how but i did it .	St
1.5.2	with the firewalls , n all , disabling like you said then work from there .	St
1.5.3	Thanks for the help , honestly !	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	ok. i can share files n stuff like that .	St
1.7.2	But when i try to use the internet on the Win Me comp , it doesnt work .	St
1.7.3	Just as if i was Offline ... I remember when i ran the Network Wizard that i chose my XP to be my ICS and when i ran it on Win Me , i chose that it wasnt an ics but connected to the internet through another computer ... and any idea why it dont work ?	Ques
1.7.4	?	Ques
1.8.1	The internet was not part of the original question .	St
1.8.2	You asked about networking the two computers by crossover cable .	St
1.8.3	So how do you ( or maybe I should say & quot ; how did you & quot ; ) connect to the internet ?	Ques
1.8.4	Dialup , broadband , how ?	Ques
1.8.5	We need to see the whole picture to give the right answers .	St
1.8.6	dw	St
1.9.1	hmm my mistake , but i use 56k Dial-up .	St
1.9.2	My XP is the ICS and my Win Me , is going to connect to the internet when it needs it through my XP ... & quot ; so how do I ? & quot ; -Modem used on XP : SoftV92 Data Fax Modem with SmartCP -Provider : PeoplePC Online	St
1.10.1	Here is a tutorial on setting up ICS in XP http : //www.practicallynetworked.com/sharing/xp_ics/ When setting it up , choose your dial up connection as the connection to be shared , and select your network adapter as the bridge to your internal network .	St
1.10.2	On the client ME system , skip the & quot ; client wizard disk , & quot ; do n't really need it .	St
1.10.3	Just be certain the TCP/IP properties of the ethernet adapter in the ME system is set back to & quot ; obtain address automatically. & quot ; It should acquire such an address from the XP system - if the XP system is turned on .	St
1.10.4	The probable address it will acquire is 192.168.0.2 .	St
1.10.5	The trouble with ICS is that the server ( your XP ) system must be running in order for the client ( your ME ) system ( s ) to connect to the internet - but with dialup you do n't have many options , at least not free ones .	St
1.10.6	Also , which is not as often recognized , the server system must be already on before the client is turned on .	St
1.10.7	The server issues the inside IP addresses , and if there is no server when the ME system boots , it is going to search in vain for 30 seconds and then assign itself a default 169. ? . ? . ?	Ques
1.10.8	address .	St
1.10.9	First , you waste 30 seconds in the boot time , second , the address you get will fail to connect to the ICS server as it is a different series .	St
1.10.10	The ideal solution is to ignore the standard guidance I gave above about setting the ME system back to & quot ; obtain automatically. & quot ; Instead , set a static IP for the ME 's ethernet adapter to 192.168.0.xxx where xxx is between 100 and 254 .	St
1.10.11	This will allow the XP ICS server to issue up to 98 of its own addresses to other clients ( not likely in your house , right ? )	Ques
1.10.12	before it would ever run into conflict with the assigned address of the ME system .	St
1.10.13	This will also cut that wasted 30 seconds off the ME boot time when it looks for the XP system which may not already be on .	St
1.10.14	dw	St
