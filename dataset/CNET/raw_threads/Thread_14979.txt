It was 129.99 after rebates + I got a Staples $30 credit so $100 and it has built in eithernet. I got it and setup was vedry easy inserted the ink cartridges and plugged the printer inot the back of my router. Installing the software on my pc's couldn't be easier, it found the printer, no messing aroudn with changing IP address or anything It installs the printer and fax drivers on the PC. You can scan from the MFC tonay pc onthe network with installed software. Just hit the scan button on the MFC and scroll through the list of computers on the network, select 1, and hit the scan button and the document is scanned across the network to the computer. Print quality is OK for an inkjst. The thing is very slow at scanning but may be in part because I have a slow wireless B network

There seems to be a lot of interest in putting a multi-function printer into a home network so all users can access the variety of features, but as you probably knew (but others are finding out the hard way), most multi-function printers can't be adapted to network use. It's good to hear that you've found one that works reasonably well. dw
