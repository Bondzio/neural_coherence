Not necessarily.
However, I'm overly cautious and when you're mixing RAM from different manufacturers and adding 2x512MBs to a system with 2x256MBs, I'd always put the higher density DIMMs, the 2x512s, in the first two slots.
In the event there's any incompatibility or abnormal behavior ... you can pull the 2x256s and still have dual channel and 1GB RAM.
