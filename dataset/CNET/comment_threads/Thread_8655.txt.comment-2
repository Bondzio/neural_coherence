This purely depends on your application and needs.
In most of my projects, the clients prefer to use Linux on Dell's.
IMHO, Sun makes great servers and Solaris is a rock solid OS however given their present financial state, I am not sure how long Sun is going to be in business.
So if you're looking for long terms support, be careful about getting into a Sun platform.
As for Storage, consider SAN's from SUN, Hitachi.
We recently deployed Apple X-Serve RAID and it works great coupled with a good fibre-switch.
