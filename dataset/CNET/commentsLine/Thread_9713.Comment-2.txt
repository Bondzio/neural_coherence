i haven't used the new sony desktops (i build my own desktops now anyway), but i usually recommend avoiding sony for a few reasons.
1. sony products are usually at least slightly overpriced.
they're good, but not at that cost 2. sony's warranty services.
sony's products are good when they work.
however, if you have a product/component quit working for any reason, be prepared to fight like hell to even get them to acknowledge the warranty.
they will actively try to get out of replacing something that is clearly in warranty.
3. while not so much anymore, sony used to be big on using proprietary formats for everything (md players using atrac3, digicams using sony memory sticks, etc)
