I dont need one of these Barton 64 jobbies, I simply want the cheapest possible processor upgrade to cope with the newer demands i`m placing on the system. I have 2 800 gig HD`s, and 2 DVD burners. 512Meg DDR ram GForce 64meg GFX card, and I use the onboard sound card. Running WinXP home SP2 and I`m sharing a wireless network connection with a similar spec computer in my kitchen via a USR router/modem. As I say, I`m not looking to launch the space shuttle with this system, I just want some advice on the processor upgrades available for my socket A board. Last time I did this, it was AMD Athlon Or Duron (XP processors?) to choose from, now there is only something called a Sempron? What are these? and how do they compare to the Athlon series of the past? Is an AMD Sempron 2400 similar to the AMD Athlon XP2300 Ive used on a friends PC? Many thanks for any advice you can offer.

Hi Denille, I'm in a very similar position to you, with a similar spec PC that I built about 3 years ago. I'd like to upgrade the processor, possibly to a dual core proc, and I'd like to boost my RAM from 1GB to 2GB. The thing that's holding me back is replacing the motherboard. My original motherboard blew a year ago, and when Windows booted on the new motherboard it didn' recognise any of the hardware and needed to be re-installed. (I then formatted the wrong hard drive -- my data HD instead of my OS HD, but that's another story!) Re-installing Windows and all my apps is such a pain that it's putting me off. Tom's Hardware Guide has an impressive CPU overview, here: http://www.tomshardware.com/cpu/20051121/index.html Good luck, Neil

Actually, I disconnect just about everything nonessential. Once the OS is in I start hooking things up. I don't know how wide spread it is that people install OS with more than one HDD connected but it could be a lot of the probs people are having.

Ignore the message about the emachines, if your capable of building a system yourself, stay on that path, even if your not, stay away from emachnes. Having said that, sempron is loosely stated, AMD's new naming convention for it's second grade processor. So, to you, it's a duron. They are available in a few different socket configs, and in 64 bit support, but it doesn't sound like you're to interested in 64 bit support for what you're doing anyway. In answer to the next issue, it is advisable to disconnect any non O/S hard drives, install the O/S, and then connect them. The reason really, is to prevent headaches for non, shall we say expert, users who can perform most of these functions. There is a danger that during the winxp setup, you format and install to the wrong drive, and/or, windows picks up the data drive as c: and you have no clue how to fix it. The latter of the scenarios is rare but I've had it happen to me. After I realized it was my own &quot;duh&quot; moment, but it cost me some time, and a &quot;non expert user&quot; might have not been able to effectively cope with that situation without grey hair. As a rule of thumb, on regular ol' IDE channels, better to have your primary windows drive on it's own channel by itself if possible. If not make it the master on the primary channel, meaning is jumpered to master or cable select, and connected to the ide connector at the END of the cable, not the one in the middle.

After leaving here I went and did some surfing and found a couple of excellent comparison sites. Basically, yes, the Sempron is the old Duron. I did build my own 2 pc`s from scratch, and I have the basic knowledge required to keep em both running when parts and programs fail... but I just dont keep track of the high-spec of much of the procesing power these days as its fairly irrelevent to my needs. To clarify from what I read elsewhere, if you can buy an Athlon XP(number) somewhere , its the better choice over the Sempron if only because of power/price ratios.
