Is that Windows 98 was not installed fully.
The motherboard drivers and what else are usually unknown to most people and ... never installed by Microsoft.
As it stands, your post is incomplete and the reason you reinstalled the OS is missing and more.
Best of luck figuring this out with such a limited posting.
