in the 80's i had a commador that i played a couple of games on, but the kids wrecked it and it wasn't til the early 90's when my cousin who was a vice-president of a retailer called software, etc.
was upgrading their computers and sold me an ibm xt with a dot matrix printer, and like they say, &quot;the rest is history&quot;.
i now own 2 pc's and just last fall purchased the latest laptop from toshiba that i use when we travel.
my wife complains i spend more time with my computers than i do with her.
she's probably right.
