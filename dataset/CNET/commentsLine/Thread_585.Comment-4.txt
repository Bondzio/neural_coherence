i'm afraid it is impossible to say more about it with the information you give.
it might even be a second internal hard disk in stead of an external device.
and it might be, for example, that it still has to be partitioned and formatted using disk management.
that should be in the manual.
nothing much to do but wait till your brother returns.
or bring it to a local shop and let them fix it.
if they see it, they will know what to do with it to get it up and running.
