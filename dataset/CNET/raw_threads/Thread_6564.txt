I've 640 In Ram and the processor runs at 2.53mghz. Well, the problem is that I've ripped some dvd movies, and then copied then on dvd -r media, I've tried(memorex, tdk and verbatim), and when I finish, they all play well on the computer dvd, but when I put them on my sony dvd player in the living room, I get some still screens and some skips. All of them are like that, and I've tried in different dvd player that support the dvd -r/+r and so forth. I've use Cyberlink Dvdcopy, Dvd Shrink, Nero Burning Room. I've burn at different speeds also, and I got the same problem. I've disable any background program while burning, and leave the computer alone to do its job, but it is the same. I go see the movie, it plays really well, but then some scenes in the movie get still for seconds or skip. I Would love help, since I don't know what to do. I just feel like throwing my dvd burner to the garbage. Thanks.

Why? It did that on DVD+R and DVD-R from any machine/drive. You need to try another DVD player. In closing, I am thinking the 4X media should be burned at 2X, 8X at 4X and so on. Just a nagging feeling it works better. No websites to back me up, just me. Bob

I've since re-formatted and may have deleted some files(???); the fact is I'm having the same problem. Don't even &quot;see a disc&quot; message. but plays well in the original burniong PC. I am going to try another burner perhaps. Please let me know if you have a solution. Thanks.
