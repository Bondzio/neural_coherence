I am not a gamer, just need a reliable home computer that I will not need to replace in a couple of years. I mainly will use for business which includes standard word processing, spreadsheets, email etc. I also do some video and audio burning. The basic configuration is shown below and the cost of this machine is approx. $1100. It seems like a pretty good machine for the price, but I am not an expert. I am also looking at VelocityMicro, but for a similar config. they are more expensive. Thoughts. Model: a1025c-b HP Intel Pentium 4 Processor 630 with HT Technology (3.0GHz,800MHz SB,L2 Cache = 2MB) 1GB PC2-3200 DDR2 SDRAM memory (2 x 512MB for ultimate performance - expanadable to 4GB) 200GB 7200RPM Serial ATA hard drive DVD-ROM drive 16x max. speed LightScribe Double Layer 16X DVDR/RW drive with CD writer capabilities: 16x DVD+R, 8x DVD-R, 4x DVDRW, 2.4x DVD+R DL, 16x DVD-ROM, 40x CDR, 24x CDRW, 40x CD-ROM 17&quot; LCD monitor with integrated speakers Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition with Service Pack 2

You can get the same performance for half the price. don't get fooled by ddr2, its not faster, amd's with its integrated memory controller still beats it.

I did do some brief research awhile back on this machine and I kind of remember it getting a somewhat average review. I will look further into it. Thanks again for your suggestion.
