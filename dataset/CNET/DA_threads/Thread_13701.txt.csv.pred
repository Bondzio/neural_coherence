1.1.1	ok, hang with me here... 1.	St
1.1.2	I get MetroFi here in Portland, OR.	St
1.1.3	A free city-wide wifi service, which is actually pretty good, I live 2 houses away from a hub.	St
1.1.4	2.	St
1.1.5	I also have a Playstation 3, which recognizes the &quot;MetroFi&quot; signal but cannot connect b/c there is a login page when you first access the internet on a computer.	St
1.1.6	3.	St
1.1.7	I was told by a MetroFi volunteer that I have to pull in the free Metro-Fi signal, through a wireless router (I have a Linksys Wireless Router that wifi'ed my old Comcast connection).	St
1.1.8	Then the PS3 will be able to read it.	St
1.1.9	How can I accomplish this?!	St
1.1.10	I have a Mac, fwiw.	St
1.1.11	please let me know if I can explain further.	Sug
1.2.1	metrofi wifi modem -&gt; (ethernet) -&gt; WAN PORT of your router.	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	sorry Bob, I dont understand.	Polite
1.3.2	there is no MetroFi modem.	St
1.3.3	It's a wireless signal that Im able to get in my house.	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	Thank you for helping Bob, but I just dont understand what you're trying to say.	St
1.5.2	You write in a cryptic manner.	St
1.5.3	Everything is wifi ready...my router, Mac and PS3.	St
1.5.4	It was all working fine when I had Comcast High-Speed, but obviously it came into my house as ethernet, then I routed it to the Linksys Wireless Router, which my PS3 was able to pick up.	St
1.6.1	It's a http://www.netgear.com/Products/PrintServers/WirelessPrintServers/WGPS606.aspx This device connects to some wifi WAP and then it's clients don't have to do anything as to logins.	St
1.6.2	I can also connect one of those ports to the wan port of a router and viola, I have something just like your normal wifi router connected to broadband.	St
1.6.3	I know what you want to do but I don't know if you have the hardware.	St
1.6.4	Maybe you wanted to use a PC but didn't tell.	St
1.6.5	I could note &quot;ICS&quot; but with all the web docs about that I won't copy those here.	St
1.6.6	Bob	St
1.7.1	thanks Bob, but I would like to use my current hardware.	Polite
1.7.2	I was told it could be done.	St
1.7.3	can anyone else help?	Ques
1.8.1	http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/networking/expert/bowman_02april08.mspx Then you use that ethernet off to the wan port of the router... Definitely a way to learn TCPIP!	St
1.8.2	Bob	St
1.9.1	It would help to learn the model number of the Linksys Wireless Router you have -- maybe that model has an ethernet bridge mode.	St
1.9.2	Also, please confirm that you can connect to MetroFi with your existing Mac.	Sug
1.9.3	Generally, what is needed to connect a wireless network to your home network is an Ethernet Bridge MetroFi wireless cloud &lt;-wireless-&gt; Wireless Ethernet Bridge &lt;-ethernet-&gt; home LAN router with Ethernet ports and/or wireless WANport If the home LAN router has both both wireless capability and ethernet LAN ports, you can connect to that router with _either_ wireless _or_ ethernet cable on both* your PS3 and your Mac.	St
1.9.4	*Wireless LAN connections assumes that your PS3 and Mac have wireless capability built in (or added as an option.)	St
1.9.5	One _example_ of a wireless ethernet bridge is Buffalo Technology AirStation Turbo G High Power Wireless Ethernet Converter (WLI-TX4-G54HP) But for the same cost, I would just buy the Ruckus Wireless solution that MetroFi features.	St
1.9.6	Ruckus MM2211	St
1.10.1	I went to Frys in Wilsonville for an external antenna that had been advertised in a MetroFi Internet ad several months ago.	St
1.10.2	A helpful clerk convinced me to buy a different external antenna and two 15-foot booster cables.	St
1.10.3	I plugged the booster cable from the antenna into my laptops USB port.	St
1.10.4	I disabled my laptops internal modem so I could use the IEEE wireless USB utility.	St
1.10.5	Now, I open the double-pane window and set the antenna outside to receive a strong signal (85-95%) inside my apartment.	St
1.10.6	I leave the window open just enough for the cable, and I can have the laptop on a desk across the room.	St
1.10.7	Not very wireless, but it is free.	St
1.10.8	Otherwise, I have to sit outside on my balcony to get MetroFi.	St
