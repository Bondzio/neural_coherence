IOW.... you need to duplicate the email settings on each PC then leave a copy on the server for a specified time period so that each PC will pick up the messages when logged in.

So, it is better to configure it only on one pc. The configuration is on OE menu--&gt; tools, accounts, click your account, properties, advance.
7595	4	120284	1366680	1365577	Michael Geist	8/17/05 2:53 PM	1.12429038E12	I usually set the server....	to hold a copy for 5 days, that's enough time for me. How it works is each PC when accessing OE will download any messages available. Each PC will only download a particular email once. After 5 days (for me) the mail is removed from the server. The settings are where Melati pointed.
