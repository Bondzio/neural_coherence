It's a 120 gig IEDE Maxtor ultra ATA 133, but only 5400 RPM and &lt;13 average seek time. Since I am upgrading equipment (P4 3.0 Mhz, 512MB PC3200 DDR 400MHz) to speed things up; Is this drive considered &quot;old stuff&quot;. Or does ist matter.

In their test they did not see much of a diff. Yes 7200 was slightly better. Where they did see a big diff was in cache size. Bigger is better. So if your looking to squeeze out all the juice get a 7200 unit with the biggest cache you can find/afford

However, if you are upgrading things, may consider getting a new 7200 drive. and using the old drive for a backup. Just a thought, as the 5400 drive will probably serve you well.

You don't even want to consider the slower drive in anything but a laptop. I have upgraded many in the past and in every case the owner immediately noticed their system was quite a bit faster.
