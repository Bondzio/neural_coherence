or rather ubuntu (see google).
i often test such machines with a linux cd to see if the graphics choke under linux.
if it fails in linux it surely is a machine with issues.
-&gt; about the board swap.
this is where hp and such has it all over the little guy.
they have the boards and can do the test, call in the engineers and more.
but your description is just like what i've seen with failed video ram.
however since we can't replace that with ease or safely then the board swap is the right way.
