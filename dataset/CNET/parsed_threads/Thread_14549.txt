<s> Looking to upgrade my eMachine T5026. </s>
<s> Putting in a Gigabyte GA-MA69GM-S2H and AMD64 X2 6000+ CPU,2GB DDR2 800 Ram. </s>
<s> The power supply that comes with the T5026 I believe is 300w, is this enough to power my new system or do I need to go 500w. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance Also i'm using integrated graphics, may use PCIe slot in the future. </s>
<s> If you're not going to add to the system other than mtrbd. </s>
<s> replacement then the original psu will do fine. </s>
<s> At least you know if problems crop-up then upgrade the psu. </s>
<s> if you plan to really stuff the system, then add it then during the mtrbd. </s>
<s> install if for anything the system is open to do so. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I'd look at a new power supply, just to be safe, and given that that X2 is probably leaps and bounds above whatever its replacing, in power consumption and performance. </s>
<s> I'd also look for a high quality PSU over sheer wattage ratings, I can't stress this enough, and if you do decide to skimp on it anyways, all we can do is look on and say &quot;Told ya so&quot; http://www.xoxide.com/buy-computer-power-supplies.html A few manufacturers to add to that list: Corsair Memory (rebadged SeaSonic parts) OCZ Technology (very reputable manufacturer) </s>
