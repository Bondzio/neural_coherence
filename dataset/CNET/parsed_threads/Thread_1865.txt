<s> I just finished putting together my dream computer. </s>
<s> I turn it on, and everything lights up for a fraction of a second, and goes off. </s>
<s> I do this a few times, and finally it stays on - but there's no display from the video card. </s>
<s> It seems random whether or not the system will have short, &quot;false starts&quot;, or stay on (again, with no functionality or display). </s>
<s> I've tried removing everything and reseating everything. </s>
<s> Is this likely a power supply problem? </s>
<s> Or the CPU? </s>
<s> Two separate problems? </s>
<s> (I'm paranoid about CPU damage - I feel like I had to press it down pretty hard on it, both when I locked the bracket and when I mounted the heatsink. </s>
<s> It's a socket 775 with the pins on the socket, not the chip) </s>
<s> pull the motherboard out of the case (yes it's a big pain but you should have done this before installing MB in case) put it on a piece of cardboard and try it with nothing but the PSU, CPU, RAM, video card, keyboard and monitor connected. </s>
<s> If you can't get it running at this config...then CLEAR CMOS and last check the CPU installation. </s>
<s> Once it's running, then start connecting the various peripherals one at at time. </s>
<s> Then retest. </s>
<s> Once all the components are connected and the system's still running ...then put it all back in the case. </s>
<s> Keep us posted. </s>
<s> VAPCMD VAPCMD </s>
<s> Check to see if you took plastic cover off back of CPU chip. </s>
<s> I almost closed the cover onto it because motherboard instructions don't tell you to remove it while the CPU instructions do.... </s>
<s> The heatsink will be easier to fit too if this is the case... </s>
