<s> I have an older pc which I still want my family to use and I bought a new pc with an lcd monitor that I want to use for professional work but I have no space to put my older pc so I want to know if there is a way that I can connect both my pc to the same monitor so I can switch from work pc to my home pc. </s>
<s> Is there a vga cable that I could buy so I can connect them. </s>
<s> By the way my monitor only has 1 vga input. </s>
<s> Thanks if you help. </s>
<s> There exist devices called KVM switches (Keyboard Video Mouse). </s>
<s> The best of them are the electronically switched ones, but the only ones I've ever seen in that flavor are 8-way, and quite pricey. </s>
<s> A few years ago I purchased a 4 way mechanical switch at a local Mom&Pop computer shop. </s>
<s> It was quite reasonable, and has worked fairly well, with only a few minor glitches due to contact problems. </s>
<s> Try here. </s>
