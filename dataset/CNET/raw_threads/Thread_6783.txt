STATUS: wait - do not buy	http://www.macbookrandomshutdown.com/ Apparently, this is a BIG problem, which Apple refuses to acknowledge. I contacted several Apple stores (incl. 1-800-MY-APPLE), and ALL their employees are just playing dumb. Sad ...

Then it will still just shut off with no warning at all. I got this to use with my DJ biz and do not use it cause I can't trust it to work. What have you heard?
