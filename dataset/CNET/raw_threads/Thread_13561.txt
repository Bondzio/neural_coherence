Maxtor Diamondmax 9 Hard Drive Nvidia Geforce FX 5700VE 256 Video Mb. 250 Watt Power Supply ( not sure what the motherboard is....) Whenever I buy games, I do look at the system requirements and the recommended requirements, however some games like World of Warcraft and Far Cry has a recommended spec that is close to my computer's specs, but when I play those kind of games, I experience lots of lags, and my computer won't be able to handle graphics to the max. Since my computer is a recommended computer, how come it lags?

To run Far Cry at it's max requires a far greater machine that the specs they note on the side of the game box. But not everyone will tell you this. Bob

You'll likely have to turn the graphics in Far Cry way down to play smoothly. That's how my FX5600XT was. That's how my 6200TC is...for Far Cry.

XP eats many resources and perhaps you can get them to temporarily 'go away' by using the W98 setting instead? If not, you can always turn it back to XP and use some of the other suggestions here.
