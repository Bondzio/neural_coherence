first there is no standard dvd that holds such.
then you have players that don't play recorded media to those that play dvd+r but not dvd-r and vice versa.
there is no panacea.
however i continue to use dvd flick for simple video dvds and for photos i may try  or just put the jpegs on a data dvd and find that many of the newer players work fine.
sorry but this is a minefield of problems, issues, compatibilities and more.
i've found i need to choose my battles here.
