hello ... i have an old compaq desktop whose onboard video circuits have gone bad.
but i also have an ati radeon 9800 pro video card on the machine, so i figured i'd just use its display output as a substitute.
when i boot up, i get the usual bios text and the windows xp splash screen displayed normally ... but when xp continues to load, a suddenly get a letterboxed display with about ten smeared copies of the xp logon (some even look like they are being reflected off the sides of the monitor tube) so i obviously can't read what's going or or use the system.
although the ati card was been installed ages ago, i obviously never used its monitor output.
would this be a driver problem of some kind?
any ideas how i could get back in action, short of trying to replace my motherboard?
thanks in advance for any help.
