1.2.1	AGP is somewhat old, I wouldn't recommend buying a motherboard with an AGP slot.	St
1.2.2	Get the new PCI-e x16.	St
1.2.3	I for one believe this change was abolutely useless (and SLi proves it!).	St
1.2.4	But few cards are released for AGP nowadays.	St
1.2.5	Today, I'd go with Nvidia for your North and/or South Bridge.	St
1.2.6	nForce 4 Ultra or SLi chipsits are good.	St
