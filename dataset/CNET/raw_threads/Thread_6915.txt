For all intents and purposes, it really doesn't provide much other than pictures and basic install and info. Just make a 1-page document that describes how to install, laminate it if you want. HP may have a reference file on that model, check to see. good luck -----Willy

I read a few of the hits I supplied and you can buy the manual from them for about 10 bucks. It's my choice to share how to find such with a crafty GOOGLE, but just like showing where the water is, I don't fill the water glass and hand it over. Since it's a gift, the new owner should be chided if they complain about this manual. Instead, print what's on HP's web site about this printer. Since hp.com is alive, well and I can find that printer, I leave your work to you. Bob

Found nothing about this printer on HP's website and no manual on the 3.5 floppies that came with the printer. Most of the sites you suggested do not have the manual and the ones that do want an outrageous price for it.
5305	6	28552	324845	324743	R. Proffitt	7/8/04 5:52 PM	1.08930912E12	Yes. It can cost.	More than a new printer even, but some want the paper. I won't write that what I saw on my manual was worth keeping (oops, I just did.) At least it's possible to replace the manual, but seeing its a gift, maybe just like a gift horse, don't look the gift horse in the _____. Bob

I find many and usually, they're good to go and yes, I don't need the manual, just the drivers. Of course the ptr. works, but the cost of ink carts makes it a doubtful deal, but when then the end-users are pretty happy to pay when the cost is nominal and it works, plus usually these prtrs. I salvage are more than simple bottom-end models if new. Well, sad to hear the manual would cost too much. adios -----Willy
