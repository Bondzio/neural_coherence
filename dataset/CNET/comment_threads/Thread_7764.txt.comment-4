Hi again, Thanks for your replies, I have a pc desktop AMD sempron 1.8 {3000} asrock m/board since my last post the fan has been operating ok, it runs ok for a spell then at start up the grinding noise kicks in, but always goes when I restart,does this give you a clue of the problem, what do you further advise for a permanent solution, it is just out of warranty {over a year}
