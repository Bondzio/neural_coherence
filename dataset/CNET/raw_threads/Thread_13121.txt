4690	0	266071	2595343	NR	jafryar	9/29/07 10:02 AM	1.19106012E12	USB Drive	I have an external USB drive and I tried to get 2 drives working on the IDE side of the USB inards but when I hook up the drives (1 master and 1 slave), only one drive shows up in Windows XP Pro...I figured that USB does not support multi-IDE drives as master and slave but not sure...can anyone help? (Drobos are too expensive!)
