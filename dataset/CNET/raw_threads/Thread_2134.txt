Wondering if I could take out the rollers from any other PS/2 mouse and replace them without totally destroying this mouse and get it back up and running right? I'm using a newer MS Intellipoint Trackball, but the ball is much larger than the old mouse and isn't as comfortable in my small hand as the older Trackball because they designed the newer one to be more 'correct' with how your hand lays on it. It may be more correct, but it's hard to get used to and I find my hand actually getting tired more often because of the size of the ball itself being so much larger than the other. You need a hand the size of Paul Bunyon's to fit on this one comfortably.... TONI

I suggest you check local Goodwill or Sal. Army as time permits and see if any are on the shelfs or local shops. Further, try another new one from whatever source until then. With there being so many versions of the mouse available a visit to the OfficeMax, etc. is a good start too. tada -----Willy

I had purchased the last four or five of them years ago at Staples and my sister got two of them. I'm down to two (one of them a puppy chewed through the cord and a friend rewired it for me and is still in the box as my last resort), and this one is getting pretty worn out as far as the rollers go now so moving the cursor across the screen takes four or five swipes with the ball now instead of just one like it should. Kind of like trying to bowl with a flat groove on the ball...... TONI

I never did like the ball sticking but didn't want the Logitech because it only had 3 buttons, no forward and back buttons. I finally broke down and got the Logitech and I'm glad I did. Smooth, smooth, smooth. I'm still getting used to navigating pages with the explorer foward and back buttons, though. It's much smaller, too.

It took a little adjusting, but now I wouldn't trade it for anything. No cords to tug at. Check with Newegg for good deals on Logitech wireless.

I've been going 'forward' with newer hardware, new techniques for getting the same thing accomplished that I could do in MSDOS but now with clicks. I've gone 'forward' to now including antivirus and firewall programs where I traveled for years without either and never got a virus until I had a program I paid for. I've been going 'forward' with watching my rebellious 8-year old son grow up, join the Navy leaving me in the wake to having to go 'backwards' to riding that mower and hauling the trash by myself again. About the only thing I haven't gone forward with was this old mouse, and if I can keep it alive for even a few more days, I'm going for it. LOL It's been the one constant that I've taken from 'forward' to 'forward' in my computer world....kind of like a real comfortable pair of old boxer shorts that I wear to sleep in (men's clothes are always so much more comfortable than what we women get talked into buying). I've gotten used to having to troubleshoot software and the occasional hardware device....I could always depend on this mouse and it's not going to be allowed to quit on me now if I can help it. heheheh People can complain all they want about MS making an operating system that they don't like, but I have to give them credit for making a piece of hardware that has given as much as it's received and kept going.
