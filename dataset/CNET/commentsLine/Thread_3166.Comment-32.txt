all hard drives have a life expectancy, over time sectors go bad even if you do not notice any issues.
there are disk utilities that will tell you if there are any issues with your drive.
crystalmark makes disk info tools however i don't think their current version supports external drives.
my recommendation would be not to store anything of value on that drive.
the drive may last several more years or it could stop working tomorrow.
acronis makes disk imaging software that would allow you to easily clone that drive's contents on to a new drive.
