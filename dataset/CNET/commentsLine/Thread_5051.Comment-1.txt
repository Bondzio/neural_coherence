not sure what happened as its not my powerbook i think it may have been dropped a few times but the os is fine.
anyway from the front to where they keyboard starts (including the touch pad) has kind of bent upward.
i can see all the orange wires and they look all connected (mite not be) but when the laptop is on they keyboard will no longer work, (having to use a usb keyboard any ideas what it could be?
loose connection?
hardware fault or software fault, but all other hardware and osx are fine.
thanks mf
