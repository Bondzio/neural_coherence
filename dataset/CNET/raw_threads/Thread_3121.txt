Any ideas of what could it be and how could i solve it. Thanks in advance.

Since there are limitations for FAT32 partitions when using the windows tool i had to use another partition software.

Well the problem is not my partition software but the hdd, while formatting and creating the partitions for it i received an error that the process couldn't be completed and then it stopped being recognized by the PC. Everytime i connect the hdd i receive a message saying that the USB driver could not be installed however it was working before i made the format and partition processes.
