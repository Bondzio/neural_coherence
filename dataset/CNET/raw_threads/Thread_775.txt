I have opted to go with AMDs as they are, in general, cheaper than Intel's counter parts. (by core counts, quad-core AMD is generally cheaper than quad-core Intel). So I am looking through the AMDs and noticed the Phenom and Athlon family. I was just wondering which family is better? Thanks

However with current Intel CPUs including hyperthreading with each core, you may be discounting them a little too soon. Bob

Used to be, you could just look at the processor family (386, 486, etc.) and speed, then look for a DX or SX suffix, and you had all the information you needed to compare parts. These days, you need a good, up-to-date reference in order to know just how one processor compares to another. While in the past I have favored AMD processors for the same reason you originally did -- lots of bang for the buck -- I'm no longer sure if AMD still offers a significant price advantage. OTOH, unless you're building a computer for gaming, AutoCAD or Photoshop, almost any of today's common desktop processors will have more than enough power for your needs -- and even with those power-hungry apps, the video card is probably more important than the CPU. I'm more concerned these days with the amount of power a CPU draws, how much heat it generates (those two go together), the amount of on-board cache, and in some cases whether it has onboard graphics; for general computing use, just about any mid-range processor is fast enough, and even some budget procs have plenty of oomph for most of the things my family does.

I asked three different computer stores to recommend a setup for my given budget and went with the one that I liked. Then I searched for the cheapest seller of each parts.
