hey mates all: i was watching a film on the net and all of the sudden,...black screenn...blue screen,,,and gone without allowing me to read the message in the blue screen...i couldn`t believe it ,since i have a p lv, 2.4 ghz, 1.00gb of ram,amd athlon (tm)64 processor3800+.
windows xp professional.sp 3.all my hardware are compatible with xp,the computer have been working fantastically for a year,since i put it together myself.
