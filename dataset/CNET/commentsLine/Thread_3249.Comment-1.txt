i am running windows xp and my start menu as well as my drop down menus are periodically jittery.
it comes and goes, and sometimes changing desktop sizes and resolutions calms it down for short periods.
there seems to be no rhyme or reason for it, and i have tried all the conventional troubleshooting methods.
sometimes the menus are so jittery that i cannot even read them.
help!
