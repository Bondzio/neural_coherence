1.1.1	Hi all.	St
1.1.2	I am receiving a Dell V313W tomorrow.	St
1.1.3	I would like to know if I can print to it from a tablet at a friends house on one network (the printer being at my house on another wifi network).	St
1.1.4	I am using Win XP with services Pack 3.	St
1.1.5	Many thanks	Polite
1.2.1	I'm going to write no you can't.	St
1.2.2	Here's a simple way to get around all the printer and network issues.	St
1.2.3	Print such to a PDF and then email the PDF to the friend to print out.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for your reply, R.Profit.	St
1.3.2	So what is cloud printing then?	St
1.3.3	I honestly don't know exactly but from what I understand it allows you to send a file to a cloud account such as gmail, which I have, and the printer will automatically print it instantly.	St
1.3.4	May be I am wrong - or am I correct and it is just that my printer doesn't support cloud printing.	St
1.3.5	I don't know.	St
1.4.1	Since you can't set it up and am unsure about it all I offered a sure fire way to get printing.	St
1.4.2	Bob	St
1.5.1	http://reviews.cnet.com/multifunction-devices/dell-all-in-one/4505-3181_7-33799919.html Hope you can return it if it doesn't meet your needs.	St
