Has anyone tested these two together? How is the image and text quality like when the monitor is connected via the analog input? Thanks, Vasile

Dell Dimension 8100 series, pentium 4 1.5gHz 256mg pc800 rdram, running windows XP with same video card. I would like the same question answered and if we need to upgrade the video card before getting the 19&quot; flat panel. I am looking at the same flat panel also. Let me know if you find a great price and have you seen the panel in person. I live 120 miles from the nearest dell store where I could view such a monitor. Thanks in advance. Roy
