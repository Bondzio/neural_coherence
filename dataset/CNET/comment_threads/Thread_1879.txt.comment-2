It could be the cable, or it could be the video board.
First, I would reload the video drivers.
If that does not work, can you borrow another monitor to plug in?
If it works, then your monitor needs to go to the shop for a new cable.
If the substitute monitor does not work, then your video board may need to be replaced.
Hope this helps Frank
