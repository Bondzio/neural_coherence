I set the jumper to Master, per the instructions that came with the enclosure. I plan on only using it for file storage. I was setting it up last night and the Computer recognized a new USB drive and I installed the drivers for it (the drivers that came with the enclosure). It did not show up in My Computer, which was predicted in the instructions. Then I installed the software that came with the HD. It found the HD and said that it was brand new and needed to be formatted. That was around 10pm last night. Around 9am this morning when I left for work it was still spinning. The progress bar hadn't moved... Is it possible that it will take this long? Vital Stats: P3 700 mhz computer Windows 98SE Thanks in advance.

But since you have a P3, 99.99% of P3s will have USB 1.1. Let me do a guess on time here. I'll state that 160GB completed in 1 hour on my p3-600 USB 2.0 connected drive. If that was true and you connected via USB 1.1 (likely!), then a straightforward bit of math shows... USB 2.0 speed / USB 1.1 speed times 250 / 160 = hours Or... 480 / 11 times 1.56 = 68.18 hours. You'll have to give it about 3 days. Bob

I don't want to duplicate all that is known about this, so catch up about this at http://www.48bitlba.com 2. http://www.usbman.com notes the usual USB 2.0 issues. But in a laptop it gets worse. Very few can install Windows properly. They'll forget some motherboard or other driver. Support is waning for this old OS, but by this time you should be an old hand at corraling the motherboard drivers, reading USBMAN and more. This OS hasn't been offered for 5 years so it's not seen as much and ... people seem to be forgetting how it works. Bob
