I just bought a Panasonic Blu-Ray player.
I want to connect it to the Internet.
It does not provide a wireless Internet connection.
I must plug in a network cable.
The problem is my computer is located in another room, and on another floor.
I have a wireless router connected to computer now though.
Is there anything I can do to get my Blu-Ray player connected to the Internet?
