Ok i just installed this belkin wireless router and was setting some configuration settings on it.
i went to the address 192.168.1.2 and was able to configure settings that affected my belkin router such as the DHCP server settings and such.
I made a mistake and changed the LAN default IP to 192.168.1.1, which was the IP for my actual other router which actually connects me to the internet.
My belkin router was previously assigned 192.168.1.2(that's how i accessed this menu to alter these settings).
As a result now i'm unable to access menu's for my modem to connect me to internet, and my belkin router.
How do i solve this as this is not a small ordinary problem about hardware?
Thanks i really hope you can think of a solution.
Thank you.
