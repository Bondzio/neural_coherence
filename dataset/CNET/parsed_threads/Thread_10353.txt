<s> I may be too young for this forum, but i need some help deciding on a laptop for school-related uses. </s>
<s> As you may have guessed, i am paying with my own money and am extremely limited by price. </s>
<s> I dont know if anyone will want to hunt a laptop down for me but i need: 1 GB of RAM 12&quot; screen &gt;1.5 GHz Built-in Wireless Price below $1,000 (as low as possible would be good) Anyway, any help will be greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> Thanks Doc </s>
<s> Sorry, this is the wrong forum! </s>
<s> Still, if you could help. </s>
<s> Boy, how things have changed; I can't remember ever needing a laptop all through high school, and I'm only 19 now. </s>
<s> But yeah, if you need an inexpensive laptop then dell would probably be in your budget. </s>
<s> Since you're not using it for gaming then 1000 should be more than enough. </s>
<s> You may be looking for a Mac though, since you posted in the Mac section, but an iBook is slightly under 1000 before tax, and will most definitly meet your needs. </s>
<s> Go for the Acer Aspire3003WLMi, DVD burning, 15.4&quot; widescreen active matrx display, wireless, 80GB HD, upgradeable RAm upto 2GB, etc. </s>
<s> ALL FOR $699 IT IS FANTASTIC </s>
<s> ...I'm 14. </s>
<s> Look at Dell. </s>
<s> I'd say the iBook is a nice fairly portable laptop, you could probably pick one up cheap from the Apple Refurbished store: http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wo/0.RSLID?mco=E60A57E5&nclm=SpecialDeals The standard 12&quot; iBook with 1GB RAM is $1099 new. </s>
