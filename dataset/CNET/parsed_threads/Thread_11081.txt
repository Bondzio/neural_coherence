<s> I just bought an iBook G4 12 inch combo. </s>
<s> And the cheap mouse (scroll one without stating that it is Mac Compatible) I bought hardly work on my Mac. </s>
<s> When I plug it in to the USB port, the mouse just doesn't work, meaning the cursor on the screen doesn't respond to it as I'm moving the mouse. </s>
<s> And when I plug it out and plug it into the other USB port, it still doesn't work until I plug it out and plug it into the first USB port that I plugged in, it works, but only for a few lucky times. </s>
<s> When the mouse is connected through USB port on my iBook and not responding, I can still use the trackpad normally. </s>
<s> Does it mean that I have to buy a &quot;Mac Compatible&quot; mouse so that this problem wouldn't occur? </s>
<s> But the guy working at the Mac shop told me that any kind of mouse will work fine on my iBook. </s>
<s> Obviously, it doesn't seem to be so though. </s>
<s> I've tried the cheap mouse I bought on both my iBook and the other PowerBook, it only works a little bit better on PowerBook, (without having to plug it in and out and in) it sometimes works on PowerBook and sometimes just simply doesn't (respond). </s>
<s> Still, this is frustrating, and also, strange. </s>
<s> I've tried checking in the System Preference&gt;Keyboard and Mouse&gt;Trackpad&gt;Trackpad options. </s>
<s> It just doesn't work even I've ticked or unticked the &quot;Ignore trackpad when mouse is present&quot;. </s>
<s> Also, I've checked in the System Profiler&gt;Hardware&gt;USB&gt;USB Bus. </s>
<s> It doesn't detect the mouse that I've plugged in to the USB port. </s>
<s> I wonder if this would be the same when buying other peripherals like external hard disk, external DVD burner, etc. </s>
<s> Would this kind of compatibilty occur? </s>
<s> I've tried opening a DVD using my external CD & DVD burner that was connected to my iBook via USB port. </s>
<s> My iBook only detected the burner when the disc was inside the burner. </s>
<s> But when I connect the burner to my iBook without the disc in it, the machine just won't detect anything. </s>
<s> That was when I started getting to know about the iBook. </s>
<s> Take the cheap mouse and throw it in the trash. </s>
<s> It is obviously defective. </s>
<s> Any USB mouse, a working one that is, will work on the Mac. </s>
<s> A DVD drive will NOT mount on the desktop unless there is a DVD/CD inside it. </s>
<s> The Mac is not like a PC in this respect. </s>
<s> If it is attached and mountable, it will be on the desk top. </s>
<s> When Mac's had floppy drives, the only time it was visible was when there was a disk in it. </s>
<s> USB HD's will mount on the desktop. </s>
<s> So far, everything you described is normal. </s>
