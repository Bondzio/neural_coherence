Our laptop is a Dell Vostro 1000 running on Windows Vista OS. Any advice is helpful. One option I have found is the Linksys WUSB100. Any feedback on that particular brand? I have seen very mixed reviews online. Thank you! Erinne

If not, I think it has a pci express slot. I'd go that route rather than USB if I could. I can't recommend a brand, however. Mixed reviews tend to be par for the course. Just don't get the lowest or highest price model. Something mid-range. Linksys is popular and owned by a reputable company that sells high end equipment. It should be ok. My own favorite brands have been 3com and USRobotics.
