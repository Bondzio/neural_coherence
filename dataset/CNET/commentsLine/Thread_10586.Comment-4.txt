will the camera come with software so that if i bought two i could connect with my daughter, or will we have to use messenger, icq, yahoo etc.?
if so, which one of those should i use?
yes and most end up using either the supplied or one of the packages you listed.
i can't say why people choose one over the other.
on the mac they use what it comes with because &quot;it works.&quot; bob
