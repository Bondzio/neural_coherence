I recently upgraded my computer from ASUS Motherboard and Intel 1.8 to a new ASUS MOBO and Intel 2.8. now when i went into the device manager, it has exclamation marks next to: system timer, system speaker, Direct memory access controller, system CMOS/real time clock and numeric data processor.
I am running WIN ME, 512 DDR, and 64 bit video card.
can anyone tell me what all these exclamation marksmean and how to fix these?
I have gone into the BIOS but i dont see anything there that looks out of the ordinary.
please help.
if possible, you can email me at zena3546@aol.com.
Thank you.
