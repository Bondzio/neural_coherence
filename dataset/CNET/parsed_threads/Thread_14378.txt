<s> Does anyone have this monitor? </s>
<s> I just got it last week. </s>
<s> The user manual (and I use that term very lightly!) </s>
<s> says that it adjusts from -5 to +15. </s>
<s> I can't for the life of me figure out how to do it. </s>
<s> It doesn't tell you, just to be careful not to hurt your fingers. </s>
<s> I emailed Acer support three days ago and didn't get an answer. </s>
<s> It is hard to find contact info for their support--not a good sign. </s>
<s> Can anyone help? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Place your left hand on the bottom of the monitor and your right hand on the top of the monitor. </s>
<s> Holding onto the top and the bottom of the monitor. </s>
<s> While holding the base level, GENTLY push your left hand away and bring your right hand forward. </s>
<s> To tilt monitor backward bring left hand towards you and push right hand away. </s>
<s> One person held the base study while the other person move the screen. </s>
