1.1.1	I 've been reading these pages till my brain hurts .	St
1.1.2	There 's so much info here .	St
1.1.3	I bought a Maxtor Personal Storage 3200 , but when I opened it there was n't any instructions , installation disc , or anything come up on the screen when I plugged it into the laptop .	St
1.1.4	There 's also no buttons or switches on the HD case .	St
1.1.5	The 2 seemed to be talking to each other OK , so I tried to format & partition it into an 80/120/120G but it did n't do that , just stayed as 1 partition but with the name I 'd given the first partition .	St
1.1.6	The wizard seemed to be working OK so I figure there 's a lot more I do n't know about .	St
1.1.7	On this forum I found reference to a program Acronis Migrate Easy .	St
1.1.8	So my question is : - would the Acronis be the best way to go to manage the external HD right from the get go ?	Ques
1.1.9	I bought the HD with the intention of having a full backup , duplicate of my laptop , programs & all , which I would rebackup from time to time .	St
1.1.10	I also note some say to use CD 's but it would take 26 of them just to B-up my laptop , let alone have extra for my movies , music , etc ! ! ! !	St
1.1.11	That 's crazy !	St
1.1.12	Very important individual files , yes definately .	St
1.1.13	OK the laptop details .	St
1.1.14	OS XP Pro sp2 , pentium 2GHZ , 60G .	St
1.1.15	Um not sure what else you need to know here .	Res
1.1.16	Thanks ClissaT	St
1.2.1	1 .	St
1.2.2	Look up SYNCBACK and use it .	St
1.2.3	2 .	St
1.2.4	Acronis is nice .	St
1.2.5	Sorry there are no instructions but the full retail version is cheap and worth it .	St
1.2.6	3 .	St
1.2.7	And most important .	St
1.2.8	This is not backup .	St
1.2.9	It 's an convenient copy .	St
1.2.10	To reach the point of BACKUP we need one more copy that is WRITE PROTECTED .	St
1.2.11	These are not my rules on what backup is but those handed down over the years and accepted by many the world over .	St
1.2.12	If you feel one copy of your files ( that 's one copy regardless how many times you put it on this drive ! )	St
1.2.13	is all you need then I implore you to read this forum where people plead for help getting their files off such a device .	St
1.2.14	Where 's the backup ?	Ques
1.2.15	Bob	St
1.3.1	external ?	Ques
1.3.2	Through 'Disk Management ' ?	Ques
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	I 'll look up SYNCBACK .	St
1.5.2	I understand the final backup should be 'once only use ' CD 's .	St
1.5.3	Mainly I would like a copy of this computer because I ca n't remember all the programs & 100 's of hours of updates to goodness knows what that just happen of their own volitition .	St
1.5.4	I would n't know where to start to discribe what 's on this computer ( I 've totally lost track ! ) .	St
1.5.5	So figured a copy would at least give me a starting point should this machine go AWOL .	St
1.5.6	CT	St
1.6.1	to coincide with your proposed strategy .	St
1.6.2	Like you , I want to back it all up and restore it all in as little time as possible if the primary drive should become corrupt beyond repair or fail .	St
1.6.3	I do n't want to spend time finding all the CDs , the product keys , reloading the OS , the MB and periperhal drivers , all the application software , set all the defaults etc. , etc. , .	St
1.6.4	Makes me tired even thinkin ' about it .	St
1.6.5	I create compressed , restorable images of my drive C ( OS and APPs ) and D ( ALL DATA ) to a second internal HDD .	St
1.6.6	I also put copies of those images on an external HDD as well .	St
1.6.7	It has really really served my well .	St
1.6.8	VAPCMD	St
1.7.1	Thanks VAPCMD , now it 's all making sense .	St
1.7.2	I often find the HELP menu does n't give all the info required .	St
1.7.3	It did n't say the active window of the installed external harddrive had to show unallocated space before partitions could be made .	St
1.7.4	There was no mention of deleting partitions to make it all unallocated .	St
1.7.5	There was no mention of the words 'unallocated space ' .	St
1.7.6	To my mind that was the most important piece of info that should 've been in the HELP menu ! !	St
1.7.7	Of course it would also help if the device came with a few instructions of it 's own !	St
1.7.8	I 'm finding more & more that device makers assume buyers know about everything these days .	St
1.7.9	Anyway all done now & I have a copy of the computer to put away just incase .	St
1.7.10	Thanks everyone for your help here .	St
1.8.1	You have the right idea but do not use disks ; they involve a lot of swapping back & forth & if one gets a little scratch you wind up with a set of 'coasters ' .	St
1.8.2	Use the Maxtor +flash drive .	St
1.8.3	Your help on the Maxtor should be on the disk itself .	St
1.8.4	By opening it from 'my computer ' you will see them .	St
1.8.5	If not there you can download them from Maxtor/Seagate ( who brought Maxtor .	St
1.8.6	Good luck !	Polite
1.9.1	As a Storage/Backup Engineer for a large international company , we have a running joke .	St
1.9.2	No one cares whether you do backups .	St
1.9.3	All they care to see are successful restores .	St
1.9.4	Point is - unless you are doing something to ensure that whatever method you are using to backup/copy your data is & quot ; reversible & quot ; , i.e .	St
1.9.5	unless you are capable of getting that data back in a usable format , then all the backups in the world are of no value .	St
1.9.6	So do n't just backup - perform test restores of that data on a regular basis .	St
1.10.1	Hi , I did the same thing as you .	St
1.10.2	I bought an external hard disc and I 'd like to have everything I have on my laptop on the extra disc in case this computer goes belly-up .	St
1.10.3	What did you find worked for you ?	Ques
1.10.4	Do you have to partition drives ?	Ques
1.10.5	Is there a reason people partition drives ?	Ques
1.10.6	I 'd appreciate your advice since you just went through it .	Polite
1.10.7	I guess it 's technically a backup in the cmoputer world , but it 's a fall-back position for me .	St
1.10.8	Thanks !	St
1.10.9	Mary	St
