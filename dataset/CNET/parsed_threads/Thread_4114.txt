<s> Hi, I have a HP Pavilion Elite m9170 PC with Vista, and for the past month or so, it shuts down by itself and restarts when you are doing your thing on the computer. </s>
<s> It has just passed the one year warranty that I had with HP, and have extended warranty (2 years, which just started) with the store that I brought it. </s>
<s> I called HP and they said they will charge me $46 to help me, because as far as they are concerned their warranty is up. </s>
<s> So I called the people at the store where we brought it and the computer tech said if I have limewire on my computer I have virus'. </s>
<s> I said thats impossible because once a week I scan with Ad aware, Avast and Malwarebytes, I also have Comodo Firewall and I have no virus' except the occasional cookie, which I delete. </s>
<s> He told me to back up everything and shut the computer, and start it up again and press F11 and select restore. </s>
<s> This will restore the windows. </s>
<s> He also said that if there is a virus on the computer they will charge me. </s>
<s> But if there is a virus won't it show up when I'm doing my weekly scans? </s>
<s> So I then called the people who I have extended warranty with and they said they wanna take my computer away for testing. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any idea why my computer shuts off and restarts by itself? </s>
<s> No its not a virus as I did my weekly scans are all clean and virus free. </s>
<s> Thank you, Audrey Charlize </s>
<s> Given the limewire I have to agree with that diagnosis. </s>
<s> And since it's out of warranty there is no free support or repair. </s>
<s> Here's one idea. </s>
<s> Are you doing your yearly cleaning? </s>
<s> Watch this -&gt; http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-11319_7-6240575-1.html Today's pests change quickly to avoid detection so we're never sure that we can scan for them. </s>

<s> The way most AV detection works is finding &quot;known&quot; malware strings. </s>
<s> Basically, it tries very hard, but if you don't have the latest AV update plus an AV pgm. </s>
<s> that's really a good one, some malware can slip by. </s>
<s> While limewire is a known source for malware which is why the tech mentioned it. </s>
<s> If it isn't a h/w issue but a virus one, then yes you pay for that service. </s>
<s> You contend since you check regularly it not an issue, well often enough, malware does get through. </s>
<s> I suggest you re-install(delete current) Avast AV pgm.. </s>
<s> Install it and when it asks to reboot, allow it the boot level scan to complete the install. </s>
<s> Then update it, and re-run the scan again(this is not the same scan). </s>
<s> You now have a more intense scanning, before possibility any malware can act. </s>
<s> If results show bad, you have to act. </s>
<s> If not, then you can think repair shop, etc. </s>
<s> thinking its not a malware issue. </s>
<s> No telling what maybe found but at least you tried. </s>
<s> Of course you should clean well the system case of dust bunnies as heat build-up is a frequent source of system reboots. </s>
<s> You can try that 1st and then the Avast re-install. </s>
<s> I like to part that basically what you have been told from HP and vendors is pretty much typical. </s>

<s> Hi Audrey.. You may have noticed I locked the thread you created at the &quot;Audio & Video Software Forum&quot;. </s>
<s> I noted, it's in your best interest, as well as those helping you, to only post at one forum. </s>
<s> In addition to the above thread, you also posted the same thing at the Vista Forum and Spyware, Viruses & Security Forum . </s>
<s> Please follow-up on one thread only. </s>
<s> Again, I thank you for your cooperation.. Carol </s>
