when i worked for a law firm the summer of my 2nd year of law school (1981) the firm had a wang room.
climate controlled; you had to put things to be typed through a little window.
they let me do part of my law review article on it.
(i'd started with the law schools trs-80).
you had to climb up onto a little platform with a special seat.
my very first computer was a nameless little thing that had a cassette tape drive and used the tv as a screen.
in 1985 we got a ibm, whichever model was before the at.
i too learned basic and told my young son that if he ever typed &quot;format&quot; lightning would strike him dead.
but my very first computer experience, indirectly, was in 1967 while my then husband was in grad school.
he typed his programs (in fortan, i think) onto little punch cards and submitted them to what i faultily recall as robed priests at the stanford computer center.
i used to go over with him in the middle of the night; there was a priestless reader available where you could run your punch cards through and it would print out whatever was on them.
so i would type out letters home on punchcards and then print them.
so cool to send letters on wide lined computer paper.
