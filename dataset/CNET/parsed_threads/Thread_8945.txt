<s> I have a wireless network using this D-Link router (which includes a print server) and a DSL modem, and I find I have to reboot the router every half hour or so to recover the Internet connection. </s>
<s> The symptoms are everything will work fine, and then suddenly Internet addresses cannot be translated (suggesting that a DNS cannot be located). </s>
<s> The router IP address is defined as the DNS, and when this problem occurs, it is also impossible to ping the router IP. </s>
<s> However, the wireless network is working, and other wireless PCs using the network can still be seen. </s>
<s> The print server also fails at he same time (this works by printing to the same inaccessible IP address). </s>
<s> To solve the problem, simply unplug the router for 5 seconds, then reconnect, and the Internet and print server are back within seconds. </s>
<s> It makes a mockery of the convenience of wireless though. </s>
<s> I have the latest firmware in the Router, and the three wireless PCs are running XP SP2, using either D-Link (b)adapter or internal Centrino wireless. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I'm using this model too and very happy with it. </s>
