hi, i can't seem to access the net when transferring large files between my desktop (winxp sp3, 100mbps net card) and my laptop (win7, 54mbps wifi).
i have an edimax br-6228nc 150 mbps broadband router to which my desktop is wired and the laptop connects through wifi.
the speeds never go above 2.5mbps, so there should be plenty of bandwidth left for internet use.
my router config confirms that there's no internet connection while transferring the files.
can anyone please help me with this?
thanks
