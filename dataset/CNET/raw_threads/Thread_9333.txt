I've been in such an office and they learned the hard way that you use a pre-press print of your work on the common inkjet then done to the print shop for the high volume high quality prints. Your post leads me to believe you haven't learned or done this yet. Bob

The office lessons are something I can share but it appears that folk insist on repeating the lesson. If you want to try getting your own printer, why not head to the store and look at print samples?

They have the material, we do the marketing project and we can save up money and gain benefits. I apologize for my rough english, I'm a french-canadian haha. I really appreciate your help. It helps me to ask the right question. Thank you

I lived in Vancouver BC for many years and that was another office where we would do on screen pre-press work then a test print off the current ink jets of the day then off to the print shop for a print that we would check before the final run. Today there are many good shops and it pays to read as much as you can about prepress work. Here's a tutorial that's less than a sip from the firehose. -&gt; http://vector.tutsplus.com/articles/printing-prepress-basics/
