I purchased an eMachine T2615 from BEST BUY about 18 months ago and it works beautifully.
I believe the seller is a reputable company and sells only quality merchandise.
Like with all purchases, if a rebate is offered be sure to send the information by registered mail.
My experience has been that sometimes the information is &quot;not received&quot; by the rebater.
