We are planing on buying a new computer capable of converting video tapes to DVDs.
We like the looks of Sony RS530G but can't find much infomation on how good Sony is on reliabliability and service.
How does this computer compare to HP and Dell computers?
In checking in Comsumer Reports we found very little information about Sony.
Have always thought Sony was the top of the line in their products and just wondered why we weren't seeing the infomation about their computers.
Your help in this infomation would be greatly appreciated.
