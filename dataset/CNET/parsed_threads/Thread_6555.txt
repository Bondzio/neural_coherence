<s> I have 3 Macs connected wirelessly to an Airport Express. </s>
<s> In the past few days the wireless signal to all 3 Macs has dropped twice. </s>
<s> In other words, although there was a steady green light on the Airport Express, there was no signal indicated on any of the Macs. </s>
<s> After power cycling the Airport Express & restarting the Macs, the signal was re-established. </s>
<s> Please excuse the lengthy explanation, but I am trying to see if I am on the right path to resolving this. </s>
<s> A tech at my broadband ISP confirmed that there was no problem with either the incoming internet line nor my cable modem. </s>
<s> So the problem seems to likely reside downstream from the cable modem to the Airport Express. </s>
<s> I have a VOIP phone device connected between the cable modem & the Airport Express via ethernet cable. </s>
<s> However, I have been advised by a knowledgeable person that even if the VOIP device was faulty, the Airport Express should nevertheless still transmit a wireless signal (of course there would be no internet connection). </s>
<s> If this is true, it would suggest that the problem stems from the Airport Express itself. </s>
<s> Is this reasoning make sense? </s>
<s> Thank you for your patience & any help. </s>
<s> We are dealing with wifi which can be interfered with by external sources. </s>
<s> To expect it to never drop means that the discussion about what wifi is needs to start. </s>
<s> And, I can't find your router settings. </s>
<s> Please try the forum suggestions. </s>

<s> I am simply trying to validate the following suggestion: Since an Airport Express transmits a wireless signal, regardless of whether the VOIP device or any other device upstream in the chain is faulty, the Airport Express will continue to transmit. </s>
<s> Of course if there is an interruption in the incoming internet pathway, the transmitted Airport Express signal will not allow the computer to connect to the internet. </s>
<s> If this is reasonable, it would suggest that since my computers are sporatically not receiving a wifi signal at all, the problem would reside in the Airport Express itself. </s>
<s> Bob, you mentioned trying the forum suggestions. </s>
<s> Could you please point me in that direction? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> Is in the top posts called stickies in this forum. </s>
<s> I think you have a good handle on the problem. </s>
<s> If you can't connect to the wifi router (this one is an airport) with any machine then it's the airport with some 98% certainty. </s>
<s> I take out my spare router for the final test as sometimes you find the owner has repeated the same mistake on all machines (too many to list here.) </s>
<s> The old HIDE THE SSID issue is coming back to haunt owners again. </s>
<s> This old advice is making my friends lots of money as they make house calls to unhide the SSID. </s>
<s> Sometimes you wonder if there is a reason for the bad security advice. </s>
