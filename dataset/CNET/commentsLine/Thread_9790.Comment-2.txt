it seems to have existed indeed, because it's mentioned by  however,  (the standard site for looking for memory) has never heard of 'media magic'.
a search for pn315 only turns up very standard looking pc 133 128 and 256 mb sdram and that doesn't look right at all.
i think the chances of finding this memory are rather small.
moreover, do you have any information on the maximum amount of ram supported?
it might be 8 or 16, which still isn't much.
the interesting question: what's the os on this machine, and what would you want to do with it once you put in more memory?
