hey paul, thanks for your reply.
well let's see i have called emachines live chat who stated that emachines have trouble with just the pny 7600gs at the same time tried to sell me other stuff.
so if you need a direct line to sales just use the live chat and there is no waiting.
i talked to pny did not have a clue except to add more power(???)
wtf.
i bought the card at a fair price $124.00 + tax.
since last week the price has risen to above $180.00 at best buy.
so now i'm back to square one.
fry's is about 20 miles from the house so now i'm looking at the evga 7900 gt ko for $299.00 + tax.
by the time i get done it would have been easier to build my own.
i checked the bios at start up and the cpu temp was 50c/122f the system was at 44c/111f the graphics card was at 73c-76c i have a emachines t6524 and have added an xtra gig of ram and am currently trying to find a graphics card that will work.
thanks again for your input
