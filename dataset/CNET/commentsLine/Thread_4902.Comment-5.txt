thank you for your replies, but i'm starting to see the error message now even when i boot up using only the seagate drive.
the drive still boots into windows properly, though.
i bought a wd sata 250 gb drive today and can't get my system to boot when the sata drive is connected.
my system sees the new disk, but won't boot up with my the ide drive.
i'm beginning to think i've got a mb problem.
i don't know enough about sata drives to know what i'm doing, but the manual doesn't help.
it indicates that with both drives connected, i should be able to boot off their cd.
but i can't boot from the cd or the diskette the cd made.
it's going to be one of those weeks.
if anyone has any suggestions, i'll check back.
thanks, again.
