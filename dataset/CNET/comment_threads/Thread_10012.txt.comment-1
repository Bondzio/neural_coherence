Hi, guys.
I'm looking for a device that strengthens the wireless signals in the surrounding areas.
I would like for my laptop to get stronger wifi signals from computers in the surrounding area.
I've heard that this device is known as a wireless booster or hub?
If not, please let me know what its called, and if possible, the best brand.
