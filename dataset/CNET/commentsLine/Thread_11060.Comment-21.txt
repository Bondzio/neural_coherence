i like windows 7 a lot!
but i'm disappointed with canon, who chose to abandon their old color laser installed base by not providing 64-bit drivers.
my lbp5000 still has more than 50% of its original toner, but i now need to copy files over to an old notebook if i want to print to it.
a software casualty of the move to 64-bit computing was my wife's beloved printmaster - the replacement of which by an incompatible name-alike has left many loyal long-time users without a home dtp option - especially when microsoft's office home and student edition doesn't include publisher.
