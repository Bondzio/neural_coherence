<s> A friend of mine asked me to try to remove a partition from his hard drive. </s>
<s> It's an older computer and was set up with two 2gig partitions on a 4 gig hard drive. </s>
<s> But I think I made the serious mistake of searching google for deleting a partition instead of combining one. </s>
<s> Anyways, I followed a page like this http://www.cybertechhelp.com/html/tutorials/tutorial.php/id/36 and removed the partition, and now I only have the C: drive and it seems like I've essentially lost the other 2 gigs. </s>
<s> Is there anything I can do to either get these 2 gigs back onto the c: drive or restore the 2 gig d: drive. </s>
<s> I've tried a few free partition programs such as Partition Resizer but these don't even seem to detect that there are 2 gigs on the hard disk doing nothing. </s>
<s> Any advice appreciated. </s>
<s> http://www.partition-recovery.com/ Frankly, if you don't backup data, then you are revealing how important the data is. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Right. </s>
<s> The data was of no importance to me at all. </s>
<s> I just wanted to get the 2 gigs back onto the c: drive. </s>
<s> Couldn't get it to work with partition recovery but partition magic did it. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
