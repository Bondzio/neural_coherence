It may be slightly more costly, but the easiest way to boost the signal so that you totally eliminate the problem is just to get a range extender.
It picks up the signal, boosts it and re-broadcasts it.
Put that in your bedroom, then you can roam anywhere in your house on the stronger signal no matter what laptop or PC you are using.
You can get these as didicated devices, or some Wireless Access Points or Wireless Routers have an option to work just as a range extender.
Sometimes you can get some pretty good deals on them too.
Hope that helps!
