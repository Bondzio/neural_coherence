I recently changed to Charter from ATT DSL.
The modem that they provided (rental) is Motorola Surfboard SB5101N.
Is this modem the best option if I decide to buy rather than rent?
Also what router should I need to optimize the service?
No gaming or other uses, just internet connection for laptop, iPad & iPhone.
