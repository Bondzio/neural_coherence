it is a mechanical device, and mechanical devices wear out by their very nature - bearings wear out, motors die.
i look at external drives as almost disposable nowadays.
i had a wd 300gb mybook croak after 1 year + 2 weeks, just out of warranty.
now, i use a combination of dvds and an external 500gb maxtor drive.
i'll probably move the data from the maxtor to a new external drive in 2 years or so, before it dies with all my data.
