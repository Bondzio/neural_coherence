My computer currently has two hard drives; 8MB (master) & 2MB (slave).
I removed the 2MB drive and tried to install a new 13.6MB drive.
I plugged the IDE cable labeled &quot;slave&quot; and the power cable into my new hard drive, and when I turned on my computer it failed to boot.
It says it cannot detect a master drive.
What happened?
I never even touched the master hard drive!
P.S.
I'm running Windows XP.
