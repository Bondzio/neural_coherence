your ram choice is fine as long it supports ddr2-533, but you need to determine what your current ram is running at.
( cpu-z can figure it out for you.)
the dell comes with ddr2-400 or ddr2-533, not ddr2-433 (which doesn't exist).
personally, if you're running ddr2-400, i'd dump the existing ram and use all ddr2-533.
as for the graphics card, what do you plan to use the pc for?
the 7600gs is an entry-level 3d card, can play some games, and will work fine with your 300w power supply.
this evga 7600gs is a better buy at $85 before $20 rebate.
if you don't plan on playing an games and don't like rebates, this evga 7300gt is $66 straight up.
