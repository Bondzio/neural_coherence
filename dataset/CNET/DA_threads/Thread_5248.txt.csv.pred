1.2.1	Reading and looking at http : //www.amazon.com/FSP460-60GLC-Bestec-ATX-250-12Z-Supply-Replacement/dp/B001AO0MT4 tells me that this is a common ATX power supply .	St
1.2.2	That is , there are some thousand models that can replace this .	St
1.2.3	Here 's one for the herd .	St

1.3.1	You want to look at the physical size and specs for Bestec model # .	St
1.3.2	Once you have that in hand , you compare to any similar or direct replacement PSU .	St
1.3.3	So be 100 % sure the model # is what is stated on the decal/sticker located on the PSU .	St
1.3.4	Then do your search .	St
1.3.5	If as Robert states is correct , you maybe lucky and have a common ATX-12V type sized PSU , which many are generic to your needs .	St
1.3.6	BTW , having more wattage and/or connections wo n't hurt .	St

1.5.1	Thanks for that .	St
1.5.2	After all the PSU 's I 've replaced over the years , one of the best pieces of advice I found was to get a single rail when possible .	St

1.6.1	Granddaughter 's PC fails .	St
1.6.2	It 's got an inexpensive PSU in it now and this one at $ 45 net will be worthwhile to have as a spare or a substitute if I decide to upgrade the system .	St
