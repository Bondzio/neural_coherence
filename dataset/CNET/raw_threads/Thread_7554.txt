Some want to connect to both wifi connections at the same time and hope this is possible to speed up downloads. Sadly this would take not only a second chunk of hardware for the wifi client but an OS that could BOND the two channels. This is not a trick for Windows today. Bob

Since all I have to work with is your words and I don't see a plan of the network I'll pick your words as follows. &quot;everything is wired now if there are two wifi networks can i connect them as a single network by any hardware?&quot; Let's disict this. If so we have a LAN (that's the wired part) and on 2 locations we have a WAP. Ipso facto these WAPs on on the same LAN and as such don't need any additional hardware. Bob

Sorry but this is not something I can tell you a step by step since your posts are so light in the details needed. And since this is all volunteer I won't conduct a long interview where you could just craft a complete post. Bob
