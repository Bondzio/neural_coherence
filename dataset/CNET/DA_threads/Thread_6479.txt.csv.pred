1.1.1	Hi and I would really appreciate your help on this I have a notebook connected to the internet through wired lan and I want to share this over the wireless lan to another notebook .	St
1.1.2	Both notebooks have XP home SP2 .	St
1.1.3	The Host computer has the following : Wired lan ( has ICS setting ) IP : 10.0.15 .	St
1.1.4	*** Subnet Mask : 255.255.254.0 Gateway : 10.0.15.254 Wireless SSID ( *** ) has been set to ad hoc with automatic IP and dns etc but shows as not connected Client setting Shows as connected to the SSID ( *** ) with IP : 169.254.240.179 Subnet Mask : 255.255.0.0 Gateway : 169.254.240.179 Now I do n't know much but I definitely know that I should n't have the gateway as same as the clients IP and I 'm thinking that the host should show connection ... Any idea what I need to do ?	Ques
1.2.1	will the laptop connect to ?	Ques
1.2.2	Does the wired PC have a wireless card ?	Ques
1.2.3	If so , you simply bridge wired and wireless within that PC .	St
1.2.4	You make that PC an AP for the wireless laptop .	St
1.2.5	I do n't think I can sort out our ICS settings .	St
1.2.6	The gateway should definitely be the router 's IP in any case .	St
1.2.7	My old recollection of ICS was that the hosting PC needed 192.168.0.1 and the other addresses were to be within that range .	St
1.2.8	XP could have changed that but I 'm not sure .	St
1.2.9	In any event , your wireless laptop needs to connect to something and , if the PC has both a wired and wireless NIC , the easy way is to bridge these and connect the laptop to that bridge .	St
1.2.10	Hope this helps .	St
1.3.1	The host laptop is connected to a hub used by the whole apt building ...	St
1.3.2	I just ca n't figure out why the host laptop wo n't show the connection whereas the client laptop will .	St
1.3.3	I 've tried bridging the connection but XP wo n't let me as the host laptop 's wireless connection is not connected apparently ...	St
1.4.1	But if you must try it , firewalls , protection software must be set by you to allow all this and you can see if this article helps - & gt ; http : //www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/networking/expert/bowman_02april08.mspx I will not write at length here since ICS is now consider a tarpit .	St
1.4.2	Not many escape so I do n't go there anymore .	St
1.5.1	Thanks.. Actually , the article you are suggesting was the first thing I found when trying this ... and hence I have done exactly as the article that you have pointed to ... Perhaps its easier that I give up ? ?	Ques
1.5.2	?	Ques
