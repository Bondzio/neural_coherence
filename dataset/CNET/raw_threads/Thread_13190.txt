First is the un compatibility problem with various dvd players/recorders. A home made dvd will not play on all dvd players. Either will a dvd burned on a stand alone dvd recorder play on all makes and models of dvd players. It's a compatibility nightmare! Second is the delicate nature of the medium itself. The outside layer is very prone to scratches and nicks. One little scuff mark can render the medium completely unusable. One literally must handle this medium with silk gloves and with more care than a vinyl LP record. Third is the big question of longevity of the data on the disk itself, we all must admit that the jury is still out on this. In the meantime we have heard various reports of a few years to 100 years. Now we hear of cautions that this medium must be sheltered away from extreme light and in an environment of controlled humidity and temperature. I advise my customers who request that their vhs, slides, or 8mm movies be transferred to DVD for preservation - that this is not the solution. Yes, I will transfer to dvd only on their request and that they sign a release that the work is not guaranteed on a dvd format. I've experienced that 30% or more of my customers have numerous problems with playing their dvd on their home machines. I had one customer steaming mad, a dvd of her family home movies, it played great on her home machine. But when she tried to play this same dvd at her daughters home (1500 miles away) the dvd played with sputs and spurts and then stopped only 2 minutes into the program. You can imagine the disappointment! Boy did I get an earful when she called me on the phone. From this and many more bad experiences I have lost many future customers and all faith in the CD/DVD medium we have today. Roger Simister SimMedia , New Harmony, Utah

Also, do you remember the format war of DVD-R and DVD+R? And finally did you notice that some players list neither, one or the other or both? In closing I note the + or - on the media and include a note that the player's media compatibility list must be checked. I've had no issues that you speak of and since I put them in boxes or sleeves the scratches issues have been neglible. Then again I pick them up from the edges as noted in the care and handling guides. As to extreme light, this issue applies to vinyl LP, VHS tape and more so nothing new here. Bob
