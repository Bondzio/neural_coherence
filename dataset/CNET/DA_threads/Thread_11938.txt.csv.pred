1.1.1	HELLO , Recently I upgraded the RAM to 2GB .	St
1.1.2	I have Intel Mother B. model : D102GGC2 .	St
1.1.3	I 'm using WIN XP HOME SP2 .	St
1.1.4	When I changed the RAM to the new one , the windows immediately recognized it and at the control panel/system its shows OK .	St
1.1.5	But , when I 'm using the computer like I did in the past , I do n't see any changes ( not with speed and not with functionality ) .	St
1.1.6	Do you have any suggestions for me ?	Ques
1.1.7	Please send and answer .	Sug
1.1.8	Thank you very much , & Regards , SARA	St
1.2.1	Adding RAM above 1 Gig will not always , if ever , result in a noticable increase in performance .	St
1.2.2	Unless you 're trying to decode the human genome .	St
1.2.3	Usually , it 's to improve bragging rights .	St
1.2.4	Not that you did of course , but Windows is really pretty good at allocating RAM and its use .	St
1.2.5	I have four machines with only one Gig of RAM .	St
1.2.6	Any more , in my case , is wasted .	St

1.3.1	As I run my normal stuff I watch the swap file .	St
1.3.2	If there is a lot of swapping going on then more ram might be of help .	St
1.3.3	If there is not much swapping going on then adding ram might be of limited value .	St
1.3.4	If you feel the machine is slow and there is not much swapping then the bottleneck is in some other area .	St

1.5.1	Thank you for your reply .	St
1.5.2	Before I had 512 RAM .	St

1.6.1	I was lucky a few years ago to have 2 identical machines right down to the same make/model of everything .	St
1.6.2	We had a DVD rendering job that took 6 HOURS .	St
1.6.3	The test runs were made and then the machine 's ram sticks were switched and the test rerun .	St
1.6.4	Both machines ran XP .	St
1.6.5	The machine with 1GB finished the 6 hour task ahead of the 512MB machine by 5 or 6 minutes .	St

1.7.1	applications you 're running and how you 're running them .	St
1.7.2	If you run one program at a time or programs that do n't need much RAM ... more RAM does n't make a noticeable difference .	St
1.7.3	Had you started with 256MBs RAM ... you would have seen a greater difference .	St
1.7.4	If you upgrade or switch to Vista ... .2GB RAM becomes the new user standard .	St
1.7.5	If you go to tomshardware.com , you should be able to find an article saying essentially the same .	St
1.7.6	I 'm sure there other similar articles or reviews .	St
1.7.7	Hope this clarifies .	St
1.7.8	VAPCMD	St
