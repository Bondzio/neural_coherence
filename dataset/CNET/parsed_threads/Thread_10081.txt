<s> I have a HP Pavilion pc (brought in 2005). </s>
<s> Well, the other day when I turned the pc on, the monitor picture shrink until it completing turned black. </s>
<s> It remindered me of the old tv when the picture tube was going out the picture would &quot;rolled&quot; until a thin line was in the middle, then black. </s>
<s> I can hear the pc (tower) humming, trying to work. </s>
<s> I turned off the pc, unplug and waited for about 1 hour. </s>
<s> Plugged everything back, turn it on, hear the &quot;tower&quot; working but still black monitor. </s>
<s> I tried to get into safe mode so I can do a system restore, but since no picture came up, couldn't do it. </s>
<s> So, before I purchase a whole new pc, monitor, etc. </s>
<s> I would like to know is it the monitor? </s>
<s> This has never happened to me. </s>
<s> And yes, the monitor is much older than the pc. </s>
<s> My operating system is WindowsXP, model # of Pavilion A1110N. </s>
<s> 512mb memory/160mb hard drive. </s>
<s> I do believe the monitor which is a Compaq FS940 was brought in 2002. </s>
<s> Well, it's either the monitor or the graphic card in the PC. </s>
<s> Try this monitor on another PC and another monitor on this PC and you'll know. </s>
