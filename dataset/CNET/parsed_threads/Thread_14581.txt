<s> Hello, I have a home network with router Linksys WRTU54G-TM. </s>
<s> I have moved my home-office upstairs and would like to use D-Link TM-G5240 as a wireless bridge that would connect 3 wired computers and 1 wired printer to the network. </s>
<s> I have tried configuring the TM-G5240 according to the owners manual, but the manual is decidedly thin on details. </s>
<s> The last thing I did was to give the D-Link TM-G5240 a static ip address on the home network (192.168. </s>
<s> 0.140), and to communicate on the same channel (6) to the home network SSID on the Linksys WRTU54G-TM ip address (192.168.0.1) using the correct wpa password. </s>
<s> When I try to renew the ip address of a wired computer I see activity on both the wireless and port lights on the TM-G5240. </s>
<s> The wired computer never gets a good ip address. </s>
<s> Instead it gets a 169.x.x.x address. </s>
<s> Please help </s>
<s> But it sounds defective. </s>
<s> Only the makers can fix that issue. </s>
<s> I've worked around this by manually assigning the IP, Netmask, Default Gateway and DNS entries but sounds defective to me and your choice to live with this. </s>

<s> The D-link is new out of the box. </s>
<s> I would still like to use it as a bridge. </s>
<s> Maybe someone else will have a different response. </s>
<s> I do have a couple of other wireless routers. </s>
<s> They might be better candidates for this experiment.. </s>
<s> Thanks for your input. </s>

<s> Remember I can't fix a maker's broken stuff. </s>
<s> New out of the box doesn't mean it's fully debugged and works with all other routers. </s>
<s> I noted a workaround but if you can't do that, and they fail to fix it with firmware or support, get your money back. </s>
