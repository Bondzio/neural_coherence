i have a gateway essential 550. i'm not sure the kind of motherboard i have (how do i find out), but if the bios version helps it's 4w4sboxo.15a.0017.p12.
i also heard that i can add or remove start up programs to help improve boot speed.
how do i get to the start up page through (run) to do that?
btw- thanks for your reply and help
