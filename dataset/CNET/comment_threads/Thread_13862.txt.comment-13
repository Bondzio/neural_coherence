Internet Explorer may be using too much space.
Try this: click on &quot;tools&quot; in Internet Explorer then click on &quot;internet Options&quot; then click on &quot;delete files&quot; after this click on &quot;settings&quot; and then reduce the space Explorer uses to 50MB this is the recomended size
