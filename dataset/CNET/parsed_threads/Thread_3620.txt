<s> So, I have 7 CDRWs. </s>
<s> I bought 2 of them a year or 2 ago, they are 650MB Imation CDRWs. </s>
<s> The other 5 I bought about 2 weeks ago, they are 700MB Memorex Ultra Speed CDRWs. </s>
<s> The imations burn at a maximum of 4x, the memorex are a max of 24x. </s>
<s> I have been trying to burn linux iso to the Memorex CDs. </s>
<s> I constantly keep getting read error. </s>
<s> I've tried different drives, different burn speeds, and different ISOs. </s>
<s> No matter what the Memorex won't burn right, or read right, Whatever's going on. </s>
<s> The Imation burn fine and I have no problems when booting and reading. </s>
<s> So why not just use the imation? </s>
<s> I only have 2 and they are 650MB, I need 700MB CDs and I don't want to waste CDRs on something I'll use once. </s>
<s> Know how to fix this? </s>
<s> By the way, I used Nero 6.6 (I think, its 6.something), Alcohol 120% lastest version, and CD Burner XP Pro, doesn't change the result. </s>
<s> At what point do you get the read error? </s>
<s> So far I don't see a problem here. </s>
<s> Use the proper size CDR for the task. </s>
<s> Cheers, Bob </s>
