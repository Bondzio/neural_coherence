I am wondering if anybody has heard anything about what I am trying to do here, or if you think it would even be possible.
My cell phone (Nokia 6010) has the normal handsfree jack (1/8&quot; slot), and I was thinking that since a handsfree accessory has the normal send and receive plugs that it might be possible to splice that into a RJ11 jack so I could use the cell phone for data via my modem.
I have unlimited minutes, but the data transfer costs money.
If I could use my cell phone just like I would a normal home phone line with a RJ11 input then I would in essance be cheating the system.
All the phone company would see would me be on a voice call.
From there I could either try and have the computer dail an ISP (probably not possible) or manually dial the phone and then connect that way.
Is this even possible?
Or am I going to blow up my phone in the process?
Thanks for your help and advice, Brandon
