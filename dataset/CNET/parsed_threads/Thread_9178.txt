<s> My Linksys 54gs is about 5 years old now and lately it has been shuting off during the night while Im downloading files. </s>
<s> I have already put an updated firmware on it and doesnt seem to help. </s>
<s> I do alot of gaming on XBOX LIVE (wired) and was thinking if there was a better router out there. </s>
<s> Thanx for the input </s>
<s> -&gt; Is it setup per the forum sticky? </s>
<s> We know that some routers fail with MAC filtering which is not prescribed in this forum's sticky post (it's at the top of this forum.) </s>

<s> Like I was saying, Ive had the router setup for almost 6 years without a hitch. </s>
<s> But recently it has been dropping connection at night and it seems signal not as strong. </s>
<s> Was just wondering how much of a &quot;shelf life&quot; these things got, and maybe try to upgrade </s>
<s> The question is still left open. </s>
<s> Since you didn't answer or supply the settings you may be spending where you could have avoided the outlay. </s>

<s> I dont have access to my routers settings at this time. </s>
<s> But Im sure it was set up properly since I have put many hours in research getting the proper settings for my specific router. </s>
<s> I guees my main question is.....Do routers tend to need replacing after a number of years? </s>
<s> ?....I know there have been upgrades since my last purchase and more or less leaning to a new router.. </s>
<s> But the settings do not work for years. </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> My best example is how folk used to set up WEP for protection. </s>
<s> That's now broken in less than 2 minutes and for a short time MAC filtering provided a stop gap security measure. </s>
<s> These are now out dated so your settings can be outdated with some kid next door interfering with your system. </s>
<s> Go ahead and buy your new router but it seems a shame we can't update to today's advised settings first to see if we can avoid the replacement. </s>

<s> I have updated my router with new firmware but not sure what your talking about &quot;setup&quot;. </s>
<s> You mentioned about a sticky in this forum but have looked at stickys here and didnt see anything that would help me. </s>
<s> If Im over looking it please point me in the direction. </s>
<s> Im eager to learn...Thanx again </s>
<s> http://forums.cnet.com/networking-and-wireless-forum/?tag=forum-w;forums06 At the top there are now 4 posts stuck to the top. </s>
<s> The 2 locked ones are the more informational ones with the longer one that can be summed up as router firmware, router defaults, simple SSID broadcasting and then WPA for security. </s>
<s> These settings are hard won information from many setups in the field over the years. </s>
<s> We start with that to see if we can avoid the usual issues and repeating past mistakes. </s>
