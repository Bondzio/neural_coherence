Hi, I need your help...
I have a SATA raid card from sunix.
I made (2008!)
a RAID1.
But today I accidentally delete the RAID1 from the card's BIOS utillity configuration!!!
The PC does not boot!!!!!!!!!
HELP.
I have all my data inside the disks...
I made new raid 1 configuration but nothing.
It shows that RAID1 is GOOD and after that nothing...
