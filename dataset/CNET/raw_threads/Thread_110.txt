Can you reduce the magnitude of your question? For instance some wanted to run the full Microsoft Office on a PDA. The answer is no. Where to get information? Why not the maker of that Windows Mobile OS or device? If they don't answer they are saying &quot;Go away.&quot; Bob

It is not Windows Vista or even close to it. It's &quot;Windows&quot; in name and does not run any of your common desktop Windows applications. -&gt; I'd love to get you an answer but your question is still too big to answer in this small space. Can you ask the ONE THING you need to know? Bob

Proffitt	4/25/09 10:36 AM	1.24065576E12	The answer has to be &quot;everything.&quot;	Until you reduce the size of the question the answer has to be &quot;everything.&quot; There is not much in common from WinMo 5 and up to Windows XP/Vista. I am in the know here but as presented the answer will have to be &quot;everything.&quot; Bob

The list goes on far too long to list here. -&gt; What's the goal here? If it's just for study then hit google and the microsoft sites and keep reading. I can't fit all the differs into this small space. Bob
