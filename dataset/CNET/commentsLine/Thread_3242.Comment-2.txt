16gb, no extra programs...at least not that i recall.
if it had any, i simply deleted them.
in any case, why not simply delete the programs on your flash if you don't want to use them?
last year i bought one of those cruze micro flash drives with the u3 software.
simply reformatted it to wipe out the us software which was a waste of time.
all flash drives can be reformatted to be &quot;plain jane.&quot;
