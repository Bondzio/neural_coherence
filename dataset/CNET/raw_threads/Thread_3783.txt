It has since been removed, but I can't seem to delete it from my computer. It has one pending print job that can't be deleted. Additionally, whenever I change the default printer, it will soon revert back to the HP PSC 1300. Also, it whenever I restart the computer, add any other printer, turn any printer on, or insert a cd or flash drive, the printer reinstalls on the computer. I've done multiple virus and spyware scans, so that shouldn't be the issue. I would guess if I could delete the print job, then I could delete the printer, and the problem would cease. However, I can't seem to do that. Any suggestions?
