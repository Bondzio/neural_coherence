I have just swapped out my mobo for a foxconn NF4K8AC with Athlon64 3000+ cpu and geforce 6600GT 128MB PCI-E graphics card.
The graphics card, cpu and mainboard fans spin up as do the CD/DVD drives and harddrive but the system simply emits a series of single prolonged beeps .
I have swapped out the RAM in all the various slot combinations and bought a nice 500W Ultra X-Connect PSU but to no avail.
Should I buy new RAM as my current PC2100 RAM is supposed to be compatible according to the manual but it touts itself as a DDR 400 compatible board or should I get my machine checked over by an (expensive) professional ?
Any advice would be much appreciated.
Regards, gor41.
