Cat6 has double the bandwidth of cat5 which boils down to a little more reliability. You can use either cables with your computer. I would recommend cat6 as applications are getting larger and the added bandwidth of a cat6 will accommedate better. Some good quality cheap cables can be found at www.tendonusa.com. Good luck.

If you are needing something for short runs, like just a few feet, then either cable will work fine, but if you are needing something that is going to go further, or near high radio-noise inducing areas, like near actual transmitting radios, or power lines, then if you have 1Gb (Gigabit) devices (on both ends) minimize the possible noise conflict and get Cat6 cables.

There is no shielding with UTP, or &quot;unshielded twisted pair&quot; Ethernet cables and STP or &quot;shielded twisted pair&quot; is rarely ever used. For commercial applications, Cat.6 which is capable of speeds up to 10 Gig, is installed to accomodate future equipment upgrades and technology advances. For the small office/home office user, Cat.5 UTP's rating of 100Mbps is sufficient at a more attractive price.

Yes, I know that the one idea of shielding, where it is grounded, does not actually apply to the 8 wires, 4 twisted pairs of wires, in the Ethernet wiring called Cat5, Cat5e or even Cat6. But there is a sheath, and it is generally constructed of aluminum foil, that is what some people call shielding. You even said &quot;'shielded twisted pair' is rarely ever used&quot; Rarely? so then it does happen? If you look up, on Wikipedia (granted, a collection of many people's input, but that is what makes it knowledge more well rounded, and not just one persons opinion) you'll read that &quot;Many such cables are unshielded but some are shielded .&quot; The person who started this thread just wanted to know the what the difference between CAT5 and CAT6 cables are, since they look the same. I think I answered the question well enough to show swarm567 that the appearance is the same. It is unlikely he'll ever construct any of the cables himself. I even recommended that, depending upon the circumstance (and I gave examples), the Cat5 cable will probably work fine for him. As for saying Ethernet cable is not shielded, is wrong. You are thinking only twisted pair. The original Ethernet cable, as designed by Xerox (where I was employed from 1970 to 2004) was not only shielded, but it was double-shielded. It was very thick (some called it &quot;thicknet&quot;), about a half inch, co-ax cable; and required special tapping devices to get past the double shield (some people called them &quot;vampire taps&quot;) to connect the transceiver boxes (I am so glad nobody uses that stuff anymore - except maybe masochists ). I'm sorry for using a word that you felt the need to correct me. Perhaps what you added was useful for swarm567 , but I don't think so.
