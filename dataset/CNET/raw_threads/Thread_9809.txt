I've watched tutorials on how to build a PC and done some research on hardware and this is the build I came up with. I'd appreciate some feedback before I spend $900. I want to be able to play games like Skyrim on at least high settings with a ton of mods. This may not quite pull that off due to budget issues (or will it?). Could you rate my build 1-10 for how well it should work for that? Motherboard CPU GPU HDD RAM DVD PSU Case OS $861 + shipping. How does this look? Am I missing anything (besides monitor/mouse/keyboard)?

If I can't find what's on the list, I go to Crucial dot com to see if they have the RAM known to be compatible with the board I have.

I'm fairly certain the CPU won't overclock so that won't be an issue. I don't game but I do have extra hard drives and use the 10k RPM type. As well, I went with a passive cooled video card as those with fans can be noisier and need more in the way of maintenance. Such are of my reasons for adding fans to the front panel. It's up to you but gaming adds a different dimension. You're video card will toss hot air into the case and that hot air needs to be removed. You can try it without extra fans and see how it works. My two extra fans cost about 30 bucks for both.
