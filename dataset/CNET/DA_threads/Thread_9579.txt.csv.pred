1.2.1	If the machine is from one of the big computer makers, you should be able to track down the video card as well as updated drivers on their website.	St
1.2.2	Are you looking for drivers because you reinstalled the OS?	St
1.2.3	If so don't forget the motherboard drivers.	Sug
1.2.4	Hardware devices will not work properly with Windows drivers alone.	St
