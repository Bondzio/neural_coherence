The ATXV12 of the latest spec 2.01 or later is used by all CPUI's, However, there is a new kicker, which depends on the mobo, the normall connector PS to mobo was 20 Pins, now the newer mobos use 24 pins. Thus you should now what the mobo takes and then buy a power supply that has the correct connector. Most PS's with a 24 pin connector provide a 24 to 20 adapter cable with them. Re power rating of the supply go 450 watts or better, this is nad business on my part, you really should tell us what the system will have on it. It is possible that you might more than 450 watts to give the supply some operating margin.
