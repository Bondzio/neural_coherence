unfortunately to use cipher you need to have encryption installed on windows which means the pro series only.
for those who do not have it the best answer is to unplug the drive that they do not want to format or blank, as it is really easy to nuke the wrong drive.
i have pulled this doh!
homer simpson trick in the past years ago and nuked my os by mistake...but that was with windows 95 so it really wasn't a loss if they are formatting the drive that they have their os installed on then they will not be using windows unless they have a copy of windows.
unfortunately most people who buy computers nowadays do not even get a real copy of windows with their pc!
so using freeware or drive manufactures isos is the easiest way to learn how to deal with drives correctly.
one other suggestion for those who have windows without nero or whatever and might have a hard time correctly burning downloaded isos of linux or the drive manufactures isos of freedos with their drive utilities.
my answer is to always use iso recorder which is a great freeware utility that does not create cd or dvd coasters the way that windows 7 does with iso files.
it works on xp, vista and 7. it gives you a right click menu to burn iso directly to disk and does not screw up if something else requests hdd disk write access the way the native windows 7 iso burning software does.
before windows 7 the ability to burn iso to disk required add on software, after windows 7 the feature was added but somehow it always seems to screw up linux isos for some strange unknown reason..
