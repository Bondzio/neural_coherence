tip: if you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.
you supplied a very short list of what's in that machine.
such items as bad motherboard capacitors can be a factor as well as the usual overtaxed power supply that has finally begun to fail.
i'd test fit a 450 watt power supply and look for the bad capacitor issue as well as try the heat test.
remove the cover and point a fan at the machine.
if the problem subsides, then you either have a failing fan/heatsink or a heat sensitive component.
such heat sensitive components are often on a card or even a motherboard and are great fun to track down.
the end user is often upset that the motherboard or card is replaced.
