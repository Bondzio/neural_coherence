The mouses are not picked up at all. The keyboards are picked up, but not very well. They work fine in Windows, but they do not respond in the BIOS. It also takes multiple tries for the computer to pick up the pressing of the F1 key (for entry to the bios). This is not my own computer, this is a computer I'm working on for a friend, and I'm thoroughly stumped. At the moment, I've been dealing with using the numberpad to control the cursor, but I don't want my friend to have to deal with that for the rest of the life of this computer. It's fairly new, only bought within the past six months or so. Thanks in advance.

11076	2	204714	2190017	2189397	EclipseMage	9/9/06 5:25 PM	1.1578227E12	Yes indeed.	However, if sent away, I was told that they will do whatever they have to to fix it, without contacting us first either. Which means, all the data might be wiped, so we have to back everything up first. That's not something that's real fun without a mouse.

11076	4	204714	2190990	2190018	EclipseMage	9/10/06 9:37 AM	1.15788102E12	Yeah, I know	Now there is, but there wasn't. We've decided we are going to send it away, but I taught them how to back everything up so I didn't have to do it for them. No, we were looking for a way that would not require a backup first. It's very tedius backing up files without a mouse, if you haven't tried before.

11076	7	204714	2193106	2193066	R. Proffitt	9/11/06 3:12 PM	1.15798752E12	That's good news.	It sounds like you won't be losing your files today. &quot;Anyway you can help me explain that to someone who's only computer skills are turning it on, getting into the internet, and checking e-mail?&quot; In their case it looks like there is nothing to be saved.
