i work on my computer usally 12 to 17 hours or more each day.
currently i use a crt monitor that is about 3 years old.
i really would like to update and get something nicer, and newer, but really not sure what is going to work the best and cause the least amount of strain.
i plan to purchase my monitor when i build my computer with hp.
so, i was looking at the 19 inch vs19d i think that a 21 inch is a little more than i need.
i like this particluar model because of the size and i also prefer having my speakers attached.
is a flat panel monitor going to work good for me.
i know i have heard in the past that they aren't good for extended use and such.
is there something else i should be looking into?
any suggestions?
thanks!
