it has been suggested elsewhere that the mtbf is 8 years.
this means a 1 in 8 chance each year of a single drive failing.
but i had a samsung hdd in a dell fail after only 3 months.
i have other hdds which are many years old and still work just fine.
so you can never tell when an hdd is going to fail.
it could be in 5 minutes or five years time.
i always backup my backups!
