Hi!
I'm trying to build a different sub network using an adsl router/modem left from my old ISP.
(a Sagem F@st 2604 ) I first connected the old adsl router with my new ISP gateway (a Thomson TG784n) on the same net 192.168.1.0/24 with a ethernet cable (NOT cross-over) connecting numbered Ethernet ports, (DHCP and wi-fi off) and all went ok (1).
Now I'm trying to put my PC and the old sagem F@st 2604 on the 192.168.10.0/24 network , but I really don't know how to configure the different Ethernet ports in the sagem modem/router, I fear that I wont be able to configure the Sagem to behave as a switch(2).
(1) I don't know how this worked, but it did.
Can you give any light on this subject?
(2) Is it possible to configure the sagem F@st 2604 to behave as a switch?
