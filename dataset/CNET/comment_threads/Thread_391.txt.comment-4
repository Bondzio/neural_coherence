Sounds like I might as well stick with AMD.
How can I find out what motherboard I have, and is there somewhere I can look online to see what processors will work with my motherboard?
If there isn't an easy way, I'll just go to my local computer shop.
The Athlon X2 6000+ looks ok- little more than I wanted to spend, but I'll just save longer.
Thanks!
