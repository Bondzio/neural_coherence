May be I want too much...but I am confused about choosing an external hard drive.
The situation is this...I just received my new iMac.
I have a Dell XPS system running Vista Home Premium, 2 Dell laptops running Windows XP and I want to be able to get files from all three of these computers to my new iMac.
Then I want the drive to work with the iMac Time Machine.
Is this possible?
I am confused by reading the reviews and ratings.
