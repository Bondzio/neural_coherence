<s> I'm trying to get my new dvd burner to be the master drive. </s>
<s> First: Can anybody tell me how to figure out which drive is master and which slave? </s>
<s> In bios, it always jyst says a cd device boots up after c: . </s>
<s> (I have cdrw and dvdrw). </s>
<s> I can't tell if the 40pin ide cable's grey (middle) pin is the master or is the black (end) pin master? </s>
<s> I thought it was the grey, so I set the dvrw jumper to master, plugged it into the grey pin (middle) of ide cable and started the computer. </s>
<s> I think the cable is the 40(line/pin) type. </s>
<s> I can't tell how to tell if it is regular or the 'y' shaped kind of cable.Either way I plug in, black or grey pins , the cdrw drive blinks first (by like a tenth of a second though), the cdrw jumper is on slave, the dvdrw on master. </s>
<s> ((I also have an I think 80?pin? </s>
<s> ide cable, it has a blue connector as well, I could try that one?)) </s>
<s> But again which pin is which master/slave? </s>
<s> And in computer properties it does'nt tell you which drive is the first boot?! </s>
<s> Please help. </s>

<s> 80 conductor cables just assign M/S by placement and you set all drives to CS or cable select. </s>
<s> No mystery, but you just be able to tell the difference on the cable. </s>
<s> Since you have BLUE, BLACK and GREY connectors, we'll call it an 80 CONDUCTOR cable. </s>
<s> ALL the drives on such a cable will be jumpered to CS. </s>
<s> In closing, you don't want to know that I still find NEW CDRW drives that won't play with other drives until I update the CDRW drive FIRMWARE. </s>
<s> This is asking far too much of consumers, but once I mention it, then most will go &quot;aha!&quot; and fix it. </s>
