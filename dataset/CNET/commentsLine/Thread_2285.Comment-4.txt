thanks for your advice.
i went to sam's club and bought a onetouch 9220 visioneer and it is working wonderfully.
i stuck with visioneer because i like the paperport 8 software.
the scanner is 4800 x 2400 and it only cost $80.
it was worth the cost to get rid of the headache with the compatibility problems.
i'm almost up to par with the xp configuration and so far(although a lot of work) i like it better.
thanks again, denny
