<s> I love Kindle Fire and here is a piece of tip to make you consider this tablet. </s>
<s> For those who are willing to root, flash or side load consider Kindle. </s>
<s> Though it lacks features, it has a fast dual core CPU and IPS screen. </s>
<s> If you are not concern with a tab without GPS, with just 8gb memory and any other feature usually for a high end tablet.. Then you can consider Kindle Fire. </s>
<s> But still carries a laptop too. </s>
<s> For me the Fire is no-sale since my android tab has a camera which I can Skype on as well as a camera for picts and video. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yeah I agree there's a bunch of high-end tab out there in the market, especially if you will consider the interesting features. </s>
<s> Kindle is not much of a fancy tab, just perfect tab for reading. </s>
