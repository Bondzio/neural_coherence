it may have done it's deed!
i offered the 48bit test as a test and not a &quot;solution.&quot; sadly, the solution is to use the disk partitioning tool (disk management) to delete, create, format the new space again and then restore from your last backup.
i don't have a spare machine to see what effect flipping the 48bit registry on and off will do, but hope the malware fighters that i noted this to will look into it.
