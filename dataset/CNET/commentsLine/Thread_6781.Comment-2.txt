for lg, gsa-e30l (18x) is the current model.
for lite-on, shw-160p6su (16x ez-dub) and lh-20a1hx (20x) are current.
unless you're getting a real bargain price (&lt;$60), get a current model since they'll have better media compatibility.
as for philips, they're not a major manufacturer (mostly they just relabel components built by someone else) and wouldn't consider them over lg or liteon.
