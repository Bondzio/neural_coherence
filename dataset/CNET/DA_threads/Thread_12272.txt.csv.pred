1.1.1	I use Windows XP .	St
1.1.2	I recently put a v92 modem on my computer .	St
1.1.3	Now my already sucky 56Kbps will only connect at 28,000 .	St
1.1.4	Any ideas how to tweak this ?	Ques
1.2.1	Best case will about 50k give or take but speeds above 28800 involve both science and magic anyway .	St
1.2.2	Your copper from home to the central office need to be nearly pristine and those within your home can not be picking up induced noise from such as cordless devices , etc .	St
1.2.3	If you were achieving a higher speed before the new modem , take that one back and try another .	St
1.2.4	Get a decent brand and forget the generics .	St
1.2.5	I have cable now but always had better luck with external modems than internal ones when using dial up ... using US Robotics products .	St
