In fact I did have &quot;Make bootable&quot; checked both times a tried.
Under Startup Disk, the folder on that drive showed up as bootable, but when it came to push and shove, it would not start up from there.
I guess I'll switch to another brand.
I liked the idea of an FW800 drive, but being able to boot is the key element I need.
Thanks for your suggestions.
Regards, Ed
