1.1.1	I have an ASUS motherboard, M2N-VM DVI.	St
1.1.2	The processor went bad, an Athlon 64 X2 4600+.	St
1.1.3	I also have an ASUS M4A785-M, and a MSI 785GTM-E45.	St
1.1.4	My point and question is this.....what is the difference between an AM3 socket MB and an AM2/AM2+ MB and a MB that will use all 3?	St
1.1.5	Because I need to replace the processor on my ASUS M2N-VM DVI which is a socket AM2/AM2+.My other 2 motherboards will use all 3 socket type processors.	St
1.1.6	I just want to get the best processor the board will use.	St
1.1.7	Any help is greatly appreciated.	St
1.2.1	I've learned to defer to the CPU support lists.	St
1.2.2	I see a lot of options at http://www.cpu-upgrade.com/mb-ASUS/M2NPV-VM.html Bob	St
1.3.1	use either 785 board, then you can use any AMD processor that you happen to have.	St
1.3.2	Of course AM3 preferred.	St
