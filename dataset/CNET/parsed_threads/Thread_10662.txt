<s> It worked before, then something happened. </s>
<s> I called comcast to see why my desktop could not surf the internet, even though my wireless laptop can surf the internet with the router connceted. </s>
<s> Comcast rep told me to disconncet the router. </s>
<s> When I disconnected the router and connect the PC to the modem...my PC was able to surf the net. </s>
<s> Comcast imformed me that they assigned a new IP address that morning to my modem. </s>
<s> I'm assuming that the new IP address is not being pickup with my router connected. </s>
<s> I asked them to help resolve this issue, Comcast said they don't support routers. </s>
<s> I know this can be too difficult to resolve since I had connection prior to the reassignment of the IP address. </s>
<s> What do I need to set, in order for my desktop to surf the net with the router connect? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> and the computer usually renews the connection to the Internet . </s>
<s> In most cases this will work but you may need to look &quot;under the hood&quot;, in the routers set up page, to see what numbers are being generated. </s>
