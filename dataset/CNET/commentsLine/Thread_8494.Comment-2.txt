**update** i've now changed the name of the network to taco, because i was told not to leave it at the default.
i also researched how to unblock several ports from the firewall.
now opossofran's vista machine can ironically access everybody, but chris and christwo can access each other, eric and mallory can access each other, but chris/christwo cannot access eric/mallory.
i know this is a convuluted mess, but i need some advice.
someone help.
thanks in advance!
