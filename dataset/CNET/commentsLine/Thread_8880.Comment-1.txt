i'm not really a computer person but my grandmother recently asked me to help her pick out a new computer.
i really want to make sure she gets something that will suit her needs and not give her any trouble.
here's what is important for it to have: reliability.
good customer support.
ability to read digital camera media cards.
sufficient speed to watch videos online.
sufficient memory for her pictures (she doesn't take a ton of them, though, so i imagine 320gb would be enough).
cd/dvd burner.
windows 7. small size tower would be nice.
what's not important: multimedia capabilities: she doesn't even have an hd tv in the house.
gaming capabilities.
blu ray.
upgrade-ability.
the most important thing is that it will be reliable.
she knows nothing about computers and i live a ways away so she always has to pay someone to look at her computer when something goes wrong.
she would also like to keep the price under 500$, but at or under 400$ would be better (tower only).
many thanks!
