Epson photo stylus RX700 is what i have,and i'd like to see a better printer.
I don't think so!
Prints 8 1/2 X 11 and down,prints cd's dvd's greeting cards,and much more.
It has 6 inks,which i get (generic)for $3.16 each!
Prints better than a photo shop!
No clogging problems at all with the RX 700.
Plus I received a $150 rebate!
After a years use ,i love it more and more!
