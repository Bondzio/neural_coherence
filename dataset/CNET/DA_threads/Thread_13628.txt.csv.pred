1.1.1	I got a new computer.	St
1.1.2	And I want to get opins what to do with the old one.	St
1.1.3	Specs: HD = 80 gig Win Xp home edition AMD Athlon 64 processor speed 2160 Mhz Installed mem = 1 gig Model HP a1330e I have it up for sale for $125 but getting practically no replies.	St
1.1.4	So I'm thinking of dismantling it and selling off the parts.	St
1.1.5	However, I don't know how to wipe the hard drive clean.	St
1.1.6	Totally clean.	St
1.1.7	Step by step instructions thanks.	St
1.1.8	Do you think it's better to dismantle and sell parts?	St
1.2.1	I saw an all too similar machine on Freecycle (a place where things are freely recycled) albeit with 512MB RAM and a 40GB drive.	St
1.2.2	So your price might be above the impulse level.	St
1.2.3	Try 99 bucks.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I'll reduce the price and see what happens, but ultimately I'll prob.	St
1.3.2	sell the parts.	Sug
1.4.1	If you want to be done with it, sell it for $50-75 to include the s/w bundle that came with it, to include the restore/recovery CDs if so supplied.	St
1.4.2	Because, once you've reformatted or wipe the HD clean 100% you will be cleaning out also the &quot;hidden partition&quot; of the HD supplied recovery/restore process.	St
1.4.3	In such cases the extra cost of getting the CDs if needed will go against you if the buyer needs them.	St
1.4.4	Your system or similar is very common, so don't be too high on sale price and remember its old stuff.	St
1.4.5	Understand a brand new system of entry offerings to include laptops are in the $300+ range on sale or not.	St
1.4.6	To wipe clean the HD of any install entirely use DBAN or KILLDISK, google for them.	St
1.4.7	Of course, save any critical data you deem important.	St
1.4.8	tada -----Willy	St
1.5.1	The sad fact is that these older machines aren't really worth anything, either intact or as parts.	St
1.5.2	You might sell the hard drive and the memory but not much else.	St
1.5.3	However, there are charities that can use them, assuming they are fully working.	St
1.5.4	Here in the UK, there is an organization called ComputerAid that will take an older system, check it out and recycle it to under-privileged children in the third world.	St
1.5.5	I guess you can probably find such an organization where you live.	St
1.5.6	While you should wipe your hard disk (I think Partition Wizard - find it on the web - will do it for you but there are many such cleaners available fro free) if you find the right recycler, they will also ensure the HDD is clean.	St
1.6.1	They take all kinds of information about your equipment (or software, or whatever you'll be contributing), including the age, what shape the stuff is in and so on.	St
1.6.2	Then, if any organization is interested, they'll notify you that someone is interested, and an exchange can be made.	St
1.6.3	I seem to remember that you even can say that the people need to pick the thing(s) up, but you also can arrange to send it.	St
1.6.4	I don't think that they will do repairs, though those who receive the donation may be willing to do so if the donation is salvageable.	St
1.6.5	NCF also gives you a figure for the tax deduction, and the donee will give you a receipt.	St
1.6.6	There is much online about charitable giving of computers and such.	St
1.6.7	Check it out, if National Cristina Foundation doesn't work for you.	St
1.6.8	There may also be nonprofits in your area that need what you have to offer.	St
1.6.9	In any case you'll get a tax deduction and get the stuff out of your house.	St
1.7.1	Give away to local school or maybe neighbor, I gave a similar older computer to my stepdaughter and another to a neighbor who had school-age kids yet couldn't afford to buy a computer.	St
1.7.2	Both partys were very happy, since they just wanted to get on the Internet and do homework.	St
1.7.3	I might have gotten $25-$50 out of the computers but neither had that much and I was happy to keep them out of the landfill.	St
1.8.1	To make HD data unrecoverable, first delete it.	St
1.8.2	Then over-write where it was (and where rit can be recovered from) by filling the free space with garbage files.	St
1.8.3	Fill a folder with pictures, for instance, then makes endless copies of the folder until the HD runs out of space.	St
1.8.4	This'll make the data unrecoverable to anyone other than the CIA.	St
1.9.1	Can someone tell me if I can un-track this message thread?	Sug
1.10.1	I suggest selling your bulk leftover memory to www.smsassembly.com/buymem.php .	St
1.10.2	They gave me a fare price on the ram I had just sitting in my drawer.	St
1.10.3	I heard they also buy used processors and server hardware.	St
1.10.4	Definitely worth a look	St
