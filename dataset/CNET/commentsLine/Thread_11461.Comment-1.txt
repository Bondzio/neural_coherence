current wireless situation: modem has recently been moved along with wireless router to accommodate future streaming video to toshiba hdtv.
(mistake blue-ray is wrong model for streaming video).
this leaves my printer in another location, no longer connected to the wireless router i can no longer print from anywhere.
the printer is located near another broadband connection and is an all-in-one that connects with usb (has ethernet option).
though the cable is live, it is now presently unused.
between the two wants: 1.
