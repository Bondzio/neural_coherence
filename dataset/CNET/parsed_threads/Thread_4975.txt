<s> I have a Dell Dimension 1100 desktop computer and a Panasonic Viera TV (Model TX-32lXD69A), which is LCD. </s>
<s> I want to connect the processor to the TV, so that I can watch movies and TV programmes streamed through my computer on my TV screen. </s>
<s> Could I do this by using a HDMI cable to HDB15? </s>
<s> See link below for details of cable. </s>

<s> Not one of those cables (there are 3 at that link) convert from one thing to another. </s>
<s> The manual I fetched from http://tda.panasonic-europe-service.com/docs/2z50ad3a54z3z25898z656ez706466z23z5553b55f2df4296ddea7d3f8c678b0149a7de09d/tsn2/data/EU/TX32LXD69A/OI/781274/TQB0E0507.pdf Makes no mention of VGA support. </s>

<s> Thanks for your reply, R. Proffit. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, I don't understand what VGA support means. </s>
<s> There's a HDMI socket at the back of the TV. </s>
<s> At present I have a HDMI cable attached from this socket to a Blu Ray player. </s>
<s> I should have wrote in my post that I want to connect my PC to my TV. </s>
<s> You try the HDMI cable you have and if that works, you are done. </s>
<s> I looked for PC details and can't find them so I went to check the TV and found no VGA support so again, a dead end. </s>

<s> I've given up on connecting my PC to my TV. </s>
<s> I'll do this when I upgrade my computer. </s>
<s> If you want to you HDMI then get a video card that has HDMI port. </s>
<s> From what I gather on this thread that's what you're left with. </s>
<s> If there is some adapter, it may not be as cheap or as ready as a video card with the HDMI port. </s>
<s> Don't make this complicated at least that's the direction I'll go. </s>
<s> If you plan to buy another PC, the new video card would be cheaper. </s>
<s> I suggest a ATI 4350 or similar. </s>
