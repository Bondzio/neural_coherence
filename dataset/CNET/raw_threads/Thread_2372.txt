(Link Inside)	I was wondering if anyone could tell me how many amps this power supply has? http://www.ncix.com/products/index.php?sku=23844&vpn=RP-500-PCAR&manufacture=COOLERMASTER I feel foolish but i dont know the symbol for amps :S (i would assume it would be an A...) The ati shopping site reccomends atleast 30 amps on your power supply for the x1950, does this mean i shouldnt buy anything without that or is that just to be safe? (if i misunderstand then let me know :D) Thanks

Odd--the Cooler Master link doesn't show the amps in the specifications list: http://www.coolermaster-usa.com/Products.aspx?pid=1238 However, if you click on the pictures, you will see a table showing all the amp ratings.

There are three key voltages used by computer components. 12 volts, 3.3 Volts, and 5 volts. If the card needs 30 amps on the 5 volt line, having 30 amps on the 12 volt line won't help a bit if the 5 amp only has 10 amp capabiliy. Another reply told you how to see the specs for each of the voltages. Convert each to watts and then read more, the supply normally cannot supply the sum of the three wattages, thus they also post a specification about the maximum total power for the combination of two or three.
