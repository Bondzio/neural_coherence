1.1.1	So I'm running a custom computer with: AMD Athlon XP 2800 1 GB OCZ PC3200 DDR RAM ASUS A7N8X Deluxe Mobo Leadtek GeForce 6600 GT 120 GB Western Digital HD Now when i try to plug in my Creative MuVo to put songs on it, the entire computer goes crazy and everything just stops responding, with System Idle Process taking up 99 percent of the CPU cycle.

1.1.2	I'm running Windows XP Professional SP 2...any idea why my computer goes haywire when i plug in a flash drive?	St
1.2.1	I've seen this happen when XP is installed without loading the necessary drivers for the mainboard and other devices.	St
1.2.2	Or, when the hardware being used is defective.	St
1.2.3	Try it in another machine.	St
1.3.1	The system idle process by design will do that 99 to 100% CPU usage.	St
1.3.2	It's something that is well discussed but it's not a problem or issue worth spending time on.	St
1.3.3	Bob	St
