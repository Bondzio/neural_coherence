1.1.1	I want to upgrade from my P4 2.6MHz processor as it isnt coping very well with the demand my music software places on it .	St
1.1.2	Does anyone know what the best processor I can mount on my ASUS P4P400 ( standard ) motherboard is ?	Ques
1.1.3	thanks	Polite
1.2.1	The issue is that you are nearly at the top end of CPUs for that board .	St
1.2.2	It may be time to pop for some 64-bit CPU or some Intel HT CPU , board and RAM .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Can you suggest any please ?	Ques
1.4.1	I 've used Gigabyte , Asus , MSI , a few others with CPUs from AMD and Intel .	St
1.4.2	Depending on the part of the world you live in , some of these parts may be available .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	The best processor as to performance without overclocking would be a p4 2800 if you can find one for the 400 bus .	St
1.6.1	The ASUS webpage says I can goto the 3.4 if I change the BIOS .	St
1.6.2	Is this right ?	Ques
1.7.1	Thats great .	Polite
1.7.2	I was looking for models .	St
1.8.1	The Asus P4P400-DLX ( 865 chipset ) can support such , but be sure that your current DDRAM is of the right speed and pairs for dual channel operation or you 'll likely get & quot ; not much & quot ; of a boost .	St
1.8.2	Also , the power supply has to have spare Watts to make it all stable and you 'll get a new CPU heatsink/fan .	St
1.8.3	And finally the case has to let all the heat out .	St
1.8.4	Bob	St
1.9.1	Keep in mind that video and music producing software will usualy useup a most of the CPU cycles no matter how fast the processor is , the differece is how long it takes to render the project .	St
