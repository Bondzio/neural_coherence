<s> (11/25/1998) The reported jailing of the three officials comes as Gadhafi is under pressure to accept a plan to turn over for trial two other Libyans wanted for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, that led to 270 deaths. </s>
<s> (11/25/1998) The Tripoli government has insisted that the suspects serve any prison time in Libya or the Netherlands. </s>
