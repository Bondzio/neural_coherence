it sounds like a power issue to me.
do you have a surge protector between the computer and the wall outlet?
you may want to try a ups (uninterruptable power supply) to see if you are getting voltage dips/spikes.
if you do get a ups, make sure the voltage rating is sufficient for your computer and don't plug your printer, especially laser printers, into it.
if that doesn't remedy the problem, you have either a faulty power supply or mobo.
