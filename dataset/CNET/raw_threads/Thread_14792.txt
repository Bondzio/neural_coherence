Let me be very clear here -&gt; There is no such software and if software claims it can do this, it's author lied. Bob

Motherboard: CPU Type: Intel Pentium 4A, 2800 MHz (4.75 x 589) Motherboard Name: AOpen AX4GE Max ( 6 PCI, 1 AGP, 1 CNR, 3 DIMM , Audio, Video, LAN, IEEE-1394) Motherboard Chipset: Intel Brookdale-G i845GE System Memory: 1527 MB (DDR SDRAM) &lt;snip&gt; [ System Slots / AGP ] System Slot Properties: Slot Designation AGP Type AGP 4x Usage Empty Data Bus Width 32-bit

If you can find software to detect that, I have a bridge for sale. Bob

There are similar boards with AGP missing connectors and yet all those software tools report incorrectly. What to do other than rip the lids off? Bob

Or take the BELARC Advisor print out that shows all of the PC info in it and take it to Best Buy or another place that has knowledgeable staff and see if they can tell me the optimum hardware this PC will take. Again Thanks for the input. Mikecynn

823	11	314169	2897579	2895728	ramarc	11/1/08 2:32 PM	1.22554992E12	since you won't answer the specific question	regarding that specific pc, i've run it on quite a few and it's been very accurate. it may not know every possible mobo but for the vast majority of people and pcs, it tells you more than cracking open the case will. (like is that unknown dimm single or double-sided?)
