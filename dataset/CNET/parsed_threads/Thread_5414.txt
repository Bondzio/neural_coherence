<s> I am looking to get a lot more performance out of my system for under $1000. </s>
<s> Here is what I have: DFI LanParty KT400A Socket A, max FSB is 333 for the AthlonXP 3000+. </s>
<s> SB Audigy 2 ZS Platinum, best thing I have ever seen for $174.99 (bought this a while ago) 17&quot; Flat CRT Monitor 16x DVD-ROM Drive 56X CD-ROM Drive AMD AthlonXP 2600+ with 266FSB and 256k L2 Cache, 2144MHZ Stock XFX nVidia GeForce FX 5200-256 Creative Modem Blaster v.92 PCI 56k Modem (unused but still in system) ATI TV Wonder VE (not in system right now, PCI TV capture card) Currently running on a cable modem, its fast...almost too fast. </s>
<s> Logitech Z-640 5.1 Surround System, not-THX but very nice sound quality, i know their a little cheap for that card but still they rock. </s>
<s> Enermax case that you will never get me to give up, for anything, mirrored outside, 4 fans inside along with window and a doored front, the HDD tray in this case is the closest thing to Hotswap I've seen without it being Hotswap. </s>
<s> I have an 80GB Maxtor 7200RPM ATA-133 HDD, with a 2MB cache. </s>
<s> 400W PSU Here is what I am thinking as upgrades for performance 1x 480W PSU from OCZ, controls its own dual fan set-up. </s>
<s> 1x 74 GB Maxtor 10,000 RPM Drive (will these need special cards) 1x Radeon 9800Pro-128 from MSI 1x AMD AthlonXP 3000+ OC'ed to around 2.4GHZ 2x Vantec Tornado fans at 5700RPM, 119 CFM each 1x Aerocooler Hightower CPU cooler and 2x 4800 RPM Aero-X fans with lights for the above CPU cooler, this high power near $100 set-up is to keep that 2400MHZ CPU cooled down. </s>
<s> 1x Silverstone fan controller (best rated fan controller by THG) Any suggestions on what of this stuff to buy and what to no buy, I haven't priced that HDD recently but I know its around $200 which would put all my major upgrades at around $600. </s>
<s> Since a retail XP3000+ from Newegg is running $146 and that 9800Pro from MSI is $195. </s>
<s> I figure about $130 for that PSU, at least thats what I've heard of it to cost. </s>
<s> and then $100 for cooling and if it isn't all spent i'll buy a PCI or 5.25&quot; bay cooler. </s>
<s> so any ideas as to what to buy or not buy? </s>
<s> And will that 10,000 RPM disk need a special card. </s>
<s> oh yeah, i was gonna get a HDD cooler for that 74 GB disk, it seemed like a use of $7 to save a $200 device from cooking itself. </s>
<s> well if anyone has any ideas, and how would i transfer the contents of my 80GB straight over to my new 74GB? </s>
<s> I don't want to lose all my gaming progress...or custom maps. </s>
<s> thanks PS I would be fine with the loss of 6GB of storage, because I have never filled more than 45GB of disk space </s>
<s> First of all, in order to OC that proc, you will need a new mobo, since the one you say you have has a max FSB of 333Mhz. </s>
<s> That's because the multiplier is locked, so you will need to OC by raising the FSB. </s>
<s> The HD is most likely SCSI (possibly SATA), if SCSI, then you will need a PCI card for that, if SATA, then a new mobo with onboard SATA will work. </s>
<s> The video card is a nice choice, but I would also make sure you have 2 sticks of memory running in dual channel (512 x 2) for a total of 1GB at least. </s>
<s> ok, the Maxtor is SCSI, but there is a WD with SATA, and it costs about $60 less, so I'll go with the Western Digital. </s>
<s> Also, my board can do FSB 400, just not the AthlonXP 3200+, its a jumper setting for 400MHZ over 333. </s>
<s> DFI and AMD say that the board will not run the AthlonXP 3200+, in part because it doesn't have Dual Channel RAM which the 3200 needs for optimal performance. </s>
<s> so if I set it to FSB 400, and set the processor multiplier to say 16.5, ok thats a bit high, lets say 11, couldn't I get the 2200MHZ performance of the 3200+ then? </s>
<s> and just go upto 12 for the 2400MHZ that I wanted? </s>
<s> (assuming that cooler will take it there) It would work right? </s>
<s> Im too affraid to do it to my XP 2600, since it would almost double the FSB, 133-200 would that get me some performance? </s>
<s> well thanks. </s>
<s> Also if i'm using DDR just not Dual Channel, I'll still get performance right? </s>
<s> I don't want to replace my RAM because I have so much single channel DDR right now if I replaced it all Dual Channel I would spend around $600. </s>
<s> The only item I see to a bottleneck for GAMERS is that GeForce FX 5200-256 video card. </s>
<s> Look at www.tomshardware.com and while it's better than what we had years ago, it's still at the bottom of the heap. </s>
<s> i.e. </s>
<s> a &quot;value&quot; card. </s>
<s> You can save yourself time and money if you just picked out a nice video card. </s>
<s> That will give you the biggest BANG. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Just be aware that you will probably notice only a minor difference in performance with all you are talking about doing. </s>
<s> You are just not changing much that will give you a noticeable boost in performance. </s>
<s> You are overdoing it with fans, you won't get any extra performance from that and pushing an AMD processor is asking for a burnout, no matter what fan you use. </s>
<s> Systems running 3.6Ghz P4 processors run just fine and will last for years with a single case fan and a power supply fan. </s>
<s> If you were to go to SCSI then go to the 15,000 RPM drives, not the 10,0000, though now you say you will go SATA and that will not really make a major difference in overall performance. </s>
<s> You would be better off waiting and replacing the whole system with a new faster 64bit processor with a significantly faster Ghz rating....shoot for 3Ghz or higher to really get a boost in performance. </s>
<s> Also shoot for more cache than 256mb, like the 1Gb of the 64bit processor. </s>
<s> Concentrate on keeping your system cooled and powered. </s>
<s> So get the p/s and any fans you desire then proceed with the other h/w. </s>
<s> In the long run, you'll be happier even though the p/s and fans don't add anything but stability to the system, its worth it before speed and those goodies. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> Again, with the multiplier locked, the ONLY way to OC the proc is to adjust the FSB. </s>
<s> You wouldn't need new memory to run dual channel, just a board that supports the feature (assuming you have at least 2 identical sticks). </s>
<s> There is no such thing as dual channel memory, it's a feature of the mobo. </s>
<s> The speed of your DDR memory will affect the ability to overclock as well. </s>
<s> If gaming: Video is number 1. </s>
<s> Best you can afford. </s>
<s> Transfer rate (not rotational speed) of hard drive to FSB is second - cache is important. </s>
<s> Same thing for optical drives if games are not resident. </s>
<s> Thus a primary optical and a primary hard drive on the same IDE channel does not enhance throughput. </s>
<s> Cpu compute and memory speed are in my belief third and must be matched for performance to each other and to FSB. </s>
<s> Whichever is slowest rules. </s>
<s> If online gaming then broadband, hopefully in a non-congested area. </s>
<s> Move to a retirement community and you will have great cable bandwidth for computing. </s>
<s> At the moment SATA and Ultra160 or better SCSI are good choices for drive throughput. </s>
