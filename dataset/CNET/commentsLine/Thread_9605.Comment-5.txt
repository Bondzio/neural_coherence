i was just using the xs as space fillers.
there are multiple files that cannot be copied, probably around 20-30, mostly system files, (.dll, .xsl, etc.)
when i browse for the files, they are right there on the cd where they are supposed to be, but they will not copy!
i also tried copying the entire directory from the cd onto the c: drive and accessing the files that way but they still will not copy to wherever the install is trying to put them.
i was able to scan my hard drive for viruses while attempting to do a reinstall*, but it came up with nothing.
at this point i am considering buying a new hd, installing xp on it and using it as my primary, although i would like to avoid that if at all possible.
i will re-run the chkdsk and report to you the output when i get home today.
my drive is an ata drive.
also, i do not have the chkdsk c: /f option, only /r and /p, i ran both and /p reported that it found errors if i remember correctly, but again, i will get the proper wording to you later this evening.
additionally, because the reinstall crapped out and there are system files missing, i get the dreaded blue screen whenever i try to boot into windows *i was able to do this while browsing for the files that could not be copied, i navigated the open file window to my computer and i was able to right-click the c: drive and scan it with mcaffee virusscan that way.
