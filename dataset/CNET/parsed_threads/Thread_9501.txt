<s> I have gone through 2 3tb seagate expansion drives, the usb connectors breakfrom the circuit board. </s>
<s> I bought a thermaltake 5g. </s>
<s> When I connect the message that I get is that hd needs to be formated. </s>
<s> What can I do to rectify this? </s>

<s> And does anyone know if I can get a cheaper drive whose board will work on this? </s>
<s> Thank you in advance </s>
