ok - i ended up resetting the modem back to factory settings which put back the ssid and password.
that allowed it to work again.
i then changed just the password and the printer was still able to reconnect.
so - i am not sure if it did not like the ssid i was trying to use or if something else happened but i can live with the weird ssid but a password that works for me.
thanks everyone.
