I've lost count of how many times I've helped others find the Print Black Only in their printer control panels.
There is no standard so I end up fishing around all the panels till I find it.
I didn't pay much more than 100 for a HP k550 and the printing costs haven't been too bad.
Have you seen the new Kodak printers?
