replaced my mobo with the exact same one that was on my system intel desktop board d815epea2.
the only difference was the old mobo had onboard video and the new one needed an agp card.
i installed a evga card e-geforce mx4000 and added a trendnet wireless pci card.
i left the hard drive with windows xp home that was being used on the old system and 2 cd drives.
the problem is that when i turn on the system i get no video.
nothing happens on the monitor.
i looked at an old post in april where someone had the same problem but it was inconclusive.
would appreciate some ideas as to why this is happening.
thanks
