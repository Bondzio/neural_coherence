hi everyone.
i posted a topic a while back about internet problems, but i'm back again.
i`m using a lg x120 netbook.
my wireless router is dlink dir-601.
operating system: windows 7 what happens is my internet stops working for gaps at a time.
it will not disconnect, but the page will stop loading and lead me to the cannot display page.
when i posted my problems before, here were some of the responses: 1) reset your wireless router to factory settings, then set it up again.
---i did this, set it up as followed on the instructions, still having the same problems.
2) make sure you are using wpa and not wep.
---i am.
3) make sure your firmware is up to date.
---there is nowhere on dlinks website to download a `firmware update`for the dir-601.
there is a webpage that lets me log into my router, and it says i am firmware 1.00na.
4) try unplugging for 30s and plug back in.
---tried it, still problems.
here`s something else that might help, i am not sure: when the internet does cut out and i get the error webpage, i click the `troubleshoot` button and windows does its scan for errors type thing.
this is usually what happens.
1) scans.
result: windows couldn`t identify the problem.
fixed.
internet now works again until next cut out.
2) scans.
result: dns server isn`t responding.
fixed.
internet now works again until next cut out.
3) scans.
result: windows cannot automatically detect this network`s settings.
fixed.
internet now works until next cut out.
please help me, i am so frusterated.
i am not only frusterated by my slow, cutting out internet at my home, but i am more frusterated at the fact that i don`t know very much about computers and i can`t fix this.
thank you in advance for helping me out forum...
