that you cannot start up in OS 9.2 Even though you have installed OS X 10.2.8 you should still be able to start up in 9.2 These corruption issues, were they in OS 9 or where they in OS X.
Are you starting in X and then switching to OS 9 (Classic), a situation you should try to avoid.
Once you make the move to X, it is easier on your nerves to attempt to do everything in X rather than go back to 9 from X Which OS are you now having problems with, OS X or OS 9(Classic)?
I remember that I suggested that you get a copy of OS X 10.3.
There is a distinct possibility that the system is now so messed up that the best move is to wipe it all out and start again.
Let us know about the 9 & X situation.
