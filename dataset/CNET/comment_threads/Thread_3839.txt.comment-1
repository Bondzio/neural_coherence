I recently bought an 80gb Zune.
Using my old ipod's plug that connects the Zune to a TV, I attempted to connect the Zune to a friend's TV.
However, it did not work and I lost ALL of the directional buttons and touch-features on the directional pad.
The play/pause and back buttons work fine.
HOWEVER, I cannot restart it because this involved pressing up on the pad and back, and this is obviously impossible with the pad out of commission.
Is there any software I can download to refresh the Zune?
Additionally is there any other way to manually reset it?
I've held down the play/pause button many times and the Zune software is up to date.
