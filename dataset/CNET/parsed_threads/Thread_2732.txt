<s> I'm a newbie to setting up RAID and need help. </s>
<s> I current using a MS 6741 motherboard with capabilities for SATA RAID and I think I have found the best drive (speed+size+quiet+price) for my gaming rig. </s>
<s> I've read Toms Hardware review for the Seagate Barracuda 7200.8 300GB SATA and it looks a good choice but I need another opinion, please! </s>
<s> I was having huge doubts over the speed potiental of SATA compared to my current 2x200GB IDE hard drives. </s>
<s> They are Western Digital Caviar WD20000 BB-98DWAO. </s>
<s> Using HD Tach 3.0.1.0 I got the following benchmark results: random access 13.8, CPU utilization 2%, average read 40.6Mb/s, burst speed 77.3Mb/s. </s>
<s> I read a bit about SATA, but if someone could run HD Tach on their SATA RAID-0 system and post their results, i'll see what the differences are. </s>
<s> The Barracuda 7200.8 had a burst speed of 126Mb/s with NCQ disabled, although the reviewer didn't mention if this test was based on a RAID-0 system. </s>
<s> Is a MS 6741 motherboard easy to set up RAID and what essential steps should I take? </s>
<s> I've found the best price of a Seagate Barracuda 7200.8 300GB to be at ebuyer.com of just 114.99 but i'm not sure what power/data cables I need. </s>
<s> I'm after a power cable that'll convert the existing IDE to SATA. </s>
<s> It uses 7 pin Serial ATA, what is this referring to? </s>
<s> Many thanks for reading this and for helping me </s>
<s> My mate has just convinced my to get the &quot;Maxtor DiamondMax 10 300GB SATA 16MB 7200RPM NCQ&quot; because it's really fast, only 120 and has 16MB of cache - double the Seagate. </s>
<s> He also mentioned that some Seagate drives are loud and the Maxtor is quieter. </s>
<s> Another big plus with the Maxtor is that you can use either an existing 4-pin power connector and I think it comes pack with a SATA interface/data cable - all that you need to get it up and running. </s>
<s> Are there any other drives like this? </s>
<s> ...because Seagate just bought Maxtor...maybe they'll look inside the Maxtor's and see why they're so much quieter...lol. </s>
