i use win2k on my home pc and at work.
i've got 3 adaptec enclosures: one acs-100 with a 200gb seagate the other with a 320gb western digital and an acs-120 with a 2.5&quot; 100gb seagate.
i've had execellent results with the adaptec acs-100 as well as the acs-120 and they handle hard disk drives up to 1,000gbs.
