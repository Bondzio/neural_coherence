1.1.1	Ok I have a 22&quot; LCD westinghouse (LCM-22w3).	St
1.1.2	I have an older Dell dimension desktop 8250 with a Nvidia GeForce4 MX 420 (old I know).	St
1.1.3	It was worked beautifully and had great resolution since I bought the monitor in late 07.	St
1.1.4	Never had a SINGLE problem.	St
1.1.5	So I turn off my computer yesterday and go shopping.	St
1.1.6	Come home and my resolution is absolutely shot.	St
1.1.7	My desktop font and icons are blurry, along with the desktop background picture.	St
1.1.8	I have adjusted the resoltuion from 800X600 all the way up to 1600X1200 etc.	St
1.1.9	The icons get smaller and windows adjust, but consistantly it is blurry with pictures, font, graphics, etc.	St
1.1.10	I have spent the last day installing and re-installing drivers (using driver sweeper in regular and safe mode, getting rid of old ones drivers, resintalling, etc etc).	St
1.1.11	I have googled countless things and have tried everything I can.	St
1.1.12	Nothing seems to work.	St
1.1.13	My Device Manager says the &quot;device&quot; is working properly.	St
1.1.14	I have added the drivers manually, I have had windows find them, I have shown windowns the location etc (all these times compltetely uninstalling the old drivers and reinstalling again).	St
1.1.15	I have used my old drivers disk and also the new updated drivers from the NVIDIA website I am at a loss.	St
1.1.16	I don't know what it could be.	St
1.1.17	It is just a plug and play monitor with auto adjust with does nothing really.	St
1.1.18	Yes I unchecked shadows for text and did/undid clear font, that is not the problem in the least.	St
1.1.19	It went from 1600X 1200 excellent resolution to absolute garbage.	St
1.1.20	Now here is the strange part.	St
1.1.21	I have tested two games, battlefield vietnam and solider of fortune.	St
1.1.22	The resolutions seems to be just as good, but it does seems a little strange as far as how fluid it is and also there is these very subtle but annoying verticle lines running the length of the monitor.	St
1.1.23	Please help.	St
1.1.24	I am at a total loss.	St
1.1.25	Thank you.	St
1.2.1	Easiest check is to hook another monitor to system see what result you have, am suspecting video issue with system, which mean Vid card replacement.	Sug
1.2.2	But as I said, get another monitor to hook up, easy way to tell if it is the monitor or video problem within system.	St
1.2.3	Good luck!	St
1.3.1	any other res will look 'fuzzy' http://www.westinghousedigital.com/details.aspx?itemnum=108	St
