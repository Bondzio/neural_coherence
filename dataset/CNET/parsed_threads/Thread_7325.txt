<s> My mouse pointer recently started to move and click on its own. </s>
<s> It would draw selection rectangles and right click and left click. </s>
<s> I disconnected the network, but it continued. </s>
<s> AVG and Panda were unable to detect viruses, and Windows Defender and Ad-Aware failed to find spyware. </s>
<s> I swapped mice, and noticed when I installed my backup mouse with the original drivers that there was a second mouse installed on my system in Device Manager. </s>
<s> It was a generic driver for a &quot;HID-compliant mouse&quot;. </s>
<s> When I disabled this device the mouse stopped moving on its own. </s>
<s> I tried uninstalling it but it came back. </s>
<s> I don't know if it will stay disabled. </s>
<s> Has anyone ever heard of this happening before? </s>
<s> I'd boot safe mode and remove all mice found. </s>
<s> Let windows use what it feels like on the next boot. </s>

<s> you get into the habit of rolling a wheel on the mousepad. </s>
<s> Its almost like a third hand. </s>
<s> But if you have an optical mouse, there isn't any ball to drag on a mouse pad. </s>
<s> Just a laser light. </s>
<s> So if you pick up your optical mouse off the optical surface it will move on its own. </s>
<s> Almost feeling like someone else is using it. </s>
<s> Could that be it? </s>
