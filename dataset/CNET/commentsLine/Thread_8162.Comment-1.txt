i've been using my linksys wireless b usb network adapter ver 4 to get my internet connection for about 3-4 years now & i know they there is something newer & better than my linksys network adapter out there.
i want something that does exzactly the same thing & hooks up to my laptop exzactly the way my linksys does....just something more modern & perhaps more powerful.
any suggestions?
please & thank you!
