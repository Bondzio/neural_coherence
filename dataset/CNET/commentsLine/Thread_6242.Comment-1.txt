we own a pre-intel ibook and have loved it because it has been easy to use and worry-free.
though we have been hampered by the bug-ridden, limited quickbooks pro for mac, my husband's business runs on the ibook except for one small part, which requires a pc.
we have continued to use our gateway astro pc for that purpose but will be unable to use it once the customer upgrades to internet explorer 7, we are told.
(please correct me if i am wrong.)
our decision is, do we buy an intel mac and make it a pc/mac?
or do we replace the astro with a budget pc?
because the pc is used only for accessing the customer site, we don't even run anti-virus software (which always seemed to gum up the works) and use dial-up; we could do the same with the pc and keep costs and hassle to a minimum.
if we got an intel mac, we'd feel the need to protect it, but could use cable to access the internet and make use of pc software like quickbooks.
i'm trying to figure out how difficult it is to deal with an intel mac.
obviously we are not computer-savvy and have really loved the ibook because it has been so easy for dummies like us.
