i'm using win xp sp2 and have just reformatted.
but then it my computer will crash/freeze like every hour and becoming more frequent, until recently it will crash every time right after i startup windows when i turn on my comp.
every time right before the crash/freeze occur, i would hear a slight clicking sound from my comp, sounded like its from the hd not the floppy.
then after i restart, i will get the message disk boot failure, insert system disk and press enter.
i then check the boot options on my bios and notice it isnt detecting my hd.
but my floppy which is what i have set as a priority to boot from is detected.
ive always had the floppy as the primary boot drive for the past few years and no problem until i recently reformatted.
so now im just wondering what the problem is?
is it my hd, my operating system or something else?
thanks in advance.
