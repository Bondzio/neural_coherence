seems i've not been clear last night.
printer worked when i got it except red ink had lines.
cleaning heads with head cleaning did not improve this.
after using printer for a while the black ink indicator said to replace it.
i refilled the black and it would not work after multiable cleanings.
decided to remove both and use head cleaner in wells.
then neither cartridge would work.
that's why i wondered if this epson was one that had the chips to prevent the use of cartiadges once they were removed.
trying to figure out if i need a chip or a printer.
sorry for the confusion.
