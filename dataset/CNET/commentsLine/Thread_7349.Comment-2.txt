1. when the pump is on, something is expanding in volume a little.
normal for plastics and tubing.
2. water is not compressible (let's accept that for a moment) but there is some note from you that it's almost bubble free so any bubble can be compressed.
are you fretting over this a bit too much?
i mean, does it work?
