<s> My motherboard died in my (e machines T6420) 4 days out of the 1 year warranty, and my brother's did the same in his T6420 just within the warranty. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Is there any way to find out if these boards are commonly defective, as 1 year seems ridiculous? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Do I have any recourse? </s>
<s> Who's the right person to complain to besides the tech dept which diagnosed the problem? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Any suggestions for a good quality upgrade motherboard if I'm stuck with the repair? </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> I see them to be under 99 bucks (most) at newegg.com and geeks.com. </s>
<s> So while this failure may seem spooky at first I run into blown USB and keyboard ports during Winter (north of the equator) due to electro static discharges or other reasons. </s>
<s> One of the downsides of not maintaining your own machine will be paying about 300 or so for a repair. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> At a minimum, give eMachines a call. </s>
<s> Explain the problem and they may get you a new motherboard. </s>
<s> It's worth a shot. </s>
<s> If you must replace the motherboard, you can get info on your current T6420 motherboard here: http://www.emachine-upgraders.info/dir1/support/t_w_series_usa_motherboards.shtml </s>
<s> e-machines conveniently lists only a $20 tech support line, and after many e-mail correspondances with support, they still would not give out a (customer service number). </s>
<s> So basically they just hope you'll go away! </s>
<s> Unless any one has a better way to get their attention, it looks like I will have to get a motherboard. </s>
<s> Are their any brands which stand out over the rest, and would upgrading to a faster speed comb. </s>
<s> board be a difficult transition? </s>
<s> FYI, my 13 month old e machine T6420 motherboard just died. </s>
<s> Also, FYI, my e machine notebook died last year after being only 18 months old. </s>
<s> I don't think it would be smart to buy another e machine....nor to repair an existing e machine. </s>
<s> Since 1985 I've had desktops and notebooks from Toshiba, Compaq, HP, e Machine, IBM, Sony, etc...and has always been the cheapest price but has always died on me. </s>
<s> All the other computers just got obsolete. </s>
<s> Motherboard in my *14* month-old eMachine t6420 just died. </s>
<s> Wish I'd seen these posts last year when I was considering which box to buy . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> All my research indicated eMachines were pretty big bang for the buck . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> guess you get what you pay for. </s>
<s> I have an eMachine T6412 and the motherboard died 1 day before the end of the warranty, we took it to Best Buy who sent it to eMachines and they gladly replaced it. </s>
<s> Thanks for all your responses. </s>
<s> I had the computer repaired finally this week, no thanks to e machines. </s>
<s> The place that repaired it contacted e machines and after talking with several people and calling different numbers to get a replacement board, the representative said if I had contacted them within a week or two after the warranty and asked for a supervisor they would have repaired it under warranty. </s>
<s> What a crock! </s>
<s> I repeatedly asked for a supervisor during several online chat sessions with their technicians and they never once connected me with a supervisor, nor would they give me a number to call to speak with a representative. </s>
<s> I saved all those frustrating e-mails. </s>
<s> It appears many users had the same problem and guess what, that motherboard is not available. </s>
<s> My next computer will not be an e machines/gateway. </s>
<s> Brad </s>
<s> Dear friend, I operate a computer consulting and repair business in Michigan. </s>
<s> I have only ever had to replace motherboards (this entire year) in the very same brand and model of computer you made reference to. </s>
<s> I've spoken with other repair personnel in this area and we've discovered it to be the e-machine case that causes the motherboardss to fail. </s>
<s> There was one customer who'd replaced his motherboard twice before finally replacing EVERYTHING except the case. </s>
<s> On his third go-round, his motherboard again shorted and failed after a while. </s>
<s> As near as we can tell... the stamped hold-down holes in the e-machine case have a larger surface area than your conventional hexagonal screwin hold-downs, which we feel is the primary culprit of the unprecedented e-machine failure rate. </s>
<s> I to, have a T6420 which lasted a whole 18 months before its untimely demise. </s>
<s> Such a long life. </s>
<s> Called E-Machines at there non toll free number ( 408-273-0888),thank God for nationwide cell plans, and vented on them. </s>
<s> Did no good of course, but I feel a little better. </s>
<s> I guess I'm going to strip the E-Machine of all the drives, most of which were upgrades I installed, and buy a new quality case, motherboard, and CPU and install my drives and boards in it. </s>
<s> One things sure, I'll never go near a E-Machine or Gateway again. </s>
<s> I also want to add that TWO (2) eMachine Model T6420 computers purchased just over one year ago have also failed for myself and my mother. </s>
<s> Problem appeared to be bad power supplies at first, replaced and appeared to fix the problem, but then the video output went out on one followed by non-booting. </s>
<s> Second computer also failed without being able to power up the system, PSU replacement did not correct the problem. </s>
<s> The co-incident that both computers failed within the sametime frame (and just out of warrenty) leads me to believe that Gateway/eMachines have sold DEFECTIVE products. </s>
<s> I am bringing this to the attention of an attorney and will inquire as to whether this should provide grounds for a CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT against these people. </s>
<s> Anyone else interested if we move forward with such a lawsuit?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> I also have an emachine t6420 that died just shy of two years. </s>
<s> Very frustrating. </s>
<s> I contacted Gateway and the tech agreed that emachines is not a good product and they are replacing them. </s>
<s> It sounds as if emachines was selling defective computers. </s>
<s> Let me know if this turns into a class action suit. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I've had my T6420 about 2 years now, only problem I've had was to replace the hard drive about 3 months ago. </s>
<s> Not happy about that! </s>
<s> Would love to know about any lawsuits. </s>
<s> I have had my Emachines T6420 for almost exectly 24 months. </s>
<s> Motherboard is having problems. </s>
<s> I can't restart and USB mouse drops out all the time. </s>
<s> Also video jumping around. </s>
<s> A friend of mine who owns a computer support business did a remote on my machine and thinks a bad capacitor on the motherboard is the culprit. </s>
<s> He says this is common in Emachines and Dell Optiplex. </s>
<s> Emachines support is completely useless. </s>
<s> What a bunch of total idiodts. </s>
<s> Their answer to everything is to do a full system restore. </s>
<s> I have no doubt they knew of MS-7207 Motherboard problems long ago and continued to sell these crappo units. </s>
<s> Anyway, here is my question. </s>
<s> I am going to replace my MS-7207 motherboard but I have noticed that it comes in two versions. </s>
<s> One with the Nvidea GeForce 6100 chipset and the other version with the Nvidea GeForce 6150 chipset. </s>
<s> Does anyone know if the 6150 chipset motherboard is compatible in the T6420? </s>
<s> In other words would it operate on the same drivers and Bios and would I be able to use the same restore disk? </s>
<s> If yes then I intend to get this board instead of the original because it offers DVI out connections for monitor. </s>
<s> Thanks, Strat100 </s>
<s> The XP OS will want to re-activate and won't since it's another motherboard. </s>
<s> You learn this after a few forays into the swamp. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Can you ellaborate? </s>
<s> Are you saying that I have no options here. </s>
<s> That even replacing the motherboard won't help me because the the restore disk won't work on a new motherboard? </s>
<s> I'm lost on that one. </s>
<s> I thought I would be ok If I just took the old processor and memory off of my old motherboard and put it on a new motherboard? </s>
<s> My computer is working right now it just has problems and I want to replace the motherboard. </s>
<s> I would like to use the 6150 chipset but it's not crucial. </s>
<s> I have no problem using the stock motherboard that came in it. </s>
<s> Sounds as if you have fallen into this swamp yourself? </s>
<s> Strat100 </s>
<s> How Windows detects changes in the hardware. </s>
<s> Also the supplied OS is often locked to the system as supplied. </s>
<s> I only note this so you won't be totally surprised about not only having to install a few drivers but having to get a XP license as well. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I see what you are saying now. </s>
<s> Emachines is really a racket. </s>
<s> I will never buy another thats for sure. </s>
<s> They are the worst company I have ever dealt with. </s>
<s> What cheap crap they sell. </s>
<s> Anyway, there is no way I am going to pay them $160.00 for a motherboard and then still have to jump through hoops to get it all to work. </s>
<s> My plan at this point is to scrap everything but the case, hard drive, and media reader. </s>
<s> I think I will find a deal on a Motherboard/CPU bundle, power supply, and a new Liscensed XP. </s>
<s> I don't know what other choice I really have right now. </s>
<s> I undestand the tower case is pretty generic and should fit most components. </s>
<s> Is this your understanding as well? </s>
<s> Thanks, Strat100 </s>
<s> That is, their written agreement that I will be avoiding the 99 to 199 dollar price tag and bill for Windows... -&gt; Emachines has no corner on the market on this issue. </s>
<s> Just about every retail machine will not run the supplied windows if you change the motherboard. </s>
<s> Look up HP and the word &quot;TATTOO my motherboard.&quot; Bob </s>
<s> I've replaced motherboards numerous times on e-Machines, sometimes with the same make and model, other times with newer or different models. </s>
<s> Though I don't use a &quot;restore disk&quot; per say, I've never had any problems reloading Windows XP and using the existing license key that is affixed to the side of the e-Machine. </s>
<s> At the time you need to &quot;Activate&quot; your Operating System, you will notice an option to change the key. </s>
<s> If you choose that option, you can enter your actual key and click generate ID. </s>
<s> With this new ID, you'll be able to authenticate with Windows. </s>
<s> If not, call them, it takes about 6 minutes, they don't give you ANY problems and you'll be activated before you hang up. </s>
<s> My emachine died on Friday. </s>
<s> Came home and tried to power it up and got nothing. </s>
<s> At first I thought it may be the HD, but soon discovered it wasn't. </s>
<s> I can at least get all my data off the HD before I wipe it completely. </s>
<s> I rebuild computers a lot and I've never had an issue with activating an OS. </s>
<s> It's all automated, unless something goes haywire on their end. </s>
<s> Then, you just read the numbers and they repeat a different set back, you enter them and your done. </s>
<s> I replaced my motherboard last week on my Emachines T6420. </s>
<s> Replaced it with a Biostar GeForce 6100-M9. </s>
<s> Boot up went smoothly. </s>
<s> For revalidation for Windows XP I ended up having to call Windows but once I did It went smoothly and had no problems. </s>
<s> So far motherboard is operating just fine and I didn't lose any previous info or have to do a restore or anything. </s>
<s> I am having one small problem though. </s>
<s> My CPU fan and System (case) fan are running fast all the time. </s>
<s> My CPU temperature seems ok and is normally running at a bout 24 degrees celsius and under gaming conditions at about 34 C so it does not seem to be a heat problem. </s>
<s> I did add a little heat sink compund back to the top of the cpu where it meets the heat sink when I did the install so i know it is transfering heat ok. </s>
<s> This seems to be more a problem with the fans not beiung sensed. </s>
<s> I have checked my bios and have everything set correctly there. </s>
<s> Have cool-n-quiet set to auto and my power options in windows set to minimum power management. </s>
<s> Not sure what the problem is but it is annoying with the fans running fast all the time. </s>
<s> Loud. </s>
<s> Anyone else encountered this problem? </s>
<s> Strat 100 </s>
<s> I purchased an Emachine T3092 from Circuit City in Paducah Kentucky. </s>
<s> The capacitors on the motherboard have leaked battery acid which has eaten the traces and done other damage to materials inside of the case. </s>
<s> If you are having any trouble with Emachine and would like to have all of your money refunded to you by means of a Class-Action lawsuit (nothing is necessary on your behalf unless otherwise specified) please email me at polachelliot@aol.com Thank you for your time Elliot Polach </s>
<s> I bought this machine in march 2006.. it is now in the shop for the 3rd time.. 2 times to replace the motherboard.. (these two times were within about 4 months time... this time they say is most likely the motherboard but I haven't gotten it back so not sure what will be done. </s>
<s> email me at yorkiepaws@msn.com if I can be included in a class action suit.. thanks, Elizabeth </s>
<s> I was wondering if this class-action lawsuit was still coming up or if it had already been settled. </s>
<s> I bought my eMachine T6420 in Dec. 07 for around $700 or so if i remember correctly and had to replace the motherboard in Jan. 08 for another $160. </s>
<s> Just recently i tried to upgrade the video card so i bought a PCIexpress card, but the motherboard doesn't seem to see it there. </s>
<s> The one time that it did see it, the computer froze during the Windows loading screen. </s>
<s> I am definately down for getting my money back for a machine that has seemed to cause problems for just about everyone who has owned one. </s>
<s> Please let me know what is/has happened with this lawsuit. </s>
<s> Thank you Jon plouffy_69_01@yahoo.com </s>
