one suggestion is to look carefully at the old and replancement (new) on-board controllers and make sure the &quot;new one&quot; is configured exactly the same way as the original.
look for jumpers, dip switches, etc.
and set them the same way as they were on the old one.
you might also verify that the drive that had the replacement controller was visible to the os before swapping the cards.
good luck, -ron
