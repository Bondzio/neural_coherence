first, you'll have to decide if you want your display cloned (both monitor and tv display the same image) or your desktop expanded to two monitors.
the steps to do this are somewhat dependent on your graphics card (which you didn't mention).
also, you should set the pc to use either a 1920x1080 (recommended) or 1280x720 resolution for the tv.
lastly, you won't get sound over dvi.
you'll need to use a 3.5mm stereo cable ( like this ) to connect your pc's headphone/speaker jack to the stereo input jack on the tv.
