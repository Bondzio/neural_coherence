<s> I have four Seagate 40GB IDE hard drives that were removed from working PCs. </s>
<s> In each case, the drive was reformatted in the PC. </s>
<s> My aim was to use these drives as (free) medium-capacity backups -- mostly for video projects. </s>
<s> I bought an IDE-to-USB adapter cable that plugs into the back of the drive, so the drives can be used as enclosure-less externals. </s>
<s> Out of the four drives, only ONE works with the cable. </s>
<s> The other three don't spin up. </s>
<s> The drives seem to TRY to spin, but just repeatedly lurch and beep (I can feel the drive twist when I touch it). </s>
<s> I suspected that the cable wasn't providing enough power, but checking with a multimeter, the power cable provides the necessary 5 and 12V with upwards of 5 amps. </s>
<s> At least very close to the needed voltages (4.9 and 11.8). </s>
<s> Is the adapter cable's power supply the problem? </s>
<s> I don't understand why all four worked in a PC, but only one works with the cable. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> If so, there isn't going to be adequate power to run an external 3 1/2 inch drive. </s>
<s> Taking current measurements with a multimeter is a tricky and imprecise process as well. </s>
<s> You can't really measure what can be provided but only what is being drawn at any one time. </s>
<s> As well, motors need much more current to start them than to keep them spinning. </s>
<s> The rule I remember from long ago is 7X current to start. </s>
<s> This won't apply universally today but might give you an idea of what to expect. </s>
<s> You should be able to plug just the power connector from the 4 pin molex on a computer's PS and get it to spin without a data cable connected. </s>
<s> If it does, the drive's mechanical system is OK. </s>
<s> If not, the drive is probably beyond its usefulness. </s>
<s> Need more info on the system you are using, specifically PSU capacity, might be underpowered for the task(s). </s>
<s> No, the power doesn't come from the IDE/USB cable. </s>
<s> There's a separate cable to a wall outlet. </s>
<s> The power supply is marked saying the output is 2 amps. </s>
<s> The drives say 5V @ 0.85A and 12V @ 0.75A. </s>
<s> If the ext. </s>
<s> cable setup was correctly attached and the drives are jumpered or setup right as well, then that only leaves the small AC wart providing power. </s>
<s> Understand the 40gb HDs are older and tend to be wanting more power than newer HDs as the int. </s>
<s> HD motor is more power demanding. </s>
<s> On top of all that any past wear&tear of the HDs could be enough to overcome the initial startup juice required, in other words, no Ummfff!!! </s>
<s> to get it spinning. </s>
<s> -OR- they are spinning(very quiet) but yet another connection problem exists, they aren't being recognized for whatever reason. </s>
<s> I have an ADA-2020(like yours???) </s>
<s> and works work quite well until I deal with much older drives to includes CD. </s>
<s> Check the HD specs for the jumpering, some older HD needed dual jumpers when operating alone. </s>
<s> While there, the specs should state the power demands. </s>
<s> Need, be sure the contacts are clean. </s>
<s> Follow that and inspect the specs of the AC wart to compare. </s>
<s> Also, unless you have a AMP clamp to gauge the true draw of power, a typical meter just won't do unless that's an option. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> The ADA-2020 is pretty much what I have. </s>
<s> The drives aren't merely running quietly, as I can hear them repeatedly TRYING to spin. </s>
<s> Oh well. </s>
<s> At least the whole exercise didn't cost me anything. </s>
