custom built computer s are soooo much better and i highly reccomend it (if you have the experience and know what you are doing).
by building your own computer, you get the options of choosing the performance of the machine.
such as speed, look, and hardware components.
atleast by this way, you know what you are putting in the system and you know that it's not going to be some cheap knockoff part that the company has installed.
not to mention the programs, crappy anti-viruses like norton always get put on machines and they are crap!
this way, you add your own trusted software that you like!
(p.s.
if you don;t know what you're doing, then... learn :p)
