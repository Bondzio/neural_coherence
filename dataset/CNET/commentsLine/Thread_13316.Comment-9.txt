the hsf is definitely clamped securely to the cpu, and the mobo is a micro atx, but like you suggested, it might not be the mobo and i should try out other things 1st i'm not sure what thermal compound is but there was a sticky-ish white residue both on the hsf base and cpu surface... what does that mean?
i'm sure that the orientation of both the cpu and hsf is fine, since there is only one way they can fit.
that blowhole idea looked interesting... scary but interesting!
