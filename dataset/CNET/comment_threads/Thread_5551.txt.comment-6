One of our laptop users made the mistake of leaving his USB floppy drive locked in a drawer in his locked office where anyone could get at it.
So I borrowed it for a little while to test the handling of USB booting.
I disconnected all internal drives and was able to boot successfully right off the bat.
So I'm pretty hopeful that it'll work.
Thanks for your input.
