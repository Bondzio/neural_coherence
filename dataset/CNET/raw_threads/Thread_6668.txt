The 2 will work great together and the color on yours will be almost exactly like another Apple setup. For color correctness you'll get the Pantone Spyder if you are truly serious about that. Bob

I realize Apple's monitor is one of the best choices but it's a bit too expensive to me (I'm planning to buy 3 monitors). So I'm searching for some other options with good performance at more reasonable cost. Thx anyway!!

9600	4	193838	2096917	2093027	ppane	7/28/06 3:36 AM	1.15405776E12	i would recommend the VX2025wm viewsonic's 20.1&quot; display	for quality, price and design the VX2025wm is the most recommended for you. take a look ate their site and enjoy. XD I was about to get one 32&quot; LCD but the resolution for those is so small... instead of gain you lose workspace... 1280x768... bah! better to have a 23&quot; max.

Sure, they're pricey, but they are great! Two of the three choices of their monitors also work with Windows-based PC's too (provided you have the right type of video card). If you want to choose something other than Apple, then I would recommend Viewsonic's Pro Series. There are 3 series that Viewsonic puts out and there is a difference in how well they perform -- so pay attention to the little VX, VA, etc. in front of the model numbers. VA is the value series... VX is the pro series. They, too, are pricey, but well worth it if you are a pro graphics person. Lastly, Samsung makes a pro series as well... again the same notes apply as above. For the most part, the pro type series of monitors are not going to be available at most stores. So, I recommend starting at each manufacturers' web site to get the choices/specs, etc., and then do some comparitive shopping online. Good luck! Maggie B

Check out toms hardware page for recommendations. http://www.tomshardware.com/2006/03/27/the_spring_2006_lcd_collection/ I bought the viewsonic VP191b and have been very happy with it.

My son has used autocad with it. His friend bought one earlier this year, and plays Oblivion and Doom, with great graphics. Based off of our 18&quot; LCD's, I bet their 20 & 21's, will be just as good.

Going to be used by a graphic artist and my price range is similar at around 400-600. Read about the viewsonic and it seems like a good option. Also saw the HP f2105. Anyone have any thoughts on this? This is for a PC not a mac, otherwise I would likely stretch and get the Apple display. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
