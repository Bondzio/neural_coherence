9603	0	1575	18290	NR	olympiamike	11/1/03 1:36 PM	1.06769376E12	No signal to monitor	I installed a new 40GB HDD and attempted to install XP. The XP CD didn't start so I changed the BIOS to load from the CD first. When I restarted my monitor says no signal received and nothing works. I tried a boot disk (floppy) with the same results. Any ideas? Thanks

You said you were able to boot into the BIOS to change the boot sequence to CD-ROM? So the screen wasn't blank right? Just recheck your video card and all cables inside the PC and try again.

There was a small amount of activity on the CD drive, the screen went blank and it been like that for 15 minutes. What do I try next? Thanks
