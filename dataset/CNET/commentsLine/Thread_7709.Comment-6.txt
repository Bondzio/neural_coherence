&quot;we only lose what we didn't backup.&quot; we have long discussions about backup in these forums.
my backup routine is pretty simple.
i copy out to an external usb drive, then to a sftp server, then to a new snazzy 8gb memory stick (just the items i can't lose) and occasional to dvdr (about 6).
anyone that won't backup has set the value of their files?
