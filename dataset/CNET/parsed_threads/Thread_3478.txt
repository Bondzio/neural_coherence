<s> I just tried to connect 2 laptops (Windows XP) with communications cables. </s>
<s> Each cable plugged into a USB port on the laptops. </s>
<s> The cables connected to USB to serial converters. </s>
<s> The computers indicated that the cables were connected to com ports. </s>
<s> This setup had been working, but I upgraded some software and I think that some settings got overwritten. </s>
<s> I kept getting messages that the computers were not connecting. </s>
<s> What should I do? </s>
<s> Any help would be great. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Can you share the manual or web site you used to setup connections via these serial ports? </s>
<s> I didn't set it up. </s>
<s> I don't know what manual or website was used. </s>
<s> Sorry. </s>
<s> Move to something standard? </s>
<s> Maybe you can tell more about why serial RS-232 USB adapters were used? </s>
<s> What does this do for you? </s>

<s> I think the software required it. </s>
<s> The system is dedicated to this software. </s>
<s> Since the previous version of this software was working, and the software upgrade process said nothing about changing the hardware, I would like to leave the hardware in place. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Contacting the software maker or those that set this up. </s>
<s> Your posts do not contain details needed to begin a discussion on this. </s>
<s> Good luck, Bob </s>
