naysayers who post problems with pm on winxp on m$'s forums doesn't necessary imply that no1 has been able to get it to work (or does it?).
i'd imagine ppl have gotten it work just fine (excluding even the users on this board) but never bothered posting there.
i could've sworn there was a way to create partitions using the default winxp tools.
i guess it's only to delete partition
