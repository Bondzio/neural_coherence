decided i didn't want to wait.
the guy that owns the store told me he'd eat the card if far cry didn't play well.
first the good news.
took 10 mins to install card, nvidia drivers and os picked up card right away.
fired up far cry, beautiful graphics.
now the bad news.
i had to of course pull all the cables out to get inside my tower.
i've now lost the use of my usb hub, which also means i can't use any attached peripherals, including my wireless keyboard.
the ps/2 kb works for everything except the game!
(you called it, art).
i ran into this problem once before, and ed o'daniel suggested a fix for me, but i can't remember what the heck it is.
guess it's google time....will let ya know how it goes....::sigh::::
