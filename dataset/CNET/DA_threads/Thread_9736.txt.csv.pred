1.3.1	... yes , listen to profitt ... borrow someones keyboard , or try one u have.Allways solve a problem by starting with the obvious.If the problem remains , see step two ( whatever that is ) I 've had similar problems , and a new mouse or keyboard solved it.I just spent hours trying to figure out a mouse pointer glitch ... the thing would freeze every 10 seconds or so ... .it seemed like a software issue ... it was n't ... .the mouse was bad .

1.4.1	It 's not the plastic keys but what 's underneath them .	St
1.4.2	http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_keyboard Typically , the ones you use most go first .	St
1.4.3	You 're flexing the domes on the top layer of the keyboard .	St
1.4.4	They 're supposed to pop back into position but they get weaker with age and use .	St
1.4.5	Eventually they do n't return to proper shape and the electrical contacts stay closed ... or open ... whatever the case may be .	St
1.4.6	You do n't fix these but you replace them .	St
1.4.7	You can get very good keyboards made for heavy use .	St
1.4.8	If you 're interested , you can try those made in Germany by Cherry .	St
1.4.9	I 've got one ... very nice but has a feel that some wo n't like .	St
