1.1.1	I have just started building systems for enthusiasts and every day users .	St
1.1.2	The average is one syetm a day basing upon different specs.The one thing my clients require is a full system recovery option ( one button recovery solution ) I would like to do the following : - Create a samll partition on my hard drive for drive image and be able to hide it as well .	St
1.1.3	- After fully installing and optimizing Windows XP Pro alongwith system drivers create a full-system image ( like the OEMs ) - Be able to access the image upon boot ( like that one-button recovery stuff used by OEMs ) whenever I want to resort to a full system restore .	St
1.1.4	- Also , please advise me on which software should I be using for this purpose which should be reliable and professional .	Sug
1.1.5	Help will be appreciated !	St
1.1.6	!	St
1.2.1	I only need to listen ( or read ) to compalints about hard disk based backup failures to learn that such is an ok idea for a spare or fast copy but is too unreliable to be called professional .	St
1.2.2	Maybe some bootable CD with an image would work .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	This is something you , me and few others may understand but most people like the idea of & quot ; one-button recovery with no-disks-to-lose solution & quot ; and probably dont consider the CONS .	St
1.3.2	I initially gave them the idea of a single DVD-ROM based recovery solution and I think I 'll press on with it .	St
1.3.3	So whats your advice on this one ?	Ques
1.3.4	?	Ques
1.4.1	The restore CD I taped inside the case .	St
1.4.2	It 's never lost unless they lose it .	St
1.4.3	As such , it 's never an issue if they have to pay up for it .	St
1.4.4	- & gt ; Such restore systems are not free unless you are a programmer .	St
1.4.5	Most will pay homage to Acronis or another company to add in such a feature .	St
1.4.6	Are you a programmer ?	Ques
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	I was n't one but I thin i 'll have to start off with something .	St
1.5.2	Just integration .	St
1.5.3	How about Norton Ghost 9.0 ?	Ques
1.5.4	What do you think ?	Ques
1.6.1	Have you asked them for the numbers ?	Ques
1.6.2	It 's a shocker .	St
1.6.3	Linux images are a fav but I ca n't teach that here .	St
1.6.4	It 's a trick of linux and it 's fdisk , dd and maybe gzip .	St
1.6.5	When it works it 's a great thing and the price is time to make it work .	St
1.6.6	http : //www.dantz.com/en/products/express.dtml is another software I find on some laptops and more of those external USB drives for restoring an image .	St
1.6.7	Again , you pay for such a priviledge .	St
1.7.1	Well , to my experience True Image is excellent for making a backup image of OS .	St
1.7.2	I always use it , and I think it 'll completely satisfy your requirements .	St
1.7.3	You could create a small hidden partition ( called Secure Zone - because of its inaccessibility to any other software ) for strongly compressed drive image and further incremental backups .	St
1.7.4	After fully installing and optimizing Windows , drivers create a full-system image .	St
1.7.5	You 'll be able to access the image upon boot , whenever you want to resort to a full system restore .	St
1.7.6	But I think the best way to make sure in it to read review about most popular backup software .	St
1.7.7	reviews.cnet.com	St
1.8.1	This is quite relevant to my requirements .	St
