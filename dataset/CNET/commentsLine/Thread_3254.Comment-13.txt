jeff, did you ever solve your temp problem (or figure out if it is a problem)..i have a similar gateway system..same processor, different mb i think gt5436..and noticed i'm getting 92.42 on the ich....wondered if it was cause for concern..my cpu is 56.18 at near idle...wondered if that was ok..have you seen any links with more definitive acceptable temperatures?
thanks
