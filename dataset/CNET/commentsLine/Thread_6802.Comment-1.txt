i am looking to buy a bluetooth device that can be connected to a desktop computer and used to send out text messages and multimedia to cell phones within a range of 500 meters or more.
i am not familiar with this type of technology, so i'm not sure what type of device i need to purchase or where i could purchase it.
any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.
