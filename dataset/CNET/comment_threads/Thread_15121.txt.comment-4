Didn't play on mixed mode.
The printer only showed up in 802.11g mode at the router.
Truly a Mossberg 930 target.
The software was no better.
So even after getting it to work, HP's support was not there so back to USB connections for quite a long time.
The printer is now history and I went to another make for awhile.
