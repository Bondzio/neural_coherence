Anyone know of a wireless router that can be configured remotely (either with a web interface or a telnet interface).
I am setting up a wireless network, but I will not be on-site most of the time.
I want to use MAC address filtering, but I want to be able to filter MAC addresses remotely.
I have the Microsoft g-router, and it doesn't support logging in remotely.
Does anyone know of a wireless g-router that supports remote administration?
Thanks
