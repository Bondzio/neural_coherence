It has wireless built in, but I've been told by a friend that I could get better wireless with an Orinoco PC Wireless card. My question is, can I still use this pc card if I already have wireless built in. Wouldn't it mess things up a bit? Thank you all. Geoff.

How big could the PC card antenna be? 2.) Better as compared to what? Wireless B, G, and N have limits that cannot be surpassed. 3.) Go ahead and buy it and try it but make sure you can return it if (when) you don't see any difference.
