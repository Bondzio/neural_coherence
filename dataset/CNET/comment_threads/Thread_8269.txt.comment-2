Has been the problem.
HP was going to release a very nice 11&quot; tablet with lots of USB ports + more that would run on Window7 Pro but after testing they found out that Win7 was just not 100% ready to run a tablet & they are now looking into Android O/S, so that has been push back to late Fall of this year, that is if testing goes good.
No one is going to make a dent into iPad sales until someone can make a tablet that runs on Windows 7 Pro or Ultiment with out problems, with good battery life & a competitive price to the iPad but by then the iPad gen 2 will be out, maybe even iPad gen 3.
It is going to be sometime.
Dell has their little 5&quot; Andrioid thing, I do not consider it a tablet... just too small, more for a phone size then tablet.
