<s> I was hoping someone could give me some advice on upgrading memory. </s>
<s> I hate to ask what might be a basic question but I also don't want to either buy the incorrect or best option for memory. </s>
<s> I am looking to upgrade my pc to I THINK 4gb of RAM. </s>
<s> I currently have a HP m7248n with 1 mb of ram. </s>
<s> More specifically acording to the stats I have 2 X 512/ 184 pin, DDR SDRAM. </s>
<s> The PC has a Athlon 64 X2 (M) 4200 2.2 GHz processor and I am running Windows XP Media center edition ver 2002 service pack 2. </s>
<s> I also believe I have 4 slots for memory (2 in use, 2 available). </s>
<s> I have included a link to the HP web site with my model below if I left out any additional information. </s>
<s> In regards to use, I am not a huge power user except for the fact I burn a lot of DVDs of home movies. </s>
<s> Also burn cd's, listen to music, transfer songs to mp3. </s>
<s> I also do a LOT of uploading photos etc. </s>
<s> (dad of 3 kids basically). </s>
<s> I don't do gaming really at all, so beyond the power intensive dvd rendering and other items above my use ends up mainly limited to internet etc. </s>
<s> here are my questions: 1) Right off the bat, what kind of memory should I get? </s>
<s> When I did a QUICK look I saw options such as 800 MHz DDR2, 1333 MHz DDR3 etc. </s>
<s> I know what memory is in general, but get lost on the DDR2 vs DDR3 etc 2) If I have 4 slots open, and am interested in 4 gb, can I actually buy 2 2 GB cards and keep my existing 2 and actually end up with 5 gb? </s>
<s> or am I better off yanking what i have and just putting in the 2 2 gb (or maybe 4 1 gb if the cost make more sense) I hope I provided enough info and made my questions clear. </s>
<s> If not scold me, I have a thick skin, then tell me what else you need to know. </s>
<s> Also I am fairly comfortable with opening the system, removing the memory I have, putting new in etc - I have done that before, it is not a matter of how to but what I need. </s>
<s> thanks thanks thanks in advance agian, if needed, additional link to PC model with technical stats: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c00511049&cc=us&dlc=en&lc=en&jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN </s>
<s> 2.25GB RAM. </s>
<s> So why go much over 2G? </s>
<s> www.crucial.com has your model listed so stick to that and you'll be fine. </s>
<s> But I don't expect more than 2 per cent speed gains on anything you said you are doing. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> just for clarification: are you saying if I go from 1gb to 2gb I won't get much more than a 2% or so improvement? </s>
<s> Or that if I go much beyond 2gb I won't get much more? </s>
<s> In regards to what I am doing, yes I should of been more clear. </s>
<s> For the basics I don't have any issues at all - email, internet, excel and word stuff etc. </s>
<s> The ONLY reason I am thinking about a bump up is when I go to download either a huge number of photos and edit them or when I am creating DVDs. </s>
<s> I know the additional memory may not actually cause the burn of the dvd to occur faster, nor do I care that much - I run it before I head to bed. </s>
<s> But the editing, dumoing of a lot of video, comes to a crawl at times. </s>
<s> I figured especially if I only do about 2gb for $50.00 if it helped it would be worth it. </s>
<s> so given that, sorry for the additional question but do you think at least bumping to 2gb would help? </s>
<s> and if so are you saying that might but then beyond 2gb is just overkill, especially with an older processor etc. </s>
<s> thanks again for your help </s>
<s> It was XP with 2 identical machines. </s>
<s> The DVD render took 6 hours on the machine with 512MB RAM. </s>
<s> The 1GB machine did it 5 minutes faster. </s>
<s> We couldn't believe the results so we swapped RAM and re-ran the tests. </s>
<s> Same results. </s>
<s> You are asking for speed so this is not where to get it as you are already at 1GB and have XP (not Vista which would change my answer.) </s>
