i'm not sure what you are trying to do.
do you want msconfig in win2k.
the dirty secret is that xp's msconfig does work in win2k but do so at your own risk.
you can copy the executable from xp and drop it in the appropriate win2k folder and make your own shortcut.
i'm not certain, however, that win2k's &quot;expand&quot; can extract the file from an xp installation cd.
