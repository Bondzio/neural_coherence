<s> As for your problem of recovery CD, usually most recovery CDs say so and include thier orgin like from Dell, HP, Gateway, etc as the OEM source. </s>
<s> A true OS full/upgrade version will have MS all over it and state it. </s>
<s> If you have an OEM OS version, it has to be loaded to that maker's type of system otherwise it just won't work. </s>
<s> Plus, of course you need the &quot;product key&quot; to validate its loading, etc.. Hopefully, this answers your question, if not please explain further your query. </s>

<s> Can I delete windows 98 from my computer and reinstall with a windows 98 CD if I don't have a recovery CD? </s>
<s> You can install a &quot;full version&quot; or &quot;upgrade&quot; version of win98 that's MS supplied, it's not an OEM version. </s>
<s> As I mentioned before, those versions will install. </s>
<s> You will still need to have the &quot;drivers&quot; and fetch them either from the makers support website or any of the driver websites for the products/devices currently installed on your system. </s>
<s> That's the best part of a recovery/restore OS, it will return your system to what it was the day it was build. </s>
<s> Thus, if you use a MS win98 version you now have to get those drivers. </s>
<s> Most important is the mtrbd. </s>
<s> drivers and then later the video, audio, etc. </s>
<s> drivers. </s>
<s> Does this make sense? </s>
<s> If not, then google for OS install for win98 or if you have some Dell, HP, etc. </s>
<s> OEM system they can also prodicve the drivers, they WILL NOT any win9x recovery/restore disks as they dropped that support for those older OSes. </s>
<s> You can try eBay for a vendor of a OS, just be sure to check their creds. </s>

<s> if you only post in one forum.That way every one can keep abreast of the advice already given.If you follow the instructions given in your other post [url] http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6122-0.html?forumID=44&threadID=168391&messageID=1863534 [/URL] you should be able to reinstall WIN98 fairly easily. </s>
<s> I would first try Kees suggestion to extract the file you need from thr WIN98 disc. </s>
