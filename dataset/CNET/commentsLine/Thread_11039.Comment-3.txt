you said you solved it but didn't mention how.
that might be the best clue you could offer to get an answer.
any such will be speculative.
a corrupt driver, something in the bios that's changed, even an automatic driver update that happened without your knowing, if it was the wrong driver, could cause this.
you could look for a clue in start/settings/network connections and see if the name is different.
it might say something like &quot;local area connection2&quot; rather than &quot;local area connection&quot;.
