Over at www.pcpowerandcooling.com you can find PDF documents with exact dimensions of what I will call &quot;standard size&quot; ATX power supplies.
While I've grown familiar with these to the point I can just look at the PSU then check the connections a new technician will need such a document and learn what the ATX, ATX12V and other power connections are as well as determine if the replacement supply has enough of each connection.
One owner spent a year seeking out a PSU because they couldn't find &quot;the right one.&quot; They were looking for one with exactly the right number of power connections but imagine them passing up unit after unit because it has &quot;too many&quot; power connections.
Hopefully this won't stop you.
Tell me how it turns out.
