<s> I'm trying to figure out what is wrong with my grandfather's PC. </s>
<s> It's an AMD 1.2 Ghz w/ 256MB ram and a 40GB drive. </s>
<s> On powerup the computer does absolutely nothing. </s>
<s> Nothing appears on screen... </s>
<s> The hard drive light doesn't blink, the PC appears to be frozen. </s>
<s> What I have done so far: Tried HD on another PC - works fine Tried working monitor on this PC - still no image replaced 420W power supply - still no system response I am not sure what else to check... RAM, motherboard, CPU? </s>
<s> The CPU fan is spinning on powerup. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> This is typical of machines with the epidemic motherboard capacitor issue. </s>
<s> Such machines exhibit this &quot;hard starting&quot; issue. </s>
<s> (or non-starting.) </s>
<s> Here's an article with pictures for you to check your motherboard for this issue -&gt; http://www.pcstats.com/articleview.cfm?articleID=195 The other repeating problem source are PCs with too small power supplies. </s>
<s> While the machine may work fine for months, eventually the &quot;just big enough&quot; power supply starts to age and the symptom is one like yours. </s>
<s> I'll supply an article about how to select the size and then another about how they lie about the rated size. </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/ http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20021021/ The too small power supply can accelerate the capacitor issue. </s>
<s> To dive in deeper, remove all cards, memory, IDE cables and see if it BEEPS in protest. </s>
<s> If not, you are looking at the possible bad parts. </s>
<s> Even the CMOS battery is suspect. </s>
