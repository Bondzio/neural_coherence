<s> I bought a new p4 socket 478. </s>
<s> Now when im trying to remove my old celeron 2.4 socket 478 from my asrock p4vm8 mobo, the celeron cpu won't come out. </s>
<s> I pulled that stick up all the way, but i won't budge. </s>
<s> Should i use like a knife to pry it out, cause im afraid that i might damage the celeron cpu with the knife. </s>
<s> So any idea's on how to get the old celeron cpu out? </s>
<s> to say take it easy, take it slow. </s>
<s> the HSF from the CPU??? </s>
<s> If so, you should simply gently twist [rotate] the HSF back and forth a few times. </s>
<s> That'll usually break the bond between the HSF and CPU caused by the thermal compound. </s>
<s> If you are lifting up with the ZIF lever still in the down/locked position you may cause real problems. </s>
<s> I lifted up the lever and tried pulling it out, but it wont budge. </s>
<s> Im not talking about the heat sink fan. </s>
<s> to pry against ... use something like a wooden pencil or a popsicle stick..something small enough you can use to protect the MB. </s>
<s> Just to cover the &quot;not always obvious&quot;: Is CPU fan and heatsink unfastened from the motherboard? </s>
<s> lever, fully up should make it totally free, [as you know]. </s>
<s> Tough to imagine how any adhesive type material could be there and still have the CPU work. </s>
<s> Maybe someone really grossly overdid the thermal compound. </s>
<s> Please be sure to tell us what you find. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> i contacted the motherboard company and they said that the cpu might of overheated and melted the pins to the socket. </s>
