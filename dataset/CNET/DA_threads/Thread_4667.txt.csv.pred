1.1.1	Hi, I am planning on getting a new video card, since my old Nvidia Geforce FX 5200 is fried after I overclocked it, and I'm wondering if anyone can tell me if a Nvidia Geforce FX 5700VE is a killer card for gaming.	St
1.1.2	I mean, if it is, would it be better than a 5700LE or a 5700 Ultra.	St
1.1.3	By the way, the card is PNY brand.	St
1.2.1	an FX 5700VE and no, it wouldn't be a killer card for gaming consider something like a GeForce 6600GT or maybe a 6800nU...if you have the cash for it i'd avoid Radeon X series, with the exception of RAdeon X1800, but that's REALLY EXPENSIVE vs the performance it offers	St
1.3.1	and capability.	St
1.3.2	I'm pretty well pleased with my GeForce 6200TC.	St
1.3.3	I just gave 47 dollars for it at Newegg and am surprised how well it plays games.	St
1.3.4	But, of course, how well any card plays depends greatly on system specs.	St
1.3.5	A 5700 Ultra is generally much costlier than the cards of the same number and if you are going to spend $120 to $160 or so, I certainly look at a GeForce 6600GT.	St
1.4.1	Now I know that 6600GT and 6800 are way better than my 5700VE, but they are overpriced!	St
1.4.2	I am looking for something that costs like 5700VE, around 120-140 bucks, but couldn't find 6600GT or 6800 video cards with these prices anywhere!	St
1.5.1	but if cant afford try going for a vanilla 6600. it is just a tad bit slower than the 6600gt and is much better than the 5200 so u should see an improvement.	St
1.6.1	You said you have about 140 so get the geforce 6600gt from newegg.	St
1.6.2	You will not regret it unless your'e looking forward to playing games with 1434 fps with outstainding ultra maximum anti aliasing.	St
1.6.3	Oh and make sure your power supply is good.	St
1.6.4	I've heard people say not enough power supply and the old power supply might die.	St
