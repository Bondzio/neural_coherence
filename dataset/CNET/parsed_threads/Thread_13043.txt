<s> I have a fairly new computer (close to 2 years) and I want to upgrade my processor. </s>
<s> I just hope this is the only thing I have to upgrade, heh. </s>
<s> I'm not sure what will affect what. </s>
<s> My current setup is: Athlon 1800+(or 1700 I forget, how can I check?) </s>
<s> Gigabyte Athlon/Duron compatible motherboard PNY Geforce 4 4400 256 MB RAM 400 Watt Antec Power Supply Creative Audigy Soundcard Windows 98SE I want to upgrade the processor and RAM. </s>
<s> Is it possible for me to install 2200/2400 AMD on the same motherboard? </s>
<s> And is another 256 of memory not over-doing it? </s>
<s> I know I have enough memory slots? </s>
<s> Thanks for any help recieved. </s>
<s> PS. </s>
<s> Cheapest place to buy hardware/cases? </s>
<s> It's this simple... 1. </s>
<s> Find the make/model of your &quot;Gigabyte Athlon/Duron compatible motherboard&quot;, go to the web site and check out their manuals or web pages on that motherboard to see what CPU's will fit. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> 256 is usually enough, but gamers will want the 512MB for 98. </s>
<s> Be aware that this will not increase the fixed space 64 thousand byte memory pools called RESOURCES. </s>
<s> The MEMORY ARTICLE at http://www.aumha.org/articles.htm will tell you about that. </s>

<s> Visit the mtrbd. </s>
<s> support website for two things; the latest tech. </s>
<s> specs. </s>
<s> and any bios updates which should allow the greatest selection for the newer cpus. </s>
<s> As for memory, that should be a easy one, just buy the same type of ram module and install, that is unless you got some weird setup. </s>
<s> Offhand, i say you can upgrade the cpu at least to AMD2200-XP type. </s>
<s> Again, the bios update *may* allow better cpu installs. </s>
<s> etc. </s>
<s> just be sure to know what any bios update does. </s>
<s> Always backup before the update and follow the instructions exactly, you have 1-chance to succeed. </s>
<s> Also, use the manual bios update process, don't try the &quot;online&quot; process its more open to possible glitches. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
