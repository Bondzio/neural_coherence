the issue i think you might have hit on the early ssd drives was the controller issues with space not being returned when you delete files.
i think i said this in another post.
if you delete a 40 gb file (for example) you expect to have an additional 40 gb of free space.
windows will tell you that you have 40 gb of extra space.
but then, you suddenly run out of space becuase, although windows says you have space, the drive does not release/re-use it.
i had this problem with someone's laptop and kept telling the user that he was out of space when he said he had plenty.
the 65 gb drive ran like cr6p when he turned it back in.
i loaded the latest firmware and now it runs like a champ.
this was a problem only with older drives so, if anyone sees some problem like this, with a major slowdown issue, my suggestion is to upgrade the firmware from the manufacturers (drive mfg) website.
i'd go out and give it another try.
