<s> Forum Users, We have a small workroom being shared by approximately 10 people that has a HP printer located in the room that we all have to walk over to and hook up via a USB port and I was wondering that equipment or configuration I need to set the printer up to be wireless for everyone in the room. </s>
<s> The room is approximately 25ft x 25ft and the printer is currently not a wireless enabled printer. </s>
<s> So I'm looking for some device that I can connect to the printer via it's network port and then broadcast an IP address or something that everyone in the room can connect to and print. </s>
<s> I'm not sure if a print server solution works with this volume of resources (10) trying to connect and print concurrently or otherwise. </s>
<s> Appreciate everyones response, J.C. </s>
<s> To set it up we have some dozen choices so where we go depends on how techy you and they are. </s>
<s> I think BLUETOOTH may have the easy edge here. </s>
<s> Get a printer with that. </s>
<s> Next up is wifi but this requires a WAP, some printer server or if some other non-WAP solution the troubles of AD-HOC WIFI may mean you spend more time showing dozens of folk how to setup WIFI AD-HOC and would be a non-solution. </s>
<s> So, what's the skill level and how thick is the IT staffer's skin? </s>

<s> Bob, All of us in the room are fairly techie. </s>
<s> So we can generally handle anything techie in nature. </s>
<s> The challenge is taking the standalone printer that is not wireless, in essence converting it to a wireless device and then having the capability to have 10 people connect and print to it. </s>
<s> So my assumption is if we due a bluetooth solution, then we are forced into buying some number if not 10 slave PC USB bluetooth devices for each individual in the room. </s>
<s> So while capabable, I assume this may be expensive? </s>
<s> So my assumption is that it would have to be something like a wifi or other solution to reduce the individual PC/user cost element? </s>
<s> Thanks again, J.C. </s>
<s> Example at http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=PD-BD10&cat=NET and has been spotted for 3 bucks. </s>
<s> Let's see if there is a wifi ad-hoc print server? </s>
<s> http://www.airlink101.com/products/amps240w.php Page 19 of http://www.airlink101.com/download/download_links/m-amps240w.pdf shows it supports AD-HOC mode so this can be used outside of your normal WAP or Infrastructure mode. </s>
<s> That runs about 30ish around the web. </s>
