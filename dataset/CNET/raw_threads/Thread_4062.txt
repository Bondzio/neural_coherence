The computer we have shouldn't get that hot anyways.. so should i use plastic replace the metal bracket that is too small?

Metal (any type) comes with &quot;extra skill required&quot; but FOIL gives me a bad feeling as it could fall into the machine. Yes I've headed to the shop to make a new custom bracket when needed. It's just sheet metal so tin snips and a drill press then some creative bending was all that was ever needed. Plastic could be the easy and safe fix. Bob
