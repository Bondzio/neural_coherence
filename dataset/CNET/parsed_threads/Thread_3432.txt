<s> I have just recently bought a Samsung LCD 713N (17&quot;) monitor... My pc specs are Galaxy Nvidia 6600GT, 1 GB ram. </s>
<s> I just want to know is there way to configure a lcd screen because I look at the displaying lcd it is more lively, but for mine it just like a usual flat panel monitor except u can look from whatever angle.. or maybe it's just my illusion... thanks... </s>
<s> There should be an on-screen setting thing, but not sure, don't know about that model. </s>
<s> If not, should be some software included to tweak. </s>
<s> If nothing, well maybe its your eyes. </s>
<s> Lots of ppl like samsung lcds. </s>
