12390	0	93543	1057410	NR	jordie24	3/19/05 10:46 PM	1.11127236E12	More network questions	I have a host pc with DSL and a new Linksys wireless router for a brand new hp ze2000 notebook. I can get either to recognize one another. I get an icon on the desktop for 'notebook' but no ability to share files or printers. I have tried many times unsucessfully to add a home network to no avail. On the notebook it says that the Ethernet card/cable is not connected when it is. Both units (including the wireless notebook) work perfectly with IE but just don't communicate. Any help would be appreciated.
