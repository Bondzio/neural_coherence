well ted, in my opinion a external hard drive have a period life (between 5 to 7 years average according to my experience and use)depending some things like: type of work, carefully handling, etc.
these units are most expensive than internal and they be handling very carefully, because are external is most expose to a injury that decreases xtreme hot or humidity, bad storage of unit, hard movements, etc.
(your constantly use may decrease the utility life) , in other way is most confiable and capable than the cd`s or dvd`s.
in that case ted, depending cost you should buy another external dispositive like a flash memory.
in my opinion, actually is more secure and confiable.
in the market are differents options available (until 256gb) to your work.
