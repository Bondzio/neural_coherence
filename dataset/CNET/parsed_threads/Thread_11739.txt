<s> Last night I went to download the update for WoW. </s>
<s> Anyway, my hard drive and fan seemed to be spinning very high. </s>
<s> Towards the end of the download, I heard a &quot;whirring&quot; or &quot;whistling&quot; sound, which sort of faded in, got a little loud, and then faded out. </s>
<s> It did it about 3 different times, but hasn't done it since. </s>
<s> Is this an indication that something is wrong with my hard drive? </s>
<s> Or could it have been the cooling fan? </s>
<s> My first hard drive that crashed would give me a clicking sound, but this was a high-pitched whirr or whistle. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> You need to remove side cover of system case and follow your ear. </s>
<s> Locate the source and proceed from there. </s>
<s> Fans typically are the source of much noise or new source of noise as they fail. </s>
<s> Observe the fans(any fan)for inbtermit operation. </s>
<s> A good cleaning helps as always if not done in awhile. </s>
<s> For the most part, HD omit a constant noise or lack of one(very quiet), so don't jump too quickly on a failing HD, but if apparent *backup* as a safety precaution ASAP, regardless. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Maybe,drive is about to go! </s>
