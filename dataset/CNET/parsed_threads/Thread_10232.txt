<s> My notebook PC has just 2 GB of Harddisk space. </s>
<s> So if I were to rip a 8GB movie (non copyrighted) from a DVD onto my computer and then burn it onto a writable DVD that would obviously not work since my PC has just 2 GB of space. </s>
<s> So other than the option of adding additional hard drive to my notebook PC, can I rip only sections of the DVD movie (like say 15 minutes at a time) onto the harddisk, burn it to a DVD, delete that file, rip the next 15 minutes, burn it onto the writable DVD and so on. </s>
<s> Let me know if it is possible. </s>
<s> Your advise would be greatly appreciated thanks </s>
<s> It's the cheap fix. </s>
