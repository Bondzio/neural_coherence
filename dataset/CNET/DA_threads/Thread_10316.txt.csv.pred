1.2.1	Those terms do get confusing.	St
1.2.2	IDE, is the same as EIDE/PATA/ATAPI interface.	St
1.2.3	Beware, your DVD writer will need s/w to burn any CDs or DVDs which may or may not be included with your DVD package.	St
1.2.4	I also suggest you place the DVD on the 2nd IDE port a nd be sure if you have a CD drive already install that you &quot;jumper&quot; for correct install under master/slave setup.	St
