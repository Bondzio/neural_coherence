1.1.2	I was thinking of setting up a wireless print server and hooking up a printer .	St
1.1.3	My desktop does n't have wireless , Is it possible to use my wireless router to connect to a wireless print server ?	Ques
1.1.4	thanks	Polite
1.2.1	But as you can imagine support , that is the makers that sell you such devices are not all that helpful .	St
1.2.2	Let me share that if you try and fail it 's not because it wo n't work but usually because of firewalls or other issues .	St
1.2.3	Follow the directions , learn your firewalls and be ready to pack and return in the number of days the vendor gives you .	St
1.2.4	Do n't waste months trying to get it to work .	St
1.2.5	Do not accept it if you ca n't make it work in one day .	St
