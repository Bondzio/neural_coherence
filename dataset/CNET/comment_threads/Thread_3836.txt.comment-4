The chipset drivers.
Notice the first 3 drivers are all about that at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7587_102-0.html?forumID=69&threadID=271360&messageID=2699006#2699006 If you can supply the make, model of the mainboard I might find these.
Also, my kids older machine continued to reboot oddly (rarely) for months until I figured out it was the audio driver.
You can test for that by disabling the onboard sound.
One last thing.
Did you refresh the CPU heatsink &quot;compound&quot;?
I would.
