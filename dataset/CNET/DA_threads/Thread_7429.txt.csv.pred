1.1.1	Hi - I purchased the Netgear 54 Mbps Wireless Router ( WGR614 ) .	St
1.1.2	I have no idea what to do now .	St
1.1.3	If I set it up in my basement , will it work upstairs ?	Ques
1.1.4	Will my laptop need a special card ?	Ques
1.2.1	without knowing what type of computers will be accessing the router , if they have wired or wireless adapters , what operating systems and what type of Internet connections you are using , all is guess work .	St
1.3.1	I also have a wired router , which I am using now - I have wires going to all of my computers ( 3 ) .	St
1.3.2	Can I hook the wireless router to the wired one and still use the wired one , and just use the wireless router for my laptop ?	Ques
1.4.1	Think of the broadcast range of the wireless router as a big bubble with the router in its center .	St
1.4.2	You will likely find that you will maximize your wireless coverage if you place ther wireless router on the second floor , or maybe the first floor .	St
1.4.3	You can make a wired connection to the wireless router via a network cable .	St
1.4.4	This MUST be done for the initial setup of the router .	St
1.4.5	Any subsequent wireless connections will be from compouters that have WIRELESS NETWORK ADAAPTERS .	St
1.4.6	If a computer does n't have a wireless network adapter , you ca n't make a wireless network connection .	St
1.4.7	There are internal wireless network adapters and external adapters .	St
1.4.8	Most newer notebooks come with an internal wireless adapter .	St
1.5.1	This is a configuration that I would not suggest for a beginner to home networking .	St
1.5.2	Having two DHCP serving devices on the same network segment requires you to turn off that function on one usually the wired router so it serves as a switch only .	St
1.5.3	Look into your wired router 's setup page and jot down the settings .	St
1.5.4	Then replace it with the wireless router and duplicate those settings in it 's setup program .	St
1.5.5	Since you have not provided any more info as to your laptop 's hardware , I can offer no more advice on that .	Sug
