These seem no better or worse than all the lines from HP, Dell, Gateway and the Ford or Chevy PC makers.
What I do find is that Acer seems to have fair out of the box experiences and you can make a set of restore DVDs (and then copy those!)
then use the machine.
If you want reliable, get a toaster.
PCs are not very reliable... Bob
