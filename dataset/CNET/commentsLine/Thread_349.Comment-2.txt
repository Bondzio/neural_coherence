that's called a wireless bridge and the only mistake i see is that you may be attempting this with a wifi router.
if said router has bridge capability that's fine but imagine if it doesn't.
hint.
wireless bridge on google.com layout hint: lan -&gt; wireless bridge --- (air) --- wireless bridge -&gt; other lan.
