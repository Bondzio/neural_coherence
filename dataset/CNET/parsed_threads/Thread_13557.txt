<s> I have the extremely inexpensive CompUSA brand wireless broadband router. </s>
<s> After somewhat complicated setup, both desktop (wired) and laptop (wireless) have working internet access. </s>
<s> I then went through the wireless network wizard on the desktop in hopes of sharing desktop hard drive with laptop, and all went smoothly. </s>
<s> But, when I tried to find the shared desktop HDD while on the laptop, I couldn't find it under &quot;My Computer&quot; or &quot;my network places.&quot; Is it possible that the router is not capable of sharing the drive, or have I set-up the network poorly? </s>
<s> Any advice would be greatly appreciated. </s>

<s> It's a fine example of where details matter and when asked, the answers never seen to be answered. </s>
<s> Clues abound in this discussion. </s>
