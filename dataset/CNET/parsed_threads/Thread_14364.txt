<s> I'd like to remove the hard drive from my old PC and use it to store music and photos on my new PC. </s>
<s> I'm ok on taking the old drive out, but not sure how to connect it to the new PC. </s>
<s> And not sure what I need to do to the old one to make it usable stricly for storage! </s>
<s> Any advice would be greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> you intend on using the old drive for any length of time I would suggest you get and external harddrive case ($20-25). </s>
<s> Get one that has a fan. </s>
<s> Most online retailers have them. </s>
<s> You just plug it in a USB/Firewire port on your computer and an external harddrive ye shall make. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
