1.5.1	You STILL did n't mention your operating system , I am assuming it is an older system ( since your hook ups are ps-2 ) and likely running perhaps Win Xp .	St
1.5.2	If it has the capability have you tried using USB KYBD/MOUSE ?	Ques
1.5.3	This issue could also be created by a malware infection ( s ) there are several possibilities especially since it sounds as if you may be using this unit on a public network .	St
1.6.1	Since this keyboard does not work with the bios I would think you have a hardware problem .	St
1.6.2	Have you tried another keyboard ?	Ques
1.6.3	Just for yuks .	St
1.6.4	Disconnect the mouse ... ..speakers ... usb devices ... ... so that all you have left is the keyboard and monitor .	St
1.6.5	I 'm assuming this is a desktop .	St
1.6.6	Any difference when using the bios with the keyboard ?	Ques
