bob's answer is the most workable solution nowdays.
a dvd-rom will play either dvds or cds.
a dvd-rw will burn either dvds or cds.
by the way, bob, i have been happy with the btc (badged as emprex) 8x multi-format i got for $70 at fry's.
not the fastest out, but i'm not so busy i can't wait 20 more seconds.
i am curious why dvd media prices haven't really come down.
unless i'm missing something, they cost the same(pennies) to manufacture as cds.
