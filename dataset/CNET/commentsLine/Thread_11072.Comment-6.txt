i's really important to review the specs of the system via the manual or support website for latest.
you know the 478 scoket info and fsb, but there is a limit.
it *may* install the 3.0cpu but if no greater fsb selection it may stop at 2.4, it could support the 533 side but not the 800level.
one way to verify is to check dell's upgrade offering that they sell, if present, you have a definite answer.
systems like dell and other oems tend to play it safe, not to keep users in the fold, but to reduce end-user product installs and complaints.
so, if they offer an upgarde its a sure thing it will work.
check thier store to see what's offered.
