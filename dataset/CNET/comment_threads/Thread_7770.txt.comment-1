I have an older notebook and the hard drive is giving some problems.
I am considering buying an external USB portable hard drive and cloning the notebook drive to the ext.drive (bootable) before the drive totally fails.
I will mainly use the notebook for non HD TV streaming and older gaming where the increased drive speed may be helpful.
I thought the external drive could be used as a backup for my other notebook when the older notebook finally dies.
My older notebook has XP, 512 Mb RAM , Intel Pen-M 735 &amp; ATI Mobility Radeon 9600/9700.For a limited techie like me, when switching on the old computer how do I stop the computer using the old drive and use the external drive on a permanent basis ?
Would it be wise to remove the old drive?
Are there any other potential problems?Generally does increasing RAM improve effectiveness of TV streaming ?Many thanks for any help offered.
