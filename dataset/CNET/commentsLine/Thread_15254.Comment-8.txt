bob if you're still following this, i put my original question on another board at the same time as cnet.
a responder there wanted me to tell him my gateway ip (i assume he meant my default gateway), which i declined.
if i had sent that, is that enough info for someone to hack my lan, assuming i wasn't behind my hardware/software firewalls?
thanks again
