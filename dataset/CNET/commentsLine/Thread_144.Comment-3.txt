while wep and wpa encryption are not impenetrable with time, proper motivation, and expertise, i think the fact that users &quot;see&quot; the wireless network as being &quot;secured&quot; in the list of detected networks does help.
wep and wpa do require a user to enter a password, so i think that parasite wireless users will try the many &quot;unsecured&quot; networks first.
i recommend using at least one of them for homes that are in close proximity to other homes, condos, apartments, high traffic areas, etc.
