Hi, thanx for replying, I screwwed up by physically installing the pci adapter in my desktop 1st, not the software, (yeah I know I shoulda read all the directions 1st!, but was in such a rush to try our new cable hi-speed service!
), the device manager does show it & windows says it was installed but when I reboot my machine &quot;freezes&quot; up.
I have torestart in safe mode, unistalled & reinstalled couple of times, seems like a conflict some where?
!,using xp home w/sp2 on a p4 dell machine, I hope you can help, THANX
