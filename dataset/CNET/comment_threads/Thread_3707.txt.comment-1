System: Dell, Dimension 2400 - Windows 2000 In the bottom right hand corner of the screen, there was an icon (like that for the USB port -&quot;unplug or eject hardware&quot;) that was a picture if a camera (for my digital camera).
I clicked on it (like you would to stop the USB port) so I could unplug it.
I clicked on &quot;disable&quot;, I guess that was the wrong choice because now when I plug in my camera it doesn't recognize that there's anything there.
The icon for the USB port is there (&quot;unplug or eject hardware&quot;), but I can't access my G: drive (removable driver) from my computer or the desktop shortcut.
What do I to undo what I did!!!!!!!
Would greatly appreciate any help
