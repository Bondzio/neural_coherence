i just looked at my coputer, and it looks like the fan for my cpu blows into the heatsink aswell.... strange.
well, does this mean that the pci fan i talked about also sucks air in through the vent, and blows it into the computer?
if not, installing the fan would just give my new video card a harder time cooling the gpu's.
