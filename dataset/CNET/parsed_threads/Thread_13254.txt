<s> I have a problem with this safely remove hardware thing for quite a while and I heard that if I just ignore this and just plug the external HD out it will cause a corruption within the HD itself so I tried to remove the device safely from the system at all times. </s>
<s> But recently, when I'm done transferring files from my external HD to my computer and I close all the windows and safely removed the hardware an error message saying: &quot;The device 'Generic Volume' cannot be stopped right now. </s>
<s> Try stopping the device again later.&quot; I also have tried to go to some other drive first like my C: drive and then go to my documents files and close everything and refresh the whole dekstop and when I try again the error message appeared again! </s>
<s> I wonder howcome there's no program running but the HD can't be stopped. </s>
<s> Is there like any hidden program running at the background that I may not notice? </s>
<s> please help! </s>
<s> Some running program is feeding it data. </s>
<s> Could be a virus, but probably not. </s>
<s> Processes don't just stop immdeiately when you click on the X at right corner of a window. </s>
<s> You may want to wait a while. </s>
<s> If that doesn't work, just wank the thing off. </s>
<s> It won't cause any serious problems... err... usually... And what is with Generic Volumes? </s>
<s> Isn't there a driver or something? </s>
<s> o_O </s>
