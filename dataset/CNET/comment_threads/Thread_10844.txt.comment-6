and for bearing with me on this question.
I have already done a LOT of reading on this question, and have never understood anything I read.
I think I'm starting to understand it a tinsy bit better, except I'm still confused why people do so much talking about RE-formatting.
The way they talk, it makes me think it is something that I should be doing, however, after receiving your response, I guess it is actually something I should NOT be doing.
Thanks again for your help.
