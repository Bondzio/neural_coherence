i went through the same thing with my piii hp.
i ended up scrapping everything but the optical drives and keyboard.
you can get a new case for a little as $25, a motherboard/cbu combo deal for about $60, 512 mb memory sticks for $50, and an oem operating system for $80.
don't forget the power supply ($40) and cpu fan/heat sink ($20).
i'm quoting prices from memory, so i could be a tad off.
when you add it all up, you'd probably spend about as much as you would for one of walmart's boxed entry-level sets.
but what's the fun of that?
