my pc crashed (os windows xp home)and i want to retrieve data from the 80gb sata hd.
i have removed hd and inserted into a usb sata caddy enclosure.
i have connected caddy to my laptop (os vista) which displays as a local disk g. when i try to open it requests that i need to format the disk in drive g before i can use it, if i do this will i lose data,how can i access the data??
