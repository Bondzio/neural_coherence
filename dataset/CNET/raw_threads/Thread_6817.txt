The PC currently has two 512mb sticks and is running a bit slow, so I bought two 1gb sticks to help out. When I put them all in and turned the PC on, the machine seemed to be booting up (lights, fans and what not) but the monitor was staying asleep. I have tried the memory sticks in all manner of different combinations, as well as simply putting one of the new sticks in on its own, but with no luck. I suspected that the new memory must be dodgy, so I tried some memory from another PC which I knwo works, but the same problem occurred... am I overlooking something obvious here? The old memory: 2x 512mb DDR400 Ram (both manufactured by Crucial) The new memory: 2x 1gb DDR400 Ram (both manufactured by Samsung) The motherboard: GA-K8N Pro-SLI Hope I've given all the necessary info. Any ideas? Many thanks in advance Soundproof

If you look at your ram modules, see if ram is populated on both sides or one. It just doesn't work, its incompatible for wahtever reason. Though you can fiddle with the bios area, use default or tweek it abit, save setting and try again. In that vein, you may need to install older ram even to get into bios, reset, save, then shutdown and install new ram. If none of this works, return ram. Then specifically ask for ram that suppose to work in your system. http://www.kingston.com or http://www.crucial.com offer far better offering that are 'suppose' to work in your system. Last, you may have handled it wrong and caused 'static', ESD damage, ooops, it happens. tada -----Willy
