you offer nothin in how or what the pc is.
if you simply plan to format, i suggest now you google and then use killdisk or dban pgms.
that totally wipe out the hd.
then, reformat using the windoze os disc, i suspect to reuse the hd.
there will be no data to recover unless, the data is on another hd or partition(?).
