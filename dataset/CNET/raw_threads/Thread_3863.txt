I own a web design company, and I am online all day every day. All other websites that I have browsed work fine. (travel sites included) My problem is that I can get to the Expedia.com website, but cannot actually perform a search for a flight or a hotel or anything. I could before I installed the router. This is frustrating, because I use Expedia a lot, and I need to see the site. The site just hangs in my browser, or I get Page Cannot Be Displayed.... I called Netgear customer support three times, and each time they had me reduce the MTU size on the router settings. I have done as they asked. The current setting for the MTU is 1250. I still cannot get Expedia to work. Does anyone know how I can adjust this to make it work? OR If not, please do not recommend LinkSys, but what else? Is there a brand that anyone would suggest I try? This is frustrating. Thank you

Had the same problem with MSN.Game.Zone with same useless Netgear suggestions. You may get it to work but it will intermitantly drop your connection, not good for playing games with others. Finally gave up and got a D-Link which works fine.

EXPEDIA is in listed the top ripoff link at the bad business bureau ( http://www.ripoffreport.com ) and has two &quot;dedicated&quot; websites due to poor customer support and lies: http://www.victimsofexpedia.com and http://www.shameonexpedia.com kind regards

Hope it has a better range than this Netgear too. This one boasts 500 feet. Baloney. Not even 50. Crap all the way around. BUT, I can see all of MY websites, which my LinkSys would not, depending on the day of the week and the weather outside, and what I had for dinner last night. One step forward...two steps back. Thanks for the input, both of you. I will just keep buying routers until I find one with no behavior issues. Cheers!

This to make up for *&(#*#*&ing our last trip up. So I have to use them to get my $200. Otherwise, I would be buying DIRECT from ICELAND AIR. Great people, decent food, nice little stop-over to strech the legs and grab a cig then off to destination. Thanks for posting!
