I have a sony vaio pcv-rx650 pc with a 1.6 ghz pentium 4 processor.
intel 845 chipset.
I want to upgrade my processor to one with hyper threading technology but I'm not sure if I can.
Sony's answer to me is they cannot support a processer upgrade.
Does anyone know if this is possible?
Is there a limit to the speed of the processor I can upgrade too?
I have 400Mhz system bus.
Thanks
