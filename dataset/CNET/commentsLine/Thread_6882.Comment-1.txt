my sister got a used apple 1705 monitor but no cable.
upon checking, it does have a db15 connection on the back.
the original cable(googled) says, it would work provided you use the &quot;adapter&quot; that came with it for pcs.
no cable and no adapter.
now, investigating further suggests it will work with a db15(male) to db15(male) cable to a vga card.
but, it seems there maybe a scanning issue.
if this is the case, will it work at all using a std.
vga(pc) cable from monitor to video card.
no need getting a cable if it won't sync as googling provides, but others says it will work.
i want to believe a newer pc type video card will be able to sync but hate to waste $ for a new monitor cable.
i just wonder if anyone has gone through this?
otherwise, it be recycled via the goodwill.
yeah, they do recycle, not resell.
