what computer make & model?
if a home build, what motherboard make & model?
what video card model?
what do you want to do with the computer?
if gaming, buy a new one.
otherwise, upgrade system ram to at least 512mb (or possibly up to 1gb).
maybe get a better video card, but that depends on the computer model and what you want to spend.
you need to discover if it can take an agp 4x/8x video card or just a pci video card (pci express is not an option for a computer that old).
bottom line: if you do only one thing, upgrade the system ram.
windows xp likes at least 512mb, and you will notice the difference.
i don't like the idea of dumping too much money into that older system, especially since nice new systems are inexpensive.
