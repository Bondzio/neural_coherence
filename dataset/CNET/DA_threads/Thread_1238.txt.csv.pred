1.2.1	The Dynex stuff is just Best Buy's label and gear.	St
1.2.2	Nothing to get excited about.	St
1.2.3	I like 2 or more cores in today's machines.	St
1.2.4	But you didn't tell what this machine would be used for.	St
1.2.5	Let's see if a gamer would like it?	St
1.2.6	http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/product?product=3820307&lc=en&cc=tr&dlc=tr&lang=tr&cc=tr The video is &quot;Integrated on motherboard (see motherboard and chipset)&quot; and is the fair performer for Visa Aero GeForce 6150SE.	St
1.2.7	- This is not a gaming machine.	St
1.2.8	It's a nice machine for most things, just not ready to play today's high end games.	St
1.2.9	Bob	St
1.3.1	Yea, it will be used for gaming mostly.	St
1.3.2	I am trying to save money on it, and then upgrade it.	St
1.3.3	Do you have any thoughts on a good gaming PC that is reasonable?	Polite
1.4.1	As you are getting Vista 64, I'll write that you have to check if your games, printers and such are supported by that.	St
1.4.2	http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01357135&lc=en&dlc=tr&cc=tr&lang=tr&product=3820307 is the motherboard.	St
1.4.3	Yes it has a PCIe x16 slot.	St
1.4.4	Let's find the power supply rating.	St
1.4.5	It's a 300 Watt PSU so if you go too far out you'll have to replace that.	St
1.4.6	This leads me to suggest the lower power video cards from this list -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card,2064.html &quot;The Radeon HD 4670 slaps previous generation high-end performance squarely in the jaw of mid-range pricing.	St
1.4.7	With 320 shader processors, this card means business, and will provide awesome 1600x1200 gaming.	St
1.4.8	Compared to the 9600 GSO, its main advantage is a low power requirement.	St
1.4.9	It doesnt need an external power cable, which for some upgraders is a really important feature.&quot; Unless you want to change the PSU, I'd shop this card.	St
1.4.10	Bob	St
1.5.1	just my humble opinion... if you want to game, and you want to upgrade, save the time and the money and go buy what you want now.	St
1.5.2	i just built a 9850BE quad on asus for under $1000 (already had dual monitors), overclocked a little and it screams.	St
1.5.3	not saying your wrong, just something to consider.	St
1.5.4	shop parts at tom's or newegg... always good deals.	St
