i also dislike the widescreen formats of most new monitors, and would like to stop all the scrolling that is needed to read most pages.
i was going to buy the widest screen i could afford, as long as it had rotating capabilities, and rotate the screen so it's tall, eliminate alot of scrolling,,any thoughts how this might work in the long run, or would it be just as frustrating side scrolling?
