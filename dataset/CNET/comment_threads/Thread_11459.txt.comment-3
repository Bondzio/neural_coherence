Thanks.
First I want to say I feel like a Putz.
It is a C7280.
I went to uninstall the drivers for the 7200 and they were not even there.
SO I downloaded the proper drivers.
It is working now.
But I keep on getting a pop up about the imaging device not being there.
I think they are talking about the scanner which I never use.
I know I installed all of the drivers for the printer so I do not know why it is saying that.
Otherwise it is working like it is suppose to.
Thanks again.
