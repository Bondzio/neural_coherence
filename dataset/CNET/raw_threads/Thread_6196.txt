I'm trying to access my hard drive from another computer since it became unbootable after my computer told me that there was an incompatible program on its drive. I bought a laptop hard drive enclosure from Newegg.com. It's a Rosewill enclosure, very cheaply made. The manual was filled with grammatical errors and typos. I'm asuming that there were translation problems. Anyway, it told me that I had to create a new partition in the hard drive and consequently reformat it. Unfortunately, I'm also trying to retrieve three-years-worth of work from the hard drive, and I would prefer not to erase the data to do that. Is there any way I can get around this? My partner just bought an iMac, but I have a Windows based computer (Compaq Presario 2100 notebook pc). How can I create a partition without erasing the data?

I bought a 100GB laptop HDD and had to do some searching to find an enclosure that would recognize the entire drive. I ended up getting an Adaptec enclosure ... all their enclosures support drives up to 1000GBs. VAPCMD

While I prefer Knoppix, there is also PCLinuxOS and DSL that are worth trying to see if they see the files. Since you are in some file/drive recovery mode you have to reveal the details. For instance one person was trying to recover files from a NTFS formatted drive on a Windows 98se machine. Oops. In closing see if a demo of ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY sees the files from http://www.z-a-recovery.com/ sees it. At that point this becomes an economic decision. Are my files worth this much? Bob

You could possibly forget the whole external hard drive enclosure. If it is a laptop hard drive you might need an adapter but it should be easy to do.

Do not have slave or master selected on your drive. Leave empty.Connect Power: When you start your friends pc the drive should be showing itself. From there you can grab what you want off of it. There are many self help quides on the net to explain this in detail or diagrams if you want. IF you do not see it and have trouble's there is a program from http://www.grc.com/intro.htm called Spin Rite by Steve GIbson that recovers Hard drives. Just for your info. May come in handy and is not expensive.

But you would hook the drive you want the information off of as the slave (change jumper to slave) on the second channel of you IDE Cable. Make sure that the primary hard drive on this machine has its jumper set to be master and not Cable Select as sometimes the case. Once the hard drives are connected to the IDE Channel and both have power and jumpered correctly, you should be able to see it once you boot up and then just Drag and drop.

There were three slots; one was empty and had no ribbon. The second one was connected to the CD Drive and it had a slave port. The third one was connected to the primary hard drive but had no slave port. I connected my laptop hard drive through an adapter to the secondary hook-up of the second ribbon (didn't work), then disconnected the CD drive and connected the end of the ribbon to my laptop hard drive, still didn't work. The screen would blip on and there would be a loud beep from the machine and it would say that the hard drive couldn't be detected. I'm thinking that the ribbon connected to the primary hard drive needed a slave port. Can anyone correct me if I'm wrong?
