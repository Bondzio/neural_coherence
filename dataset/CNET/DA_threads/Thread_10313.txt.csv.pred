1.1.1	Whats up with chinese tablets .	St
1.2.1	Many have no service centers and some are buggy .	St
1.2.2	And the OS is usually done without any license fees .	St
1.2.3	Of course there is that issue with labor .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	In this instance , & quot ; you get what you pay for & quot ; holds very true here .	St
1.3.2	I shell out a bit more money and get one that has a reputable brand name .	St
1.3.3	With those no name tablets , you 're just asking for grief .	St
1.3.4	Cheers !	St
1.3.5	-Lee	St
1.4.1	If you told me that Toshiba , Motorola , Samsung and Lenovo were rebranded Chinese tablets I would be surprized , but if you told me the Kindle Fire , Nook color , Vizio or Viewsonic were I would not be .	St
1.4.2	We know that the iPad kinda-sorta is/is not a rebranded Chinese tablet .	St
1.4.3	Rebranding adds a lot to the price .	St
1.4.4	Also having a turtleneck wearing CEO telling you that you are cool for owning one of these things adds a lot to the price .	St
1.4.5	Also they are made generally as one piece .	St
1.4.6	A Lenovo TPT you can field strip it .	St
1.4.7	Virtually every tablet has a limited lifetime .	St
1.4.8	Depending on use , it could be as low as two years , on average five years and probably ten years max ( assuming normal usage ) .	St
1.4.9	Chinese tablets are built with the expectation that tablets will last 3-4 years on average , and are n't built to last much longer .	St
1.4.10	That reduces the production costs .	St
1.4.11	I think many people would be surprised how many tablets you see out there come of the same assembly line as a Chinese tablet but simply have a different cover slapped on .	St
1.4.12	Of course many people do n't mind paying the extra for the rebranded tablet , seeing how the instructions are in English and you do n't have to ship it to China for service .	St
1.4.13	YMMV	St
