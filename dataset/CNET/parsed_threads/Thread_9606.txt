<s> Hey everybody. </s>
<s> I was thinking about buying a mac mini, and then I did and I love it, and then I started thinking about what a mac mini would be like on intel hardware. </s>
<s> Personally I would love to see the mac mini on a Pentium M proccessor with upgrades available up to 2GB of Ram. </s>
<s> And a graphics card to match. </s>
<s> I think at least an ATI X800Pro. </s>
<s> What hardware setups would you guys like to see the Mac Mini with? </s>

<s> Bob, I spotted the post and name immidiately also. </s>
<s> You don't miss a thing. </s>
<s> Simply amazing! </s>
<s> I wasn't aware that the mini would be shipping with Intel Hardware, I though it would possibly have an Intel processor but I hadn't heard that Intel were making all the other stuff inside it. </s>
<s> Oh well, sucks to be wrong. </s>
<s> I would like to see the new mini ship with Quad G5 @ 3Ghz, 32X DL Blue-Ray DVD, 4Gb RAM(expandable to 12Gb), 2 Terrabyte HD, Gigabit ethernet, NVIDIA Quadro FX 4500 Graphics card, (to drive my 2 30&quot; Cinema displays), Gigabit Wireless and Bluetooth 4. </s>
<s> Connectivity would include, but not be limited to, 4 Firewire 800/400 ports, 8 USB 2.0 ports, 2 Gigabit ethernet ports, Dolby 6.0 sound out and a Mic socket. </s>
<s> The graphics card already has dual DVI connectors. </s>
<s> Of course, the mini is far to bulky in its present form so a 38% reduction all round would be a start. </s>
<s> As this would be the low end version, I would expect the bottom line to be $399.00 with free shipping and 3 years, OnSite AppleCare. </s>
<s> Oh, I'm sorry. </s>
<s> I though we were being silly again, like the other posts you make. </s>

<s> Hey, yeah, basically I am doing marketing research... And also I just like hearing what other people think... Like people I son't personally know in person... </s>
<s> But yeah I am doing reasearch. </s>
<s> Yeh, I would love to see the mac mini with a Quad G5! </s>
<s> The Intel Mac Mini will come with the black iPod, 47 inch dual displays and 15 year warranty. </s>
<s> Support will be by help.com Hope this helps. </s>
<s> Bob. </s>
<s> PS. </s>
<s> In reality, I want the dual core 64-bit Mactel laptop. </s>
<s> Peter, I started to read your post and my eyes got bigger and bigger! </s>
<s> My, what a Mac mini that would be. </s>
<s> That is so funny! </s>
<s> A little bit of English humor here? </s>
