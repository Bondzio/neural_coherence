I have an old IBM computer in my bedroom (350 MHz Pentium, 192 MB RAM) that is strictly used for checking e-mail, occasional online shopping.
Considering buying a bigger monitor, leaning towards a 17 inch LCD.
What should I look for to make sure that if I buy an LCD monitor it will be compatible with this computer?
Mostly curious about the plug-in, are LCDs compatible with old analog ports?
