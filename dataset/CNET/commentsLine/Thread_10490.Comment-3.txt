such an o.e.m.
pc will only work with it's original motherboard since the recovery cds will only have the drivers & software for that motherboard.
if one of the recovery cds is labeled windows xp then you might be able to use it to do a clean install on your new motherboard.
you can give it a shot.
the reason i stated that is i had performed a similar installation a couple of weeks ago.
someone had wiped out the hidden recovery partition on a hp pavilion so could not do a recovery as no recovery disks were available.
but the hp has the xp cd key on the side of the pc.
i was able to use another o.e.m.
winxp he cd from a dell dimension to install xp on the hp using the hp cd-key!
