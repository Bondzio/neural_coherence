Hey, I just installed the ATI Theater 550 Pro TV tuner card, and I want to play my PS2 on it.
However, I can't seem to find a way how to play it.
So I have a few questions: First, how do I go to the PS2 in the first place?
Do I access it from TV?
Is there supposed to be a special channel?
Second, I don't have a cable or tv antenna connected; do I need to have one connected to play the ps2?
Third, I have Windows SP1.
Do I really need SP2 to play on the ps2?
