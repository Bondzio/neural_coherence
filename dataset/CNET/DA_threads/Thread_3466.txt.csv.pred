1.2.1	Wireless keyboard only works for one pc at a time.	St

1.6.1	You can have 2 PC's with 2 monitors controlled by one keyboard and 1 mouse.	St
1.6.2	The speed of switching depends on what kind of KVM you get.	St
1.6.3	There are KVM switches that can work with PS/2 or USB keyboards and mice.	St
1.6.4	The PS/2 KVM switch switches between PC's faster than the USB version (1 second vs. 3-4 seconds) because with the USB version, the PC you switch to has to re-recognize the device vis usb.	St
