the new cdrw drive may have come with a 40 wire connection and the dvd that was in your machine may need an 80 wire cable so use the cable that was fitted originally.
if cable select doesn't work set the drive on the end as master and other as slave, if it's a cable that has a blue connector at one end and a black at the other, make sure to plug the blue end of the cable to the ide channel on the motherboard.
