My THinkCentre S50 is displaying an error message &quot;1962 NO OPERATING SYSTEM FOUND&quot; I brought it on Ebay and it did not have an rescue and recovery disk.
I've been trying to find an ISO file but no luck.
I tried their R&R disk but I can't create the disk because the software is LENOVO enabled and I can't run the software anywhere else.
Any thoughts??????
Thanks
