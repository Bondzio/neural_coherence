Colors were accurate to what was on screen. However, when I loaded the .tif file in the program Epson Print CD and printed to DVD, the colors seem faded and even appeared like some colors were not used or mixed. Either the Epson program is not very good or the paper quality of the printable DVD does not absorb the ink well? Anyone having the same problem or have suggestions? using Epson R220 Verbatim DVD-R 8x printable http://www.thetechgeek.com/content/product.php?pid=6315&cid=69&ovchn=GGL&ovcpn=&ovcrn=&ovtac=PPC&gclid=CLqKtuPwgIQCFSYdSAodllaEig

But as mentioned earlier, I can print the .tif file perfectly fine on paper via Photoshop. I would assume my printer profile has already been set up. I am not sure why under Epson's DVD label making program can't seem to print the colors right.

In other words keep it as simple as possible to reduce &quot;hi-quality&quot; output as that alone puts out alot of ink. Excluding true media(CD blanks) are decent, as I suspect Epson suggested some Epson brand and/or certain product for best results. I suggest the above as you mentioned &quot;mixed colors&quot; which is a physical result of too much ink being present before the media can do its job if at all. Epson has always placed in default mode &quot;hi-qulaity&quot; levels as to that product it may also. As a further note as per Robert's suggestions, you can't take anything for granted as you may have since you used the same .tif file &quot;as is&quot; and expected same results but two different pgms. were used. Time to tweak away. tada -----Willy
