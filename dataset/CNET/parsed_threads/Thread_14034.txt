<s> I recently upgraded the motherboard and processor to my rapidly aging eMachines desktop. </s>
<s> The hardware store I normally buy from was running a deal. </s>
<s> Now I have a Chaintech MPM800-3 with a 2.80 GHz Celeron processor running with my factory standard hard drive, CD-RW and power supply. </s>
<s> Things have been running extremely well, except for a recent occurance of random freezes and shut downs. </s>
<s> Sometimes whatever I'm doing will hang for a second and then the screen will go black and come back up normal in 1-2 seconds. </s>
<s> Other times everything will lock up requiring a forced reboot. </s>
<s> Still other times the computer will simply shut down, no error message, nothing. </s>
<s> I was thinking that it could be my dinky 250 Watt power supply or possibly a heat issue. </s>
<s> If anyone has any suggestions I would be very grateful. </s>
<s> Although power supply is important and,250 is not enough my first quetion would be what did you upgrade from? </s>
<s> Give us those specs. </s>
<s> You did not mention new heatsink or cpu fan. </s>
<s> What memory are you running? </s>
<s> Was this upgraded for your new motherboard? </s>
<s> ect. </s>
<s> It maybe due to the system RAM, Try replacing RAM. </s>
<s> The old system specs were an Intel 810e chipset with a 1.4 GHz Celeron processor. </s>
<s> I installed a new heatsink (it already had the thermal glue on the bottom so I couldn't have screwed that up) and CPU fan which is running properly and was rated high enough for the 2.8 GHz processor. </s>
<s> I now have 256 MB PC2700 DDR SDRAM in one slot with another of the same on the way. </s>
<s> The RAM is brand new from Office Depot, so it better not be faulty. </s>
<s> I was told I could install any 266/333/400 DDR memory and at bootup it says mine is at 333. </s>
<s> The graphics card is the same one I had before, an nVidia 5200 128 MB PCI card. </s>
<s> The fan seems to be working on that one still. </s>
<s> I really appreciate all the help, this problem is starting to get pretty annoying. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Hi, Could you try booting up and using the sytem with less stuff? </s>
<s> e.g. </s>
<s> remove the VGA card, use the on-board one, and use less / one pcs or even old RAM. </s>
<s> If it works fine, than re-install RAM, Cards one by one to see the difference. </s>
<s> You may also adjust the CL value in the bios to a bigger value (e.g. </s>
<s> CL3 or 4) I have similar problem for my PCs / notebooks at home and work. </s>
<s> RAM is usually the source of problem. </s>
