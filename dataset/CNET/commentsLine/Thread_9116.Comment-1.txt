i have a seagate freeagent go 750gb that my mac won't recognise.
i can't afford to lose the contents.
the drive was recognised until recently and is still seen by disk utility, but won't display a desktop icon to access the contents.
i've run disk utility many times and it won't fix the problem.
i've followed all the steps in the knowledgebase articles.
i've tried to use seagate's diagnostics software, but without success.
i've followed all steps in their knowledgebase.
can you help?
