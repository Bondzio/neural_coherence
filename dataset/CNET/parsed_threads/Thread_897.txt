<s> If you found it in the garbage any number of components and items could be bad--motherboard circuitry, bad capacitors, loose/missing soldering, RAM, PSU, hard drive, video card, bad power and data cables, heat/water damage. </s>
<s> You name it. </s>
<s> A full system inspection is in order. </s>
<s> This usually means taking all components out of the case, including the motherboard. </s>
<s> Any computer is not expected to run any version of Windows without a fresh installation of the OS and the drivers that the system needs. </s>
<s> Windows is not intended to be installed on the HD of one computer, and then have the HD moved to another computer. </s>
<s> At this point, I strongly suggest running a Linux operating system to see if the system can run stable for a long time. </s>
<s> Download and burn Knoppix or Damn Small Linux. </s>
<s> The live CD versions of these distributions run off the CD and not hard disk. </s>
<s> If the system can't do that, then I'd return it to the garbage. </s>
<s> BTW, how much RAM is present? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Try changing out the CMOS battery... </s>
