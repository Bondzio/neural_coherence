in my earlier post, i should plainly explained to use 64-bit fully or at all, requires 64-bit &quot;h/w&quot; as well.
the drivers thus must be ms ready for 64-bit usage.
in vista it's all the more harder, not only finding 64-bit ready s/w but vista has not been warmly supported as one would like.
though, this is a big problem as in xp it still prevalent as well.
vista was suppose to clear problems found in xp 64-bit version but it seems things aren't all that good.
let's just say, if you can avoid 64-bit usage as a beginner there are problems in plain old 32-bit to deal with that seem more solvable.
