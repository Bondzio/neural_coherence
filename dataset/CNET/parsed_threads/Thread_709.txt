<s> I am looking to connect two computers to a wireless broadband network and am looking for all the methods to connect my two computers. </s>
<s> I have looked at an access point that can operate in client mode that will connect two ethernet devices and have given thought to buying two wireless cards. </s>
<s> Although two wireless would work i am already ethernet-ready and have a crossover cable that i could cut and crimp connectors to connect to the access point that i was discussing earlier (wired-wireless). </s>
<s> I am wondering if anyone knows of any cheap, but effective alternatives before i make a decision. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
