<s> I am currently looking for parts to build a computer and was wondering which processor was better. </s>
<s> This new computer will be used mainly for surfing the web and listening to music. </s>
<s> either one will problaly do just fine. </s>
<s> So go with the least expensive one. </s>
<s> If you look at the benchmarks out there, a Celeron D at 2.4ghz will perform about the same as a sempron 2400+(1.667ghz). </s>
<s> However, a sempron/motherboard combination will be a bit cheaper than a Celeron D/motherboard combo. </s>
<s> Plus, the Celeron D's are quite loud and run hot. </s>
<s> The only time I would get a Celeron D is if you wanted to overclock it. </s>
