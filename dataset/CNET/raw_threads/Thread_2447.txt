When I look in device manager it shows me an unknown PCI device, and of course I have no drivers forit. When I download the sound drivers off the compaq website supposedly for the computer I have, no luck no sound. I tried diabling the on-board sound and putting in my own sound card, but that hasn't worked either. Any other things I can try?

Without a restore cd, you need to research and install the motherboard drivers, sound, NIC etc... The other possibility is the onboard sound is controlled by a jumper or the Bios or is broken.

When I got the computer there was no sound, I wiped the drive with fdisk, then re-installed windows 98. I went to the compac site and looked up the specs on the computers origianl configuration and I downloaded 2 different drivers, neither one of them worked. I went to the bios and defaulted back to the origianl settings, that didn't help. How can I figure out what isn't working so I can fix that. I downloaded the manual on the particular kind of motherboard it is, and there is no new info there. In startup it recognizes a PCI card, but never lets me download drivers. This is a basic system, no extras. I can't believe that it just isn't going to work, and if that is true, why didn't my sound card work? Perhaps I need to go with name brand that comes with a disk. Help!
