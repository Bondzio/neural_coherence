<s> I have had Comcast cable internet for about 3 years now and have always used the same RCA cable modem and have had no problems. </s>
<s> Two months ago I first starting having a problem where the internet randomly disconnects but the modem is blinking exactly as it does when it's connected. </s>
<s> I'd have to wait several hours before the internet would work again and had no clue why. </s>
<s> This only happened about once a week so I figured it was comcast fixing something each time. </s>
<s> About a week ago it did this and did not come back on for over 24 hours. </s>
<s> I called Comcast and asked them how to fix this and they told me to open up my Network Connections folder and disable Local Area Connection 2. </s>
<s> After that I need to unplug my cable modem and plug it back in until the lights are all blinking as normal. </s>
<s> I then have to enable Local Area Connection 2 and the internet works again. </s>
<s> I was glad to find a solution to the problem, but now this happens every several minutes! </s>
<s> The problem seems to happen a lot more often when I am downloading torrents or other p2p files but this never used to happen. </s>
<s> I've had to fix the problem four times while typing this message, can anybody help me? </s>
<s> I'd like to rid myself of this problem or at least minimize it. </s>
<s> a P2P sharing program points to some form of malware infestation. </s>
<s> If this is the only PC on the LAN, try another. </s>
<s> This will tell if the disconnects are related to your original PC, a faulty modem or an ISP issue. </s>
<s> Comcast has upgraded their system to a newer protocol. </s>
<s> Some of the older modems are not compatible. </s>
<s> The list of modems is at the Comcast site. </s>
<s> And the new protocol enables faster speeds. </s>
<s> I replaced my D-link DCM-200 to a new DCM-202 and my speed went from 3 Mb/s to over 6. </s>
<s> And Comcast is in the process of upgrading again to an advertised 11 Mb/s. </s>
<s> Replace the modem. </s>
<s> Are they both DHCP? </s>
<s> Does this mean you have 2 default gateways as well? </s>
<s> Windows typically uses 1 gateway and never resorts to the second gateway until packet loss is detected. </s>
<s> My guess is that your P2P software is opening bunches of tcp sessions and you router can not handle it. </s>
<s> Your $50 router can only track a certaing number of sessions. </s>
<s> It seems many consumer routers stop functioning when the NAT limit is exceeded. </s>
<s> Try turning it off or stop sharing your directory with others to cut down on sessions. </s>
<s> Trace Route to yahoo or the DNS server when the problem happens to see if traffic even gets past your router. </s>
<s> You should do this while the network is healthy and keep a copy handy for future reference. </s>

<s> I'm not sure if I found the right list but my modem model(DCM305) was on the list of cable modems approved for use with the Comcast High-Speed Internet Service at http://www.comcast.net/help/faq/index.jsp?faq=ConnectionCable_Modems17905 This list might not be up-to-date so could you please check if mine is on the list you were referring to or send me a link? </s>
<s> Also, I've tested my download speed and it's maxing out at only 1.5mbps when it was maxing out at 6.2mbps only a few months ago. </s>
<s> I've always used Local Area Connection 2 as far back as I can remember. </s>
<s> Local Area Connection is disabled and if I enable it I get an error saying &quot;A network cable is unplugged&quot;. </s>
<s> I don't worry about that because my internet has always worked fine with it disabled. </s>
<s> The internet disconnects often even when I'm not using P2P file sharing software but it only happens every 30 minutes or so instead of every 2 to 20 minutes while running P2P file sharing software. </s>
<s> I've only been downloading 2 large files and used to download 10+ at a time without a problem. </s>
<s> I'm basically downloading files I wont be able to download when I relocate in 3 weeks and cancel my comcast subscription. </s>
<s> I really see no benefit in buying a new modem, if that is the cause of the problem, just to use it for 3 weeks. </s>
<s> Your modem is DOCSIS is 1.0/1.1 (the older cable protocol). </s>
<s> The newer protocol is DOCSIS 2.0. </s>
<s> Your modem is indeed approved for Comcast, but the newer protocol is needed to get the higher speeds. </s>
<s> The D-link DCM-202 is DOCSIS 2.0 protocol. </s>
<s> I'd buy the D-link, try it, and if it works you're set. </s>
<s> If it doesn't work, return it and we'll try another route. </s>
<s> Some Virus do port scans looking for a new target to infect. </s>
<s> This can have the same effect as P2P software opening many TCP connections and crashing the router. </s>
<s> When in doubt, download the free Ethereal scanner and capture everything in/out of your PC ethernet card. </s>
<s> Shut down all browsers and mail and just scann your ethernet and see what traffic generates on its own. </s>
<s> This will give you a hint of what is going on. </s>
<s> I seriously doubt the problem is Comcast. </s>
