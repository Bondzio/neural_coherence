<s> Just built a brand new computer. </s>
<s> Everything runs fine untill I try to install any video card drivers. </s>
<s> Installing these leads immediately to a Machine Check Exception. </s>
<s> Any Ideas? </s>

<s> Out of date bios, flash or bum part. </s>
<s> Check with it's builder to exchange parts till it works. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> What's in your post does not tell us what's bad. </s>
<s> sorry I dont know what else to say. </s>
<s> I built it all myself today. </s>
<s> It's my first attempt at building a PC..untill now I've just swaped parts and such. </s>
<s> the only clue i have for you guys is that without installing video card drivers everything is just fine. </s>
<s> I wonder if you forgot some BIOS or flash update, the motherboard drivers (some try what's on the CD and that's buggy or out of date.) </s>
<s> With such slim details all I can say is to call the maker and ask what they want to be exchanged. </s>
<s> Another nutty thing is overclocking. </s>
<s> Imagine the poor soul that tries that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I just got XP home edition updated with service pack2 the video card drivers (latest omega)randomly worked last night however when I restarted I got the same error I have never overclocked. </s>
<s> BIOS is stock, as it came on the mobo, I checked ASUS website for an update however the only BIOS on their site for labeled as &quot;initial release&quot; so im assuming im on that now. </s>
<s> here are the numbers in the error 0x0000009c (0x00000000, 0xf7ac3050, 0xp02000040, 0x00000800) </s>
<s> I've dropped this hint twice so here's the last time. </s>
<s> Tell me about the OS install. </s>
<s> Specifically what motherboard drivers you installed. </s>
<s> If none, then tell that. </s>

<s> This is a low-level hardware issue cause by: Memory errors that may include parity or Error Correction Code (ECC) problems Cache errors in the processor or hardware Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLB) errors in the processor Other CPU-vendor specific detected hardware problems Vendor-specific detected hardware problems First, you'll need bios v 0310 (a beta bios) to support your CPU and RAM. </s>
<s> http://support.asus.com/download/download.aspx?SLanguage=en-us&model=P5N32-SLI%20Deluxe The &quot;stock&quot; bios is not fully compatible with either. </s>
<s> From ASUS' spec sheet: CPU: Socket775 for Intel Pentium Processor Extreme Edition / Pentium D / Pentium 4 / Celeron CPU Memory: Dual channel memory architecture 4 x 240-pin DIMM sockets support max. </s>
<s> 16GB DDR2 667/533 non-ECC memory You could try manually setting your RAM to DDR2-667 since DDR2-800 can be problematic even on boards with explicit support. </s>
<s> Lastly, the p5n32 has been known to be troublesome with dual core intel CPUs since its release. </s>
<s> IMHO, you be best off exchanging the board for one based on the intel 946, 965 or 975 chipset. </s>
<s> the problem seems to have been solved by some random reinstalling....thanks for your help...it's gone through 2 restarts now and no bluescreens </s>
