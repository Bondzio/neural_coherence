I want to be able to be in another room in the house, and print from my laptop without having to connect my laptop to the printer. I have ran the network wizard and the laptop sees the main computer name, but that is all. Any help will be greatly appreciated&gt; what do I need to make this work?

Now when you want to print to another machine's printer, &quot;dudley&quot; must have an account on the other machine. Plus all the other things that need to be right as well. Simple test for that. Go to the other machine, log off and can &quot;dudley&quot; log in with the same name and password as the other machine?
