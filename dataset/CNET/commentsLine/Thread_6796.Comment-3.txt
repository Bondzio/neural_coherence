please note.. i don't know the update date of this list by iomega i recommend you talk to iomega before buying any of their product or transfer any hardware over from your old pc to your vista pc, they have a live chat that you can access thru their web site m-f. my 2nd recommendation is call or talk to them at least 3 times at different day and time and keep track of the rep name if you get 2 out of 3 with the same answers then you know you are not being told incorrect information.
this is one good way to make your decision and of course use forum like this to check out more.
