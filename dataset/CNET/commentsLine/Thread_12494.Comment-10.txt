i have a desktop with a realtek pci ethernet nic card with a cat5 ethernet cable hooked up to my laptop through a realtek ethernet nic card.
both are set on factory settings.
all i have done so far is run the windows home network setup.
since my desktop has the wireless internet on it i set that to access internet directly and ran the same home network setup on my laptop and set that to access through another computer since it will be accessing it through my desktop.
when im done it asked me to restart so i did.
and nothing happened.
it still says a network cable is unplugged.
from what i heard ive done everything right.
i dont know why it wont work.
right now the tcp/ip settings are all set on obtain automatically.
do you even have to mess with those settings at all to get the network to work?
