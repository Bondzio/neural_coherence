I am continually having a problem with staying connected to the Internet during idle periods on my IBM desktop.
I am running Windows Xp SP2, and am connected via cable modem (Time Warner Roadrunner) with an ethernet cable.
Usually, just right clicking the connection icon in the tray and selecting Repair corrects the problem, but occasionally I have to reboot the machine.
Does anyone have any suggestions?
This is time consuming and annoying.
Otto
