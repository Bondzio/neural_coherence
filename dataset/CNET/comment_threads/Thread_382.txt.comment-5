Pricing is a main factor in any SSD purchase, so don't expect a bargain soon.
In fact if you do, seriously reconsider the vendor.
A SSD will be fast, but some have proven not to last as long or be as problem free.
Many operate well, however when they do have a problem, they just up and die, no clue beforehand, via my experience.
So, pick a vendor or maker with a good warranty.
