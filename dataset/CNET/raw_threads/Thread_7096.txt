I am running Windows Vista home premium. I have started a little shot and burn wedding photography business and my AMD 64X2 4200 cpu and 2 gig of ram is a little on the slow side when doing 500 or 600 pictures in Photoshop and would like to speed things up if possible. If I were to replace the motherboard,CPU and go to duel channel DDR2 memory would I have to format the hard drive and re-install windows Vista, the drivers and everything that goes with it? I also plan on upgrading the power supply from the 300watt that is in there now to a Antec 550watt. I have a 7600GS video card, so I think that should be OK for what I am doing. Price wise it comes out cheaper than buying a new system. Any advise would be appreciated. Thanks Wayne

Back to the original post. If I replace the motherboard, CPU and Ram will I have to do a clean re-install of Windows Vista? Thanks Wayne

Try changing the XP to the VISTA and see if anyone is having luck at this. Sorry, this is something I have yet to do. As to the /3GB switch, I'd learn about it since when you go past 2GB your OS won't use the 3rd GB without it. Bob

The MSI manual says I can go up to a 64x2 4800, but I have looked at Tiger Direct, Newegg and a couple others and can't find one. Also the MSI motherboard can only use DDR 3200 memory and not DDR2. Bob: Thanks for your information and I think the first thing I will do is add another gig of ram and do the /3GB switch and see if that helps. Thanks again. Wayne
