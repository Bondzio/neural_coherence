If you have set the BIOS to something like 'Safe defaults' (certainly not overclocking) then either the disk is damaged or some hardware is broken.
Probablky all you can do yourself is making a copy of the recovery disk and try that.
And see if you can run Linux Live or even install Linux.
Swapping hard disks with different OS'es across different makes and models of laptops is a useless excersize, I'm afraid.
And repairing replacing the motherboard usually isn't cost effective, unless you can get a cheap one from another machine and install that yourself.
