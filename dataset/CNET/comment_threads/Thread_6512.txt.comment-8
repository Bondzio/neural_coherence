Of course I have one on my GPU, one on my CPU, 2x 80mm fans at the base of my case to stir up some cold air, A massive 120mm fan at the right side of my case sucking air across from the left over all 4 of my hard drives, 2 in my PSU that blow very hot air out of the back.
I want one on the left blowing to meet the 120 on the left and one little guy under my psu to suck out the hot air from my gpu wich is just blowing hot air down...
I think I will hold off untill i get my wodden case completed.
Then I will have 12 fans.
10 of them will be 120mm... muwahahaha
