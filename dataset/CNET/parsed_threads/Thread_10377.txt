<s> I salvaged the hard drive from my crashed laptop, put it in a USB2-powered case and was up and running with it as an external drive. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, the USB cable became disconnected during a file transfer, and since then neither of my other machines will recognize the external drive. </s>
<s> I understand this kind of disconnect can damage the drive or at least the data on it, and I think I've ruled out everything else that might be causing the lack of recognition. </s>
<s> Going through the My Compute/Manage menu in Windows, I can see the drive and when I click on it I get a ''Device Cannot Start/Code 10.'' </s>
<s> I'd like to salvage what I can off the drive. </s>
<s> Failing that, I'm willing to reformat, but I don't see how I can get at it to even do that. </s>
<s> TIA for any help or suggestions. </s>
<s> problems posted there. </s>
