<s> I have a razer megalodon gaming headset, but when i switch it to 7.1 mode the sound seems to be 'blurry' and unclear, without its surrounding effect. </s>
<s> when i switch it back to 2.1 mode the music and sounds sound crystal clear. </s>
<s> I did set my games to 5.1 or 7.1 output, so idk whats wrong. </s>
<s> Megalodon has its own sound card, so does that mean it will totally ignore my original sound card? </s>
<s> I have ASUS P5SD2-A mother board and it has 6 channel audio so i'll assume its integrated sound card can support 5.1 audio anyway? </s>
<s> On to the next question, Im interested in getting a logitech G51 5.1 surround system, so as i mentioned above, will my motherboard(integrated sound card) support this system? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> bump... </s>
