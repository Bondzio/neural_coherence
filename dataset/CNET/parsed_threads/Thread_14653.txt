<s> The whole screen seems to glow unless it's tilted just right even when the background is black, and its totally impractical to use it like that. </s>
<s> The taskbar is hard to make out against the white of open windows because of this. </s>
<s> There seems to be no contrast. </s>
<s> The items on the screen seem to have a slight purplish hue. </s>
<s> Since it's a dumpster lap I attribute it to being old and worn out, but am unfamiliar with the term &quot;worn out lcd&quot;. </s>
<s> I had another one even worse once and it was even more purple with areas that were obviously more faded than others. </s>
<s> Is there anything I can do? </s>
<s> Since it's a 700 mhz and I'm poor I'm more than willing to take it (The screen) apart. </s>
<s> Well heck, you didn't mention exactly what it was other than a LCD. </s>
<s> Besides the LCD portion, there are electronics that drive lcds of the video display. </s>
<s> These are corona chips, etc. </s>
<s> which are separate items either onboard or elsewhere. </s>
<s> These like a monitor can fail or simply weaken and demise output. </s>
<s> In most cases they are unique to the model involved and only a pro has parts. </s>
<s> But the best an end-user can do is swap parts from a savalged unit, provided they're willing and capable. </s>
<s> If the LCD is that old, it may not be practical other than a learning experience. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> The LCDs do indeed do that. </s>
<s> First let's find that LCD burn out article. </s>
<s> http://www.calce.umd.edu/articles/abstracts/1999/indiumtext.htm In short, the materials in the LCD have degraded. </s>
<s> There is no fix available except to replace the LCD panel. </s>
<s> Sadly this is not economically sound since panel replacement exceeds the cost of the total display. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>

<s> That I need a pssword to view that page. </s>
<s> It would also appear that my question has been answered without actually having to see it. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> In answer to the first response to my question, it's an HP Pavilion N5250 700 mhz p3 notebook with a 13.1&quot; XGA-TFT display. </s>
<s> LCD's degrade due to chemical degradations and other issues. </s>
<s> What you do need to know is that high temperatures accelerate the aging process. </s>
<s> You can't &quot;fix it&quot;. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> This same notebook is only running at 547 MHZ. </s>
<s> It's a 700 by name. </s>
<s> The speedstep is disabled in the bios and no matter where I set it it reverts to disabled if it boots past the bios...even if it doesn't go into windows...say into the HP hardware diagnostics. </s>
<s> If it's set and the machine is reset and immediately returned to bios setup the setting is retained. </s>
<s> This is the only setting in the bios that it will not retain. </s>
<s> Do you have any idea what the problem is. </s>
<s> I reflashed it but it made no difference, and I cannot download the original or any other version. </s>
<s> Apparently it had been upgraded before I got a hold of it. </s>
