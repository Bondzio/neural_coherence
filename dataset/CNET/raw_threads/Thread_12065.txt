My home network is: - Desktop with Windows XP SP2 connected wired to a router Linksys WRT54G v5; - XBOX 360 connected wireless to the Linksys; - Printer connected wired to the Linksys; - The router connected to the internet trought a ethernet modem Siemens SpeedStream 4200 (PPoE connection). In that configuration the network works fine. All equipments connects to the internet and sees each others on the LAN/WAN. When I connect (wired or wireless) my notebook with Windows Vista Ultimate on the network the connection with internet goes down (to all equipments). When I shut down the notebook, all equipments can connect to the internet again. I ran the &quot;Diagnose and Repair&quot; utility and the Windows Answer was: DNS PROBLEM. I checked the DNS configuration 1.000 times and it's everything ok... I thought the problem was between Vista and the Linksys router so I upgrade the firmware (v 1.02.0) of the Linksys to the latest version. Didn't work... After that I configure a static IP at my notebook and use the DNS provided by my ISP (PPoE connection). Didn't work again... So I use my router in my office (different ISP and internet modem) and my notebook could access the internet (wired and wireless) normally (so the problem isn't vista x linksys). When I bring the router back to my home the problem occurs again. I think the problem is with the SpeedStream Modem 4200 (firmware not compatible with Vista?) or with my ISP. Anyone have any clue about this issue? Thanks in advance! Theo.

I don't have access to change the configuration. I think my internet provider changed that. I tried reset (according to the siemens website - http://www.siemens.com/index.jsp?sdc_p=t4lso1274280i1274279c9d1430133fmun1274280pz2&sdc_sid=14158242997& ) the modem to the factory configuration but the reset doesn't work too. I don't know what to do... Thanks for your help.

To get WIFI you need to use what we call a WAP (wireless access point.) This adds wifi without you needing to reconfigure the modem. Here's an example Linksys WAP -&gt; WAP54G at http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Product_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1126536803676&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper&lid=0367629416B02 Sorry to hear you're locked out.
