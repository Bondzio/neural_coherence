<s> I have a SMARTDISK USB 2.0 bus powered portable 40 GB notebook HDD. </s>
<s> Although it has the SMARTDISK brand on it CREATIVE has exactly the same product as CREATIVE USB HDD. </s>
<s> The problem is that, no matter which USB port I plug the device in, XP keeps saying that it's not plugged into a USB 2.0 port and the device works really slow (at USB 1.1 speed). </s>
<s> I tried the device with a number of desktops and notbeooks, and with every USB port on these computers, but always got the same result. </s>
<s> The device has a &quot;Y&quot; shaped plug going into the computer, that is two USB plugs parallel. </s>
<s> I think one of them is for draining power from another USB port if the main doesn't have enough power. </s>
<s> That's what I experienced using the plugs in combinations. </s>
<s> It works with the main one plugged in only . </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> The device with the Y is likely an USB 1.1 hub. </s>
<s> Upgrade that. </s>
<s> If I didn't understand this proper, please supply a link or picture of the products. </s>
<s> In closing, many laptops don't have USB 2.0 ports. </s>

<s> Sorry, I led to a misunderstanding. </s>
<s> I was referring to the USB harddisk by &quot;device&quot;. </s>
<s> So, there is only a HDD with it's cable. </s>
<s> I couldn't find the cable but here is the description fron it's specs: Cable(s) Included 1 USB cable External Cables included qty 1 Cables form factor External Cables type USB cable I tried the HDD with many new desktops, that i am sure they have USB 2.0 ports. </s>
<s> XP keeps saying I'd better plug into another port.. </s>
<s> Here is the link to the manufacturer's web page: http://www.creative.com/products/product.asp?category=497&subcategory=514&product=11172 (as a matter of fact, Noon Technology Co., Ltd., China is manufacturing the IDE-to-USB and the case) Thanks </s>
<s> If that is so, then go with what works. </s>
<s> The alternative is to return the product as defective. </s>
