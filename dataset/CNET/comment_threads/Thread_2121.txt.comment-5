Your post doesn't tell enough but there are a few clues here.
1.
You might have recycled another power supply and it does not meet the needs of this CPU and board.
2.
I see this has a 4 pin ATXV connection.
The symptoms are what happens with that is not plugged in.
3.
Some boards come jumpered in clear cmos and won't start.
4.
One board had a typo in the book about the reset connection.
Long story short is the motherboard printing was correct.
