<s> Pulled two sticks from old Dell machine. </s>
<s> Can anyone tell me the value of this RAM? </s>
<s> Two sticks marked PC100-322-620. </s>
<s> Thought they came in 64,128,256...... </s>
<s> 64 Megabytes from the looks of it. </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=PC100-322-620&btnG=Google+Search </s>
<s> Obviously the PC100 is the speed, some were PC133, 10ns vs. 8ns. </s>
<s> The 322 is the quality of the stick, that's a cheap one, 222 is better, 211 even better, the 620 is just the configuration of the memory. </s>
<s> Look at each module closely and count them, that'll give you the ram value of each stick. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Some memory boards have stickers or labels in it, check it out. </s>
<s> One way for finding out is to install it to your computer (if it will be compatible), remove current memory boards first, then check how much memory will be counted during start-up, or go to start, control panel, system, then system information, there the operating system will measure your memory board capacity. </s>
<s> Wow, you got a lot of weird answers to your question!! </s>
<s> Let's straighten it out. </s>
<s> Let's talk about the numbers 322-620 322 pertains to the CAS latency of the module CAS stands for Column Address Strobe -OR- Column-Address Select. </s>
<s> CAS latency refers to the number of processor cycles from when a Read command is registered to when the data from that Read command becomes available. </s>
<s> The 322 on your sticks mean: 3=CAS Latency 2=tRCD 2=tRP This is long lingo for saying that your have CL3 memory. </s>
<s> The reason? </s>
<s> tRCD and rTP speeds carry a default value of 2 and 2 with PC100 memory. </s>
<s> Example: PC100-322-620 is 100MHz, CL3, trcd=2, trp=2, tac=6, 2= spd rev 1.2 with the last digit reserved. </s>
<s> You have no indication as to the MB of th emodules. </s>
<s> Are they 64MB, 128MB or 256MB? </s>
<s> Obviously, without this final info you can't get the answer. </s>
