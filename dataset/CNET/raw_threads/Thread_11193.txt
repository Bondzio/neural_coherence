When you change these, they may not stick as Windows will rediscover the same unknown display device each time it starts. Your first quest should be to identify the display device and find a proper driver. If possible, you also look for a driver for the monitor. Once everyone gets to know each other, they work better together.

The 800x600 is default for basic usage within XP and other s/w. However, if the video card(or port) and monitor each other's capabilities its a better install. I do suggest you find out the video card maker, since you provide it as unknown. Here, may lie your fault, get a better driver or more complete driver set to best install it. Check under device mgr. what it reports. -OR- use PCWizard 2011 to get details of your system, google for it. tada -----Willy
