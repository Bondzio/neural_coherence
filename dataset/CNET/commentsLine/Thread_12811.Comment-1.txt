hi i'm having a post message issue that i need to resolve.
my specs are as follow: operating system system model windows xp home edition service pack 2 (build 2600) asustek computer inc. a7n8x rev 1.xx processor a main circuit board b 2.00 gigahertz amd athlon xp 128 kilobyte primary memory cache 256 kilobyte secondary memory cache board: asustek computer inc. a7n8x rev 1.xx bus clock: 133 megahertz bios: phoenix technologies, ltd asus a7n8x acpi bios rev 1017 beta 005 t9 12/06/2002 drives memory modules c,d 80.02 gigabytes usable hard drive capacity 54.18 gigabytes hard drive free space ok my issue is that when i boot on my computer roars then after 1 min it also it will stop.
but when it first boots up it says, system failed due to cpu overclocking.
i've never changed the bios i did the troubleshoot in the bios and everything is in default/optimal.
so i have no idea what the problem is and i really would appreciate the help.
