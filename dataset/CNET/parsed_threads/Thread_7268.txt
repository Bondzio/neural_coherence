<s> HP, Dell and others order systems. </s>
<s> The spec will call out what it needs and if there is some extra port or such, they take it and don't offer it in the documentation or support it. </s>
<s> Who said this port works? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> So how to get support ? </s>
<s> I can't find the make and model so I can only comment about a common thing you find. </s>
<s> If some maker documented this model to have 0 PCIE slots and you found one, then you should be able to figure out that it's use is not guaranteed or supported. </s>
<s> Then again you find folk that demand support for such. </s>
<s> Go figure. </s>

<s> You write &quot;my motherboard says theres no pcie slot but i see 1&quot; Later you reveal the model number so I go and get what HP writes about that model. </s>
<s> You seem upset about that but I'll try again if you will. </s>
<s> Now that we know there should be a slot and it is supported can you explain what you mean by &quot;my motherboard says theres no pcie slot&quot;? </s>
<s> For example some folk will run software such as &quot;What's in my PC.com&quot; and it won't find stuff. </s>
<s> That's not a good test software in my book so let's hear why you think the motherboard is reporting no such slot. </s>

<s> I never use ANY outside software on my stuff only Billy's stuff is good for me </s>
<s> Most BIOS's do that. </s>
<s> Not much that I can add here. </s>
<s> Maybe you wanted a BIOS to change which is the primary display but for most machines onboard is .. onboard and the other selection is the other card no matter if it's PCI, PCIe, AGP or another. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> And no, I see no signs that BIOS writers will ever get this right. </s>

<s> Who's running the show now? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I wonder if you are willing to discuss issues or were expecting tech support? </s>
<s> These are discussion forums with no paid staff. </s>
<s> I've tried to figure out the issue you were seeing but you seem to be upset at the slightest attempt at humor. </s>
<s> What's up with that? </s>
