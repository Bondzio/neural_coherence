I see I typo'd too much there.
I see many confuse going to DOS with going to a command line.
DOS is rarely usable to access today's systems.
I still may find an old system I want to update the BIOS to enable a memory upgrade but that's it.
The command line is a great skill to have.
You can boot (XP, others) to a command prompt to repair small annoyances such as a file that won't delete in Explorer and many other things.
Not that you have to learn the entire command set but deleting a file is all of TWO commands to learn.
