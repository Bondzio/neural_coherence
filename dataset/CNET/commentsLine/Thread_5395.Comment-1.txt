main computer sony viao pcv rx 6000 win xp.
laptop second computer dellinspirion e- 1705 w#in xp.
wireless lan belkin ( cant see model on body).
dsl hookup for internet service.
printer canon mp 780 pixima.
printer was already installed and working on the sony.
problem, everything is working fine except i can't get the printer to be accessed by the remote laptop.
i hooked this all up myself with no issues but the printer being accessed by the dell.
what basic thing am i missing?
i tried all the obvious like enabling and even installed the cd software on the dell.
basically what are the simple steps to add that printer to the wireless lan.
i know this is probably easy but i tried a lot and am missing the point.
thanks.
