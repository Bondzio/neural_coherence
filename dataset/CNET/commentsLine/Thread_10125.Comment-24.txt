real milk crates are just the greatest, they're tough and re-usable, easily multi-purpose and best of all, return them if you get tired of them or pass them on.
i have found those look-alike milk crates while decent do vary in quality and break more easily than the real mccoy, so placing too much weight shouldn't be over-looked.
but, yeah, you seem to have a good setup going.
i used to make shelves out of them and stash all sorts of papers, until i got some real shelving.
