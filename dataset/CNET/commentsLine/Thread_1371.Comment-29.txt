i would suggest the geforce 6600nu for pcie, instead of the geforce 6600gt (the nu is slightly slower, yet still easily capable (and only around $135)) or the radeon x600xt, which is $124 and equivalent performance to the 6600 (the geforce 6600 = geforce 6600nu = geforce 6600 128mb) as to networking i would suggest a pci add-in card, mainly because you can't accidentally unplug it (at least, it'd be harder to do) and pci add-in cards usually offer the ability to connect an antenna that isn't on the back of the pc or that is wired into a larger antena to send/recieve (a large wi-fi antenna, like a large yagi (simmilar to the &quot;cantenna&quot; concept)
