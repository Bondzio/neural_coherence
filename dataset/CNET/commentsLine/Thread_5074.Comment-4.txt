when i get a blue screen its all about hardware.. .. did you order the correct machine for the software and hardware.. .. example...for multi-media you really need a pentium 4 processor as minimum..the celeron d is a audio only cpu.. .. also if you ordered a video card installed i might check that for the problem-since that's an advanced user's part..your supplier might have that installed wrong.. .. if this is your first pc/your definitely in trouble on the money side.. it may have a built in defect from the supplier..and if you intercede thay can pull the warranty.. you may want to contact a consumer advocate in your local area for help on the issue of a defective pc.
