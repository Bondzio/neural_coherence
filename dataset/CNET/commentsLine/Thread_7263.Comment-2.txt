i tried to find the fan information for the first card's fan, from pny, but they only list the card specs.... the fan seems good, but i have a little worry.
caution: cannot be used with matrox vga cards and nvidia pcx 5xxx series vga cards that isn't your card, right?
pcx and pci are different, right?
