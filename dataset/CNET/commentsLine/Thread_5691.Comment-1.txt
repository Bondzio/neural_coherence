currently i have this configuration for my desktop: intel p915gav mobo pentium 4 3.0 ghz 1.5 gb ddr ram 1 x 320 gb 7200rpm hdd geforce 6200 tc gpu 1 x dvd-rw 1 x dvd-rom (optical drives are connected via y-cable splitter (power)) 500w power supply i'm planning to upgrade my gpu to a geforce 7900gs and add another 320 gb hdd... both these need to be directly connected to the power supply, meaning i'm going to use another 2 y-cable splitter for them.
is my power supply going to handle all these?
and i am a heavy computer user... 24x7 use of pc and maybe an 8 hour rest every week or two...
