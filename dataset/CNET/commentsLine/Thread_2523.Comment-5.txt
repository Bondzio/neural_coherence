i usually look to my backup disks.
for me that's all of 4 dvdrw disks.
that cost was all of 4 bucks and worth every penny.
i don't backup the os or programs but reload those from cd or net.
-&gt; try this.
put it in some usb external case and see if some other machine sees the files.
sorry to hear your troubles are continuing.
can you tell me if you connected it with the usual 80 conductor ide cable with the jumpers on cable select?
i.e.
the normal setup for hard drives.
