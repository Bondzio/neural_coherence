i have already had it replaced once (the company i bought it from said it sounds faulty) but i was disappointed to find the problem was still there.
2 months of waiting for netgear support to reply (lol) i get a personal phone call from one support tech who's currently trying his best to solve the problem.
we were hoping the version 3 (i had version 2) would be the fix, but we were wrong.
still, i got a nicer (more expensive too!)
looking router as a replacement.
it's still frustrating though... =o(
