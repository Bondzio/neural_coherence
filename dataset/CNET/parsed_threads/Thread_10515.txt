<s> when should I use the direct and cross link of UTP Cable? </s>
<s> Pls help. </s>
<s> Does it affect wired network and what is the benefit of both. </s>
<s> A crossover cable is needed to connect a PC to a PC or a server to a server -no hub, switch or router needed. </s>
<s> Old hubs/switched hubs were also connected to each other via crossover cable. </s>
<s> But now most modern hardware has autosensing ports that turn into crossover ports when needed. </s>
<s> So the crossover cable is used less frequently. </s>
<s> Choosing the wrong cable will not damage anything. </s>
<s> The connection will simply fail. </s>
