<s> There are four PCs in the house, all running XP and all with wireless Internet access via a 802.11b/g router tied to the DSL modem. </s>
<s> The router has several RJ45 jacks for 'direct' network connection, and I'd like to plug a hard drive into one of these so that any of the PCs could access this &quot;network drive&quot; for backup or to access common files. </s>
<s> I have looked for an appropriate hard drive, but still am not sure what features, etc. </s>
<s> to specify. </s>
<s> Ideally it would 'spin down' if not accessed frequently. </s>
<s> Can someone provide a link to a suitable piece of hardware? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> But don't go too nuts on the size as copying files even at 100Mb tends to test patience at times. </s>
<s> That is, these devices called NAS are on the shelves at the usual stores. </s>
<s> Try one. </s>
