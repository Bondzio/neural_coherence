work properly.
if you have the card and the time to play around, then go ahead.
but that's your choice.
what i often find is these out of date drivers will crash if you try to play some game made after 2001... you also ask &quot;does this mean that this agp 4x card will run on my motherboard that supports up to 2x?
also does this card support 32-bit colour, i've found nothing that says the colour modes this model supports.&quot; 1. if it plugs in.
the cards are keyed to keep you from plugging in an incompatible card.
2. from what i read, yes.
