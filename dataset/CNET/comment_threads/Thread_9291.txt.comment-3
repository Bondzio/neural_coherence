The problem is your router is probably set to G only.
What you need to do is go into your router and change the setting from 54g only to 54g auto.
1. go to router page (default is 192.168.2.1) 2. go to &quot;channel and SSID&quot; on left collum 3.
Under wireless mode, click the arrow and change it to 54G-Auto.
Hope this helps!
