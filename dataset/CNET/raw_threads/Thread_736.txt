When I boot up my system I get the following error message and no control over my mouse. V x D dynamic link call: SCMOUSE (01) + 00001F32 to '000C' Service 7. It is a windows 2000 system. How do I deal with the error. I do not have the original discs as they were lost. Help SupremeGandalf

Have you installed anything lately that may have caused a resource conflict? If so, look in device manager. Start in Safe Mode or navigate with the keyboard. To turn on mouse keys to navigate with the keyboard press Lft Alt+Lft Shift+NumLock. Enter sysedit in the run dialog box. Look at the Config.Sys file for Driver=. If the file is blank, look at the System.Ini file for driver=. Place a semicolon in front of Device= lines. If this doesn't solve the problem your options are limited by the lack of the original disks. You might try buying a USB mouse.
