We have a small home network with this desktop computer and I want to be able to network with my work laptop and a new laptop we plan to buy for home use.
Since our desktop is strained, we are going to get either a Network Attached Storage Drive or a regular external hard drive.
I am reading reviews and suggestions on each but am not sure how I should choose betwen the two.
The high rated, lwer costs NAS is in the $300+ range (on up to very expensive); while the high rated External is in the $175-200 range.
So what would spending the extra $100-$150 for an NAS get me now and in the future when I upgrade things?
Please advise.
Thanks
