1.1.1	Hi, i have a 2TB external hard drive connected to my desktop.A few days ago when i was trying to open a folder on the drive in says &quot;XYZ not accessible.The file or directory is corrupted and unreadable&quot;.	St
1.1.2	Is there a way i can fix the problem with this problem.I'm using windows 7 home premium.	St
1.2.1	I'd boot my Ubuntu CD (it's LIVE!)	St
1.2.2	and see if I can get in there BEFORE ANY DATA RECOVERY APPS are used.	St
1.2.3	Link about -&gt; http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer/ At the top of this forum is the Lost and Found welcome post where you will find apps for free, free to try and recovery services.	St

1.3.1	After you tried the Ubunty trick to copy the files in folder out (maybe better copy ALL files to your backup 2 TB drive) you can try a chkdsk on the drive to do the necessary repairs.	St
1.3.2	A full chkdisk (including surface check) after that won't harm at all.	St
1.3.3	If it happens repeatedly, this might point to a hardware issue or to you handling this drive incorrectly.	St
1.3.4	Let's hope it was a one time glitch that won't happen again the next 5 years.	St
