1.1.1	Hey, I have a fairly great computer with a GTX660 and a i7 3770, but lately one monitor just seems too little, so im upgrading my GPU to a GTX 690 and adding a few monitors to my setup.	St
1.1.2	But of course like any sensable person, I want to be sure that if I put in a 690 it wont **** everything up with Bottlenecking my CPU, so is a i7 3770 capable of keeping up with GTX 690?	St
1.2.1	The i7 3770 CPU should have no problem at all keeping up with it.	St
1.2.2	More of a concern would be the power supply.	St
1.2.3	That card calls for a 650 watt minimum supply It says at full load it draws about 300 watts.	St
1.3.1	&quot;Our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a $225 LGA 1155 Core i5-2500K and a $1000 LGA 2011 Core i7-3960X, even when three-way graphics card configurations are involved.	St
1.3.2	It turns out that memory bandwidth and PCIe throughput don't hold back the performance of existing Sandy Bridge-based machines.	St
