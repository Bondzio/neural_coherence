thanks for the info and the warnings, i am now looking at a dell pentium 4,2.6 ghz, 533 mhz, 512 kb front side bus, l2 cache, intel 845 gu chipset, 16x max dvd w/software decoding, dvd+rw/+r w/cd-rw, 3.5 diskette drive, 512 mb sshared single channel ddr, 333 mhz sdram, 4 dimm slots and a 120 gb hard drive.
does this sound like a fairly decent unit for 2,000.00?
it also has a 3 year in house warranty.
it also comes with a 19&quot; ultra sharp flat panel monitor.
thanks, sky
