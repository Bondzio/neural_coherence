The PC will recognise the JumpDrive on the back USB ports, but not in the front. I've checked in the PC's BIOS, but can't find a special section involving this issue. Suggestions anyone?

Actually, I have a USB hub that is no longer recognizing the drive. It was working fine and then.....nothing. Works in the back though. Any ideas would be helpful.

I bought the 1 GB jumpdrive Traveller from Best Buy and it would not recognize on my laptop. I exchanged it and the same thing resulted. I do own an FMI 512 MB drive from CompUSA - works great; never a problem. I did a test with a USB extension cable (came with my digital camera) and the jumpdrive - worked fine. I found that the jumpdrive does not &quot;fit&quot; very well with my Dell USB ports. It's like a manufacturing defect. It even looks a bit larger than the FMI. The USB cable makes a very snug fit to the jumpdrive therefore works. I will try this drive out on other PC's and if similar results - I will return it and get another manufacturer - maybe and FMI.

I understand your concern regarding the Lexar JumpDrive and this is a known issue with Lexar Jump Drives. please note that Lexar Jump Drive would not work in the front USB ports, this is because the front USB ports are passive ports and do not provide initialization power which may be required by some of the USB devices to function, there is not enough power in the front ports of computer for USB flash drives to work.
