okay, first i want to say that i wasn't saying your answer wasn't the best answer to disregard it, but because i accidentally hit that button when i meant to hit &quot;reply.&quot; at the time, i hadn't even had the chance to look at some of the other comments, so i was a bit annoyed with my clumsy fingers.
in point of fact, i can't at all argue with your comment.
more than one person (on another forum--this issue really has had me tearing my hair out) has stated that this comp's mobo is not exactly top of the line.
also, i was aware before i bought the computer that the psu, while generally reliable, has been known to have quirks.
i did take the initial &quot;simple solution&quot;: pulled the video card, then replaced it and reloaded the drivers.
i am still having some crashes, especially when surfing the web, but so far, the system hasn't out and out crashed.
i'm still quite concerned though, since i haven't loaded any of my video/graphic-intensive programs, yet.
i'll be doing that in the next hour or so.
then we'll see what we see.
i bought this computer with an eye toward doing some upgrades as finances allow, while being able to do work for clients.
with that in mind, any suggestions on a mobo that works with my specs, won't cost me my weight in money, but is a bit up on this one?
likewise, with the psu?
i'm game to make any changes that will give me a smoother experience; i just wasn't planning to have to do so too soon.
