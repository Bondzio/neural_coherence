<s> I have a 2wire DSL modem and last year set up a wireless network for my nearby laptop and my PC downstairs. </s>
<s> Due to problems since day 1 I'd rather have a wired connection downstairs. </s>
<s> I don't care about having a network, sharing files between the two computers, etc. </s>
<s> Can I just connect my PC to the filtered phone jack downstairs? </s>
<s> Can the laptop still be wireless upstairs or does that need to be wired too? </s>
<s> Thanks so much! </s>
<s> While the ISP, DSL based company will be happy to supply you another connection the price here is double since you would need 2 DSL lines. </s>
<s> Is a powerline bridge a solution available in your part of the world? </s>

<s> Thank you Bob! </s>
<s> Are you saying DSL service is for one computer only? </s>
<s> I thought it came into the house and you could use any phone jack to receive the signal and, thus, have more than one computer at a time receiving the signal. </s>
<s> Thanks,Pam </s>
<s> It's from them to your DSL modem which goes to what you want. </s>
<s> You could move the DSL modem but you only get one until they set you up. </s>
<s> This is why almost everybody gets a router or DSL providers supply it in their box. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks again for the clarification Bob. </s>
<s> So, I'd have to run a wire from the 2wire gateway to my laptop nearby and to my PC downstairs. </s>
<s> That's not too practical. </s>
<s> I guess I will have to work on restoring the wireless connection on my PC downstairs, a topic for another forum! </s>
