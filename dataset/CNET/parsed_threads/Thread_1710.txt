<s> Hello, this is my first post. </s>
<s> I have a continuous problem with my PC. </s>
<s> It keeps restarting itself. </s>
<s> PC SPECS: - XP Professional - 2.20ghz - 400w PSU - 80gig Hard Drive - DVDRW Drive - 2 x 512 DDR Ram - ATI Radeon 9200 Graphics Card - Linksys Wireless Network Adaptor - Firewire PCI Card Everytime I try and do something on my PC it restarts itself. </s>
<s> For example if i play a game, if i burn a CD/DVD. </s>
<s> i have a DVD creating software that came with the firewire card that i use to burn homemade DVDs (well i try to anyway) and during the burning process, it restarts. </s>
<s> i have a gut feeling that its my 400w PSU. </s>
<s> i'm saying this because it has thermal control. </s>
<s> ive tryed to disable thermal control in my BIOS, but i cant get to that specific setting. </s>
<s> What really gets to me is that when i try and change my screen resolution from display settings, it restarts. </s>
<s> i have a strong feeling that its my PSU. </s>
<s> Help!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> save ur files and then restore ur os i had the same problem on my gateway. </s>
<s> i asked gateway support and they said its a virus and i said that norton didnt find it? </s>
<s> i cleared my hard drive and it never restarted by itself again konny </s>
<s> I have actually formatted my computer many times. </s>
<s> i have even put a new hard drive in. </s>
<s> same problem. </s>
<s> alright thats querky if i may say. </s>
<s> i would trust ur gut and try replacing the power supply, go antec or another high quality brand. </s>
<s> i got antec true 480, it is unbeliebably silent, my 120mm fans r louder than it! </s>
<s> konny </s>
<s> How can 400watt power supply not be enough? </s>
<s> Don't listen to him! </s>
<s> Chances are, there's something wrong with the motherboard. </s>
<s> Such things are what usually cause crashes when the load gets heavy. </s>
<s> But the post is too slim on details to call it either way. </s>
<s> -&gt; The one area you learn never to skimp is the power supply. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Overheating processor perhaps. </s>
<s> 2.2 GHz AMD Athlon 64 not pentium 4 right? </s>
<s> If it is an AMD Athon 64 that could be your issue. </s>
<s> Try to get at least 2 case fans for your computer and make sure your heatsink/fan are properly situated on the processor. </s>
<s> A good way to lower temps and cheap is to apply arctic silver 5 compound. </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> Is that like a hair regrowth forumla? </s>
<s> &quot;What is Google?&quot; or rather, using google.com I find what this item is. </s>
<s> Have you discovered this search engine yet? </s>
<s> No offense, but your posts tend to make you seem new to PCs. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> So you're supposed to put some kind of gooey goo on your cpu... ^_____^ </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=how+to+install+cpu+heatsink It's a well documented procedure. </s>
<s> Pick an article you like. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Seriously, does it even work? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Before I start, if you are to offer advice in forums this basic principle would not be a question from you. </s>
<s> Time to ask for help and learn more. </s>
<s> -&gt; The issue for thermal paste is simple. </s>
<s> Any small air gap will not conduct heat very well. </s>
<s> The paste/goo fills in that gap and the heat moves. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> After reading all the posts. </s>
<s> I would try the a new PSU as the first thing to do. </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> thanks john, i thought of doing that myself. </s>
<s> currently i have a 400w PSU, should i get another 400w PSU or something bigger. </s>
<s> And if i do buy a new one, what are the chances of the problem continuing? </s>
<s> It was that sorry other person that derailed us a little. </s>
<s> For now you can just lighten the load by dropping back to 1 hard disk, 1 CD or DVD drive and leaving the case cover off to see if its heat or power related. </s>
<s> Be sure to keep an eye open for any bulging or leaking motherboard capacitors. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> capaciters.....??? </s>
<s> Sorry but thats a new term for me. </s>
<s> explain! </s>
<s> Capacitors look like little ''batteries'' or ''cylinders'' on the motherboard. </s>
<s> When the motherboard is subject to overheating or a short occurs, the capacitors will appear bulged or in extreme cases, will burst and leak on to the board causing a multitude of problems.When this happens you need to replace the motherboard. </s>
<s> This happened to my system a while ago, I had to buy a new motherboard. </s>
<s> System temperature monitoring (tower case) is important to maintain in order to protect the components. </s>
<s> Ohhhh. </s>
<s> I was wondering what those were. </s>
<s> how can one spot a burst capacitor? </s>
<s> and speaking of motherboards, can anyone recommend a decent motherboard (2.2ghz and above) but i have a slight cash flow problem. </s>
<s> cheers </s>
<s> Like tires & brakes, never skimp on the power supply. </s>
<s> Those &quot;400 watt&quot; ain't necessarily so. </s>
<s> ...are usually power related or heat related, sometimes both. </s>
<s> PCs have thermal protection in many places. </s>
<s> If you built the rig yourself check the thermal paste. </s>
<s> I had a LGA775 proc go wonky on me because I didn't have one of its &quot;legs&quot; properly secured, another PC went to spontaneous reboots because the PSU's cooling fan was failing. </s>
<s> More than likely it's the PSU, PC Power & Cooling (www.pcpowerandcooling.com ) or Antec are excellent, I'm using a Zalman low-noise unit. </s>
<s> Rule of thumb: If the PSU came with the case, pull it out & keep it for a spare, get a real one for your rig. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
