1.1.1	As the subject title says , I 'm trying to build a good gaming computer , and I do n't meant top of the line , just something that will allow me to run games such as oblivion/call of duty 4/bioshock with ease .	St
1.1.2	Only problem is , I do n't know a whole lot about computers as far as compatibility goes with the hardware .	St
1.1.3	So I 'm getting my computer off a site and I 'll just list what I have in the works and if anybody has free time , I 'd appreciate the input .	St
1.1.4	600 Watt -- Power Supply SLI Ready Intel Core 2 Quad Processor Q6600 ( 4x 2.4GHz/8MB L2 Cache/1066FSB ) OR Intel Core 2 Duo Processor E6850 ( 2x 3.0GHz/4MB L2 Cache/1333FSB ) Extreme-Performance INTEL CPU Cooling Fan System Kit Asus P5N-E SLI nForce 650i SLI Chipset w/6-channel CODEC , Gb LAN , S-ATA Raid , USB 2.0 , IEEE-1394 Dual PCI-E MB 2048MB [ 1024MB X2 ] DDR2-800 PC6400 Memory Module NVIDIA GeForce 8500GT 512MB yeah ... thats it..and a cd drive which i know will work .	St
1.2.1	Go for the quad .	St
1.2.2	Install windows and slim it down to only what you need .	St
1.2.3	Add another gig of RAM .	St
1.2.4	Get a good sound card .	St
1.2.5	An external hard drive for the games .	St
1.3.1	With the 8500gt , i doubt that will run those games with ease .	St
1.3.2	Get at least an 8600gt .	St
1.3.3	It 's $ 50 after rebates at newegg.com last i checked .	St
1.3.4	I also suggest looking at the new E8xx core 2 duos .	St
1.3.5	This seems more like a budget gaming system , and will handle most games , good luck .	St
1.4.1	Really ?	Ques
1.4.2	Link to ONE good sound card , under $ 100 that actually has decent drivers for xp and vista .	St
1.4.3	I 'll wait here for a couple of months .	St
1.5.1	unless there are availablity problems , the e6850 should be replaced with an e8400 ( $ 200 vs $ 190 ) .	St
1.5.2	although the e8400 is the same clockspeed ( 3ghz ) it 's larger cache makes it faster it runs cooler .	St
1.5.3	the e8400 will give you better performance in most games than the q6600 .	St
1.5.4	the only exceptions will be unreal tourney 3 and supreme commander in which case they 'll be about equal .	St
1.5.5	http : //www.xbitlabs.com/articles/cpu/display/core2quad-q9300_9.html # sect0 how much is the & quot ; Extreme-Performance INTEL CPU Cooling Fan System Kit & quot ; ?	Ques
1.5.6	if it 's more than $ 20 , stick with the retail cooler or go for an arctic cooling freezer 7 pro ( about $ 30 ) : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16835186134 lastly , as mentioned earlier , the 8500gt is not a good gaming card and will struggle in new games .	St
1.5.7	the minimum card you should consider are geforce 8800gs/384mb ( $ 130 , http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814150294 ) , radeon hd 3850/512mb ( $ 130 , http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814102715 ) , and geforce 9600gt/256mb ( $ 150 , http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814133216 ) .	Ques
1.5.8	with one of these cards , you 'll be able to handle most any game on up to a 20 & quot ; widescreen .	St
1.5.9	an 8600gts is about $ 100 , but either the 8800gs or hd 3850 will give you 50-70 % better performance .	St
1.6.1	http : //www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-Details.asp ? EdpNo=3876389 & cm_mmc=Email-_-Main-_-WEM1623-_-Components & SRCCODE=WEM1623C this barebones has very good components .	St
1.6.2	if you can cope with the rebate , this would make a good gamer when paired with a 9600gt/8800gt or better .	St
1.7.1	And look in shoppimng .	St
1.7.2	Creative Labs sells quite a few .	St
1.7.3	Me , I run Linux and FreeBSD .	St
1.7.4	I have ALSA , aRTS , Pulseaudio , and OSS running .	St
1.7.5	I have a SB card .	St
1.7.6	I can run multiple streams on it .	St
1.7.7	Much more than a game on any Windows platform .	St
1.7.8	You 're worried about drivers and support ?	Ques
1.7.9	Build the drivers ans database for the hardware .	St
1.8.1	Look for one and ask in a gaming or streaming server forum as to which is better for the price you want to pay .	St
1.9.1	says the graphics on that one is EVGA nForce 650i Ultra is that as good as an 8800gt or so ?	Ques
1.9.2	also 400 bucks is alot better than what i was going to spend at ibuypower.com It was going to come with speakers , mouse , and a keyboard .	St
1.9.3	All that with what i listed in my first post came to a bit over 800 , with shipping 900 .	St
1.9.4	But I suppose if money is the problem here , I could just buy the pc and use the speakers/mouse/keyboard i have now and gradually upgrade .	St
1.10.1	oh wait , the EVGA nForce 650i Ultra I think is the motherboard , hah Also I dont think it comes with a graphics card or disc trays ... and no cooling fan , lol , but I 'm sure those are cheap and in supply at best buy .	St
1.11.1	you 'll overpay unless you catch a great sale .	St
1.11.2	if by & quot ; disk tray & quot ; you mean cd/dvd burner , then best buy will be competitive .	St
1.11.3	if want a 8800gt , this one is hard to beat since it includes a game and is only $ 154 before $ 30 rebate : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814125089 here 's a good cooler for $ 30 : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16835186134	Ques
1.12.1	greatly appreciated	Polite
1.13.1	I 'm sure the 8800GT 256MB is better than the 8600GT 512MB and if i get that tower it will have a quad core and 2GB of RAM .	St
1.13.2	So hopefully i can run the newer pc games like a cheap beast	St
1.14.1	Get a decent P35 motherboard that will properly support the 45nm e8400-e8500 processors .	St
1.14.2	If you just have to have an SLI motherboatd you would need to get the 750i variant to properly support the newer 45NM like this board here http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16813131232 A good Intel board with a single 16x PCIe slot Gigabyte ( GIGABYTE GA-EP35-DS3L ) will do the trick .	St
1.14.3	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16813128337 The Palit 9600GT will play modern games 5x better than the 8500GT will and it 's affordable .	St
1.14.4	http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16814261002	Ques
