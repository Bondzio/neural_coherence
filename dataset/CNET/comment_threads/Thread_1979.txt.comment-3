so Kindle Fire might be the way to go.
I haven't taken mine on a trip yet, but I intend to this winter!
It sends and receives email just fine.
It holds it's charge for a long time, too.
The only thing that I'll miss is the ability to transfer the photos that I take onto the tablet.
My existing Netbook is sometimes a hassle to transport, but I love the ability to transfer my photos, evaluate them, and do a little basic editing before I get home, but this trip I know that I'll feel less burdened down with stuff.
If we had the budget we could buy a tablet that could do all these things and more, but I'd prefer to spend the $$ on travel.
