data cable connected firmly to drive and motherboard?
data cable connected backwards?
power cable connected to drive?
did the drive ever work properly?
does the drive appear in the bios?
if not you need to change some bios settings.
i assume this is a standard internal 3.5&quot; floppy drive and not a usb drive or 5.25 floppy drive.
correct?
