Here's the adapter I bought: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16812206002 I connected the female molex into the HD but the other molex doesnt' connect with the SATA power cable. It seems as if I need a 4 pin female to 15 pin SATA power adapter but can't seem to find one. Any suggestions would be highly appreciated.

I agree--just connect the standard 4-pin Molex connector to the power adapter cable included with the device. Connect the other ends of the power adapter cable to the hard drive and the device.

Installed it and then looked in device manager and realized I have a Ultra ATA Controller. It's installed and works but because the controller is Ultra ATA I assume I am only going to get the old school speed of up to 100mb/per second. Could have saved a few dollars maybe if I had done my research though. FYI Western Digital Internal Hard Drive (WD2500KS) 300mb/s 16mb cache $89 at Circuit City

Also remember that both SATA and PATA BOTH are, IN FACT, IDE drives. Hope that over time we start using PATA and SATA. Hey Ahtoi, if you are Art from the zdnet forums, hello old friend.
