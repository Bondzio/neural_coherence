1.2.1	Such as what router you have and did you set it up like we ask at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7589_102-0.html?forumID=62&threadID=264135&messageID=2584349&tag=forums06;forum-threads I know a few that use their neighbors wifi and for them, that scanning is normal since you're never sure the neighbor's wifi is on.

1.3.1	I live in a basement apartment with my internet done through my landlady's router upstairs.	St
1.3.2	Do not want to get her involved.I have a wireless laptop which i can use instead of my desktop and does not involve the linskeys.	St
1.3.3	I was just wondering what scanning it is doing on the desktop and if i can stop it from scanning and still use the internet.	St
1.3.4	What is it scanning for?	St
1.3.5	maybe signal strength is too low?	St
1.4.1	Since you don't own the router, connection and being in a basement doesn't help matters at all.	St
1.4.2	Nothing wrong here.	St
