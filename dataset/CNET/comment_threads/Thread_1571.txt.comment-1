I installed a new generic PSU into my new Acer.
The computer boots up when the power strip is switched on(without pressing the on button).
The computer runs fine after booting, but when shut down the power supply fan keeps spinning.
My local computer store thinks that Acer may need a special Acer PSU.
What should I try next?
