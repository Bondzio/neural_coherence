Just a small comment, Unless you really need all those jacks active in each room you can use a data jack as a phone jack.
The phone cables which use a small 6 pin connector will work just fine in the 8 pin data jacks.
You of course must connect the other end to a phone cable also.
Only the center 4 pin line up 3,4,5,6 line up with 2,3,4,5.
This is the standard phone cable where the outer 2 pins are not used.
