<s> I purchased a Western Digital eSata external drive and hooked it up to my MacBook Pro using a SIIG eSata-to-Express34 Controller. </s>
<s> I formatted the drive using Disk Utility. </s>
<s> I find that I can read from the drive fine. </s>
<s> But whenever I try to save any large files into the drive, it stops copying after a while. </s>
<s> The drive has a USB interface as well, and I can read/write from the drive just fine using the USB. </s>
<s> But writes fail whenever I use the e-Sata interface. </s>
<s> What can be the problem? </s>
<s> While I would have opted for a firewire interface on a Mac any day of the week, esata while promising is still on a shake down cruise. </s>
<s> You didn't do anything wrong. </s>
<s> Ask for your money back since I take it they didn't offer any support. </s>

<s> I know it's a new technology, but it's catching up fast. </s>
<s> Now, I don't think it's a problem with the hard drive since I've tested two external e-Sata drives and both show the same problem. </s>
<s> Someone out there must have faced the same problem. </s>
<s> They'll either have a new driver, firmware or admit to the issue. </s>
<s> While these forums are good this one is still a new thing that isn't working out of the box for everyone. </s>
<s> The only way to fix this is to return defective stuff. </s>
