so apple just released a bunch of new laptop upgrades, and the all new macbook air.
but wait.
i bought my laptop in september (white macbook) and i got a apple remote when i bought it.
now, for all the laptops, including the macbook pro, you need to pay an additional 20 bucks when you are purchasing it at the apple store online.
now i love macs, and it think the remote was a cool feature and partially justified the high price tag.
but now they are making you pay for it?
why?
does anyone else notice this?
