<s> Hey fellow people, I have a system board that is giving me problems, I was wondering if anyone knew of any utilities that will help me test the hardware (IDE bus, memory, CPU etc.). </s>
<s> It boots up fine but fails on copying the files while installing windows. </s>
<s> I have tried various cd's and even changed drives, and also memory. </s>
<s> Thanks for your assistance. </s>

<s> Could you include your motherboard type and all that stuff please? </s>
