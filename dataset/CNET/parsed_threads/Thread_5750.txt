<s> I recently bought a 2.5in USB II External HD (40Gb) after a trip to Hong Kong. </s>
<s> I intended to use it as a back up drive for all my documents. </s>
<s> I was told by the vendor that it was like a USB flash memory stick (simply plug n play) and this was also what the instruction manual told me. </s>
<s> However (suprise, suprise) I'm having difficulties. </s>
<s> As soon as I connect it up my computer (New Sony Vaio FS series with Windows XP Home) registers it as a 'removable USB Mass Storage Device' but when I look in 'My Computer', there is no associated drive icon for it. </s>
<s> Following advice from Microsoft Support, I've looked in 'Computer Management' under 'Administrative Tools - Control Setup' and it's there, but labelled as: 'Disk 1 - No Media' as oppossed to my main hard Hard Disk [Disk 0 - Recovery Partition 6.99Gb EISA Config, VAIO(C: ) 27.95Gb NTFS & VAIO(D: ) 58.23Gb NTFS]. </s>
<s> Looking at the forums here and at Microsoft Support pages, I get the feeling I need to Partition and Format this disk, but I'm a little bewildered by the instructions Microsoft are giving about using Fdisk and Format tools. </s>
<s> Am I on the right track and can anyone give me clear instructions? </s>

<s> Well XP dosen't have fdisk. </s>
<s> Noe go back into 'Computer Management' under 'Administrative Tools - Control Setup' and it's there, but labelled as:Disk 1 Now you will have right click on it, set as active, then format it. </s>
