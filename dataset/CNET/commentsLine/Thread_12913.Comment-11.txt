back 'in the day' we went to great lengths to eliminate esd.
after leaving 'the industry', in my home usage i make sure i take the basic precautions, although devices are much better protected (internally) than they used to be.
when i work on pcs, i just wire my wrist to the ground lug on the outlet box, and make sure the pc is also connected to same.
i never pick up a board/component unless both connections are made.
about soldering irons - don't use the cheapos that are just the 2-prong versions.....think about it...there's 120v there, maybe the tip of the iron isn't quite neutral...use a good iron system (weller comes to mind) most good irons will have the tip connected to earth ground.
the whole idea is that you & the board/computer are always at the same potential.
keep in mind that most static is generated when you get up from your chair/desk etc...after you get up, don't touch anything unless/until you are again grounded.
