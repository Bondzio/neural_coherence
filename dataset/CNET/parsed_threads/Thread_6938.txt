<s> Lately, I've had a problem with my display when scrolling pages (on and off-line) and when dragging windows around. </s>
<s> It'll go black and my monitor seems to reset and displace text and images when it reappears. </s>
<s> I use Windows XP. </s>
<s> I don't know if this is a hardware problem, but it really annoys me. </s>
<s> Has anyone seen this before? </s>
<s> Lately? </s>
<s> Use XP's System Restore to the day before the issue began to rule out the software angle. </s>

<s> My System Restore won't display dates beore the month of November. </s>
<s> My problem begamn in early October. </s>
<s> I try to click the back arrows, but it won't o back. </s>
<s> You get to face the possibility that the OS may be reinstalled. </s>
<s> Before that, have your XP CD handy and run... SFC /SCANNOW If it still fails after a reboot, then research your video card make/model, go download and install the latest drivers, install, reboot and retest. </s>
<s> Best of luck, Bob </s>
