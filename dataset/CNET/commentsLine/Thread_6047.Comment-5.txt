golly gosh, i thank you sooo much for your interest and help.
i just this minute walked in my front door from being out of town for 5 days.
(in dallas-now back to new orleans).
will unpack all the dirty laundry tonight, wash, be too tired and finally get a flashlight and look at the back of the monitor tomorrow...lol.
