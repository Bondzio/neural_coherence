Recently setup trendnet router.
Know nothing about wireless networking.
I disconnect network from the internet when not on line by turning the external cable modem off on the box the cable co. installed.
After I turn the box back on the router must &quot;repair&quot; the connection.
Is there a check box or something else I can do that would simplify this?
Please make answer for wireless impaired person.
Thanks Jan
