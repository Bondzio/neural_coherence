<s> Wireless security setting (beside standard PC security settings) 1. </s>
<s> Use WPA instead of WEP Pro(s): more secure, more password strenght, currently its harder to hack. </s>
<s> Con(s): Not every device are compatible (have not use WPA) yet. </s>
<s> Each device need to &quot;ADD&quot; manually (ssid name and password) to connect to the network. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Use Mac address filtering Pro(s): Only device with assigned Mac Address will connect. </s>
<s> Con(s): You have to add each new device Mac Address, for them to connect. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Disable SSID Broadcast Pro(s): Supposedly invisible, so you have to &quot;ADD&quot; manually Con(s): You need to broadcast your SSID, in order for new device setting... (then disable broadcasting again, after the device have been setup) 4. </s>
<s> Change your SSID and Password regularly Pro(s): Self explained Con(s): resetting all devices that want to connect (Add Wireless connection and typing new password) 5. </s>
<s> TURN OFF your Access Point when not in use. </s>
<s> Pro(s): &quot;The Most&quot; Secured thing to do. </s>
<s> Limiting the &quot;stolen&quot; bandwidth connection time. </s>
<s> Con(s): Everyone who need the connection, must have access to the Access Point device location... to turn it ON. </s>
<s> Note: this will be best, IF the device that need wireless are in one location, so the Wireless access point can be place nearby. </s>
<s> 6. </s>
<s> Prepared a Hard Wired connection (if possible) in all location as needed... as a backup. </s>
<s> Note: Just one Cable (from the router) + a Switch + Straight Cable (lenght as needed, from device to the switch), So anyone need a hardwired connection can plug the cable to the switch, in the location... (doesn't need to run several long cable to the router) 7. </s>
<s> Use a monitoring software, if needed (need a little more knowledge to keep an eye on the software and to understand what was going on) 8. any additional tips? </s>
<s> General Tips: 1. </s>
<s> Place your Access Point in the least obstructive location, a little high near the ceiling, if possible. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Microwave, Cordless phone etc. </s>
<s> can affect your Access Point signal, Keep it in separate location... or look for different frequency range for those devices. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Place your Range Expander (if any) in the middle between your Access Point and your wireless devices. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Experiment by changing the device position or turning the Antenna, for best signal strenght. </s>
<s> 5. any additional tips? </s>
<s> Thank You </s>
<s> Many do these things and then complain a range expander doesn't work. </s>
<s> KNOW what you are doing? </s>
<s> Broadcast or not to Broadcast? </s>
<s> is there an easy tips on this? </s>
<s> Because many said Not to broadcast... how do we deal with the 'range expander' problem, if we choose to Not broadcasting SSID. </s>
<s> Thank You again </s>
<s> But the issue is simple. </s>
<s> If one does all this and it doesn't work (as in the case of the expander), then one needs a little education on &quot;how things work&quot;. </s>
<s> I wonder why the no broadcast SSID is debated heavily. </s>
<s> I will NOT enter into any debate but will share that the SSID is going to picked off if packets are flying. </s>
<s> All it does is make the system a little more quiet and stealthy. </s>

<s> LucidLink Wireless Security is based upon the most current security technologies available today, including 802.X, 802.11i, WPA, WPA2, and RADIUS. </s>
<s> LucidLink just announced a free offer of it's $99 wireless security software called Lucid Link. </s>
<s> http://www.lucidlink.com/ It received Wi-Fi Planets best of show award twice! </s>

<s> ....There must be a hard wired computer on the network to use as the &quot;permission giver&quot; AND it must be turned ON. </s>
<s> That's not always workable on a home network. </s>

<s> Look how 'secure' windows is not that I would be suggesting same with this product having never used it. </s>
<s> I had a look at there site and I am not really sure what it does? </s>
<s> Does it set up and manage AP for you? </s>

<s> I probably should download and play </s>
