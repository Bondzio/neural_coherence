i do a little video editing and some fairly-sophisticated perl and java animations of my own designs, and do these with the built-in video card on my (2gb, athlon x2) system.
i suspect, but don't really know,that the performance of both would be enhanced by a little better video card.
at heavy loads, the pc did not quite keep up with the animations till i added the second gb of memory, and i am thinking to go to even-more sophisticated animations in the future.
it's hard for me to understand why anyone except an extreme gamer would need more than a $100 video adapter.
