I used to be an avid PC gamer back in the day, but was forced to (briefly) retire due to my responsibilities at college. The fact that my roommate owned a PS3 didn't help either. Regardless, I've gotten to a point where I would like to begin upgrading my computer for use with today's PC games. Obviously things have changed in my absence, and I could use some help getting back to speed. I've got an old emachines computer, of which I've replaced many of the parts. Hopefully the HDD, DVD/CD drives, and RAM could be re-used, however, the motherboard/processor and video card need to be replaced. That being said, what are some qualities one would look for in a motherboard? RAM, PCI-E, and processor slots are all key I'm sure, but am I missing anything? Would anyone be able to recommend a good processor/motherboard combo? One final question; what are are most efficient video cards these days? I'm sure NVidia/Raedon are still big players - could anyone give me some advice on those? Thanks for your time & help.
