<s> I am trying to access data on a USB external hard drive (Western Digital WD800U017-001). </s>
<s> The data was put on with a Mac. </s>
<s> I am trying to access it with a PC. </s>
<s> In Device Manager, I can see the drive. </s>
<s> In Disk Management, I can see the drive but it has no letter assigned. </s>
<s> When I write click the only options available are Delete Partition and Help. </s>
<s> It will not let me Change Drive Letter and Paths. </s>
<s> If I try to use the diskpart utility from command prompt, I can see the drive with list disk and list partition but not with list volume. </s>
<s> If I try to use the add or create volume simple commands I get a message that says &quot;The command you selected is not available with this version of Windows.&quot; My computer is: Windows Home XP + SP2 AMD Athalon 1500+, 512 MB RAM, ASUS A8V266-E Motherboard USB 1.0 It is six years old. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> One other thing I forgot to say was that the drive has no name. </s>
<s> No name appears in Disk Management. </s>
<s> Sorry, I found the solution here: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/925196 Something to do with a corrupted registry key. </s>
<s> I can see it now. </s>
<s> I can't access the data but I can see it in My Computer at least. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> To access the data I found a program called MacDrive. </s>
<s> It has a free trial for a week but its pay after that. </s>
<s> The free trial is plenty for me but does anyone know a freeware program that does the same job? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> The website to get MacDrive is http://www.mediafour.com/ </s>
