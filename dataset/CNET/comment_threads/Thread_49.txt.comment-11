2-I found that there is a mild high pitched electrical buzz when i plug the PSU into the mains with the system off...that cant be normal, can it?
I probably cant hear it when i boot as the other noise is louder... Actually that is normal for some designs.
If the machine is in a very quiet place and you have good ears today's PC PSUs (your wtx, atx, etc.)
produces a 5 volt or other standby voltage to power up the motherboard power control circuit.
If you were an electronics type person you might disassemble the PSU and shellac the components that could buzz.
Coils for example are a prime candidate for such a coating.
