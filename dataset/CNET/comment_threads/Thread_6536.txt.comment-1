I have a Dell Dimension 2400 and I was board one day so I opened up the case (not the first time).
While I was doing so I decided to move a PCI card over one slot to give my video card a bit more room to breath when I noticed that there was something that seems to be a layout for putting an AGP slot in.
It is slighty farther back then the PCI slots (like all the AGP slots I have seen on motherboards) and it is the top slot (if there was a slot).
To get to the point, is it possible to buy an AGP slot so I can use AGP video cards?
