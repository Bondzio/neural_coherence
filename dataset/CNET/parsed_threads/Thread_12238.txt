<s> I just aquired an HP 7100 notebook and want to send printing wirelessly. </s>
<s> I have an Imac desktop which is connected to a wireless router from Roadrunner and I cannot get the HP to tranfer what I want printed from a remote location. </s>
<s> The printer is an HP Photosmart model #7960 which is connected by USB to the Imac which is running OX 10. </s>
<s> The note book is running XP </s>
<s> I will not help on this one. </s>
<s> It's too far out to help remotely since not only must you deal with cross-OS issues but the Wifi as well. </s>
<s> Unless you get lucky, you'll either pay to have it setup or install a wifi USB printer server that supports your selected machines. </s>
