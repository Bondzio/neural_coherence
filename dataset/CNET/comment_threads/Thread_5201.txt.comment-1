Ok.
I download movie torrents and the cinavia is having a big impact on my streaming to my ps3.
Should I buy a set top box with streaming capabilities?
Or a video card with HDMI out and buy a really long HDMI cable?
I like the ability to control what i watch from the couch.
The set top box would let me do that.
If i go the video card route, is there a way to control my pc from the couch?
