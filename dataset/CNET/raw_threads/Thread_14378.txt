The user manual (and I use that term very lightly!) says that it adjusts from -5 to +15. I can't for the life of me figure out how to do it. It doesn't tell you, just to be careful not to hurt your fingers. I emailed Acer support three days ago and didn't get an answer. It is hard to find contact info for their support--not a good sign. Can anyone help? Thanks!

Place your left hand on the bottom of the monitor and your right hand on the top of the monitor. Holding onto the top and the bottom of the monitor. While holding the base level, GENTLY push your left hand away and bring your right hand forward. To tilt monitor backward bring left hand towards you and push right hand away.
