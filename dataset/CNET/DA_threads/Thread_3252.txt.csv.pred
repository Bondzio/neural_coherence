1.1.1	I will be graduating from college in May and my parents have decided to buy my a new computer for a graduation gift ( ... did n't really expect one but ca n't say no if they offer ) .	St
1.1.2	They said that they would be willing to shell out $ 2000 and I could possibly add another $ 1000- $ 1500 onto that because I really want to get an amazing computer right now that will last me a while .	St
1.1.3	$ 3000- $ 3500 is n't enough for a quad core , so I 'm looking at Core 2 Duos , like the E6600 , something with 4 MB cache .	St
1.1.4	I also would like to get a high end graphics card ( something that I would be able to play games on for a while like the new GeForce 8800s ) and either 2 or 4 GB RAM .	St
1.1.5	I 've looked at several companies , but have ruled out Dell and Gateway now because I ca n't really find what I 'm looking for at a price I 'd want .	St
1.1.6	Other companies that I 've looked at were Velocity Micro , Polywell , Mediagear , ABS , and Cyberpower PC .	St
1.1.7	Cyberpower PC seems to have the best deal , but I 've read lots of user reviews about them , most not good and include PCs DOA .	St
1.1.8	So I wanted to see what other people think about which company I should go with based on their experiences with the different companies out there .	St
1.1.9	I 've been impressed so far with Polywell and ABS but do n't know much about them .	St
1.1.10	I 'm also open to other suggestions of companies to look at .	St
1.1.11	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	building ur own comp ?	Ques
1.2.2	its well worth it because u get to choose the parts u want in it and almost every aspect of your pc .	St
1.2.3	u can make one heck of a pc with 2 grand man .	Sug
1.2.4	and even if u dont know how to build one just go to comp usa or your local pc shop and they will assemble it for you for a small price .	Sug
1.2.5	hope this helps goodluck with your pc	St
1.3.1	I build , mostly because I then at least know what is there .	St
1.3.2	The OS disk will be complete and the drivers will be the right ones for at least the first time I turn the PC on .	St
1.3.3	I use AMD when I build .	St
1.3.4	Many of the computers I have had to fix using computer companies restore disks leave me wondering what I have installed .	St
1.3.5	Over the years I have come up with some things to look for when buying/shopping for a main stream PC .	St
1.3.6	Often my gaming computer of today becomes my workhorse computer 6 months to a year later , so I would buy with that in mind .	St
1.3.7	Look at the next generation operating system and look at what are the minimum specifications to run the newest software that you might be interested in using .	St
1.3.8	Try and find out if the new computer can be up-graded .	St
1.3.9	It should come with a restore disk system .	St
1.3.10	You need to read carefully to see what is shipped , some companies require you to burn your own restore CDs or charge more for restore disks .	St
1.3.11	Hard drives fail and this restore system is needed if you fail to have a backup system in place that is self-installing/bootable ( without operating system in place ) .	St
1.3.12	Most restore systems work by formatting the drive so you will lose your data .	St
1.3.13	If you want the computer back the way you had it you must have a good backup system in place and use it .	St
1.3.14	The software bundled with the PC should be what you want not OEM ( original equipment manufacturer ) software that has a poor uninstall track record and may not have all the features you want .	St
1.3.15	I have had to remove OEM anti-virus software at the registry level so watch out for this ( I have done this on 2 Compaq computers ) .	St
1.3.16	I would go with as little as possible installed software and then purchase exactly what you want later .	St
1.3.17	This way when you install after a crash you will have the software on hand and your chance of getting support is more likely if you have a retail copy of the software .	St
1.3.18	OEM add on cards will work but , watch out , some companies make a point not to support their OEM products versus their retail products .	St
1.3.19	I once had new drivers to install but because the sound card was OEM the company that built the computer had to supply the drivers .	St
1.3.20	The company that had their name on the card denied me the use of their new drivers .	St
1.3.21	I had to keep the old drivers .	St
1.3.22	Dont get fancy OEM optical drives installed .	St
1.3.23	I have found that external USB optical drives are more usable for me because I can move them around and if they dont work I can take them back to the store without opening the case and voiding the warranty .	St
1.3.24	I have also had OEM optical drives that almost worked , I mean the drive would do just enough that I could not ask for a new one but not as good as I needed .	St
1.3.25	Keep in mind that specs do n't tell all .	St
1.3.26	Check posts of customer 's to see if there are problems that you ca n't work around .	St
1.3.27	Do this by finding the model number of the computer you are interested in and do a search on it .	St
1.3.28	Read the posts that seem to show problem areas .	St
1.3.29	In the past , I have found complaints about slow remote controls to motherboards being replaced .	St
1.3.30	( From your post you are already doing this . )	St
1.3.31	The goal of the company selling the computer is to keep cost low and one way they do this is by using a small/weak power supply ( and some other components ) .	St
1.3.32	They select the power supply size by what the power consumption specs of the parts it is sold with use .	St
1.3.33	The computer will usually work until you up grade with a power hungry video card or additional hard drives .	St
1.3.34	This often shows up as failed boot ups , sometimes requiring 3 boots before the computer is stable or artifacts appearing on the screen from nowhere .	St
1.3.35	So keep this in mind when planning to up grade your main stream PC , a new high power video card may require a new bigger power supply .	St
1.3.36	If the new PC arrives and you dont like it take it back .	St
1.3.37	I have returned as many as 3 PCs when buying just one .	St
1.3.38	I took one back because it was broken out of the box .	St
1.3.39	2 more because the software I wanted to run would not run , by the specs the software should have run .	St
1.3.40	I went through 2 model upgrades and 2 computer companies before I found what I wanted and that had to be built to order .	St
1.3.41	This was made easier by the computer store I used being next door to where I worked .	St
1.3.42	When returning the PCs I used the supplied restore disks to clean them up .	St
1.3.43	More thoughts when buying direct or online .	St
1.3.44	1 .	St
1.3.45	Read the return polices of the vendors you are interested in with the idea you may have to use their return policy .	St
1.3.46	Look for full refund not just exchanges .	St
1.3.47	2 .	St
1.3.48	When prices are close , watch for low price computer but high handling and shipping fees .	St
1.3.49	3 .	St
1.3.50	Watch for OS being preloaded with no OS CD included , may need to pay more for real CD .	St
1.3.51	If you ask for real OS CD and pay for it , make sure you get it .	St
1.3.52	4 .	St
1.3.53	Dont throw away the packaging , you may need it to move it or to send it back .	St
1.3.54	5 .	St
1.3.55	Do n't forget to get a UPS to plug the new computer into .	Sug
1.3.56	Clean power into the the computer will extend it life and keep crashes due to power failures at bay .	St
1.3.57	I have onwed Compaq , Gateway , HP , and Dell .	St
1.3.58	All of them worked but I was never happy with them and that is why I build my own now .	St
1.3.59	The perfect PC is just a compromise of what you want and what you can get .	St
1.3.60	Good luck	Polite
1.4.1	They 've been doing reviews of gaming desktops while posing as a 'regular ' buyer , not a review site .	St
1.4.2	So , they tell you how well a system performs and how well the vendor did assembling , shipping , and supporting the system .	St
1.4.3	http : //consumer.hardocp.com/reviews.html ? cat=MjUsRGVza3RvcCBDb21wdXRlcnMsaGNvbnN1bWVy	Ques
1.5.1	I 'd recommend going with the highest clock speed Core 2 Duo you can get , if you are going to build your desktop .	St
1.5.2	With that huge budget , you should try to get two nVidia 8800 GTX graphics cards in SLi mode ( where they work together ) and a good motherboard .	St
1.5.3	Also try to get a HDD over 300 GB , since you 'll need a lot of space for the video games .	Sug
1.5.4	At least a gig of ram , preferably two gigs , are implied .	St
1.5.5	And make sure you have a good power supply and case , and that everything is compatible - or you may end up with a fried computer .	Sug
1.5.6	: ) Hope this helps ...	St
