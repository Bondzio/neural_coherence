hi, just wondering about the pros & cons of the vista upgrades that are offered by the stores if you buy a new pc right now ?
if you buy a media centre pc, it comes with a free upgrade to vista premium.
sounds like a good deal, but i discovered that the upgrade will be in the 32bit format, not 64 bit... question is does it really matter ??
?
