i do have one more question though about compatibility with all these parts this may be an extraordinarily stupid question, but oh well for example, the network adapter states it's a pcie card the mobo says in the description... 1 x pcie 3.0 x16 slot does that mean the network adapter is going to take up the only pcie slot on the entire board..?
does the gpu not go in that?
this is terribly confusing to me.
