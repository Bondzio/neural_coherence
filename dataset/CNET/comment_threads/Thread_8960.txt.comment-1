I recently uninstalled a zip drive.
Since then, I cannot read from the A: drive, or my CD or DVD drives.
Obviously, I have disturbed something, but cannot figure out what.
All cables are in place.
Can anyone help please?
(The drives show up in Windows, as normal, but on every one of the drives, I get the error message The disk in drive ?
is not formatted.
Do you want to format it now?
whenever I try to use it).
It's a Win 2K machine.
Many thanks squiggles
