Just when I thought I had this issue figured out (thought it was an overheating problem) it comes back to haunt me.
Computer: Gigabyte MB, P4 3.0Ghz, 1x 512MB PC3200 DDR, 128 MB Radeon 9600 graphics card, 400 Watt Pwr Sply With a cold machine, from start-up, the system goes through the bios configuration checks, and begins loading the O/S from the HD, it then simply shuts off!
Sometimes when it is running, the system would just freeze, and I have to do a hard restart to turn it off, and then the shorting-out ensues.
There are no error beeps when the system is turned on, I checked the MB battery (just checking everything) it was fine, the system is not overheating I've kept the case open and even blew a house fan into it (system temps were mild also), as far as I can see, the MB does not have direct contact with the case that would cause a short.
I am COMPLETEY STUMPED!
I don't know if I have a faulty processor, power supply, DDR, MB!
Faulty case (buttons/connectors)?
ANY HELP IS MUCH APPRECIATED.
