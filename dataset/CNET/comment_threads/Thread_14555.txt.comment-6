Yes it does beep without the memory intalled,are you using the same processor as mine 'P4 2.4MHZ(B)?
It all happens from the old board a GA-8SR533P no beep but the fan is turning no POST just a blank screen butit also beep without the memory, after checking I found that the board is toast so I replace it with this ECS-648FX-A board, does it got to do with the processor?
Cheers!!
