safe mode boot failures are now a solid sign of malware damage.
over in the storage forum at the top post are ways to get your files out.
and a last chance.
do not plug in any usb or other thing.
try safe mode again.
and i know what your question.
can you fix safe mode boot failures?
i can but on pre-installed windows i can't since they remove all the tools to fix it.
we get the files out safe then reinstall the os.
