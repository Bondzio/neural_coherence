1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	as i looked more closely that reading was for GPU, not CPU.	St
1.5.2	55 year old eyes.	St
1.5.3	so a GPU temp of 67c.	St
1.5.4	not sure what that means.	Res
1.6.1	But I've seen GPUs in that range.	St
1.7.1	looks as if some gpu run even hotter than that.	St

1.11.1	sapphire says it will run with 300 watts.	St
1.12.1	That running power supplies at full load is never a good idea.	St
1.12.2	I have a few truckloads of failed supplies to show for it (various repair shops).	St
1.12.3	Keep an eye out for random reboots and don't ignore the signs.	St
1.12.4	Also it can strain the motherboard capacitors since they have to work harder.	St
1.12.5	Bob	St
1.13.1	i have to say, the screen is beautiful, and the speed of the card is great.	St
1.13.2	i'm spoiled now by how nicely it runs.	St
1.13.3	i'm waiting to get the official word on temps from sapphire support.	St
1.13.4	will post when i find out.	St
1.13.5	i could go back to the x550, but its just not quite as effective a card.	St

1.14.2	VAPCMD	St
1.15.1	Did you try to overclock it?	St
1.16.1	80-90c is the danger zone on this card.	St
1.16.2	up to 70c is fine.	St
1.16.3	gives me some degrees of freedom.	St
1.16.4	whew.	St
1.16.5	i just hope that i don't go into overtime too many times on madden 07!	St
1.16.6	p.s.	St
1.16.7	i'm happy with the card as it is - no overclocking necessary for me with this baby.	St
1.17.1	happy and healthy computing to all!	St
