<s> I just purchased a Samsung 900DF 19in crt Flat screen. </s>
<s> It says the max resolution is a 1600x1200. </s>
<s> Ans i have a radeon 9600XT which goes to 2048X1536. </s>
<s> But when i choice resolution of 1600x1200 it stretches the screen out. </s>
<s> So to get to the buttom of my screen i have to scroll! </s>
<s> How do i change this? </s>
<s> You use the controls on the front or side of your screen to resize the image to fill the screen edge to edge. </s>
<s> All monitors have these adjustments, you just have to figure out what buttons to use on yours to adjust the horizontal and vertical optimally. </s>
<s> Make sure to set the Refresh rate to at least 72Hz, and actually as high as you can get a good image, before adjusting the screen. </s>
<s> so is 100 mhz better than ne thing below it?(i.e. </s>
<s> 60 mhz) </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> At 100Hz, your above average human can't see the difference from the 80Hz or 75Hz display. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> At 100Hz, the video card is working very hard and framerates may actually drop as the amount of time the video ram is needed for display work has increased (at 100Hz vs. </s>
<s> 80Hz.) </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> It's easy for those that don't think about this to get sucked into a never ending Hz race. </s>
<s> When this first appeared, a few 150Hz cards and displays came out, but reviews blasted them for the reasons we all know. </s>
