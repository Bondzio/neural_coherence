Sorry for the delay getting back to you Bob.
As a matter of fact I have already done that with a PCI card from SIIG with identical results.
I already have another scanner, not a USB but on a parallel port (shared with another printer).
It works fine on LPT1 (haven't tried it on the SIIG card (LPT2)).
What I like about this scanner (and I suspect that any new scanner would be different) is that its a sheet feed, which scans a page in seconds and I am able to feed additional sheets in which is especially handy when I am sending a multi-page fax.
The flatbed scanner takes several minutes per page and can only do one page at a time.
A multi-page fax takes too long and must be saved as multiple winfax attachments to send as a fax.
