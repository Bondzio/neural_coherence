I don't use wireless for my desktop, but I have 2 other laptops in house that use wireless. The router works pretty well, although I occasionaly have to bypass it because a download will freeze up. I assume the speed for my 2 laptops will increase if I upgrade to a 802.11N router, but will see an increase in speed on my desktop since my signal runs through the router? Thanks.
