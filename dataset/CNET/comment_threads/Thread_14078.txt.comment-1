I have redone an older Dell desktop for my dad and changed to a widescreen monitor but cannot get aspect ratio correct.
Output to monitor is for standard size monitor so that makes everything short and fat.
How do I change to widescreen.
I am running XP with sp3 monitor is viewsonic brand.
Any ideas??
?
