many will last longer, maybe till something breaks.
after the four years many parts manufactures begin to discontinue parts for older pcs.
try this yourself, look up and attempt to replace a motherboard, ram, or processor 4 plus years old.
no luck, think dumpster diving.
pc hardware develops at a very fast rate, my guesstimate about 300% improvement a year.
if you like waiting you can keep and old system around as long as you like.
do yourself a favor and buy a new one after 4-5 years.
