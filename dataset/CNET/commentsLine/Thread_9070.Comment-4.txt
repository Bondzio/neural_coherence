that info is intentionally incorrect.
that is not the cause of your problem.
[i did not say that it was not good that the drive was on udma 5] is it possible that that whatever you used for the speed test does not support sata drives?
my reply was basically to tell that the udma 5 was not actually correct, but was intentional reported as such by the sata specification to maintain compatibility with ata software.
that does not control the speed of the data transfers, your mobo controller shoud do that.
[actually the controller is on the card inside the drive] the chipset on the mobo talks to that controller.
i erred in not telling you to first go to the seagate site to verify that your drive came defaulted with the jumper on for the 150 or not.
please go there and enter the drive model to double check the jumpering.
if the system got unstable after you removed the jumper, you should check things at the seagate site.
what make and model is your computer??
i am assuming that you are not using some kind of adapter to use a pata port to interface the sata drive.
i am not an expert on measuring the transfer speed, never bothered to check in 20 years or so.
again, my info was simply to advise you that the udma 5 was incorrect but intentional by spec.
hopefully robert proffitt or ed o'daniel can help.
