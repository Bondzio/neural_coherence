<s> I recently purchased a new computer with Vista. </s>
<s> Now, most of the programs I utilized before on XP, are not yet compatible with Vista so I want to go ahead and install XP on it. </s>
<s> My question is, do I un-install Vista b4 I install XP, or what? </s>
<s> I spent my hard earned money on this machine and I'm not using it for what I want and need. </s>
<s> I also heard that Vista can be slow, and my machine is so thats it...I want to get rid of it. </s>
<s> I have a new Vista laptop and after just a little time in the woodshed to hack off UAC and install Free AVG our softwares are now installing and working fine. </s>
<s> Are you sure you want to go through the headaches of loading a new OS? </s>
<s> As to uninstalling Vista, that's not really done. </s>
<s> You can check our Vista forum to read the sticky there so I won't write further. </s>

<s> hard drives are really cheap nowadays. </s>
<s> http://www.microcenter.com/single_product_results.phtml?product_id=0252592 thats a 500 gb hard drive internal for $115. </s>
<s> if you get that and take out your vista hard drive then install xp on it then you can have both ^^. </s>
<s> im not sure if vista os will detect it and say boot earlier version of windows or not. </s>
<s> i started with xp and went to ista so you might have to find a way to re install vista or get it to detect windows b/c i have a good setup where i can boot xp or vista without messing with any boot bios programs or setting the devise to boot that HDD 1st i just select visto or xp basicly and i can boot either one. </s>
<s> i also reccomend getting partition magic and making a new partition of 20 gb for music/ video and mabye a 5gb partition for document backups if you need it. </s>
<s> i have a partition with music and games and another with win xp and vista ripped so i dont have to worry about my CD and DVD. </s>
<s> i would have tv shows on my music/games partition if my tuner card worked but i gatta get a new one. </s>
<s> a lesson i learned is if you reinstall windows on a factory computer you may lose a device drver for ever and not know where to get it. </s>
<s> i hope this made sense to you and helped. </s>
<s> please reply =D </s>
<s> if its a laptop i forgot this hehe. </s>
<s> get partition magic then make a new partition and install windows on it and i still dont know about vista detecting it =(. </s>
<s> but if its a laptop you can get an external hard drive for more space for games or music and backing up your data. </s>
<s> hope that helped too </s>
