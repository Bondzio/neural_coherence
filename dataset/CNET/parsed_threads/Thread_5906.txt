<s> i'm looking for a USB flash drive but don't have any idea with ones are reliable. </s>
<s> i need one that won't blank out on me and is fast. </s>
<s> and doesnt require any installation program. </s>
<s> a lot that i looked at had bad reviews. </s>
<s> It appears that no (flash) drive will meet your specs since eventually all will fail in some years. </s>

<s> what will help me then? </s>
<s> i thought there were only flash drives. </s>
<s> My oldest flash drive is years old. </s>
<s> I think that's great but your post seemed to want something for the decades. </s>

<s> These days, it's a pretty mundane topic. </s>
<s> I have used the fancy names like Lexar and Sandisk with the same success as lesser known/generic/store brand USB drives. </s>
<s> Just make sure it is a USB 2.0 model. </s>
<s> Check reviews at online stores like NewEgg.com. </s>
<s> The rest is all the bells and whistles you think you need: color, key loops, mp3 player, security software, material, finish, cartoon characters, ballpoint pen, Swiss army knife, etc. </s>
<s> I do someties spend more to get the model that comes with encryption software--very handy. </s>
