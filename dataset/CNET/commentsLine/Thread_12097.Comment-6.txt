there is no need to worry the cat6 is the newer version of cat 5e, therefore, the cat 6 would just lower it speed to the cat 5e standards.
so you have to options: you can either buy a new keystone jack like:  or stay with the cat 5e for a little while but watch out.
sometimes i dont know why but once you keep the cable in this or any other configuration, the cable gets somehow used to it and sometimes latter on when you want to upgrade your wiring to the newer category 6 style, you may have problem that the cables would not work.
in this case i would recommend to completely change your wires for the brand new and your whole system will be working fine.
