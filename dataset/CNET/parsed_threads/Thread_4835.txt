<s> my motherboard is asus model P4GE-MX.I replaced a 1.7ghz processor with a 3.06 processor. </s>
<s> The problem is that when I try to load the OS the system freezes which is not the case when I inset the old processor. </s>
<s> pliz help. </s>
<s> 1. http://discussions.virtualdr.com/showthread.php?219209-Dead-computer Post 9 repeats what I know. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I see you replaced the CPU but what about the power supply? </s>
<s> That bump up will cause some spikes in the power draw that could crash the system. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> That is also issues with freezes later in the case of both items 1, 2 and if the heat sink and compound are not up to the job. </s>
<s> Often I find the old heatsink on the new CPU and folk wondering what happened. </s>
<s> Sometimes they need a lot of convincing. </s>
<s> Sadly that convincing is done by hours on the bill. </s>

<s> You need to visit the Asus support website and check your model#(mtrbd.) </s>
<s> and thus reveiw what's present. </s>
<s> Check the current CPU list of the what's supported. </s>
<s> Plus, verify or check the current bios level you have. </s>
<s> This in turn also allows the latest supported CPU and/or additions that may not have been supported when your PC 1st came out. </s>
<s> This will greatly enhance the later CPU install as yours. </s>
<s> Also, you need to check the CPU specs and family(class) in or to best match similar CPUs. </s>
<s> Visiting the CPU maker support website will do that for ya. </s>
<s> If you check the stk# on the CPU itself, will zero-in on what you have, no guessing. </s>
<s> Once all that is accomplished you have a better understanding into the overall CPU supported and what if anything isn't. </s>
<s> Your new 3.09Mhz seems odd IMO, but then again if you review what is supported it may fit in. </s>
<s> Doing all this will provide what is anything is supported. </s>
<s> Alas, ther bios if it needs to be updated, will best provided by Asus, just be sure to get the right one. </s>
<s> All this on top of what Robert suggested as it applies. </s>
<s> Thus, this is amtter of sorting out the details as it were. </s>
