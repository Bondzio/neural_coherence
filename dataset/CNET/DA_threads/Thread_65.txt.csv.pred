1.1.1	I 've wanted to build my own PC for some time now , but I have no real knowledge .	St
1.1.2	I would like some patient guidance on some of the general knowledge such as which is best to get , or compatibility and maybe some advanced tips .	St
1.1.3	I want to build is a gaming PC that can run the current games smoothly without having to lower the graphic settings to blocky blurs .	St
1.1.4	I would also like to be able to do this with out spending a fortune , but I realize the limitations of that aspiration .	St
1.2.1	First off you need a large enough tower to support a Grafhics Card & lot 's of ventilation & an extra chassis fan .	St
1.2.2	You do n't need all that lighting outside the case unless you just want to have it for a great looking desktop .	St
1.2.3	Alot of gamers out there love having it fancy if it 's in your budget .	St
1.2.4	Get a large PSU to support the Grafhics Card Memory & CPU .	St
1.2.5	Get a board that will supports Athlon Dual CPU or Pentium & lots of memory .	St
1.2.6	Some out there do n't like Athlon from all the review 's i 've read but I have to pc 's with it & have no complaints .	St
1.2.7	Memory , CPU , Grafhics Card & PSU ia the key word here .	St
1.2.8	Get a good Graphics Card as well .	St
1.2.9	You will need a good Grafhics Card to play good quality games .	St
1.2.10	Keep it updated often .	St
1.2.11	More will come in here & add more info if I missed some .	St
1.2.12	Happy building & play safe !	St
1.3.1	have you not heard ... ... ... when the student is ready the teacher will appear .	St
1.3.2	LOL Meaning asking for one is not the process .	St
1.3.3	& quot ; Have you done your home work & quot ; as my teacher would say .	St
1.3.4	Where is Bob anyway ?	Ques
1.3.5	You might start with the search words & quot ; PC gamer groups & quot ; .	St
1.3.6	Remember , if you get in trouble : http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=f4tD0_GjEtY & feature=related There is always a Mr Wizard ... ... ... ... . at ... .. Cnet.com	St
1.4.1	The graphics ( or video card as some like to call it ) does most of the heavy work in a gaming computer .	St
1.4.2	That graphics capability is supported by a fast cpu/processor chip , plenty of RAM memory , a capable power supply , and good ventilation to keep things cool .	St
1.4.3	Adding a second graphics card as time goes by can improve things still further , especially when new games are released that require more graphics power to run them .	St
1.4.4	So the trick is to get the basics done right at the beginning in a way you can afford , then add to it as necessary .	St
1.4.5	Places like www.newegg.com and Fry 's electronics stores run daily or weekly specials on most types of components which can save you money right away .	St
1.4.6	You can purchase bargain price parts over a few weeks ( or maybe days ) and then assemble them .	St
1.4.7	Or , you can buy a bundle of compatible components where they give you a discount for buying all those parts at once .	St
1.4.8	For example , at Newegg.com website main page there are two rows of yellow/orange tabs .	St
1.4.9	Move your mouse pointer over & quot ; Computer Hardware & quot ; and a sub-menu will appear .	St
1.4.10	Click on & quot ; DIY PC Combos & quot ; and you will see 7 pages of bundled components to choose from at all price points .	St
1.4.11	Pages 5 through 7 have the more affordable systems .	St
1.4.12	Most of these bundles do NOT include the graphics card so you must figure on spending a further $ 200 or more on a good graphics card .	St
1.4.13	When you look at these bundles in detail consider certain things .	St
1.4.14	Does the case have at least front and rear 120mm size fans with room to add more ?	Ques
1.4.15	Intel and AMD processors come with a downward-firing fan/heatsink .	St
1.4.16	This stock cooler is MUCH more effective if the case has a side-panel fan blowing directly towards the cpu cooler .	St
1.4.17	It really does make a significant difference .	St
1.4.18	The power supply should be at least 600watts with connections for two graphics cards .	St
1.4.19	The motherboard should support two graphics cards also .	St
1.4.20	Although the graphics card does most of the heavy work in 3D games , you still need a fairly capable cpu and memory to support that .	St
1.4.21	The cheapest cpu that will get it done is probably an AMD Athlon II X2 245 chip .	St
1.4.22	This is a dual-core chip .	St
1.4.23	Higher-numbered dual-core models and/or AMD 's X3 440 Tri-core are a little better and cost more .	St
1.4.24	Quad-core and Six-core are fairly expensive and not really necessary for gaming .	St
1.4.25	Intel 's E3300 chip is a rock-bottom contender but , with its small Level 2 memory cache , you 'd need to overclock it for good gaming performance .	St
1.4.26	That usually means a more expensive heatsink/fan cooler , more heat , and maybe more noise .	St
1.4.27	An Intel chip that 's very capable without overclocking is the Core i3 530 cpu .	St
1.4.28	You can have solid gaming performance with 2GB of RAM memory to start with , or go for 4GB if your budget permits .	St
1.4.29	Do n't get caught up in the low latency/fast timing memory modules as they can cost a lot more for only a small gaming improvement .	St
1.4.30	SSD hard drives are great for faster loading of games and programs but , again , they do n't significantly improve the gaming performance once the game starts , and they cost a lot extra .	St
1.4.31	Those extra dollars should go on the graphics card !	Sug
1.4.32	Speaking of graphics cards , the recent nVidia-based GTX 460 is arguably the best bang-for-the-buck model right now at around $ 200 .	St
1.4.33	Or .	St
1.4.34	consider a Radeon 5850 for about a hundred dollars more .	St
1.4.35	On a budget , I 'd probably go for a GTX 460 now and maybe add a second GTX 460 later on to further boost performance .	St
1.5.1	Well first off , this is like asking people to name their favorite car and why .	St
1.5.2	You are going to get a hundred answers , patient or not , and they will all be a little to a lot different .	St
1.5.3	Let me go down a list for you .	Sug
1.5.4	1 .	St
1.5.5	Budget ?	Ques
1.5.6	No way to give you any answers without a budget .	St

1.5.10	Small tools ?	Ques
1.5.11	A clean , well lit place to assemble it ?	Ques
1.5.12	3 .	St
1.5.13	My recommendation is to go to a place like www.cyberpowerpc.com or Alienware or Falcon Northwest to just look at some machines to start with , see what the pros are putting in machines from budget models up to extreme machines .	St
1.5.14	4.TOMSHARDWARE.com has some excellent articles and info on system builds from budget to extreme .	St
1.5.15	5 .	St
1.5.16	You got to have a budget first , and take that budget to a place like CyberPower and see what it will get you , then go from there .	St
1.5.17	Read about the components and then go research them .	St
1.5.18	6 .	St
1.5.19	When you are ready , go to a site , have them build it for you and you can even get a warranty .	St
1.5.20	7 .	St
1.5.21	I build and repair systems , and although I have built my own systems from scratch for my wife and daughter and others I prefer to have someone else do the building for me after I pick the components because I get a warranty .	St
1.5.22	8 .	St
1.5.23	Just asking someone what the best video card is will practically start a war..LOL Just type in your budget and gaming PC into Google and see what comes up .	St

1.7.1	thanks for the help , and guidance , though I admit some of the specs on the parts confuse me , the numbers and such get all mixed in my head , I might be a lost cause ... as for a budget , well I never thought about it , though I really should have , I guess with me being a part time cashier my budget is meager at best .	St
1.7.2	I was hoping to buy each part individually as I can afford each one , but I guess if I have doubts on comparability that would n't be best .	St
1.7.3	I have put together a PC before , though it was at school and only basic stuff really ...	St
1.8.1	& quot ; I might be a lost cause ... & quot ; Just keep plugging along .	St
1.9.1	There 's nothing wrong with building a computer in this manner ; as for compatibility , AMD makes this choice easy , as all AM2+ and AM3 motherboards will fit a very wide variety of processors .	St
1.9.2	Intel on the other hand limits the processors you choose to the socket you decide to go with .	St
1.9.3	For example ; if you choose an LGA 775 motherboard you 're limited to ( at most ) a Core 2 Extreme , if you choose the ( newer ) LGA 1156 motherboard you 're limited to only P55 processors , and , if you choose to go with an LGA 1366 motherboard then you 're limited to only running with an X58 processor .	St
1.9.4	When choosing a motherboard ( if you 're planning on any decent gaming or photo editing ) ; choose a board without integrated graphics , and then purchase a good video card later ( I read somewhere that it is better to have one excellent video card , than going SLI or Crossfire with two or more lower-end video cards ) .	St

St
1.9.7	When buying a new case to hold all your new components ; this is pretty much up to you , but bear in mind that you do n't want your 1st build to be a nightmare ( because it 's too tight a fit to get everything inside , and/ or that it just does n't cool all your components well enough ) .	St
1.9.8	We all started out at the same level that you are now ; I wish I had known about such forums ( as the ones here ) , when I built my 1st ( gaming ) computer .	St
