I will install hard drive, more ram or OS if necessary. Any recommendations on workstations versus building one myself. I don't plan on using it for gaming, video editing or design. Only want it for web surfing and home office use.

Don't know where you can get one of them. But the IBMs are complete machines. No need to add anything at all. Unless you just want to go to the trouble of installing hardware, an OS, digging for drivers, and spending hours on this. Me, I'll take a complete working machine any day, especially at that price. Good luck on your hunt for a dumb terminal.
