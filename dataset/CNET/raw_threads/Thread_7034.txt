The specs include AMD Phenom II X4 810 2.60GHz processor 6GB DDR3 1066 memory 1 TB SATA hard drive integrated ATI Radeon HD 3200 graphics card VGA and HDMI monitor ports two 5.25 inch bays three 3.5 inch bays Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit OS one DVDRW optical drive 300 watt PSU I bought this on the spur of the moment because I thought I was getting a good deal at $500 with no tax and free shipping. However, no disks came with it. So my question is &quot;Do you think this really is a good deal or should I exchange it before the 30-day period expires for something with a better reputation for quality, reliability and customer service.&quot; Thank you.

Just one malware and it's failing. This is not reliable. Sorry but reliable is something I write about toasters and refrigerators, not computers. Bob

Proffitt	11/12/10 7:55 AM	1.2895485E12	I like this list.	http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/graphics-card-geforce-radeon,2761.html presents it in an easy to understand what you can get for the money. I like that list. It's also what I use when I shop for a new card. Bob
