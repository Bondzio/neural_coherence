the core 2 duo gains over the core duo are such that you would get the c2d everytime.
essentially you get em64t for free.
but the real payoffs for many is the video card (games.)
i have to stick with generic answers since we are not talking specifics here.
specifics?
mysql gets a speed boost from 64 bit.
games in general get nothing but by curbing the cost of the usual 64-bit os and putting that into our video card we gain fps.
