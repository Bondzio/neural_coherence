I have and HP media center photosmart computer and I knew when we bought it that it would have to get a new video card for the types of games my husband and I play. However, in doing more research I found that I may also need to upgrade the power supply to run the new card. My questions are, what is the best card for this commputer? we would only want to run things like Microsoft flight sim X and some of the Myst-Uru type games. I like ATI Radeon, but there are SO many choices and I don't really know what the differences are. Also, I don't even know how to find a power supply etc. That kind of sounds like a dangerous thing to mess with. Anyway, any help would be greatly appreciated. I would like to get this stuff for my husband for Christmas.

(its not difficult but some folks don't like screwdrivers.) + are you willing to buy from a web shop? (you'll save 40% or more compared to local stores.)

Well, I am not really sure what a decent cost would be for something like this. I want to try to keep it on the lower end if possible. The video card I installed in my old computer was something I just picked up at Walmart for $100. I realize this will be a bit more expensive, but I don't want to be getting up to $1000 or anything, we just can't afford that. I am fine with taking things apart and putting them back together, like I said, I have installed video cards, extra hard drives, etc. As long as I have instructions I can do just about any of that stuff. And, I have NO problem buying over the internet. That is how we do most of our shopping now since Katrina Thanks for replying!!!

All of the cards above suggest a 400W unit, but the 7600gt and lower could get by with 350W. Here's a good 430W unit for $40. http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=370900

He was told that since 256 was the minimum requirement for his game that it would not run as well with a 256 MB card and would be &quot;jerky&quot;. Any advice on this? Also, just for my info, what is the difference between a Radeon 1950 and 1650??

(these are the native resolutions of 20&quot; LCDs). low-end and mid-range cards can't run games well at those resolutions so 512mb is wasted in these cards. of the cards i suggested, even the 1950pro probably won't be helped by 512mb. that's why the vast majority of these cards only have 256mb while $400 cards typically have 512mb standard. the extra money you would spend for 512mb should be invested in a faster card instead. here are benchmarks of a midrange x1600pro with 512mb. notice that its extra ram never helps it run faster than a x1600xt or x1600pro 'turbo' (both of which have 256mb). http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/354/8

You have a high end computer, but you'll need that graphics horsepower for that program. http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,2061796,00.asp

Most LCD's are 1280*1024 or above and need to be run at the native resolution only to avoid scaling issues. Lower end but doable http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814143049 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814102068 Higher end and better http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814143070 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814131027 Yet a bit higher and much better http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814143071
