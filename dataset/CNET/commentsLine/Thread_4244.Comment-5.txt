right, i was able to copy the data and create a new folder in my library on the new hard drive.
the old drive was moderately functional.
i just don't know what to do with the files to get my settings, documents and pics and music back to where it was.
the files i copied don't say my documents or my music...when i open them it's like reading a foreign language, that's the reason i was trying to paste them to my new drive (c) but it wouldn't allow me to do that because i didn't have permission to do so (still not understanding that one).
and i do appreciate your input in case i hadn't mentioned that before!
