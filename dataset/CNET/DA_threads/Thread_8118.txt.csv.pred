1.1.1	I got a new SD card a while ago for my camera.	St
1.1.2	The built in card reader in my epson printer displays a picture of a memory card with a zig zag line across it implying that the card is corrupted.	St
1.1.3	However, I can view the pictures on the camera and can transfer normally to the computer using a USB to the camera.	St
1.1.4	However, the card reader is much more convenient.	St
1.1.5	I have formatted the card using the camera's function and that did nothing.	St
1.1.6	Any ideas?	St
1.2.1	Some printers had limitations.	St
1.3.1	It's 4GB and I have tested it with only one photo on it, so it's not like there is a huge amount of data on it.	St
1.3.2	It has slots for 6 different types of card and I have previously used it with a Memory Duo Pro (or whatever that long Sony one is called) successfully.	St
1.3.3	The printer is only a couple of years old.	St
1.3.4	It is an Epson Stylus Photo RX520 (which is similar to the RX500: http://reviews.cnet.com/multifunction-devices/epson-stylus-photo-rx500/4505-3181_7-30604037.html?tag=prod.txt.1 )	St
1.4.1	High Capacity.	St
1.4.2	You are lucky your camera supports this.	Polite
1.4.3	You might have had better luck with the 2GB which is just SD and not SDHC.	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	I didn't think about that.	St
1.5.2	Thanks	Polite
