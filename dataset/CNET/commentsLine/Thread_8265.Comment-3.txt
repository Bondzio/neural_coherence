you need to check the device manager under the control panel area.
goto start-&gt;control panel-&gt;system-&gt;device manager-hardware-?find listing for firewire.
once found verify its present and shows its working statement.
otherwise, at this point you can re-install the drive from your system disc or have the file downloaded from dell support website.
if the firewire ports are not original to the dell system, then get those drivers from the maker(or disc) and continue on once in hand.
if none of this correct the problems, then disable the firewire ports within the bios area or remove the pci type card if so installed.
either way, will disable the firewire ports.
once done, buy a pci type firewire card and install using its s/w in order to proceed.
hopefully that cures your problem.
check your manual or dell support for your model# pc and find info on entering bios.
why, your current firewire ports went bad is something that can happen.
however, provided you know the devices installed in the firewire ports are ok, the problem may repeat so be sure everything is ok. next, if you had some electrical issue, the result is some port can go bad, in this case firewire.
