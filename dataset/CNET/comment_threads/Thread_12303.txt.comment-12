Got this router for x-mas, sigh, nice thought, but total absolute junk.
To fix the constant disconnect: 1 go into your router settings 2 click &quot;advanced&quot; tab up top 3 click &quot;advanced wireless&quot; tab on left 4 change the beacon period to 20 This will slow down the connection speed somewhat(about 20%), but will enable the router to hold a steady connection.
Wonder what is an adequate time period before I &quot;accidentally&quot; break it and get a new one.
Seriously total junk, D-link never should have put it on the market.
