Mobos beep for that failure also.
Can you go to memtest, download and put it on a floppy and test your memory one stick at a time.
http://www.memtest86.com/ Running that system with anything except PC3200 in Dual Channel mode would be a shame.
It is starved for memory bandwidth with PC2100.
Not saying that the PC 2100 is the problem, just might be.
The mobo mfrs site should give a list of memory that they have tested with the mobo.
