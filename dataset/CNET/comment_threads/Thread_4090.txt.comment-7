I purchased a fairly high end gaming system about six weeks ago from Ironsides and I am impressed.
When doing research I came across this very post and told myself that if I am happy with the system I will come back here and put in my two cents.
I was a little nervous about purchasing the system from a fairly unknown company, so the first thing I did was contact customer service.
Over the next week I corresponded with them via email and was impressed with the the quick and professional responses.
It took 8 days to receive the system and again I was impressed.
It was packed carefully and securely.
I realize this is my only 'post', but if you are looking for a system I would recommend Ironside computers.
