1.1.1	with a defective chipset ?	Ques
1.1.2	I have a MSI P6N SLI-FI board with a P4 650 CPU and 2 - 1Gb mods of DDR2-667 mem .	St
1.1.3	that works smoothly in Windows when it does boot-up .	St
1.1.4	I 've been trying to understand why the system fails to POST at almost any BIOS value other than default .	St
1.1.5	I can go up 0.0500 volts above default for the vcore but none above that .	St
1.1.6	I have the memory set to recommended of 1.9 ... default for this board is 2.0 .	St
1.1.7	At 2.0 it fails to post .	St
1.1.8	I can keep hitting the reset button and eventually it will POST and boot .	St
1.1.9	This mobo has an nVidia chipset and was told the temp ... at default speeds runs at 50 degrees C. This system temp stays around 30 degrees even after playing a heavy-load game .	St
1.1.10	The CPU temp varies but the idle temp is around 35 in BIOS hardware monitor and around 24 in MSI in-Windows utility .	St
1.1.11	I 'm thinking there might be something askew with the chipset but not enough to make the system run poorly .	St
1.1.12	Complete system specs are : WinXP Home w/SP2 MSI P6N SLI-FI mobo ( not using SLI ) P4 650 CPU ( vcore set to 0.0500 & gt ; ) 2 - 1Gb mods of Corsair Twin2X DDR2-667 ( 1.9 volts ) 2 - 160Gb WD 7200RPM SATA hdds in RAID 0 1 - EVGA 7800GT CO VGA card Corsair HX620W PSU ( +3.3 @ 24A , +5V @ 30A , +12V1 @ 18A , +12V2 @ 18A , +12V3 @ 18A , - 12V @ 0.8A , +5VSB @ 3A ) 1 - Lite-On DVD+-RW LiteScribe drive Standard floppy drive 1 - 130mm case fan , 3 pin connected to mobo 1 - 120mm case fan , molex connected to PSU and single yellow wire sensor lead connected to mobo .
