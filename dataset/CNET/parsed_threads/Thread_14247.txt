<s> I purchased a used Dell Latitude Cpx from ebay in October. </s>
<s> When I first turned it all everything seemed fine. </s>
<s> After a while a timer came up and would restart my computer. </s>
<s> I thought it was an administrative command, so I looked for steps to stop this from happening. </s>
<s> Eventually I realized this was actually a sympton of the gaobot/agobot virus family! </s>
<s> I had to download various anti-virus programs to remove it. </s>
<s> Variants of this virus kept infecting my computer despite my attemtps to clean my laptop. </s>
<s> I had lots of spyware and malware in addition to the nasty viruses. </s>
<s> I contacted the seller and he said there were no viruses on it when he shipped it. </s>
<s> (Did I really expect him to say yes?) </s>
<s> I can not burn cds or play dvds, but the listing stated there was a cd burner and CD-RW drive. </s>
<s> A LIE. </s>
<s> A few days ago I left my computer on and napped for a few hours. </s>
<s> When I woke up my laptop restarted itself and was stuck on the opening screen. </s>
<s> I turned it on then back on again to see what was going on. </s>
<s> I tried to start firefox and a message about an .xml document popped up. </s>
<s> I wasn't wearing my glasses so I couldn't see it. </s>
<s> Firefox closed immediately; I knew something was VERY wrong. </s>
<s> I opened ad-aware to check out the problem. </s>
<s> Lo and behold my virus definitions had been corrupted or missing. </s>
<s> Uh oh. </s>
<s> My computer turned on! </s>
<s> I rebooted it into safe mode and ran ad-aware then. </s>
<s> I opened spybot and a message popped up indicating the program had been changed, which doesn't occur unless there is a trojan or spyware. </s>
<s> My computer turns off AGAIN. </s>
<s> I rebooted it a few times for only to see a black screen reading your memory has been or changed. </s>
<s> Other times the black screen was BLANK. </s>
<s> Now I can't even power on the thing. </s>
<s> I call Dell and try different methods to fix the problem. </s>
<s> I am told this laptop was ordered 6 years ago and is a 98 system. </s>
<s> The ebay listing stated it was windows XP but did not mention an upgrade. </s>
<s> The seller said he could try to fix it but depending on the problem it might cost. </s>
<s> What do I do?!? </s>
<s> A)Toss the laptop and get a new one elsewhere or B)Let the seller fix it C)Something else. </s>
<s> I will not purchase electronics from ebay again. </s>
<s> That was a dumb decision which cost me in the long run. </s>
<s> I should have spent the extra few hundred dollars for a new laptop. </s>
<s> You get what you pay for. </s>
<s> It sounds like a software problem. </s>
<s> Have you thought about finding the drivers for the laptop then buying a fresh copy of W98SE? </s>
<s> I mention 98 because a machine that old may not have the guts to run XP. </s>
<s> If you like the machine and want to keep it, I think I'd try to do a format and reinstall the OS and system drivers. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> you may have a point. </s>
<s> when I spoke with Dell I was told that the computer barely fits Xp. </s>
<s> hmmm. </s>
<s> do you think the computer is worth fixing? </s>
<s> If you can get the specs on the laptop, here is what microsoft says: Here's What You Need to Use Windows XP Home Edition PC with 300 megahertz (MHz) or higher processor clock speed recommended; 233-MHz minimum required;* Intel Pentium/Celeron family, AMD K6/Athlon/Duron family, or compatible processor recommended 128 megabytes (MB) of RAM or higher recommended (64 MB minimum supported; may limit performance and some features) 1.5 gigabyte (GB) of available hard disk space. </s>
<s> Super VGA (800 600) or higher resolution video adapter and monitor CD-ROM or DVD drive Keyboard and Microsoft Mouse or compatible pointing device. </s>
<s> More here http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/home/upgrading/sysreqs.mspx I consider the above the absolute bare minimum. </s>
<s> I wouldn't even try it on a machine like the above. </s>
<s> It's probably worth fixing, but now with XP as the OS. </s>
