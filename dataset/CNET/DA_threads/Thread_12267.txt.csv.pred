1.2.1	Look at your hardware configuration under Device Manager .	St
1.2.2	Click on Processors .	St
1.2.3	How many do you show ?	Ques
1.2.4	If you show 2 , HT is enabled and recognized .	St
1.2.5	ASUS boards come with a nice manual .	St
1.2.6	They have several pages on BIOS configuration .	St
1.2.7	The book should contain this .	Sug
1.2.8	If you have not manual , they can be found and downloaded on the ASUS site .	St
1.2.9	On my ASUS board , the HT setting is under Advanced/CPU configuration .	St
1.2.10	See if you have anything like this .	St
1.3.1	I did n't have to do anything to make this work .	St
1.3.2	If you have a HT enabled CPU , and have either XP pro or XP home with sp1 slippstreamed into the distorbution media , then HT worked fine for me .	St
1.3.3	I got in a older HP media cenetr PC that was stripped except for the cpu and MoBo .	St
1.3.4	Three finger csalute the machine and see how many CPUs taskmanager sees .	St
1.3.5	If that does n't work I will look in the Bios .	St
