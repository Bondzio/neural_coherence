it doesn't really matter because you won't even get the 300 in the first place.
besides the fact that no home user has 300m internet wireless technology is half duplex.
so to your question, there is no standard defined for the bonding of 2.4 and 5 channels into a single stream.
this means if this ability even existed it would a be a proprietary thing which would mean both your nic and your router would have to come from the same vendor.
if you want to write your own drivers and firmware it is technically possible i suppose.
you could in theory also get 2 completely separate lan connections up if your pc nic allows this, the router more than likely does.
but now you have the larger issue of how to use 2 lan connection at the same time.
this is the how do i run 2 internet connections question that there is no good answer for.
