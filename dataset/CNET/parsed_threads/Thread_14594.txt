<s> I'm very confused on the issue of servers, networking, file sharing etc. </s>
<s> We have a very small business w/ 2 computers at one location, 1 computer at another location and a laptop. </s>
<s> We need to share our Quickbooks file, excel files, powerpoint files, outlook tasks, calendars, etc. </s>
<s> My question is do we need to get a server? </s>
<s> I've been doing some research on the web and there seems to be other services that provide networking - such as groove network, and there are also intranets that one can set up. </s>
<s> We are looking for the most economical option, but we also want it to be user-friendly and secure and understand we will have to pay for that as well. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any suggestions for us? </s>
<s> Any advice at all would be very, very helpful. </s>
<s> Gracias! </s>
<s> PS - We all have Windows XP if that helps. </s>
<s> Then simple &quot;sneaker net&quot; and email is how that's done. </s>
<s> Even email is over a network, so I wonder if that's &quot;without a net&quot;. </s>
<s> Sneaker net is something we use on the go with a few USB MEMORY KEYS today. </s>
<s> We copy a file onto the memory key and walk over and hand it to the other person. </s>
<s> Cheap. </s>
<s> Memory keys hold over 4 gigabytes today... http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/sbs/default.mspx has your basics about networking and a possible server software you may consider since it has an EXCHANGE SERVER to hold you shared Calendars. </s>
<s> As far as Microsoft based server software, SBS is about as friendly as it gets. </s>
<s> Best of luck and one last comment. </s>
<s> The Quicken file can't be open by more than one person at a time, so keep copies of daily or such in backup in case it gets corrupt. </s>

<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> I've used the memory keys, but we need to share files at different locations so that won't work. </s>
<s> I'll look into the Microsoft server. </s>
<s> Oh, what is SBS? </s>
<s> Sara </s>
<s> Different products. </s>
<s> I noted SBS since it's the friendlier of the server products. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Get a network external storage. </s>
