<s> I was confused about this &quot;HALF HEIGHT&quot; I thought it was a &quot;special&quot; type that I had to purchase the same replacement type in any brand so long as it was half height. </s>
<s> Don't know what half height is. </s>
<s> there are some slim drives intended for use in laptops, but the rest are half-height. </s>
<s> Thank You very Much. </s>
<s> It was very confusing to me since when I search for half height only a few show up. </s>
<s> I do have a Best Buy close and I think your suggestion is great. </s>
