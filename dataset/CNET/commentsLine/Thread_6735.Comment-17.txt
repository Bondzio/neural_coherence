will not be replaced with another emachine as she will get one of my other two (non-emachine) desktops when and if her current emachine starts to malfunction causing some $'s.
she uses her ($450) emachine every day for web surfing, printing, producing photo's with a scanner, and has even made cd's with it.
she also plays her type games on it, but will use my more powerful desktop for later high end games.
i am able to fix just about anything that may go wrong with my computers.
have noticed through the years that the root of the majority of computer problems started with the operator.
sorry to hear about your problems.
