<s> I have a PIII (500 MHz) PC, and I want to replace the motherboard to probably a P4 or a AMD, what are the things I need to look into? </s>
<s> I am not a hardware expert, but pretty handy with PC hardware, I have installed DVD writers, video cards etc. </s>
<s> Any help is appreciated. </s>
<s> The RAM, Power Supply and not much else can be recycled since RAM changes for the P4 and any power supply that came with a P3 will be lucky to cause beeps on the new system. </s>

<s> To begin where Robert left off is to suggest too much has happened since the 500mhz system was current. </s>
<s> The newer P4 is more demanding plus any other devices to make it a happy medium. </s>
<s> Its just better to get all new or any used that is capable. </s>
<s> But as mentioned what came with the old system may not cut it. </s>
<s> -OR- shop for some OEM that on its own merit provides a jumping point into P4 realm at a bargain, but you take what you get as OEM provided. </s>
<s> Look into a eMachine or HP models. </s>
<s> Of course that leaves Compaq, Gateway and IBM to consider as well, they're usually on sale on a regular basis. </s>
<s> The choice is yours... tada -----Willy </s>
<s> if getting a new system check out the emachines t6212! </s>
<s> its great for the price and good for upgrades. </s>
