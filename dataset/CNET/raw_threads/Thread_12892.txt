962	1	168255	1862930	1861819	jackintucson	4/7/06 1:59 PM	1.14441834E12	better...	The X2 4200 is certainly better than a non-X2 4000. and life goes on... Jack

I was wondering how these systems were working and if there were any problems. I'm thinking about purchasing an X2 or Pentium D based system. I'm also wondering about Sony, HP etc. After using my Sony Notebook w/PII for over six years with out a problem and My P4 1.5 Sony Desktop for the last 5 years. I purchased a Compaq Notebook w a 64bit AMD I have nothing against AMD but am not happy with the noteboods quality, ie: the transformer power cord falls out of the back of the computer. I've also had to replace the transformer after one year. My Sony notebook never had one problem. Send me any feedback you can.
962	5	168255	1864684	1864527	nathanpsz2	4/8/06 4:12 PM	1.14451272E12	I don't like any prebuilt computers...	...especially HP. I've had tons of problems with it overheating and shutting down. I put it in a new, bigger case with better airflow, and it still shut down randomly. I gave it to another nerd that I know, and he tried another P4 in it, and had to shut it down because the CPU reached like 200 degrees Farenheit. He put my chip (P4 540; 3.2GHz) on his motherboard, and it shut down on him as he was reinstalling Windows. The comptuer was an overstock, so there's no warranty. So far, I've paid $76 for the case and $60 to the nerd. I'll probably have to spend about $300 to replace the CPU and motherboard, and another $50 to replace the crappy no-name-brand power supply (if a power supply fails, the system goes; bad). Lesson learned: $h!t happens, and sometimes you're the one paying for it. Also, I'm never buying another comptuer; from now on, I'm building my own.

962	8	168255	1865762	1864937	ramarc	4/9/06 9:38 AM	1.14457548E12	big typhoon, yes; mini typhoon probably	the mini typhoon is getting somewhat so-so reviews (only a bit better cooling than the amd stock hs/fan). if you want a quieter system, it'll do that; but if you want a quieter and cooler system, look elsewhere. have you consider arctic cooling's freezer 64 pro?

962	10	168255	1869332	1864996	nathanpsz2	4/11/06 11:50 AM	1.1447562E12	That's irrelevant...	...because I've put it in a new case with an 80mm front fan, and a 120mm rear fan.
962	11	168255	1870527	1869332	blazerdude20	4/11/06 9:37 PM	1.14479142E12	huh	i wasnt replying to your post nathan. i was replying to the one u replyed too. look at the thread.

962	13	168255	1870942	1870714	WhyFi	4/12/06 5:07 AM	1.14481842E12	Exactly.	Especially with an AMD X2! AMD features their 'cool 'n' quiet' technology which does indeed keep things cool and quiet. Unless you're going to lock the multiplier and overclock, etc, there shouldn't be any problems with overheating on the stock HSF, unless you've got some other issues going on. (Incidentally, I hear that the new HSFs that AMD is sending out with their CPUs are pretty decent and that spending 50 bucks to replace it with an aftermarket HSF is a waste of 50 bucks.) One of my PCs is an HP with a 4200 X2, an ATI graphics card, a 400W PSU and a little more memory- everything else is stock. I've had no problems with the system, even with moderate ('very high' settings, not the highest settings) gaming.
