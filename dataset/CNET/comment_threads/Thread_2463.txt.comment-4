I don't know your electronics design background but if I was to build this I would CHEAT BIG TIME.
I'd get something like a IP controlled relay box like http://www.controlanything.com/ Now I can wire up those relays to that curtain or even the RF control device.
Like I said, this is not for a consumer to do but for those that create stuff.
