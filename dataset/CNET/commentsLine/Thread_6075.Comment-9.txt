no beeps no sound from the drives spining but there is a small light on on the motherboard that is on.
i tried different power supplys and video cards memorey still the same way.the funney thing is with the motherboard pluged in the cd rom will not come out but unplug the motherboard and the cd tray will come out.
i had my wife go to town to get a new motherboard and procesor and the one they sent home was all wrong could not hook a ide cabled hard drive to it, it would not take my ddr memory they now use ddr2.
i wish they would quit changing the way things so fast just about have to build or a new computer as all of my one year old parts are obsolite.
