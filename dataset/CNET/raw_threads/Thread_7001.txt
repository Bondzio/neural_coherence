My desktop disk storage has gotten out of controll. At present I have two hard drives on the first IDE channel and one hard drive and a DVD/r on the other. Here is my delima. I want to eliminate two of the hard drives that do not contain the operating system and replace it with one large one. I want the other slot to become a second DVD/r drive. of the two drives I want to replace one has one partition on it and the other has three. I am thinking I can use Ghost to make an image of all drives on a seperat external drive and then install the new large one and copy images to it. Will that work? Will I be able to keep current drive letter assignments? I am a little gun shy since I don't want to reinstall everything. Thanks Gary

A. 2 partitions C: OS and all APPS D: ALL DATA B. 2 partitions E: small partition for swapfile F: images of C: and D: If the OS gets corrupt ... get the image of C: from F: and restore it with Ghost. If drive primary drive dies....replace it and restore C: and D: from the images on F: with Ghost. If you get a windfall...then put the images of C: and D: on an external...just in case. Trust me, it works and works well.

You just add the new drive to your system and use the utility CD to copy the image of the HD with your OS to the new drive. If you purchase an OEM drive, you can download the HD utility form the HD mfg. Example: Western Digital offers ''Data Lifeguard Tools'' for their HD's. http://support.wdc.com/download/index.asp?swid=1
