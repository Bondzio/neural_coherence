4033	0	325530	2953876	NR	robbaby	1/16/09 6:38 AM	1.23208788E12	Second HD not seen by XP	I have a Dell XPS with a HD that is getting full so I have added a second SATA HD. I have turned the second HD &quot;on&quot; in the BIOS, and XP &quot;sees&quot; the HD in the device manager, but it does not list it as an available drive in &quot;My Computer.&quot; I think that I need to format the drive. Is that correct? If so, any suggestions on how to do that?
