1.1.1	This is pretty basic , but I ca n't figure it out .	St
1.1.2	I have a desktop and a laptop I use for school .	St
1.1.3	How can I setup my network such that I can share files between the desktop and laptop ?	Ques
1.1.4	The desktop is a typical home desktop using a wireless card to access the wireless router and internet connection .	St
1.1.5	The laptop can and does access the same router , but is also configured to login to my network at school ( wirelessly and hardwired ) .	St
1.1.6	Is there a way I can easily port files from the desktop to laptop and vice versa when I am at home ?	Ques
1.2.1	is your workgroup names .	St
1.2.2	Since you are logging into a school network with one PC , it 's likely those settings do not match the other .	St
1.2.3	Workgroup names need to be the same for one PC to see the other .	St
1.3.1	I have been able to access different PCs that belong to different networks , as long as you know how to get there .	St
1.3.2	All you have to do is go into My Network Places and click on either & quot ; View Workgroup PCs & quot ; or & quot ; Entire Network & quot ; .	St
1.3.3	With View Workgroup PCs option , just click on the & quot ; up & quot ; arrow and you 'll see a list of networks , choose one and find the PC .	St
1.3.4	If you go w/ Entire Network , then Microsoft Windows Network and you 'll have a list of networks .	St
1.3.5	The easiest way is to make them be on the same network , but the MOST important thing is that you have enabled file sharing .	St
1.3.6	If this is n't enabled ... you wo n't see squat under the network name .	St
1.3.7	The first issue is that you did n't specify your Operating Systems ... this is a very important part of the puzzle .	St
1.3.8	So what OSs do you have ?	Ques
1.4.1	I have been able to access different PCs that belong to different networks , as long as you know how to get there .	St
1.4.2	All you have to do is go into My Network Places and click on either ''View Workgroup PCs '' or ''Entire Network '' .	St
1.4.3	With View Workgroup PCs option , just click on the ''up '' arrow and you 'll see a list of networks , choose one and find the PC .	St
1.4.4	If you go w/ Entire Network , then Microsoft Windows Network and you 'll have a list of networks .	St
1.4.5	( this is for Windows XP machines ) .	St
1.4.6	The easiest way is to make them be on the same network , but the MOST important thing is that you have enabled file sharing .	St
1.4.7	If this is n't enabled ... you wo n't see squat under the network name .	St
1.4.8	The first issue is that you did n't specify your Operating Systems ... this is a very important part of the puzzle .	St
1.4.9	So what OSs do you have ?	Ques
1.5.1	They both use XP .	St
1.5.2	I have a folder shared on the desktop ( which is where all of the files I want to get to are ) .	St
1.5.3	I ca n't see it though on the laptop .	St
1.6.1	So you have a folder shared on the desktop of your desktop PC and your laptop ca n't see the folder that is shared on your desktop PC ?	Ques
1.6.2	Are both PCs using Windows XP Pro ?	Ques
1.6.3	First step I 'd say is to make sure your PC ( with the shared desktop folder ) actually realizes its shared .	St
1.6.4	To do this , 1st make sure there is a lil hand under the folder , 2nd go to My Network Places and see if any shared folders appear in there .	St
1.6.5	If it 's not in there ... that 's a problem of the file share settings .	St
1.6.6	If it is in there , it may be that you are on a different workgroup ( have you tried browsing workgroups like I mentioned in ''actually '' ? ) .	St
1.6.7	To see if they are on the same workgroup , then right-clicking on My Computer - & gt ; Properties - & gt ; Computer Name ( Tab ) should tell you the name , workgroup , and domain ( if applicable ) .	St
1.6.8	Since you said you use this at school ... you may be in a domain which may interfere with the home network ( this is out of my league though if it involves a domain name ) .	St
1.6.9	If they are on different workgroups , you 'll have to change the workgroup of one or go workgroup ''browsing '' to find the foldershare .	St
1.6.10	Hope this helps !	St
1.7.1	& gt ; & gt ; So you have a folder shared on the desktop of your desktop PC and your laptop ca n't see the folder that is shared on your desktop PC ?	Ques

1.7.4	There is a folder shared on the desktop .	St
1.7.5	The laptop ca n't see it .	St

1.7.10	1st - the little hand is there .	St
1.7.11	2nd - it 's in there like Prego .	St

1.7.18	Guess I will be visiting computer services at school tomorrow .	St
1.7.19	I love Windows .	St
1.8.1	I shoulda mentioned not to mess w/ the domain name in my last post , I apologize for that .	St
1.8.2	Unfortuneatly I do not know how you can set this up having your laptop on a domain .	St
1.8.3	The IT people at your school may be able to tell you how to make the shared folder accessable to your laptop ( most likely it is due to a setting on your laptop ) .	St
1.8.4	Good luck !	Polite
