<s> i have 2 hard drives, one of which is thw boot drive. </s>
<s> is it possible to make the other one the boot drive? </s>
<s> If so, you should be able to switch between drives through the BIOS. </s>
<s> But, by default, most will look for the master drive on the first IDE channel. </s>
<s> So, you can also change drive jumpers to accomplish this or, if using cable select, switch positions on the IDE cable. </s>
<s> Since you did not mention anything about hardware, I am presuming you are using IDE HDs. </s>
<s> If you are using SATA drives, BIOS or cable selection is still how it's done. </s>
<s> Open up the computer and make de master as slave and the second make-it master. </s>
