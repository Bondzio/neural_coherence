<s> My dad has a large library of DVD's, and the dvd players in my house are really beginning to suck. </s>
<s> So I thought for this XMAS I would buy him an Apple TV. </s>
<s> What I'd like to do is buy a large HD (like a TB or something), and then rip his dvd movies to the drive so it can be connected to a computer and accessed by AppleTV whenever he wants to watch something. </s>
<s> Does anyone know what I could do to get this done quickly, because I don't have the time to sit on my MBP and rip 300+ movies to my hard drive and then drag them to an external HD... </s>
<s> I was hoping there was some hardware that could convert DVDs to digital format within minutes I could use. </s>
<s> Thanks, Alegoo92 </s>
<s> I've never seen such a thing. </s>
<s> Even at shows and in the back rooms of labs. </s>
<s> Yeah Bob I am with you on this one for sure, fast? </s>
<s> Uh even if it is possible transfer rates are such methinks he would be there for a while. </s>
<s> Maybe an Esata hook up or USB3 but that would require considerable hardware modifications, sounds unlikely. </s>
<s> And I was surprised it didn't reduce the time as much as I expected. </s>
<s> My thought on this is that at USB 2.0 we are getting close to the &quot;media speed&quot; of your common HDD. </s>
<s> I'll leave this to others and you to research HDD media speed. </s>
<s> What you want may be possible and definitely can be done on non-DRM DVDs but we can't discuss DRM removal (see the forum policies.) </s>
<s> What some don't get is that when you get a commercially made Video DVD (for this example) the license or rights may limit it to play from said media. </s>
<s> I would not want to take on any court case about rips to HDD since too often I find folk will dispose or gift away the DVD and forget to dispose of the digital copy. </s>
<s> So with that we can state that if we are a little more patient then what you ask is possible. </s>
<s> But I've yet to see a DVD 4.7GB media read in single digit minutes. </s>
