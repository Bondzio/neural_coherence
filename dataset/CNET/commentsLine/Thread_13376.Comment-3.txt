you shouldn't need any drivers for your setup to work.
it should be recognized from the usb port once connected as the os supplies the necessary acknowledgement.
adding to what kees has already stated, be 100% sure the usb ports of your laptop are actually enabled.
if you installed any s/w to correct, remove or uninstall its not needed.
since, you didn't mention what os was being used, i assume its win7.
also, i assume the laptop itself was properly all updated for use to its latest, to include the os and mtrbd.
drivers and possibility bios as well.
as for s/w installed, i exclude what maybe wd bundle supplied for better use of the ext.
hd, not as a driver.
