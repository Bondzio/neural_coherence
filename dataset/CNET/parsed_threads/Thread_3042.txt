<s> When I try to start my computer after a shutdown I have to unplug the power cord from the back and wait about 30 minutes...plug it back in and it will restart. </s>
<s> I am now unplugging the cord after a shutdown (overnight say) plug it in in the morning, hit the switch and it works. </s>
<s> TIA </s>
<s> Be sure that everything is working good. </s>
<s> Is the fan working? </s>
<s> Is there dust in the unit? </s>
<s> Is your computer clean on the inside? </s>
<s> Fans are working and inside is clean. </s>
<s> Check your power unit and be sure everything is firmly set in the case. </s>
<s> After this much and it doesn't work. </s>
<s> Look to see if anyone else has had the same problem with the unit or model. </s>
<s> A replacement power unit may be needed. </s>
<s> And I did say may. </s>
<s> Will do and thanks for the help. </s>
