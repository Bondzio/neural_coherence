1.1.1	I am running xp SP2 .	St
1.1.2	Recently had a virus attack .	St
1.1.3	Now , LAN has low connectivity and a 169.234.x.x automatic private address for the ip address assigned ip instead of the usual Zyxel assigned router of 192.168.1.xxx .	St
1.1.4	What kind of problem is this ?	Ques
1.2.1	Sorry , I meant the Zyxel router ip address range is 192.168.1.101-254 .	St
1.2.2	I should be able to just let DHCP assign onew of these ip addresses in the usual way .	St
1.3.1	And you get to either use a WINSOCKFIX program or reinstall the OS .	St
1.3.2	Said fix program is out there on google .	St
1.3.3	Another common oversight is trusting Microsoft to find all the machine 's driver .	St
1.3.4	I 'll be short .	St
1.3.5	That does n't work .	St
1.3.6	Bob	St
1.4.1	I 've heard on ecan just import IE settings immediately to Firefox after downloading and installing it .	St
1.4.2	What do you think ?	Ques
1.4.3	Do n't have to be politically correct	St
1.5.1	You figure out that the assigned address is not an IE or Firefox item .	St
1.5.2	That 's an OS issue .	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	Winsockfix worked .	St
1.6.2	I heard about it here .	St
