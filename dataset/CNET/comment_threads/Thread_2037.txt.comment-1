I have a 64 bit 2800 processor with 768 of ram, a geforce fx5700 le, good hard drives and all that.
Im wondering why the heck when i play demos like far cry, and the new medal of honor it runs so crappy.
the new medal of honor demo, i ran at 1024 by 768 and it was all sluggish.
Im wondering if i would need 1 gig of ram, or maybe its my power supply, which is only 350 watts.
Any help?
Do i just need to turn my settings down?
