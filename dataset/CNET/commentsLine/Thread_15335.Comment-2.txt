we fill the drives up or addon new toys over the years.
i disagree that it's what the machine comes with.
there was a member that insisted the makers do a &quot;clean install&quot; for him but was unwilling to pay for the service.
not much can be offered that member.
i find the machines as offered to not suffer so much and in less than 15 minutes i can uninstall what i don't want.
why would i pay more to have someone do this for me?
