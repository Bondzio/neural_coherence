I'm sorry, I did not understand your message about hard drive, USB port.
My problem is with a PCI card that is supposed to give me USB 2.0 & firewire ports.
The card seems to have major driver issues with WIN XP and I do have SP2 loaded.
The people who sell this card seem to play dumb.
Just looking to see if this is a lousy generic card and that there are in fact no legit drivers out there for this.
I can't seem to find a legit tech support site for this as well.
Maybe someone can even recommend a bargain USB 2.0 card out there.
-thanks, Russ
