if you're getting any flicker at all on a crt check your display settings to make sure the refresh hasn't been changed to 60 hz rather than 72+ hz.
sometimes programs (mostly games in the past) reset this when autoswitching to a higher resolution that the crt can only display at 60 hz.
even highend crt's can do 80+ hz these days at high resolution.
