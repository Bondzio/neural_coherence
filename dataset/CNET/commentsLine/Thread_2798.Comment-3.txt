if you know your mtrbd.
can support an upgrade cpu, then besides the physical replacement, is the settings.
in older systems, that required resetting &quot;jumpers&quot; and usually your system manual or possible inside case decal -or- upon the mtrbd.
silk-screened on provided the required info.
if none, then check at the support website for a d/l'able manual and check that.
if you're real lucky the system will &quot;autoset&quot; the required setting or you manually reset via the bios rather than any jumpers.
once set, the system sees the new cpu and acknowledges it at proper setting.
this will al be seen upon boot-up on the initial dispaly.
