i've only had a problem with flaking or scratching on coated papers.
i run an &quot;eco-friendly&quot; invite business, though, so most of my work is done on recycled stock.
i find it's great for that and even when i use the pressure guide on a paper cutter, it doesn't flake off of that.
i have also had no trouble with jamming any cardstock, up to 100lb (recycled, though, not stardream).
it does misfeed envelopes occasionally, but if you load just 10 at a time, it's completely fine.
color matching, however is a big problem.
by downloading the ps driver instead of the one they recommended for vista, i was able to get some options under the &quot;properites&quot; section that help, but it doesn't keep the settings from one job to the next so i still find myself fiddling with the settings and running test prints.
particularly with pinks and browns, i've had a very difficult time with color and i'm not in a position to try another printer just yet.
any suggestions?
