this card is not listed on the ati site as it was made using the s3 savage 4 gpu in 1999 and no ati or radeon components were used.
the best driver i found was from  these drivers are for win95/98/2k.
will the 2k driver be compatible with xp?
does this mean that this agp 4x card will run on my motherboard that supports up to 2x?
also does this card support 32-bit colour, i've found nothing that says the colour modes this model supports.
thanks for your help.
