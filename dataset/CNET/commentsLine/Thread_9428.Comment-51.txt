altho waiting is a good idea, its not definate.
the newest x2 amd's on the 939 socket are awesome chips.
even the entry level 3800+ x2 will blow your mind next to that 667 mhz you have now.
as for vista, its a dumb move to install that right away.
it took ms months to fix xp when it first came out.
so my opinion is, get xp pro sp2, and an amd x2 3800+ with 1 gig of ram with a 6800gt video card and id say youll be ok for the next 2 years.
