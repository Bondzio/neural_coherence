the story repeats on quite a few models so you know to give the owners time to digest the problem.
funny you write &quot;fix the wireless card&quot; as i've yet to see anyone do that.
unless you meant &quot;replacing&quot; is the same as &quot;fixing.&quot; i tend to think fixing a card means pulling it out and replacing a component or soldering a bad joint.
but this issue is fairly well known and so are the cures.
