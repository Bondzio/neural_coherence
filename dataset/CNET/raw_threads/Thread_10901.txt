SO, I've arbitrarily/semi-contentiously put together the following components for a semi-budget gaming rig: CPU/Mobo- Bundled E8400 & ASUS-P5Q Pro (Phat dealzzzzz!) http://ncix.com/products/?sku=35037&vpn=E8400%20%26%20P5Q-PRO&manufacture=Bundle%20Deals GPU- EVGA E-GEFORCE GTX 260 Core 216 http://ncix.com/products/?sku=35503&vpn=896-P3-1255-AR&manufacture=eVGA&promoid=1025 PSU- OCZ ModXStream Pro 600W (600W enough w/ no OC'ing?) RAM- G.SKILL F2-8000CL5D-4GBPQ PC2-8000 4GB 2X2GB DDR2-1000 CL5-5-5-15 240PIN Dual Channel Memory Kit http://ncix.com/products/index.php?sku=26456&vpn=F2-8000CL5D-4GBPQ&manufacture=G.Skill&promoid=1025 Have case, but can I use the stock heat sink/fan assuming I don't OC? Pretty sure these are all compatible but I could be wrong. Alternative suggestions are appreciated (alot!) Thanks in advance!

Re the RAM...this might be worth considering ... faster and should be roughly same price. Also matches one of several 'standard RAM speeds' in the system BIOS.
