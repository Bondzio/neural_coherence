i wish.
all cd drives have a high failure rate.
cdrw drives seem to fail more often than cdrom drives.
the laser in the cdrw may be the most susceptible to failure.
have you tried cleaning the laser with a cleaning cd?
have you checked in device manager to see what is reported there?
i usually try installing the drive in another computer to check if it works there.
if all fails, you can easily replace the drive.
i find them at $19.95 after mail-in rebates, regularly, at all the major retailers in my area.
