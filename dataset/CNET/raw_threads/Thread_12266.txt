However, I have also noted that Canon makes the Selphy Compact Photo Printer which does cost less than the PIXMA. Can anyone tell me the real difference and which you would recommend? At this time, I am unable to find reviews on the PIXMA mini260, but the Selphy got great reviews. Thanks and Happy Thanksgiving!!!!!!!!!!!!

The Pixma mini260 is an inkjet printer, while the Selphys are dye sublimation. See this review of the mini260 and a comparable HP printer: http://www.behardware.com/articles/636-1/new-canon-and-hp-inkjet-printers-new-technologies.html Also check this: http://www.behardware.com/articles/608-1/survey-twelve-4.html
