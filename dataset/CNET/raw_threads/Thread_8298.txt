8874	0	113472	1288603	NR	rick wolfe	7/9/05 12:33 PM	1.12091238E12	Lost second HD	I had a computer program (Maxblast 3) that suggested my main HD was going bad. I replaced the &quot;C&quot; Drive with a larger one. I had to FDISK the new drive, then I reloaded the system Software - Win 2000. The new OS works fine. The second HD is now recognized as a FAT 16, 33GB drive though it was originally set-up as NTFS and has a Western Digital 250GB HD. It seems that the FDISK command passed to both HDs, making the second one not usable. Now what can I do? I would prefer to not format the second HD - lots of data & picture files. Is there a way that I can force the disk to be recognized as original?? Thanks in advance. Rick Wolfe
