In the beginning of the year my almost new 500 GB HD (in a 2010 MacBook Pro) crashed. I replaced it. Then my refurbished airport extreme (new) crashed also. Apple replaced it for me. I blamed the refurbishing (&quot;never gonna get refurbished any more&quot;). Then, last week, the Airpot board of my MacBook Pro went out. The Mac simply didn't recognize it anymore!! I sent it to Apple and they said I have to replace it. Now, incredibly, I come back home and my brand new Airport Extreme (that which apple gave me for my refurbished) also stopped working! Suspecting of electrical problems in my apartment I bought last week a power stabilizer (I don't know how you call it in english), which I didn't have. But it seems it didn't work out, since now my Airport failed on me..... Anyone got an idea here?? I'm seriously considering moving away from this apartment, since the building is not very trustworthy, and since in 10 years I got almost no problems with Apple whatsoever, and then this year all my hardware is failing on me!! Thank you very much for the attention, and forgive my english. Alexandre

Just sort of throwing out the idea but, if the hard drive was just a normal failure, all the other things seem to be related to wireless, I have to wonder if there is a chance that there may be some strong RF signals hitting your apartment. Possibilities might be television or radio transmitters, maybe a new cell tower in the immediate vicinity, amateur radio operator in your building, microwave transmitters (or even a malfunction mw oven?), aircraft tracking radar, or military transmitters all come to mind. I had a problem where something from a nearby airport was blasting my TV and making reception of UHF signals fail about every 12 seconds. Then one day, and I did nothing at all different, the problem cleared itself. I say from the airport because the interfering signal became less noticeable if I swung my antenna away from the direction of the airport but it was still present. I would also consider that someone else with wireless in your immediate area my be coming up on the same channel your system is trying to use and causing some conflicts. Do you have the same kind of problems if you use your MBP away from your home?
