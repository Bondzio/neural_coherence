1.2.1	well, we are not sure what you need this pc for.	St
1.2.2	if it's basic tasks like email and using the internet, that isn't a bad pc.	St
1.2.3	but since you come here asking for upgrades, maybe you are gaming or just want a faster pc.	St
1.2.4	what i would do is just buy a whole new pc.	St
1.2.5	trust me, it won't be worth it to upgrade that pc (depending on what you use it for).	St
1.2.6	everything is near out of date.	St
1.2.7	i would buy a new mobo (socket 939) 1GB of ddr400 memory &lt;200GB hard drive a nvidia 6600 graphics card (PCIe) an amd 64 3200+ cpu (s939) new case psu antec, ocz, enermax make great psus, &lt;400w the rest is up to you.	St
1.2.8	i can't really recomend upgrades since i don't know what you are looking forward to.	St
1.2.9	i just named parts that would bring you into the current generation of pc components.	St
1.2.10	konny	St
1.3.1	Unless you have some higher demands that system should be fine for many years, except for bragging purposes.	St
1.3.2	More memory will not likely help at all.	St
1.3.3	It uses PC 2100, thus I am assuming [yes I know what that means LOL], that the mobo doesn't support anything faster than PC2100.	St
1.4.1	ill just buy a brand new computher, by buy i mean ill buy the part sepratly and reable it myself hehe	Sug
1.5.1	carefully remove side cover from pc, then also very carefully remove old ram, and aslo beware of static electricity!	Sug
