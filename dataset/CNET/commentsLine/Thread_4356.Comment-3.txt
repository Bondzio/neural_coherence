since you've updated the firmware the next thing to check is your burning software.
check your nero and update it if necessary.
make sure that it isn't bumping into the native xp burning capabilities.
when you check the drive in device manager is it showing up as a dvd?
can you record other types of dvds to it fine or are you just having a problem with this one iso?
