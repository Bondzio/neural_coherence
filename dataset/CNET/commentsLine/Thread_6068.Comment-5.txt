i really meant what i said that the 24&quot; imac would be great and match the budget with software included.
fast, elegant, easy, lots of capabilities in case the users decide to expand what they do on a computer.
i own a mac and like the os a lot.
a $2.5k budget for typical computing needs is kinda like driving a luxury car for your commute.
but i'll be honest -- whereas i drive a little hybrid, i know i'd be more comfy in a lexus or benz.
