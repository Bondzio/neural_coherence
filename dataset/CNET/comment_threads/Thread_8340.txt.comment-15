I have the same model and am mad and can get no satisfaction from HP.
I can't get rid of the junk that they preinstall.
They give no operating system cd's and therefor there are popups from uninstalled programs that keep reminding me to update them.
I am thinking of a class action lawsuit against HP as they don't tell tell buyers that their adware and such can never be removed fully.
HP is not the company that it used to be.
