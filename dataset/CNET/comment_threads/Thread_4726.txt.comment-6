Just a thought.
If I r/c a blank area of the desktop and select properties it brings me to a screen that applies to my vid card.
If I go through the tabs on that screen I get to a screen that allows me to select refresh rate.
In my case it is set to default which gives me a rate slightly higher than yours.
I have tested higher rates and for my use I do not see a diff, perhaps gamers play with this stuff.
