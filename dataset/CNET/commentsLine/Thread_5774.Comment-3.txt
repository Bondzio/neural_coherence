well near similar.
i bought a system with a cd-rw in 2000. after 3 years of usage with the computer, i had never burned a cd.
so i tried, but it never read the blank cd i inserted.
so my best guess is replace your cd drive.
you might as well go for a dvd durner since they are basically dirt cheap.
i saw a couple for under 80 bucks a couple of weeks ago.
