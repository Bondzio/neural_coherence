now that we have the motherboard chipset drivers out of the way (sorry it took so long) we now have to turn our attention to what else could be causing the lockup.
it could be the use of a front port.
i read your post again but can't find the gritty details.
try the rear motherboard usb connection.
sorry if such details are needed but as you suspect when i work with the machine in the flesh i don't have to ask.
next we look in the event viewer and research drivers for the video and audio.
