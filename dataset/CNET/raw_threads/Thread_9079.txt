Probablky all you can do yourself is making a copy of the recovery disk and try that. And see if you can run Linux Live or even install Linux. Swapping hard disks with different OS'es across different makes and models of laptops is a useless excersize, I'm afraid. And repairing replacing the motherboard usually isn't cost effective, unless you can get a cheap one from another machine and install that yourself. Kees

Doesn't really help to locate it, alas. Kees

The two things you can do yourself: - remove all non-essential things from the PC (all USB-connected devices, sound card, wireless card etc) and try again with on only mouse, keyboard, hard disk and CD/DVD-drive (and video card if not integrated on the motherboard) - burn a copy of the recovery disk and try that Kees

How long since you cleaned it? Read http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-11319_7-6240575-1.html Also no make, model, age, story. If it's always done this, my advice changes. If it's certain models, my advice changes. Bob
