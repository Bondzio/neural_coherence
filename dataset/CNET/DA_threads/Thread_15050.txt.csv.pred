1.1.1	How is it going , my PC is making me ponder .	St
1.1.2	I have a 256 MB DDR 400 CL3 stick in a 3000+ AMD Sempron , my Q is why is my available physical memory only showing 30MB yet my total physical memory is 256MB .	St
1.1.3	I am running XP but the computer is only 1 month old and I am only running internet explorer on it , also if I want to upgrade my ram to hopefully solve that issue and have it run quicker , do I have to buy same brand or can I get any other brand as long as it is 256MB DDR 400 .	St
1.1.4	I have 4 slots on my memory area how much can I upgrade to ?	Ques
1.1.5	a million thanx for being there ... PS : Is there ever going to be the perfect computer ?	Ques
1.2.1	512 MB .	St
1.2.2	No need to buy the same brand .	St
1.2.3	If you have four slots , it makes me suspect that the mobo provides support for Dual Channel memory .	St
1.2.4	Are the four slots all the same color .	St
1.2.5	Maybe tell us what mobo you have .	St
1.2.6	Do you have the manual for the mobo ?	Ques
1.2.7	That should tell you the maximum amount of memory the mobo will support and the largest size stick that you can put in one slot .	Sug
1.2.8	For me , re Dual Channel , I do n't know if the Sempron 's support Dual Channel .	St
1.2.9	Possible the mobo supports it for the big brother CPU but not for the reduced capability Sempron .	St
1.2.10	What Type CPU socket does the mobo use , 754 , 939 , or 940 ? ? ?	Ques
1.2.11	The 30 MB memory issue is referring to memory not in use at that moment .	St
1.2.12	The Operating System will use as much memory that it needs at any moment .	St
1.2.13	When it runs low it uses Virtual Memory [ page file ] [ the hard drive ] which then slows things down a little .	St
1.2.14	You can always check in task manager to see how much of each is being used .	St
1.3.1	Identify the memory type and upgrade options at Crucial.com by your computer brand and name .	St
1.3.2	After you find the type of memory and amount of memory each memory slot can handle , shop around .	St
1.3.3	-nklein	St
1.4.1	You may be using a virtual memory Operating System ( OS ) .	St
1.4.2	Linux , Windows , MacOSX should use every scrap of RAM since RAM wins on speed compared to disk access .	St
1.4.3	When more RAM is needed , it 's freed or something is swapped out .	St
1.4.4	The concept of & quot ; free memory & quot ; is something you worried about in non-VM OSes such as DOS .	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	Either Socket A or 754 , thus they will NOT support dual channel .	St
1.5.2	If you have a socket 754 mobo , the only way you can use dual channel with it is to use a FX51 CPU and registered memory .	St
1.5.3	Thus no specific rules re putting in more same type memory .	St
1.6.1	Thanx for your message , regarding the memory slots I looked that up and it seems I have 4 total 2 blue color and 2 black color I cheched crucial.com and it seems I am only allowed DDR modules 400 CL3 .	St
1.6.2	I am not sure what my mobo is since the PC was open box and it did n't come with any manuals nor discs .	St
1.6.3	Thanx for your help ...	St
1.7.1	For some reason they were talking about you in the Speakeasy forums .	St
1.7.2	I personally do n't like the Speakeasy forums , as I have issues with the people in them .	St
1.8.1	If you have that information ... see what the mfg recommends .	St
1.8.2	You could also go to Corsair.com and Crucial.com and see what they say works with your PC .	St
1.8.3	If it says you need DDR400/PC3200 unbuffered ... just go to NEWEGG.COM and buy this .	St
1.8.4	You 'll never regret it and thank us forever ... .or at least for a while .	St
