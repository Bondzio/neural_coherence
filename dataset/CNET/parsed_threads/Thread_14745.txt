<s> I have a home built PC that has run fine for several years. </s>
<s> My wife noticed a burning smell the other day. </s>
<s> Before that the screen would go black with ugly message about not getting signal. </s>
<s> Only way to fix the screen messgae was to reboot. </s>
<s> Also there was a house wide power failure after all that. </s>
<s> The PC will not boot up. </s>
<s> The ONLY thing that works is the PS fan and a small fan on the mobo. </s>
<s> It is not the heatsink fan, but a smaller fan built on the mobo. </s>
<s> EPOX 8KHA+ mobo. </s>
<s> The heatsink fan does not spin, nor do the case fans, and ther are NO lights anywhere (HD, front of case, etc) Trying to figure if it is the original 400W PS (Antec) or if the mobo and/or AMD CPU is fried. </s>
<s> PC case is pretty dirty inside as well! </s>
<s> Ken </s>
<s> the CPU is fried. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> You had more than one electrical problem and thus caused a system failure. </s>
<s> Too much has been done to &quot;trust&quot; any remaining componets. </s>
<s> You could get it up and going and find it fails in short order. </s>
<s> Or worst cause another home electrical failure, now do you really want that. </s>
<s> i suggest you repair elsewhere, a friend house. </s>
<s> Tear it completely down and inspect closely devices and component level. </s>
<s> Just replace the psu, outright. </s>
<s> If anything on the mtrbd. </s>
<s> looks bad, replace it as well. </s>
<s> In other words, if it's that bad, replace entirely other than the case and &quot;MAYBE&quot; some devices. </s>
<s> You fix one problem and quite possibility a 2nd problem appears that can also falter the entire system again. </s>
<s> When it comes to electrical problems as you mention, its far safer to replace the system psu and mtrbd. </s>
<s> anew. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I remember reading about the capacitors so will inspect them. </s>
<s> I plan to replace the PS and possibly the heatsink fan. </s>
<s> The heatsink fan DOES turn for a second when power is applied but stops. </s>
<s> if none of that works then I will pull the mobo and use the spare one I have. </s>
<s> Of course no guarantee that the CPU is not fried as was suggested. </s>
<s> Just trying to do the lowest cost items first! </s>
<s> I can't remember if I mentioned in the original post that the PS fan DOES run but someone said that does not rule out a bad PS. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
