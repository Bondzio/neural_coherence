hello, this is my first thread on the cnet forums.
anyway, i plan on buying a netbook pretty soon, which is the asus eee pc 1005 hab, which includes windows xp.
i plan on using it for itunes, backup storage, maybe some school work, but i think the main focus is for itunes.
can the netbook i mentioned be used without problems?
will itunes be limited because of the netbook hardware?
i know you cant watch hd or sd video, play itunes extras and whatnot, but can i use itunes for ipod management, like restoring and downgrading and whatnot?
also, just a personal preference, but can you change the color of the xp taskbar from the blue color?
:p
