1.1.1	Hello folks, I have been researching SuperDrives for my Jan 2008 A1181 Dual Core.	St
1.1.2	There seem to be 3 main compatable models; GSAS10N, UJ-857C, and UJ-867A.	St
1.1.3	I know they must be capped at 8xDVD and I want Dual layer ability.	St
1.1.4	The UJ867A by Panasonic seems to fit what I want.	St
1.1.5	Here are my 2 ?s.	St
1.1.6	1.	St
1.1.7	Is the Panasonic 867A (Nov 2010) 9.5mm the best choice?	St
1.1.8	2.	St
1.1.9	SATA or PATA?	St
1.1.10	I know SATA is a bit faster but is that what's in there already?	St
1.1.11	The 2010 new Super i am looking at is PATA, is the current Optical a SATA?	St
1.1.12	And should I just try to find a SATA UJ-857C in good shape?	St
1.1.13	I know somewhere someone has already asked smthg similar but by page 20 and the CNet search yielded no answers.	St
1.1.14	Thank You for any help!	St
1.2.1	and be assured that you have the right optical drive for your machine.	St
1.2.2	SATA or PATA depends entirely on what is already in there.	St
1.2.3	http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/optical-drives/superdrives/ P	St
1.3.1	I have been there.	St
1.3.2	I have watched about 6 videos and 30 sites including Amazon and EBay to view over 300 different drives dating from mid '07 to current.	St
1.3.3	There are 3 (so far) types that claim to be OEM replacement Supers for the already installed Optical.	St
1.3.4	Some claim the replacement is SATA and Some claim PATA all for the exact model I have.	St
1.3.5	Removing the current drive and looking at what's in there is an option but the SATAs and PATAs both claim to offer the adapting cable to utilize the other format.	St
1.3.6	I have been building and configuring computers for 22 years.	St
1.3.7	From the old Pizza box desktops to UU19 racks and this is the craziest thing I've ever run accross.	St
1.3.8	It's a A1181, Feb 2008, MB402LL/A, MacBook 4.1, Dual Core 2.1, currently running Snow Leopard.	St
1.3.9	How hard should this be?	St
1.3.10	All three types listed in my first post claim to be OEM.	St
1.3.11	This is a crapshoot.	St
1.3.12	If i can't get specific info to buy the drive (ranging from $25 to $200) I'm just going to throw a dart and see where it lands.	Ques
1.3.13	Thanks for the response so far, I do appreciate it.	Polite
1.3.14	I'm just frustrated.	St
1.4.1	http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/superdrive/MacBook_13 P	St
1.5.1	Same version, the 10N, as a new EIDE on Amazon for $50 from Panasonic which claims to be OEM brand.	St
1.5.2	There are 3 model types and two connectivity standards for the exact same model.	St
1.5.3	I understand OEM can be several different companies due to supply chain issues.	St
1.5.4	It's the 2 connectivity standards that claim to be original for the exact same model I question.	St
1.5.5	Any thanks, I know Mercury.	St
1.5.6	They are quality.	St
1.5.7	Just twice the price.	St
1.5.8	Thanks, cheers!	St
