Since you've got both vga and dvi inputs, it will be easy if you've got an xbox360 since you can pickup a vga output at most places that sell the 360.
If you've got a classic Xbox, vga adapters were made but they seem to have disappeared -- check ebay If your console has component outputs, ebay has transcoder for about $50 but i don't know how good/bad the picture quality will be.
