<s> hey im going to buy and new comp pretty soon here and i just wanted to know if i should get one or two gigs. </s>
<s> I hear 2 gigs isnt much diff then one in gaming only like 3 FPS. </s>
<s> Im getting XMS ram for sure i just cant afford 2 gigs of XMS so if i do get 2 gigs its would only be normal. </s>
<s> Most people hardly ever use above 1gb of memory. </s>
<s> 1gb is plenty for games and it isn't, add a 512mb stick and you will have 1.5gb of memory; plenty for games. </s>
<s> People that use 2gb of memory are doing some intensive projects like photo-editing and video-editing. </s>
<s> PCMagazine had an article of how they compared 7 gaming rigs from high-end vendors such as Alienware and Falcon Northwest, and all their systems had 1gb of memory (except for one system, and you are right, 2gb doesn't make much of a difference). </s>
<s> Yet all those systems still ran games such as Halflife 2 and Splinter CELL in the highest resolutions with AA turned on just fine. </s>
<s> 1gb will be fine for your gaming rig. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> know why you're buying it. </s>
<s> if you do not care about the minimal difference between corsair value and xms nor are you overclocking, than the price difference is not justifiable. </s>
<s> Besides, you can always o'c your ram, changing the timings would get you where you want to go and buy some memory heatspreaders, and you've got corsair xms. </s>
<s> The fsb speed is the most important anyways. </s>
<s> If you really want to o'c just buy pc4200, pc4800, etc... Roger </s>
<s> Unless you really have some need for 2 gigs of RAM, 1 should be plenty for gaming. </s>
<s> Unless you enjoy running a lot of background apps while gaming, you won't really notice a difference at all. </s>
<s> Keep in mind that RAM isn't going to affect gaming that much as long as you have enough. </s>
<s> If you want to see the biggest FPS increase, consider purchasing a new video card or a faster processor. </s>
