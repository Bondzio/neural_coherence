<s> Hi, I hope someone can help. </s>
<s> I have a Compaq Presario that's about 5 years old. </s>
<s> I did a automatic windows update and it asked to do a restart to finish. </s>
<s> I did and when the computer restarted I got this error. </s>
<s> &quot;Disk Boot Failure, Insert system disk and press enter. </s>
<s> I've replaced a cmos battery, made sure all the cabling is secure and yes when in bios the hard drive is not registering even when you try to find it in bios. </s>
<s> I've purchased a new hard drive and but can only get the bios to reconize it when I ask it to detect it and then when I save and exit I still get the same error. </s>
<s> The CD-ROM is being seen as well as the floppy and yes I've tried reseting the defaults in bios. </s>
<s> This is the first time this happen and I can't seem to resolve it. </s>
<s> I'm running Windows XP home. </s>
<s> Oh and one more thing, even though the CD is showing up in the bios and has power, for I can load a system cd in the tray it won't run. </s>
<s> What the F*#%. </s>
<s> Please Help me if you can. </s>

<s> Enter the BIOS and verify if USB used, disable, exit and save. </s>

<s> 1. </s>
<s> &quot;When I exit the BIOS I get the same error&quot;. </s>
<s> That seems OK with a new hard disk until you partition and format it and install an OS on it. </s>
<s> You don't tell anything about that. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> &quot;The CD won't run&quot;. </s>
<s> What exactly does that mean? </s>
<s> If you set the BIOS to boot from the CD first, and put a bootable Windows XP CD in it (check on another PC that it IS bootable, just to be sure), what happens? </s>
<s> If BIOS set to boot from CD, the CD is bootable on another machine and doesn't boot here, first replace the CD-drive; if that doesn't help it's time to replace the motherboard. </s>

<s> Might be corruption in MBR or MFR files on HD. </s>
<s> Many commercial defraggers do not defrag these items they maybe so fragmented there creating errors. </s>
<s> Also try uninstalling the RAM and reinstalling it this might clear these errors as well, bad RAM might do this also. </s>
<s> If you can get it started again check the virtual memory settings. </s>
<s> Set them to &quot;system managed&quot; or larger then the &quot;system managed&quot; size. </s>
<s> Follow Willy's suggestion on this one, then try these. </s>
