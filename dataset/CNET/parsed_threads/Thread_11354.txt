<s> At times, after a hibernate or just a long inactivity, I cannot get on line, I have to reboot. </s>
<s> The PC has a Shuttle main board with built in NIC. </s>
<s> Other PCs on my network can get on line ok as they have PC card NICs. </s>
<s> Before I try this I thought I'd ask. </s>
<s> I have a PC NIC that I can plug in. </s>
<s> I want to disable the on board NIC in System, Hardware and install the PC NIC. </s>
<s> Does anyone forsee any problems? </s>

<s> For my board it was in the BIOS peripherals. </s>
<s> Disabled it and plugged in a NIC. </s>
