My boyfriend got the same external hardrive and when he istalled it, it only took 4 gigs. He needed to get someone over to reformatt it to be able to work with his machine. My machine has 160G.So i am jumping ahead in case I too will have to reformatt. If it is easy, i will attempt it myself,if not I will have someone come over. I was hoping you just plug it into the usb and go. Maybe that is the case. Thanks!

Now plug in the USB cable into the PC. The PC should acknowledge that the drive was plugged in. Once the system recognizes the HDD.. - Go to Start - Got to Settings - Go to Control Panel - Go to Adminstrative Tools - Go to Computer Management - Go to Disk Management - Look for a drive in the right windows with &quot;Unallocated Space&quot; - Select the drive with the &quot;Unallocated Space&quot;. - From there you'll need to create a partition (logical or primnary) on the new drive using all the space - Once the partition is created (disk space allocated) then you can format it...thereafter it's ready for use. - Just make sure sure you've identified the new NEW DRIVE before partitioning or formatting. Let us know. VAPCMD

Before all that I was having other problems anyway so I had the computer tech guy come over and install the second hardrive and other technical stuff. (I didn't want to mess anything up further). I appreciate having the forum though for help!Thanks again! Plymouth vacation
