This was part of the Compaq Presario 4550 given to me last year. It also contained CD-Rom, Floppy, and Zip drives. I only used the ethernet nic to backup data from my XP and then disconnected the power connection.(SYNCBACK 5 STARS!) I have a guess why the 4550 was changed this way but not sure. Anyhow, this year I was given an HP Pavilion 6746C. I had to replace the PSU, Floppy, and Hdd. So, I traded the AT PSU(4550) for an ATX, and the old Floppy(4550) for another at my computer club. Then, I put the above hardware into the 6746c.(Celeron 733MHz) The more I read about ATA the confusier I get. I'm guessing this setup in the 6746C maybe should just be connected to the motherboard and remove the Promise IDE controller. I still use the 6746C for backup to the XP system with an ethernet connection and SYNCBACK.

They could increase the number of IDE devices one could put in older PCs whose motherboards only allowed for 4. As well, some older motherboards couldn't take advantage of the size or speed of newer drives. By now, this is all past. If your motherboard specs say they support ATA-133 which your drive can handle, you can yank the Promise card. There isn't much use for these anymore.

The Pavilion 6746C Trigem Cognac board supports PIO Mode 3 and 4. So, does the 40GB HDD run at the 133 speed, or revert to the lower speed of the mother board ? The history is interesting to me since I started clicking in the PC world in 2004 with a Dell 2400. Promise no longer sells the 133TX2. The 6746C sold for $800 real money in Y2K.
