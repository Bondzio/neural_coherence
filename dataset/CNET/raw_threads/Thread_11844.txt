I am considering buying a white macbook soon, $1300 version, and was wondering what kind of difference upgrading from 1 to 2 gigs of RAM would make. I will be using all the iLife programs, maybe some video editing, DVD watching, and maybe some gaming (obviously not new games, I know it has a bad vid card.) I was just wondering what affect the upgrade would have (it is $175) and if you think it's worth it. Also, do you think a bigger hard drive (120 gig) for $150 is worth it? Thanks! P.S. Please no &quot;just get a pro&quot; or anything of that nature. Thanks again!

If you do not have a problem with the extra cash, a 120GB would be fine for what you have described. Remember though that an external Firewire drive would have a larger storage space for less money. The drive would also be a full sized on running at 72000 rpm and probably a larger cache than is on the internal. That video card is not exactly bad, just not as good as it could have been. P
