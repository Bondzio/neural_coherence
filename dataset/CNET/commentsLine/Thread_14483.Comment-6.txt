i had same problem 2x's,once with the b router and once with the a+g+b router.i ended up removing all hardware and software and starting over.then i called comcast and they made sure i connected when hooked up direct and then they told me turn off every thing modem router and computer,also the direct hook up to my omputer,then to wait 1 min, plug modem back in,then wait 1 min and plug router back in,then wait one min and turn computer back on and wireless works fine.i also had the wireless card in my computer and installed before i did the above.
hope this helps you,if all else falls call comcast they were very helpfull.
