<s> Having problems with both CDRW and DVD. </s>
<s> Windows sees the drives in &quot;My Computer&quot; but is having problem reading data or even recognizing that a CD is in the drive. </s>
<s> Was trying to Burn a CD today and got a message that an error was received from the &quot;Output Device&quot; (the CDRW) with the suggestion to check that the drive is installed. </s>
<s> Does this mean to check the cables like I saw recommended in another post? </s>
<s> I would think that if a cable is loose or disconnected that the drive wouldn't even be recognized. </s>
<s> I was able to reboot once and the drive recognized data on a CD but would not burn a CD. </s>
<s> Will also do some housecleaning inside . </s>
<s> Thanks patti </s>
<s> Where's the first question? </s>
<s> http://cma.zdnet.com/texis/forums/allposts.html?p=pj9585 There is an ongoing discussion with what looks to be a failed Mad dog dvd/cdrw drive. </s>
<s> The owner appears to be in denial about it, but do read that discussion to see what to try. </s>
<s> Here's the discussion so you can save yourself from the same dialogue. </s>

<s> This was my first question. </s>
<s> I was referring to a couple of other posts regarding CD/DVD in this forum. </s>
<s> Sorry if I mislead you. </s>
<s> Thanks for the link to other question/answers. </s>
<s> It did answer one of my questions about jumpers. </s>
<s> I'll try the housekeeping routine first and a CD cleaner. </s>
<s> This isn't my PC. </s>
<s> I was helping a friend and I know she doesn't have the extra money to buy a new CD burner right now so was hoping there might be some other suggestions. </s>
<s> Thanks Patti </s>
<s> Some get bulk CDRs and run into a bad batch. </s>
<s> For instance I get a bad batch and the CDR needed help since the ATIP information called the CDR 40X but the speed was really 16X. </s>
<s> Nero allowed me to set the record speed to 16X and the CDR was usable. </s>
<s> I felt this was OK for me, but not for others. </s>
<s> If you want to know about ATIP and more, type CDR FAQ into google.com Bob </s>
