Hi I just bought a HP Pavilion dv9000t series custom few days back to replace my iMac. I chose this computer for HP reputation and it came with HDMI out. I wanted to know if HDMI is the same thing as a DVI with sound can I use this as a output to connect the laptop to my 22&quot; gateway display with DVI as a extended desktop? I talked with someone at radioshack about this and they sold me a cable with HDMI out and DVI in attached. Today I talked with someone who thought the HDMI was only used for TVs and not display. Is this true? If it is do anyone know what the cable I bought is used for? Did I waste fifty bucks too? Thank you for your help.

It's just I used DVI with the Last two Macs I had and I don't want to go back to VGA connection ever again. I never seen or heard of a HDMI on a PC or a Mac before and it raised some doubt after hearing and only seeing HDMI only in TV related products. Again thank you.
