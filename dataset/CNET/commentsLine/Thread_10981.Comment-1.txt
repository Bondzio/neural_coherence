hi i want to buy a portable hard drive (2.5&quot; inch external with casing).
250 gb seems appropriate capacity for me.
i have used two portable hard drives (hitachi travelstar, 80gb and 160gb, bought without enclosure and fixed into one later).
both of them seem to be working fine still.
one for about 2 years and another one for 8 months.
now i am not too sure which company to rely on.
hitachi don't make drives like wd and others which come packed into the casing.
is it a better idea to buy a hard drive and its enclosure separately ?
or the ones (that come with enclosures) sold by manufacturers are 'more' reliable?
i am looking at toshiba, wd, lacie, iomega.
not too sure which one to go with.
any advice or personal experiences will be really helpful.
thanks
