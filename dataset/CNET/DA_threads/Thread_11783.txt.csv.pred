1.1.1	What would be better - use an old win98 machine , get one of those marketed 'kids computers & quot ; or actually buy one of those & quot ; $ 299 & quot ; bait and switch models ?	Ques
1.1.2	Looking to spend the minimum for a system useable for a couple of years - under $ 500 total .	St
1.1.3	I do n't have the specs on the win98 right now , but it was a top of the line system in 1998 ( K5or6 ?	Ques
1.1.4	AMD chip ) , designed for scientific research/big number crunching , and has a monitor that works , network card , etc .	St
1.1.5	My 4 year old twins are using computers at pre-school already and keep wanting to use my Dell Inspiron E1705 laptop - no way !	St
1.1.6	They have an older brother in another household with a playstation - so they want to play games too ( as does he when he visits ) .	St
1.1.7	If it was just the little ones , I think I might be able to make my old windows 98 machine do , but I do n't know if it could handle Power Rangers Super Legends ( what they are begging for ) .	St
1.1.8	ADVICE ?	Ques
1.2.1	Since that game is on the PS2 , just put it there - & gt ; http : //www.us.playstation.com/PS2/Games/Power_Rangers_Super_Legends As to the 299 desktops , I 'm unsure what you mean by bait and switch .	St
1.2.2	I walk into these stores put the box in the cart , wheel it up to the cash register and check out .	St
1.2.3	Is n't that how it works ?	Ques
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	I 'm very doubtful that you would find much software on the market today that will run on a Windows 98 computer .	St
1.3.2	I personally am not familiar with & quot ; Power Rangers Super Legends & quot ; but if it 's a recent game it almost certainly will require more computer than an old Win98 machine .	St
1.3.3	You would probably be restricted to whatever software you already have for it , or any you could locate .	St
1.3.4	As far as the & quot ; $ 299 & quot ; computers , in my experience their upgrade -ability is usually limited or non-existent , so if you ca n't get what you want up-front with one , you 're probably not going to be doing many improvements in the future .	St
1.4.1	As a parent , I prefer not to have video game consoles in my house - too many issues .	St
1.4.2	The PS2 is at the older brother 's house , not mine - he just visits .	St
1.4.3	I 'm not a total grinch - I will let the boys have a few games since they want them so bad , but only on a computer where I have more control .	St
1.4.4	Besides , I bought a nice TV for the family room because I want to watch a movie or the news in the evening - not level 5 of Dragonslayer XV .	St
1.4.5	I 'm asking about the & quot ; realistic & quot ; system requirements because I do n't play games or know anyone else that does .	St
1.4.6	I need help with what is a useable low level system these days , because I have n't used something less than a powerhouse for the past decade .	St
1.4.7	What I need for GIS applications is extreme overkill for surfing the web or word processing .	St
1.4.8	My problem with $ 299 computers ?	Ques
1.4.9	- probably nothing for a knowledgable user like on this board , but they are advertised towards the first time buyer/novice user , who often gets taken advantage of when they go to the store to get it .	St
1.4.10	I 've heard the same story too many times from my freshman students , and especially elderly friends and family members .	St
1.4.11	Bait and Switch - advertise a very low price machine and sell an expensive one .	St
1.4.12	If it is a useable out of the box system they only have extremely limited numbers in stock with no rainchecks , or if in stock , it is most often a stripped down machine that requires an additional $ 500+ to be min .	St
1.4.13	functional .	St
1.4.14	If you understand what comes ( or does n't come ) with a $ 299 system they can be great deals for the knowledgeable .	Ques
1.4.15	I 'm upset that salesmen pounce on the gulliable first time buyer who comes in thinking they are going to walk out the door with a brand new $ 300 computer fully loaded and ready to go and either steer them to a much more expensive system ( usually put on a store branded credit card at 24.9 % interest ) which is what happens to my students , or sell them expensive monitors , keyboards , printers , etc and unneeded peripherals and software .	St
1.4.16	Last spring salesmen at one of the big elecronics stores convinced my widowed neighbor that she had to have an expensive monitor , joysticks and gamepads , wireless everything , wireless networking , etc - OH -and of course the $ 299 system could n't take the network , video , and sound cards she & quot ; had to & quot ; have , so she ended up with an upgraded system suitable for a serious gamer - all because she mentioned her grandkids visit at the holidays .	St
1.4.17	Basically they sold her the system they wanted .	St
1.4.18	Thousands of wasted dollars for a little 69 y.o .	St
1.4.19	grandmother , first time user , who wanted to be able to receive email from her family , print photographs , and look up medical information on the web .	St
1.4.20	The real kicker - when she got concerned about the escalating price - they threw in a & quot ; free & quot ; printer - which is absolutely lousy at both text and color printing .	St
1.4.21	Yes , probably one of her kids ( 500 miles away ) should have gone with her , but I resent the fact that novice computer users , who often have the least money to waste , are misled by ads in newspaper flyers and fall prey to these shady practices .	St
1.4.22	Some of these guys give used car salesmen a run for their money .	St
1.5.1	I 'm pretty sure the old win98 could go up to Win2000 ( if I still have system disks for that version somewhere ) .	St
1.5.2	Not that there are that many programs left that run on 2000 either probably .	St
1.5.3	We just kept it around at win98 to run some old programs , and it is the trusty back-up everytime the new ones crash and burn - it always works !	St
1.5.4	One of the two hard drives had to be replaced when it was 18 months old - no other problems since then .	St
1.5.5	It is the indestructable beast - built in a local computer shop in Tucson , it has outlasted 3 newer workstations ( 2 Dells and a HP ) - that is why I thought it could withstand 4 year olds .	St
1.5.6	If I knew a good computer repair place around here I 'd buy a used XP , but I 'm in a small town and have not been impressed with the one I know in town - their used computers are really overpriced .	St
1.5.7	That is why if I do n't use the win98 , I 'm looking for something new but cheap for the kids- I 'm probably going to have to buy on-line .	St
1.6.1	For games I have to write that today you want a Core 2 Duo , 2GB RAM and the Nvidia 8800 or better display card .	St
1.6.2	At 99 bucks for a PS2 I think this is the better solution and it has that game they want .	St
1.6.3	As to the bait and switch I must be not going to the right stores .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	thanks for the system rec 's If I went with the PS2 to play games , - maybe 10 hours a month- , I would have buy a 2nd TV to sit in the same family room as our other TV , which we only watch a couple of hours a day anyway .	St
1.7.2	To use it as a TV , would require dropping new coax - not easy in a old house and get a second sat .	St
1.7.3	receiver and monthly fee .	St
1.7.4	No cost savings at all .	St
1.7.5	The game station wo n't enable them to use the internet , educational software , or do their homework assignments -yes , preschoolers have homework now ! - that even the old win98 computer will .	St
1.7.6	The game use is really the least important reason I 'm getting them their own computer .	St
1.7.7	BUT , if I do have a system which can play some games , then it might cut down on the whining from their brother when he visits , since it seems he ca n't go a weekend without constant TV and video games .	St
1.8.1	http : //www.geeks.com/details.asp ? invtid=AVC-1400 & cpc=SCH It was 10 bucks and solved that issue .	St
1.8.2	So I can see 99 bucks for the PS2 , 10 bucks for that and whatever for the game .	St
1.8.3	Far cheaper than what a & quot ; gamer PC & quot ; will cost .	St
1.8.4	Bob	St
