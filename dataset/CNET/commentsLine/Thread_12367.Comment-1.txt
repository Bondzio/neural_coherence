i have a dell dimension 4600 series, and am about to purchase a 4700 series (has a different processor, chipset, ram, pretty much everything).
in order to preserve my data and restore the 4600 series to its original state, i was just going to physicall switch hard drives on the two pc's.
would this cause any problems (ie.
bios issues)?
would the computer recognize all of the changes to the system and make the appropriate adjustments?
