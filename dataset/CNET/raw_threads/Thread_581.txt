2432	0	353035	3096570	NR	lupanarium	8/6/09 9:46 AM	1.24955196E12	Slaving Macs	I'm working on an effects heavy project using giant images. This workload is killing my machine even though it is a 8 core with 14GB of RAM. My co-editor is working on a Dual Core with 10GB of RAM. I would like to 'slave' these machines to maximise my processing speed for Final Cut Pro and After Effects. However I have absolutely no idea how to do this or if this is the best option. Could someone please explain to me firstly what I would need to do in a step by step to hook up the machines and secondly if this is worth it. Or is there perhaps another techinique. Thanks Andy
