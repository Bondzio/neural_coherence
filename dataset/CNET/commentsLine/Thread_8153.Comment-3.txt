hi, also if you have such problem appears rather often, it better to use hard drive backup software .
create full image of hdd and keep it on dvd/cd or external hdd (in your case it will be very usefull).
and whenever you need, you could easily and fast restore system as ity was before.
really recommend, i always use this way to be sure that all my important data is safe (including os and all apps).
