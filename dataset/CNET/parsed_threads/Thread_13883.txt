<s> hi everybody Thanks for Reading my post. </s>
<s> I have bought an ipod touch and tried to connect to my wireless router. </s>
<s> However it would't connect even though I entered the correct wep password. </s>
<s> Looking at other forums I turned the security off on the router and my ipod then connected. </s>
<s> However I would rather have security on my network, so I decided to change a couple of other settings using my computer. </s>
<s> One of these was the MAC address filtering. </s>
<s> I decided to enable it! </s>
<s> However as soon as I did this the computer disconnected. </s>
<s> I am now unable to connect with the computer or a laptop because of the MAC address filtering and can't connect my iPod because of the security. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated with these 2 problems. </s>
<s> The most important is getting internet connection back, and secondly allowing my iPod to connect with security still enabled. </s>
<s> Thank you very much for your help. </s>
<s> Anything will be appreciated. </s>
<s> WEP and MAC FILTERING is not secure at all. </s>
<s> Figure 2 to 5 minutes for today's tools to crack and connect or at least interfere with your connection. </s>
<s> It's why our forum sticky offers another setup. </s>
