the g5 is nothing like the g4.
the g5 uses serial drives while the g4 uses ide drives.
setting ide drives to cable select eliminates the problems you describe with the ide cable.
it does not matter, on a mac, where the drives, master or slave, are located on the ide cable as the mac is capable of booting from either drive.
it apparently matters on a pc though.
