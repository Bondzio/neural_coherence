<s> Computer Specs: Sony Vaio Windows XP Pro P4 at 1.5GHz 128MB RDRAM 60G HD I am having trouble with the computer.. First off for some reason, one day the mouse or keyboard stop working...so i tried a different mouse and keyboard with no luck....there are 2 USB ports in the front and one in the back... </s>
<s> It was plugged into the USB ports....I also tried the other old port also, i think its called the serial/com port? </s>
<s> but still no luck.... Then I tried resetting the bios by taking out the battery on the motherboard....but once i turn the computer back on....the main bios screen came on, but since I cant use the keyboard to escape out of the bois...i cant get into windows....now i am stuck in the bois screen...i also tried buying a PCI 2.0 USB card....but i cant install it since i cant get in windows to install the driver.... ANY HELP PLEASE!???? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Sadly, if the ports are dead and other PS2 and USB keyboards fail then I look to transfering what parts I can into a new box with another compatible motherboard. </s>
<s> It's out of stock, but 423 socket boards can be cheap. </s>
<s> http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=D850GBACNR-R Then you get a new case and start moving it. </s>
<s> The OS hopefully will run on worst case will have to be obtained and installed. </s>
<s> Do some checks to see what Sony wants for repair and then how much for motherboard, case/powersupply and maybe an operating system. </s>
<s> Best of luck, bob </s>
<s> hey r. proffitt....Sony wants 400$ just for the motherboard....i can't deal with that...are you sure its a 423 socket board for this computer? </s>
<s> cause im planning to just buy a motherboard like sony's PCV-RX model and just use all the other parts like processor and such from sony on the new board.... </s>
<s> You can use google.com to research what a 423 socket CPU looks like as well as a 478 socket CPU. </s>
<s> Then you can answer that question. </s>
<s> You post is all I know of your machine's failure. </s>
<s> Since you've tried the other ports with known good keyboards... 400 is far too much for this repair. </s>
<s> You can find boards galore for 99 bucks. </s>
<s> I wouldn't do this. </s>
<s> 400 gets a new box... with XP... http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=CMHP552W-R&cat=SYS there are many more out there like this and frankly that repair price is a _____ (pick a word). </s>
