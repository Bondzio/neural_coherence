I have read elsewhere that you have to use a 2wire product, but I find it hard to believe that no one has developed a product to fill this demand (SBC/Yahoo DSL has many customers). Can anyone help with this? A 2wire adapter costs almost half as much as I spent to build my daughter's computer. Thanks: Blackflame

That's a standard and the cheapest 802.11b pcmcia card I ever dredged up was 8 dollars. On average it's closer to 20 or 30. It's not proprietary (802.11b) so why not? Bob
