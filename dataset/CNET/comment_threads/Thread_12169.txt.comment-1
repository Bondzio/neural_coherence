I have a new desktop running Vista Home Premium Edition.
I have a printer hooked up to it.
I have a laptop running XP Media Center and is networked to the desktop via a wireless router.
When I try to print from my laptop it does not recognize the printer.
I think I have the desktop set to share the printer.
Fbref.
