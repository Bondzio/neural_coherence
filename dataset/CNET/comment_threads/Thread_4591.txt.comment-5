All the appropriate DMA entries in hard disk and CD drives were checked as instructed and no changes were required.
&quot;In Control Panel/Multimedia/Multimedia Properties/C:Media WDM Audio Device/&quot;Status:Driver is enabled but inactive due to an unknown problem&quot; Additionally 'Use audio features on this device' is enabled.&quot; This is indeed the case as would be seen from a screen shot were I but able to attach one.
That just leaves the excessive memory problem you suggested, which leaves me up the creek without a paddle Again many thanks
