<s> I am looking for a new computer, and have come up with a problem; case design. </s>
<s> Like a lot of people, my ''desktop'' really sets on the floor next to my desk. </s>
<s> And like a lot of people, I use USB devices, flash memories and aux keypads, and others, that plug into USB ports on the front of my case. </s>
<s> The problem; the USB ports are placed on the lowest point on the front of the case, and the cords on the aux components are short. </s>
<s> They just barely reach the top of my desk, or can't be moved far enough onto the desk to be readily used. </s>
<s> Are there any case manuf. </s>
<s> that put the ports closer to the top, or on top of the case insted of the bottom front? </s>
<s> The USB ports on the back are already full of things I don't change out, like wireless keyboard and printer conections. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Don't they have extension cords for that? </s>
