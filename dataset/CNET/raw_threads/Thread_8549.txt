Well, you can custom build with just about any of the computer companies like Dell, Gateway, HP/Compaq, Velocity Micro, I Buy Power, ABS Computer Tech, Monarch Computers, American Computeh, cyber-Power, etc... I didn't list the major high end gaming custom computer companies. But, with $1000 (not including a monitor or printer) you will not be traveling with the high end gamers. However, you will be able to play the latest/greatest games without problems. (Just a high end Video Card will eat up $500+, and heavens to betsy if you go with a 10,000 RPM Hard Drive, high end CPU/Mobo,& RAM.) The main guts for a gaming PC is the Video Card, RAM, and CPU. It is a matter of going thru with each company trying to get the best CPU/Motherboard, then Video Card, and RAM. Sometimes you can skimp on the video card and RAM getting a less powerful one when configuring with a company, keeping in mind that you can beat their prices by buying separately elsewhere, removing the lesser ones, and installing a more powerfully one yourself, and still stay within the $1000 limit (without monitor/printer). I'm off to Church right now, then to watch NASCAR on TV, but when I get some time in a day or so, I'll see what I can scratch up for you, but suggest you take pen in hand, and with fingers roaming over your keyboard try to do it yourself.
