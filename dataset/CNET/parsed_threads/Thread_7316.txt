<s> A friend has an Acer laptop running Vista Home Premium with 3GB of RAM. </s>
<s> It is connected wirelessly to a new Linksys wireless router. </s>
<s> The other laptops in the house work fine (XP). </s>
<s> When I go into the 'Network and Sharing Center' in Vista, the center icon which denotes the network says &quot;Identifying...&quot; and stays there most of the time. </s>
<s> Every now and then it changes to &quot;Multiple Networks&quot; but then switches back to &quot;Identifying...&quot;. </s>
<s> It very rarely displays the correct SSID. </s>
<s> We updated the wireless adapter driver with no change. </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be welcome. </s>
