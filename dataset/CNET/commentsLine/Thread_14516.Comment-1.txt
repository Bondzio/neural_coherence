ahem!
a while back my son-in-law, who is a wonderful fellow but works on a computer from the dark side (pc), was clued into a way to add wireless access to his computer without having an internal card.
it was a little thing that looked like a stick, and i believe it was just inserted into a place on the back of the computer.
it worked just fine.
in some ads for places selling computer supplies, i saw just such a thing (i think), but i (1) don't know whether such a thing exists for macs and (2) whether my computer--sawtooth g4 desktop--is compatible with anything now being sold for that purpose.
the computer never had an airport card, and if i wanted one, i'd have to search for an old one (probably 11b).
i think i'd need the older versions of other equipment that goes with such an old card, too, so i was wondering whether that would pertain also to the kind of external wireless device i started talking about here.
if i could buy something current, and if it was easy to install, what a blessing that would be!
forgive my ignorance.
i don't even know what the thing is called, and i am aware that what i'm asking for may be totally out of reach, but hope springs eternal.
