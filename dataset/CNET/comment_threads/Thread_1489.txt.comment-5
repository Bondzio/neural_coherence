Changing the motherboard and adding another card(in this case another 8600GT)isn't the most practical solution, imo.
Don't expect leaps and bounds with 8600GT SLi.
Getting a single 8800GT (OC or not) would be better.
If you really want dual gpu, you could try 9800GX2 which is ridiculously priced or the humble HD3870 X2.
both have 2 gpus in one PCB so it means you can use your old board but getting an sli or xfire solution.
