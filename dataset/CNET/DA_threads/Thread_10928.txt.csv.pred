1.1.1	I can not believe I am having this much trouble finding a laser printer that prints on 80 lbs ( 216 gsm ) coverstock that is 3 1/2 & quot ; x 4 7/8 & quot ; - typical 4bar or A1 flat card size .	St
1.1.2	Why is this not something that laser printers can do ?	Ques
1.1.3	Again , I want to be able to print on an A1 flat card size piece of coverstock ( 80 lbs or 216 gsm ) .	St
1.1.4	Anyone have any ideas ? ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks for your help !	St
1.2.1	https : //www.google.com/ # safe=off & sclient=psy-ab & q=laser+printer+80+lbs for example finds prior discussions .	St
1.2.2	You can hit hp.com and it 's chat button among other makers to ask directly .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	That 's why i am asking here .	St
1.3.2	The key to this question is the SIZE of the paper ( A1/4bar/3 1/2 & quot ; x4 7/8 & quot ; ) AND the thickness of 80 # or 216GSM .	St
1.3.3	I have been on the phone/online chat with HP , Xerox and Dell and seems most of the people answering the phones can not understand what 3.5 & quot ; wide means , let alone 4 7/8 & quot ; in height .	St
1.3.4	Does ANYONE know of a laser printer that can print on an A1 flat card ( 3 1/2 & quot ; x 4 7/8 & quot ; ) size piece of coverstock ( 80 lbs or 216 gsm ) .	St
1.3.5	Thanks !	St
1.4.1	I read http : //www.shopping.hp.com/en_US/home-office/-/products/Printers/HP-LaserJet/CC489A and see this .	St
1.4.2	& quot ; postcard , 3 x 5 in , 4 x 6 in & quot ; So while it hit your weight of the paper it missed the 5 inch side by 1/8 inch .	St
1.4.3	It appears nothing does this .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	This appears to be something your print shops produce .	St
1.5.2	I think they would consider a printer like this one .	St
1.5.3	http : //www.machinerydir.com/product/Cartridge+Id+Card % 2Fu-disk+Printer+A1 % 2Fyd-7880c-siowg-hpshpio.html Bob	St
1.6.1	Now you see the reason for the post , Bob ?	Ques
1.6.2	Actually most smaller print shops buy the 8.5 & quot ; x 11 & quot ; cardstock ( 80 # ) paper , print and then have it cut to size .	St
1.6.3	All printers I have seen say they can handle custom sizes from width of 3 & quot ; to 8.5 & quot ; and height of 5 & quot ; to 14 & quot ; , which means they are all short by 1/8th inch in height .	St
1.6.4	Why the hell a manufacturer would n't make a printer that accepts A1 flat card size is beyond me .	St
1.6.5	Since it is a standard and not much of a difference .	St
1.6.6	Geez .	St
1.6.7	Thanks for the info on the fladbed printers , but I am not paying $ 10K for a printer .	St
1.6.8	SO the question is still there : Does ANYONE know of a laser printer that can print on an A1 flat card ( 3 1/2 & quot ; x 4 7/8 & quot ; ) size piece of coverstock ( 80 lbs or 216 gsm ) ?	Ques
1.6.9	?	Ques
1.7.1	And let 's be honest .	St
1.7.2	We have for years exceeded the specs on paper weight on many printers .	St
1.7.3	Sure the warranty is not going to be honored but you smile as you put your 120lb stock through the straight path and it works .	St
1.7.4	It 's possible that that printer will work with the 1/8 inch shy stock but are you running into folk that DEMAND it be in the specs and not go with what may work ?	Ques
1.7.5	And yes , this is why we had a sheer in the print shop .	St
1.7.6	Print it on a stock size then cut to size .	St
1.7.7	It 's been an amazing journey as I see folk that wonder how we got edge to edge printing on such stock .	St
1.7.8	We never did .	St
1.7.9	We printed then put it in the sheer cutter .	St
1.7.10	Bob	St
1.8.1	You need to visit the vendor websites and check the specs .	St
1.8.2	I suspect you went to the common ones , but overall if you want cheap or basic home office , once you get out of the norm , they wo n't carry it .	St
1.8.3	This is where I suggest you find commercial application laser that will be more expensive but they do the job .	St
1.8.4	I don ; t know the final costs but going to local Staples , or Best Buy , etc. , are n't always helpful for specifics at times .	St
1.8.5	You can check with a local business and see what they offer like business copy and printer sellers .	Sug
1.8.6	At least they have catalogs or sales people that could help .	St
1.8.7	Konica , Canon , Ricoh and Sharp are big suppliers for business , so do n't be surprised no HP or Dell or common brands .	St
1.8.8	You can check out & quot ; refurbed units & quot ; to help reduce costs or commercial trade papers or online sources .	St
1.8.9	Also , I 'm sure what you want should be in & quot ; flat stock & quot ; path printing too , heavy media does n't bend well plus is a demanding media to print on .	St
1.8.10	Any cheap laser may print OK but movement of media maybe a problem over time .	Sug
