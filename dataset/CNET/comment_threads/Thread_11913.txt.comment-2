Is this your motherboard: MSI K8N Neo3-F ?
If so, there are two problematic areas noted in RED.
RED ITEM ONE: What is the voltage rating on the memory module (MSI says 2.5V is compatible)?
What voltage setting does the BIOS have for the memory?
RED ITEM TWO: Although the MSI compatibility list for the AGR slot is probably incomplete, the Sapphire 9600 Pro is not on the list of tested compatible cards.
If you can, I would consider returning that board for one that is known to support your card or has a standard AGP slot.
Maybe get a motherboard that has less issues in general.
