especially look at half-running roaring processor fan.
Looking inside at boot may ID where the roar is from, other than the neighbor's Ford.
Is it the CDrom drive?
Is it the power supply fan?
It was overclocked as running at the higher temperature, normal temp=normal speed; heat up makes the mobo underclock the CPU.
