what happens in my case is i can take around 100 pictures, put the card in the reader and it may take 10 minutes or so for them to all open so i can start editing them.
then once i do the editing and click save, it may take 20 to 30 sec before i can save each picture into a folder which takes another 20 to 30 sec.
i don't count the time it takes for editing as i shoot in raw and i know that takes a little longer to process the pictures.
you gave me advise awhile back about the 3 gig switch which did help, but as i am doing more of this now i would like to get it done faster if possible.
thanks again.
