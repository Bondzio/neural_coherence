having the mtrbd.
connected to psu will provide a load and basically that's it.
depending on the mtrbd.
with speaker attached, it can beep away in protest or not.
if cpu attached with speaker it should beep to some error code.
you're not really testing the mtrbd.
in any meaningful way, so i leave it at that.
oh yeah, if you have access to those &quot;diagnostic slot card&quot;, i find those of no use, especially if the mtrbd.
itself is at fault.
as for display, you still need to attach or activate the video port.
a bad mtrbd.
can cause no display as it drags the video port down but again it could be the video itself, so having a problem requires some effort to resolve.
it boils down to the time and effort to fix a mtrbd., you can buy another one, so how much is your time worth?
