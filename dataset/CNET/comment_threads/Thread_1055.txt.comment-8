Can you draw a diagram that shows the layout of your LAN.
Just a simple lan diagram.
Use mspaint to draw it in.
What's the square footage of your house?
Is it a single or two floors?
How many walls between the router and the farthest wireless you will be using?
Do a second diagram with floor plan so I have a good understanding of your layout.
Just a quick drawing, nothing fancy.
Email it to me at philbernie@yahoo.com.
I would love to help you out.
