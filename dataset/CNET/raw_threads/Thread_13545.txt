If I were you I would contact the ISP and ask what pppoe modem he recommends to use in stead of the current setup. Then connect a wireless router (or - even easier - use a modem/router combined) to communicate wirelessly with both laptops. Kees

I would recommend you do this with the windows 7 laptop as it will be able to keep up with the XP laptop but not the other way around. Next you attach the XP laptop to the win 7 laptop, the wireless router should automatically discover and configure the connection for you and you should not have to do anything.
