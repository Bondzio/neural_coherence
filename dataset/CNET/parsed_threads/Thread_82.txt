<s> I have both a Dell laptop and a Dell desktop, both running Windows XP Professional. </s>
<s> I recently purchased a 250GB external hard drive which I would like to use for backing up BOTH computers. </s>
<s> They would NOT be connected to the external drive at the same time (I know that's a no-no), but I would swap the drive between the computers as needed. </s>
<s> I would certainly think this would be possible if the drive was not partitioned (or technically speaking had only the 1 partition), but could I create TWO partitions, one for backing up the laptop and the other partition for backing up the desktop? </s>
<s> If the partitioning were performed, say, using the desktop would Windows on the laptop recognize the partitions, thus allowing the laptop to back up to its dedicated partition? </s>
<s> I thought this type of question would come up fairly frequently, but I have not found this question addressed anywhere yet on this forum (judging by the titles anyway), nor anywhere yet on the Internet for that matter. </s>
<s> I would appreciate any help. </s>
<s> I found many discussions about using Acronis to do this. </s>
<s> But the 2 partitions seems to defeat getting the most space from said drive. </s>
<s> Your choice here. </s>

<s> As long as it is an external drive and is partitioned and formatted correctly I dont think it would care if you hooked up to a million different computers one after another because it would behave like any other usb device. </s>
<s> drivers would load, and as long as windows could read the partition off you go. </s>
<s> Unless that drive has a write protect switch and you have more than one drive like it, it fails basic tests for backups. </s>
<s> Let's say your machines fall prey to http://www.theregister.com/2006/09/21/ie_exploit/ and you think you'll hook up your restore drive. </s>
<s> What stops the pests installed by this exploit from damaging the backup copy? </s>

<s> Someone may have posted a question similar to mine, but as I said in my post, I could not tell by the Subject Title (Well, perhaps one post was close, but nobody provided any answers). </s>
<s> Perhaps if I open tons of posts I will come across a similar thread. </s>
<s> Do you know of any particular threads I could review? </s>
<s> Meanwhile, I will keep an eye out for references to Acronis and open those up. </s>
<s> As to your second comment, I'm only using two partitions because for now I only want to be able to clone each computer's hard drive contents into their own partition. </s>
<s> (BTW, the two computers are not set up to mirror each other and are not otherwised synched in any way, as they each have completely different file contents). </s>
<s> Thank you for responding. </s>
<s> Thanks Compuser78 for your response. </s>
<s> Yeah I get that the number of computers that should be able to recognize my external drive is really not the issue, as long as it was partitioned and formatted correctly. </s>
<s> But then you finish off with &quot;and as long as windows could read the partition off you go&quot;. </s>
<s> Well, that's the heart of my question, which your response didn't answer! </s>
<s> Once I correctly create 2 partitions and correctly format each of them using one computer running Windows XP Professional, will another computer running Windows XP Professional (bug-free) &quot;recognize&quot; in the typical plug and play fashion the same partitions (and formats) once I swap the drive over to that computer? </s>
<s> The clone is a file created by Acronis. </s>
<s> If I partitioned the drive I would limit my options. </s>
<s> Your choice here. </s>
<s> As to the discussions I thought you said you didn't find any. </s>
<s> My mistake. </s>

<s> I have a Maxtor DiamondMax 80 Gig drive in an external USB-2 case. </s>
<s> I move it all the time between all four PCs. </s>
<s> I have a folder for each PC set up on the drive and just drag and drop things I can't afford to loose like pictures and stuff to their respective folder. </s>
<s> Too easy. </s>
<s> I've never found any backup program without glitches or that wasn't a PITA to use. </s>
<s> Every few months I take those folders and burn them to DVD. </s>
