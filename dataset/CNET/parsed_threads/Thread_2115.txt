<s> Have an adaptec USB hard drive enclosure. </s>
<s> I got it hoping that I could use it rescue data on some drives, or just as an external drive as well. </s>
<s> I've read through a bunch of the forum posts where they say you need to prepare a drive to be used in such a situation. </s>
<s> The drives I'm hoping to use are already formatted, one of them is dynamic NTFS. </s>
<s> It seems to boot up and is spinning but my XP Pro system doesn't see it. </s>
<s> Would appreciate any assistance as I really need to get the data off this healthy drive. </s>
<s> Before you proceed remember all formatting and configuring of a disk can delete data, be causes here. </s>
<s> First, right click MyComputer&gt; go too properties&gt; too Hardware&gt; Device manager&gt; right click computer&gt; choose....Scan for hardware changes. </s>
<s> Let the program run. </s>
<s> Did this fix the problem? </s>
<s> Second, how did the driver installation go? </s>
<s> Any problems? </s>
<s> If you did have problems reinstall the driver but first do a defragmentation and a disk check to make sure everything is running OK. </s>
<s> If your still having problems you may have to reformat the drive. </s>
<s> You'll need someone else's assistance to do this I have no experience with dynamic disks. </s>
<s> Be patient your system hasn't crashed. </s>
<s> Choose a reliable source, someone who appears to be experienced with what your intending to do. </s>
<s> You'll need to give this some thought before you proceed once the formatting and configuration of the disk is done you'll be stuck with it. </s>
<s> Almost all configuring of the disk removes all data from it. </s>
<s> Think long term about what your going to do. </s>
<s> One areas you might want to read up on is a stripped disk. </s>
<s> Stripped disks can be made in Dynamic disks and have some speed advantages over FAT and NTFS configurations. </s>
<s> This information can be found in start&gt; Settings&gt; Control Panel&gt; Administrative Tools&gt; in the HELP file. </s>
<s> Good Luck </s>

<s> Some more info.. http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_04.asp </s>
<s> This is the problem now... tried several of the suggestions, but even though the drive seems active, I do not see it in Disk Management. </s>
<s> So I can't really use any recovery software. </s>
<s> I haven't loaded any drivers for the Adaptec as the drivers supplied specify its only for Win98, and the Adaptec site doesn't seem to offer anything else. </s>
<s> Is it possible that this could be a WinXP Pro vs Home thing? </s>
<s> I'm not sure how the disk got formatted as dynamic instead of basic, but could this be why? </s>
<s> These tools do not require the drive to show in disk management so I wonder if you didn't try them. </s>
<s> If they don't find the drive then you move on to other hardware issues such as broken external cases (try a new one), etc. </s>
