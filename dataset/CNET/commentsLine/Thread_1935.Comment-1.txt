hello, i have just recently purchased a new samsung laptop.
the laptop has the intel advanced n 6235 chip inside of it.
when i set up the laptop i was at a friends house and it connected to their router perfectly fine.
now that i am home i cannot connect to my wireless router at all.
i have tried restarting the laptop and the router and tried everything i could find online.
the router was the basic router supplied by verizon when we got fios.
the laptop does work when the ethernet cable is connected directly from the laptop to the router but the second it is removed the wireless stops working right away.
any help would be greatly appreciated.
thank you.
