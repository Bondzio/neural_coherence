<s> SO I have a 16gm sandisk jump drive, it has maybe 3 gbs on it. </s>
<s> I tried saving a picture off my face book to it and it says that the disc is full. </s>
<s> I had 12 gbs of music on it - and pulled that off, onto an external, restarted the system so now its back down to only 3 gbs of pictures on the drive, but i'm still getting the error, The folder I'm saving it into has 38,xxx files on it, could that be the issue? </s>
<s> Oh and using windows 7, same issue on firefox and chrome, I can open word and save a doc into the folder as well no issues </s>
<s> You can see this happen if all the files are in the top folder. </s>
<s> Solution? </s>
<s> Use a folder. </s>

<s> I can't even create a new sub folder i get error 0x80070052, The folder structure is that i have the jump drive, then the folder &quot;pictures&quot; then my jpg files, I can create another folder on the main directory but not in the sub folder. </s>
<s> Can the folder itself become &quot;full&quot;? </s>
<s> the other oddity is that I can pull the folder off the jump drive and save it onto my external(click and drag) and then still save files to it. </s>
<s> And because the long file names can take up multiple entries, there is no set number I can give you on what the top folder can hold. </s>
<s> Try to keep it low to under 100. </s>
<s> And before you do anything else. </s>
<s> Back up this stick so you can start fresh. </s>

<s> Since most flash drives come in FAT32 format, some glitches apply. </s>
<s> How big is the file being tried to save? </s>
<s> Even, if the file is smaller than 4Gb, it may allocate a larger size in order to fulfill the final total of needs. </s>
<s> Save, all your data and try this. </s>
<s> once that is done, reformat the flash drive to NTFS format and that should help greatly handle large files or data transfers to storage. </s>
<s> I found even 3gb+ sizes can cause problems. </s>
<s> tada ------Willy </s>
<s> Things you can do/try: - Copy the existing pictures off to your hard disk, delete them on the USB-stick, chkdsk it, then make some subfolders and copy the files back to them. </s>
<s> Try to keep each subfolder less than 5000 pictures. </s>
<s> - Don't save from your browser to the jump drive. </s>
<s> First save to a temp folder on your hard disk. </s>
<s> Then copy to the jump drive using your favorite file manager (like Windows Explorer) Probably one of these alternatives is enough to solve your issue. </s>
<s> But it won't harm at all to do both. </s>
