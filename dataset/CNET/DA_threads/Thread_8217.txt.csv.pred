1.1.1	Western Digital SATA Hard Drive - 640GB Vista Home Premium - 64Bit Gateway desktop.	St
1.1.2	Would someone know of any utility or method to restore a SATA hard drive's factory full capacity size?	Ques
1.1.3	During partitioning my drive, it went from 595GB (640GB Drive) to only 32GB.	St
1.1.4	Since it is a 64-Bit system, I can't find a utility to restore the drive's full capacity.	St
1.2.1	The last time I did this I used the Vista's installer.	St
1.2.2	Worked fine.	St
1.3.1	My goal is to recover the original factory's hard drive's capacity size of 595GB and not the current 32GB.	St
1.4.1	Does the Extend Volume option work: http://www.vistarewired.com/2007/02/16/how-to-resize-a-partition-in-windows-vista Kees	St
1.5.1	And AFTER A BACKUP!!!	St
1.5.2	Look up GPARTED.	St
1.5.3	Again something odd is going on here.	St
1.5.4	Was there some other than Vista tool used?	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	Okay, KUDOs to you TheDraac.	St
1.7.2	I got the drive fixed.	St
1.7.3	First I must have messed up the drive by using the Western Digital Lifeguard Tool on their own drive - ironic.	St
1.7.4	Using the Lifeguard Utility, I did what I had to and checked the BAs.	St
1.7.5	My Native MAX LBA did not match my Current MAX LBA, and I did not know how to change it.	St
1.7.6	I set, in the BIOS, the drive to LBA and the system got up to 137GB.	St
1.7.7	Then I ran the Acronis WD (Western Digital) Edition (free) to check the integrity of the drive.	St
1.7.8	It showed me the following partitions: 32GB, 137Gb and UNUSED 144GB.	St
1.7.9	I opened my Easeus Partition Master to check the drive and found all the full size - it gave me more than the factory, it gave me 610GB instead of the 595GB for a 640GB drive.	St
1.7.10	Am so excited!	St
1.7.11	Thanks for all your help here, I really appreciate all your help and time.	Polite
1.7.12	You ALL have a wonderful weekend.	Polite
