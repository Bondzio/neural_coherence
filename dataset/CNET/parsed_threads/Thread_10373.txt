<s> I have 6 desktop pcs and a laptop all networked together using an 8 port hub. </s>
<s> a broad band cable is also connected in the uplink port of the hub. </s>
<s> My problem is two of the desktop pcs though visible when searcing are not accessible by other pcs. </s>
<s> though sharing is enabled and also file and print sharing is also enabled. </s>
<s> I am using windows xp professional on all pcs. </s>
<s> All are p4 </s>
<s> While you could buy more IP addresses from the ISP, this will not be acceptable since the sharing would be visible to the internet. </s>
