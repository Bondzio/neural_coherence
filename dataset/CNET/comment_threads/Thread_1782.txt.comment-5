I think that a MacBook would do the trick for you.
The MacBook Pro is a wonderful machine as well.
I am recommending the MacBook because it is smaller, lighter and less expensive.
It will do everything that you want.
You should not need the more robust video processor in the Pro unless you get involved in heavy duty photo and video editing.
For the purposes you describe, the only disadvantage of the MacBook, compared to the MacBook Pro, is the 13.3 inch screen.
The smaller screen is what makes the laptop smaller and lighter.
If you can get to a store that carries the MacBook (Apple Store or Best Buy, for example), you can check out the MacBook and make sure that you like the screen size.
My college student daughter loves her MacBook.
