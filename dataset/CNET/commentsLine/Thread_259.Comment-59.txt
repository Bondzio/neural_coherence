i came up saying there was new hardware, but it never asked for drivers.
i repeated the steps, deleting the drives and drivers and it all happened again.
the first drive saw the dell cd, but never opened it.
i put a prerecorded audio cd in it and it played, using windows media experience, but i put in a pre-recorded dvd in it and it did not play.
about the same thing happened with the other drive.
ted, you've been so helpful and i'm sorry to say this, but i'm going to have to go to bed.
i'm so tired.
when will you be here again?
i've reached the point where i can no longer deal with this.
before last night, i spent 18 hours straight with the dell people plus my day job and i think if i worked any more, i'd do more damage than good.
will you be available sunday?
i'll wait for your reply.
ann
