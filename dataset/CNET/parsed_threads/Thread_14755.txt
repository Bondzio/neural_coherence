<s> I don't want to spend too much money ($1000 limit). </s>
<s> I configured one on newegg with Socket 939 and it came to about $900. </s>
<s> I configured another with Socket AM2 for about $1000. </s>
<s> Is it worth $100 more to go with AM2? </s>
<s> I heard it's only 1% faster. </s>

<s> DDR2 RAM will run a tad bit faster than DDR, but it's not enough to really notice a difference. </s>
<s> And it's only if you get DDR2 that's running at a high enough frequency, at that. </s>
<s> Really, AM2 is just a backstop until K8L comes out in about 2 years. </s>
<s> AM2 processors are going to use less power, so if that's something you're concerned about, go with the AM2 system. </s>
<s> Otherwise, honestly, it's really not going to matter too much. </s>
