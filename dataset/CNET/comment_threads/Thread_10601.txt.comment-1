i have a gateway sx2802-03 with a nvidia gt610 installed.
the PSU is 220w but the graphics card says it needs a minimum of 300w.
ive been using it for a few months now with the 220w.
I wanted to know if running it underpower was alright and if i upgraded the psu to a 400w or so if that would improve my GPU preformance.
here is a link to the PSU from what i found
