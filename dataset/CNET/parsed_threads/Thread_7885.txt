<s> I have read about two monitors with 1 PC, and am trying to figure out if I can use one PC with two or more people simoltaneously on it. </s>
<s> I have seen splitters that do just this, but would like to know if there is any easier way to do this with what I have or without some big-expensive hardware. </s>
<s> I have intel extreme graphics chip, and a Radeon 9250 PCI. </s>
<s> I have enough ports for 2 keyboard and 2 mice. </s>
<s> I am using Windows XP Home edition and have Intel Celeron processor and 1 GB of RAM. </s>

<s> This may sound like old technology but... </s>
<s> I have used that same application to do that exact thing. </s>
<s> I put one main power house computer (X-Windows enabled server) in the middle of my house and wired &quot;dumb clients&quot; (keyboard monitor and mouse) to that main computer and each &quot;work station&quot; has its own session of X-Windows on it independant of the other workstations or the server. </s>
<s> Microsoft does not support this option - If they did they would not sell as many licenses God forbid they turn down money... </s>
<s> There is a way to make windows server 2000/2003 do this however it takes special hardware (i.e. </s>
<s> Citrix Thin Clients) which end up costing as much as a new PC, so for a home user this is not ideal (unless ur a hard core geek and have money to throw away). </s>
<s> If you dont want to spend more money and you dont mind switching to a differant OS then Redhat, Slackware, Suse all support this option out of the box, however Linspire, which is significantly cheaper, will support this option with a little bit of tweaking but Linspire's support will tell you its not possible (but it is cause i have done it). </s>
<s> Hope this helps.... </s>
<s> There used to be (don't know if there still is) something called &quot;Buddy&quot; system. </s>
<s> It allowed two users to simultaneously use 1 PC at the same time. </s>
