3265	0	186430	2027898	NR	Bigdoll01	6/25/06 10:02 AM	1.15122972E12	Chip Clock Speed	Comparing a @GB Intel Duo Processor T2500 running at 533MHz vs. one running at 667MHz--is there any discernable or significant advantage to the much-more-expensive 667 chip?

Chipset: VIA 83C3189 rev 128. As I understand then my computer is not even running on half the speed the processor can handle. There must be a catch. Is there anybody out there to fill me in? I would very much appreciate. cleirens@freegates.be, thank you.
