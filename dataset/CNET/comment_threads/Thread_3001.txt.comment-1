I am looking to buy or maybe build a new gaming computer, and have no idea where to start.
I realize that with building a computer, I will save some money, but I have no experience in computer building and am not sure that I have the time.
I would really like not spend more than $1400-$1500, while still being able to play most new games.
Any suggestions for a prebuilt computer or computer building specs?
Thanks, Shlomo
