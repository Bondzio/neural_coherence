Are there any good software programs/utilities that can recoved a deleted partition? I'm not looking for just a freeware utiility. I'm willing to spend the money and purchase a program just as long as it works. Thanks! Bluehorse_58

Anyway if something goes wrong (e.g.Disk Director won't recover ur deleted partition) u can get ur money back within 30 days. http://www.acronis.com/homecomputing/products/diskdirector/ good luck be sure to tell us about results
