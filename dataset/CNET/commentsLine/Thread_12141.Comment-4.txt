in addition to the above comments, note in your previous post asking about the sempron, that the options for that amd sempron processor computer in the discussion, did not list a amd athlon 64 processor, but the amd athlon xp processor.
i had suggested you select the amd athlon xp 3200 processor.
an amd athlon 64 would not be offered in a low cost computer system.
the xp3200 is plenty powerful and will be around for some time.
back in may 2003 amd claimed it was the fastest desktop processor available on the retail market(at that time).
i would think it would be well worth the $30 over the sempron in that option.
