in laptops we never get to upgrade that so i have learned to get the faster cpu every time.
i can put off the hard disk and ram till my wallet recovers.
try finding video on vmfusion as well.
i can assure you there will be a new widescreen pro.
any ccfl backlit display is bound to be changed to led.
no one knows exactly when.
for the 15 inch &quot;256mb of gddr3 sdram on 2.4ghz and 2.6ghz configurations&quot; another bonus.
