I have the same problem, but I am a gamer.
I don't know what that has to do with it, but Can you help me?
How do you uninstall without messing up your video card all together and then reinstall, I also have radeon 9550.
If it is not that much trouble could you write to my email account, I have a bad memory when it comes to where I get info, so I might not remember this site, My email is mattthemyth@live.com
