1.1.1	Hey, I'm planning to build a new computer.	St
1.1.2	I have a budget of $1500.	St
1.1.3	I just need some advise on what to put in it, especially the motherboard, I know nothing about motherboards.	St
1.1.4	I was thinking to put in: Thermaltake III Xaser CASE Aopen AX4SPE MOTHERBOARD Intel Celeron 3.06 Ghz w/HP PROCESSOR twinx1024 3200LL MEMORY Maxtor 250 GB - 7200 RPM HARDDRIVE ATI Radeon 9800 XT 128mb GRAPHICS CARD Creative Labs Audigy 2-Platinum SOUND CAR DVD-RW/CD-RW combo + DVD-ROM DRIVE that comes up to about 1450 buxx.	St
1.1.5	i can go over my budget by about 100-200 dollars maximum.	St
1.1.6	If you think i should replace any of these parts just tell me.	Sug
1.1.7	or if you know a better motherboard.	St
1.1.8	Im also interested in a dual-processor motherboard but i havent been ableto find enough info.	St
1.1.9	all advice is welcome, thank you	Polite
1.2.1	I wouldn't do this.	St
1.2.2	This year may see the 64-bit changeover and if you sink too much into this machine, you may get a little upset over the 64-bit new machines.	St
1.2.3	Why not just get some few hundred dollar nice machine and wait it out?	Sug
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	i would wait if i could, but my budget has a time limit.	Ques
1.3.2	i had sort of a grant that has to be used for that purpose within this time, or else i would so what u suggested, thanks though	St
1.4.1	Then go 64-bit now.	Sug
1.4.2	http://reviews-zdnet.cbsi.com/4520-3000-5079609.html notes a few suppliers and at 1,500 USD http://www.polywell.com/us/onlinestore/poly900VF1.asp starts at under 999.	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	yeah, thats a good idea, i think ill do just that.	St
1.5.2	So basically the only change i need to make is an AMD Athlon 64bit (of course) processer and a motherboard to go with it?	St
1.5.3	all the rest can stay, right?	St
1.5.4	thanks max	Polite

1.6.3	all the rest can stay, right?	St
1.6.4	thanks oh and the second link, i have to build my own, as in get the parts and throw the things together, not get it custom made by sum other company, thanks though max	Polite
1.7.1	When you build it yourself, there are risks.	St
1.7.2	New builders often do odd things like bolt the motherboard to the case without the standoffs and then take a grinder to the case to make the cards fit.	St
1.7.3	Even seasoned builders will often pick an undersized power supply and the machine will not boot or will develop problems shortly.	St
1.7.4	Are you really ready for all this?	St
1.7.5	Are you willing to replace a bum blown board or two?	St
1.7.6	It happens... Bob	St
1.8.1	I have a couple of friends and connections close to where i live that could give me a hand if i dropped them an email.	St
1.8.2	i understand the risk of making a small mistake and frying anything on it.	St
1.8.3	another question, ok so i use a 64bit AMD, right?	St
1.8.4	can i get 2 and put them on a nice dual processor motherboard?	St
1.8.5	do u kno a place where i CAN get a dual processor motherboard?	Ques
1.9.1	&quot;Today&quot; in Intel-land, that's the XEON, Itanium or you have to move back in time to the P3.	St
1.9.2	The P4 is not dual-cpu capable.	St
1.9.3	&quot;Today&quot; in AMD-land the duals are the Athlon-MP series.	St
1.9.4	I've seen a few, but remember that you often see them fitted with 600+ Watt power supplies and cooling systems that are often too noisy to be in an office space.	St
1.9.5	While I still have my old dual Pentium Pro with Overdrive's, it was a lot more money than a faster CPU of next year.	St
1.9.6	In fact, I could have a single faster CPU that year and bought a new machine the following year at twice the speed with the same money.	St
1.9.7	Bob	St
1.10.1	I have a couple of friends and connections close to where i live that could give me a hand if i dropped them an email.	St
1.10.2	i understand the risk of making a small mistake and frying anything on it.	St
1.10.3	another question, ok so i use a 64bit AMD, right?	St
1.10.4	can i get 2 and put them on a nice dual processor motherboard?	St
1.10.5	do u kno a place where i CAN get a dual processor motherboard?	Ques
