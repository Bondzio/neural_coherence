there are two problems with purchasing the pc you are referring to.
first, the 256 megs of ram will, in time, prove to be inadequate.
that i can promise.
even if you only watch movies on hulu, you will need more.
the second problem is that when graphics cards are built into the motherboard, many manufacturers do not include a graphics card slot on the board.
new motherboards have limited slots to start with, and unless there is a graphics slot also installed on the board, should the graphics card go bad at a later date, you will have a real problem finding a replacement that give any performance in the slots available.
additionally, should you add any internal cards, you will find you have to give up something, perhaps something important to you, to free up a slot at all.
look for a pc that has a separate graphics card, and if you budget will allow it, look for one with at least 512 megs of video memory.
when the system runs out of dedicated video memory and starts sharing your ram memory, everything slows down.
good luck!
