Many laptops will not even power up unless the battery is in, even if you have the AC adapter plugged in. I leave my battery in ALL the time. John

The computer autosenses that there is AC power. Furthermore, it is advantageous to keep the battery connected while using AC power because the notebook can run and charge its battery at the same time. Dell Notebook Battery Center FAQ
