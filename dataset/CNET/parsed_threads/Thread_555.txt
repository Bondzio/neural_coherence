<s> I mistakenly removed the 128 DDR RAM Module from the Mercury PVCLE266M-L v3.0A Motherboard of my System Unit while power was still turned on. </s>
<s> On switching off and replacing the Memory Module, and turning on my PC, it continously makes three intermediate beeps and will not come up. </s>
<s> Please what can I do? </s>
<s> Now I need help. </s>
<s> power on self tests will exit with beeps in patterns that are s'posed to tell you what's failed. </s>
<s> I'm guessing the 3 beep code on your mobo has something to do with fried RAM. </s>
<s> Check your manual to find out for sure. </s>
<s> (if you can't find the manual look for it at mercury-pc.com) If it is bad RAM, then figure out which is the bad stick(s) and don't use it/them. </s>
<s> Your system is hosed. </s>
<s> if you have good ram available NOT the old one. </s>
<s> Install it and see what happens. </s>
<s> The risk is yours. </s>
<s> If it were me. </s>
<s> I won't trust this system to be reliable any more, though you can be lucky. </s>
<s> BEWARE - Good ram may fail, if the same ram slot is used and fry every ram stick you install. </s>
<s> Also possible the mtrbd. </s>
<s> has taken a hit. </s>
<s> Usually 3-beeps suggest some ram problem, but investigate your model# mtrbd. </s>
<s> and see what the &quot;beep code&quot; refers to. </s>
<s> Beeps can be long and short, so note the beep sequence. </s>
<s> If you wanted a reason to &quot;upgrade&quot; here you go. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> http://www.ami.com/support/doc/AMIBIOS8_Checkpoint_and_Beep_Code_List_PUB.pdf Be sure you have Abode reader to review this. </s>
<s> I already did a quick glance and 3 beeps is ram related, go figure. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> I usually support the idea of keeping ol' systems running if they're getting the tasks done that you need. </s>
<s> On this one, just a heads-up -- the DDR ram is not going to work for your next computer, as we're transitioning from DDR2 to DDR3. </s>
<s> So if you have to buy RAM to replace the fried stick(s), that investment won't carry on to your next computers in the future. </s>
