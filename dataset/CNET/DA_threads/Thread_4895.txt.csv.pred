1.1.1	May be an odd question ( or may be not ) .	St
1.1.2	Just added a breakout box to my computer .	St
1.1.3	Headphone , Microphone , and 2 USB plugs work fine .	St
1.1.4	My problem is the firewire plug .	St
1.1.5	The cable for it has connections for a header ( as did the others ) .	St
1.1.6	My Firewire card 's internal connection is a plug .	St
1.1.7	Now to my question .	St
1.1.8	Are there firewire plugs available ?	Ques
1.1.9	The other choice would be to buy a firewire cable and cut the end off and graft it .	St
1.1.10	This is also a problem .	St
1.1.11	The header connections are labeled , but I have no way to match those to the plug wires .	St
1.1.12	If anyone can point me to a source for a 1394 plug and/or a means of identification of wires I would greatly appreciate it .	St
1.1.13	chuck	St
1.2.1	You need to give us exact brand name and model numbers of what you want to connect , too many possibilities .	St
1.3.1	Actually , Jeff , I did give the pertinent info , with the exception of specifying it as 1394a .	St
1.3.2	Finding a male plug end is n't a good idea online .	St
1.3.3	Shipping would make it more expensive than it needs to be .	St
1.3.4	Finding the cheapest cable locally and cutting the plug off and splicing the wires seems the best bet .	St
1.3.5	I 've found more info than I 'll ever need , except the simplest question .	St
1.3.6	Are all 6-pin 1394a exactly the same except for length ?	Ques
1.3.7	If I cut into any given cable , am I going to find the same color wires going to the same contacts as any other plug on any other cable .	St
1.3.8	Since they adopted the 1394a-2000 protocol , you could assume this is the case .	St
1.3.9	But assumptions can kill equipment .	St
1.3.10	Different wire makers could figure internal structure would n't matter as long as the cable worked .	St
1.3.11	I did hours of research and never found this issue addressed or diagramed .	St
1.3.12	chuck	St
1.4.1	In short .	St
1.4.2	No .	St
1.4.3	To drive the cost to the lowest levels , I can only guess what color wires you find inside may as well be all grey .	St
1.4.4	Answer ?	Ques
1.4.5	Use an ohm meter to ring it out .	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	Thanks , Bob .	St
1.5.2	Thats what I was leery about .	St
1.5.3	One vender had a break-down of their cables , showing the same colors , that was the best I could find .	St
1.5.4	I 'll be very , very careful .	Polite
