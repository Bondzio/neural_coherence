1.1.1	I have a small wired network in my company, containing about ten computers, servers, etc.	St
1.1.2	and would like to add wireless capability for a computer that needs to be placed in the warehouse.	St
1.1.3	Currently my network is set up with static IP's and do not want to change this, is it possible to set up a wireless network where DHCP is only enabled for the computer accessing through the wireless conection?	St
1.1.4	Also what hardware is required, is it a wireless access point?	St
1.1.5	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	DHCP does not dictate that all machines be set to DHCP.	St
1.2.2	And a WAP is what you can add to get it done.	St
1.2.3	However a WAP is just about the same price as a WIFI router, so replacing your router may be a great idea.	St
1.2.4	But then again you can move the WAP closer to the warehouse.	St
