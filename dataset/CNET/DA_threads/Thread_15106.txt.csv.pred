1.8.1	If you have the installation/restore disk to reinstall Nero , I would try uninstalling Nero completely , restart computer , and then reinstall Nero .	St
1.8.2	Add the Nero update after reinstall , too .	St
1.8.3	See if this works .	St
1.8.4	If yo have a registered copy of Nero , copy its Serial Number before you remove Nero from the computer .	St
1.8.5	This will allow you to re-enter the Serial Number after reinstallation .	St
