<s> I have an ASUS P5VD1-X motherboard Rev 1.xx Bus Clock: 200 megahertz BIOS: American Megatrends Inc. 080012 12/06/2005 I would like to add another hard drive or two. </s>
<s> I already have 2 hard drives, a dvd burner, and a cd burner installed, thus using up all the ide channels on the board. </s>
<s> I don't want to buy a PCI slot ide controller in order to add more drives unless I have to. </s>
<s> So I am wondering if I can make use of the SATA controllers on the board at the same time as the ide primary and secondary channels. </s>
<s> Not a problem. </s>
<s> SATA doesn't get BIOS from CMOS so you might have to load a driver though. </s>
<s> Do you have a sufficient power supply? </s>
<s> I have a 430W PSU, Nvidia 6200 AGP graphics card, which doesn't require a separate power cord from the psu, DVD burner, CD burner, soundblaster live sound card, 80 gb maxtor HD and a 20 gb maxtor HD installed. </s>
<s> I would think the PSU could handle another drive but I don't know anything about the power requirements of a SATA drive verses an ide drive. </s>
