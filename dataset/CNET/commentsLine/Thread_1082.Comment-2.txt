my guess would be the asus disk would be what is called a &quot;boot &quot; disk and what the store created were the os disks.
you would use these for system failures and only then.
the store disks (usually 2 or 3 dvd's) would/should contain the total operating system and would restore the system back to &quot;as new&quot; .
the boot disk would be used if the system failed to boot and would/could recover the system from within the system (os).
only use these if you need to, store them in a safe location as a just in case.
