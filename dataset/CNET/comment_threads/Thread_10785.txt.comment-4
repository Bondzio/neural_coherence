A HP d5000t desktop that was 399 bucks.
To kick up the graphics I went with the 1GB Nvidia GT240 since I didn't have to upgrade the power supply.
That card was on sale for 99 bucks.
Added Windows 7 from the 3 license pack for Home and I came in with a very nice machine for 569 bucks.
It's still running fine.
