3187	0	6398	74865	NR	Unknown	12/21/03 8:42 AM	1.07199612E12	Looks like we're stuck in safe mode...	For a couple of days now our monitor resolution and color looks like safe mode and we can't change it. In Settings, Control Panel, Display, Settings we have 2 choices... 16 color or 2 color. Shouldn't there be more? I don't know what we had to begin with. We did some &quot;clean up&quot; of old programs from Control Panel, Add/Remove Programs... maybe we dumped something by accident that caused this? We're have an HP Pavilion with Win 98. Any help is appreciated!
