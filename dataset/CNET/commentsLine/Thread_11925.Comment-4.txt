i store large numbers of raw photo files as well as high resolution audio and video files (multi-gb) so the typical cloud solutions are either too slow or too expensive for the size of files i am shuffling around.
maybe dvds are on the way out for the common users.
i am rather confident they will stay around for some time for those in my situation -- and there are quite a few of us.
its either dvds or raid storage and the continual replacement of raid drives makes that a less than ideal solution.
the m-disc solution seems to get around the finite nature of hd (regardless of whether it is solid state or rotational) life.
given the physics of what milllenniata is doing -- and while i'm not a physics prof, what they are doing is physically possible -- their solution has distinct possibilities.
so has any one used m-discs and what has been your experience with them?
