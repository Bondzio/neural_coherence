<s> Hey guys, I have searched around all over the net for a solution. </s>
<s> I am trying to network my small office. </s>
<s> We have 3 computers all on our wifi network. </s>
<s> We do not have any file sharing setup. </s>
<s> I would rather shy away from doing a partition on one of the computers and sharing that space. </s>
<s> I would rather just buy a external hard drive with large capacity to do a full backup of each computer through the shared drive. </s>
<s> I have seen certain products like the Buffalo or Linksys router that you hook up the external hard drive too, but then the user reviews are usually pretty bad. </s>
<s> Wondering what is cost effective, THAT WORKS, and has high speed capability for the backing up of the computers to the hard drive. </s>
<s> Ideally I would like the end result to be that on each computer the shared drive shows up just like the &quot;C:&quot; drive when you click on my computer. </s>
<s> Thank you very much for any help or advice. </s>
<s> Today the complaints are all about speed and ease of use. </s>
<s> Today there is no product that does this well. </s>
<s> To really hear the complaints, stick ANY network storage on WIFI and even with the ear plugs in the screams are easily heard. </s>

<s> I have a nice little NAS. </s>
<s> It's connected to my router and contains a 450 Gig SATA drive. </s>
<s> It's accessible from all my wired and wireless PCs and has worked flawlessly. </s>
<s> And the NAS has a little button that makes backups. </s>
<s> Opening Explorer in each PC shows the NAS as another hard drive. </s>
<s> I am trying to do something similar, but mine is for my house. </s>
<s> I currently have 3 computers on line (network) and will be adding 2 more. </s>
<s> I am using a Belkin N+ wireless router. </s>
<s> This allows me to plug via USB 2.0 into the router and the storage devise is linked into the other computers. </s>
<s> I am currentlyn using windows vista 64bit as the main computer and have been having trouble finding an external NAS hard drive. </s>
<s> As recently as today though I believe I have found the Cavalry # CAND3002TO 1Tb External hard drive NAS which is compatable. </s>
<s> I called Cavalry today and they said it is. </s>
<s> BUY.COM has it on sale for 262.99 w/ free S/h. </s>
<s> Best price I found. </s>
<s> I am a novice at all this also, but I do my research. </s>
<s> I have networked my house on my own and I am very pleased with the Belkin N+. </s>
<s> I might add that my home is 4 stories with the router located on the third with no probs. </s>
<s> Let me know if you think its good for u or you see something better. </s>
<s> I always like to be sure. </s>
<s> P.S. </s>
<s> I got the router for about 90.00. </s>
<s> All together u should be able to hook up for around 350.00. </s>
<s> Good Luck </s>
