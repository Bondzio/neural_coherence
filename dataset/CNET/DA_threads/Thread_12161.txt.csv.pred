1.2.1	Firstly in order to do anything with a camcorder/pc hook up USB wo n't fly .	St
1.2.2	You need a firewire hook up , not sure what the unit has for output , either 4 or 5 pin .	St
1.2.3	The pc has to have a firewire hook up as well .	St
1.2.4	Basically it is a matter of getting the right cable and of course your computer having firewire capability .	St
1.2.5	Could it be used as a web cam , possibly .	St
1.2.6	Check the unit manual and specifications .	St
1.2.7	It would be easier , unless you have the hardware , firwire card in computer and proper link cable , to buy a usb web cam , they are cheap and readily available .	St
