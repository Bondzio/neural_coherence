Lol, cool.
Unfortunately I'm looking for an internal one .
However - I just found out that Seagate actually has a new internal laptop hard drive model coming out that is exactly what I want.
It is a 7200RPM internal 2.5'' drive with 160GB of storage.
This is perfect for my needs - however, it doesn't seem to be out yet, even though it was announced in June...
