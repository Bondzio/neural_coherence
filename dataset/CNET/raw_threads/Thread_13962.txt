I can't print anything off of the Internet. I can print normal email and documents that I've saved. I tried to print airline confirmation that came with my email message, and all I got was blank pages that rolled through the printer. I just attempted to print some movie theater info off the Internet, and the same thing happened. I can't find any information in my Epson booklet about this kind of problem. I just downloaded a new driver, but that didn't help. Can someone please help me?

You can also look into any &quot;add-ons&quot; if you use them as well. If definitely the browser, then delete it and reload it again, but save your favorites for later return. If you like try a &quot;restore point&quot; to to a date before the problem. If that works and later it doesn't, then some update maybe at work here. I exclude any system issues. FYI- I have Firefox and it works printing whatever I deem necessary. This is going to be one of those problems that someone reports on and us Firefox users point to a fix or you have something unique to you. tada -----Willy

(Like you, it worked on IE). Apparently the cause was a MS update. I just right-clicked the printer in the printers and devices folder and removed the printer (with the printer off). Then I turned the printer on. The drivers were automatically installed and voila! Everything worked.
