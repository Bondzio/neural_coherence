if you have the install cd, check to see if there a printable manual there.
for all intents and purposes, it really doesn't provide much other than pictures and basic install and info.
just make a 1-page document that describes how to install, laminate it if you want.
hp may have a reference file on that model, check to see.
good luck -----willy
