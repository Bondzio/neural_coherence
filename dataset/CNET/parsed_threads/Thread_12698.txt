<s> Hello, My company is looking for an alternative to using a standard projector in our main conference room for meetings. </s>
<s> We would like to move away from having to setup a projector each time we have a meeting to having some type of permanent monitor or display of some sort that we can simply plug a laptop into and be ready to go. </s>
<s> Due to the nature of our building, we cannot mount a projector on the ceiling so we need something we can mount on the wall. </s>
<s> Can anyone recommend any monitors or technology that would be good for this type of situation? </s>
<s> Im not very familiar with any of this type of technology so even names of what type of technology I should search for would be very helpful (e.g., projection monitors). </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for your help! </s>
<s> What about non-projected displays? </s>
<s> http://www.daktronics.com/video_prod/dak_video_products.cfm?section=ProStar_VideoPlus_Displays&category=For_Mobile for example. </s>
<s> They do make them smaller too. </s>

<s> Yes, something along these lines would be perfect. </s>
<s> What would you call these types of monitors? </s>
<s> LCD displays? </s>
<s> Thanks for your help! </s>
<s> The makers of such are using a variety of technologies... </s>
<s> But what you need to do is to settle on some size. </s>
<s> We fitted a room with a big HDTV screen and its super. </s>
<s> Where did we get it? </s>
<s> Best Buy... Why? </s>
<s> It was cheapest there. </s>
<s> Your needs may vary. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks a lot for your help! </s>
<s> I really appreciate it. </s>
