Each alien member on the spaceship was connected to a network in a way that their brains combined to make something superpowered. Let's say you have a small LAN of 50-100 PC workstations and each of these PC's has a 1TB SATA hard disk. Let's also assume that users only use about 25% of that 1TB disk for applications and data on the local PC. So a 100 PC LAN has 75TB of unused disk space. Is there any software that would allow one to take unused disk space from each PC and add that capacity to a pool of storage space? It would seem you could even use striping and mirroring of data over multiple PC's for performance and reliability. In other words, could each PC contribute unused storage space to a big pool that a designated server could treat as one big storage space, as in a storage area network?

It can only distrubute/replicate data between Windows Server 2003, 2008, 2012. I would like to utilize all that unused storage space on all those workstations. It appears DFS can't do that.

At no point was Windows listed in your top post so I thought, hey, that old idea. These ideas were kicked around for years but as disk space costs dropped, the idea went with it. You seem to want to try it again so why not? In other words, you'll have to create it. Bob
