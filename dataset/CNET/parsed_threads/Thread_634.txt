<s> Hi, I am interested in purchasing a wireless router that has a USB port for external storage. </s>
<s> I like the idea of having a network attached storage that is always online, but my main intention of having external storage is to do backups. </s>
<s> I'm curious if it is feasible to do backups wirelessly? </s>
<s> and is there a software or freeware that can do this so that I can recover to a particular date or recover only particular file? </s>
<s> Regards </s>
<s> Works fine but some will flame that it's slower over the network. </s>
<s> Yup. </s>
<s> There are file size limits such as 4GG but that's a non-issue for me. </s>
<s> As to all your questions, it's &quot;yes.&quot; As to the backup software I use SYNCBACK (see google.com). </s>
