&quot;in the meantime, pull the cover off and make sure the cpu heatsink is in place and all fans are spinning...&quot; ok, what is the heatsink?
i know where the fan is and can check that.
btw, could i use hardware like cd-rw drive, floppy drive, etc in my new machine.
or are they damaged?
thank you for helping me out.
