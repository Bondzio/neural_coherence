you will need to make sure that the pci wireless card has drivers for the operating system of the old computer.
a couple of years ago i was in a similar situation and a belkin product wouldn't work on a computer with windows 98 on it, where a linksys was ok. that may be even more of a problem now.
another solution would be an ordinary pci network card, may need an old second hand one?
and a wireless access point that can be setup as a wireless client.
