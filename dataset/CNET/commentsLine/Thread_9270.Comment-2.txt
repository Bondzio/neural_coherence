you need to define what a &quot;commercial dvd&quot; is.
i'm guessing you mean the silver cds or dvds that you buy with music or video content.
if so, then you may want to know that such are not &quot;burned&quot; but are &quot;pressed&quot;.
does that help?
as to the mad dog.
it's a value unit that should last a year or two but isn't very expensive.
