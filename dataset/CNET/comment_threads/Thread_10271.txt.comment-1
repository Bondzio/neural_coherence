Hello, I'm having a heck of a time trying to find myself a UDMA mode-6 enabled motherboard to run SSD.
Unfortunately, I cannot find the UDMA mode listed on many motherboard specification sheets.
Asus recommened that I check out the P9X79 motherboard.
Currently, I am running a Asus P7P55D-E LX which is listed as having 2x 6/Gbs SATA ports.
However, UDMA 6 enabled SSD's are only being run @ UDMA 5... Any tips on UDMA mode-6 motherboards would be great.
I am willing to go with AMD or Intel (preferably Intel) CPUs along with it.
Thanks!
