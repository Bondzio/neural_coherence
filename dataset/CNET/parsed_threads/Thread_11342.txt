<s> Have 3 servers all on separate dedicated private networks. </s>
<s> These servers are not allowed to route to each other. </s>
<s> All servers reside in the same rack. </s>
<s> Would like to use windows server backup to create recovery images of each server and save to external. </s>
<s> Was thinking about putting in a USB 3 hub then attach to a Buffalo TeraStation 5400r Rackmount via USB. </s>
<s> Doable? </s>
<s> (alternative suggestions would be greatly appreciated) Thanks. </s>
<s> USB is not a network so you would have to put in some USB switch to get it to work. </s>
<s> Also, given how unreliable externals are, read http://forums.cnet.com/7723-7588_102-592939/external-hard-drive/?tag=contentBody;threadListing and hundred more where you get advice to have more backups. </s>
<s> Since having a single storage device is known to result is total loss, why are you repeating history? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Open to suggestions.. </s>
<s> I cannot route any network traffic nor create a back-end dedicated network for network backups between these servers. </s>
<s> The Buffalo is 4-disk hot-swap RAID NAS..only I cannot network the servers together. </s>
<s> I will look into connecting the Buffalo to my KVM and try that. </s>
<s> Disable/enable usb port on the server to correlate with backup times? </s>
<s> You're setting yourself up for a doosey of a failure, should it happen(it can). </s>
<s> Funneling everything to &quot;one&quot; anything is bound to cause some issue to arise. </s>
<s> I don't know why you have 3-servers but you've crossed into commercial or beyond typical home user application. </s>
<s> Thus, you need to spend the $ to get real and find what it really takes. </s>
<s> Why, you're not using some Server OS(or similar) is beyond me(I assume). </s>
<s> I would think, your best doable and reasonable setup would be a dump to a singular HD for each server. </s>
<s> But, IMO look at NAS setups and Buffalo can help there too. </s>
<s> If you have a home brew server setup, try to standardize what you have, so things can settle. </s>
<s> When it comes to USB, try to stay away from that, use ethernet when you can. </s>
<s> Why, because think of it as a highway of 3-lanes now where everyone has to exit onto a 1-lane exit ramp. </s>
<s> Plus, you made your setup to connect all to one backup, you've in effect made a backdoor link of sorts, somehow I can't see this as a good idea. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> The Buffalo is a 4 disk RAID unit. </s>
<s> None of the servers are connected to the internet nor will the buffalo be connected to the internet. </s>
<s> Kinda stuck with what I have. </s>
<s> Mainly trying to get backups locally without taking up too much rack space. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> From past experience once you get into &quot;hodge-podge&quot; setups, sooner or later something happens. </s>
<s> Because it is some unique setup or arrangement, it becomes difficult to sort out. </s>
<s> Even for a pro, it boils down to get to the basics or lower level in order to settle things out. </s>
<s> I think once you have this happen to you, it all makes sense what I'm stating. </s>
<s> You will teach yourself what works and not. </s>
<s> Overall, I see you're trying to get the most out of it but placing some requirement and making everything else to conform or bend to it. </s>
<s> You do what you gotta do, as others may offer, it is what it is and sometimes that's a build-up to a major failure. </s>
<s> As I stated you it's not a good idea. </s>
<s> I have no clue if you were on the WWW/internet you didn't state that. </s>
<s> However, it is still possible should it become more open to your demands as time goes by at no fault of your own. </s>
<s> It's just an issue I saw as possible given the info provided. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks Willy! </s>
<s> Open to suggestions that do not require connecting any to the internet or routing any traffic between the isolated networks. </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
<s> Sorry but that wouldn't work either. </s>
<s> But this is not to say it can't be crafted. </s>
<s> http://hackaday.com/2011/09/29/remote-controlled-usb-switch/ shows that we can automate the switching of USB. </s>
<s> I think you should see that one backup system per server is the easy solution. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> First and foremost, I highly, HIGHLY recommend that you consider the distinct advantages to switching over to dedicated server hosting, as the hodge-podge of components you have are not nearly enterprise grade in comparison to the functions you expect and the configuration you are trying to make work. </s>
<s> That being said, the hub idea would not work, usb does not work the same way as a network, and all 3 Servers cannot access the USB device at the same time. </s>
<s> The only proper way to do this with external drives is to have 3 separate external drives, one for each server. </s>
<s> If you are worried about redundancy you can network those shares and then back them up to a central SAN. </s>
