1.
The firmware must be the latest.
2.
VPN can stress many since they don't realize the &quot;rules&quot;.
If you are on a VPN to work, you won't see your LAN... 3.
You may need a &quot;VPN ROUTER&quot; since some non-VPN-routers will only support... 1 connection at a time.
4.
If you installed a firewall in your PC, then you are very much on your own.
I can't help you at all.
