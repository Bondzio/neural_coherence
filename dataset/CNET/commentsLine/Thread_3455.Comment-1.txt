i'm looking for an easy-to-use, moderately price external hard drive (~80gb, usb) to serve as a backup device.
do experienced users here have any specific recommendations.
i've reviewed the different selections listed here, but find no reviewer ratings and user ratings are all over the place.
thanks much!
