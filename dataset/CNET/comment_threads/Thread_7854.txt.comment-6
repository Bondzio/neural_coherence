I have a Toshiba Satellite 1830 laptop with XP Pro OS and was having heaps of problems with &quot;blue screens&quot; and sudden shutdoowns.
I tried the &quot;elevation option&quot;, which did reduce the frequency of the above problems but did not eliminate it.
Then, in desperation I purchased a &quot;YL Notebook Cooler Pad&quot; (Model NB-02) from a supplier on E-bay for AUD 29 including postage.
I'm overjoyed with the results ...
Since then, I've not experienced one Blue Screen or shutdown.
Additionally, the laptop seems to even funtion more quickly/efficiently when performing routine tasks.
It's a truly amazing result and well worth the money spent.
