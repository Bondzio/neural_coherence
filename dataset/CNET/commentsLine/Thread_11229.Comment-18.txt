sorry bout that, i didn't no it either and i just assumed all did.
i just read it before i posted it.
so, just to verify, since my restore disc has the os and drivers on it, i can just do the reformat without having to do all that other stuff that was in the links.
i actually do want to back 1 thing up, nero.
how would i back this up on a disc.
just burn the whole thing on there or just parts of it.
it is a downloaded iso version.
