first update your driver files from the nvidia website.
if the game still runs slow then i would recommend changing your settings not all just change the screen resolution to 800x600.
what a lot of people dont realise is these games are made for the next generation of video cards in other words they wont run as fast as there supposed to until the next gen video cards are out.
basically its a sales pitch so that users go out and actually buy new video cards for there games.
