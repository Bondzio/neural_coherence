<s> Looking to buy a 500 GB USB external hard drive. </s>
<s> Nothing fancy, just want something reliable. </s>
<s> Any experience with a good one? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, Gabe Quashnofsky </s>
<s> Seagate internal hard drive and put into a USB-2 case. </s>
<s> I have two SimpleTech external drives that have run without a glitch for over a year or more. </s>
<s> One sits on my work desk, the other I carry around in my day bag with my laptop. </s>
<s> I just bought one for $60. </s>
<s> Although I am not a USB fan but I just couldn't let it pass at this price, hehe. </s>
<s> It seems to have good speed. </s>
<s> I recommend that you do not buy Seagate (Maxtor). </s>
<s> I bought a 500 gb and now that I want to buy a new computer I have found out that it will not work with VIsta 64 bit. </s>
<s> Nothing on box says this. </s>
<s> Says it is compatible with Vista. </s>
<s> THey should of said Vista 32 but they did not. </s>
<s> No plans for new drivers either. </s>
<s> Just be sure that whatever brand you buy it specifies Vista 64 bit as this is the os that will soon be the norm and 32 bit will be out. </s>
