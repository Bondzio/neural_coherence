if you look at my motherboard in the above link it's the one plugged into slot #25. so the one you're recommending would be plugged into slot # 27 or 28, right?
and they'd both be in use simultaneously?
just to follow up: -i'd rather spend less money.
what's the cheapest one i could get that would work on my system with a 1600x900 monitor?
-second, will my psu have enough juice to support 3 displays?
