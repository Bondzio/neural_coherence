an indoor antenna would possibly pick up a station??
There are a few that are reasonably good designs and offer some minimal gain.
I would guess that any outside antenna on the roof would establish a precedent and every body would want one.
Need to get the dorm members together to share with the costs for satellite and a good didtribution amplifier.
From the roof in a cornfield the view south should be clear as a bell.
Make a small corp that would carry on every year.
Good luch.
