one more question please sir, says i should buy ram heat sinks for the onboard ram... cant find the ram on the board.
i see dvi ports, tv port, power in, zalman hsf, sli connector, 16x interface, and a row of capacitors, but i cannot identify the ram.
its probably some of those black squares.
which black squares are the ram?
can i even buy a cover for grafix card ram?
