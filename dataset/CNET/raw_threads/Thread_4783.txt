I also purchased an 23&quot; ASUS VH-232H monitor. For some reason the desktop screen won't fill the entire 23 inch screen. I'm getting black bars around the edges of the monitor. Is this a limitation of the video card or something I'm missing with the settings? Thanks in advance for your help.

What's the setting of the resolution in the video driver? Those should match. If they do, try the monitor on another PC with the same resolution settings. What happens? Did you try all settings on the monitor (most monitors come with their own settings menu for brightness and contrast and much, including possible shift up or down or left or right). Kees

The only time I can see black bars on the edges is if I set the monitor to 4:3 mode. That's just an adjustment with the monitor controls.....4:3 or full screen. Vid card res.....on this machine if I right click a blank area of the desktop and select properties/settings I see a slider to select screen res. Best to set it to monitor native res.
