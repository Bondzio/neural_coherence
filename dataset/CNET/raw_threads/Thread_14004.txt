It would be nice if a developer would automate this process, perhaps as part of their existing HDD diagnostic software. The software would have to power on the drive, wait to verify access or no bad error messages, and if fails power off for 30 seconds. Its a simple program, but but it needs to be put in place. (Im still waiting for them to develop a device that will gently slam a HDD on a countertop repeatedly [because that sometimes works!] heh heh)

I've tried everything. Do you think repeatedly connecting to power wouold do any good at all? I am seriously considering slamming it on something.

I'd think a broken motor would cause a distinctive sound or lack of one. There is the old freezer method which I've never tried and skeptical of anyway but I've heard others swear it works.

It does make a distinctive noise... an intermittent beeping which is supposedly the sign of a damaged motor for Maxtor drives. So I guess I am out of luck. I'd really like to get the data back, but not enough to want to pay a retrieval service big bucks. Maybe I WILL try slamming it. Thanks.
