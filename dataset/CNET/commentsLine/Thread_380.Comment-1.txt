i tried a dual monitor setup for several days when my company donated 3 older crt monitors.
i played around with: ati 128mb radeon 9800 pro dell ultrasharp 18.1'' lcd monitor (no pivot mode) some 17'' compaq crt monitor i don't have this setup anymore since.
my deskspace barely has enough for these 2 monitors, my pc tower, and misc stuff like speakers which also meant i couldn't really see the tv with it the extra one there, but i might reconfigure the setup later on.
in the meantime, any1 have tips or utilities to share for dual monitor users?
tips like how to seperate 2 opened excel files into 2 entries on the taskbar so i can put 'em side by side across the monitors.
and utilities/software/games like minmaxextender which is actually for single monitors but deals with window functionality like ''always on top'', ''vertical max'', etc.?)
or fun stuff like particle fire 2 (screen saver with dual monitor support) i keep work stuff at work, so this pc is mostly used for pc games, surfing, and and multimedia.
i actually tried using the 2nd monitor to surf while watching tv shows/movies (on dvd) or while a slow/lagging pc game was loading up.
it was pretty neat.
