sorry for late reply.
too much has changed since your last pc purchase.
imo, there will be no swapping over of anything worthwhile, because nothing would be compilable.
maybe, the hd could be re-used but just about everthig eklelse is dead on an newer system because there is no agp, ram is ddr3(very common) and faster is better as that's the common install, it just is.
the hds are far larger and is sata not ide as was in the olden days.
that's why i mentioned, newer would fit the bill for what you seem to want to do.
i wouldn't hesitate in stepping-up from basic or entry level offering though but get a better pc with a little more $.
i do suggest to check the requirements of any s/w(pgms) demands be meant by the new pc or h/w.
i think you'll find it will do, excluding some extremes.
be warned, basic &quot;on-board&quot; video is just basic but even that is better than what was available 5yrs.
ago.
if you need better, the pci-ex16 is the way to go.
next, the hd is likely to be sata, 500gb is a real sweet spot but 1tb isn't uncommon.
the better ram to have is ddr3, and in use by win 7 based os, likely needs 4gb and having more is good, but 4gb will do fine as a starter.
as for the cpu, the amd ii class of multi-core of 2 cores will do fine but more is better.
(compare all the various amd cpus) tada -----willy
