I have to turn the power button on the back off and wait a few minutes before turning it back on. I assumed at first it was the power supply. However i remembered to turn my temp and fan speed monitor back on to find that it is overheating which could be turning my computer off as well. Any thoughts?

First guess would be power supply is on the way out, could be other things that were mentioned in prior post, heat can also create the issue. The processor fan is a fairly common culprit for that scenario if it is on the way out, slowing down or stopping can send system in to shutdown.

You need to check your CPU temperature. One useful software is called RMCLOCK, it is free for download. It will tell you your CPU work load, and temperature. If CPU is overheat, you might need a better CPU fan.
