I would like to split the monitor signal from the computer (15 pin SVGA), with one going to a monitor that is hooked into a KVM switch, the other to an LCD t.v., which has a monitor capable input.
I initially tried this with a monitor Y cable, but the monitor behaved erratically, as if it wanted to turn on and off.
The LCD t.v.
looked normal, except it flashed some signal &quot;over size&quot; which I haven't yet investigated.
Would a video distribution amplifier, for a 15 pin monitor cable be available for sale?
One input, with two outputs?
I assume this would solve it.
