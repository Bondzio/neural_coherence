if you have critical data on the hd you want to save, remove it if all else fails.
you can mount the hd into an ext.
hd case and rretrieve data or install as 2nd hd in another system, that way.
as another cure for your problem, again if all else fails, check ebay or craigslist for an exact same hp model# in order to continue on or even another hp system at reasonable cost.
you can install old hd in order to retrieve data then or swap hds, it may boot if exact hp models(maybe?).
