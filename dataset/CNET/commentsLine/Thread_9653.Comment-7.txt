well, that could be a problem seeing as how i have a dell wireless card.
i know on the dell website they advertise/sell linksys, netgear, and d link.
my girlfriend and myself often send files over the network to each other.
i know that using a usb drive would probably solve my problem, but just wondering what your folks thought?
has anyone had good experiences with the dell draft-n card and a particular router?
btw thanks bob for all of your help!
