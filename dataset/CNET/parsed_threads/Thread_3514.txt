<s> I desperately want to upgrade my old desktop but am not sure what I can do. </s>
<s> I am running an old Gateway G6 350 machine. </s>
<s> I recently upgraded to Windows ME on this machine to utilize my cable connection, and I need to know how I can improve this machines performance. </s>
<s> I have been considering a new motherboard with faster processor, but was beginning to wonder if I could just plug in a faster processor into my existing board. </s>
<s> I have an ATX board with an Intel Pentium II Processor running 350 MHZ. </s>
<s> L2 Cache:512, pipeline burst integrated,100 MHZ Bus speed, package : SECC, 1 Slot. </s>
<s> Running 256MB Ram. </s>
<s> This is the only info I have on processor, don't know if it is enough. </s>
<s> I have been looking for info on these subjects for days.Can I plug in any ATX board with faster chip? </s>
<s> Can I plug in any &quot;slot 1&quot; chip? </s>
<s> Is there a different &quot;chipset&quot; # or term I need to look for about this processor. </s>
<s> Would rather spend $ on upgrading processor than on more ram (only 2 slots). </s>
<s> Need HELP!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Isn't upgradable, really. </s>
<s> A new motherboard and processor are needed as a bundle, then you'll need RAM to match. </s>
<s> I just rebuilt my web server and got an Elitegroup K8M800-M2 motherboard with onboard sound, video, and LAN, an AMD Sempron 1.6 GHz processor, 512 Meg of Kingston RAM. </s>
<s> The board cost $79.99, the processor cost $59.99, and the RAM cost $59.99. </s>
<s> I kept the HD and optical drive. </s>
<s> The board also has 6 USB-2 ports. </s>
<s> I found an OEM copy of WP Home here http://www.edirectsoftware.com/WindowsXPHome.html I installed everything in about a day. </s>
<s> Runs like a top. </s>

<s> You can get a good power supply most anywhere. </s>
<s> I put in an Antec 350. </s>
<s> Seems like it was about forty bucks. </s>
<s> I've been looking at bundled ATX motherboards and CPU (P3's usually around 800mhz)but was not sure if they would plug in/fit in the case and work with my existing dvd rom and floppy. </s>
<s> Also power is now a question. </s>
<s> Do I have to upgrade power with upgraded board? </s>
<s> Currently running a 200-250 watt power supply. </s>
<s> One thing to keep in mind is that Dell, HP, Compact and Gateway will use NON standard cases and MB. </s>
<s> So a Standard ATX MB may NOT fit in your Gateway case. </s>
<s> A PII is probably a AT case fromat so an ATX MB will not fit. </s>
<s> Save up you money and plan on building a NEW PC. </s>
<s> Outpost.com has a AMD Sempron 2400+ and ECS MB for $70. </s>
<s> Get a new case for $50 with a 400wPSU on sale. </s>
<s> A stick of 512mb DDRPC 3200 for $40 after rebate. </s>
<s> A DVD burner for $40. </s>
<s> a 128mb video card is $50. </s>

<s> During my research I came across someone saying this computer had a ATX board. </s>
<s> How can I tell what type it is. </s>
<s> I have opened case before to install cd-rw drive and Lan card but have no idea how to tell motherboards apart. </s>
<s> Here is a link to help. </s>
<s> go to the MB section and click on the picture to enlarge. </s>
<s> It shows a standard ATX MB. </s>
<s> http://www.build-your-own-computer-tips.com/index.html This shows a typical ATX MB compare the postion of the keyboard and mouse plugs to yours. </s>

<s> If you want, you can tell us the details of your motherboard. </s>
<s> Download Belarc Advisor and run it. </s>
<s> It will give you details on all your system hardware and a lot of the software. </s>
<s> http://www.download.com/Belarc-Advisor/3000-2094_4-10406799.html?tag=lst-0-1 Copy what it says under &quot;Main Circuit Board&quot; and paste into this discussion. </s>
<s> A simple way to get a lot of details about your system (and usually a motherboard manual) is to enter your computer serial number here: http://support.gateway.com/support/default.asp?cmlid=support_top </s>
<s> The slot 1 transistion to socket 370 ended with some PIIIs running at 600mh. </s>
<s> There were 2 mounting hardware configurations, as I recall. </s>
<s> I had one ASUS board I remember converting to accept the PIII module. </s>
<s> After 600mh it was socket 370. </s>
<s> So, you might find an old 600mh slot 1 module out there. </s>
<s> If it's cheap enough, it might be worth a try. </s>

<s> I still have my PIII 500MHz machine from Gateway. </s>
<s> It is a Slot 1 board that can take a PII or PIII. </s>
<s> I can't remember the exact model number, but it's an Intel Tabor something-or-other that can take up to a 550MHz PIII. </s>
<s> Ah, the memories.... </s>
<s> My boards layout is almost exactly like that one (build you own computer site)and my case hase two spacers/connectors lower than my board to accomodate a board with more PCI slots. </s>
<s> Unlike specs for my computer I have seen, mine only has 2 RAM slots. </s>
<s> Thanks for the info I'm beginning to wonder if I shouldn't bite the bullet and buy a new PC and give this one to the kids. </s>
<s> But with money as tight as it is, just trying to pinch pennies and get all I can out of ths machine. </s>
<s> RC440BX motherboard http://support.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/rc440bx/ RC440BX Technical Info (458K PDF) ftp://download.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/rc440bx/71383201.pdf </s>
<s> I went through the same thing with my PIII HP. </s>
<s> I ended up scrapping everything but the optical drives and keyboard. </s>
<s> You can get a new case for a little as $25, a motherboard/CBU combo deal for about $60, 512 MB memory sticks for $50, and an OEM operating system for $80. </s>
<s> Don't forget the power supply ($40) and CPU fan/heat sink ($20). </s>
<s> I'm quoting prices from memory, so I could be a tad off. </s>
<s> When you add it all up, you'd probably spend about as much as you would for one of Walmart's boxed entry-level sets. </s>
<s> But what's the fun of that? </s>
<s> Seems to me all your problems ly on you motherboard. </s>
<s> If you want new technology, get a motherboard with a socket that can handle fast cpu's, and many of those motherboards come with x16 pci slot for a high end graphics card. </s>
<s> Many motherboards also have SLI compatibility for 2 graphics cards. </s>
<s> With a new motherboard, new CPU, graphics card, and more memory, your system will be up and running like brand new. </s>
<s> I also highly advise you get a new OS, like XP Home. </s>
<s> It looks like an interesting project for the properly motivated. </s>
<s> Here's what I found by doing a quick check through the Intel docs. </s>
<s> Current BIOS: 4R4CB0XA.15A.0010.P03.9809011626 09/01/98 Newer BIOS available: 4R4CB0XA.86A.0020.P14 6/27/2000 The ''Motherboard Specification Update'' PDF says that the new bios should enable the board to take ''Slot 1'' (242-contact) PIII processors up to 600MHZ. </s>
<s> The BIOS also enables the memory slots to take a 256MB module for a total of 512MB. </s>
<s> It's up to you, but the money that you spend on the upgrades of the old computer could get you a long way towards the low-end Pentium 4 or AMD CPU systems that have been suggested in this discussion. </s>
<s> Anyhow, the BIOS Update is free: RCBIOS14.EXE </s>
<s> So can I assume that this means any standard ATX board will fit into my case? </s>
<s> And if so will work with existing hardware? </s>
<s> That was one of the questions I had in my original post. </s>
<s> I am wondering if it is just that easy, get a newer ATX board with a faster processor and heatsink, more ram, possibly a larger power supply, and just plug it into my case and existing peripherals. </s>
<s> Is it going to be that easy? </s>
<s> Will any ATX standard mobo work? </s>
<s> '' So can I assume that this means any standard ATX board will fit into my case?'' </s>
<s> Not necessarily. </s>
<s> Look on P.12 of the Technical Information PDF. </s>
<s> Section ''1.1 Overview'' says the motherboard was made in microATX (9.6'' x 9.6'') and full ATX (12.0'' x 9.6'') sizes. </s>
<s> Which one do you have? </s>
<s> You could put a microATX board in a number of standard case sizes, but you can't put a full ATX board in the smaller ATX cases. </s>
<s> If you are going to get a new motherboard that can accommodate a more recent CPU (P4, Athlon 64, dual cores), the other components will have to be of a more recent generation as well. </s>
<s> This includes the power supply unit (PSU). </s>
<s> New components probably will need a new case to ensure proper cooling, fit larger fans, accommodate larger heatsinks, et al. </s>
<s> There are good deals on new cases that come with PSU's. </s>
<s> Look at all the different case sizes listed under &quot;Type&quot; http://www.newegg.com/ProductSort/SubCategory.asp?SubCategory=7 </s>
<s> I'd just worry about starting with the CPU you want and then add a motherboard. </s>
<s> From that base you can add other components, including the case and PSU. </s>
<s> The way you decide on the CPU and motherboard is first to ask yourself what you want the computer to be able to do. </s>
<s> Yes I did see that part. </s>
<s> My board appears to be a micro. </s>
<s> (9.6&quot; x 9.6&quot;) But my case has 3&quot; vertical clearance from bottom of mobo to bottom of case and extra set of connectors to accomadate (I assume) the larger board with more pci slots. </s>
<s> my case has 2 pci slot openings in it that cannot be utilized with existing board due to its size. </s>
<s> If I can't get a P4 (no biggie) can i get a P3 (or older athlon,not really up to snuff on their products)around 800mhz and still utilize existing peripherals, i.e. </s>
<s> dvd rom and floppy. </s>
<s> (also psu)I'm only trying to get as much as i can without building or buying all new computer. </s>
<s> If it will only be a 600mhz processor I can get that probably won't be worth the effort and I would probably just build a newer computer (first time) to save $. </s>
<s> According to the specifications of the upgraded BIOS on your current mobo, you should be able to upgrade to this Slot1 PIII 600MHz processor; however I give no guarantees. </s>
<s> For the price, it may be worth the tinkering. </s>
<s> http://www.geeks.com/products.asp?cat=CPU Problem is that you will still be limited with the 600MHz PIII. </s>
<s> A lot of today's hardware and software needs a faster processor or one with a specific instruction set. </s>
<s> I think you are right--probably the only case items you could bring to the new build are the DVD and floppy drives. </s>
<s> well it's looking like I have a building project on my hands to get the results I really want. </s>
<s> Thanks for all the info and your help. </s>
