finally started using the standard atx wiring.
at least i hope so for the sake of this gentleman.
he has to check with dell.
the reverse could also have happened if he bought a supply for an older dell model, that is not wired to the atx standard.
a standard atx connected to the older dell's definitely zapped the mobo.
