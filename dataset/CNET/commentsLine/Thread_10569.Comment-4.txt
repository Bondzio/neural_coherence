roxxxy, you have a very workable system now!
i'd recommend you simply learn to use the linux system; it's not that different from windows, and while windows development is slowing down dramatically, linux is exploding.
also, i personally don't like the direction windows is headed, with us users having less and less control over what our computers will do.
i didn't want &quot;big brother&quot; deciding what's best for me, and i certainly don't want bill gates to do it.
by its very nature, linux has no ceo and very little government control.
also: very little malware (virus etc) is being written for linux, and i see a day coming soon when some virus cripples nearly all windows computers.
that nearly did happen a few years back with the blaster worm.
