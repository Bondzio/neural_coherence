1.1.1	I just purchased this device (External USB 2.0 & FIREWIRE SONY DW-U22A 16x Dual Layer DVD+-R/RW Drive) and tried to install the driver prior to connecting the drive.	St
1.1.2	First off, I have Win XP Home and the driver prompted me that the driver was for win98.	St
1.1.3	Secondly, it is showing up in &quot;my computer&quot; as a zip drive with only 35 mb of space.	St
1.1.4	I did try doing a search to find an XP Home driver but had no luck.	St
1.1.5	Nothing in the directions seemed to work.	St
1.1.6	Does anyone have this device and can help me?	Ques
1.1.7	TIA	St
1.2.1	Just FYI.	St
1.2.2	I put a bare TEAC into an USB 2.0 drive case and installed NO DRIVERS for it and XP works with it just fine.	St
1.2.3	BUT the functions of DVD recording and such is NOT CONTAINED IN A DRIVER which confuses some.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thank you for the reply.	St
1.3.2	Apparently the instructions for this device was poorly written.	St
1.3.3	I was under the impression that I needed to format &quot;some&quot; drive.	St
1.3.4	The instructions went from installing the dvd drive right into formating the drive and I thought there was more that I needed to do.	St
1.3.5	Drive works fine	St
