If you're planning to stick with your Current Processor you don't need a new PSU.
The X800XL Uses very low energy (like 60watts).
go check out the X800XL online.
My Friend has a 250watt(or 270Watt cheap PSU) PSU; he got an X800 overclocked with a 3500+ and 768RAM, no cooling except CPU/Heatsink, 1 double layer cd/dvd combo and last but not least, a 120GB HD.
NO PROBLEMS AT ALL.
His computer doesn't get very hot, sometimes very warm.
Google the X800XL yourself and find out.
