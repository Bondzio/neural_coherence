Everything was working fine until yesterday afternoon. I went to click on one of my games and it said the disk that it was on was no longer available. I looked in My Computer and it was not there. It also did not show up in the device manager. I rebooted the machine and it was still showing in the bios. I exited out without saving any changes and let Windows start however it just stayed on the Windows XP screen and finally give me an option to login to safe mode or last known good configuration. I chose safe mode but it just hung so I rebooted and went with the last known good configuration and Windows started. The hard drive was still not listed in My computer or the device manager. By chance I clicked on &quot;scan for hardware changes&quot; and it popped up and said it was working properly but I still could not access it. I went back to the bios and it no longer shows there on anywhere in Windows. I took the drive out and put it in another machine and not only did the drive come up just fine but all of the data is there and I could even play a game that is installed on the drive. I put it back into my computer and it doesn't appear. Any ideas of what to try?

4583	2	515643	5074047	5073938	Willy	1/31/11 6:40 AM	1.296456E12	Quick check	Try the usual, replace the cables, reseat several times the cable at both ends. verify power cable is good, etc.. next, if you have access to the vendor HD diags, run them. The other half is the mtrbd. port could be flaky to include physical damage. You gave no clue to type of HD, SATA or EIDE. But, SATA can be iffy at times, thus a reset to include EIDE. While the HD works in another PC, the current PC could be an heat issue that makes a borderline problem. Since, you have two HDs installed, this can happen over time. The electronics are prone to be weaken due to heat and you maybe at that stage where it just starts. Given more time, the problem will become permanent. If you can cool the HDs installed, check results. If this is a mtrbd. problem, replace, no fix usually. Try the problem HD alone and the other HG removed and check results in current PC. To run vendor HD diags(from support website), use the other PC to check it out to remove possible PC problem. tada -----Willy

Sorry for leaving out the information. I tried changing the cables out and took out the CMOS battery with no luck. I didn't think about trying to run the diags on the other computer. (Thanks Willy) I did back up important information on a 3rd hd in the other computer so if it's going it will be o.k. I'll go try running the diags while the hd is in the other computer. If anyone has any other ideas please let me know. Thank You so much

There are no less than 15 ways to get a SATA drive supported in this old OS so think back which method you used. And be very careful which SATA motherboard port you choose since when you use the IDE EMULATION method I find boards to be picky which we use. The mystery is partially solved as to why the drive is missing. Now to see if it shows up when you place the SATA on 0,1,2 or the third port. Bob
