1.1.2	One is Pro, one is home.	St
1.1.3	Trying to set up your usual file / printer sharing...simple nothing advanced... they are on the same network..at&t uverse router.... the problem I am having is that they simply do not see each other...	St
1.1.4	I have enabled sharing on both computers, I have set them on the same Workgroup, firewalls are off, and I used the network setup wizard to setup both with the same options.	St
1.1.5	Now usually this has worked for me on just about every computer I have worked on in the past.. for some reason, it won't work on these 2. when I go to &quot;add network place&quot; and input the local IP's, it just says &quot;the folder you entered does not appear to be valid.	St
1.1.6	please choose another&quot;.	Sug
1.1.7	when I navigate to the workgroup in my network places, neither computer sees the other one.	St
1.1.8	I am able to ping them through CMD.. so I know it is not a hardware problem...	St
1.1.9	It was working fine until I sent one of the computers out to have some spyware removed, when it got back I started having this issue... Could it be that something was deleted along with the spyware, which is keeping that computer from having the ability to be on a network?	St
1.1.10	any ideas?	St
1.1.11	thank you	Polite
1.2.1	http://www.sbbala.com/uverse/ for example and many other documentations lead me to want a check of the firewall in the (which one?)	St
1.2.2	uverse router.	St

1.3.1	First thing to do is to make sure they see each other on the same workgroup.	St
1.3.2	I'm assuming you pinged both ways.	St
1.3.3	Try changing to another workgroup name.	St
1.3.4	If they still can't see each other, I would reinstall the nic drivers and fix tcpip-- http://support.microsoft.com/kb/811259 .	St
1.3.5	Try this first on the computer that is suspect.	St
1.4.1	the following commands fixed my problem; Reset TCP/IP stack to installation defaults, type: netsh int ip reset reset.log Reset WINSOCK entries to installation defaults, type: netsh winsock reset catalog thank you for your help	St
1.5.1	Nice work!	St
