<s> I was looking at the Lite On SOHW-1633S and the Plextor 712A/SA. </s>
<s> The Lite On is $40 cheaper and I wanted to know which one was better. </s>
<s> Both got good reviews on Newegg. </s>
<s> Oh and I was planning on purchasing a Lite On LTR-52327S as a cheap CD-R writer as well. </s>
<s> It also got good reviews so I figured the DVD writer should be good too. </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I just bought a 832S DVD burner for 35 bucks after rebate. </s>
<s> Sold my old CD burner installed for 30 bucks. </s>
<s> For 5 bucks I got an upgrade from CD burner to DVD:) The DVD burns CDs as well. </s>
<s> Why buy a seperate drive? </s>
<s> ~Tom </s>
<s> I bought a Lite On 1633S because it was cheaper and I stupidly forgot that one gets what they pay for. </s>
<s> I bought it on a Thursady; it was dead by Sunday morning. </s>
<s> Aside from quality issues, the Plextor comes with Roxio, while the Lite On comes with Nero. </s>
<s> Nero is not an acceptable substitute for Roxio, so - case closed! </s>
<s> Plextor! </s>
<s> After years with both, Plextor feels no different and in fact I feel like I overpaid for such. </s>
<s> Now I just pick out the cheap unit, place it in the rack with airspace top/bottom and good cooling. </s>
<s> Never lost an unit that wasn't 4 years old. </s>
<s> Roxio bolloxes up the system too much for me, so I prefer Nero and more often than not I use CDBurnerXP since it gets the job done without complaining it didn't come with the drive. </s>
<s> See http://www.cdburnerxp.se/ Bob </s>
<s> Look at http://www.cdspeed2000.com/ for test results and more. </s>

<s> Its all down to personal choice... but in a market driven by &quot;more bang fer ya bucks&quot; , Ive been a Lite-On devotee for years. </s>
<s> I paid 170 for an 8 speed CDwriter 4 years ago, and within a month or two, Lite-On were selling 24 speed writers for 60. </s>
<s> As friends bought theirs, I was sitting smugly waiting for their cheapo plastic burners to fall to pieces. </s>
<s> They didnt. </s>
<s> Mine did. </s>
<s> Since then, Ive built and sold dozens of PCs, and upgraded and repaired many more. </s>
<s> Whether it was a CDRom, or a CDWriter, or now DVD/CD burner combos, Ive never yet had a problem with a Lite-On. </s>
<s> Quite often, on a clean system with decent processor andm emory, they actually peform at max speed or above. </s>
<s> Like someone else who posted here, I also agree with the software bundle. </s>
<s> Roxio has its fans, but many more detractors. </s>
<s> Nero is simple to use and installs like a dream with little need for end user input. </s>
<s> From this users point of view (in my own PCs and the ones Ive built) you cant go wrong with a Lite-On, and they cost a heck of a lot less than most other brands </s>
