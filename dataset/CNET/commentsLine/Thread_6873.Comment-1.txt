i require a cpu for my gigabyte ga-7vaxp computer, it needs to be at least over a 3.0 ghz at least and needs to clock at the same as a 3 ghz pentium 4. i've looked at the documentation for my mobo but it only list amd cpu's and there aren't many that are fast, i'd search in google but i can't get accurate results and am not sure what to type in.
thanks!
