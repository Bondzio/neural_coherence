i just tried rotating both my displays using the nvidia control panel and only the first/primary display wound up being rotated -- the second display remained in landscape orientation.
this may be due to my dual monitors having different resolutions (primary is widescreen, secondary is 4:3) but you should confirm this functionality &quot;in-person&quot; since it wouldn't be the first time a tech support rep has made an misleading claim.
if you're not going to do any gaming, a geforce 7300 is more than sufficient.
