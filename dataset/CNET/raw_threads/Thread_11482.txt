When I try to use my Belkin Soho KVM switch neither machine will recognise the keyboard and mouse. Has anyone tried a similar setup and had success?

I have a Dell Dimenson 8250 (desktop), a Inspiron 700m. I hooked them both up to a 19'' LCD monitor using a Belkin KVM Switch. I also use a wireless keyboard and monitor. 2 Problems. The desktop computer looks great on the monitor, but the laptop only fills part of the screen...any thoughts? Additionally, the wireless keyboard and mouse work fine on the desktop but not the laptop, I really want to be able to use the keyboard for both? Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
