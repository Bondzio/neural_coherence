The CPU I'm using is a Dell Inspiron 600M and it has a S-Video out. The Television is a Daewoo 27&quot; Flat (not a lcd, nor HDTV, just a nice analog, I think) and it also has an S-video connection, as well as component Video connections. For some reason one of the regular A/V Inputs is marked &quot;Monitor&quot;, not sure if that can help me. I've heard you can just hook up directly, with no converter, using a regular S-Video cable. Anyone know if this would really work? If so, then why are there so many conversion products like the one in the link below? This is the one I'm thinkibg about buying. http://www.buymebuyme.com/retail/customer/product.php?productid=44338&cat=&page=1 Anyone ever bought this product or one similar to it? I've considered similar products ranging from $35 to $150, they're all supposed to do the same thing. Any helpful information on this topic, would be greatly appriciated. Thanks Ya'll, Cowboy

You can connect your laptop to the TV by buying a lead which fits your laptop tv-out and has a/v connectors at the other end for the tv. However, this is only going to be suitable for viewing a DVD-movie which is running on the laptop's DVD-drive. The low resolution of a TV and the fact that it produces a picture using 'lines' instead of 'pixels' means that a computer image (such as a web-page or the desktop) will look terrible on a tv. Any text would be virtually unreadable. That's where the converter comes in (the one you intend to buy). You won't need it to watch a dvd-movie because the dvd-software uses an 'overlay' to show the picture on the tv, but for anything else you will need the convertor which increases the tv resolution to same as we are used to having on a PC monitor (eg 800 x 600, 1024 x 768 etc).
