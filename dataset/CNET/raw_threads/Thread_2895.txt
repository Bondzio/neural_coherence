Of course Chkdsk found a string of errors, reporting things such as &quot;deleting corrupt attribute record...&quot;, &quot;deleting index entry...&quot;, and so on. After a long wait, the system rebooted, but I found my system even more unstable. Later I found out through the Event Viewer that Chkdsk did 'something' to numerous files in attempt to repair them. Among those were Windows core system dll's. When I tried to look for those files, they did not exist anywhere on the hard drive. I am afraid that maybe Chkdsk didn't do a good job repairing the flies. Perhaps what Chkdsk did was just overwriting the bad sectors? I thought at least Chkdsk could move the file segments on that specific sector to another healthy sector to maintain file integrity. I dare not to use Chkdsk again in the future, lest it should delete files by accident, rendering software, personal data, or even Windows useless. My question is: should I expect Chkdsk to repair the hard drive while also maintaining data integrity? Or is there any other way to do exactly the tasks mentioned above?

For that the tools vary with the OS. Sometimes it's SFC /SCANNOW and for other OSes it's something else. With all the malware out there, CHKDSK is only a minor tool in the kit. Bob

Chkdsk by itself will only check the disk, with /f or /r, or both will move the info to good sectors. Depending on the size of disk it may take awhile. Also it may only happen on a reboot cause it needs exclusive rights to the drive. SFC command will take you to original values, you will need to go to Microsoft update after the sfc was run. Hope this helps.

My OS was not damaged before I ran CHKDSK; it was just unstable (which I later found out to be nTune's fault). But AFTER I ran CHKDSK, some core system files were gone, such as msxml3r.dll, etc. And these files were all reported as &quot;located in bad sector and was repaired&quot; in CHKDSK's log. Even SFC /scannow did not totally recover them. I had to copy the dll's from my original XP cd. What I want to know is whether it's normal to lose data while disk utilities, such as CHKDSK, are doing their job?

But let's tackle MSXML3 since last week I ran into that and it was annoying that REGSVR32 MSXML3.DLL fails but if you download MSXML3.MSI and install that then all is well. Go figure why. Here's the MSXML3.MSI I used to correct this one. Bob

You will need your XP CD handy (or if on your harddrive as a partition it will find any files itself) Click Start &gt; Run &gt; type CMD press ok. This will bring up a Command Prompt Type in: SFC /scannow (make sure you have a space after SFC) Hopefully this should repair or replace any corrupt or missing system files. Tigger

It's been around since the boot-from-floppy days. Someone mentioned the need to do a backup. I do this twice a year (should do it more often) and my irreplaceable files, such as the pictures I've taken, are additionaly backed up onto a dvd and far away in my brother's safe.

I've had this happen with floppies, tapes, cds and dvds. I make 2 or 3 copies of data files and have not lost data. (YET!!!) But I have had to use all 3 copies to recover data, some files.

'what chkdsk is checking for is imperfections in this magnetic layer' Again I don't think so. One thing it is looking for is &quot;lost clusters&quot;, clusters that are marked as in use but they are not. Another thing it is looking at is the &quot;indexes&quot;. I could go on but I won't.
