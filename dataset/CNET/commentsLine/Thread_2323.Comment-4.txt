it probably would be a problem solved if i changed my graphics cards to two more modern ones that were somewhat guaranteed to work together to create a three monitor setup.
i wish i could.
i'm positive that there is a specific answer to the specific problem i'm facing with these ati cards.
that said, i appreciate your input.
