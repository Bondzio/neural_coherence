I'd hate to spend money on this idea.
It isn't as cool a thing when you can just throw money at a problem.
Sometimes it sucks all the creativity out of finding a solution.
That said, I've been thinking that it may be a good idea to pick up a late model dual video PCI card and add that to my system along side the dual DVI AGP card.
If that doesn't work, I'll return the new PCI card to the store and forget I ever hatched this tri-monitor egg.
