<s> I have an Acer 5050 running Windows XP SP2 that uses an internal Atheros wireless card. </s>
<s> When my computer first boots up, it starts off loading applications... but then when it gets to the part where the wireless network icon should popup.. the computer stops loading applications and freezes for about 30 seconds/one minute, and then all of a sudden starts loading again, starting with the network icon and everything else after. </s>
<s> My old computer did not do this... How can I fix it? </s>
<s> Thanks a million </s>
<s> You'll have to call it in. </s>
<s> I see some units do that. </s>
<s> Not a bug. </s>
