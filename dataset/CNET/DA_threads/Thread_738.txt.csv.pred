1.1.1	Hi , I recently built my own computer using the following parts .	St
1.1.2	Processor - AMD Phenom II X4 910 @ 2.6 Power Supply - http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16817339012 Graphics Card - ATI Geforce 9600 GSO 384mb Motherboard - http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16813135234 Heatsink & Fan - http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16835186030 Memory - http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx ? Item=N82E16820141300 HardDrive - 7200.11 Seagate Barracuda 160gb 1 120mm Case Fan Aimed At Processor 2 DVD drives and a front port Ok , so the computer has been working flawlessly for 7 months , with no problems .	St
1.1.3	Yesterday the computer shutdown when I left it on with a game running ( league of legends ?	Ques
1.1.4	) , and today it shutdown again with that same game running , I immediately booted into the BIOS to check the CPU temperature after the shutdown , and behold ... 120 C ! ! !	St
1.1.5	I immediately changed it to auto-shutdown at 70 c , and then opened the case to check whats wrong .	St
1.1.6	I touched the heatsink to see if maybe it was loose , but it burnt me , which means it has good contact ...	St
1.1.7	I touched the power supply and it was also EXTREMELY hot ...	St
1.1.8	The graphics card was cool .	St
1.1.9	As soon as I started it back up , everything started going back to normal , the CPU went down to 30c , with each core at about 20c , and the power supply started cooling down .	St
1.1.10	Now I do n't know what is happening , as I 've played much more demanding games without this problem ( crysis ?	Ques
1.1.11	) , this is the first time I 've built a computer ... Any thoughts ?	Ques
1.1.12	Because another one of these shutdowns and it would probably be time to say goodbye to the processor .	St
1.1.13	Any help would be appreicated , thanks !	Polite
1.1.14	P.S .	St
1.1.15	If it was the power supply not living up to the 550watts promise , would I be able to get a warranty on it ?	Ques
1.2.1	and watch the system and core temps as you use the PC .	St
1.2.2	How many case fans do you have running ?	Ques
1.2.3	Re the PSU.. would n't be on my pick list .. the 1 year warranty speak for itself .	St
1.2.4	Re the HS Fan ... . here 's some info that might be worth review .	St
1.2.5	http : //www.frostytech.com/articleview.cfm ? articleid=1922 & page=1 Let us know what you find .	St
1.2.6	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	Im like 1 and a half years late ...	St
1.3.2	But the case fan that I have pointed at the CPU was backwards , so it was working as an exhaust .	St
1.3.3	Anyways , 2 years and running strong , my computer is still newer than most ; D Not to mention cost only around 350 back then .	St
1.4.1	Get a new cooler	St
