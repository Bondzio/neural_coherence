but not the 7800 it's $600 and PCIE only please make sure your system's PSU can support it (if I remember correctly nVidia reccomended a ~450W PSU with 24A on the 12v rail) it is not an amazing performance increase over the 6800 series, and i'd like to note that if your not going for the absolute fastest system on earth don't get a 7800, as a 6800 series card is fine (Radeon X however is not, as it does not support SM3.0, ATi's new chip does though, and it's due in a few weeks) GeForce 6800 Vanilla and above would be fine as a card but i'd suggest a 6800GT or 6800 Ultra instead of a 7800GTX unless you have the money to spend/were saving for an expensive 6800 Ultra and NO a 512MB 6800 Ultra will NOT outperform a 7800GTX
