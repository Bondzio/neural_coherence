1.1.1	Howdy all , I live in a 3 apt house where we all share wireless from the 3rd floor apt .	St
1.1.2	It 's a DSL connection , over a G router .	St
1.1.3	I am on the bottom floor , and can not use my Skype phone , nor PS3 or Xbox .	St
1.1.4	I have run a 100ft Cat6 cable from the top apt to ours .	St
1.1.5	I would like to install an access point down here to use my Skype phone ( which has no port , only wifi ) , and wire my PC , and other stuff to the access point .	St
1.1.6	I have bought a Netgear WNR2000 ( recerted from Tigerdirect for $ 20 ) to serve as the access point .	St
1.1.7	My question is this : Should I use the N router as the access point to better serve my apt , or switch it for the G router upstairs and use the G router in my apt ?	Ques
1.1.8	Here are the two setups I 'm imagining : Modem wired to G router wired to N access Point which is wired to PC , 360 and PS3 , and wirelessly connected to Skype phone and Laptop .	St
1.1.9	Or ... Modem wired to N router wired to G access Point which is wired to PC , 360 and PS3 , and wirelessly connected to Skype phone and Laptop .	St
1.1.10	Intuitively , I feel like having the N right at the beginning of things would prevent a bottleneck , but I do n't know if because I am wiring it to the Access point if it matters .	St
1.1.11	Does the N or G matter if it 's an access point ?	Ques
1.1.12	Would I be better off getting another N router so the whole system is N ?	Ques
1.1.13	Also , if you need the Router model number , I can ask my neighbor and update .	St
1.1.14	Any thoughts ?	Ques
1.1.15	Thanks in advance !	St
1.1.16	Cheers , Alex	St
1.2.1	While I wonder why folk think N routers have better coverage ( my experience says no ) since you have all the parts why not try one setup and then the next ?	Ques
1.2.2	You may discover your first try to work well enough to forget retrying .	St
1.2.3	I had a WNR2000 ( gifted it to my brother ) and it 's an OK unit .	St
1.2.4	Just update the firmware .	St
1.2.5	As to setup , we cover that in the Cnet Networking Forum STICKY .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	If you hook an N and a G router together , you will limit yourself to G speed .	St
1.3.2	First , you can up the output power on your base to increase the range .	St
1.3.3	Check in your settings for the router .	St
1.3.4	If that is not enough you can get an amplifier for wireless , called bridge or repeater .	St
1.3.5	Put that at a midpoint where you get a good signal from your router .	St
1.4.1	As the previous poster said , yes , if you include wireless-g in the picture , you ca n't go any faster than wireless-g speed , which tops out at 54Mb/s .	St
1.4.2	And no , there 's nothing inherent in wireless-n that gives you better coverage ... however , the wireless-n router that I 've been using about a year now gives me much better coverage than the wireless-g router that I used to use .	St
1.4.3	Keep in mind that the higher the signal strength , the faster the router will go , for both wireless-g and wireless-n .	St
1.4.4	If the signal is only & quot ; fair & quot ; , then a wireless-g router will slow down to fit those conditions , and you 'll get considerably less than 54Mb/s .	St
1.4.5	For example , when we used wireless-g between our router and my daughter 's bedroom , the signal was only fair ( Linksys WRT54GS ) , and it ran fairly slow .	St
1.4.6	When I switched to wireless-n ( Netgear WNDR3700 ) , and the signal was excellent , the wireless speed was about 130Mb/s or so .	St
1.4.7	Very solid and fast enough for pretty much anything .	St
1.4.8	So it goes , you need a good router , and you 'll get a better speed connection with wireless-n for the same signal strength .	St
1.4.9	However , if there 's wireless-g anywhere in the network path , that limits the network connection to wireless-g speed .	St
1.4.10	-Roger	St
1.5.1	The setup I use is ethernet to connect the two .	St
1.5.2	This means that machines that connect to N get the full speed possible even where there is a G router that we did n't connect to with wifi .	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	Thanks for the replys all , unfortunately , I just found out that the upstairs neighbor 's router is also his modem , so there is no switching them .	St
1.6.2	So the set up will be my Netgear N rated router/AP wired by cat6 cable from his Westell G rated modem/router .	St
1.6.3	That will act as my hub for wired and wireless connections .	St
1.6.4	I 'm having some trouble configuring the Netgear to do anything it 's supposed to .	St
1.6.5	I turn off DHCP , and try to give it a subnet IP in the range of the westell but then I just lose connection to the Netgear .	St
1.6.6	I ca n't login to it with any IP .	St
1.6.7	I 'll try to figure it out for a few more days though , before I ask for help .	St
1.6.8	Thanks !	St
1.7.1	I think it 's post 18 or 19 of the Cnet Networking Forum sticky .	St
