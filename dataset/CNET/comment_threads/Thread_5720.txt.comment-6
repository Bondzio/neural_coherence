I know the timeout period is tweakable but here there is no issue since it times out, and continues when the printer is ready for the next page.
All without any input from us.
Maybe there is a problem here but I can't find it.
That is, if it works but drops some messages in the event viewer that could upset some admins but the problem is it works.
