Because my money is going into remodeling my place, I will not be able to afford a new system for a little time. It has a working floppy drive and 384M of RAM.

See FREECYCLE on google and ask for someone to donate you a free CD drive. Those type drives are worthless on the market when you find DVDRW drives on sale for 20 bucks.

Its going to make reloading the OS that much better and you'll need it anyways over time. The cost of a new CD drive is pretty cheap. if you can't do that a &quot;borrowed&quot; drive will do fine provided you have no CD issues. I have found used CD drives at the Goodwill and Sal. Army outlets, just be sure you get a later model. You can contact or get the &quot;floppy version for XP&quot; if still available to load that way, but this is a very drawn out process. Goto MS support and get the info about XP floppy install, but since you have HP or a provided OEM version of XP(I suspect), its an open question. Contact HP for any possible XP OS disks to load, but again for a small cost if still provided. XP is in itself an OS overshadowed by the Vista OS and HP may no longer provide certain support. tada -----Willy
