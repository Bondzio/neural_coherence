you need to do a complete de-install and remove all references to that printer.
then physically disconnect ptr.
and then reboot and allow it to finish.
once done, to a shutdown.
upon next reboot or power-up follow whatever instructions they're for the install, you may need to connect ptr.
now or later, just follow the instructions.
don't take anything for granted, if you haven't already get another lpt cable or swap port(s) if multiple ones.
if none of this fixes the problem, reload windows over itself, it won't change any setting but may reload os pgms.
required.
make sure to reload the system or mtrbd.
drivers from restore cd or driver cd after the os reload.
you haven't already visit the hp support website for clues, hints, tips on the topic.
they do supply some info its worth the visit, plus check for any newer drivers.
fyi - refilled ink carts can cause problems that are weird to understand.
take into account a refilled ink cart can be done so many times, before it has to be pitched, usually i consider 5-6 refills tops, then toss-out.
