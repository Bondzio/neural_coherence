<s> Which case should I buy? </s>
<s> There is the Praetorian 730 and the Antec P180. </s>
<s> I have researched both and they both seem like good choices. </s>
<s> I have recently found the Antec P180 at Provantage for under $130 with shipping, while NewEgg offers it for $157.72 with shipping, a rather large price difference for this case. </s>
<s> The Praetorian 730, no matter where one looks for it, is still $160+ with shipping. </s>
<s> Here are the two cases, both very attractive in my opinion. </s>

<s> Others have it for even less... $120 range... </s>
<s> Why pay so much for a case, when you can buy many good quality cases from $50 to $75? </s>
<s> Put the money in a nice video card or extra ram. </s>
<s> but since i always favor antec, i'd have to say that. </s>
<s> it has better airflow. </s>
<s> konny </s>
<s> I was planning on buying a $65 case, but the more expensive cases, generally, have better cooling, a quieter design, a non-flimsy design and overall much better looks. </s>
<s> I am probably going with the Antec. </s>
