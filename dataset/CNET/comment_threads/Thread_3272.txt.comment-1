I have an old Dell Inspiron 1501 which I love because it has Windows XP on it and I don't want to upgrade again.
However, I am unable to play many games and I just noticed that most of the games I have bought say it needs Pentium III or faster processor.
I can't figure out any of the information that I have looked at for the Turion processor but maybe it's not fast enough to play games?
How can I solve this problem?
Thanks for your help--Pups
