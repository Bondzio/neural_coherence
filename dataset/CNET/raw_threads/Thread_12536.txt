Don't know if related, but no tv signal in media center. All other feature in media center are fine. System actually reboots when I click around. MS/HP sites give no information. When XP SP2 upgraded, color changed from green color scheme to blue. Some additional features now show up. But, w/out TV - no record feature & thats primary reason for purchase. Advice? Heard of this? Could something else be the cause? Thanks
