I have had it for quite a while but its now really starting to get on my nerves. The internet drops out every time someone picks up or puts the phone down and the only way to get it back is to reboot the router, sometimes you have to do it about 5 times for it to work. This is especially annoying as it takes a couple of minutes to reboot and people use the phone quite a lot. I've tried changing the channels on the router but to no avail. Any ideas on how to fix this problem?

Proffitt	12/15/11 9:32 AM	1.32394152E12	Here's the tutorial.	http://www22.verizon.com/NROneRetail/NR/rdonlyres/E1B93F91-05C4-4030-87BE-F63083805277/0/Filters.swf This has nothing to do with computer literacy or wireless internet. It's a basic DSL setup issue I continue to encounter. Bob

7635	13	550403	5246425	5246424	R. Proffitt	12/15/11 10:00 AM	1.3239432E12	YOU SOLVED IT.	You have now found out why &quot;The internet drops out every time someone picks up or puts the phone down&quot; Now you know why. Bob

A DSL line used high frequencies for the data portion (see my tutorial here http://www.wayne2.net/dsl_course.htm ) of the DSL line. Note where the filters are placed and why. Wayne
