I bought CAT5e keystone jacks, assuming they would work (that and at the time I couldn't find CAT6 keystone jacks anywhere, so I just figured they were one in the same). I already opened the keystone jacks, so returning them is out of the question. Can I still wire a CAT5e keystone jack with CAT6 cable? Do you know where any wiring guides are? I can only find guides for wiring CAT5e into a keystone jack. Also, I don't understand this: on the keystone jacks, they have 2 options for wiring - 568A and 568B. What does that mean? I am under the assumption that one is straight through and the other is crossover, but if I'm wrong then please let me know.

Usually the 110 punchdowns are color coded so you shouldn't need any wiring guide. Just wire both ends according to one of the standards -568A or 568B. If you make a cable with 568A on one end and 568B on the other, you create a crossover cable. This isn't what you want.

I knew the jack would dumb the speed down to CAT5e, but I can always just spend $1.50 on new CAT6 keystone jacks later on, I just want SOME type of wired connection right now.

Well, thanks for helping me. I am actually using one of the cables for the internet connection right now! Now all I need is a gigabit router and some CAT6 keystone jacks and I'm ready to surf (as fast as my ISP allows, which is currently slower than CAT5e, but maybe some day . . . )

So you have to options: You can either buy a new keystone jack like: http://cablesinstock.com/cat6keystonejacks.aspx Or Stay with the Cat 5e for a little while but watch out. Sometimes I dont know why but once you keep the cable in this or any other configuration, the cable gets somehow used to it and sometimes latter on when you want to upgrade your wiring to the newer Category 6 style, you may have problem that the cables would not work. In this case I would recommend to completely change your wires for the brand new and your whole system will be working fine.

Using Cat5e jacks with Cat6 cable will indeed downgrade the link performance to Cat5e. But... The Category 5e standard was written to support Gigabit Ethernet (1000 Megabit). Even a very fast internet connection (at least here in the US) will only be about a 15 Megabit per second connection.
