<s> My Sony PCV_7764 Just beeps when i turn it on .Whats fried? </s>
<s> Is it one long beep , how many, eg... one beep two long? </s>
<s> Paul </s>
<s> Its a 1 sec beep that keeps going and going beep beep ect... As soon as you hit the power button and it starts to boot up it starts beeping and will not boot up at all.I think the hard drive is fried, all the fans are still working -Powers supply ,Processor cooling.Hope that helps </s>
<s> It could very well be a bad PSU which may have fried something else and\or bad ram , hard drive, motherboard. </s>
<s> The PSU may seem to be working but if not supplying correctly to a device, will cause this. </s>
<s> Can you get into CMOS? </s>
<s> Do you have a bootable cd disk or floppy? </s>
<s> Thanks, Paul </s>
<s> Can't get into cmos going to check PSU when neighbor gets done mowing lawn, got all the cd's hope and can get that far.Thanks Sam </s>
<s> Can't even get to CMOS, that isn't good and your hard drive shouldn't have anything to do with POST. </s>
<s> I won't say for sure it's a motherboard problem but it may be. </s>
<s> Your power supply is probably bad or has caused your motherboard to go goofy. </s>
<s> Just a guess though, let me know. </s>

<s> Paul thanks for your help while checking out the power supply and finding it good I checked out bios codes and it said check memory so i pulled the memory and as i was walking back to my house to get memory from my puter i noticed the memory had pissed off boyfriend idis.Seem's budda works tech support for the FAA and he took the memory stick out and bent it until it cracked a chip. </s>
<s> New memory and puter is back up and running.Thanks Sam </s>
