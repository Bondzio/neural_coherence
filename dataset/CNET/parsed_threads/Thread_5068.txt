<s> Cable is not digital. </s>
<s> It's an analog signal that carries digital information. </s>
<s> It's a common selling point, but a little investigation will reveal the truth. </s>
<s> Because of the bandwidth involved, a great picture can be received, and the leftover is available for internet. </s>
<s> But I digress. </s>
<s> Get the tuner card. </s>
<s> A good one can be had for under a hundred bucks. </s>
<s> Don't spend a load on an expensive card to view on a 17&quot; monitor, it's just not worth it. </s>
<s> Visit the better internet selling sites, shop around. </s>
<s> I like Buy.com and newegg.com. </s>
<s> There are others in abundance. </s>
<s> Do a Google search on tuner cards. </s>
