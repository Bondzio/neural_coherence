1.1.1	Recently I moved into my new student appartment and the only internet that was available was wireless .	St
1.1.2	I have a wireless BT hub at the only port in the house and then a linksys router by my PC .	St
1.1.3	By flashing the linksys router I was able to turn it into a receiver and so it goes straight into my network port in the back of my PC .	St
1.1.4	Out of 100 pings to the router from my PC I get about 6-10 which are in the range of 70-130ms .	St
1.1.5	The rest are either 1ms ( mass majority ) and 2ms .	St
1.1.6	This is causing me problems ingame as I get about 3-6 ping spikes a minute which interupts my play .	St
1.1.7	Anyone who can help ?	Ques
1.1.8	I 'm using WEP encrpytion , and the linksys model is a WRT54GL .	St
1.2.1	Sorry but no need to write again that WEP is dead and with a kiddie script you can be smacked down .	St
1.2.2	Move the security up one notch to WPA and read this forum 's sticky .	St
1.2.3	Again , I must be harsh on this .	St
1.2.4	I will not discuss WEP as it is dead .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	That 's a bit annoying really as I tried WPA and the latency was horrible ( 60-180ms ) between the router and receiver ... WEP seemed the fastest .	St
1.3.2	Despite the poor security .	St
1.4.1	However I always use our forum sticky settings .	St
1.4.2	Tell if you did something other than the forum sticky settings .	St
1.4.3	Again , WEP is not a solution as the kiddie tools swat the connection down and more .	St
1.4.4	But that 's been covered enough times .	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
