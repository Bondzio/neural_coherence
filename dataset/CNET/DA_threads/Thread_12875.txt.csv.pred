1.1.1	Hi , I currently have 2 services coming in both with internet access .	St
1.1.2	One is wired ethernet ( has a passworded proxy to get out to the internet , used for all local traffic ) the other is wireless straight into an ADSL modem so unrestricted internet access .	St
1.1.3	Currently everything is run through the ethernet solution and when I need un-firewalled access or am using an application that does n't support the passworded proxy I switch over to the wireless but lose all local connectivity .	St
1.1.4	Is there a way I can somehow route all of my local traffic in the 192.168.x.x range to the ethernet , and all the internet traffic ( even certain applications ) through the wireless connection ?	Ques
1.1.5	I would like to be able to work both locally as well as some apps on the unrestricted connection at once .	St
1.1.6	Opening firewall ports or adding an exception to the proxy is not an option .	St
1.1.7	I 'm open to ideas on Vista as well though prefer XP .	St
1.1.8	Cheers , M .	St
1.2.1	That 's not a feature of this OS and I must be blunt here that to use Linux to do this or other solutions you would n't be asking but doing so those are not a solution today .	St
1.2.2	So I must write no .	St
1.2.3	BOb	St
