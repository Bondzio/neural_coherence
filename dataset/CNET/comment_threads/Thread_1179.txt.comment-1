i have verizon DSL.
Their newest router, the westell 7500, and their older one, the westell 327w.
I want to setup a home network.
I have heard there is a way to have these 2 routers connect wirelessly (one threw the other) so that i can hook up direct tv dvr to the internet w/out running a long cable.
PLEASE help quickly!
