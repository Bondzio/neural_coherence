<s> Hello there, I put on my Imac a 2007 Intel based model/OSX 10.5 and even though I can tell the system is on as I can hear the start up and other sounds, the monitor is completely dark and I cannot see a thing. </s>
<s> Please help! </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Warranty period has passed. </s>
<s> Suggestions, please? </s>
<s> Apple Repair place and be prepared to pay a large amount of money. </s>
<s> This is not going to be cheap. </s>
<s> If it makes you feel any better, unplug everything from the Machine, including the power cable, leave it for 15 minutes. </s>
<s> Plug the keyboard, mouse and power back in. </s>
<s> Fire it up. </s>
<s> Any change? </s>
<s> No? </s>
<s> off to the Apple place then P </s>
<s> Unplug everything including power cord, hold power button for 5 seconds, then turn on the imac. </s>
<s> I have the same imac, and after a power outage, I have the same problem. </s>
<s> The 15 minute thing doesn't work for me, but holding the power button does. </s>
<s> I got tired of waiting for help and took the system for a looksee and they said it needed some sorta video/graphics card. </s>
<s> Anyway its repaired. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I shouldn't have to reset the smc every time the power goes out. </s>
<s> my video card might be on borrowed time. </s>
<s> Do you mind saying how much it cost for your new GPU? </s>
<s> in an earlier post. </s>
<s> Glad to see you took my advice P </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> If you had your GPU replaced for $293, that was really cheap. </s>
<s> Considering they had to replace the whole logic board, because the video card is integrated. </s>
<s> most people are quoted around a $1000, for that. </s>
