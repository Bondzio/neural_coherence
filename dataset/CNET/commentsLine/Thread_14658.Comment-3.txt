the key item may be the socket 478 mobo that still uses ddr memory.
i had a friend that hers zapped by a local lightning strike.
getting a decent replacement [non micro atx] is virtually impossible.
now that the conroe core and others came out, it's amazing how little the older ones are worth.
extremely valuable to the present owner and the darned think will probably run great for ten more years, but.
