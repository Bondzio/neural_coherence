I'm going to replace the battery soon enough, but was wondering if someone knows some of the things I should hit upon when manually restoring my BIOS settings. I'm got.... -Dell Dimension 8300 -winXP w/SP2 -IE6 - I believe my WD MyBook ext drive isn't working b/c of this battery issue, so is there something I should note in the BIOS for USB ports/settings . However, My other ext hd is working just fine -all my other USB plugged in accessories work fine thanks in advance

In general, thank goodness for online forums. Many manufacturer support sites either don't have the info posted or don't organize easy enough to find it through searches. Any1 else have any notes to mention concerning BIOS settings?

Don't bother messing with your external hard drives until you replace that battery. Those externals are sensitive enough as it is. If you have trouble finding a replacement, Radio Shack is pretty much guaranteed to have it.

Battery has been replaced and date and time reset. 2 followup Qs to what you posted... 1) Don't bother messing with your external hard drives until you replace that battery. Those externals are sensitive enough as it is. Can you elaborate on this? It sounds like the mobo battery going out on me caused my ext hd to stop working correctly. If you have any info on how this is true, I'd like to hear it. 2) just get the new Battery ASAP What are some of the worse things that can go wrong w/o having a working mobo battery?

I am saying that it is wise to eliminate a known issue (the bad battery) from your troubleshooting. 2. If motherboard battery goes, then BIOS settings could revert to default. Default BIOS settings can be different from desired/necessary hardware settings, including boot drives, memory timings, bus speeds, video card settings, USB ports, et al. Some of these can cause a POST failure. If you look in the Storage Forum, you will see many external hard drive problems. The way Windows (XP and others) interacts with external HD's is usually the problem and not a hardware failure of the external.
