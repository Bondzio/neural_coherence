Hello, my mother-in-law is now a widow and watches a lot of tv/movies etc. She has satellite for tv viewing, dvd/vcr etc. What I would like to get her is a media device that will play back .avi files that I can send her via USB stick. Mostly videos of her grand kids etc. Photos would also be good. Is there a unit that I can hook up for her to her LCD tv that can play home movies etc. ? The easier the menu scrolling to find content on the USB stick the better. She has a PC that she does not use. No Internet access where she lives. We use a USB wireless stick when there for access. I looked at a Western Digital unit about a year ago, but can't remember which one. Thanks!
