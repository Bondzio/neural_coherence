I have a similar issue with an ibook g3 not connecting or accepting my wpa password for my wireless network.
All other computers in my home accept it but this one and I have other macs.
I am not familiar with VPI & VCI could you be a little clearer for me and walk me through what you are suggesting so I can try to fix?
Thank you!
