your information at least gave me hope.
i only wish i knew how you would use the backup if you needed to.
i need to make a backup copy, format my hard drive and turn right around and copy the backup data to the hard drive.
i don't understand mr. proffitt's attitude.
i'm new here and maybe he thinks the community has more than enuf members and he's going to discourage me from ever coming back.
i'm not a newbie, but i have spent some time trying to figure out what people are saying.
i write for a newspaper and have kept one of three different computers working in my home office over the last 15 years or so, and a system for a newsroom running, although now that seems very primitive.
while proffitt doesn't think so, i am often complimented by bosses and readers for my ability to explain an issue, but you have to read it to understand it, not just assume you know what i wrote.
i deal with many professions that have their own jargon and it is my job to interpret that jargon and put it in plain english so readers of other professions can understand what is being said.
i'm going to get back to work on this thing in a few hours when one of the people who helped me will be back on line.
thank you so much, frank, for taking time to communicate with me.
ann
