for my vista pc.
at the moment i have the sound blaster live 24 installed... on my xp machine, it works great.
it comes with a suite of audio software that all works... but not so on my vista machine.
it installs, but not properly and few of the features are available to use.
i think it's a vista driver issue, but their website offers no relief.
i'm peed off and would like to say goodbye to creative and hello to some other replacement.
thanks for any suggestions...
