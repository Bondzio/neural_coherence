1.1.1	What kind of speeds should I expect transferring files over a completely wireless network?	St
1.1.2	My speeds are usually about 0.5 MB/sec and no more than 1.5 MB/s.	St
1.1.3	This makes it impossible to stream movies, etc, over networked PC's.	St
1.1.4	A little about my setup: I have a Buffalo Wireless Router, 2 Desktop PC's and 1 Laptop PC.	St
1.1.5	The Buffalo wireless router supports B/G networks and all of my network cards support B/G.	St
1.1.6	My wireless receivers on the PC are Buffalo and Microsoft.	St
1.1.7	No piece of hardware is older than about 18 months.	St
1.1.8	All PC's run Windows XP.	St
1.1.9	I also have a NAS device hooked up to the Buffalo router via ethernet cable.	St
1.1.10	My max speed between the wireless PC's/Laptop to the NAS Device is very similar (no more than 1.5 MB/s with the average being about 0.5 MB/sec) I have tried various wireless channels, WEP Encryption, WPA encryption, no encryption, forcing &quot;G&quot; mode, Forcing &quot;B&quot; mode, Buffalo's default firmware, &quot;Tomato&quot;'s firmware, various MTU settings, signal boost mode, normal mode, factory default settings, etc I have also tried replacing some hardware and introduced a D-Link brand receiver and also tried my older Netgear MR814 Wireless Router.	St
1.1.11	None of these tests have resulted in faster speeds.	St
1.1.12	I do not have any wireless devices that should interfere with the wireless signal (cordless phone, etc) and have sat 2 inches away from the wireless router with my laptop to rule out interference from other devices\appliances, etc.	St
1.1.13	What really drives me nuts is I have seen speeds max out at ~ 10 MB / sec when downloading data straight from the internet using the same routers and PC's.	St
1.1.14	So is this the max?	St
1.1.15	What speeds should be possible while transferring between machines on a wireless LAN?	St
1.1.16	Why is this SO much slower than transferring files over the net??	St
1.1.17	Help!	St
1.2.1	When you use WIFI it's &quot;shared&quot; with everyone that is on the airwaves.	St
1.2.2	That's the first reason for it slowing down.	St
1.2.3	Not only you but those next door may be on your channel.	St
1.2.4	Next, it's only &quot;half duplex&quot; which cuts the speed again.	St
1.2.5	Finally you may be using some USB 1.1 port or you may have other bottlenecks.	St
1.2.6	I rarely see much past a few megabytes per second simply because the link speed is (pay close attention here) is all of 54 megabits a second.	St
1.2.7	That roughly translates to 5.4 megabytes and then it gets worse as we add &quot;packaging&quot;, the half duplex and more.	St
1.2.8	You should top out at about 1/2 or 2.x MB per second if everything was just right.	St
1.2.9	CNET had a nice article about networking and part of the lesson was to get wired what can be wired.	St
