So after recently purchasing an HP d4100y, online at HPshopping.com, and having the motherboard go in less than 24hrs I am reluctant to buy another HP.
If I do I've decided to buy one from a local retailer so if something like this happens again I don't have to deal with the wait and hassle of shipping it back.
Anyway, while browsing in this weeks Sunday paper I saw essentially the same computer I bought, except in a Gateway box, advertised at Circuit City and Best Buy for about $350 less and it came with a printer, an extra DVD drive and XP Media Center, rather than XP Home which was what I had in the HP I'm sending back.
My question is, is one store better than the other in regards to their return policy or any other aspects?
What about their in-store extended service plans.
Are they worth looking into?
The computer I'm thinking about buying is the Gateway 835GM with a 17''LCD, and a Canon IP1500 printer for $999.
