<s> My wife purchased a Dell desktop system from Best Buy last year (May 2009). </s>
<s> The monitor died on it earlier this summer. </s>
<s> Apparently, Dell's &quot;3-year warrantee&quot; on monitors does not extend to monitors purchased with entire systems, they only carry the one year warrantee that the tower has. </s>
<s> First of all, a one year life expectancy on a monitor is a tad short. </s>
<s> Second, not honoring the typical warrantee extended to monitors purchased separately is poor business practice. </s>
<s> Lastly, if this is the sort of support I can expect from Dell, I'll likely not be purchasing another computer through them... either for personal use, or through the university at which I'm employed. </s>
<s> Consider that you can buy an external hard drive with a one year warranty but the drive inside the case may be the same one that carries a three year warranty if you buy it separately. </s>
<s> Bundling is about making the total price look more attractive but it does come with a downside. </s>
<s> Warranties are not free either. </s>
<s> The probability of failure and the cost to cover such is computed in the same way insurance actuaries work and that cost is built into your purchase price. </s>
