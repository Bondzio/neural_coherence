i asked shirt pocket software about this.
here is the reply: &quot;...wd external drives do not support startup on power pc macs, ed.
that's one reason we never recommend them...&quot; that is interesting and i wish i had known earlier.
recall, however, that i actually have a wd drive that starts up my wife's imac (power pc, 2004 vintage).
