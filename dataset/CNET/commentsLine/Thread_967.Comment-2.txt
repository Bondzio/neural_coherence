i have a network setup in my house using a netgear wireless n router.
i have a new dell desktop with windows 7 hardwired to the router and a canon printer connected by usb to that computer.
i have a laptop with vista and am trying to get that to to print wireless to the canon printer.
when trying to print from the laptop i get a message which says that the print drivers can not be found on the laptop.
do i need the drivers installed on the laptop if the print is connected to the desktop?
