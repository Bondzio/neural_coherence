when i first started looking at a wireless network, i hit the compusa, talked with a salesman, went home, read a bunch of stuff on the internet and then wondered to google and read a lot.
i ended back at compusa and got a personal demonstation.
i walked out with a belkin f5d7230-4 &quot;g&quot; wireless router.
installation was a breeze and setting up everything next to nothing.
with 4 computers on the network (desktop and three laptops) it is important for the family to be able to access the printers, drives, et cetera on the other computers.
in addition, when it comes to maintenance issues such as adware, virus checking, being able to do it from one main computer is a plus.
i have zonealarm with antivirus on each machine and have each machine set to run scheduled maintenance.
however, being able to control it all on the fly from one machine is a big plus.
anyway, the &quot;g&quot; router has worked flawlessly for me and handles the load with no problems.
the kids on the desktop doing their games, me with my word processing, the wife with her surfing, not a problem at all.
i though wanted to increase my range and after reviewing the options available, i went with the belkin pre-n - and after installing it, i have been pleased with it.
i discovered it best to uninstall the previous router drivers before installing the pre-n system.
i also added a pre-n card to my personal laptop and that was a trip - two hours before the system came anything close to being stable.
i now have great range, great speed (approaching the desktop's speed and the desktop is a high-end machine).
my only concern is will the pre-n be viable when the new standard is out.
my wife says i shouldn't care, i'll buy the new stuff anyway.
