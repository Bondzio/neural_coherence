Hey !
Thanks for the website however i do already know about Macam... My webcam (logitech SPhere old model -i believe 2006-) doesn;t work with such app.
not supported yet.
If they update the software with the driver for my webcam before i have the money to buy an iSight, I'll probably keep my Sphere.
