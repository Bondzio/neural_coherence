It seems to have less glare than the nexus 7&quot; tablet. But, I can't figure out how to get files from my camera onto the Nook without doing it via computer. When I'm on the road, I don't want to take the computer, I want to take the nook. The Canon G1X camera uses a regular size SD card, and the Nook HD as a micro sD card reader. The camera does have a/v out and hdmi, which I could probably hook up to the nook via adapters but I don't know if the nook will be able to read the files or recognize them so I could save them onto the nook. The nook has a proprietary usb cable which I could hook into a card reader/adapter, but again, I don't know if the software exists on the nook to recognize and manage the files. Any suggestions? thanks.

My nook color as well as the nook hd have a microsd slot. So you can check out http://bookclubs.barnesandnoble.com/t5/NOOK-Color-General-Discussion/Wireless-pix-fr-camera-to-NC-Eye-Fi/td-p/1345782 It appears you can see the pictures of standard JPEG. Sorry but I don't have the Nook HD so I can't do more here. -&gt; Parting comment. If support is that bad they can't answer your questions, why are you considering their product? Bob
