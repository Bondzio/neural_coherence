1.4.1	If the OSX is dates it can't see the NTFS (file system) and files.	St
1.4.2	Current versions can see NTFS volumes just fine.	St
1.4.3	There is also other solutions like having a friend with a PC copy then out to DVD or another HDD.	St
1.4.4	I've used Linux (Ubuntu to be specific) to connect 2 HDDs, one in NTFS and the other in AFS and drag the files over.	St
1.4.5	MacFUSE is worth some research if your OSX is outdated.	St
