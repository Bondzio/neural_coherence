if your router has a mirror/monitor option then you can do that but most consumer routers do not.
first you need a packet capture program and a pc you can leave running to capture it.
wireshark is your best bet since its free and works very well the harder problem will be getting into the data stream.
a old hub if they still make those would work between the router and the dsl modem.
they make real ethernet taps but they are rather expensive.
the most common way to do this is with a switch that has the ability to &quot;mirror&quot; traffic.
you will need a switch is manageable ie 'you can log into'.
they are some consumer ones but the cheapest way to buy a old cisco or 3com on ebay.
even the very old switches can do this.
you still have the issue of knowing which traffic is valid and which is not.
all traffic will appear to come from the address on the router so it will be more difficult to know if it is your traffic or your intruders traffic.
to a point it will be obvious if they are visiting sites you do not.
