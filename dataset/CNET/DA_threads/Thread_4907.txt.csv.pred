1.1.1	Hi I just ordered a new computer, and was curious if I would be able to add my old video card to the system and have both cards work together.	St
1.1.2	I have found a fair amount of conflicting information about it and am not clever enough to know of my own intuition.	St
1.1.3	The new system comes with a NVIDIA GeForce 9800 GT over-clocked video card that I believe fits into a PCI-E x16 slot.	St
1.1.4	The older card is a PNY XLR8 GeForce 8800 GT 512MB, and made for just a normal PCI-E slot.	St
1.1.5	Is it possible to make these two work together, or am I wasting my time on a foolish pursuit?	St
1.2.1	you can only run dual pci-express x16 cards in a motherboard with dual x16 slots.	St
1.2.2	and for sli, you'd need two nvidia cards of the same type.	St
1.2.3	since your cards are different, it won't work regardless of if your mobo supports sli.	St
1.3.1	I think Sli'ing GPU's is similar to RAM, It needs to be in pairs and you need an Sli motherboard.	St
