more often than not is the result of unrecoverable memory errors which could be due to the dimms or the memory controller in the amd.
have you tried reseating the dimms and, since you have 3gb, tried operating only with the 2gb stick?
if you are close to a computer store, get a known good dimm to verify.
forget repair services...a generic version of the mcp61p is about $50 but the back i/o may be slightly different...and replacing the mobo yourself means dealing with vista re-activation...not impossible but not everyone likes dealing with it.
if the recovery partition is corrupted, ask hp to ship you vista oem (not recovery) cds.
if you don't like messing with hardware, replace the pc.
for value, a new pc with w7 and better cpus than the 9500 can't be beat.
good luck.
