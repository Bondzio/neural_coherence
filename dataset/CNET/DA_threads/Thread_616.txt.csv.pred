1.1.1	I will be going home soon , after finishing up a several year job I 'm in .	St
1.1.2	So , I 've been trying to plan out how I am going to have the same setup I have now , with tv , ps3 , xbox , printer , network storage , etc etc .	St
1.1.3	All I have now is a wireless router , with all ports ( 4 ) being used , and a lot of things using wireless .	St
1.1.4	Going home , there will be even more on the network ( families computers and such ) , so I came up with an idea.. if the idea works .	St
1.1.5	I 'm no networking expert , however I will be going to school to learn .	St
1.1.6	Anyway , my plan if possible is this.. ISP - Switch - 1st port to my families wireless router , and a 2nd port to my wireless router , and each in their own vlan to separate them completely from each other .	St
1.1.7	I 'll will only use those 2 ports on the switch .	St
1.1.8	And I will connect everything I have to only my router , and the rest of the family can use just their router .	St
1.1.9	Is this possible ?	Ques
1.1.10	Or am I way off ?	Ques
1.1.11	And if I am right do you have any suggestions for home-use switches ?	Ques
1.1.12	Thank you for your help in advance .	St
1.2.1	As you will need a second internet IP it usually doubles the monthly fees .	St
1.2.2	You could do like me and set up your & quot ; router as a WAP & quot ; ( see google ) and connect a LAN port on the first router to the LAN port of the second router to get your own WiFi .	St
1.2.3	WiFi gets clogged up fast so why not your own ?	Ques

1.3.1	If both routers were having all their ports used , would this be an easy/correct setup ?	Ques
1.3.2	ISPs Modem & gt ; Uplink Port of Wired Router & gt ; Port 1 and Port 2 of Wired Router to Uplink Ports for the Two Wireless Routers ?	Ques
1.4.1	I would not do that setup .	St
1.4.2	But as you thought it through what will happen , why not ?	Ques
1.4.3	That is , any setup you want can be done if you want it to .	St
1.4.4	But here I go with setups we use and support .	St
1.4.5	I do n't see how that setup would be easy .	St
