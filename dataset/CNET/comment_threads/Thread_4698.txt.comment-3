Ok good to know my drive is ok.
I've checked into those links and most seem to suggest a repair install of XP.
However, here's what's happening now....
I boot off of the xp cd, ignore the first option to repair, it detects my previous install which i then tell it to repair.
Once i do this, it copies all the files and reboots my machine but when the machine comes up nothing happens.
Nothing boots, setup does not continue.
Ideas?
