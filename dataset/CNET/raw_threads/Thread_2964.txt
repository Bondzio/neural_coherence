I use the exact same display settings on both monitors. Additionally, I tried playing with the settings on the suspect monitor and it doesn't seem to help the problem at all. Below are links to two pictures of the problem. These aren't the best photos in the world, but hopefully they help. The monitor in question is the one on the right. http://www.southernopp.com/1.jpg http://www.southernopp.com/2.jpg Thanks! Troy

This is why you want to replace these with LED back lit displays when they have grown old. I will not write word one about any monitor settings. Bob

Link.	http://benchmarkreviews.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=168&Itemid=68&limit=1&limitstart=6 is worthy reading since it shows how CCFL and some displays are less than perfect in the lighting. Now we have to ask how much is a perfect display? I think we need to look at BARCO displays to see how much this could cost. Bob
