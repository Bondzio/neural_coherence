If I can't solve this, I'll go back to SP1. Please Help!!

When I want to close something like svchost.exe which is a LOCAL SERVICE, or alg.exe another LOCAL service, or when IE gets frozen, and I want to quit it using the processes tab, the warning tab appears.

Since killing svchost is incorrect from the gitgo, it would be proper for all versions of XP to logout or reboot if you killed it. Do a deeper inspection with the command line tool called TASKLIST (I won't write deeply about this since you can research with google.com.) Next look at the output of TASKLIST /SVC to see what called svchost. Nothing appears amiss here that a little more knowledge can't cure. Bob

Thanks for the suggestion, but there are always other non-system processes running that I'd like to close, like iPodservice.exe, launchapplication.exe, and others. In SP1, when I close those network or local services, no rebooting or anything occurs.

Aside from the net stop, another idea is to see what is configured to run at startup and possibly stop some of those from starting in the first place. Regards, JB

If you really like it, get CachemanXP for $25... its more sophisticated and has a great process viewer.

13309	13	177617	1953637	1952611	ramarc	5/22/06 6:31 PM	1.14832266E12	i've used cacheman (&quot;free&quot; version) for about 5+ years	in the era of 1gb PC's it's not really needed anymore, but it does make a BIG difference with 256MB machines. much less swapping and it gives a simple interface to tweak the cache behavior (instead of regedit fiddling). windows loves caching EVERYTHING even if its to the detriment of new/on-demand memory needs. with the default parameters, the system cache can eat up all free ram, causing any mem allocations (like for the menu item you just opened or the new program you just launched) to cause pagefile access. since it's &quot;free&quot; you (and the poster) have nothing to lose.

I could only guess that cacheman was freeing up the memory and Word would have to reload from disk. Same story for 1GB machines. Again, only my experience that it's a miss. Bob
