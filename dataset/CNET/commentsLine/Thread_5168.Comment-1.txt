i use kaspersky internet security 2009 which has its own firewall.
am i safe to disable the firewall in my belkin wireless router since i have the other firewall with kaspersky?
i think that the router is blocking ports that programs like itunes needs in order to allow d/ls (thats at least what im hearing from them that the reason for all my problems is) thanks for any help.
