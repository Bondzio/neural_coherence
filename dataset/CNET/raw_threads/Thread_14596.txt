I use dial-up from one computer and do not have broadband cable or DSL nor am I really interested in getting either in the near future. I just got a Wi-Fi capable laptop and thought I'd get acquainted with Wi-Fi access to my wired network. My first thought was getting a Wireless Access Point, say a Linksys WAP54G, but now I'm confused. A router, say a Linksys WRT54G, *SEEMS* to have more functionality - 1) a WAP 2) a Hub - with 4 Ethernet ports (???) 3) a cable/DSL router for *LESS MONEY*, as opposed to a WAP with only 1 Ethernet port. Am I missing something ??? Can I really replace a wired hub with the WRT54G and get wired hub functionality AND wireless access to my wired network ? Thanks in Advance

If not router, the the combo router/wap costs less. I'm using a 37 dollar dlink (WifiG) from compgeeks for now so I wonder how much cheaper you can go. Bob

Just checking - so I can replace a wired hub with a, say Linksys WRT54G, router (even tho I currently use dial-up and won't use broadband or DSL access; the wired network is only used basically for back-ups) and will be able to 'talk' to the other wired hub and all other wired computers via wirewless from my new Wi-Fi enabled laptop via the router ? Regards, Tom

You would setup ICS (or such) on a host machine, then run that host's ethernet to some switched hub and then wire an ethernet WAP to the switched hub. Sorry if I missed you were on dialup. Bob

For now, I'm perfectly content with dial-up. And for now I would only want to use the router as a hub for my wired network and as a WAP to connect my new Wi-Fi enabled laptop wirelessly to since I basically just use the wired network now for backups. But 'down the road' I would still have the router functionality once I decide to get broadband cable or DSL. (Re dial-up Internet access: For 'grins', I occasionally run PCAnywhere 'host' on one computer to connect to the Internet and then browse from another PCAnywhere 'client' computer via the wired network. Kludgey and not exactly super fast, but it works ! Of course, until I get broadband cable or DSL, I'll probably also want to try this wirelessly for 'grins.') Many thanks, Tom
