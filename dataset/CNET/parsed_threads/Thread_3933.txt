<s> I dropped it and now there is no LED indicator light lighting up. </s>
<s> And it will not show up in My Computer. </s>
<s> I managed to strip it down to this. </s>
<s> http://i.imgur.com/p145A.jpg So the first thing I notice is that this chip is loose. </s>
<s> http://i.imgur.com/CyP4C.jpg And on the underside, it has 4 metal contacts, so we know that it goes there in that missing spot. </s>
<s> http://i.imgur.com/FG87J.jpg However, it could orient either way, and I've tried holding it there myself and plugging it in, but to no avail. </s>
<s> So, now I'm stuck here. </s>
<s> I really need to recover this.Thanks. </s>
<s> It's a pity you tried yourself. </s>
<s> A specialized data recovery company would have done better, and it might be more expensive now than it would have been if you hadn't started yourself. </s>
<s> Anyway, a USB-stick should - exactly like a floppy 15 years ago - be considered as a good means to move data between computers. </s>
<s> Not as permanent storage, and certainly not as a good place to store the only copy of some data. </s>
<s> So - for everybody following that simple rule - no data is ever lost by a failed drive and there's no need at all for any expensive recovery. </s>
<s> Let's hope you fall in that category. </s>

<s> Minor detective work , I would see what defacing the solder pads look like and match them. </s>
<s> Use a magnifying glass and notice the solder pattern, because they would fit. </s>
<s> However, how you solder it back is another issue. </s>
<s> The proper tech way is find PIN 1 of solder area, it may have the #1 to ID it and the chip has a #1 or indent, dot, hollow or/on chip form, then match and resolder. </s>
<s> Because, this is SMC stuff, it can be hard to do w/o proper tools, so you're left at the mercy of your skills. </s>

<s> Well this is very small, and there's not really &quot;pins&quot;. </s>
<s> Its more like small flat squares that are metal. </s>
<s> I probably wont be able to solder this. </s>
<s> Because Im terrible at soldering. </s>
<s> If you have access to forceps or small vise grip pliers, and knowing ordination of chip, try this as last resort. </s>
<s> Using maybe small wood/leather pads in order to NOT smash chip, apply to flash drive and clip on the pliers using just necessary force to keep it from moving. </s>
<s> Use a USB cable too extend the flash drive away from the port and allow ease of access. </s>
<s> The constant contact may allow access to data if that's all it is, chip off pcb. </s>
<s> You can apply a micro-drop of super glue with toothpick, again if ordination is known to keep chip in place, but apply pliers quickly before it sets. </s>
