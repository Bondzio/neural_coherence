1.1.1	I'm in the process of upgrading my home network.	St
1.1.2	One of my big things is external storage.	St
1.1.3	I've been looking at some of these external HD's that can be connected to a network by ethernet.	St
1.1.4	Are these any better than, say, a USB external HD?	St
1.1.5	Are they used only for storage or could I install software there as well?	St
1.2.1	Even at 100BT speeds it seems some 1/4 the speed of USB drives.	St
1.2.2	And USB 2.0 drives seemed 1/2 the speed of IDE drives.	St
1.2.3	The units work but some will not like the speed.	St
1.2.4	Since the units I've used can be mapped to a drive letter, software could be put there but the speed loss would have me switching to dial up.	Ques
