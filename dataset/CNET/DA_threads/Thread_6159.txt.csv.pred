1.1.1	I have a Wi-Fi booster that can connect to remote distance networks, and I want to share the Wireless Networks that the booster connects to all the local computers in its range (maybe in Ad-Hoc?).	St
1.1.2	The computer that has the booster has it's own separate built-in Wi-Fi.	St
1.1.3	Is this possible?	St
1.1.4	For example, the booster gets a signal from Wi-Fi network A, and I want Network A to be broadcast to the computers who can't receive Network A's signal.	St
1.1.5	I really don't mind how this is done, preferably without having to buy new hardware.	St
1.2.1	My old setup at the farm was to place a WiFi BRIDGE on the window sill and then run that to a common WiFi router.	St
1.2.2	I might use post 19 in the CNET NETWORKING FORUM STICKY to aid in such a setup.	St
