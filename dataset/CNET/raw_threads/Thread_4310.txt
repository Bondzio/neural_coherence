After both of these were replaced, I can no longer get a internet connection through my router. If the cable is just hooked up to the PC, it works fine. But if I hook it up to my router, I don't have a connection. I have replaced the router and am still having this problem. The modem cable modem is working properly, and all my connections to the router are correct. Right now, I'm running on a Belkin Wireless G Router. I also have a Linksys Wireless G router as well. I am running on Windows XP. Does anyone know what could be causing this? Thanks!

ON ROUTER: Turn on SSID broadcast on the router. Turn off all encryption. Turn off MAC filtering. Now try to connect. Results? Wireless network adapter is wireless-g? Wireless router is set to wireless-g?
