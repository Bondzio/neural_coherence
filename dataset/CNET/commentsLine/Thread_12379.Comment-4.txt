as bob indicates, migrating scanners to new os can be very problematic.
first check the hp site and see if they have drivers for the scanner for your new os which you did not mention.
if they do, download them and move on to aquiring a pci scsi host adapter or something like the usb to scsi-2 adapter cable offered at cables to go (you can locate similar adapters at various prices by other manufacturers) or a scsi to parallel port adapter jeff's suggestion to browse ebay for a host adapter is good too because even old scsi host adapters are not cheap.
here is one place where you can sometimes find older adapters cheap -  once you have found one do not be too upset if it doesn't work with your particular scanner because scsi can be very &quot;picky&quot;.
check the manufacturer of your old host and chances are that a host made by them that can be fitted to your new compter will work.
bob's suggestion of retaining your old computer and keeping the scanner atached to it for use is probably the cheapest and most certain of success.
good luck.
