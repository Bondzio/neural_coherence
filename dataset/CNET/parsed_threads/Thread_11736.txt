<s> Hello, I would like to buy a Dell Ultrasharp 1905FP 19&quot; TFT monitor, but unfortunately my video card is an old NVidia GeForce2 MX 400 which doesn't have a DVI connector. </s>
<s> Has anyone tested these two together? </s>
<s> How is the image and text quality like when the monitor is connected via the analog input? </s>
<s> Thanks, Vasile </s>
<s> I have the same setup as you. </s>
<s> Dell Dimension 8100 series, pentium 4 1.5gHz 256mg pc800 rdram, running windows XP with same video card. </s>
<s> I would like the same question answered and if we need to upgrade the video card before getting the 19&quot; flat panel. </s>
<s> I am looking at the same flat panel also. </s>
<s> Let me know if you find a great price and have you seen the panel in person. </s>
<s> I live 120 miles from the nearest dell store where I could view such a monitor. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>

<s> Hello Roy, have you had the chance to see the Dell Ultrasharp 1905FP in store? </s>
<s> If yes, what is your feeling about this monitor? </s>
<s> How is the image quality? </s>
<s> Are the corners little blurred? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
