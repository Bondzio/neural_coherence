Dear Bob, My point is that I own and control the ASUS WL-700gE and would like to use it without any need to make changes on the work laptops.
I fail to understand what my bona fide quuestion has to do with forum policies.
Since I am using my work laptop via VPN it would be detrimental to mess around its setup in any way.
I hope someone can help me with this.
