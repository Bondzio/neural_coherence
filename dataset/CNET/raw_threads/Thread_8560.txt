I am planning on upgrading my pc, and need to know what I would need to be able to use it as a DVR, preferably with HD capability. I have digital cable (Comcast) coming into the house. The current PC configuration is OLD!!!!! and slow. About the only thing I may be able to salvage is the keyboard and case/powersupply. I am currently running an old ASUS motherboard with an AMD Athlon 800 mHz cpu with 512 mb ram and XP-Pro. I have a generic 256mb graphics card with no TV reception. I built this computer years ago as a project just to see if I could do it. Now I want more! I was thinking a 2gHz processor, a gig of ram, and an LCD monitor would do the trick. I have a small 60gb hdd, and I suppose I will have to increase that too. I would like to be able to record from the cable line (or digital box if necessary) onto the hard drive and then transfer to dvd, if possible. I know a little about assembling a computer(enough to be dangerous), and I'm not afraid to try things, but I know very little about video. Any specific suggestions on hardware would be appreciated(i.e. motherboard/cpu combo, video capture card, dvd recorder, etc). Brezzio

These are not pay-per-view channels. Will I be able to record them? Is there any software/hardware available that will allow me to record them without having to rent another cable box?

14869	5	277815	2667203	2667135	ramarc	1/1/08 11:51 AM	1.19918826E12	if the channels are on a digital tier, no	the digital tier is not 'free'. so you won't be able to record hd programs that require you to have a digital cable box.

Simply put, yes, you can turn your old computer into a DVR with a lot of work, and yes, you will be able to record most of your channels, but it will only be in 480i (STDV) or 720p (HDTV) depending on the channel, and you will not be able to record any channels that require a CableCARD (i.e. DiscoveryHD, HBO|HD, etc). Basically, when you put together the system, make sure your TV Tuner card supports ASTC (digital broadcast), and simply try out your channels. Some will work, some won't. I wish you luck. -Launchpad_72 aka IAmTheDonut

The Media Center application is one of the best out there, with built-in ASTC (digital) support and DVR functionality. Plus, it will support almost any TV tuner card out there. (Just be sure to grab either a 32-bit copy, or a USB-based TV card, as 64-bit OSes almost never work with internal TV Tuner cards.) -Good Luck Launchpad_72 aka IAmTheDonut
