asus p3-p5g33 it comes with a 220w power supply and a low-profile heatsink/cooler that exhausts hot air out the side vent.
it can acommodate everything you've mentioned but it does get a bit loud with cpu-intensive activity.
these asus barebones are getting hard-to-find however so you may want to look into msi's alternative.
also consider getting a western digital &quot;green&quot; drive (5400-7200rpm adjustable).
if you want to stick with a mini-itx combo, any unit with a 250w power supply will be adequate.
(dell studio slim pc uses a 250w power supply for a q9550 quad core.)
as for upgrading to a better video card, you won't find many that are low-profile and you'll have to measure the power supply of your case to determine what replacement alternatives you have.
there is no mini-itx power supply standard size.
