1.1.1	I have to replace my GeForce 7500LE because of a noisy fan in a HP pavillion Desktop d4790y running Vista home Premium , is there a better more powerful graphics card compatable with vista for gaming ?	Ques
1.2.1	http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card,2404-2.html and the under 99 buck class should eclipse the old card .	St
1.2.2	Be sure to watch for power supply requirements .	St
1.3.1	Thanks for alerting me to power ... i have discovered my unit is 350 watts but when i look at the cards they really dont state thier power demands ... deffinently wont buy till im sure	St
1.4.1	But take notes about the cards and find the maker 's web pages on them .	St
1.4.2	If you find a card then post a link about it in the forum and maybe some member will look it up , hunt it down or comment they own it and put a Watt meter on it .	St
1.4.3	For example I used some PCI Nvidia 9500 512MB video card and in the machine with the Watt meter it tops out at 120 Watts .	St
1.4.4	The PSU is 350 Watts so at less than half the PSU 's rating I do n't fret about it .	St

1.5.1	after reading all my mind can handle on graphics cards and psu from manufactures sites to reviews on cnet and other sites , the questions sticking me are ... . what would get me the best benefits , upgrading from nvidia 7500 le to a card for around a $ 80- $ 120 that works with-in my PSU ( 350w ) , or for around $ 220 upgrading both PSU ( to 500w-750w ) and GPU .	St
1.5.2	Are there any draw backs to raising the psu in a system ?	Ques
1.5.3	Would the extra bucks really get me a bigger bang ?	Ques

1.7.5	Try tidying up the wiring when your in there .	St
