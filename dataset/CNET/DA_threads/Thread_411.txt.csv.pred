1.1.1	If I were to set a pin on the parallel (or serial) port from &quot;1&quot; to &quot;0&quot; and back to &quot;1&quot; as fast as possible, how fast of a strobe would this create?	St
1.1.2	What my goal is, is to do a sort of pulse width modulation (pwm) though this.	St
1.1.3	in more detail i want to generate a DCC (digital command control) signal, as it is used in the model railroad.	St
1.1.4	I would need to alternate &quot;1&quot; and &quot;0&quot; states either every 116 microseconds or 232 microseconds.	St
1.1.5	depending on the limitations I would consider researching real time systems, although in my scenario I might not have to.	St
1.2.1	The speed is set by your computer and is not standardized.	St
