Tried the following things, no sucess: 1- A different monitor. 2- Changed the VGA/DVI cable.. 3- Different graphics card 4- Different HD 5- Memory sticks 6- Different CPU 7- All cables Can't even see the POST. Noting on the screen, no beep. Nothing. When I turn the computer on, the mouse and keyboard lit up. Even cleared the CMOS according to Intel's support. The MoBo is a Intel D945GNT/D945PSN. I appreciate any help.

Here is the solution for those of you you might have this problem. ------------------- REMOVE YOUR POWER CORD AND HOLD THE ON BUTTON FOR LIKE 30second TO A MINUTE AND THEN CONNECT IT BACK AND TURN IT ON. ------------------- At first, I thought it was the MoBo. When I read this post on a different website, I thought it will never work! Believe me, it worked!! I was looking at the monitors light going from red to blue! Now I have my computer back and running!! No idea why it worked that way, but hey! I works!!
