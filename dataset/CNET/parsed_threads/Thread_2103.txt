<s> I really appreciate all the useful information in the recent discussion about external USB Hard-Drives. </s>
<s> I have several and while I never rely on just one copy of my stuff anywhere, I do like the convinience of using these devices. </s>
<s> I am curious though, about the differences, if any worth mentioning, of using one of those cheap &quot;enclosures&quot; that accept an internal 2-1/2 or 3-1/2 inch drive. </s>
<s> I have already had one that wasn't cheap just die on me. </s>
<s> So, I picked up a real cheap plastic dock that allows you to just slide the HD in a slot on the top. </s>
<s> Really handy for quick changes and testing. </s>
<s> I dropped in the HD that I had in the external enclosure that failed and was able to read and copy from it instantly. </s>
<s> I have to wonder whether there is a known problem with these kinds of devices and if I should phase them out of use in my multi-drive back-up ritual. </s>
<s> They seem like they do the same thing but after having a good one just quit, I am a little leary. </s>
<s> anything ... it depends on use, handling, quality, etc., If you insert them and remove them constantly .... quality and durability really count. </s>
<s> If you leave them in place but power off the drives when not in use, that reduces wear and tear on the device connectors. </s>
<s> Good quality frames and removable drive trays should last a good long time and serve you well with careful use and handling. </s>

<s> ...to be good to my electronics. </s>
<s> The one that failed on me was a good quality Aluminum enclosure called Enermax by Laureate. </s>
<s> But it doesn't even have a model number on it so it's not that great. </s>
<s> I had a good Hitachi SATA 80 drive in it and I used to use it as part of my backup routine. </s>
<s> I never had to touch a cable as I would do as you said and just &quot;turn it on&quot; by pressing a power button when ever I wanted to do a backup. </s>
<s> Other than that, I really hadn't move a wire or cable or touched the drive because you have to dis-assemble this one to access the drive. </s>
<s> And I was reall happy with it till one day, shortly after the warranty I'm sure, it just wouldn't turn on. </s>
<s> Then I tried everything I could think of. </s>
<s> Another drive in it, removing and using different cables, and I finally decided that the unit was bad. </s>
<s> That really surprised me because it actually gets very little use and I expected it to last a lot longer. </s>
<s> Maybe it was just one of those freak things. </s>
<s> I just thought I would ask and see if anyone else had problems with that type of unit. </s>
