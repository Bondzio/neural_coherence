On startup I found several files missing this corrected everything seemed ok until I actually ran a game on it. The fans came on and it sounded just like a vacuum cleaner. It was returned to them on the advice of one of their technicians and they received it on the 19th March. After numerous emails and phone calls no one could tell me what was hapenning with the pc and the last call on 11th April I was told it could take a month I can only think they must have a part time techie in the workshop which apparently has no communication with customer service department as they say they dont know what is happening. My son recommended Alienware but I dont think I can do the same.

I was contacted on Monday of this week and told the pc would be despatched to me the following day Tuesday 15th April. I was again contacted on Tuesday 15th April and was again told by Sebastian that it would be despatched to me on Wednesday 16th. I rang them this morning to see if it was worth waiting in to receive it. Guess what? Its still in the workshop. It is now over eight weeks since I paid for this pc and it is still with Alienware.
