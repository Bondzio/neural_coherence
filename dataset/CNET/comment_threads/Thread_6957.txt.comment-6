They discovered the bug in mid January...
I ordered it a couple of days ago... About 2 months time, maybe that was enough for them to produce corrected drives and ship them to Newegg.
Hopefully it will come fully functional right out of the box and I won't have to get my hands dirty.
Though... if I plan on tweaking computers on a regular basis, I really should learn how to do this stuff...
