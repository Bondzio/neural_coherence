I recently got a &quot;My Flash&quot; 1G online for a very good price.
I first did a Google search for a &quot;1G USB&quot; and then went to one of the price comparison sites to find what I wanted for the best price.
You should also check local weekly sales at such places as Staples, Office Max, etc.
They sometimes have outrageous sales.
I recently had a friend pick up a 512 USB for $15.
And thats it!
