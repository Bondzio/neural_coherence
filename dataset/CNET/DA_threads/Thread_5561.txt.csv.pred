1.1.1	I'm currently running an extremely old piece of junk computer and im looking to build a new one.	St
1.1.2	I play a lot of online games so i am looking for a powerful build in a budget.	St
1.1.3	My budget is around $1,300 - $1,500.	St
1.1.4	I already have speakers but need a monitor.	St
1.1.5	I have decided on the graphics card (geforce 8800gt for a little under $200) and processor (Q6600 for about $250).	St
1.1.6	I am basically clueless as to the rest of the components like motherboard, RAM (although i want 4 GB), case, etc.	St
1.2.1	I've actually decided to change the processor to the E6750.	St
1.2.2	Good idea or bad idea?	St
1.2.3	And is it better than the Q6600?	St
1.2.4	The E6750 is $190 instead of the $250 for the Q6600 on newegg.	St
1.2.5	I still need help with the rest of the components.	St
