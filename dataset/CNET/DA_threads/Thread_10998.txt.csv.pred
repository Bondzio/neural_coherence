1.1.1	I have a LCD samsung syncmaster 930b monitor about 4 years.	St
1.1.2	The last few months when I turn it on it is really dark for about 1-2 minutes, then it's normal.	St
1.1.3	Now the last few days when I turn it on, it flickers for a few minutes, then it is normal again.	St
1.1.4	It's fine after it seems to warm up(?)	St
1.1.5	if that makes sense.	St
1.1.6	I read somewhere the backlight(?)	St
1.1.7	may be going out.	St
1.1.8	What is this and can I replace it myself?	St
1.1.9	Or is it best to say bye-bye to the monitor?	St
1.1.10	What else could it be?	St
1.1.11	It does the same on my other computer, so I know it's a problem with the monitor.	St
1.1.12	Thanks for any advice.	St
