thanks for sticking with me on this thread.
how do i look at the timing or cas latenciy for each module?
what module?
you're talking about the memory slots?
could you narrow down the list of memories i provided on here for me?
it is easier for me to decide.
i'm not worried about the price.
i just want a list of choosen memories from you that i've provided up above, starting with the best (with reason why for each memory).
i do not want to think my computer is aging fast.
lol i never have a problem with it.
i just need more memory, because i'm doing more and more things.
i'm sure this machine will be with me for a long time.
when it fails, i will buy another computer and my mother told me to pick what i want.
lol if she want to pay for it, then i'll pay her back.
that'll happen later in the future.
