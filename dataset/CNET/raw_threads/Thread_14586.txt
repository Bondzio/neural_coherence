I've had my computer for about four months, and I really want to upgrade it so I can play games on the highest resolution settings, but I don't know what is compatible with it. I bought the PC from bestbuy, here's a link of the computer with the specs and stuff. http://www.bestbuy.com/site/HP - Pavilion HPE Desktop - 10GB Memory - 1TB Hard Drive/5563052.p?id=1218661381249&skuId=5563052#BVRRWidgetID http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?cc=us&dlc=en&docname=c03359045&lc=en&product=5231389 I really would like to know what I can do with this computer, what graphics cards are compatible, if I need to upgrade anything, etc.

So any PCI Express x16 card can be used. - &quot;Power supply total wattage: 300W&quot;. So with a more powerful graphic card you'll need to replace the PSU by a more powerful also. Kees
