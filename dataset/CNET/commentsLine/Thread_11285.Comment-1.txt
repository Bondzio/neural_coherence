i have been reading ways of setting up a 2 router network, and could use some help.
what i am trying to do for a small local business is this: dsl internet, in the house, pc in shop (40 to 50 feet away), and wireless access while in the shop.
what i was thinking of doing is taking a router from the house (that connects to the dsl modem and from router to pc) to the garage where a router would be set up as a switch with wireless capabilities.
i need the pcs to have file sharing.
i would love to see diagrams if anyone has links to them.
thanks tc
