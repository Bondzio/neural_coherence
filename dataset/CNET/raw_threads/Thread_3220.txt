I recently acquired a fairly old 40 gb hard drive which connects using a wide ribbon IDE cable. I opened my dell computer, and found that it has no such thing. The only things using a ribbon of any kind are the CD/floppy drives, but those ribbons are less wide, and don't fit. The newer hard drive connects using some really thin blue cable and a power cord. Is there some type of cable that will convert the thin blue cord to a wide ribbon IDE cable?

Okay, so, since it's SATA then (as the other guy mentioned) will I need to set up a master/slave thing, or do I just have to buy a separate cord? Because those prices are NOT reasonable if I also have to buy the cord, since this hard drive is only 40 gb.

I bought one for about $20 which allowed you to connect the drive to your pc via the usb port - all cables and power supplies included, nice and easy.
