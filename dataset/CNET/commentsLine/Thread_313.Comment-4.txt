linux's installer will prepare the drive for you.
to trouble yourself with partitioning and formatting is wasted motion since the fat32 partition will be unusable for linux and you'll battle yourself as you learn more about linux.
you might even post a question why linux won't install.
instead i'd boot my prospective linux cd and take it's offer to install on the blank hard disk.
