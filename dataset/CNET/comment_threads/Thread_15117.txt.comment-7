Thank you for very much for your assistance.
I have looked at the acer models and they are missing a few things that I need.
I haven't found one that has VGA, bluetooth, and a large battery like this one.
Small size doesn't really matter that much.
I just don't want it to be the size of the laptop.
I also like this one because it has the new atom processor.
I have a feeling I am going to need some heavy processing.
Not really that heavy but the more power I can get the better.
