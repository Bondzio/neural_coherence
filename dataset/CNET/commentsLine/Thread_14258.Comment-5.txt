i checked the event log, to be honest, i am not real sure what i am looking for, though i thought i would be able to spot a problem if i saw one.
it could be &quot;user error&quot; that i didn't notice troubling though.
i am not too sure how to check my temps on the cpu, but was able to check my gpu and it runs between 75c-77c it seems.
