inspiron 1521 amd turion, 1.80 ghz 1918 mb ram vista, home premium zyxel p-330-w router cannon ip4300 printer (on network) yo!
back again with my continuing saga of networking woes - some days good, some days not so good!
newest issue is that if i want to print something on the laptop (using the networked canon ip4300), it will only do so if i have recently rebooted or powered up the laptop.
if the laptop has been on for more than a few hours, the print command just doesn't seem to take - most of the time, if i open the active printer, the command hasn't even registered with the printer yet.
but if i restart vista on the laptop, by the time my settings have loaded, the document i was trying unsuccessfully to print will have finished printing!
there's obviously some conflict at work here, or some setting i've overlooked - any suggestions?
i'm getting closer to having this thing working properly - i can feel it!
thanks for your response, john
