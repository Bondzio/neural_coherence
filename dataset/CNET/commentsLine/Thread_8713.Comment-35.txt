if you haven't opened the computer, and are sucking dust out of obvious filters, a vacuum cleaner is fine.
if you have opened the computer, then instead of squeezing into all the corners with the kenny everedge krevice nozzle, use a small clean/new paint brush to delicately flick the dust in the direction of the vacuum hose.
dust is usually not a problem for me because i'm switching boxes and boards so often, the dust has no chance to settle.
one thing that should be maintained for cleanliness is any keyboard that rates in quality higher than &quot;disposable&quot;.
if you're getting by with a 101 keyboard that doesn't have those pesky windows keys and is made with real switches (as opposed to a $6 dish sponge that doesn't let anyone build up a decent typing speed), you have a duty to keep it clean.
if your computer is in a smoking household--no cigarette within 10 feet of the computer!
i can make a small fortune recovering typist quality keyboards that have been filled with cigarette ash.
don't be afraid to run the normal vacuum over the top (not one of those usb things).
if that suction is enough to lift keytops off your keyboard either it's clinically dead, or you're using a karcher.
