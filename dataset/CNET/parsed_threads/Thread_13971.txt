<s> I am buying a new computer because I want a faster CPU. </s>
<s> I recently installed a new hard drive in my existing computer. </s>
<s> My system runs great! </s>
<s> can I simply remove the hard drive from the old computer and install it in the new computer as the master drive ??? </s>
<s> both systems are running XP sp1. </s>
<s> this sure would be easier and less time consuming than copying all my files and programs from the old drive to the new. </s>
<s> You can try, but most likely, you'll need to format the drive and do a clean install of windows on the new machine. </s>
<s> XP does not like hardware changes and may balk at the changes. </s>
<s> thanks for the comment...funny, I heard just the opposite, that XP is great at recognizing new hardware....thought that was what the plug and play is about. </s>
<s> I have no reason to reformat the old drive....if the new machine will not recognize the old drive I then would use the new machine in the new machine but copy old drive files to new. </s>
<s> have you had any actual experience swapping drives or copying files from one drive to the next??? </s>
<s> Tim </s>
<s> xartrax: There are many ways to accomplish the transfer, but I ususally burn the files to cdr, then transfer to the new drive. </s>
<s> This is a simple method and if anything goes wrong, you have a backup of you data on cd. </s>
<s> Here are some other methods posted by Grif Thomas in this thread. </s>
