it is best to leave the hdd running all the time, or to shut it off whenever it is anticipated that the computer will not be in use for several hours or days?
to me, a computer hard drive, like any other mechanical device with moving parts, is subject to physical wear and a finite lifespan, so it should last longer if it is not running for hours or days when not in use.
i have been running mine with the power options set to go into standby after two hours unattended.
but some of my associates are telling me that what kills hdd's is the warm up and cool down process, and that they have left them running 24/7 for years with no problem.
of course i always shut down completely and pull the power plug and cable connection whenever there is even the slightest threat of lightning.
after two computer hits in the past i don't want to smoke this one.
but i am wondering if i am doing more harm than good to the computer's internal hdd by turning it on and shutting it off every day.
