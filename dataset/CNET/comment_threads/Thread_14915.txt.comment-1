I would like up upgrade my computer by replacing the motherboard, CPU, RAM and power supply, everything else will stay the same.
I am ruuning Windows Vista home premium.
My question is will I have to re-load Windows Vista?
I upgraded to Vista from XP and only have the upgrade DVD and not the full version.
The price for the hardware is not an issue, but if I have to pay $250 for the full version of Vista that then becomes a problem Thanks Wayne
