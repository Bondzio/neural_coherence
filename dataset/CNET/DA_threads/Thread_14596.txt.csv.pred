1.1.1	Hi , I 've got 2 two rooms - each with 2 computers and a wired Ethernet hub - interconnected by an Ethernet cable .	St
1.1.2	I use dial-up from one computer and do not have broadband cable or DSL nor am I really interested in getting either in the near future .	St
1.1.3	I just got a Wi-Fi capable laptop and thought I 'd get acquainted with Wi-Fi access to my wired network .	St
1.1.4	My first thought was getting a Wireless Access Point , say a Linksys WAP54G , but now I 'm confused .	St
1.1.5	A router , say a Linksys WRT54G , *SEEMS* to have more functionality - 1 ) a WAP 2 ) a Hub - with 4 Ethernet ports ( ? ? ? )	Ques
1.1.6	3 ) a cable/DSL router for *LESS MONEY* , as opposed to a WAP with only 1 Ethernet port .	St
1.1.7	Am I missing something ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.8	Can I really replace a wired hub with the WRT54G and get wired hub functionality AND wireless access to my wired network ?	Ques
1.1.9	Thanks in Advance	St
1.2.1	Its very simple .	St
1.2.2	If you have a router , you can add a wap .	St
1.2.3	If not router , the the combo router/wap costs less .	St
1.2.4	I 'm using a 37 dollar dlink ( WifiG ) from compgeeks for now so I wonder how much cheaper you can go .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks Bob .	St
1.3.2	Just checking - so I can replace a wired hub with a , say Linksys WRT54G , router ( even tho I currently use dial-up and wo n't use broadband or DSL access ; the wired network is only used basically for back-ups ) and will be able to 'talk ' to the other wired hub and all other wired computers via wirewless from my new Wi-Fi enabled laptop via the router ?	Ques
1.3.3	Regards , Tom	St
1.4.1	In that case you do n't want a wifi router .	St
1.4.2	You would setup ICS ( or such ) on a host machine , then run that host 's ethernet to some switched hub and then wire an ethernet WAP to the switched hub .	St
1.4.3	Sorry if I missed you were on dialup .	St
1.4.4	Bob	St
1.5.1	Bob , No , you did n't miss anything .	St
1.5.2	I could have clarified better .	St
1.5.3	For now , I 'm perfectly content with dial-up .	St
1.5.4	And for now I would only want to use the router as a hub for my wired network and as a WAP to connect my new Wi-Fi enabled laptop wirelessly to since I basically just use the wired network now for backups .	St
1.5.5	But 'down the road ' I would still have the router functionality once I decide to get broadband cable or DSL .	St
1.5.6	( Re dial-up Internet access : For 'grins ' , I occasionally run PCAnywhere 'host ' on one computer to connect to the Internet and then browse from another PCAnywhere 'client ' computer via the wired network .	St
1.5.7	Kludgey and not exactly super fast , but it works !	St
1.5.8	Of course , until I get broadband cable or DSL , I 'll probably also want to try this wirelessly for 'grins . ' )	St
1.5.9	Many thanks , Tom	Polite
