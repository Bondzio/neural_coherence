usually the coverage distance of a wireless router is not too large.
so you may need some extension to cover all the rooms.
meanwhile, if the users connect to the internet by your wireless router directly, they might compete and use all the resource of your internet.
so the performance and satisfaction will be low.
in this case, it is better to have a wireless gateway to control the network, and use some access points to extend the coverage.
