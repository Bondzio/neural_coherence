Open Notepad and type the following text (in lower case) net start wzcsvc Save this as wbt.bat (onto the desktop). Then copy this bat file to C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Startup Then restart the computer.

A friend suggested this he thought that during the original installation something had gone wrong and zero configuration hadn't been configured correctly. By uninstalling in device manager you just remove the cards driver it seeems. You learn something new every day!
