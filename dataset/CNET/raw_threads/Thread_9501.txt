I bought a thermaltake 5g. When I connect the message that I get is that hd needs to be formated. What can I do to rectify this? Do I buy yet again another drive and switch the boards? And does anyone know if I can get a cheaper drive whose board will work on this? Thank you in advance

Now go get a simpler USB 2.0 or E-SATA thing that supports that size drive. Who needs something this flaky? Bob
