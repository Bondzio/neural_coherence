<s> All depends what you mean &quot;wireless&quot;. </s>
<s> There are a couple types. </s>
<s> First you have ISP plans from the cell providers and they have methods to attach to a desktop most via USB. </s>
<s> These are expensive and slow compares to most other internet options. </s>
<s> Next you have what they call WISP. </s>
<s> These are special ISP that use radio to provide there service. </s>
<s> There are many types but they almost all put antenna on the outside of your house and run a cable to your PC. </s>
<s> There are huge differences in quality and price In general you are still better off with a cable or dsl unless you have no choice. </s>
<s> In both cases you are going to to have to search to see if you are in their coverage area. </s>
<s> The last option is to hope to use consumer wireless to access a free open internet connection. </s>
<s> Most any USB wireless card will work on your desktop but the harder issue is getting enough signal to be usable. </s>
<s> You would really have to be close enough to a free public hotspot. </s>
<s> Most other options that involve using another persons internet tend to be unreliable and many are violations of their agreement with a ISP. </s>
<s> It mostly comes down to you get what you pay for and when you try a free option you will pay in frustration getting and keeping it working. </s>
