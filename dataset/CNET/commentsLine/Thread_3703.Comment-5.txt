i think that's sad.
the wireless card seems to be fine, but i understand what you mean about the cards not syncing.
i'll try g, thanks.
yes, i can leave a macbook down near the modem and internet share, but wired is mostly out of the question unless i want to buy a few hundred feet of cat 5 or sit on my washer to chart.
i don't know what you meant about something being wrong there, but i meant what i said.
