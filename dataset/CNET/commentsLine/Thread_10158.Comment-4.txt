will be slow when more than a few are copying files.
here's why.
unlike a wired connection where a switched hub keeps the pipes full and you get as much as possible from the server to each machine, wifi is shared air space so as each user is copying out it goes slower and slower at worse than one divided by the number of users copying out.
for web browsing the use pattern is such that it's not as noticeable.
