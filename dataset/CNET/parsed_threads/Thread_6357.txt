<s> I went to the Dell support site and put in my service tag # and got to the necessary drivers. </s>
<s> I downloaded the drivers but when I execute them, I get a &quot;Cannot Start Application&quot;. </s>
<s> How do I get these drivers installed? </s>
<s> I had to install Win XP SP1 after a HD failure and of course none of my drivers are present. </s>
<s> I need to get my OEM sound working again. </s>
<s> I don't have the original disks. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> This has been the cause. </s>
<s> Just a list. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> SP2 was required. </s>
<s> I have an old machine that the drivers will fail to install on SP3. </s>
<s> I have to write a note to myself about that and put into the driver CD sleeve so I remember that. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> An antivirus suite, firewall can interfere. </s>
<s> Disconnect the internet and try again without those. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> There is an order which drivers must (shall!) </s>
<s> be installed in. </s>
<s> Example: OS, Motherboard driver package, Sometimes the MSUAA then the sound driver. </s>
<s> More at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7587_102-0.html?threadID=271360#2699006 and you can google up MSUAA and Dells. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> A corrupted download. </s>
<s> Can be your AV suite or a download accelerator. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, Bob </s>
