1.1.1	Have two older Pionex systems which I am trying to rehab for use in a child care center .	St
1.1.2	Everything is now working fine except that I do not have sound .	St
1.1.3	Original OS was corrupted so I loaded WIN98 on all three systems .	St
1.1.4	One unit is 266Mhz , the other 350 Mhz .	St
1.1.5	I believe both have Cyrix processors .	St
1.1.6	One unit appears to have an onboard sound chip while the other has a PCI sound card .	St
1.1.7	I have replaced the sound card with a new one .	St
1.1.8	On both systems if I try to load a game I get the same error message : & quot ; WAVEOUTGETNUMDEVS -- -NO WAVE DEVICES -- -- OK & quot ; If I click OK the game loads but there is no sound .	St
1.1.9	I have deleted & quot ; Sound Controllers & quot ; in System Devices and reloaded the drivers but no luck .	St
1.1.10	Can someone help ?	Ques
1.1.11	Jeff	St
1.2.1	You get to find what it has , find the drivers and install them .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	The new sound card I installed came with a driver CD .	St
1.3.2	I was able to browse and locate the correct drivers which loaded properly .	St
1.3.3	Same error message .	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	I was not aware of this fact ... .but , all I did was load a clean version of WIN98 over the old version .	St
1.5.2	I did not wipe the hard drive clean before the install so should n't the MOBO drivers still be loaded ?	Ques
1.5.3	Why would this only affect the WAVE Devices and nothing else ?	Ques
1.6.1	For devices to work with a motherboard , sometimes you need to install the motherboard drivers first .	St
1.6.2	Microsoft does NOT install all needed drivers and the Driver Update button is little more than a demo of how good things could be .	St
1.6.3	Just wondering .	St
1.6.4	Since Windows 98 has been around for 7+ years , how could we avoid learning about the drivers ?	Ques
1.6.5	Bob	St
1.7.1	The title says it all .	St
1.7.2	What you say makes sense , but us common folk do n't work with computers all the time and we certainly do n't get into code and the inner workings of an OS .	St
1.7.3	That 's why we come on-line asking for help .	St
1.7.4	Thanks for your help .	Polite
1.7.5	I will search for the MOBO drivers and hopefully that will solve my problem .	St
1.8.1	Board and I 'll look for them .	St
1.8.2	Look up BELARC ADVISOR and supply its output MINUS any Serial Numbers if you ca n't find the make and model of the board .	St
1.8.3	Bob	St
1.9.1	Thank you for the offer .	St
1.9.2	Unfortunately , I scrapped out the old modems as the machines were never to be connected to the internet .	St
1.9.3	Thus I ca n't use BELARC ADVISOR until I put a modem in .	St
1.9.4	However , from looking at the board I can determine the following : First system is by Pionex , P-GXM266A-V2 .	St
1.9.5	It has one Cyrix chip labeled L2A0788 ; CX5520 and I am sure the CPU is a Cyrix .	St
1.9.6	Bios is Award .	St
1.9.7	MOBO also has the following stamped on it : M5CNB VER .	St
1.9.8	1.1 .	St
1.9.9	Second unit is also Pionex , P-CMII350B-V7 .	St
1.9.10	Cyrix M 2 350GP CPU chip with Award Bios .	St
1.9.11	M5ATD Ver .	St
1.9.12	1.2 stamped on MOBO .	St
1.9.13	Is this enough to go on ?	Ques
1.9.14	If not I will pick up a modem card and install .	St
1.10.1	then copied to the desktop on the computers that need it and the program run from there ... ..it will create a file that you can either print or write down the device makers and model numbers ... ... we 'll get you to the drivers .	St
1.10.2	So since you 're on the net with your computer you can download it for free ... ..very small program .	St
1.10.3	TONI	St
1.11.1	Toni or Bob , Very nice program .	St
1.11.2	I have installed it on one machine and received the following info : Windows 98 Build 4.10.1998 Bios : Award 4.51 PG 07/17/98 Model : Pionex Processor : 267 Mhz Cyrix GXm 16 KB Cache Board : GXm-Cx5520 Bus Clock : 64 Mhz Is this enough ?	Ques
1.11.3	Second machine processor heat sink fan is bad so need to replace before I run Belarc .	St
