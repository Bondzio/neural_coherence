Tech is just back from another call and another owner that was trying to run a P2P app but over their WIFI connection. It eventually was cured by replacing the router but said router is not a &quot;bad model&quot; but we are seeing such issues with P2P use over Wifi that I've come to a conclusion. P2P apps don't work well over WIFI. If it does work, then you just count yourself as lucky. What do you think? Bob

Hi, I've actually had pretty good success using a variety of peer to peer file-sharing programs over WiFi, and I don't think it's just due to random or dumb luck. Do you have a poor client card? I have to assume you do. In regards to setting up your network so that you are optimizing bandwidth speeds, I read something about it in the weSource section @ DITY-WiFi (www.dity-wifi.com)
