they've gotten bad reviews.
the antec basiq 500w ($50 at circuit city) is probably the best $50 power supply.
here are some other suggestions: coolermaster extreme 550w ($55) and coolermaster extreme 600w ($70) (good budget choices but somewhat noisy) enermax liberty 500w antec neo-he 550w ($88) but it's difficult to recommend any over the basiq for most pcs.
