Did you ever get your trackball working properly?
I have one (use Win XP) that has become problematic; working 50% of the time and vice-versa.
I have no idea what is wrong with it.
I love the big OLD thing and have no idea what I should replace it with.
Are there any other die hard trackball users out there with advice about current models?
