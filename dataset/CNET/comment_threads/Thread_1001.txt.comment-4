with a 3.0 Ghz cpu maybe looking into the 6800gt OC would work better.
i'm not an expert as to how each of the components interact and what can cause problems where but i would wager a 3.0 ghz might be a bit slow to maximize the performance of the 7800. on the flip side though so what if the cpu becomes the bottleneck?
pop out that 530 and stick in a 3.4 ghz or better cpu at a later date to balence things out.
i'm running an AMD cpu(64-3200+) and an x700pro card.
i'm guessing the way my machine is set up right now the 6800gt, maybe the OC, would be about the top of what my cpu could handle without it becoming the botteneck.
howver as i watch the market if i decided to buy a 7800gt then later go to a dual core 4400+ let's say then the ram would probably be the problem.
all taht to say a 530 probably wouldnt bottleneck things too bad if at all.
maybe wait a few months more and go to at least a 550 and the 7800 i dotnknow...
