<s> I would like to ask you if it is possible to extent WIFI range with one extra WIFI router. </s>
<s> I have one WIFI router which is connected to DSL line with IP address 192.168.254.1 and its LAN IP is set up to 192.168.2.1 and DHCP range from 192.168.2.2 to 192.168.2.30. </s>
<s> Mask is 255.255.255.0 in all cases. </s>
<s> I have bought one additional router because the range of antenna was not satisfied and I need to extend the range around couple of meters. </s>
<s> Due to it was the most convenient solution for me. </s>
<s> The first router is US 125BG and the second one is CNET CWR 854. </s>
<s> All both of them are brand new router and operate perfect as stand alone. </s>
<s> Problem is in reconnection all of them. </s>
<s> When I tried to connect them together via air they are not so communicative that why I am asking for you help. </s>
<s> Despite I have already researched all internet I did not find any proper diagram which can help me in my troubles. </s>
<s> I hope that it is possible to use one additional router as an AP. </s>
<s> The additional router had following configuration: LAN: IP 192.168.2.40, Mask 255.255.255.0, GW 192.168.2.40 WAN only DHCP no any special configuration, perhaps nothing is connected to its WAN port, WIFI method is set up as WDS+AP. </s>
<s> If you require any specific information regarding this issue I am ready to support you. </s>
<s> Very Many Thank for your Ideas and References, Kind Regards, Martin. </s>
<s> But in short you can create a wider area if you use routers as Access Points or APs. </s>
<s> This is the Cnet discussion forum (nothing to do with CNET routers) so you are not on a CNET ROUTER support site. </s>
<s> This is where people discuss things and help another. </s>
<s> Since you didn't give links to the manual I'll just note the usual method. </s>

<s> I hate it when the forum organizers answer a question. </s>
<s> They want to inform you that you are posting in the wrong forum. </s>
<s> Soooooo annnoyyyyyinnnnngggg. </s>
<s> I would slap you if I could. </s>
<s> Since this is a member to member forum, answer the questions of the other members. </s>
<s> There is some confusion about the CNET Network products and this forum. </s>
<s> A few members DEMANDED support and after too many times of that, I have to make it clear this is not that forum. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> is that this is CNET.com's forums, not to be confused with CNet USA, which is completely different company and we are not affiliated in anyway with them: CNet USA http://www.cnetusa.com/eng/index_eng.php CNET.com http://cnet.com I hope this clears things up. </s>
<s> Cheers! </s>
