it seems there are two different kinds of external hardrives.
1. ones with internal ac and internal fans.
2. ones with external ac that you can hook/unhook on the hardrive and with no fans but instead with glossy cooling case (kind of like aluminium or something).
which is the best type in terms of reliability and lifespan?
