<s> We had a lightning strike close by a few weeks ago and everything is plugged into a surge protector that shows it is working properly with no damaged. </s>
<s> My printer has a constant buzzing when plugged in now (I think it is shot). </s>
<s> Anyway, since then my monitor works and my computer boots up, but the mouse and keyboard were not working (wireless) and I could not log into my account in XP Pro. </s>
<s> I grabbed my son's wired mouse and keyboard to use for the computer and they don't work either. </s>
<s> I have tried every USB port on the computer (Dell Precision), which has 2 in front and at least 6 in the back, and they don't work as well. </s>
<s> The mouse shows lit up on the bottom and the keyboard lights go on when I first plug it into the port, but go off after 1-2 seconds. </s>
<s> The USBs in the front give enough power that the external hard drive lights are on when computer goes on and the card reader light is on as well. </s>
<s> Can someone please help me and let me know what the problem is. </s>
<s> I want the info off of the hard drive at the least, but would like to have the desktop working. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance, Steven </s>
<s> If in fact lightening has done damage, you can't discount any possible damage on anything. </s>
<s> Basically, you really can't fix it and/or a simple solution. </s>
<s> You swap and/or replace parts until it works. </s>
<s> I suggest you remove the current HD as a safeguard. </s>
<s> Mount a spare or borrow HD and be sure it works. </s>
<s> Then do an install of the OS and be sure all is well. </s>
<s> If the USB ports don't work then, bad mtrbd., etc.. </s>
<s> If not and it seems to work as in everything does what it supposedly does, then mount the old HD and swap data over. </s>
<s> Hopefully, you can continue from there if a new HD. </s>
<s> If borrowed, get a new HD and repeat process. </s>
<s> Otherwise, think new system or another PC, because by the time you fix it, it maybe another new system anyways. </s>
<s> I suggest the above as possible attempts at fixing the HD or in that direction may corrupt the data and you lose it. </s>
<s> You can also mount the old HD in a ext. </s>
<s> USB enclosure and using another PC, get data and burn to discs. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> (1) Does the surge protector have a warranty. </s>
<s> (Mine has a $$$ replacement/repair warranty on attached devices. </s>
<s> (2) You stated the CPU boots, but you have no control. </s>
<s> HD works. </s>
<s> The motherboard has a problem. </s>
<s> (3) Do you have a spare slot, and can invest less than $20? </s>
<s> If so, get or borrow a USB 2.0 card, and see if that works. </s>
<s> Your system is booting: PSU, Video card, and hard drive are working. </s>
<s> It's the USB and serial ports that are out. </s>
