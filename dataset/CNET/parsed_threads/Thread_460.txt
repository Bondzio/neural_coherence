<s> I just bought an external hard drive. </s>
<s> It's a 1TB, Fantom GForce MaxDrive. </s>
<s> I'm trying to format it to NTFS and, according to the manual, it's only supposed to take 90min, max. </s>
<s> Well I started formatting it around 1230pm today and, as of 1030pm, it's still going. </s>
<s> It's on 72%. </s>
<s> Is it normal for a hard drive to take that long to format from FAT to NTFS? </s>
<s> I found it faster to do the quick format then when I have the time to use the surface scan of disk checking later. </s>
