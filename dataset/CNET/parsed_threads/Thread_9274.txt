<s> I have been in the dark ages of technology but recently purchased a Dell Dimension 3000 Series Desktop. </s>
<s> It is the first time I've ever had any experience with a DVD ROM drive, so I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. </s>
<s> I tried to play a 2-disc DVD set that is supposed to have enhanced computer features. </s>
<s> When I insert Disc 1 everything works correctly. </s>
<s> It will play the movie like on any DVD player, and it will also pop-up a special DVD ROM menu and allow access to the special features on Disc 1. </s>
<s> However, when I click on most of the special features they tell me I must insert Disc 2, which I then do, but the second disc will only play as a regular DVD and will not allow access to any DVD ROM features or the DVD ROM menu. </s>
<s> It is extremely frustrating because I have no idea where to even begin to correct this problem, and it seems unlikely that there would be a compatibility issue or need for an upgrade when it will play one disc from the set but not the other. </s>
<s> But, as I stated, I have no idea about this kind of technology. </s>
<s> My DVD ROM is Sony DVD-ROM DDU1615 and I'm using InterActual Player 2.6 I went to the support website for the actual DVD, but it merely informs me that if I'm having trouble accesses the the DVD ROM features I will need to install the lastest version of Macromedia Flash player and have Apple QuickTime version 6 or above. </s>
<s> I have all of these components and don't understand the problem </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Some of my DVDs don't work either. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> A firewall could be a culprit for some of these. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> If you think PC support is bad, wait till you try to get DVD support. </s>
<s> (oops, you did on item 3.) </s>
<s> That leaves us with possible firewall issues. </s>
<s> Is XP all patched up and Zonealarm installed? </s>

<s> &lt;That leaves us with possible firewall issues. </s>
<s> Is XP all patched up and Zonealarm installed?&gt; I have no idea what that is or how to install it - which is most likely the problem. </s>
<s> I told you I was in the dark ages of technology! </s>
<s> Please help. </s>
<s> The nice part about today is we have google.com. </s>
<s> You could find out what ZoneAlarm is and install the free version. </s>
<s> Why I note ZoneAlarm is that the DVD software &quot;might&quot; need to access the internet for the features (some of mine do) and for such to work the stock XP firewall simply blocked the connection where ZoneAlarm asked permission. </s>
<s> If your machine needed other updates such as flash you could also research that on google.com Bob </s>
