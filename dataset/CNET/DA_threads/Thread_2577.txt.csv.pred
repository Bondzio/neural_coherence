1.1.2	fans are running , everythings on .	St
1.1.3	ive tried unplugging , re-instering cards , blown out the dust , bought a new even better power supply , spent 3 hours on google tryin to find a solution , nothins worked so far .	St

1.3.1	Knoppix is a great introductory tool to linux and allows the user more control over his system .	St
1.4.1	im pretty sure its a hardware issue , but ill give it a try ... i have a knoppix cd somewhere but i got ta find it , meanwhile keep posting suggestions .	St
1.4.2	personally i think there might be something up with the motherboard , since its not the power supply and the videocard is obviously working because occasionally the asus screen comes up , but possibly a faulty compacitor ?	Ques
1.5.1	The hard disk shows up .	St
1.5.2	I read your post and it seems like the hard disk contents or boot has vanished .	St
1.5.3	Bob	St
1.6.1	this weird thing is , its happened to me atleast 4 times before .	St
1.6.2	ill leave it off for more than 2 weeks or so , usually when i go on vacation during christmas and summer , ill come back and ill get this black screen startup stuff .	St
1.6.3	usually i just mess around and do the stuff i said and she 'd fix herself and start workin again .	St
1.6.4	only when i leave her off for a long period of time does it happen , and the same thing situation every time , the only difference is that this time nothings working ... and i cant see how leaving a computer off could totally fry an OS	St
1.7.1	Type BAD CAPS in google.com to find what to look for .	St
1.7.2	Bob	St
1.8.1	yeah i blew a compacitor , ill post once i get a new board and start her back up	St
1.9.1	still isnt workin , i bought a new asus motherboard and hooked everything up , comps still doin the same thing .	St
1.9.2	black screen on startup with an occasional asus screen as soon as the monitor comes on but thats about it .	St
1.9.3	im starting to think it might be my 550 dollar videocard ... .	St
1.10.1	The old video card works .	St
1.10.2	Here 's why .	St
1.10.3	Most systems will be fitted with just big enough supplies .	St
1.10.4	Then people add drives , power hungry cards and things like this happen .	St
1.10.5	The power supply should be north of 400 Watts but I ca n't tell since the list of what 's in the PC is rather short .	St
1.10.6	Bob	St
1.11.1	its a 550 watt antec , only about a year old , i bought it last summer to fix the same problem im havin now .	St
1.11.2	the power supply i bought yesterday and tried was a 650 watt thermaltake , but i still had the same problem when i hooked it up	St
1.12.1	I have this piece of cardboard which I put just the basic parts on such as motherboard , PSU , video card , 1 stick RAM , CPU/HSF and not much else to see if it beeps an behaves .	St
1.12.2	If not I downsize and try other parts .	St
1.12.3	Bob PS .	St
1.12.4	Why cardboard ?	Ques
1.12.5	Sometimes it 's a case mounting or short issue .	St
1.13.1	alright so here it goes i moved my videocard into my friends comp and to my surprise it worked fine .	St
1.13.2	i put it back into my comp and finally took an old monitor and hooked it up to my comp , and i finally got it to work , apparently somehow it was my damn monitor the entire time ... .. but then i get to the whole & quot ; windows did not shut down properly & quot ; screen so i choose & quot ; startwindows normally , & quot ; the screen goes black and the comp restarts and the whole thing starts over again ... so i decided id rather just reformat the entire thing then waste anymore time trying to fix it , i went into the bios and changed the primary boot device to my cd rom so i could put in the windows disk when i restarted .	St
1.13.3	i checked around the bios a little more and changed the & quot ; primary video device & quot ; from pci to agp and im pretty sure i also changed the & quot ; aperture size & quot ; from 128 to 256. i dont know why i did this but i did ... .so i restarted and now i dont have a picture at all , monitor light doesnt even turn green and i checked inside the case and my video card fans arent even on now , so i guess im back where i started , with a real problem this time	St
1.14.1	put back in the old motherboard with the leaking compacitor , started her up and she worked fine , turns out i guess it was the monitor the hole time ... ..i still dont believe it but i hooked it up to another comp and it did the same exact thing .	St
1.14.2	eventually im gon na need a new motherboard lol , thanks for all the help	Polite
