I've been trying to tinker around with these settings to get my 500gb drive to work, but no luck yet.
Here are the current settings that work for me, and the source of the problem might be here: Bios-&gt;Integrated Peripherals-&gt;On-chip IDE ------------------------------------------ On-Chip ATA(s) Operate Mode - Native Mode ATA Configuration - S-ATA Only P-ATA Keep Enabled - Yes P-ATA Channel Selection - Both S-ATA Ports Definition - P0-1st/P1-2nd Configure S-ATA as RAID - Yes Thanks for your time, if I can't get this to work in the next few days I'm shipping it back to newegg
