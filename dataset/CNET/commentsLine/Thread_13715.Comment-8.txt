you have to supply details and even the correct details for help forums to help you.
all you need to do is read your posts and see that the first post supplied &quot;not much&quot;, the second post had an error and the last post is one where you give up rather than tell what firewall you have installed.
i hope the last clue was enough for you to reconfigure the firewall which i still don't know if you have such.
the forum tip helps avoid such back and forth as we dig out the needed information: tip: if you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem, please be sure to include all the necessary information (ie: operating system, model number, hardware, software, etc) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution.
best of luck in your endeavours.
