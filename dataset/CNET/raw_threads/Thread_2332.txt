The screen is blurry , fuzzy, all kinds of things that make it hard to see. I have to restart it SEVERAL times maybe sometimes even just once but after restarting (w/e amount of times) the screen gets somewhat back to normal. I have switched monitors and still have the same problem. Can it be my graphics card? It's pretty old now, GeForce2 MX/MX 400 64MB. Thanks.
