Then try installing again, also delete anything from your &quot;C:\Program Files\InstallShield Installation Information&quot; folder. This may or may not make a difference. If that does nothing, I guess you could try installing them in safe mode, if this works (can't remember if windows will let you do that) then it's an issue with some driver/piece of software you have running on your computer. Otherwise it runs deeper, and may be a problem with the hardware itself. Hope I've helped. -Rhyvun

Then install the driver for your card.
