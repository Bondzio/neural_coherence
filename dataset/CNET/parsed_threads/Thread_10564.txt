<s> Hi Folks, I have a problem with my LAN. </s>
<s> It worked fine until I moved a computer to another room and tried to resume the net. </s>
<s> Nothing works. </s>
<s> One computer recognizes one other but the other two won't recognize either. </s>
<s> Someone suggested I disable the firewall, which I did, but no help. </s>
<s> He also suggested I ping, but I don't know how to do this. </s>
<s> I have run thru the set-up procedure many times and tried all the different ways. </s>
<s> I'm using a Netgear model #FS605 If any more info is needed please let me know and I'll try to furnish it. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Are you using Norton Security Center? </s>
<s> If so, disable the whole suite and see if you can see the other computers. </s>
<s> If not, check the workgroup names to ensure they are the same </s>
<s> If you're running Windows 2000 or XP on the machines, you can pull up the command prompt by choosing &quot;Run...&quot; from the start menu, typing &quot;cmd&quot; and clicking &quot;OK&quot;. </s>
<s> From the command prompt you can type &quot;ipconfig&quot; to view the computer's IP address, or &quot;ping &lt;address&gt;&quot; to ping another computer. </s>
<s> First, use ipconfig to determine the IP address of each system, and write them all down (the IP address should begin with &quot;10.&quot; or &quot;192.168.&quot; - as a side note, your default gateway should begin with the same digits and generally end in &quot;.1&quot;). </s>
<s> The IP addresses of the computers should be the same except for the last octet, i.e. </s>
<s> 192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.3, etc. </s>
<s> If they're different (192.168.0.2, 192.168.1.3, 10.0.100.2) then you have a configuration problem. </s>
<s> If any computer has an IP address beginning with &quot;169.&quot;, this is a default Windows-assigned address which indicates that the system can't talk to your router to get an IP address. </s>
<s> Provided all the IPs are correct, go to each computer and try to ping all the other computers; for example, if computer B is &quot;192.168.1.3&quot;, you would go to computer A and type &quot;ping 192.168.1.3&quot; and hit enter. </s>
<s> You should get four lines beginning with &quot;Reply from 192.168.1.3:&quot; - if you get &quot;Request timed out&quot;, &quot;Destination net unreachable&quot;, or another error, either something's not connected, or one of the computers isn't configured properly. </s>
<s> If you are getting &quot;Request timed out&quot;, it may indicate the Windows firewall or another security program is active - check the Security Center in each computer's control panel, &quot;Windows Firewall&quot; should be off (even though it will complain that it's not recommended... your router is acting as a firewall and makes the Windows Firewall redundant and next to useless). </s>
<s> Please reply and let me know if these tips helped. </s>
<s> If you still aren't able to connect, let me know what your ping responses/error messages were and I can try to help you out some more </s>
<s> Netgear normally provides their own drivers. </s>
<s> Did you try to reinstall them? </s>
