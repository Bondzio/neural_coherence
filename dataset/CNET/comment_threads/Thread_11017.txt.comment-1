I just bought a Maxtor Basics Personal Storage 3200 (100 GB/7200 RPM).
So I just plugged it in and managed to get about 7 GB of files transfered.
Then it went retarded and my comp wouldn't recognize the drive in Explorer (there was no icon for an &quot;F Drive&quot;).
Well, it's recognized in Disk Mgmt, and I can now create a partition and format the X Drive, it says with a max of 93 GB.
Question: If I partition and format now, will I lose that 7 GB of files I transfered earlier?
In case it matters, I have Windows XP and SP2 upgraded.
