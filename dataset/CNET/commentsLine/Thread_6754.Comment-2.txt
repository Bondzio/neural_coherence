you need to determine which side of that connection is the issue.
you'll have the wireless nic in the laptop and the wireless router or access point to look at.
this isn't easy.
you'll need to take advantage of the times when the connection is lost.
you said the blue light.
do you know if it's blue only when a connection is good?
if so, you'd need to go check the status of the device when the led turns off.
there are several reasons a connection could be lost.
it could be signal strength, a competing signal on the same channel, wireless phone nearby, etc.
you can try changing the broadcast channel in your router or ap.
see if the laptop works better when physically closer to it...within reason...in the same room is best.
anyway, before returning the laptop, spend some time troubleshooting the connection.
the laptop only needs to go back if a hardware issue issue is confirmed within it.
