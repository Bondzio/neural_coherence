Here is what I want to do: Take media from my home computer (which sits in my home office), and send it to my TV (in the living room). I am having various rooms in my new home wired for networking, but I need to know exactly what hardware I will need once the wires are in the wall. I have PC running Media Center and a router, but what else? Is there any type of wire that I should use in my network (cat5?)? Help help. every article I read about this, says something different. can someone make it simple. I dont want to make it too complex, I only want to be able to view/listen to content on my Living room tv and stereo.
