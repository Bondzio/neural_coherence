my cpu runs hot.
these means that my system needs extra attention with cleaning and cooling.
this problem also leads to extra fan noise.
for some time i was &quot;three-in-one (tm)&quot; oiling them.
currently i use a combination of 50% vaseline (tm), 50% graphite this seams to be working well and has reduced the frequency of this additional maintenance task and the noise.
the graphite &quot;might&quot; keep the bearing cooler.
a cooler bearing will last longer.
if you consider adding this task to your routine maintenance these bearings can be accessed by removing the label or rubber/plastic plug on the back of your fans.
make sure you put the fan back on the way it came off.
if the label can not be reapplied use tape to cover the bearing.
duct tape works well.
