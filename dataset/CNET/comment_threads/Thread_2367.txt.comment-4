PowerPoint works great on some netbooks, though I would get one that can hold at least 2 GB of RAM.
since running the software taxes the netbook more than projecting.
The only power required to project is enough to send a signal to the projector or TV monitor.
Nearly all netbooks have a VGA (15 pin) port which connects fine to either.
I got an Asus 1005PE in April 2010 and am impressed as can be.
I've loaded MS Office Pro, Acrobat Pro, Quicken Premium and Google Earth with no problems.
The weight and 11 hour battery life makes it great to travel and give presentations.
