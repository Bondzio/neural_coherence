<s> How many peripherals have you had to retire after upgrading to Windows Vista or 7? </s>
<s> -- None at all (Lucky you!) </s>
<s> -- One. </s>
<s> (What were they?) </s>
<s> -- Two. </s>

<s> -- I haven't upgraded. </s>
<s> -- I don't do Windows. </s>
<s> BTW, running 64 bit Win7. </s>
<s> I upgraded from XP to Windows 7 and was thrilled. </s>
<s> The OS actually worked, and ALL my printers, scanners and everything worked as soon as I plugged it in. </s>
<s> Even my old Canon BJC 85 portable printer. </s>
<s> Worked perfect without downloading drivers or programming(which by the way was not available with Vista.) </s>
<s> Even though hardware makers said they were not going to create drivers for either 32 or 64 bit Vista, when you install the peripheral, Vista went out on the Internet and found drivers that worked just fine with them. </s>
<s> I even installed a 10 year old Laser printer that had a regular printer input. </s>
<s> I was able to get an adapter cable that converted from a printer cable 50 pin output to USB. </s>
<s> I was surprised to find that Vista actually installed a printer for this old war horse of a printer. </s>
<s> It also installed a printer than I though that I wasn't going to be able to use to work with both Vista and Windows 7. </s>
<s> Both of those programs are very user friendly for installing printers and other peripherals that you might think would work with these new peripherals. </s>
<s> I have upgraded to Windows 7 Ultimate (32) on my laptop and just finished building a new desktop with Windows 7 (64). </s>
<s> Didn't have any trouble obtaining drivers for any of my peripherals, though none are older than 3 years. </s>
<s> I might just add here that I am basically a Microsoft hater, but I think they may have finally gotten Windows right with Windows7. </s>
<s> Everything has worked just fine, even my old Dell Axim pocket PC. </s>
<s> Windows 7 (in a new Dell machine) automatically downloaded a driver for it. </s>
<s> I had to download a driver for an Hp laser 1020. </s>
<s> The old HP scanner on the XP system just couldn't be coaxed to work with Vista 64. </s>
<s> Neither HP nor any other source had advice other than buy a new scanner. </s>
<s> So I did. </s>
<s> Works much better than the old one. </s>
<s> John Blair </s>
<s> Lee, A couple of years ago I upgraded to a new computer with Windows Vista. </s>
<s> Downloaded new drivers for Epson scanner and HP printer. </s>
<s> They worked fine. </s>
<s> However, Wacom had discontinued my digital tablet model and no driver was available. </s>
<s> I was forced to buy a new tablet. </s>
<s> It added around $150 to the cost of the upgrade. </s>
<s> Annoying, but I got over it. </s>
<s> :o/ Jim in sunny Florida </s>
<s> I'm getting close to retiring a Seagate external drive, once I find some way to inspect its contents for anything I may have missed. </s>
<s> The bummer is this thing is less than a year old. </s>
<s> I'm certain it's a driver issue, but nothing they offer helps. </s>
<s> So it goes. </s>
<s> Only one a Hp Scanner about 6 years old. </s>
<s> It wasn't so much replacing the scanner it was the attitude of the guy I spoke to at HP. </s>
<s> He was of the opinion that as my scanner was so old I should by a new one, even though on XP it worked perfectly. </s>
<s> Yes I bought a new scanner. </s>
<s> No it was not a HP </s>
<s> I have kept my desktop as XP Professional, and will do so until the cartridges are finished. </s>
<s> I would have to buy a new laser printer so am hoping this one will last quite awhile longer. </s>
<s> It would be great if there were new drivers to work with my Vista 64 bit laptop . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> If anyone knows of any I would love to hear where to find them. </s>
<s> I lost two hp printers and my diabetes meter. </s>
<s> I didn't really care too much about the printers, but to not be able to interface my meter has been a real pain. </s>
<s> I must now wait to get to my doctor to down load my readings. </s>
<s> would have been nice if the meter company ad upgraded their software to work with vista 64 or microsoft made vista 64 truly xp compatable. </s>
<s> I can use my Sony MD Walkman. </s>
<s> Uses mini-disks. </s>
<s> All I seem to have lose are some games I bought when I had XP. </s>
<s> They worked fine on Vista but not on window's 7 64 bit & the 32 bit??? </s>
<s> HP-Pavilion AW17AV-ABA e9200z Desktop 2.60 gigahertz AMD Athlon ll X4 620 </s>
<s> All my peripherals worked with Win7, 3 Printers, an older HP Laserjet, Epson Wide format inkjet, A Canon inkjet. </s>
<s> Also found drivers for an old Epson Scanner. </s>
<s> The best part, I turned everything on before install and Win7 found them all, one worked with Vista 64bit driver. </s>
<s> Even an 11 year old program that wouldn't install with Vista, works fine with Win7. </s>
<s> Win7 the best upgrade yet. </s>
<s> My not so venerable t5 is not compatible with Win 7 (64) and even though I tried the bluetooth connection it was not successful. </s>
<s> After a couple of months of this and that.. </s>
<s> I simply dual boot - using my WIN XP partition when I have to backup or install stuff on my Palm. </s>
<s> Eventually I will find a PDA device that does what I want with Win 7. </s>
<s> Because of work related security issues I can't use a cell phone device so the smart phones are out... although I think the Ipod Touch will apps will handle the program requirments.. TOO BAD PALM.. </s>
<s> none-as yet </s>
<s> I was running Vista 32 bit when it first came out and an old Canon printer would work, but the Vista wouldn't accept the drivers for it or the software for it. </s>
<s> Also an off brand webcam would work, but not the software or drivers for it. </s>
<s> I could use it for Yahoo Messenger, but no adjustments could be made. </s>
<s> Same with the New Windows 7 64 bit system. </s>
<s> Both would work, but only partially. </s>
<s> For me, it was a few pieces of software that have gone by the wayside. </s>
<s> But unlike Vista,which was a real pain, my printer was up and running within minutes. </s>
<s> HP scanjet 4200 flatbed scanner. </s>
<s> The only thing I have not tried is going into XP mode and trying to install it there. </s>
<s> 64 bit 7 Ultimate with new motherboard CPU and RAM. </s>
<s> I like Windows 7 a lot! </s>
<s> But I'm disappointed with Canon, who chose to abandon their old color laser installed base by not providing 64-bit drivers. </s>
<s> My LBP5000 still has more than 50% of its original toner, but I now need to copy files over to an old notebook if I want to print to it. </s>
<s> A software casualty of the move to 64-bit computing was my wife's beloved PrintMaster - the replacement of which by an incompatible name-alike has left many loyal long-time users without a home DTP option - especially when Microsoft's Office Home and Student Edition doesn't include Publisher. </s>
<s> I started with Vista 64bit by H.P. </s>
<s> New H.P.#5180 Photosmart Up graded to Windows 7 has Vista sp1 messed up big time ned </s>
<s> I have searched numerous sites for a driver for my 64bit Win 7 OS to no avail. </s>
<s> The manufacturers site times out when I try to reach it looking for a new driver. </s>
<s> Various sites answer when I search but they all require their Scanning Program to be installed and with no guarantee that they actually have a driver. </s>
<s> There is absolutely nothing else I think I can do. </s>
<s> I have tried the 3000 and 7000 scanner drivers but they don't work. </s>
<s> Maybe this scanner is just due to be retired Any help will be valued. </s>
<s> M.Mcx </s>
<s> The only device giving some headache when I changed system to Windows 7 64 bit was a CanoScan D646U ex scanner but it operates normally in the virtual XP Mode, which can be downloaded from Microsoft, assuming your processor supports the Virtual Technology. </s>
<s> It seems that Canon isn't overall very fond of making new drivers for old devices. </s>
<s> My friend had a Mulifunction printer and Canon has no Windows 7 drivers for it. </s>
<s> 32 bit Vista drivers exist but these won't work in 64 bit machine, otherwise it would be worth a try. </s>
<s> But my opinion is still that 64 bit is the way to go. </s>
<s> On my second machine based on a Intel Q8200 Quad Core processor, 4 GB RAM I had XP before changing to Win 7 64 bit. </s>
<s> It became a totally different machine, faster, smoother and very joyable. </s>
<s> None </s>
<s> I moved from 32-bit Windows XP to 64-bit Vista when it first came out and it worked with al of my hardware. </s>
<s> When I made the move from Windows 98 to Windows 2000 in college I found that some of my hardware didn't work. </s>
<s> I noticed that all of my hardware that had been sold with the Windows logo on it (WHQL Certified) worked fine. </s>
<s> Some of the hardware I had picked up from other computer stores didn't. </s>
<s> So after that I figured I would be better off with hardware that was WHQL Certified. </s>
<s> When I made the move from XP to Vista all of my WHQL hardware moved over just find. </s>
<s> Additionally my Windows Certified software all moved fine and had none of those problems with the Allow/Deny prompts that many people reported. </s>
<s> The WHQL drivers from XP worked on Vista. </s>
<s> Overall the transition was smooth. </s>
<s> A perfectly good printer, half full cartridges, over half the life of the rest of the consumables, and it is garbage on my Windows 7 64 bit PC. </s>
<s> Microsoft Windows 7 compatibility site says &quot;info coming soon&quot;. </s>
<s> It's been like that for months. </s>
<s> At least I kept my trusty XP and it works there. </s>
<s> I had to retire one external backup drive because W7 wouldn't load the software. </s>
<s> W7 cost me over 75% of my software and still haven't found an Adobe Photoshop replacement. </s>
<s> I read somewhere on the 'net that a scanner that has film scanning built in interacts directly with the OS in such a way that won't work with Vista or 7. </s>
<s> Same scanner would not work on iMac running OSX. </s>
<s> I didn't give up on the 4200f, I keep a hard drive with XP that I only boot to run that scanner .. and a 2001 copy of Picture it! </s>
<s> publishing. </s>
<s> We had an expensive 3 year-old HP Printer/Scanner/Copier/Fax. </s>
<s> Couldn't find a driver so we called HP support. </s>
<s> The guy's attitude was clearly that they can't be bothered to support existing products more than two years old, so go buy a new printer. </s>
<s> We bought a Canon and have been very pleased with it's quality and lower ink cost than HP. </s>
<s> That has saved us a lot of money. </s>
<s> Now, we've upgraded to Windows 7 64-bit and guess what? </s>
<s> Canon had new drivers available for us, no problem. </s>
<s> I wonder how many customers HP has blown off with their attitude? </s>
<s> I was able to make it work from windows updgrade, but decided that I wanted the full support of the Mulifuncion capabilities, so I went with the Vista 64 bits full download drivers and installed that on my 64 bits Windows 7 Pro, no problems and got back the PC Fax at the same time. </s>
<s> I just have praise with Windows PS that printers is fairly old i.e. </s>
<s> 4 years old at least. </s>
<s> Earlier I was using my Intel PIII 1.0 GHz since Jun 2001, 02 years back updated to EE Intel processor with 1 GB Graphics from N-Vidia and 4 GB RAM and SATA 500GB and VIsta Ultimate, but as I started using Full HD Monitor so neither monitor supported my old HP3400C(Scanner)and lexmark Z32 Printer nor the OS, receently switched over to Win 7 Ultimate that too failed. </s>
<s> But presenly, I got a new all in one which both way helped my space, headache for upgradation and money at the same time. </s>
<s> So, anyway thanx to Microsoft for letting customers upgrade forcibly for their benefit as well Microsoft's business. </s>
<s> When I installed Wins 7 32 bit on the release date, all my peripherals worked correctly. </s>
<s> On 4/10/10, I upgraded to the 64 bit version of Win 7. </s>
<s> So far everthing is working with no hitches. </s>
<s> This includes my 10 year old scanner. </s>
<s> Either all the driver updates were included with Win 7 or my automatic driver updates ran. </s>
<s> Personally, I lost my printer and scanner, and Vista thought that I ought to buy a new video camera as well. </s>
<s> A lot of my customers also had to replace equipment. </s>
<s> I don't mind so much the old stuff, but some of the things that I had to replace were still new, or even pruchased after Vista came out. </s>
<s> I think that retailers should have to make it clear that an item won't work with a current OS, or that I only works with the 32-bit version of the OS that is listed on the box. </s>
<s> Trick, Hi if you have pro you can use the Palm, I have that and work perfectly for me for sync. </s>
<s> Just in case you were not aware of this possibility. </s>
<s> The only real problem was my beloved Combat Flight Simulator 2 game. </s>
<s> When we got the new Vista laptop in 2008, I'd hoped its faster components, portability, and 4MB RAM would be an improvement over our 2001 1MB RAM desktop's game performance problems. </s>
<s> Much to my chagrin after the purchase, I was warned not to try running the game on Vista. </s>
<s> So I haven't, and it's been a real bummer, esp. </s>
<s> since I struggled with whether to order the laptop with XP or Vista in the first place, and had waited for MS to get most of the bugs out of Vista and put plenty of RAM aboard to handle it. </s>
<s> Otherwise, once we got used to Vista, it works fine for us, with none of the common issues people originally griped about. </s>
<s> Only 1,a HP Deskjet 990cxi Printer. </s>
<s> No new drivers for that model. </s>
<s> All my devices and software work on W7 except my Epson scanner, there isn't a 64 bit driver </s>
<s> When I was upgrading to Windows 7, I had to retire: 1. </s>
<s> My ADSL Router: It was connected to USB port and had no driver for Windows 7; neither 32-bit nor 64-bit. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> My Sound System: It was a SoundMax integrated sound chip on my ASUS P5LD2 SE motherboard. </s>
<s> There is only beta driver available for it that works with Windows Vista and Windows 7 but is very quirky. </s>
<s> Windows Update immediately updates to Microsoft High-Definition Somethin' and takes away a lot of its features including recording. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> My old IDE hard disk. </s>
<s> This hard disk was too slow for Windows 7. </s>
<s> My HP ScanJet 3128 also lost its enhanced driver which was not compatible with Windows 7 and is now using a basic WIA driver. </s>
<s> I also had to retire my Diskeeper and Kaspersky Internet Security because they were incompatible with Windows 7. </s>
<s> The only thing I lost moving to Windows 7 was my SCSI installation- an Adaptec 2960 card plus three peripherals-an HP tape drive HP stopped supporting many years ago, and two hard drives. </s>
<s> Adaptec stopped supporting all SCSI cards without explanation-typical company behavior-the hell with people who have their equipment. </s>
<s> They are now all SATA RAID all the time now. </s>
<s> A canny business decision that damns the customer as usual. </s>
<s> Windows 7 works okay but like all Windows OS's it eats fabulous amounts of memory and CPU during normal operation. </s>
<s> If I try to do things like move down a page while Windows 'draws' icons on the desktop or something similar-it's Blue Screen of Death time. </s>
<s> Not the first Windows version with this problem. </s>
<s> I was not able to use my Dazzle Video Creater (to capture VHS on my computer). </s>
<s> I upgraded to Windows 7 64-bit from Vista 32-bit. </s>
<s> That is not so bad as I am retiring my XP computer and will be keeping my Vista as the second computer in our home. </s>
<s> There are two models of this, so a 50/50 chance of habing a compatible device. </s>
<s> Check the Logitech site for details, I was very disppo9inted. </s>
<s> My Epson Scanner, for which Epson refuses to provide drivers. </s>
<s> Guess which brand I will NOT be buying when I replace it. </s>
<s> How did you connect the HP laserjet and what drivers did you need to download. </s>
<s> I have a Laserjet that is probably twice as old and would hate to retire it. </s>
<s> It is an HP Laserjet 4L. </s>
<s> Had to retire a wireless adapter and an external hard drive. </s>
<s> Checked the websites for both products and no 64 bit drivers were available. </s>
<s> Apparently, they want to sell new equipment. </s>
<s> It also affected the way I download from my Canon EOS 10D camera. </s>
<s> Suprisingly, Canon is not supplying a driver either. </s>
<s> I didn't have to retire this device as the solution has been to remove the memory card and have the PC read it directly. </s>
<s> I am another retiree and am still having multiple problems upgrading to a (relatively) new Windows XP system, so much so that I recently bought a secondhand 2000 Pro machine. </s>
<s> This op sys seems far more user friendly - why did they ever abandon it? </s>
<s> - and it has brought a lot of my old software friends back into reliable use again. </s>
<s> I am now wondering whether to abandon or downgrade (upgrade to Windows 2000 Pro?) </s>
<s> my Compaq Windows XP machine. </s>
<s> Currently I have not dared trying to use my HP 35mm slide scanner with anything but my very old Windows 98SE machine, with which it works like a charm. </s>
<s> It would probably work just as well with Windows 2000 Pro, but I would be very grateful if one of your other readers can tell me if this is so before I even start trying to install the SCSI interface board. </s>
