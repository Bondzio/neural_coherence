You'll need to provide your OS and whether or not you found a proper driver for this relic. I've noted that a generic windows 32 bit is about all Epson offers.

If it works there, it's something on this machine. If it fails there also, we start suspecting the hardware. Not clear, by the way, what your OS is: &quot;win xp serv 2&quot; means &quot;Windows XP SP2&quot;? And why not SP3? Kees

I prefer sp2 to sp3 because I get smoother networking linked with win7 in my internet cafe.
