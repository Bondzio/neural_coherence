<s> I bought an APC UPS for my desktop,but don't have a grounded outlet to plug it into.Does not having a grounded outlet affect the UPS as far as protection to my equipment goes? </s>
<s> I can put up with the little red light that indicates &quot;building wiring fault&quot;. </s>
<s> For some reason,APC says it's warranty is void if I don't use a grounded outlet. </s>
<s> Not to question your reasoning but it would work but given what's at stake why would anyone risk this? </s>
<s> I only run into no-ground outlets when the owner has fried a few thousand bucks of gear. </s>
<s> One of them thought an UPS could save their hardware. </s>
<s> Get that fixed! </s>

<s> I have booked an electrician to install a grounded outlet.I was only wondering if the UPS plugged into a non-grounded outlet would protect against voltage/lightning spikes,as well as the occasional power failure. </s>
<s> Protection? </s>
<s> Unlikely. </s>
<s> Provide AC for awhile. </s>
<s> Yup. </s>
<s> Well,I unplugged the UPS,and it started beeping,but the computer is still running normally,so at least I have power failure protection until I get the outlet grounded. </s>
