So you need to FOLLOW DIRECTIONS. I see it told you to backup your files but it appears you didn't do that. Instead you delayed and now are moving the failing drive to a new machine and complaining that Windows doesn't like failing drives. GO AHEAD and complain about that. When you are done you'll want to try going back to what did boot and work to get your files out. Bob

In fact, you should had checked for malware before xferring any files. It's possible to cause problems by xferring some malware as it attack continues, but normally, it should have been more obivous. If you have a true h/w fault, then getting problems now by xfering files is nil but again I don't know what total files they were. Dell, has a know issue with losing HDs under Vista, check thier support website for details and/or check the forums of theirs. Run some anti-virus tests or use the free online services check here at virus&security forum for links to same. good luck ------Willy

The owner was a P2P user downloading cracked software. They had no end of troubles on all their machines. Frankly I think they should get a Mac since this may be the only cure for them since they are convinced Windows is buggy as ell. They can't see the cracks for what they are. Their last comment was that Norton (yet another cracked software!) should have protected them. The protection starts with us. No, I'm not saying you have such an issue but thinking that Norton or other software will stop today's pests is wishful thinking. Bob
