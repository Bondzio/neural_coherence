<s> Tried to boot computer and received a nasty message saying: &quot;Boot Failure system halted&quot;. </s>
<s> Bios no longer recognizes drive C. Can this drive be used as a slave or is it trashed? </s>
<s> I would like to get some pictures out of the picture file. </s>
<s> I now am using a 15 gig Maxtor Drive from an older computer. </s>
<s> Seems to work OK. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> connect the failed drive as slave? </s>
<s> I'd give it a shot. </s>
<s> You might be able to recover your pictures, then format the drive and it be good again. </s>
<s> A lot depends on which OS you have and what is wrong with the drive. </s>
<s> I have had this happen and I take the drive out and make it a slave in a different PC and run scandisk on it and this has repaired the drive and it will reboot. </s>
<s> Works on W2K and XP, BUT there is no guarente. </s>
<s> Even if you can get it working again I would shop around for a new HD. </s>
<s> Then reinstall the OS on the new HD, and make the old HD a slave. </s>
