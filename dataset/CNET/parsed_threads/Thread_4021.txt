<s> My flash drive says it is not recognized and needs to be formatted. </s>
<s> But, yesterday, I had placed some important files that were not backed up on this drive. </s>
<s> How could I get back these newly saved files without formatting? </s>
<s> Try the programs listed in the top post of http://forums.cnet.com/storage-forum/ like Recuva and ZAR. </s>
<s> Success isn't guaranteed. </s>
<s> You should never put important files on only one device. </s>

<s> The dread &quot;drive not formatted&quot; error message generally indicates hard disk problems. </s>
<s> This can occur for many different reasons including a computer virus, hard drive problem, power surge, or problems with the operating system. </s>
<s> Therefore, it is important that you act carefully, if you want to get your data back safely. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Do not click &quot;yes&quot; to format the drive. </s>
<s> The formatting process may increase the difficulty of successful data recovery. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Do not attempt to write anything new on this hard drive. </s>
<s> The new data would easily rewrite your saved files and erase them forever. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Download data recovery software to help you. </s>
<s> There are many data recovery tools out there. </s>
<s> But, no all of them could be efficient and useful enough. </s>
<s> You should pay much attention to opt for a proper one, such as some efficient hard drive data recovery freeware: iCare Data Recovery Free and Recuva, etc. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> Run the selected hard drive recovery tool to retrieve your inner files and pictures. </s>
<s> Note: Actually, in your case, if you have backed up everything important on another drive before, you would not have so many troubles. </s>
<s> Therefore, you should learn a lesson to so regular data backup. </s>
<s> Thank you for your nice help. </s>
<s> I have followed your steps and download your recommended data recovery freeware. </s>
<s> Both of them works well on my flash drive. </s>
<s> But, the only the first one restores all my data important files back. </s>
<s> Thank you very much!!!!!!! </s>
