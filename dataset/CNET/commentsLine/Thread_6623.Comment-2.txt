you gave aspects of your problems but no real details.
all those items you mentioned can be at fault.
excluding any malware at work here, i suspect you have a weak usb???
ext.
port.
power issues are a possible link or not.
to have the problem appear rather quickly also suggests that as what else is constant if not power.
try a rear usb port to connect to for now.
come back with all details.
is this an ext.
hd you build or brought complete not as a kit?
