1.3.1	And some routers can forward such to a certain PC then that PC runs a logging program .	St

1.3.3	Sorry if it seems hard but it is .	St
1.3.4	Again , look for SYSLOG http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog Now that you have SYSLOG on your PC , your router can forward messages to that and you have your monitoring .	St
