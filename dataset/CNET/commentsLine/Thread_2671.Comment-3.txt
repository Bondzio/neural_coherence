the problem with using oem cases is they tend to be propietory or can't be used in the generic sense.
however, each system case can be made over with time and effort provided cost isn't too great.
to be practcial and since many a case may not conform to std.
generic sizing, you may find yourself in a corner.
however, some cases do easily adapt w/o any problems, but no info may be provided to headoff a possible glitch(sizing), thus you take your chances.
you may find it easier to take oem parts(insides) to a generic system case more easier but even that isn't a given.
