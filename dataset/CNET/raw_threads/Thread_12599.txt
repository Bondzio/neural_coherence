(Model # ST307504FPA1E3-RK) I wanted to get it going immediately, and living in NYC I also bought the only PCI-X card I could find from Tekserve, a Lacie Sata II 3Gb/s PCI-X Card 4E I installed the card and driver on my Powermac G5 Dual 2.0, (10.4.10), and although System Profiler recognizes the card on the PCI bus, it will not recognize the drive through the Esata connection. I tried all four of the ports, and nothing. Disk utility shows nothing there. The G5 does recognize the drive through the USB 2.0 connection. I don't know whether this card is compatible or not, and I can't find any information on what would be online. Does anyone know how I can get the eSata to work? Much obliged.

A Google of the PCI-X card turns up a number of hits but all are related to a La Cie RAID system and not about the card itself. P

I called Lacie tech support, and they had me install the latest driver from their site, (as opposed to the driver that came on the disc with the card), and Voila, the Seagate appeared on my desktop! So, I am good to go. Thanks again for your reply. Sincerely, Richard

13511	6	264823	2725335	2724405	mrmacfixit	3/9/08 6:46 AM	1.20504516E12	Drivers	The original poster had purchased a Lacie Sata II 3Gb/s PCI-X Card 4E for his PowerMac G5. On their products page, for this card, it states that Mac drivers are not required for this device, which is a little confusing. LaCie have posted drivers for OS X on their download page Here and these may be the drivers that the poster was referring to. If you called LaCie with the same problem, on the same card, after January 07, then LaCie was not altogether truthful with you. They updated the driver for OS X (10.4) so that it would load on Intel or PPC Macs. Hope this helps P
