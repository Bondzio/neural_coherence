just installed a pci based video card in my older desktop so that i can run dual monitors (one's on a serial port, the other is dvi).
i'm wondering if there is anyway to also use the oem/stock video chipset to run a third monitor at the same time on the original serial port?
we're using windows 7 here, if that helps.
