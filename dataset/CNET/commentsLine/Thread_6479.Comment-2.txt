will the laptop connect to?
does the wired pc have a wireless card?
if so, you simply bridge wired and wireless within that pc.
you make that pc an ap for the wireless laptop.
i don't think i can sort out our ics settings.
the gateway should definitely be the router's ip in any case.
my old recollection of ics was that the hosting pc needed 192.168.0.1 and the other addresses were to be within that range.
xp could have changed that but i'm not sure.
in any event, your wireless laptop needs to connect to something and, if the pc has both a wired and wireless nic, the easy way is to bridge these and connect the laptop to that bridge.
hope this helps.
