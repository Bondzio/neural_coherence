Does it require a specific type/model access point, if so can anyone recommend any? Cheers for any help

This is unlikely to be a requirement in a normal home environment, like you and me live in. So I assume it's some business, and then of course, we're talking professional stuff like cingular and t-mobile have for their WiFi offerings, and that might make a difference. Kees

SCL01 SCL02 SCL03 This way if one isn't working well they can report it. If you did name all the WAPs the same (which is not a good idea...) you could be shot or hanged by the people who have to maintain the system. Bob

They are actually pretty nice. A user can log in anywhere, and roam anywhere around the building/campus (where they can get a signal) and the signal will automatically move AP to AP with the best signal with no loss in connectivity. Of course you will pay a premium for Cisco equipment. There may be cheaper solutions out there. Depending on the scope and topology of your network, you maybe able to accomplish this using wireless bridges instead of AP's.

All users get to share the single airspace's speed. (slow bus to nowhere issue) 3. If you allow 802.11b connections... (let's go real slow) For a public solution it's best to not entertain that. Bob
