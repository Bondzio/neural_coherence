1.1.1	Hello , In our networking class , we have the following equipment : Dell Server running Server 2008 Enterprise , hosting Active Directory Dell Server running Server 2003 Enterprise , part of Active Directory Dell Optiplex GX620 Running Windows 7 Dell Optiplex GX620 Running Windows XP Two SonicWall TZ100 routers One Cisco switch Our goal is to have both servers on one router , and both desktops on the other router to be connected via the switch .	St
1.1.2	We have a third switch so we can simulate having two outgoing connections to the internet when we really only have one .	St
1.1.3	We need to be able to connect both servers and both desktops to the internet , as well as share specified files via the network as well .	St
1.1.4	We are able to log in with our domain usernames and passwords on all PCs on the domain , but only the desktops are able to see each other .	St
1.1.5	The servers can not see each other and the desktops are unable to see the servers , and the servers are unable to see the desktops .	St
1.1.6	The folder we are trying to share is on the server running Server 2003 .	St
1.1.7	Advice ?	Ques
1.2.1	& quot ; both desktops on the other router to be connected via the switch. & quot ; That & quot ; seeing & quot ; or seeing items in the Network Neighborhood only extends to your LAN .	St
1.2.2	Since you have servers outside your LAN , there is no reason to see such .	St
1.2.3	You say this is a class .	St
1.2.4	How could they have missed such a basic thing ?	Ques
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Clarification : The servers are not outside our LAN ; the switch , routers , servers and desktops are all on the same LAN , we are just using one outside/Internet line .	St
1.4.1	In this post you state & quot ; on the other router & quot ; so those are not on the same LAN .	St
1.4.2	Case closed .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	By & quot ; third switch & quot ; I meant second , my mistake .	St
1.5.2	Both routers are connected to the same switch , so does n't that make it a LAN ?	Ques
1.6.1	And it needs to be on a VPN !	St
1.7.1	Both routers are connected to the same switch , so does n't that make it a LAN ?	Ques
1.7.2	No .	St
1.7.3	Since the usual setup is to plug the routers WAN port to the other LAN , network address translation and more is in play .	St
1.7.4	So no , not supposed to work .	St
1.7.5	- & gt ; What sort of class is this that does n't cover how to determine what a LAN is ?	Ques
1.7.6	Have class content and quality sunk so low that they do n't cover a basic item like this ?	Ques
1.7.7	I know the issue of Microsoft shares outside a LAN is a stumper for the newbies but they catch on fast .	St
1.7.8	Bob	St
1.8.1	[ IMG ] http : //i.imgur.com/YSvqM.png [ /IMG ] That 's what we need !	St
1.9.1	I read this is some class .	St
1.9.2	As presented this is one bad class .	St
1.9.3	Maybe there 's more to this than what you gave but it 's not supposed to work as connected and as presented in your first post .	St
1.9.4	If you want to change the setup , start a new discussion with the new setup .	St
1.9.5	Bob	St
