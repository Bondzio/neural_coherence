<s> I rent a room in a house for 3 and I always get this feeling that someone is snooping around my external HD by plugging the HD into their laptop when I am not home. </s>
<s> How can i password protect the HD or show only certain files? </s>
<s> Encrypting a 250 gig HD sounds like it takes forever so perhaps it is not a considered option? </s>
<s> Is that you must deny phyical access. </s>
<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_insecurity#Direct_access_attacks Sadly, given physical access, there is little you can do. </s>

<s> you could password protect sensitive files but going beyond to encryption can be really dangerous if you forget the PW or the disk becomes corrupt. </s>
