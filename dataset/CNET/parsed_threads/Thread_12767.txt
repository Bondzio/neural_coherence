<s> I have an Acer netbook. </s>
<s> The Wifi connects perfectly when I go away - no problems at all, the networks pop up, I chose which one to use, enter any passwords and I'm away. </s>
<s> However, at home, with own network, it connects immediately to the network but NOT to the internet. </s>
<s> It's obviously some sort of setting that needs altering but can anyone give me any idea of where to look? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Sounds like a router setting at home. </s>
<s> What router are you using at home? </s>
