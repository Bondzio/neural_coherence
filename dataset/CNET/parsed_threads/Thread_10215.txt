<s> OK, I have decided to wait until the P38 motherboards come out before I customize a new computer. </s>
<s> Here is what I am thinking of getting for current use to be capable of upgrading. </s>
<s> quad 6600 p38 motherboard single 8800 gts 640 mb graphics card not sure what case to get I think a 650w powersupply would suffice no sound card I would like a media card reader and of course DVD-R/DVD most likely a 500 GB hard drive, I have read raptors are really only a few secs faster, so no need to spend extra for just a few secs If I am going to get only 1 graphics card, I see no reason to get a SLI or Crossfire mobo, correct? </s>
<s> With the above generic hardward, what specific brands would you recommend? </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> x38 based mobos should be out around Sept 23rd. </s>
<s> it brings pci-express 2.0 and some memory latency improvements. </s>
<s> initially most x38s will be ddr3 only but some manufacturers are planning ddr2 versions. </s>
<s> almost all will have at least 2 pci-e x16 slots. </s>
<s> performance-wise, the x38 should be a bit (3-5%) faster than a stock p35, but a well tuned p35 will close the gap. </s>
<s> since you're choosing mid-high range components a p35 mobo should be sufficient. </s>
<s> why spend $240 on a mobo and then put a $280 cpu in it? </s>
<s> the x38 is intended for ultra-high end performance and components. </s>

<s> I had thought of the P38 for sake of energy efficiency and power consumption from what I had heard about that mobo. </s>
<s> You are right, that I could go with the P35 as I am not intending to overclock at all. </s>
<s> From the components I am looking at, what kind of case would you recommend? </s>
<s> Would a Corsair 650w PSU be overkill or something I should consider? </s>
<s> since you've said you're not interesting in sli/crossfire, a 500w unit should suffice. </s>
<s> the corsair 620w is $170 while the 520w is $125 (from newegg). </s>
<s> either of these 500w power supplies are good alternatives also. </s>
<s> Antec neohe 500, $80: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=269998 COOLERMASTER Real Power Pro RS-550, $99: http://www.zipzoomfly.com/jsp/ProductDetail.jsp?ProductCode=10006328 as for a case, that's mostly a matter of choice. </s>
<s> side window? </s>
<s> drive door? </s>
<s> flashy lights? </s>
<s> i'm a big fan of the coolermaster cavalier and mystique cases. </s>
