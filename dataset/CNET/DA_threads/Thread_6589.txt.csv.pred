1.1.1	Bought ( and returned ) a Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex Ultra-Portable External Hard Drive , 500GB , yesterday and tried to use it on a public Mac but could n't because I did n't have the & quot ; admin & quot ; password to install the required compatibility software ( and ca n't get one ) .	St
1.1.2	I need to buy an ext .	St
1.1.3	storage device that can work with my WinXP PC and be written to on this public Mac running OS X .	St
1.1.4	Please suggest a Brand and Model that will work for this , I am at a loss .	Sug
1.2.1	It seems the goflex can be formatted for the apple and be used without said app .	St
1.2.2	Why not do that ?	Ques
1.2.3	As to the PC and MAC issue , deeply discussed so while NTFS will give ME THE BEST results I wonder if a public mac is up to date to use that .	St
1.2.4	FAT32 is an option but is not reliable for me .	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the input , I 'm still at a loss because I 'd have to figure out this formatting issue on my PC , and I 'm not sure that 's possible from the research I 've done .	St
1.3.2	In response , the Mac is very new , it 's some sort of a pro computer that I 'm using FinalCutPro on , so not only do I need my hard drive for memory but also to use as scratch disk space .	St
1.3.3	I 'm not tech savvy at all , and I ca n't really try it out again because Office Depot told me that they made an exception , but there are no refunds on this item ( just even exchanges ) .	St
1.3.4	So , unless I buy something online someplace else and wait and pay for shipping , then O.D .	St
1.3.5	is my only local option .	St
1.3.6	Any additional input would be greatly appreciated .	St
1.3.7	I wish I were better at this stuff ... Marcy	St
1.4.1	And you could get the same effect by placing your router in the location you would put this repeater .	Sug
