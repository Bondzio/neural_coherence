i have a bestbuy certificate and was looking at the epson workforce 845 for home use but was scared off by the best buy person who i think didn't have a clue of what the cost per page for ink was for black or color and blindly suggested an hp i think 4700 based on the fact it ran fast and the cost per ink per box seemed low to him rather then going by the cost of ink per page.
any suggestions?
thank you!
