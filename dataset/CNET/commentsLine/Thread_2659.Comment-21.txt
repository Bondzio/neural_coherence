i have no use for maxtor.
i used to make a liveing building pc's and repairing them.
maxtor was nearly always the drive that failed.
in my experience they have about on average a 14 to 18 month life span.
and when they go - they go hard, fast and complete.
seagate has been my choice of drive since the mid 80's and for a while there was quantum.
i have some seagates that are 120 megs in my oldest pc, yeah i still run it occasionally, that are still spinning just fine.
when seagate bought maxtor - it sent a chill up my spine, i dont know what they are doing with it.
time will tell.
