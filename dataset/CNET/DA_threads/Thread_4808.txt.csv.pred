1.1.7	I know how to unzip files , how to delete on the flash drive but that is the extent of my knowledge .	St

1.2.1	It seems someone wrote something odd .	St
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	I think R. Profitt would do well to learn a little compassion for his fellow man .	St
1.3.2	His brief reply gave no help .	St
1.3.3	Perhaps it is my fault for not stating my problem correctly .	St
1.3.4	On my own I found a link from PC Magazine that explains WHAT I want to do but not HOW to do it .	St
1.3.5	Here is the link : http : //www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1846801,00.asp Since my familiarity with Windows Explorer is limited I would like some honest help with my problem .	St
1.3.6	I like learning new things and this flash drive is a new toy I sincerely want to learn to work with .	St
1.4.1	http : //www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1846801,00.asp on the first page does n't mention this need to create a root entry .	St
1.4.2	Compassion has little to do with this discussion .	St
1.4.3	If you want to discuss that , please note so and we 'll go down that road .	Sug
1.4.4	- & gt ; In short , all drives we use already have a top or root directory .	St
1.4.5	Your basic books on Windows , Dos should cover this in depth .	St
1.4.6	If you need NEWBIE information , just ask for it in the Newbie Forum .	St
1.4.7	You posted in a not-newbie forum so the shorter answers will come first to see if that suffices .	St
1.4.8	From there we expand on the discussion .	St
1.4.9	Some will expect long detailed answers but this will not happen since all replys are from volunteers .	St
1.4.10	This is not tech support , but where we discuss the topic and dig into it and hopefully come away with some answers .	St
1.4.11	If you want tech support ... . -- & gt ; & quot ; To do all this , create a text file named Autorun.inf in the drive 's root directory , with contents something like this & quot ; That 's on the second page of the article .	St
1.4.12	It did not ask you to create the root directory , but to place the items there .	St
1.4.13	This is bashing words but we must be careful and read the sentance with care and double-so if we copy that elsewhere .	St
1.4.14	In closing , you have the root directory .	St
1.4.15	It 's the top or the one with just the backslash .	St
1.4.16	Hope this helps .	St
