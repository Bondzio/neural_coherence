1.1.1	I have a computer that is stuck acquiring network address when you try to go through a router and try to give an ip automatically.	St
1.1.2	If I put a static ip in and don't dynamically try to allocate an ip it works fine.	St
1.1.3	I've hooked it up on a router that I'm able to get all computers to work on now.	St
1.1.4	I just can't get this computer to work.	St
1.1.5	I've tried several things I've read on the net from netsh winsock reset catalog(at the cmd prompt),winsock fixes, and uninstalling SP2 setting speed and duplex from auto to 10mb full and back.	St
1.1.6	Could it be the network card itself.	St
1.1.7	The computer is a dell bought through military contract.	St
1.1.8	Computers that are the same system exacty with the same network card work fine, but this one doesn't.	St
1.1.9	Any more suggestions.	St
1.1.10	Thanks in advance	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	We are currently in Iraq.	St
1.3.2	The internet service is bootlegged off of a contractor.	St
1.3.3	All they have is one ip address and more than one computer needs access.	St
1.3.4	thanks mb	Polite
1.4.1	all of your PCs can connect now through the router.	St
1.4.2	With only one PC misbehaving perhaps there is a hardware issue.	St
1.4.3	Try testing the card by swapping it with another from a working machine.	St
1.4.4	I still do not know why a static IP could not be used on this one machine and dynamic IPs on the rest.	St
1.5.1	it is a hardware issue also.	St
1.5.2	Maybe I don't know enough about networking, but the wires that are run are coming off of a router that has an ip in it.	St
1.5.3	They don't have a dedicated wire or another ip to put on the machine(except that which is coming from the router).	St
1.5.4	I put a static ip on the laptop testing it out from my building which is not the same building as what the computer is needed to be run from.	St
1.5.5	thanks and I apologize if I wasn't clear.	Polite
