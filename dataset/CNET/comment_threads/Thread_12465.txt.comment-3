Hey Bob.
I'm running a COMPLETELY new system from the tower, to everything inside of it (except the GPU).
Completely fresh OS install of Win8.
My old system was a Core 2 Duo e5300, 4GB of RAM 250GB HDD, Win8, and I forget the exact mobo but it was an LGA775 with Q35 chipset.
I've also noticed that when the screen flashes and I have the display options in front of me, it goes from displaying &quot;SyncMaster P2350(G)/P23500&quot; to &quot;Generic non PnP monitor&quot; then flashes back and changes the name to my display device.
It's weird.
Sorry if I left out any information, still kind of new to the forum scene.
Thanks.
