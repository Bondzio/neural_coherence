custom built for the last 10 years i've been building my own pcs rather than any 'brand' pcs, basically because it works out cheaper and i know everything that's in it.
alot of my friends have bought 'brand' pcs with varying degrees of reliability and performance.
i'm currently running an intel q6600 water cooled and overclocked to 3ghz, asus stryker 2 formula motherboard, geforce 9600 gt sonic 512mb graphics card, 8 gb ddr2 800 ram, 1 x raptor 150gb sata hdd, 2 x 750gb sata hdd, lightscribe dvd writer in a thermaltake armor case and connected to 2 x 22&quot; widescreen monitors and also connected to my 50&quot; plasma tv via the graphics cards hdmi output all running vista ultimate 64bit.
this system has cost alot of money but it can be built up a step at a time so spreading the cost to a more affordable range and ending up with a constantly evolving system.
i'm not knocking any of the brand make pcs but for me personally i like to get into the guts of a computer and get a great satisfaction from doing it myself.
from the experiences of friends etc i'd probably rate dell over many of the rest for reliability and emachines probably rate worst as most of my friends who have bought one have had nothing but trouble and they had no luck with customer support either.
