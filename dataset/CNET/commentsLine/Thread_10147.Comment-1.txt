this might be a dumb question, but here goes.
i have a geforce fx 5500 video card that fit in my old motherboard's agp slot.
now my new motherboard doesn't have a agp slot only, pci and pci express.
the problem is that the fx5500 doesn't physically fit into the pci slots, it's too long.
i planning on buying a new video card for the new motherboard, but how will i know what card will physically fit into the slots?
