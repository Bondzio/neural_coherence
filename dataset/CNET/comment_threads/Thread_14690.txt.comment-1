I bought my Vista 64 bit desktop 6 months ago and have been trying to connect two wireless laptops running XP.
I have been all over looking for help on the web.
HP will not help without paying more or will Geek Squad.
I have a Linksys Router WRT54G that I am using and both wireless laptops connect to the internet fine, but just can't get a network.
I have made sure all PCs have the same name and been through settings after settings.
Can anyone help?
