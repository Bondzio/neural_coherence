Sorry to say I have the same problem with an Epson stylus color 880 ever since it sucked in two sheets of heavy glossy photo paper at one time.
Had a tough time removing them.
I suspect that damaged the nozzles.
Changing cartridges did not help.
Unlike some other mfg printers, the Epson nozzles are not part of the cartridge.
I tried everything you did & everything the Epson Help desk suggested except taking it to one of their repair stations.
