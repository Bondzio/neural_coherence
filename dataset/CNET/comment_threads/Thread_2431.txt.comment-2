I use dual monitors as well, but as a clone.
How does yours work?
Right click the desktop and click properties.
Go over to the settings tab, and click your monitor, the 20 inch.
Try changing then.
I know you somehow turn off the Laptops monitor, I have a Dell Laptop and you press Ctrl Alt F3 to switch the onboard monitor on and off.
