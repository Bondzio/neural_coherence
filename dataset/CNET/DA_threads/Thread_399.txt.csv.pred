1.1.1	I bought a computer from Cyberpower.	St
1.1.2	It keeps killing video cards.	St
1.1.3	It seems like a cooling problem.	St
1.1.4	The case temps range from 22c to 24c.	St
1.1.5	It came with 2 cooling fans in the case.	St
1.1.6	Would more fans help?	St
1.1.7	Do you think it might be something else?	St
1.1.8	(Motherboard, bios, etc..) Any suggestions?	St
1.1.9	(5 times) NVIDIA Geforce-4 TI4200 128MB DDR 8X AGP w/ TV-Out & DVI (Current) Albatron Ti4280EP (This one lasted almost 1 year)but it's failing now	St
1.2.1	Have you replaced the power supply?	St
1.3.1	the computer is only a little over a year old.	St
1.3.2	I just pulled up my invoice.	St
1.3.3	It's an ATX 430W P4 POWER SUPPLY WITH DUAL FANS.	St
1.3.4	Retail is approx 80 bucks.	St
1.3.5	I wouldn't think it's going bad already.	St
1.3.6	If the computer were 5-6 years old, and it was a cheap power supply, maybe.	St
1.3.7	I am getting no indications (random reboots, smell, sounds, etc) that it's going bad.	St
1.4.1	You are in a situation where you have to swap hardware until you figure out what is wrong with the system.	St
1.4.2	the most likely cause of a video card going bad, over and over, is incorrect voltage from the motherboard, and that is most likely due to a faulty power supply.	St
1.4.3	You can get something like a Sparkle power supply, 450Watts or so, for around $50.	St
1.4.4	That is the first step in trying to figure out where the problem is.	St
1.4.5	The only other thing to replace is the motherboard.	St
1.4.6	Those are the only 2 things that really could cause what you are seeing.	St
