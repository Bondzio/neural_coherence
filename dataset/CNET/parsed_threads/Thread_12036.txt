<s> Alright, I've knocked out the possiblity that it's the keyboard/mouse, because I've tried three different mouses, and two different keyboards. </s>
<s> The mouses are not picked up at all. </s>
<s> The keyboards are picked up, but not very well. </s>
<s> They work fine in Windows, but they do not respond in the BIOS. </s>
<s> It also takes multiple tries for the computer to pick up the pressing of the F1 key (for entry to the bios). </s>
<s> This is not my own computer, this is a computer I'm working on for a friend, and I'm thoroughly stumped. </s>
<s> At the moment, I've been dealing with using the numberpad to control the cursor, but I don't want my friend to have to deal with that for the rest of the life of this computer. </s>
<s> It's fairly new, only bought within the past six months or so. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> The only item about the machine shared was the 6 months. </s>
<s> That's a warranty issue. </s>

<s> However, if sent away, I was told that they will do whatever they have to to fix it, without contacting us first either. </s>
<s> Which means, all the data might be wiped, so we have to back everything up first. </s>
<s> That's not something that's real fun without a mouse. </s>
<s> Did you just reveal there is no backup plan? </s>
<s> Ouch. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Now there is, but there wasn't. </s>
<s> We've decided we are going to send it away, but I taught them how to back everything up so I didn't have to do it for them. </s>
<s> No, we were looking for a way that would not require a backup first. </s>
<s> It's very tedius backing up files without a mouse, if you haven't tried before. </s>
<s> How can I avoid backup? </s>
<s> The only answer I know of is to never put anything I want to keep on that machine. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Anyway you can help me explain that to someone who's only computer skills are turning it on, getting into the internet, and checking e-mail? </s>
<s> Really, I just assumed it wasn't worth it. </s>
<s> It sounds like you won't be losing your files today. </s>
<s> &quot;Anyway you can help me explain that to someone who's only computer skills are turning it on, getting into the internet, and checking e-mail?&quot; In their case it looks like there is nothing to be saved. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> That's one way of looking at it. </s>
<s> Nevertheless, I did show them one way of doing it, although difficult, and they're waiting for the box to arrive any day now. </s>
