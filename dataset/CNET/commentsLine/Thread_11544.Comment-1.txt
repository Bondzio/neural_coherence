does any one know how i can transfer the program files and data from my old 10g hd with xp home edition on it to a different pc with a 20g hd on it?
the 20g hd presently has windows 2000 pro on it which i assume i will need to reformat.
i have norton ghost 9.0 if i was to plug the 10g hd to this computer would i be able to do a drive to drive transfer?
is it possible that xp being a newer os than 2000 would have the mb drivers needed for this computer to reconize the old xp hd.
thanks for any help.
