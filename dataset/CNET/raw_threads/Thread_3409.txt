I would like one that has fairly good resolution, maybe face tracking, and a resonable price. I looked at the Logitech Quickcam Fusion, and it seems good. I saw it on Newegg for $50 with a rebate. However, are there any other webcams that are cheaper and/or better? I do not particularly need a wide lens like the Fusion has. Anyway, I would like to hear what you think about this. Thanks! -The Collective

Although the avatars & extras are entertaining they get old in a hurry. I actually asked other I camed and my results weren't that great. When I saw very good live webcam video, I've asked the person what brand & model. I've been told a WalMart a $29., a Logitech notebook webcam to A Sony Handycam response and others. Perhaps you should buy, try and return it doesn't work as you hope. I understand CCD webcams usually provide a better image than the common CMOS webcams. Sometimes finding which madel has what takes some investigation. My old Orange Micro firewire iBot webcam sure is a better vid than the Fusion wish it wasn't a gift. I'd returned it long time ago.
