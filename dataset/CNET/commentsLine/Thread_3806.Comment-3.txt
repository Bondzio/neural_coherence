hard drives are really cheap nowadays.
thats a 500 gb hard drive internal for $115.
if you get that and take out your vista hard drive then install xp on it then you can have both ^^.
im not sure if vista os will detect it and say boot earlier version of windows or not.
i started with xp and went to ista so you might have to find a way to re install vista or get it to detect windows b/c i have a good setup where i can boot xp or vista without messing with any boot bios programs or setting the devise to boot that hdd 1st i just select visto or xp basicly and i can boot either one.
i also reccomend getting partition magic and making a new partition of 20 gb for music/ video and mabye a 5gb partition for document backups if you need it.
i have a partition with music and games and another with win xp and vista ripped so i dont have to worry about my cd and dvd.
i would have tv shows on my music/games partition if my tuner card worked but i gatta get a new one.
a lesson i learned is if you reinstall windows on a factory computer you may lose a device drver for ever and not know where to get it.
i hope this made sense to you and helped.
please reply =d
