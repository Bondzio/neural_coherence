i agree with you on most points..... concerning a .bin what does one use to activate and install...is there an app to use?
i too thought a band was not long for the wifi world but it seems all the new higher end 'puters are incorperating a/b/g capabilities.....i was suprised at the number of laptops(new) that had built in cards that were shall we say tri-band.
i believe that it is like bluetooth, which i have little or no knowledge of......never used.....i do know that it came on the scene and then died out and now is seemingly making a comeback....now it is a lot of places, i think the telephony market liked it and made it their standard.... as far as travelling, i think you are of the impression that i am looking for a band only....this is not the case, i don't expect to find the local coffee shop to have a super g, much less a tri-band card..... all of the non compatability issue revolve around general use...ie b/g/super g.....the a band is for me mainly to use at my primary location.
i hope you understand that my expectations are reasonable.
i certainly don't think the computer industry should comply with my wishes.
i have used the term major on several occasions.... i understand business and that everyone can't comply with products made in someones &quot;garage&quot;...... i appreciate your interest and see that you have a depth of knowledge....that is good.
i get one response from netgear per day so let us see what they have to say tomorrow.... i also have taken several surveys from hp.....maybe they will finally look and respond.... i am just to sit and wait i guess... i know they have other things to do, i just think this is a larger issue.
sometimes it is hard to get people to see the big picture...... happy fourth....are you a vet?
not an animal doctor!!
ha ha ha ....good day....take care howard
