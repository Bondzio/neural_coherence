6683	0	60376	716189	NR	user429	1/26/05 2:28 PM	1.10674968E12	DVD-RW	I have an IBM desktop computer with a CD-RW drive. Can I (or have someone) take out my CD-RW drive and put in a DVD-RW drive and still use my old CDR-RW disks on this DVD-RW drive? I can get 720 MB on my CD-RW disk. How many MB of space can I get on a DVD-RW disk? Thank you very much.
