sorry i wasn't clear.
the ram and motherboard i linked are the ones i'm using in my current system.
i'm not looking at any particular sticks of ram right now, as i don't know what i *can* look for.
current ram (not over-clocked): brand - g.skill model - f3-12800cl7d-4gbhz type - 240-pin ddr3 sdram capacity - 4gb (2 x 2gb) speed - ddr3 1600 (pc3 12800) cas latency - 7 timing - 7-7-7-18 voltage - 1.9v heat spreader - yes as for my motherboard: memory-wise: number of memory slots - 4?240pin memory standard - ddr3 1600 maximum memory supported - 8gb channel supported - dual channel it's easy enough to find matching type, speeds and capacities.
but i'm not sure about the importance of cas latency, timing, or voltage.
