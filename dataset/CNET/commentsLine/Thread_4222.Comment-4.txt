hi, yes, my concern about the returns and refunds is a bit higher than purchasing an imac living in the u.s. i live in central america.
we do not have apple stores over here, only distributors.
their sells and systems have guarantee of course but i will not be purchasing one to them cuz is a lot money to spend.
i want to buy my imac g5 directly from the apple website.
it's good to know that the imac g5 has been updated at least twice and according to your buddies none of them has had any problems with the overheating factor.
that will be my first mac since i wanna change from mac to windows because i'm tired of all the updating thing and spyware, viruses, os inestability, etc.
regarding of the feedback i read, yes, there were some people who had troubles with their mac's cuz of the overheating factor.
of course i will do more reading but i wanted some opinion of this community.
thank you for your help.
