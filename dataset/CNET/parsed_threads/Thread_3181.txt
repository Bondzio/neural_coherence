<s> I have one WRT54G connected to my DSL modem and configured as a Gateway. </s>
<s> I have a computer connected to one of the Gateway's LAN ports and another WRTG54G connected to an other of the Gatway's LAN ports. </s>
<s> The second WRT54G is configured as a Router. </s>
<s> Both are configured with WEP security. </s>
<s> When the computer cabled to the Gateway WRT54G is turned-off, another computer can maintain a flawless, highspeed Internet connection with the WRT54G configured as a Router. </s>
<s> When I turn-on the computer that is cabled to the Gateway, I lose the wireless connection on the WRT54G configured as the Router. </s>
<s> I can get the connection back by re-booting the computer with the wireless connection, but then I lose the Internet connection on the computer cabled to the Gateway. </s>
<s> Basically, I can only have one computer connected to the Internet at any given time. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
