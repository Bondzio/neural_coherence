nice post,dan.
see, i would use an ipad-like device because of the &quot;fun factor&quot;.
i do my &quot;serious&quot; work on my 17&quot; laptop.
only reason i'm not buying an ipad is i don't have any apple products and don't want to convert from sony and microsoft, which is what i've got a boatload of items invested in.
but, i love your positive post.
thank you.
