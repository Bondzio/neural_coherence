hey, i was just recently browsing through tigerdirect when i came across this motherboard.
i looked at the specs and the picture and it seems to be everything i was looking for, for a new motherboard.
it is sli certified, has 4 sata ports, 3 pci slots, socket 775 (compatible with my pentium d), core 2 duo ready, gigabit lan support and 4 dimm sockets that support up to a decent 667mhz ddr2 240 pin memory modules.
what is the downside to this mobo?
what am i overlooking?
is this a reliable brand?
what seperates this mobo from the $600 ones?
is the chipset any good?
if not will it effect graphics performance greatly?
could you send me a link to some other mobos that are better, sli ready and a reasonable price?
the site is tigerdirect.ca so the price is in can dollers.
