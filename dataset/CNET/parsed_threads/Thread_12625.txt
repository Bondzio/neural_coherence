<s> A new SB eax 5.1 surround sound card installed on Intel Pentium III using D:/win XP but multiboot C:/win98SE can't read the installation cd-rom reporting no drivers found at G:/cd-rom drive. </s>
<s> D:/win XP shows the disk as formatted using CDFS (CDFS not equal to NTFS?). </s>
<s> XP has integrated SIS 7018 audio/video driver as central controller; if uninstall driver then no video? </s>
<s> There are other codecs also present on HDD device manager and these were reported to 'creative labs' with registration of product e-mail. </s>
<s> I have no sound and even if driverguide.com has a download in the right format I think system sounds will be absent. </s>
<s> Any replies from the senate please forum members? </s>
<s> CDFS is short for Compact Disc File System. </s>

<s> &quot;C:/win98SE can't read the installation cd-rom reporting no drivers found at G:/cd-rom drive&quot; That's proper. </s>
<s> But means you need to install the dos drivers for the machine's motherboard (most of the time.) </s>
<s> Since you didn't follow the forum NOTE: about what to put in your post we lose the opportunity to offer what driver and where it is in this response. </s>
<s> The same issue about the other drivers. </s>
<s> With some million boards out there and no generic drivers you have to tell us what you have. </s>

<s> I don't know if anybody else has any idea about multiboot systems but mine is C:/98SE Vs D:/winXP. </s>
<s> These o/s' run on an IBM system, a netvista all-in-one destop with onboard stereo (a 217952A) X40i. </s>
<s> The available site support drivers are in place and do not fully configure the sound card, so before the multiple o/s there was no sound. </s>
<s> I now have sound through the daughterboard PCI using headphones, but have no onboard stereo. </s>
<s> It's rediculous to require uninstalling an intergrated driver (ie:sis 7018) to get my new hardware to be able to output system sounds onboard. </s>
<s> I shouldn't need the new hardware in the first place, the old hardware's in perfectly good order, it just needs the right software. </s>
<s> If the big guys up there could trust each other maybe we little guys would actually get what we pay for, it's driving me crazy. </s>
