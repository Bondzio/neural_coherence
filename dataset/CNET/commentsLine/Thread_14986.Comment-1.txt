i'm thinking about building my own computer (basically, a new mobo, cpu, ram and ps), and basically want to just move everything over from the old one (dvd drive/ cd-rw).
but, would it be possible to move the old hd (with os and programs on it) over to the new mobo and have it still work, or would i need a new/blank hd?
