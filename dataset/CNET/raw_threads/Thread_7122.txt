I saw 2, a Gateway LT2104u and an Asus 115PEB-RRED01S. The Asus is about $20 more. The specs look about the same with the ASUS appartently having longer battery life. I asked the Geek squad guy which was better and he said the Gateway. Any ideas out there on the forum? Both have the same processor and 250gb hard drives. The ASUS says it has IntelUMA Graphics, teh Gateway says it has Intel 3150 accelerator. Anyway, let me know your thoughts.
