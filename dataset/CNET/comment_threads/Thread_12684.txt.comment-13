One of thje critical dimensions is the depth.
It has to be 80mm or less as the back of the case to the processor heatsink is 80mm.
The GTA PSU is 86mm.
It looks like I'll have to try and get one from MSI.
Thanks for the help though.
I'll start polling the ebay.com as well as ebay.co.uk, might turn up something.
