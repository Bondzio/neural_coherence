well, thanks for all the help guys ... the firewall was modified to only allow my two computers to be in the trusted zone.
i attempted pinging each to the other pc and it was successful.
however, now, i can see only my workgroup computer for the me machine only on the me machine and the shared folders i set up.
but, on xp, no folders at all when i try to view the workgroup, not even the xp machine is shown.
instead, i get an error like &quot;can't access, not allowed to see computers on this network..&quot; or something like that.
is that due to not allowing ptp networking?
if so, should i try the above fix?
thanks.
