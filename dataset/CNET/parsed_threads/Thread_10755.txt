<s> I have an older proprietary HP P2 mobo standard atx form factor that has no agp, however there are provisions for one on the board. </s>

<s> I am thinking of installing a slot on this board myself. </s>
<s> The board has an onboard agp, but the bios has no setting to disable it. </s>
<s> What would happen if I did this? </s>
<s> You would be the first to make such work that I would know of. </s>
<s> It's your board, your choice and your roll of the dice. </s>

<s> Even as a embedded hardware designer, getting all the proper parts and more would test my patience and certainly I would not do it. </s>
