The way I chose to do it was by acquiring two Pentium II Overdrive Processors(PODP66X333 SL2KE). These Overdrive Processors will effectively raise the speed of my system from 200mhz to 333mhz. The problem I'm having is that the Processors did not come with Heatsinks and Fans. I've searched ebay, spoken to a rep from Sanyo-Denki, and Googled till I'm about to Girgle. Can anyone help? I'm including the following link which shows a really good image of the Heatsink & Fan attached to the Processor. http://www.cpu-collection.de/?l0=i&i=1814&s=big&tb=1&n=1&sd=0

Find some typical fans than have 3-ear mounting brackets. Aren't there any used outlets in your area? Here's a outlet center than may help or not: http://www.allelectronics.com/ -OR- similar websites, used, off-lease returns, etc. Also, check with modding websites that custom fit all sorts of items. Query there and maybe follow-up on some links they provides. Here's a quick modder link: http://www.overclockers.com tada -----Willy
