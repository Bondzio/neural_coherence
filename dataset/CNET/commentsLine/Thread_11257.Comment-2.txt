at my site, this page  it relates directly to what you are asking although the information is for voice band frequencies.
power, loss, and capacitance is the same in all twisted wire environments.
you might get high speeds on short runs.
but routing, external interference, gauge of the wire, etc.
affect performance.
try it on short runs.
if you have problems, repull the wire.
