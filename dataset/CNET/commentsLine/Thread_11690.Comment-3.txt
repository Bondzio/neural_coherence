the trendnet router and adapter card both offer wpa2 and wpa.
i am using wpa because i just couldn't get everything to work when i tried to set up wpa2.
i would however like to have that option with whatever wireless adapter i end up with.
i am assuming that if the router i have is &quot;54mbps&quot; i would have to get an adapter with the same mbps?
a higher mbps would not have an advantage?
or would i need to know what my service provider is?
