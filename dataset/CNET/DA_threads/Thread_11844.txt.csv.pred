1.1.1	I am considering buying a white macbook soon, $1300 version, and was wondering what kind of difference upgrading from 1 to 2 gigs of RAM would make.	St
1.1.2	I will be using all the iLife programs, maybe some video editing, DVD watching, and maybe some gaming (obviously not new games, I know it has a bad vid card.)	St
1.1.3	I was just wondering what affect the upgrade would have (it is $175) and if you think it's worth it.	St
1.1.4	Also, do you think a bigger hard drive (120 gig) for $150 is worth it?	St
1.1.5	Thanks!	St
1.1.6	P.S.	St
1.1.7	Please no &quot;just get a pro&quot; or anything of that nature.	St
1.1.8	Thanks again!	St
1.2.1	More RAM is usually More better!	St
1.2.2	If you do not have a problem with the extra cash, a 120GB would be fine for what you have described.	St
1.2.3	Remember though that an external Firewire drive would have a larger storage space for less money.	St
1.2.4	The drive would also be a full sized on running at 72000 rpm and probably a larger cache than is on the internal.	St
1.2.5	That video card is not exactly bad, just not as good as it could have been.	St
1.2.6	P	St
