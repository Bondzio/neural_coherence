Thanks for the reply.
I am still digging into this.. was at my dealer today and I suggested the Gigabyte boards with the 965 chipset might be what I want.. he said they had all been recalled for chip defects, and they were not expecting any new boards for at least a month.
Another discussion I read about the Intel boards was that they needed an upgrade, and it could only be done with an older CPU installed... then, they could plug the new CPU in to run.
Sounds weird.
Anyway, my dealer said the E6600 CPU is way backlogged.. they won't be getting shipment til then end of September.
Even then, only a handful are destined for Canada..
I had to give them a deposit to be put on the wait list.
So, I guess I have some time to research mobos.
