<s> I'm not looking for speed. </s>
<s> I'm looking for power and heat. </s>
<s> 65mm intel is generally better than 90mm prescott I've heard. </s>
<s> I can keep my computer running cooler and quieter. </s>
<s> But I can't decide between a Pentium D915 and a P4 631. </s>
<s> Forget about speed and cache, etc. </s>
<s> But the 915 is 95W and the other I found is 65w. </s>
<s> I found a 65w version. </s>
<s> Is the 30 watt difference enough to make my pc hotter. </s>
<s> Or 65mm is better in general and watts don't matter. </s>
<s> thanks, confusimo </s>
<s> but this is a close comparison. </s>
<s> Click on various benchmarks to get a generalized view of there performance. </s>
<s> If you have special needs, maybe gaming, then run these comparisons as well. </s>
<s> check with the Intel web site most processors have special abilities that set them apart from one another. </s>
<s> Enhanced speed step for instance. </s>
<s> Generally dual cores are better then P4s because they process nearly twice the information that a single core does. </s>
<s> This thread is untracked </s>
<s> the CPU and what do you use the PC for mostly ? </s>
<s> I'm talking about heat. </s>
<s> Not use and budget. </s>
<s> Does more power Watts make more heat. </s>
<s> Or is the 65nm just more efficient than 90nm and 30watts is to little to make heat. </s>
<s> nobody is fimiliar with power. </s>
<s> Anyhow I just won a 65w model on ebay so we'll see I guess. </s>

<s> altho workload makes all the difference in heat dissipation. </s>
<s> Congratulations on your win. </s>
<s> does the power consumption really enter anyone's mind (not me)? </s>
<s> If one run into a heat problem then we just have to come up with a better cooling system. </s>
<s> Cooling is fine. </s>
<s> Prescott Celeron D goes as low as 36c degrees. </s>
<s> So I'm good now. </s>
<s> But in order to keep it at that I to have turn all the fans at full blast and its very noisy and not to mention cold. </s>
<s> But lower watts means less power and less heat. </s>
<s> And I can put all my fans on low as soon I get the other cpu ands switch. </s>
<s> Won't be as noisy. </s>
<s> And computer won't need to work so hard to cool. </s>

<s> my cpu runs at 20c idle and 30c light duty stuff. </s>
<s> its 170$. </s>
<s> because its 65w and 65nm. </s>
<s> So it's just more powerfull. </s>
<s> But mine should cool the same. </s>
<s> Just not as powerfull. </s>
<s> It finally arrived. </s>
<s> Its a Pentium 4 631. </s>
<s> It's SL9KG according to the box. </s>
<s> I forgot to look at the cpu. </s>
<s> But it says so on the box. </s>
<s> But its says 65nm according to cpuid.com. </s>
<s> Anyhow this thing is awesome. </s>
<s> It says 18 - 20 c degrees in speedfan. </s>
<s> And bios says about 25c degrees idol. </s>
<s> Not bad. </s>
<s> And I even turned down all the fans. </s>
<s> to low setting and I'm still getting those great temps. </s>
<s> Pretty cool for just a cpu change and nothing else. </s>
<s> Thanks, ivnj </s>
