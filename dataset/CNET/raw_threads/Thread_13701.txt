A free city-wide wifi service, which is actually pretty good, I live 2 houses away from a hub. 2. I also have a Playstation 3, which recognizes the &quot;MetroFi&quot; signal but cannot connect b/c there is a login page when you first access the internet on a computer. 3. I was told by a MetroFi volunteer that I have to pull in the free Metro-Fi signal, through a wireless router (I have a Linksys Wireless Router that wifi'ed my old Comcast connection). Then the PS3 will be able to read it. How can I accomplish this?! I have a Mac, fwiw. please let me know if I can explain further.

2727	4	284764	2709680	2709672	wookie3	2/20/08 1:15 PM	1.2035133E12	still no comprendo	Thank you for helping Bob, but I just dont understand what you're trying to say. You write in a cryptic manner. Everything is wifi ready...my router, Mac and PS3. It was all working fine when I had Comcast High-Speed, but obviously it came into my house as ethernet, then I routed it to the Linksys Wireless Router, which my PS3 was able to pick up.

It's a http://www.netgear.com/Products/PrintServers/WirelessPrintServers/WGPS606.aspx This device connects to some wifi WAP and then it's clients don't have to do anything as to logins. I can also connect one of those ports to the wan port of a router and viola, I have something just like your normal wifi router connected to broadband. I know what you want to do but I don't know if you have the hardware. Maybe you wanted to use a PC but didn't tell. I could note &quot;ICS&quot; but with all the web docs about that I won't copy those here. Bob

Also, please confirm that you can connect to MetroFi with your existing Mac. Generally, what is needed to connect a wireless network to your home network is an Ethernet Bridge MetroFi wireless cloud &lt;-wireless-&gt; Wireless Ethernet Bridge &lt;-ethernet-&gt; home LAN router with Ethernet ports and/or wireless WANport If the home LAN router has both both wireless capability and ethernet LAN ports, you can connect to that router with _either_ wireless _or_ ethernet cable on both* your PS3 and your Mac. *Wireless LAN connections assumes that your PS3 and Mac have wireless capability built in (or added as an option.) One _example_ of a wireless ethernet bridge is Buffalo Technology AirStation Turbo G High Power Wireless Ethernet Converter (WLI-TX4-G54HP) But for the same cost, I would just buy the Ruckus Wireless solution that MetroFi features. Ruckus MM2211

I went to Frys in Wilsonville for an external antenna that had been advertised in a MetroFi Internet ad several months ago. A helpful clerk convinced me to buy a different external antenna and two 15-foot booster cables. I plugged the booster cable from the antenna into my laptops USB port. I disabled my laptops internal modem so I could use the IEEE wireless USB utility. Now, I open the double-pane window and set the antenna outside to receive a strong signal (85-95%) inside my apartment. I leave the window open just enough for the cable, and I can have the laptop on a desk across the room. Not very wireless, but it is free. Otherwise, I have to sit outside on my balcony to get MetroFi.
