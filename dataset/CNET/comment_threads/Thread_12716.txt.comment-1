Hello.
I just replaced my Comcast rental modem with a Motorola SB6141.
I called Comcast to have them add it to my services.
This worked fine, and I am able to connect a computer via ethernet to my new modem with no problem.
However, when I go to connect a router to it I get no internet signal.
Are there any addition step(s) that I need to take to get my router to work?
Any help is greatly appreciated.
Thanks.
