AMD Athlon 64 3000+ Venice 90nm (Socket 939 OR AMD Athlon 64 3200+ Venice 90nm (Socket 939) * there is a 20 step in price (that's like $39) * would be be worth getting the more expensive one? * would I notice a difference in gaming?

That slight difference in CPU speeds should be third. So put the money in the video card if you have it. Check with OZOS on which card.

I've no idea about overclocking	If .. 3000+ &gt; 3200+ 3200+ &gt; 3400 I might go with he 3200+, not sure though ... I am planing on ANOTHER PC build so if I did get a 3000+ I could later get a 3200+ and pop the 3000+ in me older one!

Take a look at AMD systems at WWW.gogocomputers.com in the $899. range to give you an idea.... the video card could be improved to the nvidia 6800 series and the hard drive could be changed to a Hitachi for improve hard drive response..... thats what I would do hands down.... I was skeptical of Hitachi harddrives until I bought a 160 gig unit 7K250 Deskstar not expensive but performance dripping... maybe investigate further .... system startups and file transfers were reduced in regards to time .... you may ask what do I reference this to? Maxtor, Western digital, Quantum, Fugitsu and Seagate used on my family system building..... Do the research with the net ... Google it , use TomsHardwareCorner, etc. hope this is of help .....

It can be done just by using a user-friendly software utility like this one: http://www.guru3d.com/rivatuner/ CPU OCing is tricky, and you really shouldn't do it, espeically for AMD processors. Sometimes, it can end up with higher clock rate, but lower performance.

This comes without a fan, so you'll have to supply your own. Tigerdirect.com is the best place to buy anything, so buy it from there. But the reason you want to buy the 3200 over the 3000 is because the 3200 is the most easily overclocked chipset in the WORLD!!!! You can take this in-exspensive $190 procesor and overclock it to 2.6 GHZ!!!! Yes, thats right the 3200 can be as powerful as the $900 clawhammer fx55 chipset. So the answer is buy the Venice 3200 (939 socket) with the ASUS delux SLI motherboard (future profing) and and NVIDIA 6800 GT. OR go with a nice DFY motherboard. Hope it was helpful.
