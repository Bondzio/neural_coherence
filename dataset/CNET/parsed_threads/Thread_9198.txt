<s> hello, i would like set up a wireless connection with a friend of mine who lives about 20km away. </s>
<s> I would like to know which antenna's I should get and how to set them up. </s>
<s> There is a clear line of sight from my house to his. </s>
<s> The connection will be for file transfer and gaming, so it needs to be quite fast. </s>
<s> any advice would be appreciated </s>
<s> Going that distance gets to be a professional project very quickly since there are many factors involved. </s>
<s> This antenna is one of the largest you can get. </s>
<s> It will not be the antenna that costs the money though. </s>
<s> http://www.wlanparts.com/product/HDGD24-24P-NF/24-GHz-24dBi-Heavy-Duty-Grid-parabolic-dish-N-Female.html You now have the problem of what do you attach to the antenna. </s>
<s> You can either buy expensive microwave cable to bring the signal inside to a cheap router/radio or you can buy a expensive waterproof router/radio to mount outside on the antenna. </s>
<s> For performance reasons you are better off mounting the electronics on the back of the antenna. </s>
<s> Does not help a lot if you buy a huge antenna and then lose all the signal in the cabling. </s>
<s> If you are handy people do mount consumer routers outside in home made enclosures but it does not work well if you live in a area where the sun will cook the electronics in the summer. </s>
<s> You will want electronics that has the greatest transmit power and best sensitivity to receive. </s>
<s> Be aware there are legal limits on how much power you can transmit which varies from country to country and type of antenna. </s>
<s> You also want to be up as high as you possible can. </s>
<s> When you go the distance you are talking about the ground tends to absorb signal. </s>
<s> thanks, we both live on opposite sides of a valley so we are pretty high off the ground. </s>
<s> i can mount the antenna in a shaded area, side of my house which should remove the problem of the sun. </s>
<s> Can you please tell me what hardware we will need on both ends to make it work. </s>
<s> like router's bridge's etc and how to set them up. </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=20km+wifi It appears you could take advantage of prior discussions. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> LOL sorry, didn't check for that. </s>
<s> did a search on other things and didn't find much. </s>
<s> thanks </s>
