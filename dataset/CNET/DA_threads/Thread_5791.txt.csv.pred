1.1.1	I recently purchased the Netgear MA111 wireless adapter , as well as Netgear 's wireless router .	St
1.1.2	The router works fine w/ the computer when the computer was plugged into it via ethernet cable .	St
1.1.3	However , when I try to access the internet w/ the USB adapter only , it does not work .	St
1.1.4	I spoke with Netgear 's tech support and we ran ipconfig which seemed to indicate the existence of the internet .	St
1.1.5	Nevertheless , I could not access any site including the config site for the router .	St
1.1.6	Also , I am running Windows 98SE .	St
1.1.7	Thanks , Corey	St
1.2.1	If the product is non-functional , it may be best to pack it up and try another product .	St
1.2.2	You may have issues with USB or did n't follow their install notes .	St
1.2.3	http : //www.usbman.com has many posts where the USB devices are plugged in before the drivers or the motherboard drivers are not installed and USB problems ( just like yours ) begin .	St
1.2.4	I read no mention of details on your part about removal of the Ethernet card , setting the mode of the USB Wifi and more .	St
1.2.5	This lack of information leads me to think that returning the product will save you a lot of work .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	The ethernet card is integrated in the laptop .	St
1.3.2	I am not sure how I would remove it .	Res
1.3.3	I did install the driver prior to inserting the adapter .	St
1.3.4	Based on this information , do you think it is still more likely that the product is defective ?	Ques
1.3.5	Is this a common occurrence ?	Ques
1.3.6	Thanks , Corey	St
1.4.1	You can use the Device Manager to disable the network card so Windows wo n't try to remember it and use it instead of the WiFi card .	St
1.4.2	The product is indeed defective if the instructions did n't work for you .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	Good luck getting any help with Netgear 's 3rd World support people or the & quot ; slim & quot ; documention that comes with their products .	St
1.5.2	That said , I got my Netgear system up and running in 2 days mostly by myself .	St
1.5.3	I 'm not familar with the USB wireless unit that you 're using with your laptop .	St
1.5.4	I 'm running the WG511 PC card and it works fine .	St
1.5.5	Perhaps you should go that route instead .	St
1.6.1	I hear the problems do n't exist with the PC card , and I may return my USB adapter for the PC card one .	St
1.6.2	Any suggestions for a quick fix to get it to work ?	Ques
1.6.3	There must be some reason - albeit minorly complicated and laborious - involving configuration .	St
1.6.4	AND I know the adapter works - I tried it on an XP laptop	St
