I posted this to find out if their were any products people would recommend, obviously cisco would say that the 11501 switch is the obvious route.
A co-worker and myself have come up w/ a product that will do the job, turns out we've decided not to go w/ Cisco.
I really appreciate the time and effort that you put into your exstensive and highly detailed reponse Bob.
Seems to me it was delivered in a mocking manner.
I was on the phone w/ Nortel and Cisco yesterday for about an hour a piece.
