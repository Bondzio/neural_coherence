As I said, I downloaded and burnt the 93a minime ISO.
And at first, everthing seemed fine.
I verifed the MD5 checksum, then tried a normal boot.
Everything looked fine, but after running through all the setup without visible error, it &quot;booted&quot; into a blank grey screen and sat there doing nothing.
So I tried booting it into RAM with noapci and nolapci (sp?).
That did exactly the same thing.
Can you offer any assistance, or should I try getting Knoppix instead, or what?
