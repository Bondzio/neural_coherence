1.1.1	i was wondering if the following was good for a basically mild gaming, then some multitasking.	St
1.1.2	and if everything was compatable, etc.	St
1.1.3	thanks in advance...the parts are listed below Case - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16811144151 Motherboard - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813131569 CPU - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16819103531 Power supply - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817174023 CPU cooler - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16835118223 Hard Drive - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16822148103 Graphics card - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?item=N82E16814130071	St
1.2.1	You're forgetting the memory.	St
1.2.2	BTW, that's not what i would consider a budget pc with a 8800gts.	St
1.2.3	You might want to get the socket am2 instead of socket 939.	St
1.3.1	i really wouldnt call getting a 8800gt a &quot;mild&quot; gaming pc because that GPU is for people that like gaming and are preparing for directx10 hope this helps	St
1.4.1	if you are doing mild gaming, you don't need that nice a graphics card.	St
1.4.2	infact, you would be fine with agp or maybe even integrated graphics.	St
1.4.3	a pny vetro 6600 (not gt) 256 agp card will do fine.	St
1.4.4	I have one in an older computer and it can run halo, counterstrike, ect, and unless your playing batlefield 2 or something you'll be fine.	St
1.4.5	This will also save you some $ on the motherboard, but good call on the asus.	St
1.4.6	stay with that brand.	St
1.4.7	KEY part missing.	St
1.4.8	ram.	St
1.4.9	get 1 gig of fairly fast ram and you should be fine.	Sug
1.4.10	and finaly you don't need a 3800+ proccessor.	St
1.4.11	a 3200+ will suit your needs perfectly.	St
1.4.12	trust me.	St
1.4.13	i have tested many products, and you'll be fine with these.	St
