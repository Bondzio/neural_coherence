Hi all, I've been wondering how is the reliability of Acer Desktop Computers these days.
Are people that have them happy with their purchase.
Any issues?
I'm looking to get a new computer (nothing major) and the price that I'm seeing here and there seems ok.
I'm looking around the web and it's hard to have a clear picture as to how their desktops are.
Thx for the info
