hello folks, my new year started with a weird virus infecting the system and telling me that my hdd is crashing, ram temp too high etc.
it blocked my access to all files.
i booted my pc with usb linux and copied all files to external hdd.
now i restored pc to factory defaults but this hdd health is haunting me.
i ran hdtune but i don't understand the results.
i have uploaded screenshots at  i will be very thankful if somebody could read it and let me know if i have a reason to worry.
i really don't want hdd fail on me so if there is any sign, i would like to replace hdd rightaway.
the laptop is about 2 years old.
hdd is not making any weird noise but it has happened that when i am working on it, my toddler may lightly hit a laptop and it would warn me with a popup that it has parked hdd head to a safe location.and i have never had any issue with corrupt file or something else like that.
many thanks in advance.
