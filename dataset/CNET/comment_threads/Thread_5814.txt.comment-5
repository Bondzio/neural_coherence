ok so i updated all drivers - ( did not reload windows tho...) and every thing looked fine so i ran Medieval total war on full with texture up max etc.
the game played well for an hour then began to lag.
i rebooted but now i cant get windows to fully start - it hand just before or just after my screensaver comes up... i also wanted to check if my water cooling was working on the cpu so after i unpluigged power etc i tester the temp of the water block with my finger and i was cool however the ram was boiling !
would this be resolved by windows reload or should i attempt f8a bios flash ?!
?
