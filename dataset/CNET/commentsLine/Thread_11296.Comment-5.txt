i'm glad you sorted it all out.
remember the &quot;ink monitoring pgm.&quot; is nothing more than estimate or approx.
of ink level.
defeating or ignoring the new ink cart install(align.)
starts sometimes this issue and/or get out of whack and keeps wanting attention.
even if not displayed, it has become a sore spot.
i wish the times i could carry another system with me on calls as laptop sits at home.
tada -----willy
