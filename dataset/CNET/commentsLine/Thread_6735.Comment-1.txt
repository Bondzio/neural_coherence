i have a problem with my emachines t5026.
from the day that i buy it, sometimes it shut down itself without previous warning or just because it want to.
for instance, today i was listening to music and in the internet when suddenly it shut down and reboot, and after reboot no window with a warning or to send a feed back to microsoft appeared.
yesterday happen too, i was downloading a program when the computer shut down.
this happens to me with my other emachine but in the other computer it was a problem of overheat because of the fan, but now i touch the fan in the back and they are working also there is no smel of like something on fire that happen to me with the other computer.
please somebody help me with a solution or some good software that can tell me what is happening in my computer.
