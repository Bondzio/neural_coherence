If that isn't possible because you really screwed it up, check your motherboard manual on how to manually reset it via jumpers on the motherboard. May I remark that it is not clear from your post what exactly you changed, let alone why you changed it. All you tell is &quot;i changes of on the board configure (both) to primary&quot; and, sorry to say, that's un-understandable. Kees

Changes to the bios don't keep for these reasons either they're way off(OC'ing?) or not saved upon exiting the bios area. If the problem persists, then be sure the bios/CMOS battery is OK, just put in a new one. A P4 system is a dated system as your post offers no real info, I can suspect you're rebuilding from old parts or re-using some. Do that and check results. For more detailed help, post your system specs. tada -----Willy

If that's true, then the problem is hardware, not the OS. Strip down (unplug everything except 1 stick of ram, cpu, psu, and video) and test the usual culprits. If needed, the motherboard should have a couple pins you jumper together to reset the CMOS or something similar to get back to default BIOS. No disrespect intended, but might get better help from a forum in one's native language.
