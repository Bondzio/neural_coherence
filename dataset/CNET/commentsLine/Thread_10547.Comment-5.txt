i have a card picked out already, why?
because i'm still in agp.
this is what my question is about: i have an old system, hence my: 2 gb pc3200 single channel memory pny verto 7600 gs agp pentium d dual core @ 3.4 ghz i do not have any pci-e slots, and i'm wondering is: what kind of gain (fps) i would get playing games like call of duty 4, rainbow six: vegas, and left4dead, and other newer game out by replacing my 7600 gs with an hd3850.
why am i wondering this?
: i've been told that since my outdated single channel memory can't feed info to my cpu (vice versa) fast enough, i'm already severely limiting myself.
however, since i'm a heavy gamer, the best agp card out (sapphire hd3850 agp) might help me get higher fps.
i've ran benchmarks and i'm pretty sure my gpu is the weakest link, however, 2 gb of single channel and a pentium d @ 3.4 ghz isn't too hot either.
so bascially: considering my current specs, how much of a gain in fps would i get with a sapphire hd3850 agp
