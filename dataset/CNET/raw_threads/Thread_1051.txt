I got a new one to transfer what I could (which was everything) after installing windows vista. Now I've reformatted the drive and scanned it again and now it says everything is fine. My question is it fine? The bad sectors aren't just being hidden are they?

And look at the spare count. Here's links about it -&gt; http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=smart+hard+drive+reporting Now about your questions. You are right to ask but without the actual drive and it's smart report before, during and now we can't tell more than if Windows burped and called it bad and a fresh format did wonders or not. By the way. The entire industry was under a lot of pressure years ago as consumers would return a drive with a bad sector. Something had to be done so SMART, sector spares and such all were done almost entirely to get the consumer off the industry's back. Yes the industry tried to explain how 1 bad sector in a multi gigabyte drive didn't make it a bad drive. Consumers didn't want that drive! Bob

68	5	348223	3072644	3072636	R. Proffitt	7/2/09 2:33 PM	1.24654518E12	Looks to be an old drive.	Too bad all the details are not here. For example that DeathStar drive would have me change my replies.
68	6	348223	3072672	3072644	zero1221	7/2/09 3:12 PM	1.24654752E12	This is my hard drive.	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136319 It's only 3 months old. Are there any other details needed? Also what does &quot;For example that DeathStar drive would have me change my replies.&quot; I don't quite understand what your saying there.

68	8	348223	3072710	3072689	zero1221	7/2/09 4:26 PM	1.24655196E12	Ok...	I'll do that.
