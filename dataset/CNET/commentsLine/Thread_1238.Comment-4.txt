as you are getting vista 64, i'll write that you have to check if your games, printers and such are supported by that.
is the motherboard.
yes it has a pcie x16 slot.
let's find the power supply rating.
it's a 300 watt psu so if you go too far out you'll have to replace that.
this leads me to suggest the lower power video cards from this list -&gt;  &quot;the radeon hd 4670 slaps previous generation high-end performance squarely in the jaw of mid-range pricing.
with 320 shader processors, this card means business, and will provide awesome 1600x1200 gaming.
compared to the 9600 gso, its main advantage is a low power requirement.
it doesnt need an external power cable, which for some upgraders is a really important feature.&quot; unless you want to change the psu, i'd shop this card.
