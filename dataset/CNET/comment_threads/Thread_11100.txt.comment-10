I understand most of the logic in your diagram, but is it really necessary to have a router and a switch on both ends?
Can't you still hook up your wired computers to the ports on the routers?
Also, does Router #2 have to be configured so as not to interfere with the main router's function?
Do you have to disable the DHCP function of router #2?
Do you have to change the default local address?
Can't you just use a switch in that position?
