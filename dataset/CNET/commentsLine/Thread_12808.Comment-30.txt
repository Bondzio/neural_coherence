before you buy a dell, hp or any other pre-made machine ask yourself this: who's hard drive is in the machine?
whos video card is in the machine?
who's ram, what is the power supply wattage and whos is in it?
who's motherboard is in the machine, what is the upgradablity of the machine?
if you can find out the answers to all of that and you are happy that the parts are from quality manufacturers and have good ratings (doubtful) then buy the machine from dell, hp or whoever.
if you cant get the answer to that then build your own.
yes it may cost you a few bucks more, and yes there will be no customer support ( even when you buy it most customer support centers dissapoint anyway) so i guess in that area you are really even you are just paying for it when you need it rather then pre-paying for it.
if you build your own or have it built for you, you can tell them exactly what manufacaturer part is to go into your machine.
in the long run you will end up with a much better machine in my opinion.
