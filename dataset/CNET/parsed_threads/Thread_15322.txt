<s> The PC was dropped while moving and has been able to detect the O/S since. </s>
<s> I replaced the hard drive already, but it still just pulls up the gateway logo and then black screen. </s>
<s> Is this a problem with the board or the CPU, or is it a simply a procedural problem with the boot sequence still trying to boot the O/S from an empty HD. </s>
<s> Thanks, Jim </s>
<s> to mention that I am trying to boot O/S from disk, it won't detect anything. </s>
