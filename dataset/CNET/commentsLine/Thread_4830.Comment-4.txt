i see that you are using a (very) small hard-drive; it's a well-known fact that the bigger the hard-drive the faster a computer will run.
with vista 64 (i have it myself), i wouldn't use anything under 500 gb.
&quot;unknown ram&quot; go to the asus website and check their qvl for compatible ram for your mobo, using 'cheapo' ram will also cause instability issues.
lastly, if you're going to buy a sound card, don't get a 'cheapo'; go down to your local computer parts store (newegg if you have one), and get a decent one there.
a 'cheapo' sound card can add to the stability problem; and, at the same time may not be compatible with vista (if the problem still persists using the new sound card, you can always return it).
