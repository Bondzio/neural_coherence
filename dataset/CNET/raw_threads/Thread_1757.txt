I primarily use a MacBook throughout the rest of the house and now would like to set up printers. I have two printers that I would like to connect to this network and I'm not sure how or even if its possible to set it up how I would like to. I would like to keep one printer (b/w Canon) in the home office and place the other printer (color Canon) on another floor, to be the primary use printer. I would like to be allow both computers to access either printer depending on whether the job requires b/w or color printing without having to go up & down for access to the printers. I bought a Netgear wireless print server but am wondering if I should return it since the diagram/instructions call for both printers to connect via USB to the server. Can someone tell me if its possible to set up my home wireless network this way and if so, what is the proper equipment needed?

The desktop PC uses a USB hub to connect it to the b/w Canon printer as well as a Scanner and an external hard drive. I'm hoping that being a little more specific about what kind of equipment I already have helps you help me?!?
