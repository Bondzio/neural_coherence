hello all, i am having challenges with accessing webmail and downloading e-mail from that account on my lenovo t61 wirelessly.
i have vista 32b with 140g hd.
i did update my system yesterday to connect to a wireless hot spot within one of my offices and had no problems at that time.
it was not until i arrived at another office the challenges started.
i have tried doing a restore to no avail, as it fails.
i am able to get e-mail and access webmail from other computers, so i know it is up and working.
any other suggestions or tricks for me to try in order to resolve this?
thanks..
