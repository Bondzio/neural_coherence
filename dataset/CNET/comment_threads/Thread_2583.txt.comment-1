For a couple of days now our monitor resolution and color looks like safe mode and we can't change it.
In Settings, Control Panel, Display, Settings we have 2 choices... 16 color or 2 color.
Shouldn't there be more?
I don't know what we had to begin with.
We did some &quot;clean up&quot; of old programs from Control Panel, Add/Remove Programs... maybe we dumped something by accident that caused this?
We're have an HP Pavilion with Win 98.
Any help is appreciated!
