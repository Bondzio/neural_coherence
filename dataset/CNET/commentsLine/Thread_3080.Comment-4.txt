there is no firewall software running on the new comp .
.
.
again, i can access it as a remote desktop using tight vnc but no access to any folders, not even public ones, the network resouce is not available.
is there a trick to which user id i use to configure the workgroup name?
the computer knows it's on the workgroup but won't allow any access to it.
probably somthing simple i am missing --fj
