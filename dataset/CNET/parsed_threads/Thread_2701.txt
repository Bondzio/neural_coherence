<s> Hi, i bought a new memory slot for my old PC and installed it it worked well , but when i installed my old memory slot with the new one the windows stopped and a blue screen appear which says that windows stopped to not cause some damage ,but the old memory slot was working well before i installed it with the new one they are the same module and the same speed sorry about my english </s>
<s> I'd talk to those that know your machine and see what they think. </s>
<s> I have some ideas but for now can't give advice with only this story. </s>

<s> And clicking it takes me to http://imageshack.us/f/62/4ia.png/ and 404 not found. </s>
<s> The p4m800 is many years old so for now my advice is a good cleaning, replace all heatsink compound, check fans and if the PSU is over 4 years old, replace that with same rating but add 100 more Watts. </s>
<s> The reason why is well discussed but given the lack of detail in this discussion I have to move to the usual answer for an old PC. </s>
