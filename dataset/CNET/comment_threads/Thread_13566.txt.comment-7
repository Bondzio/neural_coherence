Hi Scott: I've recently experienced the same issue with a Soyo PIII Sy 7IS2 board.
This board was in use for only 2.5 years when the machine started freezing abruptly.
I discovered 3 domed capacitors on the board.
By far the easiest fix is to simply replace the board.
(with another brand) I have also discovered that these older boards are not easy to locate.
Newegg has a Tyan Tomcat i815T (Celeron/PIII)that will work for me.
Best of Luck
