thanks for your suggestion.
all have the same workgroup and have file/printer sharing installed.
not only did i disable the firewall, i uninstalled trend micro pc-cillin (you should uninstall any 3rd party software, not just disable it as i was told) on all the computers and rebooted them.
now all 3 computers are visible in workgroup computers on all computers, however the wireless xp home dell only shows the dell's shared folders.
the xp pro shuttle and the xp home gateway (hard wired nic's) shows each others shared folders but not the dell's.
getting closer...
