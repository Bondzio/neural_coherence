i am trying to do something similar, but mine is for my house.
i currently have 3 computers on line (network) and will be adding 2 more.
i am using a belkin n+ wireless router.
this allows me to plug via usb 2.0 into the router and the storage devise is linked into the other computers.
i am currentlyn using windows vista 64bit as the main computer and have been having trouble finding an external nas hard drive.
as recently as today though i believe i have found the cavalry # cand3002to 1tb external hard drive nas which is compatable.
i called cavalry today and they said it is.
buy.com has it on sale for 262.99 w/ free s/h.
best price i found.
i am a novice at all this also, but i do my research.
i have networked my house on my own and i am very pleased with the belkin n+.
i might add that my home is 4 stories with the router located on the third with no probs.
let me know if you think its good for u or you see something better.
i always like to be sure.
p.s.
i got the router for about 90.00. all together u should be able to hook up for around 350.00. good luck
