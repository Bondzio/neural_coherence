1.3.1	Thank you Jackintucson , It has been & quot ; no no & quot ; area thus far , but I am going to try it and shall report.There is an & quot ; Audio device & quot ; in the & quot ; Features Setup Page of the BIOS Setup Utility , which enable /disable onboard AC'97 audio chip whatever it means .	St
1.3.2	I have tried once before , unsuccessfully , to update the BIoS once before , but could not find the correct number of the M/B on the Matsonic web site , this time I shall persist a bit more .	St
1.3.3	Thanks for help .	St
1.3.4	Thank you very much .	Polite

1.4.1	Yes the AC'97 is the onboard sound .	St
1.4.2	set it to disable , then save and exit the BIOS .	St
1.4.3	If you are not having any problems with your computer that an updated BIOS is supposed to fix , leave it alone .	St
1.4.4	You do not have to upgrade your BIOS to go into it and make simple changes such as disabling audio .	St
1.4.5	You can be in a big mess if something goes wrong during a BIOS update .	St
1.4.6	If you like to learn , when you have time , do a Google search on BIOS upgrading in general , and go to your motherboard manufacturer 's web site in particu ; lar , and learn about it ( including possible recovery options if it goes bad ) before you attempt it .	St
