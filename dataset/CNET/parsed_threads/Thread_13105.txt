<s> I went to turn on my computer the other day and when it was booting nothing came on my screen....I immediately thought it was a graphics card issue. </s>
<s> When I looked at the power button on my tower, it was just flashing and my computer system was not doing anything. </s>
<s> I have an 1.1 gig Athlon...Any suggestions would be GREATLY appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> &quot;When I looked at the power button on my tower, it was just flashing and my computer system was not doing anything.&quot; Considering this is about all that is known besides that it's an 1.1 GHz Athlon, I'd only be guessing that you'll have to repair the machine. </s>
<s> Typically you strip it down to motherboard, CPU/HSF, power supply and a speaker and hope that it beeps. </s>
<s> If no beeps then you are looking at the four possible bad parts. </s>

<s> A flashing power button usually means the system is in standby mode. </s>
<s> Holding the power button in until it shuts off, then powering back up will usually fix this. </s>
