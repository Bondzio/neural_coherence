1.1.1	Ok I whent out and got a 512MB chip for my computer (Compaq 4410us SDRAM 168 pin), First I thought the chip was bad because after instaling it, the computer only read 64mb and was slow as all hell.	St
1.1.2	Turns out each of the two slots in my computer can only support up to 256mb...	St
1.1.3	So I still only got 265mb in there and a 512MB chip I can use or return.	St
1.1.4	My question is could placing this 512 chip in my computer have damaged it?	St
1.1.5	if so where could I get it tested?	St
1.2.1	I ment 512mb chip that I can't use...	St
1.3.1	The chances it was damaged are probably very small.	St
1.3.2	I don't know if there is any place that would test it for you.	St
1.3.3	If you know someone with a PC that can use the memory willing to let you borrow the PC for a few hours to test the RAM, you could do it that way.	St
1.3.4	To test RAM, get a program called memtest86.	St
1.3.5	Available at www.memtest86.org I believe.	St
1.3.6	It is free, and you put it on a CD or floppy and the system boots directly into it and begins testing your RAM.	St
1.3.7	Leave it running for at least a couple passes, and a full pass might take awhile depending on the speed of the PC.	St
1.3.8	If there are errors, memtest86 will find them.	St
1.4.1	You less than likely damaged your 512mb stick.	St
1.4.2	Usually with HP and Compaq products their motherboards are made for a certain load of RAM, the older the computer, the less upgradeable it is.	St
1.4.3	In your case, HP could have the motherboard in such a way that it can only use a maximum of say 512mb = 2x256mb instead of 512mb+256mb, therefore with a lot of the machines if you add RAM above what the motherboard can handle, only so much more will be taken advantage of.	St
1.4.4	Consequently, it becomes a disfactor as it will slow down the machine.	St
1.4.5	If you have 2 memory slots you could try 2x256mb and see how that works.	St
1.4.6	If that doesnt work either, you could always return the extra stick too.	St
1.4.7	Another thing you could do is call HP (if you still have coverage) and tell them you want to upgrade your RAM.	Sug
1.4.8	They will ask for your model # etc and will tell you what the maximum RAM is.	Sug
1.5.1	Cool, I'm going to end up selling it and buying a 256 chip.	St
1.5.2	Thats why I ask	St
1.6.1	Ya, my little rig is maxed at 512 (2x256) but bc I got it from ubid.com and it was my fault for getting the wrong one Ill just keep it for now and sell it on ebay after I do what that one guy said, test it in a friends computer.	St
1.6.2	I was just a little freaked out bc with just the 512 chip in, it ran show and only at 64mb	St
1.7.1	In my computer that is a 7 yr old Gateway, MAX SDRAM is 768 MB DIMM.	St
1.7.2	I checked it with this: http://www.crucial.com/promo/index.asp?prog=uslp_clickscansnap It shows I have 3 slots and Non-parity SDRAM, PC133, in each one 256MB, 128MB & 128MB.	St
1.7.3	That means I can replace the 2 (128) with 2 (256MB).	St
1.7.4	the math checks for 256 times 3= 768MB.	St
1.7.5	It will tell you how much RAM your computer supports & what you have in there now.	St
1.7.6	It also can be PC100 but they are outdated.	St
