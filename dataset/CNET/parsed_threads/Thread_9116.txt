<s> I have a Seagate Freeagent Go 750GB that my Mac won't recognise. </s>
<s> I can't afford to lose the contents. </s>
<s> The drive was recognised until recently and is still seen by Disk Utility, but won't display a desktop icon to access the contents. </s>
<s> I've run Disk Utility many times and it won't fix the problem. </s>
<s> I've followed all the steps in the knowledgebase articles. </s>
<s> I've tried to use Seagate's diagnostics software, but without success. </s>
<s> I've followed all steps in their knowledgebase. </s>
<s> Can you help? </s>
<s> Purchased 26 May 2008, S/N 5QD375A2 P/N 9NK2A6-51 (though difficult to read as very small)(OSX 10.5.8, 2.16 Ghz Intel. </s>
<s> When you first started to use the drive, did you format it with Disk Utility or did you just plug it in and go about your way? </s>
<s> You may want to look at a couple of utility programs. </s>
<s> Disk Warrior would be my first choice. </s>
<s> DW will rebuild the indexes on your hard drive and could well get it to mount again. </s>
<s> That said, I believe it only works on disks that are Mac formatted. </s>
<s> (just checked, it only works on &quot;Mac&quot; disks) Others to consider are Drive Genius, Data Rescue III and File Salvage. </s>
<s> I gather from the statement, &quot;can't afford to lose the contents&quot;, that you do not have a backup of this data. </s>
<s> The drive itself is probably still under warranty but that only covers replacement. </s>
<s> Seagate will recover the data for you but be prepared to fork out many hundreds of dollars (insert currency of choice) for the service. </s>
<s> Let us know about the format thing. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> Many thanks for your excellent help. </s>
<s> In fact, disk utility reports that the volume is Mac OS extended format, so I think I followed the instructions when setting up the disk. </s>
<s> This wasn't with disk utility, but with the supplied software on the drive. </s>
<s> I don't have a backup to the data - photos and music mainly - so this is a huge problem. </s>
<s> From what you say, Disk Warrior may well do the trick? </s>
<s> I'm loath to part with $99 which is the cost for most of the utilities. </s>
<s> I've found a trial version of File Salvage which may allow me to explore the drive (it recognises it) and salvage the files. </s>
<s> The option to remount the drive is, I think, only available in the paid-for version. </s>
<s> I'll update this with news of success or otherwise if this is a help to others. </s>
<s> In the meanwhile, any other suggestions will be gratefully received. </s>
<s> and most of the other utilities are around that price, however, they are usually worth it. </s>
<s> Good luck with File Salvage, I think you'll find that it will give you a list of files that it can recover and then sit there waiting for you to cough up the cash for a paid for version to do it with. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> Yes, I'm also expecting that. </s>
<s> Hopefully Seagate will come up with a solution, as I am sure that I am not the only one that has experienced this. </s>
<s> Interestingly, I've an older and smaller LaCie drive attached that has never caused any problems. </s>
<s> If I can recover the files from the Seagate drive, I'm tempted to dump it and return to the LaCie stable. </s>
<s> It's also a shame that Mac's Disk Utility doesn't really do the job that it should (in my case, at least). </s>
<s> It should fix this problem and not report that all is well when I run the First Aid option. </s>
<s> I guess that's why Disk Warrior and others are in the game. </s>
<s> let us know how you get on P </s>
<s> Well, I received a very superficial response after much prodding from Seagate. </s>
<s> It wasn't helpful - no real answer and just wanting me to purchase their data recovery service. </s>
<s> I asked a few questions back, but only received one sentence replies. </s>
<s> They clearly aren't interested and I certainly won't be buying any of their products again. </s>
