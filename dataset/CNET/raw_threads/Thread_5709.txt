Hello, I was hoping someone here could recommend a quality WiFi router with a good track record that I could get on Ebay for under $20. I made the terrible mistake of buying a used D-Link DI-624, which has turned out to be an epic piece of junk. Thank you.

My knowledge base is far beyond this. I've worked with other Wifi routers, even other D-Link routers and have never encountered problems like I am encountering with the DI-624. I bought it based on CNET's recommendation. There are a plethora of complaints about the DI-624 out there. We all have the same problem. The radio just drops out occasionally and we lose the connection. I'm curious to look into a Broadcom-based router so that I can install Tomato firmware. Ryan

The 2 I'm considering are the Linksys WRT546S or the NetGear WRG614. thanks, Janice

I don't want the router to get in the way of utilizing all 20 Mbits of bandwidth. I'm confused over Net bit rate of 54 Mbit's vs. the throughput of 19 Mbit/s. At which point does a G band router bottleneck and slow things down? Thanks.

10255	8	326526	2962421	2962427	pianoman1976	1/25/09 7:28 PM	1.23291168E12	Come again?	I have no idea what you are talking about. We're not gamers. I just wanted to know if a G band router could handle 3 users at one time on a 20Mbit/ sec cable connection - for general online use. Thanks.
10255	9	326526	2962438	2962421	R. Proffitt	1/25/09 7:45 PM	1.2329127E12	Then it's not a concern..	The sharing works almost as if you have the entire connection if you are getting email, loading a web site or such. You can pile 100 users on a router and it works super since no one is demanding long demands on the connection. Your email is fetched and that's over. The Web page loads and it's over. It's sharing at its best. However if someone starts downloading something big then you see the effect. Bob
10255	10	326526	2962442	2962438	pianoman1976	1/25/09 7:55 PM	1.2329133E12	more on bandwidth..	Thank you. Assuming all users were downloading something at the same time - my cable bandwidth service tops out at 20 Mbit/sec - so would a 802.11g spec router split the bandwidth into 3 or give precedent to the user that started first? Assuming the router divides the bandwidth evenly, can a g band router handle 3 simultaneous 6 Mbit/sec transfers?
10255	11	326526	2962459	2962442	R. Proffitt	1/25/09 8:00 PM	1.2329136E12	No.	The reason is deeply technical and you don't get an exact division of the bandwidth. It's a long discussion of queuing theory, packet sizes and probability. In the long run it may be 1/3 for each of the 3 users but you can safely bet it will not be exact. And it has nothing to do with who started first. Yes, it's a fine thing to discuss in a class room but this small space would be overwhelmed if we truly dissected how it plays out in real life. Can we go with almost 33% for each user during long downloads? Bob
10255	12	326526	2962445	2962459	pianoman1976	1/25/09 8:10 PM	1.2329142E12	last question	Okay. Last thing I'd like to know is if a g band router can handle 6 Mbits/sec from three separate computers at the same time - 18 Mbits total. Is this what &quot;throughput&quot; means. If so, g band can do 19 Mbit/sec (per wiki) - so the answer is yes?
10255	13	326526	2962476	2962445	R. Proffitt	1/25/09 9:18 PM	1.23291828E12	In a lab setting. Yes.	But since your internet connection is not 18 Mbits total and the wifi link is half duplex, all this becomes an exercise of how exact you insist the answer be and if we are talking about laboratory conditions and more. Under ideal conditions, if the packet sizes are the same, if the response times are stable, the servers that are being fetched are responding on time, all things being perfect. Remember I lived through the days of battle over the network protocol Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) versus TCPIP and you are treading right into the argument for ATM. Bob
