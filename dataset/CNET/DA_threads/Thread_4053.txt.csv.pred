1.1.1	Hello, I recently bought a 1tb Western Digital MyBook Home Edition external HDD, which supports connecting via USB, Firewire and eSATA.	St
1.1.2	I've connected it to my computer via USB, and it worked flawlessly.	St
1.1.3	However, when I try connecting it via Firewire, I generally get the connected hardware sound, then nothing happens for a while, and then it might eventually turn up in my computer as &quot;Local Disk: H&quot; or something, but when I try opening it, I get an I/O error.	St
1.1.4	When I open up device manager, it's under disk drives as: &quot;WD My Book IEEE 1394 SBP2 Device&quot;, with a yellow exclamation mark next to it.	St
1.1.5	In properties it says something like &quot;This device is unable to start&quot; or something similar, and the location is &quot;LUN 0&quot;.	St
1.1.6	I'd really appreciate it if you could help me get it working with Firewire, as the only reason I bought it was for the Firewire connection.	St
1.2.1	Try that connection on an Apple or a machine that runs Linux.	St
1.2.2	Do not expect WD to help you fix your PC or Windows.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Actually even if you get it running on FW you will not notice a really appreciable speed increase(loading etc) over USB 2.0.	St
1.3.2	Where firewire connectivity comes into play and is a necessity, is with camcorder input.	St
1.3.3	Bob is right with Windows being iffy with FW.	St
1.3.4	Mac on the other hand seems to book right along.	St
1.4.1	Hi....what happens if you unplug the Firewire cable (are you using 1394a or 1394b) for about 5 seconds and then plug it back in.	St
1.4.2	Another attempt would be to try Updating the driver from Device Manager...just right click on the listing with the Yellow bang and select Update Driver.	St
1.4.3	Let us know what happens.	St
1.5.1	I've already tried, and it's not the HDD or Firewire PCI driver, they're up to date.	St
1.5.2	I do have an old G3 iMac running Panther, so I'll try it on that	St
1.6.1	Well, I plugged it into my old G3 iMac and it connected within a few seconds.	St
1.6.2	So obviously the problem is with Windows, any suggestions?	St
1.7.1	Nothing good that I can share.	St
1.7.2	We know there are issues with Windows.	St
1.7.3	Why would we attempt to fix this?	St
1.7.4	Microsoft has the code, we don't so we can't fix it.	St
