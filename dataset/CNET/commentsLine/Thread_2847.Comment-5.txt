i will not get into the arena of windows vs linux but can report my experience with both.
i have an acer aspire 1 netbook with windows xp home and ububtu 8.1 for netbooks in a dual boot configuration.
it is fast in both window formats and i can even drag files fom xp to ubuntu when needed(doesn't work the other way around.)
the netbook has 1.6 atom processor with 1gb ram and 120gb harddrive.
smooth as silk.
i will add as soon as the netbook arrived i completely removed mcafee virus protection and installed avg free.
also go to tips and tricks for xp to remove stuff that is slowing down your system.
i am happy with my performance and the reasonable price for these machines.
remember also most microsoft windows compatible programs do not work in linux.
