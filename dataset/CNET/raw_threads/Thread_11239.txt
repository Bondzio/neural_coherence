I applied some thermal paste from radioshack on my cpu a week ago but then today I was switching the motherboard and I wanted to know cant I just take the heat sink off and just put it back on the new motherboard without reapplying it? I lost my thermal paste and I need to put my cpu in the new motherboard and I wanted to just move it without cleaning and reapplying. Im not switching cpus, Im just moving it.

That's the true paste, NOT a heat pad which normally is shipped with new cpus. To play it safe, get another tube of paste, which would you rather do, replace paste or burnt-out cpu? tada -----Willy

Its not a thermal pad its a grease from radioshack. Its only been on there for about a week.
