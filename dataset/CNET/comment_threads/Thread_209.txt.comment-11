I was on my WIN 95 machine for about 30 minutes today attempting to type some letters when during the middle of the second letter the tower went out or off but the lights remained on.
My monitor also remained on, it didn't go to black but the cursor on the screen froze, locked up so I called my neighbor down the street who knows computers inside and out.
I told him what was happening, he said it's more likely that the computer's HD is about to crash rather than a problem with the computer's power supply since my monitor remained on today although everything was frozen.
He said if it was my power supply going bad the monitor would have also gone to black.
I'm shopping for a new desktop now to replace this one since the longest it will stay on is about 30 minutes.
At this point I'm concerned about my Quicken.
It takes 24 floppies to back up my Quicken.
There is no CD burner on this machine.
If I buy a new set of floppies and try to back up my Quicken data if I can do it before the computer shuts down, if I'm successful how would I transfer the Quicken data into a new desktop assuming that the new desktop does not have a floppy drive which most new machines don't?
