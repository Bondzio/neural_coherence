<s> So bad that I took the loss on the chin and gave it away. </s>
<s> DO NOT BUY THESE unless you get to test drive it. </s>

<s> Do not buy unless you can test drive them. </s>
<s> Many are astonishingly bad or have other issues you will only discover after you set it up. </s>

<s> Go ahead and find reviews but again, test in real life before you buy. </s>
