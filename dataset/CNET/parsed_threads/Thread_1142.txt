<s> Well see what you guys can make of this.I got my new pc for xmas(X2 4800, GTX 7800, and 2GBs of RAM) and i love it but i have a few problems with some games like battlefield vietnam. </s>
<s> I cant play it for more then 5 mins before it just freezes up and i have to alt,ctrl,del. </s>
<s> I have tried getting all the patches but it still freezes i even tried BF2 and that worked great and so does FEAR and COD2. </s>
<s> Which bring me to my next question.Why on some older FPS games like painkiller and chronicles of riddick do i walk really fast almost like skipping around. </s>
<s> my card has the new driver too. </s>
<s> let me know what you guys think thanks, nick </s>
<s> is so awesome making the game a little sped up. </s>
<s> as for the freezing thing, overheat maybe? </s>
<s> cpu problem? </s>
<s> i remember someone's post a while back with a dual core processor and he had to change something in ctrl alt delete to work but good luck </s>
