1111	0	234453	2408455	NR	ncs22	2/19/07 9:11 AM	1.17187626E12	software firewall	Hi. I have a cable modem with a wireless router (D-Link Dl-524). Here are the specs of the router: 802.1X 64-, 128-bit WEP WPA Wi-Fi Protected Access (WEP with TKIP, MIC, IV Expansion, Shared Key Authentication) NAT with VPN Pass-through (Network Address Translation) MAC Filtering IP Filtering URL Filtering Domain Blocking Scheduling Do I need a software firewall with Stateful Packet Inspection (SPI)? Would a software firewall with Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) be even better for me? Thank you very much
