hi - i purchased all the components for my build from 3 retailers in the uk (scan.co.uk / overclockers.co.uk/ tekheads.co.uk) and yes i built the system myself - it was really very easy and there's a wealth of knowledge on the internet should you have problems - and it's cheaper than buying a pre-built system.
a good windows laptop will be something like alienware's area 51-m15x - it's great for portability and has plenty of oomph to play some decent games - if you don't want to buy from alienware, try msi or novatech etc.
- you should find something similar.
