<s> I just purchased an iPad and have some DVD's that I'd like to convert to video for the iPad. </s>
<s> These aren't copyprotected DVD's. </s>
<s> In the past I've used Roxio's Toast and Popcorn to convert video for my ipod/iphone and AppleTV. </s>
<s> Neither of these programs have a selected for iPad though. </s>
<s> I hope a future update to these programs have this feature. </s>
<s> Until then though is there another program to convert this video? </s>
<s> I hope to find a user friendly program. </s>
<s> Both of the above work but also with some DVD's it can be confusing to find the proper files to convert. </s>
<s> Thank you for your help. </s>
<s> And free too. </s>
<s> Start at http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=cnet&q=ipad+handbrake </s>
<s> i've got the solution from ipadintouch, check their recommendation with in-depth product review from http://www.ipadintouch.com/best-dvd-to-ipad-video-converter-review.html </s>
<s> of paid conversion tools. </s>
<s> If free Handbrake is good for you, why pay? </s>
