well ive had a huge problem with my pc for a while now specs: asus p5n32-sli dlx pentium d 3.2 4gb ram 2 nvidia 7800 256mb in sli cooler master case with 4 fan side side window (i will note this system was about 4.5g when i bought it so im desperate to get it working without full replacement.)
so about 2 months ago i had a short in my room and trying to run my pc only on a tripplite battery backup because i didnt notice power was out on 1 circuit, a bolt of electricity came out about an inch from my 1000w ps and it was fried.
later i bought a bfg 850w and my problems start.
all seems well, then about 5 minuets after loading windows normally my pc shuts off.
i cant figure anything out and finally take it to bestbuy geek squad(useless) and they say the mobo is bad, i have it traded out with a dirty looking but identical mobo through asus warrenty, same problems, so i take it to a computer repair and by this time i was trying to install vista wen this all started so i tried to get it on and bios is the only thing loadable.
at the repair shop they use a test ps at 450w and it stays on for a few hours no problem.
so i buy a new 700w ps because that is the 2nd larges available in my area(did order a 1000wps from newegg but has yet to come) and everything seems great, i got vista installed and many updates most counterstrike and source run fine at a max 35% cpu and all is well, until i run the vista rating program and it does the same shutoff.
so i do it again with the task manager up and it shuts off at 100% cpu useage, and all other times it seems to shutoff when maintaining hugh cpu demand above 80% so i look in bios hardware monitor.
i am used to seeing 50c/40c for cpu/mobo but now its showing 70c/35c.
(note: it was 54c on cpu beforetaking it to bestbuy.)
so i have a few things suggesting power supply overheating and a few saying cpu overheating.
please, can anyone give me suggestions.
if any further info is need please ask.
