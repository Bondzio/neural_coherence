We have a 1987(circa) Compaq Portable 3, with DOS 3.1 installed.
5&quot; floppy.
A few weeks ago I used it to do a bit of batchfile stuff to show people what it looked like in 'the old days'.I've just fired her up again and got '1790 - disk 0 error' which I believe to mean hard disk failure.
Is this the end of the the computer without perhaps major surgery?
Can I get into the BIOS?
Is there a BIOS to get into?
Any thoughts would be most welcome.
