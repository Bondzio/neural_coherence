I'm sharing the wireless network with my mother's house which is about 120 feet from my house.
Currently, I'm using SMC usb wireless network adapter with my laptop.
The problem is that I can only use the network when I'm in my bedroom (about 40% signal strength) but when I move my laptop to another room which is about 20 feet further I cannot detect the network at all.
I once try to use my dad's laptop which has a built-in network adapter in that room and it turn out to work just fine with signal strength around 40%.
Should it be the same between using built-in network adapter and usb type adapter?
And if yes, what should I do so that I can use the network?
