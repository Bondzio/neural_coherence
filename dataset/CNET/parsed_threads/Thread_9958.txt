<s> Whenever I dettach my disk-on-key from my PC I obviously need to go to the USB icon on the buttom part - and press Stop. </s>
<s> If I do not do so the data i've just saved is sometimes lost. </s>
<s> What causes this loss of data? </s>
<s> Why is it so important to &quot;properly&quot; disconnect the disk-on-key. </s>

<s> In short, the data is &quot;write-cached&quot; so to not seem slow when saving to the key. </s>
<s> I've lived with another USB key and this one has an activity LED which after watching and testing found that all is well if I wait for the LED to stop, then one final blink and then I've never lost a thing if I yank it then. </s>
<s> The &quot;why?&quot; is this. </s>
<s> Even if windows finished copying something there on the screen, in the background data is still being written out. </s>
<s> Pull the device during a write or when a file is open and you may see file system damage or loss. </s>
