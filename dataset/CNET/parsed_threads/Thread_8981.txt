<s> Hi guys, Wasn't quite sure where to post this, but here goes: I have a WD 2TB Elements External HD. </s>
<s> I use this HD for storage on my computer and also plug it into my WD TV Live box and watch movies on my TV. </s>
<s> I'm getting sick and tired of moving the HD and cords back and forth between the TV and Imac, so I wanted to leave the HD plugged into my Imac and connect the WD TV Live box to the HDD wirelessly. </s>
<s> Is it possible to: 1. </s>
<s> Connect the External HD to a router: Either via USB or using this NAS adaptor: http://www.vantecusa.com/gl/product/view_detail/448 2. </s>
<s> Plug a Wifi Adaptor into the WD Live box 3. </s>
<s> Access the External HD wirelessly from my WD TV Live box without the computer being turned on. </s>
<s> I'd suggest leaving your WD HDD attached to your computer and leave your WD TV LIve attached to your TV. </s>
<s> Connect both your computer and your WD TV Live to your home network (using ethernet cable is preferred if you want to stream HD video, or next best is wireless N with full signal strength). </s>
<s> Next, install a DLNA media server onto your computer. </s>
<s> If you have a PC, then I'd go for Mezzmo (that's what I use). </s>
<s> If you have an iMac, then I am not sure what to recommend since I'm a Windows guy - check out http://www.rbgrn.net/content/21-how-to-choose-dlna-media-server-windows-mac-os-x-or-linux . </s>
<s> Once set up, your WD TV Live will list your DLNA server and you will be able to connect to it, browse it and stream video, music and photos to your TV. </s>
