A right click, personalize to see if the resolution is not right you didn't share much detail other than HP and Vista.
Our forum note asks for a little more such as the model number.
Armed with that I could have found if there is a new video driver or if others are reporting a similar issue (and cure.)
But without details all I can do is note the above and think it's the video driver.
