However, because this is a power issue, its far better to allow it to sit out until &quot;stable power&quot; is present. If the power is erratic or on/off as it were, repeated reboots/start-ups could corrupt the system. I suggest you have a more protected system as in stand-by power, line conditioner and surge protection in all or varied forms. Having this will reduce any real or reduce damage to h/w and/or reduce some s/w corruption or allow a proper shutdown at least. If your power problems are constant than this is your best way to help yourself. I offer this as the post you supplied provided little info. tada -----Willy
