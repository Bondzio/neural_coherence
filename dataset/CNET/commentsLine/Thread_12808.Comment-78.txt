my last two computers were dell desktops and i have generally been pleased with them, and was starting to read up on their laptop lines.
i saw a new dell-manufactured anti-virus software recommended somewhere here online, and i ordered one.
it never came.
i called.
ninety minutes and six people later they had not even begun to resolve the problem.
i asked them to cancel my order and refund my money, and they said to do so i would have to go back to the beginning of the very long initial customer service wait.
at that point i decided my $21 wasn't worth the time i was spending, and gave it up - thus losing my money with no hope of ever receiving the product.
what if i'd just bought another computer and needed tech support?
never will i buy dell hardware or software again -- and i do hope their management monitors these techie chat rooms to see how many of us have similar complaints.
