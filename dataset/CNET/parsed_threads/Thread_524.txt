<s> Hi There i have a 400GB WD external HDD that has failed to respond of copy files from it. </s>
<s> I have tried to retrieve some data from it but most of it still sits there. </s>
<s> I have been given a replacement drive from WD but i need to recover the files before the drive is sent back. </s>
<s> The drive is behaving strangely, sometimes it says that it has an I/O drive error and cannot open particular files but i can see the files in there. </s>
<s> Most of the bulk is digital pictures (30-50GB) and rest being pdf and MS office related files. </s>
<s> i did try chkdsk feature but it kept telling me that the files are unreadable (I/O error). </s>
<s> However, I have copied some pictures a meager fraction that i was able to move successfully but it took ages to do so. </s>
<s> Can some one really suggest something intuitively that may prevent me from spending too much money to get the piece of junk workable. </s>
<s> ALSO WHEN I CONNECT THE DRIVE IT KEEPS ON SPINNING AND DOES NOT STOP AND I HAVE A HARD TIME EJECTING IT TOO. </s>
<s> ANY COMMENTS WOULD BE HIGHLY APPRECIATED. </s>
<s> Thx MI </s>
<s> If you haven't already use a rear USB port. </s>
<s> Since, a replacement HD is present, open the HD ext. </s>
<s> case and reseat the connections found inside several times and retry again to access it. </s>
<s> Check results, if OK, retrieve data ASAP. </s>
<s> If not, then the HD is going south and no amount of fiddling will do. </s>
<s> Since, you have success in whatever method to retrieve some data, repeat until done or at least until it really fails. </s>
<s> You could also swap HDs with the replacement ext. </s>
<s> case itself and if its a power issue. </s>
<s> If nothing works, then google for data recovery s/w either free or paid for. </s>
<s> if the data is that important, stop now and allow a recovery service to retrieve it. </s>
<s> You could also, mount the ext. </s>
<s> HD, removed from ext. </s>
<s> case and mount int. </s>
<s> to PC and check results, Again, if none of this helps or seems to get worse, data recovery service. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> are there any softwares that could help fix this issue? </s>
<s> and it looks like that, software won't help. </s>
<s> Only an (expensive) data-recovery company can get your data off then. </s>
<s> Did nobody ever tell you that you shouldn't store data on an external hard disk? </s>
<s> It's useful to transport data between different PC's that aren't in a network, and it's useful as a quick backup. </s>
<s> But surely not as primary and only storage of data. </s>
<s> Much too unreliable for that. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> I have yet to get a 100% or reliable recovery rate with any s/w. </s>
<s> No amount of playing gets it all done, though some files may have been recovered it seems its never the one critial one the user needs. </s>
<s> Below is a google webpage: http://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1_____enUS373US374&aq=f&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=data+recovery+s/w http://www.pctools.com/file-recover/download/?ref=google_fr&gclid=CM2aw9y-w6QCFSExiQod8Ai2kQ Robert, usually has a small listing he always posts, but I have no direct CNET link to it. </s>
<s> I suggest you search here on forum for it, as data recovery is a hot topic too often associated with ext. </s>
<s> HDs. </s>
<s> The lesson here is also store data on CD/DVD discs as well for critial data as yet another storage source. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
