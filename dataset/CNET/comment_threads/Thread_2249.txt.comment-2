why do you need 3 gigs of ram?
seems like overkill for pretty much every application out there.
but to answer your question as i understand things as long as it'll fit into the slot the system will automaticaly configure the memory to operate at the slowest speed... meaning if you have say a stick of ddr 333 and 2 of ddr 400 the ddr 400 will be &quot;underclocked&quot; to operate at the same speed as the 333. and no you cant use 2 different cards.
they have to be the same model.
ATI and Nvidia use different setups to utilize SLI type technology and boards so no you cant wire them together in a sort of hybred SLI setup.
if you're going to go for a dual card setup go with a pair of 6800s; or even better 7800s.
