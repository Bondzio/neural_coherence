my latest attemplt to install realtek ac'97 whql driver onto a dell dimension 3000 always results in a blue screen of death (due to device driver conflict).
i downloaded the newest version of the driver from realtek website.
during installation, it says if i want to continue since this driver is not digitally signed by realtek.
having read the read-me on realtek website, i clicked : continue anyway.
it continues for a little more and then gives me a blue screen of death.
attempts to try different drivers does not help.
my windows xp home installation was new.
what can be the cause of the problem?
