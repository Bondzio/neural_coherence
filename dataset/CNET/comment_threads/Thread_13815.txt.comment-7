Bob, Indeed - I have been trying to clean it for the past few weeks (uninstalling programs); but also all e-mail is web based for us, so we have not storage on here for that.
Duly noted on the back-up - for that I have been negligent and plan to address that 1st.
I downloaded CCleaner and used it just now and that was helpful to some degree.
Thanks for the ideas
