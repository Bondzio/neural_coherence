1.1.1	I just recently upgraded everything but my GPU which is the Nvidia GeForce GT 520 .	St
1.1.2	My screen now randomly flickers , and makes the sound as if a usb has been unplugged .	St
1.1.3	I 'm running Windows 8 , as I was on my last PC and it never did such thing .	St
1.1.4	I tried the latest drivers for the card , and even some previous versions and nothing has fixed this .	St
1.1.5	Gaming seems to make it happen just a bit more frequently , and sometimes it minimizes the game and flashes non-stop , resulting in a reboot .	St
1.1.6	Other system components are i5 3570k 8gb DDR3 RAM , 1TB HDD , Any advice would be great because I 'm at a loss .	St

1.2.1	And is this a fresh install of the OS ?	Ques
1.2.2	And finally , why not give a short run down of the machine before and after ?	Ques
