<s> Hello everyone, i am at my final stages of building m:y new gaming rig. </s>
<s> I have a few questions regarding my build, can u guys please shed some light on my build? </s>
<s> hopefully i'm heading on the right track Approximate Purchase Date: Next Week Budget Range:1800 just CPU (without monitor and other peripheral) System Usage from Most to Least Important: Gaming (BF4) and Movies Are you buying a monitor: Already own a QX2710 Parts to Upgrade: Everything Do you need to buy OS: No Preferred Website(s) for Parts: All US websites are ok. </s>
<s> Location: City, State/Region, Country - Chicago, Illinois, USA Parts Preferences:Intel Overclocking: Yes (not confident with current skills) SLI or Crossfire: One GTX 780 (Future SLI with another 780) Your Monitor Resolution: 2560 X 1440P Additional Comments: I will game heavily on BF4, so this built has to run BF4 at high And Most Importantly, Why Are You Upgrading: I have a very old CPU I have a few question, since i am using a 1440p monitor, would a single 780 be sufficient to run BF4 at very high settings? </s>
<s> Do i need to add more fans? </s>
<s> It seems that the Bitfenix case is pretty good with airflow. </s>
<s> Furthermore, im not sure if i should spend more money on mobos, should i look for an even cheaper mobo? </s>
<s> Asus Maximus seems like an overkill, or am i missing something. </s>
<s> Many people have suggested getting an i7 as future game might need an I7 haswell? </s>

<s> I can't guess why the dated CPU in that. </s>
<s> Let's look at a current Haswell for just under 1K -&gt; http://www.pcworld.com/article/2040319/build-the-ultimate-intel-haswell-pc-for-under-1000.html The 7790 looks to fair well against the 780. </s>
<s> I have to step out but will get some benchmarks here later. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I believe the i5-4670K delivers a better gaming performance. </s>
<s> A few guys told me that it would be more worth it to get? </s>
<s> Here's what I advise. </s>
<s> Always copy someone else's design. </s>
<s> At least I tried to save you from creating a new combo. </s>
<s> Here's what I promised later. </s>
<s> http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/gpu.php?gpu=Radeon+HD+7790 = 3050 http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/gpu.php?gpu=GeForce+GTX+780&id=2525 = 7864 Looks like you are going to very high end. </s>
<s> Seems you'd want the i7 IMO. </s>
<s> Sorry about not having the time to look over the video cards but I had to scoot. </s>

<s> Strange. </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gtx-780-performance-review,3516-6.html shows you get the 60+ FPS at 2560x1440 but I find folk rarely have that display. </s>
<s> Many are running the usual 1080. </s>
<s> Notice the rig they used to get that performance. </s>

<s> yes, hopefully everything will work well together. </s>
<s> Why get 4x4gb ram when you can get 2x8gb? </s>
