<s> NTFS - FAT32 - partition/format I recently installed a 2nd HD (80 gig - non formatted/non partitioned - as of yet)...my original system is running XP on a 40 gig FAT32... 1. </s>
<s> Is it in my best interest to convert the FAT32 to NTFS...and format/partition the new 80 gig to NTFS or run the 40 as is and run the 80 as NTFS? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> When/if I convert the FAT32 to NTFS, should I just use the XP convert ''tool'' since I have the OS/programs/files on the drive? </s>
<s> Or should I backup the drive and format? </s>
<s> Benefits/Drawbacks? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> I am in search of a way (if possible) to backup my operating system and programs so I do not have to reinstall everything from scatch...(if not the best idea...suggestions?) </s>
<s> Background Information: System will eventually have an external HD to use as a backup of drive #2, while drive #1 strictly runs OS and Program files. </s>
<s> That may firm up your decision. </s>
<s> Boot disk NTFS, other FAT32 is fine. </s>
<s> Revwerse is not too good. </s>
<s> You've got the wrong idea here... One harddrive does not read another. </s>
<s> It's the OS. </s>
<s> Older OS, such as Windows 95, cannot read NTFS because it does not support the newer file system. </s>
<s> If you have Windows NT, 2000, XP or above, it doesn't matter what kind of mix of file systems you have. </s>
<s> You can partition one harddrive into two drives, one running on FAT and the other on NTFS, and it will work fine. </s>
<s> With the lower price of HD these days why would you want to create more work out of something? </s>
<s> Spend the &quot;few&quot; extra bucks and go get a large capacity HD. </s>
<s> You didn't say if you were planning on running a RAID setup. </s>
<s> But if you're a gamer RAID is NOT the way to go. </s>
<s> In fact a RAID setup is actually slower for gaming then a single HD. </s>
<s> Save yourself the headaches and get a larger HD </s>
<s> that by boot disk I meant the operating system??? </s>
<s> ?Is your sole reason for posting to try to tell someone that they are wrong??? </s>
<s> What I said in my post was valid. </s>
<s> If he makes the operating system FAT 32 he won't be able to read the files data et al that would be on the NTFS drive. </s>
<s> He did say he uses Windows XP, you know, it's on the first post... </s>
<s> So what's your point?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> &quot;If he makes the operating system FAT 32 he won't be able to read the files data et al that would be on the NTFS drive.&quot; </s>
<s> It says if he has XP running FAT32 on the boot drive and the other drive or partition is in NTFS, he can't read them from the boot operating system. </s>
<s> Exactly the same as if the second drive was formatted using an overlay program. </s>
<s> We sure live in different worlds. </s>
<s> Haha! </s>
<s> Where did you get all your ideas!? </s>
<s> You've got to be kidding me! </s>
<s> It doesn't matter which drive is the boot drive. </s>
<s> Windows XP, the software itself, supports both formats and can read from both formats. </s>
<s> Poohoo... ^_____^ </s>
<s> Well, teh HD's have already been purchased...not really intended for gaming purposes. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
