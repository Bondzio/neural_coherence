I have two hard drives, one floppy drive, one cd rom drive and one cd/rw drive.
Is it possible to hook up a zip drive using a 3 device ribbon cable.
I would like to put it on the same ribbon cable as the two cd roms I have now.
The zip drive was given to me and works fine.
I just do not want to loose a cd rom or hard drive in order to hook it up.
