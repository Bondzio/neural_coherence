hi, my computer crashed in the night and when i try to restart it i get the message that windows did not shut down properly.... and asks how i should start windows - safe mode, last known config, normal ect.
regardless of which of these a choose the boot fails and the computer restarts.
in safe mode, the last line it shows is the driver agp440.sys.
i have tried the recovery console to disable this driver but lstsvc doesnt list anything and i can't disable agp440 via &quot;disable agp440&quot;.
if i try and reinstall windows, in the list of available discs to install to, the harddrive isn't there.
i can't figure out if the drive has just had it or not.
it just doesnt make sense that it can load a bunch of drives during boot, but yet it doesn't reconised the drive at all in installation.
any help with this matter would be great.
im running win xp pro sp2.
