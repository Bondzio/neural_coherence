1.2.1	Cable is not digital .	St
1.2.2	It 's an analog signal that carries digital information .	St
1.2.3	It 's a common selling point , but a little investigation will reveal the truth .	St
1.2.4	Because of the bandwidth involved , a great picture can be received , and the leftover is available for internet .	St
1.2.5	But I digress .	St
1.2.6	Get the tuner card .	St
1.2.7	A good one can be had for under a hundred bucks .	St
1.2.8	Do n't spend a load on an expensive card to view on a 17 & quot ; monitor , it 's just not worth it .	St
1.2.9	Visit the better internet selling sites , shop around .	St
