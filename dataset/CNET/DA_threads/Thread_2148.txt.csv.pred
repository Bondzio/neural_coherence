1.8.1	Found it wo n't copy write protected DVD 's .	St
1.8.2	It might work with DVDShrink but I do n't know if it was the DVD or DVDShrink that had my computer going around - had to shut down and go into safe mode to resolve problem though that update I mistyped and version is 6.6.1.4 , if yours is ver.6.6.0.14 , it is the first one but the latter is Jan. 31 , 2006 Darrell L .	St
1.9.1	her 's the thing , dvd shrink will pull files off a dvd ( and you can then view them on your pc ) but has no software for writing dvd 's -- instaed it looks for nero 's dvd writing software and if you do n't have it it tells you to install nero .	St
1.9.2	be advised , home burned dvd 's in my experience work pretty well on most nachines but they do n't last very long .	St
1.9.3	after a few months they get funky and unplayable .	St
1.9.4	-- fj	St
1.10.1	Have a look here if your problem is copy protection .	St
1.10.2	Please be aware that copying is only legal for personal backup to preserve originals .	St
1.11.1	I 'm just trying to make back-up copies because the boys WILL mess the origionals up .	St
1.11.2	I , ll try the URL you sent me .	St
1.11.3	Thanks a lot .	St
1.12.1	could be the downfall for copying dvd movies as well .	St
1.12.2	Newer dvd burners , dvd players , audio players , and television sets are all being manufactured that will be able to detect burned illegal copies and wo n't play them .	St
1.12.3	You either will get nada , zip , zero on screen or silence in an audio player or you will get a screen saying to put in a new disc because the disc ca n't be read .	St
1.12.4	Before you waste money and time burning dvd 's , try one and play it immediately to see what results you get on screen or in an audio player .	St
1.12.5	You may be able to play them on your pc , but nothing else .	St
1.12.6	Making copies of anything copyrighted is illegal in the USA ... even backup copies .	St
1.12.7	The reason being is that if you can make one copy as a backup you can just as easily make many for pirating .	St
1.12.8	When you consider that even hardware , such as a video or sound card , is copyrighted , there is nothing to stop a hardware maker from charging for newer drivers rather than make them available for free as a download ... I think some of these copyright laws make no sense at all and they covered too large a canvas with that sweeping brush they used to paint the law in their haste to protect music and movies .	St
