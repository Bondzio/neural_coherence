I proved to them that the old connection we had was faster...by three times. However, their &quot;ultimate test&quot; is downloading maps for Starcraft. When I connect to my DSL modem directly (Ethernet Cable) everything is great...the maps download in a second or two. When I go through our Belkin Wireless Pre-N router, it can take a minute, if we're not booted off. My kids say the same problem exists when they play XBox 360 online...a latency issue which allows them to be killed because of a delay in the connection. DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT I'M TALKIN ABOUT HERE? Even if I connect to the Belkin via Ethernet cable (not directly to the DSL modem), I still have the latency issue. So, the Belkin Wireless Pre-N router is the issue. How can I configure the Belkin Wireless Pre-N router so we can get the through-put as if we were connected via hardwire?

Sadly many tech support people won't explain this to the buyers. If lag time and more is that important, get wired. And for gaming you still want to turn off the wifi and maybe forget sharing the connection on the router for best effect. Bob
