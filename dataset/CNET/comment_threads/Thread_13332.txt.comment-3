I did actually find the problem.
It seemed that when I changed the settings that the WEP key reset, so it wasn't the right one being used by my wireless network.
I found it out by accident as i was trying everything in my power to fix it, but hey, it worked.
Have you tried that yet?
Good luck on fixing your connection.
