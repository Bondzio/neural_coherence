I installed a Radeon HD6770 and disabled on-board graphics a few years back just to play some games, and I had it working great until now. I got a virus 2 weeks ago and after removing it I kept getting the blue screen of death after a few minutes of booting to desktop. I decided to re-install windows 7 over my current installation. During install the screen went black for a long time just after the 100% of expanding the files. I rebooted and keep getting the same, just a black screen, no boot logo, no pc brand logo, nothing. Anyone know a way to finish my install? Plugging in the VGA to the on-board graphics or the Radeon does nothing neither did HDMI nor DVI I can't boot into safe mode since I can't see anything. My pc was a Powerspec B631 upgraded ram from 4 to 8gb upgraded power supply to visiontek 650watt upgraded intel HD2000 graphics to HD6770 the original specs are here: http://www.powerspec.com/systems/system_specs.phtml?selection=B631
