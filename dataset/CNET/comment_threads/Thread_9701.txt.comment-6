Well, I did download and install their free software, and it did fix the communication problem between the 2 computers, so that's great!!
However, it didn't change the situation with the printer at all, so I'm wondering if there are some settings in the printer that need to be clarified.
When I go into the screen on the printer (HP d7460), and go to network settings (or connections - can't remember which word they use), it asks for the WEP code.
I have no idea what it is or how to find out what it is.
Might this be the problem, and if so, how would I find it to enter it into this screen?
The Network Magic software really bogged both our computers down a lot, so I've uninstalled, but am very happy to have communication working both ways for both of them.
Thanks for the suggestion.
