yes i did see that part.
my board appears to be a micro.
(9.6&quot; x 9.6&quot;) but my case has 3&quot; vertical clearance from bottom of mobo to bottom of case and extra set of connectors to accomadate (i assume) the larger board with more pci slots.
my case has 2 pci slot openings in it that cannot be utilized with existing board due to its size.
if i can't get a p4 (no biggie) can i get a p3 (or older athlon,not really up to snuff on their products)around 800mhz and still utilize existing peripherals, i.e.
dvd rom and floppy.
(also psu)i'm only trying to get as much as i can without building or buying all new computer.
if it will only be a 600mhz processor i can get that probably won't be worth the effort and i would probably just build a newer computer (first time) to save $.
