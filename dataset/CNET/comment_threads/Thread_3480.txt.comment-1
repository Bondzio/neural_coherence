Hey all, I have an Pentium D 915 Dual Core cpu and I am using Asus P5ND2-SLI nForce4 Intel Edition (not the Deluxe verison).
I have MCE as operating system and for some reason, i cannot get my cpu to work in Dual Core mode.
Asus has been no help, they state that their board support Dual Core right out of the box but it does not.
Does anybody have a solution.
Thanks.
