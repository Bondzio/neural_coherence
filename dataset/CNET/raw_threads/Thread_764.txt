Pros: Brand Name Nice Cases blend into anything Very Media Center Oriented (or they used to be) Cons: Expensive Gotta to pick a certain model Can't Customize DRM Scandal (Not realy related) Hard to get what you want Bad Configs The laptops aren't that bad, though. What kind of PC are you looking for? Media Center? Gaming? Office? Simple Word processing and Word? Photo Editing?

Along with sony's 19-inch flat panel monitor, which is gorgeous, incidentally. No troubles with the PC. It's done exactly what I wanted it to do, day in and day out. I was specially attracted to a few of the features, like the front-panel connections for USB and camera cards and the like. It's all worked out well. I've burned tons of CDs and DVDs, done copying and ripping and all of it, without a hitch. The few times I've needed support (always of my own doing), it's been there in live chat. And I've run recovery twice and the program works as intended. If you go vaio, make sure to let the Update program run in the taskbar. It will alert you to driver updates and so forth at the sony support site, and they come out pretty regularly, another little bonus that I like. In short, I'm happy with my vaio and plan on using it several more years.

My most recent is ticking on borrowed time. Now I have 2 external drives backing all data, a drive image and a clone. I do like the media features but Sony has used very unreliable hard drives. Also, the DVD write grinds; the DVD read, if I let it activate ruins the DVD because it converts to &quot;0 space used and 0 space available.&quot; Many copies are in RAW image for no reason or selection.

Only factory installed hardware on the machine, but the fan runs almost all the time and it's very loud and annoying. Has anyone else experienced this? Thanks

My fan was soo loud that I couldn't even talk to people on the phone by my desk. Here are the steps I took to fix my problem. 1. UNPLUG the computer! 2. Remove the computer case. 3. Locate the aluminum 2-3 inch (DUST coated) cooling tower above the Pentium 4 CPU. It's hard to miss. 4. Carefully unscrew the fan (4 phillip screws) and remove dust from underneith the fan (Cooling fins) and the side (cooling fins). I carefully used a mini vacuume (or a house vacuume that has a air pressure release slot for reducing the suction power, a can of compressed air can and a soft cloth to remove all the dust from the cooling fins and the inner compartment as well. You could CAREFULLY blow out the power supply as well, Read air can directions carefully as resedue can be emmitted from the can if you're not careful. 5. Replace the cover and plug in, restart the computer. My computer's cooling fan stopped whirring like a police siren. Take Care, John - HomeComputerSetup.com Gurnee Illinois

The reason why I went with dell in 2004 was because of the protection plan because we move about every 12-18 months and use mover because of my husband work seeing that my vaio was murdered during our move back to the states.
