Well, complying with the memory is an easy task, since we can just readily buy the card with the appropriate memory.
But how 'bout the bus speed?
That's already becoming my concern.
Changing the bus speed means changing the motherboard, right?
(I think I won't be resorting to that.
It's like buying a new PC already.)
I hope I could get a specific answer.
Thanks anyway!
