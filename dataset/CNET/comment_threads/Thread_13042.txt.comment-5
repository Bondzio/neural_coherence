if you can only afford $500.
likewise, why suggest a $800 build if you are willing to pay $1200?
if you just want the pleasure of building a pc, and you don't have any special needs, then realize that it may perform no better than the $400 weekly special (that often come with printer and/or monitor like this one ) but it will likely cost more.
just giving you notice in advance so you don't get a case of buyers (builders) remorse.
here's a $600 build that i suggested for another poster but it's a small form factor (mini sized) since it's intended use is to watch TV: http://my.cnet.com/5208-6142_102-0.html?forumID=68&threadID=290837&messageID=2747850&tag=mcnt#2747850
