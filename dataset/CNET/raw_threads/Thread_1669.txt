3062	0	366052	3161174	NR	Scorc	10/28/09 9:49 PM	1.25676654E12	ATI and intergrated video	So I was wondering if it was possible to use an add-in card AND the intergrated video on a motherboard at the same time..like crossfire. ....and if the intergrated video was nVidia that was/is set up as a PhysX to supplement the ATI add-in. I am not sure if it is possible I have an original PhysX Ageia card (PCI) but now nVidia owns it and maybe they would not let such a thing work.
