got this router for x-mas, sigh, nice thought, but total absolute junk.
to fix the constant disconnect: 1 go into your router settings 2 click &quot;advanced&quot; tab up top 3 click &quot;advanced wireless&quot; tab on left 4 change the beacon period to 20 this will slow down the connection speed somewhat(about 20%), but will enable the router to hold a steady connection.
wonder what is an adequate time period before i &quot;accidentally&quot; break it and get a new one.
seriously total junk, d-link never should have put it on the market.
