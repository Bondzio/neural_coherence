<s> I got X51L and my hdd stopped working , so I bought new one SATA: PM Toshiba MK1665GSX.Sometimes when i turn on my laptop, it doesnt detect my hard disk.. after few restarts it recognize the hard disk but when loading Windows it stoppes and says it needs repair. </s>
<s> First I tried with Windows 7, after the instalation it works but when I restart/shut down, it cant load again. </s>
<s> The repair starts but can not find any errors and shuts it down.I thought that it has something to do with my OS, so I format and instaled XP.. </s>
<s> Same happened.. </s>
<s> It worked after the instalarion but when I shut it down and turn it off - in the begining of Windows loading it says &quot;Windows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt: \Windows\System32\Config\System. </s>
<s> Please help me , how to fix it ? </s>
<s> It sounds like the hard drive is not working. </s>
<s> Perhaps the circuitry is fried, and that's why it only appears sporadically. </s>
<s> You weren't very clear about the error messages that Windows gives you. </s>
<s> What exactly did it say? </s>
<s> Also, what is X51L? </s>
<s> I can't suggest much right now, but, if the drive turns out to be dead, you'll need to call the drive manufacturer (Toshiba, in your case). </s>
