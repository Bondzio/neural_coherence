So, my printer just went out on me, and I really became dependent on my all-in-one, but if I'm gonna put out the money on a new one I would love to get one that will print directly onto my cd's and dvd's. Does anyone know of an all-in-one with disc printing?

I know of no other paper/disk printers at this time. You must realize that these will not print to ordinary disks, but only those with a special surface to receive and retain the ink. Hope this helps Frank
