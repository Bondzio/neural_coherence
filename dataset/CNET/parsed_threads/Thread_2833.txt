<s> We have a home netweok with a Netgear WGR 614 router. </s>
<s> The main computer which is connected to the DSL modem and router works OK, but the wirelss connections do not work. </s>
<s> They have in the past, but the other desktop always got a low signal strength. </s>
<s> The laptop signal was always strong on the floor above. </s>
<s> Verizon does not support Netgear so they won't be any help. </s>
<s> Could the router have gone bad? </s>
<s> We haven't changed anything on the setup. </s>
<s> Would we be better off getting a new, stronger router with a speed booster? </s>
<s> Verizon is trying to sell us FIOS, but we're not sure it would work in our house and don't want any more wires around. </s>
<s> The main computer is faster and always gets on line faster. </s>
<s> I would appreciate any suggestions before we buy anything. </s>
<s> Many routers arrive with out of date firmware or wireless disabled. </s>
<s> Check both. </s>

<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I disconnected one wire from the router and then reconnectged it and tried again. </s>
<s> I got a connection on the other desktop, but the signal was so low, I couldn't connect to the Internet. </s>
<s> I am on the laptop now so that gives me more information, but doesn't clarify what the real problem is. </s>
<s> I have heard that vertical connections work better than horizontal ones. </s>
<s> Are you using a Westell 6100 modem/router with your Verizon DSL? </s>
<s> Rick </s>
<s> Why you didn't check the items I wrote about? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It wasn't that I ignored your suggestion, I just remembered once before that Netgear had asked me to unplug the connection for a while and it helped then. </s>
<s> So I tried it again and it worked well for the laptop, but the desktop got too low a signal to access the Internet. </s>
<s> If it works so well with the laptop, I figured it is not the router, but something else. </s>
<s> I will check again with Netgear and give them my updated information and ask about updates. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> I am using a Westell 2110 Dual connect router with Verizon. </s>
<s> The model is B90 210015-04. </s>
<s> I have noticed that they now offer a combined modem and router with their service. </s>
<s> We need to check with them anyway since we could get a much cheaper rate by paying for a year. </s>
<s> They were supposed to replace the model some time ago and didn't. </s>
<s> I found a new Ehternet cable made all the difference in the connection. </s>
<s> We also moved it up higher so it didn't get bumped. </s>
<s> router uses the ip of 192.168.1.1 it may br conflicting with the Netgear router. </s>
<s> Log in to the Westell router. </s>
<s> If you cannot, run Belarc Advisor and see what the ip for the Westell is. </s>
<s> If it is 192.168.1.1 then change the Netgear router to 192.168.7.1 and it should solve the problem. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
