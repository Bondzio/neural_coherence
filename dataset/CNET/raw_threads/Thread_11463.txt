I have a HP a450n and I just added stick of 512 ram so now my im up to 1GB and I also added a new graphics card, a gefore 7600gs. My problem is that when i play a game of any kind, some kind of box comes up saying something about i need more power in order to fun the card properly or something like that. so i was wonder if i need a new power supply. the one i have right now is 250W. i was think about something around 400W becuase later on i might want to do more upgrading. And i also want to know which kind i should get so that it complies with my system.

Get a decent one.. you will pay a bit more but your paying for effeciancy and reliability. and check to see if your video card has a addon power spot/plug.. it might need more power to use all of it at full speed

Standard ATX: 6&quot;x3.5x&quot;5.5&quot; MiniATX: 5&quot;x3.5&quot;x5&quot; MicroATX or SFX: 5&quot;x3&quot;x4&quot; (or 5&quot;x2.5&quot;x4&quot;) once you figure out the size, i recommend you get a 350w-400w power supply. if you need a MicroATX, 350w will be the max that's available.
