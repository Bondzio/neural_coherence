that's not well supported even in vista.
use these simple rules on connections.
pc/windows = usb apple/macos = firewire pc/linux = your choice if you feel firewire should work please call microsoft.
i see you tried usb and failed.
at that point you have either not partitioned the drive and formatted those partitions or have a dead drive.
