i had a gateway laptop with a 20gb internal drive that contained a good bit of data.
the laptop bit the dust (motherboard issue), so i removed the hard drive from the laptop, and now have it in an external (usb 2) enclosure.
when i jack the old drive into the usb 2 port on my desktop, it recognizes that the drive is attached.
everything looks good in device manager.
as seems to be everyone's problem, it does not show up in my computer.
the volume is showing as disk 5 under disk management, layout is partition, type is basic, file system is ntfs (same as the root drive), and the status shows healthy (active).
it is not assigned a drive letter, and the only activity available to me is to delete the partition.
i am trying to access the drive to recover the data, so i'd like to avoid reformatting (for obvious reasons).
the desktop is a vaoi rb42g running xp with media center.
the laptop was running win2k.
any insight would be appreciated.
