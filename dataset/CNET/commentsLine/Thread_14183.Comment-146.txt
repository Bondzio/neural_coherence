i was hired as a cobol mainframe programmer in 1978 and worked on an ibm 370 that was housed in a large data center in london.
it was accessed through &quot;dumb&quot; terminals located in the bank i worked for in the wall street area, nyc.
my first pc was a compaq portable purchased in the 80s.
it had two floppy disk drives that subsequently burned out.
it was heavy to carry and was known as the &quot;sewing machine&quot;.
