<s> I have a Belkin Pre-N Wireless Router and can get online and have an Type 2 NAT with the Playstation 3 Network, but if I try to play Resistance Fall of Man On-line multiplayer all the other players don't look like they are running, they sort of appear in one spot and then appear in a new spot while making a clicking sound. </s>
<s> I know its the router because it worked fine with my old router. </s>
<s> Is there some setting that I need to chage on the Belkin to allow for smoth online play with Resistance? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> Latest firmware on the router. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Configure the router for 802.11g only if you can. </s>
<s> If that doesn't help, use the old router and turn the Belkin into a WAP. </s>
