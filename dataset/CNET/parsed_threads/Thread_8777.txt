<s> Well I think its time to upgrade and I'm looking for help on a good mother board and CPU combo. </s>
<s> I curently have: Processor: AMD Athlon(tm) XP 1900+, ~1.6GHz Memory: 1024MB RAM Vid Card: Ge Force 4 Ti 4600 Monitor: ViewSonic 17PS-2 Monitor Max Res: 1600,1280 Description: SB Live! </s>
<s> Wave Device HardDrives: 2 IBM DeskStar GXP 60GB 7200rpm in RAID 0 I want get faster processor and motherboard to go with it but the motherboard has to have RAID 0 build in for my IDE drives. </s>
<s> Suggestions? </s>
<s> Sorry posted this in another forum but I think this is a better one for my question </s>

<s> and make your own decision. </s>
<s> So many aspects to consider on a new system build [if you really want to see a speed difference from your present system. </s>
<s> Go to www.tomshardware.com and www.anandtech.com and search for their articles on mobos. </s>
<s> Decide first whether you want to use an Intel CPU or an AMD. </s>
<s> Then what socket configuration {AMD is simple for the 32 bit CPU (1 socket type), a little more complex for the 64 bit CPU ( 3 sockets). </s>
<s> Intel has about 3 different socket type CPU's to consider. </s>
<s> Also which chipset that you choose must be given some thought. </s>
<s> BUT read the D---d articles They give all of the features and info. </s>
<s> Picking a mobo?CPU simply by it haveRAID zero is extremely shortsighted. </s>
<s> Asking others to ID the proper M/B / CPU / chipset for you is like asking which is better .. Ford or Chevy. </s>
<s> I prefer Intel chips and boards..dual memory 533MB min/ 533 or 800 fbs/ 2.4 or 3.0 CPU depending on system use. </s>
<s> AMDs' in some cases are a better choice. </s>
<s> I have found using a slower CPU to a fast M/B the AMDs' will smoke an Intel. </s>
<s> I just don't like the small footprint AMD presents for heat dissipation. </s>
<s> Some good reading http://www.aceshardware.com/Spades/read.php?article_id=5000186 http://arstechnica.com/cpu/index.html Good luck on your build Bill . </s>
<s> &quot;You ain't seem nothing yet.&quot; AMD demo'd dual 64-bit CPUs and for an ultimate desktop this is big news. </s>
<s> Also, your machine is really &quot;pretty good&quot; except for that video card. </s>
<s> I'd save my money and upgrade the video card. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Saving the cash the system is good enough, the new 5900 Ultra (Nvidia) I got is great, plus it was free, =) sent mine in for RMA and this thing came back! </s>
<s> Thanks guys and R Proffitt once again. </s>
