<s> Hi, Was hoping somebody could help me - I'm so confused. </s>
<s> Anyway, I have two Pentium desktop PC's (One Compaq 8000 and the other a Dell XPS) - these two PC's are both side by side in the same desktop worksurface. </s>
<s> I would like to be able to transfer photos from PC to PC as well as some date. </s>
<s> I would like to be able to have my (USB) kodak camera cradle (or dock) work with both desk tops, my printer is a HP 960 PARALLEL port... My scanner is a visioneer USB. </s>
<s> Also maybe some side by side racing (or gaming) with my kids. </s>
<s> I don't need really need wireless because all my wiring is together. </s>
<s> Was hoping there were some plug and play solutions to setup a simple network. </s>
<s> I have No plans of adding more PC's to the mix. </s>
<s> If someone could tell me what items I need to buy that would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> I have no problem with installing cards if need be... </s>
<s> There are to many varaible to be guessing at this and the kids at best buy are no help. </s>
<s> Thank you litegide24@yahoo.com </s>
<s> You could do wireless networking for a really good solution. </s>
<s> What OS are your computers, do they have NIC's, if they do then you could make your own Crossover Cable: http://www.makeitsimple.com/how-to/dyi_crossover.htm and connect the two computers directly together, but if they are old then you might have trouble. </s>
<s> If you do decide to use Wireless networking then I can help you set up folder sharing and other things. </s>
<s> Hi, thanks for replying. </s>
<s> They both run xp home. </s>
<s> The compaq 8000T is a build to order pentium 4 2.4 processor. </s>
<s> It has a.llot of the bells and whistles and is 2 years old. </s>
<s> The Dell XPS is two days old, it's a pentium 4 2.8 processor although it really has no extra ports in the back other than the dvi for the monitor and about 6 USB openings. </s>
<s> how do I know if they have a nick card - the compaq might very well. </s>
<s> I could email photos oth the backs of the pc's as they sit. </s>
<s> I just took some pictures because I just built this desk for the pc's and wired all last night. </s>
<s> Thanks litegide24@yahoo.com </s>
<s> Thanks for the link, I just made up a cable similar to that - took a cat 5 cable about 70 feet long and ran it from my router to my sons xbox. </s>
<s> Very tideous without the crimp tool, I borrowed the tool from work and it went great! </s>
<s> If you have a router this shouldn;t be too tough at all. </s>
<s> Once each of the computers are connected to the router, enable the IPx/SPX protocol on both computers NIC properites and then file sharing, printer sharing, and multiplayer gaming are much easier. </s>
<s> Hi, thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> I have a 4 port linksys router. </s>
<s> I wasn't sure where to find the nic properties so I went to do a search on my first PC (the compaq 8000T) File search revealed a folder names NIC, I right clicked and selected properties and there was the general/sharing/customize tabs... On the sharing tab there was a box - ''network and sharing box'' and the Network Setup Wizard. </s>
<s> I believe this is what you said to do - correct? </s>
<s> I didn't follow thru w/the wizard because I wanted to see if I could do this on both PC's. </s>
<s> Now on the new Dell XPS P4 2.8 I did the same search and there were allot more folders, most of which were sonic... and I think they're all software related... </s>
<s> I didn't see a folder named ''NIC'' like on the compaq? </s>
<s> Although if I right click on the properties tab on any of the file folders in the search results I am able to see the same general/sharing/customize tabs... </s>
<s> I was alittle confused as to why every folder would give me network sharing capabilities. </s>
<s> Is it possible this Dell PC doesn't have this capability? </s>
<s> The router connectivity sounds ideal, I hope I can make it work, I can also purchase and install a NIC card if need be. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> A Network Interface Card (NIC) is a piece of hardware almost every computer (especially new ones) have. </s>
<s> This is purely the connection point for your ethernet cables. </s>
<s> To access your network adapter's porperties in Windows XP, open your control panel, select network connections, find your active local area network connection and open it. </s>
<s> In the window that comes up click the properties button and you will be in the place described earlier. </s>
<s> To add the IPX/SPX protocol, just click the button that says install, choose protocol and click ok, then choose the NetBEUI IPX/XPX protocol and click install. </s>
<s> Do this for both machines and then connect them to your router. </s>
<s> If done correctly, all of the sharing settings should be all but automatic. </s>
<s> Is now enabled in both machines. </s>
<s> I tried to print from the dell (which does not have a printer hooked up and kept getting message that said &quot;file to print was deleted&quot;? </s>
<s> Is there a way where I can see the other computer...went to my computer and didn't see anything either... maybe I'm looking in all thew wrong places. </s>
<s> Although I feel I'm getting some where. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Does the file sharing work? </s>
<s> I have never personally done a direct connection thing, but kind of know about it. </s>
<s> If the network is set up then go to My Network Places and the other computer should be there. </s>
<s> Also both domains have to be the same(I think, Again I don't know if you have to on a direct connection) but on a wireless network they have to be the same, to check, right click My Computer and then click computer name, it will say Domain: then whatever is here has to be the same on both comps. </s>
<s> Tell me if that helps! </s>
<s> To directly connect one computer to another, you must first set a static IP on each computer from the same subnet. </s>
<s> 192.168.0.x x being different for each computer. </s>
<s> Once that's done, you should see each computer, but if you access through a router, you just need to leave your TCP/IP settings at obtain automatically. </s>
