the dynex stuff is just best buy's label and gear.
nothing to get excited about.
i like 2 or more cores in today's machines.
but you didn't tell what this machine would be used for.
let's see if a gamer would like it?
the video is &quot;integrated on motherboard (see motherboard and chipset)&quot; and is the fair performer for visa aero geforce 6150se.
- this is not a gaming machine.
it's a nice machine for most things, just not ready to play today's high end games.
