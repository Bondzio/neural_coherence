<s> Purchased a machine about 9 months ago. </s>
<s> Shortly after buying it, I was getting error messages and the drive could not be detected. </s>
<s> After a week or two, I could not access the Hard Drive at all, so I was sent a replacement drive (about a month after purchase). </s>
<s> Two-three months later, I again had the same problem, so I replaced the hard drive again, thinking I had bad luck and had gotten two bad hard drives. </s>
<s> This time I purchased it at retail and did not go through warranty as I needed the machine that weekend. </s>
<s> Over the past month I have been having the same problem again. </s>
<s> When booting, I occassionally notice that the IDE detection process would not show the hard drive and I would get the error: DISK BOOT FAILURE, INSERT SYSTEM DISK AND PRESS ERROR Usually after one or two restarts, the machine would right itself and I would not have the error message again. </s>
<s> Yesterday, I got received this error and regardless of how many times I rebooted, I continued to get this error. </s>
<s> Thinking it may be a bad IDE cable or channel, I proceeded to do the following: Switch the CD-RW and DVD drive to IDE channel 2 and switch the hard drive to IDE channel 1. </s>
<s> Switch the Hard Drive IDE cable for a new cable. </s>
<s> Switch back the Hard Drive to IDE channel 2. </s>
<s> Regardless of what I now do, I continue to have the same error message when I try to boot, about 98% of the time: DISK BOOT FAILURE, INSERT SYSTEM DISK AND PRESS ERROR Any suggestions as to what I should do? </s>

<s> I would try three things: 1) Place the hard drive on the IDE 0 channel(that's the first channel) without anything else on IDE 1(that's the second channel). </s>
<s> See if it boots cleanly. </s>
<s> 2) Try the same except this time on IDE 1, with nothing on IDE 0. </s>
<s> What do you get? </s>
<s> 3) Call the vendor you got it from and get the machine fixed. </s>
<s> Michael, Thanks - the motherboard has the two IDE channels printed on the MOB as 1 and 2 so that is what I am using for explanation. </s>
<s> I did try booting with the hard drive on each channel with nothing on the other and encountered the same problems. </s>
<s> I have an email and a call in to the vendor. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
