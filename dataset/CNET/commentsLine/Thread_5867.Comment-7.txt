1. as long as the &quot;old&quot; bios supports drives in the 300gb range, yes?
i imagine most would.
2. this would be more for long-term storage rather than speedy serve-backs.
soooooo, i could live with those slower speeds.
i actually have a new (unpacked) hp ex495 - intended to be used as a media server for music, video, etc to my networked home devices.
i quickly glanced at the manual last night - says it wants to reformat any new drive to become part of the server.
will it really not let me add a pre-formatted drive with content?
i should take a second look.
3. netbook - i'm confused.
how will my four raw drives fit into that housing?
are you suggesting i buy new individual/external housing for the drives, and cable them in via usb/fw?
