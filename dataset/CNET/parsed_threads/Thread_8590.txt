<s> Bob as in R. Proffitt. </s>
<s> I read in another post that you said there were issuses with ME and external DVD R/W drives but it could be done. </s>
<s> What are they and how can you work around them? </s>
<s> I was thinking about doing just that and now I wonder if I should. </s>
<s> The issues are. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> 4 Gigabyte filesize limit in FAT32. </s>
<s> No fix (ever) for this one. </s>
<s> Why its a limitation is that you won't be able to make an .ISO image to make a DVD. </s>
<s> Let me clarify that this will not stop you from creating DVDs, but a few tricks and methods will not be available to you. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Resources (64 thousand bytes) Video editing is CPU intensive, but some software packages have thrown in the towel on DOS based Windows and don't run at all on 95/98/ME. </s>
<s> Again, no fix ever for the 64 thousand pools of memory called resources for Windows 95/98/ME. </s>
<s> Again, this only limits what you can do. </s>
<s> Not a stop. </s>
<s> Best of luck, Bob </s>
<s> Ok Bob as you can tell I don't know much. </s>
<s> What is a &quot;ISO image&quot;? </s>
<s> What I want to do is use this as a way to make backups on my two computers. </s>
<s> One runnung XP and the other ME. </s>
<s> Can I do that with out a lot of trouble. </s>
<s> The ISO image is best researched at Google, but in one sentance, it's a FILE that contains all of a CD/DVD image ready for your CD/DVD recording software to use. </s>
<s> Since today's DVD can be 4.7GB, you can see that you won't be able to create that. </s>
<s> As to backup of files, you should be fine. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
