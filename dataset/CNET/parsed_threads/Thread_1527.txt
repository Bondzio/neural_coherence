<s> after i upgraded my inspiron 1100 mem from 256 to 640 i noticed when i ran a defrag.that my free space on my hard drive went down 2 % ., any reason and is this normal </s>
<s> Windows will tend to adjust the size of the swap file using it's own formula...which does not make much sense to me. </s>
<s> I believe it makes the file 1 1/2 times larger than physical RAM. </s>
<s> It would seem that more physical RAM should reduce the size needed for virtual memory use. </s>
<s> Maybe someone here knows why this happens. </s>
<s> i am using winxp home ie 6.0 </s>
<s> Set your Tools/Folder options/View to display hidden and system files if you have not already done so. </s>
<s> Look in the root folder of your boot drive (usually C: but not always with XP). </s>
<s> Look for a file called &quot;Pagefile.sys&quot; and not its size. </s>
<s> Now shut down and remove one stick of RAM. </s>
<s> Reboot and see if the pagefile gets smaller. </s>
<s> If so, that's probably where your space went. </s>
<s> Displaying hidden/system files will allow you to see how much space your system restore folder occupies as well. </s>
<s> Setting restore points decreases disk size but if you don't have your system set to display &quot;System Volume Information&quot;, it will show no space used. </s>
<s> step by step please,how is this done </s>
<s> step by step please </s>
<s> You say you upgraded your RAM. </s>
<s> Did you do this yourself? </s>
<s> If not, and you are not comfortable with opening your case and removing a module, the step by step instruction will not help you. </s>
<s> But, you can do this. </s>
<s> As I said, allow display of system and hidden files. </s>
<s> Here's how. </s>
<s> From the desktop, click on &quot;My Computer&quot;. </s>
<s> Go to Tools/Folder Options/View. </s>
<s> Check the option to show hidden files and folders and uncheck one that says t to hide protected operating system files. </s>
<s> Click OK and exit. </s>
<s> Now, go to your boot drive which is usually C: and click on that. </s>
<s> You should see a file called &quot;pagefile.sys&quot;. </s>
<s> It will display the size in kilobytes. </s>
<s> Write down that number and note if it's approximately 1 1/2 time the amount of RAM you have. </s>
<s> I'll guess about 115000kb but it won't be exact. </s>
<s> Now, if you remove one of your RAM modules (power off of course) and recheck the size of the pagefile, you may find it to be smaller by a similar ratio to the math you just performed. </s>
<s> What this means is that, when you added RAM, Windows expanded the size of this file. </s>
<s> I'll guess it to be about 3/4 of a gig smaller now. </s>
<s> Hope this makes some sense. </s>
<s> i have a dell inspiron 1100 upgraded ram from 256 to 640 only two slots so removed 128 installed 512. </s>
<s> It means you're not that much of a newbie. </s>
<s> I tried to offer a reason why adding memory would lessen your available hard drive space. </s>
<s> You're free to validate or invalidate that as a reason so the rest is up to you. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
