<s> Hi all, I'm hoping I can explain what we are trying to do without sounding like a complete idiot. </s>
<s> Doubtful. </s>
<s> We have a wireless signal in our house that comes through a service provided router. </s>
<s> The troubles come when we try to get internet to our shop which is separate from the house and a couple hundred feet away. </s>
<s> We have tried a wireless repeater with no success. </s>
<s> My husband ran CAT5 such that you can have a wired connection in the shop, but we cannot seem to get a wireless network to work through this connection. </s>
<s> At my disposal I have the service provided router, a Linksys Wireless-G WRT54G V8, and a Uspeed Wireless-N Wi-Fi Repeater Access Point Range Extender . </s>
<s> Any help would be most appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Google How to use a router as a WAP and place that at the remote location. </s>
<s> I find repeaters to be too hard on folk. </s>
<s> For example, the speed drop is bad enough but will folk place them in the correct locations? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I hadn't tried this yet, but will do so. </s>
<s> Thanks for the suggestion. </s>
