1.2.1	Apparently whatever you are connecting to the POWERED USB port [ it the powered port is mandatory ] , is something that draws considerable current from ther 5 volts .	St
1.2.2	If you connected the device to the powered hub , but DID NOT have the hub power adapter plugged in , the device may have drawn too much current from the 5 volt USB connection within the computer .	St
1.2.3	This may have caused the computer shutdown .	St
1.2.4	The amount of current required for the device certainly should n't be too much for the main 5 volts from the Power supply , however , the computer 's USB circuits may have built in protection to prevent getting burned out by overload .	St
1.2.5	[ of course , it is possible that the device has failed and is shorted ] This is simply a WAG , because I see that no else has answered for quite a while , although on summer weekend days many people that normally reply are enjoying something else .	St
1.2.6	I am not absolutely sure what device was being connected .	Res
1.2.7	Possibly a little more precise explanation of what you were doing step by step would clarify it further .	St
1.2.8	Good luck .	Polite
1.3.1	Try powering off the computer , then plug in the device and restart .	St
1.3.2	My computer sometimes complains when I plug in with the machine on .	St
