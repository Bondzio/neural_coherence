I'd start with a clean install of your good old legitimate Windows 7.
Install SP1, installl all updates, install antivirus and only install trusted applications.
If you still get BSOD's it's a hardware issue.
If everything is fine and you install other software and troubles begin, you know where to search for the cause.
And maybe even everything stays fine.
