hey guys, i just moved to a new apartment where i'm surrounded by a lot of businesses that offer free wifi access.
my question is, can i just latch on to their connection(s) and say goodbye to my isp?
what it comes down to is, i don't need a land line or cable tv - i just want high-speed internet as cheaply (yet ethically) as possible.
is this feasible, and what kind of equipment do i need?
(running win98, standard pc with pci slot) thanks for any advice - i've been on dialup for years and have no idea how wifi works.
