<s> One of the nVidia 7600GT graphics cards connected to my evga board stopped working. </s>
<s> When I pulled it out I noticed 4 of those round capacitors had broken tops. </s>
<s> As if something had exploded through it. </s>
<s> One capacitor on the other card is the same. </s>
<s> Is that supposed to happen, when the card gets old or too hot? </s>
<s> Its only 2 years old This is my first time seeing a graphics card and putting a system together can anyone explain this? </s>
<s> Thanx for any information. </s>
<s> If you type BAD CAPS at google you learn the story. </s>
<s> It's not the card maker but bad corporate espionage with a stolen formula that was incomplete. </s>
<s> You now see these by the thousands. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Nvidia supposedly had a bad rash of bad video cards that was reported to have bad caps issue. </s>
<s> I don't recall all the models but this was 1-2yrs. </s>
<s> ago and users had several complaints filed, so google for such to narrow it down. </s>
<s> I believe they were 8xxx series, which they fixed by the vendor/maker, thus brands like PNY, XFX, and others got the fix/repair for Nvidia chipsets. </s>
<s> In many cases, a s/w fix was to slowdown the video port in order to help cool it. </s>
<s> This is NOT the same issue of poorly manufactured caps, but the rather the chipsets. </s>
<s> The side effect is blown caps which look just like &quot;bad caps&quot; once googled. </s>
<s> http://www.pcworld.com/article/166277/nvidia_overcomes_bad_graphics_chips.html Be aware poor cooling can also result in blown caps, thus be sure whatever cooling is being offered actually does the job. </s>
<s> Video cards can get into stressed conditions all too fast. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks to both of you guys for the knowledge. </s>
<s> I did many hours of research on those cards and still picked the wrong ones! </s>
<s> Oh well thanks again. </s>
