1.1.1	My notebook PC has just 2 GB of Harddisk space.	St
1.1.2	So if I were to rip a 8GB movie (non copyrighted) from a DVD onto my computer and then burn it onto a writable DVD that would obviously not work since my PC has just 2 GB of space.	St
1.1.3	So other than the option of adding additional hard drive to my notebook PC, can I rip only sections of the DVD movie (like say 15 minutes at a time) onto the harddisk, burn it to a DVD, delete that file, rip the next 15 minutes, burn it onto the writable DVD and so on.	St
1.1.4	Let me know if it is possible.	St
1.1.5	Your advise would be greatly appreciated thanks	Polite
1.2.1	It's the cheap fix.	St
