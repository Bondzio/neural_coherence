if you get the 8600 video card it well run fine for windows xp and most of the newer games.
at least until the end of the year.
i assume you want to play games.
the 8600 isn't that great of card.
i would get at least a 8800 320 card if you can.
(i got one).
this would have more long term use.
if you get vista home, then you have a nice new os, but you wouldn't get the full experince with it.
it probably would run slow anyways and you would regret doing it.
i would get a 8800 320 now (you can find rebates for it all over).
get ready to build a whole new computer and then get vista then.
(build the computer to support vista).
the other guy suggested more ram.
but you could only go up to like 3.2gb total of ram with 32 bit os.
so i don't see that being worth it now.
