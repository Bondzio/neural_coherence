mrbios has been around for some 10 years.
while i've never had to use them on any machine i've owned, some of my clients have.
it's an interesting bios with plenty of adjustments you don't see elsewhere.
useful can be asked, but some want that to tinker with.
why hp/compaq offers a fairly stripped down bios is very simple.
support and document costs climb with every option you give the user base.
to curb costs (and i'm guilty of doing this too in my software) we look at every screen and ask if any item can be set to a default value and removed from view.
close to your issue is this example.
with better than 99% of all home pc's with the hard disk being auto-detected, why offer any other setting in the bios?
one could rip that off the screen and keep users from messing up the machine, the documentation and support costs reduce and there are less calls from people who disabled the hard disk.
