1.1.1	Hi, The other night I setup a new system and got it going.	St
1.1.2	On boot it started with the installation of Microsoft Windows Home with SP1a.	St
1.1.3	During the installation process I was able to get Windows activated and I was able to connect to the Windows update site.	St
1.1.4	Automatic updates began updating the system.	St
1.1.5	But after my first reboot I lost my network connection and I am now unable to get anywhere through the Ethernet port.	St
1.1.6	IPCONFIG shows either 0.0.0.0 or default system IP of 169.254.60.236/12.	St
1.1.7	I have released and renewed, no change.	St
1.1.8	The obvious, I have moved the system to another known working port, and replaced with a working cable, no change.	St
1.1.9	I have link end-to-end, and I see port activity.	St
1.1.10	When I look at the Ethernet status, I see packets transmitted, but nothing received.	St
1.1.11	I have DHCP enabled/Obtain IP automatically for the &quot;Local Area Connection&quot; (properties &gt; IP &gt; properties).	St
1.1.12	I have a local home network with a Netgear gateway providing DHCP server functions.	St
1.1.13	I have plenty of adresses available to assign (50 total) and have five other systems working just fine over the existing network (3 PCs and 2 printers).	St
1.1.14	I have run system restore and loaded the initial system settings, but no change.	St
1.1.15	I am unsure what I am overlooking at this point, nothing seems to be sticking out, please help.	St
1.1.16	Thanks, Todd System Summary: Windows XP home SP1a Hush PC with a VIA EPIA M10000 motherboard with built in LAN (I verified the LAN drivers)	St
1.2.1	Microsoft doesn't supply drivers for that board.	St
1.2.2	If you let Windows Update supply a DRIVER then you get to remove it or start over.	St
1.2.3	Best of luck, Bob	St
1.3.1	OK, your right and thank you.	Polite
1.3.2	I thought I had updated the LAN driver last night, but I just ran through the process again and updated ALL of the drivers included on the original driver utilities CD and now it is working beautifully.	St
1.3.3	Thanks again	St
1.4.1	If you have the encryption set try turning it off to see if this works.	St
1.4.2	I had to do this in two steps (I am not sure why) first all the numbers were set to 0 (zero), then I went back to delete them.	St
1.4.3	After that, everything worked fine.	St
1.4.4	Good Luck	St
