1.1.1	I was ready to buy a 22 inch LG LCD monitor that doubles as a television .	St
1.1.2	It is 1080p ready and has analog and digital TV tuner .	St
1.1.3	I thought it was great when one of my collegues proposed to sell me his 36-37 inch LG TV second hand at a very good price .	St
1.1.4	Will this be an acceptable/good computer monitor ?	Ques
1.1.5	I have a HP 2510p notebook which I plan to hook it up to , will it work with it ?	Ques
1.1.6	Will it be any different with a regular LCD monitor ?	Ques
1.1.7	Will it have a glare problem if I do reading with it ?	Ques
1.1.8	Is it ok to buy a 1-1.5 year old LCD tv at half present market price ?	Ques
1.1.9	Would it be outdated in a general sense ?	Ques
1.1.10	Any tips to make it work at its best whether monitor or tv ?	Ques
1.1.11	Thank you .	St
1.2.1	if it 's a 720p tv ( most likely ) set the resolution for either 1366x768 or 1280x720 .	St
1.2.2	if it 's a 1080p tv , then set it for 1920x1080 .	St
1.2.3	as for glare , that depends on where you 'll be using it and how it 's positioned .	St
1.2.4	you should place a tv that size at least 3 ft from your eyes ( much further than a 22 & quot ; ) or you may cause eyestrain and have to move your neck/head too much to see the full image .	St
1.3.1	If your colleague 's TV has matching inputs , it 'll work fine .	St
1.3.2	Use the VGA out on your laptop + a standard VGA ( dsub ) cable .	St
1.3.3	A heads-up : resolution on TVs is lower than computer monitors , in the sense of pixel size .	St
1.3.4	Which is just fine because we usually sit next to our computers , but view TV from a distance .	St
1.3.5	So it 's not any different than a regular LCD monitor , but it is what it is .	St
1.3.6	1080 lines is great for TV , not going to be crystal sharp up close as a computer monitor at that scale .	St
1.3.7	For a business/mobile style laptop , even a 19 & quot ; monitor will feel like a nice big screen when working at a desk , so I 'm confident you 'd like the 22 & quot ; LG , too .	St
1.3.8	But hey , bigger is better , eh .	St
