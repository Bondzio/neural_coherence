<s> So I recently found a great online deal for an Asus cm6870 for the purpose of using as the base of a gaming rig. </s>
<s> I replaced the PSU with a Coolmax ZU-900B to power my GTX580 GPU. </s>
<s> After testing 3 or 4 games, I launched Skyrim with some graphic mods and the PC rebooted. </s>
<s> This happened within about 30 minutes of testing. </s>
<s> After trying the game again about 15 minutes later, I realized that the audio was playing very slowly and was pitch-shifted really low. </s>
<s> I also heard the fan blowing loudly, so I turned it off immediately. </s>
<s> The back the case was painful to the touch. </s>
<s> Here's some info that may be useful: - The case does not have a fan in the front. </s>
<s> - The PSU did not initially align with the screw-holes in the current case until bending some guide-rails out of the way. </s>
<s> - The PSU did not have direct connections for the video card but had some additional cables that connect manually via the PSU's housing. </s>
<s> (I used common sense in using only connections that fit naturally) - The motherboard is pretty small (1 x16 pcie, 1 x1 pcie). </s>
<s> - The case has non-removable covers where additional slots would be. </s>
<s> (possibly restricting airflow) First off, did fry my GPU already? </s>
<s> And why is it overheating so quickly? </s>
<s> Is it the case? </s>
<s> The PSU? </s>
<s> The motherboard? </s>
<s> Could not having a front fan or any apparent frontal ventilation on the case lead to that quick of an overheat? </s>
<s> The whole idea of &quot;airflow&quot; is to exchange air from in to out, thus airflow. </s>
<s> The exchange obviously replaces hot air for cool. </s>
<s> If you have some restrictive path or simply one that is block or not yet fully used, you need to make it happen. </s>
<s> Best explained by visiting gaming websites to review pix of all those gaming rigs out there. </s>
<s> If you have no frt. </s>
<s> fan, then get one and mount as it should(empty space/mounting) and draw air, &quot;in&quot;. </s>
<s> Better fans have an embossed &quot;arrow&quot; showing air direction or label/decal. </s>
<s> You mention, no side cover, well either that's a poor gaming rig or it wasn't for gaming in general. </s>
<s> Now, you know why gaming rigs cost more, everything is geared to make it stay running longer, even the case. </s>
<s> What some users have done, make a &quot;blow hole&quot;, by cutting on side or top(or both) and mount a fan there. </s>
<s> It would appear the Asus cm6870 is capable, so investigate what's what. </s>
<s> Maybe a plate is blocking air, you have to remove it by flexing it off(knock-out?). </s>
<s> Better PC cases have the PSU mounted on the bottom to better assist heat exchange as they too cause heat. </s>
<s> heat rises and its better exhausted by upper fans and all is expelled out. </s>
<s> Also, if a filter is mounted at frt. </s>
<s> maybe remove it, as you need better airflow even unfiltered as demands are greater than can be supplied &quot;as is&quot;. </s>
<s> These are areas to look at, so they're suggestions and using common sense you may zero-in on problem area. </s>
<s> Also, visit gaming websites. </s>
<s> GPU in general will run hot or at least uncomfortably so, but if too hot, they will stress out and worse, fail. </s>
<s> Be sure that if the GPU is fan cooled it is working as well and clean. </s>

<s> QUESTION: Which fan.....the CPU fan ? </s>
<s> The GPU fan ? </s>
<s> or the PSU fan ? </s>
<s> Here's some info that may be useful: - The case does not have a fan in the front. </s>
<s> - The PSU did not initially align with the screw-holes in the current case until bending some guide-rails out of the way. </s>
<s> - The PSU did not have direct connections for the video card but had some additional cables that connect manually via the PSU's housing. </s>

<s> - The case has non-removable covers where additional slots would be. </s>
<s> (possibly restricting airflow) QUESTION: Have you tried running it with the case's side off ? </s>
<s> First off, did fry my GPU already? </s>
<s> And why is it overheating so quickly? </s>
<s> Is it the case? </s>
<s> The PSU? </s>
<s> The motherboard? </s>
<s> Could not having a front fan or any apparent frontal ventilation on the case lead to that quick of an overheat? </s>
<s> ANSWER: Fry GPU ....not way to tell. </s>
<s> Try running system with case side off. </s>
<s> ANSWER: Overheating so quickly....almost anything and everything overheats when it cannot dissipate heat. </s>
<s> Again, try running system with case side off. </s>
<s> QUESTION: How many power connectors from the PSU are connected to the GPU and exactly which GTX580 (mfg/series/model #) do you have ?? </s>
<s> SUGGESTION: Download,install, run and minimize PCWizard 2012 ...the system temps including the CPU, the GPU will remain on the screen....let us know what the temps are. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> Thanks a lot guys! </s>
<s> Decided to go get a new case with an obscene amount of ventillation lol. </s>
<s> Downloading CPUID to monitor my temps. </s>
<s> If I hit anymore snags, I'll add a new reply. </s>
<s> Thanks again for the guidance! </s>
