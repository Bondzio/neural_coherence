if you are not an avid gamer, then you should be fine with an integrated graphics card.
i have purchased several computers this way, and later upgraded to a better graphics card without a problem.
almost all motherboards allow you to upgrade to a graphics card over the integrated graphics.
when you upgrade, enter the computer's bios setup menu when you first turn it on.
from there, find the option to switch the primary graphics to your new card or disable the integrated graphics.
now shut down, pop in the card, plug your monitor into the new card, and restart.
windows may look strange on the first boot.
uninstall the graphics driver/software it used to use and install the new driver/software.
done.
note: some system bios will even allow you to use both graphics simultaneously with 2 monitors and your desktop spanning acrross them.
