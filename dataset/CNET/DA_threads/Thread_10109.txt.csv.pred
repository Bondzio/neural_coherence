1.11.1	i 'd get a 9800Pro and a PSU as a 9800Pro is around $ 20 or $ 30 cheaper than the 6600GT , and should handle as well as the 6600 and then for a new PSU i 'd suggest ensuring that you can install it in an HP computer ( Dell for example uses a proprietary PSU design , my old HP uses a normal ATX design , what does yours use ? )	Ques
