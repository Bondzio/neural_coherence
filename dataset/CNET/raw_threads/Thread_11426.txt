I currantly have a 'home-built' computer: ASUS A7NXE-Deluxe AMD Athlon 2500+ Radeon 9200 DSL (SBC's modem) I run Ubuntu Linux 6.06 on it and use all of Ubuntu's onboard programs as defaults - OpenOffice, Gnome, Firefox, etc. I am getting a second 'home-built' computer: ASUS A8N-VM AMD Athlon 64 3800 3D Fuzion GeForce 7600GS I will load Ubuntu Linux 64 6.06 on it and this computer will be used by my children for schoolwork, supposedly. Anyway, I'm going to have the 64 bit unit on a wheeled cart for sharing purposes between children. I have never used a LAN or a router, so here is what I need guidance with.... Do I need to establish a LAN for both computers to work off of the router? If so, can I use the 32 bit computer as the 'master' and the 64 bit as the 'slave'? Do I need to purchase anything else other than the router? This info and any other pertinent info would be greatly appreciated. Thanks Gary

I have never network linux computer before; that will be an interesting experience for me later.

LAN = Local Area Network = just another name for a smaller network (such as the one you will create in your home). You could connect two computers with one crossover network cable to form a two computer network (no hub, switch, or router needed). Not very versatile, though. Today, the simplest way to create a network is to get a router and connect all computers to it with network cable (not crossover cable). If you get a broadband router, you can plug your Cable/DSL/other into it, so that all connected computers may share the Internet service. Get a wireless broadband router (and compatible wireless network adapters) to add wireless connection capabilities. If the Linux distribution has a proper driver for the network adapter installed in the computer, you shouldn't have problems. Just connect all computers to a router.
