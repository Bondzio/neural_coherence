1.1.1	Hi Everyone , I recently got a Compaq ( HP ) Presario C300 laptop running XP with a wireless Linksys router connected to a DSL modem .	St
1.1.2	I already had an old HP desktop running WIN98SE with a HP all-in-one printer connected via USB .	St
1.1.3	I connected the desktop to the wireless router via ethernet cable , and both units are working great individually .	St
1.1.4	However , I would like to network the two computers so I can use the printer with the laptop , etc .	St
1.1.5	I have no networking experience , and I am reluctant to start changing settings without some kind of how-to guide .	St
1.1.6	I checked Microsoft 's site and found networking tips that explain how to link XP machines or WIN98E machines , but nothing that showed how to network XP with WIN98SE .	St
1.1.7	They suggest that I update the old unit to XP ( obviously , they 're Microsoft ) but the old unit does n't have the processor speed or RAM to manage XP , and because the new laptop came loaded with XP with no OS disks , ( a horrible scam computer makers are being allowed to pull ) I could n't load XP on the old machine anyway .	St
1.1.8	( By the way its XP Media Center Edition ) Can anyone suggest something ?	Ques
1.1.9	Any tips , suggestions , links , etc .	St
1.1.10	would be greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.1.11	Thanks , and happy holidays to all .	St

1.2.1	XP & quot ; shares & quot ; a printer .	St
1.2.2	98 box sees printer in add printer dialogue box and you use it .	St
1.2.3	Same for shares .	St
1.2.4	- & gt ; What wipes out most home networkers is they install a firewall and it blocks the sharing .	St
1.2.5	Nothing in Windows is the issue there but I find people who ask this question to forget about the firewalls when they post .	St
1.2.6	There can be another firewall in the router .	St
1.2.7	All must be set to allow sharing .	St
1.2.8	Bob	St
