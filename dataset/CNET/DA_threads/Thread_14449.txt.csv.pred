1.1.1	Well my son built a nice machine .	St
1.1.2	He had problems with a Seagate 250 gb SATA cuda drive crashing , twice , a total meltdown .	St
1.1.3	He ended having to reformat , and reinstall WinXP , but lost all data .	St
1.1.4	So sent him another drive , a WD 250 gb SATA drive .	St
1.1.5	He set them up as RAID 1 .	St
1.1.6	I thought his data woudl be & quot ; protected & quot ; .	St
1.1.7	( He is in college , and does n't really have the time , or energy to trouble shoot , so I 'm trying to help him out ! )	St
1.1.8	Yesterday his drives crashed again , as he typed on it .	St
1.1.9	Well BOTH drives were totally unreadable .	St
1.1.10	No DIR , both drives .	St
1.1.11	Both registered as & quot ; unformated. & quot ; I thought it was the Seagate but now I 'm not sure .	St
1.1.12	If it was just the Seagate , why would both drives , in RAID 1 , crash at the same time .	St
1.1.13	Very odd , and very frustrating .	St
1.1.14	I bought him an external onetouch drive , for backup , reformatted , and reinstalled XP again .	St
1.1.15	This time we are using the WD as the boot drive .	St
1.1.16	I also disabled RAID .	St
1.1.17	I ordered a Seagate HD replacement , but I 'm not really sure if it is the HD at all , the Mother board , the SATA drivers , XP glich , or what .	St
1.1.18	I know this is difficult question , but perhaps someone out there had a similar problem .	St
1.1.19	Any grey cell electrical energy you can throw my way will be appreciated !	St
1.1.20	HELP !	St
1.1.21	Seagate Barracuda 7200.8 250GB 3.5 & quot ; Serial ATA150 Maxtor DiamondMax 10 6B250S0 250GB 7200 RPM 16MB Cache Serial ATA150 __________________ Lanparty UTNF4 Ultra-D AMD Athlon 64 3700+ San Diego 1GHz FSB Antec NeoPower 480W Power Supply OCZ 512MB 184-Pin DDR SDRAM Unbuffered DDR 400 BFG Geforce 7800 GTX Bios : 6-23-05 Location : Salisbury , MD USA	St
1.2.1	RAID Level 1 : disk mirroring or duplexing would do just that .	St
1.2.2	Any error on the main drive will faithfully be copied onto the other drive .	St
1.2.3	I 've been at this for 2 decades ( plus ) and never found RAID 1 to save anyone time , money or data .	St
1.2.4	Go figure .	St
1.2.5	Maybe next time something simply such as using one drive as a normal drive , then use ACRONIS or such to save a copy of the OS plus everything to the second drive as you see fit .	St
1.2.6	At least you have a copy that should not corrupt when the first drive and its OS messes up .	St
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	in so many areas ; however , I disagree with this post .	St
1.3.2	The statement that ''any error on the main drive will faithfully be copied onto the other drive '' is not correct for a true RAID 1 configuration .	St
1.3.3	First , there is not really a ''main '' drive ; the two drives are essentially peers .	St
1.3.4	Second , data are not normally ''copied '' from one drive to the other ; data are written simultaneously to both drives from the original source .	St
1.3.5	If an error appears on both drives , the fault is likely in the software/hardware preparing the data for writing , including a possible problem in the RAID controller ; if the error is on only one drive , it could be a bad disk sector , a disk writing error , or a RAID controller error .	St
1.3.6	I do n't know ; perhaps there is some system , likely software driven , that does write to one drive and then copies it to another .	St
1.3.7	However , this is not a true RAID configuration , which is hardware driven , but merely a software emulation .	St
1.3.8	This certainly isfeasable , it would be cheaper , and it sounds like what you describe .	St
1.3.9	But it is not true RAID .	St
1.3.10	RAID has been in general use for only about 15 years -- about a third of my time with computers .	St
1.3.11	During that time I have seen several instances where RAID did save time , data , and therefore money .	St
1.3.12	The most recent was early this year when we had a disk error on our old local server .	St
1.3.13	Fortunately , it was not a real disk crash , just a write error .	St
1.3.14	I was able to restore the data on the ''bad '' drive from the ''good '' drive ( this is where copying is used ) in a matter of minutes .	St
1.3.15	Had the error occured on a single drive it might have taken me hours -- especially since the Novell OS is on these drives .	St
1.3.16	So you go figure .	St
1.3.17	( Of course , this incident did n't save anyone money ; I am a volunteer , so my time cost is zero . )	St
1.3.18	If RAID were as useless as you imply , why do almost all servers use some RAID configuration ?	Ques
1.3.19	Most new servers have hot-swappable drives so that in the event of a total disk crash , a new drive can be popped in , data copied to it , and the system back in operation in a very short time .	St
1.3.20	I have RAID 1 for important data on my main system at home .	St
1.3.21	True , it may never save me any time -- mainly because I am in my eighties and quite possibly will not make it until a bad problem occurs .	St
1.3.22	However , having it makes me feel a little more secure in case of an early failure or a late death , and I consider the roughly $ 150 I have invested in it to be well worth while .	St
1.3.23	Frank	St
1.4.1	You 've repeated the exact reason why RAID 1 rarely saves the day .	St
1.4.2	& quot ; First , there is not really a ''main '' drive ; the two drives are essentially peers .	St
1.4.3	Second , data are not normally ''copied '' from one drive to the other ; data are written simultaneously to both drives from the original source. & quot ; Bingo .	St
1.4.4	Two corrupted drives for the price of one .	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	You say ''Bingo .	St
1.5.2	Two corrupted drives for the price of one . ''	St
1.5.3	Only in certain cases , which I pointed out , but not the majority of the time .	St
1.5.4	And the corruption is to the same data -- no differeence than had that data been on a single drive , and no difference in recovering it .	St
1.5.5	As I said , if the data is corrupted before the write process , it naturally will be corrupt on both drives .	St
1.5.6	However , if an error occurs during the actual process of writing to a drive -- and you know this does sometimes happen -- the data will be corrupt only on that drive , but not on the other one .	St
1.5.7	I cited as an example this very thing happening to me earlier this year on our server .	St
1.5.8	Another important aspect of RAID 1 is the protection in event of a complete disk failure -- perhaps a menchanical crash or a fried circuit board ; this almost always involves only one drive of the pair .	St
1.5.9	Now , instead of sending your one drive off for data recovery at a cost of several hundred dollars , you simply install the new drive , restore from the mirror , and you are back in business in a short time .	St
1.5.10	You may say that you can accomplish this with Acronis True Image , Norton Ghost , or some other software .	St
1.5.11	True , but you must make an effort to do it , and there is a lag in data of hours or days , depending on your schedule of backups .	St
1.5.12	I am not saying you do not need separate backups if you have raid ; you most certainly do .	St
1.5.13	You need the protection in case both drives become corrupt or inoperable ( perhaps a direct lightning strike , a fire , or some other disaster ) , and you do need off-site storage for important data .	St
1.5.14	But when only one of the drives fails , the more common situation , it generally is much faster and easier to restore the system from a RAID mirror than from a drive image on some other media , and it also is up to the minute .	St
1.5.15	You are never worse off with RAID 1 configuration than with a single drive , and you may be much better off in event of a disaster .	St
1.5.16	But as you said , it is your data and your call .	St
1.5.17	If you do n't want the extra protection and convenience , so be it -- no one will force it on you .	St
1.5.18	Nuff said Frank	St
1.6.1	How can I guess this one ?	Ques
1.6.2	It 's been 20 years plus of too many tales of sorrow yet RAID 1 never paid off .	St
1.6.3	- & gt ; You can write all you want but time after time I have to help people recover from disasters where this setup does not payoff .	St
1.6.4	Yes , I read your post .	Polite
1.6.5	Now let 's talk reality .	Sug
