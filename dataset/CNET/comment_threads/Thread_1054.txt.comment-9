That seems to be an odd modem---why a modem---you should have a wifi router and a wifi interface NIC....voice wireless gateway?
Maybe if you are running voice applications mixed with data but why for a PC that you just want WLAN interrace connectiviity--is this on your PC?
A modem--who runs a modem?
You need your WIC/NIC cards to assure 802.11t o4 n= modem should not be involved unless you are running dial up?
ON high speed wifi?
Confusing the crap out of me...
