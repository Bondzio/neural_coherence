i want to format d, which used to be c, and d is currently the primary partition and the one containing the boot info.
i cannot format it in any of the usual ways, and if i circumvent the warnings and do so anyway, my computer will not boot.
i would like to get rid all of the old corrupt windows data in d and merge it with c, without installing windows again.there was no option during install to use the whole drive.
