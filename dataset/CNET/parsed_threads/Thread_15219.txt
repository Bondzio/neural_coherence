<s> I just got a second monitor, plug and play worked and was fine even though my main (laptop) was 1280 x 800 and the second screen is 1024 x 768. </s>
<s> It went to sleep. </s>
<s> I woke up my laptop, and both screens showed the waking up loading windows, then the second screen went black. </s>
<s> Before, it still let me use the second screen even though I couldn't see anything, now I can't extend to the second screen through display settings. </s>
<s> If I try now, the laptop seems to get set to the lowest display settings possible, and the second screen stays dark. </s>
<s> Help? </s>
<s> When this happens to me, it's always the drivers. </s>
<s> Since it's a laptop your choices are limited but make sure you make a warranty claim if they don't support it by some driver on their web site. </s>
<s> i just restarted my computer with the monitor unplugged, plugged it back in after it was started, and now the second monitor works fine again. </s>
<s> But I feel like as soon as it falls asleep and I try to wake it up, it's going to not want to wake up again. </s>
<s> So it's not that it's not supported I think, since it does work, but it doesn't wake up after falling asleep. </s>
<s> I've seen other forum posts like this but there weren't answers to those either. </s>
<s> Laptops (which you didn't give make or model) are proprietary. </s>
<s> You can make this a warranty claim now. </s>
<s> I have no answers since there is so little to work with in your post. </s>
<s> Thus I only can share what it was for me, most of the time. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I have a gateway MT6840, and it says the display adapter is 945gm express chipset family. </s>
<s> When the laptop went to sleep, the second monitor could turn on again, but when it hibernated, the second monitor stayed off, but was still there, ie I could move my mouse onto it, as well as other windows. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> Also, I'm out of warranty since I got it over a year ago. </s>
<s> I'm always wondering why people leave out the make, model in posts. </s>
<s> Why is that. </s>
<s> -&gt; But tell me what date driver you are using. </s>
<s> I see the drivers at http://www.intel.com/support/chipsets/sb/CS-022034.htm and the date looks to be 2/15/2008. </s>
<s> Again, for completeness I'll install the latest chipset and graphics drivers when I see this issue. </s>
<s> Your posts never revealed if you did that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> So I tried downloading the driver update (from 6/28/2008) from the intel site for my computer, Windows Vista Home Premium 32bit edition. </s>
<s> The first page of the installer said the drivers the installer updated, and the 945GM Express Chipset family was included on the list. </s>
<s> Then setup quits saying &quot;The driver being installed is not validated for this computer. </s>
<s> Please obtain the appropriate driver from the computer's manufacturer.&quot; Hm... </s>
<s> But it says my driver is from 12/12/2006, and when I try to update it from the device manager and tell it to search the internet to find the upgrade, it says that I already have the most up to date version. </s>
<s> You have a very outdated driver. </s>
<s> 12/12/2006 predates Vista's release. </s>
<s> I see we've found the most likely cause. </s>
<s> In closing, UAC can block drivers. </s>
<s> I know to shut that down during driver installs. </s>
<s> Also I didn't see Vista mentioned till this last post. </s>
<s> Since you are making incomplete posts, it's unlikely that anyone can guess what the issue is but given that date I'd say you found it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I have UAC completely disabled because it's annoying, and when I try to install the update it gives the error message I copied into my last response. </s>
<s> Any insight on why that would happen? </s>
<s> Since I downloaded the 945GM express chipset update, and that's the chipset I have, I don't know why it's giving me that error message. </s>
<s> But I agree that's probably it. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help again </s>
<s> That your BIOS is current and you have the i945gm VIDEO. </s>
<s> I have not checked your work here. </s>
<s> There's a reason I haven't and it's because the details are being slowed given out. </s>
<s> When you post, everytime you post there is a note asking you to give out details. </s>
<s> Without such I am left to wait for the details or just give general responses. </s>
<s> You found the most likely cause of the issue. </s>

<s> http://www.intel.com/products/chipsets/gma950/index.htm is a start and the i945GM is NOT LISTED!!! </s>
<s> http://support.gateway.com/support/drivers/search.asp?st=pn&param=7515416 is interesting as they show NO VISTA DRIVERS!!! </s>
<s> Are you sure this laptop is supposed to be running Vista? </s>
<s> Let's take this one step at a time. </s>
<s> Try the 4 drivers listed at http://www.intel.com/support/chipsets/sb/CS-020683.htm for vista Bob </s>
<s> I took a screen shot of the device manager: http://i469.photobucket.com/albums/rr58/theblackred/Capture.jpg I bought this laptop from the gateway site last summer, August 2007, it came with vista. </s>
<s> It had a harddrive problem so they sent me another with factory defaults this past winter, 1/2008, so it's even more strange the driver is from 2006. </s>
<s> I googled my installation error &quot;The driver being installed is not validated for this computer&quot; and it seems like other people with gateway laptops have this error. </s>
<s> In my previous post I meant it seemed like a lot of people who were trying to download intel driver updates had the same error I'm getting </s>
<s> I see no less than FOUR possible drivers. </s>
<s> Using the i945gm should have failed. </s>
<s> Again, you have a warranty issue. </s>
<s> It's been defective since day one it seems. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Oh lol. </s>
<s> Found the solution on some european world of warcraft forum. </s>
<s> Apparently there's some glitch with the .exe file intel's update uses that makes vista unhappy. </s>
<s> So I had to download the zip file for the 945gm driver, and then tell the driver to update from a disk, but actually find the place where i extracted the zip file to and say that's where it should update from. </s>
<s> Specifically a .inf file in the extracted updater. </s>
<s> Tricky. </s>
<s> So yeah nothing wrong with driver or hardware or anything. </s>
<s> Just vista + intel = stupid. </s>
<s> The forum was http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html;jsessionid=88F7ED8ED983C57E193885AE8CD10C02.app03_04?topicId=254595484&sid=1 if anyone wants to read up on it more. </s>
<s> So yay happy ending. </s>
<s> My video driver is now up-to-date. </s>
<s> Thanks for your effort and patience Rob. </s>
<s> There are some million machines out there. </s>
<s> I know the issue, the usual cure and have never had to go to that extreme (yet.) </s>
<s> Thanks for keeping at it and sharing what you found. </s>
<s> I value such feedback since &quot;now I know&quot; and will do better next time around thanks to you! </s>
