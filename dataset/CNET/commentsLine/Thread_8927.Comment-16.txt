just set up the new viewsonic vx924 lcd - i was definitely worried for nothing!
there is no ghosting even when playing fast paced games.
the screen is so vivid and easy on the eyes (you were so right r.
proffitt!)
that i've barely noticed any decrease in resolution.
as a matter of fact, with the lack of glare the images seem less &quot;flat&quot; somehow.
i feel like i'm seeing alot of things &quot;for the first time.&quot; this is all in addition to the lightweight, very sleek design of the monitor as well.
overall, i'm glad i ditched the crt- sabine
