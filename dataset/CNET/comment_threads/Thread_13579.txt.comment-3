Promedia 2.1 and it's served me well for quite some time.
I don't game but I do enjoy music at reasonable quality.
It's really a matter of adjusting the bass to the right level as any sub-woofer can get muddy sounding.
My main home speaker system is still a pair of old JBL L65s ( a studio monitor series) that spoils me but the Klipsch are nice on my PC.
I don't need or want more than 2.1.
Good luck in your search but it's your ears that should do the judging.
