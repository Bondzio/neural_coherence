i changed them to wpa2 wireless security enhanced on the router and wpa2 personal on the laptop.
we'll see if i have to unplug everything tomorrow morning.
even though i restarted and everything worked, it's always the next day that is the problem.
as far as tkip, aes, i have always had it as tkip.
i thought someone told me at one time to always use tkip.
does anyone else have any additional comment on tkip or aes?
