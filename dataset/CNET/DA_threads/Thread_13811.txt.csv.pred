1.1.1	I have an extremely annoying delay of 30 seconds following the display of the Windows XP boot screen .	St
1.1.2	System completes POST fine , displays the graphic then chills for half a minute .	St
1.1.3	There is NO disk or processor activity ( checked using BOOTVIS ) .	St
1.1.4	Also played with various BIOS settings and BOOT.INI params , however it ALWAYS appears to pause for 30 before the disk starts the & quot ; propper & quot ; boot ?	Ques
1.1.5	ASUS A7N8X D MOBO , AMD 2200 , Maxtor SATA disk .	St
1.1.6	Anyone with a suggestion ?	Ques
1.2.1	I found one machine that when the BIOS was set to boot from CD first ... it delayed for about that long .	St
1.2.2	To speed it up , we set it to boot from the hard disk .	St
1.2.3	Lucky for us the bios has a BOOT FROM menu that pops up if you press some key so we do n't need to set the BIOS to boot from CD if that 's required .	St

1.3.1	Are you using any usb external hard drives ?	Ques
1.3.2	They can sometimes cause a delay such as this .	St
1.3.3	Sounds like a Windows problem .	St
1.4.1	Thanks for the suggestion ... . checked the BIOS and boot order is Floppy & gt ; SCSI ( System Disk ) & gt ; HDD .	St
1.4.2	Tried SCSI & gt ; Floppy & gt ; HDD and SCSI & gt ; SCSI & gt ; SCSI No change .	St
1.4.3	; - (	St
1.5.1	Hmmm ... no external disks and yes ... definately a Windows problem !	St
1.5.2	Thanks , you did open another avenue of investigation , it 's a SATA system disk and has a RAID controller associated ( although it 's not RAIDED ) and there is an error with XMASSCSI in the event log on startup .	St
1.5.3	This does seem to occur AFTER the 30 second delay in the startup sequence of events but is worth some experimentation I guess .	St
1.5.4	Oh for another 30 seconds !	St
1.5.5	Thanks again .	St
1.6.1	I 'm having a similar problem .	St
1.6.2	After the post info leaves and the Win logo comes up , I get a 30 sec .	St
1.6.3	flashing cursor .	St
1.6.4	I believe mine is also related to a RAID ( Asus A8V ) problem ; even though I 'm not using SATA ot RAID .	St
1.6.5	Like old age , I do n't like it but I 'm learning to live with it .	St
1.6.6	Check back to this post occasionally 'cause if I find a fix for my problem , I 'll post it here .	St
1.7.1	SCSI takes a long time to do it 's controller thing .	St
1.7.2	You 've found out why you get the delay .	St
1.7.3	If you want a faster boot , remove the SCSI and use some IDE drive .	St
