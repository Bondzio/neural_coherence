<s> My memory stick has encountered a really bad trouble. </s>
<s> Every time when I tried to use it on my PC, it will ask me to format it. </s>
<s> But, I know that the formatting thing will delete everything inside this stick. </s>
<s> Please help me save this memory stick and inner files back? </s>
<s> I am not so good at computer. </s>
<s> So, if you could, I hope you can tell me the detailed steps. </s>
<s> Thank you very much! </s>

<s> OK! </s>
<s> Don't panic! </s>
<s> In my persona experiences, you also can still have chances to restore all your files, as long as they are not rewritten by anything new. </s>
<s> What you should do right now is to choose a proper data recovery program to restore all your inaccessible files back successfully. </s>
<s> But, if you really know a little about the data recovery stuff, you can read this thread to know the detailed steps: http://forums.cnet.com/7723-7588_102-595975/any-suggestion-to-get-back-my-data-from-my-hard-drive/ Note: If you still want to save the memory stick, you'd better format it after the data recovery process. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
