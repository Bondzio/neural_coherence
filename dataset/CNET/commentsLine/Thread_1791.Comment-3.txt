i understand what you mean, but i have over 80 gb worth of videos and music.
also i have a single layer dvd burner.
putting them on disk will take time and money and be a pain.
any suggestions?
i've already thought of an external hd.
but what i said in my previous post should work, right?
what if i put the files on a hd that does not have xp on it but is formatted in ntsf.
