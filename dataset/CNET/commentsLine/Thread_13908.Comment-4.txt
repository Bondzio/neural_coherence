you are squarely where i see many with this toner and drum kits.
the owner doesn't want to pop for the drum kit because they want an assurance it will fix it yet the drum kit and what it changes would and could cause this.
you are not alone here in your feelings.
-&gt; the jiggle issue is a non issue.
the paper picks up toner and could move it to somewhere where it will now produce lines or patterns.
i know we want maintenance (no cleaning required) devices but they don't make such yet.
there is one alternative.
make the call to the service center and get their feelings on the matter.
