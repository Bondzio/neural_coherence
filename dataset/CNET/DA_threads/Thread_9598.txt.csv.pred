1.1.1	HP once told me how to remove static electricity to reduce random mouse movements .	St
1.1.2	Anyone remember how ?	Ques
1.1.3	HP DV6256US , vista 32-bit I 've been searching & only finding irrelevent links ...	St
1.1.4	Thanks !	St
1.1.5	!	St
1.2.1	Static would dissipate within a few minutes of you sitting down at your PC .	St
1.2.2	Unless you sit with woolen slippers on and shuffle your feet on the carpet ?	Ques
1.3.1	Static can sit in something .	St
1.3.2	That 's what static means .	St
1.3.3	Do you know the process ?	Ques
1.3.4	It was pushing down the power button when turned off or something .	St
1.3.5	Thanks ,	St
1.4.1	I did ESD control in the labs for years .	St
1.4.2	We would treat surfaces , install wrist straps and more .	St
1.4.3	However in PCs you have many conductive surfaces so it goes away in a few minutes after you sit down .	St
1.4.4	Unless you are generating it !	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	I 've seen it mentioned before .	St
1.5.2	Seriously .	St
1.5.3	I 'm not looking for your view of it disapating .	St
1.5.4	I 'm looking for the process .	St
1.5.5	Working in a lab , it would disapate .	St
1.5.6	In closed box - there is a process to release any build up .	St
1.5.7	That 's for bumping this up with answers , but I hope someone who remembers , notices this post .	St
1.6.1	Unknown .	St
1.6.2	Thoughts .	St
1.6.3	Since you are the source/battery ... .touch and hold something grounded .	St
1.6.4	I doubt you can build much of a charge if you have your finger on a ground .	St
1.6.5	Raise the humidity in the area .	St
1.6.6	Static will bleed off faster than you can generate it .	St
1.7.1	Wear the wrist strap to a ground .	St
1.7.2	Increase humidity ( what is it now ? )	Ques
1.7.3	And my best tool .	St
1.7.4	The antistatic mat on the work surface .	St
1.7.5	Let 's hope this is not about random mouse movements .	St
1.7.6	That 's never been a static issue .	St
1.7.7	I 've seen people try that and fail each time .	St
1.7.8	Bob	St
1.8.1	taking out battery , unplugging & holding down power button .	St
1.8.2	So what causes mouse to jump once in a while , or insert to toggle on it 's own ?	Ques
1.8.3	I 'm doing it because I 'm desperate to find ways to reduce something coming from the unit since repair that 's hurting my ears .	St
1.8.4	Ca n't hear it , but original problem was the now famous buzz ( the rmclock did get rid of it ) .	St
1.8.5	Wish I 'd known about that before sending it in .	St
1.8.6	Because now something is wrong with the new fan .	St
1.8.7	1 .	St
1.8.8	It 's blowing cold .	St
1.8.9	I 've changed to older bios so it is n't always on but it 's still blowing downright cold air .	St
1.8.10	2 .	St
1.8.11	Some buzz or aspect is causing ear pain .	St
1.8.12	I do n't need to develop tinnis from a laptop .	St
1.8.13	So figured removing static could n't hurt - specially since mouse & insert 's been a problem since got it back from HP .	St
1.9.1	Now there 's a clue .	St
1.9.2	There is a KNOWN issue where the laptop battery ages and it loads the laptop PSU and you get random mouse and keyboard issues .	St
1.9.3	I consider this discussion almost closed as that is not a static issue .	St
1.9.4	Bob	St
1.10.1	So it has nothing to do with battery doing anything .	St
1.10.2	Bob - You do n't get to close MY discussion .	St
1.10.3	I appreciate your input & if you do n't have to add when you do n't want to , that 's fine .	Polite
1.10.4	But it is my thread that I started .	St
1.10.5	Someone may still be able to confirm static process & more , add something about my problems themselves .	St
1.11.1	All around it .	St
1.11.2	You may have the age old dancing mouse issue and members as well as I noted how to reduce and remove static .	St
1.11.3	If that is not enough then the issue is elsewhere .	St
1.11.4	In fact , why is n't this a warranty issue at this point ?	Ques
1.11.5	Bob	St
1.12.1	Because you have issues with this laptop already and now a static one , it seems too much is going on .	St
1.12.2	With all this happening , you may a warranty problem and have to escalate it for a true repair or refund .	St
1.12.3	Of course static ( ESD ) is part of your environment .	St
1.12.4	If you have such an issue , you 're the cause as well as the home .	St
1.12.5	You as a person transmit or allow as you 're the conduit for ESD passage .	St
1.12.6	A properly grounded modern home will provide a path to discharge if you touch anything already grounded .	St
1.12.7	There are desktop style static touchpads for such use .	St
1.12.8	You can then touch laptop .	St
1.12.9	A & quot ; anti-static floor mat & quot ; can help as well as using static sprays if alot of static build-up is happening .	St
1.12.10	While you mentioned it maybe the battery then you got a & quot ; electrical issue & quot ; not a static one .	St
1.12.11	Let 's be clear if all of this is happening , then the 1st sentences above applies .	St
1.12.12	Then again , if you truly have a static problem , then its not HP laptop fault , this is something you have to resolve .	St
1.12.13	I have provided some solutions above .	St
1.12.14	You can also take the laptop to a totally different area ( someone 's else home or library ) and check out results there .	St
1.12.15	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.13.1	which you answered .	St
1.13.2	I said , I 'd sent it to HP for repair 3xs & it 's getting worse with each repair .	St
1.13.3	I also said , static was n't a known cause , just one more thing to try for what has become bigger problems ( not mouse bouncing , but buzz , ear pain , cold fan blowing too much ) .	St
1.13.4	So this thread is getting more attention than my first one a day or day ago - that had all the details & worries .	St
1.13.5	I assumed since you 'd answered it , you 'd followed that info .	St
1.14.1	Thanks for the info .	St
1.14.2	Removing static was an effort to see if it 'd help the real problems .	St
1.14.3	Here 's where I posted them .	St
1.14.4	( This link was just because I could n't remember the removal process for static . )	St
1.14.5	http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-4_102-0.html ? threadID=348813 Cold air but fan always on - after HP repair - what 's wrong ?	Ques
1.14.6	http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-4_102-0.html ? threadID=348642 Buzz making computer unusable ( & me into a pretzel ) Thanks	St
1.15.1	With each new discussion it is a new discussion .	St
1.15.2	This way the discussion starts unpolluted from prior discussions .	St
1.15.3	Dancing mice pointers are not fun to deal with .	St
1.15.4	Even more so if it 's the laptop pad .	St
1.15.5	For years I 've used simple solutions like external mice , no drivers with great success .	St
1.15.6	However once in a while you encounter some that what the mouse pad to be fixed .	St
1.15.7	For that we must deal with the product 's maker as there is no other place to go .	St
1.15.8	Bob	St
1.16.1	not the issue .	St
1.16.2	All I wanted with this thread was the PROCESS .	St
1.16.3	I added the mouse info because you said there 'd could n't be a static problem .	St
1.16.4	This is way off my original problems .	St
1.16.5	Please check out the original threads I 've linked to below ( in response to next person 's inputs ) ... . and see what can help with those .	Sug
1.16.6	Please do n't focus on the inconsequential .	Sug
1.16.7	The mouse is n't & quot ; bouncing around & quot ; or anything at some rate to worry about .	St
1.16.8	I just wanted the PROCESS for removal .	St
1.17.1	We covered this in this discussion .	St
1.17.2	More than one person has told you how to control static .	St
1.17.3	Bob	St
1.18.1	Put not the removal proccess I was looking for that does n't involve long term special pads or actions .	St
1.18.2	Just at the moment removal .	St
1.18.3	Obviously you have n't heard of it .	St
1.18.4	So be it .	St
1.18.5	Please check out the threads I mentioned & move on from this one .	Sug
1.18.6	Do many people answer on cnet PC hardware except you ?	Ques
1.19.1	Just ground yourself and you drain the static from what you touch in seconds .	St
1.19.2	Yes other people answer but something is amiss here .	St
1.19.3	You have the answers but must be searching for something else as a member and I have answered your question .	St
1.19.4	Bob PS .	St
1.19.5	My background is from labs where we used many forms of ESD controls and measured what was on surfaces and more .	St
1.19.6	It 's unlikely you will encounter someone else with years of working with the ESD and control of ESD issue .	St
1.20.1	You obviously are not familar with what I 'm talking about .	St
1.20.2	You 're years of experience can still leave a gap in smaller items here or there , such as the procedure I 'm talking about .	St
1.20.3	Besides - you have n't gone back to the original issues .	St
1.20.4	Just focused from the beginning of this tread to now to tell me & quot ; I & quot ; do n't know what I 'm doing .	St
1.20.5	You 're really got to read the details to understand what I said .	St
1.20.6	No grounding myself to it wo n't do what I was trying for - there is a procedure , I think just holding down the power button without power .	St
1.20.7	So , please buzz off or help me fix the buzz .	Ques
1.20.8	I 'm beginning to feel a bit of arrogance coming my way & I 'm frustrated enough , without that too .	St
1.21.1	I see that you want to remove static .	St
1.21.2	This is VERY easy .	St
1.21.3	Just ground yourself and hold onto the laptop at some metal surface .	Sug
1.21.4	The USB port is a good one .	St
1.21.5	In a minute the static is drained .	St
1.21.6	Now you say its still there ?	Ques
1.21.7	Let 's say it is .	St
1.21.8	And let 's say it causes your mouse to jump .	St
1.21.9	Here 's the problem .	St
1.21.10	As the mouse jumps some of that potential energy is used up so it will fade within a few minutes .	St
1.21.11	- & gt ; I feel your frustration with the jumping mouse but you are pursuing a dead end .	St
1.21.12	Maintain this direction at your own peril of missing out on the real fixes .	St
1.21.13	Bob	St
1.22.1	You are n't reading my notes & giving me nonsense answers .	St
1.22.2	Your even claiming I said things I did n't say .	St
1.22.3	Enough .	St
1.22.4	Try actually reading what I wrote .	St
1.23.1	You are asking how to remove static electricity which you say is causing your mouse to move .	St
1.23.2	& quot ; How remove static elec from system ?	Ques
1.23.3	by cheriberry - 7/7/09 1:30 PM HP once told me how to remove static electricity to reduce random mouse movements .	St
1.23.4	Anyone remember how ?	Ques
