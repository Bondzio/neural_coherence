Take a look at www.macsales.com for their line of external DVD Burners. They are really very inexpensive. Firewire is the connection of choice for the Mac, don't go with USB. Getting an external will save you hours of tears and frustration and be very much cheaper than trying to find a DVD burner that both fits into the space available and is supported by the OS. The existing drive would have to be removed. P

I use an external DVD, from them, with all of my Macs. I don't have a built in DVD burner in any of them. (OK, so I'm cheap, but it works!) P

My iDVD doesn't, but I read that the newer iDVD and OS does. I guess if his iDVD doesn't work with an external, he could buy Toast or Popcorn. That would be the trick setup.

The early versions of iLife only supported the built-in superdrive but there was/is a patch that will work around that. The devices up at macsales are compatible with the drivers installed in OS X Should be no problem P

It's not difficult! 1. Ebay has lots of the right DVD burners for sale ... they are new ... just do a search (I'm tracking several of these right now and will probably go for the Pioneer since I've got Pioneer DVD burners in all my Macs and they work beautifully). 2. Make sure you're comfortable with opening the Mini and working in tight spaces (I cut my teeth on Mac SE's and SE/30's so I'm quite comfy with this). To prepare myself for this, I took it apart and replaced the RAM in my Mac Mini Core Solo. This is different from the Mac Mini PowerPC version ... the RAM is more difficult to get to in the Intel Mini's! There is plenty of help available on the internet on how to open the Mini and how to get to the various parts. The optical drive has an interface card attached directly to the back. This interface card plugs into a slot on the motherboard. As long as you take care when taking the machine apart and putting it together again, it is not difficult to replace the optical drive. Just take your time and don't be distracted by anything else. Good luck!
