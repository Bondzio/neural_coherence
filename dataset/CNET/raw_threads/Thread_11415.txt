Im expecting anywhere from 30-60 users on at any given time. there are people telling me that they sometimes arent connecting or connected but have no internet.

I'm also think that anyone who is directly connect is not reporting the issues or having any connection problem. Are the only people reporting the issues are the linksys and netgear? If this is the case what model type of router's are these and do they have a bridge setting so you can create one wireless network bridge. One thing is to put the wireless route on different channels so they cancel each other signal. try it. let me know. Always here to help. If this was in the NYC, I would recommend calling Point to Point Solution, young guys that know alot of networking and fix problems like this one. this is there link http://www.ptps.us/ -chris

You must turn on your computer, then it will automatically connect to your router. The next step is going to Internet explorer and type in the address to configure your router. Then you might be prompted for a password. The address and password depend on what type of router you have. You have to refer the instructions included with your router. The last step is connecting your computer to the wireless network.
