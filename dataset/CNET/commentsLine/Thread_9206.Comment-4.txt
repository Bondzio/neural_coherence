looking at full size dell desktops i see many standard size power supplies.
yes i see the newer pcie power connections but only a person from a decade ago might call them proprietary.
the motherboards (most) take standard pcie video cards so not much to write there but the motherboard do tend to have the dell 4 led diagnostic lights but how else to deliver hardware diagnostics for all?
