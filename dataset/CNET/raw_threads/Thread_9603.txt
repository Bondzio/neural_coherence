4634	0	302749	2821495	NR	jevenew	7/28/08 5:09 PM	1.21726494E12	Memory not fully recognized	Setup as follows: WinXP SP3, Soyo SY-KT400 Ultra, AMD Bartron 2400, Crucial PC3200, 2x1Gb. Upon bootup, there are no conflicts. Memory test only shows 1024Mbs of memory. After login, under computer properties, it only registers as 1Gb of memory. CPUz shows memory in both slots 1 and 3, and also when I had the memory installed in slots 1 and 2, as was suggested by Crucial. The Crucial scanner, however, only shows 1 stick of memory installed. I have installed the memory one at a time, and they both boot up. This setup worked ok with three sticks of 256 Mb installed. Any suggestions

According to the SOYO website, the latest BIOS for the Dragon Ultra Platimum was dated in 2003,and is labeled as kvx42aa7. Belarc tells me that the bios on this machine is the Phoenix, v6.00PG, dated 08/17/2004. When I engaged a driver update service, DriverAgent, their scan showed that I needed the bios K7Vx4-2AA9. So far, all I have is a headache.

(Six years old) Changed out the power supply after many, many hours of other troubleshooting, including changing the bios, and everything is sweet again.
