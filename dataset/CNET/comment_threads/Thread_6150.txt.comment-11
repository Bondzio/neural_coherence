theres a few things i dont like about this computer.
i dont like how i cant hook up my old hard drives into this computer.
they dont use the old gray cables to connect.
instead, they use something ive never seen before.
another huge problem is the soundcard.
i use the mic alot for my job and most people cant hear me clearly.
