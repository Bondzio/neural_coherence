I have read about two monitors with 1 PC, and am trying to figure out if I can use one PC with two or more people simoltaneously on it. I have seen splitters that do just this, but would like to know if there is any easier way to do this with what I have or without some big-expensive hardware. I have intel extreme graphics chip, and a Radeon 9250 PCI. I have enough ports for 2 keyboard and 2 mice. I am using Windows XP Home edition and have Intel Celeron processor and 1 GB of RAM.

I put one main power house computer (X-Windows enabled server) in the middle of my house and wired &quot;dumb clients&quot; (keyboard monitor and mouse) to that main computer and each &quot;work station&quot; has its own session of X-Windows on it independant of the other workstations or the server. Microsoft does not support this option - If they did they would not sell as many licenses God forbid they turn down money... There is a way to make windows server 2000/2003 do this however it takes special hardware (i.e. Citrix Thin Clients) which end up costing as much as a new PC, so for a home user this is not ideal (unless ur a hard core geek and have money to throw away). If you dont want to spend more money and you dont mind switching to a differant OS then Redhat, Slackware, Suse all support this option out of the box, however Linspire, which is significantly cheaper, will support this option with a little bit of tweaking but Linspire's support will tell you its not possible (but it is cause i have done it). Hope this helps....

It allowed two users to simultaneously use 1 PC at the same time. Something like this: http://cgi.ebay.com/pc-buddy-b-210a_W0QQitemZ110004094776QQihZ001QQcategoryZ11182QQssPageNameZWDVWQQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem All you need is an extra keyboard, mouse, and monitor. I have no idea about the compatibility or usefullness of this, or whether a computer can handel it. I used to have one (probably still do in a closet somewhere), but I never used it. - Nick
