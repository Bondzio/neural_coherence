sorry no one could know if that's good enough.
for example someone could have a pc with 20 hard drives on it as well or what else?
there are plenty of power supply discussions and estimators out there but i can't answer this question given such details so far.
and even if i had all the parts in the system it still comes with a disclaimer about the health of the parts and the ambient temperature.
i think you have some research to do.
