1.1.1	I'm putting together an old PC I brought home from school with all the same parts except for the case.	St
1.1.2	When I hook everything in, turn on the PSU, and turn on the power, the fans run for less that one second before turning off.	St
1.1.3	I am positive the motherboard is not shorting out on the case, nor is any other component.	St
1.1.4	I've triple-checked all of the connections, but I still get the same problem.	St
1.1.5	It's possible that on the trip back, one or more of the parts may have sustained damage.	St
1.1.6	Can anyone diagnose this problem?	Ques
1.1.7	Specs: Asus P5B motherboard Intel Core 2 Duo E6300 2x Corsair 512MB RAM Rosewill 480W PSU Seagate 150GB HDD Geforce 7600GT VGA Lite-On DVD-ROM drive	St
1.2.1	Since this was free and you may not know the previous history, you're probably experiencing the original problem of the PC.	St
1.2.2	While you mentioned you're sure no shorts on mounting, you should return the system to a minimum level plus have it on a non-conductive surface(aka, cardboard).	St
1.2.3	No drives, only video, some ram, and mtrbd.	St
1.2.4	with kybd.	St
1.2.5	and mouse.	St
1.2.6	Power-ON and see what it does.	St
1.2.7	Take steps to proceed if it boots or signals its OK.	St
1.2.8	I further suggest you inspect the mtrbd.	Sug
1.2.9	for any leaking, bulged, distended, blown capacitors(looks like small soda cans).	St
1.2.10	Try all that... tada -----Willy	St
1.3.1	I did what you said, but the same thing happened.	St
1.3.2	I couldn't find anything visibly wrong with the motherboard or any other component.	St
1.4.1	If there is a 110/220 switch on the PSU make sure it has not been changed.	St
1.4.2	This board may need the four wire plug to be used.	St
1.4.3	If all else fails one can short between the green and any black wire on the wide plug to see if the PSU fires up and stays on.	St
1.4.4	And lastly do the drastic.	St
1.4.5	Sometimes it is necessary to bench check a computer that will fail to start.	St
1.4.6	This involves Pulling the Power Supply and Pulling the motherboard.	St
1.4.7	Remove everything from the motherboard and place the bare board and Power Supply on a piece of Styrofoam or cardboard.	St
1.4.8	With the power supply on the table connected to the motherboard and Power supply plugged in, Use a small tool to momentarily short the two power on pins.	St
1.4.9	The Power supply should turn on and stay on noted by the supply's fan running.	St
1.4.10	Power off.	St
1.4.11	Now put the CPU/HSF on, add one stick of RAM, and mount the motherboard And power Supply back into the case.	St
1.4.12	Connect the Power Switch wiring, no mouse, keyboard or monitor or case fans and again see if the power supply turns on and stays on.	Ques
1.4.13	Get past this point power off and connect the keyboard, mouse and monitor, If needed Get into the BIOS to set boot options.	St
1.4.14	Add one thing at a time checking each item.	St
1.4.15	Case fans first.	St
1.4.16	First drive to add should be your CD.	St
1.4.17	drive then hard drive.	St
1.5.1	I shorted the green and black wires on the PSU and it worked, but there's something I don't understand: should the PSU be on as long as the two wires are touching, or should it continue to work after they have been separated?	St
1.5.2	When I tried it, it would only function when the two wires were touching.	St
1.5.3	I have already taken everything off of the motherboard and hooked it up to the PSU, and it still would only work for a second.	St
1.6.1	OK, pull everything off the mtrbd, all ram, cpu, cards and what have you.	St
1.6.2	It should be like the day it was build, blank.	St
1.6.3	Attach PSU and speaker and power-ON, it should beep like crazy or some beeping.	St
1.6.4	If you like leave a fan that gets power from mtrbd.	St
1.6.5	connection.	St
1.6.6	If that fan stays on plus the PSU fan you have a possible mtrbd.	St
1.6.7	issue.	St
1.6.8	If not or it simply twitches its a PSU problem, replace with known good/new one, retry.	St
1.6.9	If you continue to get no fans running or no beeps the mtrbd.	St
1.6.10	has had it for whatever reason.	St
1.6.11	Some people may try to short the bios pins in order to clear the bios and return to defaults.	St
1.6.12	ATX mtrbds.	St
1.6.13	have a start ckt.	St
1.6.14	and/or VRM area(maybe module) which may have failed and unless you're capable and able to find parts, its a wash.	St
1.6.15	Replace the mtrbd.	St
1.6.16	with a new/old one and march on.	St
1.6.17	tada -----Willy	St
1.7.1	When the two pins are connected.	St
1.7.2	Did you get a chance to try the rest of the procedure, I.E, Hook up only thing at a time to determine where it ceases to stay on?	St
1.8.1	In my previous tests, I always left the processor in because I thought it would have no weight on the matter.	St
1.8.2	When I performed your test I removed EVERYTHING (including the processor) and only connected the PSU and the case speaker to the motherboard.	St
1.8.3	When I did this the PSU fan ran consistently until I cut the power, and when I replaced the processor, it went back to only turning on for a second.	St
1.8.4	Does this mean that the processor is the problem?	St
