With so many years-old 35 mm slides I want to scan them and create .jpegs using my new Canon PIXMA 610 multi function printer/scanner/copier. Does anyone reading this have any idea whether this is possible? I tried raising the resolution to the maximum of 600 and scanned the slides as color photos. THAT definitely did not work. Thanks in advance to anybody who may have knowledge about this.

They have to capture light passing through and not reflected from an image. They also need software to accommodate this kind of scanning feature. I have used such and my old HP 5470 has a slide/negative adapter. I can tell you that the quality is only so-so but it does work.

I am going to take the slides to a professional, who will make prints and also digitize them on a CD, so I can at least be able to manipulate them! Thanks again.
