Hello everyone, I have a Viewsonic 17&quot; LCD Monitor that has died.
The warranty has just expired and I would like to have it fixed, if possible.
Does anyone have any ideas on where to take it.
Of course Viewsonic won't fix it (I'll never buy another Viewsonic again) and I have called several local shops and noone else will either.
Any ideas?
Thanks, Chris
