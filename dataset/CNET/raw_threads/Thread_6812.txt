First I followed the instructions to the T, 10 times. Then I did a firm ware rev. The thing wouldn't let connect to internet on the host computer! But the connection was on. On the wireless computer I got strong signal, connected to the internet, but no internet. Next I attached a Linsky's hard router to the host and got internet back. Then I hooked the 624 to the linsky router. Now the wireless still has good signal but will not connect to the internet. I tried to go into the installtion URL, http://192.168.0.1, but the operation &quot;times out&quot; every time. I almost got the thing to connect but the error message said there was a network address conflict. I'm running an AMD64 3200, with 1G of ram with Win XPPro. I stay in Germany using ADSL from Telecom. Can anybody pllllease help. RAINMAN

But the connection was on. On the wireless computer I got strong signal, connected to the internet, but no internet.' A confusing statement, clarification is needed. How many computers are on this LAN and how do they connect. &quot;Next I attached a Linsky's hard router to the host and got internet back. Then I hooked the 624 to the linsky router. Now the wireless still has good signal but will not connect to the internet.&quot; This is where it gets muddy when you put two routers together. Simplify this network down to one router and give D-Link tech support a call.

I could not get it to connect wirelessly (even with all of the up dates) or wired to other DLink devices. I finally ended up giving it away to a friend that owns a coffee house for use as an internet access point for customers. He has to reboot it about 6 times a day to even get it to work as an access point (not even as a router). If you can return it your should return as soon as possible and replace it the Belkin 125 unit. I worked with the DI624 for about 2 months and it NEVER worked right. I've got 3 Belkin Wireless units and have not had any trouble with them. One of them (802.11b) has been running now without reboot for about 18 months. They are easy to set up and they WORK.
