I have replaced the speakers so I know that is not the problem. My sound source is on-board. I bought a new sound card but could not find an available slot to install it.

The noise is caused by other circuitry in the pc interfering with the sensitive parts of the audio electronics. So I guess you should have looked for a free slot before buying a card. Can't you take it back to the store and change it for a USB one ?

There was an available slot, but the sound card was too large(?). Regardless...I did take it back and bought a USB sound card ( an item that previously i did not know existed). A prior response helped me to find it. Great sound now.
