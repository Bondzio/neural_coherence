My dad has a Sony DW-D22A DVD burner that's failing (in this computer).
I was wondering what's a good replacement?
My dad will probably be buying this locally (in San Diego, CA), but I'm doing some of the research online.
I would like something that's: very reliable not too expensive (but not too cheap either.
I've seen drives locally for $40 or so but I wonder if they'll hold up over the long term (2-3 years or more), and I'm wondering if somewhere around $100-120 is the sweet spot?)
at least 8x DVD+/-R, 4x RW write speeds (and 48x CD write speed) Dual layer would be nice, but (I'll have to check with my dad on this though) I think we may be able to do without it for now.
Also, what brand(s) of media is(are) good to get?
I've been using Memorex, but a lot of CDs I've burned recently will skip the first time I play them, and they have scratches and smudges even the first time I put them in the drive to record onto them.
