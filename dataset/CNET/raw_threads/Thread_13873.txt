I don't think the power supply has anything to do with it. Forget about what it &quot;calls for.&quot; Computers don't use nearly as much power as they claim. a 300 watt supply is more than enough for any system. Besides, one graphics card hardly makes a dent... What is a normal PCI Express Slot? You should have said a PCI-Express (x16) slot. THE POWER SUPPLY HAS A LOT TO DO WITH IT!!! The ATI X800XL requires a 350Watt PSU, that's including CPU, DRIVES, ETC... And also oem psu (except dell) would never run at their written wattages, maybe when it was new. &quot;a 300 watt supply is more than enough for any system. Besides, one graphics card hardly makes a dent...&quot; A 300 watt is probably sufficient for a decent Pentium III, but bare minimum for a AMD AThlon 64 or Definitely a Pentium 4 Prescott. The X800XL definitely makes a big dent. ARE YOU BLIND, can you not see the huge fan on the card + the processor on that gfx card makes a good sized dent. BTW DAGGER, all of your posts were simply hilarious, as it seems you have no ******* clue as to what you're talking about. Roger
