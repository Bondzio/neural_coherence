quite frankly there just isn't that many hd makers.
off the top of my head, there is seagate, wd, samsung, hitatci and maxtor.
seagate now owns samsung a as well as maxtor.
any other label out there maybe a &quot;rebadged&quot; hd is different from those listed.
i have found seagate to do well to include wd brands.
i xclude any ext.
mounted drives and any 2.5in.
as well also anything ssd based.
tada -----willy :i
