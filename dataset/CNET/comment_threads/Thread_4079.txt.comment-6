Upgrade may even cost more than a new system.
With Vista so close at hand keeping an old system may just be a waste.
If Missj1235 can hold off with the camcorder side of it then buying a new system after bugs are out of Vista may be the way to go.
I have choosen to wait and see what comes out of the Microsoft OS works.
Maybe Missj1235 should look at what camcorder will meet the need and see what system will work it now.
Then see if up-grading old system will do or hold off till the smoke clears away from Vista.
I'm not sure but wouldn't a new system have to have Xp Media Center OS to have an OS upgrade ticket for Vista?
