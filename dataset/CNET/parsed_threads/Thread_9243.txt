<s> Hey everyone, I am having a problem with my network, I have a netgear router with a netgear pc adapter. </s>
<s> The connection is *very good*, but when I try to download the speeds vary from 8kb/s-&gt;20kb/s. </s>
<s> I have tried everything from calling Netgear to cleaning out my computer, nothing has worked. </s>
<s> If anyone might have any suggestions it would be very helpful. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> For instance it's HALF DUPLEX and shares the air space of other devices. </s>
<s> Add this that the wifi signal can travel out and reflect back to distort the transmission means that only under ideal conditions it's all good. </s>
<s> You didn't tell much in your post such as if you are following our suggestions in the forum sticky so I hope you can use that or tell us the full details. </s>

<s> Look for a Quality of Service setting in the router's program, it's possible the wireless has been throttled down there. </s>
<s> I had the exact opposite problem in which my two oldest using wireless would almost steal the entire bandwith, even though I was hardwired to the modem. </s>
<s> To slow them down and give me back bandwidth I disabled the WMM support and gave me High priority and them both Low priority settings. </s>
<s> Bandwidth control can also be enabled in such section. </s>
<s> Since you seem interested in faster wifi, just do the opposite. </s>
<s> I have always used wireless. </s>
<s> Just 2 weeks ago I was downloading at a constant 120 kb/s. </s>
<s> 10 days ago I installed a video card but I left the network card untouched, but after that the card has been acting weird. </s>
<s> I download at speed from 8-12kb/s which is very depressing. </s>
<s> Help would be appreciated.Thanks! </s>
<s> You didn't tell in either post so far. </s>
