so you are saying i probably would not see much if any difference?
that is all i wanted to know.
buy the way, compac says it has a 400 watt power supply.
it actually seems to run just fine for what i use it for so far,mild games, internet, and keeping track of expenses and what not.
my kids have a slightly newer comp.
with a 700 celeron and mine runs circles around it.
thank you
