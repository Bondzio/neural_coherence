in answer to your question... yes.
i have the same problem.
last night all was well.
today i could not acces my network.
i can get email over the network (via cable modem).
we have wireless (4) and wired - rj45 cat5e/6 (6) systmes in our network.
has worked fine for years.
everyone has a version of xp (pro, home, media.
i can use any previous links in network neighborhood work.
i can't even see my own shared drive on my computer.
if i use a previous link i can send files and run programs over the network.
if i try to click through on the same computer (my network places-&gt; entire network-&gt; microsoft windows network-&gt; workgroup name) it says network unavailable.
bull, i just used it through my prior link.
i tried to restore my system to a prior date but it did not fix the problem.
if anyone knows what to do i would love an answer.
i hate the idea of reformating my hard drive and starting all over again.
