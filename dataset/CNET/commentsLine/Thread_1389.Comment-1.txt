i presently have a amd duron 950 mhz computer with 368 mb of ram with a atx tower case & 250 power supply.windows xp with a 8x4x32cdr_cddrw and a dvd drive.
my problem is my hard drive is only 20 gb and i only have 3 gb left and was looking into purchasing a external hard drive but was told by a computer tech that i would be better off getting an upgraded computer with a better motherboard with an internal hard drive (160gb).
i only use my computer for the internet and storing my pictures and music.
what should i do, purchase an upgraded computer or put in a new 160 gb hard drive.
