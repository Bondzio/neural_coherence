typically, your interior hard drives can have an expectancy to last around 3 years average.
as far as exterior hard drives go, you can probably double that range since, for the most part, they are not running with your computer every time it is booted up.
now, depending upon how you keep it stored (usually in a cool, dry area), and the amount of time you use it will add to, or subtract from the time life of your exterior hard drive.
also, if you are able to, open up the device about every six months and take a can of pressurized air and blow out any excess dust that may be lingering.
i hope this helps!
