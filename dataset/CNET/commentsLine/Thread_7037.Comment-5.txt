witopia's personalvpn works great with macs.
my setup experience with hotspotvpn wasn't that smooth.
perhaps they've changed things or you're talking about their old pptp service??
certificates are a good thing and hotspotvpn uses them..just incorrectly..they load both the public and private key on your machine together instead of keeping one secured... yikes.
not sure what you mean about email..personalvpn works with any and all applications and mail packages as far as i know.
actually..they both are based on openvpn, so ultimately, it's the same service, but hotspotvpn is about 3 times the price!
and even more expensive if you want the 256bit encryption that you don't really need.
also, why do they charge more for higher encryption..how does that cost them more or is it a sales gimmick?
