<s> Two years ago, I bought this (obsolete) card new, solely because I believed that I needed a Decoder to work in conjunction with a USB 5.1 Sound Card. </s>
<s> I was not aware that this card was part of a complete sound system, including the DVD drive. </s>
<s> My computer is a COMPAQ Presario 6000 series, with which I use an NEC DVD ND-3520(in external enclosure) My question is; can I make any use of the CT7230, to my advantage, even only to improve my current graphics? </s>
<s> I down-loaded the User Guide for the PC-DVD Encore 6x Dxr3 card from Creative's excellent web-site, but this refers to a complete installation of the system. </s>
<s> Is it worth the effort to install the card in my PC and if so, what leads would I need and what would be the procedure? </s>
<s> All models of the DV6000 desktops I see can render DVD content without such a thing. </s>
<s> I'd sell that thing since it's far too hard on today's owners and is best for those that want DVD play on a Pentium 2 machine. </s>

<s> Thanks, Bob, I'll take your advice and abandon the project. </s>
<s> I don't think anyone would want this museum piece. </s>
<s> Gordon. </s>
<s> Hi Gordon; How did you find the manual for this card ? </s>
<s> I can not find any way to download info from Creative's website. </s>
<s> Not to mention they no longer support this card. </s>
<s> I also bought one. </s>
<s> with no driver or manual. </s>
<s> thanks </s>
<s> Have you found the drivers, if not I have a ct7260 which may work I can duplicate the installation CD for you. </s>
