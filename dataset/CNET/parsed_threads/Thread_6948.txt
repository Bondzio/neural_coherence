<s> Fellow members, I recently installed a new hard drive. </s>
<s> In my efforts to get the thing working I must have changed some setting in BIOS, which I had to fool with, because now the system is doing a tedious RAM check routine on the black screen with each boot. </s>
<s> It takes a couple of precious minutes to count up to 512. fyi it is Ami BIOS. </s>
<s> I cannot discover any changes to make in BIOS setup to disable it. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The setup shows the SMART drive feature is disabled. </s>
<s> I would like it running. </s>
<s> also post the mobo type to give a clue lots of ami bios'. </s>
<s> Check the mobo manual which usually describes which bios features are in your bios and what they do. </s>
<s> Make sure that in adding the drive you did not unseat the memory or that you have not created a heat situation. </s>
<s> It also sounds as if you may have added a bios add-on with the drive. </s>
<s> Knowing your O/S will also give a better clue. </s>
<s> You need to enable quick post (power on self test). </s>
<s> I think it's in advanced bios setup. </s>
<s> May depend on your bios version. </s>
<s> OS Doesn't matter. </s>
<s> Save and exit. </s>
<s> Thanks for the info. </s>
<s> It has stopped doing that foolishness. </s>
<s> Anyway it was saying &quot;testing NV RAM&quot; - which means Non-Volatile RAM -- which makes no sense. </s>
