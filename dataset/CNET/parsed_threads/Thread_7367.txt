<s> I recently got a Nvidia GeForce 8400GS PCI card and had it installed and working fine in a 4-year old eMachines. </s>
<s> But I removed the card before swapping it for a nearly new eMachines W3650. </s>
<s> For some reason, the card doesn't work in the new computer. </s>
<s> It's physically installed OK, it's got power; the cooling fins get very warm, the drivers loaded OK, and I disabled the onboard graphics. </s>
<s> Device Manager says it's &quot;working properly&quot;, for what that's worth. </s>
<s> When I plug the monitor cable into the card, there's nothing. </s>
<s> Black screen. </s>
<s> Am I missing something, or could the card have died somehow? </s>
<s> But we all know that 8400 and 8600 chips may have a limited life span. </s>
<s> While the big news was all about the mobile 8400M defects, that is being seen in the desktop cards. </s>
<s> Type 8400 DEFECTIVE on google. </s>
<s> Sorry to read about your loss. </s>
<s> And of course, check your work. </s>
<s> Power off, re-seat it, etc. </s>

<s> It was only used for less than 10 hours. </s>
<s> What I need to do is try it in another computer. </s>
<s> I get them to fix and play with from time to time, as this one is. </s>
<s> I'd rather not try it in my &quot;main&quot; computer. </s>
<s> It cost less than $40 at Newegg. </s>
<s> Try the reseating and then you have a warranty issue. </s>
<s> When you swapped the Video card from the old to the new machine did you use the same Monitor. </s>
<s> If yes then good. </s>
<s> Have you tried swapping the VGA card back to the old machine? </s>
<s> Did it work? </s>
<s> If yes then your card doesn't have any problem. </s>
<s> Try checking your new machine, do you have other VGA cards that is working with the new computer? </s>
<s> It is also possible that you need to connect the Monitor/LCD into a DVI-connector instead of regular Serial/video cable on your VGA card. </s>
<s> Good luck on your PC. </s>
<s> The card seats fine, as I've inserted it 3 different times. </s>
<s> Yes, I'm using the same monitor. </s>
<s> I will look around for a DVI cable. </s>
<s> The old machine, where it worked, is now in use at my son-in-law's house. </s>
<s> No other extra VGA card on hand. </s>
<s> But one way or another, I'll dig up a piece of hardware so I can prove whether the card is bad or not. </s>
<s> I still have mfg. </s>
<s> warranty time. </s>
<s> Thanks for your suggestions. </s>
<s> My biggest concern was that it was something I wasn't doing right. </s>
<s> Have you fixed your problem yet? </s>
<s> Any progress? </s>
<s> It took awhile to determine; I needed the right equipment to try things. </s>
<s> It looks like the card is dead. </s>
<s> It's a PCI graphics card, but I tried a PCI-Express graphics card, which worked ok. Then I needed something to try in the PCI slot, so I used a PCI-USB card, which worked fine. </s>
<s> I haven't had the opportunity to try this PCI graphics card in another computer, but if the PCI slot works ok, then I'm convinced it's the card that doesn't work. </s>
<s> I'm working on RMAing it. </s>
<s> You got the root cause of the problem. </s>
<s> Good for you. </s>
