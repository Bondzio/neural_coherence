<s> I want to link two towers together as one system. </s>
<s> I do not wish to use two monitors or two keyboards or two OSs. </s>
<s> My newer primary PC would be the link to the net. </s>
<s> One printer would be used for both. </s>
<s> How can this be done? </s>
<s> How can I marry them together without creating a network of machines? </s>
<s> What would I need? </s>
<s> I have an old PC that I would like to use for its resources .... CPU, drives etc., to enhance my current system. </s>
<s> Can I marry them together without creating a network? </s>
<s> What about the OSs, Can I use one OS to run both towers? </s>
<s> Is this possible? </s>
<s> Your post has all the details why this won't work. </s>
<s> Also since Windows may be what you run, that's a second reason you can't do this. </s>
<s> Sorry about that. </s>

<s> Will need an OS on each machine though. </s>
<s> As for sharing the resources/drives, you are going to need a network to share drives/storage. </s>
<s> If you are using a router already then that will prbably have at least 4 ports on it. </s>
<s> just get yourself a network cable or two and your done. </s>
<s> Else get a crossover cable (not a normal network cable)and plug it straight from one machines network card to the other. </s>
<s> This one might do it, it has sound too ............ http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817107417 They are called KVM switches/devices and are used with gaming consoles it seems. </s>
<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch I noticed for the link I provided above both ISP addresses need to be the same for both towers to use the net as one single machine. </s>
<s> Drive letters also are of some concern. </s>
<s> Using two C: drives being problematic fore instance. </s>
<s> I'm all most certain the same brand of OS would be needed due to file extension problems for one example. </s>
<s> Hmmmm, I do have an old ME OS around here somewhere. </s>
<s> This router might do (I do wish it had a firewall. </s>

<s> LOL Yep, that's much simpler and cheaper too. </s>
