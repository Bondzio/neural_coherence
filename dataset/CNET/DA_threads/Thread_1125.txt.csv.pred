1.1.1	Hi, I am really green in networking, I have never made a network myself.	St
1.1.2	I have a desktop PC sitting on my desktop, having a cable modem connected to its Ethernet card.	St
1.1.3	The problem is I bought a laptop and I would like to connect the two PCs, without unplugging the cable modem, so I can use internet on both computers.	St
1.1.4	Do I need to buy anything to do this?	St
1.1.5	What else should I do?	St
1.1.6	Both PCs run WinXP Pro.	St
1.2.1	Look at the DSL/Cable modem ROUTERS.	St
1.2.2	From 10 to about 99 bucks.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Hey Heres a real easy one I just did it I bought a linkys 4 port router and plugged it in to the modem and wala I now have connection to my laptop it cost me around 80 bucks I got the G because thats what matched my card in my laptop so check what card you have in your laptop and match with the router good luck Just follow the directions and you should be fine Havey	St

1.5.1	Thanks for all the responses.	St
1.5.2	I am looking forward to buy a router.	St
1.5.3	Isn't there any other way?	St
1.6.1	Yes there is.	St
1.6.2	But they have already told you the easiest and least problematic way.	St
1.6.3	If you are so &quot;green&quot; (your word) with networking, I would not recommend some other way.	St
1.7.1	Wouldn't be easier and cheaper to buy another Ethernet adapter for my desktop computer, connect it to the cable modem and use the other to connect directly to my laptop?	St
1.7.2	Or to buy a hub and connect all devices to it?	St
1.7.3	Would it work with XP's Internet Connection Sharing?	St
1.7.4	I only need this solution for a short time, it would be a temporary.	St
1.8.1	While I know all that one needs in at http://www.wown.com the issue is that many can't research such ICS setups or will install a firewall before getting it to work.	St
1.8.2	About the comment about a HUB.	St
1.8.3	Such is an invalid configuration and a few get rather tense that no one can make it work.	St
1.8.4	Just because you can plug the cables in, doesn't mean it will do the job.	St
1.8.5	Also, with routers spotted at 9.99 and up, that hub will likely cost that much so why not do it right?	St
1.8.6	Bob	St
1.9.1	Ok, I will buy a router.	St
1.9.2	Thanks for your help.	Polite
1.9.3	If the hub-type connection is invalid, then Microsoft is stupid.	St
1.9.4	If you have windows XP, open its help and search for network and click on 'Walkthrough: Home networking' on the right.	St
1.9.5	Click on 'sample setups' and view the picture below the 'computers in the same room' text.	St
1.10.1	You should have no problem using a router and CABLES, not WiFi.	St
1.10.2	Want proof?	St
1.10.3	Read the post titled &quot;Surprised to find network at home: what to do?&quot; in this forum and you'll see what I mean.	St
1.10.4	Contrary to popular(?)	St
1.10.5	belief, at this time there is NO security in a wireless connection.	St
1.10.6	Until there are industrial improvements in the architecture of WiFi, it isn't worth the money invested.	St
1.10.7	Do you see corporations flocking to convert to wireless?	St
1.10.8	No, why not?	St
1.10.9	Because it isn't secure enough.	St
1.10.10	Period.	St
1.10.11	It doesn't matter what features you enable, how you set it up, or even if you encrypt the signal, nothing is enough.	St
1.10.12	There isn't a &quot;safe&quot; wireless router on the market.	St
1.10.13	You cannot control an airwave.	St
1.10.14	You CAN deceive yourself and pretend you have a safe network, but you don't.	St
1.10.15	I am a tech (A+, N+, Windows 2000 Professional, and Windows 2000 Advanced Server certs) with a degree in Computer Science.	St
1.10.16	You want professional advice?	St
1.10.17	Go wired.	St
