yes, i understand most of the things about back up, but not everything.
when i purchased my computer, the first thing i did was make recovery disks.
i had one large external drive so i had a friend ghost my computer after i went to windows 7. i put that drive away for safe keeping.
i also made a repair disk.
so i am pretty well fixed for now.
i just want this disk for backing up important information about the pc on a regular basis and maybe add some photos and music.
now, here's the latest news that i may need some help with.
i thought i had this disk backed up, but now ,not so sure.
when i go to explorer and right click the drive-properties, it has zeros like nothing is on it.
it lists two headings that i used but when i click one,it brings up the restore box.
thats the one i used after i did the install.
the other one is supposed to be the important information and when i click it, a message says that there is nothing to read it with.
now, i really feel stupid and don't know what to do.
should i format the drive and start over?
if so, could you explain to me just how to do the process?
i thought i knew, but it seems like i didn't know what i was doing.
sorry to make this so long, but thought you would need the entire story if you can help me.
thanks again for any help you can give me.
