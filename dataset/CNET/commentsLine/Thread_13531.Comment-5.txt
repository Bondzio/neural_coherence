it might be best if i hire someone to come out and do all this.
the last thing i need to do is spend an enourmous amount of time trying to learn all this.
i hate to hire anyone to do anything around here, because it's not a matter of &quot;if you will get screwed&quot; just to what degree.
i did buy a new router today though, a cisco 1721. a couple of questions.
since our program is web based does it increase or decrease security risks like the ones you mentioned in the discussion?
how secure does a pediatric clinic really need to be anyway?
who would want to hack into that?
or am i way to careless with regards to security?
thanks for taking time explaining everything, i really appreciate it.
