I have tried the Magic Mouse, Logitech, and Microsoft mice and they all track slow while using the Mac OS. The Logitech and Microsoft mice track fine with Windows. Tracking speed is turned up to the max with the Mac OS. I understand that third party software such as better touch tool and others (don't recall the names). Will they help and are they safe downloads? Do you suggest a particular one? Thanks.

If not, that could explain the slow tracking. How is OS X with the mouse that came with the Mac, if there was one? I wonder what sort of Mac and version of OS X you have. P
