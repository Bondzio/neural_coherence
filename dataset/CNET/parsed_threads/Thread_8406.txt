<s> I have Vista Premium. </s>
<s> The main computer [ACER Aspire 4736 laptop] is connected via NIC to a ZyXEL P-320W wireless router which is in turn connected to a ZyXEL P-660 ASDL2 modem... Other computers connect wirelessly. </s>
<s> This setup used to work. </s>
<s> However, there are now frequently line d http://forums.cnet.com/laptops-forums/rops : When the ASDL2 modem is booted up, it detects the DSL line and automatically connects to the Internet[nailed up connection]. </s>
<s> The router is then booted up, followed by the main computer. </s>
<s> At this time, the Internet is still being connected, as indicated by the &quot;Internet activity&quot; light of the modem. </s>
<s> However, as soon as a browser is clicked, Internet connection is lost - the DSL light goes out, then starts blinking, the modem then detects the DSL line and automatically connection to the Internet. </s>
<s> The browser then shows the web site. </s>
<s> However, as soon as a link within the webpage is clicked, Internet connection is lost again....and the DSL light goes out... the cycle repeats itself... </s>
<s> This also happens to other computers connected wirelessly. </s>
<s> However, once in a while, there are no problems. </s>
<s> What can cause this to happen ? </s>
<s> There seems to be no static on the service line. </s>
<s> Shall I replace the modem ? </s>
<s> The P-660HW has it's own wifi and router. </s>
<s> Setup could be classified as &quot;experts only&quot; when you add a second router. </s>
<s> Given only model numbers and no details about settings it is time to ask those that set this up to see if the settings are proper. </s>
<s> I can't tell such from your post except it's not a stock or standard setup. </s>
<s> Again the P-660HW is more than a modem. </s>
<s> I couldn't find a P-660. </s>

<s> Thank you, Bob, for your reply. </s>
<s> I am sorry for some misinformation. </s>
<s> The modem is actually a ADSL2+Router model P-660R. </s>
<s> There is no wireless. </s>
<s> If you are unable to find it, it may be an older model. </s>
<s> Setup: DSL line to the P-660R from which CAT5 cable to the P-320W (LAN port instead of WAN port) [ odd ? </s>
<s> advanced setup ?] </s>
<s> The main computer connects to the P-320W (LAN port) with its [the main computer]NIC. </s>
<s> The DHCP server of the P-320W has been disabled, leaving the one at the P-660R enabled. </s>
<s> The IP address of the P-320W has been changed slightly [to 192.168.1.0] because it is the same as that of the P-660R [192.168.1.1] The P-660R has been configured as a router instead of as a bridge. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, the person who performed the above set up is no longer around. </s>
<s> Connection type is PPPoE. </s>
<s> Thank you for your kind attention. </s>

<s> The .0 address is usually reserved as a broadcast address. </s>
<s> I'd reconsider that choice. </s>
