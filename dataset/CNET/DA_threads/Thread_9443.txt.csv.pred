1.1.1	Hi everyone !	St
1.1.2	My home ADSL+ is connected via a Thomson Gateway TG782T router/modem , and our wireless laptops access the 'net through this .	St
1.1.3	I have a Netgear DG834G wireless router/modem in another room that has an XBox 360 connected to it via a network cable .	St
1.1.4	My problem is that I want the 2 modems to be able to talk to eachother , so I can access the 'net on the XBox 360 , like this : XB0x 360 - DG834G - TG782T - Net I 've added the TG782T 's MAC address to the Netgear 's 'allowed devices ' list , but do n't know if I need to do add the Netgear MAC address to the Thomson modem 's list of devices .	St
1.1.5	Both are using the same kind of encryption .	St
1.1.6	If anyone can throw some light on this thread , feel free ! !	St
1.1.7	Cheers , all !	St
1.2.1	A wireless router can only talk to devices that appear to be a end device .	St
1.2.2	To get a 2 routers to talk to each other you must set one to client mode or bridge mode .	Sug
1.2.3	Although more routers are starting to have this feature it is not common .	St
1.2.4	Check your router to see if it has this feature but they still tend to be tricky to setup because of the security .	St
1.2.5	There are devices made to do this called wireless adapters or wireless extenders but those terms are used fairly loosely .	St
