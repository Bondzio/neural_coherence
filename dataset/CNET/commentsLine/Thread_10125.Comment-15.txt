air flow depends upon the ability to push undesirable hot air out and pull cooling air in.
sounds obvious but: imagine a straw with one hole at each end.
it is simple to push air through the system as pressure is focused.
now punch a series of holes and your not getting much air out, as seen by how you have to sit down after the effort :&gt; same with cutting holes in the case.
the fans are not assisted by pressure to push the air out.
same goes for just placing fans anywhere.
my strategy is having the front case fan pull air in and the rear case as an exhaust.
its just a matter of which way you face the fan.
leaving the side covers off just invites dust and real bugs, not to mention the integrity of the case is compromised--- for those who stack hardware.
my speciality is on software, yet the idea of memory and hd cooling fans is met with skepticism.
same for the double cpu cooling fan.
this is a great msg thread.
