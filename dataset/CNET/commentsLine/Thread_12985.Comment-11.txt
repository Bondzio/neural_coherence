solid state hdds have been around for quite sometime now.
the first ones i recall were sold in 2000. i know for a fact one of my customers has 2 of them installed in a front end data base application due to their very low latency.
our solid state disks were manufactured by quantum at a cost of about $13000/per disk with a capacity of 536mb.
my company only sold about 16 of them in the whole us.
the cost may seem extremely high, but these drives were used in an enterprise systems environment whereas a normal hdd can cost upwards of $2000 anyway.
quantum has since been bought by maxtor and the solid state drive discontinued due to slow sales.
the disk was actually like a block of memory with a battery backup in a standard 1&quot; high 3.5&quot; form factor.
solid state disks will make a comeback, but i fear it won't be anytime soon.
