<s> I just got a Gigabyte EP45-UD3P motherboard, and was going to install an OEM splash screen, using the included utility that came with the motherboard. </s>
<s> I ran the utility, and Windows bluescreened on me. </s>
<s> When I turn it on, the computer says: Award BootBlock BIOS v1.0 Copyright (c) 2000, Award Software, Inc. and then it just hangs. </s>
<s> Any tips? </s>
<s> It won't do anything from there. </s>
<s> Now it says: Scanning BIOS Image in Hard Drive... Bios Auto-Recovering It has been at this for 20 minutes with no luck </s>
<s> It's amazing what happens when you remove all IDE drives... </s>
<s> BIOS recovery features not found on other MBs. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
