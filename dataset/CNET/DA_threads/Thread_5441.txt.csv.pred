1.2.1	While building a PC is a time honored tradition, is that the goal or is getting the work done the real goal?	St
1.2.2	For fast desktops I suggest any of the quad or six core Intel i7 machines with 4GB RAM to start, Windows 7 64 bit and a nice graphics card.	St
1.2.3	Start at the Nvidia GT220 with 1GB RAM and go up from there.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the suggestions R Well, my goal is to invest in a machine that get my work done basically ofcourse, and also that wouldn't require me to spend time and money on upgrading later (someday or the other time will come but...until then) I am thinking of I7 CPU at the moment with least 4gbRAM, a good GPU ATI/MSI/NVidia.	St
1.3.2	The problem is i have been outdated with all the new hardware avaiable in the market today.	St
1.3.3	Motherboards, GPUs, dualGPUs etc.	St

1.4.2	and pop in a new GPU.	St
1.4.3	We're done in a flash and back to work.	St
