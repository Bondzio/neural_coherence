This is not an offer to teach Windows basics.
But here's how I enable 1024x768 or larger on my netbook.

This has been supported since Windows 95 days but as there is no standard to enable it I often find myself fishing for the settings when I get a new machine.
I have the Acer you have something else so I can't be specific except to tell you this is a non-problem.
