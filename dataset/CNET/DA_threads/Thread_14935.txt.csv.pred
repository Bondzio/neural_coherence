1.1.1	It 's well past time to replace my aging Dell 4600 .	St
1.1.2	My needs are simple : browsing , spreadsheet , word processing , music , no gaming , but I complicate the situation by keeping lots of instances of browser windows , each with multiple tabs , open all the time , so memory is important as well as whatever demands the multiple windows put on the graphics and other parts of the system .	St
1.1.3	I will buy a mobo with CPU and build out around them , and will use XP , either Home or Pro , but unsure if Pro is important to me Considering my system use : I guess the first question is whether I should opt for a quad or duo core .	St
1.1.4	So balancing cost and possible future developments , which of these do you recommend and why ?	Ques
1.1.5	Also what is important in terms of the various buses , memory types , and how many memory sockets , PCI-16 , etc ?	Ques
1.1.6	What minimum power PSU ?	Ques
1.1.7	I have a Diamond Viper 512MB X1650Pro which I would like to use instead of buying a new graphics card .	St
1.1.8	Is this adequate for my needs ?	Ques
1.1.9	I do not require state of the art , which by the time I get my system built and running the way I want it will not be state of the art anymore anyway .	St
1.1.10	The extra cost of the latest and greatest would not be a good outlay for me as my needs are simple .	St
1.1.11	TIA	St
1.2.1	When you build a machine , copy what others have done at sites like tomshardware.com , anandtech.com and others .	St
1.2.2	After you read a few you 'll get an idea about power supply sizes .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for that suggestion .	St
1.3.2	I have already done a bit of looking at how others are building .	St
1.3.3	Copying someone else 's build without knowing how they work might not be applicable to solving my issues .	St
1.3.4	This is the reason that I have described my current use ( window overload ) and mentioned my current computer .	St
1.3.5	The decison for me is whether to try to improve the 4600 or to build a new one on the expectation that faster and more ram , and the duo core cpu , added to the ability to use the Diamond card ( the 4600 only has PCI , not PCI Express slots ) .	St
1.3.6	One reason I thought to build my own is that I have the video card , extra CD and DVD writers , ATA hard drives , an Antec 500 watt PSU and case , so the main ingredients needed are only mobo , cpu , and ram .	St
1.3.7	One question here is whether SATA hdds would be helpful in dealing with my needs .	St
1.3.8	( The 4600 does have SATA connectors on the mobo , BTW . )	St
1.3.9	Any thoughts appreciated .	Polite
1.4.1	Since it 's a Dell or such , that OS ( Windows ) is likely to be an OEM so factor that into your costs in case it does n't activate on your new motherboard .	St
1.4.2	The power supply looks good for all but dual video cards , many hard disks , etc so I 'd stop there .	St
1.4.3	As to Sata drives , these feel no faster to me than the old drives .	St
1.4.4	But be sure you are ready with the needed driver diskettes or ask if your new board emulates IDE to ease the install of the Windows OS .	St
1.4.5	And NO .	St
1.4.6	Windows does n't like such changes so we usually get to start over .	St
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	Any other thoughts as to justification for new computer ?	Ques
1.5.2	Will the Diamond card help with my window overload issue ?	Ques
1.5.3	Will faster buses and memory make any difference to my use ?	Ques
1.5.4	Or should I just re-install my 4600 , bring memory up to 2GB and buy an older graphics that will work in the Dell ?	Ques
1.6.1	Either a great quality 450 Watt PSU or 500+ in the no-names .	St
1.6.2	Armed with such a box I expect you could play a game like & quot ; The Orange Box & quot ; but not Crysis or Bioshock .	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	Bob , Are you saying go with the 4600 and also upgrade the PSU ?	Ques
1.7.2	Please note : & quot ; My needs are simple : browsing , spreadsheet , word processing , music , no gaming & quot ;	Sug
1.8.1	That card is more about gaming and is a primary reason I 'd boost the power supply .	St
