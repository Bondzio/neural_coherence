sorry but that's not possible.
i can't come there to do that.
i will however share i've cured the chipmunk playback with installing the latest motherboard and audio drivers.
there are no buttons in windows we use to get drivers.
so we have to do this the old fashioned way.
-&gt; thank you for digging up the model and part names since i can't be exact without them.
here we go.
rather than try just the audo drivers, let's just do all the drivers i would.
1. motherboard chipset drivers are at  i'd use item 2.
2. audio drivers are at this link good luck, bob
