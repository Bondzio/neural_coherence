ok so I got on my computer one day and I couldn't listen to music.
I went control panel, then to sound and audio devices, and where it used to say the sound card I have, it just says no audio devices.
I know I have a sound card, but I think my sound card might have come loose or something when I was messing with my computer.
I have no idea how to check or anything.
Can someone please help me to figure out how to get my sound card to work?
thanks
