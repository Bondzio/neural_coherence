i replaced the power supply in my computer.
everything seemed good but, when i plug a thumb drive into either usb port on the front, they don't work and , worse, they disable the mouse and keyboard so i have to do a hard shutdown.
rebooting re-enables the mouse and keyboard until i try the front ports again.
what have i done wrong?
