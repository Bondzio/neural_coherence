Thanks for the info, Bob.
I've read Microsoft's cautions about that utility and it makes me nervous.
By the way, my sound came back after I bought and installed Registry Mechanic.
It found hundreds of errors which have now all been repaired.
I still can't get backup to launch but at least I've got a clean registry and have sound.
