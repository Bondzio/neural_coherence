<s> you want to have the PSP connect to the wireless card on your PC, correct? </s>
<s> Rick </s>
<s> correct! </s>
<s> The ADHOC setup would apply. </s>
<s> But you might be asking for more than a connection. </s>
<s> But until you decide if its worth asking, this will the the ANSWER. </s>
<s> Set it up as ADHOC and you can connect to the PC. </s>
<s> But missing from your post is what such a connection would do. </s>
<s> What documentation? </s>
<s> The link I supplied. </s>
<s> i just want an unoffical driver for dwl-g122 that it will make my dwl-g122 with a purpose such as routher i want that i able to find the &quot;dwl-g122&quot; in the infrastructure mode in psp and i will able to connect and surf in the psp browser i think it called gateaway mode(sharing the cable modem by the &quot;dwl g-122&quot; ).but in the &quot;offical&quot; driver it dosent exsits therfore i need another driver that include gateway mode </s>
<s> It appears you want your PC to substitute for the router. </s>
<s> I will NOT help you get this to work but will tell you the articles and methods that were used a few years ago. </s>
<s> The problem is that there are so many steps involved and with today's firewalls most owners can't get it to work anymore. </s>
<s> Since it's a TARPIT of issues the smart people don't do this anymore. </s>
<s> They get a router. </s>
<s> So here goes. </s>
<s> You will be installing ICS on the PC. </s>
<s> You can use this link as example on what to do next -&gt; http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/networking/expert/bowman_02april08.mspx </s>
<s> i success with the first part but the &quot;client&quot; is a PSP so i cant do the setting shown there </s>
<s> You have to understand networking. </s>
<s> Some can't deal with anyone telling them a generic answer such as &quot;set the gateway&quot; but need a video or pictures that match the exact screens you'll encounter. </s>
<s> I have yet to find a cure for such an issue. </s>

<s> The cheapest I found is a refurb at frys. </s>
<s> 20 bucks. </s>
<s> Since you can't accomplish the ADHOC and ICS setups you need to move to the usual solutions. </s>
<s> i know that i can buy but i want to use with what i have sorry that i dont mention yet but with &quot;MSI US54G&quot; i was able to make a access point with this chipset and i success to connect to him with my PSP and surfing internet and playing multiplayer games because in this chipset there is the &quot;gateway mode&quot; that sharing my cable modem throw &quot;us54g&quot; to PSP or other devices, but now it broken therfore i bought the DWL-g122 eventualy its quite the same device (the &quot;us54g&quot; and the G122) but in this device there is no &quot;gateaway mode&quot; so i ask from you to give me another driver that include that thanks for who will help now i am sure you got me PLEASE HELP! </s>
<s> Try other wifi gear since you seem to have hit a dead end with the DWL-g122. </s>
<s> there isnt out there some generic driver that i will able to configure the dwl-g122 as a access point or gateaway it must have some </s>
<s> All that we have has been discussed above. </s>
<s> Sometimes owners really don't want to dive into it so they move to the router and software like Network Magic. </s>
<s> In closing, if there was a clue in your posts I'd point it out but as you present the issues there is nothing amiss unless you didn't do the setup proper or firewalled it. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> i guess i will move to routher </s>
