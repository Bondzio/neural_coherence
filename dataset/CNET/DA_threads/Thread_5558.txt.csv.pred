1.2.3	It might give you the best range , and you would n't have an external device that you can lose .	St
1.2.4	Check with gateway to see if there is a recommended card : https : //support.gateway.com/support/copilot/chat_sales.shtml ? id=400010 There are many wireless-g PC Card/PCMCIA adapters and USB adapters in the stores .	St
