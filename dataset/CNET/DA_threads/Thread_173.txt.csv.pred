1.1.1	So I made a custom PC few months ago , and It works perfectly , its ' temp was normal , everything was plugged in right , but after 2 months , my PC started to make loud fan noise .	St
1.1.2	So when I checked it 's ( CPU ) temperature it was 61 C on idle .	St
1.1.3	With no programs on .	St
1.1.4	I checked the AMD processor website and choose my CPU .	St
1.1.5	It says it can only handle up to 62 C ...	St
1.1.6	So I checked my CPU , and apparently I put too much thermal paste and it leaked to the bottom of my chip ( but very very little amount ) .	St
1.1.7	So I got some 99 % USP Isopropyl Alcohol and cleaned it very carefully .	St
1.1.8	Then I applied new thermal paste .	St
1.1.9	But it still does that ... . Also by the way there is a tiny crack on the top of the CPU ... .	St
1.1.10	The heatsink/fan has tiny amount of thermal paste on it .	St
1.1.11	& lt ; div & gt ; My PC specs .	St
1.1.12	CPU-AMD Phenom II x4 955BE CPU cooler-Regular stock fan that came with the CPU GPU-MSI r6450 2gb gddr3 PSU-Corsair CX430 430w RAM-8gb ddr3 *2 case fans ( 120mm ) * & lt ; /div & gt ; I hope you could help me , thanks	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	On hw monitor , it says Temp 1 = 61C and Temp 2 = 58C for the case	St
1.4.1	You would n't expect the CPU to be any cooler than the case ?	Ques
1.4.2	Would you ?	Ques
1.4.3	Now there are some newer folk that think they can add more case fans but for many builders and gamers they just leave the side cover off .	St
1.4.4	If I have the time I head to my shop area to carve out a square foot out of the cover then I hot glue screen or speaker mesh over that .	St

1.5.1	Try changing the heatsink on the cpu generally stock coolers are not that powerful while running high appplication the cpu utilization is more .	St
1.5.2	and as per you said just cheak that any particles of thermal paste is on the cpu or near cpu pins .	St
1.5.3	you can clean the thermal compound by using antec thermal removing compound .	St
1.5.4	and never experiment with things which you do n't know always call a computer technician or the person who knows this all stuff	St
1.6.1	NIL	St
1.7.1	Go for a custom cpu cooler it will solve your problem as stock cooler are not of better quality .	St
1.8.1	NIL	St
