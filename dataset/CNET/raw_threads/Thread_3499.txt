You might be able to hit that budget, if you watch slickdeals.net, and fatwallet.com for special deals which may or may not involve a few hundred dollals in rebates. I got a $3000.00 pc for $1500.00 on a special sale, and got a $2000.00 pc for $1200.00 on a special sale. I've seen deals for around $300.00 for decent pc's which have the ability to be upgraded. Just make sure that whatever you get has PCI express slot. Future games will need at least that.
