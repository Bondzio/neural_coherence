hello, have an older dell laptop.
the monitor went dark, smelled that characteristic toasted hardware smell coming from location near the power button (top, middle area) and soon after shut itself down.
when i reboot, the screen lights up and after it boots fully the screen goes dark and it shuts down again after a few minutes.
what could be the issue?
