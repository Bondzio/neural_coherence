<s> Hello, I have an iBook G3, and when I start it I get the folder/question mark in the middle of the screen. </s>
<s> I wanted to try with the hardware test disk but I can not insert the disk. </s>
<s> The door want open. </s>
<s> Is there a way to open the door other than pressing F12 key. </s>
<s> Thanks J.K. </s>
<s> on the door of the CD tray, you will see a small hole. </s>
<s> Take a straightened paper clip, preferably one that fits in the hole and gently push it into the hole. </s>
<s> You should hear a little click and then the tray will open. </s>
<s> Before you do that, make sure that you do not already have a CD in the tray, it should be visible on the desktop if there is one in there, and if there is, drag it to the trash. </s>
<s> That will make it eject. </s>
<s> Of course, if there is nothing in there, do the first suggestion let us know what happens P </s>
<s> Thank you for the suggestion, it worked. </s>
<s> I opened the door by using a paper clip. </s>
<s> Now I have a problem that the door won't close? </s>
<s> Sometimes it needs a little persuasion right at the end P </s>
<s> I managed to close the door. </s>
<s> When holding the C key (C letter not ctrl key ? </s>
<s> )nothing happens. </s>
<s> When holding down the alt key, I get 2 icons each with an arrow inside. </s>
<s> One straight arrow pointing to the right and the other curved like unclosed circle pointing also to the right. </s>
<s> And a cursor in the shape of a watch. </s>
<s> Nothing happens when clicking either icons. </s>
<s> After a long while text appears where among other things it is written &#8243;type mac-boot and press return&#8221; but nothing happens when i do that. </s>
<s> Any suggestions what I could do next? </s>
<s> Thanks a lot </s>
<s> hold it down at the first chime and keep it down until you see the grey apple and the spinning wheel. </s>
<s> The option key will show you all available Boot disks that the system sees. </s>
<s> They are represented by the icons that you saw. </s>
<s> If it does not display the CD that you have inserted, then the system does not recognise it as a valid startup disk. </s>
<s> This could be because the CD drive is defective or that the disk itself is not correct or is damaged. </s>
<s> The flashing question mark indicates that the system cannot find the system folder on the HD. </s>
<s> Either a corrupt system or a dead HD. </s>
<s> Keep trying the &quot;C&quot; route for a while. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> Unfortunately &#8243;C&#8221; route did not work. </s>
<s> I can hear the CD drive beginning to spin but then only folder with the question mark appears again. </s>
