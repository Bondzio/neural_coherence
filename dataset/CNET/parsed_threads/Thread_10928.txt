<s> I cannot believe I am having this much trouble finding a laser printer that prints on 80 lbs (216 gsm) coverstock that is 3 1/2&quot; x 4 7/8&quot; - typical 4bar or A1 flat card size. </s>
<s> Why is this not something that laser printers can do? </s>
<s> Again, I want to be able to print on an A1 flat card size piece of coverstock (80 lbs or 216 gsm). </s>
<s> Anyone have any ideas?? </s>
<s> Thanks for your help! </s>
<s> https://www.google.com/#safe=off&sclient=psy-ab&q=laser+printer+80+lbs for example finds prior discussions. </s>
<s> You can hit hp.com and it's chat button among other makers to ask directly. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> That's why i am asking here. </s>
<s> The key to this question is the SIZE of the paper (A1/4bar/3 1/2&quot;x4 7/8&quot;) AND the thickness of 80# or 216GSM. </s>
<s> I have been on the phone/online chat with HP, Xerox and Dell and seems most of the people answering the phones cannot understand what 3.5&quot; wide means, let alone 4 7/8&quot; in height. </s>
<s> Does ANYONE know of a laser printer that can print on an A1 flat card (3 1/2&quot; x 4 7/8&quot;) size piece of coverstock (80 lbs or 216 gsm). </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> I read http://www.shopping.hp.com/en_US/home-office/-/products/Printers/HP-LaserJet/CC489A and see this. </s>
<s> &quot; postcard, 3 x 5 in, 4 x 6 in&quot; So while it hit your weight of the paper it missed the 5 inch side by 1/8 inch. </s>
<s> It appears nothing does this. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> This appears to be something your print shops produce. </s>
<s> I think they would consider a printer like this one. </s>

<s> Now you see the reason for the post, Bob? </s>
<s> Actually most smaller print shops buy the 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; cardstock (80#) paper, print and then have it cut to size. </s>
<s> All printers I have seen say they can handle custom sizes from width of 3&quot; to 8.5&quot; and height of 5&quot; to 14&quot;, which means they are all short by 1/8th inch in height. </s>
<s> Why the hell a manufacturer wouldn't make a printer that accepts A1 flat card size is beyond me. </s>
<s> Since it is a standard and not much of a difference. </s>
<s> Geez. </s>
<s> Thanks for the info on the fladbed printers, but I am not paying $10K for a printer. </s>
<s> SO the question is still there: Does ANYONE know of a laser printer that can print on an A1 flat card (3 1/2&quot; x 4 7/8&quot;) size piece of coverstock (80 lbs or 216 gsm)? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> And let's be honest. </s>
<s> We have for years exceeded the specs on paper weight on many printers. </s>
<s> Sure the warranty is not going to be honored but you smile as you put your 120lb stock through the straight path and it works. </s>
<s> It's possible that that printer will work with the 1/8 inch shy stock but are you running into folk that DEMAND it be in the specs and not go with what may work? </s>
<s> And yes, this is why we had a sheer in the print shop. </s>
<s> Print it on a stock size then cut to size. </s>
<s> It's been an amazing journey as I see folk that wonder how we got edge to edge printing on such stock. </s>
<s> We never did. </s>
<s> We printed then put it in the sheer cutter. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You need to visit the vendor websites and check the specs. </s>
<s> I suspect you went to the common ones, but overall if you want cheap or basic home office, once you get out of the norm, they won't carry it. </s>
<s> This is where I suggest you find commercial application laser that will be more expensive but they do the job. </s>
<s> I don;t know the final costs but going to local Staples, or Best Buy, etc., aren't always helpful for specifics at times. </s>
<s> You can check with a local business and see what they offer like business copy and printer sellers. </s>
<s> At least they have catalogs or sales people that could help. </s>
<s> Konica, Canon, Ricoh and Sharp are big suppliers for business, so don't be surprised no HP or Dell or common brands. </s>
<s> You can check out &quot;refurbed units&quot; to help reduce costs or commercial trade papers or online sources. </s>
<s> Also, I'm sure what you want should be in &quot;flat stock&quot; path printing too, heavy media doesn't bend well plus is a demanding media to print on. </s>
<s> Any cheap laser may print OK but movement of media maybe a problem over time. </s>
