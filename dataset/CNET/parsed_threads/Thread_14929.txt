<s> First, my computer had BSOD every time i start up my computer so i reset the cmos but after my computer didnt power up at all, no fan, no sound, nothing other then the green light on the mobo when everything is plugged in. </s>
<s> I try turning on the computer with another PSU that i had but still nothing. </s>
<s> Anyone has any idea what is wrong or what i can do? </s>
<s> Read from http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=THE+DEAD+PC but if the cmos clear jumper is in the wrong position many machines don't power up. </s>
<s> i reset the cmos by removing the battery and fittin it back in. </s>
<s> my pc is a standard Gateway 503GR, heres a link to the http://support.gateway.c specom/s/PC/R/3724/4365sp3.shtml </s>
<s> The battery if in wrong, dead or not making contact can cause a power up failure. </s>
<s> Thanks for the link but a story may help such as age, why the battery was pulled, etc. </s>

<s> the computer is about 4 years old. </s>
<s> the cmos battery was remove because i had blue screen of death whenever i power up my computer. </s>
<s> a friend told me by removin cmos battery i can reset the cmos and my computer would start up without the blue screen. </s>
<s> so i did follow his direction and then i try to start up, it didnt power up. </s>
<s> i put in a new cmos battery n still nothing and i tested the PSU and it works </s>
<s> Points to the motherboard type failures. </s>
<s> The power on button (did you test that button) the wires to the motherboard then the motherboard tell the PSU to power up. </s>
<s> There are just a few parts that involve the PSU powering up. </s>
<s> Since the CMOS battery was removed and replaced and the failure followed that, this is why I noted that. </s>
<s> As to the new battery, what Voltage is the Volt meter reading on that battery? </s>
<s> We want just over 3 Volts. </s>
<s> Sadly if that's good and typing THE DEAD PC at google finds nothing you can use then the motherboard id dead. </s>
<s> If any other cables were unplugged I was not told about that so I have no reason to tell you to test without the IDE cables plugged into the main board. </s>
