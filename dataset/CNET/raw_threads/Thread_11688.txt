He tried to resuscitate it and told me to pull out my card bus adaptor. When I pulled it out it was bent and it wrecked the cardbus slot. I sent it in to repair and they returned it (service denied)..when it came back it would power on ..before I sent it in it would not power on. But now it does not recognize the cd rom..I give up on the warranty people..How do I know if my cdrom can be replaced or this is a motherboard issue?

YOur first mistake was to follow this so-called tech's advice and pulling your own card bus adapter. Unless you put it in. Without knowing more, any guesses here are just that...educated guesses. Take it to a reputable tech and pay for the bench test. Then you have to decide how important that laptop really is. and life goes on... Jack
