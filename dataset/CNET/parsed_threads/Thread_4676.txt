<s> Hi, i have a Seagate 2TB external HDD.It was running fine.But recently it starting to generate some clicking sounds when data is accessed(also takes a few seconds sometimes to access data).Also when i turn of the PC its power is not down and i can still hear the sounds. </s>
<s> Please suggest the solution for this. </s>

<s> Since the exact model is not known I can't check if Seagate has a power down feature in this model. </s>
<s> Go to the seagate site and check. </s>
