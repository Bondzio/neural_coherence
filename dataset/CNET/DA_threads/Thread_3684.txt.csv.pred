1.1.1	I have been doing a littel upgrading on my 2nd (older) PC.	St
1.1.2	I still play some games on it.	St
1.1.3	Already added more memory and was thinking about upgrading the video card.	St
1.1.4	The motherboard only has a 4X AGP slot and most cards I'm interested in are 8X.	St
1.1.5	If I put in an 8X will I run into any problems?	St
1.2.1	It's a confusing area but if the card plugs in then it's ok. Bob	St
1.3.1	and it's not easy to buy a 8X-AGP card now	St
1.4.1	newegg.com and geeks.com But I still prefer cards from this list -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/12/03/best_graphics_card/ Keep in mind the repeating issue I see is not AGP motherboard issues but the weakling power supplies.	St

1.5.1	Thanks everyone!	St
1.5.2	I had the power supply take a crap a while back.	St
1.5.3	I replaced it with a 450w one.	St
1.5.4	As far as AGP cards.	St
1.5.5	I have found them all over the place.	St
1.5.6	As long as an 8x cards works in a 4x slot I'm good.	St
1.6.1	The market could not support such a card so we never found one.	St
