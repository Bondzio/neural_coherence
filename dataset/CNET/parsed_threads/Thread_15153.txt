<s> hi, i recently bought a 2TB external drive(Seagate).everthing is fine except a small issue.when i access the hard drive or using any files on it,it is ok.if it is left idle for some time (say 5-10mins) or no files on the drive are being used the hard drive turns off.And few secs later turns on and i get the autoplay options.Is there any way to get over this? </s>
<s> First check your windows power settings in control panel, that could be the issue. </s>
<s> If not it may be a setting in the external drive software, sounds like one or the other. </s>
<s> But if I read page 9 of http://www.seagate.com/staticfiles/support/freeagent/fa_win_ug_en.pdf it looks like you can change it. </s>
