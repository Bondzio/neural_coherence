i would like to warn others about the use of special operating systems on their pcs.
i purchased an hp media center pc back in late 2004, without realizing that it requires a special operating system customized by microsoft specifically for hp.
recently, i went to download the new windows media player from microsoft only to be warned that my current 2004 operating system did not support it.
i enquired about this with hp to be told that they only offered an upgrade to the new operating system to ''selected'' customers and that it was no longer available.
this upgrade was only offered through the hp website and they did not pro-actively contact all of their customers to inform them about this.
after i complained about this to hp, their response was effectively that i would have to purchase a new computer if i wanted to get the new operating system.
so here i am stuck with an older operating system and no upgrade available.
i would like to pass this warning on to everyone.
be very careful when purchasing computers from hp that have specialized operating systems, because the windows ugrades that are available from microsoft may not be available to you from hp, potentially leaving you with a computer that does not support the latest windows software/hardware.
i most certainly will avoid the hp brand for all future purchases.
