1.1.1	I have the following cables on my case , I need to know where each one goes specifically on the 8VM533M-RZ /8VM533M-RZ-C : HPOUT-R HPOUT R +P LED -P LED +HDD Led -HDD Led Power SW Mic In Mic Power Mic Grd VCC- USB1- USB1+ GND GND VCC USB2- USB2+ GND I have posted the same message on Giga-Bytes Technical Zone and got the Answer & quot ; Use the Manual for for the Front Panel USB and Power & quot ; This was as helpful as Mud in a Washing Machine .	St
1.1.2	Thank you for your quick response Mark E. Burkhardt , MCP CIO , Trans-Atlantic Creations www.transatlanticcreations.com	St
1.2.1	What does www.transatlanticcreations.com have to do with wiring your board ?	Ques
1.2.2	I take it that you are just trying to post your link rather than look for help .	St
1.2.3	This is a form of spam on the boards we do n't appreciate .	St
1.2.4	As to wiring , they are right .	St
1.2.5	You read the manual to find out where to put the Power Sw , then you do the same for each connection .	St
1.2.6	It may seem like there is a better answer but thousands have wired it with just that information .	St
1.2.7	Bob	St
1.3.1	Excuse me , if you are the CIO of a tech company and can not read a tech manual .	St
1.3.2	IMO -- YOU SHOULD BE FIRED ! ! ! ! ! !	St
1.3.3	!	St
1.4.1	I just downloaded a copy .	St
1.4.2	The connections for the LEDs and power are shown clearly on page 15 .	St
1.4.3	Typically the USB connections are as shown on page 16 .	St
1.4.4	Each port is in the row ow pins on one side of the & quot ; connector & quot ; .	St
1.4.5	They go VCC then some letter followed by a minus , then the same letter followed by a plus and then the gnd .	Sug
1.4.6	What letters they use can vary , just be sure that the minus and the plus in the row use the same letter or letters .	St
1.4.7	Note that there are four pins in one row and five pins in the other .	St
1.4.8	The fifth pin is for the ground for the overall shield of the cable .	St
1.4.9	There are some instances where connecting this ground can cause things to not work .	St
1.4.10	On my Soyo mobo I had to cut that wire off the cable .	St
1.4.11	The connections for the audio are shown clearly on page 16 , they are the mic , the HPOUT minus R and R. R = right minus is the return nominus sign is the & quot ; hot & quot ; even though audio is AC thus no real hot lead , just a signal and its return .	St
1.4.12	[ Takes two wires to tango in electricity ] .	St
1.4.13	It is not unusual for systems to use a common return for audio stereo lines .	St
1.4.14	[ often shown as ground ] rather than a minus L [ left ] and a minus R [ right ] .	St
1.4.15	The case mfr has no idea what mobo you will use thus it takes a little interpretation of the terminology that each uses..	St
1.4.16	I agree with Robert with that title you have you asking such a simple question makes one wonder if I would use your company .	St
1.4.17	Seems best to leave it off .	St
1.5.1	I have a copy of the Manual and have studied and memorized it ; however , I have found that most cases have cables that are labled completely different than what is on the Motherboard .	St
1.5.2	That is what is confusing about the question that I had asked .	St
1.6.1	the various possible names/terms for things it can be confusing .	St
1.6.2	We tend to think that everyone knows that the audio will have a mic , have a left and right channel and each channel may have an independent return or a common return .	St
1.6.3	The common return can be called gnd [ ground ] .	St
1.6.4	There can be many gnd 's , but for audio use the gnd in the audio bundle of wires , not just any gnd .	St
1.6.5	The USB has been confusing , however the 10 pin two & quot ; connector & quot ; [ one pin omitted has become standard ] .	St
1.6.6	That supports two USB channels one channel along each one of the rows .	St
1.6.7	First pin in each row is VCC [ voltage ] , then the - [ minus ] , then the + [ plus ] , then the gnd .	St
1.6.8	The confusing thing is that the plus and the minus pins may have one two or three leeters/characters or anything else that suits their fancy .	St
1.6.9	The key is to be certain that in a given row the plus and the minus both have the same combination of characters .	St
1.6.10	Do n't waste time trying to figure what the letters stand for .	St
1.6.11	The mic connections can be a little confusing because there are different types of microphoness and some do not need the mic power connection .	St
1.6.12	The LEDs require being connected with the correct polarity , however if you connect them in reverse it wo n't damage them so just reverse the leads if the LED does n't light when it should .	St
1.6.13	The Power switch and reset switch are NOT polarity dependent .	St
1.6.14	Let us know if you get it all working properly .	St
1.7.1	If you combine the info in motherboard manual with the case manual , you usually can figure everything out by process of elimination .	St
1.7.2	I find the following tutorials helpful : Audio : http : //www.pctechguide.com/tutorials/MBoard_Audio.htm USB : http : //www.pctechguide.com/tutorials/MBoard_USB.htm Front panel : http : //www.pctechguide.com/tutorials/MBoard_Panel.htm Click the links at the bottom of that linked webpage for info on other motherboard connections .	St
1.8.1	You memorized a motherboard manual ? !	Ques
1.8.2	Eeeeuuuww !	St
1.8.3	I prefer to memorize general concepts .	St
1.8.4	More transferrable .	St
1.8.5	Where do you put the rest of the useless details you get during the day ?	Ques
1.8.6	Different strokes ... I guess .	St
