<s> I have a MSI 6378 w/AMD Athlon XP 1900 & a HP 834G Pavilion running ME. </s>
<s> The AMD is running XP. </s>
<s> AMD is the master and HP the client. </s>
<s> They are connected through a crossover cable using TCPIP Protocol. </s>
<s> Now the problem sometime this setup works like charm and other times there is no internet connection for the HP and any combinations in between. </s>
<s> MSN Messenger on the HP is always online. </s>
<s> Also in Network Neighborhood she can always access my shared Documents & printer. </s>
<s> If I cut my farewall off sometimes she can connect and sometinesnot and art times she connects when My firewall is on. </s>
<s> I have on MY AMD CA e-Trust EZ Armor and she is running the same only last year's. </s>
<s> No help from CA. </s>
