i wonder if you forgot some bios or flash update, the motherboard drivers (some try what's on the cd and that's buggy or out of date.)
with such slim details all i can say is to call the maker and ask what they want to be exchanged.
another nutty thing is overclocking.
imagine the poor soul that tries that.
