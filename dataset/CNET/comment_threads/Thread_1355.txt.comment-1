Recently I put a desktop tower together.
I have a bit of experience adding hardware, downloading software, and some other basic things with a computer.
This is my first time doing it from scratch.
So my problem is my monitor is noticing the graphics card but there is nothing being projected.
I have taken all of the excess hardware out, and have done it piece by piece, still nothing on the monitor.
I took the graphics card and put it in my 5 year old computer and it starts up without a problem.
Now I've ran out of ideas.
Motherboard: GIGABYTE GA-990FXA-UD3 Graphics Card: GIGABYTE GV-R645D3-512I Processor: Athlon II X4 640 Ram(DDR3-1866): G.SKILL F3-1866C10D-16GAB Hard Drive: Seagate STBD2000101 Power Source: Raidmax RX-500AF Side notes - I haven't done anything with the BIOS yet because the computer does not have an on-board video.
