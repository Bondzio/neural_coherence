Hard Drives With Stranded Files On Them: Western Digital 20gb FAT 32 Samsung 80gb NTFS (slightly more complicated than FAT 32) Maxtor 120gb HFS+ All three of them are intended for internal hardware for desktops. Ultra PATA. Not sure where to stick the Jumpers...Will any setting be okay?? These are also Platter hard drives. They spin, have moving parts, are noisy, consume more energy, and aren't as durable... compared to Solid State Hard Drives. I like to use Solid State external storage, even if it is a USB device. I haven't purchased many of these yet. I want a not-very-stressful way to get the files off of the 3 internal desktop hard drives and onto Solid State portable external storage devices. I am guessing that Enclosure devices with a USB &/Or Fire Wire connections would work with these hard drives. And perhaps &quot;Toasters&quot;. Do you recommend them?? Working Computers that the enclosure(s) &/or toaster(s) would be plugged into: Power Mac Blue & White 350mhz with 9.2.2 6 usbs and 2 fire wires. iMac from 1999 500mhz 10.3.5 with 2 usbs and 2 fire wires. iMac from 1997 350mhz with 10.3.5 and 9.2.2 (but am using 9.2.2 on it) with just 2 usbs. Which external storage devices do you recommend, how did you find them, and are enclosures okay and also are Toasters okay??
