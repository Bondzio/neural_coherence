Here's what I've always done regardless of the problem on HPs and others.
You need to clean the ink carts &quot;contacts&quot; as well as the carriage contact nibs with a damp clean cloth and then dry wipe.
Re-install them and then check results.
Sometimes the &quot;timing fence&quot; the thin plastic strip that runs untouched through carraige, it has black tick marks all along its length.
Use the clean damp cloth to wipe down, left to right, repeat as necessary and use gentle/deft care while doing this, just clean it up abit, (use no solvent!!!)
just water or alcohol.
Try that and check results.
If it still fails, then use a *NEW* ink cart usually resolves 30-40% of problems doing that alone.
good luck -----Willy
