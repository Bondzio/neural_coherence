Nice post,Dan.
See, I would use an iPad-like device BECAUSE of the &quot;Fun Factor&quot;.
I do my &quot;serious&quot; work on my 17&quot; laptop.
Only reason I'm not buying an iPad is I don't have any Apple products and don't want to convert from Sony and Microsoft, which is what I've got a boatload of items invested in.
But, I love your positive post.
Thank you.
