hi all.
i just purchased a new sata 500gb drive that my computer will not recognize.
i already have a 200gb ide drive.
i set the bios on-chip configuration to sata and the boot sequence sees the new drive but when i get into windows the drive is not there.
under device management i see the ide, cd and dvd drives but not the new drive.
there are two sata on-board connections and i have tried them both.
the drive spins up and seems to work.
i took it back to where i purchased it and they say it's fine.
my only other option is to get one of those pci, sata to ide adapter cards.
i am running windows xp on a msi motherboard 1.6ghz amd processor.
any thoughts?
thanks, mark
