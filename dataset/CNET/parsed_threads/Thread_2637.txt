<s> I plan on installing new memory into my Dell Dimension L866r. </s>
<s> Right now I have a 64 MB DIMM card installed which came from the factory. </s>
<s> When installing memory, do I need to remove the old card and replace it with the new, or will I be able to combine the MB of the 2 separate DIMM cards when sat in different seatings? </s>
<s> I would recommend, for the sake of ensuring compatibility, to get rid of old RAM and populate with identical modules. </s>
<s> A good source is found at the web site of Crucial which allows you to plug in your PC by make and model. </s>
<s> You can find what you need and order it right there. </s>
<s> They guarantee compatibility. </s>
<s> I have used them many times with many PCs and never needed to return a module. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
