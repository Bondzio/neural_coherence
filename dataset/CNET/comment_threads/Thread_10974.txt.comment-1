Grandson's comp (compaq presario) had recently had hard drive cleaned and we are in process of re-installing hardware...but, the 2 dvd drivers are not found on system and can't find the back-up discs done when comp was purchased (lost in move I guess) How do we find these drivers to install them??????
Thank you all in advance!
