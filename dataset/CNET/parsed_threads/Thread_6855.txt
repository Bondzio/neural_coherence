<s> I am not sure what we call it other than the metal support bracket on a card for the computer but I need to find a place where I can get replacement brackets for a card. </s>
<s> I am installing a linksys card in a computer and the card fits great but that bracket sticks about 2 inches above the back of the tower.... </s>
<s> It is one of those modular towers from gateway that really sucks.....I can remove the bracket but then the card is not very secure and when I connect the Cat 5e to it the card moves a little. </s>
<s> So back to.... Is there a place I can get another bracket for the card.....???? </s>
<s> Thanks so much Brett </s>
