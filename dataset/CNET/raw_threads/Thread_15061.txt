Specs: ATI 4870hd Intel e6750 2.66Ghz 4mb cashe G.Skill 8g's ram western digital hd's asus p5k-se 600w powersupply I have about 250 dollars to spend right now and I was really looking to upgrade my e6750 because it might be bottlenecking my graphics card. What im having problems with is what to do with that money. From what I know most games dont have quad-core support but with technology idk how long that will last. So my question is what should I do with that money?? Stick with a good dual core like a e8500 or go to a quad core. (Im going to have to stick to my LGA 775 socket)

That way you would have a high performance peripheral to carry forward to a new system when the time arises...there's not much gain or future in getting another socket 775. VAPCMD

Ive had many nvidea card and they all functioned perfectly for me. The 4870 was my first ATI and its just missing something that I like from nvidea. Ive been looking at the gtx 200 series but I really dont know what the prices will look like in a few months with the 300 series coming out

Another thought . . . skip the L775 CPU and use the $$ for a socket 1366 or 1156 MB which gives you a platform for more CPU power and the option to use Crossfire or SLi plus USB 3.0 and SATA 3.
