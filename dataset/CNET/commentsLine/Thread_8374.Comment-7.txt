did you have the device unplugged on the next boot?
i've lost count of it failing and then i delete/remove it in safe mode, then install the drivers on the next boot then finally plug it in.
however your post seems to omit the motherboard driver install.
not much has changed with windows installs over the years.
seems a shame msft never corrected this.
