I have the exact same model of monitor and am experiencing the exact same problem.
It only stays on for 2 seconds, goes black, and I must press the power button 4x to get it back on for 2 seconds before it goes blank again.
I called Mag for support, and they said that my monitor was not under warrenty since it was 14 months old.
To get it fixed, it would cost $100 plus shipping.
I'm looking for a monitor from another company with a better support.
Never again.
Sounds like it's a known problem, and they should have been able to provide a fix.
