<s> Hey folks, I have a question, is there any way to use another kind of ram in my computer? </s>
<s> It came RDRAM, which runs great and fast, but I need more RAM, and frankly, RDRAM, from what I've seen, will cost a very pretty penny! </s>
<s> Infact, I've seen 128MB for somewhere around the $200.00 mark. </s>
<s> What can I do? </s>
<s> does your system have ? </s>
<s> What make/mfg is your PC ?? </s>
<s> If not sure ...might try running CPUZ...it'll tell you about the RAM and the MB VAPCMD </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> As for speed, this I know: Pentium 4 1.80 Ghz 2. </s>
<s> I'm not sure what speed the actual RAM is, you mentioned &quot;CPUZ&quot; could yo explain? </s>
<s> Thanks a lot for your help. </s>
<s> all about your CPU and your existing RAM. </s>
<s> Post the results here. </s>
<s> There are different RDRAM speeds...PC600, PC800 and PC1066. </s>
<s> May be a PC700 too..just can't remember. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> kind of RAM on that system. </s>
<s> I just upgraded my brothers Dell 8200 and had to get 2 of these. </s>

<s> it was 2 of these. </s>
<s> But he has the money to spend. </s>

<s> putting the $$ towards a new PC. </s>
<s> Ugh. </s>
<s> Frequency 398.7 MHz Channel# Dual PC800-45 (400 MHz FSB: DRAM 1:1 Row to Column: 9 clocks </s>
<s> Plainly put RDRAM was always expensive from the start. </s>
<s> It didn't catch on as vendors hoped and it lost favor. </s>
<s> Now, any RDRAM being produced is in such low production it is further expensive due to limited supplies. </s>
<s> On top of all that, you have to buy in pairs in order to maintain the &quot;continuity&quot; of the ram buss. </s>
<s> All in all darn hard to like RDRAM other than being slightly faster than older other ram types and so has been eclipsed. </s>
<s> Get what you can afford but for the long haul, it maybe best to find another system for the amount of cost put into a RDRAM based system can be instead placed into a newer system. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> so much for your help, it is greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> Again, thank you all, Jay (IknowWHOiAM) </s>
