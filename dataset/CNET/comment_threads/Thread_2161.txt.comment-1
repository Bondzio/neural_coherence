Hi built a new system but things are a bit touch and go.
The whole computer cuts out when i try to play gtlegends or after playing Call of Duty 2 for a while.
And i guess it will be the same for any other resource heavy program.
I bought a 600w PSU for a bit more than 15 and i take it that means its that not being able to hold a stable enough voltage or something like that?
Thanjs for any help, i'd really like to sort this out.
