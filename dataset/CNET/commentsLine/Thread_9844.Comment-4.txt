here i did nothing.
or very little.
i did exactly what this forum asked.
lastest firmware, router defaults, and wpa-psk for wifi security and a simple broadcasting ssid.
your post sounds like you are trying many interesting things.
i'm glad my 2000 just works with the 360 without touching any setting.
