1.1.1	Hello , I would like to ask what shall I choose for the moment between a new Core2Duo e6300 and a Leadtek 8800Gts to gain more performance for the newer games .	St
1.1.2	Right now my PC specs are : Asus P5ND2 SLI Intel Edition , Leadtek nVidia 7900GS , Creative Audigy 4 , P4 630 3Ghz , WD 120GB SATA , 2GB DDR2 800Mhz Corsair , Seasonic S12 430W .	St
1.1.3	5 Months from now I will have both hardware pieces but right now I have to stick with the one that my PC really needs so I could play the newer games ( GRAW2 , MOHA Airborne , STALKER ) at HIGH details and 1280x1024 resolution ( not with 2AA active ) .	St
1.1.4	My 7900GS is overclocked at 550mhz ( GPU ) & 1600mhz ( mem ) .	St
1.1.5	If the answer is the CPU is needed the most right now , I would like to know if a e6300 or a e4300 is better .	St
1.1.6	Thank you .	St
1.2.1	there 's a huge amount of confusion over that mobo series and its support for pentium-d and core2duo .	St
1.2.2	according to asus ' website : & quot ; p5nd2 & quot ; supports core2duo but requires pcb revision 2.00G & quot ; p5nd2 se & quot ; supports core2duo & quot ; p5nd2-sli & quot ; does not show core2duo as being supported & quot ; p5nd2-sli deluxe & quot ; does not show core2duo as being supported http : //support.asus.com/cpusupport/cpusupport.aspx	St
1.3.1	I know that my motherboard does not support Core2Duo and that 's why I will buy a P5b Asus .	St
1.3.2	But this is not the issue .	St
1.3.3	I just want to know if it 's better to buy the graphic card first or to upgrade the CPU ( and the mobo ) to gain better performance for the games that will come out 5 months from now , because after 5 months I will have both of them .	St
1.3.4	I 'm afraid that if I 'll buy the graphic card it will be slowed down by my current CPU , or if I 'll buy the CPU , i wont ' get enough performance compared to buying a 8800gts .	St
1.3.5	I really do n't know and this is just for the next 5 months as I said .	St
1.3.6	And I would also like to know if a Leadtek 8800gts ( 640mb ) will be enough for Crysis ( on high details and 1280x1024 ) , and of course with an Core2Duo e4300 ( OC at 2,6Ghz ) and 2Gb DDR2 at 800Mhz .	St
1.4.1	unless you have a game *now* that you ca n't play *now* , you 'll be better off doing your upgrade in a few months .	St
1.4.2	intel will be refreshing the core2duo line , ati 's dx10 gpus will be out , and nvidia will fill out its 8xxxx series .	St
1.4.3	for the money you 've got budgeted , you 'll probably be able to get a 8800gtx class gpu and a e6600 class cpu if you wait 3-4 months .	St
1.4.4	your 7900gs is a very good card for 1280x1024 .	St
1.4.5	other cards may give higher frame rates , but the 7900gs will still make most games highly playable .	St
1.4.6	so if have to spend money now , i suggest you get the core2duo .	St
1.4.7	wait for crysis to be released and benchmarked before you upgrade your video card .	Sug
1.5.1	I just got this card a week ago , and let me tell you that it is PHENOMINAL .	St
1.5.2	I can crank all the settings ALL the way up on Oblivion , Company of Heroes and Supreme Commander , and I dont have a problem with any .	St
1.5.3	However , I DO have the e6600 2.4Ghz .	St
1.5.4	Here 's what I did .	St
1.5.5	Asus P5N SLI mobo may not be the best one out there , but it supports up to 16GB of RAM , intel 's 775 socket processors ( including quad core ) and of course , its SLI capable .	St
1.5.6	And its fanless , so its quiet .	St
1.5.7	Plus , its only about $ 105 , which is cheap for a mobo .	St
1.5.8	Granted , between all three of those , it cost me about $ 784 , but heres how I see it .	St
1.5.9	the e6600 will be good for a while , and the gfx card will laugh at games for a while to come .	St
1.5.10	In the Future , when I need to turn the settings down to increase my frame rates , I can always get another 8800 ( which will have dropped in price by then ) as well as upgrade to a quad core .	St
1.6.1	Indeed , it seems that I have to wait a while and see how the new games like Stalker , Graw2 will run on my PC .	St
1.6.2	If it 's needed more , I 'll get a e6400 and then a 8800gts Thanx everybody for your opinions .	St
