i don't really know how it got set that way, i couldn't even find how to change it directly in bios - ended up changing general settings to low-safe (can't remember what it called it).
this changed it to 1333, haven't had a chance to see if it did any good.
did notice that a hardware monitor program showed something in red zone heat right after re-booting (after one of these crashes), unfortunately i'm not sure exactly what it's telling me is the particular heat problem... it lists mainboard (ok), cpu (ok), temp 3 (which has no sensor), and cpu0 core (which is where the red showed up).
why it shows cpu ok, and cpu0 core as a problem, i don't know what it's listing as this cpu0 core that i need to address....
