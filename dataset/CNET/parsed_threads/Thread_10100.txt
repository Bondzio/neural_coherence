<s> I would like to upgrade my system by adding a pci-e card and a tuner. </s>
<s> Is there a sub $200 card that has good specs for games as well as video. </s>
<s> I will upgrade mu psu if need be. </s>
<s> Any advice would be appreciated. </s>
<s> is by far the best budget gpu on the market. </s>
<s> you will, although there are people here that didn't, upgrade your psu. </s>
<s> it will make sure your system has all the power you need because the 6600GT requires at least 350w and your emachine has 300w. </s>
<s> look at antec, ozc, and enermax and in the range of 400w+. </s>
<s> you would have to purchase the tv tuner separately, and i am not fond on those, so maybe someone else can help you. </s>
<s> enjoy your new gpu, and your huge monitor! </s>
