1.1.1	Okay so I had a ~6.5 year old LCD monitor die on me today and need to get a replacement .	St
1.1.2	My PC is as old as the broken monitor and I want to make sure the newer monitors out there are compatible with my display adapter card .	St
1.1.3	I am interested in a Widescreen monitor , but when I open up the display settings for my PC the only choices I have are 800x600 and 1280x1024 since my broken monitor was in the 4:3 aspect ratio .	St
1.1.4	My videocard is old ... a nVidia 64MB GeForce 2 MMX or something like that .	St
1.1.5	Would I be okay getting a widescreen monitor or do I have to stick with the 4:3 ones ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	When the video card detects the new monitor it should give you more resolution options .	St
1.2.2	If not you can probably get updated drivers for the card .	St
