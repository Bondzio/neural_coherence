<s> While trying to set up a home network with the XP networking wizard, I get a TCP/IP error that dissconnects my DSL. </s>
<s> What do I do ? </s>
<s> Thanks Duckman </s>
<s> What is the error message? </s>
<s> I do not use the wizard as the only steps needed in an XP home P2P LAN are the same workgroup names and setting folders to share. </s>
