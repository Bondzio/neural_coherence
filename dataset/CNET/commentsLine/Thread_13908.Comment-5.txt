calling the tech guys is probably best...if i get some good hard facts on which symptoms indicate which purchase required, i'll get back.
i've already seen the toners on ebay at $40 bucks, and the drum assembly at $70 bucks, so neither is a deal breaker.
their owners manual offers really nothing on 'maintenance'; written by the lawyers, of course.
