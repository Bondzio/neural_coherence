<s> I have an HP Pavillion 7940 PC. </s>
<s> I've had ups and downs with this thing but has worked ok...Since a move I made, the CD Rom will not read any disc I put in. </s>
<s> Any ideas on what a non tech person can do without spending alot of money? </s>
<s> Also, can anyone tell me what a Kernel32 is? </s>
<s> Have been getting an error message with that! </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> With a new CDRW spotted at Office Max for $9.99 or even $19.99 at Best Buy, I have to ask if this is a lot of money for a CDRW drive? </s>
<s> You can try a CD Lens Cleaner ($14.95 at your regular music store) and there are some issues if it the drive letter has vanished, but you didn't write that. </s>
<s> After a few years, if the drive letter is still there, you try a CD Lens Cleaner, but that costs more than that CDRW drive! </s>
