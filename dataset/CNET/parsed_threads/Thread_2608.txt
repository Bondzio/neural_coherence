<s> Hello, I am a person who is responsible for system administration in medium size broker's company (approx. </s>
<s> 80 employees) We have a lot of workers and visitors with Wi-Fi notebooks who want to surf internet it all over the campus. </s>
<s> Currently we have something like a dozen of Access Points (several conference rooms, trading room, lobby etc.) </s>
<s> that were configured separately. </s>
<s> We have separate network for those APs because I'm afraid of intruders equipped with wi-fi sniffers who can penetrate into our LAN. </s>
<s> One more thing that make life difficult is the fact we had to configure WEP with the same key-phrase so users can surf via any one of our AP's. </s>
<s> What I'd like to know - is there some kind of simple software that can help me to manage the wireless network easily, including managing access for limited time visitors. </s>
<s> Also I'd like to know who is currently connected, how many users surf via wireless etc. </s>
<s> The program must be simple to install and use, since this is only a part of my duties and I don't want to waste my time dealing with over-sophisticated network management tools (that cost tons of money). </s>
<s> Thanks, Evgenek Klein, MNGD </s>
<s> To get there, you'll have to replace all the current WAPs for ones that work with software that does this. </s>
<s> Cisco has this feature. </s>
<s> But my bet is that you may not be willing to pay for this. </s>
