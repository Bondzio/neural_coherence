When I plug in the memory card reader it installs as drive F, but when I click it, I get the &quot;Please insert a disk into drive F&quot; message. Obviously the memory card is in the reader so I have no clue why it isn't being read. The card works fine in the camera, I can view the pics and vids I am trying to transfer. I have also tried plugging the reader and card into two desktops, a Dell running Vista and an HP running XP. Oh and the reader also shows that the memory card has been inserted by lighting up green, so I don't know that it is the reader's problem (I don't really know what the problem is, that's why I'm here). The reader is a Dynex DX-CR501. Of all the problems I have had with computers or electronics this is by far the most frustrating! I seriously want to punt a cat that's how frustrated I am. Any help is greatly appreciated...

However large *.pst files are apparently lost. I intend to return the card to Sandisk with an explanitory note (their support line simply advised me to invest in a recovery tool - that can't work because the drive only exists for those few seconds - and I think that as there is a possibility that the fault is a physical defect they should at least attempt to fix/recover the data. Sage advice to back up these things regularly - my last was early Feb and between that and the recovery of those smaller files it is not a complete disaster this time - but still loss of e-mails may matter later on. Let me know if you have managed to resolve and I'll post the outcome of my efforts later. PS - on one forum a suggestion to read the card on a linux system as most virus are designed to interfere with windows - that might hold water with your &quot;The card works fine in the camera&quot; statement.

I agree though backing up is a necessity now considering companies who make memory storage use that as an excuse for their products to fail and not have any responsibility (I had to spend $250 to have Best Buy recover files off of a external HD.)
