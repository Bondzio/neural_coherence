I have two desktops that are being readied for use in my shop. Both have Win 7 64 bit, one Professional and one Home premium. When I wanted to download a file to install on each of them, a 350Mb file, one desktop took over an hour and a half to do so, where the other desktop came in at about 8 minutes. Same LAN, Realtek RTL8111D on both boards, although different manufacturers. One Gigabyte board, one MSI board. Any ideas what might have caused this? Perhaps a bad driver??

I use a KVM to hook up the new builds for my customers, and was updating Adobe software. At first I thought it was just the server, but the second PC D/L the software through the same router/modem setup as the first PC, only at light speed.
