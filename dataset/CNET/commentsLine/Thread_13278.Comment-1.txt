i have a 4x agp-compatible mobo.
i am looking to get a 128 mb vid card, and i am thinking that it would probably make sense to get an 8x agp card.
i would assume they are backwards compatible to a 4x mobo without any major issues?
i would rather not update the mobo at this time if i can help it, but i also don't want to limit myself for the future by getting a 4x agp card.
i was looking at probably the radeon 9600 or 9800, although the 9200 is a possibility too.
i don't know much about nvidias, but i would be open to looking at them too.
the biggest thing is that it needs to be dx 9.0 compatible.
