thanks for the help----i will be looking for an ap to boost the signal throughout my house.
i just streamed netflix movie tron 2 through my laptop which was connected to my sammy tv joining the two with a hdmi cable.
got full hd and surround sound x 5 speakers with no glitches.
gotta love those klipsh speakers.
now if i can get dish or netflix to supply 3d format!!!!!!
ours is not to question why---ours is to do or die.
pretty easy fix.
a bluejean company 8 foot hdmi cable and viola, eureka, huzza, and cheers.
