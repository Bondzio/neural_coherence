<s> I decided (from some reason) to upgrade my Firmware on my Light-ON DVDRW SHM-165H6S. </s>
<s> I went to Light-On's site and found the only Firmware version there. </s>
<s> Downloaded and installed just fine. </s>
<s> No problems at all. </s>
<s> It told me to re-boot so I did. </s>
<s> Now after I reboot Windows XP Pro says it found new hardware (the Light-On Drive that has been installed for over a year). </s>
<s> I tried both options (To let Windows Find the driver, or me specify the location). </s>
<s> Both ways Windows Doesn't find any Driver. </s>
<s> If I try to select a driver I get &quot;DVD/CD-ROM Drive Filter&quot; It says this Driver is not digitally signed. </s>
<s> I still try to install it. </s>
<s> (after a couple of warnings that Windows can't verify the driver) Then it asks for PxHelp20.sys file. </s>
<s> I find it in my Windows/System32/Drivers directory and install. </s>
<s> Then it finish and says &quot;There was a problem installing this hardware.&quot; I end up doing the same thing again next time I reboot? </s>
<s> Any idea what I need to do? </s>
<s> My only worry is that I plan to re-install windows here in about two weeks. </s>
<s> And I need this drive to work? </s>
<s> My computer is a Asus P800-Deluxe P4 1gb of RAM? </s>
<s> Driver or use a system restore for the same. </s>
<s> Why update the driver if the old one works OK?. </s>
<s> Whenever the firmware on a DVD drive is updated, the OS will call it &quot;New Hardware&quot; when you reboot. </s>
<s> There should be no different drivers needed just because of a firmware update. </s>
<s> There should be no different drivers needed just because of a firmware update. </s>
<s> ------------- Perhaps that's true for a dvd?? </s>
<s> What I've seen with other hardware is the firmware update seems to change the device type/ID. </s>
<s> When windows goes looking for a driver to match the type/ID there is no match. </s>
<s> Now it's back to the maker's site to find a driver that supports the new firmware. </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;&gt;Why update the driver if the old one works OK?. </s>
<s> Usually to help boost performance some, and so forth. </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There should be no different drivers needed just because of a firmware update. </s>
<s> I agree that is what so surprising. </s>
<s> Also I have another (older) DVD burner that works just fine, no driver problems. </s>
<s> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Now it's back to the maker's site to find a driver that supports the new firmware. </s>
<s> The site doesnt have any drivers for its CD/DVD Drives. </s>
<s> As far as I have seen, they want us to use the Windows XP Driver. </s>
<s> I dont know if I have some newer driver that Windows Thinks it should install or what? </s>
<s> I cant find the right *.INF file to get this to install properly. </s>
<s> If you can, reinstall your old driver. </s>
<s> Afterwards, make sure all is working OK. Then reinstall the new driver. </s>
<s> DO NOT REBOOT! </s>
<s> Shut off the computer and unplug it. </s>
<s> Wait for about 15 seconds for the 5 volts to bleed down; plud it back in and boot as normal. </s>
<s> Hope it helps! </s>
<s> Did you mean Driver or Firmware? </s>
<s> I never changed the driver, just for some reason Windows XP can't seem to find the correct driver. </s>
<s> For Firmwware, I actually wish I could go back to an old version but there aren't any listed on Light-ON's site. </s>
<s> Only the version I currently have. </s>
<s> I did find one on a different site (I don't know how old it was) but when I tried to install it, it already knew I had the latest version? </s>
<s> They are talking about the problem you have here: http://www.file.net/process/pxhelp20.sys.html Also as you read down the list, there is a post that says go here: http://www.theeldergeek.com/restore_missing_cd_or_dvd_drive.htm Give it a try to see if that will fix the problem. </s>
