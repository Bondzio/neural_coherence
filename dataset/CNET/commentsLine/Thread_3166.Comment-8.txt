yes they do and it is usually in 1000's to 10,000's of hours, of operation.
however that is just a guideline, and your drive can die before then.
so there is no set and rigid time of life for a drive.
you just have to hope your drive will last to the expected time is used up.
there are smartdrive utilities that can query the function that is built-in to most drives software nowdays and it will give you a report(abet cryptic) that shows how much time you drive has been on, and if it has had any errors during its life that you can check.
which will give you a warning before you start having problem with it 'usually'.
