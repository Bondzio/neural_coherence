recently i bought a new wd hard drive, the one with the sas interface and it never disappointed.
the wd s25 delivers ultra-high performance with its 3 gb/s and 6 gb/s sas interfaces and a sustained sequential data rate of 128 mb/sec.
in addition to all the speed required to service any enterprise need, the wd s25 also provides a 1.6 m hour mtbf rating.
i must say i'm impressed.
