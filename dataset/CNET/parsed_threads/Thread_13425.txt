<s> I have an iMac G5, 17&quot; /w OS X 10.3.8, 1.8 GHz Super Drive, 512MB, ...purchased in 05 and Apple replaced the hard drive and Logic something a few months later and now it is a 10.3.9 and still a &quot;lemon&quot;.Always slow and get the dreaded rainbow wheel a lot. </s>
<s> Now, I am unable to boot to desktop(again) but I do not want to erase my pictures and videos in order to do a restart/recovery as had done before.. How do I retrieve my info if the computer will not boot? </s>
<s> If I remove the hard drive, can I take it somewhere to retrieve the pictures? </s>
<s> I just purchased a &quot;My Book&quot; external Hard Drive and did not get to use it because of my OS X problem. </s>
<s> I have an E-machine with windows XP, and a HP with windows 2000, but they won't be of any help? </s>
<s> I also tried everything suggested in &quot;the Missing Manual&quot;. </s>
<s> I had this problem before and Apple had us erase all of our stuff. </s>
<s> It was okay then because I did not have my pictures and videos. </s>
<s> I also have a lot of music I would like to keep. </s>
<s> The pictures are the most important. </s>
<s> No backup of any kind was done because we had just recently added the pictures and videos. </s>
<s> Thanks, Sue PS:I still consider myself a computer newbie especially with the Mac. </s>

<s> The first thing to find out is whether or not the iMac will start up from the Restore CD/DVD You were not very specific about what happens when you attempt to start the iMac. </s>
<s> Does it chime? </s>
<s> Does the screen light up? </s>
<s> Do you see the Grey Apple and spinning spokes? </s>
<s> A folder icon with a question mark? </s>
<s> Does any happen at all? </s>
<s> If the iMac starts from the Recovery CD/DVD, it is a good indication that most of the internal stuff is working as designed. </s>
<s> The next thing is to find out if the Hard Drive is still functioning. </s>
<s> If it is, then you have a good chance of recovering all your data. </s>
<s> If it is not, then I'm afraid your data will only be recoverable using a professional data recovery service. </s>
<s> If the iMac booted from the CD/DVD, use the Disk Utility from the Menu Bar and see if it recognizes the Hard Drive. </s>
<s> If it does, run First Aid on it to see if it is damaged in any way. </s>
<s> If it appears OK, quit Disk Utility. </s>
<s> Start the install process BUT choose ARCHIVE and INSTALL as the installation method. </s>
<s> Choose ONLY the Archive and Install option. </s>
<s> You will find it under Options at the first or second screen of the installer. </s>
<s> This will lay down a new System folder, but will preserve all your data. </s>
<s> Once the recovery is complete, and the machine restarts, all your data will be where you left it. </s>
<s> Now make the backup of all your data! </s>
<s> I will not beat the drum about regular backups, I guess you have already become a convert to that regime. </s>
<s> Daily backups are not too often. </s>
<s> All the above relies on the HD being functional. </s>
<s> Pass on more information and we'll go from there Good Luck P </s>
<s> The comp. </s>
<s> only shows the flashing ? </s>
<s> and does nothing else. </s>
<s> However, when the disc install. </s>
<s> is in, the computer chimes, the apple and spinning wheel are there and it goes to the install screen. </s>
<s> This is the only way I can do anything. </s>
<s> I went to disc utility, did the first aid and it says disc is OK. </s>
<s> I even tried to use the archive and install option, but the computer froze. </s>
<s> When I tried it again, the archive option was no longer available, only install for first time or erase and install. </s>
<s> When in disc utility, I went to the &quot;restore&quot; option...Once in there I went to screen and was able to find my photos, but was unable to click on any of them. </s>
<s> They were not in bold print, but they are still there. </s>
<s> How can I get them? </s>
<s> That Hard Drive does not sound healthy. </s>
<s> If the A & I option was there first, but has since disappeared, it is a reasonable sign that the drive is defective. </s>
<s> The flashing question mark means that the system cannot find a viable system folder from which to boot the machine. </s>
<s> The &quot;Restore&quot; function in Disk Utility does not do what it sounds like it would do. </s>
<s> It is for restoring a disk from a disk image, which you do not have, and will do nothing for you. </s>
<s> You would be well advised to leave the disk alone and contact a data recovery service. </s>
<s> They are not cheap. </s>
<s> Only you can make the determination as to whether your data is worth the price that they charge. </s>
<s> Google for &quot;Data Recovery&quot; and you will find lots of hits. </s>
<s> You don't have to specify Mac or Windows, they do any platform. </s>
<s> Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but when a drive appears and disappears, it is not a good sign. </s>
