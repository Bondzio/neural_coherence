I would try to run your same configuration without the powerline adapter.
You could take a long cable and see it works.
You could also move your &quot;AP&quot; closer and use short cable and simulate only being able to see the &quot;AP&quot; by turning the radio off in the router.
As mentioned it could be firmware in the routers or the powerline.
I would load the latest versions on all.
A number of years ago I used a different brand of power extenders and it had a very low limit of mac addresses.
I tried to hook a switch at the far end it would just stop when I connected more than 3 machines.
You could test for this by using the WAN port on the remote &quot;AP&quot; and enabling the DHCP for a different range that your main router is using.
I would recommend you only use this to test since running router behind a router tends to make file/printer sharing a challenge to configure.
