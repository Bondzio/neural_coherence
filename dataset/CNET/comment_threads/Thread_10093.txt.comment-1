I just purchased a new Maxtor 200 gb usb 2.0 hard drive because my old drive was going to crash.
I transfered all of my files to the external drive and everything went fine.
I then installed a new internal hard drive and set up windows.
I loaded up the software for the Maxtor hd and everything was installed but the drive isn't showing up in my computer.
I set it up in disk management but when I try to double click the drive it says that it's not formatted, do i want to format now.
What do I do?
I don't want to have to reconnect the old drive and transer stuff over again.
Is there something I did wrong?
