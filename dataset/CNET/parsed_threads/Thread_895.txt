<s> My Epson stylus c-62 printer has recently started printing only part of a page, even if i print a multiple page document, i get only the top part of the pages- sometimes just a few lines, sometimes half the page, sometimes two thirds of a page. </s>
<s> this happens no matter what my source is, word, notepad, internet, it does not matter. </s>
<s> it worked fine when i was using windows 98, i recently upgraded to windows xp. </s>
<s> i can't remember if it started when i changed over or if it was awhile after. </s>
<s> my pc is a dell pentium 4,with alot of RAM and a large hard drive. </s>
<s> i have tried everything. </s>
<s> please help. </s>

<s> Please contact me via my profile. </s>
<s> I have a few spare ink carts for the c62 Bob </s>
<s> Here is the website for the newer drivers, etc for the C-62 http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/supDetail.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=yes&oid=14418&prodoid=22966681&infoType=Downloads&platform=Windows It could also be that there has been a problem for the printer. </s>
<s> If the new drivers do not solve the problem, I would explore a different printer as the C-62 is getting old. </s>
