1.1.1	I was wondering if anybody has ever been able to get both GPU's to work in a Asus M2N32-SLI board i just got it at a great price and still waiting for the rest of my stuff to arrive to build my system Or if any ideas on a good video card for my system for less than 150 dollars thanks MB-M2N32-SLI Deluxe CPU-AMD X2 6400+ BE HD-320G WD SATA MEM-$G OCZ Gold 6400 PSU-ABS BZ800 OS-XP PRO 64 bit	St
1.2.1	&quot;OS-XP PRO 64 bit&quot; The number of posts pleading for help to get drivers for this OS is amazing.	St
1.2.2	Sorry, but why are you driving towards this brick wall?	St
1.2.3	In closing, it looks ok but I'd like to see 500+ Watt PSU in that list and some idea if gaming is an issue since OS-XP PRO 64 bit would not be a good choice for that.	St

1.4.1	Thank you I was told to get this card and was not aware of the conflicts till after i bought it =( and the PSU is a 800W =)o well i guess i will be looking into them cards thx =)	St
1.5.1	if you've got one of those dual GPU 7800GT's, well, great, but if you're looking to buy one, I wouldn't, for two reasons: A) only about 1000 exist, so they're hard to find B) they aren't worth the money/time compared to whats on the market in the $150 price range, I'd look at the HD 2900GT (as has been suggested), the HD 3850, and HD 3870 (all from ATI) as well as the 8600GT, 8600GTS, and 8800GT (yeah that ones gonna be a strech, and these are all from nVidia) and I would NOT go with XP x64, driver/application compatability is horrible (and yes ramarc, I see your driver link, now find links for every other device and piece of hardware he could ever intend to use with his computer, in addition to patches and updates for every piece of software he could ever intend to use for his computer) I'd go with XP Pro honestly	St
