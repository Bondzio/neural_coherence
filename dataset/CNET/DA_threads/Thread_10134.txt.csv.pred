1.1.1	hi...im new to raid arrays.	St
1.1.2	i currently have a 1.5tb hdd.	St
1.1.3	i recently purchase another 1.5tb drive and i'd like to setup an array using the two disks.	St
1.1.4	foremost i want to implement a RAID 1 to achieve mirroring for data security.	St
1.1.5	however would also like to have the speed increase of stripping.	St
1.1.6	im considering using a OS based RAID 10, partitioning 4x 750gb partitions.	St
1.1.7	howver my mobo does support RAID arrays...and i curious about the differences between os based and hardware based raid systems..thnx.	Ques
1.2.1	RAID 1 is rather interesting in that over the years I found it to save a customer ONCE.	St
1.2.2	It seems a shame that they worked and paid so much for a once in a lifetime event.	St
1.2.3	Today they learned the lesson and just image the drive each week and sync files daily.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	some on-board raid is pretty slow also.	St
1.3.2	but nvidia's mediashield performs well and intel's matrixraid is even better.	St
1.3.3	matrixraid will allow you to partition two drives into 4 partitions and mirror the first partition of both drives and stripe the second partition of both drives.	St
1.3.4	a hardware based striped array set can typically only be moved to another pc with the same raid controller.	St
1.3.5	but a windows' based stripe-set could be moved to another pc if you configure your drives as dynamic disks.	St
