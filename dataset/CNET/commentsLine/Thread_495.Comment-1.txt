here take a look at this motherboard  i don't get it, two pci slots are in between the two pci-e x16 slots.
how will you be able to use the pci slots if you have 2 gpus in sli if the the sli bridge will obstruct the access/installation of the pci slots?
or is it that this board does not require the sli bridge at all?
