Does anyone have any great ideas about how to get data OFF of my ext hd?
The hard drive (used successfully less than 1 month) is definitely bad, and WD Support says &quot;Well if possible, move all data off the drive.
At this point, you will need to have the drive replace.&quot; Running WinXP, ext HD is Western Digital Passport 160gb.
Have tried connecting ext HD to a desktop, just in case problem was with my laptop - no good.
When I connect ext HD, all is good.
then once I start to actually use the thing, it eventually stops responding so i disconnect ext hd, reconnect, and resume.
generally, can copy a few files over to laptop before it stops, but with over 40gb already on there, i could be at this all year.
anyone have any ideas?
I am furious about the cavalier attitude that WD is taking about my data!
