Thanks for replying!
I don't think it has to do with the location of the router-- I can be sitting right next to it and move my computer off of my lap and it will go into limited-connection mode.
Other laptops in the house don't have this problem either.
I'm on channel 6 because other houses are on 1 and 10.
How can I check if my laptop is on &quot;a&quot; like you said?
The router is set to &quot;11b/11g standard&quot; mode.
The only other option on the router is &quot;G enhanced&quot; which I don't think is what I'm looking for.
