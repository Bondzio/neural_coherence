<s> I have three computers that connect to a US Robotics router. </s>
<s> The first two computers are fine. </s>
<s> The third one, however, seems invisible to the first two, even though it can see THEM. </s>
<s> All computers have Norton Firewall, which are all set to allow the network activity. </s>
<s> What gets me, is that all computers can ping each other with no problems. </s>
<s> What the heck is wrong with this third computer? </s>
<s> They are all running Windows XP. </s>
<s> 1) File and Printer sharing anabled 2) Something set to be shared 3) Turn off the firewall to see the effect </s>
<s> I've had a lot of problems with Norton Firewall. </s>
<s> Try disabling it and the built-in Windows firewall and see what happens. </s>
<s> I bet they'll all be able to see each other and be able to connect to each other. </s>
<s> If this works, you'll need to edit the firewall rules in Norton. </s>
<s> I remember using the computer's name and the find function. </s>
<s> Once the computer I was at found the other computer, I could then do file sharing or whatever I wanted. </s>
<s> Just because the computers don't show up on each other screen doesn't always mean you can't get one computer to find and work with another computer. </s>
<s> I do remember that if one computer didnot find the another computer it was usally caused by the computer being disconnected. </s>
<s> I then rebooted all the computers and then tried again. </s>
