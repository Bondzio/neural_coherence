<s> I have an hp 533w with no OS and no working cd drive. </s>
<s> I need to have it working. </s>
<s> Because my money is going into remodeling my place, I will not be able to afford a new system for a little time. </s>
<s> It has a working floppy drive and 384M of RAM. </s>
<s> There's dos but not much else. </s>
<s> See FREECYCLE on google and ask for someone to donate you a free CD drive. </s>
<s> Those type drives are worthless on the market when you find DVDRW drives on sale for 20 bucks. </s>
<s> A CD drive is about what you need to get. </s>
<s> Its going to make reloading the OS that much better and you'll need it anyways over time. </s>
<s> The cost of a new CD drive is pretty cheap. </s>
<s> if you can't do that a &quot;borrowed&quot; drive will do fine provided you have no CD issues. </s>
<s> I have found used CD drives at the Goodwill and Sal. </s>
<s> Army outlets, just be sure you get a later model. </s>
<s> You can contact or get the &quot;floppy version for XP&quot; if still available to load that way, but this is a very drawn out process. </s>
<s> Goto MS support and get the info about XP floppy install, but since you have HP or a provided OEM version of XP(I suspect), its an open question. </s>
<s> Contact HP for any possible XP OS disks to load, but again for a small cost if still provided. </s>
<s> XP is in itself an OS overshadowed by the Vista OS and HP may no longer provide certain support. </s>
