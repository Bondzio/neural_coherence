<s> I'm planing to buy a 3G router for my MTS Datacard(3.1Mbps).I would like to know if it supports my ZTE AC 2766 Modem(MTS Mblaze)(India) or can you suggest me other routers which may be compatible.I need to share my internet connection to my android phone,printer,PC and Laptop.I've checked some of the brands like Edimax-6128n,Iball-3g+Wi Fi,Tenda,Tp-link routers but I'm confused as to which to buy and which is compatible. </s>
<s> It's pretty simple. </s>
<s> Ask the seller for their refund and support policy. </s>
<s> If you did select your USB stick then find the router and check it's compatibility list. </s>
<s> Since you have this stick info and you are in the country where this is used, your research should go much faster than mine. </s>

<s> Hi, I asked the dealer whether My MTS datacard( http://mtsindia.in/Karnataka/netonthego.html ) is compatible they said that since I'm using a 2g dongle (3.1Mbps) they said that it s better if I have a 3G dongle as the Asus 3G( http://in.asus.com/Networks/Wireless_Routers/WL330N3G/ ) router is designed to give better performance for 3g dongles only,now I do not understand what they r saying is it so that if I use dongles other than 3G the net speed would be a bit less than if i directly connect my mts dongle to my PC,could you please help. </s>
