Hi all My Dell Dimensions 8200 (6 yrs old) has a 64MB NVidia TI4200 - it appears to have died - diagnostic lights on back of PC indicate issue with graphics card and get no signal to screen.
(tried re-seating it several times) Looking for a replacement agp card - any suggestions - there don't seem to be many around these days and don't want to have to mess with changing power supply etc.. another question Can I use a PCI card instead - would the PC boot up if I used one in place of an AGP type?
thanks PC Dell 8200 Windows XP 256MB memory
