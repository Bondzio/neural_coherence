<s> I need some info on NIC's, I don't really understand how they work. </s>
<s> What is 10/100? </s>
<s> From what I've heard, I think 10/100 NIC's should run at 100mbps... but mine is running at 10mbps... My computer is running behind a D-Link DI-524 Router also, what is gigabit? </s>
<s> http://www.howstuffworks.com/ There isn't much to write here yet since I never duplicate common web content. </s>
<s> However it would be proper for most NICs to run at 10 Mb if there were connected to most DSL or Cable modems. </s>
<s> But detail is missing. </s>
<s> You mention a DI 524, but not much else. </s>
<s> For the internet, this speed is sufficient and nothing needs to be fixed. </s>
