Hi all... My Netgear RP614 v.2 router has begun &quot;disallowing&quot; certain sites to be accessed, with no changes or input from me.
The biggest site in question is USPS.com, which is a vital part of running my business.
I can access the site with the router bypassed.
I have upgraded the router's software, reset all defaults, adjusted MTU, etc., with no results.
I spoke with Netgear and they suggested that I will need to obtain the USPS.com port number(s) and manually input them into the router.
My question is how do I obtain such port numbers, and how do I input them into the router, &quot;forcing&quot; it to allow that site?
Any help would be very much appreciated!
