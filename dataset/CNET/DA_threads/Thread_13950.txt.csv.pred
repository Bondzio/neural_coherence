1.1.1	Hello all , I 'm building a new pc and I was looking at which CPU i was going to use .	St
1.1.2	can some one go to the link below ( a comparison of two I am looking at ) and tell me why the price is different by so much ?	Ques
1.1.3	Intel Core2 Quad Q9450 2.66GHz Socket LGA775 , 1333MHz , 12MB , 319.00 Intel Core 2 Quad Q6700 2.67GHz Socket LGA775 , 1066MHz 8MB , 448.99 http : //www.komplett.ie/k/kcp.aspx ? sku=344758 & sku=338086 Thanks for reading .	St
1.2.1	The faster chip has lower yields so you pay more .	St
1.3.1	I 'm glad you provided the web link , as I used that to compare .	St
1.3.2	You 'll find the manufacturing process is 45n vs 65n .	St
1.3.3	The newer 45n means you pay for the new machinery and you got the latest and greatest cpu under that process .	St
1.3.4	Also , the attached cache , etc .	St
1.3.5	make for improvements overall , but if they can fitted in the same amt .	St
1.3.6	of limited die space and more for later cpu releases , you 're supporting the newest cpu effectively which is always higher in cost .	St
1.3.7	tada -- -- -Willy	St
1.4.1	the Penryn CPUs ( 45nm ) are selling for less than 65nm parts because Intel is determined to take block AMD 's Barcelona from establishing a toehold in the mainstream PC & server markets .	St
1.4.2	Seems to be working and AMD had to drop back to tri-core for Phenom to make money .	St
1.4.3	You are getting an incredible deal for the price of the 45nm Yorkfields .	St
1.4.4	Less energy , cooler and same performance as higher clocked Kentsfields .	St
1.4.5	Read these if you so care about differences .	St
1.4.6	http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_2 # Penryn http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenom_ % 28processor % 29	St
