sticks of ddr sdram.
&quot;matched&quot; just means two sticks of the same size and speed.
your mobo probably has two sets of different color ram sockets.
[either a total of four or six sockets].
to use dual channel, one stick must be in the first slot of each color.
keep in mind that your fsb will still be 200 mhz.
[just the way that the mobo mfrs deignate things] the cpu will be running at 800 mhz memory speed.
the memory must be ddr 400 [or faster], also known as pc 3200.
[it is actually 200 mhz memory that gets double clocked thus is called ddr 400, kind of confusing, isn't it] the stick that you have now must be that or better in order for the system to show an fsb of 200 mhz.
this info should be in the manual that came with your mobo.
it is not always too clearly written due to the &quot;pidgen english&quot; used by the taiwanise authors.
hopefully my explanation will help to clarify it a little,
