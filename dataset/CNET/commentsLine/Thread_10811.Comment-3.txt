i didn't try anything.
i plugged my old notebook's hd into the enclosure after having initialized and formatted the new/other hd, and hesitated because, well, i don't want to lose a few hundred gigabytes of data.
this drive from my old computer has no partition at all.
i don't know what else you would need to know.
