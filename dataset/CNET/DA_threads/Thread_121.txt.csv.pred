1.3.1	Often enough as Robert mentioned , & quot ; bad caps & quot ; are a problem especially with these smaller form PCs .	St
1.3.2	That also includes the PSU itself .	St
1.3.3	I have reseated several times the connections and that helps if not a bad cap problem as the cabling can be pinched at odd places , e tc..	St
1.3.4	If a bad cable , replace until found .	St
1.3.5	If you do in fact find a bad cap or mtrbd .	St
1.3.6	itself , you should consider moving away from it , only a mtrbd .	St
1.3.7	replacement works ( fixed ) because of old age , etc.. Ebay for a working replacement mtrbd .	St
1.3.8	if so inlcined .	St
