First, thank you Bob (Profit.M) for answering my question again.
Through the years I have often been glad to have you answer my questions.
I hope you get paid!
Concerning the WLAN, how strong can a Wireless Network be to be withing the regulations of the USA?
I am not in the US, but still would like to know to have an idea, and maybe use them here too.
Would you consider taking the amplifiers out of the plan for this network?
(Would it be a waste of money?)
