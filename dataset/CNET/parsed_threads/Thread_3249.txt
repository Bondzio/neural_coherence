<s> I am running Windows XP and my start menu as well as my drop down menus are periodically jittery. </s>
<s> It comes and goes, and sometimes changing desktop sizes and resolutions calms it down for short periods. </s>
<s> There seems to be no rhyme or reason for it, and I have tried all the conventional troubleshooting methods. </s>
<s> Sometimes the menus are so jittery that I cannot even read them. </s>
<s> Help! </s>
<s> Are you using a Flat panel monitor or a CRT monitor? </s>
<s> Do you happen to be using a heater, flourescent light or some other electrical appliance right next to your monitor (or computer). </s>
<s> That can cause problems similar to what you describe as well. </s>
<s> The problem only occurs when you have that device on. </s>
<s> If you have a CRT the refresh rate should be set to at least 72Hz or you do get flicker, which may be what you mean by Jittery. </s>
<s> You do this in Advanced Settings. </s>
<s> The thing to try is a different monitor or your monitor on a different system to try and narrow down the cause. </s>
<s> Hello, The monitor is a CRT one and I have tried several refresh rates with it. </s>
<s> It is now 80Hz. </s>
<s> It always settles down after I make a change but then starts acting up again. </s>
<s> There are no other electrical devices near it. </s>
<s> I have a surge protector, but there are only computer related devices plugged into it. </s>
<s> The only thing I haven't tried is moving my monitor to my other computer..I will do that in the near future. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
