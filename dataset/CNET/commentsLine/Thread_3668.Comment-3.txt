to me it sounds like some harmonic being created and emanating from the cover.
you said a pencil tapping on a can.
the covers on newer drives can be very thin and made to flex easily.
that could be just the way it sounds when the heads move and the vibration is picked up by the cover.
putting some foam tape on it might have reduced the noise.
of course the 1tb drive will be a different model and could be made differently.
as long as you're happy with it, that's fine but don't think that all drive noise is an omen of impending doom.
