<s> Hi I have a Compaq SR1109UK (XP) which all of a sudden has stopped regonizing my DVD/CD RW as a re writable drive. </s>
<s> It come up with a message saying ''Incorrect Function, E:/'' I have Record Now 7.1 installed which i use to burn cds. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatful. </s>
<s> Mat </s>
<s> Software such as InCD/Roxio needs to be uninstalled and reinstalled. </s>
<s> Try that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> No that didn't work its still not working! </s>
<s> This discussion can't go far without details. </s>
<s> -&gt; WHAT SOFTWARE is installed to give the CDRW as a DISK DRIVE feature? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> sorry, I reinstalled Record Now 7.1 </s>
<s> http://www.sonic.com/products/recordnow/deluxe/whatsnew.asp does not list this as having this capability. </s>
<s> Let's try turning off the IMAPI service in XP as noted at http://aumha.org/win5/a/xpcd.php Bob </s>
<s> Ok, i've done that and nothing has changed. </s>
<s> Mat </s>
<s> Or ''Autorun'' on the drive in question. </s>
<s> At this point, if that ''fixes'' the message then it's an autorun issue. </s>
<s> Your choice could be: 1. </s>
<s> System Restore to before the error. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Try the AUTOFIX utility. </s>
<s> AutoPlay (Click to see an example screenshot) when inserting a CD or DVD are pictures, music files, video, and mixed content which can be set for automatically, display a prompt to choose an action, or to take no action at all when a specific file type is encountered . </s>
<s> If the options appear correctly set, see if running the Microsoft Autoplay Repair Wizard AutoFix.Exe will fix the problem. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Suggested reading, Using and Configuring AutoPlay. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> I don't think its a autoplay problem, still have problem Mat </s>
<s> Repairs to autoplay can reassociate the actions Windows performs when you put in the CD. </s>
<s> Sorry to see you dismiss what may be the fix. </s>
<s> Best of luck, Bob </s>
<s> Thanks anyway. </s>
