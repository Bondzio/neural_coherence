How do I know those numbers?
I bought a few Watt Meters to find out where and what uses what amount of power around the house.
I'm sure I made my 20 bucks back as I found simple things like a cordless phone that was rarely used but drew 3+ Watts 24x365 days a year among other bigger discoveries.
Heck that's only 26,280 Watt hours I cut back with a 3 Watt device!
1 pound of coal can generate 8,800/9,500 of a kilowatt-hour, or 926 watt-hours.
So that single change cut my yearly use by 28 pounds of coal.
