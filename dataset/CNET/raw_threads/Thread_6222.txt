Calculate the distance for 1 hop, 2 hop till 100. Also consider an other network with 200 nodes containing the nodes at 1 hop and 2 hop from the centralized node. Calculate the probability of accessing the centralized node and also compare the probability of both network with 100 and 200 nodes.

Yes, in the past they tried this concept in the &quot;Ricochet&quot; service and products but it's long gone and a testament to the idea. Don't let anyone talk you into figuring this out or investing in it. Bob
