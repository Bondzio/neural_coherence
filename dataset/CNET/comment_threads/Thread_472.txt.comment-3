We know there is not an affordable machine made that won't tax you in too many ways from electrical use to spending as much as a new home that does not slow down.
But let's say you want a gaming desktop.
The easy path is to go get one.
Look at the video card list at http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-geforce-gtx-480,2598.html as you can scale up according to your budget.
As to the host PC I suggest the usual Core i7 or 4 to 6 cores and start with the usual 4GB RAM and the Windows 7 64 bit OS.
If you don't want to learn how to build this machine, get it ready to use.
