I was at my company office in a city other than my own and logged onto the wireless network there on a peer-to-peer connection.
However, on my return I have noticed that as soon as I log in to my notebook,irresp.
of the location, I get the little icon on the RHS corner of my screen informing me that the default network has been detected.
The only place this doesn't happen in at my office since the notebook detects the office wireless connection.
I have netstumbler loaded and it too first detects the network but then disconnects soon after.
Any ideas why this could be happening ?
How can I make out if my notebook is detecting someone elses network and how do I locate such a network if this be the case ?
More importantly, how do I prevent such a network from being detected in the first place ?
Any and all advise welcome S
