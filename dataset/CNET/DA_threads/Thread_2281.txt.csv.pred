1.1.1	I have just installed my motherboard (Elitegroup Ks57a( into a new case (Axio ATX 732 X5 Series) This case comes with two front USB ports as well as a headphone and mic jack.	St
1.1.2	I have hooked up the USB ports,(although one is current not working) but the headphone and mic jack setup is giving me problems.	St
1.1.3	I can't make heads nor tails of how to connect them to my motherboard.	St

1.1.6	They pins on the ribbon for the headphone and jack from the case are: L-IN - White wire L-OUT - Red wire GRND - Black Mice - IN - Orange R-OUT - Red R-IN - White MIC - IN - Green GRND - BLK The confusing thing is the pins on the motherboard seem to be marked differently then what is in the manual.	St
1.1.7	But the pin setup is the same with 5pin on the left and a 3 blank 1 pin on the right.	St
1.1.8	If anyone can sort this out for me or point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it.	St

1.2.5	If anyone can sort this out for me or point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it.&quot; The manual is often a rushed affair.	St
