1.1.1	I recently purchased an ATI video card strictly because of the TV OUT feature ( I play online poker and it would be very nice to be able to play in my recliner ) the card I bought with TV OUT is a PCI card .	St
1.1.2	The video card that came with my computer is BUILT IN to my motherboard .	St
1.1.3	Whenever I try and boot up with my new card , the computer will freeze shortly after it boots .	St
1.1.4	I have disabled and uninstalled the first video card with the DEVICE MANAGER but it continues to freeze .	St
1.1.5	I believe that it is a conflict with the 2 cards but how do I get the computer to just forget about my first card since I cant take it out ... .. any help would be MUCH APPRECIATED ... .	St
1.1.6	THANK YOU !	St
1.2.1	Sounds like you must go into the BIOS , by booting without the new video card , and look for an option to disable the on board video .	St
1.2.2	Some systems will automatically detect a video card has been added so the other will work , but yours apparently is not capable of this .	St
1.2.3	You will find out that TV out is pretty low quality on a TV , it is extremely grainy and only acceptable at 640x480 resolution .	St
1.3.1	you have to go into BIOS by hitting Delete at the beginning of the boot and then somewhere in there you can disable the onboard video card .	St
1.4.1	With some systems you hit delete .	St
1.4.2	With others you hit F1 or F2 or F10 or other combinations .	St
