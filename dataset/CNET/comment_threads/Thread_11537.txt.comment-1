I recently purchased a gateway 510s with 1024mb of ram.
I bought it used from Goodwill and am trying to put together a computer for my grandfather.
It came without a harddrive.
when I turn the power on without a harddrive it will power up and I can get into the bios, but when I install an IDE harddive, it does not boot.
The fan runs, but the monitor remains black.
Please help.
