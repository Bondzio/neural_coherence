As you may suspect I'm a bit fearless since I would have a backup ready.
Since you have another scanner, must this scanner be brought back?
And also look at what HP offered.
It's a &quot;basic&quot; driver so who knows (they don't tell and I don't own this scanner) if they enabled the backlight for the film accessory or not.
Maybe this needs a test on another machine or you to learn if System Restore on XP, Vista is functional on your machine.
