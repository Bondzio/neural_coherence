Thanks Bob - Parasites are certainly a possibility and I did read the info you provided to another post.
I was experiencing hijacks on the web, etc.
but thought I had cleaned them well enough and protected my machine.
I now use Stopzilla as a pop up blocker which seems to work very well.
Could a parasite be causing random locks and improper boots repeatedly - and why would the machine boot properly one time and not the next on power up?
Could it be that simple - blasted parasites and hijack code?
