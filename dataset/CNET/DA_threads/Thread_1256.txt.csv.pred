1.1.1	ok heres my problem.	St
1.1.2	i live on a navy base in japan.	St
1.1.3	the only internet we have here is either dial up or wireless broadband by some company name NTT.	St
1.1.4	ive heard stories of how this internet isnt stong enough to send out good enough signals so that everyone can pick them up.	St
1.1.5	i dont want to have to resort to dial up.	St
1.1.6	what would i need in order to be able to revieve this signal and get my wireless internet.	St
1.1.7	i know it says it will work with any 802.11 reviever but people say theres is always down and what not.	St
1.1.8	i want mine to run smoothly at all time and never have to worry about it.	St
1.1.9	i want my $35 a month to be worth it.	St
1.1.10	thanks.	St
1.2.1	Why?	St
1.2.2	Just by living in the Navy base.. you will subject to all their regulations, and one of them .. maybe .. a limited access to internet... Others, might include interference from Navy activity or devices..	St
1.2.3	So, maybe those people who says, its always down or slow, etc.. they might be right...	St
1.3.1	no regulations.	Res
1.3.2	the navy does not run the internet.	St
1.3.3	and i can move im in the navy and im stationed here.	St
1.3.4	isnt there just something that i could get that will pick up the signal better.	St
1.4.1	www.freeantenna.com http://www.usbwifi.orcon.net.nz/ www.radiolabs.com	St
1.5.1	okay anything that i could buy rather then make myself.	Sug
1.5.2	start with the basics.	St
1.5.3	lets not jump ahead to quickly.	Sug
1.6.1	I'd like to use a example here to describe wireless.	St
1.6.2	WIreless is a burst tranmission.	St
1.6.3	Meaning it sends out information in multiple packets over time rather than sending a constant signal.	St
1.6.4	So you (Wireless User) are Johnny P's (ISP) dad.	St
1.6.5	You're out playing footbal with him and you tell him to pass the ball.	St
1.6.6	He's got a poor arm (bad signal) and can't always reach you with his passes.	St
1.6.7	Either little Johnny P has got to get a better arm, or you have to move to a better location to get his passes (recieve).	St
1.6.8	Now, you could invest in a better antenna, but it's as simple as adding tinfoil to your computer.	St
1.6.9	802.11 protocol uses the 2.4Ghz bandwitdh which is very populated by other things besides wireless.	St
1.6.10	Read the FCC statment on yuor wireless card... it will explain this too.	St
1.6.11	I would suggest trying to get a more advanced card.	St
1.6.12	What can you do with out spending money?	St
1.6.13	Trying positioning yourself higher.	St
1.6.14	The higher you are the more chances you have of recieveing the signal.	St
1.7.1	that was a lot more help then the other guy.	St
1.7.2	i heard that if you put the actual antenna outside it picks up a better signal so i got a cord that reached to the window and put the antenna outside.	St
1.7.3	no luck yet.	Polite
1.8.1	Please note in the line where I stated that &quot;it's easy as adding tinfoil to your computer&quot; That is should read: &quot;It's NOT as easy as adding tinfoil to your computer&quot;	St
