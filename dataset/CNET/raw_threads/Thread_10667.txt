How noticable would the difference be in gaming and application performance? I'm thinking of getting a Dell Inspiron 1505 and am debating whether or not to spend the extra cash ($75) to get the upgraded processor (I've already put all the other highest end components available on it).

7546	2	243244	2461306	2461033	ramarc	4/16/07 6:46 AM	1.17670596E12	about 12% faster in cpu intensive apps	10% clock boost and 3-4% boost for the added cache.

Although the Nvidia costs $30 more in the config, I've read and seen benchmark scores that support the ATI being the better GPU. I've also since read educated opinions that suggest the 2GHz processor will have a very minimal effect on gaming, especially considering I can only put a middle of the road GPU in.
