Hello.
I recently decided to try to hook up two monitors to my Dell Dimension 5100C.
I had been using my ATI Radeon x600 SE with one monitor, but the system also has integrated graphics on the motherboard.
I thought I could simply hook up a second monitor to the integrated graphics VGA output, but it seems that my motherboard keeps the integrated graphics card disabled so long as my ATI card is connected to its PCI slot.
I tried going into the BIOS to enable the onboard graphics, but it isn't an option; the only way I can enable it is by removing my ATI card.
Does anyone know of a way to stop my on-board graphics card from being disabled automatically?
