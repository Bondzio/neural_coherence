I own a Lacie external hard disk which I used before with the iMac: now that I have a Windows computer it doesn't recognize it anymore. I can hear the sound of the USB connection port but other than that nothing appears. What should I do? Clearly it's an issue from Mac to Win but how do I solve it? Thanks in advance

Your post did not tell what file system you selected on the Apple nor did it write if files needed saving. To start over and format this drive I head to Disk Management (click start, type same) and remove the old partitions, create new ones and format the volume. All levels of expertise arrive here so I can't know if you know the basics of Windows, so hope this helps, Bob
