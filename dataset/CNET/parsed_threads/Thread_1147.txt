<s> I need a reliable Internet capable machine that can be used easily to send ecards from a selection of ecards available on the machine. </s>
<s> I think wireless will be better, but no other functions are required. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> The Asus Eee-Pc weighs 3.17 pounds and &quot;up to 7 hours&quot; battery life. </s>
<s> I'd start with that if you want a netbook. </s>
<s> Bear in mind that netbooks have no DVD/CD drives, so you might want to invest around $30 for an external ones. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> Since Windows isn't that reliable I think you mean the PC. </s>
<s> At the office we have about half a dozen netbooks and all have been reliable. </s>
<s> The last one was from Walmart and they work too. </s>
<s> About the ecards on the machine. </s>
<s> Not one laptop/netboook comes with ecards so you would install some email app. </s>
<s> Let's hope you are not thinking about Incrediamail since that's not reliable. </s>
