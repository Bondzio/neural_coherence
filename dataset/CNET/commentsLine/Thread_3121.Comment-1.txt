i have a 3.5&quot; samsung hdd from a computer that was dead and converted it to a external hard drive but when i tried to format with easus partition software i got an error message that the format could not be completed and a second later a message that the usb storage driver could not be detected since then i have tried many ways to connect the external hdd but it's not recognized since then.
any ideas of what could it be and how could i solve it.
thanks in advance.
