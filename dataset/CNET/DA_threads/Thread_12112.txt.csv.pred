1.1.1	Good Morning, Currently working on two flavours of the Toshiba NB525 and everytime I feel like I'm getting somewhere a wall pops up and smacks me flat on the ass.	St
1.1.2	See, my current contract holder has decided (against all supported arguement) that netbooks are the future and wishes to replace desktops with them.	St
1.1.3	In the next few months I am expected to have upwards of 400 of these little ******** rolled out.	St
1.1.4	That being said, doing each one manually would be a pain in the rear and I've been working with our ZENWorks manager to get our imaging server compatible.	St
1.1.5	Well images can be made but there are still massive issues with imaging as these netbooks just dont seem to want to work the way I tell em to.	St
1.1.6	Anyways question is.. Is anyone else doing netbooks through an imaging server?	St
1.1.7	If so what OS are you using?	St
1.1.8	(We're trying to use windows7) What hints or tips can you give out?	St
1.2.1	Microsoft has courses and seminars on this.	St
1.2.2	Is the IT staff unwilling or unable to take the courses on this?	Ques
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	I only hold the contract to work in the shop, the in-house technicians are reluctant to use Microsoft anything(except as standard OS') and while they have access to microsoft training, I do not and since I am on contract I will not be given any.	St
1.3.2	To be honest, I feel like I've been placed in a box of bricks, because I am constantly relying on others work to further this effort and it is not a high priority to others but it is a major portion of my workload.	St
1.3.3	I would love to take any courses offered but have neither the time (as this contract is paid hourly) or the money(as it would be out of personal pocket) So here i am, looking for any assistance.	St
1.3.4	Thanks	Polite
1.4.1	Over the years I've taken time to go to quite a few.	St
1.4.2	Fast forward to today.	St
1.4.3	Once in awhile you find folk that think what you asked about can be written in one or two pages.	St
1.4.4	Or in this forum in less than a few paragraphs.	St
1.4.5	Sadly it's not that simple.	St
1.4.6	If it was, there would be no need for the courses, books, seminars and investing our time learning our trade.	St
1.4.7	If you must do this at zero cost, be sure to use google but add this -&gt; MSDN.	St
1.4.8	A lot of the course content is on MSDN.	St
1.4.9	Bob	St
