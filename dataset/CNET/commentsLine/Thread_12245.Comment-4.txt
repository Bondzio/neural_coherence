linksys is correct if your house is wired such that all cables have one end in the same location.
for example, if you have four cables running throughout the house and they all have an end plugged into one of numbered ports 1-4, dhcp will assign an ip addresses to whatever device is on the other end of each cable.
the device on the other end may be a computer or another network device, such as a wireless access point or switch.
