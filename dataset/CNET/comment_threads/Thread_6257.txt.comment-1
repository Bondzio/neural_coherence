My primary home wireless is a Linksys WRT54GS Broadband Router.
I have an older Netgear WGR614 Wireless Router that I would like to setup as a wireless bridge to use in another room to connect my other electronics to (i.e tv, blu-ray, Wii).I would appreciate any help on how to accomplish this.Thanks in advance....Phil
