I have had this since last december and have gone through 7 sets of ink . I am looking for a new printer that yields a large number of copies, the printer is less than $100 and the refills are not rediculous. I hope someone can help me I am sick of wasting so much money

After buying a new cartridge, again it ran out after printing approx 20 black &amp; white pages. I thought the cartridge was defected and returned it. I have since bought 3 more and ALL HAVE BEEN THE SAME!!!! There is nothing wrong with the ink, it is the HP Printer . It uses WAY WAY TO MUCH INK. I just replaced it yesterday and printed only 15 pages and it is already OUT again......WHAT PRINTER DO I NEED TO BUY??? I NEED ONE THAT GIVES ME TOP QUALITY PRINTING WITHOUT COSTING A FORTUNE.
