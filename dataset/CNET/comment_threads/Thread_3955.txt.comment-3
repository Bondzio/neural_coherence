You should never put your memory stick on a place where the little child would access.
Right now, in order to get back your data, just disconnect it to your computer.
Since it still could be recognized, it may be fixed somehow.
Do not save new thing on this drive from now on and try to download drive data recovery freeware to get back your videos, such as TestDisk, EaseUs Data Recovery and iCare Data Recovery Free, etc.
After the data recovery process, you would try to format this drive and see whether it could be fixed.
Remember: Never try to save everything important on only one drive in the future.
