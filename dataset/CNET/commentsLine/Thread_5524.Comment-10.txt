while i wouldn't expect an usb device to push it over the edge that's mightly slim.
what happens if you use a powered usb hub?
and i did run into an issue with my palmone tx.
it would garble data when i used an extension cable and cause problems.
connect it directly to the usb port without a cable or only the cable supplied with the player.
