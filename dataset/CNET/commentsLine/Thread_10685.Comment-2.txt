i read where you installed windows but that's never enough.
dell and other machines need a motherboard driver package or a card like this will not be seen.
also there are limitations burned into the bios to only allow some short list of wifi internal cards to be used.
this dogs some that want to swap cards around machines.
but at least i've been able to cure that by ordering the part direct from deal using the service tag on the machine so they get me the right version card.
start with the usual.
the motherboard drivers.
