Although it has the SMARTDISK brand on it CREATIVE has exactly the same product as CREATIVE USB HDD. The problem is that, no matter which USB port I plug the device in, XP keeps saying that it's not plugged into a USB 2.0 port and the device works really slow (at USB 1.1 speed). I tried the device with a number of desktops and notbeooks, and with every USB port on these computers, but always got the same result. The device has a &quot;Y&quot; shaped plug going into the computer, that is two USB plugs parallel. I think one of them is for draining power from another USB port if the main doesn't have enough power. That's what I experienced using the plugs in combinations. It works with the main one plugged in only . Thanks

If I didn't understand this proper, please supply a link or picture of the products. In closing, many laptops don't have USB 2.0 ports. Bob

So, there is only a HDD with it's cable. I couldn't find the cable but here is the description fron it's specs: Cable(s) Included 1 USB cable External Cables included qty 1 Cables form factor External Cables type USB cable I tried the HDD with many new desktops, that i am sure they have USB 2.0 ports. XP keeps saying I'd better plug into another port.. Here is the link to the manufacturer's web page: http://www.creative.com/products/product.asp?category=497&subcategory=514&product=11172 (as a matter of fact, Noon Technology Co., Ltd., China is manufacturing the IDE-to-USB and the case) Thanks
