OK, update... Bought an enclosure at CompUSA, disassembled my Seagate drive (the drive is OK, but the &quot;middle-man&quot; chip bruned out, as I was told by S. customer service), put in the drive in the new enclosure...
Plugged in... XP can't auto-install, or update the drive...
It recognizes a &quot;Storage device is plugged in&quot;, but doesn't go beyond that... What do I do?
HEEEELP.
Thanks
