<s> this may not be the place to post this and if not i apologize. </s>
<s> recently streaming videos have become incredibly slow (in other words they buffer slow even you-tube), i clean my mac often using onyx, deleting cookies and other basic cleaning procedures but so far nothing seems to fix the problem. </s>
<s> A friend of mine told me that it might help to go into flash and increase the amount of information websites are allowed to store on the computer ( or disk space). </s>
<s> as of now info from websites i visit store o amount of info and websites i haven't yet visited, store around 100 kb, just wanna hear some opinions before i change these setting and end up screwing up my computer lol, thanks for any help </s>
<s> it works better than Flash. </s>
<s> However, you could increase the limit for Flash and see if it makes any difference for you. </s>
<s> If it doesn't, then just move it back to the original setting. </s>
<s> Flash is a resource hog and many Mac users block Flash content altogether. </s>
<s> Internet connection speed also plays a major part in the way video is presented P </s>
