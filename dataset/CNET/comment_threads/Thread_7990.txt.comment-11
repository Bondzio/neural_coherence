...that was in the early sipments and the problem appears to have been solved!
It was a Seagate drive they were having problems with and my contact at Best Buy told me the new shipments were Western Digital 160gig ATA100.
I bought one and am amazed at the bang for the buck!
Added a 1 gig dual channel Kingston PC3200 memory kit and a Radeon X600 pro video card and it rocks!
Never did like preconfigured rigs, but this is a near perfect platform to build on according to your needs.
