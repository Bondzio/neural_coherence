thanks for the suggestions...i tried changing the base station and repeater to g only, but this made no difference to the performance of the laptop.
i'm beginning to think there's an incompatibility between my base station (belkin f5d7230-4, revision a) and my laptop's card, a broadcom 4311 mini pci-e card.
same one as is used by dell under the name 1410 (if memory serves).
at this stage, no communication takes place between the two devices.
i cannot get an ip via dhcp, and no activity occurs on the wlan light on the belkin when i try to 'repair connection' via windows.
the broadcom does see the belkin though, at 5 bars / 54mbps strength, and a different machine using an older broadcom chip wirelessly is connected via dhcp, and is screaming.
should also add that the troubled machine has no issues whatsoever connecting via ethernet, and is also fine wirelessly in another network.
thanks!
