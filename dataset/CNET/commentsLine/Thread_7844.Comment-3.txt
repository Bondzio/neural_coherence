it's not completely clear to me what you mean.
assuming you have a bare hard drive not installed in anything, you can buy an enclosure for it for about $20 and connect to your computer via a usb cable.
but then i don't know why wifi would be a factor.
if you're talking about connecting a pc to a network via wifi, you can buy a usb adapter that does that nicely for as little as $10.
good luck.
