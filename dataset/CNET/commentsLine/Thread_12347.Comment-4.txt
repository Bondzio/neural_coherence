i though it was called &quot;the odd multiplier issue&quot; because it only effects multipliers when they are odd numbered (i.e.
13x) so if you get an even numbered multiplier there are not the same problems.
is a good 'quick and dirty' guide, here are some of the numbers... 200mhz reference clock * 12x clock multiplier = 2400mhz cpu frequency 2400mhz cpu frequency / 6 = 400mhz ddr2-800 memory frequency odd clock multiplier... 200mhz reference clock * 13x clock muliplier = 2600mhz cpu frequency 2600mhz cpu frequency / 6 = 433mhz ddr2-866 memory frequency 2600mhz cpu frequency / 7 = 371mhz ddr2-742 memory frequency i very much doubt that anybody could tell the difference in everyday use without having to use bench numbers.
