<s> Hello everyone, I have a Viewsonic 17&quot; LCD Monitor that has died. </s>
<s> The warranty has just expired and I would like to have it fixed, if possible. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any ideas on where to take it. </s>
<s> Of course Viewsonic won't fix it (I'll never buy another Viewsonic again) and I have called several local shops and noone else will either. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Thanks, Chris </s>
<s> &quot;Viewsonic won't fix it &quot; Do you mean they won't fix it at all or just under warrenty? </s>
