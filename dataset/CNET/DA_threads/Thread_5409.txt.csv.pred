1.1.1	Hi I just bought a Dell 15z 5523 Ultrabook (i7-3517U Processor, 8GB DDR 3 1600 Mhz RAM, 256 GB SSD, Nvidia GeForce GT 630M 2GB card etc.)	St
1.1.2	pre-installed with Windows 8, not PRO.	St
1.1.3	I have been using it for a couple of weeks and I just hate it.	St
1.1.4	I know I know, some of us don't want to learn new things or be forced to change our ways just because of some corporate's whim.... That being said, I have searched quite a bit online, and still haven't found a reliable resource which can help me remove Windows 8 completely and install Windows 7 Home Basic.	St
1.1.5	Have received a lot of contradictory advise.	St
1.1.6	Dell did not give me a Windows 8 installation disk.	St
1.1.7	Just a drivers CD.	St
1.1.8	I have the old Windows 7 Home Basic installation disk and drivers.	St
1.1.9	Also, I have already activated 8.	St
1.1.10	If someone asks me to stick with Windows 8 or give benefits of 8 over 7 or tell me to install stuff like Classic Shell it would be a total waste... Can someone give me a step by step guide or a link which has everything explained?	St
1.1.11	Regards Stished	St
1.2.1	Step 1: erase the hard disk with DBAN (free download) Step 2: install windows 7 from the installation disk Step 3: install drivers and utility programs that Dell offers for this machine for Windows 7 I'd add a step 0: make a clone of the drive so you can go back to Windows 8 later.	St
1.2.2	But that's up to you.	St
1.2.3	However, I wonder why you didn't simply a Dell 15z with Windows 7.	St
1.2.4	It's the only one they offer at http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/xps-15z/pd So before doing all of this I'd contact Dell to see if they can sell you recovery disks for Windows 7.	St
1.2.5	Or maybe you're still inside a 30-day return period?	St
1.2.6	That would be the easiest.	St
1.2.7	Kees	St
