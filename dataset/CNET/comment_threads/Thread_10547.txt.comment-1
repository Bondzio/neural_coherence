I've got the following: MOBO: VIA P4M800-M7A RAM: 2 GB PC3200 Crucial DDR (single channel speed) CPU: Pentium D (dual core) 940 @ 3.4 GHz GPU: GeForce PNY 7600 GS AGP 512MB PSU: CoolerMaster eXtreme Power Plus 500w Ok, with these specs I get 68 fps on a Counter-Strike:Source Video Stress Test.
How much would the SAPPHIRE HD3850 512MB help?
I've been told that it wouldn't help much due to my slow RAM and old processor, but I've also been told that it would &quot;run circles around my 7600&quot;.
I'm not sure what to think though.
Considering my current specs, would the HD3850 REALLY be enough of an upgrade for when I buy a whole new PC?
