1.1.1	We have a USB Flash Drive ( San Disk 1 GB ) .	St
1.1.2	Yesterday it worked fine , but today , after trying from multiple computers ( Both PC and MAC ) , the drive is not recognized .	St
1.1.3	Furthermore , the USB Drive 's light does not turn on , so I suspect there is something wrong with the actual circuitry inside of the drive since it wo n't even get power .	St
1.1.4	Is it possible to take the actual memory portion of the drive and get the data off the memory ?	Ques
1.1.5	I do n't think the data is corrupt , just the circuitry inside the drive .	St
1.1.6	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	For 99.99 % of those out there you take the drive and put it into the recycle bin and go get a new drive if the old drive ca n't be formatted .	St
