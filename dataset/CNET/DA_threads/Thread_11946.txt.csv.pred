1.3.1	Cleaning was done about 7 days ago,and then problems started.Anyway i fixed problems about starting.All mess was making +12v connector on motherboard which wasn`t properly plugged in, and when you move computer it shut off immediately.And about overheating, i found reason why it overheat,its heatsink, and he is bad manufactured.
