This probably is a dummy question, but I'm very new to wireless usage, so maybe someone can provide the info I need. Thanks in advance for any information. I live in the south. There is a church near my house which has a school as a part of its operation. Last year I bought a laptop equipped with the hardware necessary for wireless connections. For a few months I got a message on firing up the laptop that a wireless connection had been detected. I don't know if it was the church's connection or not, although I suspected it was because it was the largest quasi-business use nearby. I figured it probably was and didn't try connecting, and several months ago, I stopped getting the message. Early this year the local mullet wrapper printed a story about the county's looking into providing a county-wide wireless system for the general public. In the meantime, the local library system has established wireless servers (?)at each of its branches; yesterday I went to one of the branches and finally learned how to actually use a wireless connection. This morning, before I left for the library branch that I used yesterday, I decided to use my dialup connection at home. After the laptop warmed up, I got the &quot;wireless connection detected&quot; message. So, I connected and am nowing using it; it is about as fast as a DSL connection. Is it possible that the connection I'm using is, in fact, the county library's system and that the coverage of the system is a lot wider than they've let on publicly? In other words that I don't need to go to the branches? The only thing that makes me think this isn't correct is that a lady at the library who was also using her laptop said that a certain spot in that branch did not have as good a connection as where we were.

There are ways of course to boost this, but to the best of my knowledge, 1000 ft. would be the best you could ever achieve in a &quot;perfect&quot; world. So, not knowing how close you are/were to each of the wireless signals you describe, it is difficult to answer your question completely. There are several cities in the US that have &quot;city-wide&quot; coverage of a broadband connection, but even there, certain areas cannot connect, and these use a totally different transmission than your typical wireless router.

Five hair-pulling hours later, I still could not connect to it, even though there were people with laptops all around me connecting without a problem. Unfortunately, the library workers cannot help, even though they offer wireless use to the public. They claim they cannot afford the bucks to hire help people who are comptetent to help people use technology they provide!! I suppose they're telling the truth but it is infuriating, to say the least...

That glitch was that my machine didn't automatically detect the wireless system when I fired it up, but I soon found it by hitting the &quot;Connect to:&quot; button on the Start button. It then performed a search for wireless connections and found the library system. So why in hell couldn't it find it yesterday when I was trying from the same exact spot in the library I used on Monday?
