<s> As the subject title says, I'm trying to build a good gaming computer, and I don't meant top of the line, just something that will allow me to run games such as oblivion/call of duty 4/bioshock with ease. </s>
<s> Only problem is, I don't know a whole lot about computers as far as compatibility goes with the hardware. </s>
<s> So I'm getting my computer off a site and I'll just list what I have in the works and if anybody has free time, I'd appreciate the input. </s>
<s> 600 Watt -- Power Supply SLI Ready Intel Core 2 Quad Processor Q6600 (4x 2.4GHz/8MB L2 Cache/1066FSB) OR Intel Core 2 Duo Processor E6850 (2x 3.0GHz/4MB L2 Cache/1333FSB) Extreme-Performance INTEL CPU Cooling Fan System Kit Asus P5N-E SLI nForce 650i SLI Chipset w/6-channel CODEC, Gb LAN, S-ATA Raid, USB 2.0, IEEE-1394 Dual PCI-E MB 2048MB [1024MB X2] DDR2-800 PC6400 Memory Module NVIDIA GeForce 8500GT 512MB yeah...thats it..and a cd drive which i know will work. </s>
<s> Go for the quad. </s>
<s> Install windows and slim it down to only what you need. </s>
<s> Add another gig of RAM. </s>
<s> Get a good sound card. </s>
<s> An external hard drive for the games. </s>
<s> With the 8500gt, i doubt that will run those games with ease. </s>
<s> Get at least an 8600gt. </s>
<s> It's $50 after rebates at newegg.com last i checked. </s>
<s> I also suggest looking at the new E8xx core 2 duos. </s>
<s> This seems more like a budget gaming system, and will handle most games, good luck. </s>
<s> Really? </s>
<s> Link to ONE good sound card, under $100 that actually has decent drivers for xp and vista. </s>
<s> I'll wait here for a couple of months. </s>
<s> unless there are availablity problems, the e6850 should be replaced with an e8400 ($200 vs $190). </s>
<s> although the e8400 is the same clockspeed (3ghz) it's larger cache makes it faster it runs cooler. </s>
<s> the e8400 will give you better performance in most games than the q6600. </s>
<s> the only exceptions will be unreal tourney 3 and supreme commander in which case they'll be about equal. </s>
<s> http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/cpu/display/core2quad-q9300_9.html#sect0 how much is the &quot;Extreme-Performance INTEL CPU Cooling Fan System Kit&quot;? </s>
<s> if it's more than $20, stick with the retail cooler or go for an arctic cooling freezer 7 pro (about $30): http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835186134 lastly, as mentioned earlier, the 8500gt is not a good gaming card and will struggle in new games. </s>
<s> the minimum card you should consider are geforce 8800gs/384mb ($130, http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814150294 ), radeon hd 3850/512mb ($130, http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102715 ), and geforce 9600gt/256mb ($150, http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814133216 ). </s>
<s> with one of these cards, you'll be able to handle most any game on up to a 20&quot; widescreen. </s>
<s> an 8600gts is about $100, but either the 8800gs or hd 3850 will give you 50-70% better performance. </s>
<s> http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-Details.asp?EdpNo=3876389&cm_mmc=Email-_-Main-_-WEM1623-_-Components&SRCCODE=WEM1623C this barebones has very good components. </s>
<s> if you can cope with the rebate, this would make a good gamer when paired with a 9600gt/8800gt or better. </s>
<s> And look in shoppimng. </s>
<s> Creative Labs sells quite a few. </s>
<s> Me, I run Linux and FreeBSD. </s>
<s> I have ALSA, aRTS, Pulseaudio, and OSS running. </s>
<s> I have a SB card. </s>
<s> I can run multiple streams on it. </s>
<s> Much more than a game on any Windows platform. </s>
<s> You're worried about drivers and support? </s>
<s> Build the drivers ans database for the hardware. </s>
<s> Look for one and ask in a gaming or streaming server forum as to which is better for the price you want to pay. </s>
<s> says the graphics on that one is EVGA nForce 650i Ultra is that as good as an 8800gt or so? </s>
<s> also 400 bucks is alot better than what i was going to spend at ibuypower.com It was going to come with speakers, mouse, and a keyboard. </s>
<s> All that with what i listed in my first post came to a bit over 800, with shipping 900. </s>
<s> But I suppose if money is the problem here, I could just buy the pc and use the speakers/mouse/keyboard i have now and gradually upgrade. </s>
<s> oh wait, the EVGA nForce 650i Ultra I think is the motherboard, hah Also I dont think it comes with a graphics card or disc trays...and no cooling fan, lol, but I'm sure those are cheap and in supply at best buy. </s>
<s> you'll overpay unless you catch a great sale. </s>
<s> if by &quot;disk tray&quot; you mean cd/dvd burner, then best buy will be competitive. </s>
<s> if want a 8800gt, this one is hard to beat since it includes a game and is only $154 before $30 rebate: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814125089 here's a good cooler for $30: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835186134 </s>
<s> greatly appreciated </s>
<s> I'm sure the 8800GT 256MB is better than the 8600GT 512MB and if i get that tower it will have a quad core and 2GB of RAM. </s>
<s> So hopefully i can run the newer pc games like a cheap beast </s>
<s> Get a decent P35 motherboard that will properly support the 45nm e8400-e8500 processors. </s>
<s> If you just have to have an SLI motherboatd you would need to get the 750i variant to properly support the newer 45NM like this board here http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131232 A good Intel board with a single 16x PCIe slot Gigabyte (GIGABYTE GA-EP35-DS3L) will do the trick. </s>
<s> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128337 The Palit 9600GT will play modern games 5x better than the 8500GT will and it's affordable. </s>
