I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH MY LAPTOP AND NET BOOK.
FOUND THIS WEB PAGE THAT SOLVED MY PROBLEMS.
http://www.betterwifirange.com/index.html MY NET BOOK WENT FROM 1 OR 2 BARS TO 5 AT MY HOME.
IT ALSO HELPED WITH A CONDO I RENT IN FLORIDA THAT HAS CONCRETE WALLS, NOT AS GOOD AS HOME BUT DID HELP QUITE A BIT.
