someone tried that here and what a mess to setup.
it didn't work well until we changed to this setup.
internet-&gt;modem-&gt;router-&gt;1gb switched hub-&gt;pcs.
and you can imagine all the whining &quot;it should work...&quot; over and over but we had the 1gb hub so it didn't take long to setup.
there's a lesson here somewhere but i won't write more about it.
