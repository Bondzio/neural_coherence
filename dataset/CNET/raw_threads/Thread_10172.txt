I have an old 100G HD that I've been using as a secondary drive for a longggg time that is in FAT32. Unfortunately, I don't remember how I did it! I've search through CNET but was unable to find any methods to do so. Can anyone help?

Before any utility will work, the hard drive controller MUST have a driver that supports FAT32 drives larger than 137GB (48-bit LBA). SOLUTION: 1. You need to get controller's name from the ''SCSI and RAID controllers'' in the Device Manager. 2. Go to the controller mfg's website to download a Windows XP driver that supports hard drives &gt; 137GB. Since you mentioned Seagate, I am assuming you have a Seagate drive. Seagate describes the problem HERE and also provides links to some controller mfg's at the bottom of the page. If you need help, just post the names of your hard drive controllers in this thread.

The drive I'm currently trying to format fully in FAT32 is Western Digital 120G. I've tried using their software as well as Seagate's, but still cannot pass the 32G barrier in XP.

I can't even generate an iso image to burn on a CD. I was able to use an old Maxtor bootable CD, but it was not able to recognize my drive. I should mention that I'm trying to format a USB external HD.

But with the external USB HD, the expert level just went up a notch. Try LINUX and other partitioning programs or find a Windows 98se machine. Bob

Follow this guide and download the very small prog at the end. http://www.ridgecrop.demon.co.uk/fat32format.htm I used it to format my 40gb usb drive as fat32 in a few seconds. checked it with chkdsk and all is well.

It would be pretty useless if it only formatted the &quot;main&quot; drive,i.e. the one with your OS on it. It will format any drive you follow the instructions for and map a drive letter to.

For win2k, i think it's SP3+ To format a HD brand new w/o windows, as u install windows, u'll be asked to choose a file system. Choose the file system u want. If it's a slave drive, right click it in My Comoputer and choose format, and the file system u want to format in
