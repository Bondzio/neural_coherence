1.1.8	The CD-ROM is being seen as well as the floppy and yes I 've tried reseting the defaults in bios .	St

1.1.10	I 'm running Windows XP home .	St

1.3.1	1 .	St
1.3.2	& quot ; When I exit the BIOS I get the same error & quot ; .	St
1.3.3	That seems OK with a new hard disk until you partition and format it and install an OS on it .	St
1.3.4	You do n't tell anything about that .	St
1.3.5	2 .	St
1.3.6	& quot ; The CD wo n't run & quot ; .	St
1.3.7	What exactly does that mean ?	Ques
1.3.8	If you set the BIOS to boot from the CD first , and put a bootable Windows XP CD in it ( check on another PC that it IS bootable , just to be sure ) , what happens ?	Ques
1.3.9	If BIOS set to boot from CD , the CD is bootable on another machine and does n't boot here , first replace the CD-drive ; if that does n't help it 's time to replace the motherboard .	St
1.3.10	Kees	St
1.4.1	Might be corruption in MBR or MFR files on HD .	St
1.4.2	Many commercial defraggers do not defrag these items they maybe so fragmented there creating errors .	St
1.4.3	Also try uninstalling the RAM and reinstalling it this might clear these errors as well , bad RAM might do this also .	St
1.4.4	If you can get it started again check the virtual memory settings .	St
1.4.5	Set them to & quot ; system managed & quot ; or larger then the & quot ; system managed & quot ; size .	St
1.4.6	Follow Willy 's suggestion on this one , then try these .	St
