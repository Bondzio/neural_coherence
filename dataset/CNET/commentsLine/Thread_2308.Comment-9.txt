hmm, the plot thickens.
1. find that reset button and unplug that.
i ran into a few that were shorted out.
2. double check your motherboard control wiring.
one motherboard document was incorrect and folk could not boot as they had swapped the reset and the hdd led in the docs.
about a 50% rma rate on that one.
3. any ide drives?
unplug, retest (each step and idea here.)
4. check the back side of the motherboard.
i've encountered a lot of extra mounting bolts shorting out the back side.
5. less is more.
to get beeps, no video, memory, hdds, cd/dvds and well, not much is needed.
6. many boards shipped with the cmos clear jumper in the clear position.
they stopped doing that due to high return rates (who reads the manuals?)
