It's about 6 mths old and out of the blue died...it seems to be getting no power, the led light flickers but it makes no sound to indicate power is going to it. After doing some poking around I've concluded that my options are 1)Pay Maxtor $700 to recover my data and then get my hd replaced 2) Try to fix it myself for cheap and void my warranty I'm going with option 2 because I am PISSED at Maxtor and wouldn't trust them again with my $ or my data. Can anyone help with recommendations on cases or any other advice or possible issues that it could be? It's a Maxtor OneTouch III 320GB Hard Drive - Interface (USB 2.0) External Hard Drive.

I see the 40 pin connector etc... Now that I have voided my warranty (yay!) what should I do next? I would like to get my data of off it, I'm pretty sure that the drive is functioning and that it was a case/power issue. I appreciate your help in advance.

I went to Newegg and bought a Venus DS3, popped in the hard drive and was back in business in 5 mins. Thanks for helping me get my data back and saving $700 not to mention frustration. There is something to be said for DIY!

I have E-X-A-C-T-L-Y the same problem and I would like to purchase the same case but in order to not complicate things, I would like to know how can I differentiate if my external hard drive is SATA or PATA? I bought it new around 7 months ago and the only information that the label has is: Model Maxtor Personal Storage 3200. I know the capacity is 500 GB. Do you think that if I buy the same case would save my data? Thanks for your valuable input. Emilio Pastrana

You'll just have to try it. No way to tell otherwise. VAPCMD

It may not be SATA or PATA. I'd contact Maxtor directly or search there site again for the more information.
