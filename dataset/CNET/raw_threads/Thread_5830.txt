My daughter has a program &quot;The Official American Idol Audtion Kit&quot; She used it on my old emachine (eTower 500i) On the T5026, she gets a message 'Not enough mixer lines found to match Record and Playback. Please check you soundcard drivers' How do I do that? My grandson told me to take the soundcard from the older machine. In the system requirements it does say Sound Card that supports full duplex.

The newer T5026 has the improved Intel High Definition 6-channel audio (5.1)sound, but it is also Integrated. &quot;Integrated Sound&quot; has no actual card that can be transferred. The older Emachines had the WinME, or Win98 Operating Systems. Your newer machine has the WinXP Operating System. It could be that like many other older programs the &quot;American Idol Audition Kit&quot; is not compatible with the WinXP operating system. If you have the original box or specifications sheet, it should state the minimum requirements to play. If you not, you can contact them at customersupport@auditionkit.com to see if they have a 'patch' to operate under WinXP. From what I can determine the 'American Idol Audition Kit&quot; sold at Target stores and Best Buy at least a year ago, but I cannot find it listed at those stores anymore. The only other advice is to contact Emachine support where you could still be under warranty.
