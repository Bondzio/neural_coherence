<s> Hello - Can't think of any changes or additions recently other than Apple's latest patch download this morning. </s>
<s> Afterward restarting upon completion of the download, I tried running Disk Utility, First Aid, and got the following message: Disk Utility stopped verifying permissions because there are 'no valid packages'; error .99997. the SMART status shows 'verfifed', and all seems well otherwise, but what could this be? </s>
<s> Thanks Much. </s>
<s> iBook G3 800 mhz, 640 ram, 30 gighd, 19.26 free Panther 10.3.9, Firefox 2.0.0.3 </s>
<s> Tried it again with the same result; but the error code is: -9997, not as in my first post. </s>
<s> Apple nor Google seem to have any info I can find re this particular code; many others, but not this one. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> This worked for me. </s>
<s> You might want to copy and paste this to TextEdit and print it out. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Move iTunes onto the Desktop 2. </s>
<s> Run Disk Utility 3. </s>
<s> Go to HD/Library/Receipts and trash all iTunes .pkg files EXCEPT for iTunesX.pkg and iTunesPhoneDrive.pkg 4. </s>
<s> Empty Trash 5. </s>
<s> Move iTunes from Desktop back to &quot;Applications&quot; Voila! </s>
<s> You should now be able to repair permissions again Let me know how you got on P </s>
<s> Thanks P, but: Moved iTunes to desktop; got the same error message from Disk Utility; checked ''receipts' in the HD Library, but only two records [pkgs] of security updates, and my printer pkg, nothing related to iTunes. </s>
<s> Had such confidence that it'd happened to you also; must be another workaround. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> items in my Receipts folder. </s>
<s> You didn't have a &quot;tidy up&quot; at some time, did you? </s>
<s> The other way around this problem is to find another person with 10.3.9 and copy their receipts folder to your machine. </s>
<s> That should, and has, fixed the problem too. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> on my habits, yes, but I insist I've been GOOD!! </s>
<s> I even trashed WhatSize and all urges to find another Chinese font. </s>
<s> Is this 'copying' from another a firewire type deal? </s>
<s> My daughter has 10.3.9 and a Ft. Knox on iTunes...Thanks </s>
<s> All balled up. </s>
<s> I thought I'd listen to some music so I returned the desktop iTunes folder to the 'music' icon shown in Finder. </s>
<s> But now opening iTunes, the page shows a new screen, with no playlists of mine nor can I open my library from the Finder/music/itunes folder. </s>
<s> It's all gotta be here somewhere; but again, I insist, all was fine until the Apple patch download this morning. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> do you have a backup of your iTunes library? </s>
<s> Swapping out the packages (.PKG) does not actually have any direct connection to iTunes. </s>
<s> The receipts folder is just that, a record of what downloads you have on your machine. </s>
<s> Copying one set of .pkg files to another location should not make a bit of difference to the operating of the machine. </s>
<s> Check out this page, replace the original .pkg files into the receipt folder and try the suggestion. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> I've luckily got perhaps 96% of the library on cd's; but I'd sure hate to lose anything. </s>
<s> My iTunes is the current latest, 7.0.2; just wondering about clearing all up by re-downloading iTunes, hoping that the 'overlay' would fill in the blanks and I'd be able to salvage all? </s>
<s> And, sorry, but I think you forgot the link you'd intended to post in this last reply. </s>
<s> Thanks again, Eric </s>
<s> here is the link http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=25704 If you can, put the original .pkg files back into your Receipts folder and go from there. </s>
<s> If you have the entire iTunes folder, you should still have all the tracks on your machine, somewhere. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> I did a archive/reinstall /update on Panther back to 10.3.9; disk utility now fires up well, and all seems good. </s>
<s> But the iTunes is still 'blank' insofar as my library and playlists. </s>
<s> In my Home folder, as well as in Music, it shows a folder named iTunes Music with 1.47gb, and all my titles, but how do I transfer all this to my iTunes application? </s>
<s> Just opening iTunes from apps goes to the new blank/fresh iTunes page. </s>
<s> Thanks much, Eric </s>
<s> Hold down the Option key and launch iTunes. </s>
<s> It will give you a choice between opening an existing Database or creating a new one. </s>
<s> Choose existing and navigate to where you know your iTunes database is. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> I'm sure this method will work, but perhaps my folders are distributed incorrectly. </s>
<s> All my choices are rejected, both from the 'Home' folder and the 'Music' by a flag saying that an iTunes Library cannot be found. </s>
<s> Getting to be sure here that all my mucking around has divorced the pieces needed for success; there's no doubt it's all here; mating it is another issue. </s>
<s> Could you send me a link showing correct folder'content for what should populate the Home and iTunes Finder icons? </s>
<s> Thanks for the patience. </s>
<s> I might add that my 'previous folder' from today's install is in the trash, but not thrown out. </s>
<s> Doubt that has any effect though. </s>
<s> Miles Davis again fills the room; when I retire I plan to sip with someone who knows this easy stuff cold...so many elegant rules I continually violate. </s>
<s> Thanks again for all this; but if a 'tree' showing correct folder distribution is available, I'd appreciate it. </s>
<s> Hope you're enjoying the spring. </s>
<s> Eric </s>
<s> So, what did you do to achieve the unachievable? </s>
<s> Whatever it was, well done P </s>
<s> What would 'P' do? </s>
<s> After the 'option' key failed, the message was 'iTunes needs the library' etc...There was no library available in iTunes, but I found one after a search in 'everywhere', my favorite category considering my filing systems. </s>
<s> It 'highlited' and I chose it for 'transfer'. </s>
<s> Some few were missing, but most were in my iPod anyway. </s>
<s> Here's my guess on the entire scenario. </s>
<s> If you remember directing me to reinstall the OS when the DVD glitched some time ago, I bought the disks from AppleRescue, tried them, nearly didn't work, but seemed to do Ok. Then they wouldn't work for my other two Macs. </s>
<s> They sent me second copies, nice folks, and they worked fine on those others. </s>
<s> However, I suspect my reinstall lacked some critical components, such as those packages, BSD, and iTunes, that were missing. </s>
<s> This second time I've got an enormous load of pkgs. </s>
<s> Best I can say is that this story satisfies me....Thanks again for sticking with it - Eric </s>
