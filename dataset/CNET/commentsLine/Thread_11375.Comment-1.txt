hello, i'm a high school student, and i was woundering what type of motherboard/cpu combo would be something that i could afford.
i don't really want to spend more than $300 on the pair.
i am a gamer, i would like to have serial ata, raid 0 + 1, and at least 4 slots for memory(specificly ddr400), amd hopefully, and other goodies like that.
what would be the best bang for the buck for the things that i would like?
also, i would like a bios that i can overclock with, and set memory timings.
