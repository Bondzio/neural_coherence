Hello, My (quite) old PC (5 years, I think) has Windows ME and is, of course, as crotchety as Frasier's dad (and as fussy as Frasier).
One day, I downloaded a plethora of MS Windows Updates and installed them.
I didn't notice any particular improvements on my PC, but one thing I immediately noticed was, upon startup, my computer goes into a VERY slow and choppy process, culminating with Windows popping my SYSTEM folder onto the desktop for all to see.
Aside from the obvious security issues this raises, I suspect it's played a not-insignificant role in slowing down my computer's startup sequence.
Does anyone know how I can tell my computer to shut that subroutine off?
Thanx, The Wren
