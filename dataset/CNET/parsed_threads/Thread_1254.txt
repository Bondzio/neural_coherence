<s> I want to stream media from my computer tower (located directly next to my television) to my HDTV. </s>
<s> The problem is this...I am currently running dual monitors and the 2 slots that come out of the back of my graphics card are taken up (one slot for each monitor). </s>
<s> I used to have an HD cable running from my tower to my TV when I ran one monitor...but I don't want to sacrifice dual monitor viewing. </s>
<s> Is there another option, for instance is there some sort of 2 to 1 adapter I can plug into one of the tower slots that will allow a monitor plug in as well as a tower to TV cable? </s>
<s> Basically, the two slots that are HD capable in the back of my computer tower are occupied and I don't want to sacrifice dual-monitors. </s>
<s> How can I run HD from my tower to HDTV to have my TV show whatever is on the computer monitor? </s>
<s> I currently have win xp but this shouldnt matter Thanks. </s>
<s> Why not a HDMI splitter? </s>
<s> Well under 99 bucks on amazon.com Bob </s>
<s> HDMI Splitter? </s>
<s> I was thinking more along the lines of a &quot;switch&quot; like this http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16812186196 Any thoughts? </s>
<s> Your words made me think you wanted to duplicate the displays not switch. </s>
