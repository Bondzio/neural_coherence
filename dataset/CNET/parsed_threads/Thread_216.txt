<s> Hi, I have windows XP installed on my desktop. </s>
<s> I would like to install windows 2003 server on it. </s>
<s> But system won't let me delete the partition. </s>
<s> A message comes up &quot;Unable to delete partition having system files&quot;. </s>
<s> I can install 2003 server on another partition but the aplication which I want to install on 2003 server has script which requires 2003 server to be installed on C drive. </s>
<s> It is not even letting me change the drive letter from &quot;C&quot; to any other letter- message- &quot;Can't change bootable drive&quot;. </s>
<s> Any way out? </s>
<s> Please... </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Boot the Server disc, delete the XP, and install. </s>
<s> Hi Darton, When I boot it through 2003 server, I get Dos prompt. </s>
<s> How can I delete XP through DOS prompt? </s>
<s> Please advice. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
