<s> Is it possible to use a flat screen TV as a monitor for my computer? </s>
<s> If so, how would I hook it up to work? </s>
<s> Mary </s>
<s> vga port on computer to vga port on rear of lcd. </s>
<s> Some Graphic cards have a RCA jack (the Yellow one) or S-video jack If your card has this it can be hooked up just like a DVD player minus the sound of course. </s>
<s> You can also feed the sound through if you wanted to with adapters Radio Shack can help out with those. </s>
<s> Now if you are using a monitor and TV just remember to check the box in the Display Settings, extend my desktop. </s>
<s> If your just using the TV it should automatically pick this up as default monitor. </s>
<s> The hookup cables have yellow, red, and white. </s>
<s> Could you tell me which each one is for? </s>
<s> I already have a DVD player hooked up to my TV but I'm not sure what each color is for so this will help understand the hookup better. </s>
<s> I am not savvy on shortcuts in language so what does Icd mean? </s>
<s> Yellow = video signal Red = right audio channel signal White = left audio channel signal </s>
<s> I'm thinking a 22&quot; flat screen as a tv and pc monitor. </s>
<s> Is the any degradation to either tv or pc? </s>
<s> Will I be compromising either? </s>
<s> Best Brand? </s>
<s> Thanks Bill </s>
