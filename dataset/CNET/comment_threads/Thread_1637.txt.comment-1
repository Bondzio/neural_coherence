I am pretty new to this stuff so I am hoping someone is able to help me out with my problem.
I recently installed a new dvd burner into my system and while it does a good job of making backups the speed leaves something to be desired.
When it first starts to burn it will go up to 3x speed but quickly drop then level off to around 1.6.
Doesnt matter if its DL discs or single layer, and I have tried different brands of media.
I did change it from being the slave drive to the master on the second ide but it didnt change anything at all.
Here is all the info that I can think of that might be useful Programs used:dvd decrypter and dvd shrink DVD burner: BenQ 1640 CD-R: 48X CD-ROM Access Time: 120ms CD-RW: 32X DVD+R: 16X DVD+R DL: 8X DVD+RW: 8X DVD-R: 16X DVD-ROM Access Time: 120ms DVD-RW: 6X computer: 750mb ram, 2.6 pentium, 40gb ibm drive.
could it be the hd?
i think it is my systems weakest link.
