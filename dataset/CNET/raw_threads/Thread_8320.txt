Anyways, I recently looked online for possible solutions and found out I can transfer a DVD Drive from one of my old computers into the burned out one. So I thought of my TOSHIBA Laptop. Then I started to think if it wouldnt work since laptops are compressed hardware and you cant upgrade them etc. So my question is; is it possible to extract my DVD Drive from my TOSHIBA Laptop and place in my Desktop Computer (Windows XP Professional Edition) If so please explain the steps. Thank you
