I am a novice and appreciate any help out there.
I use windows xp and have Roxio Easy CD Creator 5 basic.
It was working fine but I recently did some clean up and now I get a msg that says &quot;no spt CD recorder available&quot;.
I looked in control panel and it still shows Roxio Easy CD Creator loaded.
Thanks,
