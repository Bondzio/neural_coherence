just curious, what cpu (based upon the cpu's out there now) would run vista faster, better, etc?
an athlon fx(x2) or an intel core duo?
i am definitely not going with vista for at least a year or so after it's release, i know what the hardware requirements are now for vista and was just curious.
all opinions are respected and appreciated.
