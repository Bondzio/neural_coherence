<s> I purchased a external hard drive kit for a drive that was in my old computer. </s>
<s> When I pluged it in my new computer it was not given a letter even though it was listed in disk management. </s>
<s> I purchase Partition Magic8. </s>
<s> I was able to extract all in information but now I want to reformat so I can use it again. </s>
<s> When I tried to do it with PartitionMagic I got this error message...Error #109 partition ends after end of disk, UcEndCylinder (1247) must be less than 1247, Disk geometry errors. </s>
<s> I've tried to contact them but have had no responce for weeks now. </s>
<s> What operating system: XP, XP (SP1), XP (SP2), other? </s>
<s> What HD size or model number? </s>
<s> GOOGLE: partition magic 8 error messages Why not try DISK MANAGEMENT to repartition and format the HD. </s>

<s> Many thanks..I forgot to try Disc Mgmt. </s>
<s> I used it before to try and extract the infor but all it would let me do is delete the partition. </s>
<s> So once I got all the info out of it now I deleted it and now it gave me a letter. </s>
