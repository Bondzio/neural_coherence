it's part of a demo i setup to demo my software.
the one thing that wipes most out is they installed a firewall.
but you didn't note it so your issue may be elsewhere.
the machines were new so after windows update and installing the antivirus i selected a folder to share, set it to adhoc and rebooted.
the other machine i did the same and it asked if i wanted to connect to the adhoc network.
very easy and i can't see how a step by step would be needed.
but a firewall could squash this.
