<s> Hey guys, here is my issue. </s>
<s> One day out of the blue my HP computer decided to shut down on its own without warning. </s>
<s> Then when it went to reboot, it keep going in circles. </s>
<s> It would get to the windows welcoming screen and then suddenly restart. </s>
<s> And it keep doing this. </s>
<s> well I called the local repairman and he said my hard drive might be fried. </s>
<s> Long story short it wasn't. </s>
<s> Because we hooked it up to one of my older ACER computers and I was able to get all of my stuff off the hard drive. </s>
<s> Now, the problem is i reformatted the hard drive, however, it is still doing the continuous cycle of restarting. </s>
<s> shouldn't it stopped seeing how a reformatting is supposed to erase EVERYTHING. </s>
<s> I guess my question is how do I get windows seven on this crazy hard drive? </s>
<s> So I can put it back in my HP computer and get things working again. </s>
<s> You seem to forget that you re-entered the HD back into the PC and the problem returned. </s>
<s> it may not be the HD at all but the remaining part(s) of your PC. </s>
<s> If you had another HD, you could quickly see what the results are. </s>
<s> i suggest you get your hands on a Ubuntu bootable disc, made from using the live version of Ubuntu. </s>
<s> Get the .ISO file, burn it and make a disc. </s>
<s> Once done, enter your bios to verify the 1st boot device is the CD/DVD drive, save it before exiting. </s>
<s> Mount new Ubuntu disc and see how it reacts. </s>
<s> If there is a PC problem, then the remaining PC w/o the HD attached, should start to boot. </s>
<s> If not and it tries repeated boots, you know the PC is kaput in some way. </s>
<s> If you have warranty, use it as that maybe a way out as they suggest this or that. </s>
<s> Also, details do matter, telling you have a HP system provides few details. </s>
<s> tada ----Willy </s>
<s> Willy, You are so right. </s>
<s> I took the HD out of my old Acer and placed it in the HP computer and guess what?!! </s>
<s> Same problem. </s>
<s> I figured the MB on the HP computer was to blame and took everything out of it I could...ie dvd burners and some cables. </s>
<s> Thanks a lot!! </s>
<s> I will be calling HP explaining the problem. </s>
<s> thanks again. </s>
