Its okay to LOL cos I can take it! LOL! Okay, I have a 2.4P4 533FSB Northwood, I need a new motherboard. Does any motherboard accept this CPU if it states &quot;Supported CPU, CPU Socket Type Socket 478, CPU Type Intel Pentium 4/Celeron, FSB 800/533MHz, Supported CPU Technologies Hyper-Threading Technology&quot;? As you can see I dont have any clues about PC's. So go ahead and LOL im not watching! LMAO! Always LOST in space w/o my CNET buddies out there to save me! Brandon

Though plenty of socket 478s are still out there, putting one in a Dell case might be a problem. Is this the PC you are speaking of? If so, the task of replacing the MB becomes more complicated. As I said, socket 478s are plentyful. Most of these should support your processor if it's working ok. I won't offer specific recommendations as that depends much on what you want to do and what features you need. As for myself, I like ASUS boards.

11254	3	117581	1335814	1335527	itrust	8/2/05 9:55 AM	1.1229765E12	Hmmm.	Okay, my motherboard on my DELL is no good, so I want to buy a new one, a new case. So I was just wondering when I look for motherboards if it states supports 533FSB that it will work with my CPU. Btw, tks for the reply on which motherboard you like. Thats a plus my dear old bud!

It sounds as if your processor will work in any of a number of boards such as are offered at NewEgg as already suggested. You can plug your CPU information into their MB options and get lots of hits in lots of price ranges. Many are jumper free and will detect your CPU's capabilities and configure it for you. You might or might not be able to use the memory that's on your Dell. This is something else to consider. Make sure you get a board that's socket 478 and not 775. If you need a new case, get one with a power supply of 350w or higher. Some folks will recommend more but your processor should run ok at that wattage. Good luck.

Here's my thoughts however. It's best to keep questions inside the forums where someone with some knowledge of the problem can address them. My own competence is limited to specific areas or situations. Many others here are far more advanced or have expertise where I do not. When you pose a question, you may get lots of responses and not all will be of value. Sometimes subtopics break off. Browse the forums and just read about other folks problems and the suggested solutions. If you do enough of this, I can almost guarantee you will read about a problem you do not have now but will have in the future and BINGO!! you will already now how to handle it. Now, while I don't mind carrying certain conversations away from the forums, I think it's best to limit these. The forums can get cluttered by one way conversations and that might be a time to move to e-mail. But, for security reasons, I will not give out my personal address. If you want responses through the forums, you need to edit your profile to allow this.

Thanks to the couple of ppl that helped me out. I found everything that I needed. So thanks again. Btw, Steven trust me I wont e-mail 24/7 cos I dont often have problems with PC's to begin with. It was just this one. The reason why I asked you cos it might be so simple that its not worth posting on the forums. Plus I've been reading posts from this website, most of the time it goes off topic. Thanks again.
