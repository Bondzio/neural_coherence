9669	0	534919	5171969	NR	lucid oldie	7/23/11 2:31 AM	1.31138826E12	Is it my CPU or my motherboard?	System AMD tri core 720, Foxconn ADSA Motherboard. 500W Corsair PSU, Windows XP (Now Windows 7), ATI 4850. I tried overclocking 2 years ago, with Cool and Quiet enabled (idiot! ) and when rebooting got a blue screen of death. Since then two cores show as 2.8 MHz but the third core only shows as 2000 MHz. Missing 800MHz there. If I try to increase the frequency the other two cores frequencies go up in unison. Going up 100 MHz (eg 2100MHz core 1, 2900 MHz cores 2 and 3) causes the computer to shut down. Hyperthreading is not working. I am still using this computer (right now) but can someone with knowledge please advise if I need a new CPU or a new Motherboard or both, as I now want to fix this issue? Any other advise would be appreciated. Regards Roger

Sorry but I read many times that AMD uses cores and not Hyperthreading but &quot;True Core.&quot; http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;source=cnet&amp;q=amd+hyper+threading There are hints to AMD doing this in 2012 but what made you think this CPU has that?

I tried Foxconn support and their suggestion was to swap out the CPU with another CPU but I did not have another CPU to do this. I thought someone on the forum may have had a similar issue and could tell me how they resolved it. Regards Roger

The video card found this &quot;The maximum power consumption of the card is rated at 110 watts.&quot; For now I'd dismiss the MHz issue as a red herring. I've run into too many instances where the CPU clock speed is misread. In other words, not a good indication of anything. Since the FSB may play havoc with RAM and video cards and more, I wonder if it's off where it should be. --&gt; But wait, I really want the BIOS to AUTO-DETECT all those MHz settings. If not, it's just a bad BIOS (or motherboard if they don't issue a new BIOS.) Bob
