Go to My Computer &gt; Properties &gt; Advanced &gt; [Performance] Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Virtual memory and tell us what it says.
Also tell your total and free disc space from the properties of the drive the virtual memory is defined on (probably the c:-drive).
This will give a clear picture of the situation, so we can tell you what to do.
