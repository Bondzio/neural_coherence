<s> Forgive me, I am somewhat wedded to my old (10 years+) NEC multisync XV17+ CRT monitor; using it with a somewhat younger Dell Dimension desktop containing an outmoded video card and running Windows2000 and connected to WWW via verizon DSL. </s>
<s> It all needs replacing but Hoping to hang on long enough to skip VISTA and go straight to OS7 since all is working okay (if somewhat slow.) </s>
<s> The picture on this monitor is still superb. </s>
<s> But today I was trying to print an image of a painting that was on an auction website. </s>
<s> I think I right clicked and hit print and instead of printing the picture it started printing the whole document so in haste I just closed MS Explorer. </s>
<s> Since other windows were still open, I didn't notice any problem until later when shutting down, I discovered that the image of the painting was still hanging there in the middle of my screen...clear as day (not a shadow) on top of the background blue, but under the various icons on my desktop. </s>
<s> It won't go away. </s>
<s> This is not like monitor &quot;Burn in&quot;. </s>
<s> It does not show up in other programs. </s>
<s> The screen is normal in Outlook and Windows Explorer. </s>
<s> I have rebooted, I have degaussed, I have run ccleaner. </s>
<s> I have clicked on the picture itself but only get the ordinary desktop options. </s>
<s> It happens while this was going on my cable TV was also acting up and had a Time Warner tech online for that...when I explained what was happening to my computer monitor, he said it was probably a &quot;progressive scan&quot; problem and that if I ran another progressive scan it would go away. </s>
<s> No idea what this means...or how to do it. </s>
<s> Should I reopen the auction site and bring up that same picture again and then close the site down properly? </s>
<s> I'm sort of afraid to try this - don't ask me why. </s>
<s> Obviously don't want to go to a lot of trouble updating parts of this old setup when I only plan to keep for a couple months. </s>
<s> Also not sure what harm leaving the picture there would cause...since it doesn't seem to interfere with any of my programs - or my screensaver. </s>
<s> Thanks for any insight. </s>
<s> I hear you but it doesn't make sense to me. </s>
<s> So lets just call it &quot;weird&quot;. </s>
<s> Maybe it's time to get a new monitor. </s>
<s> Thanks for responding...and sorry for taking up so much space with this already archival episode. </s>
<s> My tech stopped by and fixed it in two minutes. </s>
<s> He said he didn't know how it happened...but this is a feature of &quot;display&quot; - i.e., you can put pictures deliberately on your desktop. </s>
<s> In the unlikely event this happens to anyone else...just go into display and somewhere on a drop down menu is a whole list of alterations. </s>
<s> Click [none] and voila - a clean blue slate. </s>
