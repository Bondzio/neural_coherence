I thought at first it might be because im using a belkin card, but i was able to connect to my neighbours who had netgear so that was not the problem. When i try to connect i type in my encryption passphrase and it tries to connect but then it fails, doesnt say any reason w hy. With my Iphone and Laptop i did not have a problem connecting to it. Thank you Have a nice day
