i just purchased a wd 120 gig usb hard drive.
the file system is fat 32 now but i am not sure if i should convert it to ntfs.
i plan on installing a complete backup of my desk top computer and my laptop which are both running xp home.
if i leave it fat 32 will this be possible?
is it possible to partition it and have some ntfs and some fat32?
thanks.
