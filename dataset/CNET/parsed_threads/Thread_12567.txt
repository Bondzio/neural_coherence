<s> My other mac 1.2GHz PowerPC G4 512 MB DDR SDRAM OS Z 10.4.11 Last night it had been closed and asleep. </s>
<s> On opening, it made a very loud noise (i was not there to hear it) very similar to either the normal sounds of the CD drive or the fan working overtime. </s>
<s> It did not wake up. </s>
<s> The CD drive is empty. </s>
<s> On re-booting, we get the grey screen with the spinning gear for a very long time and then the blue screen of death, which fades to slightly darker shade of blue after a few seconds. </s>
<s> None of the start-up shortcuts seem to make much difference. </s>
<s> &#8984;-Option-P-R followed by holding down the option key on restart led to the select startup disk prompt, but no further. </s>
<s> I have another, identical mac, but no cables. </s>
<s> This is a laptop? </s>
<s> An iBook G4 or a PowerBook G4 perhaps? </s>
<s> Take the OS X installation disk and try to boot from it. </s>
<s> Shut down the computer, restart and hold down the &quot;C&quot; key until you see the spinning gear. </s>
<s> Did it boot correctly? </s>
<s> If it will not boot from the disk, reboot and hold down the Option key until you see the Select Startup Disk prompt. </s>
<s> The Command-Option-P-R sequence is the correct way to zap the PRAM but all the keys must be held down at the same time. </s>
<s> If only the Option key is held down, you will get the select startup disk prompt. </s>
<s> If you have been running the computer, then you do have the cables necessary to run the other, identical, one. </s>
<s> I guess you mean that you do not have two power adapters. </s>
<s> Check for dust bunnies at the air vents. </s>
<s> Let us know how you get on P </s>
