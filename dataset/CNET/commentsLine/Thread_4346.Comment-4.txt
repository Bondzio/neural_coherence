thanks for the info, but as usual, i'm looking away from spendng a single penny on this, and really dont have the money to replace the drive.
ok, well i lied, i have the money currently but... dont wanna spend it on a dvd rom drive.... 16x dvd-rom that reads all formats: ~$40-45.
4x/2x/8x dvd+/-r drive that can make 1.4gb cds - $106 .... it dont seem worth buying the dvd rom... will save up for the dvd writer...
