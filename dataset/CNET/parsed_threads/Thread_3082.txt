<s> Graphics card: http://www1.sapphiretech.com/us/pr [...] p?gpid=280 I want to find out if I can connect the computer to an (old) tv via the graphics card's dvi i port. </s>
<s> Does the the dvi port support: a) component b) DVI-I RGB? </s>
<s> If yes to a) and/or b): The tv is old, 10 years or more. </s>
<s> It has 2 scart ports. </s>
<s> How do I determine whether the scart ports support a) component b) DVI-I RGB? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> I remember scart has a max resolution of 576i so there is so little gain that I'll just write don't bother. </s>

<s> I don't understand your answer. </s>
<s> So little gain, compared to what? </s>
<s> I don't want to know whether the tv can be a replacement for a computer monitor. </s>
<s> From an older computer that had tv out, I know that the reso- lution supported, is to low for that purpose. </s>
<s> But for watching movies and videos is was sufficient (800x600). </s>
<s> And that is my question, can I use the dvi port to connect to the tv scart port, and by that obtain the above purpose. </s>
<s> Still thanks for your effort. </s>
<s> Let's find a DVI to SCART cable. </s>
<s> But no one I know can verify if it works. </s>
<s> A quick search finds no such cable which verifies that you'll have to stick with known solutions like S video to SCART. </s>
