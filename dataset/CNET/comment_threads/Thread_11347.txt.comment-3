&gt;&gt;Set up some remote access like VNC or even Windows Remote Desktop and then you can access it from there.&lt;&lt; This is one option to access it.But how can I access it as http if it is feasible ?
&gt;&gt;it appears you forgot port 20&lt;&lt; Yes I did not configure that ,,,,Do i need to configure that as well ?
right now it is working without port 20 has been configured.
Thanks
