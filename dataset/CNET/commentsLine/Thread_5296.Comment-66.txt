when buying a new pc it's always good to have another source to compare what you are looking at and compare it to what is being offered elsewhere.
to that end let me recomend tigerdirect.com.
they have a wide variety of manufacturers and also have refurb units for sale.
their refurb units come with a warrenty and i have never gotten a bad deal with them even on refurb units.
often you can buy a refurb with more computing power or graphics capabilities then buying a brand new unit.
if you really have a restrictive budget a refurb might be the way to go.
the fact is if your are not able to update a computer's hardware you might be better off with a refurb unit what with the industry turning over technology at the rate they do.
anything you buy today may be obsolete 6 monts to 2 years down the road and it's a little bit easier to replace a computer if you didn't pay an arm and a leg to buy the current unit you have.
