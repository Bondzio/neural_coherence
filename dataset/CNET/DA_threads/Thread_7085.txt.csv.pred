1.5.1	In addition to the replies you received, you asked, &quot;Does CNet have site that gives this detailed info step by steP?&quot; Well, possibly here, http://www.gamespot.com/features/pc_workshop6/index.html (Gamespot is also a part of CNet Networks, Inc) CNet also offers a free on line course on: &quot;Build the Ultimate Gaming PC&quot; http://courses.help.com/sessions/overview.jsp?courseSessionId=2584	St

1.8.1	Hi Big Steve, Not that I know of, but really when it comes down to it, building a gaming PC and a PC not for gaming is the same.	St
1.8.2	A gaming PC is what everyone really wants to aspire to as they have all the top ingredients for a quality desktop PC.	St
1.8.3	If it wasn't for gaming, there wouldn't be much incentive to keep improving the high end efficiency of home computers.	St
1.8.4	All you have to do is follow the procedures for building a gaming PC to build a PC that is not specific for gaming.	St
1.8.5	Just reduce the Processor (CPU) speed, the amount of RAM MB, and type of graphics card (Video Card), if the cost is not in your range.	St
1.8.6	If the cost can be managed, then building a Gaming PC is excellent for a PC to surf the net efficiency, email, personal finance, and word processing.	St
1.8.7	Actually, unless you have a real interest in building, for your enjoyment the challenge, learning about details in a computer structure, satisfaction in bragging about building your own computer, experts agree that the cost is about the same for building yourself or buying one already built, especially now-a-days with the reasonable prices.	St
1.8.8	If all you want to do is what you say, then look in your newspaper ads for used computers for about $150-$200.	St
1.8.9	Still better look at the excellent bargains on the emachine.	St
1.8.10	Best Buy has one this week for $329.97 with 17&quot; flat screen CRT monitor, and color printer, that is powerful enough (2.66 GHz CPU with Celeron D Processor), 256 MB RAM, 60GB Hard Drive, Integrated Graphics, to handle more than what you require, and it is not considered a gaming machine, but will play many of the non high tech games.	St
1.8.11	Other sources for how to build...www.google.com...type in &quot;building a computer&quot; or words to that effect.	St
