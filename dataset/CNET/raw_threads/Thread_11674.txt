Unfortunately, my desktop is not modern and its motherboard doesn't have SATA port. Could I install my new HD into my desktop and still keep the old one? Thanks for your help. Victory.

Not easy to find same at a reasonable price. VAPCMD http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16816150021
