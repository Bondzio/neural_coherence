in my experience, the brand is of little issue.
look at warranty, tech support, and rma as your guiding point.
do not waste your time with 108mbps.
these are proprietary and do not bring anything of value to the table.
your access to the web is running at 5mbps at best.
54mb between computers is more than enough for anything you are about to do.
the router you purchase for office use is based on your budget.
it is a generally a good idea to buy a more robust unit, although i have many clients using the home routers in teir offices with no problems.
just make sure you have invoked the wpa-psk security features.
make sure your router is capable of handling voip.
you will kick yourself if you don't even though you might not even be thinking of switching yet.
i would advise against anything to do with pre-n even though belkin assures you that there will be a firmware upgrade once the standard is ratified.
this standard has not been fully ratified, and i would keep away from it.
good luck
