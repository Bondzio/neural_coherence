When I first plugged it into my motherboard, Windows XP popped up a message saying that the device was overdrawing power through the USB hookup and would not allow that port to send/ recieve info. I had used that port before with a USB port on my case and it worked fine. When I plugged it into another port on the motherboard it did the same thing. No drivers on XP would allow an install, and I could find nothing to help me anywhere! Can anyone help me????

To no avail. I will try to blow any dust off and try again, but I have repeatedly tried to unplug and plug the thing back in, again having no luck. Do you think that the power supply isnt puching enough, or would it be a motherboard problem? There is no power dongle on the reader unit.
