<s> I have a modified HP Pavilion 533w. </s>
<s> I think i have a S3 Trio32/64 video/graphics card, and around 512 ram, wondering if anyone could give me a few suggestions to help me out with upgrading, bare in mind though that i have little available cash to spend on it. </s>
<s> Any help would be wonderful, thanks. </s>
<s> http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/product?cc=us&lc=en&dlc=en&product=90862 I can only guess why this needs upgrading. </s>
<s> For now, read http://forums.cnet.com/7723-6122_102-510824.html and see where we avoided overclocking and found out why it ran slowly. </s>

<s> As for the comment of &quot;only guessing&quot; why i need to upgrade i am not sure if you are being sarcastic lol or if my system seems to have enough to run correctly. </s>
<s> All i can say about the link there is that i have a more or less bare system, i have gone through and deleted almost all of my programs that didn't have anything to do with web browsing or e-book reading, as for protection the only i have on my system is Spyware Doctor, and most often it is disabled, i scan my comp once a day then disable it. </s>
<s> It just seems that my computer is constantly dragging. </s>
<s> web browsing takes ages, bringing up any programs on my comp takes ages, i honestly don't know what to do, i am only ( and i mean on the second lowest rung of the ladder) mildly tech savy. </s>
<s> To avoid any other offenses, can I remove my reply? </s>
<s> You may want to repost your reply since it does tell more about the upgrade needs. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I'm not offended at all, relax. </s>
<s> hell i even tossed a &quot;lol&quot; in there, cause it made me chuckle when i read it. </s>
<s> I wouldn't care if you called me stupid and told me my comp was junk, i don't take offense to things online, plus you weren't offensive. </s>
<s> Just tell me when is in your mind for helping to remedy my dino comp problems. </s>
<s> Did you want to share the HIJACKTHIS log to see if you have any known conflicts? </s>
<s> As to upgrades, the usual is get 1.0GB RAM (see crucial.com) and pop in any 50 buck or less video card. </s>

<s> Turns out i don't need the info anymore, while trying to put in my reply to this on my desktop, it burned out completely, i think the mother board fried, but i am going to go and try to get a decent used one from a guy that builds cheap ones. </s>
<s> Sometimes these things have ears. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> What do you mean if burned up completely? </s>
<s> Did one component just good bad and it keeps system from loading? </s>
<s> What happens when you try to boot? </s>
<s> Keep in mind that if you are on a tight budget, it might be better to try to fix this system and have a few dollars left over to upgrade - say memory and video card - then to purchase another under powered system. </s>
<s> Regarding previous problem - did you check all the basic things first: 1. </s>
<s> Verfied the download issue was not with you ISP by testing internet speeds? </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Run a common system review program to check for issues - such as the free test at PC Pitstop? </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> De-fragmented hard drive 4. </s>
<s> GAve system - especially fans - a thorough cleaning 5. </s>
<s> Checked to see if any driver updates were available from Dell for system or the video card manufacturer? </s>
<s> 6. </s>
<s> Run another free anti-virus and anti-spyware program to see if you might have some infections missed by the first Beyond that the memory upgrade would definitely help - and the video card two. </s>
<s> That old card you are using is going to be a lot slower than todays integrated graphics. </s>
