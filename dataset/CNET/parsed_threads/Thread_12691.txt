<s> ok first off my pc was running fine until i added new motherboard and 2 4gb after installation pc started just fine but when i go to install some updates they fail. </s>
<s> also when get all types of error codes when installing disc based games and virtual iso games. </s>
<s> on occasion i get a blue screen of death but havnt got that since i installed windows 8. i even checked each memory stick by manually removing 1 byb 1 and testing each. </s>
<s> i have ran error fix programs driver programs and even ran programs to test my hardware everything checked out. </s>
<s> so my only conclusion is its my old ass proccesor. </s>
<s> if anyone could help it would be highly appreciated. </s>
<s> These are rarely legitimate and often carry trojans or more. </s>
<s> I read your post twice and found so little about the desktop that I can't comment except that the virtual iso games are quite the tip off that something isn't quite legit. </s>

<s> but these are isos i made and they worked way before i changed to the asrock motherboard and added the memory thats when i got the issues. </s>
<s> so it has to be a hardware problem with one of the 2 faulty motherboard im guessing cause i tried the mem sticks in another pc and they gave no issues </s>
<s> After installing the new motherboard, did you do a clean install of your OS again? </s>
<s> That's really recommended. </s>

<s> There are issues with Windows if you transplant it. </s>

<s> i have done clean swipe installation i have tested memory together and one by one. </s>
<s> if it helps my main problems are installing games and windows update seams to fail everytime. </s>
<s> my specs are ASRock G41m-s3 motherboard, dual core intel pentium e5200 cpu,4gb x 2 ddr3 elite memory, zotac geforce gt440 graphics card. </s>
<s> please any info or ideas will help. </s>
<s> before this started happening ? </s>
<s> Is this version of Win 8 a legitimate copy or is this os an install from a torrent? </s>
<s> What AV are you running ?Getting info here is like pulling teeth, the op doesn't wanna give any up . </s>
<s> yes the windows 8 is from a torrent share site but i had windows 7 legit and it was still giving problems before the installation of windows 8. windows 8 actually made it a little more stable. </s>
<s> as in having windows 7 i was getting bsod. </s>
<s> I'd start with a clean install of your good old legitimate Windows 7. </s>
<s> Install SP1, installl all updates, install antivirus and only install trusted applications. </s>
<s> If you still get BSOD's it's a hardware issue. </s>
<s> If everything is fine and you install other software and troubles begin, you know where to search for the cause. </s>
<s> And maybe even everything stays fine. </s>
