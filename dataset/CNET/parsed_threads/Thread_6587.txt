<s> How can I clean my plasma screen effectively without damaging it or my laptop? </s>
<s> Preferably without having to buy anything special. </s>
<s> Since I value my laptop screen, I purchased a few laptop screen wipes. </s>
<s> They have an antistatic feature so less dust builds up. </s>
<s> Well worth the 2 or 3 bucks. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Sound perfect, thanks for the info. </s>

<s> I have never seen or heard of a Plasma screen on a laptop, they normally use TFT or some equivalent. </s>
<s> I find that a soft damp cloth works just as well as anything else to clean one. </s>
<s> Never seen a static problem. </s>
<s> The screen surface and LCDs don't have such a big charge as CRT, but the laptop screen wipes are cheap and effective to keep &quot;fluffy&quot; from the screen surface... Bob </s>
<s> Sorry, you're right it is a TFT, I just always think they're plasma because of the ripple effect when you touch them. </s>
<s> The soft damp cloth worked like a dream, thanks. </s>
<s> And free as well I do have a cat Bob, but I don't usually have much trouble with static, only paws pressing random keys on my keyboard when I'm not watching. </s>
<s> Thanks again to the both of you. </s>
<s> Adi </s>
<s> Hope you don't mind a little more info on the subject...a few days late perhaps. </s>
<s> I think &quot;Klear Screen&quot; is the absolute best stuff on the market...Not just for laptop Screens but CRT's too! </s>
<s> Recommended by TechTV and a whole lot of other &quot;Geeks&quot;. </s>
<s> The stuff is amazing...smooth, non damaging, &quot;polished like&quot; finish. </s>
<s> Some &quot;wipes&quot;, (in particular Alcohol based) can be DAMAGING! </s>
<s> http://www.klearscreen.com/ And some very interesting FAQ's concerning the effects of using the wrong stuff... http://www.klearscreen.com/faq.html#Anchor </s>
<s> Although there are many ways to clean sensitive plastics the new and best way is to use tepid water and Ultramicrofibre towels. </s>
<s> They use no chemicals and remove all soils from the surface without abrasion. </s>
<s> They can be found using a search such as Ultra-microfibre or Microfibre towel. </s>
<s> They range in prices from $2.95 to $8.00 each. </s>
<s> In cleaning them use hot water and wring out tightly. </s>
<s> To remove tough soils put them in your washing machine &quot;alone&quot; and use a drop or two of Dawn or similiar with Hot water and Hot water rinse. </s>
<s> Don't dry them in the dryer! </s>
<s> They can be used in all types of cleaning while your cleaning your screen. </s>
<s> Though I sell them they can be found anywhere on the net and in cleaning supply stores. </s>
<s> You must use a manufacturer approved and tested product to avoid damage. </s>
<s> Read about Techniclean at WWW.techniclean.tv the worldwide best seller sutable for all screens including plasma. </s>
<s> Independant test results TechniClean: 3 Stars This other type of Computer Screen Cleaning Product, requires No Specific Cleaning Cloth. </s>
<s> You only need to Spray the Foaming Cleaner onto the Screen, and then use Any Soft, Clean Cloth to Wipe the Surface Clean. </s>
<s> Also, if you wish to Maintain a Clean Screen, then use TechniClean Regularly. </s>
<s> The Result will be, that after each time you Apply & Wipe the Screen Clean, you will Leave behind a Protective Coating. </s>
<s> TechniClean lasts about 3 Weeks before a New Application is Required Additional TechniClean Information ( Not Part of the Comparison - Translation ) TechniClean is also: Specially formulated for todays TFT LCD and Plasma Displays. </s>

<s> I use the Office Depot Screen Cleaner, but there are many others like this on the market. </s>
<s> They clean your screen and surely make a good job! </s>
<s> My screen is still clean after 10 days I used it on my notebook! </s>
<s> See ya! </s>
<s> Surely, anyone could have seen that. </s>
<s> Only a total idiot would have done it. </s>
<s> Use steelwool and press hard. </s>
<s> Really </s>
<s> This may sound highly irregular, but I use nappy liners in conjunction with diluted (one in ten) methylated spirits, and then use a chamois lens cloth to remove any fluff and clear any smudge marks. </s>
<s> Of course, one could always just buy a new laptop when the old one gets dirty which will also ensure your equipment is up to date and not getting obsolete </s>
<s> OK ... it would be clean, but a wire brush would be quicker, and oven cleaner would give it a better shine Obviously this cleaning process assumes that you want to clean the screen ... not use the screen again ;p </s>
<s> Make a one in ten dilution using one part methylated spirits and nine parts water. </s>
<s> Use a soft cloth dampened with the solution (important, damp ... not dripping wet). </s>
<s> I use nappy liners because they are cheap, soft and absorbant. </s>
<s> Afterwards I give a soft rub using a Chamois lens cloth to remove any lint, fluff or streaking and smudges. </s>
<s> The lens cloth is cheap and available from most opticician's or good camera shops. </s>
<s> A damp sponge also does the trick, but you could end up dripping water into the keyboard if you don't wring out the excess water properly ... so I find my solution above a better bet. </s>
<s> I liked your idea better than mine. </s>
<s> I have always liked the blue window cleaner spray. </s>
<s> Do not spray directly on the screen, but rather on a soft clean cotton cloth, e.g., a not entirely new t-shirt or dish towel. </s>
<s> Spraying directly on the screen may (1) be too strong a solution and (2) short out the connectors on the sides of the screen; don't so that. </s>
<s> In extreme circumstances (long flight or distant land) a little vodka on a cloth will do the trick. </s>
<s> It takes something a little stronger that water to remove oily fingerprints and smudges, and soaps leave a film. </s>
<s> Ok, I was wondering about this. </s>
<s> I just got a desktop PC with a TFT monitor and I just dusted it and the screen bleeds or something, is this normal and ok? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Use a damp cloth to clean the finger prints then use a softer cloth the dry those areas you cleaned. </s>
<s> Use a microfiber cloth afterwards to go over the whole tv. </s>
<s> I just did it and that is why I'm posting this. </s>
<s> but you can't use glass cleaner on a plasma screen. </s>
<s> It smears. </s>
<s> You have to use water. </s>
<s> How do I clean my plasma screen? </s>
<s> I have a 50&quot; plasma and 37&quot; LCD and the best thing to clean with is Microfiber Suede, soft and gentle. </s>
<s> You can buy some expensive versions, but I found a cheap source at www.eriecotton.com. </s>
<s> Large 16&quot; towel for about $4.00 a towel. </s>
<s> This product is a great polishing cloth, and I use it on my glasses too. </s>
<s> For plasma and Lcd cleaning I use it dry to dust and for smudges etc slightly damp and gentle wiping. </s>
<s> You people with the fantastic IQs really have to know not everyone is equipped with you know how. </s>
<s> Like developed mental people and others.. you promote a disaster and you will more than likely cause a disaster. </s>
<s> If your anything like those spectators that promoted that kid in chat online to kill himself, then your are a cold-hearted embarrassment to the Internet community. </s>
<s> P.E.R.I.O.D. </s>
<s> Wake Up!! </s>
<s> there really are people, kids, who would this, & you'll laugh.. of-course.. </s>
<s> My Panasonic manual says to use diluted detergent if it is really dirty. </s>
<s> After spilling beer on my TV screen, here is how I got it perfectly clean. </s>
<s> I took a new microfiber cloth, put a single drop of dish detergent on it, and then wrung it out in warm water. </s>
<s> I GENTLY went over the entire screen in a circular manner. </s>
<s> I then took a dry microfiber (actually kept 1/2 of the same cloth dry) and GENTLY wiped off the screen. </s>
<s> My last pass was a with a gently buffing motion. </s>
<s> Looks like new and I didn't have to buy any special cleaners. </s>
