<s> Well my son built a nice machine. </s>
<s> He had problems with a Seagate 250 gb SATA cuda drive crashing ,twice, a total meltdown. </s>
<s> He ended having to reformat, and reinstall WinXP, but lost all data. </s>
<s> So sent him another drive, a WD 250 gb SATA drive. </s>
<s> He set them up as RAID 1. </s>
<s> I thought his data woudl be &quot;protected&quot;. </s>
<s> (He is in college, and doesn't really have the time, or energy to trouble shoot, so I'm trying to help him out!) </s>
<s> Yesterday his drives crashed again, as he typed on it. </s>
<s> Well BOTH drives were totally unreadable. </s>
<s> No DIR, both drives. </s>
<s> Both registered as &quot;unformated.&quot; I thought it was the Seagate but now I'm not sure. </s>
<s> If it was just the Seagate, why would both drives, in RAID 1, crash at the same time. </s>
<s> Very odd, and very frustrating. </s>
<s> I bought him an external onetouch drive, for backup, reformatted, and reinstalled XP again. </s>
<s> This time we are using the WD as the boot drive. </s>
<s> I also disabled RAID. </s>
<s> I ordered a Seagate HD replacement, but I'm not really sure if it is the HD at all, the Mother board, the SATA drivers, XP glich, or what. </s>
<s> I know this is difficult question, but perhaps someone out there had a similar problem. </s>
<s> Any grey cell electrical energy you can throw my way will be appreciated! </s>
<s> HELP! </s>

<s> RAID Level 1: disk mirroring or duplexing would do just that. </s>
<s> Any error on the main drive will faithfully be copied onto the other drive. </s>
<s> I've been at this for 2 decades (plus) and never found RAID 1 to save anyone time, money or data. </s>
<s> Go figure. </s>
<s> Maybe next time something simply such as using one drive as a normal drive, then use ACRONIS or such to save a copy of the OS plus everything to the second drive as you see fit. </s>
<s> At least you have a copy that should not corrupt when the first drive and its OS messes up. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> in so many areas; however, I disagree with this post. </s>
<s> The statement that ''any error on the main drive will faithfully be copied onto the other drive'' is not correct for a true RAID 1 configuration. </s>
<s> First, there is not really a ''main'' drive; the two drives are essentially peers. </s>
<s> Second, data are not normally ''copied'' from one drive to the other; data are written simultaneously to both drives from the original source. </s>
<s> If an error appears on both drives, the fault is likely in the software/hardware preparing the data for writing, including a possible problem in the RAID controller; if the error is on only one drive, it could be a bad disk sector, a disk writing error, or a RAID controller error. </s>
<s> I don't know; perhaps there is some system, likely software driven, that does write to one drive and then copies it to another. </s>
<s> However, this is not a true RAID configuration, which is hardware driven, but merely a software emulation. </s>
<s> This certainly isfeasable, it would be cheaper, and it sounds like what you describe. </s>
<s> But it is not true RAID. </s>
<s> RAID has been in general use for only about 15 years -- about a third of my time with computers. </s>
<s> During that time I have seen several instances where RAID did save time, data, and therefore money. </s>
<s> The most recent was early this year when we had a disk error on our old local server. </s>
<s> Fortunately, it was not a real disk crash, just a write error. </s>
<s> I was able to restore the data on the ''bad'' drive from the ''good'' drive (this is where copying is used)in a matter of minutes. </s>
<s> Had the error occured on a single drive it might have taken me hours -- especially since the Novell OS is on these drives. </s>
<s> So you go figure. </s>
<s> (Of course, this incident didn't save anyone money; I am a volunteer, so my time cost is zero.) </s>
<s> If RAID were as useless as you imply, why do almost all servers use some RAID configuration? </s>
<s> Most new servers have hot-swappable drives so that in the event of a total disk crash, a new drive can be popped in, data copied to it, and the system back in operation in a very short time. </s>
<s> I have RAID 1 for important data on my main system at home. </s>
<s> True, it may never save me any time -- mainly because I am in my eighties and quite possibly will not make it until a bad problem occurs. </s>
<s> However, having it makes me feel a little more secure in case of an early failure or a late death, and I consider the roughly $150 I have invested in it to be well worth while. </s>
<s> Frank </s>
<s> You've repeated the exact reason why RAID 1 rarely saves the day. </s>
<s> &quot;First, there is not really a ''main'' drive; the two drives are essentially peers. </s>
<s> Second, data are not normally ''copied'' from one drive to the other; data are written simultaneously to both drives from the original source.&quot; Bingo. </s>
<s> Two corrupted drives for the price of one. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> You say ''Bingo. </s>
<s> Two corrupted drives for the price of one.'' </s>
<s> Only in certain cases, which I pointed out, but not the majority of the time. </s>
<s> And the corruption is to the same data -- no differeence than had that data been on a single drive, and no difference in recovering it. </s>
<s> As I said, if the data is corrupted before the write process, it naturally will be corrupt on both drives. </s>
<s> However , if an error occurs during the actual process of writing to a drive -- and you know this does sometimes happen -- the data will be corrupt only on that drive, but not on the other one. </s>
<s> I cited as an example this very thing happening to me earlier this year on our server. </s>
<s> Another important aspect of RAID 1 is the protection in event of a complete disk failure -- perhaps a menchanical crash or a fried circuit board; this almost always involves only one drive of the pair. </s>
<s> Now, instead of sending your one drive off for data recovery at a cost of several hundred dollars, you simply install the new drive, restore from the mirror, and you are back in business in a short time. </s>
<s> You may say that you can accomplish this with Acronis True Image, Norton Ghost, or some other software. </s>
<s> True, but you must make an effort to do it, and there is a lag in data of hours or days, depending on your schedule of backups. </s>
<s> I am not saying you do not need separate backups if you have raid; you most certainly do. </s>
<s> You need the protection in case both drives become corrupt or inoperable (perhaps a direct lightning strike, a fire, or some other disaster), and you do need off-site storage for important data. </s>
<s> But when only one of the drives fails, the more common situation, it generally is much faster and easier to restore the system from a RAID mirror than from a drive image on some other media, and it also is up to the minute. </s>
<s> You are never worse off with RAID 1 configuration than with a single drive, and you may be much better off in event of a disaster. </s>
<s> But as you said, it is your data and your call. </s>
<s> If you don't want the extra protection and convenience, so be it -- no one will force it on you. </s>
<s> Nuff said Frank </s>
<s> How can I guess this one? </s>
<s> It's been 20 years plus of too many tales of sorrow yet RAID 1 never paid off. </s>
<s> -&gt; You can write all you want but time after time I have to help people recover from disasters where this setup does not payoff. </s>
<s> Yes, I read your post. </s>
<s> Now let's talk reality. </s>
