<s> I have lenovo T60 type laptop with windows xp pro and i had installed 2gb + 1 gb RAM in to that it was detecting till the laptop got reimaged. </s>
<s> After reimaging , it detect only 2 GB, not sure why so? </s>
<s> Do you guys have any idea of this? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Back to crucial.com and I find this laptop (you check yours!) </s>
<s> has a 2.0GB limit. </s>
<s> Your post is light on details so I can not check for you, you didn't tell what the BIOS reports or if you looked as WINDOWS which can mis-report ram. </s>
<s> You said it got re-imaged. </s>
<s> Did you take it or send it somewhere to have this done? </s>
<s> Was it giving you problems that might have been related to RAM? </s>
<s> If you took it somewhere or sent it away, did you pop the cover from the bottom that covers the memory slot to see if the RAM was still there? </s>
<s> If it is, maybe you could reseat it. </s>
<s> Just a thought. </s>
