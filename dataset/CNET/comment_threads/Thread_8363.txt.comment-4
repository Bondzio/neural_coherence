This is the surest way to assure that you get everything you asked for.
MS Office is available and since it's Windows 8 Pro, you should be able to run Windows Office 2003 to today's current version as well as the free LibreOffice.
Can you define document sharing?
Here I just put my docs and such on dropbox and can access them on all my machines.
To me that's document sharing.
