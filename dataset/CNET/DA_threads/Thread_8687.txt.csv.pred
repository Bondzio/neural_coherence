1.1.3	Please answer my question if you know and if it does n't , please tell me any programs that you know it works with .	Sug

1.2.1	Note # 2 : For the Dazzle DVC 80 , DVC 150 and Fusion , these drivers are specifically designed work with Pinnacle '' s Studio and Studio QuickStart software and they are not intended to work with other video editing applications and have not been tested with other applications .	St
1.2.2	It does n't list the DVC-100 anywhere in the downloads area ; however , I would think that perhaps the 150 USB drivers would work if the 100 is also USB .	St
1.2.3	I 've used my Dazzle DVC-150 with other video capturing programs , such as Power VCR-DVD II and even my ATI AIW software as well as the Studio 8 programs that came with the device .	St
1.2.4	I preferred Power VCR-DVD over all of them .	St
1.2.5	TONI	St
