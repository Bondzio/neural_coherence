1.1.1	I recently began to put together a PC for a friend of mine.	St
1.1.2	All parts were brand new although they were all purchased from seperate vendors.	St
1.1.3	I used an AsRock MB (maybe my first mistake) only because it was economical and I built a PC on one earler this year without a problem.	St
1.1.4	Everything seemed to go alright except for some reason it doesn't seem to want to boot when all my IDE components are hooked up (2 Maxtor HD's and Sony DVD-RW drive).	St
1.1.5	The fans spin but it refuses to boot.	St
1.1.6	The only way I could boot it was to hit the power with the DVD Drive not connected and then quickly plug it in before the bootstrap.	St
1.1.7	If I do this the BIOS will read the drive perfectly.	St
1.1.8	I went ahead and installed the OS (XP) and setup the computer as if nothing was wrong.	St
1.1.9	Any warm boots return without a problem but a cold boot takes me back to square one (fans spin, no POST) and I have to unplug the DVD drive to start it again.	St
1.1.10	I tried a few other drives and cables however I received the same result.	St
1.1.11	Unfortunately, once in a while, if I unhook the DVD drive it still doesn't boot.	St
1.1.12	I'm forced to also unhook the slave HD before I can get a boot.	St
1.1.13	This drive isn't as stubborn however as if I turn the computer off and on a few times I can generally get the computer to POST whereas with the DVD drive i've never been that lucky.	St
1.1.14	I don't know what's up, it's like the BIOS is unable to &quot;save&quot; the drive specs.	St
1.1.15	Bad IDE controller?	St
1.1.16	Defective board?	St
1.1.17	Any ideas would be appreciated.	St
1.1.18	Drives are set up as master/slave.	St
1.1.19	HD's are set into IDE 0 as primary master/slave.	St
1.1.20	DVD-RW Drive is set to primary master on IDE 1.	St
1.1.21	Power supply is a brand new Altec 430.	St
1.1.22	I'm not sure about the IDE setup although I would assume if one was set to off then the DVD drive would fail to run at all.	Res

1.2.1	&quot;HD's are set into IDE 0 as primary master/slave.&quot; If I see 80 conductor cables, I use CABLE SELECT.	St

1.3.1	Good info here.	Sug
1.3.2	John http://www.build-your-own-computer-tips.com/index.html	St
1.4.1	can't support the inrush and locked rotor currents at startup.	St
1.4.2	It will sometimes start after multiple tries because the capacitors got partially charged in the earlier tries and the charge has not bled off, thus the capacitor charging inrush is reduced enough to let the supply stay up.	St
1.4.3	The power supply has overcurrent protection circuits which shut down when too much currenbt is detected.	St
1.4.4	Some new video cards have given some supplies problems with this.	St
1.5.1	Do you have you hard drives properly pinned for primary and slave?	St
1.5.2	If not properly pinned, the problem you are discribing could occur.	St
