ok, thanks willy!
so for now you'd recommend just going with a regular vga connection and maybe considering a laptop with a dvi/hdmi output for the future?
is there anything i need to know about vga cables?
what's the deal with the cable that claims that it's only for 17 inch and smaller displays?
will it look distorted/pixelated on my 46&quot; and if so, what do i need to look for in a vga cable?
