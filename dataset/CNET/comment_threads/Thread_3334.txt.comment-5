Sounds like your a professional, If i understand you correctly, you can log any web address to your server.
Is there a way for someone to circumvent you recoding this to your server, say by a proxy server?
I am only trying to keep my audits confidential.
These audits can affect how my client(s) views this company for future business both positive and negative.
As in the previous post audits are performed by an online database accessible only thru IE8.
