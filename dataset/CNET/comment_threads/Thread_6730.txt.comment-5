If anyone else is reading this, all I need is help or a link to search for help.
Obviously, I have not found any of the &quot;widely documented&quot; web content.
My question is very simple, how do I set up a password protected shared folder in win xp.
Win 98 was very simple but I can't figure out xp.
I have spent a week surfing the web and finding several decent sites, however, information for setting the password is either nonexistent or requires the complicated creation of another user (2 users on the same computer) for file sharing and access.
I have been simple sharing for a while but my new situation has me somewhat vulnerable to easy access by strangers.
I can not change this, therefore, I would like to set passwords on the folders I share.
Thank you
