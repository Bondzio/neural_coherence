If the drive fits in there snugly, dispense with attempting to put the screws back in.
Just remember not to carry the enclosure around with the nose pointing down.
If it is to spend its life sitting on a desk, it will be fine and will function as designed without the screws.
I still think they sent you the wrong thing, the DVD drive, in the first place.
Good luck P
