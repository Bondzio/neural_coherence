i recently purchased the new hp photosmart pro b8850 from hp.
it is working great for my invitation business.
it handles heavy card stock, it has large ink tanks, it doesn't curl the card stock, it handles a variety of paper types and weights, and the ink doesn't smear!
this is the 6th printer that i have purchased and i think i am finally satisfied!
