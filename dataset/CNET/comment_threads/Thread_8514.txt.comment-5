so everything is wireless...
Does it have to be?
Is any system in the same room as your cable modem and router?
If so, use an ethernet cable for that one.
Now you've reduced the load on the wireless by one/however-many.
You might even consider upgrading all your equipment to one of the pre-N or super-G boosted speeds (for which ALL equipment needs to be the same brand and compatibility for the full throughput to be realized), but now we're talking bucks... Glad to help you understand it all better.
