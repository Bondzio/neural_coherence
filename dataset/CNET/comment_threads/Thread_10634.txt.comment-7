I have a Samsung Katalyst (Wifi) with T-Mobile...worked great until I got FIOS installed the other day.
I worked for hours...finally I did connect my Linksys as a secondary wireless through the LAN on the Actiontec Router....I did get closer to fixing the problem.....But now when I call out connected through the router...they can hear me...but I can't hear them on the phone.
My son however, can send and receive texts.
I'm sure our problems are quite similar.
Did you ever get your system to work correctly?
