<s> I have an ECS P45T-A with E8400 and 4GB Gskill DDR2 800 kit (2x2gb 5-5-5-15 @1.9V) running vista 64 hp sp1. </s>
<s> If I run both sticks of ram in it, it crashes randomly after about 10 min in windows or before boot. </s>
<s> I have troubleshooted using either stick of ram alone and they will run 100% stable for days using only 1 chip in any memory slot. </s>
<s> This sounds like a mb issue to me what do you guys think? </s>
<s> Please let me have some tips, Thanks Brian </s>
<s> I fixed one like that last month. </s>
<s> The owner didn't take the free advice to put two more drops of heatsink compound on the CPU. </s>
<s> They gave up and I did it for the 50 buck minimum charge. </s>
<s> They were not happy. </s>
<s> I'm unsure why some don't try the easy stuff first. </s>
<s> There is also an issue with memory, bios, timings and more but I will not write more than that here. </s>
<s> It's far too deep and in short a warranty+support problem. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Well thank you for the quick reply. </s>
<s> I know mine isnt a heat issue because I have played games on it for weeks and 0 crashes with either memory chip. </s>
<s> About the bios and mem timings I have mine all on default right now which is 5 5 5 15 1.9v. </s>
<s> It's the same as theirs. </s>
<s> They &quot;knew&quot; it wasn't that. </s>
<s> And found it ran with one stick so it couldn't be &quot;that.&quot; Shop counters thrive on such issues. </s>
<s> Let's not let them have the easy ones. </s>
<s> Or at least be sure about that. </s>
<s> Again, the details in your post are not there for me to look into the other area of BIOS, memory timings and more. </s>
<s> But you can research that on your own. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> i assume you're using the 06/19/2008 bios. </s>
<s> are you manually setting the timings to match the stick or just letting the mobo use it's defaults? </s>
<s> also, are you using the same bank of dimm slots? </s>
<s> first, manually set the ram for ddr2-667 and confirm it's stable. </s>
<s> if it's not, the mobo is probably bad. </s>
<s> also try populating the two slots closest to the cpu (one orange, one yellow) and sticking with the mobo default memory settings. </s>
<s> if you try to use all 4gb in one bank (both sticks in the orange slots), you may have to boost the memory voltage to 1.95v or 2.0v. </s>
<s> if neither of these works, you may want to consider swapping ram to a memory brand that's been qualified by ecs (mushkin's a great brand but ecs may not allow an rma using their ram). </s>

<s> Excellent ideas thank you much ramarc. </s>
<s> I have not updated my bios, I will look into that. </s>
<s> And I'm going to try the 667mhz setting. </s>
<s> Much for me to look at now I'll get back to post on progress, crossing fingers. </s>
