1.1.7	Thanks .	Polite
1.1.8	stoaster @ aol.com	St
1.2.1	Did you install the latest motherboard drivers as well ?	Ques
1.2.2	Many devices will not work properly until you do .	St
1.3.1	Test this in SAFE MODE .	St
1.3.2	SAFE MODE will set the video to 640x480 and you 'll be able to find your way to the Control Panel , or Display Properties to set the display to 640x480 256 colors and then OK your way out .	St
1.3.3	Reboot normally , and if the display shows , go to the display panel and select your preferred settings .	St
1.3.4	Bob	St
1.4.1	I ca n't get to safe mode at all .	St
1.4.2	I get no video .	St
1.4.3	I can hear the HD doing its thing , going thru post etc .	St
1.4.4	I dont get the beeps associated with no video card .	St
1.4.5	But I have taken the card out and run with nothing , I get the beeps then .	St
1.4.6	Additionally , I changed the jumper to reset the CMOS and booted that way with no results .	St
1.4.7	I have tried booting to a bootable floppy , but still no video , although you can tell it reads the disk goes thru the commands and waits at the command prompt .	St
1.4.8	Thanks for your help .	Polite
1.5.1	I installed the new MB drivers first , when WIN98 asked for them as finding new hardware .	St
1.5.2	I got all of them installed ( no new hardware found on boot ) , then decided to update video drivers from CDROM .	St
1.5.3	Everything went fine , then advised I must reboot , so I did .	St
1.5.4	Then no video .	St
1.5.5	It does POST and continue , but no video at all , not even showing CMOS etc .	St
1.5.6	Thanks for your help .	Polite
1.6.1	& quot ; Then no video .	St
1.6.2	It does POST and continue , but no video at all , not even showing CMOS etc .	St
1.6.3	Thanks for your help. & quot ; Then it 's time to try a DOS boot disk to see if the video card has outright failed .	St
1.6.4	Bob	St
1.7.1	.	St
1.8.1	I have removed and re-installed ( 2 ) different AGP cards and ( 1 ) PCI card , making sure to seat them all the way into the slot .	St
1.8.2	Any more suggestions ?	Ques
1.8.3	Thanks .	Polite
1.9.1	At this point you test that the CRT or display is functioning with another machine .	St
1.9.2	If multiple display cards fail to show any BIOS screen , then the list of failures starts to shrink : 1 .	St
1.9.3	The BIOS settings clear jumper is in the wrong position .	St
1.9.4	2 .	St
1.9.5	The CMOS battery is low , dead .	St
1.9.6	3 .	St
1.9.7	A cable of other connection is stopping the bootup to the BIOS screen .	St
1.9.8	It was not fun to find a motherboard manual that showed the HD LED to be on J11 , but J11 turned out to be the RESET .	St
1.9.9	Fortunately the motherboard markings were correct .	St
1.9.10	After you ponder the above , then you have to decide if the machine is dead and now you get to find the dead part .	St
1.9.11	You also have to tell the forum if you are willing to take the machine down to power supply , CPU/HeatSinkFan ( HSF ) , one memory stick and test it our on a cardboard square .	St
1.9.12	You also may have to replace some major part like a motherboard or CPU .	St
1.9.13	Before you start all this , can you revert to what worked or can you put it back to as-supplied and use your warranty ?	Ques
1.9.14	Bob	St

1.11.1	Thanks for suggestions .	St
1.11.2	I have removed all other cards ( just modem ) .	St
1.11.3	I will try the CMOS reset again , then pull everything and start over .	St
