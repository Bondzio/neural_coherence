i am planning on upgrading my pc, and need to know what i would need to be able to use it as a dvr, preferably with hd capability.
i have digital cable (comcast) coming into the house.
the current pc configuration is old!!!!!
and slow.
about the only thing i may be able to salvage is the keyboard and case/powersupply.
i am currently running an old asus motherboard with an amd athlon 800 mhz cpu with 512 mb ram and xp-pro.
i have a generic 256mb graphics card with no tv reception.
i built this computer years ago as a project just to see if i could do it.
now i want more!
i was thinking a 2ghz processor, a gig of ram, and an lcd monitor would do the trick.
i have a small 60gb hdd, and i suppose i will have to increase that too.
i would like to be able to record from the cable line (or digital box if necessary) onto the hard drive and then transfer to dvd, if possible.
i know a little about assembling a computer(enough to be dangerous), and i'm not afraid to try things, but i know very little about video.
any specific suggestions on hardware would be appreciated(i.e.
motherboard/cpu combo, video capture card, dvd recorder, etc).
brezzio
