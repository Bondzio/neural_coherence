i recently bought a refurbished computer (hp m1270n) it seems to be louder then what i'm used to ( i had a compaq deskpro 233mhz.
when the computer starts up and when i open programs the hard drive grinds.
(its hard to describe) i'm not sure if this is common with this pc or not.
is this something to be concerned about.
is there any kind of checks that i can do?
i do have warranty on the machine but i thought i would see what others thought.
could this be a problem?
