I have an older Netgear WGR614 Wireless Router that I would like to setup as a wireless bridge to use in another room to connect my other electronics to (i.e tv, blu-ray, Wii).I would appreciate any help on how to accomplish this.Thanks in advance....Phil

I don't duplicate prior discussions so let's find out what step was not possible. Bob

But your reply didn't answer my question. The setup is noted on some web pages so that's known. But what isn't known is the step that you stopped at. Bob
