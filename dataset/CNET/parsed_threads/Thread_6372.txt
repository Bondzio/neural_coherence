<s> I have a a fantom 120 gig external HD that is mac formatted. </s>
<s> I plugged it in via FW400 to my pc, but it doesn't show up in My Computer. </s>
<s> It is recognized as a volume in the safely remove hardware section, but won't give me access to the files. </s>
<s> I've tried updating drivers etc via the Device Manager to no avail. </s>
<s> How can I get my external hd/music back? </s>
<s> BTW, I'm running Windows XP pro. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> Back to the Mac and copy the files over to a NTFS or FAT32 file system for now or boot Linux and use Fuse. </s>
