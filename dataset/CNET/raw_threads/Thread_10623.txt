It worked fine for the past month and all of a sudden, it started turning itself off as if someone has pressed the off button. When I turn it back on, it asks me if I want to reboot in safe mode. I've recently tried installing a new printer but the same issue occurs when I have unplugged my printer. It does the same thing whether it's actively being used or being left unattended. I don't think it's an overheating issue because it's located in a relatively cold room. Thanks

It asks me to either start windows normally or restore. When I choose start windows normally, the window logos shows up and then it freezes. When I choose restore, it loads the file and when it's completed, it freezes. My guess is that it's probably a driver issue with the new drive updates that I recently installed. Am I correct?
