i have a 1.1 duron.
i would like to upgrade to a 2.8 athlon xp :  my motherboard manual says: support socket a (462 pins) for amd athlon, athlon xp, duron.
would it be ok to buy this processor and fit it?
would i need a cooler?
if so what kind?
i would like to buy 512mb of kingstom ram to put into my other slot.
would it be compatible with my old ram?
also it will be a pc3200 and my motherboard only says compatible with pc1600/pc2100.
would this be ok?
i know it's a lot of questions, but i would be very grateful it someone could help.
thanks!
