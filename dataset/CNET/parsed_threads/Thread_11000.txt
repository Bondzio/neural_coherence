<s> We own a business that tapes auditions for actors. </s>
<s> We tape on a Canon Vixia HF-10 onto an SD card and the format is AVCHD. </s>
<s> I am looking for a low cost way to take the chip out, put it into a netbook, view them, and then upload the videos they want to our secure server. </s>
<s> No need to edit the clips. </s>
<s> After scouring online, I discovered the new Lenovo S12 comes equipped with the Ion Nvidia graphics engine. </s>
<s> Is that the best option? </s>
<s> Or will an Asus eee be able to handle that? </s>
<s> I am a Mac person, so I know nothing about Windows based machines. </s>
<s> Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Play the clip from the camcorder to some HDTV. </s>
<s> This sidesteps all the issues of playback on a netbook. </s>
<s> And if you ask if it will play, it might but only YOU can tell by testing it. </s>
<s> I know I could use a video converter (I use Super) to make it into something playable but if we skip the netbook for playback we now have a cheap uploader. </s>

<s> Good call. </s>
<s> I will go to Best Buy and try out a few netbooks. </s>
<s> Linking the Canon HF10 to an HDTV is the easiest but we don't have one at the office. </s>
<s> Currently, we are using a Macbook Pro. </s>
<s> This machine will not be avail to us soon. </s>
<s> The MB Pro plays the clips fine through iMovie (compressed of course). </s>
<s> To focus my question more, we need the same out of a netbook. </s>
<s> Just wasn't sure which one. </s>
<s> I'll test it on your average Acer netbook. </s>
<s> Especially coming from a MB Pro, I fear you'll be disappointed and annoyed with trying to netbook for this kind of work. </s>
