basically, i want to build a pc that will be a great station for me to improve my skills with 3d softwares on, mainly maya/3dmax.
i use photoshop and painter as well, but i'm certain i won't have problems running those.
i figure quadros are for professionals who are making money through 3d design, so i wouldn't need a $1,600 quardo card, but i'm wondering if a lower end quadro would be better for learning on than a high end geforce.
