Not to be picking on you but really, &quot;would you honor a warranty that's 1 yr. out of date&quot;?
Most companies would pretty much give you the same answer, no.
If you like verify any warranty policy on the next LCD monitor and if offered see if an &quot;extended warranty&quot; is worth your time and possible added cost.
good luck tada -----Willy
