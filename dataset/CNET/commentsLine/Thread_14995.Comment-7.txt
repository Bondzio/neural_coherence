but, the separate cases and psus seem to work out (much) more expensive, and the bundled antecs at my local suppliers seem to come with the &quot;earthwatts&quot; psus but the separate ones don't seem to be those ones.
i wanted to get the earthwatts one, as i gather they are the energy efficient type.
i think i've pretty much decided what to get (although i'll probably change my mind again lol) thanks for the help.
