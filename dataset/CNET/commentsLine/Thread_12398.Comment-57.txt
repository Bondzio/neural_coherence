yes, it duplexes smaller sizes too.
it prints one side and then pulls it back in and prints the second side.
i've only used the duplexing feature using full letter sized paper for programs, but i just tested it out and it worked fine on smaller sizes.
i bought mine at a local xerox dealer in massachusetts.
if you're in that area, reply and i can tell you where specifically.
they were great about customer service so far - he had me meet with the xerox tech and i spent hours (3 separate visits) testing out my actual designs with my papers to see if it would be right for me.
they were great.
i don't know about support after the fact unless you buy the exteneded warranty, which i have to decide if i want.
they stocked it, so i was able to take it home in my car, with no shipping charges.
they also sell the ink at the lowest price i've found (same as xerox) for the genuine ink.
i don't want to risk the fake stuff.
