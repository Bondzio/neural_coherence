1.1.1	My new system I built has a Shuttle AN35N Ultra 400 system board with an AMD 2400+ processor, 2 Gig speed.	St
1.1.2	After getting it running I noticed in Device Manager the processor was shown as AMD 1800+ with a 1.4 Gig processor.	St
1.1.3	After a phone call to the store where I bought it I changed the FSB from 100 MHz to 133 MHz, and the listing went to 2400+, speed 2.0 Gig.	St
1.1.4	Now it's showing correctly, running like a top.	St
1.1.5	Can overclocking be this simple?	St
1.1.6	Change the FSB speed?	St
1.1.7	Not that I want to experiment, but if the FSB speed is increased, will the processor speed increase?	St
1.1.8	I do have more options.	St
1.1.9	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	and then you get to fool with voltages, and then with...	St
1.2.2	The AMD 2400+ should have been set to &quot;factory specs&quot; of Multiplier of 15, FSB 133 and voltage 1.65 in the first place though.	St
1.2.3	With the 100 Mhz you were underclocking yours.	St
1.2.4	http://www.computing.net/cpus/wwwboard/forum/8145.html Play around with it (if you fry it they are pretty cheap).	St
1.2.5	Stability and longevity of components is a good reason to not OC but realistically you are likely not going to keep the same system long enough to allow that to make much difference.	St
1.2.6	Had a Pentium Pro 200 that I ran at 266 for three years without problem and a Pentium Pro 166 that I clocked to 233 that gave up the ghost after about 4 months.	St
1.3.1	Thanks, interesting site.	Polite
1.3.2	I left everything at default, the only thing I changed was the clock in the BIOS, and the FSB setting.	St
1.3.3	I may try to play around with it later on.	St
1.3.4	Wayne	St
1.4.1	Wayne: I have had the 2400+ for 15 months now.	St
1.4.2	When I put it together I set the bus at 136 and it runs at 2045, at 137 it goes to 2061 and 138 it runs at 2076.	St
1.4.3	If I go above 138 bus it is not stable.......need a bigger PS.	St
1.5.1	At the speeds we are talking about, performance gain is minimal.	St
1.5.2	If you got $ to throw away, donate to charity.	St
1.5.3	I feel it is more of a &quot;bragging&quot; thing.	St
1.5.4	Oooooo your 2ghz runs at 2.05ghz....WOW!	St
1.6.1	I agree completely.	Res
1.6.2	If I could overclock it to 3 Gig it might be worth it.	St
1.6.3	But it replaced my 1 Gig machine.	St
1.6.4	There is a difference.	St
