<s> when I turn on my PC, I get a black screen with the following message: systems' battery voltage is low press F1 to continue, press F2 to enter the setup menu what am I best to do? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> By PC, I will assume that you mean desktop pc. </s>
<s> The only battery that I'm aware of on a pc is the cmos battery on the motherboard. </s>
<s> It's the shiny round object,about the size of a quarter, usually held in by some type of spring, on the motherboard. </s>
<s> Carefully remove the old battery, being careful not to bend or damage the spring or clip. </s>
<s> Take it to your nearest computer store, (Best Buy, Circuit City, or other) to get a replacement. </s>
<s> Do replace the bios battery. </s>
<s> Before doing so, enter the bios area and make notes of what the setting are. </s>
<s> Check your manual or upon boot-up if displayed what the &quot;bios key sequence&quot; is required to enter the bios area. </s>
<s> Understand, once you replace the battery in all likeyhood, the bios will reset to default values, thus the reason note down what the previous values were. </s>
<s> It should make sense once you delve into this. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
