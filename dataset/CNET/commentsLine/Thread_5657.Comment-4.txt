the asus maximus extreme uses the intel x38 chipset and only supports crossfire with ati/amd cards.
nvidia sli requires a mobo based on an nvidia chipset.
there are hacked nvidia drivers that will enable sli on non-nvidia chipsets, but i don't recommend that route.
if you $280 won't fit in your budget, then get a geforce 9600gt (about $150).
they're faster than an hd 3850 or hd 3870.
