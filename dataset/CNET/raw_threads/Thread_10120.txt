I have a budget limit of $1050 and have run into a few questions regarding motherboard and case. I will supply my own operating system, keyboard, mouse and screen. The general build goes as follows: CPU - Ivy Bridge Intel i5 3570k RAM - 8gb DDR3 1333MHz HDD - 1gb SATA III Hard Drive Motherboard - B75M Pro OR for $50 more 4th Gen Z77 Pro DVDRW - Generic Case - Generic with 2 USB ports at the front OR Thermaltake V3 for $30 or V4 for $55 GPU - 1G GTX 660 Power supply - Generic 850W Here is the link - http://tinyurl.com/au4yacq

I'll copy it again here. &quot;Our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a $225 LGA 1155 Core i5-2500K and a $1000 LGA 2011 Core i7-3960X, even when three-way graphics card configurations are involved. It turns out that memory bandwidth and PCIe throughput don't hold back the performance of existing Sandy Bridge-based machines. &quot; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-cpu-review-overclock,3106-4.html The video card might be changed. I'd see how high I can go on this list. http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html The PSU is something of a problem area. Is it a single rail? If not are you sure you won't exceed the Amperes of any rail? Part of the reason of getting a single rail is for folk that don't want to learn about this. Bob

For me a 20 buck generic works fine.....your call. Mobo......get an atx......not a micro atx. Brand.....I doubt it makes much difference. Look at the features of both and see if something jumps at you. Gpu.....I see you can get a Hd 7850 for about the same bucks. That would be my choice.

For HD video rendering and 3D modeling yeah sure, go the i7 but for gaming it just wasn't necessary I emailed the seller asking if he could supply a Radeon 7870 but if not unfortunately the options only go up to Radeon 7850. Which is better out of the Radeon 7850 and GTX 660 (non Ti version). I'm reading a lot of conflicting reviews I'm not sure with the PSU, I'm assuming they will look at the parts I will request and put in something that can handle it. Surely they wouldn't give me a ****** PSU when the rest of the rig will be somewhat power hungry because when it melts 2 days after they supply it I'll just be returning it...obviously not what a business wants.

So I want to keep it nice and cool. I plan to game at full HD resolution with BF3 being my benchmark game. Hoping to run it on ultra or near to that settings at 30+ fps. Would you still reccomend the HD 7850 over the GTX 660 (non Ti version) for this resolution? I see people are saying the HD 7550/7870 really come into their own element at higher resolutions than this but that full HD and under that the GTX 660 would be better? Would you agree with that ?

Gpu......I think both those cards are pretty close.....since your cost is the same for either...... this might come down to splitting hairs. I still opt for the Hd 7850.....more bandwidth. It might be best to get the 2GB model if your planning on using max settings.
