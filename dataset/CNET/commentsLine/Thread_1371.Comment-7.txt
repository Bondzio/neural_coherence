i had looked at that, but i also saw a previous post that there were a lot of problems with the large hard drive.
i saw someone saying it was due to their being old(er) parts.
that's the only reason i haven't been as sure on this one.
if you have any information that can disprove that issue, i'd greatly appreciate it.
sincerely, lelia katherine thomas
