1.1.1	Hi folks , I just wanted to share this email ( below ) that I received from a CNET member in regards to backing up your data .	St
1.1.2	While many of you may religiously backup your data locally on a physical external hard drive , DVDs , flash drive , etc ...	St
1.1.3	If your data is important to you , in addition to your physical backup , do consider separate venues for storing your data -- whether it is online storage service or having it kept at a completely different location .	St
1.1.4	Because in catastrophic event like Japan 's recent earthquake and tsunami , your physical backup is n't going to do much good if it is physically destroyed .	St
1.1.5	So please keep this in mind and always be prepared for the worst case scenario .	Sug
1.1.6	Be safe out there !	St
1.1.7	And thank you Martha for sharing and caring enough to send us all a reminder !	Polite
1.1.8	Cheers !	St
1.1.9	-Lee Here is Martha 's email : With the recent event in Japan , folks along the coast of OREGON had some anxious moments a week ago after the Japan earthquake .	St
1.1.10	Visiting with one of these coastal residents , an accountant with payroll & amp ; tax clients , when ask 'd about backups said she & quot ; backed up & quot ; every day but did not have remote or cloud backups .	St
1.1.11	Seems like this is the golden opportunity to emphasize that backup means storing data in a separate venue .	St
1.1.12	When I did data management & amp ; programming in the late 1980s two of us took home every night a couple of floppy disks ( ! ! )	St
1.1.13	that had both app & amp ; data .	St
1.1.14	This came in handy when the server failed .	St
1.1.15	The golden rule is backup , backup , backup .	St
1.1.16	The first is local ( raid , etc . )	St
1.1.17	backup ; the second is physical but stored at a remote location ; the third is cloud .	St
1.1.18	I 'll bet now that cloud computing is going to be look 'd at much more favorably .	St
1.1.19	It is a good thing .	Polite
1.1.20	Email from Martha B .	St
1.2.1	Is n't the & quot ; cloud & quot ; a server or servers somewhere ?	Ques
1.2.2	Is it different from KodakGallery where I have saved the thousands of old slides I scanned ?	Ques
1.2.3	Where are Carbonite 's servers ?	Ques
1.2.4	It is not magic ; they must be somewhere physical , and probably on the San Andreas fault .	St
1.2.5	I do remember having two weeks of backup tapes at work and rotating one at home at first .	St
1.2.6	I just had to remember what week I was in .	St
1.3.1	I do regular backups , but not to my hard drive or extrenal drive etc .	St
1.3.2	While it might be more time consuming , I prefer to burn all of my important files , documents , and program files etc to DVD .	St
1.3.3	That way , if my system ever crashes or if I have a major problem , all I have to do when things return to normal is copy the files I need to my new hard drive .	St
1.3.4	Some people might not consider this as a proper backup , but it works for me .	St
1.4.1	... just to back up your data .	St
1.4.2	Every once in a while , you need to attempt to restore your data too .	St
1.4.3	This need not disrupt your existing IT - in a real disaster that would be a molten heap or underwater , so there 's no point trying to restore to that .	St
1.5.1	When you backup to an online & quot ; cloud & quot ; server , you are actually backing up to multiple servers .	St
1.5.2	Most online companies run anywhere from 3 to 6 separate geographical locations for their server hubs that are constantly talking to each to sync the data on each server .	St
1.5.3	This does n't just allow the data to be secured against physical distruction , but against data corruption because each set of data is compared to another set of data , which includes copy of the previous generation of the data .	St
1.5.4	It 's a simple redundancy system , much like have two separate people each taking a copy of the date home with them each night .	St
1.5.5	If you 're looking into online data backup and storage , ask where each backup server is located , and what redundancy and physical protections they have in place , and pick the one you like the best .	St
1.6.1	Your idea of backing up just to DVD 's might be fine now , but there are numerous things that can happen to the DVD 's and you have to remember and be ready for that .	St
1.6.2	For example what would you do if you backed up your data on your dvd 's and your house caught fire , your PC was destroyed in the blaze , and the DVD 's become molten coasters .	St
1.6.3	In this situation you would have lost all your data , which is why your backup needs to be stored away from the original , and even better if it is stored in more than one place .	St
1.6.4	I store my important documents in numerous places , I have it on my hard drive , online ( through gmail ) and on my phone .	St
1.6.5	In addition to this Gmail also do additional backups as has been discovered recently when a Gmail software bug deleted a lot of people 's e-mails .	St
1.6.6	Gmail were able to retrieve peoples e-mails from tape backups that they 'd made .	St
1.6.7	Ok it might have taken the person longer to retrieve the data than normal , but the data was still safe .	St
1.6.8	In my case if my PC was to fail , I 've still got the data either on my phone or on gmail , if gmail was to fail they 've got my data on backup tapes , and no doubt they also keep copies on numerous servers around the world as well , as well as on my phone or PC , and if my phone fails , or gets lost or stolen my data is still on my PC and Gmail .	St
1.6.9	One really useful feature that most people overlook on their phone is the synchronization option .	St
1.6.10	If you have a smartphone you should have a sync option ( I have a HTC HD2 Windows Mobile 6.5 phone with ActiveSync which works with Google ) , this can help you with your backups as you can set it to automatically sync most of your data with something else , either gmail or your local PC or both .	St
1.6.11	I have it set up to store anything I add to the phone to gmail the minute I add it to the phone , that way if anything happens to my phone I can still access the data on my phone through my Google account .	St
1.6.12	It then also syncs with my PC when I get back home .	St
1.6.13	The only issue with this is data costs , however I 'm on GiffGaff and for 10 a month I get unlimited data usage through my phone so it 's not an issue for me .	St
1.7.1	I have considered an online back up option , but I did n't want all my private info out there somewhere for others with an inside access to get to .	St
1.8.1	I , too , am concerned about my private stuff being out there , but it already is .	St
1.8.2	Every bank account and other financial things are accessible online , whether or not I am the one looking at it .	St
1.8.3	I use online everything ( bills , statements ) because I figure I am the one who has to protect them with passwords .	St
1.8.4	Those passwords , btw , are hand written , crossed out and rewritten and hidden so well I sometimes can not find them .	St
1.8.5	I try not to let my machines keep track of them .	St
1.8.6	But I do worry .	St
1.8.7	Also , if there is a tsunami , not being a business , data is the last thing I will be worrying about .	St
1.9.1	Not intending to be personal here , but suggesting that my DVD backups might get destroyed if a tsunami hit is a bit over the top is n't it ?	Ques
1.9.2	Sure , what happened in Japan recently was a terrible thing , but they honestly do n't happen all that often , and as someone else has already said , if a tsunami did hit then the safety of my data would be tha last thing on my mind .	St
1.9.3	Secondly , my PC is just that , a PERSONAL computer , so I do n't have to worry about business records being lost .	St
1.9.4	Even if I was running a business , I would n't use an online service for storing my backups , because again as others have mentioned , I would n't want my private information available to anyone out there who knows how to access ( legally or illegally ) such a system .	St
1.9.5	As far as smart phones are concerned , I do n't have one , I do n't need one and I do n't want one .	St
1.9.6	Call me old fashioned if you like , but I only use my mobile for phone calls , text messages and taking the very occasional photo if I do n't have any of my cameras with me .	St
1.9.7	I do n't need instant access to emails and/or the internet or any of the other myriad of services available via a smart phone .	Ques
1.9.8	If I 'm away from home and an important email comes in or someone suggests that I look at this or that on the internet asap , then it can wait until I get home .	St
1.9.9	Finally , I 'm a realist , although I do n't care if you call me a fatalist .	St
1.9.10	If any kind of disaster , natural or otherwise is going to strike my home , then it 's going to happen anyway and there 's nothing I can do to prevent it .	St
1.9.11	If something like that does happen though , and the worst thing that results is that my computer ( including my DVD backups ) and other personal belongings are damaged or destroyed , then it wo n't be the end of the world for me because I 'll still be alive and material things can always be replaced .	St
1.9.12	Sh*t happens everyday , but I 'm not going to sit around worrying about all of the & quot ; what ifs & quot ; .	St
1.10.1	Yes , you will be glad you 're alive , but when you start to try to put your life back together , you will probably wish you had done some off-site backups , especially for those things that ca n't be re-created , like family photos and financial data .	St
1.11.1	I am VERY concerned now about my data & phone calls could all be scanned as they travel through the ether & space via satellite .	St
1.11.2	Cloud computing & storage is a fine way for our private data to be read enroute to storage & the fact of it being stored in multiple places gives data mining companies even greater scope to read our private stuff .	St
1.11.3	That would apply exponecially if the storage company provided the service free .	St
1.11.4	They have to make money on it somehow !	St
1.11.5	One of my phone numbers is a 'private number ' phone number which I only give to certain people but out of the blue recently I started getting phone sellers ringing me on it .	St
1.11.6	So vicious was the campaign to get me to answer the call , my phone would ring 17 times in a row !	St
1.11.7	I knew who was calling because I use caller ID on that number .	St
1.11.8	I finally put the phone on silent so as not to hear the damned thing !	St
1.11.9	x : ( My suspicion is that the cloud storage company that handles one of my internet & email ISPs ( a subscription service ) mined the number out of an email I sent to someone .	St
1.11.10	This to me is the last straw !	St
1.11.11	I have previously been suspicious of data being mined out of emails .	St
1.11.12	That is seperate to the email address harvesters that troll the free email sites checking for emails filled with several generations of email addresses on uncleaned joke mail .	St
1.11.13	They sell all those addresses to mailing list buyers for spam production .	Sug
1.11.14	If recipient 's addresses can be mined that easily when not BCC 'd , how easy is it for all sorts of data to be mined out of back-ups being sent to the clouds ? ? ? ? ?	Ques
1.11.15	: - [	St
1.12.1	When I backup to the cloud , I use high quality encryption and I make sure the data is encrypted with my password and on my machines before they leave the machine .	St
1.12.2	If you do this , then the concerns about privacy are significantly reduced .	St
1.13.1	Depending on your geographical location , a tsunami might be a far cry .	St
1.13.2	However , I am told that DVD 's ( as do other media ) tend to break down after time deteriorating their ability store and access data .	St
1.13.3	As suggested in the previous post , data that may seem of little worth today could cause undue anxiety after some catastrophe or just regular loss of data at a later date .	St
1.14.1	There are backup solutions available that could save your data from a nuclear holocaust , but they cost a fortune .	St
1.14.2	Or , you can use faith-based backups for free .	St
1.14.3	The determining factor should be & quot ; What is my data worth ? & quot ; .	St
1.14.4	Maybe you only use your computer for web-surfing and personal email , and you do n't have anything worth saving on it .	St
1.14.5	Then it is n't worth backing it up .	St
1.14.6	Maybe you have all of your photos on it .	St
1.14.7	Definitely worth the time and money to at least burn a couple of DVDs once in a while and store them at some friend 's and relatives houses .	St
1.14.8	Maybe you have a thousand hours worth of work on it .	St
1.14.9	What 's that worth to you ?	Ques
1.14.10	Backups are like taking care of anything valuable , the more that it 's worth , the more you should invest in protecting it .	St
1.15.1	Cloud computing is basically using someone else 's services for allowance for storage short-coming and/or apps..	St
1.15.2	This is the popular term now , because most netbooks do n't have sufficent or rather large off book storage other than USB based .	St
1.15.3	Understand , the 1st netbooks did n't have any int .	St
1.15.4	storage at all or were very limited .	St
1.15.5	So anyone running older netbooks looked elsewhere .	St
1.15.6	At the same time costs were a factor as well .	St
1.15.7	This may not be as costly and the alternatives available now but it does still exist .	St
1.15.8	Cloud computing has expanded as well , so I leave it at that .	St
1.15.9	Yes , back-ups are important as the user deems them .	St
1.15.10	Unfortunately that 's a lesson learned too late .	St
1.15.11	-- -- -Willy	St
1.16.1	A very concise conclusion to the matter in my estimation .	St
1.17.1	Cloud technology is one of the most advanced and productive advancement for the home and business users .	St
1.17.2	It helps a lot of businesses and personal users to store / host their data on safe cloud .	St
1.17.3	Yes , data backups are very important aspect and one should keep it in mind while using and storing their data on cloud servers .	St
1.17.4	It is very easy to store your important data on cloud server through cloud storage / online backup services .	St
1.17.5	Yes , backups are very important in case of cloud outages and disaster !	St
