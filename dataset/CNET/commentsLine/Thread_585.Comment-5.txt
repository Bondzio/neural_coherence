the info you have given us is rather confusing.
you keep referring to a memory stick, also known as ram or random access memory which(very briefly) only increases the working area for running programs and other functions it is not for storage.
so my question is did he install extra ram or an internal hard drive.
do you see any components outside the computer like sitting on the desktop somewhere with wires going to the computer.
if not he installed an extra hard drive internally.
right click my computer and click manage.
on the windows that opens click disk management and see if there is a new drive there.
right click the drive and click initiate.
when that is done you will need to format the drive.
