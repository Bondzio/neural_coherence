also, Creative Labs is usually revered as the best BUT nVidia's Soundstorm should not be forgotten (only avliable on AthlonXP platforms (it's integrated) Turtle Beach's Riviera, Santa Cruz and Catalina are also nice cards, but offer a lower sampling rate (CD quality, Creative offers 4x the sampling rate) Personally I would stick with my Auidgy 2 ZS Platinum (which afaik has been discontinued...while the Audigy 2 ZS and Audigy 2 ZS Platinum Pro are still out (???))
the Audigy 2 and Audigy 2 ZS are great cards avoid the Audigy ES, and Audigy LS (and the 2 ZS Value) Turtle Beach is the best choice if your on a super tight budget, and want a sound card (Which you buy to offload work from the CPU) for professional cards you can look to M-Audio, E-MU, and higher from that I'm not sure (used to know the name of the Audio version of 3DLabs (3DLabs doesn't have an audio branch, 3DLabs is a Creative company, but they are also like the super elite for professional stuff, and I used to know the super elite for audio too)
