<s> Ok there was a thunder storm here a few hours ago and i wasnt home. </s>
<s> When i left I left my laptop on with the phone cord plugged into my modem. </s>
<s> Well while i was gone lightning struck the telephones in my town and it went through my modem well now i cant get on the internet with my laptop. </s>
<s> Now My computer says the modem is working properly but to protect my system it can go &quot;off the hook&quot; because of the strong current or voltage that went through it so can anyone tell me how to fix this problem or will i need a new modem? </s>
<s> FYI: heres exactly wat the pop up box says about my modem. </s>
<s> Modem Warning The modem has detected a current ot voltage level on the telphone line which could damage your hardware. </s>
<s> To protect your system,the modem has not been allowed to go off-hook. </s>
<s> The modem is fried, unrepairable. </s>
<s> You might be able to disable it in the BIOS and then install a USB modem if you have USB ports. </s>
<s> Otherwise it's repair shop time. </s>
