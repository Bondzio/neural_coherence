here's what i've found.i may have it correctly backed up.
i went to &quot;computer&quot;.
my libraries and drives are in left pane.
i click my external drive and properties.
it tells me that i have 72gbs on the drive.
that sounds about right for the things i backed up.
it has 2 items listed in right pane.
under &quot;raypc&quot;,properties,it lists the gbs and other information about changes that i can make.the other item on the list is mediaid, which i assume is my personal information.
it opens in word pad.
there i find some letters and numbers that i can't tell anything about.
so, i guess i have the data on the external drive.
is there anything else that i need to do,like make a special folder for it?
i have it set to back up once a week, sunday, so i'll see if it automatic backs up.
any other information that i might need would be appreciated.
thanks for the help red
