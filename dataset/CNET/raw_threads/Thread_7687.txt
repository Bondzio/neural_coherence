It's at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7588_102-0.html?threadID=354911&tag=forums06;forum-threads where we progress from free to try before buy to data recovery houses. In your case I'd remove the drive and try it in a new case and hope you don't need to send it to data recovery. -&gt; Where was the backup copy? Bob

HD do a back-up or copy whatever critical files to your main HD, CD/DVD media and/or flash drives, whatever media you have, NOW! The other posters offered good advice don't hesitate to use it or act on it. Further, you should use this as a lesson in regular back-up procedure just in case it happens again. tada -----Willy
