An owner reported this to me and they were trying to use their HP supplied CDs on a machine they built themselves. Yup, that doesn't work. Bob

Also that message doesn't come up, it was due to some pins getting bent on the IDE connector I think, well it's fixed and the thing keeps restarting, I have a feeling it could be the RAM but I have no way of testing it.

The CD works as my friend formatted his laptop and his computer using it, I have an old cd of Windows ME from my sony desktop and when I run that a gray screen appears saying that the cd is not from this machine. I did the ram test with Memtest86, my first run through it at about 10 min into the session th pc restarted leaving the cd in the machin kept restarting non-stop until I removed the cd. (no errors were found I think it got to about 37%) I am retrying the test again.

I am leaning towards the cpu but when I take off the CPU fan and run the PC when it gets hot it shuts down and it does not restart, unlike when I try to boot windows it restarts. Can the motherboard be responsible for the PC to restart. I have also tried installing Linux and I also ran a Windows XP cd that is loaded directly from the cd and does not use the HD and the thing restarts anyway.
