115f should not be a problem with that CPU.
You can easily overclock this processor merely by raising the FSB and adding a tenth of a volt to the core to aid stability (you'll need to switch out of AUTO).
Make sure the RAM and FSB are unlinked so you don't overclock the RAM when upping the FSB.
Best to overclock in small increments, run something like Prime95 to check for stability, and keep an eye on the temps.
