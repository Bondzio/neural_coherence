as upgrades for the following system: sony pcv-rx650 1.6ghz p4, windows xp home(sp2) 512mb pc2100 ddr ram 80gb ata/100 hd  i purchased: lg gsa-4166b internal dl dvd/cd rewrite drive & maxtor l01r300)ultra16 300gb 7200rpm ultra ata/133 internal hd i plan on installing the dvd drive in order to backup the current hd and then install the maxtor hd.
never having installed an additional internal hd before, anything i need to know in terms of setup or configuration.
the current internal hd already has an additional ata interface cable attached to it and there is an additional power supply for the extra 3.5'' slot.
i plan on using the provided software to transfer the current partitioned hd data c:20gb & d:60gb to the new maxtor drive.
i'm a little confused as to how to set the jumper configuration and setup the new maxtor drive (partioned or not?)
along with leaving the old hd in place as additional storage?
anything else to look out for?
thanks and happy holidays!
