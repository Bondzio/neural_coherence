i recently purchased the hp laserjet cp1518ni, it works great on letter size paper but when i try to print a custom size, it prints one then goes into cleaning mode.
i have talked repetedly to their tech support and nothing they suggest works, i honestly don't think they can relate to the invitation business.
i am using a mac, with indesign cs3, does anyone know what i am doing wrong, i bet it is something simple but for the life of me i can't figure it out.
thank so much.
