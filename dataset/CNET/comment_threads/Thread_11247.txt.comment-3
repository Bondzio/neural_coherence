Everything was connected correctly, I found some article where the same motherboard was burned in the same spot as with mine: www.bit-tech.net/blog/2009/02/20/rip-asus-m3a-h-hdmi-bursts-into-flames/?tcs=nl Anyhow, that's no use now, even though it's unclear why it's broken, it is, and I'd like to replace it.
I can't buy the same motherboard as I had, because that would probably give the same weird problem, and fireworks.
