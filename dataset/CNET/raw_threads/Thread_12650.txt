5542	0	266198	2596136	NR	hot88s	9/30/07 4:58 PM	1.19117148E12	Changing drive ID	I just completed installing an sata drive using a host card. I cloned my old hard drive to the new hard drive. I disconnected the old drive and booted the computer. The new drive was labeled C:. I then re connected the old drive and it automatically took the C: and made the new drive F:. How can I still keep my old drive connected but use the new drive as the bootable drive. I am using Windows XP Pro.

Sometimes we find the old machine does not have a BIOS that allows one to boot from the PCI SATA card first so for those we have no real cure except to try an IDE to SATA adapter and see if the PCI SATA card has an onboard boot rom with such control. Given such slim details I can't offer much more. Bob

I am thinking that maybe changing the jumper on the ATA drive to slave, but I have not tried it yet. What other details do you need? The old drive is an ATA Maxtor 20G and identified as c: currently. The new drive is a SATA Seagate 360G and is identified as f: currently. The operating system is Windows XP Pro The processor is Athalon MD 1.5 MHZ The memory is 512KB (upgrading to 2MB at a later date) The mother board only supports ATA. (not sure of the brand) The PCIA IDE to Sata Host card is from Comp USA. Please ask if there is any more information needed? Thank you.

This is my primary drive and I don't want to loss data. Whats the risk? Since this basically will just boost the connection speed for the drive, I'd think little risk maybe 20%. I need a second, third, fourth opinion.

It is a cloning software that totally mirrors your existing hard drive to a new hard drive. But then I bought a Seagate 360 mb hard drive. And guess what? It had the Acronis software included! Nice waste of 50 bucks! Anyway, It works realy well. Simple to use. And it clones everything including your operating system, programs, program files, personal files and everything else existing on your old drive. The Operating system and all programs work just as if you didn't install a new hard drive. Thats what I did!

Do I need to uninstall it before attaching the mini disc card or can I just umplug it, attach the mini card, then just plug it back in? With no ill effects.

I need a work around or need to know what the problem(s) would be before hand, before I screw it up. I'll probably just pull the plug on it.

I'd also be able to get that IDE cable out of the tower and improve air flow. I've found one for $14.00. I saw them at CompUSA for $30.00. The improvement might well be worth the expense, if I don't crash my system. I do have the partial back up, however. I'm also planning on getting Acronis but in the future not now. Perhaps I should wait on the mini card and get Acronis first.
