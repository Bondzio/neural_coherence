1.1.2	I was given the subject video card by a friend.	St
1.1.3	XP picks up the card and loads the drivers; however, at the end of the boot process the screen goes blank showing nothing but a curser (I do see my desktop for about 30 seconds).	St
1.1.4	My monitor is plugged into a video port on the motherboard of a Dell.	St
1.1.5	Are there jumpers on the motherboard or something else I need to adjust/fix my problem, and keep the screen from going blank when I plug my monitor into the video card?	St
1.1.6	Asking the experts.	St
1.1.7	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	Find drivers (I suggest google.com) then boot SAFE MODE to install them.	Sug
1.2.2	That's a very old card, but your issue is typical for a clean XP install.	St
