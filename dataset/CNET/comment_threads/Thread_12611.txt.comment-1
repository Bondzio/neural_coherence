I am looking into a new computer around Christmas time.
One is an Emachines while the other is an HP.
If I get the E-machines, I will upgrade the video card from a Radeon X200 to a 9600.
I am having doubts because some of my classmates say I am better off building one than work with an Emachines.
But I did my homework and found out they are really good computers.
I was wondering I should even bother upgrading it or give it a shot and see what I come up with.
