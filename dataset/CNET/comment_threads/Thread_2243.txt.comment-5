Refurb can be great.
Anyone that returns a pc or electronic devic cannot be sold again as new, it therefore can be a great deal to buy a refurbed product from the direct sites like dell.com or refubdepot.com.
However sometimes refubished products can have cosmetic blemishes.
Refurb usually carries a 30-90 day warranty too which is when chances of something breaking are the highest.
The best way to buy refurb is to go to an outlet store so you can see the product before you buy it.
That's why the Sony outlet store is one of my favorite!
