i agree captaincraig, as a 2.4 ghz very definitely interfere with a 802.11b (most common) wireless network, as they both work in the same frequency range.
as for the pc card, it can be used on a desktop, but it requires a special pci card be installed inside the desktop.
as for the microsoft adapters, either should work equally well.
the usb adapter is easier as it's external.
