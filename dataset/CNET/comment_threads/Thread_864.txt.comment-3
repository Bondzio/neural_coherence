Look into the Kindle Fire as a possible choice.
$200 bucks to get her a e-reader (in color) that also can also play movies, games, etc.
Kindle Fire is the next best thing to the iPad and it brings the price down $299.
But, just read your &quot;price is not an issue&quot; again.... so you may want to just up for the iPad if you got the cash.
