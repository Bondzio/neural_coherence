<s> Well back to the drawing board here.I got a new Geforce 6600 AGP,mother board is a pchip board witch is also ECS main boards. </s>
<s> (ECSM825VXX)witch is the same board as K7-M825VXX.I have a power supply that has been discontinued by Raidmax,model number RD-350.My video card needs more power to work right.Size is 5.9x3.4x5.5 I have been looking for one now for 3 days.But i can not find one.Price is very importation. </s>
<s> I would like about 500 to 600watts so i will not get in this problem again for some time.It would be nice to if it had some cool colors,but it does not matter. </s>
<s> Thank again! </s>
<s> I highly suggest you actually go to a store, bring your power supply with you and see which one is exactly like yours. </s>
<s> I had to replace my aging PSU, bought one from the internet and guess what it didn't fit. </s>
<s> I brought my PSU to my CompUsa and I got the right PSU. </s>
<s> Remember size and desgin matters ^^. </s>
<s> Thermaltake makes some cool ones with decent build quality in the watt range your looking for.Check out their site. </s>
<s> Of couse Antec generally makes the highest quality, but they charge a premium for the higher watt units. </s>
<s> A thermaltake one should be more than fine. </s>
<s> on second thought thermaltake is pretty steap too. </s>
