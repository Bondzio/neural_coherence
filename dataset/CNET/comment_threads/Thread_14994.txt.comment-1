Hi there.
I have a Dell 4600 with 74.5G memory.
My problem: the drive is full and I don't understand why.
It says I've only got 312MB left!
I've not downloaded music or videos, and only some photos.
When I check my system and data folders, they indicate about 20-25G each, so where's the rest?
Is there something I can do to access that or make additional memory available?
Are these junk files?
