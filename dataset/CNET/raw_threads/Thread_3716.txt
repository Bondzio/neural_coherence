The Samsung 17 inch LCD monitor, 710N-2-Black is selling for such low prices [at newegg and others] 309 minus 30 mail in and minus 40 immediate rebate = 239 incl shipping. This is a 12 Millisecond model. I heard that some of the faster ones didn't match up when it came to color quality. Do you think that Samsung is unloading them?????

I am currently in the middle of trying to rectify this situation with ZIPZOOMFLY/SAMSUNG. Beware of dealing with them as you may end up with something you did not want!
