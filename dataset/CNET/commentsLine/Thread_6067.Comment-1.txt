i am a graphic artist/web designer looking for a new computer.
i have always used pcs until i recently started a new job where macs are used.
i like the simple design of the imac but don't want to give up a lot of power and options that the pc seems to offer.
how fast is the g5 1.8ghz compared to the pentium 4 with 3.0ghz?
i am still far more comfortable using the pc, but if the imac is the better system adusting will only be a minor problem.
if you could give me the pros and cons of each i would greatly appreciate it.
thanks...nicole
