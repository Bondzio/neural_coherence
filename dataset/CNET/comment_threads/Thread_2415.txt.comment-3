A little more info, please.
Was it a PS 2 mouse?
Have you tried leaving the PS 2 mouse port disconnected and using a USB mouse??
Will your system boot up to the first video screen with nothing connected to the mobo except video card, memory, CPU/HSF, the power supply and the front panel connections?
No mouse, no keyboard??
You may have zapped the I/O chip on the mobo, and possibly the Southbridge chip.
Sounds as if you need a new mobo.
