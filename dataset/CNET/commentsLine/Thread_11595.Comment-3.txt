alot can happen in 6 mos.
maybe even a price break.
further, whatever becomes the hot thing, cools and becomes yesterday's forgotten item.
you need to concentrate on what you really need.
if you can wait all the better.
you're a prime example of a gamer wanting the whole enchilada.
if some item can bridge that time gap, go for it.
if it becomes more a shew of items, then certainly wait, it usually worth it.
plus, by the time you got everything you wanted, something else can certainly make itself more appealing.
gaming just tends to wreak havoc if the &quot;whole pc&quot; isn't considered and thus look for what makes a continuing good match overall.
in other words don't sup-up the ram when all you need probably less, like 8gb vs 16gb.
get the cpu if you like, but generally speaking, it seems the gpu is the real center of attention in the gaming world, everything else supports that feature more or less.
of course a hot user friendly mtrbd.
is a real plus.
visit gaming website for surefire info on what's really best to include tomshardware website.
that website alone provides tested results that are good to know.
