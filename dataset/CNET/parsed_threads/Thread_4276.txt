<s> I have a single level house with three laptops, two of which are Dell Inspirons and one of which is an IBM Thinkpad. </s>
<s> I need a recommendation for a router that is much more focused on range than speed. </s>
<s> The speed that comes out of the cable modem is fine for us, as we don't do many speed-intensive tasks. </s>
<s> Also, I would like it to be easy to set up, as I am fairly knowledgeable when it comes to techy stuff, but not programmer smart or anything. </s>
<s> Thanks Much! </s>
<s> consumer oriented routers from Linksys, D-Link, Netgear, etal, will do. </s>
<s> The only preference I would push is an 802.11G model vs a B model, the added speed is nice for LAN transfers. </s>
<s> i believe g routers also have greater speed </s>
<s> was just too easy. </s>
<s> I expected to learn a lot about networking (through trial and error), but each D-link component; cable modem, router, NICs, and wireless NICs all found each other, self configured, and it was done. </s>
<s> Well, maybe not that easy, I had to input some data and set up home networking on the PCs, but all in all, the D-link configuration was really a snap. </s>
<s> Just don't mix brands. </s>
<s> Good luck, Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach that person to use the Internet and they won't bother you for weeks. </s>
<s> Click here to see the CNet faces, learn a little about telephones, internet connections and data, and download free software. </s>
<s> Take a look at the Belkin Pre-N Router - I have it and it does very well on speed and range. </s>
<s> Not too cheap though. </s>
<s> Ben </s>
<s> I checked out this one, but it seems way too expensive. </s>
<s> I may go for the Parkervision vision. </s>
<s> Read my review. </s>
<s> I can't stand this thing, buying it was the worst money investment in my life. </s>
