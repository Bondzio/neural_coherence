1.1.1	Okay , I have an issue and am not sure how to resolve the problem .	St
1.1.2	Let 's start off with a scenario .	St
1.1.3	Let 's say I boot the computer with a DVD in the & quot ; e-drive & quot ; and open the 'My Computer ' .	St
1.1.4	It will tell me what is in the drive .	St
1.1.5	When I eject the DVD from & quot ; e : drive & quot ; and replace it with a CD the 'My Computer ' will not update the cd-drive .	St
1.1.6	The cd will also not do the auto-play ( as do most cds that have an auto launch procedure ) .	St
1.1.7	The cd-drive under 'My Computer ' will still show what was in the drive when the system was booted .	St
1.1.8	Even if I refresh the window it does nothing .	St
1.1.9	If I double click on the icon it will still act like it 's a dvd and launch a dvd player instead of a music program or the application .	St
1.1.10	So far the only way to view the contents of the cd is to right click and explore .	St
1.1.11	This is currently occurring to both my cd-drives so I 'm sure it may not be an issue with them but something else .	St
1.1.12	All the drivers are current and still can not find the cause of the problem .	St
1.1.13	What could be causing this issue ?	Ques
1.1.14	I am running Windows XP if that matters to anybody .	St
1.1.15	Any help could be greatly appreciated .	Polite

1.3.1	First off..its best to say when I reach my DESKTOP..not so much that I BOOTUP and this or that.. ..	St
1.3.2	Since you are useing a DVD-ROM..you need to know the Media Types going in that TRAY..CDs do n't matter..but I use a TOSHIBA ( dash ) Drive that if I place a DVD ( plus ) Disk in will corrupt my OS..and I have a second DVD-Drive that both ( + - ) so all problems are eliminated.. .. Then it seems you said that you SHUT-Down with a disk in the TRAY..and then performed your START-UP w/the disk still in the TRAY..this can cause a problem or NOT..never SHUT Down with Removable Media in their Devices ( especially ) the FLOPPY Drive.. .. Also..are you RUNNING a Scheduled SCAN..and you have forgotten..so your attempting to run two programs at once..and that could be your problem.. ..	St
1.3.3	I also ARCHIVE my FILES/FOLDERS..this keeps my System Drive ready to RUN with little Power Management problems..I usually start with a empty PC..for each project..useing External HDDs.. ..	St
1.3.4	If none of the above is any help I would suggest you Re-Install and take a fresh look at your PC .	St
