1.2.2	Maybe you should do some troubleshooting .	Sug

1.3.2	If it fails later it is either temperature or non CPU issues .	St

1.4.2	If you can borrow another PC which will allow you to connect your drives and network it to the rental , this might work .	St

1.5.1	Get a fan for your cpu before you do burn it up .	St
