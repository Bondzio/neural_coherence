I looked in my bios and it does not give an option for multiplying the speed. I was wondering if there is any software or a way I could overclock the processor. I have an intel mobo. Thanks Billy

NO there are no utilitys out there. if you bought a new mobo yah, you could overclock an intel cpu. you just have to find the right one. (mainly any new mobo) konny
