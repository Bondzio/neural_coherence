i have a simpledrive external drive (160 gb) that suddenly stopped being recognized by my mac.
i've tried changing the usb cord and connecting it to my ibook g4 but get the same result.
it's being recognized in the system profiler, but not as it is usually listed and it's not showing up on my desktop.
all it does is flash the blue activity led.
can someone please help me with this.
i have a lot (basically everything) saved on this drive and it is very important information.
if the drive cannot be fixed is there at least a way i can get the files off or transferred to another drive?
please help!!!
thanks
