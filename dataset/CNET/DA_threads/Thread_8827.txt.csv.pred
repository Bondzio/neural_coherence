1.1.1	Hello everybody .	St
1.1.2	Let me start by giving the details .	St
1.1.3	I have three PCs in my home .	St
1.1.4	All three are networked with an active hub that ties to my modem .	St
1.1.5	Two of my PCs can access the internet as well as my sons XBox360 .	St
1.1.6	Now for my problem .	St
1.1.7	The newest PC is a Compaq with Vista Home Basic OS .	St
1.1.8	AMD Sempron 3600+ 894 MB RAM 32 bit operating system 120 gig HD I have not been able to get onto the internet since I plugged in the cable .	St
1.1.9	However , when I run the diagnostic tests found in the Compaq Hardware Tools it says the connection is good and running at 100.00mbps I can ping the other PCs successfully I can ping the modem successfully It seems to me that I cant get passed my modem since pinging a website times out What about my modem would cause this PC to get locked out ?	Ques
1.1.10	Or is it a Vista default setting in Explorer ?	Ques
1.1.11	Please advise Thanks Jim	Sug
1.2.1	Also , why are the make and models plus settings in your posts ?	Ques
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	The router I have seems to be having a problem getting the signals through so I removed it .	St
1.3.2	The rest of my computers have no problems with networking , LAN or WAN .	St
1.4.1	Rob , I seldom post on the net , but every time that I have a tech type question everyone seems to get mad if you do n't give them your system details .	St
1.4.2	Is it against the policy that I did n't really read concerning what you can post ?	Ques
1.5.1	When you want it serviced .	St
1.5.2	If you feel such is not needed just say so .	St
1.5.3	But I do n't like working blindfolded .	St
1.5.4	Bob	St
1.6.1	I have no idea what you are getting at now .	St
1.6.2	Did you reread all posts to make sure we are saying the same things ?	Ques
1.6.3	Is your first post supposed to say & quot ; what are & quot ; and not & quot ; why are & quot ; ?	Ques
1.6.4	That is the only thing I can figure is wrong here .	St
1.6.5	The router works , I just reattached it .	St
1.6.6	It is a Hawking HBR 49 .	St
1.6.7	Now that I reattached it the hub ( new ) does n't work .	St
1.6.8	It is a Lynksys NH1005 ( new ) .	St
1.6.9	This is how I have it set up .	St
1.6.10	wall phone jack to modem , a Speedstream 4200 .	St
1.6.11	Modem to router .	St
1.6.12	2 original PCs are currently in router because the hub will not work from router ports .	St
1.6.13	The hub is currently connected to the first port , no signal .	St
1.6.14	PCs are in 2 & 3 working fine I am going to double check the cabling to make sure new cable is n't different wiring sequence .	St
1.7.1	But without make , model and how things are connected we are often left with no where to start .	St
1.7.2	Sorry about that .	St
1.7.3	& quot ; because the hub will not work from router ports. & quot ; Armed with that clue I am still missing the make/model of the HUB .	St
1.7.4	Some have the AUTOMDX feature , some do n't .	St
1.7.5	My ANSWER is that you did n't wire to the uplink port but without the make/model I ca n't be sure of that answer .	St
1.7.6	Bob	St
1.8.1	yall make it sound so difficult .	St
1.8.2	its probably an ip addroess conflict .	St
1.8.3	the modem has a default ip address of probably 192.168.0.1 and you router probably does too .	St
1.8.4	google ur models and they should tell u the exact ip address .	Sug
1.8.5	ok connect modem with lan cable to pc .	St
1.8.6	type in ip address in ie , and u should get to a browser based config utility for your modem .	St
1.8.7	just change the ip to something other than ur router ip address , and make sure no computer will ever use that address on ur network .	St
1.8.8	ex 192.168.0.2 instead of 192.168.0.1. then rehook everything and you sohuld get connected .	St
1.9.1	for bad spelling and grammar .	St
1.9.2	just make sure your router and medem have different ip addresses , and you have entered the right info into them .	Sug
1.9.3	ie .	St
1.9.4	you have dsl and a static ip address or a username and password .	St
1.9.5	you have to enter those things .	St
1.10.1	It is the Linksys mentioned above .	St
1.11.1	I got the New PC to join in but now I have a laptop that wife uses in a corporate VPN that suddenly wo n't work .	St
1.11.2	I am reviewing the manual for the router now and will get this figured out somehow .	St
1.11.3	I agree that it is a router setting or two .	St
1.11.4	Some of the jargon is still 4in to me .	St
