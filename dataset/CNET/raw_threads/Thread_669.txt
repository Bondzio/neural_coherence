When I insert a blank DVD though, it tells me the drive is empty. I've tried 3-4 different types of media and at least 3 different burning programs. It's something with the drive, it won't recognize the disc under My Computer. I'm using a P4 1ghz, 384 mb ram, running windows ME. I've tried updating the ASPI drivers and the firmware for the recorder. I uninstalled the drive from device manager and also unplugged and reinstalled the actual drive itself with no luck. Everyone I've talked to at Gateway or Liteon so far are baffled and can't help me. I've gotten the drive to work twice, successfully burning a dvd once, by uninstalling and reinstalling it under device manager. It seems to be random though, I've done that same thing at least 50 times and then it suddenly works long enough to burn 1 disc. Please help me! this is driving me insane.
