and yes, i am not the brightest bulb on the string but i do know that i am the same with a pc as i am with a car.
i don't know what the inner workings are but i can drive anything and i do it very well:) a pc is a big purchase for someone with a lower than average income.
i only want to get all i can for my dollar.
i have between 6 and 700 i am willing to spend.
i've saved it, and it has taken some time:) so i am researching as best i can.
i've learned a lot, also, a lot of opinions which are hard to deal with.
i feel i will eventually have to go with my own instincts again:) nothing new there.
then pentium sounds the best, but then i was swayed by someone that sounded very sure of an athlon.
lots of questions.
ive been checking out every site i can find, tigerdirect, geeks, newegg, dell, hp, compaq etc.
decisions, decisions.
thanks everyone for your input:) denise
