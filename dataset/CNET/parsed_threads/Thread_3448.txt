<s> Whenever i go to open disk cleanup, it comes up with a message saying that it has to close and the same for msn. </s>
<s> This can't be a coincidence. </s>
<s> Can anyone help? </s>
<s> Please complete your post and share why you feel it's a hardware issue. </s>

<s> well to be honest, i'm new at this and i wasnt sure what category to put it under. </s>
<s> I figured it was hardware as it is part of the program which came with the laptop. </s>
<s> Are you able to help? </s>
<s> There are not enough clues in your post. </s>
<s> And the hardware you suspect is not detailed. </s>
<s> Sorry if this sounds harsh but I can't help those that don't share. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> sorry, thanks for the help. </s>
<s> Firstly whever i go to use dick cleanup it comes up with an error message saying that ' to help protect your computer windows has closed this program'. </s>
<s> Now i have tried what microsoft recommend and that is to try and get rid of any corrupted tempory internet files and this has not worked. </s>
<s> Does this help? </s>
<s> I have yet to see you write what hardware you suspect. </s>
<s> This sounds more like a software issue such as needing to run the Disk Checkup on the properties page of the drive. </s>
<s> If you do want me to comment on hardware be sure to respond with at least what's asked when you post. </s>
<s> I'll copy it here since you may not be seeing it. </s>
<s> Note: If you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem. </s>
<s> Also please exercise your best judgment when posting in the forums--revealing personal information such as your e-mail address, telephone number, and address is not recommended. </s>

<s> so if this is a software probelm are you qualified to help? </s>
<s> I may be qualified but you should choose the forum that matches the issue. </s>
<s> You chose the PC hardware forum so I am taking the hardware approach. </s>
<s> If that's incorrect just tell me it's not the hardware and I'll point you to the right forum. </s>

<s> im not sure, how do i get to software? </s>
