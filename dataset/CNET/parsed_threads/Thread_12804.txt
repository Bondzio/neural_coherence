<s> Dear sir, actually i want to change my public ip because i have still 6 ip pending. </s>
<s> But you know where that IP comes from so why not ask them for another? </s>

<s> actually sir i have two ip pools and i want to change my public ip at regular basis like suppose i want a ip for one week then another ip for another week and so on and i don't want to change my untrust mode ip because i am unable to find default gateway ip field in juniper netscreen 5gt so i want to nat my whole network to another ip without changing my untrust port ip </s>
<s> I don't think I can help you. </s>
<s> It appears there is more information or a bigger question than you lead with. </s>
<s> It's pretty clear that you can't DMZ an entire network. </s>
<s> That is, a machine in the DMZ would receive all incoming connections. </s>
<s> So the usual network is behind a router and while a pool of IPs would let you take an IP and send incoming to that IP to a particular computer, that still fails to &quot;DMZ&quot; the entire network. </s>
<s> At least that's clear to your beginning first year networker. </s>
<s> With that out of the way, I can only suggest you chat with the folk you work with about your network. </s>
<s> I must bow out since I think your goal is unclear. </s>
