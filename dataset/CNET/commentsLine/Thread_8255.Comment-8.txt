i purchased an acs-100 and installed my hard drive.
on my win2k sp4 machine, i can turn on the hard drive and windows automatically detects external drive as a 'usb external storage device.'
when i try to 'stop' the drive to do a safe disconnect/unplug, i select 'usb external storage device' and click the 'stop' button.
then windows immediately restarts!
i tried the drive with my new winxp machine.
the drive is recognized my windows once i turn on the drive.
when i go to safe disconnect/unplug, windows says, 'the device is sitll in use.'
however, i have closed every window and application that i know of.
any ideas why i am getting this weirdness?
any ideas where i can turn?
i emailed adaptec customer support and they said that they do not provide tech support for that product only a hardware replacement.
i do not think it is the hardware, i think that i am having problems similiar to those list on amazon.com:  i do not have another external drive to test if it is the drive or if it is a windows problem.
please help, i'd appreciate any advice
