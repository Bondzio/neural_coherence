i have a hard drive enclosure connected via usb.
it was working fine all along.
i had to disconnect it to move my computer and when i hooked it back up, the drive letter doesn't appear.
when i go into my device manager it shows up and when i click &quot;properties&quot; it says, &quot;this device is working properly.&quot; any advice?
its a western digital wd300bb.
i am running xp pro.
