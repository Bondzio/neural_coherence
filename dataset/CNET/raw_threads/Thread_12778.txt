Am having it looked at by professional data retrievers that charge by the size of the drive. Looking to the future, logic says more than 1 drive won't fail at a time, so cost of retrieved data from a smaller drive will be less than w/a larger one. Pros: cost of retrieval, peace of mind over spreading the risk of loss... Cons: Initial cost of 5 'small' drives vs. cost of 1 large drive, more electrical power used to run many drives, dealing with greater heat factor (I already use external fans, which draws more power)... Are there other more or less important factors that I may be missing? Thanks for any and all input!

It's not a matter of if a drive fails but when. While some advances have been made in guessing when a drive will fail, if the owners don't backup then no prediction will save them. Back to more drives. The engineering lesson is simple and hard at the same time. More parts equals lower reliability. Bob
