there are a lot of reasons for these issues beyond a bad product.
the last few 399 buck laptops are doing fine so what you have is a warranty issue or some malware has gotten into this one.
your post doesn't tell much but a recent owner was complaining of crashes and they were leaving the laptop on the bed.
oops.
