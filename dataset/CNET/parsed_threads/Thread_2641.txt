<s> Hi, Ive been trying to get a network up and running, in fits and starts, and the question that I have pressing at this point is: what do I need for a UPS? </s>
<s> I ran Cat6 to three bedrooms, dining room, and living room, Ive got my cable modem, telephone adapter, router and switch in my basement laundry room. </s>
<s> At this point I have two machines running XP Pro, one in the dining room and one in a bedroom, with a Linux machine in the living room that Im trying to learn a little bit from. </s>
<s> I got gigibit cards in all three, but they are not yet on speaking terms with each other. </s>
<s> ANYWAY... Im thinking that I need a UPS, or maybe two? </s>
<s> I would like to have the equipment in the laundry room on one, at least the telephone adapter, but to have at least one computer on a UPS, wouldnt I need to have another one at a computer's location? </s>
<s> And Im thinking if I need two, I dont need the highest volt-amp or wattage rating, just enough for what Im running? </s>
<s> Thanks, any thoughts would be helpful! </s>
<s> in that an Uninterrupitble Power Supply (UPS) has little to do the Networking & Wireless Forum. </s>
<s> What's the connection? </s>
<s> Well my question though a little hidden, is there. </s>
<s> In case of power loss, I should have one at my phone adapter, correct? </s>
<s> I should also have one at any computer that I have in operation? </s>
<s> Do I need to go a more expensive high-end model, high va or go with a less expensive lower end one, and buy more than one model? </s>
<s> What brands are the best? </s>
<s> I described my setup to show what my situation is. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> I guess a better question might be: In what forum should this question be posted? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Just ask the question and don't hide what the intent of the question is. </s>
<s> Otherwise you see what happens. </s>
