you said you wanted to re-use the mobo later on, which you cant do if you want pci express.
ok, first of all, your original case is fine(antec), so i'd say no to the second one.
go with a socket 939 motherboard and get an amd 64 3000+ the amd will run quieter than the intel, which is what you should be looking for.
ram, 1gb of pc3200 (512mb x 2) i'd say at least a 300gb serial ata hard drive, for your recording tv.
i would go seagate as they are the quietest.
you can use onboard video, but i would look at an x300.
why?
because if your not gaming, why shell out money for a $$$ card?
also, x300's have only heat sinks instead of a fan which will make the computer even quieter.
you will also need a tv tuner.
