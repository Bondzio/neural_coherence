<s> Hi There One of my internal modems have broken and a friend has given me a ADSL external modem. </s>
<s> Can I use this modem for dialup or do I need broadband to use this modem on. </s>
<s> Thanks to all who answer this query. </s>
<s> Kindest Regards Tony B. </s>
<s> Nope, that's broadband alright. </s>
<s> You need a &quot;dail-up&quot; modem and internal types cost in the under $20 range, maybe even $10 for a real cheap one. </s>
<s> A freebie if brought at OfficeMax as a rebate $0 deal. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> www.newegg.com for cheap modems. </s>
<s> A clue was to see nowhere to plug phone line into as the cat 5 plug is too wide. </s>
