I have three computers, two of them have been networked already using a hub, but aren't connected to the internet. I also have another computer hooked up to the internet. If I have a router in between the internet and the non-networked computer, can I connect the hub and the router to connect the other two computers to the intrernet? Thanks.

The other computer and the internet connection are about 50 feet away. I probably will go the wireless route at some point, but for right now, I'd like to get something going.
