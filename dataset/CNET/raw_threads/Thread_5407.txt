Unfortunately, they have RAISED the price from the listed price when it first went on sale. It is now listed at $450. Oh, and remember that code that got you 10% off from a few weeks ago? It's expired. http://www.target.com/Transformer-Android-Tablet-TF101-A1-Memory/dp/B004U78J1G/ref=huc_ic_1_pn

I also bought the docking station from JR.COM for $109.00; they matched a price on another website. MOST SITES will ISSUE A REFUND OR CREDIT if you find a lower price from a LEGITIMATE MAJOR RETAILER within TEN DAYS (usually), online. They will NOT match prices on one of those Amazon.com 'back bedroom' stores or the like. I didn't pay for shipping and paid no sales tax to either retailer. You figure out how &lt;wink&gt;. This computer is THE BEST on the market so far and will upgrade FREE, to Android 4 a/k/a Ice Cream Sandwich/ICS when ASUS releases it (soon). Check out http://hothardware.com/Reviews/Asus-Eee-Pad-Transformer-Android-30-Tablet-Review/ and be aware this 32 gigabyte tablet (the TF101-B1) was rated #5/6 on Consumer Reports. Unless you have machismo issues you won't need anything more than a dual core tablet like this one, for the foreseeable future.
