<s> My Windows XP Pro shuts down fine...but instead of the computer shutting off it reboots from the initial black screen we all see at start which give you your primary master/slave and secondary master/slave read outs and tells you to &quot;delete&quot; in order to enter the Bios. </s>
<s> Also my power button does not work. </s>
<s> How can I correct this ? </s>
<s> i'd open up the case and make sure all the cables from the power button to the motherboard are connected properly as that may be causing a problem with itself turning back on. </s>
<s> also, scan for virus' and ad ware. </s>

<s> start when you loaded XP pro? </s>
<s> If so, I'd be surprised if XP supports the system (too old). </s>
<s> The 'press delete' message comes from the BIOS during POST so you can change the settings in the BIOS (i.e. </s>
<s> boot sequence). </s>
<s> It's supposed to be there. </s>
<s> If, however, this just started, XP's power management sub-system may be corrupted. </s>
<s> Fix: reinstall XP. </s>

<s> If none of this helps, maybe it's time to replace the whole machine. </s>
<s> You should be able to salvage a reasonable chunck of the old, and I do mean OLD, system. </s>
