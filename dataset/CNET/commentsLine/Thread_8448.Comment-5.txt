you dont have to buy a 2nd 2gb if youllonly be running 3, as thats as much as the 32bit os recognizes.
there are windows boot commands i believe as /maxmem you can use to manage ram size, but truthfully you dont need more then 2 gb.
your just bored looking for something to spend money on!
dont get more ram unless your desktop is a workstation, heavy on photoshop or 3d design, in which case youll probably want to upgrade your proc or gpu first.
