Hello, The BIOS of my FOXONN A7GM-S mobo won't detect my SATA HD ( Western Digital Caviar 160GB 7200 RPM 8MB Cache 3.0Gb/s).
It did detect a dvd SATA drive, so the sata cable and connectors appear to be working properly.
I've configured the BIOS, as far as I can tell, so that a SATA HD should be detected.
I have not installed the OS yet; it will be WINDOWS XP PRO.
Sure would appreciate any suggestions, Thanks!
