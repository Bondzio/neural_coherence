The PS2 port does not work. Well, I can use my USB mouse, of course, but I prefer to leave the USB port free for other things in the future. Anyway, when I called them this morning they said that I should send the machine in. No on-site warranty if they have to replace the motherboard (which seems likely). Of course, I do not want to do that. For one thing, I need the machine, and for another, they were a month late sending me the machine, so who knows when I will get it back if I mail it in. I really should never have done business with them again. The laptop I bought from them has bad speakers, and now I am afraid to send it in, since I may never see it again. Anyway, I am avoiding Hypersonic forever after this. I should also mention that the software they gave me for the external modem does not install properly for some reason, and I have yet to hear from them about that. I have made arrangements to make a formal complaint with the New York Consumer Protection Agency. Maybe that will get their attention. If anybody has any suggestions, please let me know.

It is always good to check about a company's &quot;on site&quot; warranty. Besides the New York Consumer Protection Agency, which I assume is like the Better Business Bureau (BBB), I would write a letter to the president of the company. Came across this old 2000 interview and this Mr. Fred Kohan may still be president. http://www.guru3d.com/interview/hypersonic-pc/index1.html
