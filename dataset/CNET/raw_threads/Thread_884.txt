You'll have some diskettes or CD that came with said drive and you'll have to use an OS that was supported by said software. Be aware that my memory is fuzzy on this old drive but the only reason to resurrect it is to get some old data from tapes and not to use it for backup. But that's your choice here. Bob PS. I think some versions of Linux support this drive without a driver hunt.

You may need to register but everything is free to d/l. I had a similar tape drive, maybe it was T3000 or T5000 but gave-up after it took soooooo long to back-up. tada -----Willy
