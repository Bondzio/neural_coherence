1.1.1	So when I plugin something with a hard drive connector.	St
1.1.2	My PC will not boot from its Windows partition.	St
1.1.3	I don't know if this is a BIOS setting that I don't want on or something else that is what I need help clarifying.	St
1.1.4	I have also built this PC in June so keep that in mind.	St
1.2.1	Can you tell more about &quot;will not boot from its Windows partition&quot; means?	St
1.2.2	And what it does?	St
1.2.3	And the relevant history from June until now.	St
1.2.4	Kees	St
1.3.1	I've run across home built PCs and folk seem to forget one of the SATA connection rules which is &quot;Place the boot drive on the lowest numbered SATA port.&quot; Later they add another drive and because they had the boot drive on a higher port number, they are perplexed why it doesn't boot.

1.3.2	Bob	St
1.4.1	Can you provide us more info?	St
1.4.2	And what do you mean by &quot;...I have also built this PC in June so keep that in mind&quot; Hard drive connector?	St
1.4.3	Are you referring to an external drive with an USB?	St
1.4.4	Anyways, I agree with R. Proffitt, make sure your primary (boot) drive is connected to 0 or 1 (lowest SATA ports).	St
1.5.1	If the DVD is IDE, then each IDE port on your MB supports 2 drives (master & slave) - the ribbon cable should have 2 connectors, so you can do that.	St
1.5.2	You may need to change jumpers on the devices so that 1 device is master & 1 is slave.	St
1.5.3	If the DVD is SATA, no you can't plug your IDE into the same cable.	St
1.5.4	A quick search shows 2 SATA ports and 2 IDE ports on that MB.	St
1.5.5	Unless you already have 4 IDE devices in use, you can attach to 1 IDE port or other.	St
