Awesome!
I've found out that my external hard drive is already using an NTFS system.
I managed to retrieve my files!!!
Now, would it be possible to reformat my external harddrive?
It's not showing up in My Computer or Disk Management (which actually crashes everytime I try to load, unless I unplug my external hard drive).
