Thanks for your advice.
I understood what you said and I went for a fix for Roxio ECDC 7 and software.
I uninstalled Windows XP Pro SP3, then updated SP2, then I uninstalled Internet Explorer 7 and it reverted to version 6 and I updated version 6 and then I did a clean uninstall of Roxio ECDC 7 basic.
Then while leaving my computer with Windows XP Pro SP2(updated)and Internet Explore 6(updated), I reinstalled Roxio ECDC 7 Basic from my Plextor DVD and everything has worked fine ever since.
I had to make a few adjustments as they came up, but none were real hard and now I can write to my all my optical drives with Roxio ECDC.
DrgToDsk works great again without a hitch.
Again thanks alot for steering me in the right direction.
