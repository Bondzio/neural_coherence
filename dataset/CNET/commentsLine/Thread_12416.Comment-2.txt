would be to attach a firewire dvd burner to your mac mini.
take a look at  for their line of external dvd burners.
they are really very inexpensive.
firewire is the connection of choice for the mac, don't go with usb.
getting an external will save you hours of tears and frustration and be very much cheaper than trying to find a dvd burner that both fits into the space available and is supported by the os.
the existing drive would have to be removed.
