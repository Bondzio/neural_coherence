I need a little clarification here.
The pair of computers that I am trying to network right now are both win2k, which I will ''rename'' Old and New (for this discussion) .
The New computer sees, opens, and transfers files to the Old.
The Old sees,but can not open the network because of the error of expired password (?).
Are you suggesting that I rename each computer the same name so that one computer is named ''Old'' and the other computer is named ''Old'' also??
I will retain the different urls, though.
A trial won't take long and if I've got you wrong then let me know.
Thanks
