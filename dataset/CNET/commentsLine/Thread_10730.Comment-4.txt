since that service is not disabled by default, are there any clues as to how it got turned off?
for example a recent machine i worked on had the usual trojan attack and what we finally had to do was save files and start over.
not that we couldn't fix it but at what price?
just like most of us when we take it to the shop there is a price per hour of work and at 4 hours just to get things all cleaned up and almost back to a normal windows the remaining items would take a call to microsoft and &quot;please hold&quot; and &quot;credit card please.&quot; i can't tell how the machine get to be this way.
