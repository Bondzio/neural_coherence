<s> I am guessing you are a DSL user. </s>
<s> DSL usually uses PPPoE software (PPP over Ethernet). </s>
<s> This gives you a login prompt using PPP. </s>
<s> PPPoE is considered a tunnel protocol. </s>
<s> You seem to have multiple virtual adapters when you should only have 1. </s>
<s> Try to uninstall your the software your ISP gave you and delete all of those virtual adapters. </s>
<s> Then reboot the computer and reinstall the software. </s>
<s> Or, buy a router for $50 and let it do the PPPoE for you. </s>
<s> You will benefit with a small performance increase and some security. </s>
<s> Worms and hackers will be probing the router instead of your PC. </s>
<s> If you buy a router you will not need the ISP software any more. </s>

<s> Thanks Skrall a lot!! </s>
<s> sorry... </s>
<s> I was not very specific... yes I have DSL and I do have a router!!! </s>
<s> actually we have 2 computers... and the other one that is connected &quot;with wire (LAN cable)&quot; to the router, has no problems at all... </s>
<s> Mine was connected wireless... and HAD no problems at all too!! </s>
<s> Now I disconnected the other PC and I trying to make the laptop work &quot;with wire (LAN cable)&quot;. </s>
<s> (at the beginning I thought it might be the wireless card, even though the computer receives perfect signal!!!) </s>
<s> I don-t know.... anyway... </s>
<s> I think my ISP didn-t give me any software, could that be? </s>
<s> the SW I installed was the one of the router... lynksys... </s>
<s> Thanks again!! </s>
<s> Please let me know if you thinks is something else!!! </s>
<s> PS. </s>
<s> why I have virtually adapters? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> I had kind of the same problem and somebody told me to check if my connection was bridged. </s>
<s> It was. </s>
<s> So I unbridged the connection and Voila! </s>
<s> I hope it helps. </s>
<s> By the way,I don't know anything about computers, I'm just &quot;brave&quot; and try to fix them. </s>
<s> Hi!! </s>
<s> Thanks for the tip... but what is that the connection is bridged?? </s>
<s> how can I &quot;unbrigdged&quot;? </s>
<s> Thanks a lot!! </s>
<s> Maria </s>
<s> go to show all my connections. </s>
<s> look to see if the connection that you are using to connect to the internet is bridged. </s>
<s> Normally it will say the name of the connection, the next line will tell you if is connected or not, followed for the word &quot;bridged&quot; or &quot;firewalled.&quot; If you see the word &quot;bridge&quot;, right click and look for &quot;unbridge connection.&quot; Click on it and the connection should unbridged by itself. </s>
<s> Good luck! </s>
