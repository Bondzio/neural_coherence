well this is going a little beyond my knowledge.
i have been learning alot as a result of this problem which is great.
anyway i probably could have gotten the fan off but i really didn't know what i was doing and was afraid of accidentally damaging something.
there are two levers that lock the fan in place atop the heatsink.
all i did was open the levers, found the the fan came loose but did not come right off and because i didn't know what i was doing i locked the fan back in place and tried to boot up.
even if i did something wrong at that stage it wouldn't explain the initial problem.
although it might have made matters worse.
i do not think that is the case.
i was trying to be very carefull.
as for the zif connector lever, i am not sure what this looks like.
the levers i was touching were about 1.5 inches in length, laying horizontally, one the top and one on the bottom of the heatsink(at least i think they were connected to the heatsink).
up until about a week ago i had no idea what a heatsink was.
