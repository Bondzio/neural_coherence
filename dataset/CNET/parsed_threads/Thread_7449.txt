<s> I want to continue to use most of my existing dell for my kids so I am going to purchase new drives. </s>
<s> I have a hard drive and memory alrady. </s>
<s> Before I push the button is this the best setup? </s>
<s> If possible get a case without a power supply and put a higher wattage quality power supply in it. </s>

<s> With side intake and added rear exhaust never a cooling problem. </s>
<s> Unfortunately I don't think that they offer them sans power supply. </s>
