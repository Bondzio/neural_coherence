hear much more details about this locking / unlocking of the HSF.
Describe exactly what you are &quot;unlocking&quot; and why you can't get the fan off.
Separating the HSF combo from the CPU should be simple, the heat sink compound may cause them to stick together a little but should still be easy to separate.
Also it is a combination of a heatsink and a fan.
Are you trying to remove the fan from the heat sink????
Any chance that you are unlocking the ZIF connector lever???
[zero insertion force] that allows the CPU to be put in or removed without any insertion force??
Had a case in the forums where someone was doing that and caused the CPU contacts to get burned due to poor contact because the lever was not locked.
