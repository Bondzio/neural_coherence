I have checked &quot;share files/drives&quot; on my PC to no avail. 1. My TV sees the computer in the network, however when I go to open it, I only get access to C/users/pictures/video, (the demo ones) that came with the PC. 2. I also do not have my audio and video, pics in the &quot;My Documents&quot; part of my C drive. 3. They are all on my D drive and I think there in lies the problem? How can I access my other drives so they will be accessible on my TV? Thanks for any info!

Also, many require us to install some DLNA server and that app (DLNA server) may only be coded to share specific folders. You can imagine the security types would go bonkers if a TV could see all files on your PC. Bob

I had to go into my network (click on the little house-windows 7) to the PC/media devices/&quot;media player&quot; and add the other drive and/or folders to the media player's &quot;library&quot;. Seems so simple yet I thought all I had to do was &quot;share&quot; the drive/folders I wanted to see on my TV. At least with my TV; it has to be in the PC's Media player library. The files are not physically in the library; they are just indexed, so to speak:)
