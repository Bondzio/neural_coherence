get a vga cooler if you have an extra slot, tigerdriect sells case fans in kits (comes with two or three fans) and get a really nice cpu cooler and apply new compound on your processor.
gaming is very hard on your pc components keeping them cool will help them last longer, if you don't you will have to spend another grand or more on a pc instead of $50 for cooloing supplies.
