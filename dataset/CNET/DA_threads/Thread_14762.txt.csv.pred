1.2.1	The neighbor 's netgear needed a firmware update , then he had to configure the wireless to turn it on and enter a network name .	St
1.2.2	That 's all I can offer .	St
1.2.3	I also have some Linksys WAP and another DLink WAP and those units underperformed until the FIRMWARE was updated .	St
1.2.4	In closing , make sure that the WAP and your Client are on the same RF Channel .	St

1.3.1	I just happened to have bought this router today , and was testing it with a Netgear usb adapter on my laptop .	St
1.3.2	I have to say setup was very easy , and when I as far away from the access point , I was still getting a good signal .	St
1.3.3	Are you using a Netgear adapter ?	Ques
1.3.4	I know , from what I 've read , that sometimes if you use a different manufacturer 's adapter , things go wrong .	St
1.3.5	And , as Bob said , there is a firmware upgrade .	St
1.3.6	I really like this router , but too slow for my needs , as I 'm always accessing my other computers , so I 'm returning it .	St
1.3.7	Otherwise , it was great just surfing the net .	St
