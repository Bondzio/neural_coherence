hi, we can't keep the wireless connection working on this pc: hp m1270n windows xp sp2 ie6 sp2 lan - linksys wireless-b pci adapter wmp11 isp - grapevine connection status shows limited or no connectivity.
this is the main pc: hp m11297c windows xp sp2 ie6 sp2 lan - linksys router 802.11b sbc dsl - speedstream 5360 isp - sbc yahoo i went to linksys' site and used their quick connect program and got it working but it loses it again.
have done this several times.
if i use linksys program should i disable the windows wireless program?
there seems to be a conflict between them, maybe?
or is it better to use one over the other?
please keep in mind that i'm a novice at this but will follow instructions.
if i left anything out let me know.
