Floppies are notoriously unreliable.
Certainly not suited for long-term storage.
But a good (albeit somewhat oldfashioned, slow and low capacity) way to transfer files between machines that don't have Internet or USB.
All you can try: read the diskette on your laptop and see if that recognizes it.
That's not impossible, although unlikely.
Then transfer the data using mail or USB-stick.
This is the umpteenth (if not more) proof that having data on one place only is an invitation to the gods of IT to destroy it and lose it.
