1.1.1	Some how I wound up with a small square in the middle of the monitor display .	St
1.1.2	Its a samsung monitor on a windows media center ( older model ) computer running xp .	St
1.1.3	Need to know how to get rid of it	St
1.2.1	Hit the & quot ; start & quot ; button of the windows and then type , DXDIAG .	St
1.2.2	Allow it to run its tests , if they report or still show that square area is present with no error to report , then you have either a true h/w fault .	St
1.2.3	The quick test is to unplug the monitor from PC and then the OSD ( reset ) testing or simply access it .	St
1.2.4	Once there check the setting or review them .	St
1.2.5	If the small square still appears then some fault is present with the display itself .	St
1.2.6	If it goes away once you unplug , then returns after you reconnect to PC , then maybe some driver or s/w issue .	St
1.2.7	If there was some recent video upgrade or display issue and you tried to correct , then the problem appeared , undo that work .	St
1.2.8	You may try using the system restore feature in such a case .	St
