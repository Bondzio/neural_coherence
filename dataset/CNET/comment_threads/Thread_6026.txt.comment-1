I'm living temporarily in an apartment complex where one of my neighbors has thoughtfully installed an open WiFi access point, which I am happy to use.
But it doesn't work all the time.
Sometimes it's fine, and sometimes there's no signal at all.
(But even if I get no reception in my apartment, I know the transmitter is on because if I take my laptop down the hall, it picks up the neighbor's signal loud and clear.)
Is there a stronger *receiving* antenna that I can install in my apartment so I can always pick up the neighbor's signal?
All the repeaters and extenders I see advertised seem to apply to the sender's location.
What, if anything, can I do as the receiver?
