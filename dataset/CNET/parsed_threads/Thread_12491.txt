<s> Can anybody give me any advice at all on what to do, this is my situation. </s>
<s> I bought a Linksys wireless router about 4 months ago and it worked fine, i used it to get the internet on my laptop. </s>
<s> But then, I think it was when I installed McAfee, that the internet stopped working on my laptop. </s>
<s> I tryed taking McAffe off and putting it back on, i tryed resetting the router, i tryed repairing the coneections and checking the settings but i have no idea what to do now. </s>
<s> The router is a &quot;Linksys Wireless-G Broadband router Model-WRT54G&quot; Any help would be very helpfull. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> It sounds like the McAfee firewall is blocking your access. </s>
<s> If you still cannot connect, try an ethernet cable to the Linksys router and see if you have a connection. </s>
<s> If you have a connection to the Linksys router, try updating the firmware and Broadcast SSID. </s>
<s> Use WPA security. </s>
