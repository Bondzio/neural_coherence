1.1.1	sometimes i switch my mouse and keyboard ps 2 plugs from one pc to another.	St
1.1.2	every time i move them from pc 1, when i go back and plug them into the sockets on the back of the pc, i have to uninstall then re install the ps2 drivers in device manager.	St
1.1.3	then, the mouse and keyboard will work well until the next time i remove them.	St
1.1.4	i know with the situation as it is, its best not to remove them, and i know there's always the usb option.	St
1.1.5	i am curious though as to why i have to repeatedly unistall then re install the drivers.	St
1.1.6	its a bit of a pain to have to do again and again.	St
1.1.7	any thoughts?	St
1.1.8	thanks.	St
1.2.1	I have to restare my computer for a PS/2 devicce to work properly.	St
1.2.2	It has always been this way.	St
1.2.3	Get USB devices.	St
1.2.4	-or- Get a PS/2 to USB keyboard-mouse adapter.	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
1.4.1	...the only other way to solve this is to by a KVM (Keyboard-Video-Mouse) box.	St
1.4.2	What KVM boxes do is provide constant power to the keyboard and mouse ports so that the PC never discovers that the devices are missing.	St
1.4.3	If your PCs are close by, having the KVM can be a distinct advantage because then you only need one keyboard, video display, and mouse for all of the computers.	St
1.4.4	Also, you never have to unplugged them!	St
1.4.5	The downside is that KVM boxes can be expensive if you get the really good ones.	St
1.4.6	However, that being said, you can pick up a 4-port box from NewEgg for about $40.	St
1.4.7	It might solve your problem and create a better solution for you.	St
1.4.8	Good luck!	St
