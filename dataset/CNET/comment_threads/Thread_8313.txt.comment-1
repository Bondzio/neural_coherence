I have a IBM thinkpad i-series.
It has 6GB hdd which is not reliable as it makes noise and has more than 2000 bad sectors.
I have a sound knowledge of PC hardware and I think I can change the HDD but i dont know how to open the laptop case.
Need step by step help regarding my this problem, Please.
Thnaks !
