My computer is about 3 years old and this is the first time I'm replacing hardware (this graphics card)... http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814141026 That being said, I've only got a 250W PSU, which is awful. Can I run this card or will a PSU be necessary... BTW, I don't plan on over-using this computer (I've got a high end laptop I can play games with). So if a PSU upgrade really isn't necessary, I don't want to buy and install a new one. Also, if you think i should upgrade can you recommend me a certain Wattage to upgrade to? And price range? Maybe a URL link?

Don't buy cheap, you will be unhappy in the long run. A namebrand will be fine in the 400W range, like Antec or Enermax, etc.., so shop again at NewEgg or other online shop. tada -----Willy
