<s> I need to buy an external firewire-800 hard disk with at least 0.5TB, but I've never did this before. </s>
<s> What are the best reliable options? </s>
<s> Things to consider: - My first choice would be a 3.5'' 2TB portable USB powered compatible with any OS (some HD comes with software and I don't mind if mine does not) - but I couldn't find any (that would ship to Brazil)! </s>
<s> - First thing is portability - no AC power, small size, things like that - but I'm willing to give that up for a good priced with 2TB. </s>
<s> - Second and last, but not least, is again warranty and reliability - this is more a question if I should go local rather than international shipping. </s>
<s> - I'm thinking about those two opposite options right now: http://eshop.macsales.com/item/Other%20World%20Computing/MEQM7500GB16/ http://www.amazon.com/Western-Digital-FireWire-External-WDBAAJ0020HSL-NESN/dp/B002RL8J12/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1266077647&amp;sr=1-1 </s>
<s> Sorry, I never thought USB ports had enough power for 3.5 inch drives. </s>
<s> Maybe there is someone to sell such but the word &quot;FAIL&quot; comes to mind fast. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Yeah, I wrote 3.5 but I meant 2.5 My bad. </s>
<s> Plus, I'm still researching it and when I wrote it, I didn't know there is no 2.5 bigger than 620. </s>
<s> If there really isn't yet. </s>
<s> So you can tell I'm very newbish at this. </s>
<s> http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=2542S&cat=CSE for example BUT it doesn't work until I use some dual USB cable to get enough power for it. </s>
<s> I won't discuss international shopping in depth. </s>
<s> It's all about many things such as no warranty, trust (none), import fees, taxes and at the end the story is usually told that it was not worth the trouble. </s>

<s> &quot; at the end the story is usually told that it was not worth the trouble.&quot; I'm taking this in deep consideration. </s>
<s> I kinda agree with it, but it's good to have more opinions in the same side to put things into perspective. </s>
<s> In specific, from the research I've been doing, this is probably true for hard disks. </s>
<s> I mean, I don't know any tech place claiming to fix RAM memory, for instance, or pen drives - they just are able to recover the data in the rare case you need to. </s>
<s> Hard disks just almost seem like are made to break sooner or later. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
