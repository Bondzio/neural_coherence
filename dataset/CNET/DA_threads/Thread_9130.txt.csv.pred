1.1.1	I've got a desktop and a notebook that I'm trying to network.	St
1.1.2	Got the internet sharing working fine, but I'm still having problems with file sharing from the laptop to the desktop (can't even &quot;see&quot; the laptop, but I can ping it).	St
1.1.3	Currently, I have it setup so both computers use the router as the access point for the internet and for file transfer.	St
1.1.4	Would it be &quot;better&quot; to set up an ad-hoc network with the laptop connecting to the desktop and using the desktop to share its internet connection?	St
1.1.5	In my n00bie mind, I tend to think that this setup would have better results as far as success with file sharing.	St
1.1.6	Any thoughts?	St
1.2.1	Filesharing can be problematic for those that installed a firewall before they got the filesharing working.	St
1.2.2	ADHOC will not work any differently.	St
