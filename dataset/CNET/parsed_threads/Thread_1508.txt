<s> Hello, I have a network which shares the resources of my iMac with other computers around my home. </s>
<s> This is done through the Mac's airport 802.11b card. </s>
<s> As you may know, its range is limited and I wish to extend it. </s>
<s> I have an airport express and base station unit but I don't know how to configure them to extend the range of my network. </s>
<s> Many thanks. </s>
<s> Linksys makes a nice range externder. </s>
<s> I like it since you plug it in the wall socket and .... push the button to make it work. </s>
<s> No manual to read. </s>

<s> 1. </s>
<s> Read the Manual, it have enough information... or go their website. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Plug in your Airport express to the electrical outlet.. 3. </s>
<s> Run the Airport express assistant... choose connect to existing network... that's it .. </s>
<s> Hi Melati, when I plug in the airport express unit I always get the flashing yellow light which means that its out of range or something's not right. </s>
<s> Anyway when I run the airport express assistant it says that it can't find an existing network. </s>
<s> This is weird since on my PC there clearly is a network yet it doesn't show up on the Mac. </s>
<s> I'm puzzled as the manual is no help at all. </s>
<s> Ta. </s>
<s> Press the small button for a few secong 'while' pluging in into the power. </s>
<s> Then try to connect the AE to the router using a cable(RJ45).. then run the AE assistant .. and choose connect to existing network... then turn it off and disconnect the cable... then turn it on and try... </s>
