i just purchased an 80gig/ seagate7200.7 barracuda ultraata, shunted for cable select out of box.
my dell 8200 already has a master 40 gig hd most likely cable select setting and the 80 gig new, was recommended by dell as replacement.
i want to install the 80gig hd new as a slave.
my two questions are: can i do this as simply as installing hardware and turning on the comp?
would it be better to make the old 40gig hd, the slave?
are slave drives slower to access or something?
both internal drives also and i have the right mountings and plugs, for two inside.
