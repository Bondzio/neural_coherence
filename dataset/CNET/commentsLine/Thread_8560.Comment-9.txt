simply put, yes, you can turn your old computer into a dvr with a lot of work, and yes, you will be able to record most of your channels, but it will only be in 480i (stdv) or 720p (hdtv) depending on the channel, and you will not be able to record any channels that require a cablecard (i.e.
discoveryhd, hbo|hd, etc).
basically, when you put together the system, make sure your tv tuner card supports astc (digital broadcast), and simply try out your channels.
some will work, some won't.
i wish you luck.
