He refuses to buy a digital camera and I respect his decision. Now. He wants to be able to look at 35mm negatives and slides. So that is a feature that the scanner must have. He is also rather craving when it comes to quality (and so am I. That's why I have little, but good stuff). He has been looking around the web for a Scanner and asked me today if the Epson Perfection 3170 Photo was a good scanner. Since I have no clue about scanners, I can't tell him. So I ask you all the following: What scanner should he get? He has a budget (apparently... LOL!) of about $200. He wants a high quality scanner wth high resolution, but within his budget which is mentioned below. I have been looking at Canon but cannot find anything that is really better than the Epson that I mentioned and linked to when it comes to features and quality. Do you know of anything better in that price range ($175-$250)? .

Mine, as do many, come with adapters and software to scan slides and negatives. My camera is a 30 year old Nikon F2 and I, too, have eschewed the purchase of a high end digital. When one gets picky, there is still no comparison in quality between digital an traditional film images in that the later deposits information at the level of individual molecules so &quot;megapixels&quot; are still a relatively coarse measure. I have attempted to use the scanning adapter with much disappointment. The best of my shots are reducted to &quot;Instamatic&quot; quality doing this. I have found that local photo shops with professional film scanners do a far better job but still cannot render decent quality to fit my desire. I guess my advice is, unless your brother is willing to accept severe degradation to get into a lower price range, he may as well get a decent scanner for everyday use and not as a slide and negative copy device. Nikon, Minolta, and others make film scanners and these can run quite high but will produce &quot;Ok&quot; results that can be manipulated with photo editing software but never appease a perfectionist. Sorry to paint a less than rosy picture and to be so verbose but I have been this route and it's a muddy one.

Some companies make Slide scanners that just do slides and they do excellent jobs. Others make slide out trays that are in the middle of the table top scanner that do good jobs. The ones that sit on the top and use a mirror type device and not a light above the image just don't do that good a job. Something like the Microtek I900 would do a good job with slides...but it costs over $500. http://www.microtekusa.com/smi900.html

In Vancouver, BC a shop with one of the most expensive Nikon Cool Scan (scanners) I've seen had a reasonable 1 buck charge per slide to your media to scan as some very high DPI. There was some 20 slide minimum... While you may think 1 buck was high, considering the price of the scanner, it was a great way to not have to buy such an expensive device. Bob

10523	8	28821	330745	330182	R. Proffitt	7/13/04 8:44 AM	1.08970824E12	At that price.	I agree that he won't be happy with the results if all is as stated in this discussion. Bob

There is just now way to give an all around &quot;thumbs up&quot;. If scanning printed pictures is important, any high resolution scanner touting photo ability should serve well. The scanned image will still be somewhat degraded from the original and I would not use it for enlargement purposes. Most people will probably think the results are excellent but a real photo buff will see the flaws. I say this because I did a lot of darkroom work in the past processing film and making enlargements. I have seen what can be produced and gotten spoiled. 200 bucks might be worth the risk and a lesson. Go for it and give a report back. It may just be a matter of personal taste and there is no arguing that.

We don't talk about a professional photographer, but a person who has it as a hobby and takes quite a few pictures/month and wants to have them transferred to his computer thru negatives/slides. What I am a little worried about is what was said before that it doesn't do a good job at all on slides. Does the same go for negatives? And if so, what is the bad part? I understand it can't possibly compete with a professional scanner or what is being used in a photoshop. I doubt my brother is looking forward to that either, but he obviously wants a fairly good scanner for negatives and slides... If I call up EPSON and talk to them, is there any critical questions that I should make? I mean about how slides and negatives come out... .
10523	11	28821	334603	329194	Charlie Thunell PL&T	7/16/04 1:15 AM	1.0899405E12	I just read up on it...	and see that the Dynamic range or optical density is the most important thing when it comes to scanning slides or negatives. They say (at several sites) that 3.2 is the minimum required for acceptable quality. The epson I have looked at has an OD of 3.4 and the maximum is 4 (all scanners range from 0-4 where 4 is the best AFAIK...). That said, it sounds as if that Epson 3170 could do a pretty decent job and maybe even a good job! Just my thoughts, but feedback is always nice...

10523	13	28821	335829	334584	Steven Haninger	7/16/04 7:04 PM	1.09000464E12	Re: He may as well do that...	I doubt you will get a lot of hits from actual users of this scanner who have tried the slide/negative feature and compared this to results from dedicated devices that professional facilities have or even from high end digital cameras. Your original post left me with the feeling that your brother was more than just a snapshooter but the extent of his expectations were not quite clear. This is what I based my reply on. I have another brand (HP) with a scanning adapter. I can scan my negatives for &quot;free&quot; rather than have my rolls processed into CD digital images but the quality of the later is far superior in sharpness but does not produce images close to photo enlargements made on photo paper and processed in photo chemicals. You may know best how serious your brother is. I can't offer subjective advice on this scanner but only in the area of the scanning to printing processes that I have performed. A lot will be in the software as well. There is quite a difference in negative and slide film and, with negatives, the software must compensate for many filter layers in the film which is not exactly flat. It's not just hardware but the software. It's sort of neat to be able to do this and I will use it when amateur quality is ok but not to showcase a photo endeavor. Bob's test drive suggestion is perfect if this can be done but not always practical because the test drive might mean laying out money and then attempting a return of the product if it was not satisfactory. If this scanner is optimized for photo use only and your brother wants its for general use too, there could be a tradeoff. 200 bucks isn't a bad price though.

There are plenty more camera reviews than scanner ones so advice should not be so hard to find. I would love to get a good digital to supplement my 30 year old Nikon but realize the digital is a piece of &quot;throw away&quot; technology at some point while the SLR has already outlived generations of such. It should be a good addition to a collection for a serious hobbyist. Whew!!! Great decision and now the search begins anew.
