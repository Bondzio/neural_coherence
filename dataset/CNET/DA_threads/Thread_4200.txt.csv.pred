1.2.1	To stay within the forum discussion of hardware , you would add more RAM and move to a larger disk .	St
1.2.2	However in the Computer Help or the OS Forum , they may suggest deleting old files , and streamlining the OS .	St
1.2.3	But since this is a hardware forum and you did n't tell what OS , I 'm left with the hardware suggestions .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	The statement & quot ; computer is running very slow & quot ; seems to imply that it ran faster at some earlier time .	St

1.6.2	HOWEVER , RAM and hard drives are not related in any way .	St
