Your prior post did indicate you didn't follow my suggestions.
But it doesn't matter.
I also noted that HP often has a &quot;cleaner&quot; software to remove the traces of the scanner software so you can start over.
I leave it to you to find it.
Just FYI, again, this is just someone thats done this many times and doesn't get a dime for offering direction to the issue.
Sorry, no step by step.
