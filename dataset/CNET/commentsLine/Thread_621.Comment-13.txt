here's what i did: i disconnected the computer.
i removed all memory sticks, old and new.
i restarted the computer without the memory sticks installed.
i immediately turned the computer off.
disconnected the computer.
i installed then new memory sticks into the dimm slots where the old memory sticks were.
booted up fine, then.
no beeps.
monitor works.
everything [so far] seems to be running just great.
apparently, my computer will not allow two different kinds of memory installed....despite what the geek squad down at my local best buy told me.
thanks
