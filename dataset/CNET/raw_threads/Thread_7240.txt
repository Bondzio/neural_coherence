I don't need any gamers stuff, but a monitor that has good contrast and brightness. I am thinking of this one. Does anyone have any experience from this monitor? Or even opinions. I am going to get it a little cheaper through work... Thanks.

Your link said that they were out of stock. I also make certain that the one that I buy has a three year warranty. Here's a link to four pages of monitors. http://www.newegg.com/Store/SubCategory.aspx?SubCategory=20&name=LCD-Monitors . Don't get confused when you note that the X inch Wide screen monitors are lower priced than the regular X inch monitors. The wide Screens have considerably less viewing area, thus the basic screens are lower price.

Unless you have obvious resolution, refresh or performance issues, its a matter of support and price. Got to someplace like Frys, CompUSA or Best Buy and see which ones look good to you. I've been very pleased with I-Inc monitors from www.TigerDirect.com at 1/2 that price and use them in dual monitor mode at work, both wide screen and normal. About $149 - $169 after a mail-in rebate (usually).
