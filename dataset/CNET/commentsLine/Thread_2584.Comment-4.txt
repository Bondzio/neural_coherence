so whichever monitor u want...or the 2nd to the last one the a1350n...unless u want the tv tuner which would be the last one then.
i agree with video card upgrade needed for any of them.
imo...i would suggest the emachines t6216, athlon 64 3200+, 512mb ram, win.
xp home.
upgrade to 1gb of corsair value ram 70 dollars, put in better psu 80 dollars, and 6800gs 160 dollars.
to total of around 800-900 dollars.
