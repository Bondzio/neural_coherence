i was so stupid, i didn't realize that the colors on the keystone jack were for the wires.
well, thanks for helping me.
i am actually using one of the cables for the internet connection right now!
now all i need is a gigabit router and some cat6 keystone jacks and i'm ready to surf (as fast as my isp allows, which is currently slower than cat5e, but maybe some day .
