Definitely, no matter what, DON'T EVER PUT WIRES BEHIND THE MOTHERBOARD!!!
Most motherboards have little points from the solder spots on the back side.
I have seen cases where those points actually penetrated the wires and caused a short-circuit which burned the mobo and the processor!
The only recommendation is to tape loose wires together.
For example, the 4 wires which bring power to various components can be taped to form a single cable.
Use different colors for identification.
