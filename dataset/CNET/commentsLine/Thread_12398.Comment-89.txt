i wouldn't recommend an hp printer for the invite biz.
i had one for a brief period of time and the quality of the printout and the color isn't quite up to par.
you want to make sure to look for a printer with a straight pass through as well, so that you don't end up curling your card stocks.
i have the 8560 now and on any metallic media the ink just scratches off, so until they perfect that type of ink, i would stick with the laser.
i am getting a 6360 to try out next week.
i will post a review.
good luck on your search!
