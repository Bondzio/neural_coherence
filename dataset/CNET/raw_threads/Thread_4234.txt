4052	0	258943	2554595	NR	stevenror	8/2/07 2:56 PM	1.18606656E12	1394 NOT WORKING CORRECTLY	i've been having probelm with my JVC camcorder since i upgraded to vista. (no problem with it when i was using XP). during my research i came across microsoft Article ID : 927827. while reviewing the workaround i got has far as the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{6BDD1FC1-810F-11D0-BEC7-08002BE2092F} however i can not find &quot;ControllerInstance&quot; to finish the workaround. why???? could this be causing my problem??
