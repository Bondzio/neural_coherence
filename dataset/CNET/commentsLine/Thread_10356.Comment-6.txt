strange choice of words... i just helped someone setup a wireless extension using a product they call &quot;bullet&quot;.
mostly we used them because they were cheap .
we use some huge 24db gain antenna on both ends (very much overkill since we only were going about 700ft).
we ran them in bridge mode for his requirement but they can run in ap mode.
this is a link to a site that sells them.
i have purchased things from this company before but this link is more because this site sells many type and brands of devices.
some things are cheaper and some more expensive.
so far i have not had issues with the bullet products.
because you can run them in so many modes they tend to require a little more reading.
for your case you may want to run them in extender mode although i have not run them in that exact configuration.
be aware these use the standard n connectors used on professional equipment.
you will need adapters to attach your antenna.
also notice the really cheap ones run only b and g. if you look around the first link you will see there are many many option to solve this issue.
