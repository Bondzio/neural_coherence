thanks for responding.
this is a laptop and i believe the modem is a software modem (agere) and is part of the motherboard.
i would say it is a hardware problems except it was there saying it wasn't attached to a com port.
i deleted it thinking it would refind itself but it didn't.
now it doesn't show anything when i look in the control panel-phone and modems.
i reloaded the driver for the modem.
i tried to add a com port and it picked com3 which leads me to think it was also removed.
i got a yellow exclamation even though i changed the resources to reflect no conflicts.
any help is appreciated.
