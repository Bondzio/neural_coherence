<s> I recently purchased a LCD monitor (Dell UltraSharp 1905FP) which has both DVI-D and VGA ports. </s>
<s> The video card on my PC is ATI X300 which also has both ports. </s>
<s> Which connectors should I be using between the PC and monitor? </s>
<s> Should I use the newer DVI-D connection or the serial VGA connection? </s>
<s> Is there any advantages to using one over the other? </s>
<s> Please advise. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> This uses a digital signal. </s>
<s> Don't spnd a lot on a DVI-D cable. </s>
<s> Some stores will charge you $40-75. </s>
<s> You can get them at Newegg or Tigerdirect for $20. </s>
<s> Make sure you get the length you need. </s>
<s> is better in terms of clarity and hence always preferred to VGA ones. </s>
<s> My kids desktop looks better on VGA. </s>
<s> We had it connected with HDMI and for some reason it looks better on VGA. </s>
<s> All this means is that you should try each option. </s>
