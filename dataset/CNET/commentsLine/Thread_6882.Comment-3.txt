thanks for the help.
i already seen the adapter side of things.
basically, they offer use with an apple cable, since i have no cable its another expense.
the costs are getting to be heavy and thus won't go that route.
i can buy a working pc monitor for the costs of all the cable(s)/adapters, again, thanks -----willy
