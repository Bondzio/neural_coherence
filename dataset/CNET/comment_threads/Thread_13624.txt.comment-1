I have problem with my Dell Inspiron 9200 Laptop.I couldn't start it and when I tried harder, pressing the power key a bit longer it started,but after few seconds I saw a smock comming from behind.I tried to start it with and without battery - no result.When I took it for repair they said me the problem most probably was in the moherboard (it is gone and it is no use to do something, too costly).
So I have to buy a new laptop.Unfortunately a disk was left inside and I don't know how to take it out when the laptop is not switched on.Please give me an advise how to do this.Thank you in advance.
