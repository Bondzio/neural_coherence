it was 1980 or 81 and i forked over $999 for an all-in-one keyboard/cpu/monitor with no storage except a cassette tape recorder (sold separately).
it came with a whole 16k (not meg) of memory and a black and white tv tube for the monitor.
i maxed it out with 48k of ram, added two 180k single-side 5 1/4&quot; floppies, a serial port and &quot;level 2 basic&quot; (wow, level 2 no less) for an added cost of about $1200.
that doesn't count the $850 dot matrix printer just in case i wanted to print something from a word processor (oops, i didn't have one of those).
i bought mine while i was in the navy living on the ship.
i rented a motel room for the weekend and started learning basic.
luckily i had somewhere to store it onboard.
the most use i got from it was learning to program and cruising the &quot;bulletin boards&quot; with my super fast hayes smartmodem 300 (thats 300 baud).
those were the days when nothing was compatible with anything else.
the good thing about that is there weren't any viruses either.
