<s> I have a Presario 5000US and would like to change the factory installed motherboard with a new motherboard/CPU combo upgrade. </s>
<s> Does anyone know a good motherboard that would be compatible with this Compaq model. </s>
<s> I am told there can be issues with power supply hook-ups and alignment. </s>
<s> I can't spend a fortune right now and this looked like a good way to upgrade without buying an entirely new system. </s>
<s> Everything else on the unit is up to date. </s>
<s> It is a standard A-Slot, ATX board with a 750 MHz Duron chip. </s>
<s> Any help would really be appreciated. </s>
<s> The HP site wasn't a big help? </s>
<s> Thanks, Dave </s>
<s> The power supply was only sized to power what HP/Compaq provided. </s>
<s> i.e. </s>
<s> If you upsize to some over 1 GHz CPU and such, then you have to upsize the power supply to match. </s>
<s> http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/02q4/021021/ is a starting point to see that you want to avoid the 350 Watt power units and skip right to 450 to just remove this from your issue list. </s>
<s> Another issue is heat. </s>
<s> The HP/Compaq case was again for a 700 or so MHz CPU with so many Watts to let so much heat out. </s>
<s> You'll likely to have to rework the metal to fit another case fan too. </s>
<s> Power tools and tin snips are handy for this work. </s>

<s> Consider getting a new case and moving the hardware you want to keep to it, that may be a lot easier than trying to update an old case with a new motherboard. </s>
<s> I appreciate the quick reply. </s>
<s> After doing some more research I was starting to think the same thing. </s>
<s> Switching everything over to a new case sounds more like a better option. </s>
<s> Thanks Again, Dave </s>
<s> Thanks, I appreciate the all the quick replies. </s>
<s> I may just take all the hardware I have a switching it to a new case. </s>
<s> It's kind of like remodeling an old house. </s>
<s> It costs more to rework the old than to just build new. </s>
<s> All my other hardware is new except for the old motherboard and CPU. </s>
<s> I'll have to change RAM types however. </s>
<s> I guess that's what E-Bay is for. </s>
<s> Thanks, Dave </s>
<s> Hi might want to try this site for memory might cast a little more but you will have what you need. </s>
