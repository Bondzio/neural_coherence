hi, i just bought an emachine t6212.
it came with 512 mb ram, (2x256).
i realize that 128mb of that is shared video ram, so i just ordered 2x512 corsair value select ram from newegg.
i read on another topic that it is suggested that the original ram be put in the current empty slots and the newer, larger ram be moved to the first 2 slots.
can anyone help me out and tell me if this is true and why it is true?
?
