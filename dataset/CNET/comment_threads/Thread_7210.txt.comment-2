If you were happy with the old eMachine, get another one.
Newer ones are in the entry level and offered at $400 or less.
While you may need to wait when a deal pops-up, now is a good time as the &quot;school sales&quot; are happening.
You can get your hands on decent systems, mutli-core cpu, std.
ram, large HD, and warranty woo to include the Win7 OS.
That's a good bargain in my book for those looking for a deal.
Compared to building an &quot;upgraded PC&quot; you may find the costs similar but compare anyways.
