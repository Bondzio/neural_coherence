1.1.5	suggestions ?	Ques
1.1.6	feedback ?	Ques
1.1.7	what may have caused this ?	Ques
1.1.8	I thought it might be an overheating problem so I have an ice pack on it !	St

1.2.1	If so , send it back for a replacement .	St
1.2.2	Who knows why drives fail .	St
1.2.3	Some go for years without a problem , others last a couple of months .	St
1.2.4	If you are trying to recover data , other than from your backup , the ice pack ( or overnight in the freezer ) has been known to work for long enough to safe some data P	St
1.3.1	Glad to hear there was something to my desperate act of putting an icepack on the drive !	St
1.3.2	Also I ran TechToolPro 4/Tests/Volumes on the drive .	St
1.3.3	Funny , after I ran that then I hit the play button again ( running the Volume Structures test again to rebuild the drive ) .	St
1.3.4	That did n't solve the matter , but I think it prepped it so that when I ran the latest version of Disk Warrior next , it finally was able to rebuild the drive .	St
1.3.5	Alas !	St
1.3.6	It now shows up on Disk Utility and passed the repair test there ( oh good thing we all have that lame utility ! )	St
1.3.7	It repaired the fixed volume just fine !	St
1.3.8	I 'm dragging off any valuable files off of the Duo Pro now and yes , sending it back to SimpleTech where they said they will replace it .	St
1.3.9	They said when the drive starts ejecting itself it 's big time trouble .	St
1.3.10	I guess I 'm lucky to have recovered it at all .	St
1.3.11	Thanks again for the feedback and tip , folks !	St
