I would like to connect the harddrive from my previous PC (running XP) to the harddrive for my new PC (running Vista). After connecting the harddrives, how would I go about formatting the secondary harddrive? Do I simply right-click the drives that appear and click format? After formatting, how do I partition new drives for the harddrive? Thank you. Any help will be greatly appreciated.
