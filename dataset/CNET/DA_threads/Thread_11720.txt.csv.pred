1.1.1	I bought this product a few months ago and I have been presently surprised with how well it streams mp3 's and jpeg 's from a computer to my stereo and adjacent HDTV .	St
1.1.2	The only downside is that it will not stream AAC/mpeg4 files .	St
1.1.3	Accordingly , I have listed on eBay and I am going to get an iPod .	St
1.1.4	My question is , does anyone know of a mp3 wifi streaming device that also supports AAC file formats ?	Ques
1.2.1	There 's something patently false with this issue .	St
1.2.2	A & quot ; file & quot ; is a file .	St
1.2.3	If you can stream one file at so many bits per second , it matters not if it 's a MP3 or other .	St
1.2.4	What you may be writing about is the SOFTWARE PLAYER that came with the WMA11B .	St
1.2.5	There are far too many legal issues with audio and video that Linksys may have had an issue with not getting a clear signal from patent holders to implement & quot ; everything. & quot ; Changing hardware is not the issue here .	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
1.3.1	Bob - Thanks for that info as from a common sense perspective I agree with you .	St
1.3.2	Are you aware of where i could go to get some type of a & quot ; software patch & quot ; and/or upgrade that would allow me to stream the AAC format to the Linksys player ?	Ques
1.3.3	Linksys does not currently offer any available upgrade .	St
1.3.4	In any case , if the hardware functions , I would imagine that eventually a & quot ; software & quot ; patch would be available .	St
1.3.5	Alan	St
1.4.1	As I read and what I know , an issue is that such files can be protected content .	St
1.4.2	I 'd look for a converter from AAC to an open standard like MP3 or better yet ... OGG/Vorbis if that 's supported .	St
1.4.3	Your issue may be simply that you are NOT ALLOWED to play the AAC content on anything but what they let you .	St
1.4.4	http : //www.google.com/search ? & q=aac+copy+protection finds discussions about this .	St
1.4.5	And it backs up what I wrote about the software patent issues being most likely at the root of the problem .	St
1.4.6	The lesson I learned when PROPRIETARY formats with such unfriendly encoding arrived was to not use or endorse such .	St
1.4.7	Bob	St
1.5.1	After speaking with Linksys again this evening , they informed me that due to numerous requests from wma11b wireless media adapter customers , they are developing a solution that will enable AAC files to stream .	St
1.5.2	It will involve firmware upgrade and a software upgrade for the computer that houses the files .	Sug
1.5.3	It should be available within 6 months at the latest .	St
1.5.4	Also , saw on one of the chatrooms postings from your google link , a website for a player called & quot ; SlimMp3 & quot ; or & quot ; Squeezebox & quot ; which does utilize AAC in addition to mp3 formats ( http : //www.slimdevices.com/ ) .	St
1.5.5	Thanks again for the help .	St
1.5.6	alan	St
1.6.1	I wonder if AAC files from itunes will play ... Bob	St
