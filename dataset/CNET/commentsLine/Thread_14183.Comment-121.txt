... i have been maintaining computers for a career since 1963, when i enlisted in the air force.
i am now retired.
after 3 years, 10 months & 10 days of maintaining the computer systems (awcs) on f-101b & f-102a interceptors (some w/vacuum tubes!
), i hired on with honeywell field engineering for 7 years as a computer field (service) engineer.
i was laid off in 1974, went on to burroughs (now unisys), data general, c-3, inc. (mostly federal contractor), and ga technologies, inc., ending up as a technical training coordinator for radiation monitoring systems in nuclear power plants, for a total of 22 years.
most of the computers were called, &quot;mediums systems&quot;, but some were 8086's tied to dec vax'es by serial rs-232 lines in the end.
@ my (2nd) wife's insistence, i went back to school (i had 2 years of college b4 the air force) @ night & got an as, aa in business management in 1985, then went on to san diego state (sdsu) full-time for 2 years to finish a bs/ba in information systems in 1986. i eventually got a civil service job with the navy in 1988 here in san diego county as a computer specialist & retired in 2005 with 21 years as a gs-12 i.t.
specialist in systems/network administration/management.
my work was on concurrent/perkin elmer/masscomp medium systems & networked 286/386/486 pc's (self-taught).
i never would've made it thru sdsu w/o my mac: i bought a mac in &quot;the 1st 100 days&quot;, on march 6, 1984 after seeing the super bowl ad in january & have had 1 ever since.
it had 1 800/400 kb floppy drive, 256 kb of ram, no hd, a sharp b&w display, & an image writer dot-matrix printer.
it was the 1st computer that i could see any use for @ home.
i had turned down the opportunity to buy a full-blown apple iie clone in taiwan because i couldn't see what i would use it for!
i hooked my mac up to the internet with a 1200/300 baud modem and spent many an &quot;all-nighter&quot; doing assignments after the on-campus computer labs were closed.
in october, i will get the latest powerbook core 2 duo (or whatever) 15&quot; mactel laptop & pass this 15&quot; g4 mpb onto my wife (who is now using my 1996 g3 wallstreet).
i will max.
out the memory & get the largest/fastest hd i can for it, probably on the after market.
i am grateful that pc's have given me a career but having seen all of the headaches they cause users & maintainers over the years, i have always found that the macs gave me a much better experience & life.
i volunteer @ the local senior service center's computer lab teaching seniors how to survive with the computer of their choice -mac or pc.
i am even more excited about using a mac now that they run the unix/linux os underneath the gui, because that was the os i learned in 1988, and i like it a lot.
i may even use it on my new mactel powerbook in a partition!
but no windows, ever!!
