<s> Alright this is pretty weird (to me): I'm on the computer and the screen goes black. </s>
<s> I can hear the computer still running, though it's much quieter than normal. </s>
<s> I open it up, turn it back on, and see that none of fans (chipset, CPU, cooling) plugged into the motherboard's fan headers are spinning. </s>
<s> The motherboards's LED light still turns on and the hard drives still spin when I turn it on, so I know it's nothing to do with the power supply (it's less than a month old anyway). </s>
<s> I tried plugging the fans into the power supply, bypassing the mobo, using an adapter like this: http://home.comcast.net/~johngafnea/adapter.jpg When I did this, the fans all began working again, but the computer still wouldn't boot. </s>
<s> The LED lights would start, and the hard drives would spin, but no POST beeps would sound. </s>
<s> Is my mobo trash? </s>
<s> You have to tell us more ! </s>
<s> Mobo make, CPU type, etc. </s>
<s> Some mobo's will save your CPU by closing down if the CPU fan stops. </s>
<s> Let's hope that yours is one of them! </s>
<s> Roger </s>
<s> Sorry. </s>
<s> The motherboard is an ABIT KR7A (VIA KT266A [Socket A]) and the CPU is an AMD Athlon XP 1700+ (1.47 GHz). </s>
<s> Okay I disconnected and reconnected the ATX power supply cord to the motherboard and it seems to have fixed the problem; the fan headers are again working as normal. </s>
<s> Anyone know what causes this to happen in the first place? </s>
<s> if its new take advantage of your warrenty pack it up and rma it </s>
<s> You may have what some call, &quot;componet creep&quot;. </s>
<s> The off/on thus hot/cold operation of the system can cause wiring/harness, ICs, and/or cards some movement preventing a good contact. </s>
<s> One reason, I mention reseating cards and harness several times to break the metal-metal contact crust/tarnish plus fully reseat, same. </s>
<s> It happens from time to time, especially in systems that experience alot of heat build-up. </s>
<s> Just like a car after running a longtime, upon shutdown you notice the pinging/tweeking of metal as it cools. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> lol, once again Willy, very well spoken. </s>
<s> let the vendor deal with it! </s>
<s> I love your style! </s>
