Thanks for responding.
The system isn't built yet.
I ran across this conundrum while researching for my rebuild.
So, since I am responsible for whether or not things work together, I wanted to get some help with this before I spend a good chunk of money.
If a person could ever get a response from Asus, I'd ask them.
I sent them an email 2 years ago and haven't heard anything yet.
I guess the question is : What would the average computer genius use?
ECC or NON_ECC?
Uni
