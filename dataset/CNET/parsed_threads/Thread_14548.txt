<s> Hi there, I am running Windows XP Pro on my PC, Windows Vista on my laptop, and seem to be having issues regarding file sharring. </s>
<s> File sharring has worked in the past, however I am having trouble after some recent changes. </s>
<s> Both computers are on the same network. </s>
<s> I have installed LTTD on the Xp machine. </s>
<s> When I view network map on my laptop, I am able to see my desktop connected on the network. </s>
<s> When I go into network on my laptop however, I am not able to see the shared folders that I have on my Xp machine. </s>
<s> Also to add, when I am running Azureus on my desktop, I am able to see a media folder under networks on the laptop. </s>
<s> Any ideas as to why I cannot see my shared folders? </s>
<s> Thank You </s>
<s> Did you run the Network Setup Wizard? </s>
<s> Firewall? </s>
<s> What &quot;recent changes&quot;? </s>
<s> Yes. </s>
<s> Ran the Network Setup Wizard, and set both PCs on the same Workgroup. </s>
<s> Firewalls are turned off on both computers. </s>
<s> As to recent changes, I had done a system restore a few weeks ago, and since then have not been able to share files between the two. </s>
