Seeing as how I am a college student, money for the whole MB/processor/RAM at one time is going to take a while.
In the mean time I think I'll up the RAM to 768 and save for that exotic system of the future.
On a slightly different subject, if I shoot for a future price point, $2000 would pretty much get me the best processor/MB/RAM/Video at any point in time right?
