As such, few printers offer how much ram is in the printer. Can you share with the forum why this matters?

They also didn't want to comment on how it works either. About comparing the two Epson Workforce Pro 4540 vs HP Officejet Pro 8600 Premium, which one would you lean towards and why? My findings so far: according to just specs sheets the HP 8600 looks good but according to videos the Epson 4540 looks pretty good =\
