as you may suspect i'm a bit fearless since i would have a backup ready.
since you have another scanner, must this scanner be brought back?
and also look at what hp offered.
it's a &quot;basic&quot; driver so who knows (they don't tell and i don't own this scanner) if they enabled the backlight for the film accessory or not.
maybe this needs a test on another machine or you to learn if system restore on xp, vista is functional on your machine.
