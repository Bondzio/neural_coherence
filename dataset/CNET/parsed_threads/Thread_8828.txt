<s> Doesn't anyone else have the 126-button HP keyboard with the five CD/DVD player buttons along the top? </s>
<s> I have 5 buttons in my hand and need to know which one goes in what hole. </s>

<s> Thanks, Ernie, but mine's not the wireless one. </s>
<s> It's HP's P/N:5187-0341. </s>
<s> I can find many similar ones on eBay, but the photos don't have sufficient resolution to see the icons on the buttons. </s>
<s> I'm just going to run down to Best Buy or Costco and take a look at a similar keyboard. </s>
<s> Even HP can't help on this one; I just can't figure out why this is so hard. </s>
<s> Thanks again for trying. </s>
<s> It goes STOP REVERSE PLAY FORWARD EJECT </s>
