1.1.1	I have had absolutely no problem connecting with my friends ' wireless networks in the past on my Toshiba Sattelite A135 Laptop till recently .	St
1.1.2	This past Wednesday I was at a friend 's house and connected to his network , surfing the internet without incident .	St
1.1.3	However , I shut down to take the back cover off so I could show him where the RAM was located ( he had new RAM coming in the mail the following day and had never installed it before ) .	St
1.1.4	Although we did remove my RAM a couple of times , I doubt it has anything to do with the problem because I 'm not having any problems at home with my own wireles network connectivity .	St
1.1.5	But at his house , once I rebooted I could never reconnect to his network .	St
1.1.6	Today I had the identical problem at another friend 's house .	St
1.1.7	In each case their network was listed with a strong signal , but when I tried to connect received an error saying the signal was weak .	St
1.1.8	I have tried what little I knew to fix the problem , but got no where .	St
1.1.9	Wireless is something where my knowledge is very limited , so any help would be greatly appreciated .	St
1.2.1	to repair the connection .	St
1.2.2	Right click the wireless connection in the System Tray and click repair .	St
1.2.3	This will flush the IP address , restart the wireless card , and acquire a new IP address .	St
1.3.1	Yes , I actually tried that several times and it did n't fix the problem .	St
1.4.1	The other network was not setup per our forum sticky .	St
1.4.2	That is something like SSID not broadcasting and the next connect fails .	St
1.4.3	I ca n't explain why this does n't always work since you can imagine the number of times this comes up in the forum .	St
1.4.4	So here 's my advice .	St
1.4.5	Read the forum sticky on what we have found to work in most cases .	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	this may seem like a dumb question , but where is the forum sticky ?	Ques
1.5.2	I 'm not seeing it ( probably looking right at it )	St
1.6.1	http : //forums.cnet.com/5208-7589_102-0.html ? forumID=62 & threadID=264135 & messageID=2584349 It 's currently the first post in this forum .	St
1.6.2	If you had shared the setup details I may not have started with the forum sticky and thought of something else , but those details are not here ( settings , router make , model , version , firmware version , if the laptop works at a free wifi hotspot . )	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	was under the same cover and you accidentally disconnected an antenna lead ?	Ques
