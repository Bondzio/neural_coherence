<s> Currently unit is HP slimline s3100n with AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core 4000+ 2.10GHz, 2GB ram, 32 bit system. </s>
<s> Running Nvidia GeForce 6150 LE video card. </s>
<s> Video source is Sony camera HDR-SR7 60GB HDDD with AVCHD format. </s>
<s> Pininacle Studio's (running Plus V12) support told me I have to upgrade processor & video card for AVCHD format. </s>
<s> Pinnacle reccomends Core 2 Duo 2.6 GHz min. </s>
<s> and Nvidia 8800 (need 256GB or higher) My question is: What is the most effective upgrade without having to change out processors sockets, cooling fans, etc? </s>
<s> Your machine does NOT support such a change in CPU. </s>
<s> Also the video card rarely improves the speed of video editing so let's just say that the only exit is some entirely new machine or... Just use what you have. </s>
<s> It has all the right stuff to do this. </s>

<s> Suspect the SW would run just fine with a better video ... the only problem may be finding an 8800 series equivalent or better card with 256 RAM that doesn't require a more robust power supply. </s>
<s> Before going further, fully explore both upgrade and new PC options. </s>
<s> All things considered, it may be best to look at new PC (NOT A SLIMLINE) that meets or exceeds the spec. </s>
