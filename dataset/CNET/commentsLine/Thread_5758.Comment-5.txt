i don't see any issues.
the netgear router is the newer model of the one i am currently using.
additionally, i switch between wired and wireless on my laptop and have never experienced any issues, including the other two laptops also.
one is a gateway, one is a toshiba, the other an acer.
as far as setup goes, after going thru the learning curve, i find it somewhat moderate to set up.
the biggest issue is making too many changes at one time.
so my advice would be to take it one step at a time, make sure the last step implemented works properly, then proceed to the next step.
if all else fails, post here and you will get an abundance of great help to point you in the right direction.
don't get discouraged or frustrated, most of us have been there, done that, and will gladly help you out as best we can.
