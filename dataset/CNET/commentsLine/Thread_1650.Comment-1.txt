i'd love to get some thoughts on these components.
i like the total price point i'm at, though i could deviate if i can get a nice performance boost if i spent a little more(meaning ~$100 more) - intel core 2 duo e8400 3.0ghz 6mb l2 cache lga 775 65w dual-core processor  $189.99 -corsair dual channel twinx 2048mb pc6400 ddr2 800mhz e.p.p.
memory (2 x 1024)  $29 after rebate - gigabyte ga-ep35c-ds3r lga 775 intel p35 atx dynamic energy saver ultra durable ii intel motherboard  $139 -nzxt apollo black atx mid-tower case  $69.99 -ultra / x-pro / 600-watt / 135mm fans / atx / sata-ready / pci-e-ready / active pfc / energy efficient power supply  $89.99 -palit geforce 8800 gt super+1gb video card - 1gb ddr3, pci express 2.0, sli ready, (dual link) dual dvi, hdtv, hdmi support  $179.99 -undecided dvd rw drive -i'm sticking with xp for the time being... ~$700 i don't do any sort of video capture or anything like that.
this will be for gaming and general purpose(web browsing, ms office, etc).
i do have one specific question... is my ram matched up well with my cpu?
or will the ram speed be a major bottle neck?
all other suggestions are appreciated.
