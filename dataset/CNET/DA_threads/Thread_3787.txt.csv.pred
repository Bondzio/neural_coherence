1.1.1	Hey guys , I was n't exactly sure where to put this .	St
1.1.2	So I thought the general section would be a good bet .	St
1.1.3	Anyways , here is my dilemma .	St
1.1.4	Currently I 'm looking to upgrade the RAM on my PC .	St
1.1.5	I have an Acer Aspire M1100 desktop and my processor is a AMD Athlon 64 processor 4000+ 2.60 ghz The main issue ( I believe ? )	Ques
1.1.6	Is that my RAM is horrific .	St
1.1.7	I only have 1 GB .	St
1.1.8	So essentially , any PC game made after 2008 does n't run , at all .	St
1.1.9	Even League of Legends , which I feel is n't too bad resource wise .	St
1.1.10	I have to play on & quot ; very low & quot ; graphics , no shadows and sound off to even get to 35 FPS , and I even have to kill processes to do so .	St
1.1.11	This is n't counting games like DOTA2 which do n't even load , or Minecraft which lags unless I turn everything down .	St
1.1.12	So my question is this , how big of an improvement would I see if I upgraded to say , 2 GB of RAM ?	Ques
1.1.13	Or say I decided to jump up to 4GB or 8GB of RAM .	St
1.1.14	My PC would not explode , correct ?	Ques
1.1.15	Or at the very least , would it even be compatible to run 4 or 8 GB of RAM ?	Ques
1.1.16	And would the performance be stellar ?	Ques
1.1.17	Thank you so much for your time , and reading through all that stuff !	St
1.2.1	http : //www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx ? model=Aspire % 20M1100 & Cat=RAM No it wo n't blow up .	St
1.2.2	The perf should get a nice bump .	St
1.2.3	If you have a 32 bit OS do n't go over 4GB .	St
1.3.1	give you more bang for the buck .	St
1.3.2	Only problem is you only have a 250W PSU ... .you 'll probably need more to run a higher performance video card .	St
1.3.3	VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	I 'd try the usual 1GB ATI 5450 card .	St
1.4.2	Found around for 20 to 30ish bucks on newegg .	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
