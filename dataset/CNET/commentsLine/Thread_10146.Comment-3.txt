yup, took your advice and asked my school to which they replied by sending me this link,  and by telling me that the engineering department runs windows and unix machines.
sorry but i'm a (soon to be) first time mac user, shouldn't a mac be able to work since its based on unix?
anyways, as mrmacfixit asked, i think it's going to be the 2ghz macbook and i'll throw in my own 2gb of ram.
