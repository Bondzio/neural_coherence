My digital camera which also uses the li-ion battery says in the manual not to charge it and leave it charged when not being used in order to prolong the battery life.
They do better being discharged and stored.
Now, of course, one wants a charged battery on a phone so I would suggest that there are limited cycles of charging and discharging.
They do not have a memory so it is not necessary to run the battery into the ground but does it hurt it to do so though when you are half off a cliff teetering in balance in your SUV, it would be nicer if that battery were fully charge...right?
Just charge away and buy a battery once every few years.
Most likely the phone will crap out anyway and the batteries are not yet a standard design.
