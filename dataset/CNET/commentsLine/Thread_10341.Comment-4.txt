&quot;i've tried reinstall but i didn't un plug.&quot; why not?
i offered it as a clue to try.
&quot;could you please explain the exact order of steps.
&quot; no, i give guidance and direction.
no &quot;steps.&quot; steps are likely for paid support services.
&quot;should i uninstall present software?&quot; in my first reply, i noted that.
maybe i was unclear?
but hopefully this time you will unplug the scanner usb connection, look to an uninstall in add/remove, put in the cd add it as if it was new and see if it helps.
