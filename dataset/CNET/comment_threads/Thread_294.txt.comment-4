If you go to Start, then right click on my computer, then properties,then advanced tab, then in the performance box, click settings,then advanced tab again, then in the virtual memory box, click change, then increase the number depending on your HDD space and your RAM.
If alot of HDD and RAM, then increase by alot.
If little HDD and RAM, then increase by a little.
Hope this helps.
