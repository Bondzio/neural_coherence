I recently acquired a 250 GB Western Digital hard drive that had been formatted on a MAC. On both Vista and XP machines it is seen in Device Manager and Disk Management but not recognized in Explorer so I can't access it to reformat it or use it. In Disk Management it does not have a drive letter assigned to it and when right clicking on its icon all options except HELP are grayed out. Other than putting it back on a MAC (as that is not a convenient option) is there anyway that I can get Windows to assign it a drive letter so that I can reformat and use it? Thanks James

I took a look at the software you suggested but I couldn't find where it supported usb devices. However your suggestion that I try a partition software reminded me that years ago I had added an additional Western Digital HD to my system and that it had come with a CD containing some set up tools. The program is called 'Data Lifeguard Tools' and one of the options allows me to partition / format a HD on a USB port. It worked smooth as silk. I am currently moving some files to it. I will eventually add it to my wireless network using a Belkin wireless USB hub. This will allow all of the computers on the network to access it and use it as a file storage / transfer device. Again thanks for the input. James
