i have the scsi card that came with it.
so installing it isn't a problem.
i just thought the new systems came with an scsi port.
guess i was wrong.
when we updated the old computer from win98se to me i had to go to umax and order a new version of their software.
at that time they said they would not be updating to xp compatable.
i looked again the other day and found that they did update to xp and they have new software that should work with the scanner.
i hate to get rid of it.
it has such a high resolution (9800 x 9800) and it copies legal size documents.
