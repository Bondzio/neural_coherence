<s> Hi, This is a bit of a genral hardware question, I can post a full spc of the comp if anyone thinks it would help but I don't have it to hand at the minute. </s>
<s> I have a computer running windows xp, it is roughly 4 years old. </s>
<s> Recently it started crashing randomly after booting, the only way I could fix it was to connect it as a slave to another computer and run chkdsk to sort it out. </s>
<s> After this it would run fine for a while (maybe a week or so) then start crashing again. </s>
<s> Thinking it was the hard disk itself I replaced the hdd and installed xp fresh however the problem is happening yet again, working fine for a while then with random crashes. </s>
<s> There has been no software installed aside from the service packs from microsoft however these were installed on the other hdd soon after it was purchased with no problems. </s>
<s> The computer is getting to the age that its not worth spending a lot of money on but I am curious as to the nature of the fault. </s>
<s> Has anyone else had similar trouble? </s>
<s> Let me share a few common issues and remedies. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> The motherboard had bad caps. </s>
<s> Fix? </s>
<s> New motherboard. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The power supply had aged or was overtaxed. </s>
<s> New bigger power supply. </s>

<s> The IDE cable was &quot;iffy.&quot; Fix? </s>
