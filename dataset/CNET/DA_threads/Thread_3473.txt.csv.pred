1.3.1	how do i do it.	St
1.3.2	I went to the link setup by netgear but the webpage won't display or it takes me back to the support of netgear website and it wants me buy a online tech support for the router and the cost is more what the router originally cost.	St
1.3.3	do u have a better and easier way of doing it	St
1.4.1	I paid all of 25 bucks for a netgear wrn2000 and no CD.	St
1.4.2	It took all of 2 tries to get to the routers web page to set it up but no CD was needed.	St
1.4.3	I hear you want to know how to do this but if there is some other issue such as a bad cable or forgotten info then it gets harder.	St
1.4.4	I then press the reset button on the router and read the product manual again.	St
1.4.5	If that fails I may replace the router.	St
