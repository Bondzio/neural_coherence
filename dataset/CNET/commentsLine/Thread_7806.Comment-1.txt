i'm building my first pc which will be an htpc connected to my hdtv.
prime concerns are noise and ability to play 1080p movies off hdd.
my question is, what do i need to consider when building from parts?
i think i made sure all parts would work but am i missing anything?
here's what i plan on using (all from newegg.com): in win bp655.200bl black mini-itx desktop computer case 200w power supply model #:bp655.200bl item #:n82e16811108196 asrock h67m-itx lga 1155 intel h67 hdmi sata 6gb/s usb 3.0 mini itx intel motherboard model #:h67m-itx item #:n82e16813157238 intel core i3-2100t sandy bridge 2.5ghz lga 1155 35w dual-core desktop processor bx80623i32100t model #:bx80623i32100t item #:n82e16819116394 g.skill 4gb (2 x 2gb) 240-pin ddr3 sdram ddr3 1333 (pc3 10600) dual channel kit desktop memory model f3-10600cl8d-4gbhk model #:f3-10600cl8d-4gbhk item #:n82e16820231180 i plan on using a 640gb wd caviar blue i have on hand and windows 7 home premium.
not sure which rf keyboard/mouse i'll use, maybe one with a trackpad to keep it simple.
does anyone see any potential issues with my setup?
seems straightforward but i'm a pc builder noob.
thanks for the help in advance!
