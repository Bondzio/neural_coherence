Have not had any luck with the Dell forums so I thought I'd ask here. Is there any way to get rid of the nag screen? I've tried shaking up the toner cartridge but to no avail. I did read in the manual there is a reset for the printing drum, but I didn't change that. Any thoughts? Thanks B

I did try google and found those links but the problem is not really the error lights on the printer. Those are actually working correctly and don't indicate it needs toner. It's the windows nag box. http://img218.imageshack.us/img218/3363/tonerv.jpg Thanks again, B

I figured there was some reset button or sequence of actions I had to do to make it to go away. It works like a champ without the nag. Thanks again to both of you. B
