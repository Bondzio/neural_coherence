i have none of these issues.
but the brew of the machine and fax machine is still running windows so when i hear this issue i often find a windows machine which means it will be unreliable at times.
more so when it's not dedicated to the task or built from parts.
long discussion could be had about that.
if it must be reliable, get rid of the machine.
