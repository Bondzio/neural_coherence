so i am now adding that crucial ram instead of the stuff i had before.
i am also still wondering whether the 7970, gtx 670, or gtx 680 is the gpu i should get.... i want the best performance, but i am also wondering if physx and tech like that will still work with the amd card?
it's probably a dumb question, but hey i gotta ask.
