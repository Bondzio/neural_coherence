you may have to dive into the machine to see if the esata ports were actually connected to the mainboard.
and if the ide emulation was enabled on the bios then i find limitations in the bios limits the sata ports to just 2 or 4 and never more than that.
even more confusing (to those that don't write firmware or design rockets, uhh electronics) is that only the first 2 or four ports may function when that is enabled.
changing that setting in the bios can cause the os to fail so test it and put it back if it fails.
i'm finding this is usually enabled because many try to install windows xp and since xp knows nothing about sata the owners think the makers have given them a bum unit and return it.
i think this is why i'm starting to see units with ide emulation enabled by default which could cause esata issues.
sorry but there's a lot to think over and explore.
