Proffitt	7/27/12 8:17 AM	1.34337702E12	Clarification request: Are you sure about the PSU with its SPLIT RAIL +12V	I look at http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817171013 and see 18A +12V rails which don't fair well when folk want high end gaming video cards. And that DDR3 video card? Seems that we can't tell what that is but this machine looks to be a problem in the making. Ideas? 1. Get a single rail PSU to avoid having to learn about moving things off one rail to another or the pain of what happens when the rails don't support your video card or system. 2. Choose a video card from this list -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html Bob
