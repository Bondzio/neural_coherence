<s> hello, I just recently purchased a new samsung 80 gig hard drive and did a clean win 2000 install on it, however once I was done and checked in my computer and looked at the c: drive it says it only has a capactiy of 7.82 gigs, also when I did the install I chose to use ntfs but it says im using fat file system, is this a reason for the missing size? </s>
<s> the computer is an hp x86 with 32 kb ram. </s>
<s> your using the old fat 16 format. </s>
<s> You must choose to use the large file system. </s>
<s> which will be fat32 or ntfs. </s>
<s> Also, 2000 requires at least 128 megs of ram. </s>
<s> your using the fat 16 file system. </s>
<s> you must choose to use large file system in the beginning. </s>
<s> Which would be fat32 or ntfs. </s>
<s> You also need at least 128 megs of ram for 2000. </s>
<s> is there a way to change this now or do I have to do a complete reinstall? </s>
<s> btw I didi choose to use ntfs so I have no clue to what happened </s>
<s> is to start over. </s>
<s> did you use a disk to format your drive besides 2000? </s>
<s> you should of recieved another disk with your new drive. </s>
<s> You can also use a old 98 or ME startup disk and boot to dos and type fdisk. </s>
<s> choose large disk format, delete partition then make new. </s>
<s> you would need to go into your bios first and change to floppy boot first. </s>
<s> File system issue: Fat16 has a hard limit of 2gb in 9x and 4 Gb in NT based oses. </s>
<s> It is not fat 16. </s>
<s> Probably fat32. </s>
<s> from a run line type &quot;convert c:&quot;(or d: or whatever)&quot; /fs:ntfs&quot; to convert to ntfs. </s>
<s> Size: Is it 7.82 or 78.2 ? </s>
<s> Computers think in a base 2 system, so where we think 1000 MBs to a GB they think 1024. </s>
<s> So reporting is usally off because that. </s>
<s> after I make new partition what do I do, I trie to format from dos but couldnt so I used win 98 cd because I do not have enough memory to run win 2000 and the hard drive still only came up showing 7.82 gig's. </s>
<s> btw the option i was to choose when it was time to make new partition was make primary dos partition correct? </s>
<s> ok I have figured out the formatting and partitioning issues...(thx for the help) but no matter what I do and I chose large disk support and everything as instructed but it still is only showing as it's an 8 gig hard ddrive instead of 80, im at wits end and dont know what to do to get it to use all of my disk space </s>
<s> From what I can tell you have a many year old machine with a BIOS that may not understand large drives. </s>
<s> You'll want to try some 32GB drive, then under 64GB drive to see where its limit is. </s>
