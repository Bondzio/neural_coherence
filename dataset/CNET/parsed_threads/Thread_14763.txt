<s> I have an office with 3 tenants. </s>
<s> How can I seperate their networks without havign to buy 3 routers? </s>
<s> You need one of the pro grade network hubs that run a few thousand and then you create VLANs. </s>
<s> Frankly why make their network your problem. </s>
<s> I've done this before and supply a complimentary internet access but never solve their network issues. </s>
<s> If those companies want their own LANs then tell them to make their own. </s>

<s> I am inclined to agree. </s>
<s> I have an additional 9 offices to manage and I definitely think it will be in my best interest to let them run their own inner-office cabling and wiring. </s>
<s> Seems like a bit of a headache to tackle this on the tenants behalf. </s>
