<s> I want to buy a new LCD, but I do not know which ones to buy. </s>
<s> I would like to know if contrast ratios and response times are important. </s>
<s> And if they are, what should their values be? </s>
<s> I am looking to buy a BenQ FP937s 19&quot; LCD, 12ms Response Time, 500:1 Contrast Ratio, 250 Nits Brightness. </s>
<s> Is that a good choice? </s>
<s> I will be using the monitor for basic computer use, (web surfing, watching DVD's, word processing, etc.) </s>
<s> and some light gaming, (Half Life, Counterstrike, etc.) </s>
<s> I have both DVI and VGA supported on my computer, but I don't know which one to use. </s>
<s> I've heard mixed opinions about which is better. </s>
<s> Anybody know which one would be better? </s>
<s> My answer is this. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Look at the display and see if you like it. </s>
<s> &quot;Specs&quot; can be meaningless. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> I've seen both VGA and DVI hookups and ... &quot;I can't see the difference&quot;. </s>

<s> The LCD's at the store all look similar to me... </s>
<s> They don't seem that great because they're all hooked up to one source and it comes out bad. </s>
<s> So I'm kinda left with the specs... </s>
<s> If they look bad there, why buy? </s>

<s> gaming. </s>
<s> [is half-life considered &quot;Light&quot; gaming???] </s>
<s> But the writeups that I have seen on many of the fast response ones suffered in color and text quality compared to their old 25 MS brothers. </s>
<s> Maximum PC magazine about 3 issues ago finally found a few that they considered acceptable for gaming. </s>
<s> But they didn't rave about any of them. </s>
<s> IMHO ,make certain that the one you get is the second generation version of the fast speed ones from the mfr's that you choose. </s>
<s> Seems that in the rush to get fast speed they may not have checked the other parameters that well in their first releases. </s>
<s> has anybody seen this monitor before? </s>
<s> there aren't much good reviews out there, so i'm looking to forums now for information. </s>
