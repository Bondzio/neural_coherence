1.1.1	i just bought a mce 2005 operating system and didn't stop to think whether it needed a tv tuner card to work, i dont need the mce to watch tv as i listen to music more anyway but i am still unsure as to whether you actually need the card to use the rest of mce.i dont want to open the box to find that it wont work and that now i wont be able to return it which is why i was wondering if anyone could enlighten me on this situation.

1.1.2	my hardware configuration is: intel pentium D 3.0 ghz ati x1800 256mb 200gb hard drive 2gb ram and a dvd re-writer drive if anyone could help it would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance	St
1.2.1	...hardware requirement for the Operating System.	St
1.2.2	Windows Media Centre Edition works fine without any TV tuner(s) installed.	St
1.2.3	For those who do want a Media Centre OS, and may wish to add some TV functionality later, it can handle up to 4 tuners (2 analogue + 2 digital).	St
1.2.4	Conversely not all TV tuner's need MCE, and ship with W98/XP software and drivers.	St
1.2.5	There are also those TV tuners which only ship with MCE software too, so consider check carefully, if anyone's thinking of doing so.	St
1.2.6	GeeBee.	St
1.3.1	thanks for your help	Polite
