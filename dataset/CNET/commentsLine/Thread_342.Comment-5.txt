when you backup to an online &quot;cloud&quot; server, you are actually backing up to multiple servers.
most online companies run anywhere from 3 to 6 separate geographical locations for their server hubs that are constantly talking to each to sync the data on each server.
this doesn't just allow the data to be secured against physical distruction, but against data corruption because each set of data is compared to another set of data, which includes copy of the previous generation of the data.
it's a simple redundancy system, much like have two separate people each taking a copy of the date home with them each night.
if you're looking into online data backup and storage, ask where each backup server is located, and what redundancy and physical protections they have in place, and pick the one you like the best.
