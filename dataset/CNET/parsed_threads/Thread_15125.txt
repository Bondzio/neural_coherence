<s> Samsung support is useless. </s>
<s> Since it does not yet appear on their website, they don't have a clue. </s>
<s> Does anyone have an update as to availability? </s>
<s> http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Keyboard-Dock-ECR-K14AWEGXAR/dp/B00551931Q/ref=pd_sxp_grid_pt_1_0 There are cases out there but not from Samsung. </s>

<s> still only place I have found it is on a UK site and it says &quot;ship when available&quot; - which can mean anything. </s>
<s> 133 USD </s>
<s> I found it at expansys-usa.com. </s>
<s> for $133.99 which is a bit less than the $149.00 list. </s>
<s> They are showing a ship date of 9/12/11. </s>
<s> Don't know if that is right but I ordered one anyway. </s>
<s> We'll see what happens. </s>
<s> Good luck </s>
