When I turn my computer on after it being powered down for a while, it will not detect either of my 2 hard drives. I assume they are not getting any power. I turn off my psu via the power switch on the back of the unit, then turn it back on...wait for it to charge back up and start my computer up again. Everything runs smoothly after that. I have to do this procedure every time I want to turn my computer on. I am fortunate not to have had either of my hard drives fail/fry due to this. My question is does anyone know what is happening? Is the psu going completely down the tubes? And has does it keep from frying my drives? Is there a protection system that turns off all power to the hard drives if there is not enough power to give to them?

I have waited a while to see if it has done anything but just now the same problem has occurred. There is a beta version of a newer bios and another bios version that is in their ftp but not on the main site. Should I update to those or is this a hardware issue? I saw on the asus site someone else with the same problem with the same board, could is be my motherboard going bad. His post: &quot;However, if I reset the CMOS by using the jumpers, my computer seems to 'remember' my hard drives at this point. I replaced my cmos battery but that didnt help. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.&quot;

This is the last hurrah before we wonder if the drives have seen better days or if they never got the bios quite right. Do you remember the bad old days where they offered a start up delay in the bios so drives could spin up and be ready? Bob

You seem to have a &quot;stuffed system&quot; and may take awhile to come up to speed or simply be acknowledged by the bios, the 4gb of ram being suspect and 4 drives. Very possibility all together abit too much at the start. The beta bios update if it didn't ID what it does, stay away from such updates of any kind. A bios update has to address an issue you've encountered. tada -----Willy

They do degrade over time because of heat stress and/or added devices, etc.. You get the picture. Now, you've added a recent bios update you may have compounded the problem, never use a &quot;beta&quot; version even the manufacturers offer its at your &quot;risk&quot; sorta deal. Anyways, your PSU may no longer have the &quot;phuuumf&quot; to get things going as it did when brand new. Take away some added device like the CD drives, 1/2 of ram and see if it starts more quickly or more often than not. If the problem persists then you may have a mtrbd. issue, which includes the bios. HDs do go bad over time when mounted on top of each other as heat build-up is caught between the two and causes that sort of heat stress and cooks the electronics on them. You see it can be anything, don't take anything for granted, as you appear to because it worked for 1yr., now it doesn't as well. tada -----Willy
