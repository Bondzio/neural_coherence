Yep , it is a paper project , like a minor thesis and you're telling me there is nothing to write about this.
Actually i couldnt find something useful about that subject too so what do you recommend to do?
Am i supposed to try changing subject to a more common and useful one?
By the way , i'm a little confused about the terms.
Is there a difference between &quot;wifi&quot; adhoc and &quot;pure&quot; adhoc?
