i have a viewsonic vp201m monitor and i can easily see the diffenece between an analog and dvi connection.
the dvi produces a much crisper display.
others apparently have different results, but i am sold on dvi.
like you, i find it irritating that not all monitor manufacturers include the dvi cable.
i got an nec monitor for my daughter and it only had the analog cable.
i did find a good deal on dvi cables by looking on e-bay.
some are as low as $8 including shipping costs.
good luck.
