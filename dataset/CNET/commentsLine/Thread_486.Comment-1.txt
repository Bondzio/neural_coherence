hi all, any help would be really appreciated as i'm getting nowhere.
on my vista basic laptop i want to enable ics so that i can connect my xbox to xbox live through it as my router is downstairs.
i have trawled the web and come across web help and found tutorials saying to set to automatic and start various services i.e.
application layer gateway service, plug and play etc.
i've done this, switched off windows firewall.
i have no other active firerwalls currently.
but still it pops up with shared for a second, disappears and i get the the generic error??
any ideas what could still be stopping me from sharing?
