1.1.1	'Installed a new Brookstone Photo Scanner (Model No.	St
1.1.2	SKU634394) on my iMac7,1 running Mac OS X 10.6.5.	St
1.1.3	For this install, I connected the scanner directly to the iMac using the provided USB cable.	St
1.1.4	For software, I used the provided CD to install the iConnect driver and utilities called DigiPhoto version 1.0.	St
1.1.5	The software installed successfully until the very end when an error message appeared.	St
1.1.6	The error message window was titled &quot;postflight&quot;.	St
1.1.7	The body of the error message stated: &quot;chmod: Unable to change file on /Library/Application Support/Brookstone: Operation not permitted&quot;.	St
1.1.8	Clicking the &quot;OK&quot; button on this window closed the window.	St
1.1.9	At this point the install seemed to be complete.	St
1.1.10	I then restarted the computer as instructed and, upon restart, the DigiPhoto software started and instructed that calibration of the scanner be undertaken.	St
1.1.11	I proceeded to insert a provided calibration sheet (4x6&quot; white card) into the scanner with the side with printing facing up.	St
1.1.12	By pressing a button on the DigiPhoto window on the iMac desktop, the scanner proceeded to pull the sheet through and creating a file from the scan.	St
1.1.13	This file, &quot;Image0001.jpg&quot;, was placed in a special folder, &quot;DigiPhoto&quot;, that was created inside the iMac's documents folder.	St
1.1.14	The scanner's printed instruction booklet then indicates that the fourth step in calibrating the scanner is as follows: &quot;Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the scanner calibration.&quot; I saw no such instructions on the screen of the iMac.	St
1.1.15	The instruction booklet then goes on to state in bold text: &quot;Note: If the scanner installation is not started and displayed automatically on the screen, click 'Start', select 'Run' and type in [d:\setup].&quot; In the window of the running DigiPhoto application, I saw no &quot;Start&quot;.	St
1.1.16	There was an &quot;OK&quot; button there, which, when clicked, seems to do nothing except close the window, but not quit the application.	St
1.1.17	When I quitted the application, the application crashed.	St
1.1.18	I would be happy to supply the content of the crash log, but there is not the room here to attach it.	St
1.1.19	I tried deleting the application files (that I could find) and reinstall software from the CD but get the same results.	St
1.1.20	I must admit that I did not delete the files at /Library/Application Support/Brookstone when I attempted the software reinstall so I suppose they could be corrupted.	St
1.1.21	Any ideas what I should try to get this scanner calibrated and functioning properly?	Sug
1.2.1	This is my third unit, have same problem,, were you able to fix it?	St
1.3.1	Return it.	St
1.3.2	Look at the company and they are not one to pick up tech gear from.	St
1.3.3	Next time, an Epson or HP scanner.	St
