well, here's my first post.
i'm a chemical engineer by trade, over 25 years in manufacturing, and though i am not a complete techno-geek, i am fairly savvy when it comes to pc issues.
i learn fast, try to research and think through my work before launching into a new project, and am eager to receive input from those with more experience than myself (i.e.
home networking).
current situation: 3-level home (basement, 1st floor, and 2nd floor) charter internet service typical network/internet access takes place from first and second floors of the home.
no major problems with current setup, just wanting to upgrade for better access and speed.
current confirguration... wall.. cable modem...wireless router (netgear)... wired to nas, xp-mce desktop, & old epson r200 printer coax cable, modem, router, nas, and xp-mce desktop are all in the basement.
wireless connectivity is good throughout all three levels of the home with three different laptops and four different smart phones connecting at any given time in any given combination.
upgrade plans: 1. extend cable connection to 1st floor 2. install modem inside my 6' tall hardwood entertainment center 3. cat6a cable from modem to new netgear 4500 gigabit router on top of the same entertainment center 4. cat6a cable back to existing netgear router in basement as a wap 5. nas, xp-mce desktop, and epson r200 will remain in the basement where they are today.
upgrade rationale: since most of us access the internet from either the first or second floors of the home, i believe i can get faster network response by installing my new gigabit router closer to where we are most likely to connect, and do not want to lose connectivity in the absement since my kids do sometimes hang out there on their laptops while studying for college.
questions... a) are my plans ok?
b) any suggestions for improving my planned arrangement?
thanks ahead of time for your insights and suggestions.
