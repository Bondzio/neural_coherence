1.4.1	Download and install the latest router FIRMWARE for the WRT54GS .	St
1.4.2	Do the same for the wireless network adapter DRIVER .	St
1.4.3	Try changing the broadcast channel of the router to 1 , 6 , or 11 .	St
1.4.4	This can help to eliminate interference .	St
1.4.5	After you do this , you will need to enable SSID broadcast to connect for the first time .	St
