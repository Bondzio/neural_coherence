what are we to do if you don't read the links?
in short, many &quot;format&quot; then descend in the pit that is called &quot;installing windows&quot;.
many don't take the inventory of what's in the machine that would have been easy before they formatted.

see step 5 of  and that's what i do to sidestep a possible tripping block of installing xp, 2000 and 2003. good luck, bob
