hello everyone, i was wondering if anyone can help me.
i have a linksys wireless g broadband router, model no wrt54g.
the router's red diag light stays always red.
i went into the linksys technical support for help and followed the instructions on how to fix the problem on the page:  i got as far as testing the communication between the router and the network card.
it seems that the router established a connection but when i test the communication with ping 192.168.1.1 it say request timed out... could anyone please advise me on what to do?
thank you, any help is greatly appreciated!
