had crossover cable made at computer store...it's grey and all the connections are correct.
cat5 ends are neat and solid and the cable has been tested.
tried putting drivers in c: drive, but haven't tried floppy...pointed install program to created file on c: drive with no change in error...will try pointing it to floppy next... wish me luck.........sigh
