You didn't note the OS plus what HARDWARE issue you feel may be affecting this.
Hint: You posted in the &quot;PC Hardware Forum.&quot; For Windows 9x/ME this article covers it all -&gt; http://support.microsoft.com/?id=222469 This applies to defragmenting as well as scandisk.
What I often see is any number of responses that contain bits and pieces of what's in this article, but why not have it all.
In closing, if you feel this is a hardware issue, tell about what hardware issue you have.
