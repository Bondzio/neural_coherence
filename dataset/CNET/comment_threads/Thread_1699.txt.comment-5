Thanks for the advice guys taking it all into consideration I think I have settled on this one - http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103649 It's in my budget and I think it's a good processor that will handle anything I can throw at it.
And later on when I can work in a AM3 mobo and memory it is ready to go for that as well.
