<s> operating system is XP home edition and the printer is a Lexmark X73. </s>
<s> i've loaded software on a new drive after having problems with an old one. </s>
<s> before having problems with the drive, the printer in question worked fine. </s>
<s> i have tried to install the printer using 2 methods. </s>
<s> one is to use the disk provided with the printer. </s>
<s> the other is to use a downloaded install procedure from Lexmark. </s>
<s> after installing, using either method, i can print. </s>
<s> my problem is that after a shutdown/startup, i can only restart in safe mode and restore to a time before the printer was installed. </s>
<s> I've been sending emails back and forth to lexmark for three weeks with no useful suggestions. </s>
<s> does anyone have a suggestion besides buying a new printer which i'm about to do. </s>
<s> thanks in advance, geneg </s>
<s> Your adding a new HD may be culprit. </s>
<s> If you cloned system drive do a Windows XP repair. </s>
<s> If that doesn't work, re-install XP. </s>
<s> Let us know. </s>
<s> and life goes on... Jack </s>
