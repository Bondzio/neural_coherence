1.1.1	Well , I have a wireless 2Wire DSL modem and SBC Yahoo internet service .	St
1.1.2	I have a computer wirelessly connected with a wireless card to it .	St
1.1.3	Now , everything was fine for a few weeks of downloading and whatnot .	St
1.1.4	Yet around last week , the broadband link light would start flashing amber for several seconds , then go back to green for several seconds , then go back to flashing amber .	St
1.1.5	It did n't seem to effect anything , so I ignored it .	St
1.1.6	Yet several days later , I noticed it was doing it again , and that time the internet stopped working until I turned off the wirelessly connected computer .	St
1.1.7	Does anyone know exactly what that flashing amber light signifies ?	Ques
1.1.8	And how I get it to stop flashing so ?	Ques
1.1.9	Is there possibly a download or upload limit imposed on SBC Yahoo service , and if so how can I find out ?	Ques
1.1.10	Any help would be greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.2.1	a device with capabilities of 10 Mbps is accessing the modem/router .	St
1.2.2	Green is usually 100 Mbps .	St
1.2.3	Have you locked down your wireless network so others can not hop on ?	Ques
1.2.4	An 802.11b device will drag down a & quot ; G & quot ; router .	St
1.3.1	I 'm pretty sure other people are n't hopping on the network , it 's just my other computer that 's conencting wirelessly .	St
1.3.2	I know this because when I turn that other computer off , the blinking amber goes away .	St
1.3.3	So if this wireless card is the source of this blinking , how do I correct it ?	Ques
1.3.4	It was n't doing it for the longest time..	St
