1.1.1	I want to make my laptop display on my TV .	St
1.1.2	I want to be able to surf the web on my TV .	St
1.1.3	The CPU I 'm using is a Dell Inspiron 600M and it has a S-Video out .	St
1.1.4	The Television is a Daewoo 27 & quot ; Flat ( not a lcd , nor HDTV , just a nice analog , I think ) and it also has an S-video connection , as well as component Video connections .	St
1.1.5	For some reason one of the regular A/V Inputs is marked & quot ; Monitor & quot ; , not sure if that can help me .	St
1.1.6	I 've heard you can just hook up directly , with no converter , using a regular S-Video cable .	St
1.1.7	Anyone know if this would really work ?	Ques

1.2.1	You can connect your laptop to the TV by buying a lead which fits your laptop tv-out and has a/v connectors at the other end for the tv .	St
1.2.2	However , this is only going to be suitable for viewing a DVD-movie which is running on the laptop 's DVD-drive .	St
1.2.3	The low resolution of a TV and the fact that it produces a picture using 'lines ' instead of 'pixels ' means that a computer image ( such as a web-page or the desktop ) will look terrible on a tv .	St
1.2.4	Any text would be virtually unreadable .	St
1.2.5	That 's where the converter comes in ( the one you intend to buy ) .	St
1.2.6	You wo n't need it to watch a dvd-movie because the dvd-software uses an 'overlay ' to show the picture on the tv , but for anything else you will need the convertor which increases the tv resolution to same as we are used to having on a PC monitor ( eg 800 x 600 , 1024 x 768 etc ) .	St
