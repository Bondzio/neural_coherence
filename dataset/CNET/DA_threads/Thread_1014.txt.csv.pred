1.1.1	Hi, I'm using an HP a1600n to edit videos.	St
1.1.2	My specs: HP Pavilion desktop AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 3800+, 2.0 GHz 2 Gigs of RAM (I added 1 gig myself) nVidia graphics card (I don't what model, where do I look?)	St
1.1.3	I've experienced some lag as I'm editing and I'm looking to re-vamp this computer, rather than buying new- it's less than a year old.	St
1.1.4	I will be dealing with HD video soon and I'm sure my PC will seem even slower then.	St
1.1.5	I'd like to upgrade to a 2.8+ GHz processor (3.0 GHz wouldn't hurt).	St
1.1.6	Is a processor hard to install?	St
1.1.7	I'm also curious if I should buy a better video card.	St
1.1.8	I'm unsure about how a video card affects performance and what kinds there are.	St
1.1.9	Thanks for any responses!	St
1.1.10	!	St
1.2.1	How much do motherboards affect speed?	St
1.3.1	Where a post was asking about upgrading the CPU on that motherboard.	St
1.3.2	According to HP &quot;your Motherboard('ASUS A8M2N-LA') supports a maximum of Athlon64 X2 up to 5000+&quot; So, that is as far as you can go using your present MOBO.	St
1.3.3	But that is close to what you had asked for anyways.	St
1.3.4	I think the 5000+ runs at 2.6GHz BTW: If you do not have an add-on video card, that motherboard uses the integrated GeForce 6150 chipset for onboard video (uses shared memory with the system)	St
1.4.1	Hmm, I was hoping for more than 2.6 GHz.	St
1.4.2	But that's ok.	St
1.4.3	Thanks for the tip.	St
1.4.4	Can I add a video card, even though right now it is just integrated?	St
1.4.5	How do I find out if a video card will work with my computer?	St
1.5.1	If you have that slot open, then yes.	St
1.5.2	The video card addition would be OK. Lots of options on that but remember, the power supply requirement on the more robust cards.	St
1.5.3	What are your preferences on the video card?	Ques
1.6.1	What kind will help me out the most for video editing?	St
1.6.2	I'm on the verge of buying an iMac and giving my HP to my Mom...	St
1.7.1	video card for Editing.	St
1.7.2	Maybe someone with experience in that field can.	St
1.7.3	Switching to a Mac for video is however an idea.	St
1.7.4	I do not have experience there either but have heard that video editing on a Mac is much easier and less stressful.	St
1.7.5	Check out why most of the professional video special effects are done with a Mac.	St
1.7.6	Also, check in the Mac forum for what type Mac is used and if you can swing the purchase.	Sug
1.8.1	First off, I do video editing and I think I can offer some useful thoughts...	St
1.8.2	If you really want to switch to a Mac for video editing, consider the fact that iMacs use a mobile version of the Core 2 Duo processor, and a slower laptop (5400 rpm) hard drive.	St
1.8.3	On the other hand, getting a MacPro is much more expensive.	St
1.8.4	If you really want the pure performance of a Core 2 Duo -- not a mobile version -- I'd actually recommend a new PC over an iMac.	St
1.8.5	With your current rig, you still do have some potential.	St
1.8.6	First of all, get yourself a video card (even a 256MB model is fine for video editing).	Sug
1.8.7	I use an EVGA GeForce 7900 with 256MB on my editing rig, and never have a hiccup or lag.	St
1.8.8	Second, max out your RAM.	St
1.8.9	You probably have a 32 bit OS, so put 4 gigs in it (32 bit version of Windows can't use any more than that -- actually only uses 3.5 GB).	St
1.8.10	That should make a HUGE difference.	Sug
1.8.11	If it's still not enough, upgrade to that 2.6 GHz 5000 processor.	St
1.8.12	Most video editing software now is optimized to use multiple cores, and a 2.6 GHz dual core processor is still pretty respectable!	St
1.8.13	BTW, my rig (for reference) - Core 2 Duo E6400 (2.13 GHz) 1.5 GB RAM (more would be better, but with the video card and Intel processor it hasn't been a problem yet.)	St
1.8.14	EVGA GeForce 7900 GS	St
1.9.1	Sorry, I typed 7900 both times in the original message.	St
1.9.2	Didn't notice that until now, but I meant 7600.	St
