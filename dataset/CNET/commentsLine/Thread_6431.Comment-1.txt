hi guys/gals, my wireless connection is not working and i cannot log on to it, i have connected a netgear wgt624 v3 wireless router to my motorola surfboard sb5101e modem which is connected to telewest cable broadband (internet works fine if i access directly through the modem), on the router the power light is lit and also the internet light flashes rapidly but the wireless light comes on for a couple of seconds and then goes out - i think this is the problem?
i have tried logging on to the router to check the wireless settings but cannot access it, i have also tried connecting directly via lan but cannot get this to work either although i am not sure if i have connected it correctly?
any ideas/comments/advice is very much appreciated!!
thanks in advance, bigg2.
