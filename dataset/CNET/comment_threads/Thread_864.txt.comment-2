Quite simply Amazon's ebook pricing is quite the saver.
I have the Nook Color and prices are quite a lot higher.
After playing with the Nook Color I decided as a BN Nook I wasn't going to get much use from it.
I went to http://mrm3.net/nook-color-how-to-gingerbread-guide/ and turned it into an Android tablet.
I installed Amazon's Kindle reader than thought &quot;This Nook Color is a very nice Kindle Reader.&quot; Bob
