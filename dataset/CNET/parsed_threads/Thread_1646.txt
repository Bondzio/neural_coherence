<s> My g/f recently bought a Macbook 1.83 GHZ. </s>
<s> I would like to get her a wireless router and a wireless mouse for her unit. </s>
<s> My question is, would all Linksys routers and all wireless mice work with Mac computers? </s>
<s> I have never used a Mac and know very little about them. </s>
<s> I don't want to get talked into buying expensive made for Mac Hardware when I don't really need to. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>

<s> I recently hooked up the Linksys wireless router,Model WRT54G, with our HP desktop and my Mac laptop. </s>
<s> It's wonderful. </s>
<s> It was easy to set up and works well all over the house, upstairs too! </s>
<s> Since you want to save money, Step 1: Consider a Belkin 802.11g wireless router... </s>
<s> Unless there is some sort of specific functionality that the Linksys does that you require. </s>
<s> 802.11g is standard and the built-in MacBook wireless does that. </s>
<s> That said, a Linksys wireless router running 802.11g will work just fine with the MacBook. </s>
<s> Please reference http://www.apple.com/macbook/wireless.html Wireless mouse: I use a Kensington. </s>
<s> Works great. </s>
