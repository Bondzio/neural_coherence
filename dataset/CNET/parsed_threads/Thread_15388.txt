<s> Hi, Can someone cofirm that Panasonic cordless dect phones handset : KX-TG6300, KX-TG9300 : like KX-TG6311S, KX-TG9342T have MUTE facility. </s>
<s> Looking at the phone : it does not have a MUTE button. </s>
<s> However they are listed as MUTE capable and listed as yes in technical specs on cnet too : Mute/Flash Buttons Yes (Soft Key)/Yes (Flash/Call Wait) So is it a soft key that functions as mute button. </s>
<s> Does it work. </s>
<s> Has anyone used it and does it work. </s>
<s> Is it complicated to get it to work? </s>
<s> Other panasonic dect cordless like KX-TG8231B KX-TG1032S have a specific mute button. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Hi I don't know if this helps, on the KX-TG832 the mute key is not labelled but the the &quot;CLEAR&quot; button (bottom-right of the joystick) is used for this purpose. </s>
<s> I have the Panasonic KX-TG8322AL, does anyone know if you can turn the display screen on the handsets of while docked??? </s>
<s> I have one near my bed and it is bright and annoying... </s>
