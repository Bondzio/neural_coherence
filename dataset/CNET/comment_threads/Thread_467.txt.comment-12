I recently bought the 100G Simpletech Pininfarina and formatted it to FAT 32 so I could use it with both my mac and PC.
This was working fine for a bit however now I can't get the drive to show up on either my PC at work or at home.
I checked it with my Mac last night and it worked fine.
Both PCs are running XP.
Can anyone advise me what steps I need to take to get my drive to read on the PCs?
Thank in advance, lapeachies
