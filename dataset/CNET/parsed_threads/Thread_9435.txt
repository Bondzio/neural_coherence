<s> Does or can anyone identify this video card? </s>
<s> I wasnt to use it in an old D955 intel MB but I do not know which card it is. </s>
<s> I also can not find any ATI software that does an ID. </s>

<s> A decent pix, but no label or decal to refer the model#. </s>
<s> So, if possible are there any model# on the backside? </s>
<s> A firm answer lies under that HSF setup, if you could remove the HSF, the large IC chip IDs the product or what it is. </s>
<s> Which in turn provides the basic driver s/w. </s>
<s> If there is an FCC tag#, visit the FCC website and enter it to locate the model#. </s>
<s> If no labels/decals or silkscreened info is provided, its a hit&miss process to have the right driver s/w or install package. </s>
<s> In most cases, you can use the ATI driver s/w suite to load and it gets used by various video cards provided they're driven by that same IC chip. </s>
<s> Installing the AGP mtrbd. </s>
<s> driver from Intel can also help install a video card as at least the basic install is present. </s>
<s> You can then use Belarc or PC Wizard 2010 to ID the product once the system is up and running. </s>
<s> With what you provided, that's as far as I can go in help. </s>
<s> good luck tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Hi Willy, Thank for your input, for completeness, here is the back. </s>
<s> The numbers are visable. </s>
<s> The tower it is going in has a dead HD that I'm grinding off the broken screw so I can get it out. </s>
<s> Once I get it running I will follow your method above, thanks! </s>

<s> ATI D33053 Radeon R9600 256M AGP http://support.amd.com/us/Pages/AMDSupportHub.aspx has drivers but since no OS was noted (or I missed it) I can't be more specific. </s>
