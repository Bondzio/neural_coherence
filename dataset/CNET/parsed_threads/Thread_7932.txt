<s> Hi: I was recently given a Dell Inspiron 6000 Notebook computer. </s>
<s> I was told it has wireless internet, but am not able to get it to work. </s>
<s> It has Intel Centrino technology. </s>
<s> A Pentium M Processor. </s>
<s> It does have a WiFi symbol which i am guessing lights up when WiFi is used, near where the caps lock icon is. </s>
<s> However, when I go into device manager, it only shows 1394 Net Adapter, under Network adapters. </s>
<s> Any idea what I am doing wrong? </s>
<s> If this system does not have wireless, is there a way to upgrade it, besides an external wireless card? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> will have an available internal PCI slot which can be used for a wireless adapter. </s>
<s> Is that Microsoft doesn't fetch all the needed drivers. </s>
<s> A situation like yours would result. </s>
<s> There is a CD from dell you install after the OS install to get all the parts working. </s>
<s> Did you try that? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Hi: Thanks for your reply. </s>
<s> This system was used, and they had it reset so I wouldn't have to deal with all their stuff on the cumputer. </s>
<s> They gave me the Windows XP installation disk, and several others, but no Dell CD like the one you mention, I asked and they said they gave me all the CDs they could find, so I guess it must be lost. </s>
<s> Is there somewhere I can download it from? </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Hi: I looked inside, and yep, there is a wireless card. </s>
<s> Which leads me to believe that Bob is absolutely right about the missing disk. </s>
<s> I looked on Dell's site, and found several downloads for my computer. </s>
<s> Any idea which one I need? </s>
<s> Is it something called a chipset, or maybe quickset? </s>
<s> Do I need to re-install Windows again to install this, or can I just install it right now, with Windows and other items I have since installed? </s>
<s> Your help is so appreciated! </s>
<s> Thanks so much! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> I don't ask for that since you see that request in red letters with every post you make. </s>

<s> Hi Bob: The page for my computer is found at http://support.dell.com/support/downloads/devices.aspx?c=us&cs=19&l=en&s=dhs&SystemID=INS_PNT_6000&os=WW1&osl=EN# There are many options listed, and I am not sure which is the one/ ones I need. </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
<s> &quot;Broadcom 440x 10/100 Integrated Controller </s>
<s> Hi: Thanks so much to Bob, YOU ARE A GENIUS! </s>
<s> Got the wireless working, thanks to you. </s>
<s> Sorry I didn't provide the right info earlier, I had no idea there were many wireless options available for the same computer. </s>
<s> I thought you were asking for the model number of the computer Now, I was wondering how do I determine which mouse/touchpad I have, in order to update the drivers. </s>
<s> It seems to be missing several options, such as scrolling etc.. </s>
<s> Thanks again for being so helpful, you are my hero! </s>
<s> If you can't sort out which try those tools (Belarc, Everest) to narrow it down. </s>
<s> The exact model number might help. </s>
<s> There were many variants of the 6000. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> Hey, you're doing the hard work. </s>
<s> I'm just pointing or shining a dim light on the path. </s>
<s> Hi Bob: Is there any way to find my exact model number? </s>
<s> I went into System Information, and it has loads of things listed, but I do not see what could be the exact model. </s>
<s> I looked on the back of the computer to see if there was any additional info. </s>
<s> Again, lost of numbers etc..., but I don't see what could be the exact model number. </s>
<s> I tried Belarc, it did give some info, but still no exact model, or what type of mouse i have. </s>
<s> I have the service tag number, does that help any? </s>
<s> Again, thanks so much! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Look for a place to put that in at dell.com Bob </s>
<s> I entered the info at dell.com, and it listed all kinds of components originally installed, it even analyzed and listed ones currently installed, however it lists everything but the mouse pad. </s>
<s> I am also having trouble finding a driver for my ethernet controller. </s>
<s> It lists it with an exclamation point in device manager. </s>
<s> Ugh! </s>
<s> I should be very happy my aunt gave me this beautiful computer, but it is really proving to be a pain. </s>
<s> I think she thought she was doing me a favor by removing all her old work stuff, but I think it would have been much easier had she left it as is. </s>
<s> Can you think of any solution to finding the right drivers, short of paying those jerks at dell who won't even talk to me unless I pay them? </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Great news! </s>
<s> I got it working. </s>
<s> Installed the correct mouse drivers, and even figured out the ethernet controller drivers also. </s>
<s> Now, my last challenge is how to transfer my files and programs from my old computer to my new one. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> I have an ethernet canle to join the two, and have set up a network. </s>
<s> Do I just copy from one to the other, or is there another method which must be followed? </s>
<s> I have tried copying and pasting, but things still don't show up on my new comoputer. </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks again! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> That has to do with a change in Windows circa 1995. </s>
<s> Your files however will be just a copy and paste. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I really just wanted to say thank you again for the huge help you've been! </s>
<s> I couldn't have done it without you! </s>
<s> Happy Holidays! </s>
<s> And thanks for the kind post. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
