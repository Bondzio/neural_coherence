<s> If not, how can I make the drive so it is seeable and able to be used again and remove what is on it and make it so I can add files to it again? </s>
<s> What products or services do I need and how much will they cost? </s>
<s> Is there a download on CNet's site that will work for me? </s>
<s> If not, do you know of anything elsewhere? </s>

<s> Also the name of a company. </s>
<s> I have had no need to look elsewhere and this top post is to avoid duplicating the answer to this question(s). </s>
