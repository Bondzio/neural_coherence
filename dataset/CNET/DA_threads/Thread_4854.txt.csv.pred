1.1.1	Excellent article on the future of the SSDs.	St
1.1.2	Hard disk manufacturer Seagate has published an extraordinary report all but proving that solid-state disk (SSD) technology will remain niche for the next decade or two, at least.	St
1.1.3	http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/217883/ssds_doomed_says_seagate.html	St
1.2.1	Maybe this is where we'll have L1 disk storage and L2 disk storage and L3 disk storage access.	St
1.2.2	Explainer?	St
1.2.3	Look up how L1, L2 and L3 CPU CACHE systems work on CPUs today.	St
1.2.4	Maybe not everything needs to be on now costly SSD?	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	seeing Seagate is the laggard in SSD.	St
1.3.2	FUD won't work and it is Seagate which will become the niche player, in high end high cap disks for servers, cloud and externals.	St
1.3.3	Unfortunately for disk mfrs, none have made an aggressive move to counter the disruption of SSDs.	St
1.3.4	Too bad, and sad, to see more storied brands and companies become invisible to consumers.	St
1.4.1	I read that SSD will be the storage or front-end boot device for laptops and game PCs.	St
1.4.2	They're not going away and if Seagate is right, pricing is a factor holding back but only for the time being.	St
1.4.3	Once the NAND memory gets geared-up I don't see where it can't be the prime storage or boot device not long from now.	St
1.4.4	While current HDs do just fine and hold the storage maximums, I'm sure there will be a mix of storage later.	Sug
1.4.5	SSD are bound to jump in where the current iPods and Druids will rule once offered.	St
1.4.6	SSD are also going into devcies not 100% PC, but immediate storage doe say on printers and possibly stand-alone systems.	St
1.4.7	As for myself, I'm quite happy w/o any SSD, since my storage needs are easily meant, traditionally.	St
1.4.8	It would nice to have SSD as a flash drive and mount it and get all those s/w tools and what-nots for a field repair.	St
1.4.9	tada -----Willy	St
1.5.1	Because they think they have a better crystal ball?	St
1.5.2	10 years is a long time (except maybe for an old man like me, hehe).	St
1.5.3	I remember the 5.25&quot; 40mb.	St
1.5.4	harddrive for a couple hundred dollars.	St
1.5.5	At that time I thought it was for niche market also.	St
1.5.6	I certainly couldn't afford it.	St
