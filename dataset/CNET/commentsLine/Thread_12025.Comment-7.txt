the units with cellular are rarely outside the normal carrier channels for well discussed reasons.
i can't cover this in full detail but here we use the run of the mill tablets but a hotspot box for the reason i gave and more.
you seemed concerned with costs so it seems you either forge an alliance with the cellular carrier or take a big risk in importing something.
i've seen a few try that here and they get burned later.
but folk will continue to try it.
