I'm using Paperport 8 and the software seems to work but the driver doesn't seem to work correctly. First: I have a P4, XP-PRO, 256MB Ram and two hard drives. I tried the compatibility wizard and the program just crashed. Without the compatibility mode the program works with older scans completely but when I try to scan or preview an image the program does some funny things. It will start the scan and never quit making multiple copies of the image and I can't close the scan window. Is anyone running this setup? Do I have to upgrade (buy new) my scanner? Thanks in advance, Denny

I have had a few clients that were burned by this, Visioneer just decided it wasn't worth it. You need to buy a new scanner if you want to run XP. Fortunately USB scanners are under $100.

For much less that 100USB you find complete units like (excuse the vendor link) http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=HPSJ4400C-N which includes updated software to use with your updated OS. Bob PS. I have a few HP scanners and they seem OK.

I went to Sam's Club and bought a OneTouch 9220 Visioneer and it is working wonderfully. I stuck with Visioneer because I like the Paperport 8 software. The scanner is 4800 x 2400 and it only cost $80. It was worth the cost to get rid of the headache with the compatibility problems. I'm almost up to par with the XP configuration and so far(although a lot of work) I like it better. Thanks again, Denny
