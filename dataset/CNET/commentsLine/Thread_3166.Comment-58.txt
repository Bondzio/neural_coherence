it has been my experience that they do in fact have a life expectancy.
as with conventional hard drives like in your pc the external drive has moving parts, platers, heads, and hopefully a fan.
they are a normal drive with a fancy package.
my question would be do you leave in on all the time or only when backing up files?
some things to make it last longer would be keep it as cool as possible while it is on.
try not to move it while it is writing or reading data.
similar to a cd walk-man if your jogging and listening to the cd it can bump the disc into the internals while it's spinning and damage the disc.
the tollerances inside the drive are very tight.
it is possible to scratch the platters while they're spinning.
bottom line if you're worried about it failing make hard copies to disc or get a new external.
when chosing a new one look for a model that you can replace the drive.
your current one might be replaceable too.
check your documentation or manufacturers web site.
one more idea.
some web services offer online back ups.
all ways better safe than sorry.
best of luck.
