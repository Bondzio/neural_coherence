<s> Five days ago my computer crashed. </s>
<s> When i tried booting it up again I got a message that said Windows XP could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt: \WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\CONFIG\SOFTWARE. </s>
<s> I was able to repair it however and lost only the my documents folder. </s>
<s> however, a few days later it crashed again, this time the erorr being invalid system disk. </s>
<s> i then reformated and reinstalled XP. </s>
<s> Now, my computer is crashing every few hours with the invalid system disk error. </s>
<s> the first time i was able to restart and xp started but now i am getting a blue screen that says something has happened so windows cant start. </s>
<s> i used diagnosis programs to test my hard drive and ram but they said everything is fine. </s>
<s> the temperature of the cpu is around 56 C. Does anyone have any ideas as to what could be wrong? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> p.s. </s>
<s> my computer is a Athlon XP 2000+ with 256mb DDR and has been working fine for a little less than a year. </s>
<s> Your information is a little light. </s>
<s> Such as if XP was all patched up, the BIOS current, the motherboard and more drivers updated by YOU (Microsoft doesn't handle this!) </s>
<s> and if you have an great big oversized power supply. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> XP was all patched and drivers updated. </s>
<s> However, I never checked for a BIOS uppdate. </s>
<s> My powersupply is 350 watts and I do not have that much connected to my computer, one optical drive (CD-RW), smart card reader, floppy, and agp graphics card. </s>
<s> It's also less than it was when new. </s>
<s> You can do some tests by unplugging the CD/DVD drives to free up some Watts and also leave the cover off to see if the issue subsides. </s>
<s> You can review the following two links to see if your PSU is really 350 and if that's a proper selection. </s>
<s> Read http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/20040122/ And why you need MORE than that rating? </s>
<s> (Hint, try 450 Watts!) </s>

<s> You may have a bad hard drive. </s>
<s> Try installing a new hard drive(borrow or buy one). </s>
<s> Install your operating system on it and it should work. </s>
