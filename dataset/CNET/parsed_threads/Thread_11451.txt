<s> It used to work on my HP laptop running Vista Home Premium. </s>
<s> The mouse driver has different name than before now for some reason, it's now called &quot;HID-compliant mouse&quot;. </s>
<s> When I click on &quot;update driver&quot; it says I have the latest, but the driver is from 2006. </s>
<s> I used to have a Logitech control panel but now it's gone. </s>
<s> Doesn't give me the option to rollback driver. </s>
<s> Should I uninstall the driver, unplug mouse, and then plug it back in hoping I will get my old Logitech driver back? </s>
<s> In fact I'm using a few Logitech mice without ever installing the driver from Logitech. </s>
<s> That's my preferred mode of operation. </s>
<s> In closing. </s>
<s> Any batteries? </s>
<s> So yes I should uninstall driver? </s>
<s> I want to get my old driver back. </s>
<s> WHy do you not use the Logitech driver? </s>

<s> Check the first reply. </s>
<s> As to batteries. </s>

<s> Is that a Logitech rechargable mouse, or are you using rechargable batteries in non rechargable mouse, not recommeded. </s>
<s> it's rechargeable with a base station, I'm using the batteries that came with it </s>
<s> That's one reason I pop fresh alkalines in when I must be sure. </s>
<s> Sorry to resurrect this topic but I'm trying to get this mouse working again, so I'm thinking of testing it with regular AA batteries. </s>
<s> Are you sure it won't damage anything if I pop in regular AA batteries into the mouse (I believe the model number is Logitech MX500) instead of using the rechargeable batteries that came with it? </s>
<s> This person put regular batteries in their phone that normally takes rechargeable batteries and the regular batteries ended up melting, so I'm worried about that: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081115051609AAp3Vha </s>
<s> Sorry but why would I overthink this? </s>
<s> Wouldn't I move to doing? </s>
<s> If you can't do this, that's OK, ask a friend to do this test. </s>
