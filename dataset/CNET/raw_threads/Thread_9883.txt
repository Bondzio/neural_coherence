Thank-you! XP SP2 and Office 2007 with 2GB RAM and 52GB storage.

Comes with their software program plus the back up hardware is a drive in itself, copying &quot;everything&quot; I have on my computer including programs and not just data. Priced at close to $200....My T43 is 80GB but could get the portable back up system sized at 80, 100 & 120 - 80GB about $176, 100 and 120 not too significantly higher in price. I'm a realtor and need to have a complete reliance on &quot;no loss of my work&quot; which has been years saved on this laptop; I'm virtually unemployed if this system goes down or I cannot retrieve and use it 24/7! Is there another recommendation you could make for a better product around the same price range, CMS already pricey; CMS though seems very reputable...three year warranty with technical help should I need any. Their retail outlets charge a little less, but only a one year warranty and may not be too much above something refurbished. CAN YOU SUGGEST ANOTHER PRODUCT EQUALLY AS GOOD, or a better alternative than CMS?

It's a sort of two in one: it's for backup and if my computer fails/crashes, as I said this is a drive I could use...I'm told it would be copied exactly as the one I'd be copying from. I'm not worried about other elements for I work at home mostly using the laptop where it's safer conditions. I'm really a novice with most of the technology and need all the advice I can get. I found out today I can purchase the ABS 100GB for my 80GB LAPTOP at $187...no tax, no shipping and hopefully no headaches. Is this a fair purchase WITH my circumstances?...like I said I wondered about other one's like La Cie and one that starts with a Western...sorry cannot think of the name; there are others but too much technology is confusing me. I need baby steps!

A single USB hard disk fails so many points in what we have defined backtup to be over the years that it's not a valid backup. Nice fast copy but it fails the definition and will likely fail your written goals. -&gt; Let's move to the dollar solution? Bob
