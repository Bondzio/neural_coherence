1.1.1	Hello I have a Vaio VGA-VA10G.	St
1.1.2	I need to replace the optical drive,any help would be appreciated.	St
1.1.3	Thanks lriecks1	St
1.2.1	Do you mean VGC-VA10G?	St
1.2.2	If so, can you get the old drive out to see if it's a standard type design or proprietary?	St
1.2.3	If it's just and industry standard drive, you just buy one equivalent to what you just took out and put the new one in its place.	St
1.2.4	If it's proprietary, you go to Sony or look for places that sell parts from used machines.	St
