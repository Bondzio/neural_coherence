you don't have to replace it with like size/type.
a 40gb should work nicely.
if you buy new, get a western digital.
their setup software will basically 'clone' your current system drive.
make sure it's installed as the slave drive first.
then 'clone' the system drive to it.
then replace the old drive with the new one.
reboot (making sure it grabs the new one) and you will have a new system drive.
let us know how it turns out.
and life goes on... jack
