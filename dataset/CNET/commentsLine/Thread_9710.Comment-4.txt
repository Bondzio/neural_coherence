thanks for all the suggestions.
i reset bios defaults without any success.
i then disconnected the dvd-rom and connected that cable to the hd.
the computer booted fine.
but then i took the cable in the primary slot and moved it to the secondary slot(the one that the dvd-rom was in).
after this the computer would not boot again.
in other words the cable was bad the whole time.
once again thanks for the help.
james
