1.1.1	I have a Maxtor OneTouch III Turbo Edition 600 GB FireWire 400/800 and USB 2.0 Hard Drive, which you can see at this site: http://www.superwarehouse.com/Maxtor_OneTouch_III_Turbo_Edition_600_GB_FireWire_400_800_and_USB_2.0_Hard_Drive/G01Y006/ps/726077 I just ordered this enclosure: Galaxy METAL GEAR Metal Gear Box 3500SAP-SESIL Aluminum 3.5&quot; Silver USB 2.0 External Enclosure - Retail http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817716016 But I don't think they are compatible.	St
1.1.2	The connectors don't seem to match, and there are two hard drives in the Maxtor, so should I have bought two enclosures or one that fits both into it?	St
1.1.3	I tried to connect one of the hard drives into the Metal Gear Box, but the white plastic connector wasn't the same as the one to the Maxtor HD.	St
1.1.4	Can anyone advise me to a compatible enclosure or tell me what I'm doing wrong?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	There are enclosures from that same company but for SATA hard disks.	St
1.2.2	Does this picture look like your drive cable and connections -&gt; https://www-304.ibm.com/systems/support/supportsite.wss/sata2.jpg If so, you need to shop for the SATA drive housing.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the advice.	St
1.3.2	The maxtor has 2 300 GB drives, so should I get 2 SATA enclosures?	St
1.4.1	Would this one work for the two 300GB hds?	St
1.4.2	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16816702019	St
1.5.1	The Maxtor case no longer work?	St
1.6.1	That's not an USB 2.0 housing and would stress most owners to get it connected.	St
1.6.2	Why not the usual USB 2.0 housings that support a sata drive?	St
1.7.1	Can you please find what you're talking about and send me a link?	Ques
1.7.2	I'm not understanding what you mean.	St
1.7.3	And what happened was that I put a power adapter that was too strong into the Maxtor external HD, so it didn't read on my computer anymore.	St
1.7.4	The LED light kept flashing, but not steadily.	St
1.7.5	Thanks.	St
1.8.1	You mean: too high voltage, like 20 V in stead of 10?	St
1.8.2	That might damage more than just the enclosure, but also the electronics of the disk itself.	St
1.8.3	No guarantees they work even in the right enclosure.	St
1.8.4	In that case, all you can do with it is throw the disks away.	St
