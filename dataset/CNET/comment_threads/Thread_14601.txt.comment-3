Then any resolution will do.
I once had a plasma (480p) and it looks great.
If the tv doesn't have a VGA connection, then you want you the highest resolution you can afford (1080p would be nice) and the video output connection that matches the tv, ideally because you don't want to mess with adapter (just my thought).
