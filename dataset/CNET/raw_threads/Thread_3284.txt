And out of know where my computer will reboot on it's own so I installed a &quot;Anti-Crash&quot; program and this is still happening?. And I also turned back the clock on my computer as it were and still this is happening?. And my family or I will be working on the computer and again out of know where the computer will reboot?. Now I get a Microsoft message that says that I had a &quot;Device Error&quot; and one time I got a &quot;Hardware Error&quot; and I have uninstalled &quot;EVERY!!&quot; on my computer one at a time and still this happens. In fact it happened again yesterday and I got another &quot;Device Error&quot; message. And when I set up my computer to leave the blue screen and I have all of these long numbers and when I contacted my computer maker they didn't even know what to make of it and this is a custome built system. So can you &quot;PLEASE!!!!!!!!!&quot; help me with my situation??????

Hopefully you still have the record of stop errors and/or event ids that are causing you trouble. If you would post them here or email them to me at zanthor@sbcglobal.net , I would happily sort through them and research a solution to your problem. Zanthor
