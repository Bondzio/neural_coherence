1.1.1	Hi , I have a software that runs off a parallel port dongle .	St
1.1.2	I recently got a new laptop that does not have a parallel port .	St
1.1.3	I bought a USB to parallel port cable , but it supports only printers .	St
1.1.4	How can I make the software recognize the dongle ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	Said protection dongles rarely use the virtual parallel port but read the port directly .	St
1.2.2	If this was me I would have tried a PC-Card parallel port first since I know the limitations of USB parallel ports .	St
1.2.3	Then again I do n't know if your laptop is PC-Card or Express .	St
1.2.4	For one company product we had to return the old parallel port dongle for a new spiffy USB one .	St
1.2.5	That fixed our issue .	St
1.2.6	The bottom line is that the software company should offer this support at bare minimum and if they have gone away then what happens when the dongle is lost , stolen or blown ?	Ques
1.2.7	I hope you have a plan .	St

1.3.1	Hi Bob , Thanks for your quick response .	St
1.3.2	The laptop is a Dell 9400 Inspiron ( I believe Express ) .	St
1.3.3	Returning the parallel dongle for a USB is going to be an expensive proposition - hence am looking for alternatives .	St
1.3.4	I heard that the Targus replicator may address the issue .	St
1.3.5	Would you be able to shed some light on it ?	Ques
1.4.1	Our exchange cost was only 200 bucks .	St
1.4.2	Cheaper than the time we would have lost futzing and fuming over this .	St
1.4.3	Even at a new license of 1,200 bucks we would have done this since it 's livelihood .	St
1.4.4	I guess you have to answer this yourself .	St
1.4.5	Some discussions go like this - & gt ; http : //www.embeddedrelated.com/usenet/embedded/show/56768-1.php You have n't told much about what you have so I ca n't guess what would work .	St
1.4.6	Maybe it 's one I 've run into ( I do embedded work and have used too many dongled softwares . )	St
1.4.7	You can also flip back to a desktop to fix this .	St
1.4.8	Bob	St
1.5.1	Guys I have the same problem that Windows XP does n't ask for a driver for it , instead it just adds a USB printing service or something strange so stupid I want to see the Virtual LPT port which seem to be almost impossible now .	St
1.5.2	I installed windows 98 back trying to figure where is the problem and windows 98 worked perfectly .	St
1.5.3	Does anybody has a solution please let me know	Ques
1.6.1	Try to make a complete post .	St
1.7.1	Hi , I have an old dongle and need a solution like you did .	St
1.7.2	Did you ever find a good one ?	Ques
1.7.3	thanks	Polite
1.8.1	But it may not work for you or your application .	St
1.8.2	Try this .	St
1.8.3	Make a new complete post with all the needed details and maybe someone will share what they use for your machine , application and what you need to plug into it .	St
1.8.4	Bob	St
