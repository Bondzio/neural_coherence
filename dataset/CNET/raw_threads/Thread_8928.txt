There are models available that will enclose an IDE (PATA) or SATA HD. Your local computer and electronics stores carry them. Cheapest prices are usually found online. Adapters without a case are available as a nice temporary solution. Example: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16812156101 NOTE: Connecting an external HD to a Windows XP machine via USB 2.0 has a better track record than Firewire. There are also some models that connect to an external SATA port.
