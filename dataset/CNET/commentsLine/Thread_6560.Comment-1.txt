i have an external harddrive that i use to back up my pc, but i am running out of room to store files (lots of graphics).
i don't really want to save my graphics files to cd because i like to have easy access to them.
should i purchase another internal or external harddrive, and if so, how would i then backup the files stored on these?
i'm a newbie to hardware issues, so i appreciate any help you may offer.
thank you very much!
