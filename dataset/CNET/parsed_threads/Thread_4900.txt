<s> Morning everyone - I'm currently researching/looking for a 8 port, Layer 5, Load Balancing Switch. </s>
<s> I was wondering if anyone could provide me w/ some some insight as to what your company may be using and also what you may recommend. </s>
<s> I have already spent a tremendous amount of money upgrading our network and this addition is absolutely necessary but we are trying to acquire a LBS at a reasonable price but of high reliability. </s>
<s> Thank you in advance! </s>
<s> -CK </s>
<s> Pick up the phone and call Cisco. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I posted this to find out if their were any products people would recommend, obviously cisco would say that the 11501 switch is the obvious route. </s>
<s> A co-worker and myself have come up w/ a product that will do the job, turns out we've decided not to go w/ Cisco. </s>
<s> I really appreciate the time and effort that you put into your exstensive and highly detailed reponse Bob. </s>
<s> Seems to me it was delivered in a mocking manner. </s>
<s> I was on the phone w/ Nortel and Cisco yesterday for about an hour a piece. </s>
<s> If you talk to the usual outlets that sell a lot of network gear, they may let out a clue what would be a clone of the Cisco/Nortel product. </s>
<s> But what I've learned is to plug in the Cisco box, configure it and go home. </s>
<s> It's a lesson you learn after this much time. </s>
<s> Best of luck, Bob </s>
<s> How could I infer 'mocking' in so few words? </s>
<s> I'm sharing my insight after 2+ decades of networking. </s>
<s> If you don't value it, then that's OK. </s>
<s> But I will treat you with respect anyway and wish you happy hunting. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I apologize Bob I obviously misinterpreted your response. </s>
<s> I appreciate your response and I also appreciate your expertise in this area. </s>
<s> I did in fact call cisco and although they did provide me w/ some answers they quickly transferred my questioning to an engineer that provided me w/ less information then their sales team did. </s>
<s> Cisco is a valued product in the networking world but I was shocked at how limited their responses were to my questions. </s>
<s> Maybe I got the wrong person on the phone, I'll give it a shot again tomorrow. </s>
<s> On a separate note Bob I was wondering if a solution that we have created would work: Their will be an internet connection coming into a failover switch. </s>
<s> That switch is connected to Webserver 1 and Webserver 2. </s>
<s> Each of those webservers is then connected to a second failover switch which is then connected to database 1 and 2. </s>
<s> I have recently learned that it doesn't matter which database server the information is written to because we will be using replication software for that purpose. </s>
<s> Could you possibly forsee any problems with the flow of information on a small solution of this type. </s>
<s> Much thanks again! </s>

<s> You can read further what Microsoft has noted at http://www.microsoft.com/technet/archive/itsolutions/ecommerce/deploy/duwwsr.mspx Specifically they mention &quot;Cisco LocalDirector, F5 Networks's BIG-IP, and Alteon Websystems ACEdirector&quot; The limited responses (from Cisco) are due to an overload of people asking questions to those that will respond. </s>
<s> Even my responses are often short due to the facts that: a. I don't get paid for this. </s>
<s> b. I expect people to research as much as they can. </s>
<s> c. I am not going to shop for anybody. </s>
<s> That's your work, not mine. </s>
<s> Item c may inflame you but item a explains it. </s>
<s> -&gt; I've learned not to cheap out or overanalyze switchs and network hardware. </s>
<s> I also learned never to get a power supply or UPS just big enough to do the job. </s>
<s> To recap: Be sure you are not overdoing it. </s>
<s> Too many times I've found: a. </s>
<s> The person was building a supertanker to transport 5 gallons of content. </s>
<s> b. </s>
<s> The person has a gigibit serving server, but connected to a kilobit connection. </s>
<s> c. It wasn't their line of business. </s>
<s> More about item c. Just a fews months ago I finished a consult with a business. </s>
<s> They were growing and having severe machine pains. </s>
<s> What I discovered was the company's owner's son was building the machines. </s>
<s> From server to desktop. </s>
<s> It was fine when there was just a handful of machines but now it was out of control with each machine a masterpiece of what was out that week. </s>
<s> We tossed the server down to the pit and put in a Dell server and started acquiring simple Dell machines as we needed for the users. </s>
<s> This cured that in nothing flat. </s>
<s> Point? </s>
<s> Their business was not building PCs. </s>
<s> They needed to return to doing what they did best. </s>
<s> The same problem existed with their website. </s>
<s> They had consults that were more than willing to help them build web servers, get high speed connections and write the code to make it all go. </s>
<s> Again, we tossed that out and went with a web server company. </s>
<s> They are now online at some 100 bucks a month. </s>
<s> At first they thought the monthly fee was high until we put it on a spreadsheet with 1 and 2 years projected costs for the do it yourself solution. </s>
<s> Point? </s>
<s> Is building a web server your business? </s>
