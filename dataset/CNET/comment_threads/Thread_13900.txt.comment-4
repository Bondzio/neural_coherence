Thanks for the replies.
I tried the Ubuntu disc solution from the first reply, but it did not seem to work.
The error message that I got when I first tried to mount the disk was: &quot;Unable to mount location DBus error org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NoReply: Did not receive a reply.
Possible causes include: the remote application did not send a reply, the message bus security policy blocked the reply, the reply timeout expired, or the network connection was broken.&quot; When I went through the steps and tried to force a mount anyway, I got an error message to the tone of: &quot;DBus error org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NoReply: Did not receive a reply.
Possible causes include: the remote application did not send a reply, the message bus security policy blocked the reply, the reply timeout expired, or the network connection was broken.&quot; I did some digging around and found another similar idea from howtogeek http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/15761/recover-data-like-a-forensics-expert-using-an-ubuntu-live-cd/ that uses the testdisk utility.
I will give that a shot.
Further thoughts?
