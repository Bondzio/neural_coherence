This prevents her getting up to speed and might well lead to repetitive stress injuries down the road, I'm told. Is there a keyboard available that isn't a toy that is made for smaller-than-average persons? It would need to be pretty much a standard keyboard, but with reduced key size and/or spacing - number pad optional. I'm presently looking at the 83-key Low Profile Mini Keyboard sold by Ergonomic Resources, but I don't know who actually makes it. Can someone give us advice? Thanks!

I use a few 83 key mini keyboards for servers and at booths to save space. After picking up one I found more for 20 bucks at game sellers. It's the one they sell for the PS2 that connects with USB. While they don't tell you it works with a PC, it does and at under 20 bucks not a big investment. Bob

Chinese characters aren't required here, just plain old European. Is this sort of thing available at Circuit City, CompUSA and the like? Thanks - Terry

The unit may have been boxed as a PS2 USB Keyboard which had some other name such as KingMax on it. All this confuses the issues here since it's a generic product with many suppliers and in many packages. Let me ask if the maker is a needed piece of information to purchase such a keyboard? I picked these up at EBGames, Best Buy but don't venture to Circuit City so I can't answer that. Bob
