1.1.1	About a year about I bought a 160 GB drive that I added to my current computer to store my huge music collection and other files.	St
1.1.2	I want to buy a new computer and to install this as my second drive.	St
1.1.3	Will I need to re-format this drive when I add it, and will I lose everything on it?	St
1.1.4	Old computer runs XP, new one will run Vista.	St
1.1.5	I'm not sure how I could back-up all the files on the drive before moving it - I guess I could save the files on the primary drive of the new computer but that would require me to use a key drive to transfer 1 GB at a time, and I'd have to switch my monitor over each time as I'm using the monitor from my old computer for the new one.	St
1.1.6	Any tips?	St
1.2.1	But if you have anything other than a BASIC partition or used dynamic disks or EFS then all bets are off.	St
