1.1.1	Hi all.	St
1.1.2	I just built a new PC (Asus A8N, Athlon 64 3200, Corsair Value Ram, Msi NX 6600GT and my old 200Gb Maxtor).	St
1.1.3	Already while installing, I encountered problems : the &quot; Error loading operating system&quot; message was resolved by switching translation method used to access the hard drive from the default setting &quot;Auto&quot; to &quot;Large&quot;.	St
1.1.4	After that, I installed XP, without problems.	St
1.1.5	Even though I was able to restart that install, as soon as I changed anything in XP (drivers, added SP1, ...), and was unable to reboot the OS: the message &quot; Windows XP could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt: \WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\CONFIG\SYSTEM&quot;.	St
1.1.6	This apparently means that the registry is corrupt.	St
1.1.7	If http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;307545 explains how to repair windows, it is useless, since there is something causing the corruption of the reg (I formatted and installed XP 3 times).	St
1.1.8	But what ?	Ques
1.1.9	Apparently, there is an issue with the HDD (see problem 1), which is a partitioned (50 Gb &quot;system&quot;, and 150 Gb &quot;files&quot;, NTFS).	St
1.1.10	At the first install, windows sait that it had to check the files on the HDD, which lasted maybe 15 min (some where corrupt), something which I had never seen... (no probs with old PC) Another little issue is the 12 V supply which goes under normal value (at 11.45, in red in BIOS, which sometines causes the PC to stop at boot).	St
1.1.11	Supply is 380 Watt Asus, which should suffice.	St
1.1.12	I checked many forums about that 2nd error message; but no one seems to have an idea where it comes from (virus, spyware, memora issues, MB issues, ...).	St
1.1.13	I already spent many hours on that machine, and I'd appreciate if anybody could help...	St
1.1.14	Thanks a lot, Claus	St
1.2.1	into this new system.	St
1.2.2	I might invest in a new PS as well as a new HD.	St
1.3.1	is maybe 6 months old...	St
1.3.2	But thanks !	Polite
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	into a different system are quite usual.	St
1.5.2	Maybe remove the old, clear out that partition, do a new install and Windows Product Activiation.	St
1.5.3	The new mobo certainly uses the 12 volts to supply power to the CPU's onboard regulators [the old one may have used 3.3 or 5 volts for that].	St
1.5.4	Does your PS have two separate plus 12 volt rails or just one?	St
1.5.5	I would like a +/- 3% tolerance [0.360 volts], so going below 11.64 may not be too good.	St
1.5.6	What tolerance does the supply show on its nameplate??	St
1.5.7	?	Ques
1.6.1	That 200Gb will be quite the troublemaker with an original XP (no SP1/SP2) CD.	St
1.6.2	If you partitioned the drive before installing XP, it will likely just hang somewhere down the road.	St
1.6.3	-&gt; Fix?	St
1.6.4	Go make a XP SP2 slipstreamed CD to get the hard disk properly supported.	St
1.6.5	Bob	St
1.7.1	Thanks all for your suggestions.	St
1.7.2	About the OS: Bob, I use a non sp XP cd, you're right.	St
1.7.3	The weird thing is that once I installed the OS, everything seemed to work, untill I rebooted.	St
1.7.4	I'll try to borrow a friend's vesion.	Sug
1.7.5	By the way, I cleared the old XP before I started install.	St
1.7.6	About the Power supply: I'm not at home currently.	St
1.7.7	I'll post the values tomorrow.	Sug
1.7.8	Thanks all, Claus	St
