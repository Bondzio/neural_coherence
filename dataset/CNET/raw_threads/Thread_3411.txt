I know that the wireless not working is an oft asked question, but I have browsed through what I thought were relevant threads and also the first sticky thread and I can't find what I'm doing wrong (or maybe it's there somewhere, but I have no idea how to use the solutions given?). Hopefully someone can help me out or point me in the right direction. I have set up my network in the suggested way in the sticky thread, with the exception of setting the WPA. When I select the WPA option, it doesn't give me any place to input a password? So I have it set on the WEP-64 bits (umm..is that bad?). It is now wall --&gt; cable modem --&gt; wireless router --&gt; pc/laptop It all worked fine before, until I formatted my PC. I must have mucked around with some settings and since the format, I can't connect my laptop to the router wirelessly. When I plug my PC to the router with an ethernet cable, it works fine, same with the laptop. On my laptop, I can see the SSID there when I search for networks, but it fails to connect because it 'is not receiving a response from the router or access point'. I have attempted unplugging and replugging, and powering off and on, and resetting both the modem and the router. I've tried reinstalling the driver and utilities. I'm fairly certain it's something in the settings of the router that I've got wrong, rather than the router being broken, as it was working fine before the format. I tried my brothers laptop as well, and it also couldn't connect because there was no reponse. The modem is a Motorola SB5101, the router is a Diamond Digital R100. My PC is running on XP and my laptop is running on Vista. Let me know if there's any other info needed? Any help would be much appreciated, this is driving me insane.

If that works I reset the router to factory settings and then set it up AGAIN per our forum sticky. Without that test you're never sure where the issue is.

Is that kind of the same as testing it at a free wifi hotspot...? Having done that, I've tried resetting the router several times already and gone through the setup process as per the sticky and using the manual. The lights are all blinking as normal, too.

You'll need a wired connection to the router to do this. Make sure it will handle giving out DHCP addresses. On you laptop, if you are trying to use the wireless card's configuration utility, I suggest using the Windows one instead. Make sure that, if your router handles the IP addresses, your laptop's wireless device is set to DHCP. With this basic configuration, you should be able to connect. You should see an &quot;acquiring IP address message&quot;. This should mean that the laptop and router at least acknowledge each other's presence. If this works, you can begin to reapply the security features. I must think that, if you can select WPA as an option, there's a way to plug in your code/passphrase. Not always are these on the same screen in the router configuration. You may need to search for it. These security settings can be picky. You'll see some wanting hex and some alpha/numeric. Some won't accept certain characters and some are fairly free with what you can plug in. You'll likely have to type in a long code two or more times. What I've found simpler is to type it out once in something like Notepad. Save the file and put it on a flash drive or some such. You can copy and past the code into the appropriate boxes for both your router and laptop. This helps eliminate those maddening typos where you know it wasn't your mistake. Good luck.

I set it up again from scratch and made a tiny improvement in that my laptop would connect for a while (a minute or so) before disconnecting itself. I've bought a new router, so I'm praying the problem is the old router and not the settings, or else I've just bought a new router that won't work either Thanks again.
