Everything is going to be wired with a gigabit router.
The reason I'm not sure about the computer is that even though the motherboard says it only supports 10/100, in the device manager it says I have &quot;Realtek RTL8168B/8111B family PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet NIC (NDIS 6.0)&quot;.
I know that it is built on to the motherboard.
