Well the problem is not my partition software but the hdd, while formatting and creating the partitions for it i received an error that the process couldn't be completed and then it stopped being recognized by the PC.
Everytime i connect the hdd i receive a message saying that the USB driver could not be installed however it was working before i made the format and partition processes.
