<s> More than one of the above selections (Tell us more.) </s>
<s> Other (What is it?) </s>
<s> Lee: It depends on WHAT it is for, have used pretty much all of the methods mentioned but generally use an external HDD {portable for L/T). </s>
<s> Also have several flash drives and sometimes burn data to hard copy, DVD/CD. </s>
<s> I have a stack of formatted floppies around here somewhere can't think of a good reason to keep them so they will likely disappear in the near future. </s>
<s> Best regards. </s>
<s> Other machines on the LAN. </s>
<s> Use scheduled, selective B/U. </s>
<s> I use a Seagate 500gb external drive, and put some content on CD's or DVD's as well. </s>
<s> I have my Drobo setup as a NAS off my Airport Extreme that I backup all my important stuff to plus I use Jungle Disk offsite for my really important stuff. </s>
<s> resides on a networked file server that is scanned nightly for virus and then backed up 2 generations to mirrored disks. </s>
<s> Also keep a weekly full data backup on mirrored hard disk stored remotely. </s>
<s> OS, programs and profiles never backed up since they can be re-installed. </s>
<s> I'm a fairly active amateur potographer, and lover of old-style contemporary jazz, and wanted a means of storing both photos and music files off of my hard-drive and have immediate access to the data, plus a a fairly easy means of accomplishing backups. </s>
<s> Following what I considered extensive research on the avilable means of storing backups I settled on the HP Media Vault MV-210. </s>
<s> It is connected through my Verizon FIOS router, provides scheduled backups of My Documents, Photos, and Music files. </s>
<s> The NV-2120 comes with one 500GB hard drive with the ability to double that capacity with the addition of a second 500GB hard drive. </s>
<s> I've had the device for approximately six months, have approximately 250GB of data (both music and phptos) stored on it, and have become quite comfortable with its features. </s>
<s> It just sits on the corner of my work area and automatically takes care of backups. </s>
<s> Then it tells me when it is performing a backup and then goes back to sleep. </s>
<s> Occasionally, just for peace of mind, I check the stored data by actually listening to music stored on the drive or viewing and edditing pictures that are out there. </s>
<s> I hope that helps. </s>
<s> For everyday backups I use an external hard drive. </s>
<s> Every week or two, though, I select some of my older data and back it up to CD or DVD. </s>
<s> I make two copies of each disk. </s>
<s> Only then will I allow the data to be removed from my hard drive. </s>
<s> I do not consider an external drive to be a permanent solution. </s>
<s> I also insist that I have at least 2 completely separate copies of the data before I consider it backed up. </s>
<s> I like my system. </s>
<s> It allows me to make a copy of my data quickly and easily. </s>
<s> I just have enough sense to know that the quick copy is not entirely secure, so I have another method I use regularly. </s>
<s> Denise </s>
<s> I have learned some lessons over time and I've progressed so far. </s>
<s> It's ironic that this post came up too because I just had an external hard drive go on me! </s>
<s> I had purchased a Maxtor OneTouch III 320GB external hard drive to backup to and it was good until about a month ago (14 months of occasional and not being plugged in). </s>
<s> The enclosure first had a short then the PCB (printed circuit board) fried. </s>
<s> By the way if anybody has a Seagate ST3320620A with firmware 3.AAD, help please! </s>
<s> Learn from me, as enticing a retail buy may be, build your own external hard drive. </s>
<s> If you know how to install RAM and reformat a drive, you have the right skills to do it. </s>
<s> Do your research on types of hard drives if you're not sure about terms and types of hard drives are on the market. </s>
<s> My best advise would be to find a pair of identical hard drives and an enclosure with RAID1 (array of hard discs) with mirror support. </s>
<s> Depending on what you want in terms of capacity, it'll probably cost a couple hundred. </s>
<s> In most cases, your choices may cost less than buying retail. </s>
<s> Don't forget to look for an enclosure which can dissipate heat and maybe have a fan. </s>
<s> A RAID1 is my next action in saving my data. </s>
<s> I hope this time it works to my advantage! </s>
<s> I have two external hard drives to which I regularly back up my files. </s>
<s> On the smaller (100 GB WD)drive I store my Windows OneCare Backup information (Music, Financial, and other data files). </s>
<s> On the larger drive (500 GB Seagate Free Agent) I backed up my entire C Drive. </s>
<s> This extra bit of caution came in handy this past week when I got the urge to upgrade my trusty XP Professional to Vista (what was I thinking?) </s>
<s> After experiencing multiple problems with Vista, I simply formatted and wiped my C Drive, reinstalled Windows XP and restored my C Drive. </s>
<s> had a C Drive crash. </s>
<s> Since there's no easy way to &quot;downgrade&quot; from Vista back to XP, I simply formatted my C Drive, wiped it clean, and then reinstalled Windows XP. </s>
<s> Then I restored my C Drive without a single problem. </s>
<s> Every computer owner should have at least two external hard drives on which you schedule regular (at least weekly) backups. </s>
<s> This is fairly easy if you just back up you C drive and then schedule incremental backups for any changes. </s>
<s> with my really important data I back up onto an external drive. </s>
<s> I back up also onto my laptop and also to another family owned computor away from my home. </s>
<s> every month or so i also back up to a dvd. </s>
<s> My photos of which there are millions i have backed up on two copies of dvds.ad have most of the recent ones on PC and external drive. </s>
<s> a lot of my best photos are on pbase.com but i dont count that as a back up just as a sharing medium. </s>
<s> I know that murphys law states anything that can go wrong will go wrong but as long as my databases are secure and my photos reasonably secure i am happy. </s>
<s> Lee,I'm going to chime in my 2~cents worth-- I have used DVD-RAM for more than 14 years. </s>
<s> (b4 it was a ram like disc..more to the point, was a PD disc and was not 4.7Gb) I used PowerQuest then dump the image to the ram disc. </s>
<s> (if it was a full image of the &quot;c&quot; drive for example.) </s>
<s> I now use Ghost..it is just like PQ. </s>
<s> PowerQuest was &quot;THE&quot; program that many computer companies used for the &quot;quick restore&quot; feature that they promoted. </s>
<s> Symantec (formally Norton's) purchased PowerQuest and named it &quot;Ghost&quot;. </s>
<s> The Ram disc record just like a hard drive..they are not linear (spiral) recorders like DVD. </s>
<s> They access the disc faster than any DVD. </s>
<s> The disc is made differently than a DVD, there are no dye refection problem (i.e:-R). </s>
<s> these discs are extremely stable in most environments. </s>
<s> can be recorded more than a 1000 times! </s>
<s> and have a shelf life of a 100 years! </s>
<s> the medical industry has, and still uses them as a primary archival medium. </s>
<s> they are stored &quot;off site&quot; meaning they are not in the computer at all times. </s>
<s> i myself have NEVER had an issue with one at all. </s>
<s> i have stored them in a basement, on a shelf for over 8 years..the disc work fine. </s>
<s> just for S#%ts and giggles..i have even tested them in water for 6 months..not a problem. </s>
<s> A hardisk has to be exercised every so often or they will seize. </s>
<s> (interpeter failure, motor bearing grease harding, etc.) </s>
<s> Storing the drive is important too, the magnetic coating that is placed on the aluminum platters expands and contracts at a different rate than that of the platters, this has been taken into account during the design of the product. </s>
<s> however, to many fluctuations in tempature and humidity can cause the magnetic layer to lift..and destroy the drive. </s>
<s> The movie industry is grappling with this problem as we speak. </s>
<s> they are now taking digital movie information ( from parts of the film that were like.. digital effects, sound, outakes cut-ins etc..) and either moving it from a HDD and putting it on film, like Kodak's Vision 2 or the new Vision 3 film. </s>
<s> (can last over 100 years!) </s>
<s> and storing it and using DVD-RAM as another media for long term storage. </s>
<s> They have found that the hardisk has a life of non use of about 2~4 years. </s>
<s> DVD about 15 years. </s>
<s> before the data can't be read. </s>
<s> the RAM disc does not have these kinds of problems. </s>
<s> but has two others that i am aware of... 1, the disc only holds about 4.7 Gb of info, 2, will there be recorders around that will read the disc in a 100 years??? </s>
<s> same holds true for USB devices such as hardrives and the like???? </s>
<s> but right now the RAM-DISC is fine for me, it is robust and safe and darn near bullet proof. </s>
<s> Forget Blue-Ray, way too much info on a disc that is easly damaged. </s>
<s> Sony's way of making it desposable B4 it is usable. </s>
<s> (the information layer is only .01mm away from the surface of the disc in respect to the RAM-DISC about .5mm away from the surface..) Now that is a BIG difference! </s>
<s> That's my 2 cents worth. </s>
<s> using a mounted drive. </s>
<s> We create very little material to backup so this method works for us. </s>
<s> We started doing this after repeated failures using CDs/DVDs and Acronis. </s>
<s> Takes about 10 minutes and can backup everything but settings and programs, Emails are a little more complicated but everything else is very simple and quick to backup. </s>
<s> This thread is untracked. </s>
<s> Bang! </s>
<s> I do use DOS scripts with Robocopy to synchronize my data to a D-Link DNS-323 NAS, this have two seagates 500Gig in raid 1 and when this is done i also synchronize it with another low cost ADSTech 320Gig NAS. </s>
<s> This last one is small and portable so i can carry it with me. </s>
<s> Having a NAS on network is more interesting than having a USB drive because it can be accessed from any computer on the network at the same time. </s>
<s> Differents share can be done for every user and they can do their own backup to their shares. </s>
<s> I've only quickly scanned these discussions but I can believe that I haven't yet seen any mention of Apple's Time Capsule. </s>
<s> It's a wireless NAS solution that's platform neutral. </s>
<s> And if you happen to have a mac with leopard, backups are automatic with Time Machine. </s>
<s> My house has both Macs and PCs so this was the only thing that I could find where we could access files- with any relative ease - from both platforms... love it. </s>
<s> It's another great product from Apple. </s>
<s> I used an external drive until last year when the drive was hit by a power surge and I lost everything including up to 12,000 photos. </s>
<s> Hence I do not recommend this type of backup. </s>
<s> I now use DVD. </s>
<s> Hi, I have been using and subcribing to an online backup company called Carbonite. </s>
<s> It simply works exactly as it says and is so unobtrusive and seamless in its operation. </s>
<s> I seldom if ever recommend many products but this one is by far one of the best I've seen or indeed tried. </s>
<s> I used BT DigitalVault before but that was so user unfriemdly if you needed to restore, whereas Carbonite is as easy as reading your own drives in explorer. </s>
<s> Added to which I do not think there is any limit to the amount of storage and I'm over 20GB now. </s>
<s> The one big drawback i see with carbonite is that it, as yet, does not support removable storage I have a 500GB USB hardrive which it cannot see or recognise and so i have to be careful what i store on this drive, but I do understand that this may be resolved in the future realese. </s>
<s> The cost of a years subscription to Carbonite is really so cheap it far outweighs buying another hard drive for backup purposes and as I have aready mentioned in the subject line. </s>
<s> If its critical stuff then simply burn copies to CD or DVD disc's. </s>
<s> Cheers </s>
<s> I do use an old external Iomega 160GB hard drive as one. </s>
<s> But why don't people, especially those who can go inside the case of a PC, add a 2nd hard drive and also back up there. </s>
<s> That is what I do as well. </s>
<s> My backup system: VXA tabe backup; 2external hard drives; additional computer; network server; BluRay 50gb RW disks. </s>
<s> One of the external hard drives is kept offsite. </s>
<s> This may seem to be a lot, but, if you've ever lost 85GB of ripped MP3/FLAC CDs, and had to rip them again, it adds a great measure of comfort. </s>
<s> I use a synchronization program to keep the music files current on all devices. </s>
<s> I backup the music when there is a change. </s>
<s> Ordinary data files are backed up weekly; less often when I'm not home. </s>
<s> (Sorry, this is a duplicate post to the first poll message, didn't know about the 'how' poll til later). </s>
<s> I use/make at least two CDs (using a different manufacturer's CD for each, to lessen any potential writing problems). </s>
<s> Then I read each (in another CD reader), and get copy of its contents (using CMD (or, COMMAND ) DIR /s /s &gt; filenameDateETC.xxx). </s>
<s> The contents file provides a neat way to search for a specific file, when I need to find it). </s>
<s> We also use Carbonite to keep data backed up. </s>
<s> I especially like that it just works in the background. </s>
<s> Similar to having a network file server backed up each night. </s>
<s> I've also been known to backup stuff to DVDs to keep copies of our important files, pictures, etc. </s>
<s> I've never thought of external HD as being a &quot;Backup&quot; method for me. </s>
<s> I use an external hard drive and also use Mozy, an online backup. </s>
<s> I do not need a huge amount of backing up, so Mozy has worked great for me. </s>
<s> I have always had at least two ways of backing up. </s>
<s> External: 250gb Fantom Drive via Firewire, Time Machine, automatically hourly. </s>
<s> Nothing better.. </s>
<s> Highly sensitive data, etc. </s>
<s> are also dragged to a 500gb SATA drive. </s>
<s> Need to create Time Machine for the PC </s>
<s> I do a full backup of my data to DVD, every week. </s>
<s> My backup program, is Genie Backup Manager Pro v7.0 (www.genie-soft.com). </s>
<s> I love GBMP, because it it also copies a Restore Executable along with the data, onto the DVD. </s>
<s> This lets me restore data directly from the archive DVD... mick2222 </s>
<s> I save a drive image to external hard drives once a week with daily incrementals. </s>
<s> I also save all of my data to dual layer DVD once a month with weekly incrmentals. </s>
<s> The DVDs contain ZIP files so no special software is required to recover the data. </s>
<s> I have restored my system from a drive image one time, and it took a couple of hours. </s>
<s> I have also recovered old data from the DVDs. </s>
<s> The DVDs are the best, because I can go back to any time in the last four years. </s>
<s> I have tapes from before that, but I no longer have the software or the drive so they are worthless. </s>
<s> I have a 2nd hard drive in my computer that I use to back up with the program Acronis, once a month. </s>
<s> I also have an external hard drive (250 g) to back up certain data and photos , plus certain things I back up onto smaller usb drives. </s>
<s> I do all this because I have a very slow internet connection due to living in the country, and had problems with my computer with me ending up reformating the computer about every 3 months and then the awful updating of windows, etc online. </s>
<s> The problem ended up being a power supply that just wasn't powerful enough for the computer. </s>
<s> Most of those problems ended once I got a better power supply. </s>
<s> Now it's just when I do something stupid. </s>
<s> I wish this had come up for you when it did for me, 2 weeks ago. </s>
<s> I am a DJ with tons of music and HAD it all backed up on a WD external.. </s>
<s> I have used this process for years, but just a couple weeks ago, (1 year and 1 month after it's purchase, it stopped. </s>
<s> I hook up, it &quot;clicks&quot; 3 times, and that's it. </s>
<s> No &quot;running&quot; or &quot;spinning&quot; sounds at all, and obviously my Hp/ompaq presario, with Vista, doesn't recognize THAT activity. </s>
<s> Ironically, this external has NEVER, had a jolt, (drop, slap, punch, bump, spill, etc).... but the Iomega I had for about six years, had been Dropped hard, from at least waist high, on concrete, at least 4-5 times....and I never had a problem with it. </s>
<s> as a matter of fact I just recently gave it away because it was still going after all this time, but it was too small. </s>
<s> Now, I believe I have decided to put all the music on DVD's. </s>
<s> Not as convenient, but it is when you consider the loss of ALL your data. </s>
<s> If you can't tell, I am not sure I have made the right choice yet, so please chime in, and let me know, What is the best method. </s>
<s> By the way, so that i am not bashing WD.... they did offer a $15.00 coupon... LOL I WAS 30 DAYS PASSED THE WARRANTY!!!!!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> when you say &quot;...HAD it all backed up on a WD external..&quot; do you mean you had it all **stored** on a WD external with no copy remaining on your PC's main drive? </s>
<s> I raise the point because I am finding more people confusing &quot;storing&quot; versus &quot;backup&quot;. </s>
<s> If the WD held just the backup copy, so what if it crashed? </s>
<s> You are justified to be po'd at WD and you have to buy a replacement, but you haven't lost any files. </s>
<s> I use several methods to back up my files, which includes data, tons of pictures and a limited amount of music. </s>
<s> I originally was backing up to a Desktop that I set up to function as file server so that my data was in two places. </s>
<s> Then I purchased a WD 250 gig portable hard drive a while back and was primarily backing up to it but then realized that the back up was only as safe as the place that it was kept. </s>
<s> The portable harddrive is connected to the file serve and is in the same office where I land after coming in from working in the field. </s>
<s> The threat of fire or theft made me realize that if either happened I was up you know what creek and it didn't matter about the paddle. </s>
<s> So I've signed up for Carbonite and now back up everything to the hard drive on the file server which that folder is backed up consistentaly to CArbonite. </s>
<s> I then do a monthly or biweekly back up to the portable hard drive. </s>
<s> Recently I've seen a device which is similar to the partable hard drive that comes in 1, 1 1/2, and 2 terabite sizes that acts both as a back up but can also be accessed directly from the internet with proper protections in place from anywhere you have internet access. </s>
<s> The networkable device may be my next purchase. </s>
<s> The increased size and the ability to go online from anywhere and get what I need if I forget it at the office sounds like a great deal fro less than $300.00. </s>
<s> Would love to know if anybody has any experience with a device like this. </s>
<s> Thanks Walter in Louisiana </s>
<s> I use Windows Home Server. </s>
<s> It clones all my computers, 3 Laptops, as well as duplicates the backup. </s>
<s> It does this Daily. </s>
<s> I had a hard drive go out on one of the Computers and it took me around 45 minutes to restore it completely. </s>
<s> It was like there never was a problem. </s>
<s> It also allows add ins for additional services as well as a built in remote access for family and friend to access pictures and other files if given permission. </s>
<s> I back my PC's up with the a HP MediaSmart EX470 Server build around the new Microsoft Home Server architecture. </s>
<s> The HP MediaSmart Server (EX470/EX475) takes the worry out of data protection by automatically backing up all of your important media and other files. </s>
<s> Designate folders are copied automatically onto multiple hard drives for an additional layer of redundant protection. </s>
<s> It utilizes file/disk mirroring rather then RAID. </s>
<s> Restore individual files or an entire PC hard drive in the event of a hardware or software failure. </s>
<s> Four internal hard-drive bays, four USB 2.0 ports and one eSATA port for storage expandability (over 9 TB). </s>
<s> Easily expand capacity with off-the-shelf SATA drives installation doesnt require tools or cables. </s>
<s> The HP MediaSmart Server EX470 provides a central location to keep all your files for easy access and provides the capability: 1) Centralize and share your files and media across your home network. </s>
<s> 2) Remotely access files on your server and run applications on your home PCs from any internet-connected computer. </s>
<s> 3) Stream photos, music and videos to PCs on your network or to your TV or stereo system. </s>
<s> 4) Automatically copy iTunes music libraries from family members' PCs to the server for streaming. </s>
<s> TIP: Purchase the EX470 and add your own additional 500GB SATA2 drive(s). </s>
<s> It remains the more cost effective purchase. </s>
<s> As I mentioned in my Reply to the Storage Forum topic &quot;Poll: Be Honest:...&quot; I do several levels of backup, including: 1. </s>
<s> &quot;Archived&quot; photos and music - on site and out of home sets of DVDs 2. </s>
<s> Yearly back ups onto DVDs of essentially all user files, including new photos and music, mostly at home but a current one at a friend's house. </s>

<s> What brand is your external hard drive, and why not two for different types of backups--music, photos, and important files. </s>
<s> My wife had her Money file on my laptop that fried, and while I did a backup of all files and folders, they became corrupt and I lost everything--photos, important files, and music--many that cannot be replaced. </s>
<s> Q1. </s>
<s> What software do you use to back up your music to a DVD, and what kind of a DVD burner do you use? </s>
<s> Q2. </s>
<s> What is pbase.com? </s>
<s> Many thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> Thomboy </s>
<s> What synchronization program do you use? </s>
<s> I wish I could sit and watch you do a few of these backups!! </s>
<s> Thomboy </s>
<s> In probably 10% of the posts in forums about backing up files and folders, I see Seagate Free agent Pro mentioned. </s>
<s> Is it a hard drive, or an external website to store data. </s>
<s> Does it come with software to enable both backups and restores? </s>
<s> Thanks, Thomboy </s>
<s> Hi Thombo65, Seagate Freeagent Go is a small, portable, USB hard drive. </s>
<s> I have the 320 GB size and it measures a very compact 4.75&quot; x 3.75&quot; x 0.50&quot; (approximately). </s>
<s> The two things I like about it, as opposed to the similar (and similarly recommended) Western Digital drive are: - it has a 5 year warranty - it has useful software, especially the tool to let me define which directories need files in them backed up as soon as they change, without waiting for a time interval, specific backup time, or manual request to do a backup. </s>
<s> Thanks, Geekguy: I just got back from Mexico where a friend is also looking for an external hard drive for backups. </s>
<s> Unlike me, his hard drive has not needed to be formatted, but he has thousands of .jpg photos to backup that cannot be replaced. </s>
<s> We will both look at the Seagate Freeagent Go as a preferred option. </s>
<s> Thanks again. </s>
<s> Thomboy </s>
<s> I back up to Maxtor 250 gb external hard drive (my desktop is 250 gb also) using ViceVersa Pro software (purchased online separately). </s>
<s> Critical file backup is done in real time automatically and encrypted. </s>
<s> Non critical file backup is performed once a day automatically. </s>
<s> Also have a smaller SimpleTech portable drive that I remove from bank safe deposit box, update, and return to bank prior to travel. </s>
<s> If we are home and a hurricane hits, just take the laptop and backup drive connected to desktop and go. </s>
<s> If we are away and catastrophe takes place, we have the drive in bank vault. </s>
<s> Have already scanned all important legal docs, medical records, etc. </s>
<s> Still in the process of scanning balance of historical family photos and articles, etc. </s>
<s> so that we don't lose any documentation and have all the scanned receipts of household purchases for insurance and replacement issues. </s>
<s> Hope this info helps someone else. </s>
<s> Thanks for the forum. </s>
