MS's article on the subject of file sharing in XP.... http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;304040 Basically you would turn off Simple File Sharing on the View tab of Windows Explorer's Tools menu.
Then you can set the permissions for each individual folder's sharing properties by right clicking and choosing Sharing and Security.
