1.1.1	At my workplace , we use the Netgear 814MR router , so I already have the appropriate wireless card for my laptop .	St
1.1.2	I just moved into a new apartment , and I bought my own 814MR router , as my plan is to set up a wireless network there using the same security configurations ( server name , encryption key , etc ) as are in place at my office so that my connection settings will never have to be changed .	St
1.1.3	With the router in my possession , and a working DSL connection in my apartment , what order of steps should I follow to get my home network up and running ?	Ques
1.1.4	Specifically , if step A is installing router software on my computer , step B is downloading upgrades/patches from the Netgear website , step C is physically connecting my router to my internet connection , and step D might be a step that I am not aware of , in what order should steps A-D ( or others ) go ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thanks for your help .	Polite
1.2.1	I might take a swing at Netswitcher ( http : //www.netswitcher.com/product_info.htm ) .	St
1.2.2	It 's supposed to allow mulitple networking profiles for those who roam .	St
1.3.1	Thank you for pointing me towards Netswitcher , and I will definitely check it out .	St
1.3.2	However , I am definitely a novice when it comes to networking , and I could really use assistance in establishing the very basic procedural steps for installing a router at home , given that I already have the notebook adapter card and that I know all the security/network name/password options I want to put in place .	St
1.3.3	Holding all that aside , if you were advising someone on how to install a router from the moment it is purchased at the store , specifically what is the appropriate order of the various steps that are necessary ?	Ques
1.3.4	I have been told that I need to download upgrades/patches from the Netgear website , to install software on my computer , and to physically connect the router , but I am not sure of what order to complete these steps .	St
1.3.5	Any help in that regard would be greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.3.6	Thanks !	St
1.4.1	The procedure I follow in setting up a home network is : 1 ) Attach the modem to the routers WAN/Internet port .	St
1.4.2	Hopefully your modem has an ethernet port .	St
1.4.3	2 ) Attach a CAT5 cable from the router to the network card of your PC .	St
1.4.4	Even in a wireless setup it can be easier if you use the hard wired port to initially setup the router parameters .	St
1.4.5	3 ) Power up the modem/router/PC in this order allowing ten seconds or so between devices .	St
1.4.6	4 ) Type the routers IP address into your browsers address bar to open the routers setup window .	St
1.4.7	5 ) From here it is just a matter of entering the connection type ( PPPoE , Auto DHCP , Static IP ) , user name and password .	St
1.4.8	Enable your wireless functions .	St
1.4.9	Set your security as needed ( WEP/WPA/Mac filtering ) .	St
1.4.10	6 ) Shut down the PC , disconnect the CAT5 cable from it and restart the PC .	St
1.4.11	Hopefully your wireless card will pick up the routers signal .	St
1.4.12	& quot ; I have been told that I need to download upgrades/patches from the Netgear website , to install software on my computer , and to physically connect the router & quot ; Firmware for your router can be upgraded at this point following the makers instructions .	St
1.4.13	I have never needed any router software on the PC to make this work .	St
1.4.14	Physically connecting the router was done in step 2 .	St
