1.1.1	G'day guys I am having some serious dramas with a Hard drive which will just not be recognised by another computer.	St
1.1.2	The Hard drive was a master in the first computer which the motherboard has just died in.	St
1.1.3	The Copacitators have started to leak in the motherboard.	St
1.1.4	I tried to change the hard drive to another computer and make it a master in that one as well.	St
1.1.5	When the computer searches for IDE drives in the boot up, it just stops there and doesn't go any further.	St
1.1.6	I thought it must have been something to do with the jumpers on it, once i pulled it out there are a whole lot of different settings compared to a normal hard drive, it has both 16 and 15 head options as master, slave and cable select.	St
1.1.7	It is a Deskstar hard drive.	St
1.1.8	If anyone could help me with this it would be apreciated.	Ques
1.1.9	I am worried that if i do buy a new motherboard i will have the same problems and i will then have to buy a new hard drive as well.	St
1.1.10	The model of the hard drive is an IBM Deskstar ic35l040avvn07-0 if that is any help.	St
1.1.11	I have it set as a master on 16 heads.	St
1.1.12	Cheers.	St

1.2.1	Another thing is that when i have the hard drive plugged in i cant even make it into bios.	St
1.2.2	I am stumpped.	St
1.2.3	Justin	St
1.3.1	You give us no idea how old the system is that you put the hard drive in.	St
1.3.2	Many older systems can't recognize large drives, and a 40GB may be unusable in a PII system without a BIOS upgrade (or even with one).	St
1.3.3	If the system is real new then you may need to jumper the drive as CS (cable select) not master or alone (if alone on the cable that is a separate setting and you don't use master).	St
1.3.4	Do NOT change the jumper for the number of heads, if you do that you will lose all data that was on there before.	St
1.4.1	cheers for the advice, i placed the hard drive into a newer computer and it worked just perfectly.	St
1.4.2	Cheers once again.	Polite
1.4.3	Justin.	St
