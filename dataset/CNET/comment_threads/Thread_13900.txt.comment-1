Here is the deal.
I have a 750gb hard drive running windows XP Pro that seems to have cratered.
I attempted a restart after removing a program and it gave me a BSOD.
When I attempted to restart in safe mode, it locked up on the mup.sys.
I had this happen once before and was able to resolve it by booting from the recovery discs.
However, this time, when I went to boot from the recovery discs, it would not even do that.
I removed the disc and was going to retrieve the important files I had created since my last backup by placing it in a hdd enclosure and attaching to another computer, but when I do, the primary partition asks to be formatted before use and shows 0 bytes used.
Does anybody have a good idea of how to proceed?
Thanks Brian
