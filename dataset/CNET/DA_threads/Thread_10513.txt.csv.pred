1.1.1	I have a Acer Aspire One , a small laptop/netbook , with 120GB HD , 1 GB ram , 1.6 Ghz Atom processor .	St
1.1.2	Its right out of the box , with Windows XP preinstalled .	St
1.1.3	The problem is as follows : the netbook sees a bunch of Wireless networks , including my own , which is at & quot ; very good & quot ; .	St
1.1.4	However , it is unable to establish a connection with it , no matter what .	St
1.1.5	Ca n't establish a connection with other nearby unprotected networks either .	St
1.1.6	I and my family have another two laptops and two desktops at home , one laptop and both desktops are able to fully connect to the network via wireless ( and access internet ) , but another laptop ( Acer Aspire 5672 ) is not .	St
1.1.7	My router model is WBR 2310 , from D-Link .	St
1.1.8	It comes with a CD for installation purposes .	St
1.1.9	So my questions are : 1 ) How do I successfully connect my netbook with my wireless network ?	Ques
1.1.10	2 ) Do I need the WBR2310 CD to be able to connect my netbook with my wireless network ?	Ques
1.1.11	3 ) Are there any other means to install the router without the CD , regardless if the answer for question 2 above ?	Ques
1.1.12	I appreciate your help .	Polite
1.2.1	Have you read the router 's manual .	St
1.2.2	It should describe how to add a wireless equipped computer to the network .	St
1.2.3	My guess is your router either has wireless security turned on and/or an access only by MAC ID list set up .	St
1.2.4	Link a computer into the router via ethernet cable and address the router 's user interface using your browser ( see manual for how ) .	St
1.2.5	Turn off wireless security and the acccess list .	St
1.2.6	See if new computer can then connect .	St
1.2.7	Add wireless security passphrase to new computer 's wireless interface and turn router 's wireless security back on .	St
1.3.1	NIL	St
