I'm using a Compaq Computer, w/Win98 OS.
I used the Add New Hardware Wizard to install my printer (Lexmark x1150) but each time I got an error msg.
stating, &quot;Printer can't be installed successfully unless it is connected correctly&quot;.
There are two USB ports located on the front of this computer, so I went and bought a brand new MS Hi-Speed A/B USB Cable (6 ft), and I'm still getting the same error msg.
Why?
Also, in my 'System Properties', 'Device' as well as 'Printer' are both missing.
Can anyone help me get these problems solved?
Thanks for WHATEVER advice you can give me.
;)
