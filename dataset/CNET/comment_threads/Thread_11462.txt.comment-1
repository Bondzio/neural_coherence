Computer constantly running 60-65C/130-150F...I think that is too hot for my processor...computer makes my room hot also...it is not overclocked...and i play counterstrike alot...i know gaming builds up heat..i am now getting constant freezing when playin that game for 10 minutes now...it use to be ok (not freeze)...i play it a lot...any help?
do i need a better heatsink/fan for the CPU?
what is the best one besides water cooling...?
