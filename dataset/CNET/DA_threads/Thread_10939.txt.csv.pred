1.1.1	im making a small ftp server using serv-u.	St
1.1.2	i have an ip and a domain and i set up serv-u with it.	St
1.1.3	when i try to log in from a different computer, i get a 401 Authorization Required screen.	St
1.1.4	I checked the settings over and over.	St
1.1.5	now when i try to log in, the sign in window just keeps popping up.	St
1.1.6	any ideas?	St
1.2.1	I have a DSL connection which means when you restart your computer you receive a new IP address.	St
1.2.2	Go to www.whatismyip.com and check your ip address.	St
1.2.3	I had thought it was 192.168.1...same as the router, it's not.	St
1.2.4	Using that IP to log on solved my problem of getting that error message.	St
1.3.1	in addition to Ru8 M3 suggestion.	St
1.3.2	You may want to make sure the FTP port is open and pointing to the correct local address &quot;192.168...&quot; in your router.	St
