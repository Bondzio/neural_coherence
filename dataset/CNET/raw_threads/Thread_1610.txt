9879	0	61474	729303	NR	joeltom	1/31/05 1:33 PM	1.10717838E12	Need video capture	I was naive in thinking my new computer would come with a firewire port - it didn't. I also was unaware that even with a firewire port, I would need digital video, not analog. SO, my question is, without replacing what I consider to be a very good graphics card, are there any good dedicated video capture cards out there that can stream analog video from a VCR or Analog video camera to my computer? I need the best quality I can get on a budget (less than $100 preferred), because I already spent a load on the system I bought! I look at ratings on Amazon and epinions, but most budget cards don't seem to rate that high. I would like to preserve my home videos in the best quality I can afford. Any suggestions? TIA!

They offer more advanced models, but this one gives a lot of bang for just a few bucks. It's available all over the U.S. at Office Max, Circuit City, Fry's, and many other stores, from $50.00 to $60.00. http://www.hauppauge.com/pages/products/data_go.html

This is why I suggested the other device. I can't tell if that card has RCA in ports, which is what my camera had coming out of it. I don't have any other cable ports from my camera so I had to use the RCA to USB that VIDEOH offers. After saying all of this, I may be incorrect about Ernies idea. It may be just what you need.
