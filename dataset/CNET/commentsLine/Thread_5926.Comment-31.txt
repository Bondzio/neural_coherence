better understanding of the jumpering of the hitachi drive.
explain the nine pins please.
western digital drives were confusing because they used different jumpering if a drive was the master with no drive on the slave, versus master with a drive on the slave.
be certain of the jumpering.
i believe that robert thinks that you bought this as a system, thus return it under warranty.
if you bought the stuff separately then you probably need to figure out what is wrong.
to me, the drive jumpering is a possibility or the drive is defective.
you should be able to test with the floppy system.
no need to install the drive.
just use the cables power & ribbon from the master to the hitachi, laying on a piece of cardboard, or standing on edge.
if the test is executing from the floppy it doesn't need the systems normal hard drive, just the cpu and memory.
