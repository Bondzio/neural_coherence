What does such a shortcut link to (have a look in its properties)?
What happens if you doubleclick it?
I'm rather sure that Windows won't run if ALL program files were converted to .lnk files.
Explorer.exe for example is a rather essential program to run and it seems you still have your desktop, so Explorer.exe must be running.
So maybe it's just a subset that you changed by accident?
So tell more.
