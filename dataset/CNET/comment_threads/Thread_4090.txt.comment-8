I had them build a mid-tier gaming system for me and it was well shipped, and worked perfectly and I am happy.
I found them after some research on the 'net and yes there isn't much out there review-wise but it was mostly positive and I took the plunge.
I'd recommend them.
Of course you will save money building your own system but I went the more expensive route.
It seemed also a better bet than Cyberpower, IBuyPower or Dell's Alienware.
