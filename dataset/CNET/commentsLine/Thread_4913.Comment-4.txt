i do a lot of animating in a program called blender (blender.org) so that's the main thing.
i also plan to do some gaming on it in my free time (half life 2, crisis, ect.)
i don't really need the games to run on &quot;full power&quot; lol.
i also don't plan on having the pc on 24/7.
i usually turn the pc to &quot;sleep mode&quot; when i'll be away from it for more than an hour or two.
i'll be using windows vista premium (64 bit).
okay, i'm going to change around my question a bit.
this is my case (  ) is there something you can put together for around 600.00. i can go over 600.00, but i'd rather not.
am i going to get a good system for (around) 600.00 (give or take 100.00).
also, i prefer nvidia with the graphics card... and no, i'm not totally stuck on amd, i'm okay with intel.
oh yeah, i'm 99.9% sure this is my monitor (  ).
