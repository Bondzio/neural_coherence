internet connection sharing (as mentioned in earlier post).
pci is the standard slot for adding boards to a pc motherboard.
if your are not happy opening the computer use usb.
you install the wireless adapter to the machine which presently lacks internet access (i guess the old one).
the router's connection depends on the type of internet feed you have.
if you have cable you will probably add a simple wireless router to the cable modem.
i assume the router is coming from the isp in which case it should carry instructions for linking to modem.
if you have adsl (phone line feed) you probably replace the modem with the router (which is more accurately called a wireless router/modem).
to do this successfully you may need help from isp on wan settings.
rather than abandon the idea of connecting the old computer to the internet you might try installing a newer operating system.
not vista (obviously) but i currently run xp on a laptop with a pentium2 600mhz processor.
