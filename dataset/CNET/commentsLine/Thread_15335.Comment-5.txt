i'm no techie.
i admit to being totally freaked by the notion of erasing the hard drive of my brand new machine and trying to reload the os and ms office software.
i guess i could hire someone to do it.
but i've also been told that these trial software garbage comes on the &quot;restore&quot; disks that dell distributes with their units (as opposed to a brand new windows vista disk from microsoft)as well, and if this is true then you don't get rid of it.
with my current/old dell i continue to get ads from realnetworks asking me to buy their upgraded package, and i don't know how to get rid of it.
i guess i'm just annoyed by dell and gateway who don't offer a clean install with their high end units that cost over $6k, without a monitor.
at least alienware promises a clean install and their not tooooo much more than the equivalent dell.
but falcon, voodoo, and overdrive comparable units costs over $2k more than the same equiped dell.
thanks all for the advise.
