&quot;Dell computers I use in libraries and offices are Pentium 3's?
Does it really make that much difference?&quot; YES IT DOES, BIG TIME!
Now if you have somthing running in the backgroud that keep the cpu busy it will heat up and the fan will get loud, this is life!!
At this time it's 90deg in Chicago.
The building air is not working that good in my office and the room is 78deg I have SETI running in the backgroud and the fan on my Dell is loud.
If I were to stop the SETI the fan would slow down after a few minutes.
Bring up task manager to see if you have anything running the is using up processor cycles other than idle process.
If you do then this is what is causing your processor to run hot.
