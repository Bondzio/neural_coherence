The mouse still works, but the on-screen pointer doesn't move I have tried a different mouse but with no luck, and updated and re-installed the drivers twice over.

Too many toss an old power supply or some 300-350 Watt PSU in the box since &quot;it should be enough.&quot; The power supply is missing from your parts list. Bob

Goto the Logitech support website or if you got it, CD/floppy install disk, use it. Normally, you don't need drivers as native W2K will do fine. However, in some systems for whatever reason, Logitech mice are problematic. I find using a plain 2-button non-wheeled mouse or a real MS wheel mouse problems go away. You can tweek the mouse setting(hardware) if you like and see if it settles down, but i have no fix to speak of other than above. sorry... tada -----Willy

With the upgrade I replaced the motherboard, CPU, memory, case and PSU and everything worked fine. It's only recently the problem started happening, so was reluctant to think the heat could be the problem and thought it was down to the Remote Registry service running on startup which I was told about by an I.T. Technician where I work, or some sort of Software corruption to the Mouse drivers or registry. Anyway, taking the cover off seems to solve the problem, so would investing in another fan solve the prob?
