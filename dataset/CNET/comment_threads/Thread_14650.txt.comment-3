I got it to work.
Device manager won't let you actually do anything to it, thanks though.
A PC doesn't know what to do with a Mac drive, so after searching around, I just had to use my Mac to format it to FAT32.
It's impossible to do anything to it (without third party software) on a PC without doing so, not even in disk manager.
