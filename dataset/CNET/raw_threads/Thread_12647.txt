The color quality is sub-par at best, the inkjet cartridges are tiny (300 prints max per cartridge) and most printouts have a faded appearance, no matter how hard you &quot;tweak&quot; the printer settings. That's why they literally THROW these printers at your when you buy PC's from any BigBox store. So, anyone else got advice???

Both are 7 cartridge printers that are made for photo printing and scanning. I would go into details but cnet did a good job of reviewing them.
