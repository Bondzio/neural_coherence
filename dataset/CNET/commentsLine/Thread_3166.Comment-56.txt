back up the back-up.
sounds redundant, but that is what backups are.
a minimum of 3 backups in different places.
computer, an external drive, and either another drive, disks, online service, etc.
kept not connected to your system.
i recently had both my 2 year old hp laptop and 4 year old maxtor drive expire 3 days apart.
my dvd backups saved the day on are now on my &quot;other then hp&quot; laptop.
