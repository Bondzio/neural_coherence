I have installed a Siemens Gigaset SE572 WLAN dsl wireless router.
Unfortunately it has only one port, for connection to PC.
I want to network my Dell 3100cn laser printer which is not wireless.
I have tried connecting a NEWLINK 5 port hub using the uplink to the wireless router but the router cannot recognise connection.
The port next to the uplink is empty and I have used NON-crossover cabling.
Can anyone advise me on how to network my printer.
