I'm a software guy, I have a number of clients with swim schools.
The pool water's 32-34 C ( &gt;90F), so the environment's both HOT and HUMID.
Plus there's the hint of chlorine and/or salt in the air.
Regular PCs don't last long in this environment.
Many have leased premises, so Air Conditioning not an option (besides hot/cold health issues).
Ambient air in summer in mid to high 30s for many (Australia).
Can you advise us on hardware & peripherals that might be effective as well as affordable?
