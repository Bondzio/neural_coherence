thanks, but yes, i check the status every time i upgrade either os or qt version.
i'd bet the problem lies with prefs (plists) but unless i know which one to delete i'm hesitant.
in fact: qt pro will still export to different file formats from .mov - just converted one audio.mov file to .aif with no trouble.
but it won't do the two common operations i've described (and need).
i have worked around the immediate problem: bought imovie 11 from the mac app store and will be trying its new audio editing features (which apple dropped after imovie hd).
