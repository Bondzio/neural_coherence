I purchased a 320gb WD sata drive to replace my 60gb in my dell inspirion laptop e1405 running windows xp media center edition version 2002 svc pack 3. i used acronis true image 2009 to attempt to clone it. i did not select the clone option i selected backup and restore and created an image. the image worked but now the drive shows as only 54 gb(same size as what the original drive says). and i cant boot from the drive. i originally formatted the drive at approx 298gb! what happened? acronis support is not helping me. WD said they cant help to contact acronis. how can i get my drive back???
