<s> Hi, I use Comcast for cable broadband. </s>
<s> I lost internet access for a period of time on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. </s>
<s> After each outage, service would continue as usual. </s>
<s> The customer service rep at Comcast tested the modem remotely and said the problem was the modem, not the signal. </s>
<s> The unit is a Motorola SURFboard. </s>
<s> Any thoughts on this would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> How old is it? </s>
<s> If past 2 or so years, I agree. </s>
<s> Today's electronics in many cases are designed for cost targets and sacrifice longevity. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Where is it? </s>
<s> Why I ask is that one member had theirs in an enclosed space. </s>
<s> Another had it buried under a pile of debris. </s>
<s> Treat it nicely and keep it cool without burying it under other devices. </s>

<s> Hi Bob, The modem is around two years old. </s>
<s> It's sitting in the open on an uncluttered computer desk, but the room does get hot at times. </s>
<s> What I was curious about is why the modem works perfectly at times then cuts out occasionally. </s>
<s> Thanks for your input. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Reseat all the connections. </s>
<s> Especially the coax ones at all ends. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Warm you say? </s>
<s> Point a fan at the device. </s>

<s> CABLE broadband is a SHARED resource. </s>
<s> Like drinking from a shared garden hose. </s>
<s> More people drinking, less water for each. </s>
<s> So, from what your times of signal loss are, my brain instantly tells me that is WHEN the KIDS are HOME and playing ONLINE GAMES. </s>
<s> (which is a big drain on the system) Unlike browsing or email, gaming needs lots of input to update many things at once. </s>
<s> Add lots of kids, and poof - signal is weak. </s>
<s> So, either do your IMPORTANT COMPUTING when the kidz are in school, or try DSL or DIAL-UP. </s>
<s> Or, throw a big neighborhood party, with lots of free food, and when they come to eat, run inside your house and quickly do your Internetting. </s>
<s> &lt;grin&gt; Check out http://www.broadbandreports.com/ for more info as it is a great site. </s>
<s> You can even check out your actual signal speed. </s>
<s> DO it at different times to get more data to help you figure this out. </s>
<s> Hope this help'd you. </s>
<s> Thanx, DRIX </s>
<s> Hi, thanks for your advice. </s>
<s> According to customer service, my modem and one other in the neighborhood were the only ones offline at the time I called. </s>
<s> My service was briefly interrupted one time since I first wrote but has been fine since. </s>
<s> I'm going to check out the site you suggested. </s>
