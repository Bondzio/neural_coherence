Hi -searched the forum and found your old question regarding Quicken 2007!
How did you make out with that?
I have XP so needless to say, I have learned the hard way, that simply backing up on a CD like we did in the 'old' days, by selecting A Drive and backing up on a floppy just isn't possible!
According to Microsoft, in order for Quicken to write a back up file directly to the CD-R or CD-RW, the compact disc must first be formatted and support 'packet writing'.
The Windows XP CD recording program does not support packet writing and does not contain a feature to format a recordable CD.
So, I have an external hard drive backing it up but I still long for a way to format the re-writable CD's.
I know some people are using a staging area saving method which, again, is just too complicated.
Any suggestions?
Thanks, Archer.....
