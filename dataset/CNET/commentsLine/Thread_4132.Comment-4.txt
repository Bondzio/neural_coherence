as it seems he just wants a suggestion but i'm not going to suggest a barebone kit from tigerdirect i'm just going to suggest parts from newegg i'm going to design two systems side by side one will possibly cost more than the other... one is going to be an athlon64 based system, one is going to be a pentium 4 sequence 6 system as they will share some simmilar hardware, i'm going to suggest that in one large block last... ok the athlon64 motherboard: the abit an8  $140 amd athlon64 cpu: amd athlon64 3500+  $267 now for video: pcie graphics card abit ati radeon x700pro for pcie  after that the casing, psu, everything is up to you (above is just a guideline) as to a psu i'd personally suggest an antec neopower 480w as for the intel system i'd use this cpu:  and this motherboard:  the aa8 will need ddr2, while the an8 will need normal ddr i would suggest pc 3200 for the amd, and pc2 3200 or pc2 4200 for the intel 2x512 dual channel for both (2x512mb sticks, it would provide dual channel if installed correctly)
