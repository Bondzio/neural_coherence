A friend of mine asked me to try to remove a partition from his hard drive.
It's an older computer and was set up with two 2gig partitions on a 4 gig hard drive.
But I think I made the serious mistake of searching google for deleting a partition instead of combining one.
Anyways, I followed a page like this http://www.cybertechhelp.com/html/tutorials/tutorial.php/id/36 and removed the partition, and now I only have the C: drive and it seems like I've essentially lost the other 2 gigs.
Is there anything I can do to either get these 2 gigs back onto the c: drive or restore the 2 gig d: drive.
I've tried a few free partition programs such as Partition Resizer but these don't even seem to detect that there are 2 gigs on the hard disk doing nothing.
Any advice appreciated.
