i think this was the model of my first computer, a ti-99 4a.
they sold them cheap about 1980. the only storage system was a tape recorder with a counter so you could retreive your program.
the computer sounded like a modem when it stored the programs.
we used an old tv for a monitor.
i remember it a programming similiar to apple-soft.
it came with a program to make a man on a screen.
i modified the program so he would move.
it would be 4 years later when i used apple 11e that i learned how to use a disk drive.
i programmed my own word processor in applesoft basic.
the next year i had a friend who bought an ibm 286. it had a 20mb hard drive.
at the time, people thought no one would need a bigger hard drive.
