1.1.1	We have many CT/MRI etc .	St
1.1.2	machines and Servers in the Hospital LAN .	St
1.1.3	Now intermittently we are loosing the LAN connectivity i.e we are not able to ping any system from any node inside the hospital network for sometimes , after some time it will start working and then again it will stops again.We are using procurve switches and also we are not using any router .	St
1.1.4	Can anybody suggest me what is the problem ?	Ques
1.2.1	There is no way to guess this from the information provided .	St
1.2.2	This requires someone who knows how to log into the switches and look and see how traffic flows when it works and how it flows when it does not .	St
1.2.3	This could be anything from spanning tree to mac table timeout settings .	St
1.2.4	If you do not KNOW what the 2 previously mentioned things are you need to get help from someone who does .	St
1.2.5	It could be many other things .	St
1.2.6	When you run business network you need to learn at least the basics or hire someone who does .	St
1.3.1	When you find a business that is having this issue you begin the usual work of replacing the first dumb switch with a better one .	St
1.3.2	Now you can see if your ping made it to the now smarter switch .	St
1.3.3	It was not funny when some IT staffer was out of date and out of touch on this .	St
1.3.4	The company finally had to let them go .	St
