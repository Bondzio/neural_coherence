I am trying to network my desktop pc (windows xp) to an older laptop (windows 2000). I just cannot work out how to do it, if you indeed can. The desktop is connected to the internet through an adsl router. Please help. Thanks, Mark.

If we install the router and then use NETWORK MAGIC then the usual owners can get it working. What I'm running into more and more are owners that just want it to work without having to learn about firewalls, shares and accounts. Bob
