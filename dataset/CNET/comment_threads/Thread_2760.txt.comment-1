Hi guys, I have an eMachines T6212, with 512mb dual channel ddr sdram from factory.
it has 4 slots total, and 512 is made up of two samsung 256mb pc3200 CL3 ddr memory.
i just bought an Ultra 512MB DDR 400MHz CL3 memory which should get me 1gb memory total, but my computer is only showing 768mb memory.
can anyone help?
