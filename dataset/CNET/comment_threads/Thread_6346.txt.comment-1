Hey folks just wanted to know if there are dedicated USB servers?
I'm not sure if that's what they are called but basically I am looking to hook up a couple of external hard drives to a wireless network.
I also plan on attaching a printer as well.
I have found dedicated printer servers, but haven't been able to find just a usb one.
I know of a couple wireless routers that have usb ports built in but that will be a last resort.
Thanks for your help.
