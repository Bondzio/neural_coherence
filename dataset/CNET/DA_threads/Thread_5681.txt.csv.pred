1.1.1	Hello , I 'm thinking about 'donating ' my old desktop to my friend for his kids to use .	St
1.1.2	The timing works out well because I think I 'm ready to spring for a new PC w/ dual core ( or build one ) .	St
1.1.3	If I were to purchase a PC from a vendor , would I be able to drop my old hard drive in and essentially have my old PC 's & quot ; brain & quot ; running on a faster machine ?	Ques
1.1.4	Old system is a Dell P4 2.0GHz , 1GB RAM running XP Home Edition .	St
1.1.5	The boot drive is the garden-variety 40GB , and I have installed another hd ( 160GB ) for storage .	St
1.1.6	New PC would have a dual-core Intel processor , but I am concerned that the BIOS would mess things up .	St
1.1.7	Or if it came with Vista pre-installed and if I were to remove the pre-installed hd completely , would it recognize my old hard drive , be able to boot XP , and still be compatible with the motherboard and the capacity for alot more RAM memory ?	Ques
1.1.8	I do n't think I would have a problem , but figured I 'd ask .	St
1.1.9	Thanks for all of your help !	St

1.2.1	It 's not that the new computer wo n't recognize the hard drive , but your old xp installation will have trouble with the new motherboard , video card , etc .	St
1.2.2	Plus , the old xp was probably an oem version , and is & quot ; married & quot ; to the old computer .	St
1.2.3	When it came time to activate the old windows on the new system , it would n't work .	St
1.2.4	Keep the new drive in the new system .	St
1.2.5	If you want to transfer one of the old drives to the new computer , that is fine .	St
1.2.6	If you give the old system to someone , let them re-install the old version of windows on the old computer .	St
1.3.1	The Windows OS does n't survive such moves .	St
1.3.2	But for clarity here 's a few articles about how I can save the OS and apps when a machine gets a lightning hit and the hard disk survives .	St
1.3.3	Read a few from http : //www.google.com/search ? hl=en & safe=off & q=CHANGE+MOTHERBOARD+SAVE+XP+OPERATING+SYSTEM Bob	St
1.4.1	Here 's the deal : 1 ) new system will accept old HD with new HD as boot drive , you can then swap data as required ( but can be iffy ) 2 ) the old HD ( old OS ) ca n't be used as main drive in new system w/o losing data and unless preparing it for proper use 3 ) the XP OS wo n't allow usage as in step 2 , and is illegal to use any OEM OS besides the intended system or Dell in this case 4 ) install old HD in USB enclosure and mount that way to access data 5 ) if you donate old system with HD , then erase completely using pgms .	St
1.4.2	like KILLDISK , DBAN , or HD Eraser ( google for them ) tada -- -- -Willy	St
