windows 7 has a nice backup..i tested it..it work.
nero does as a responder stated...it works.
i bet roxio does also.
check cnet downloads....plenty of programs.
or just use an cloning/imaging programs like macrium reflect (free) and clone your whole harddrive every few weeks....paid version of it and acronis allow you to clone just files/folders etc.
and most important alot of these external drives come with sw to backup does yours???
