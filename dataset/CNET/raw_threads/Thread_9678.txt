Hi, Im pretty sure theres been tons of messages like this one but I want something that fits the needs to overhaul my computer for Video/Memory/Sound so here it goes.. -- Computer Specs: Emachine T6410 XP sp#2 Amd Anthlon 64 processor 2.2ghz/ 512 mb ram (DIMM pc-3200) (383mb ram with onboard 128mb shared video memory ATI Radeon Express) -- More specs: http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1576697&Tab=2&NoMapp=0 -- *Im in the market for more memory; my comp's memory is expandable upto 2GB. What kind would be good for a budget price? *Also a new video card? On an update for my computer, it says its recomended that ATI based cards are used but i read before they lock up, errornous etc.. Whats a good performance video card within -250$ range *Also a new sound card, on the professional level. I was thinking Creative Labs Sound Blaster Audigy 4 Pro?? What do you think? http://www.soundblaster.com/products/product.asp?category=1&subcategory=434&product=10853
