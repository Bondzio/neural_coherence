I'm running a wireless network for 3 computers (2 XP and one Me) and all 3 computers are able to access the internet via the wireless router. However, I haven't been able to setup a working home network for sharing files, etc. I've made several attempts to use the MS XP software (Setup home or office network) to setup a network without success. I wondering if anyone can recommend a reasonable software package that would support XP and ME in setting up a home network. I DON'T want to upgrade the ME computer to XP because of hardware issues.

It's working and the disable in ZoneAlarm doesn't turn it off. Then you have IFC to contend with as well. http://www.practicallynetworked.com/qa/qa20040212.shtml notes some other points. Best of luck, and I can network just fine with Windows 98/ME/2000/XP and Linux, so it's not these OSes that are the issue. Bob
