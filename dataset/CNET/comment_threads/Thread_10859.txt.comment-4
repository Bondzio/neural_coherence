Router speed, be it wireless or wired, have no effect on connection speed.
Your DSL speed will not increase.
Router speeds, wired or wireless, affect your home LAN only, between computers.
Wireless G is advertised at 54 Mb/s, wireless N is advertised at ~100 Mb/s.
And wireless N is supposed to have a slightly longer range due to it's higher frequencies.
Don't hold your breath on speed or distance.
To get faster DSL speed you need to upgrade to higher speed DSL or move to cable.
