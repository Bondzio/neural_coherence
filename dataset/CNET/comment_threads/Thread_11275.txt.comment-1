Ok I have a VIVO Nvidia agp 8X Card I dont want to Toss.
And I want to Upgrade to the Good Stuff and I want to use my VIVO for tv as well and Recording TV wile I work.
But I want to Play the new games and the power of this card is outdated Hell it barely lets me play wow at near max.
I want to build a System with both PCIE and AGP slots and use my old card instead of tossing it.
So is this a Possibility.
Please Assist if U can
