If you can remember the password, then write it on a small slip of paper and tape it to your router.
If that doesn't work for you, you can press the reset button, setting it back to the factory settings and leave it there.
If neither of these 2 suggestions work then you shouldn't have the router in the first place.
Nor a computer.
