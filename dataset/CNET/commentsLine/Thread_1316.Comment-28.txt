i have 3 computer systems and all have tuners and media center installed, including the 17&quot; laptop.
my main system is in the den, where i use a 24&quot; lcd monitor as a tv after the days pc work is done.
in the back bedroom resides the old desktop and the old 21&quot; crt monitor.
when the grand kids visit it gets heavier use (tv, computer, games) than my main, which is off limits to the kids.
when i travel i take the laptop, which has off-air recorded hidef programming on the hard drive.
if there is a on-air program i want recorded when on the road it goes on the laptop hard drive.
hidef looks really good on it.
