Ahhh...you guys are feeding my confidence now.
The machine is only 3 yrs old...that's not TOO old, right?
XP runs great on it, and the new hard drive did say the pins will be set at that cable select setting.
So...if I leave the jumper there, the jumper on the 20G should also be set at &quot;cable select&quot;, right?
OH, and should I be worrying about my 20G crashing for any reason?
I have yet to get my CD-RW up and running again after it died on me...that's another story...ugh...so I don't really have a way to back up the original hard drive.
Is that too scary?
