Hi, Today I noticed that when I tried to start my computer the computer started but my screen was blank and my computer just beeped. Well, I removed my video card (GeForce 8600 GT) and just used the built in video card that came with my computer. And everything is fine again. What I want to know is what am i able to do to fix my video card if anything? It seemed like all this occurred soon after I downloaded an update for the video card. I tried numerous times to use the GeForce card but my computer just beeps and will not start. Also I use a dell computer if that's any help. I would appreciate any suggestions. Thanks

Reconnect that video card and then boot up into Safe Mode, instructions here . In Safe Mode the system only uses the onboard or default video settings. Then either; 1] Use System Restore to go back to a time/date before you updated that video card. Reboot into normal mode and see if that works. If not. 2] goto the Device Manager, (right click your My Computer icon, select Properties, then the hardware tab, then the Device Manager button). Expand the Display Adapter tree by clicking on the + sign, highlight the video card, then delete it. Reboot into normal mode and allow Windows to recognize new hardware and look for the drivers. It may be that the card is now unserviceable and needs replacing. Others here may have better guidance. Mark
