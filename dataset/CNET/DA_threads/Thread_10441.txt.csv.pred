1.1.1	I have a Canon MX310 aio printer that takes # 40 and # 41 ink cartridges.	St
1.1.2	The store did not have # 40 or # 50 in stock but had # 30 (black) and # 31 (color) .	St
1.1.3	Both boxers show they will work on the MX310.	St
1.1.4	The question is... Is # 40 & # 50 preferable or does it make a difference?	St
1.1.5	Thanks Ben	St
1.2.1	cartridge labeled for use with your model, you are safe.	St
