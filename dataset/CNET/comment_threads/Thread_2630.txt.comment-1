My computer froze up on me recently, so I switched off the power supply.
When I booted up again i had found that my 320GB hard drive now only has 127GB.. All my files are still around but most of my ripped movies now have a size of 0mb.
I am running Windows 7, the hard drive is a Seagate Barracuda 320GB 7200.11 What is going on?
