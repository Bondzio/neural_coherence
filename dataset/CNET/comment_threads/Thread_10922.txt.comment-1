Hello Everyone, I am in need of a new software to connect to the internet wirelessly.
I currently have a waveplus wp 1200 802.11b wireless pcmcia card on the laptop.
It came with the Quetec connection software(quetec.ca).
Unfortunately I believe either the software or hardware is bad, maybe both.
The thing connected for a brief few seconds got lost it completely afterwards, the program sometimes can detect wireless networks and says that it connects to them but no browsing or pinging is able.
Anybody know of a program that is preferrably free that I can use with my adapter to connect to wireless networks(windows ME)?
