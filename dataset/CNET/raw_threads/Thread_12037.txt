I currently have 4gb of DDR2 ram, and an ATI Radeon 4650 HD, and I wanted to know if i can upgrade it to 8gb DDR3 ram or stick with DDR2, and also, to what GPU can I get the motherboard to. I have a 2.33 GHZ Quad Core, and my power supply is a Micronics 230W. I play games such as the AC series, Tomb Raider amongst others, high motion games. 2 hours ago Also, I want to know if i will need to upgrade my power source

Because you might get some dual or triple rail PSU and that would be no upgrade. http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html is the usual list. And look at the rating needed and then again, unless you know your Amperes, you get a single rail of the rated value. Bob

If you found this old PC with say a 5400 RPM drive, for cheap I could fit a 7200 RPM drive and the improved boot and load times could have the owner happy for a bit. The 230W PSU is just too low to consider any card on the list. And without knowing which 500W you have so I can check rails, I can't be sure it will do. That's one reason why you hear folk asking for a single rail. Bob
