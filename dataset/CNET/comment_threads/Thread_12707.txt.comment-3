resetting his connection would be was my first step, but he is out the city till middle March and I just cannot wait that long.
couple notes - if another laptop worked - can I do something to my laptop to make it work again?
such as change that ip address manually?
- I'm just guessing, if you can really change ip address manually - please guide me on how to do it.
And the last thing - as I mentioned I've erased and reformatted all drives- and i got the same message in the middle of windows installation.
In the middle!
meaning I didn't even do any set up or search for any wireless connections.
Can that be a conflict within my computer, like my wireless card is conflicting with ethernet network card (just guessing again)?
