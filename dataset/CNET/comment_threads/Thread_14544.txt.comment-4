Thank you !
Strange how I would notice - over many years - the 8 larger black chips - but never notice that one, much smaller, tiny black chip.
So &quot;registered&quot; chips are the ones with the &quot;U&quot;.
These chips have a clock cycle delay.
The Unbuffered chips are the one without the &quot;U&quot; (sounds like reverse polish notation).
It also means I can not &quot;mix and match&quot;.
But in this case: I can remove the 256mb unbuffered chip, and replace it with two 256mb registered chips.
Thus putting 512mb safely on the computer - a step up.
Of course, this all assumes the chips &quot;fit&quot; (one versus two notches - and not on a Dell which moved the notches thus making their memory &quot;propriatary&quot;).
