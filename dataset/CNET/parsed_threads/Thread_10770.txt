<s> Xp Home Started with Logitech optical mouse in the serial port with adapter. </s>
<s> No red light and pointer did not move. </s>
<s> Steps I have taken taken to make it work. </s>
<s> Removed Logitech mouse and installed the original mouse with out the adapter, that did not work either. </s>
<s> Also checked for bent pins (OK) Reinstalled the Logitech on a open USB. </s>
<s> It worked. </s>
<s> The mouse worked fine yesterday but not today. </s>
<s> I would like to find why it did not work and how to fix. </s>
<s> Thanks Joe </s>
<s> Check Device Manager for any disabled devices, in particular COM ports. </s>
<s> Then I would scan for the pests using the tools listed here: http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6132-0.html?forumID=32&threadID=1313&start=0 </s>
<s> The reason is simple. </s>
<s> The serial port doesn't have the power to run such a mouse. </s>
<s> Yes, you can buy USB or PS2 to RS232 adapters or find such, but I think you've found such an adapter and was hoping it would work. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Checked all items mentioned All OK. </s>
<s> I guess I was lucky to have the optical mouse last a year in a standard mouse port. </s>
<s> I will leave it the way it is with the optical mouse in the USB. </s>
<s> As Bob says &quot;if it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot; Thanks again. </s>
