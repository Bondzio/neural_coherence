1.1.1	Just bought a new T6212 and I have a question concerning DVD playback .	St
1.1.2	What should my expectation be on the quality of playing a DVD movie on this computer ?	Ques
1.1.3	I have a 17 & quot ; CRT monitor and usually maximize the screen .	St
1.1.4	Should it be just as good as watching it on TV ?	Ques
1.1.5	( Probably not ) The picture does show some low resolution , not real bad , but somewhat noticeable .	St
1.1.6	Also when the scene has some fast action to it , there is some & quot ; blur & quot ; that occurs .	St
1.1.7	I have adjusted a number of settings with no real improvement .	St
1.1.8	What could be done to improve this so that the playback is DVD quality ?	Ques
1.1.9	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	I just bought the same machine from Circuit City .	St
1.2.2	( T6212 ) The first thing I noticed was that the 512 MB of RAM was registering as only 384 .	St
1.2.3	The reason was that the video card shares memory so right off the bat 128 MB went to the graphics .	St
1.2.4	I went to Newegg and picked up an Abit 256 MhZ graphics card ( make sure you get one with a PCI-Express connection ) and ( 1 ) the graphics improved and ( 2 ) now all 512 MB of memory is dedicated to the processor .	St
1.2.5	Hope this helps .	St
1.2.6	Good luck .	Polite
1.3.1	What is your experience playing a DVD using both PowerDVD and Windows Media Player .	St
1.3.2	Have you noticed the same thing or did adding the graphics card solve the problem ?	Ques
1.4.1	the ati x200 integrated graphics are adequate for dvd playback .	St
1.4.2	Even if u upgrade graphics card , it 'll probably show little or no difference .	St
1.4.3	Also the quality of the image is also from monitor so good monitor also produces good images .	St
1.4.4	unless ure in gaming , i would not suggest getting a gfx card .	St
1.4.5	if u still want to upgrade the gfx card , i would go for a nvidia 6200 or radeon x300 .	St
1.4.6	both are adequate for everyday applications and are pretty decent with new games on like super low settings .	St
1.4.7	However they are good for playing older games .	St
1.5.1	As nerdyboy said , you would n't see a difference upgrading your video card .	St
1.5.2	With a good monitor your picture should be just as sharp as what you see on a tv .	St
1.5.3	Your monitor should have atleast a 12ms pixel-response time for good movie viewing .	Sug
