1372	0	62200	737108	NR	jobitben	2/3/05 7:40 AM	1.1074164E12	Monitor problem	I have a ViewSonic G220f Model # VCDTS23852 - 1M. One year old. Now, there are &quot;dots&quot; appearing randomly on screen. They are in singles, bars of 4, 8, etc and some in colors. They appear on windows I'm working on and degrade the print, but when that window is printed, they don't show up on the print. We have tried several things: checking connections, turning off, on. Sometimes they go away after a restart, but then return. ???? Help

Does the problem follow the monitor?. When a different monitor is hooked up to this PC do you have the same problem?? John
