<s> i went to try and listen to a cd today and nothing happened and i looked under My Computer and my cd drives were missing. </s>
<s> i was searching around the device manager and got this message when i clicked on both of the cd drives. </s>
<s> &quot;Windows successfully loaded the device driver for this hardware but cannot find the hardware device. </s>
<s> (Code 41)&quot; i've tried using system restore to get it back to it's previous state but it keeps saying that it couldn't restore. </s>
<s> i was trying to load some copies of programs yesterday and tried to use some patches and cracks on them so i think that's what might've done it. </s>
<s> any idea on how i could fix this? </s>
<s> thanks, jon </s>
<s> Does the BIOS list your drives? </s>
<s> If not, then Windows won't either. </s>
<s> CODE 41 is also noted by http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;314060 Ignore what the KB says and delete the keys to retest. </s>

<s> I don't know if will be helpful or not but I had the same problem with ALL 3 of my optical drives. </s>
<s> The culprit was slysoft's anydvd. </s>
<s> I would suggest that you check to see if this particular piece of software is on your machine. </s>
<s> After going into the registry and deleting all references to slysoft and anydvd and rebooting all 3 optical drives reappeared. </s>
<s> Good luck </s>
