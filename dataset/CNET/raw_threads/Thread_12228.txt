One hard drive is XP and the other is Mandriva Linux. Currently, both jumpers are set to Master. My ribbon cable has a connectors for two hard drives. Is there any way to do this?

I actually don't have a floppy drive, but two CD ROM drives. I think I need to contact my motherboard mfgr and see if a boot manager is available for this. I would prefer to stay totally clear of touching the MBR on the one drive, for sure. Thoughts? Thanks.

Just be sure to back anything that you can't afford to lost that's so. Good luck with the installation, it should be smooth sailing. It should be easier than windows (you have my word).

One note FWIW, is that when I selected the boot order for the first second and third options, I found that depending on which drive I wanted to boot into, that I had to set all of the options to the same drive, i.e. first SCSI second SCSI third SCSI in order to ensure that it would take. I discovered this by accident when it kept failing when I just set it to first HD1 second HD2 third CDROM when I did the above, it would not boot into HD2 or CDROM.

Not only that, if both harddrive are on the same ide connector, I doubt it can be done. Just my take on this.
