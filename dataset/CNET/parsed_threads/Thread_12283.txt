<s> Hello everybody! </s>
<s> I have a DiskGO 2.5 ultra portable harddrive. </s>
<s> I cannot get it to work and I was wondering how can I get the data I have on it?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> The OS didn't see it.. or what? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> You have Windows, not Linux or Mac OS X. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> The drive letter doesn't pop up in My Computer if you connect the drive. </s>
<s> (but, of course, it could be something else). </s>
<s> In that case only: Yep, that happens. </s>
<s> That's why it's a good idea to have a backup of the data you put on it and don't want to lose if it happens. </s>
<s> Causes can be: 1. </s>
<s> Your Firewire or USB (whatever it uses) port on your PC is defective. </s>
<s> Try another device (like a USB-stick or USB-mouse). </s>
<s> Try other ports on the same PC. </s>
<s> Try another PC. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> Bad connection. </s>
<s> Try another cable. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> Electronics of external disk defective. </s>
<s> Get the disk out and connect it via a cable or in another external case. </s>
<s> 4. </s>
<s> File system on disk corrupted or erased or so. </s>
<s> Try a data recovery program like RECUVA or ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY or GETDATABACK. </s>
<s> 5. </s>
<s> Hard disk itself defective or step #4 finds less than you want. </s>
<s> Find your creditcard and call a professional data recovery company like drivesavers.com or krollontract.com The usual first thing to do is to run your OS'es disk management and see what that reports about the disk. </s>
<s> If it reports RAW, you can go to step #4 immediately. </s>
<s> Kees </s>
<s> Windows XP is what I am running. </s>
<s> Before I just plugged it to the USB port on my computer and I could get to my data. </s>
<s> I have tried a couple of computers, my lattop and the other desk top, and it does not work on any one! </s>
<s> Like the cable because I did try anothe USB port on another computer. </s>
<s> Thank's </s>
