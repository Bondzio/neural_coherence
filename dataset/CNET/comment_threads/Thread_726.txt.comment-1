When I attempted to install the second geforce 8800 gts card into my system, I was greeted with a high pitched squeeling noise the moment I turned on the power.
I tried it twice more, once after flipping the sli bridge around and then again with no sli bridge connection.
I ensured the card was properly seated.
All had the same high-pitched noise.
Any ideas?
