visiting the web link you provided, states that the ram is ddr2 type.
further, you mentioned you brought just 1 ram stick.
in order to use the ram in ddr2 mode, you need actually 2 ram sticks, thus another 1gb ram stick is required to quiet the beeping.
that will be a total of 4gb which undewr the os will accept and further only see 3.5gb of it for use but it will acknowledge the 4gb total.
google if you want more into.
imho, you need another 1gb ram stick or return the 1gb you brought for 2x512mb ram sticks in order to populate the ram slots if you like.
