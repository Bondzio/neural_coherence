you lead with prices for the playbook in your post and then ask which is odd.
but your questions are the same as others that want a pc/laptop and try to get a tablet then in a short while discover they need the pc to load or configure or do what they wanted in the first place.
if you don't have a pc you will learn why folk warned you later.
