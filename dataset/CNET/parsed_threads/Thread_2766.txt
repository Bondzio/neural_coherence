<s> ECS k7s5a V1.0 motherboard and Athlon Thunderbird CPU with Award Bios 2.0. </s>
<s> PC2100 memory 2 x 128. </s>
<s> I have a debugging question. </s>
<s> I moved my computer to a new location so I thought I would vacumn out the dust. </s>
<s> In so doing I removed my Heat sink and fan off the cpu. </s>
<s> I put everything back in place and powered it up. </s>
<s> As it was going through the post/pre-boot it shut itself down. </s>
<s> In opening it back up I discovered the heatsink was not properly seated (my fault). </s>
<s> I reset it and buttoned everything back up. </s>
<s> Now it will not go into the post/pre-boot and just blinks the CDROM, and the hard drive led on the case blinks. </s>
<s> So far I have replaced the Power supply with the same results. </s>
<s> I've also disconnected all boards but the video card and the floppy with the same result, it never gets to access to setup. </s>
<s> I would like to trouble shoot it a little more before giving up on the mobo (since its getting power) or the CPU. </s>
<s> I suspect I cracked the MOBO as there is no evidence of a short or tell tale smell. </s>
<s> Anything I can try short of replacing the motherboard and cpu and memory in that order? </s>
<s> You have likely fried the processor as any incorrect seating of the HSF on the chip will burn it quickly. </s>
<s> Did you replace apply new thermal paste after you cleaned the old paste off the chip and heatsink? </s>
<s> No I did not. </s>
<s> I have some and was going to try that, however it was only on for the length of time to get into the post. </s>
<s> I know these overclocked cpus are extremely sensitive, but it was only for a few seconds. </s>
<s> I wouldn't think it could get that hot that fast? </s>
<s> http://www20.tomshardware.com/cpu/20010917/index.html shows it all. </s>
<s> Good intentions, bad results. </s>
<s> A lesson learned. </s>
<s> Thanks for the article. </s>
<s> I'll put in a CPU and see if thats what's gone. </s>
<s> And I will double check my installation this time. </s>
<s> Thanks to you both. </s>
