Sometimes when I turn on my PC, and it boots to the Windows Login, then the screen is very blurry and you can hardly read anything. This did not start happening until I began using my Logitech MX518 Gaming-Grade Optical Mouse. Anyone know why this would be happening?

Also, if by the connection you mean ps2 or usb - i've tried both using the usb-to-ps2 connector as well as just the usb. If by connection you mean internet - its cable :-P Lol.

When using any other mouse - this never happens, however it is an excellent mouse that was $50 so I want to continue to use it.
