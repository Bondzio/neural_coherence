OK I need some help.
I purchased an amped wireless SR150 so I can connect my Blue Ray Player (hard wired only) to my network so I could watch netflix, vudu etc...issue is it lags way too much.
talked to amped wireless and they told me I need to upgrade to an extender with a larger range, my router is in the basement, TV/blue ray on the main floor..after doing some research I am thinking about the power line adapters.
Which way should I go?
I don't want to make another trip to the store....
