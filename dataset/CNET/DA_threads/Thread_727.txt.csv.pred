1.1.1	I need to know what i need to have to be able to install a second CPU.	St
1.2.1	-Your new CPU should be the same socket as the last one -Buy some Thermal Grease -Make sure you have a fitting heatsink and cooling is efficent -It should be compatible with your motherboard, a few Dual Cores, I hear, are not 100% compatible with old motherboards but can be, usually, fixed with a BIOS fix/update/patch.	St
1.2.2	-Be careful, don't break any pins on the CPU Here is an OK guide, just a basis.	St
1.2.3	I'm trying to find a better one: http://www.hardwarecentral.com/hardwarecentral/tutorials/109/10/ ~Ibrahim~	St

1.4.1	My current CPU is a Intel Pen.	St

1.5.1	Well, if your buying a motherboard to suit CPU, just make sure, if you have any, that other components are good as well: Memory, GPU, etc.	St

1.8.1	Well, then he is right.	St
1.8.2	Just wondering: Is this for a server or something?	St
1.8.3	Because I've only seen one setup with more than 1 physical CPU, and its a server running four Xeon's at 3.0GHz which is alot of processing power.	St
1.8.4	If you want power, and save a butload of money, just upgrade this one.	St
1.8.5	In todays Programs and Applications it is almost always overkill to add a whole new Processor, and the money is big, I mean new motherboard, new CPU, it adds up.	St
