I just purchased some computer parts and put a computer together.
Now I am trying to install windows on it but it keeps restarting whenever the files are being copied ( I have noticed it ususally restarts when trying to copy the file drivers.cab more often than not).
Here are some specs: *Intel Pentium D 830 3.0GHz Dual-Core Processor *Intel Socket 775 Cooling Fan *MSI P4M890M-L Via Socket 775 MicroATX Motherboard / Audio / Video / PCI Express / 10/100 Ethernel LAN / USB 2.0 / Serial ATA / RAID *Ultra 1024MB PC3200 DDR 400MHz Memory *XFX GeForce 7600 GS / 256MB GDDR2 / SLI / PCI Express / Dual DVI / HDTV / Video Card *Caviar Special Edition 80GB IDE Hard Drive Any help would be appreciated, thank you for reading.
