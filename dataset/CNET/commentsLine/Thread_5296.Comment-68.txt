integrated video is ok for most usage.
like they say, when you need to take in a cat video or send pictures and egreetings to you mom and grandma, shared 256m works.
when you get to the point where you want to use a touch screen, windows aero (which is one of microsoft's really cool features!)
photoshop, final cut hd pro (since you're making an indie movie for the sundance festival) while you're iming and twittering sandra bullock and russell crowe for the lead and making open table reservations at ivy's of beverly hills - you gots to change!
remember that windows 7 can handle more ram (4g to 32g) than vista or xp, so when you think the bsod is breathing down you neck, upgrade your ram and use some of the ram optimizers you find on cnet (free or otherwise) to help you out.
windows 7 (assuming you have a 64bit hp machine) is a very forgiving os.
microsoft and hp both know that most people are rookies and the os will help compensate (like allocation of resources to the many devices (e.g.
videocams, wireless all-in-ones, iphones & droids) you'll use).
so for awhile, it will dump everything into the ram and you will never know the difference.
so don't worry, be happy!
when you do have to upgrade your video, make sure you have the operating manual readily available.
there are many types of video cards available with all sorts of buses and interfaces, so make sure you know what you have on the motherboard and make sure you understand how to reset the startup to look for your new video card and not use the intergrated video.
