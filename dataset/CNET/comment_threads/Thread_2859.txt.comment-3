Well, the main thing is to get a great computer, but of course I would like it as inexpensive as possible I know, however, that I probably have to pay a bit, and I guess more like $1400 than $600.
I do not need anything else than the machine (no monitors or anything).
I am thinking of using Intel Core 2 Quad ..., a MB that fits it and a Graphic card compatible with Open GL and Active X-9 or more (if I decide to build it myself).
I know that different components not always go together, and if any of you have some experience with parts that go well together, it would be great to hear about it.
