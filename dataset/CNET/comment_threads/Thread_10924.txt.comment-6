I'm running into more machines where the person installing XP skips installing motherboard and SATA drivers.
On some machines this will work for a short while (I won't discuss why) but later the machine goes into this reboot loop as noted.
Reinstalling the OS works but later the same issue comes up.
Some call XP flawed on this point but I think it's a matter Microsoft should have addressed rather than pushed off to telling us to install the OS properly.
Yes they are busy on Vista but how many run XP and encounter driver issues?
Here's an example proper SATA install link.
