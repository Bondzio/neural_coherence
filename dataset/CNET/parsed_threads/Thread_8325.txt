<s> Ive been using computers for about 17 years and Ive always been far behind the times in keeping a system updated. </s>
<s> I recently purchased a new system from a random dealer and thought I would be happy with just average. </s>
<s> My problem is this, It gets old looking at the hourglass all the time more than I think I should have to. </s>
<s> I dont have many programs in the background and I keep my system clean daily from spyware, reg probs and other slow downs. </s>
<s> I know its a lousy system atm but here is what i have. </s>
<s> - 3200 sempron (I know, Iknow ) - asus socket 939 motherboard - ati chpipset (dont like nvidia) - 1 gig 3200 400mhz ram - ultra ata 133 HD (I cant aford 2x WD raptors on a raid 0 config lol) - ATI x550se - pci-e (added this) These are the main thing i am working with here. </s>
<s> I dont want to drop alot fo cash on this system but I want to replace a few peices to make my daily internet and gaming use runnning smooth enough. </s>
<s> I play WoW so nothing that is graphically strenuous. </s>
<s> I like to play at mid high setting and I can raid in a high end guild quite easily. </s>
<s> Processor is a big concern but I just want someones knowledge as to what should really be my first priority because a higher processor with a sub par things around it is usless. </s>
<s> I have run several benchmarks on my system after several tweaks I have done. </s>
<s> I have used SiS sandra and PC Mark05, keep cpuz and passmark's performance test (I get roughly a 310 score) I know its a convoluted questiosn but I just dont want to drop money on parts that are going to make the biggest diff. </s>
<s> Any information anyone can provide would be awesome </s>
<s> man your system is a t-bone compared to my hot dog computer. </s>
<s> Anyways, your motherboard is a 939 socket which is nice so you can upgrade the processer, and check out the ati x800 all in one its a nice card for overall computing, and just buy an external harddrive, i have seen nice 200-300gb ex hardrives for around $200 dollars. </s>
<s> Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, will ever have a bigger impact on your system than your cpu. </s>
<s> Don't waste another dime before you upgrade to an athlon 64, preferably dual core. </s>
<s> ok cool thanks, ive been looking at the 3800+ X2 and they are running for a descent price right now. </s>
<s> Anyone think iI should address the HD? </s>
<s> Just a guess but the price is right. </s>
<s> http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/storage/IDE-DMA.mspx The gist of this is dma might fib. </s>
<s> If dma shows off then turn it on, exit out and test. </s>
<s> If dma shows on, turn it off, exit out, go back and turn dma on, exit out and test. </s>
<s> Some folks have a whole bunch of unnecessary tasks and processes running in the background...dead weight. </s>
<s> I'm not an XP user but I suspect if you were to search around in the forums for how to shutdown unnecessary task/processes you might get some hints. </s>
