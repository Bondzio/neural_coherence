1.1.1	I 'm working on my sisters gateway machine that has one of those dual card modems ( 6001856 ) .	St
1.1.2	The computer recognizes it and AOL does too , but , when I try to connect online it comes back with a timeout and says no dial tone ?	Ques
1.1.3	I know the line has a dial tone , it 's the same one I use to dial out on with mine , not at the same time either .	St
1.1.4	The computer had a lot of spyware and adware on it among other things , which I removed .	St
1.1.5	I also even reinstalled windows without reformatting the HDD .	St
1.1.6	I ca n't figure this one out .	St
1.1.7	Any ideas out there .	St
1.2.1	I had a similar problem to a modem that would not dial , sometime found the tone , sometimes did a half dial .	St
1.2.2	Try reinstalling all the software and hardware ( if it can be removed ) .	St
1.2.3	If this doesnt work .	St
1.2.4	The card may be dead .	St
1.2.5	It could be a part that device manager might not reveal that the actual card is bad .	St
1.2.6	Modems are cheap so it shouldnt be too bad if this is the case .	St
1.2.7	Tyler	St
1.3.1	I 've actually updated modem driver and placed the card in a different PCI slot .	St
1.3.2	Still the same situation , I 'm also leaning towards a bad card now .	St
1.3.3	Gateway combo card , windows ME , just do n't understand why the computer is showing it good .	St
1.3.4	Modem initializes and dials but that 's it until it times out in 60 seconds .	St
