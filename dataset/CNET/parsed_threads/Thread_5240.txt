<s> I just bought a new Macbook, and was told to bring my old CPu from my Dell desktop to the Apple store and they would transfer my stuff. </s>
<s> So, I unplugged, &amp; disconnected the entire desk top mess of screen, speakers, wireless stuff, printer and assorted cords, etc. </s>
<s> and brought the big 'box' into Apple. </s>
<s> Originally I was told they could 'clean' the old unit out for me. </s>
<s> Now they say I have to do this. </s>
<s> a couple of things, - am not very computer literate/ don't have all my original disks from Dell - it is easily 6 years old.... </s>
<s> I want to give it away, but do I really have to hook it all back up and then buy a disk to clean it out???. </s>
<s> I will never remember what cord went where.... any ideas?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> Gift the rest, AS-IS. </s>
