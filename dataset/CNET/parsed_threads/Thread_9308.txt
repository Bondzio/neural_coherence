<s> I removed and refilled the black ink cartridge on my 880 and and could not get it to print. </s>
<s> Multiable cleanings would not improve quality of color so I removed it also and filled all the head wells with head cleaning fluid. </s>
<s> [read this was very effective on episons] Now black or color will not print. </s>
<s> Is this one of the Episons that has a chip to stop reuse of cartridges? </s>

<s> If this is the first time refill and it doesn't work, then you may have the chipped ink cartridge. </s>

<s> After removal neither black which, printed well or color,poor quality, would work. </s>
<s> It's a second hand printer but worked when I got it. </s>
<s> send a note to the guy at atlascopy.com, he knows a lot - fj </s>
<s> oops meant to say would NOT work sorry </s>
<s> You don't want to know I tossed out an Epson C80 last week. </s>
<s> I think someone carted it off and they won't write a similar post. </s>
<s> Nothing tells me that your printer actually works. </s>
<s> On the downside I had to buy a full set of new ink to see if the printer had failed. </s>
<s> Of course it had failed. </s>
<s> So smarting from that failure I bought a new printer and am back in business. </s>
<s> To remove part of the stinging feeling I lucked out and found another C80 owner and shipped him the full set of inks, then tossed out the old printer. </s>
<s> You have to grapple with these printers since the costs are now so low that a full set of inks is close to what the new printer is... Bob </s>
<s> seems I've not been clear last night. </s>
<s> Printer worked when I got it except red ink had lines. </s>
<s> Cleaning heads with head cleaning did not improve this. </s>
<s> After using printer for a while the black ink indicator said to replace it. </s>
<s> I refilled the black and it would not work after multiable cleanings. </s>
<s> Decided to remove both and use head cleaner in wells. </s>
<s> Then neither cartridge would work. </s>
<s> That's why I wondered if this Epson was one that had the chips to prevent the use of cartiadges once they were removed. </s>
<s> Trying to figure out if I need a chip or a printer. </s>
<s> Sorry for the confusion. </s>

<s> Sadly, if cleaning doesn't clear that up (you have to try some dozen times, then you have to decide if its worth it for a new printhead. </s>
<s> The &quot;chip&quot; on the inkcarts was visible on all the Epson models I've seen. </s>
<s> It's a little green/blue circuit board. </s>
<s> Refilling might be possible, but I never have. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for your patience. </s>
<s> Did 8-10 cleanings with no results. </s>
<s> Have some destructions for dismanteling and cleaning this printer. </s>
<s> Guess I have nothing to loose at this point. </s>
