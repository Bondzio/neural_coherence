9482	0	583666	5414524	NR	wolfrain9483	1/22/13 12:03 PM	1.35885618E12	How can I delete my partition?	I have an old Windows Vista system with the C drive capacity of about 76Gb. I have Unallocated space of 5Gb and then next to it the C drive of 70Gb but the Unallocated space is listed before the C drive. Have tried to extend volume from the C drive partition but it's grayed out. Have tried to make the unallocated space into usable space and then giving it a hard drive name to see if I can then delete it and then see if I can extend the volume at that point but that didn't assist me. Any ideas? Would appreciate any help

You'd likely do more harm than good since that partition was probably put there by your manufacturer for a good reason. It may contain recovery info or it may be used for security or other purposes. Windows provides a disk management tool under the Administrative Tools applet of the Control Panel, but I just remind you that &quot;if it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot;. Good luck.
