<s> Uhhhhh probably the twelfth of never. </s>
<s> exceeds the usable life of the average PC. </s>
<s> Thats a lot of space I know this is just a 3.5&quot; hdd for home computers but how does websites like rapidshare.com host content equalling petabyets! </s>
<s> Let us hope -- NEVER! </s>
<s> With the impending arrival of holographic storage, Blu Ray will look like a 3 1/2&quot; floppy! </s>
<s> Content host sites most likely use drive arrays. </s>
<s> This involves taking several drives and making one logical drive out of them. </s>
<s> The amount of data to be stored is dependent on the type of array used. </s>
<s> Look up &quot;RAID Arrays&quot; if you wanna know more! </s>
<s> While it appears at first the limit was in the PetaByte area a nice article http://www.dewassoc.com/kbase/hard_drives/hard_drive_size_barriers.htm Given that we see over 1.0TB today, that new limit appears to be something most of us will encounter. </s>

<s> The retrieval for whatever reason suits some task or need. </s>
<s> As they say, &quot;its not over until the fat lady sings&quot;. </s>
<s> That means gathering so much data, you'll know when an ant farts. </s>
<s> Why, anyone would want to know, it yet another question. </s>
