I would like to set up a Wireless B network in my home, not for my laptop, but for my Palm TX. The reason is for the Palm TX has wifi, but can only connect to 802.11 Wireless B Networks, so I am currently out of luck. I have an 802.11 Wireless G network, but that is after B came out. I want a B router and range expander to cover my whole house. Please help. What are the right products for an 802.11 wireless b network with a router and range expander?
