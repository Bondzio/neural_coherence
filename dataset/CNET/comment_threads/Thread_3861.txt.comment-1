On my old micron pc that was advertised as a 1 gig athalon processor the computer properties it says it is running at 1.01 gig.
Now I have since built a computer and it was advertised as a 2.6 gig athalon xp but it is running a 1600 why is that?
Do I have to change some settings to make it 2.6 gig Also how does Pentium 4 compare to athalon in the way they are rating the speed?
