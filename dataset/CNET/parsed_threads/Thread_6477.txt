<s> A friend of mine got me a USB thumbdrive on her recent trip to Hong Kong. </s>
<s> The first time i inserted into the USB port on my laptop it worked fine, but when i tried to write some files onto it, my antivirus start popping out saying there's a worm/virus, not sure which one actually is on the thumbdrive. </s>
<s> So after ignoring these messages and choosing &quot;Ignore&quot; every single time, it still wont go away. </s>
<s> Finally i started selecting &quot;Delete&quot; instead and after that the antivirus messages stopped popping up. </s>
<s> But that's when my problem started, the next time i tried to access the thumbdrive, it says i have to format it and i select ok. Then it gives me an error message, saying that the formatting of my thumbdrive could not be completed. </s>
<s> When i checked Properties for the thumbdrive, it now shows that amound of disk space available and used are both 0 when its supposed to show 7.85GB. </s>
<s> Then whenever i double clicked on the thumbdrive, it gives me this error message &quot;Please insert disk into drive G&quot;. </s>
<s> I dont even know what that means or what am i supposed to do. </s>
<s> I then thought of going to the manufacturers website to download a tool or utility to solve this problem, but this thumbdrive happens to be one of those anonymous made thumbdrives. </s>
<s> It is printed on the thumbdrive the word &quot;SONY&quot; and &quot;Micro Vault&quot; but when i went to Sony's website, non of the Micro Vault thumbdrives looked like the one that I have. </s>
<s> My laptop uses WinXP SP2 Home edition and i've tried the thumbdrive on all of 3 USB ports, and also on my sister's desktop but still to no avail. </s>
<s> Can anyone help me out here, because it would be a real shame if i have to throw away this 8GB thumbdrive. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>

<s> Hopefully the time I've saved you will pay for any other stick. </s>
