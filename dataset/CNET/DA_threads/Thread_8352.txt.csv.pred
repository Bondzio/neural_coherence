1.1.1	Hi, I have a Dell Dimension E520 with a Intel Celeron 2.8GHZ processor and 1GB of ram, and I want to upgrade it to be able to play blu-ray on it and since my processor isn't fast enought to play blu-ray, I want to upgrade my graphics from Intel intergated graphics so, that the graphics card will do all the encoding, so that it doesn't require the processor to encode it.	St
1.1.2	I am looking for a good graphics card that will do the encoding without using the processor that is under $200 and will work on my Dell Dimension E520 without having to replace the power supply.	St

1.2.1	Wouldn't a PS3 connected to your display cost less and work well?	St
1.3.1	$77 radeon hd 4650 no video card off-loads *all* encrypted blu-ray decoding so your cpu will still be used some.	St
