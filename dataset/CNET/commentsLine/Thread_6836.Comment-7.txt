if you haven't already done some of these more drastic solutions - you might try this.
i have the same problem with my wireless broadband router dropping me off line at times.
all it requires is to unplug the power jack on the back, wait 20-30 secs and plug it back in to reset it.
within a minute, i'm up and running on the network again.
