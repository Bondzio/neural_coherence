1.3.1	Standard Television is equivilent to 320x240 resolution .	St
1.3.2	This typically looks pretty poor on a full screen monitor .	St
1.3.3	30 Frames Per Second is considered real time video .	St
1.3.4	Most of the video capture cards clame 640x480 resolution and 30 FPS but they separate these as 2 different line items .	St
1.3.5	You usually get 640x480 at 15 FPS or 320x240 at 30 FPS .	St
1.3.6	You can save bandwidth by reducing to 25fps .	St
1.3.7	You should compare these numbers with your camera specs .	St
1.3.8	If it uses a standard lens you may be able to swap that out and improve the picture quality .	St

1.4.1	More than likely the resoulution of this camera is either 320x240 or 640x480 .	St
1.4.2	The 640 may not look that bad but if it is a 320 it would look terrible on a computer screen .	St
1.4.3	I think D-Link makes a similar camera that has better specs than the linksys , might be worth checking out .	St
1.4.4	Good luck .	Polite
