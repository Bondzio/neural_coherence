1.1.5	I have made ''20 GB HD'' Master and My DVD player Slave.	St

1.1.7	I do... see a bit of lagging... while loading the winxp.	St
1.1.8	HELP !!!	St
1.1.9	Gsoul2soul	St
1.2.1	80GB hard drive = UDMA5 = ATA/100 = 100MB/second 20GB hard drive = UDMA2 = ATA/33 = 33MB/second Other speed factors: - amound of disk cache (512K vs 8MB, larger is better) - rotation speed (4500rpm vs 7200rpm, faster/higher is better) You want the OS to be on the fastest hard drive (80GB), on the lowest IDE channel (usually labeled channel 0), and as a master.	St
1.2.2	Use an 80 wire (40 pin) Ultra ATA cable that is rated for ATA/100 or ATA/133.	St
1.2.3	I'd put the 20GB HD as a slave on whatever channel it likes.	St
1.2.4	Some older HD's and optical drives don't cooperate in certain positions on the same channel as other drives.	St
1.3.1	That Q Fireball is pretty loud in comparison, isn't it?	St
1.3.2	I still have a few of those around.	St
1.4.1	...look in DEVICE MANAGER to see if each IDE CHANNEL is in DMA MODE and not the slower PIO MODE.	St
1.5.1	he he he...	St
1.5.2	yes!!!	St
1.5.3	It can be a lillllll loud... ha ha ha	St
