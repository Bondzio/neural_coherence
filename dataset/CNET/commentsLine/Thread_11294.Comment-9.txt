the os will use the extra 1gb for other than the application things.
no, don't call any question stupid.
if you don't ask then you won't find out.
this issue is coming up a lot with people ordering machines with over 2gb.
as to the paging file, just let xp manage it and all will be ok. there is no speed gain by changing that setting.
