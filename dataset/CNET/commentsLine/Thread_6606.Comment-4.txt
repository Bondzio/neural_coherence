first i tried using open office only to find that my copy has a missing dll and therefore doesn't work.
they suggest downloading a new copy which one of these days i will probably do.
i then went to lexmark and downloaded drivers and almost before i could blink the printer began printing out a 17 page document ( i forgot to change the default from print document to print current page.)
but it works now.
thanks again.
