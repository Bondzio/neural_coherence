hi all, i was going through these lan hard disk available nowadays.
seems pretty usefull to have it on the network and then anyone can access it from their own pc.
but the problem is of access control.
what can we do if we do not want everyone to access every folder.
is there any way to do the access control based on users ?
thanks for the help aq
