i recently decided to go and purchase an imac because my 3 year old compaq desktop is truely outdated.
but now i discovered that mac os x 10.6 (snow leopard) is on the way.
do you think that a new imac or macbook will debue with os x 10.6 when it is released next year?
should i buy my imac now or wait?
thank you for your advice!
