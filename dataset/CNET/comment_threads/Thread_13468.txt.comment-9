Thank you everyone for your suggestions.
It helped me to narrow down my choice to buy the 'kit' RAMs.
The deal I found from VAPCMD's link turned out to be the best: Kit dual channel RAM - 2 x 1GB, DDR2 800, 240 pin, 1.8V, 5-5-5-18 latency, heat spreader: comes to around $65 (after rebates, incl shipping).
