<s> amd is faster for gaming. </s>
<s> but if u do like video and stuff, intel is a little faster but amd beats it in almost everything. </s>

<s> Intel's P4 can have 64-bit now which levels out this playing field. </s>
<s> Look for EM64T and you'll enjoy either 64-bit machine for many years. </s>

<s> Look at it this way: Intel HT - 32 strong capable workers doing a task AMD - 64 workers doing the same task Up to you. </s>
<s> 64bit simply is better at doing tasks, plus you can improve on it and have even more capabilities as time goes by. </s>
<s> Meaning, as any cpu before it, gets improved upon. </s>
<s> Plys 64bit is the wave of the future and so far has proved capable. </s>
