hello, i am running amd phenomii 3.2 black edition quad.
i have atx mid tower case.
i have been using the stock fan/heatsink since i got it and it cools fine but is really loud when playing games.
basically i don't want a huge fan/heatsink that won't fit in the case.
all the good ones seem to be designed for a huge tower case.
i would prefer one that sits like the stock one and doesn't stand because i don't think that would fit into the case.
anyone have a good one they've used that won't take up too much room but work better than the stock for a quad core amd?
