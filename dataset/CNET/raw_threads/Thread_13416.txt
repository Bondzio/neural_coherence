It came with 128mb SDRAM. I added a stick of 256mb SDRAM to it. when I check the computer to see how much memory there is, it still says 128. I was told that it will detect the added ram automatically. I added the ram because I was getting low memory popups. I am still getting them. Did the computer not take the new ram? The new stick of ram has been tested good also.

So my guess is the ram is bad, or doesn't work with my motherboard. Crucial.com says the density might be wrong, and that the motherboard is picky about its ram.
