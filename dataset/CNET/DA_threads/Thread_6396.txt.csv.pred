1.1.1	Hi, I have two computers on a network.	St
1.1.2	They access the internet via an adsl modem router, which works fine.	St
1.1.3	One has xp home, other has just been re-installed with xp pro.	St
1.1.4	Before I reinstalled xp pro, it all worked.	St
1.1.5	Now, I can't copy files from one computer to the other.	St
1.1.6	I have run network wizard on both pc's, folders are shared on both pc's, workgroup is mshome on both pc's.	St
1.1.7	I am logged in as administrator on both pc's.	St
1.1.8	Each computer can see the shared folders on the other, but trying to acces them gives an access denied message.	St
1.1.9	What have I overlooked ?	Ques
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	create an identical user account -same name and password on both machines?	St
1.3.2	If not, do so and then recreate the shares.	St
1.3.3	Shares created prior will not be accessible.	St
1.4.1	Also double check that Print and File sharing is checked in the Windows Firewall on both computers.	St
1.4.2	Disable any other firewalls such as Norton or McAfee.	St
1.5.1	Does this mean that I have to unshare all the shared folders on my machine I didn't re-install xp on, then re-share them ?	Ques
1.5.2	I presume I won't need to change anything on this machine, as nothing has been changed on it.	St
1.5.3	On a separate note, this machine lists under my network places all the shared folders that used to exist on the other machine, but don't any more.	St
1.5.4	How do I stop this machine showing shared network folders that no longer exist ?	Ques
