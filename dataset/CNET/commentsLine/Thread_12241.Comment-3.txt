think over this one.
if you set the video refresh rate to 60 hz, and your card tops out at 60 fps, then a benchmark like you noted could give you low marks even though it was giving you a solid 60 fps.
there was no need to generate more than that.
this is just one example of how a benchmark is flawed.
