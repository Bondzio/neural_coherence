all new geforce/radeon perform about the same for 2d apps such as adobe cs2.
any geforce 7300gt or radeon x1600pro will be more than sufficient.
both are in the $90 price range (from web shops) and both will fully support vista when it arrives.
also, practically all new cards come with dual monitor and hdtv support.
you're not paying extra for them since they're standard equipment nowadays.
