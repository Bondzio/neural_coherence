Hi, I'm trying to determine if his computer has an AGP slot.
I am aware that the Radeon 9200SE comes in both AGP and PCI versions.
The Radeon 9200SE PCI is definately not too fast or it wouldn't be made.
In fact damasta55r installed one in February.
The highest you can purchase in regular PCI cards at this time is the Radeon 9250, GeForce FX 5500, or GeForce 5700.
I have mentioned this before here .
There is a possiblity that he installed a PCI card in a PCI slot, but has a vacant AGP slot.
