<s> just wanted some opinions: my wife has an older dell, made in '02 in a packaged deal, came with an onboard graphics card that sucked. </s>
<s> anyhow, i want to find a PCI graphics card worth a crap, but id really like to buy a new motherboard with a PCI Express slot. </s>
<s> sims 2 and WOW run kinda meh on it, and 'dreamfall: the longest journey' wont run at all statistics: XP service pack 2 celeron CPU 2 GHZ 1.99 GHz, 768 mb ram visionteck xtasy 9200 series PCI graphics card it seems DELL computers are made to be the least compatible.... so anywho, this is one of the motherboards i was looking at over at newegg: BIOSTAR GF7050V-M7 LGA 775 NVIDIA GeForce 7050 Micro ATX Intel Motherboard http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813138095 it says it has an onboard gforce graphics card, but that cant possibly be any good, could it? </s>
<s> or this one: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813188023 thoughts? </s>
<s> advice? </s>
<s> thanks in advance! </s>
<s> I'm thinking you might be better off buying new than upgrading... New motherboard New RAM New PSU New Copy of Windows New Video Card Re onboard graphics...NO ! </s>
