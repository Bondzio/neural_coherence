If you have the manual that will be the easiest way to determine the specs. If not download and install Belarc or Everest Home. These small programs can tell you everything installed on your computer. Once you know, go to the ECS website to check the supported cpu's. Best of Luck

Depending on the mtrbd., it *may* also support the newer Sempron cpus as well. During the orginal release of the mtrbd. and later, many a bios update has come out, check the support website for the details, as some update maybe required to support the full range of cpus other than what it orginally supported. You will then know for sure what cpus it supports. tada -----Willy

But the most accurate info will be on the MOBO itself. There will be a version sticker next to the chipset. I had a version 5. Why limit yourself to Duron. The board takes Athlon, including Thoroughbred. The version # will tell you how late a processor and DDR memory (usually up to PC2100). Just checked Elitegroup. The latest (K7S5A Pro v.5 also takes XP Athlon. Good luck. chuck
