the computer filled a room.
the core memory had 4400 words of ten characters in length.
each character was 6 bits and, of course, it was not mine.
i was one of a staff of programmers and we programmed in assembler.
my first personal computer was a kaypro ii.
anyone know when that beauty first appeared on the market?
