you generally need to just remove the old heatsink/fan and then the cpu by disengaging a lever device.
the processor lifts out easily.
the new processor will have notched end to tell you how it's oriented.
you insert it and relock the lever.
then you need to install the heatsink/fan using an application of thermal grease.
generally the bios will properly configure the cpu timing but not always.
some older boards used jumpers that had to be moved around.
you would need a manual or jumper diagram specific to the mb to figure this out.
now, the performance increase you will get from a 1ghz cpu compared to yours now is not going to be much.
i have to wonder how much ram you have and if that might be a better way to go....or do additionally.
