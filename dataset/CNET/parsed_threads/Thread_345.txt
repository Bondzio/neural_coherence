<s> Running 3dmark06 professional version, I got a score of 10034. </s>
<s> Now, with my system specs I feel that is low. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any advice?? </s>
<s> Here is what I'm running: CPU: Core 2 Quad Q6600 @ 2.4ghz (stock) Heatsink: Zerotherm Nirvana Premium RAM: 2x2gb Corsair @ 800mhz (stock) GPU: evga GeForce 9800gt 512mb (stock) Mobo: nForce 780i sli Hard Drive: 500Gb Seagate Barracuda Looking at those specs, is my score low? </s>
<s> Or is that normal? </s>
<s> I have updated all of the drivers so I'm pretty sure that isn't the problem. </s>
<s> I have also ran a test on 3dmark vantage, and got a score of about 6300. </s>
<s> Thank you for your time. </s>
<s> Seems fine, I don't see why you think it should be higher, though most people do seem to be a little supirsed by how low their score seems to them. </s>
<s> You should look more at how its assigns the score. </s>
<s> Consider that it took a system with a a quad core overclocked to 6.5ghz to get a score above 45,000. </s>
<s> 3dmark is quite GPU intensive, upgrade the video card. </s>
