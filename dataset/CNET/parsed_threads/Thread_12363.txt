<s> hi, recently my CPU dropped 3 feet and ever since my fan is being weird, it would make noise from a cold start up and stay at 2000-2020 RPM, once it hits higher RPMS(2300+)the noise would get low and lower as the RPM goes up. </s>
<s> anyway I can fix this problem? </s>
<s> ty! </s>
<s> -Amjed my CPU: 3.0ghz intel4, windows XP, 500 watt SPU. </s>
<s> Since we can't fix said fan, we buy a new one and replace the failed unit. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Seriously, open case and inspect the fan(s). </s>
<s> If the cpu one, then replace for the small cost and the duty it does, why not. </s>
<s> Do this ASAP, it can only fail entirely later. </s>
<s> Robert, is right, please replace. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> I agree with what has been said. </s>
<s> Yea it sucks to buy a new fan, but it's better then buying a new CPU because it over heated. </s>
<s> Even if it's a case fan, it's better to replace for better airflow, and sanity since bad fans are really annoying. </s>
