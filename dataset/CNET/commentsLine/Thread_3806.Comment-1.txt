i recently purchased a new computer with vista.
now, most of the programs i utilized before on xp, are not yet compatible with vista so i want to go ahead and install xp on it.
my question is, do i un-install vista b4 i install xp, or what?
i spent my hard earned money on this machine and i'm not using it for what i want and need.
i also heard that vista can be slow, and my machine is so thats it...i want to get rid of it.
