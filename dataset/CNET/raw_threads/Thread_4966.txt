I have...ecsk7s5a mother board and pentium 4.. no sound card at the mo.. I have checked all bois settings and as far as i can see they are correct.. got all drivers including the sound driver.. checked the bios and ac97 is enabled and still no sound from the speakers.. i know my speakers work as i tested them on another machine. I am a real newb at anything outside of windows so any advice on how to &quot;get some bloomin sound&quot; would be a bonus.. Any tips??? thanks in advance.. willy

I have seen many people pull out their hair and the jack order was different. they did not look at the colors. Try removing and reinstalling the driver again. Did you get the driver from the CD that came with the board or was it something you downloaded? (Try the CD to be safe) After that, go pip up a Sound Blaster Live or Audigy. You will be much happier anyway.
