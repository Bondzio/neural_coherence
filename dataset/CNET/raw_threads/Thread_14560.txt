ASUS P4S800D-X http://usa.asus.com/prog/spec.asp?m=P4S800D-X&langs=09 or TYAN S5101AN http://www.tyan.com/products/html/trinityi875p_spec.html regardless of the price. thanks!

I have used ASUS exclusively for ten years and wouldn't think of using anything else. Why not think about the P5? and life goes on... Jack
