I went to Light-On's site and found the only Firmware version there. Downloaded and installed just fine. No problems at all. It told me to re-boot so I did. Now after I reboot Windows XP Pro says it found new hardware (the Light-On Drive that has been installed for over a year). I tried both options (To let Windows Find the driver, or me specify the location). Both ways Windows Doesn't find any Driver. If I try to select a driver I get &quot;DVD/CD-ROM Drive Filter&quot; It says this Driver is not digitally signed. I still try to install it. (after a couple of warnings that Windows can't verify the driver) Then it asks for PxHelp20.sys file. I find it in my Windows/System32/Drivers directory and install. Then it finish and says &quot;There was a problem installing this hardware.&quot; I end up doing the same thing again next time I reboot? Any idea what I need to do? My only worry is that I plan to re-install windows here in about two weeks. And I need this drive to work? My computer is a Asus P800-Deluxe P4 1gb of RAM?

What I've seen with other hardware is the firmware update seems to change the device type/ID. When windows goes looking for a driver to match the type/ID there is no match. Now it's back to the maker's site to find a driver that supports the new firmware.

Usually to help boost performance some, and so forth. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There should be no different drivers needed just because of a firmware update. I agree that is what so surprising. Also I have another (older) DVD burner that works just fine, no driver problems. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Now it's back to the maker's site to find a driver that supports the new firmware. The site doesnt have any drivers for its CD/DVD Drives. As far as I have seen, they want us to use the Windows XP Driver. I dont know if I have some newer driver that Windows Thinks it should install or what? I cant find the right *.INF file to get this to install properly.

DO NOT REBOOT! Shut off the computer and unplug it. Wait for about 15 seconds for the 5 volts to bleed down; plud it back in and boot as normal. Hope it helps!

I never changed the driver, just for some reason Windows XP can't seem to find the correct driver. For Firmwware, I actually wish I could go back to an old version but there aren't any listed on Light-ON's site. Only the version I currently have. I did find one on a different site (I don't know how old it was) but when I tried to install it, it already knew I had the latest version?
