Hi, I have followed the guideliness as written in here - http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/networking/expert/bowman_02april08.mspx I have a Desktop PC on which I have installed a D-Link DWL-G520 PCI Wireless Card (802.11g) while I have a D-Link DWL-650 Wireless 2.4GHz (802.11b) Cardbus Adapter installed on my Compaq laptop.
The Desktop PC is wired with internet connection (using Ethernet Card and NOT a cable modem).
I would like to share this internet connection with my laptop using wireless networking.
The issue is both the laptop and the Desktop initially seem to connect fine (as per the connection signal strength).
If the laptop is taken to some distance from the Desktop PC, it shows a fall in signal strength.
But after sometime the connection just seems to dies out and the host computer (Desktop PC) will alternatively flash the wireless connection is not available or connection is excellent.
All this time the laptop will suggest the connection exit with 'no signal'.
Also, even when the connection is fine between two pc's I cannot access the desktop PC.
I even tried to ping it but it does not work.
Both pc's are running Microsoft Windows XP SP2.
Here is the IP's used for the two connections: Desktop: =-=-=-=- IP Address: 192.168.0.1 Subnet: 255.255.255.0 Preferred DNS: 202.63.164.17 -=-=-=-= Laptop: =-=-=-=- IP Address: 192.168.0.2 Subnet: 255.255.255.0 Gateway: 192.168.0.1 Preferred DNS: 202.63.164.17 -=-=-=-= Can you please help me fix this issue?
Any assistance would be appreciated.
Thank You in advance.
Regards, Hiren Mehta
