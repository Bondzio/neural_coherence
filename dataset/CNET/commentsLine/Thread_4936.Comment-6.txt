then whoever pays the bill for the dsl owns that account.
if your roommates username/password was used to access the download site, that could be related to the problem.
if you pay the bill, that's a different matter.
this is beginning to sound like an issue you'll need to take up with your isp if it's just related to software they offer with a subscription to their service.
sorry...can't help in that regard.
