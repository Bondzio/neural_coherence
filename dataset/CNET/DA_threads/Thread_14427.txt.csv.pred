1.1.1	Any suggestions for wireless adapter for Dell Optplex 745 desktop ?	Ques
1.2.1	You could try any brand-name USB adapter , IMHO .	Sug
1.2.2	Just make sure it 's at least WPA capable .	Sug
1.2.3	Personally , I let windows XP software run the adapter , so it really does n't matter a whole lot what adapter you but .	St
1.2.4	Sure , some will have a bit better range than others , but if you 're well within range anyway , it wo n't matter .	St
1.2.5	Some models have a little & quot ; stand & quot ; to set the unit up so you get better reception .	St
1.2.6	Other cheaper ones do n't .	St
1.2.7	Depends how close you are to the wifi router/AP as to whether or not you need a stand .	St
1.2.8	Here is a cheap TrendNet model that is low profile and liked : http : //www.compusa.com/products/product_info.asp ? product_code=50741847 & pfp=browse & tabtype=rv # review You can also go with a PCI Adapter , if you have an open PCI port .	St
1.2.9	But I hear those can be a booger to get working sometimes .	St
1.2.10	I 've never installed one .	St
