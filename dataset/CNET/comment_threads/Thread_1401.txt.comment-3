ok, my mackbook recognises my router, so that i can enter its WPA personal encryption key.
It accepts the key althought still wont connect to the internet.
The status of &quot;AirPort&quot; in the network diagnostic is yellow, and underneath it says &quot;no ip address&quot;.
It has something to do with my router because my macbook can connect to a belkin router nearby.
I have tried turning the firewall and airport on and off but no luck.
Im also sitting right next to my router.
&quot;After not being able to load a page, does Safari display the Network Diagnostics button?&quot; Yes it displays that and says it cannot fix the current networking problem.
