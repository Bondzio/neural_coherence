But, Expedia's horrible service has kindly provided me with a $200 coupon for our next flight purchase.
This to make up for *&(#*#*&ing our last trip up.
So I have to use them to get my $200.
Otherwise, I would be buying DIRECT from ICELAND AIR.
Great people, decent food, nice little stop-over to strech the legs and grab a cig then off to destination.
Thanks for posting!
