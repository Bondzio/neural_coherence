Hey the new hard drive is 40 gb.
I am really just needing to put the hard drive in my Gateway computer with a 700 mhz cpu and 256 mb memory to install the operating system for a friend.
I am at work now, but I am getting ready to go home to work on the drive.
I am going to master the drive and try to install the operating system that way.
I do need to know if the Windows XP Home disk has fdisk on it.
Thanks again Laraine
