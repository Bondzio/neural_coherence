SATA to IDE adapters Personally, if it was necessary, I'd get an add in card rather than something that plugs into the MB ports. You might also consider that you won't be achieving the performance improvements that SATA offers. You're putting money into old technology but that's your choice.

Do a Google for ide controller card. I use one. When I plugged it in and powered up, XP found it and installed the drivers. No hassel.
