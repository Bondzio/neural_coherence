Why not specify a minimum and maximum size (10&quot;, 11&quot;, 13&quot;, 15&quot;) or resolution (800x600) for the screen, and a minimum widt (in inches or centimeters for the distance between q and \?

I understand all netbooks are generally 10&quot; but seen few like Lenovo Ideapad S10 which are 12&quot; (like standard laptop). So i was looking for something which is more like standard laptop is screen and Keyboard perspective but low end for just mail check.

Don't shop for a certain class of devices, shop for what you need. Luckily, I see you found one you like. Nothing wrong with Lenovo, of course. Did you see and touch it already in a shop? Kees

But searching LAPTOP 12&quot; in google finds some hits to shops that have it from HP, Lenovo, Dell, Acer, Asus, Fujitsu, Toshiba. Don't fully trust those shops. Visit the websites of the makers also. Hope there are one or more you like. Kees
