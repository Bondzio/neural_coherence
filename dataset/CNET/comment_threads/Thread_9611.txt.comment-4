Bob, I finally solved this problem.!
I had to go into my network (click on the little house-windows 7) to the PC/media devices/&quot;media player&quot; and add the other drive and/or folders to the media player's &quot;library&quot;.
Seems so simple yet I thought all I had to do was &quot;share&quot; the drive/folders I wanted to see on my TV.
At least with my TV; it has to be in the PC's Media player library.
The files are not physically in the library; they are just indexed, so to speak:)
