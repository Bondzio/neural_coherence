i have an ibm scsi internal hard drive that i use on a mac running os 9. my computer can no longer read the hard drive.
whenever i boot up the computer it will crash if the hard drive is installed.
when it is not installed it boots up fine.
the hard drive came with an adapter that i think may be the cause of the problem.
is this a common problem that can be fixed by purchasing a new adapter?
below is all the information on the hard drive label: type: dghs comp iec-950 *ece32284* *pn59h7013* sn 6810a623gk emc p/n 072-000-123 11s59h7013zm1fv110a623 9808 please let me know if you can help me with this situation.
i've searched the ibm web site but it appears they no longer have a support section for hard drives on their site.
thanks for any help you can give me.
