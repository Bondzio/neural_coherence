thermal tape is a tape used in between cpu fan and the cpu.
same is heat sink &quot;paste&quot; but it is in liquid form.
their job is the same, remove heat from the cpu.
as far as liquid heat sink paste is concerned, i myself use it, it will fully dry in 1-2 years.
see what my motherboard manual has written in it, &quot;the heatsink may adhere to the cpu as a result of hardening of the heatsink paste.
to prevent such an occurrence, it is suggested that either thermal tape rather than heat sink paste be used for heat dissipation.&quot;
