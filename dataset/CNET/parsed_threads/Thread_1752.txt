<s> I have a Lan-Plus laptop with an AMD Athlon XP-1600+ 1.39 GHz processor & 112 MB of RAM that's about 3 yrs. </s>
<s> old. </s>
<s> I purchased a wireless router & a wireless cardbus adapter. </s>
<s> However, I didn't realize my laptop doesn't have a cardbus slot. </s>
<s> My manual says it has a Infrared Data Port that allows it to be wireless. </s>
<s> What does that mean??? </s>
<s> My device manager shows under network adapters a 1394 Net adapter & a SiS 900-Based PCI Fast Ethernet Adapter. </s>
<s> Under Infrared devices it shows a Winbond Fast Infrared Controller (DMA). </s>
<s> I have no idea what those are or what I need to do. </s>
<s> All I want to do is surf the internet using my Road Runner! </s>
<s> Can I do this? </s>
<s> If so, what do I have to do? </s>
<s> Any help is greatly appreciated! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Just kidding I'm not familiar with infrared things, but I know that if you get online with that you will have a sloppy speed if at all. </s>
<s> Plus, security might be an issue for you. </s>
<s> assuming that you have USB 2.0 capabilities on your laptop, you could try getting the 54mbps wireless 2.0 adapter( http://www.netgear.com/products/details/WG111.php ) without parenthesis. </s>
<s> If you don't have USB 2.0 capibilities then probably your connection will be slower since USB 1.1 is 40x slower than 2.0. </s>
<s> If you have a free USB port then you are all set. </s>
<s> good luck and next time make sure you give people a really detailed computer spec. </s>
<s> sincerely; Aneudys </s>
<s> have in mind that wireless devices working together from a same manufacturer work better than two devices that are not. </s>
<s> eg USB adapter by netgear will work better with a router made by netgear. </s>
<s> I purchased the D-Link Router & Cardbus Adapter at the recommendation of a couple of different people, particularly because it's XBOX compatible for my sons. </s>
<s> But it sounds like it doesn't matter since I have such an ''antique'', which is what I was afraid of anyway. </s>
<s> Yes I do have 2.0 USB ports. </s>
<s> I guess extra info. </s>
<s> is better than not enough - sorry! </s>
<s> I'd love to dump it but I just bought my desktop a few months ago. </s>
<s> A P4, 3.4 ghz. </s>
<s> that flies compared to the laptop but I figured it would make a good backup when someone's on the desktop. </s>
<s> We also go camping & it comes in handy when trying to map your next stop when traveling. </s>
<s> But I see a new one possibly from Santa so I hate to spend a ton on $ on a card so your suggestion maybe the answer. </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> try getting a USB adapter that is made by D-link since it will work better with your router and make sure to set the wireless channel for the router on any of this 3 channels-11, 6, 1, -the others channels will be overlapping with microwaves and cordless phones and cellphones </s>
<s> Thanks for your suggestions - I'll give it a try! </s>
