you can test the setup by disconnecting the hd entirely, just leave in place.
access the bios and be sure that the cd drive is the 1st boot device.
i hope your ubuntu is a &quot;live cd version&quot; and then reboot to check status.
if the ubuntu boots quickly or it does different than before, report back.
if the system boots, then your hd is hosed.
if it hangs again at same point, then your mtrbd.
could be at fault.
of course, any ram or video still is installed, if you reduce or swap them out if status changes to narrow fault.
often enough, since you believe that a power surge caused the issue, you maybe chasing problem after problem even if you think you've resolved it.
too often another problem crops-up soon or it last at least 30 days or more, then i'll consider it resolved.
yeah, it maybe time to replace pc if issues happen too soon or problems continue and!!!
you can't trust the parts present in old pc until tested.
