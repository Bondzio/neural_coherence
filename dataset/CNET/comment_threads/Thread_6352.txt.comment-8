In my previous tests, I always left the processor in because I thought it would have no weight on the matter.
When I performed your test I removed EVERYTHING (including the processor) and only connected the PSU and the case speaker to the motherboard.
When I did this the PSU fan ran consistently until I cut the power, and when I replaced the processor, it went back to only turning on for a second.
Does this mean that the processor is the problem?
