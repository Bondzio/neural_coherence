In your situation, you are going to require a Wireless LAN Controller which is very expensive.
Though one controller can manage and control up to 25 Access Points.
Here at Honda I manage 2 controlers with 22 access points and I do load balancing on both and have the extra one for fault tollerence.
These controlers push out to the Access Points a number of things.
They broadcast 3 different networks that we have set up for wireless.
A guest network, a non secret network, and a confidentail network.
All three wirelss and using the same Access Points set up through the controller.
In your case for home use, I don't think it would be cost effective to go this route.
Though if you could find a Wireless LAN controller for cheap, then by all means go for it.... ~SpyderZ
