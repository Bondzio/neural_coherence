I can't access any files on the device, I can see it in my network as usual also I can see the main filesystem (Public, wiki, etc.) but when I click to open any of these folder message appears that device could not be accessed. I checked the web interface of the NAS and I saw that DataVolume is marked as &quot;failed&quot;. I really don't know how this could occured, what could be the reason. I need to access my files because many of my backups are there and so other important files. I ran the S.M.A.R.T. test (via black armor interface) on every of the four drives and all of them passed. Thank you
