<s> I am building a PC to mainly work with RAW image converters, photoshop and create DVD slideshows, so a bit of graphic work, but not really any 3D stuff. </s>
<s> Firstly, can someone suggest a decent motherboard with intel 775 socket and 1066Mhz FSB that would do the job. </s>
<s> Looking at around $150 US (&lt;$200 AUS would be good) Secondly, is there any need for a graphics card with the integrated graphics included with the motherboard and what is a good card to go for? </s>
<s> Cheers, Alex </s>
<s> Sorry I'm not there but if you want top CPU performance and not worried about 3D gaming even the lowest end video card (current models please) will do fine. </s>
<s> One of our best video editing machines (stable, fast, etc) had a 4MB video card. </s>

<s> look for a motherboard based on the intel G33 or P35 chipsets. </s>
<s> the G33 has integrated graphics. </s>
<s> for your type of work, you don't need a discrete graphics card, but if you stick with integrated graphics you'll be limited to one monitor. </s>
<s> (dual monitors are great for the type of work you mentioned.) </s>
<s> so, i suggest you get an inexpensive graphics card based on either the nvidia geforce 8400gs or the ati radeon hd 2400pro. </s>
<s> motherboards, $90-$115 USD: GIGABYTE GA-P35-DS3L MSI P35 Neo2-FR graphics, $40 USD: MSI NX8400GS-TD256EH GeForce 8400GS GIGABYTE GV-NX84G256HE GeForce 8400GS MSI RX2400PRO-TD256EH Radeon HD 2400PRO </s>
