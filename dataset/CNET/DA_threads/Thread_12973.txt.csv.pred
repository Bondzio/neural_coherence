1.1.1	Is 1GB the most you can put on a RAM card or is just too hard to make more then that right now ?	Ques
1.2.1	There is this custom memory card maker , but the memory cards run in the thousands of dollars since the volume is some hundred cards/sticks a month .	St
1.2.2	If you have the bucks , then you can get more on one stick .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	and looking at puny little banks of 64MB RAM boards ... ( Long , heart-felt sigh ... ) A gig plus per board , huh ?	Ques
1.3.2	( Feeling of extreme deprivation ... ) -JDM	St
1.4.1	their not cards first off their sticks secondly , the most i 've seen ever done on a single stick of DDR is 4GB , it was ECC RAM for servers ( how do you think quad Xeons can get 32GB in 1 board ?	Ques
1.4.2	it 's like 8 or 16 slots and 2-4GB per slot ... and yeah , it costs 5 digits ) but for SDRAM I believe 1GB is the max , but if the system is using SDRAM it 'd probably be cheaper to just upgrade ( unless it 's a cluster , where you have thousands of systems with SDRAM , in which case it 's going to be sad compared to DDR , RDRAM and DDR2 equipped systems ( it is possible to build a Beowulf that uses RDRAM , it would just cost multiple times what it 'd be worth ( As the RAM would outweigh the cost of any other single component ( unless your talking Petabyte HDD storage ammounts ) so it would be pointless , as DDR PC 3200 in single channel can wallop any form of RDRAM ( well , i 'd like to see RDRAM 1600 Dual Channel ( Rambus speaks of it , but i have n't seen it ... ) )	St
