<s> I just bought a new Dell Studio XPS 9000 desktop equipped with Windows 7 Home Premium. </s>
<s> I also bought an HP all-in-one model CD035A printer to use primarily for printing 8 1/2&quot; x 11&quot; photos. </s>
<s> I printed about a dozen photos, and all photos had terrible color - totally inaccurate coloration. </s>
<s> I returned the printer to the retailer and upon the advice of a Geek Squad representative at the store, I exchanged the HP printer for a Kodak ESP 7. </s>
<s> After installing the new printer, much to my dismay, the first 2 - 8 1/2 x 11&quot; glossy photos I printed had the same terrible coloration. </s>
<s> Is there something in Windows 7 that causes this? </s>
<s> Can I adjust something so I can get accurate coloration? </s>
<s> What is causing the bad coloration? </s>
<s> My previous HP printer worked like a charm from square one when using a Dell Inspiron equipped with Windows XP Professional. </s>
<s> How can I get my color photos to print in accurate colors? </s>
<s> Any help will be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
