Thanks Bob.
Gaming really isn't my thing.
Does Photoshop process through the GPU or CPU, mostly (I haven't found a solid answer online)?
Do you think (for my uses) that it is worth the extra $200ish for quad-core?
Quad would also automatically give me the larger GPU.
Sorry for so volume of questions, I simply want to understand.
This question going to anybody BTW.
