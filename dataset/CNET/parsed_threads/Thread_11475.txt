<s> I am interested in buying a wireless projector for home use. </s>
<s> I plan to mount it to the ceiling. </s>
<s> It will just be using it with my computer for general applications and display (not for gaming). </s>
<s> The projection distance will be about 8 to 10 feet. </s>
<s> Ideally I would like to have 1024 x 768 resolution, but could live with less. </s>
<s> Most of the projectors that have come up in my search are over $1000.00. </s>
<s> Can anyone recommend a good projector or two, that is under $1000.00 (including the networking capability). </s>
<s> Also, do I need a special wireless router to use it? </s>
<s> I just have a broadband wireless router (Linksys WRT160N), will this work for this purpose? </s>
<s> Thank you. </s>
<s> You didn't explain what Wifi has to do with your usual projector. </s>
<s> I would be guessing you thought you could use Wifi to get an image from your PC (?) </s>
<s> to the projector. </s>
<s> I could be wrong. </s>
<s> Look at http://www.veebeam.com for another wireless solution. </s>

<s> That seems like a pretty unique option. </s>
<s> Although it mentions that it is for use with a TV, I assume that plugging that into the USB port of a projector, that it should transmit the image through? </s>
<s> I though most projectors though used either VGA/DVI/HDMI for video signals... so would a USB link work? </s>
<s> With regard to the WiFi reference, most of the units I have seen refer to WiFi as a connection. </s>
<s> Certainly if there are other (cheaper) options out there such as BlueTooth or USB Wireless, then I indeed would be interested in those options as well. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> As to your wifi reference can you supply an example? </s>
<s> I can't find any. </s>
<s> We know that bluetooth's data rate is so low, well, so low, who told you that was an option? </s>
