well, talked to a case manager and after a bunch of circling around the block, i asked if hp was refusing to investigate a consumer complaint to see if any connection existed with the f1703.
the case manager stated that hp was refusing to investigate.... the better business bureau is forwarding my complaint to hp as we speak, and i am filing a comnplaint with the california state attorney generals office in next few days.
i also contacted girard gibbs law firm who had previously investigated the f1703 issue and they are looking into opening an investigation into this one.
i will keep all advised of progress as i hear back from sources.
i also emailed contact 4, our local television consumer source but not sure if they will pursue.
put it this way...its not over until the last dance has been danced.
will update soon, hopefully...
