well, i did download and install their free software, and it did fix the communication problem between the 2 computers, so that's great!!
however, it didn't change the situation with the printer at all, so i'm wondering if there are some settings in the printer that need to be clarified.
when i go into the screen on the printer (hp d7460), and go to network settings (or connections - can't remember which word they use), it asks for the wep code.
i have no idea what it is or how to find out what it is.
might this be the problem, and if so, how would i find it to enter it into this screen?
the network magic software really bogged both our computers down a lot, so i've uninstalled, but am very happy to have communication working both ways for both of them.
thanks for the suggestion.
