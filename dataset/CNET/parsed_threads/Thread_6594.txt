<s> I just bought 1G (2x512 MB) of Corsair TWINX PC-3200 DDR RAM and installed it successfully after I removed my old RAM and set the settings in my BIOS manually to CAS 2-3-3-6. </s>
<s> I want to be able to use my old RAM (512 MB (2x256) of OCZ PC-3200 DDR RAM) in my computer at the same time, but every time I install it, my computer gets past the BIOS diagnostics, but just won't load into windows. </s>
<s> I have an ABIT IS7 mother board which is compatible with both types of RAM, it just seems like my CAS settings are not good enough for my OCZ RAM. </s>
<s> I just learned what CAS settings are today, after having a really hard time getting my new RAM installed BTW, so I'm totaly new at this. </s>
<s> On the OCZ website the CAS settings are 2-3-3-7. </s>
<s> I tried changing my BIOS to those settings with just my Corsair RAM installed, to see if it would load windows, and it does. </s>
<s> But as soon as I add my OCZ RAM back in, Windows won't load anymore. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any suggestions as to what my CAS settings should be to work for both types of RAM? </s>
<s> I'm so new at this and I really don't want my OCZ RAM to go to waste. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance! </s>
<s> In the end they re-read the manual and found only certain combinations would work. </s>
