1.1.1	I just bought a usb 2.0 pci host card to upgrade from 1.1 .	St
1.1.2	When i booted up after I plugged it in , my computer locked-up after about 20-30 seconds .	St
1.1.3	It seems to be at the very end of the boot-up , right after I get the & quot ; new hardware found & quot ; message .	St
1.1.4	The card is generic ( I think ) , with an NEC chip .	St
1.1.5	I have Windows XP Home , which I updated fully through MS website , but problem occurs the same .	St
1.1.6	Problem goes away , with no side effects , when card is removed and re-booted .	St
1.1.7	I have a P4 2.2 with 512M ram .	St
1.1.8	Lock-up occurs with card plugged in each of my open slots ( to cover my bases ) .	St
1.1.9	Any ideas/suggestions would be much appreciated .	Polite
1.1.10	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	Sounds like a faulty card or somekind of conflict with XP .	St

1.6.1	I had the same problem , this is how I fixed it ; take the card out , download the cards drivers , then reintall the card .	St
1.6.2	Check your device manager to see if the card is intalled .	St
1.6.3	If that doesnt work there should be a number to call the manufacturer .	St
