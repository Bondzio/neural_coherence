Hello, I just purchased a USB 3.5G modem - model: K190 made by KTech and I need its drivers/software. It doesn't work (except the extra SD memory card capability) as it doesn't have any drivers or software on it, contrary to what the store clerk said, maybe there's a defect because I already tried it on two different laptops. Certainly, it didn't come with any CD or manual nor can I give it back. The company doesn't have any website and there are no drivers to be found on the internet.. I spent hours looking for the modem's drivers.. I would be very grateful if somebody could help me out and if possible, send me the software/driver of this modem to my email address: gkmansion@o2.pl If somebody from this website doesn't help me, I will have to throw it away:( I paid $25 for it.. I realize that for some folks it's nothing, but I'm quite poor and I can't afford to buy another model.. Thank you for your time and help in advance. Greg
