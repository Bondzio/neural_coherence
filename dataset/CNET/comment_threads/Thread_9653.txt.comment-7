Well, That could be a problem seeing as how I have a Dell wireless card.
I know on the Dell website they advertise/sell Linksys, Netgear, and D Link.
My girlfriend and myself often send files over the network to each other.
I know that using a USB drive would probably solve my problem, but just wondering what your folks thought?
Has anyone had good experiences with the Dell Draft-N card and a particular router?
BTW thanks Bob for all of your help!
