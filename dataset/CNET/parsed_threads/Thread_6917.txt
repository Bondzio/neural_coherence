<s> I just got my pioneer 108 yesterday from www.dangeo.com. </s>
<s> i'm running: windows xp dell dimension 2100 128 mb ram 18.6 gb hd i took out my old drive that came with my computer and replaced it with the dvr-108. </s>
<s> all the cords are in the same place but when i try to use it i don't get anything at all. </s>
<s> i can get it to physically open so i can put in discs but whenever i put in a cd or dvd it tells me to insert a disk into drive D (when i double click on it in my computer.) </s>
<s> does anybody please have any ideas of what i'm doing wrong? </s>
<s> also whats this master/slave thing and would it have anything to do with it? </s>
