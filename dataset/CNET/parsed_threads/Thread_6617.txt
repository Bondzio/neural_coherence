<s> I am interested in installing wireless service here at work for employees to use for personal business. </s>
<s> Most of us are here for several days consecutively and using work computers for such business is forbidden. </s>
<s> My question is, will installing a cable splitter, new modem and a WAP successfully isolate our server from virus dangers? </s>
<s> I plan on installing the splitter at the wall where the cable comes into the building, before the modem that's conected to our server. </s>
<s> -Thanks </s>
<s> I witnessed this and here's what happened. </s>
<s> The employee would catch some pest and when they connect to the work network pass it on to the rest of the crew. </s>
<s> It's not that safe to give then such access unless you lock it down to &quot;approved&quot; sites and block email access. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> It sounds like a bad idea all the way around to me. </s>
<s> I am not even sure it is possible to do what you have in mind... Maybe someone else could tell you that, but I don't think you can just split the line and put two modems on it. </s>
<s> And even if it were, if your work is so worried about you using company resources for personal use, I seriously doubt they would be very understanding of you leaching bandwidth off a company cable connection reguardless of the security issues involvoed. </s>
