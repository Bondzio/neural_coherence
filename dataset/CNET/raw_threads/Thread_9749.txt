Think it maybe hardware. No error message just distortion in the live TV. Sometimes its vertical lines and sometimes its horizontal lines. I have updated WinTV PVR-250 software and drivers all the way through too WinTV 6 and have the same problem. Thanks Kirkwa1

I am not complain about, as you say, &quot;new user of analog capture MIGHT and WILL complain about issues with video capture that just years ago folk accepted as normal.&quot; The problem I am having is so so bad, you can not see a picture. As for my post, are you suggesting I have post this question in the wrong forum?

I can't tell from your first post how bad it was. Maybe you can put in the full details and a youtube of the results? Some folk are easily upset at discussion forums so if that's you, we might not get along. I have analog capture experience to before the Amiga days, even on the IBM 8088 days so I'm ready when you tell more. In the meantime if you want to know what I use for the capture step it's a DVD RECORDER. That's my secret. Bob
