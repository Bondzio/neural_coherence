I have a Dell Dimension 8200 and am looking into the best way to back up my system.
Since my memory is not the best, I would like to be able to set this up with the minimal effort.
I need this to mainly back up business data, but the holiday snaps might be a good idea too.
I've been looking into a number of things, thinking that a RAID 1 Solution would be the best, mirroring all the data I have.
I'd looked at the Western Digital Pro/Premium II, NAS devices, external SATA drives , people at work mention that all I would need to do would be to add a Hard Drive to my machine and do either Software Raid or if the machine supports it Hardware Raid.
I'm just wondering what the best solution would be, if there is any special software that I should be using.
Willing to spend up to $600 to get this in place and would like the solution to not effect the performance of it too much.
Any help would be gratefully received.
Cheers, Stuart
