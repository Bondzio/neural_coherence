The old drive was left in as a slave drive, and a new installation of Windows XP Home SP2 was installed on the new drive. The first thing I did when I got my machine home was to make sure windows was totally updated. Since then, none of my USB devices will work. When I plug any of them in, the computer will make the usual &quot;bling-blong&quot; sound, but nothing else happens. It makes the usual &quot;blong-bling&quot; sound when I remove a device. I am currently using (well, attempting to use) a Microsoft Wireless Optical Mouse 2.0, a Brother MFC 5440CN, and a TV tuner device. None of them work at all. I tried to go into the Device Manager and update the drivers on the USB controllers, but Windows was unable to find an updated driver. So, I uninstalled the devices and re-booted the machine. I then went into the Device Manager and updated the drivers on the &quot;Unknown Devices&quot; that were there. This worked and Windows successfully installed drivers for all six entries in the device manager. However, after rebooting, I am still having exactly the same problem. There was no change at all. All of the drivers for the hardware are up-to-date and have been installed, uninstalled, and reinstalled. I am running out of options! Does anyone have any advice? Thanks for your help! =) I have a P4 2.5G 750MB 160GB with Windows XP Home SP2.
