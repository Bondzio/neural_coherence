<s> I've added a StorageTek USB Hub to my wife's laptop. </s>
<s> Win2K recognizes the hub. </s>
<s> It also recognizes all the devices (netgear usb 802.11g adapter, HP Printer, storageTek mini optical mouse) when connected directly. </s>
<s> When I try to connect all of them through the hub, they do not work. </s>
<s> There are 4 ports on the hub. </s>
<s> When I look at the properties for it, it shows the correct number of open ports (I've connected all combinations to test it). </s>
<s> I've tried to restart in safe mode, uninstall and reinstall the hub and nothing seems to get the devices to run when connected through it. </s>
<s> The hub and mini optical mouse came with no disk (packaged that way, so I assume they are standard for at least win2K). </s>
<s> Does anyone have any suggestions? </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Now I wish there were labels to distinguish them and the devices that will work on them. </s>
