It's all about physics but to keep it short I won't write about electrons, CRTs theory of operation but just share that it was 1897 when this was discovered. http://www.davidparker.com/janine/electron.html Bob

The volume at which you play the speaker isn't, itself, an issue but excessive vibration can damage just about anything. Much will depend on just how close the speaker is to the CRT and whether or not it's magnetically shielded. Symptoms of damage from magnets are color and image distortion. You can easily see this by moving a smaller magnet around near the screen. Most minor magnetic damage isn't fatal and some will be produced by components within the monitor itself. But, these tend to have automatic degaussing functions that reduce or eliminate the effects of magnetism. Here's a youtube of what a magnet can do. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1coFI5OLSwY
