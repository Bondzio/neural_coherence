Okay, after finding out where disk management was (Stupid vista), I probably could've learned that the disk was &quot;Not Initialized.&quot; Might've fixed my problem before I decided to use the WD diag to write zeros to the entire disk.
Course, that is if initializing didn't force you to reformat the drive anyway.
Just my luck.
