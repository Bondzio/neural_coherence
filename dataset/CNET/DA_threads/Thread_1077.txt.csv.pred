1.1.1	So , I am in the process of doing the research to build myself a new computer .	St
1.1.2	For the most part im pretty sure i have a good grasp on what i want and need except for the video/graphics card ...	St
1.1.3	I do a lot of work with 3DS Max , Solidworks , CAD , Photoshop & Illustrator CS3/4 , etc.. and Im not sure what video card would be best for those applications .	St
1.1.4	I hardly do any gaming what so ever .	St
1.1.5	At the moment i have been looking at the ASUS EN9800GT .	St
1.1.6	I have heard good things about it from multiple sources but nothing pertaining to its performance on 3D modeling .	St
1.1.7	Does anyone have any suggestions as far as what card would be best for 3D modeling ?	Ques
1.1.8	Any help would be greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.1.9	Thanks .	Polite
1.2.1	professional 3d apps publish a list of & quot ; certified & quot ; cards for their app .	St
1.2.2	these certified cards are usually nvidia quadro and ati firegl cards however they use the exact gpu as the consumer geforce and radeon product lines .	St
1.2.3	the only difference is the these professional cards are provided with enhanced drivers and software support to ensure top level support for the pro 3d apps .	St
1.2.4	some apps perform better with ati cards and some perform better with nvidia cards .	St
1.2.5	the difference between the two is usually only noticeable to people who use a certain app *all day long* .	St
1.2.6	any current radeon or geforce will work with illustrator , maya , autocad , etc .	St
1.2.7	but they may produce anamolies that you may or may not encounter .	St
1.2.8	these anamolies are bugs that the graphics card vendor has no obligation to fix and most are bugs that are very infrequent or easily worked around .	St
1.2.9	so the & quot ; best & quot ; card can be found by checking the forums for your various apps and determining the latest/greatest ati/nvidia card , or sticking with a 9800gt ( as you mentioned ) and only upgrading if it has some deficiency that you can not tolerate .	St
