1.1.1	My roommate bought a new wireless router , installed it on his desktop and it worked fine .	St
1.1.2	Then , when he shutdown his computer the signal cut out for the router and when the computer is turned back on the connection stays off .	St
1.1.3	So far the only way to get it working again is to re-install every time .	St
1.1.4	The router is still on , it 's just everyone loses connection when the desktop turns off , and we ca n't figure out why .	St
1.1.5	He 's using Windows Vista sp2 and the router is a D-Link Xtreme N Gigabit router .	St
1.2.1	Could you let us know how exactly the wireless router fits into your network ?	Ques
1.2.2	Is it connected this way ?	Ques
1.2.3	Internet - & gt ; Modem - & gt ; Wireless Router - & gt ; Desktop Or is it configured differently ?	Ques
1.2.4	Is there another router in the mix somewhere ?	Ques
1.2.5	There should n't be any need to reinstall anything on the PC to get the wireless working for others .	St
1.2.6	I 'm assuming that a simple reboot of the router does n't work ?	Ques
1.3.1	It 's connected as you said Internet - & gt ; Modem - & gt ; Wireless Router - & gt ; Desktop and rebooting it did n't work either .	St
1.4.1	Are you losing the actual wireless signal ?	Ques
1.4.2	No signal strength on the laptops and does the WLAN light on the router go off ?	Ques
1.4.3	If that 's the case , then I 'm thinking the router is faulty or possibly the NIC in your desktop is bad .	St
1.4.4	Test by connecting a laptop by wire to the router and turn it off as you did with the desktop .	St
1.4.5	If the problem reoccurs , then it 's likely the router is bad .	St
1.4.6	If you are just losing access to your network ( wireless still operates but ca n't access resources/internet ) , then it 's likely some kind of configuration problem .	St
1.4.7	You may want to refer to the forum sticky for network setup tips .	St
1.5.1	It 's the router that has the issue .	St
1.5.2	thanks for the help .	Polite
