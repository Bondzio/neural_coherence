Hi there, My router seems to be frozen with all lights on.
With power cord in, I tried resetting per the dlink website, but after several seconds of holding the reset button in, it stays frozen.
I also tried something called a &quot;recovery reset&quot; and that didn't work either.
Anyone have any ideas?
Thanks!
