ok, this takes us back to, probably a driver error or possibly a program you have that is not compatible with xp.
what is the exact error code?
is it the same error code as before?
stop: 0x0000008e (0xc0000005, 0x8053dd91, 0xf897cf74, 0x00000000)?
if so when you updated your video driver did you uninstall the driver first?
