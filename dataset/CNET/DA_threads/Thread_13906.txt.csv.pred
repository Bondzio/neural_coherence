1.1.1	I have chosen to eliminate cable due to the availability of web-content provided by websites such as ESPN3.com , Hulu.com , and the network tv websites .	St
1.1.2	I currently have an extremely old PC ( 2003 ) hooked up to our main television , and although the internet connection is typically sufficient to stream content , the computer can not perform quick enough to meet our expectations .	St
1.1.3	I do n't know much about hardware but I would imagine that it is a result of a poor graphics card and slow processor .	St
1.1.4	I 'm trying to purchase the cheapest PC possible , and the ONLY thing it will do is stream live video content from websites .	St
1.1.5	Can anyone provide me with any suggestions as to what I need to look for in a PC , any suggestions , etc ?	Ques
1.1.6	Thanks very much for your help !	St
1.2.1	I picked up a Lenovo y530 for 499 to do just that .	St
1.2.2	It has enough cpu , ram , and HDMI to get it done .	St
1.2.3	Maybe there 's cheaper but look at the y530 as a benchmark on what it takes .	St
