Now I have a problem with the partition of the hard drive. I don't understand what it means to partition the HD, and most importantly, how much to partition it. I have a Western Digital 160GB EIDE . I understand that I won't get all that 160GB, but I want to get the most out of it using NTFS because I read that it is more secure than FAT. My computer specs are 900 Mhz, 512RAM, Western Digital 160GB EIDE Please explain what partitioning the hard drive is in lamest terms and please explain how many sections should I partition it into as well as any recommendations. Thank you so much .

You have to partition and then format a drive before you can use it. If you're installing a version of XP with service pack 2 you can create one partition for the entire drive. Use the XP installation disc to do this and format with NTFS file system.

For example, if you have numerous pictures and music files you'll want to copy them to some kind of removable media such as CD-R, DVD-R or Thumb Drive and store them in a safe place.
