All re-arrange under varying install site, conditions, YOUR CHOICE OF SETTINGS, firmware versions and if we include support the winner changes daily. ALL those you listed are names I've installed in the last decade excep for ARUBA. So I'll arrange all but ARUBA as number one and put ARUBA as item 2. Hope this helps. Bob

All are fine devices and companies and the winner will change depending on site, install location, settings and which tech support person you call. ARUBA is not a name I've encountered in decades of setting up networks. So that's the problem. If you haven't been doing this for long you may think there is a good to best ranking. The truth is deeper than that. Bob
