i just recently bought a new video card, an ati radeon 9250 256mb agp card.
my old card was an ati radeon 7200 64mb agp card.
when i went to switch them out my computer didn't recognize the new one yet it still runs fine with the old one.
basically my monitor never recieves a signal and it gives me the error sound of a long beep followed by 2 short beeps.
i hooked the card up to another older computer running a nvidia geforce pci card and it booted up fine.
the old computer is 5 years older than mine.
i've tried everything i can think of and i'm stumped.
any help would be appreciated.
