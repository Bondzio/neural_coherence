If you are using XP, Excutive Software sells a program called UnDelete.
Their website is http://www.executivesoftware.com .
You are correct in assuming that windows does not delete a file when you have deleted it from your system.
The first character of the filename is changed to a ?
and windows no longer recognizes that the program exists.
If you have NOT written or deleted anything to your hard drive, you may be able to recover it using a program called Win Hex and change the ?
back to the original first character.
