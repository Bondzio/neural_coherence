<s> Here's my problem and no one has been able to give my an answer. </s>
<s> I have a direct TV Tivo box combined. </s>
<s> I want to be able to watch shows recorded on another TV in the house. </s>
<s> I have an 802.11b wireless network. </s>
<s> How can I do this? </s>
<s> When I got the TIVO satelite box was a USB port that was &quot;for future use&quot; Neither TIVO or Direct TV cam tell me whether they ever activated it. </s>
<s> Do I need another stand alone TIVO, and then move the files from one to another? </s>
<s> Does that mean another TIVO monthly service. </s>
<s> How do you move the files? </s>
<s> It seems with all the talk of the &quot;connected home&quot; this would be a simple and common request. </s>
<s> The geek guys at Best Buy said yeah that's a good idea. </s>
<s> but I don't know if you can do that. </s>
<s> And to let them know cause they want to also. </s>
<s> Haven't tried this myself, but check these sites for possible info and experts: http://www.9thtee.com/ http://tivo.samba.org/ http://www.tivofaq.com/hack/ http://www.tivohelp.com/ http://www.tivocommunity.com/ </s>
<s> Not sure about tivo, but replay units will talk to your computer and store movies and pictures and send them anywhere you want. </s>
<s> Check the tivo site there should be a software download to do this, </s>
