1.1.1	I have a Dell A940 printer and recently it started acting up.	St
1.1.2	After completing a print job, I can look at the print job status and it will show the job as deleting but it will not complete the process.	St
1.1.3	I have to go into Task Manager (Windows XP) and manually end the process.	St
1.1.4	I've reinstalled the most recent printer driver to no avail.	St
1.1.5	Any ideas?	St
1.2.1	Dell has it's own support armada.	St
1.2.2	Use them.	St
1.2.3	If you aren't happy, ask for the unit to be exchanged or ask for a refund to go get another printer.	St
