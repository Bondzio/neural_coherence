Microsoft seems to leave us with such bugs.
They tend to fix them when a computer maker like Dell wants to sell a box with Windows and the engineers get to work to find and patch the bug.
Sorry but did you go looking in the KB (knowledge base) for your issue?
I did it once just as an example and now it's your turn.
