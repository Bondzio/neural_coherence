it seems that you're a beginner gamer you should ask the shop for the potential of increasing the video card because when you buy an integrated card it is usually not increasable if it is intel video chip but if was from nvidia or ati it is usually expandable but you need to increase the ram because the term integerated means sharing from the computer ram.
i hope this explaines a lot of your questions; so bottom line ask the shop dealers about everything!.
