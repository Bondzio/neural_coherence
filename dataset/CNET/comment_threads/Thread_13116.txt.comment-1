Hello my WRE54G is giving me problems.
Whenever I try to log into the webpage to configure it (192.168.1.240) it does not load.
I have it wired to my router (WRT150N) and have tried accessing it from a Windows 7 wireless connection and a Windows Vista Ethernet connection.
But both can't access the page.
I have tried holding the reset button for 15 seconds and still the same thing.
I was able to access it before but had to reset it for some reasons...
Anyone with some help???
Thanks, Tony
