Maybe you could do this if the netgear was on the internet connection since from what I read the apple router can be a repeater (that's no bridge.)
From what you wrote I doubt you want a bridge but may want a repeater.
As in all these setup the repeater is placed halfway from the source to the final destination.
I've lost count how many times that they put the repeater in the room that had bad coverage.
