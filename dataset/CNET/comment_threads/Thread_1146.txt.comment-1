I have been trying to find the binary file for an old Soyo BIOS - 5eh-1bc1.bin - no luck, even from the 'obsolete' section on the Soyo website!
My old PC is working fine, but won't recognise hard drives over 40GB.
So I've a choice between using a smaller (second user) drive, or buying a new motherboard.
Any other suggestions?
Hope the question's clear enough; I'm new round here Cheers, SJ
