I have two options for video in my BIOS: 'auto' and 'PEG/On-board'.
The former is described as using whatever PCIe graphics card is installed.
The second says it will use the on-board graphics UNLESS there is a graphics card in the PCIe slot, in which case it will use that and disable the onboard graphics.
I was hoping there be a simple 'On/Off' choice for the onboard graphics.
I don't know if there is a jumper.
It had crossed my mind, but I haven't had the time to find out.
The deal with my graphics card is that my computer has a compact chasis and therefore requires a half-height PCIe card.
My ATI card has two hookups, but they are DVI and S-video.
The card does show up twice in the Device Manager, though, so thanks for that tip.
