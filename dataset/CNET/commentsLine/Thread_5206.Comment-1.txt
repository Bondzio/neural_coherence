quick question - i already have mentioned card and am considering buying a 2nd to set up a crossfire system, does anybody already have a system like this?
is it worth it?
my mobo supports 1xpciex16 and 1xpciex8 so in crossfire they will both run at 8x will that affect performance?
i am thinking that the combined 2gbs of gddr5 and 2 gpus will more than make up for the banwidth drop - am i correct?
thanks for any advice.
