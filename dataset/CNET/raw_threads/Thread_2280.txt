I added a hard drive yesterday, and it shows up and everything works fine as long as I go into the BIOS when I start it up. If I don't go into the BIOS, (I don't even have to do anything in there, I just go into it, and exit, and the 2nd hard drive works 100%) then the hard drive won't show up in My Computer, and it shows up in control panel under add new hardware that my 2nd hard &quot;This device is either not present, not working correctly, or does not have all the drivers installed properly. (Code 10) What am I doing wrong, I know its probably something dumb.

Next, consider whether your power supply is adequate. It's possible the drive is not spinning up quickly enough. You might also disable any &quot;fast detect&quot; options in the BIOS or such that does only a quick memory check. It might mean that your entering the BIOS and doing nothing just adds enough delay time for the drive to get ready in time before Windows starts.

I don't see any option saying anything about Fast Detect. The computer was already set up to have an extra hard drive, so I don't think its the power, but it could be I guess.

Some have a setting that does a quick check but will allow a slower more thorough test. I can't say whether this feature is in your system or tell you where to find it. But using the full mem test will slow the boot process and possibly let the HD get up to speed before the BIOS goes looking for it. If the problem is that the POST outruns the hardware readiness state, a device might not show.

No idea what any of that means really, but I'm gonna guess that you do since you asked for it.

They probably changed the BIOS a lot in the last 5 years to make up for things like this, but thats what I get for having a BIOS that was made over 5 years ago
