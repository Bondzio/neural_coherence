You have a dated system.
Increasing ram and swapping out the PSU seems to be your best bet.
Under XP OS, having 512mb is practical, 1gb being the most sensible.
Gaming just puts it all in a basket and tests the wankle out of it, so upgrade.
Since, you system is older don't expect the newer demanding games to run as well too after the upgrades, they want so much more as you review those requirements so beware.
If possible, you may want to look for a better cpu as well for the total upgrade path options.
Yours *may* support upto 2.4ghz/P4 and that too needs better PSU.
