Is it ok to uninstall the following: 1. Microsoft Works (that's 567.00MB) 2. Adobe Reader (that's 204.00MB) 3. Windows Live Essentials (that's 120.00MB) 4. How do I disable the warning that comes up when the computer is turned on saying my computer is not protected. THANKS!!!!

I don't need any type of security. Like my lap top, I only use that to watch movies and create text files at work.

Uninstalling Adobe Reader is safe. But don't do it if you expect to use this netbook for an occasional reading of pdf-files. http://download.live.com/ tells what programs are part Windows Live essentials. If you don't use them, it's safe to install them. Kees
