to unaware customers.
reminds of the day the imacs came out in august.
i was in the store when they were announced, and they were still selling the other imacs for full price.
at least the previous mbps seem to priced well on the apple refurb section, but then you'd have to figure out if it was an unsold model or an actual refurb.
not much justice there for some people.
*sigh*, this is a repeat of the last refresh for me... i got my original mbp a month before the santa rosa models came out, and then it was replaced with the said model a month before this penryn upgrade... ironic isn't it?
ah, but that's how it always is with apple.
guess i should get used to it .
