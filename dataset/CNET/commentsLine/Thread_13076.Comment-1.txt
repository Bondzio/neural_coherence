help!!!!!!!!
i will try my best to explain this.
my puter is constantly freezing up.
whether i am running a program or not.
it is always happening.
it just happened typing this line.
it remembers the key strokes or mouse clicks and then performs the operation about 10 seconds later.
i have run spybot and cleaned up a bunch of stuff from that, but still doing it.
happens all the time, daily, driving me nuts.
any help would be greatly appreciated.
thanks in advance all.
