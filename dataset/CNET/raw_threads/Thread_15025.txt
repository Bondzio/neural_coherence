I tend to use my notebook for graphics editing (Photoshop, Illustrator), medium gaming (aoe3, sims2), listening to music, and Internet. It also seems like most laptops I look at either have a base Intel 950 or high-end geforce GPU, how would this factor into my needs when complemented by either of these CPUs?
