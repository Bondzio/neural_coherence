<s> How can I set up our router (D-Links 655) to limit our roommate's bandwidth? </s>
<s> ftp://ftp.dlink.com/Gateway/dir655/Manual/dir655_manual_150.zip This router does not offer a feature to limit bandwidth. </s>
<s> You can however block P2P use which would accomplish the same thing for abusive users. </s>

<s> What is P2P? </s>
<s> I don't want to completely block our roommate's Internet access. </s>
<s> However, I do have a scheduled time when I disconnect everyone from the Internet, so I am the only one online. </s>
<s> I have secured our wireless connection with a complicated network name and password, so our roommate cannot get online wirelessly. </s>
<s> And it does appear to have some hours of operation to block this or that. </s>
<s> You can google research P2P so no need for me to write what that is. </s>
<s> -&gt; Let say you used a complicated name and password on a WEP protected network. </s>
<s> Today's easy to use tools can get that information in about 2 minutes. </s>
<s> Go figure why they offer WEP. </s>
