4109	0	235494	2413563	NR	schneidley	2/25/07 8:31 AM	1.17239226E12	I accidentally deleted my SCSI/raid drivers	I am running Xp home MSI 875p neo3 F pen 4 2.8 GHz 1 Gig memory 2 x Maxtor l01m120 120 gb SATA HDD All-in-Wonder 9800 HP DVD 420I Memorex CD/DVD rom I somehow deleted the raid drivers and now my cd roms will not work. Device manager gives me a code 41 under the cd rom drives. Windows successfully loaded the device driver for this hardware but cannot find the hardware device. (Code 41) Under the SCSI/raid controllers, I get this: Windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged. (Code 19) I cannot reinstall win XP without a CD rom drive and cannot install drivers without redoing XP? Completely at a loss. This is my baby, I built her in 2003, and I can't fix her for the 1st time!

Use their instructions on how to reinstall AFTER you delete those noted filters. Bob
