I read all that thread.
Very good solutions.
But it require U3 drive.
I just purchased a Wstern Digital 120GB USB drive Model WD1200U017-001 I like to put my files on this and e-mail program.
I am using outlook express but I am open for suggestions.
I would like to hook this to couple different computers and access my e-mail account and download e-mails on this USB drive.
Once I am done I do not want any trace of the activity on the computer.
Please provide any suggestions.
