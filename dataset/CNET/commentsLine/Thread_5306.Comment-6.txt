nice choice of drives.
you must have some seriously heavy duty storage or i am still madly frugal with my space.
to the best of my knowledge both ghost and drive image work in a windows and dos environments via guis (graphic user interfaces).
they create a series of image files no larger than 1 gb in size (dos file size limitation) and various levels of file compression can be applied.
they both create and recover from these image files and can also be used for disk duplication (should you want to swap out a hard drive).
to use either program under dos you will have to tweak the configuration files (config.sys & autoexec.bat) along with the addition of a few other files to get usb and firewire connectivity.
there is other imaging software available such as acronis and if you look on the net there are even some freeware options available.
given the value of data it is worth spending some money on something you feel will work.
do a search on the web for ghost and you will most likely get a very detailed overview of how it works and how well it works.
if you are keen on going the dos route send a reply and i will try and give you some help with the configuration files.
