I've worked on many Dells, and really enjoy how easily they open.
I wish all cases were screwless.
I've even added RAM from underneath the desk, while the operator takes a two minute break.
The only tool needed is a flashlight.
No unplugging, no screws to lose, just push the button and pop the side cover off.
I don't even lay them on their sides.
