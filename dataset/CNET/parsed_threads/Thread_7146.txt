<s> i have been using a toshiba satellite laptop with intel wifi4965agn with no problems. </s>
<s> it suddenly no longer sees my router's ssid. </s>
<s> the recent changes have been the purchase of an iphone4 2 days prior to the problem. </s>
<s> my wife has had the same phone for nearly a year without problems. </s>
<s> the only other thing might be software updates, which were adobe reader, mcaffee antivirus and itunes. </s>
<s> the most recent was adobe. </s>
<s> before it stopped recognizing my ssid, it would drop the connection and connect itself again. </s>
<s> it sees all the other ssids in the neighbourhood but not the one in the house! </s>
<s> very odd. </s>
<s> i tried running connectivity doctor. </s>
<s> it told me there was a problem the log says media state disconnected. </s>
<s> furthermore, our iphones are working perfectly. </s>
<s> I'.m using a buffalo wzr2 g300n but everything is in japanese. </s>
<s> i am able to set it up, just can't tweak it as the instructions for the english models are quite different. </s>
<s> any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you. </s>
