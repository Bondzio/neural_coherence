<s> Hi, I am running a Dell Laptop, with a docking station, and using a Netgear WGR614v9 router. </s>
<s> My goal is to be able to unhook the laptop and use it wireless when needed. </s>
<s> I have a wireless network going now and it works like a charm. </s>
<s> The problem is when I unhook, the network goes down. </s>
<s> I do not plan to have a PC wired to the router at all times. </s>
<s> My understanding is that this is not needed. </s>
<s> Cable is hooked to modem, modem is wired to the router, and the network cable is wired to the docking station. </s>
<s> I do not think I even need the connection to the docking station, but right now that is how it is set up. </s>
<s> I guess my question would be - can I run this router to just route the network signal and not have it set up as an access point or a permanent connection? </s>
<s> Is this not possible? </s>
<s> Thanks for any advice you have. </s>
<s> Set up the wireless protocols in the router via wired. </s>
<s> Unplug the wired cable and use the wireless connection. </s>
<s> Use the docking station as usual, but connect wireless. </s>
<s> &quot;Going down&quot; is a common issue when switching from wired to wireless, as in unplugging from a wired docking station. </s>
<s> Fixable by rebooting the laptop. </s>
<s> Sooooo, just set up the wireless and remove the Ethernet cable from the docking station. </s>
<s> Run wireless all the time. </s>
