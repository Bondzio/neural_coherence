11489	0	265355	2591355	NR	sowana	9/24/07 11:27 AM	1.19063322E12	Superdrive replacement questions	Hi, I have a 12&quot; G4 Powerbook (1.5 GHz PowerPC G4, 512 MB DDR SDRAM) running OS 10.3.9, with one of those crap MATSHITA DVD-R UJ-835E Superdrives that I haven't had the cash to replace (until now). There are two places I'm thinking of using: MacService (www.macservice.com) IResQ (www.iresq.com) Both companies install the Panasonic 8x dual layer, which I understand is what Apple also uses. My questions: 1) Is the Panasonic as unreliable and prone to breakdown as I understand the Matshita to have been? 2) Is there a better drive out there? I've heard that Pioneer DVR-K05 is more reliable. 3) If you think I should just go with the Panasonic, do you have anything positive/negative to say about either of these companies? Thanks in advance for your help!

They didn't do a good job of relaying that all these low prices came at the cost of lower years of life in the products. So I want to warn you that your replacement drive will likely last just as long as your UJ-835E. That being said, I try to shop at the usual Mac outlets since they'll get me the drive that will &quot;just work.&quot; I know I get to replace these things about every 1 to 3 years depending on a variety of factors.
