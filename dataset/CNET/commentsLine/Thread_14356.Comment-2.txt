first question would be are all you clients in one location or are you looking to directly transmit to a lot of remote clients that are all at long distance.
if they are all in one location you would in effect build a point to point wireless connection and then build another wireless network at the remote location to server the users.
if they are all in different remote locations this is very tough to make work well.
this is very similar to wireless isp that use central towers to provide internet in rural locations.
you will need to use professional equipment to get good results.
one of the more popular systems is called canopy by motorola.
it has many features like qos and bandwidth sharing.
of course this all comes for a price.
