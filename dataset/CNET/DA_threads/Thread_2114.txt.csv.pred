1.1.1	I just bought a HP with Vista and a Macbook with Leopard .	St
1.1.2	I have a Netgear router , VPN 824 .	St
1.1.3	I connected both notebooks with the router ( note that I had set up the rooter two years ago using a PC ) Now , I want to create a LAN so that I can share files between two computers .	St
1.1.4	I scouted this web site and I found information dated in 2005 on how to add a PC with XP system to a MAC but this does not seem to help .	St
1.1.5	Any help/idea is greatly appreciated	Polite
1.2.1	connecting to the router and accessing the internet is done with TCP/IP protocol , so they both are speaking the same language then .	St
1.2.2	Your problem is sharing drives of dissimilar file systems , which ca n't see each other .	St
1.2.3	What you need is a file system both can see and write files on .	St
1.2.4	That would be a FAT32 partition on one of the computers , or a LAN capable external harddrive with FAT32 partitions on it , hooked to the router .	St
1.2.5	Here 's a page about what Mac computers can read only , read and write to for file systems .	St
1.2.6	Claims Mac can at least read NTFS partitions , so curious if yours can & quot ; see & quot ; files on the Vista computer ?	Ques
