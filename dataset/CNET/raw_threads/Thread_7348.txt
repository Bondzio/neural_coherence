Since you only asked which is better that could mean by price or small file performance, big file performance, small or big file read write times or something else entirely. I suggest you find some storage site review and maybe it's just the price. HOWEVER if this is on an older than Windows 7 OS I'd not do this. Bob

A friend tried that same model SSD on a Windows Vista machine and it was a total disaster, nothing but trouble. He did a clean install of Windows 7 on that same computer, reinstalled the SSD and cloned the harddrive to the SSD and it works great.
