hi bob, the second part of your answer is exactly what i was asking for.
the thing is i don't have a ton of room and i wanted to ask the cnet community if they had any other suggestions for me.
i just found the bad caps yesterday so yes i am replacing them.
i live out in the country in canada and it's not the easiest thing to just go and get something and try it.
i have ordered all different sizes of caps that i need and i will be trying them when they get here (likely up to two weeks) i was simply wanting to know if this was something i should try (yes i did spend a few hours googling this stuff) or if my monitors were likely to just be toast.
