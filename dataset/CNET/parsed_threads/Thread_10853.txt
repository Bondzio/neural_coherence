<s> I have a Gateway computer a couple of years old. </s>
<s> Recently my monitor started to get blurry adjusted the setting but nothing seems to help. </s>
<s> Is there anyway to get it back to the default setting, thinking that it may be the setting that are wrong? </s>
<s> Does anybody have an idea of what it might be? </s>
<s> Or is it just a bad monitor? </s>
<s> Thanks for any help I get!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> hooking a different monitor to your computer. </s>
<s> If that monitor is clear than your monitor is bad. </s>
<s> If the other moinitor is still fuzzy than it's either your motherboard or a video card (if it has one). </s>

<s> My dad's monitor was getting black lines on his monitor where the screen was fuzzy. </s>
<s> He replaced the graphics card and it was fixed. </s>
<s> I suggest that you probably test whether or not it is the monitor </s>
<s> Didnt mention I did hook up another monitor, that is how I am able to still use it, and it is working great! </s>
<s> So do you know of anyway to set the monitor back to the default settings? </s>
<s> Thanks for you help!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> info as you can provide. </s>
<s> No, I don't think the monitor can be fixed. </s>
<s> Maybe degausing it will work, Need a shop for that. </s>
<s> They are pretty cheap (of the CRT type). </s>
<s> Flat panels now close to $150. </s>
<s> Good Luck. </s>
