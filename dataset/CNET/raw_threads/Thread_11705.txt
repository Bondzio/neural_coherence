5957	0	114702	1303408	NR	tomcaz	7/16/05 9:19 PM	1.12154874E12	Can someone please clarify things up a bit.	I purchased an eMachine with a Sempron 3000+ processor, 120 GB hard drive, Double Layer burning DVD, 512MB memory, nVidia Geoforce 4 card, and I use a high-speed cable modem. The box advertising said it was designed for &quot;multimedia use.&quot; I recently went back to the store (WalMart, by the way) and noticed a new eMachine &quot;bundle&quot; on the shelf with an AMD Athlon 64 processor. It was designed for &quot;gaming.&quot; Uh-oh. Why wasn't the bundle with the Athlon there before? I am enjoying my system, but my question (if I haven't bored you to tears yet) is: If I want to play games, for example, like Half Life 2, Area 51, Riddick, Call of Duty (games I've read about and would love to play) is my Sempron 3000+ up to the task? Can I get by with it? Is there that much of a performance difference? Several months from now, am I going to go to the store, look at a program's (be it a game or grafx tool) requirements and say, &quot;Oh well, looks like I can't run this one on my machine.&quot; I've tried Googling, but I'm somewhat perplexed with the information I've found concerning doubling clock speed (how?), cache, FSB, etc. The last computer I owned had a 386SX chip and I remember that I should have gotten a true 386 chip. Did I inadvertantly do the same thing again? Cognitive Dissonance is running somewhat high. Thanks for your help.

A year ago a 3000+ Athlon would have been consirded a FAST gaming system. It will do a good job on games. Yes a AMD64 is a faster processor and the way things are going. If you can return the Sempron and get the AMD64 I would do it. The last computer I owned had a 386SX chip and I remember that I should have gotten a true 386 chip. You haven't had one since?? John

Your Sempron 3000+ is an excellent processor and all it needs to game is a good graphics card. A Nvidia Geforce 6600GT would do the trick.
5957	4	114702	1303803	1303731	tomcaz	7/17/05 8:33 AM	1.12158918E12	Well....	Back in the day - Windows 3.1 - a 20 Meg hard drive (What am I going to do with all this space?!?) - Wing Commander was the closest thing to flying an actual X-Wing - IBM Microchannel architecture (another mistake of mine) - Roland MT32 - Sierra - Space Quest - King's Quest. It was great. And then, I began having trouble getting &quot;newer&quot; programs to run (even more so). Upgrades ($money$), patches, install errors, compatibility issues, etc. I used computers on the outside (work, school, library), but didn't purchase any newer models. I got by for a long while, but it became increasingly clear, and I grudgingly accept the fact - one simply has to have a computer today, in much the same way we have cars or phones - it's inescapable. I was still using my WalkMan cassette player a short while ago until my friend told me to &quot;Wake up and smell the 90s.&quot; (Yes, he knows its 2005, but that's his oddball humor at work). It's a bummer that computers can't be more like consoles, where I can pull any game off the shelf, bring it home, and simply play it - no problema. But I do use my computer for graphics/art, emails, research, etc. as well. Well, that's the story (and I'm stickin' to it). Thanks everyone, for your help.
