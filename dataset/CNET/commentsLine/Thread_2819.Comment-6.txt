oops, forgot to mention that if you have a seagate or maxtor hard drive, the acronis &quot;migrate easy&quot; cloning program from acronis true image is available free from seagate's download website:  see the &quot;data migration&quot; heading to download diskwizard for seagate drives, or maxblast for maxtor drives.
note to old timers: this is not the old maxtor data transfer program for a new hdd that never worked right.
it is actually acronis' migrate easy.
