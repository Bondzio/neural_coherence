They're all good, but I prefer the D-Link routers for several reasons that include their performance, their user interfaces, their ease of setup, their versatility, their rock-solid reliability, and most importantly their absolutely SPECTACULAR customer support.
I personally use a D-Link DIR-655 which reaches every corner of my rather large, three-story home with excellent throughput.
As with most routers nowadays, when wired it serves as a gigabyte switch.
I got mine very soon after their introduction over three years ago now and it has never suffered as much as a hiccup requiring a reboot.
But understand that any router, even old 80211.G routers (please get an 80211.N -- it really makes an ENORMOUS difference), can swallow a 12MBPS network connection -- or MUCH faster than that -- without a hitch.
Your router will NOT be the choke point effecting Internet performance.
Please note that my preference for D-Link in my own home and my recommendation of them to others is what a lawyer would call a &quot;statement against interest,&quot; in that I own stock in Cisco, manufacturer of LinkSys home routers.
