I cannot believe I am having this much trouble finding a laser printer that prints on 80 lbs (216 gsm) coverstock that is 3 1/2&quot; x 4 7/8&quot; - typical 4bar or A1 flat card size.
Why is this not something that laser printers can do?
Again, I want to be able to print on an A1 flat card size piece of coverstock (80 lbs or 216 gsm).
Anyone have any ideas??
Thanks for your help!
