thanks for the comments guys, i really valued your opinions.
the next cpu up from mine would undoubtedly be a quad core but there's still a premium to pay with the price despite them being old hat now.
there's one cpu quad at 300. phew!
as bob said it's not worth the extra few mhz i might get.
thx again, it's nice knowing guys like you will offer honest opinions, and i was just fishing around for a second opinion.
cheers
