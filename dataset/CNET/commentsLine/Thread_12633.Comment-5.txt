i have also found reports of this (and other problems) with itunes 5. i have searched for version 4.9 but the couple of links i have found to this version have been &quot;disabled&quot; with the message that posting the earlier version violates apple's software terms and conditions or some such &quot;anti user&quot; tripe.
i appreciate your reply and information but i think i (and others) may need to ride this out until apple releases a new version correcting such problems without admitting they exist.
