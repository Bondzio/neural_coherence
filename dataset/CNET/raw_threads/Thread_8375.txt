I have an Asus Pk53 Deluxe Mobo Newegg.com - ASUS P5K3 DELUXE/WIFI-AP LGA 775 Intel P35 ATX Intel Motherboard - Intel Motherboards with 4, 1GB chips of Team Xtreem DDR3 1333 RAM http://www.teamgroup.com.tw/teamgroup/en/productDetail.php?pd_id=2&pl1_id=1&pl2_id=1 I just bought a pack of Kingston 4GB (2 x 2GB) 240-Pin DDR3 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820134792 to replace 2 of my old RAM chips (eventually Id like to replace all of my old 1gb chips for 2gb chips and have 8gb total RAM) but am having freezing problems, restarting issues, and an error just before Windows starts loading : Overclocking failed! Press F1 to enter Setup or F2 to load defaults and continue. Hitting F2 has so far worked. My computer doesnt freeze, and the performance increase with the 2 extra gb is noticeable. The problem with that is that if i try to restart my computer it never restarts, the monitors dont even turn on. I have to &quot;hard shut down&quot; with the power button, start up and hit F2 for the Overclocking error again. I thought the problem might have been that the two different kinds of RAM dont work well together. But then I removed all of my old RAM and left just the two Kingston chips and it still freezes my computer. Everything still works fine when I put all of my old chips back. Is my motherboard not compatible with the Kingston RAM? It says it works with 1066 or 1333 DDR3 RAM, 240-Pin. Are there other specs I'm not taking into account? Im pretty sure I have the latest BIOS update. The default BIOS settings seem to set all Overclocking options to Auto so Im not even sure whats Overclocking and whats not. And I dont really know enough to start changing BIOS settings myself. Any help on this would be greatly appreciated!! :-D -V

I havent contacted Kingston yet. The pack was a Christmas present from my sister and brother, so if I have to I can get the purchasing info from one of them. I just checked the QVL list for the p5k3 ( didnt know what that was till you mentioned it, so thanks) There are 2 Kingston models on the list......one of them matches my RAMs model number up to the last 4 digits. KVR1333D3N8/1G &lt;-------- thiers KVR1333D3K2/4GR &lt;-------- mine Is that good or bad? Thanks again! -V

Description P5K3 Deluxe BIOS 1014 Support new CPUs. Please refer to our website at: http://support.asus.com/cpusupport/cpusupport.aspx Modify CPU temperature sensing algorithm. Improve compatibility with certain DRAM modules. Fix the system is unable to resume from S3 with certain CPU. Improve EZ-Flash compatibility with certain ATAPI CD-ROM. Fix C1E, TM and EIST can't be set as Disabled. Fix CPUs that support 0.5x(N/2) FID cannot run at max ratio with max VID while EIST is enabled. Fix CPU frequency is incorrect after setting NOS to Auto. I think you need the BIOS update. Re the RAM...double check with Kingston...see what they say before flashing/updating the BIOS. Let us know.

It seems that the most current version is 1206. Should I get the latest version, i.e will the latest version have all the fixes from previous versions or do I specifically need version 1014 as you said?

I updated to version 1014 and everything seems fine so far.....no freezing or Overclocking errors, and my computer restarts normally with the new RAM in. It even works with 2 of the old RAM chips in it so now I have 6gb. I cant wait to get 2 more Kingston chips and have 8!! :-D Thanks again! You Rock! -V

There were more recent BIOS updates but as I recall they were noted as BETA and they mainly addressed newer CPUs. What OS are you running ? VAPCMD
