d-link, netgear and linksys.
these guys have the largest market share.
buy what you find on sale.
i have mixed feelings about hawking and airlink.
the docs for these products are weak.
i never tried belkin or smc but many others seem to like their products.
if you have the urge to become a hobbyist you can try the linksys wrt54g.
there are 3rd part images that allow additional features.
