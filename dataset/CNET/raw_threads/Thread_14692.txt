I've recently realized that my 16 gig hard drive only has about 600mb still avaiable. I'm looking around to see what's taking up so much space when I find out my &quot;documents and settings&quot; folder is 7 gigs. However, I cannot find any files within this folder that even come close to adding up to 7 gigs. What could possibly be causing this folder to take up so much space if there's nothing that large in it?... nothing I can see, anyway? Any info would be greatly appreciated.

Oh, what a statement you may think, but why does it hide items and show items that are not directories and files? Here's what I use -&gt; Guyla's Navigator. A little quirky to some, but free and is a file/directory browser. Bob
