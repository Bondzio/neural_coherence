I think sony makes things difficult so you cant upgrade and have to buy a new computer.I tried circuitcity, best buy and compusa and they dont have low profile power supplies. Can anyone help me? thank you

Believe this is the PSU part number '146870914' If it were mine ....I'd double check the SONY PSU part number, take measurements, see if it wired generically and look for a generic replacement. $225 for a 400W PSU is absurd and a SONY GOTCHA ! If you can't find an economical replacement ...may be better to use the money toward a newer PC. VAPCMD

Video cards are for Advanced Users from what I have read.. and 600-watts seems to be the minimum on having the NEED for a Video Card.. .. Power Supply's come in Form Factor..plus you want to measure the one in your PC..the serious part is about useing a Power-On Button.. Some PSU incorporate a Power-On Button..some DON'T/the latter would need the resource of your Front Panel Power Switch.. .. And you Do Not want to eliminate any LED's that inform of PC Operation.. .. Check on Form Factor.. and the 2 x 10 or the 2 x 12 Configuration....for the MAIN Plug on the Mother Board.. I saw little differance in upgradeing..except that extra wires are there.. ..there are some New Specs on Power Hook-up on the Board.. Research it..its not too difficult.. Start w/FORM FACTOR.

If you need 400 watts for the hardware, I wqould doubt that you could cool the system adequately in that small case.
