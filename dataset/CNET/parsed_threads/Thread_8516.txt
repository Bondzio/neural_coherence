<s> I have a USB Memory Bar USB Device Flash Drive which I got recently. </s>
<s> I was able to use it for a few times but after that when I click on properties it has 0 bytes capacity and the file system is RAW. </s>
<s> I could not format it because it says &quot;write protected&quot; but I know that it is not write protected, since it is not the type with a write-protect notch/switch. </s>
<s> I always safe-remove it whenever I use it. </s>
<s> Please help, thank you.I am using Windows XP Service Pack 2 </s>

<s> Well! </s>
<s> My flash drive of 2GB stopped writing at under 1GB and I got the usual write protected message and tried a number of things on the internet. </s>
<s> In the end I started the PC in safe mode and right clicked the drive to format it. </s>
<s> It started but then near the end came up with a cannot complete this action message. </s>
<s> Having restarted the PC normally I right clicked the drive again and this time it began formatting normally. </s>
<s> Problem solved I hope!! </s>
