I seem to have discovered the reason for being unable to see files on my other PCs on the LAN.
The Vista Network and Sharing Center kept sending me to Windows Firewall settings, but there also is the Norton (*$?%) firewall in which I found 'File Sharing' blocked.
Turning that off made it OK at least for the wireless connection to the LAN, and I assume this also works for the ethernet connection.
I still have a username and password problem to my Win98 system, but I'm getting closer.
Being able to see the folders is much more satisfying.
Thank you
