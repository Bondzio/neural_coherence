1.1.1	Hey All , I own a Dell XPS 600 running Windows XP pro w/2GB of ram and a 3GB D/C processor it also has an SLI ready motherboard .	St
1.1.2	I recently purchased two Geforce 8800GTS oc video cards so that I may finally utilize the SLI function .	St
1.1.3	The computer came with a single GeForce 6800 so the manufacture felt that they didnt need to send a Sli Bridge assuming that I would never think to use the SLI feature I guess .	St
1.1.4	So , Ive been doing some research while trying to acquire an SLI bridge from Dell which is not going well as they dont have any in stock at the moment .	St
1.1.5	So , my questions are , Does anyone know for sure that I need to use a proprietary SLI bridge made just for my motherboard or is it safe to use an after market model ?	Ques
1.1.6	Are they all the same ?	Ques
1.1.7	I see some going for $ 12.00 and some going for over $ 100.00 .	St
1.1.8	How do I choose ?	Ques
1.1.9	Any insight would be greatly appreciated .	Polite
1.1.10	Thank You in advance .	St
1.2.1	with the MB ?	Ques
1.2.2	Might check with Dell .	Sug
1.2.3	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	Look for the flexible ribbon-type bridges rather than the fixed ones , seeing as the hard bridges have to be the exact distance between the connectors on the cards , making it much more difficult to purchase a fitting bridge .	St
1.3.2	There is no difference between the bridges aside from length and material , but if you 're concerned about a few picoseconds of latency , feel free to trouble yourself with locating a hard bridge .	St
1.4.1	Thats all I needed to know , I was under the impression that I could n't use any SLI Bridges other than what was made specificlly for my motherboard .	St
1.4.2	Now I can stop waiting on Dell to find one for me .	St
1.4.3	Thanks All for your time and info it was a great help .	St
