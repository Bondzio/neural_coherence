<s> After years of great performance, my laptop has suddenly given out on me. </s>
<s> One day my wifi was working and the next day, after a shut down and reboot, it stopped working. </s>
<s> I have the latest driver and management software for my Intel wireless wifi link 4965AGN; and while it sees all the networks and connects, I cannot get online. </s>
<s> I checked everything I could think of and finally think I have the problem. </s>
<s> The ping test fails every time. </s>
<s> Any help on how to fix this would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> Also, the machine is a Sony Vaio AR520E running Vista Home Premium SP2. </s>
<s> Ok 2 things to need to check, 1st when your connected make sure you have a valid ip, by doing ipconfig (from the run box type &quot;cmd /k ipconfig&quot;)you will need to check with another machine on your network what ip your router uses it should look something like this Connection-specific DNS Suffix . </s>
