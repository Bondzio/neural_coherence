you can't tell what areas are free of copper traces just by looking at the surface of the motherboard.
re-read the last post.
motherboards are multilayer printed wiring boards, six or eight layers or more.
just because you see an area with no traces or just a large ground plane doesn't mean there isn't wiring underneath in the inner layers.
unless you have x-ray vision, don't do this.
