having used the ibm\hitachi drive fitness test to fix a number of drives (actually ibm drives in the past) the one focus of fixing is achieved with free software.
spinrite is undoubtably better in that it can be a data recovery tool as well.
but the cost is us$89.00, to repair a drive is more than a replacement drive for some people.
but it is cheap for data recovery.
a good combination if you need it.
