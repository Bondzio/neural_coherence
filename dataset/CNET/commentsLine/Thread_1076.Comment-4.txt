what i've done in the past, as a last resort, was to replace the disk controller card that is attached to the back of the hard disk drive, with an exact copy from another functioning drive (same model number and same spec).
controllers are attached by connectors and are generally not soldered in place.
but first, i'd try all the software solutions mentioned above, until i was comfortable knowing that none of them worked.
then i'd freeze the drive in the deep freeze over night and try again before the drive warmed up.
hdd controller replacement may not work for the following reasons.
1 spindle motor is toast, r/w head is toast, r/w head impacted (crashed) onto the platter.
r/w preamp interface chip is toast, r/w head has stick-tion, data is corrupted.
also be aware that you may brick the good working hdd, if your not careful (static discharge is a bad thing).
in 30 years in the enterprise computer industry, i've seen just about every failure possible, and in some case recovery is impossible.
i've even seen cases of the oxide scraped off and the bare glass platter was see through.
good luck
