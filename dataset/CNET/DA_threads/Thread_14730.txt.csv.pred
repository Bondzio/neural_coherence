1.1.1	This is what I have : ZV524OUS HP laptop 512 RAM 60 GIG 128 MG graphic CD/DVD combo burn CD not DVD 802.11G internal wireless 150 XGA 15.4 HI-DEF Widescreen Battery continuous for 3 hours HP PSC 2410 Photosmart all-in-one printer fax scanner copier RCA Modem for Road Runner - modem for Road Runner Netgear wireless router Model : MR814v2 3 more openings available - wireless router Vonage : Linksys Broadband Router with 2 phone ports - allows me to have Vonage VoiceIP Logitech wireless mouse Webcam ( not installed yet ) I want to be able to use the printer wirelessly , so I am thinking of getting LINKSYS WIRELESS-G PrintServer .	St
1.1.2	Does anyone know if there is a better solution ?	Ques
1.1.3	Yes , I HATE wires !	St
1.1.4	: ) And I want to be hooked up to my computer AND printer , anywhere in my house .	St
1.1.5	THANKS !	St
1.2.1	http : //www.linksys.com/linksys_solutions_home.asp	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the link .	St
1.3.2	I purchased a Linksys Print Server recommended to me at Best Buy .	St
1.3.3	After hours on the phone with Linksys , they tell me that contrary to what Best Buy told me , I can not use the Print Server on a Multi Function Printer .	St
1.3.4	Even if they could help me get it working , to use their product , they tell me I 'd have to plug and unplug the print server when I want to use anything other than the printer .	St
1.4.1	Unfortunately , these fancy-dancy multifunction printers can not be attached to a print server and still retain any functions except plain ol ' printing .	St
1.4.2	Sorry .	St
1.4.3	If you want those extra functions , they only work when the device is connected directly to a host computer .	St
1.4.4	dw	St
1.5.1	Unfortunately , the only solution that I can think of would be to buy the later model HP PSC multifunction printer which has a wireless card and would allow me to print remotely .	St
1.5.2	But since my current printer isn ; t that old and I love it , I ca n't see spending $ 359 for the later model .	St
1.5.3	Thanks all who wrote here .	St
1.6.1	is reported to have lots of problems .	St
1.6.2	Perhaps they are getting better , but still not ready for prime time .	St
1.6.3	That said , if you have a network and use different machines in various places around the house , printers on a server sure is a good idea .	St
1.6.4	You do n't have to leave the host machine on just to use the printer .	St
1.6.5	You do n't need a printer for every machine .	St
1.6.6	In your case , perhaps you might leave the multifunction printer hooked up to a host computer for those times when you need all its features or capacity , but get a small quick printer that can sit out there somewhere on a print server for just when its needed .	Sug
1.6.7	dw	St
1.7.1	Emabarassing to say - I have no network , just one laptop , this is for home , and I just wanted the convienience of being anywhere and hitting print .	St
1.7.2	Thanks .	Polite
1.7.3	I can stop obsessing on this and now start trying to figure out why Windows Taks Manager says I have 60 processes running !	St
1.7.4	( I think a higher priority problem : ) )	St
