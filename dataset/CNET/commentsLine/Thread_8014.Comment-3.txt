i worked on this problem for hours until i decided to do a system restore to an earlier point.
that re-set whatever was wrong so i was able to connect again, however different problems arose with my internet connection.
but now it seems to be working ok. so i'll go forward from this point.
i just wish i knew what was wrong so i could have fixed it myself.
