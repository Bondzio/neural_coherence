<s> I have win98SE.My computer stopped recpgnising my USB scanner.The scanner is a tiny that came with the computer.I have checked all the connections several times and unloaded and reloaded the software several times.I have switched USB ports to check for a good connection to no avail.All I can get is a message saying to check my connections and make sure the USB port is active because it cannot find the device. </s>
<s> I have done all I know to do, any suggestions.I have not changed anything on the computer with the exception of going from dialup to DSL. </s>
<s> Hope it is something like that. </s>
<s> Starting to sound like the scanner. </s>
<s> Have you tried it on another machine? </s>

<s> Still sounds like the USB connections on the scanner or your port. </s>
<s> This may sound really dumb, but have you tried dipping your USB cables into soda water? </s>
<s> Cleans a lot of crap from your eyeglasses also. </s>
<s> Let the cables dry for a day and reinstall the cables. </s>
<s> About six months ago someone else had the identical problem. </s>
<s> Can't remember the exact fix, yet the problem was with the USB cables. </s>
<s> Isn't there an electronic cleaner used on this stuff also from Radio Shack?? </s>
<s> Let us know. </s>

<s> Rubbing alcohol is kinder to electronics than anything water-based. </s>
<s> When I worked for a paging service we would tell the doctors who always managed to drop their pagers in the toliet (and it happened at least once a week.) </s>
<s> to immediately immerse the pager in rubbing alcohol, leave it there, and bring it in the next day. </s>
<s> These pagers usually could be saved. </s>
<s> This was back when an alpha pager was several hundred dollars.... </s>
<s> Funny post to read about the doctors and the toilets. </s>
<s> Rubbing alcohol and Q-Tips is an answer that works for me. </s>
<s> Still want to know about an electronics cleaner. </s>
<s> Originally, I thought about the USB cables. </s>
<s> Do you think the problem with the scanner is with the cables or with maybe the way to find the scanner software from Photoshop? </s>
<s> Each scanner has an aquire avenue to find the scanner software. </s>
<s> Wonder if that is the problem? </s>
<s> I was using a new scanner at work and I went to Twain Acquire by mistake. </s>
<s> Received an error message: Scanner cannot be found. </s>
<s> Went to click on the Canon software and got the scanner. </s>
<s> May be the problem? </s>

<s> USB cable. </s>
<s> Cables are cheaper than scanners. </s>
<s> You should have at least 1 spare anyway, for just this reason. </s>
<s> Get USB 2.0, they are backward compatible with USB1.1. </s>
<s> chuck </s>
<s> Taxiguy51, I have no idea what scanner hardware or software you are using. </s>
<s> Have you checked out your manual again? </s>
<s> I really do not think it a problem with the USB cables. </s>
<s> If I accidently, from acquire through Photoshop, click on the wrong software for the scanner, I receive a screen error message, saying that the scanner cannot be found. </s>
<s> Check all cables to the scanner. </s>
<s> That sounds like a problem with the software or choosing the wrong access to your scanner. </s>
<s> Do you accsess your scanner from the scanner or do you access it using software, or going through Photoshop? </s>
<s> Setting up scanner software again is a pain. </s>
<s> Want to try it one more time? </s>
