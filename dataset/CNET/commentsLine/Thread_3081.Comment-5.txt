ok i know this is gonna sound incredibly stupid but i just have to check, are you using a crossover network cable between your 2 computers, because the network will never run with a straight through, straight through cords are almost always blue, crossover is another colour.
if your network cable is blue stop trying to get your network to work and go out and buy a cross over network cable, then try and get it running if that aint the problem (which i'm guessing it aint) then you going to need to perform a little trick with 98 driver installation, when you try to install your drivers note down what file it's asking for, just the name and it's extension, now get a good ol floppy disk and stick it in your a: drive, then use search to find the driver file on your installation cd's and/or windows on your hard drive, now when it's found that file copy and paste it onto your floppy, try to install the driver again and tell it to look on the floppy... hey presto, you've got a driver installed this problem occurs because 98's driver installation doesn't search deeply into sub folders to find the driver so by chucking it onto the floppy even the most stupid program can find the driver hope this solves your problem
