i have been trying to install a second western digital external hard drive in xp home edition and had the same problem.
i finally got it to recognize it by changing the drive letter to a letter before the first drives letter.
then i turned off both drives uninstalled the software,rebooted, reinstalled software, rebooted turned on the drives and my computer recognized it finally.
to do this right click on my computer,right click on manage,right click on disk management, expand page so you can see everything and right click on the drive you want to change letter.
