I would like to install windows 2003 server on it. But system won't let me delete the partition. A message comes up &quot;Unable to delete partition having system files&quot;. I can install 2003 server on another partition but the aplication which I want to install on 2003 server has script which requires 2003 server to be installed on C drive. It is not even letting me change the drive letter from &quot;C&quot; to any other letter- message- &quot;Can't change bootable drive&quot;. Any way out? Please... Thanks
