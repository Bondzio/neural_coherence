hi there, i've got a friend with a generic pc put together with heaven knows what (no brand names).
he said it was working just fine, then one day stopped.
it looks to me like the pc just isn't booting up.
when you turn on the power, the hard drive light comes on for about 30 seconds or so, then nothing.
it doesn't sound like it's going through any post or any kind of startup and there's no signal to the monitor.
what are the most common causes of this kind of problem and what should i be checking?
thanks to everyone/anyone in advance for their replies and advice.
regards, --- gary
