<s> I am being forced to buy a new desktop due to my roomate recently moving out. </s>
<s> He plans to pick up his pc this weekend, and I don't know how long I can go with out access to the web. </s>
<s> I'm addicted. </s>
<s> Seriously though I need some advice on the right system for me. </s>
<s> What I know about computers, I have learned on the web and from a few magazines I have read recently. </s>
<s> I do have a basic understanding of the internal components of a pc, and what each of them do. </s>
<s> But, by no means, am I a computer &quot;pro&quot;. </s>
<s> I will be mainly using the pc for surfing the web, storing & printing my pics, downloading/burning music, and burning DVD's would be cool too. </s>
<s> I don't play games on the computer. </s>
<s> That is what my PS2 is for. </s>
<s> I thought that a media center would be a good fit for me (I'm a long time home theater buff), but from what I've read, picture quality is lacking. </s>
<s> So I plan to keep my new pc separate from my A/V setup for now. </s>
<s> What I'm looking for is a reliable computer without all of the extra stuff I don't need. </s>
<s> That could be upgraded in the future if I want. </s>
<s> I thought that a package from one of the big manufacturers would be good for me. </s>
<s> However from what reviews I have read it doesn't seem that they are all that trouble free. </s>
<s> It seems that even though most of these systems have some sort of tech support. </s>
<s> Dealing with these folks is a less than desireable event. </s>
<s> As far as a budget, I would like to stay under $1k. </s>
<s> Please give me some insight on your experiences with what you think would be a problem free setup. </s>
<s> Try ibuypower, tiger direct, american computech </s>
<s> have tech support here in the USA? </s>
<s> These seem to be stores, not manufacturers. </s>

<s> Also &quot;OEM&quot; parts come with no paperwork. </s>
<s> Hope this Helps... </s>
