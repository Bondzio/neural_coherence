<s> HP pavillion 540n Power supply fan is (intermittent) noisy (high pitch resonance) What can we do about it ? </s>
<s> Leo </s>
<s> Buy a replacement power supply, that's really the only option normally available in these cases. </s>
<s> if its just dirty clean fan, ive done that find a mom pop shop get a bad power supply replace fan </s>
<s> Replace the fan, of course. </s>
<s> However, replacing the fan maybe 1/2 of the problem as prolonged operation of an intermit fan causes &quot;stress&quot; on the p/s componets and there's a 50/50 chance it will fail entirely. </s>
<s> While, the replacing the fan makes sense, replacing the p/s is a more practical solution besides a new p/s plus the included fan, you have a chance to increase the wattage of p/s if available. </s>
<s> The choice is yours. </s>
<s> The fan size is usually 80 or 90mm in size or 3-4in.. good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> I have a HP pavillion 8700 also with a noisy fan. </s>
<s> You talked of a powersupply fan. </s>
<s> Is there more than one fan inside? </s>
<s> It sounds like your power supply fan is just beginning to go. </s>
<s> If you replace it now now chances are your power supply is fine because the rpms on the fan haven't dropped too much. </s>
<s> There is only one fan, but trying to find a replacement and putting one in can be more trouble than just replacing the powersupply. </s>
