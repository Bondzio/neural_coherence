You only tell about wireless. - What exactly is &quot;reinstalling the computer&quot;? -] What happens if you try to &quot;connect to the Internet&quot; and how do you do that? For example, can you ping a website? - What OS on this desktop? Windows 95? Linux? Speaking of Linux, does it work if you boot from a Linux Live disk? - Now take that same uncooperative desktop to another location (friend or family). Does it work there wired? Wireless? Kees
