This is happening on all my laptops in the buliding, over a dozen.
I need to keep static IP's due to my process scope.
pinging the IP's all timeout as soon as I turn off the laptops so there is nothing on that IP.
Any other sugestions?
I will tighten up and change security and see if this helps but I am only seeing my computers on my Domain with no other traffic.
Thanks
