1.11.1	The performance of the cards are very close and I think the X850 XT has a narrow lead over the 6800 .	St
1.11.2	I would get the 6800 ultra because it supports shader model 3.0 .	St
1.11.3	Just make sure you have TWO power connectors handy .	St
1.11.4	If you do n't then the 6800 GT would be my next choice , which only needs one .	St
1.11.5	The card takes up 2 slots in the case .	St
1.12.1	Thank you to everyone that helped me make my decision .	St
1.12.2	I am going to purchase the 6800 Ultra .	St
