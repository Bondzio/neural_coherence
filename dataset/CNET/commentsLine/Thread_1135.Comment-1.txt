i bought this hard drive to back up my family's 8 years worth of photos for safe keeping.
only 3 days later the drive crashed.
i've contacted toshiba and no matter what, they wont stand behind their product.
below are the responses i get from them... hello, unfortunately, i cannot help you on this matter.
please contact my supervisor for any concerns.
sholeen chaudhary toshiba oa dept supervisor schaudhary@pcs-sj.com (510)651-6798 dear customer, toshiba is not liable for any loss data.
you will need to take it to a data recovery center to have your data removed.
regards, sholeen chaudhary toshiba oa dept supervisor schaudhary@pcs-sj.com (510)651-6798 i understand their &quot;liability&quot; issue...all i'm asking them is for some help.
i have no back ups.
i have no other way to retrieve these pictures.
i have my baby's photos, christmas's, soccer games, everything...i don't know what else to do.
i don't have the money to take it to a recoverey center.
i just want my pictures back.
i wish i would have backed them up on cds or something, but i thought an external drive would work best...man was i mistaken.
i've tried everything...any advice from anyone??
i will never buy another toshiba product again.
if i can steer one person away from them as well, so be it.
what happen to customer service?
