well i had an idea, i changed the ide ribbon (it was pretty creased and bent up) and it started right up.
i never tought that could be what it was, i didnt think the ide was that sensitive, but... if anyone could let me know why this had an effect on the cpu not booting up id appreciate it.
thanks.
