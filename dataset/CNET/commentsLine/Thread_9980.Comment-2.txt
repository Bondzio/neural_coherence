i currently have a pinnacle moviebox and i must say i am not too happy with it.
i used it to import vhs video onto my computer, but i found that even with a good spec on my system the sound wasn't matching up right.
perhaps they have improved the moviebox with the &quot;plus&quot; version but i would suggest looking through some forums and reviews on it before you make the purchase.
now i have since built a new system that is more than suitable for editing video but i may just dub vhs tapes using a dvd recorder, then import them into the computer from the dvds.
that route may work better in terms of preserving the overall quality of the picture + the sound if you have a dvd player that records.
i'm unfamiliar with other brands or alternative methods beyond that discussed here so far, but hopefully your set-up works out.
i suppose if you're able to return the product after it's been opened you can always just take it for a test run.
if you are set on the moviebox though i heard the &quot;plus&quot; isn't that much different technologically for transferring vhs video into digital than the regular version, but you're probably better off with it anyway since we're probably all suckers for &quot;later models.&quot;
