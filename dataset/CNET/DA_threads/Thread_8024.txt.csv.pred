1.1.1	Hello , Was just wondering if anyone knew how I can have a wireless network set up with mutliple access points but only show up as one wireless network from any PC that wishes to connect to them ?	Ques
1.1.2	Does it require a specific type/model access point , if so can anyone recommend any ?	Ques
1.1.3	Cheers for any help	St
1.2.1	Every access point has a unique SSID and will be shown as such in the client .	St
1.2.2	But I might be totally wrong , and would appreciate to be educated by anyone knowing the right details .	St
1.2.3	Kees	St
1.3.1	so there is no way to get them to show up as one wireless network instead of multiple access points ?	Ques
1.4.1	But I 'm waiting to be corrected .	St
1.4.2	Can you tell more about the circumstances ?	Ques
1.4.3	This is unlikely to be a requirement in a normal home environment , like you and me live in .	St
1.4.4	So I assume it 's some business , and then of course , we 're talking professional stuff like cingular and t-mobile have for their WiFi offerings , and that might make a difference .	St
1.4.5	Kees	St
1.5.1	its for a school , just for ease of use by users really	St
1.6.1	You name the WAPs in some fashion like ... SCL01 SCL02 SCL03 This way if one is n't working well they can report it .	St
1.6.2	If you did name all the WAPs the same ( which is not a good idea ... ) you could be shot or hanged by the people who have to maintain the system .	St

1.7.1	I ca n't say for sure what all is out there that will do this , but I know Cisco 's wireless products will do exactly what you are after .	St
1.7.2	They are actually pretty nice .	St
1.7.3	A user can log in anywhere , and roam anywhere around the building/campus ( where they can get a signal ) and the signal will automatically move AP to AP with the best signal with no loss in connectivity .	St
1.7.4	Of course you will pay a premium for Cisco equipment .	St
1.7.5	There may be cheaper solutions out there .	St
1.7.6	Depending on the scope and topology of your network , you maybe able to accomplish this using wireless bridges instead of AP 's .	St
1.8.1	1 .	St
1.8.2	The AP has a connection limit .	St
1.8.3	( brick wall issue ) 2 .	St
1.8.4	All users get to share the single airspace 's speed .	St
1.8.5	( slow bus to nowhere issue ) 3 .	St
1.8.6	If you allow 802.11b connections ... ( let 's go real slow ) For a public solution it 's best to not entertain that .	St
