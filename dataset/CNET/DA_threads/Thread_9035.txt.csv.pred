1.1.1	System: Dual monitors (before, 2 CRT, now 1 LCD, 1 CRT) Windows XP Before I took my PC to shop, system monitors were going to sleep 10 minutes after boot up.	St
1.1.2	At shop, both screens working without going to sleep.	St
1.1.3	When I brought back home, unpacked new LCD monitor, cabled both monitors to machine, booted up, both went to sleep at first within a few minutes, now they're both going to sleep at boot up.	St
1.1.4	Graphics card was replaced, so this is not the problem.	St
1.1.5	Please help, this is my business and I am losing money.	St
1.2.1	Thats not a good sign.	St
1.2.2	Since you don't see the BIOS, Windows booting or even a beep (not noted in your post) the machine has likely failed.	St
1.2.3	Nothing in your post tells me that its not the machine.	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	What I don't understand is why the system works at the shop but not at home.	St
1.3.2	I've even tried plugging various parts of the system into the wall directly, bypassing the surge protector, to no avail.	St
1.4.1	That's the rub.	St
1.4.2	Your AC cord could be bad, the machine could be on its side at home, upright at shop.	St
1.4.3	Etc.	St
1.4.4	As it stands, as described, it's a dead PC.	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
1.5.1	Time to ask for a house call.	St
