i have a ikon tec computer that has a gigabyte ga-7vax motherboard, amd xp 2200 512 ddr memory, radeon 9000 pro 64meg video card.
it just went black while playing a game and when trying to reboot the fans kick in but i get nothing on the screen.
the monitor is ok no error messages just nothing.
i tried a different video card and still nothing.
hooked the hard drive to another computer to rescue the data and the hard drive seems fine.
could it be the motherboard or the proccesor?
trying to figure out were to start.
