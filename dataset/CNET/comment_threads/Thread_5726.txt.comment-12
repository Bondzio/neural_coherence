I have a Nvidia GeForce 6150SE nForce 430 with an AMD Athlon(tm) II X2 240 Processor, 2800 Mhz.
I am running on a Windows 7 Home Premium with 4 gigabytes of ram or memory(always get something there mixed up).I am roughly 16 and play many videogames that require a strong graphics card.
I mostly play command and conquer games like Red Alert 3 or C&C 3.
Both games require a graphics card such as a NVIDIA GeForce 6800 or better.
Now i was hoping that someone somewhere could help me find one that isnt too expensive.
I am going to get a job because my father refuses to get me one.
So any assistance would be greatly appreciated.
