1.1.2	?	Ques
1.2.1	Logic says there is something wrong with that adapter.	St
1.2.2	Try your friends again just to confirm.	St
1.2.3	If that adapter works and yours still does not, perhaps you can exchange it for another one.	St
1.2.4	Here's where a DVM would come in real handy though.	St
1.3.1	Isnt that an adapter for the power?	St
1.3.2	So its obviously not getting power.	St
1.3.3	Make sure the 4 pin molex is plugged all the way and that the wholes are lined up.	St
1.3.4	And that the sata end is plugged in all the way too.	St
1.3.5	Or just try another adapter	Sug
