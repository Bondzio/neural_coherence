1.1.1	I spoke about this earlier in connection with instability in my system .	St
1.1.2	System.ini Network Card Tweak The following tweak is not documented by Microsoft , and it is controversial whether it works at all .	St
1.1.3	We have tested numerous times and it shows anywhere between 0 and 10 % performance gain , which we consider inconclusive .	St
1.1.4	We have received over 100 responses saying this tweak worked great , and over 100 saying it does nothing at all .	St
1.1.5	At this time , we feel we should leave the information posted on the site in order to present our readers with all possible options for optimizing their throughput , however keep in mind we have n't been able to find a proof of the validity of this particular tweak , and are not fully confident in the following information .	Sug
1.1.6	Feel free to send us mail with your feedback .	Sug
1.1.7	With all that said , it will not degrade performance of your system , and if you 're willing to try and see how it works , here are the instructions : In Windows 9x , you might be able to reserve specific amounts of RAM for specific IRQs ( Interrupt Requests ) , which serves as a buffer to allow more stable operation of your device .	St
1.1.8	Adding a 4Mb buffer to your Network Card 's IRQ would ensure good overall performance and increase throughput with broadband Internet connections , such as DSL and Cable Modems .	St
1.1.9	Reserving RAM for your Network Adapter might prove very useful , especially during CPU intensive tasks , or while gaming online .	St
1.1.10	For those with 500MHz or slower processors and 128Mb or less RAM , this tweak might show noticeable results at all times , including faster displaying of web pages and higher throughput .	St
1.1.11	Even with fast processors you will get better overall performance , including smoother stream video , better transfers anywhere from 0 to 10 % , with more noticeable results during faster transfers .	St
1.1.12	Another good reason for using this tweak would be if you have a PCI NIC sharing IRQs with another device .	St
1.1.13	Step 1 - Find your Network Card 's IRQ In order to add the entry to your System.ini file , you 'd first have to find your NIC 's IRQ .	St
1.1.14	Right-click on My Computer icon on your Desktop , then left-click on Properties ( a shortcut for that would be to press the 'Windows ' + 'Pause ' keys ) .	St
1.1.15	Navigate to Device Manager and double-click on Computer .	St
1.1.16	Under & quot ; View Resources & quot ; you will find a list of IRQs , each with description of the device that 's using it .	St
1.1.17	Note the IRQ number used by your Network Adapter .	St
1.1.18	Fig .	St
1.1.19	1.1 - Device Manager ( 'Window ' + 'Pause ' keys ) Fig .	St
1.1.20	1.2 - Finding the IRQ of your NIC Step 2 - Adding the entry to System.ini Once you 've found the IRQ of your Network Card , you need to reserve some RAM for its use , by adding an entry to the System.ini file .	St
1.1.21	You can edit the file in any text editor , however the easiest way is to use Windows ' built in & quot ; System Configuration Editor & quot ; .	St
1.1.22	Navigate to Start & gt ; Run and type sysedit .	St
1.1.23	Find the [ 386enh ] Section in the System.ini file and add Irq [ n ] =4096 under it , where [ n ] is the IRQ number of your NIC and 4096 is the amount of RAM you want to reserve in Kbytes .	St
1.1.24	We recommend using 4096 , however you can experiment with different values if you want .	St
1.1.25	Save changes in the file , exit and reboot for changes to take effect .	St
1.1.26	Note : If you choose to try different values , keep in mind that reserving too much RAM for your NIC will decrease the amount of RAM available for applications , while reserving too little might not give the desired effect .	St
1.1.27	Fig .	St
1.1.28	2.1 - Editing System.ini Additional Thoughts The only negative effect of the System.ini IRQ tweak is that it will reduce the amount of RAM available for running applications a bit , by reserving some specifically for your Network Card 's use .	St
1.1.29	The gain in performance usually outweighs the negative effect by far , considering any Computer with 32Mb of RAM or more .	St
1.1.30	Keep in mind that if you add hardware to your system the IRQ of the Network Adapter might change , in which case you will need to modify the setting in System.ini .	St
1.1.31	In systems with multiple NICs , you might want to add the setting for both IRQs .	St
1.1.32	Also , you could reserve RAM for other IRQs if you wish , just use common sense and do n't forget it reduces the amount of RAM available for running applications .	Sug
1.1.33	If you are using an USB device , it does not have a specific IRQ , however you can try adding the entry using the IRQ of the USB Controller .	St
1.1.34	For internal Cable Modems , you 'd have to add the entry using the IRQ of your modem , rather than the IRQ of a Network Card .	St
1.1.35	I think what I was asking was if anyone was aware of an equivelant method for XP as I believe this article is very old .	St
1.1.36	This was copy pasted from a page I saved a long time ago and can not find the article on speedguide.net anymore .	St
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	Windows Resource Kits .	St
1.3.2	But just like the tweaks that we used for DOS , when we move from a DOS based Windows to a non-DOS based Windows these old & quot ; HACKS ! & quot ; vanish .	St
