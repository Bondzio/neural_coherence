<s> Dear Sir/Madam, I have two hard drives in my computer, one is using Chinese Windows 98 and other is English Windows 98 SE. </s>
<s> Before I can use the CD-W and CD-Rom in the Chinese Windows 98 but after I installed the other hard drives used the Englsih Windows 98 SE, I only can use the CD-R and CD-rom in the new hard drives for windows 98 SE. </s>
<s> When I try to use the CD-r and CD-rom in the old hard drive, it said missing the Win APSI files. </s>
<s> Can somebody help me? </s>
