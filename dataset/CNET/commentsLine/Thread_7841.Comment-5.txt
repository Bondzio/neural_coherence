7300 gt i believe (i'm at home now so i'm not 100% sure about this one, its 7300 for sure, not sure about the gt) as for hdd, the master is a 250gb wd sata2, and the slave is an ide (160gb wd) drive with a adapter thing to convert to sata (even though i don't like this, he's stuck with it until he can afford a sata drive...soon) 2 opticals are dvd burners, ide, using the 1 ide connector the mobo has.
