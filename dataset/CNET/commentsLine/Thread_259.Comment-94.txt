because i'm taking off work tomorrow (friday) to finally install a new hard drive, one a bit larger than the one in it now, and plan to make the current hard drive the backup or slave.
i've spent the last few hours copying important files to the cd drive that will accept them.
i know it might be a bad idea to try to solve a computer problem on friday the 13th, but i've put it off longer than i should, so, if you or my other buddy in this saga, ted, is around and i can get back on the internet, i'd be happy to let you give me a hand.
i say, &quot;if i can get back on the internet&quot; because i figure i could botch the whole process, although i've done it for other people just fine, but i've never tried to move this much stuff from one internal drive to another.
i'm going to attack it in the morning.
advice is always welcome.
too many cooks might spoil the broth, but there can never be too many brains on a computer job unless you want to repeat some of the unfortunate messages generated early on in this overly long thread in which i was told i wasn't asking the right questions, he didn't answer &quot;easys&quot; and i was asking someone else to do my work for me.
the question was and always has been, what's the best way to go about correcting the windows problem without losing valued files and software.
i had hoped there was an internal version of something like pc relocator, but alas, i don't think there is, so i'm going to take the beast apart, swap out the main hard drive, install windows on it and see where that takes me.
again, i look forward to any well-meaning help and i'll be in touch, no matter what happens to this beast on friday 13. iow, i'll let you know, even if i'm successful.
thanks, ann
