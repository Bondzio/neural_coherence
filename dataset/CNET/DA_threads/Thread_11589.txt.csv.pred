1.1.1	Hi I have 2 monitors , 1st one shut down mos ago , did'nt know why , the plug that goes into the video card the 1 of the pins looks broken , bigger the other pins , is this monitor shot , or can I go inside and replace that cord .	St
1.1.2	the other monitor it started with the screen going half the size , now all I get is a line on the top , I can see just a little , I worked on the controls for days , and it wo n't come back to normal is this one shot also I hope not I hope you can give me good news , but otherwise lol , I 'll take the bad as well Thanks	St
1.2.1	It can be the monitor or video card but most likely is the monitor itself .	St
1.2.2	The only way to rule out the card is with a known good monitor , however .	St
1.2.3	If you are certain the problem is a broken pin on a connector , it is possible to replace the cord but it depends on your comfort level and related expertise with electronics .	St
1.2.4	I have replaced a cord but few here would recommend it as you will be in the proximity of a very high electrical charge on the envelope of the CRT .	St
1.2.5	You will need to know about wire stripping , splicing and have good soldering skills .	St
1.2.6	You will need to be resourceful in finding a proper replacement cord .	St
1.2.7	An extension cable might work but may not be the best quality or properly shielded .	St
1.2.8	You will need to know the pin outs ( which pin/wire carries which signal ) or have access to and know how to use an ohmmeter or DVM to make sure the rewiring is done correctly .	St
1.2.9	It 's not the same as replacing an AC cord by any means but can be done .	St
1.2.10	I doubt this offers much encouragement but hope it answers some of your questions .	St
1.2.11	Good luck .	Polite
1.3.1	thanks , the one with the broken pin I 'll give the monitor to someone they can fix it , I build my own pcs myself ( I 'm no Tech LOL ) but never worked on a monitor wo n't either .	St
1.3.2	I have several video cards and I tried all of them specially with the monitor that shows something on top of monitor screen , so is this one out of order also , it sounds like it , their both several years old , thanks again I 've read up on working inside a monitor I wo n't go inside too risky thanks again	St
1.4.1	They cost too much to repair , and too dangerous to tinker with .	St
1.4.2	If money is tight , then find a repair shop that sells used working monitors , or read the classified ads in local newspapers .	St
1.5.1	http : //www.monitorworld.com/faq_pages/q17_page.html shows you what signal is on each pin .	St
1.5.2	It 's fair for me to write that wiring up a VGA connector is beyond your average technician or they do n't have the equipment or patience .	St
1.5.3	Not to mention the cost involved .	St
1.5.4	If you examine the pin out carefully you may see that pin 15 may not exist on some monitors ( some may write it 's broken ! )	St
1.5.5	And some systems did n't use all the grounds ( a bad idea in my playbook . )	St
1.5.6	As to the screen that shrank to 1/2 the size an dnow is a solid horizontal line , that is a classic failure a TV technician will know about .	St
1.5.7	BUT is not repairable by consumers .	St
1.5.8	In closing , LETHAL and FATAL voltages are inside such devices even after the unit has been unplugged for more than a year .	St
1.5.9	Do n't open it .	St
1.5.10	Bob	St
1.6.1	Get new monitors bro .	St
1.6.2	They 're most likely gone , and it 's not worth it to repair them .	St
1.6.3	You can buy new ones for the price you 'd spend repairing them , and they may not repair them .	St
1.6.4	Search http : //www.pricewatch.com or http : //www.froogle.com for the best prices .	Ques
