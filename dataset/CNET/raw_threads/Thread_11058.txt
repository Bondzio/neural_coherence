The MX610 has several buttons on it (volume up/down/mute, forward/back, email, IM, scrollwheel) and everything works when i click it but for some reason the lights on the email and IM buttons never light up. they're supposed to light up when i have mail or an IM, but they dont. i know this sounds dumb but i was just wondering if anyone has had this problem or knows how to fix it. I reinstalled Setpoint several times and have messed with the settings as well. I cant find any threads on the logitech site about it so i dont know what to do. it says the batteries are good and everything seems to be working except for the lights. any help? thanks in advance. -zak- -Set Up- Intel Core 2 Duo E6300 @ 2.2 GHz Overclocked 2 GB (2 X 1 GB) DDR2 RAM Overclocked Nvidia Geforce 7600 GT SLI 256 MB GDDR Creative Labs X-Fi Extreme Gamer Microsoft Windows XP Home
