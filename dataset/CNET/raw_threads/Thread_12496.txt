The text has turned to lines and broken letters. It frequently does not print at all but feeds the paper through at the same rate as if printing. Its a bit like the ink is not reaching the page at all. Any ideas how to cure this? Mike

Try the usual print head alignment and cleaning and installng a new cartridge usually works. Also could be dried ink, air bubble in cartridge or cartridge became dried out before filling
