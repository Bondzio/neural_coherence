Most will work fine on the PC with USB 2.0, very few will run on USB 1.1. &quot;i also need an external hardrive which i can connect directly to a television cause primarily im gonna use the hardrive to store my home videos&quot; Good luck finding that.

My externals are more of the 200+GB size with 7200RPM drives and quite nice at about 1/2 the dollar. But my don't connect to the TV. The item they won't tell you in this review is that the Video Encoding may be quite inefficient. Let's take it that it's about the same as your DVD. That gives this 80GB drive at most 17 movies. Seems like a bad deal to me. I'll share I use something along the same lines, which is the Dlink Media Center. No hard disk and plays movies, music and such. It's not perfect so read the reviews. Bob

I don't know if this is an option to you, but I plan to buy a 200 Gb high RPM internal HD, place it in an enclosure, and use the USB 2.0 connection from the enclosure as the connector. You'll save a bundle (assuming you're not looking for a highly mobile HD; this is more of a 'stays in the house' external HD, I think)
