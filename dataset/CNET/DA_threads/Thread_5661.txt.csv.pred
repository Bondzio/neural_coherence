1.1.1	Hello !	St
1.1.2	First of all , a rundown of all that is currently in my PC : - AMD Athlon 64 2800+ ( Processor ) - DFI LANParty UT ( Motherboard ) - ATI Fire GL-X1 ( AGP 8X Video Card ) - LG GSA-4040B ( 4X DVD Burner ) - Antec SL350 ( 350W Power Supply ) - Zalman CNPS7700-ALCU ( CPU Cooler ) - Infineon DDR400 512MB ( 256MB x 2 ) ( RAM ) - & lt ; i & gt ; HP NetRaid 1si ( 80-pin RAID Controller ) & lt ; /i & gt ; - & lt ; i & gt ; IBM 18GB 68-pin SCSI ( Hard Drive x 2 ) & lt ; /i & gt ; - & lt ; i & gt ; SCSI Cable , 80-pin with terminator & lt ; /i & gt ; - & lt ; i & gt ; 80 to 68-pin conversion attachment , on both hard drives & lt ; /i & gt ; I am nearly ready to go with my new PC , but I 've come across one hurdle - setting up my SCSI hard disks .	St
1.1.3	I have two IBM 18GB hard drives ( identical , expect one was manufactured slightly more recently ) , connected to two 80 to 68-pin adapters .	St
1.1.4	The drives and the adapters both work , because the power from the power supply is routed through the adapters and into the hard drives , and the hard drives power on at boot .	St
1.1.5	The RAID controller works , because I can access it 's BIOS at boot .	St
1.1.6	However , the NetRAID does not recognize that any physical drives are present .	St
1.1.7	This is my dilemma ... .. All jumpers seem to be in proper place ( one at ID1 and one at ID2 , plus a jumper on Auto Power ON on both drives ) .	St
1.1.8	I 'm really dying to find out what is wrong !	St
1.1.9	Please help ! ! ! ! ! !	St
1.1.10	-Robbie	St
1.2.1	You give a good run down on your hardware , Robbie , but you do not mention your OS .	St
1.2.2	Do you have the latest drivers for that OS properly installed ?	Ques
1.2.3	You can check out troubleshooting and available drivers for different operating systems for your NetRaid 1si controller at this HP site .	St
1.2.4	Hope this helps Frank	St
1.3.1	It turns out that the SCSI cable I was using was for & quot ; LVD & quot ; devices and not & quot ; SE & quot ; , which is what I needed .	St
1.3.2	Hopefully this was what was keeping me from getting things done , but I have to now wait for the cable to arrive in the mail ( these 68-pin SE SCSI cables cost $ 60 or more locally , and $ 15 online ! ) .	St
1.3.3	The OS I plan to use is SUSE Linux , but without these drives working , I ca n't install it .	St
1.3.4	Thanks Frank , Robbie	St
