ATI cards are fast, but lack the technology support by nvidia such as FP3.0 i think and others, which would render these cards useless in the coming years.
ATI wants you to keep upgrading and buying their cards along with intel, they changed their socket to not be able to upgrade to dual-core.
No wonder ati and intel are basically partners when you build a system.
That's why gamers buy amd, which allows you to upgrade, and nvidia.
By all means, if you want brute force, get the intel and ati, but for the future and compatibility and the fastest game experience, but not the best for encoding,etc.
get amd and nvidia.
