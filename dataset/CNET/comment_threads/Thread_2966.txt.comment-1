I have a ASRock motherboard, K7S41GX motherboard with two 256 MB DDR memory modules installed (512 MB) in total.
I recently purchased a 512 MB DDR (3200/2700 PC400/333 184 Pin DIMM) and tried installing this today with one of the 256 MB DDR also - to get 768 MB in total.
When I tried booting my system, I did get the 768 MB on the &quot;splash&quot; screen, but it never booted to Windows XP.
From attempting some different settings in the BIOS setup I was able to get to the Windows XP splash screen, but Windows XP did not load at all.
When I remove the 512 MB DDR card my system boots fine and right into Windows XP.
I need some help on this one, as from what I can find the 512 MB DDR memory is compatible with the system.
Thank you in advance for your assistance.
