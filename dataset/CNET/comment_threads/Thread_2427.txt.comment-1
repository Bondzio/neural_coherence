I am running a wireless router and am wondering if I can also use a wireless keyboard and mouse.
Will I run into frequency problems if I have to many wireless items on my computers?
Does anyone know if this is a problem?
I would like to add a wireless keyboard and mouse to both computers in the house, but am not sure if this is even possible with the wireless router.
