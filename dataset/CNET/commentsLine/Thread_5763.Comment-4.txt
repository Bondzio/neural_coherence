if you had such at a shop, they could try it, but given the age of the machine, a waiver would be signed first that any and all problems with said machine, repairs and such are your responsibility.
i've seen such aged machine simple go up in one last puff of smoke when &quot;tech&quot; tried to fit a drive or card into such.
its best to know that opening such a machine is dangerous.
