<s> Just bought myself a new motherboard & AMD CPU. </s>
<s> while building my new system, some of thermapaste got leaked into the CPU socket placement (i inserted cpu, put the paste on top of cpu and put the heatsink/fank on top.. but i didn't like the placement of my heatsink/cpu so i took it out, and took out the CPU but some of the thermapaste got leaked) i tried to clean it with a paper towel, it wasn't too serious of a leak but now.. nothing will start (my cpu fan won't run) im trying to start from a barebone (just RAM, CPU, and Powersupply) i checked the placement for PW switch and it is in the right placement.. would a little thermapaste leak cause enough trouble to mess up my CPU & motherboard, or do i need a new power supply? </s>
<s> (380 watt power supply.. brand new as well) </s>
<s> But the last one I built is a 1ghz athlon, and I never used that thermapaste stuff. </s>
<s> Its still running fine. </s>
<s> I guess it has to do with the new pc's. </s>
<s> It sounds as if the board isn't powered. </s>
<s> Just check all connections, especially power supply to the motherboard. </s>
<s> Some motherboards have more than one connector. </s>
<s> In addition to the 20/24 pin, typical connector, many boards also have a 4 pin connector. </s>
<s> Mobo only, no CPU, no memory nada. </s>
<s> Plug the PS 20/24 pin connector into the mobo. </s>
<s> Plug the PS into a hot outlet and turn the switch on its rear on. </s>
<s> [at this point most newer mobos will have a light on the mobo that indicates that the five volt standby voltage is present]. </s>
<s> Rather than the front panel switch simply use a small metal slot screwdriver to momentarily short the two power switch pins together. </s>
<s> The supply should start as noted by its fan running, [at this point the 4 pin 12 volt connector need not be present]. </s>
<s> This test can be made with the mobo laying on a table and the power supply also there just out of the box. </s>
<s> Always the first step that this writer makes. </s>
<s> No use putting defective hardware into the case to find out. </s>
<s> Also mounting of the mobo improperly can lead to shoted artwork lands preventing operation. </s>
<s> To test an ATX supply by itself, only plugged into a wall outlet, simply [from the rear of the 20/24 pin connector use something like a paper clip [small on] to jumper the green wire to any of the black [ground/return] leads in the same cable. </s>
<s> As long as that jumper is making contact to both pins the power supply will turn on, again as noted by the fan running. </s>
<s> [from the mobo it only takes a momentary contact, because the mobo makes the connection between the green wire and ground [logic low]. </s>
<s> If the thermal compound is conductive, [older arctic silver was, not true any longer] that could cause problems with the CPU. </s>
