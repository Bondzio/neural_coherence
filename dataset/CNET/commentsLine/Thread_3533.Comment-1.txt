os: windows vista home premium speakers: 5.1 i turned on my computer the other day and noticed that where there would normally be sound, there was only a hissing noise.
i checked my cables and ensured that everything was plugged in.
i checked the sound controls and made sure that nothing was muted.
none of my setting had changed.
i normally listen to music and such on a daily basis, so i know the sound had been functioning just recently.
i uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers.
i googled for solutions.
i'm completely bewildered.
i should add that the hissing noise only occurs when there would normally be sound.
if i turn up the volume on my speakers the hissing gets louder.
however, if i reduce the sound through the software, the hissing remains at the level set by my speakers.
anyone have any ideas?
