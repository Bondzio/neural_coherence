I got everything installed. The desktop computer wired to the router and modem is in a different room from the wireless desktop, but still only about 30 feet away. My wireless desktop is picking up the network with Windows default stuff, but not with my Belkin software, which doesn't matter to me. But, when I type in the Net Key and try to connect, it waits a couple seconds and then tells me about there being available networks again, but doesn't connect me. Could this be an interference issue? It's only like 30 feet away. Anyway, any help is appreciated.
