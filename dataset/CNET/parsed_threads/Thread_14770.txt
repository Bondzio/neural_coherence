<s> i bought a brand new HP mini notebook around a year ago and i've had it hooked to the AC supply permanently and have been using it for long periods of time that exceeds 7 hours per day, just like when one would use a desktop. </s>
<s> frankly i've never had a desktop in my life except from years ago and i've always borrowed my friend's pc since i'm crashing in his place, but ever since i got my laptop i've been sitting infront of it for many hours everyday and i've been doing this for 4 months, so i'm wondering if i've been exposed to large amounts of laptop radiation since laptops are only supposed to be powered on for 4 hours until the battery dies out, but now i basically had it on 24/7 on hard power supply on the dinner table and uses it for long durations just like a desktop without those professional laptop shield. </s>
<s> granted i didn't put it in my lap and i just sat with the laptop on the table proper so no worries about my genitals being affected and i always made sure the laptop itself is always half an arm's length away from me but i'm still worried about getting cancer sooner because after googling for awhile it seems laptop radiations don't always meet safety standards, maybe its time i get a proper desktop for good. </s>
<s> well share your thoughts with me i'd like to know what you folks think, chao! </s>
<s> While CRTs could emit X rays, LCDs don't. </s>
<s> But there are a few that are sensitive to even the slightest of EM so you must be gentle with them and hope they'll ask their doctors. </s>
<s> Frankly, the worry is up to you as there is no X ray radiation source in laptops. </s>

<s> Who knows what they will find tomorrow. </s>
<s> Personally I wish they would add a device to cell phones so that if you used it while operating a motor vehicle you would get a highly aggressive form of brain cancer and be dead within 24 hrs. </s>
<s> so some people are more sensitive to these electro magnetic waves than others, i was born prematurely so i guess i could have problems down the road, i never got a desktop these past 7 years because i move around too frequently and i can't afford to to put too many of my stuff in storage. </s>
<s> thanks for letting me know! </s>
<s> The only good news I see is that laptops emit a minuscule percentage of EM that desktops and CRTs did. </s>
<s> I can only imagine how bad some felt using desktops. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Normally, the radiation emitted by netbooks are very minimal and I don't think that it would be enough to cause cancer. </s>
<s> From where does a laptop emit . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> . </s>
<s> uh, oh! </s>
<s> You mean the wireless radio emits radiation? </s>
<s> As in just like a cell phone? </s>
<s> OMG!! </s>
<s> A radio transmitter radiating!!! </s>
<s> Youtor. </s>
<s> Don't be paranoid. </s>
<s> You have EM from the power circuits, RF from the wifi and other stuff. </s>
<s> While most of us think nothing of it, a few folk believe what they believe. </s>
<s> Given what the old CRTs threw out, you'd think the sensitive ones would have died out by now. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Maybe youtor is already affected. </s>
<s> And don't forget the nuclear fallout from Japan, wafting it's way across the Pacific to North America. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> A lot of people have been bothered by the radiation scare, although, there is some truth to the idea, it still depends on the vulnerability of the person. </s>
<s> Definitely, a healthy individual will not be affected easily and likewise a person with an impaired immunity will be harmed at a minimal exposure. </s>
<s> From Cathode Ray Tubes to today's LCD. </s>
<s> If they feel it from LCD, imagine what happens when they are near a CRT! </s>
