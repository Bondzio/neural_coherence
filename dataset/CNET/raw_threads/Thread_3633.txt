They are all 3-5 years old but fully updated to xp pro. I juse a linksys 802 b g router. The laptop uses a linksys card and the pcs connect via ethernet. I have no problem with any of them except when I am online, every 10 minutes or so I get the Work Offline? or Try Again? error message. Often I get the page not found message when refreshing. Sometimes I can't connect to the internet at all. When I hook the cable modem directly to the computer w/o the router, there is no problem. To fix the problem I go into my network places/network connectons and right click on the network connection icon and click repair. This fixes the problem every time. Does anyone have any idea what the problem is and how I can fix it? A solution is much appreciated. Thanks.

I upgraded firmware, but the problem persisted. The Linksys router seems to lose your settings, although the settings appear to be there. So all you need to do is open the linksys settings page, and click on save settings. Another related problem is if you have more than one network named on the router (eg: 'home' and 'linksys')- I deleted my 'home' network, and run on the default 'linksys' network now, and since then, the problem has not returned. Hope this helps.
