when i bought my canon bubblejet i560 the guy threw in a usb connector.
after wasting an hour and one half i discarded it and loaded the drivers and other stuff from disc using the big bulky parallel?
cable.
it went flawlessly.
is the usb cable really to connect printer and computer or for something else?
