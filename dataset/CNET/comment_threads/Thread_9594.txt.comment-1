Because of some remodeling, my small business is being forced to move its server.
We are currently running on a wired system, so reconnecting the network will entail lots of time, money, and pulling a great deal of wire.
The question is, should we just go to wireless instead?
With speeds of up to 108Mbps, I'm not concerned about throughput.
What I am concerned about, though, is reliability.
Our office is about 10 computers.
Will the network be dropping connections?
Also, just how secure is 128-bit WEP or WPA?
