it's not the dvdfab software.
i have a laptop with an external drive that does just great with dvdfab.
there's some other reason the nec drive isn't reading the discs.
i went to the nec website to check for compatibility and they gave two other brands, fuji and phillips.
i guess i'll try those and if they don't work either i'll need more feedback on this issue.
