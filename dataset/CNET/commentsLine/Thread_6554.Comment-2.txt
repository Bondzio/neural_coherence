if you have a discrete graphics card, did you disable the onboard one via the bios?
have you looked at the system event log?
to do that click start -&gt; control panel -&gt; administrative tools -&gt; event viewer.
once in event viewer click on the system log and scroll through the entries looking for those flagged &quot;error&quot; to see if you can find hints as to where the problem could be.
good luck.
