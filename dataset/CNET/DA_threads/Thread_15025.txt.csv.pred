1.1.1	I'll soon be in the market for a new laptop and I've been wondering if there's much difference in performance between the pentium M and the Core2Duo (2.0Ghz).	St
1.1.2	I tend to use my notebook for graphics editing (Photoshop, Illustrator), medium gaming (aoe3, sims2), listening to music, and Internet.	St
1.1.3	It also seems like most laptops I look at either have a base Intel 950 or high-end geforce GPU, how would this factor into my needs when complemented by either of these CPUs?	St
1.2.1	Much better.	St
1.2.2	http://www.pocketdeal.com/deal.aspx?srcId=15031 notes a Core 2 Duo by a namebrand for 599.	St
1.2.3	Not stripped... Bob	St
