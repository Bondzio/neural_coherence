<s> So I made a custom PC few months ago, and It works perfectly, its' temp was normal, everything was plugged in right, but after 2 months, my PC started to make loud fan noise. </s>
<s> So when I checked it's (CPU) temperature it was 61 C on idle. </s>
<s> With no programs on. </s>
<s> I checked the AMD processor website and choose my CPU. </s>
<s> It says it can only handle up to 62 C... </s>
<s> So I checked my CPU, and apparently I put too much thermal paste and it leaked to the bottom of my chip (but very very little amount). </s>
<s> So I got some 99%USP Isopropyl Alcohol and cleaned it very carefully. </s>
<s> Then I applied new thermal paste. </s>
<s> But it still does that.... Also by the way there is a tiny crack on the top of the CPU.... </s>
<s> The heatsink/fan has tiny amount of thermal paste on it. </s>
<s> &lt;div&gt; My PC specs. </s>
<s> CPU-AMD Phenom II x4 955BE CPU cooler-Regular stock fan that came with the CPU GPU-MSI r6450 2gb gddr3 PSU-Corsair CX430 430w RAM-8gb ddr3 *2 case fans(120mm)* &lt;/div&gt; I hope you could help me, thanks </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> On hw monitor, it says Temp 1 = 61C and Temp 2 = 58C for the case </s>
<s> You wouldn't expect the CPU to be any cooler than the case? </s>
<s> Would you? </s>
<s> Now there are some newer folk that think they can add more case fans but for many builders and gamers they just leave the side cover off. </s>
<s> If I have the time I head to my shop area to carve out a square foot out of the cover then I hot glue screen or speaker mesh over that. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Try changing the heatsink on the cpu generally stock coolers are not that powerful while running high appplication the cpu utilization is more . </s>
<s> and as per you said just cheak that any particles of thermal paste is on the cpu or near cpu pins . </s>
<s> you can clean the thermal compound by using antec thermal removing compound. </s>
<s> and never experiment with things which you don't know always call a computer technician or the person who knows this all stuff </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Go for a custom cpu cooler it will solve your problem as stock cooler are not of better quality. </s>
