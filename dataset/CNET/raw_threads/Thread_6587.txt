I have never seen or heard of a Plasma screen on a laptop, they normally use TFT or some equivalent. I find that a soft damp cloth works just as well as anything else to clean one. Never seen a static problem.

Sorry, you're right it is a TFT, I just always think they're plasma because of the ripple effect when you touch them. The soft damp cloth worked like a dream, thanks. And free as well I do have a cat Bob, but I don't usually have much trouble with static, only paws pressing random keys on my keyboard when I'm not watching. Thanks again to the both of you. Adi

I think &quot;Klear Screen&quot; is the absolute best stuff on the market...Not just for laptop Screens but CRT's too! Recommended by TechTV and a whole lot of other &quot;Geeks&quot;. The stuff is amazing...smooth, non damaging, &quot;polished like&quot; finish. Some &quot;wipes&quot;, (in particular Alcohol based) can be DAMAGING! http://www.klearscreen.com/ And some very interesting FAQ's concerning the effects of using the wrong stuff... http://www.klearscreen.com/faq.html#Anchor

Although there are many ways to clean sensitive plastics the new and best way is to use tepid water and Ultramicrofibre towels. They use no chemicals and remove all soils from the surface without abrasion. They can be found using a search such as Ultra-microfibre or Microfibre towel. They range in prices from $2.95 to $8.00 each. In cleaning them use hot water and wring out tightly. To remove tough soils put them in your washing machine &quot;alone&quot; and use a drop or two of Dawn or similiar with Hot water and Hot water rinse. Don't dry them in the dryer! They can be used in all types of cleaning while your cleaning your screen. Though I sell them they can be found anywhere on the net and in cleaning supply stores.

I use the Office Depot Screen Cleaner, but there are many others like this on the market. They clean your screen and surely make a good job! My screen is still clean after 10 days I used it on my notebook! See ya!

This may sound highly irregular, but I use nappy liners in conjunction with diluted (one in ten) methylated spirits, and then use a chamois lens cloth to remove any fluff and clear any smudge marks. Of course, one could always just buy a new laptop when the old one gets dirty which will also ensure your equipment is up to date and not getting obsolete

2322	14	17402	209168	190954	TomahawkZA	4/13/04 6:54 AM	1.08183924E12	Re:How do you clean a plasma screen?	Make a one in ten dilution using one part methylated spirits and nine parts water. Use a soft cloth dampened with the solution (important, damp ... not dripping wet). I use nappy liners because they are cheap, soft and absorbant. Afterwards I give a soft rub using a Chamois lens cloth to remove any lint, fluff or streaking and smudges. The lens cloth is cheap and available from most opticician's or good camera shops. A damp sponge also does the trick, but you could end up dripping water into the keyboard if you don't wring out the excess water properly ... so I find my solution above a better bet.

Do not spray directly on the screen, but rather on a soft clean cotton cloth, e.g., a not entirely new t-shirt or dish towel. Spraying directly on the screen may (1) be too strong a solution and (2) short out the connectors on the sides of the screen; don't so that. In extreme circumstances (long flight or distant land) a little vodka on a cloth will do the trick. It takes something a little stronger that water to remove oily fingerprints and smudges, and soaps leave a film.

You can buy some expensive versions, but I found a cheap source at www.eriecotton.com. Large 16&quot; towel for about $4.00 a towel. This product is a great polishing cloth, and I use it on my glasses too. For plasma and Lcd cleaning I use it dry to dust and for smudges etc slightly damp and gentle wiping.

After spilling beer on my TV screen, here is how I got it perfectly clean. I took a new microfiber cloth, put a single drop of dish detergent on it, and then wrung it out in warm water. I GENTLY went over the entire screen in a circular manner. I then took a dry microfiber (actually kept 1/2 of the same cloth dry) and GENTLY wiped off the screen. My last pass was a with a gently buffing motion. Looks like new and I didn't have to buy any special cleaners.
