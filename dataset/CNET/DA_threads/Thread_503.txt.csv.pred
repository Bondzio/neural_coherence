1.1.1	Hi , I have 4 pc 's : 2 win 98 's , 1 winXP , and a new win Vista .	St
1.1.2	One of the 98 computers had the printer ( hp deskjet series 5550 ) .	St
1.1.3	I took the printer off that pentium II win 98 box ( pc due to retire ) and installed the printer directly connected to the new Vista box .	St
1.1.4	That went well .	Polite
1.1.5	( enough ) .	St
1.1.6	I added the printer as a network printer to the win XP machine , and printed a test page .	St
1.1.7	Wow , that went well !	St
1.1.8	I tried to & quot ; add printer & quot ; on the pentium 4 win 98 box .	St
1.1.9	: .- & lt ; & quot ; Browse for network printer & quot ; will not find the printer connected to the Vista box .	St
1.1.10	I ca n't guess a path to the printer that works from the 98 box .	St
1.1.11	In XP shared printer is ok , in 98 & quot ; add printer & quot ; ca n't find shared printer , printer works well locally in Vista .	St
1.1.12	How do I use Vista printer from Win 98 computer ?	Ques
1.1.13	Thanks !	St
1.1.14	B	St
1.2.1	Hey , What needs to happen : Go into Properties of your Printer on Vista and under the Sharing tab click on & quot ; Additional Drivers & quot ; and check Win 98 , this should do the trick .	St
1.2.2	It might want the drivers disk to do this , if you dont have a disk , google for win98 drivers .	St
1.2.3	This is the process to add drivers to an XP box , the Vista process might be a little different , but similar , look around for similar settings or titles to the ones I mentioned .	St
1.3.1	Whoa !	St
1.3.2	That makes sense !	St
1.3.3	I will give it a try .	St
1.3.4	B	St
1.4.1	In fact , it turns out that I added XP that way .	St
1.4.2	In Vista when I go to add drivers I get to choose by *processor* , not OS .	St
1.4.3	That 's why I did not remember doing this .	St
1.4.4	The choices are : Itanium , x64 , x86 .	St
1.4.5	I 'm beginning to feel non-supported by Vista !	St
1.4.6	Still , I oughtta be able to *find* the shared printer .	St
1.4.7	I 'm gon na go look for it again .	St
1.4.8	Thanks Scottwang !	St
