<s> D-Link's DPH-50U works as advertised for most users but be warned that it does not work for all users. </s>
<s> In my case the initial installation and setup went well and the device performed as expected. </s>
<s> However later in the day my computer no longer recognized the device and I lost several of my usb connections concurrently. </s>
<s> After some time the DPH-50U reports 'Device no Present' and shows the red 'not connected' icon in ones system tray. </s>
<s> In XP SP2, running devmgmt.msc shows 'unknown device' under Universal Serial Bus controllers. </s>
<s> An internet search to solve this problem illuminated the fact that the D-Link DPH-50U is not a standard usb device. </s>
<s> The installation software creates a unique usb setup which in my case has proven problematic. </s>
<s> Those 'unknown device' entries were previously fully functioning usb devices; now belly-up. </s>
<s> The only solution I have found was discovered here: http://tinyurl.com/cjy4l D-Link must know of this situation as it has been previously reported; I discovered it by Googling D-Link &quot;Device Not Recognized&quot;. </s>
<s> D-Link Support: None! </s>
<s> I've phoned and emailed and have had one response. </s>
<s> Here is that response: Your Case ID is DLK397773915. </s>
<s> What is the issue that you are having. </s>
<s> I will take care of any of the issues that you are having with the DPH-50U. </s>
<s> My reply has been ignored and I have heard nothing further. </s>
<s> What is the best method to proceed? </s>
<s> It's unlikely to be a DLink problem but a PC issue. </s>
<s> Dlink won't help you fix your PC and I can't comment further since nothing is told about the PC. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The solution that you posted had nothing to do with D-Link. </s>
<s> You have a motherboard/operating system issue that is keeping a D-Link product from working. </s>
<s> The issue had nothing to do with your D-Link product. </s>
<s> It had to do with your USB port. </s>
<s> That is like complaining to Cheveron about there gas pumps when there is an issue with the fuel filling port on you Toyota. </s>
<s> I tried Googling D-Link &quot;Device Not Recognized&quot; and only found 257 entries. </s>
<s> Not bad for such a big company. </s>
<s> You would think they would have a lot more considering how many products they must sell in a month. </s>
<s> Not to mention that tech support is not free. </s>
<s> It is for you as a customer, but D-Link has to pay somebody to talk to you. </s>
<s> You are expecting that D-Link should trouble shoot an issue with your motherboard and OS? </s>
<s> Why? </s>
<s> Call Microsoft. </s>
<s> Call whoever made your motherboard/PC. </s>
<s> No surprise, I get the same problem with D-Link - I stopped using them because their products are flakey and support is simply not satisfactory, like they dont even care. </s>
