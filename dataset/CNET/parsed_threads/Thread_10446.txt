<s> Okay so I had a ~6.5 year old LCD monitor die on me today and need to get a replacement. </s>
<s> My PC is as old as the broken monitor and I want to make sure the newer monitors out there are compatible with my display adapter card. </s>
<s> I am interested in a Widescreen monitor, but when I open up the display settings for my PC the only choices I have are 800x600 and 1280x1024 since my broken monitor was in the 4:3 aspect ratio. </s>
<s> My videocard is old...a nVidia 64MB GeForce 2 MMX or something like that. </s>
<s> Would I be okay getting a widescreen monitor or do I have to stick with the 4:3 ones? </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> When the video card detects the new monitor it should give you more resolution options. </s>
<s> If not you can probably get updated drivers for the card. </s>
