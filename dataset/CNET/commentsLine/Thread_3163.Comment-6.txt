vm machines are nice because once you get them set up, you save the current configuration and instead of doing a huge backup, in the event of a diaster, you just restore a file from a file and boom!
you're back up and running in about 5-10 minutes.
i have several computers that run two additional virtual machines so i have roughly about 10 computers, 4 physical and 6 virtual, but the virtual machines are dynamically integrated into my network and two of them are even domain controllers.
just remember that if you're going to get that extensive, don't shut the primary machine off that the virtual machine is on, otherwise nothing works!
