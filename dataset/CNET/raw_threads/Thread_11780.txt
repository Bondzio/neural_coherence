On a $1200 budget, I've got two interesting offers from Dell And Gateway and I don't know which to choose. I'm not a computer whiz so I need the tech support that these companies offer, but I would like to be able to upgrade the computer in the future. I do a lot of work on photo shop and pinacle. Not pro stuff. Basic. What should I do? Dell Offer XPS 400 Date & Time: April 05,2006 10:41 AM CST SYSTEM COMPONENTS
