i have a d-link wbr-1310 router and everytime the phone rings and is picked up, my internet connection becomes unplugged.
i am new with routers & cox cable says it's the router.
has anyone any information on the set up that would have caused this to happen?
it's very frustrating.
remember i am a rookie too.
