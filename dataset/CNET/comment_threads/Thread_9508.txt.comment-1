I'm planning on buying a new desktop next month.
I'm mainly going to use it for composing music (Cubase or Logic) and just normal web surfing.
I don't play games but I do watch movies on my computer a lot I used to think that Mac was way ahead of PC in almost every aspect but now I think they both have their pros and cons.
I'd like someone to recommend me a PC as good as or better than the iMac at the price of the 21.5 inch model or simply persuade me to stay with Mac.
