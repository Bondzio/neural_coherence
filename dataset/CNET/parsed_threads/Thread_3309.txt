<s> Hello Everyone. </s>
<s> I recently built a new computer and installed windows 7 ultimate x64 and have 4gb of ram installed initially. </s>
<s> Recently I bought more ram (the SAME exact type of ram) and when I put them in the computer the computer randomly shuts down, but when I take them out it stops shutting down. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>

<s> The Computer Help forum and Windows 7 forums are well read, lots of folk there. </s>
<s> You picked a good forum to ask this the first time. </s>
