I got it all setup and such and got it working with my iTouch. But for some reason it won't work with my laptop. When I go to the view available wireless networks, it doesnt show up. I have a feeling the problem is with my laptop not seeing the router since the iTouch and the router work fine. Anybody wanna help?

It works fine for connecting and getting on the internet with my Ipod Touch so I know the router is working and sending out a signal. But for some reason when I go to view the wireless network connections on my laptop the router does not show up. Is their anyway to turn on the wireless on my laptop
