<s> I recently installed a pcie esata card to my quad core dell running Vista home premium. </s>
<s> I had a WD mybook home connected via esata. </s>
<s> It worked immediately after install. </s>
<s> It worked for a week or two and now if I reboot and the card is in I get an error message: AHCI bios is not installed..this appears right after Dell splash screen. </s>
<s> cannot enter bios from splash screen. </s>
<s> If I remove the card windows boots normally. </s>
<s> Update: Flashed BIOS no change </s>
<s> Such things do fail. </s>
<s> Try another. </s>
<s> Gee Thanks..I'm not convinced it's the card. </s>
<s> Anyone else? </s>
<s> Test the drive by connection to the mainboard. </s>
<s> The message was the decider for me. </s>
<s> The card's bios won't load so the card is nonfunctional. </s>
