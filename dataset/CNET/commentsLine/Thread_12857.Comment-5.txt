i got the router years ago and may or may not be able to find a how-to chapter on setting wifi router passwords.
my question, however, was whether or not there is one passwork/security key for the network and another one for the router, as the epson error message has led me to believe.
i know the network password/security key works for the network, so why does the wirelss printer not take it?
