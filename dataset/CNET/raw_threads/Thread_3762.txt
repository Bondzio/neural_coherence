I've installed DWL2100 AP installed 1.5 yrs back, it works fine but now I found w lan link down so I checked AP its rebooting continiunly i.e. power led lite up, but as soon as it detect Ethernet link It restarts.

The AP power LED blinks 5 times, pauses then repeats. On the 2nd blink of the sequence, the LAN LED comes on and then goes off at the end of the sequence. The WLAN LED never comes on. With the LAN port unplugged... the power LED blinks 11 times then repeats. The AP manager will not discover the AP. The hard reset procedure does not seem to work. I have the PC's NIC communicating to the switch set to IP:192.168.0.49 SNM:255.255.255.0. I contacted D-Link for a solution on how to get the AP to be recognized by the AP manager or the embedded browser. Or at least what the problem is based on the LED blink pattern(s). D-LINK SUPPORT REPLY The behavior of the lights would indicate the access point has failed. There is an internal hardware failure on the DWL-2100AP. My solution was to scrap the unit and replace it with something more reliable.

Consumers have made it clear that price is more important. Only when it fails they might talk about reliability. Then again this product rolled out about 10 years ago. That sounds very reliable! Bob
