I have a Dell Dimension 4700 Desktop with Windows XP Pro SP2.
I read the CNET Forums with interest and have learned a great deal over these past couple of years.
However, there is one area which I have not been able to grasp, and that is &quot;Partitioning and Formatting the Hard Drive&quot;.
Question 1 - Why does the Hard Drive need to be partitioned and formatted?
Question 2 - How is partitioning and formatting done?
I read in one particular CNET response, that all you had to do in Windows was to go to &quot;Disk Management&quot; to complete this task, however, I have searched and can not even find &quot;Disk Management&quot; on my computer.
For anyone who wishes to respond to my query: PLEASE keep your answer simple and NON-TECHNICAL, because there has been NOTHING on this topic in the forums so far which I have been able to understand.
Thank you so much for all the help I have received from CNET Forums just by reading the responses to other peoples' questions.
