1.1.1	The never ending question - always a pain unless someone needs an answer.	St
1.1.2	I do.	St
1.1.3	I want a Tablet, something at least as good as the Acer 500 that a friend has.	St
1.1.4	His tablet, like the one I want, is used principally to store edited photographs for display, use as appointment list, not to use for games, other than perhaps backgammon and chesss, but no action games.	St
1.1.5	Will use for films, probably on an additional stick if required.	St
1.1.6	I am not technically minded and will probably take ages getting a tablet sorted out after my friend helps me.	St
1.1.7	Don't think I want Apple, but is ther something better than the Asus 500, possibly the Asus EE Transformer Infinity or the like if that's better than the 500 mentioned.	St
1.1.8	I woudl also like to be able to sync with a DSLR, either by cable or Wi-Fi, but could live without that.	St
1.1.9	Any helpful people care to give me some ideas please.	St

1.2.1	The TF300 for example has SD and MicroSD card slots so I could move pictures from the camera over.	St
1.2.2	I have yet to see if I can use Eye-Fi to do this.	St
1.2.3	However I would get a small laptop for the price.	St
1.2.4	Why the tablet for this use?	St
1.2.5	Don't see the attraction.	St
