<s> My daughter just bought a large Ide harddrive. </s>
<s> When we opened up her new computer I found there is a SATA harddrive installed. </s>
<s> Is there anyway to use this IDE harddrive on her system without removing her cd drive and dvd writer? </s>
<s> If not, can we get an external usb harddrive case for the new harddrive? </s>
<s> We are unfamiliar with sata drives. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> The best of my knowledge, you need to buy a pci ide adapter (not expensive). </s>
<s> The you can install up to 4 ide devices. </s>
<s> If so, as pboothe says, you can buy a PCI card to give 2 more ports [4 drives]. </s>
<s> You can also buy SATA to IDE adapters that plug into the IDE drive. </s>
<s> Do a google search to find some. </s>
<s> They adapt both the power and signal inputs. </s>
<s> I have no experience actually using one though. </s>
<s> Yes, that is also an option. </s>
