1.1.1	I 'd been wondering if cables marked USB-2 were really faster than USB-1 and worth the extra money .	St
1.1.2	So I decided to test the speed .	St
1.1.3	Not scientifically by any fashion , but the results were interesting .	St
1.1.4	I just used the sweep second hand on my wrist watch .	St
1.1.5	My machine specs : Home built with Shuttle main board with 6 USB-2 ports , AMD 2400+ XP processor , 512 Meg RAM .	St
1.1.6	Optical drive : Sony 52/32/52 CD burner .	St
1.1.7	Drive case : BYTECC USB-2 .	St
1.1.8	Procedure : Copy a large file from the USB drive to a folder on my HD .	St
1.1.9	I used the supplied USB-2 cable that came with the case and a several year old USB-1 cable from an older USB Zip-100 drive .	St
1.1.10	File copied : IE6 full , 48 Meg in size from a CD-RW disk that I had burned a while back .	St
1.1.11	Results : USB-1 cable took 25 seconds .	St
1.1.12	USB-2 cable took 19 seconds .	St
1.1.13	So there you are folks .	St
1.2.1	I suspect some cables may be more equal than others ... some of the earlier ( or real cheap ) USB1 cables might not do quiet as well , but your overall results are quite interesting .	St
1.3.1	USB1 and USB2 cables are wired exactly the same .	St
1.3.2	The USB2 cables are shielded better , and thus can be spec'ed for higher signal speed than the older USB1 cables .	St
1.3.3	However , depending upon the environment ( how & quot ; RF noisy & quot ; ) and cable length , a very short run of USB1 cable should be able to handle the higher speed of USB2 .	St
1.3.4	USB1 ( actually USB1.1 ) or otherwise called & quot ; USB Full-Speed & quot ; interface is supposed to go 12 Mbps ( Mega bits per second ) and USB2 , or otherwise called & quot ; USB Hi-Speed & quot ; , is supposed to go 480 Mbps .	St
1.3.5	12 Mbps is approximately 1.5 MBps ( Mega Bytes per second ) and 480 Mbps is approximately 60 MBps .	St
1.3.6	But that does not provide for any protocol overhead , and other loss .	St
1.3.7	So far , neither interface is yet living up to the hype .	St
1.3.8	I think , on a good day , USB1 interface is typically getting about half of its promise , around 0.8 MBps , and USB2 is typically getting much less than a third of its promise , at about 8 to 20 MBps .	St
