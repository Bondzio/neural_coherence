deciding on whether to make a last stand with a new agp graphics card or upgrade the whole computer.
here's my computer:  reason on upgrade is i'm experiencing low fps lately on my games.
down to 10fps sometimes.
heres some cards i've been looking at: asus ah3650 silent/htdi - visiontek radeon hd2400 visiontek radeon x1950 pro xtreme gamer edition his radeon hd 2600 xt fan - graphics adapter - radeon hd welcome any/all suggestions.
thanks!
