yep, it's an old ibm intellistation m pro with dual piii processors, 768mb, a 36gb scsi hd and a matrox g450 video card with dual 21&quot; monitors.
this is my work system, they've offered to replace it with a newer one a couple of times but this is a great old machine.
but then there is the other machine i've been playing with (that i have to put back), it's also an intellistation but it's a new z pro with dual 3.6 gig zeon processors, 2 gb of ram, a nvidia quadro fx1300 video card and it's running vista.
very cool machine, wish i could afford to take it home.
