<s> I have been trying to find the binary file for an old Soyo BIOS - 5eh-1bc1.bin - no luck, even from the 'obsolete' section on the Soyo website! </s>
<s> My old PC is working fine, but won't recognise hard drives over 40GB. </s>
<s> So I've a choice between using a smaller (second user) drive, or buying a new motherboard. </s>
<s> Any other suggestions? </s>
<s> Hope the question's clear enough; I'm new round here Cheers, SJ </s>
<s> You are in the timeframe that you shouldn't touch such a machine in case it just falls apart underneath you. </s>
<s> My advice is to get the 40G and get by. </s>

<s> Are you saying it won't recongize a 40gb partition or a physical HD 40gb size. </s>
<s> Its important, as then you could partition a large HD into smaller partitions under 40gb, probably 32gb as the limit for each partition. </s>
<s> Did you visit the HD makers website for HD install s/w to help install beyond whatever the bios limits are? </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> If the BIOS only sees 40GB, partitioning won't make any difference. </s>
<s> Most HDs come with overlay software which would enable your system to see all the space. </s>
<s> Or you might try something like this. </s>
