well, it's been awhile since i've upgraded my video card (i have a sapphire ati 8500le, agp, 250/400, 128mb).
i just bought battlefield 2, and found out i really need to.
normally, i'm diehard ati, but i've been looking at nvidia's latest stuff and it doesn't look half bad.
so, basically, i'm looking for the best card for $100-200, ati or nvidia.
i will be using it just about exclusivley for gaming (see battlefield 2 for screenshots).
now, i don't have pci express, but if there's a great card that has to have it, my motherboard's getting old and could be replaced too.
thanks in advance guys.
p.s.
motherboard can support agp 4x/8x and regular pci.
also, sorry if this has been asked before, i really didn't want to search the whole forum.
