power consumption.
certainly will need a good hsf.
[if you buy the cpu retail it comes with a hsf and 3 year warranty] oem warranty is &quot;not doa&quot; up to 90 days normally and must buy the hsf separately for any warranty.
very good chance that you would need a new power supply.
the pc 3200 will likely run but only at the pc 1600 or 2100 speed that you set the memory bus speed to.
the cpu will probably run but not at it's rated speed.
the multiplier in the cpu is fixed, [setting the multiplier on the mobo will have no effect] if your memory speed doesn't match the fsb.
[i'm not sure what fsb that cpu can run at]
