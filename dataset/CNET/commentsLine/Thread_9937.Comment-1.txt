i am going to buy a new pc in a couple of months.
my old pc is just that...old, and i want more speed and capabilities.
i have a 2001 custom built pc with athlon 850mhz, 384 rams with millions of unknown stuff that makes it slow.
i am going to purchase a dell, however, how do i know which dell to purchase.
i am a machinist and constantly use cad-style programs, however, my wife is a type of 'gamer' i can affored to spend $2500, but i want 'top notch' (or as close to it as possible) speed, excellent cad software capability, and the 'gamer' potential all in one!
ideas?...dimension, inspiron?...help me please.
