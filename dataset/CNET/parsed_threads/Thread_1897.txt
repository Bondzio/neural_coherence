<s> I am building a P4 pc. </s>
<s> I am no expert but I built a 1GHZ pentium years ago after I blew up my old one. </s>
<s> I purchased an ASUS p4S8x MB off ebay. </s>
<s> I also purchased a P4 2.6 ghz 533mhz processor. </s>
<s> Well the problem is the proocessor turned out to be a 800 mhz processor. </s>
<s> I guess it was listed wrong or I was just screwed by some seller. </s>
<s> My question is will this processor work on this board? </s>
<s> Any help will be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> There is an 800MHz FSB P4 which is a good thing. </s>
<s> I wonder if you have some P4 with the better 800MHz FSB? </s>

<s> http://www.hothardware.com/viewarticle.aspx?articleid=61&catid=3 Might be best to buy PC 3200 [DDR 400] memory because the chipset seems to POSSIBLY support DDR 400. </s>
<s> If not it will simply run at DDR 333. </s>
<s> You are correct. </s>
<s> Let me clarify what I ment It is a 2.6/512/800 p4 processor. </s>
<s> Intel used what was called &quot;quad clocking&quot;, and thus a 200 MHz DDR which clocks on both leading and trailing edge is called DDR 400 [200 times 2] and quad clocked gives the FSB of 800 MHz. </s>
<s> [200 times quad, which is 4 thus 800]. </s>
