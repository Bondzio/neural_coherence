innovation and engineering and demand are all in the mix of what controls the cost of these devices.
just because it is expensive, to do it now ,does not forever lock it into the &quot;never happen&quot; realm.
when video tape recorders first came out they were $10,000 dollars!
when cd drives first came out they were expensive.
when laser printers came out they were very expensive.
in all of those processes it was generally the very precise tolerances that forced the price high.
but in time, all came down in price when the engineering got to a point where machining and holding to very tight tolerances became the &quot;de regular.&quot; i remember when the current 3.5&quot; floppy disks came out, the drives and the discs themselves were expensive.
it was explained that the &quot;very close tolerances&quot; and the precise mechanisms, which were much higher than the then-current 5.25&quot; floppies, were the reason.
did you know that when aluminum was first produced it was worth more than gold!
there is a small 6 lb.
tip of it on top of the washington memorial in dc.
but in time the manufacturing of it (which was difficult in the beginning) got better and easier.
time marches on, on the backs of the innovators.
boy, i can't wait to be 200 years old!
