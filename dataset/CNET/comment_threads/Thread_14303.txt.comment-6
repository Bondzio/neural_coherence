Ah--My laptop happens to be a Dell as well!!
Were you also getting disconnected when your ISP changed your IP number, or were you having a problem connecting all of the time?
As I mentiond earlier, the only time I have a problem is when my ISP changes the IP number every few days.
That makes me wonder if my solution could possibly be as simple as changing a setting--but if so, which setting???
?
