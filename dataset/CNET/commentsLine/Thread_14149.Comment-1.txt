recently my 1-year old pc suddenly unable to detect the master sata hard disk drive.
so i have no choice but to revert to my old ide hdd, and meanwhile i purchased another sata hdd as a back-up to this ide hdd.
but upon installing this brand new sata hdd, again my pc bios cannot detect it.
it looks like the problem all the while is concerning the sata function of my motherboard rather than the sata hdd itself.
what went wrong?
