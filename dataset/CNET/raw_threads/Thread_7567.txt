Power cable connected to drive? Did the drive ever work properly? Does the drive appear in the BIOS? If not you need to change some BIOS settings. I assume this is a standard internal 3.5&quot; floppy drive and not a USB drive or 5.25 floppy drive. Correct?

I figured they weren't realizing that a floppy isn't automatically executed when it is inserted in a floppy drive like a CD/DVD is when it is inserted into a CD/DVD drive.
