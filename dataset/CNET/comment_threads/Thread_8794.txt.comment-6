I couldn't tell.
Also be sure that your Compaq has the switch for Wifi on/off to the on position.
Thanks for the try at details but no model number so I can't look at the machine and see if it's one with known issues.
Test your machine at a free wifi spot and if it works there consider the wifi router you are trying to connect to defective.
