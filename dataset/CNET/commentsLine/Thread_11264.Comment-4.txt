just to try it the last tablet was the g tablet  i also have a bn color nook with the cyranogen installed.
but maybe there's more to this than ustream.
it's just an app.
link follows.
you can find better tablets than this thing i happen to have today.
our office works on apps so i never know exactly which tablets are free at the time.
