I understand that these two formats are similar, but I wan to know if they are interchangeable. If the specs on a hard drive says that it is EIDE will it work with a motherboard that just says IDE, with no mention of EIDE compatibility? Thank You!

If all your stuff is new....it should all work just fine. The main difference is SPEED....and I don't remember any compatibility issues...
