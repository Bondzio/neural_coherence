<s> I looked up routers but most of them had feedbacks that they lose signals after a minute or reset every 10 seconds or after 6 months it doesn't work. </s>
<s> Trying to avoid this tpes but they seem to allhave this same problems regardless of brand name any good ones out there? </s>
<s> this is for wirless for home so my wife can use her laptop and i can use my desktop for games </s>
<s> like D-Link. </s>
<s> I had heard good hings about them but I went with Linksys WRT54GS. </s>
<s> Fry's price was $89.99; you may be able to do better on the web. </s>
<s> I found a NIB customer return they had marked down to $56.99. </s>
<s> I had occasional dropped connections but after a few calls to Linksys the problem was resolevd. </s>
<s> They have decent support. </s>
<s> I have installed all of the major routers and for my personal use I buy Belkins and defintely do not &quot;mix and match.&quot; My current wireless router is a Belkin preN and it rocks. </s>

<s> Keep in mind that most routers will have to reset from time to time. </s>
<s> John </s>
<s> Just bought a Belkin wireless router and tried to install in on my HP computer. </s>
<s> Followed all the steps and things went smooth until the last step. </s>
<s> I then received a message that the program could not find a internet connection. </s>
<s> I have Cox High Speed Cable for ISP. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Personally, i have mix feeling with Linksys. </s>
<s> I've use linksys routers from their BEFSR41 v1 six years ago til the Wireless cable gateway WCG200 right now. </s>
<s> Gone through at least 7 of their different models (some wired and some wireless). </s>
<s> Got to say that they have one of the best value out there but most of them don't last. </s>
<s> Maybe I am the unlucky one but none of the wireless models I've owned last more than 1.5yrs. </s>
<s> And I m not too sure about their support now a days (with almost all the tech support staff are oversea). </s>
<s> With Belkin, I've got nothing to say since I've never use their product. </s>
<s> But one thing to keep in mind with the Pre-N model or MIMO, SRX with other brand. </s>
<s> Altho almost all of them will tell u their products will be firmware upgradable when the 802.11N came out. </s>
<s> But who knows what's going to happen when the 802.11N are set. </s>
<s> Personlly, i'm just not a buyer of these &quot;pre&quot; product. </s>
<s> I'm still searching for a good wireless router out there (if it even existed). </s>
<s> Of course, these are the problems that get posted. </s>
<s> If you checked out automobiles, you would find the same -- some people have a lot of problems with their cars, and this applies to any brand; they are called lemons. </s>
<s> You never hear much about the many thousands that perform well. </s>
<s> With routers, the problem often is not with the router itself, but because it is set up wrong, or it is not using the latest firmware, or there is a problem with some device connected to it. </s>
<s> The first two of these are generally the fault of the user. </s>
<s> I have used Belkin, D-Link, and Linksys routers with no problems whatsover. </s>
<s> I have never had one behave in any of the manners that you describe as common. </s>
<s> As for cost -- around here (Albuquerque,NM), after rebates, 802.11g routers generally sell for $20 to $40. </s>
<s> The faster ones, called extreme G, super G, Pre-N, etc. </s>
<s> by different manugacturers, can be had for about $75 or less. </s>
<s> Hope this helps Frank </s>
