i purchased what was affordable at the time and now have 512 mb of pc400 ddr ram.
my motherboard has 2 ddr sockets and 2 sd sockets so you can use one or the other but not both.
also i built this machine from the board up so i know a lot more then the casual user.
and it's been fun because i am always pottering around with it and upgrading things here and there.
