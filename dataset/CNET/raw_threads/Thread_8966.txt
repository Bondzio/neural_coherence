I was wondering if there was any utility within Windows XP, Windows Vista, or OS X to monitor overall network and/or Internet bandwidth distribution. More specifically, which applications are using how much of my connection to download anything. If there aren't any provided with the operating system, would there be any third-party applications?

It is free and provides some bandwidth and conversation analasys tools. If this is a shared connection then insert a hub between the DSL modem and the router. A cheap switch will not work. It has to be a hub or a managed switch that supports &quot;port mirroring&quot;. You can use ethereal the same as before to monitor the total bandwidth being used and which applications use the most/least. SKrall

Control panel, Performance and Maint., Admin Tools, Dbl-click Performance. The 3 default parameters will be running. R-click the console and select Add Counter. Under Performance Object dropdown list, select Network Interface. It should show all network interfaces on the right. Scroll the list on the left to select the current bandwidth and click Add. After you add it you can R-click it in the list of counters at the bottom and select a custom display color.

I use it and so does several co workers and its gotten pretty good reviews from everyone. Hope this helps.
