i have been considering to buy a netbook for basic applications like -web browsing -downloading stuff(download a lot of movies) -watching movies and listening to music -typing and editing documents i am considering dell mini,sony vaoi vpcm126ag/p and hp mini 210series my prime concerns are: -would a netbook be able to pull maximum internet speeds?
i am currently using a broadband internet connection of 1mbps.
-how much of multitasking can it handle?
for instance how comfortably can it pull web browsing (with multiple tabs on), editing documents,a download in progress while a movie is running simultaneously?
-could you name a few softwares that are likely to bringdown its performance, the ones i better steer clear of.. please help me decide if netbook is a good choice at all thanks a ton!
