it's just a simple 800 divided by 677 result.
i can't tell if you call that &quot;big&quot;.
other areas will not be affected such as hard disk transfer rate, triangle fill rates, etc.
nice cpus with 4m l2 cache so benchmarks should be easy to find on those and should be as easy as 2.13 divided by 1.86 results.
i have the 2.13 but with 2m cache and the real bonus on my new versus my old system is the (non gaming) power draw is now 100 watts and the old machine run at 200 watts.
