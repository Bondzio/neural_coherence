<s> I have an old PC (Compaq Presario 4910) that I haven't used in years. </s>
<s> Today, I realized I might have some old files on it that I might want to see again, so I hooked it back up. </s>
<s> Unfortunately, after the standard COMPAQ screen and password check, I received this error: Invalid System Disk Replace the disk, and then press any key I remember that in the days leading up to the purchase of my current PC, I deleted a lot of excess files, but I didn't think I did anything to hurt my computer. </s>
<s> Maybe I was wrong. </s>
<s> What happened? </s>
<s> What does &quot;Invalid System Disk&quot; mean? </s>
<s> How can I fix it? </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> well first, is there a disk in the floppy drive? </s>
<s> try removing it, then rebooting. </s>
<s> that message means there's no OS on the first disk drive of the &quot;boot sequence.&quot; if the error is not because of the bios looking for an OS on the floppy, even if your hard drive operating system files are corrupted/gone, with a little perseverance you can remove the drive and hook it up to your other machine and get the data files off it that way-- assuming of course, that the drive still works. </s>

<s> Check to see if there is a diskette in the floppy drive. </s>
<s> This can cause this error message on boot. </s>
<s> If you wiped out import files in the root directory the system will no longer boot. </s>
<s> You need to SYS the drive to get it to boot again, if it is seen at boot time. </s>
<s> Boot with a floppy disk that has the same version of DOS that is on the system (www.bootdisk.com for a copy) and then SYS the drive SYS A: C: to restore the boot information and get it to boot up. </s>
