1.1.1	Hi , I just built a new comp .	St
1.1.2	from the ground up , and for some reason the onboard LAN will not connect to my ISP ( perhaps the ISP wo n't recognize it , not sure . )	St
1.1.3	I have the new comp .	St
1.1.4	sitting right next to the old one .	St
1.1.5	With the cable in the old one ( Windows XP , Dell Dimension ) there is no problem - the DSL connects fine , IP address auto detected , smooth as you like .	St
1.1.6	The ISP assigns this comp .	St
1.1.7	a fixed IP address ; always the same .	St
1.1.8	But the new computer ( Windows XP , Gigabyte GA-8N-SLI Royal motherboard with dual onboard LAN - Marvell 8053 chip / Marvell 88E1111 phy ) wo n't connect .	St
1.1.9	The best I can get with autodetect is & quot ; the network did not assign a network address. & quot ; Repair does n't work .	St
1.1.10	Manually entering the old computer 's IP/DNS settings does n't work , pinging the server does n't work .	St
1.1.11	So - what do I do ?	Ques
1.1.12	Is it a problem with the ISP refusing to recognize this new device ( if so , how does it know that , anyway ? )	Ques
1.1.13	Do I need to get them to change *their* settings to allow this new comp .	St
1.1.14	to connect ?	Ques
1.1.15	Or is the LAN broken ?	Ques
1.1.16	Still scratching my head ...	Polite
1.2.1	Where 's the router or such ?	Ques
1.2.2	Bob	St
1.3.1	Turn of the modem and WAIT for 30 minutes or More to release the MAC address Lease.. OR you can call your ISP everytime you change your Computer ( Network adaptor )	St
