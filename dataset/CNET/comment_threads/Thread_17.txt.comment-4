Thank you Kees for your advice.
I checked out crucial.com .
Great site for these kind of things.
I am already deciding about two types of memory.
They are prety the same but they differ with &quot;speed&quot; [first one PC3-8500 ; second one PC3-1060] and in frequency [first one 1066 and second one 1333].
Does these parameters matter a lot?
Can I say, higher the better?
The price si same to the last cent.
Thanks for your help.
Oh BTW, my OS is win 7, 64bit
