1.1.1	Am looking at upgrading my own system .	St
1.1.2	SO I have heard that the motherboard ASUS was one of the best out there .	St
1.1.3	So , what is the difference between the A8N Deluxe and the A8N Premium ?	Ques
1.1.4	TigerDirect has a side by side comparison and it looks like you get more bang for your buck with the Deluxe .	St
1.1.5	But the Deluxe is cheaper so I must be missing something .	St
1.2.1	Premium has heat pipe cooling for mosfets and northbridge .	St
1.2.2	Premium has 1 PCI-e x4 and 1 PCI-e x1 slot .	St
1.2.3	Deluxe has 2 PCI-e x1 slots .	St
1.2.4	Premium *may* overclock a bit more and/or be more stable due to heat pipe cooling .	St
