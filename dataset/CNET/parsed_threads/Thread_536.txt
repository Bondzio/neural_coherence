<s> You need the USB header cable which will connect the reader to the USB ports on the motherboard. </s>
<s> Optional at extra cost. </s>
<s> looking at the picture, the cable shown is the header cable. </s>
<s> You will need the available header port on the motherboard to plug into. </s>
<s> thats the thing the board does not have anything like that </s>
<s> how do i find one of those so far i cant find it </s>
<s> I have a similar unit made by GE. </s>

<s> oh i see this is one of those external readers i kinda wanted to install the internal kind that was in the link i provided but since this is my only option i guess ill try this one thanks for the help </s>
<s> Unless you have a spare USB header on the motherboard, this is your only option. </s>
