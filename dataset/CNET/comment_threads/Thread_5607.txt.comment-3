The PC shut down & tried to reboot but seems to be stuck in a re-boot loop.
I was told by a computer savvy friend that the HD has sort of crashed or the operating system part of it anyway.
So now it wont load up anything.
It gets to the windows loading screen, flicks then reboots again but very very slowly the does that same thing.
It is a 4 year old HP which up until now no similar problems.
