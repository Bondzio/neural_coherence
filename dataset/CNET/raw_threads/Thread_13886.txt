I was brought a computer, that didn't want to start (it turned out to be too much dust on the VGA card and it wasn't working. After I run the PC there came up a problem with the HDD &quot;replace the damaged hard drive&quot; etc. After I replaced it, cleaned the whole pc (it's some old P3) and ran it there was a &quot;hardware error, enter power setup menu for details&quot;. Here's what I find in the power setup menu: VCORE Voltage 1.72V +3.3V Voltage 3.72V (it is in red) +5V Voltage 4.99V +12V Voltage 12.28V -12V Voltage -11.50V -5V Voltage [Ignore] So I guess that the problem is the one, colored in red. I don't understand much, but I think the one in the left is what it should be, and the one in the right is what it is ATM. Can this damage something, or it is too little to worry?

Voltages vary by at least +/- 10% aren't that much but it shouldn't be constantly at those levels, if so then replace with new power supply. Being an older system system, the psu probably saw better days, but the expense of new psu and other repairs suggest to start looking for a newer system when funds are available as problems may crop-up sooner than later. tada -----Willy
