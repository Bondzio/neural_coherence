<s> I would like up upgrade my computer by replacing the motherboard, CPU, RAM and power supply, everything else will stay the same. </s>
<s> I am ruuning Windows Vista home premium. </s>
<s> My question is will I have to re-load Windows Vista? </s>
<s> I upgraded to Vista from XP and only have the upgrade DVD and not the full version. </s>
<s> The price for the hardware is not an issue, but if I have to pay $250 for the full version of Vista that then becomes a problem Thanks Wayne </s>
<s> install xp then vista or install vista and upgrade to vista. </s>
<s> both options will work and allow you to continue.. if you have a full copy of windows xp (and not a upgrade version) then your good to go. </s>
<s> Thanks mementh: I don't have the full version to either one, they are both upgrades that I installed. </s>
<s> Windows will recognize the new hardware and of course run through the wizards to install, but you will likely have to reactivate your copy of windows. </s>
<s> I recently moved my XP hardrive from an old machine to a different mainboard, cpu, ram and psu due to a mainboard failure. </s>
<s> XP detected a significant change in hardware and made me reactivate. </s>
<s> But that only takes a few moments. </s>
<s> Its better to reinstall then to use a old install.. the old drivers could cause issues.. and its just better in the long run </s>
<s> vista handles low-level hardware changes much better than xp. </s>
<s> avoiding a complete reinstall when changing mobo/drive controllers was one of the goals that it actually met. </s>
<s> Thanks for your replies to my question. </s>
<s> My son just told me that he and my grandkids are buying me the full version of Vista Ultimate for Christmas and beings I won't be doing the upgrade until after the holidays there is no problem now. </s>
<s> Thanks again Wayne </s>
<s> problem soved </s>
