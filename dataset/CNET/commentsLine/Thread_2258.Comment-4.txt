hello.
have you looked for a small black square box on the mainboard?
it is an integrated real time clock / battery used on some motherboards.
an example is one that has the brand dallas semiconductors and has a drawing of a clock on it.
i am surprised the cmos battery is depleted on a recent tablet like the hh3.
