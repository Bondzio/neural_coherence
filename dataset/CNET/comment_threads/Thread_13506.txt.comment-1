I am going to be setting up a wireless network for my daughter with 3 computers.
Qwest will be supplying a DSL modem with a wireless router.
The first computer will be connected to the computer with a cat 5e patch cord.
There will also be a laptop and a desktop with wireless connection.
My question is, can the two wireless computers be configured to use the printer that will be hooked up to the wired computer?
I have done printer sharing before, but all computers were hard wired to the router and a network port on the printer.
Can it be done?
and if so how do I set the computers up.
Thanks in advance Wayne
