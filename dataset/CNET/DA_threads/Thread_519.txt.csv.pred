1.2.1	your other computer in network place ... ?	Ques
1.3.1	Since your machines are not in some DNS ( server ) pathping ca n't resolve the names .	St
1.3.2	No failure in my book .	St
1.3.3	- & gt ; The network neighborhood is full of issues .	St
1.3.4	No fix is forthcoming and if you want to spend the money on the phone with support , so be it .	St
1.3.5	However if I want to look at shares and machines I use the COMMAND LINE .	St
1.3.6	Such as ... NET VIEW And the other net commands .	St
1.3.7	Feel free to rant that the Network Neighborhood needs work .	St
1.3.8	Bob	St
1.4.1	I had to go into the firewall section and put my home network range in the trusted zones and then it worked perfectly .	St
1.5.1	Opening network places from the soyo computer shows 2 icons , 1 for the print server ps-429735-p1 and soyodragon .	St
1.5.2	From the computerties computer shows 2 icons , 1 for the print server ps-429735-p1 and the computerties computer .	St
1.5.3	As far as pinging the whole network from either computer that has been covered in the original post .	St
1.5.4	Thanks for taking the time to ask the question .	St
1.6.1	Net view from computer # 1 reads : \\ps-429735 \\SOYODRAGON The command completed successfully Net view from computer # 2 reads : \\COMPUTERTIES \\PS-429735 The command completed successfully As to pathping , I had never heard of the command until this afternoon and personally have no idea what it is supposed to tell me ? .	St
1.7.1	Zone alarm firewall zones include one for 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 and a firewall zone network range of 192.168.0.1 - 192.168.0.254 .	St
1.7.2	That I have had during the times that the network was functional .	St
1.7.3	I have also tried temp killing zone alarm , also my av .	St
1.7.4	To be internet safe , I did this with the satellite server de-powered .	St
1.7.5	Thanks for the suggestion , though .	St
1.7.6	One thing that I forgot to mention to Bob was this problem first showed up after Sony had me reatore the sony XP to its factory state .	St
1.7.7	When I broached this subject to a Sony 2nd tier rep , he gave up and said that networking was not their expertise and that I sould hire a local & quot ; networking specialist & quot ; to aid me .	St
1.7.8	Frankly the last 2 & quot ; specialists & quot ; created more problems that they solved .	St
1.7.9	Well , I shall keep my fingers crossed and keep trying .	St
1.7.10	Thanks again..Charles	St
1.8.1	As a rule I do n't duplicate web content .	St
1.8.2	These are volunteer forums so I leave you to read about this .	St
1.8.3	Bob	St
1.9.1	I have made some progress .	St
1.9.2	I checked the local area connection properties on both computers and the soyo had netbeui protocol .	St
1.9.3	The other one did not so I added that to the other computer .	St
1.9.4	From the ''computerties '' computer , I can now see the soyo computer .	St
1.9.5	When I open workgroup , I get a msg that the Soyo computer is not accessible & gt ; Password has expired .	St
1.9.6	I do n't use passwords , so what do I do now ?	Ques
1.9.7	Have resolved the network issue from the soyodragon computer .	St
1.9.8	Opened sharing for C & D drives on both computers and removed the share names of C $ and D $ and replaced them with C-Drive and D-Drive and the soyodragon is now seeing and opening files and drives on the other computer and copying files .	St
1.9.9	So one computer is fine now .	St
1.9.10	Password error still not resolved as mentioned above .	St
1.9.11	Clicking properties in workgroup of the soyodragon computer icon ( in computerties windows explorer ) returns the msg that I do not have proper access rights .	St
1.9.12	Contact administrator .	St
1.9.13	Which is I .	St
1.10.1	You might need a same username in the win2k computer .	St
1.10.2	If your pc have a username A , then you need to have a user name ( A ) in your win2k computer .	St
1.10.3	Just for testing , make a username ( let 's say A ) in all the computer .	St
1.10.4	( when you ask for username/password , in the network plcace , use that name )	St
1.11.1	I need a little clarification here .	St
1.11.2	The pair of computers that I am trying to network right now are both win2k , which I will ''rename '' Old and New ( for this discussion ) .	St
1.11.3	The New computer sees , opens , and transfers files to the Old .	St
1.11.4	The Old sees , but can not open the network because of the error of expired password ( ? ) .	St
1.11.5	Are you suggesting that I rename each computer the same name so that one computer is named ''Old '' and the other computer is named ''Old '' also ? ?	Ques
1.11.6	I will retain the different urls , though .	St
1.11.7	A trial wo n't take long and if I 've got you wrong then let me know .	St
1.11.8	Thanks	Polite
1.12.1	Does have its passwords expire .	St
1.12.2	Fix ?	Ques
1.12.3	Logon as admin.. and set the password to never expire if that 's your choice .	St
1.12.4	Bob	St
1.13.1	its only password expired .	St
1.13.2	What I mean by having a same name..	St
1.13.3	I mean you need to have a same USER name on the computer .. not the computer name .	St
1.14.1	User name has been the same though most of the time I simply log in as administrator .	St
1.14.2	Changing the password took care of the problem .	St
1.14.3	Thanks to all .	St
1.14.4	Charles	St
