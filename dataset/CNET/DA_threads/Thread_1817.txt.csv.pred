1.1.1	I'd like to state that I don;t know very much about a computer's inner workings so...	St
1.1.2	Here's my question: I have a fairly crappy E310 with 1g RAM and 2.8 processor.	St
1.1.3	I'm trying to upgrade my graphics card, but first I've decided I need a new power supply first, which will be a 400w.	St
1.1.4	All I really want to do is play CounterStrike:Source and Quake Wars.	St
1.1.5	For about 40 bucks.	St
1.1.6	I really dont understand a lot of the specifications for these things so if you could give me some tips or card suggestions (preferably newegg.com) that'd be GREAT, thanks.	St
1.2.1	So this is the list I agree with -&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/10/01/the_best_gaming_graphics_cards_for_the_money/ Bob	St
1.3.1	Thanks for the site and the list, but how do I find if it is indeed a AGP slot?	St
1.3.2	Perhaps the manual?	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	I don't see anything about AGP, just PCI.	St
1.5.2	http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim3100/en/sm/specs0.htm	St
1.6.1	A proper ID of said machine is needed.	St
1.7.1	effective option.	St
1.7.2	The system docs indicate your PC has a PCIe 1X slot and there are PCIe 1X slot video cards.	St
1.7.3	Problem is the choices are narrow and the prices sky high.	St
1.7.4	Here's a link for some PCI cards ...note they are arranged by reviewer ratings...not by price.	St
1.7.5	http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=2010380048+1069609642&name=PCI Here's a link for some PCIe 1X cards http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=2010380048+1069620108&name=PCI+Express+x1 Let us know how it works out.	St
1.7.6	VAPCMD	St
1.8.1	Just wanted to make sure I was clear ...the Dell system docs show 2-PCI slots and 1-PCIe 1X but you need to check to see if they're being used or not.	St
1.8.2	VAPCMD	St
1.9.1	But I have another question.	St
1.9.2	Where it say's &quot;memory&quot; on the card info section does that have anything to do with my RAM?	St
1.9.3	I know what I have is DDR2 but I see video cards that say DDR or GDDR.	St
1.10.1	You asked...&quot;Where it say's &quot;memory&quot; on the card info section does that have anything to do with my RAM?&quot; No...it (usually) refers only to the RAM that comes on the video card.	St
1.10.2	The good thing is going from an onboard GPU (which uses system RAM) to a separate video card which has it's own RAM and leaves the system RAM for the use by the system.	St
1.10.3	It's really a 'twofor'.	St
1.10.4	VAPCMD	St
