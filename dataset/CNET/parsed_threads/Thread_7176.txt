<s> Whenever I play DOS based games and games like NFS Most Wanted and GTA Vice City, my PC's CPU usage goes up to 100% and CPU fan produces a lot of sound. </s>
<s> This does not happen when I use other apps. </s>
<s> Atlast, the system turns off. </s>
<s> I have a PC with Pentium IV processor 512 MB RAM, 80 GB HD, D101GGC Motherboard Please help me with some solutions. </s>
<s> As that's how it is supposed to work there is nothing to fix here. </s>
<s> The CPU FAN is supposed to make more noise in this sort of system. </s>
<s> Again, nothing busted here. </s>

<s> Sounds as if you could stand a hardware upgrade. </s>
<s> Firstly another 512(preferably more) of ram. </s>
<s> A standalone video card, 256mb(512 preferably) and MORE importantly a heavier PSU. </s>
<s> The 100%....normal. </s>
<s> Cpu fan sound....normal. </s>
<s> System turns off....NOT normal. </s>
<s> Perhaps it's time to open the machine and do some cleaning. </s>
<s> Get all the dust out of the machine. </s>
<s> Get all those fans and heat sinks nice and spiffy. </s>
<s> Watch http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-11319_7-6240575-1.html </s>
<s> an underpowered system running taxing games. </s>
<s> What exactly is the processor speed? </s>
<s> It reads to me like it's a DDR SDRam system, thus, is the system meeting the minimum requirements for the games? </s>
<s> As the previous poster have mention, the sytem could do use some upgrade of memory, and powerful power supply unit, and also, better graphic card if you hadn't used one. </s>
