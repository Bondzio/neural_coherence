1.1.1	Hello I have a dell latitude e4300 laptop , windows vista , since I started using WD MyBook 500gb via ESata connection ( built in in the laptops connectors ) my computer started hanging for brief 1-2 second periods every 1-2 minutes when the esata drive is not connected .	St
1.1.2	I have tried to trace this problem to a specific application that may be trying to access the drive when its not connected but had no luck so far using the resource monitor , also i have rolled out heating issues that might be laptop fan related , these hangs only occur whenever that ESata drive is disconnected .	St
1.1.3	i am using the drive as backup .	St
1.1.4	I have also installed avast pro and spy bot search and destroy for threat analysis and have come up with no results .	St
1.1.5	my best guess is that some application or service maybe indexing is trying to access the external esata drive even when its not connected , oh and shutting down the computer and turning it back on does n't help .	St
1.1.6	how do i trace the source of the problem and find find out / fix what 's causing it ?	Ques
1.2.1	If a shortcut in recent documents had a reference to some network drive and the network was offline , these pauses occurred .	St
1.2.2	The cure was to clear the recent documents list .	St
1.2.3	CCLEANER ( see download.com ) can clear those lists for us if you ca n't find them .	St
