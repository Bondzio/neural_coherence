<s> I was wondering how do you wire an RJ45 wall socket after it has been daisy chained. </s>
<s> My friend said that the wires need to be connected for the sockets to work. </s>
<s> For example, cable A is connected in its respected slot and cable B is connected in its respected slot. </s>
<s> How would I connect cable A to cable B? </s>
<s> In fact how would I connect the cables together if there were 4 or 5 cables that need to be connected? </s>
<s> I have a guess that I would need to create some sort of jumper wire between the sockets but I don't want to jump the gun on this one and have to redo all the work. </s>
<s> If more details are required just ask. </s>
<s> I am still new to most of this but working on learning as much as I can. </s>
<s> with a network connection. </s>
<s> Each connector has to be connected to a hub or router. </s>
<s> You cannot &quot;piggy back&quot; a digital connection. </s>
<s> Voice OK, not digital. </s>
<s> Have you noticed that there is no provision on the connector to add another wire? </s>
<s> There's a reason for that. </s>
<s> &quot;You cannot &quot;piggy back&quot; a digital connection. </s>
<s> Voice OK, not digital.&quot; By your statement above it seems to me that you are saying you can connect telephone together? </s>
<s> How would one do that? </s>
<s> Digital no. </s>
<s> Telephones can be daisy chained or home run, your choice as they are all hooked in parallel. </s>
<s> Digital cannot. </s>
