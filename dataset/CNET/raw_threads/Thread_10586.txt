Having no experience with any of the chat platforms or PC video cameras, I am looking for suggestions on which is the best camera/chat combo to use with my daughter and granddaughter. I am in Michigan, she is in Montana. We both have PC's running XP, and both have DSL.

That forum wasn't for posing a question as you may have found out. Why not one of the packages you see everywhere? As to &quot;Best&quot; I think those Macintoshes with the builtin camera to be &quot;best&quot; since you don't have to install the camera or software. It just works. Bob

I have used other Logitech devices and was satisfied. Will the camera come with software so that if I bought two I could connect with my daughter, or will we have to use Messenger, ICQ, Yahoo etc.? If so, which one of those should I use?

Will the camera come with software so that if I bought two I could connect with my daughter, or will we have to use Messenger, ICQ, Yahoo etc.? If so, which one of those should I use? Yes and most end up using either the supplied or one of the packages you listed. I can't say why people choose one over the other. On the Mac they use what it comes with because &quot;it works.&quot; Bob
