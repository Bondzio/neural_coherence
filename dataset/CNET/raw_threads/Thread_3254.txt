206	0	269569	2616467	NR	3151jeff	10/27/07 1:38 PM	1.19349228E12	Overheat ICH area DG965MQ Intel Motherboard	I have a GT5238E Gateway computer with a duo core 1.86, 250 gb hdd, 1 gb memory and a DG965LV (DG965MQ) motherboard and I have a high heat reading in the ICH area (IO controller chip)of between 63 to 105C. The Intel vague specifications for this area is 65C and I suspect I have a fault sensor because I can hold my finger on the chip and it is hot but I am in no danger of burning myself. I would like to attach a heat sink with thermal tape as there are no mounting holes and would like to know if this can be done. This is one of the heat sinks I have been looking at: http://www.ncix.com/products/index.php?sku=24670&vpn=CNB-S1&manufacture=EnzoTech This is gateways picture of my motherboard: http://support.gateway.com/s/MOTHERBD/Intel2/4006153R/4006153Rmv.shtml This is an Intel page on overheating that also shows a diagram of the motherboard heat areas. http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/cs-012552.htm The MCH area (memory controller chip)already has a heat sink attached and does not have this heat problem. My system heat readings are normally CPU-39C, MB-39C, ICH- 63C to 105C, MCH-49C, ambient-42C, fan intake speed 830rpm outlet 800rpm

I'd try adding a small fan 40mm, 50mm or whatever size fits to provide active cooling blowing downward over the HS. Another option might be a case fan located to move outside air directly onto the ICH. VAPCMD

I would rather be safe than sorry and got really worried when I saw the temp at 105C. I then ran the computer with the side off and an external fan blowing on the MB until I added the 60mm fan. The temp I gave you is with the case buttoned up and running normally now

I believe a 100 rpm increase or less would make a substantial difference From what I have read in the Intel site the fans stay pretty much constant until the processor gets to 72C and then goes to full throttle which seems like a poor design to me If you or anyone knows of a way to incrementally increase the (either) fan rpm please let me know, thanks

If the tape isn't sufficient there are other thermal compounds like Arctic Alumina that would easily do the job. http://www.arcticsilver.com/arctic_alumina_thermal_adhesive.htm#aaerev If you need special items like speed controlled fan, fan controllers, CPU heatsinks, etc., there are lots of specialty web sites like Xoxide.com, FrozenCPU.com, CrazyPC.com, Coolerguys.com, etc., Let us know how it works.

If your truly running over 100C then your having some serious problems sooner or later somethings going to give. If this isn't an equipment malfunction then I think the heat is trapped in that corner of the motherboard. Increase air flow in corner. RAM(s) maybe a factor possibly a big one.

It is available at NCIX.com and very reasonable see link: http://www.ncix.com/products/index.php?sku=21935 I have already installed the heatsink and the lowest temperature I can get is still 63C, I suspect there's a problem with the heat sensor, because it is not too hot to touch I already have coolers on my RAM sticks, but appreciate the advice. Thank you so much for the help

206	9	269569	2618810	2616945	3151jeff	10/31/07 3:35 AM	1.1938017E12	I am already running Intel desktop utilities	The desktop utilitie is how I monitor my temperatures as I said before, I suspect I have a sensor problem. The temperature is not been over 63C since I installed the fan, the heatsink did nothing to reduce the temperature any further. Hopefully I'm not looking at failure down the road. I am looking into replacement temperature sensors, just to be sure I appreciate all your help, thanks again

You should be able to pick up something at Radio Shack that could help you get a sense of the temp accuracy. What kind of thermal compound did you end up using ? Any way to afix a fan directly on the heatsink ? VAPCMD

What I did was to mount a heat-sink on the ICH chip but noticed little difference except the temp now never goes over 63C. I used a remote sensor to confirm the temp sensor heat and it showed 45C where as my machine was showing 75C at that time I believe the problem to be a defective sensor which was confirmed by two separate remote sensors. Check for DG965MQ board temp problems in Google and you will see we are not alone. I am happy with the heat-sink and fan I installed which evened out my eratic readings
206	15	269569	2627015	2626964	Dango517	11/10/07 7:30 PM	1.194723E12	Some additional information	I contacted Intel customer support regarding a high CPU temperature problem I was having, I implemented all of there recommendations and was disappointed with all but one. I have added a hard drive cooler and installed it in a spare CD/DVD slot I have and run it with the door propped open. http://www.compusa.com/products/product_info.asp?pfp=SEARCH&Ntt=hard+drive+coolers&N=0&Dx=mode+matchall&Nty=1&D=hard+drive+coolers&Ntk=All&product_code=288618 This dropped my CPU/system temperature by four degrees Centigrade. All the other recommendations failed entirely. It does make a bit of noise. It took about 10 minutes to install and required no tools to install, just plug and play. This may not be your experience, however.
