1.7.1	I ca n't call myself anywhere near a PC expert ( this is what I get for growing up on console video games ) , but I would think that it 's not a problem .	St
1.7.2	All it means is that you ca n't go any higher than 2GB .	St
1.7.3	Nothing preventing you from going below that .	St
1.7.4	That would seem to make sense to me .	St
