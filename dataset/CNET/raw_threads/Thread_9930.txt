I have my computer on for several hours a day, and I think that it is overheating, and when I took the case of my PC, I discovered that there was a lot of dust inside, especially on the fans. Does anybody know what I can do about the dust, or if there are any solutions? If you do, please let me know. Thanks.

Add case filters to air intake vents. Purchase them or fabricate them out of any fine mesh--nylon stocking, ScotchBrite pad, piece of household air filter, etc.

Just beware that you *HAVE* to maintain those filters and clean them, because if those get clogged up they will be worse than just a dusted fan or so, you cut-off the airflow supply. If your system is on the floor or close to it, elevate it at least 6in. or place on stand/small table, etc. to reduce dust pick-up. If you have pets, try to reduce thier dander or understand that can attribute to the dust problem. You wil always have some dust and thus be prepared to maintain at &quot;your cleaning periods&quot; what's best for you. tada -----Willy
