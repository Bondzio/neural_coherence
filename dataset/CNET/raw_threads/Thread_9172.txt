I've hardly used used SCSI for years but I've kept a beige G3 attached to a scanner via SCSI under System 9.0x, just for the odd bit of scanning we do. The G3 video card seems to have crapped out, so my first thought was to attach the scanner to a G4 that still has a SCSI card. But the G4 is now running 10.4 and no longer recognises the SCSI card. (It doesn't show up in the system profile at all.) Sorry, I don't know the make of the SCSI card. I've found a driver/application from VueScan that should get the scanner working. If I can get the SCSI card working, I should be home and dry.

It may(?) show up as something in the System Profiler but if it doesn't, this could mean that it is a defective card. Surely there is a manufacturers name or some other distinguishing mark on the card. P

Their own site doesn't seem to have anything about computer-related products. Anything else I've found on the web seems to be of historical interest only. Any suggestions gratefully received.

Theyalso make scanners, motherboards, CDRoms, DVD burners, just to name a few. However, I cannot find any reference to a SCSI board. Adaptec were always the SCSI board of choice for the Mac and probably still is. They have a 2906 model, part number 1772900, which may be suitable. It mentions OS X (10.1) but it would be worth the price of a free phone call to find out. the card is $65 www.adaptec.com P

Now that you've got me thinking, I may even have an Adaptec SCSI card somewhere. Whether it has OSX support is another issue but it's another route I could try. Cheers.
