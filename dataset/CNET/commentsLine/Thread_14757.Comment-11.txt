i want all the bug fixes and added functionality of the latest firmware.
after struggling with too many failed connections with factory installed firmware, i always update the firmware early in the process.
the idea of not updating motherboard firmware (bios) until you need to is usually good advice, but network hardware and especially routers seem to have trouble keeping up with more rapidly changing standards.
side issue: anyone willing to claim that there is hastily coded firmware on some of these models?
i wonder sometimes.
