Unlikely you will get the just the adapter but they may be sold.
If it is just the cable and not the unit on the end of the cable you should be able to buy any cheap USB cable and splice it.
The wire colors in these seem to be pretty standard so you should be able to match them up.
Soldered would be best but I am sure you can twist the wires together and tape them and they will work.
