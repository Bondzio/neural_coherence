<s> hi,i brought a motherboard ,put it in pluged in everthing i needed to ,but the only thing that happens is the little green light on the motherboard comes on , i asked the guy who i brought the motherboard off,he told me i need to turn the cpu switch to on,what i want to know is were is it ? </s>
<s> hope you can help me </s>
<s> But have him show you this switch and the motherboard and all working. </s>

<s> as the &quot;CPU&quot;. </s>
<s> Perhaps he means the power button. </s>
<s> You said you plugged everything in. </s>
<s> Do you remember wiring the front panel connections part of the motherboard? </s>
<s> Did you double check power switch connection? </s>
<s> The green light means you have the 5v power to latch the power supply to &quot;On&quot; but it doesn't start the computer. </s>
<s> yes i did wire up the power buttons etc but still nothing happens i even got the guy on the phone ( the man who i brought the motherboard off) and we checked everything together.still nothing </s>
<s> With system OFF, do... Find the frt. </s>
<s> panel ON/OFF button and its wire harness. </s>
<s> Follow that wiring to the mtrbd. </s>
<s> where it connects. </s>
<s> Disconnect and then momentarily short those pins and it should try to start. </s>
<s> If it doesn't you got another problem. </s>
<s> If it does start, you got a bad wiring or switch. </s>
<s> Be sure, you locate proper ON/OFF wiring. </s>
<s> Some users confuse ON/OFF(power) with remote power(any other power label) or wake-up connections if so labeled. </s>

<s> http://pinouts.ru/Power/atxpower_pinout.shtml You can try to start the PS from the MB connector as well. </s>
<s> If you have a DVM, you can see if the voltages are there. </s>
<s> I've seen a number of power supplies that show evidence of an attempt to start but shut down immediately. </s>
<s> Watch the PS fan carefully when you try to power up the PC. </s>
<s> If it twitches and stops, this means it attempted to start but shut down do to detecting a load problem. </s>
<s> This is generally a bad power supply or something it's connected to. </s>
<s> Switching power supplies are tricky to troubleshoot as they also don't like to start when not connected to a load. </s>
<s> If you can connect the PS to another MB and the PS starts ok, this usually rules it out as the problem. </s>
<s> It doesn't rule it out as possibly being of insufficient power to operate what it's connected to. </s>
<s> I'd remove all connections to the PS but the MB. </s>
<s> This can also include RAM and CPU if you wish. </s>
<s> If the PS starts ok as evidenced by it's fan continuing to run when it hasn't before, this makes the MB suspect. </s>
<s> It's also not uncommon to have standoffs under a MB causing short circuits if you have it in the case. </s>
<s> You can check this by putting the MB on a table and just connecting things outside the box. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
