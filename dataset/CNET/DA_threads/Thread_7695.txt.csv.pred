1.1.1	Okay so I have dillema I can stick will my Dell Dimension 2350 or I can finsh my system build which is a Aopen AX-34 PGA370 Pentium III-s .Yes I know that the specs on custom are old but i have my ways , so the main reason is the customs mobo has an AGP slot and I just aquired a new EVGA Geforce FX 5700 Ultra , and i also would run that with a PNY FX5200 ( dual monitors .	St
1.1.2	Or i can keep the Dell Dimenions PCI only and update the GPU to a the PNY 8400 gs but its on 64 bit and PCI .	St
1.1.3	Full specs Dell P4 2.00ghz 1gb of DDR 2100 RAM windows xp Radeon 9250 ( upgrade to 8400 gs ) Custom system specs Pentium III-s 1.4ghz ( overclocked ) 1.5gb of PC133 ( overclocked ) 64mb Nvidia TNT ( upgrade to the FX 5700 Ultra , and 5200 ) So what do you thnik would perform better , casual gaming , homework , web browsinf , small video edition , song converting .	St
1.1.4	I know how much better AGP is than PCI ( it 's a x4 slot the FX 5700 is a X4 card ) and it has 1.5gb of ram and PC133 is not much slower than DDR 2100 .	St
1.1.5	Plus the Custom is in athermal take Soprano case with blue leds so its easier on the eyes than the stupid dell case .	St
1.1.6	Thanks for all the help , this is how my budget is going to have to work out for now so i want to be able to play newer games on okay quality ( 800x 600 is okay with me ) , so thanks for your help and I know this is really long .	St
1.1.7	DO N'T TELL ME TO UPDATE I DO N'T WANT TO BLOW THAT MUCH MONEY I CAN SPEND 460 BUCKS MAX SO IT 'S EITHER A NEW GRAPHICS CARD FOR DELL , OR CUSTOM ONLY , NOT A NEW SYSTEM , I NOW THIS IS NOT AN EPIC POWERFUL GAMING MACHINE .	St
1.1.8	thanks , bigboy	Polite
1.2.1	that 's $ 60 not $ 460 sorry typed really late bigboy	Polite
1.3.1	There are too many reasons it will outperform a P3 .	St
1.3.2	I 'll stop here .	St
1.3.3	The fx5700 is a good choice but there are a few things it ca n't do ( I know because we have a few of those cards . )	St
1.3.4	Even the move to the fx6200 would fill in that void and cost the same bucks .	St
1.3.5	Bob	St
1.4.1	Only the Socket 370 's board has an AGP slot the dell dimension ( P4 ) has only PCI , and I know that gaming is more graphics and RAM based , so i still am thinking about the custom P3 , bu if you think sticking with the P4 which is n't a very nice P4 ( 2.0ghz , 400mhz FSB , 512k L2 ) and upgrade it to a Nvidia 8400 gs 64bit PCI then i might do that instead .	St
1.4.2	Just a quick add on its a Pentium 3 s , or server edition so it has 512k L2 just like the P4 .	St
1.4.3	thanks , bigboy	Polite
1.5.1	The improvements in other areas of the P4 CPU .	St
1.5.2	I 'll stop here .	St
1.6.1	do n't stop , explain this to me please so i can make a good decision .	Ques
1.6.2	I understand a lot about PC 's but the CPUs are something that I do n't understand to well , i know the P4 would be better but how much better .	St
1.6.3	bigboy	St
1.7.1	As a rule I 'll stick to the short answer .	St
1.7.2	There is no reason for me to duplicate web content on comparing a P3 to a P4 CPU .	St
1.7.3	That 's been done , overdone and then done again .	St
1.7.4	It 's quite simple as to which one will be the winner .	St
1.7.5	I can only hope you 'll skip the fx5xxx line in favor for any fx6xxx model .	St
1.8.1	the best i could find was a 256mb PNY Geforce 6200 which was running DDR ram , and it 's clock 's were no where near the 5700 Ultra .	St
1.8.2	6200 5700 Ultra Core : 350 Core : 475 mem : 533 Mem : 900 DDR 256mb GDDR2 128mb 64 bit 128bit I also found a 6800 XT but it 's clocks are still worse than 5700 Ultra and it cost $ 70 , it did have 256mb GDDR2 , but it runs slower and their is more memory to deal with so the 5700 Ultra would still be better , so unless i find a 6900 thats better i 'm sticking to the 5700 Ultra .	St
1.8.3	This is by no means the card i 'm staying with but it 's thirty five bucks new , and it will last until March when I plan on getting a 7600GT or 7300GT , i like Nvidia better than ATI .	St
1.8.4	Yes i understand that the P4 would be way better than the P3 or intel would have never released it .	St
1.8.5	But if the P3 system has a more RAM and a way better GPU then it should still out perform the P4 system , right ?	Ques
1.8.6	thanks , bigboy	Polite
1.9.1	I see that many would want to compare clock speeds but let me be short again .	St
1.9.2	The reason to move to the 6xxxx line is very simple .	St
1.9.3	The texture and lighting ( T & L ) that some games use does not exist in the fx5xxxx cards .	St
1.9.4	When I compare cards I head to tomshardware 's VGA charts .	St
1.9.5	If your card is there or a near enough card then you can do the comparison .	St
1.9.6	As to the P4 vs. P3 issue , your choice .	St
1.9.7	Here I 've never seen a P3 win .	St
1.9.8	In closing , you wo n't find me buying the fx5xxx line due to what 's missing .	St
1.9.9	Bob	St
1.10.1	I 'm usiong the P3 board , I KNOW THE P4 IS BETTER , as i stated above the i 'm only using the FX 5700 Ultra for about five months .	St
1.10.2	I am then bying a 7600 GT AGP card .	St
1.10.3	But for the Money the FX is better than the 6xxx series in the same price range ( $ 35 ) .	St
1.10.4	Thanks for all your help , i have already ordered everything to finsh the build , i even got a PCI SATA controler , a 1TB SATA drive ( music videos , pictures , Games ) and a new case and power supply .	St
1.10.5	thankyou , bigoby	St
1.11.1	Just sharing that a dual core system at home has a lowly Nvidia 6600 .	St
1.11.2	Your 7600 is a notch above so I expect you to be very happy with that choice .	St
1.11.3	Bob	St
1.12.1	The Dell needs more Ram ( XP will address up to 3gb ) and a better Video card .	St
1.12.2	Go to NEWEGG or TigerDirect .	St
1.12.3	Forget the PIII .	St
1.12.4	It is likely you will find you do n't have enough USB ports or USB 2.0 for your peripherals .	St
1.12.5	P4 650 3.4Ghz 2Gb Kingston PC400 Value Ram ASROCK LGA 775 Dual-Core Sata 2.0 mb - ABIT SUCKS ! !	St

1.13.1	1gb is max for hardware on the mobo , yes windows reconizes 3.5gb ( 32bit ) but the hardware has limits also .	St
1.13.2	But this no longer matters , Mr. Proffitt has swayed me into getting a new mobo , to get best of both worlds .	St
1.13.3	I ordered a Intel desktop board that supports AGP , my FX 5700 Ultra will work for now , it directly supports my P4 i have now , with overclocking abilities , and has support for 2gb of PC800 RDRAM , i have a 1gb kit of that laying around ( 4x 256mb ) so i can just use that for now , RDRAM is expensive thoe but still way out performs my current DDR , and PC133 , its on par with some lower DDR400 sticks , and yes I will update to the 7300GT ( eVGA that is ) , so thanks for all of your help , exspecially Mr. Proffitt , this computer setup will do just fine until I can save up for my I7 Extremem edition system .	St
1.13.4	LOL Thanks , Bigboy	St
1.14.1	If i overclock the FSB on this will that affect the RAM because I really do n't want that stuff to break since it 's so expensive to replace .	St
1.14.2	I 'm no going to mad overclock the thing , like from 2ghz to maybe 2.2 , and heat wo n't be an issue since i have 6 fans in my case thanks , bigboy	St
