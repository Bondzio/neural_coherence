Hello, We all know the drill: Install a new HDD, go to Disk Management, the Convert Disk wizard pops up.
In another thread, a user recommended not to convert disks if given the option.
I have never clearly understood the difference between Dynamic and Basic disks, and have always chosen Basic as the drive type.
I believe a drive needs to be Dynamic to become a part of a Windows-controlled array, but all the disks I've formatted for all the arrays I have built were formatted as Basic, albeit all are/were controlled by third-party RAID cards.
I am really curious as to what the actual nuts-and-bolts differences are between Basic and Dynamic drives, and when/why to use each.
Thanks all.
Tony
