http://processormatch.intel.com/COMPDB/SearchResult.aspx?Boardname=d975xbx2 How about another MB ?
Abit IP35 PRO gets great reviews everywhere I read..and buyer reviews are good too.
If you stick with the Intel MB...believe they're sensitive to RAM speed.
So if that RAM isn't 1.8V...might want to check too.
Keep us posted.
