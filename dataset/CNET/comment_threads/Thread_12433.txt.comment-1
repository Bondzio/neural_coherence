Hello, I installed a couple of PCI 2.2 compliant devices (ADSL modem and Ethernet adapter) on my old Win95 PC and I can't make them work.
I'm sure drivers are right for my OS, so I think it's because my PCI slots are 2.1 compliant.
Now, I'm looking for a BIOS upgrade.
Here are informations about my mobo and BIOS BIOS Type: Award BIOS Date: 01/16/98 BIOS ID String: 01/16/98-I430TX-ALI5135-2A59ITJAC OEM Signon: IT-586TX1 Ver:1.31N FIGHTER TX ITALIANA TECHNOLOGIE Chipset: INTEL TRITON 430TX REV 1 Super I/O: ALI M5133 REV 0 FOUND AT PORT 3F0H I know my mobo was produced by Totem but their website ( http://www.totem.com.tw ) is no more online.
So I asked a BIOS upgrade to eSupport.com ( http://www.esupport.com ) and they told me they have the right one for $24.95.
Could any of you please answer my questions: - will the BIOS upgrade make my PCI 2.2 devices work with my mobo?
- have I any other way to get the right BIOS upgrade without paying money for it?
Thanks in advance Andrea
