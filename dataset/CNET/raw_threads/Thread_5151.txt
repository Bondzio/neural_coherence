It could well be that the best way to spend a fixed amount of money isn't for a CPU but for a graphic card or extra RAM. Can you tell: - your current video card - your current amount of RAM - two recent games you want to play on this machine Just to be sure you do the best available thing. Kees

You may be surprised that your processor might handle them as that 3500 in the processor name means that it has the equivalent of a 3.5 GHz Pentium 4 speed I believe. Regards, JB (Who is quite happy with his 2.6 GHz dual-core processor)
