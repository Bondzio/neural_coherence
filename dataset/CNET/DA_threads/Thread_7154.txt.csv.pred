1.1.1	Hello all !	St
1.1.2	The time has come for me to upgrade my old noisy and jerky HP Deskjet 640c printer .	St
1.1.3	I have done a little reseacrh and I think that a Canon Pixma would be the best for me .	St
1.1.4	I need an AIO for upto a Maximum of $ 150 .	St
1.1.5	I will be using it at home .	St
1.1.6	I dont think I will be printing a lot of pictures .	St
1.1.7	The only pictures will be printed on normal A4 size paper for school projects .	St
1.1.8	I will almost never use glossy photo paper .	St
1.1.9	I think I an live without fax as I have never used it but I would use it a bit if my printer has one .	St
1.1.10	Scanning negatives would be a privilege so that I can digitize years of pictures .	St
1.1.11	I can however live without it as I have all along .	St
1.1.12	The main features I would like to concentrate on is text printing .	St
1.1.13	It should be cheap and fast to do so .	St
1.1.14	Preferably with a special text only cartridge .	St
1.1.15	Networking would be a very nice feature for ease of use but if it is possible to connect a laptop or an 'outsider ' computer easily then networking does not matter .	St
1.1.16	Will it be possible to print a pdf or Word doc from an SD card or USB flash drive on either of these printers , while choosing which pages to print or giving it the pages numbers .	St
1.1.17	An automatic document feeder would be really good while a flat bed is included .	St
1.1.18	Noise can become an issue for me .	St
1.1.19	My friend has a Pixma as well and he mentioned a quiet mode .	St
1.1.20	This feature should be included so that I can print at night .	St
1.1.21	Optical Chrachter Recognition should also be included .	St
1.1.22	I cant list all the required features here .	St
1.1.23	For this reason I would appreciate it , if someone thorough with the Canon Pixma range 's , can list out all the features that make a difference between the printers .	St
1.1.24	Thank You	St
1.2.1	I have done some more research and boiled down to the MP530 and 600 .	St
1.2.2	I would appreciate it if you could suggest some more printers from other brands or the same pixma line .	St
1.2.3	I would also like to know the differences between the mp 530 and 600 .	St
1.2.4	Thank You and plz respond .	St
1.3.1	First off , the Canon line is the best inkjet printer out there for home users today .	St
1.3.2	If you look at the cost , features , and cost of cartridges , they are top .	St
1.3.3	Plus the Quality is good .	St
1.3.4	The 530 has a Fax , the 600 does n't .	St
1.3.5	That is the main difference .	St
1.3.6	HP has some decent ones if you get one that takes the 96 black and 97 color .	St
1.3.7	Other than that , there is n't one I can recommend .	St
