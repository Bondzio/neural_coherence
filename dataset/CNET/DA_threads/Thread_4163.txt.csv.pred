1.1.5	My Lenovo SMPS has a 2-pin Power slot for the Lenovo LCD-TFT Monitor.	St

1.1.7	Or else then what should i do now?	St
1.2.1	If it isn't connected to anything on the motherboard, I don't see why there should be a problem.	St
1.2.2	~Ibrahim~	St
1.3.1	My Lenovo LCD-TFT Monitor is connected to that slot ,because the lenovo monitor gets the power from that slot present on the PSU Now what should i do ?	Ques

1.4.2	It is, but a small form factor desktop.	St
1.4.3	I was kind of confused there, lol.	St
