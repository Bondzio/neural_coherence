So this morning I turn on my computer to find that my third HDD (1TB SATA Seagate) is not reading. I found out later on that it is for sure the HDD and not the motherboard because I switched SATAs with my other HDD and the computer was still not recognizing the HDD. I was wondering if anyone out there has any suggestions on how to fix this problem? I was also wondering if it could be changed into a external HDD if thats a possible solution. I'm running on Windows Vista 64 bit Also I was wondering if its not possible to use it as a HDD is it possible to recover the data in there without going to those super expensive data recovery places. Any suggestions would be much appreciated.
