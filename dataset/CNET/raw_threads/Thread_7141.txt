I'm only using the one that is built in to the computer. The Windows display control shows two monitors. The first has very limited display settings and the second one has much more, but I can't seem to change my primary monitor. I have a Mobility Raden 9000 display adapter, but the control program will not let me change the primary monitor or any monitor schemes. Can someone help me?
