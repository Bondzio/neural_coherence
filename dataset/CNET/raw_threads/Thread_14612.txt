We have since bought a new laptop and would like to see if we can recover the data off the old Desktop internal hard drive. (I am assuming that there is no problem with the old drive). What is the easiest way to retreive that old data from old computer? Is there a way to make the old drive a USB drive? Maybe make it a slave drive? (not sure if that is right terminology.... Any easy suggestions would be helpful! Thanks! Ian
