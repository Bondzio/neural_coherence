Thank you for your reply but I still don't know how to set the jumper setting on the old drive - Western Digital drive.
Maxtor did include the 80 conductor cable.
They did tell me to set both drives to CS/cable select.
But where is cable select?
Their drive has a 5-pin selection.
If I set to slave but I'm afraid of data loss, or whatever.
with much appreciation ron stebbins
