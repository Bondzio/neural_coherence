i have a linksys system right now, i tried the n range thing but that didnt work as good as it sounded.
then i tried the n range and the range expansion from linksys and still that did not work that good.
i would get signal then it would go away then come back.
what i really would like is a strong enough signal for my ps3 which has a built in wifi signal.
i tested it out next to the router and it worked but i want the ps3 in tv room not the computer room.
thanks
