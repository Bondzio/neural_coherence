<s> I have dual ethernet ports on my asus a8r32 board. </s>
<s> I am trying to configure it so that I can use both ports for internet. </s>
<s> RIght now, I can only connect one port so that my computer can use the internet and connect to my home network. </s>
<s> Is there a way that I can set up the second port as an OUT source so that I can hook up my laptop to it through an ethernet cable to get internet as well? </s>
<s> RIght now, when I connect my laptop to the second ethernet port, I get a connection popup but it says that it is limited and I can't connect to the internet. </s>
<s> It &quot;senses&quot; my computer but I can't acces the internet. </s>
<s> Can anybody help me? </s>
<s> Or am I just thinking wrong and you can't output internet connection. </s>
<s> If you are using a router, it will share Internet with all computers on your home network. </s>
<s> If you don't have a router, you can connect an ethernet crossover cable between the machine with Internet access and the laptop. </s>
<s> This requires available network interface cards on both. </s>
<s> Then run the network setup wizard on both machines starting with the desktop. </s>
<s> Use the same workgroup name on all computers. </s>
<s> Enable Internet Connection Sharing and File/Printer sharing. </s>
<s> This will assign a static IP address of 192.168.0.1 to the desktop. </s>
<s> The last octet of the laptop IP address will vary with use; 192.168.0.xxx. </s>
