1.1.1	I have a Dell Dimension 8200 and am looking into the best way to back up my system .	St
1.1.2	Since my memory is not the best , I would like to be able to set this up with the minimal effort .	St
1.1.3	I need this to mainly back up business data , but the holiday snaps might be a good idea too .	St
1.1.4	I 've been looking into a number of things , thinking that a RAID 1 Solution would be the best , mirroring all the data I have .	St
1.1.5	I 'd looked at the Western Digital Pro/Premium II , NAS devices , external SATA drives , people at work mention that all I would need to do would be to add a Hard Drive to my machine and do either Software Raid or if the machine supports it Hardware Raid .	St
1.1.6	I 'm just wondering what the best solution would be , if there is any special software that I should be using .	St
1.1.7	Willing to spend up to $ 600 to get this in place and would like the solution to not effect the performance of it too much .	St
1.1.8	Any help would be gratefully received .	Polite
1.1.9	Cheers , Stuart	St
1.2.1	If you restart your computer everytime you use it , you can write a 'batch file ' that is placed in your startup folder that can copy data from one drive to another .	St
1.2.2	That other folder could be another computer accessed through a network .	St
1.2.3	I do n't have that great of memory , but I get by through using a dvd burner every month .	St
1.2.4	Thats all I need becuase my data doesnt change dramitically every few days .	St
1.2.5	A raid 1 will only help if your computer crashes becuase of bit rot , or a defective drive .	St
1.2.6	Usually data is lost becuase of user error , an incomplete backup before an OS reinstall .	St
1.2.7	You want a backup solution that is out of the case of your computer and most preferably off the same fuse ( In case of electrical surge ) .	St
1.2.8	Good luck finding an easy way to backup data .	Polite
1.3.1	unless you 're running xp pro , you wo n't have a software raid option .	St
1.3.2	software raid will affect performance but if you 're main concern is 'backup ' ( rather than fault-tolerance ) then raid is overkill .	St
1.3.3	a backup solution will protect your data AND allow you restore old items ...	Sug
1.3.4	RAID will not help you if you delete something and find you need it a few days or few months later .	St
1.3.5	the maxtor one-touch and western digital mybook both come with automatic backup software for far less than $ 600 .	St
