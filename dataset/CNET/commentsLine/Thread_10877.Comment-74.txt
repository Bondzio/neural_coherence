there's nothing i can say but, yes, it's no longer a concern, as to &quot;wearing out&quot; an ssd if the page file is on the same drive (or any other ssd in the system)... but, to suggest that windows won't run (and perform well) with the page file set to zero is also absurd.
with typical use, (how 99% of people use their computers) most people would not notice a difference.
nevertheless, i apologize for the incorrect advice as relates to setting the page file to zero!
