What is everyone's opinion on the advantages of an SLI or Crossfire setup?
Would I be better off building my new computer with say 2 7600 256 cards or getting 1 7900 card with maybe 512mb?
Also how hard is it to add a 2nd card later if I were to get a more powerful single card installed from the factory and then add another in 6 months when it is cheaper?
