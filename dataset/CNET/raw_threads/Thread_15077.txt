Out of the box BSOD when running on battery and/or pressing the fan button. Sent it back. A week and half later it came back, still not working. Sent it back again. A week and half later it came back, still not working. Russell Stein said was the memory.. he sent out some new memory. Didnt fix the issue. Sent it back. A week and half later it came back, still not working. They sent me a *newly built* machine. Same problem. Sent it back. Two weeks later it came back, still finally working. 5 Deliveries. 5 Collections. 2 months waiting without a laptop. Hours on the phone and writing emails. They even tried to offer me a mug as a good will gesture. IN the end all I got out of them was a set of speakers and a mouse. The most disgusting level of service and performance I have ever encountered.

Piece parts, yes, I feel like I own stock. But a machine, I want to take it to the store and shove it in someone's face.

I'm looking to buy a basic desktop PC which I would use to do email; surf the web; some word processing as well as some Quicken. I wouldn't be using such a PC to play games or to do videos. If you wouldn't buy any PC from a bricks and mortar store would you purchase the necessary parts from an online store and build one instead? Feedback would certainly be appreciated.

Stick with the &quot;big guys&quot; HP, Compaq (same co. now) or Sony. Reasoning that they do have a well established support system in place and most anyone is familiar with their products. Stay away from anyone's $400 PC's though, in my opinion anyway. You'll maybe need 512MB of RAM, 100GB hard drive and not a high end CPU. Something on the order of a Sempron 64 3200+. In my opinion, again, Intel systems just don't cut it, AMD systems work faster. I have had both and am using a self built and a Compaq pre-built, both with AMD's running things. As for retailers, Walmart in my area usually has low prices, but NO in-storegeeks to help you. Check Best Buy and Circuit City or Frye's if you are near one. Good luck!

So-called computer purists nay argue against them, but you can't beat them for the money. Deffinitely worth looking into for a basic PC that will be used for light home use, won't break the bank, and is backed by _great_ tech support. Due to this great tech support, Dell has learned where they went wrong with their older computers and made them a hell of a lot more reliable. Just my two cents.
