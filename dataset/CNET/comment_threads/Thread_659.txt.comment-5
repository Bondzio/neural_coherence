The problem maybe your video card/port as it gets heated, it becomes stressed out.
Games will demand alot of the system resources and once into the upper demands can fall down quite quickly.
You can try to better cool the system or video directly if possible.
However, if you put the resolution down abit during gaming or just lower the expections, you get along longer before a problem or goes away and if that the case, then you see where the problem lies.
