need a little help.
well for one i have a hp a305w.
i have a problem on it where for some reason the atx power connecter cant be in all the way or the cmoputer will turn on but the motherboard wont recieve any power.
besides the point i was wondering what kind of motherboard i could the most bang for my buck.
i hate intel so i would rather go that way then intel just because i hate them and they suck.
also im going to get a new case simply for the fact that its an oem case and they tend to look nice but are very cramped so im going to get a new case too.
also im going to need a new processor with that motherboard.
just wondering what kinda advice someone could maybe give me.
