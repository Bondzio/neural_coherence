So figured I'd go with what everyone says it one of the best brands - LG. Anyone know whats the difference between the identically appearing 22&quot; models from BestBuy (L226WTQ-BF) or the internet (L226WTY-BF)? BestBuy Newegg Thanks

I'm not sure but the cynic in me believes it gives them an out for that famous low price guarantee. These units are often missing a feature or two. So unless you're into immediate gratification, go with the unit from Newegg.
