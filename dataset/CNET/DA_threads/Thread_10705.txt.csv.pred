1.1.1	Total newbie to wireless here .	St
1.1.2	Just got a laptop with Intel PRO/Wireless 2011B LAN PC Card that is supposed to give my laptop wireless capability .	St
1.1.3	Questions : 1 .	St
1.1.4	Will this card work OK for hooking up to hotspots while roaming ?	Ques
1.1.5	2 .	St
1.1.6	Does it work both 802.11b as well as 802.11g modes ?	Ques
1.2.1	You said that you hot a Intel PRO/Wireless 2011B LAN PC Card More on your wireless card here http : //support.intel.com/support/wireless/wlan/pro2011b/lanpccard/ You will have wireless capabilities .	St
1.2.2	You will have the b capabilities , meaning your connection speed will be slower than a g connection .	St
1.2.3	I found this and it might help to explain things better .	St
1.2.4	The 802.11b wireless networking standard was the first widely available wireless networking solution that users could buy ; the vast majority of public wireless spaces , including coffeehouses and restaurants and the like , use the 802.11b standard .	St
1.2.5	It uses the 2.4 Ghz frequency for communication , and the fastest speed an 802.11b user can theoretically have is 11 Mbps .	St
1.2.6	The 802.11a and 802.11g standards both offer a higher theoretical maximum speed of 54 Mbps .	St
1.2.7	However , nearly half of that is used for routine communication between your computer and the wireless access point it 's communicating with , not for transfer of your data requests .	St
1.2.8	24 Mbps is the highest speed that wireless cards are required to support .	St
1.2.9	The 802.11a standard uses the 5.5 Ghz frequency , a signal which is less used by other devices ( a bonus for wireless network users ) but the signal strength drops off more quickly as you go farther from the access point .	St
1.2.10	However , because there 's less interference , it may be easier to design good 802.11a coverage than 802.11b or 802.11g coverage in a given area .	St
1.2.11	All in all , though , 802.11a is currently the least common type of wireless network installation .	St
1.2.12	The 802.11g standard shares the 2.4 Ghz frequency with the 802.11b standard , but 802.11g provides the higher theoretical maximum speed of 54 Mbps .	St
1.2.13	Since they share the same frequency , many networking cards that support 802.11g also support 802.11b .	St
1.2.14	This is good for users who travel from network to network , since 802.11b is still the most commonly available type of wireless networking .	St
1.2.15	However , having a user with an 802.11b card in an 802.11g network slows the maximum speed of all the wireless network 's users to the 11 Mbps 802.11b standard .	St
1.2.16	Hope this helps .	St
1.2.17	Rick	St
1.3.1	It helps a lot .	Polite
1.3.2	Thanks for the info .	St
1.3.3	Looks like I 'm going to get another card that will work both the 802.11g and 802.11b modes .	St
