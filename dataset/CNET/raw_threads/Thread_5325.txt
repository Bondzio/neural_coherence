Hey guys, i have following questions about my pc. 1.What can i use to clean the dust of the components and the case, i normally used a normal vacuum but now i read it can damage the components. 2. One of the side panels are falling off due to the glue failure, what glue can i use to get it back on, and that will last, the panel is pretty heave since its aluminium. 3. How can i upgrade to 3.0 USB from 2.0 USB. I have a DELL XPS 730X 1.Intel core i7 920, 2.67 GHz 2.Ram 6bg ddr3 at 1066mhz 3.Nvidia GTX280 4.Western Digital 500gb 5.Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi Thank you guys!

Also I have never seen a case where glue are use for the side panel (some detail is missing here), I probably would go with epoxy. As for usb 3.0, see what connection is available on the computer then get a usb3 adapter for it. I would think pcie 4 or 16 or sata connection should do it.

Don't &quot;weeeee&quot; the fans or blow-off the jumpers. I suspect you use the vacuum cleaner in &quot;blower&quot; mode should be an issue. 2. One of the side panels are falling off due to the glue failure, what glue can i use to get it back on, and that will last, the panel is pretty heave since its aluminium. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Any decent glue or some expoxy should do, follow it instructions. there nothing to stop you from &quot;jerry-rigging&quot; a solution. 3. How can i upgrade to 3.0 USB from 2.0 USB. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you have an empty slot install a USB 3.0 card of good quality, don't be cheap, as they have issues you'll soon find out otherwsie. tada ------Willy
