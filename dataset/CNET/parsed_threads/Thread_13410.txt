<s> What is the best ipod car audio device which i can use to connect my ipod to the car stereo so that i can play the songs in my ipod? </s>
<s> I have one for another player. </s>
<s> It cost 20 bucks and seems ok. </s>
<s> I would call it &quot;best&quot; but quite nice. </s>
<s> Call me old fashioned but I find CDs to still be what I use most of the time in the car. </s>

<s> Does anyone else know of something i can use to connect my ipod to my car? </s>
<s> I saw a few, the one that you connect a cassette to the ipod and you can play the songs on your ipod. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Connects to the back of the Car OEM radio like a CD Changer and uses the same controls on the dash like a changer. </s>
<s> The power from the car keeps the iPod charged and the sound quality is first rate. </s>

<s> I was looking for something cheaper. </s>
<s> I saw some cassette that you can connect to the ipod and use that to play it in the car. </s>
<s> I was looking for something that is under $30. </s>
<s> Hi, I was quite thrilled on seeing the 'Aux In' availale in my BMW 'for iPod'. </s>
<s> It is supposed to integrate with the OEM CD player. </s>
<s> But no one knows where to get the required lead to connect the two. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> ...have this in my '03 Honda Accord. </s>
<s> Can operate my iPod from my steering wheel. </s>
<s> You can jump between the first 6 playlists available (I renamed my preferred ones with ''01, 02, etc. </s>
<s> to help me remember which would be those 6). </s>
<s> Audio quality beats anything I could get with my Griffin-branded FM transmitter and no conflicts with local FM stations. </s>

<s> You could always get a Honda Jazz, then you just need a cable :P And, if you want to look like a right pillock, get it in bright and garish pink, yay! </s>
<s> I've used both the Belkin and the Griffin i-trip. </s>
<s> Both cost about $35-40. </s>
<s> The Griffin wins hands down because of sound quality and that it runs entirely off your i-pod battery, so it doesn't run out of battery juice prior to the ipod. </s>
<s> If you spring for another $30 bucks you can get a power jolt for your car and run the whole mess off your lighter plug. </s>
<s> Easy enuf! </s>

<s> Many people have no heard for Peripheral Electronics. </s>
<s> With this company, you install a module that does a few things at once and all without buying after market head unit. </s>
<s> First of all, it connects through the display and allows you to browse your library with programmed buttons on the head unit. </s>
<s> Next, the module charges your iPod at the same time as listening to it to keep your battery full while enjoying the music. </s>
<s> Also, the module allows you to experience high quality sound as if you just had a CD in. </s>
<s> If any questions, feel free to PM or reply </s>
<s> These head unit (radio) adapter units from Peripheral, and those from another manufacturer called P.I.E. </s>
<s> are said to work very well with iPods and iPhones. </s>
<s> However, a handful of different models are now available so make sure you select the correct adapter for your vehicle and iPod/iPhone combination. </s>
<s> The newest adapters use a single, direct-connect cable with the newest vehicles and allow you to control the newest iPods and the original or 3G iPhone using the vehicle's radio or steering wheel controls -- and supports charging at the required 5 volts (also used for USB). </s>
<s> But first-generation Peripheral and P.I.E. </s>
<s> direct-connect adapters may have 12-, 13-, or 14-pin connectors and thus, only control older iPods that support charging at 12 volts (like Firewire). </s>
<s> This means that a given direct-connect Peripheral or P.I.E. </s>
<s> adapter may or may not work with the newest iPods and iPhones. </s>
<s> In those instances, you have to connect to the iPod/iPhone using a Peripheral or P.I.E. </s>
<s> AUX adapter AND an RCA-to-3.5mm (mini jack) audio cable. </s>
<s> This means you won't have radio or steering wheel controls, and you'll have to operate the iPod or iPhone directly. </s>
<s> But this approach also does work when using iPods and iPhones with some of the older vehicles...Any of these provides far better connectivity and audio quality than a cassette tape or FM adapter. </s>
