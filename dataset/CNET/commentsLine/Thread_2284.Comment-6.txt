the imacs come with decent graphics cards but not as good if you spent $300+ on an after-market card.
the latest intel macs come with better graphics cards.
if you get an imac, i don't think you will be able to change the graphics cards.
you can do this if you get a mac pro tower.
the imac graphics cards get better with larger displays.
