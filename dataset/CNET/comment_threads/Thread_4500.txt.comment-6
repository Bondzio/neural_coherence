Thank you for the advice.
I am planning to get a new computer, but I would rather get a newer car (7900 GTX or 1900 XTX) or even SLId or Crossfired cards.
Anyway, if I was to upgrade my computer, which of these cards: X800, X1300, X1600 or any other AGP cards you think are good should I upgrade my computer with?
