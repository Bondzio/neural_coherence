when i need to extend my range i've used a common router but set it up as a wap.
this is covered in the cnet networking forum sticky as well as google &quot;how to use a router as a wap.&quot; with that out of the way, i place this wap where it gets the best shot at reaching my other location.
now on the other side i can use a gaming bridge or a bridge that i used many times as a wifi client is the wgps606 the gaming bridge or wgps606 is also placed where it has the best shot at connecting to the wap (which i used a common router) and at that point i can test connectivity by plugging into the bridge's ethernet ports.
if i want to get wifi coverage in that area i add one more router as a wap and i'm done.
that's my formula that i've used too many times.
due to failures of those &quot;bridges&quot; i had to come up with something that i could make work.
