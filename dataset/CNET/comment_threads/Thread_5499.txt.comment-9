It's not too tough, it just takes patience... and having someone very knowledgeable goes a long way!
I got some good advice from the guys at the Abit forums, but what really opened it up was the advice I got after joining the Abit Wolves Fold@Home Team.
You don't necessarily need to have an Abit board to join, we have our own forums with restricted sections for members.
There are several VERY knowledgeable guys that you can ask any number of questions, from selecting components to RAM settings to voltages.
There's always a risk with overclocking, but the more you know, the more you can manage it.
Temps and voltage are the things that you really want to keep an eye on - if they get out of hand, it'll shorten the lifespan of your equipment - That's why I usually run at 260*10, because it's the highest I cane run without bumping the voltage from the stock range.
It can certainly be run higher with a little more voltage and still be in the low-risk range, but my CPU is ALWAYS at 100% load and I never turn my rig off... As far as CPU cooling - the stock coolers with the Opterons are actually pretty good - it's a 4 heat-pipe design.
If you want to cool things down a little more, there's the Zalman CPNS 9500 - it's one of the better aircoolers out there.
