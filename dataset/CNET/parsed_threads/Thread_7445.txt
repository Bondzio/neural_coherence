<s> On a Dell vostro 200 desktop computer that is less than two years old, the O/S [Windows XP Home] boots up to the sign on screen but at this time both the mouse and keyboard are inoperative. </s>
<s> Both the mouse and keyboard are USB devices. </s>
<s> This model pc does not have PS2 connections. </s>
<s> Neither mouse nor keyboard will work when booting up in SAFE MODE either. </s>
<s> Suspect corruption to critical file due to infestation of virus. </s>
<s> I am unable to determine specific files needing scrutiny. </s>
<s> I am able to boot the system up in the Recovery Console mode. </s>
<s> I also was able to inert a different hard drive and install the same O/S successfully. </s>
<s> I then returned the defective O/S drive to the PC and was able to scan it for viruses. </s>
<s> Found multiple viruses and successfully removed. </s>
<s> Removing the new drive and returning the original hard drive to the PC, I still get freezing at sign on screen. </s>
<s> The desire is to enable the original hard drive capable of booting up due to applications on that specific drive not available on second drive. </s>
<s> try connecting your USB devices: mouse and keyboard at the back of your computer (the USB port built in with the motherboard) not the USB ports that are extended and housed in you casing. </s>
<s> If the USB port on the motherboard works, then that means the connection of the extension USB ports that are located on your casing may have been loose or disconnected. </s>
<s> If it still doesn't work then it's either your mouse and keyboard is deffective or your motherboard needs replacement. </s>
<s> To be able to take care of your PC components, you must understand them well. </s>

<s> Thanks for responding to my post. </s>
<s> Perhaps I did not make myself clear. </s>
<s> I replaced the original hard drive with an identical one [same manufacturer, same size, same model] and I installed the same O/S. </s>
<s> everything worked. </s>
<s> When I removed the new drive and replaced the old drive, the problem shows up. </s>
<s> There is nothing wrong with the motherboard, USB ports, mouse or keyboard. </s>
<s> The problem exists within the O/S for the original hard drive. </s>
<s> I do not want to reinstall the O/S to the original drive because I will then loose critical files. </s>
<s> I need to be able to find the problem with the original drive's O/S and repair withiut having to reformat it. </s>
<s> That's called an advanced Windows repair. </s>
<s> If we are lucky to catch it soon enough we can use System Restore. </s>
<s> If we let it go we know we can try the usuals like &quot;XP REPAIR INSTALL&quot; as well as installing the drivers for the machine in the CORRECT ORDER. </s>
<s> I find many still can't write down the right order. </s>
<s> Since I clone the OS to another drive I can test this on the copy without endangering the original. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> For a price, Dell or Microsoft can provide more support about this than you may find on forums. </s>
<s> You should run the virus scanner again in safe mode with networking option. </s>
<s> That way, you're able to access CD/USB drives with pgms., of course update the scanner with the latest. </s>
<s> Next, if you haven't already, reboot after that. </s>
<s> if it works, great if not, do you still have &quot;restore feature-ON? </s>
<s> In many cases, if you tried the restore feature to working date and any malware comes back, disable restore feature(will delete restore points) to remove the &quot;rehatching area of malware&quot;, very common. </s>
<s> Repeat the scan process and then reboot. </s>
<s> If you can enter the OS, use the SFC command from run, otherwise you're stuck in trying a OS repair from the OS recovery(install) discs. </s>
<s> You may had multiple problems and get stuck resolving more than meets the eye, so it gets time involved. </s>
<s> If you like, remove old HD and try recovering critical data on another system if malware free. </s>
<s> If successful, then reformat old HD for re-use. </s>
<s> IMHO, you have no easy answer. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Go to DELL,and download the manual. </s>
<s> Look on Pg 180 on how to remove the password. </s>
<s> That might help, as you said it was stopping on &quot;the sign on screen&quot;. </s>
<s> It's a simple jumper, but you need to follow the procedure. </s>
