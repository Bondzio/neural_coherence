1.1.1	I 've got a friend who 's made an usual request .	St
1.1.2	His wife has an old Compaq Presario 5095cl .	St
1.1.3	Seems she want to keep it but he 's talked her into upgrading the machine .	St
1.1.4	I 've made several suggestions that should occur such as a new power supply and HDD along with a new MoBo , memory and CPU .	St
1.1.5	The specs are a 200Mhz bus and she has a 900Mhz AMD duron chip .	St
1.1.6	I 'm not finding much on the MoBo online .	St
1.1.7	I suppose it 's just too old .	St
1.1.8	The husband and I are not in the same location as the computer , so I have no means to & quot ; climb inside & quot ; and take a look .	St
1.1.9	I feel it 's safest to ensure the new board is the same size as the old one and the holes line up to mount the thing .	St
1.1.10	Does anyone have any suggestions on boards ?	Ques
1.1.11	I 've tried endlessly to talk them both into buying a new computer , but that has fallen on deaf ears .	St
1.1.12	Suggestions on boards anyone ?	Ques
1.2.1	( buy one with embedded sound and video ) with new CPU and memory , combined with a new PSU and a new hard disk , in essence is a new PC in an old case .	St
1.2.2	Why not add a DVD-burner to replace the CD-ROM ?	Ques
1.2.3	Then all is new !	St
1.2.4	It might be cheaper to buy everything new , including the case , if you can get a nice deal .	St
1.2.5	And it certainly is less work .	St
1.2.6	Kees	St
1.3.1	That thing is from 2001 .	St
1.3.2	Wally-mart ... 400 bucks ... .10x the machine .	St
1.3.3	If the user insist on keeping the machine .	St
1.3.4	Consider a ram upgrade .	St
1.3.5	Waste of money in my opinion ... but it might make the user happy .	St
1.3.6	HP says that machine comes with 128MB of ram with a max of 768MB .	St
1.3.7	If the user is running w98 bump the ram to 256 .	St
1.3.8	If the user is running XP bump the ram to the max .	St
1.4.1	Kees , thanks but I 'm more after brands or types .	Polite
1.4.2	Abit versus Gigabyte , for example .	St
1.4.3	I have no clue what the board is inside , but I ca n't make a suggestion to my colleague without know what 's inside the case .	St
1.4.4	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.5.1	I am guessing that the lady in question has become very familiar with her Presario .	St
1.5.2	She knows where her files are , she knows how to plug her camera and mp3 player into it , she nows how to install a new CD program into it .	St
1.5.3	SHE KNOWS IT .	St
1.5.4	That is why she wants to keep it .	St
1.5.5	Upgrading it is NOT a waste of time or money .	St
1.5.6	As a matter of fact her machine will do pretty much everything a new one will .	St
1.5.7	It can download off the internet at 100MPS if she likes .	St
1.5.8	It can send email .	St
1.5.9	It can display photo ablums , it can play cds and mp3s .	St
1.5.10	It can display in svga .	St
1.5.11	It can accept a DVD burner .	St
1.5.12	Will XPsp2/3 with all of its heavy and burdeonsome network interfacing , security for such , and background services , most of which she will NEVER use , be slower on her machine ?	Ques
1.5.13	Sure .	St
1.5.14	Will Vista with its shiny display but ram killing requirements be more than her system can handle ?	Ques
1.5.15	Undoubtedly .	St
1.5.16	But so what .	St
1.5.17	I do n't put a Ferrari v12 in my Honda because I 'm not racing in a Grand Prix .	St
1.5.18	As a matter of fact , most of the users here that have high end machines will admit they do so primarily to PLAY GAMES .	St
1.5.19	Maybe she has other games she plays besides those on a computer ( soccer with kids , candyland with pre-schooler , etc ... ) Max out the Ram .	St
1.5.20	Find a decent graphics card .	St
1.5.21	Max out the CPU for its socket type .	St
1.5.22	All three wo n't cost maybe $ 175.00 total .	St
1.5.23	Double check HP\Compaq 's site info against the motherboard 's own site .	St
1.5.24	I have found several discrepancies in the past , especially with FIC produced boards .	St
1.5.25	A good air clean for the power supply , maybe add a system case fan , and perhaps drop & quot ; themes & quot ; setting to a performance stance from appearance , and her husband gets his upgrades , she keeps her computer , they stay married !	St
1.6.1	Use the scheduled tasks to automate computer maintenance and software upgrades for her machine .	St
1.6.2	The casual computer user ( i.e .	St
1.6.3	email , photos , mp3 , websurf-casts , and solitaire ) believe their machine to be slower than it used to be , or perhaps slower than the one their friend has , because it is broken or infected .	St
1.6.4	In fact , most often it needs only to have its scheduled tasks set up to self maintain the HDD , Registry , and Antivirus protocols .	St
