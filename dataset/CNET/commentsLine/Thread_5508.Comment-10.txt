i had the same problem with the same wd external drive.
the answer was very simple.
the battery of my laptop was too weak to operate the power for the external hard drive.
but it worked perfectly with my desktop using external ac.
another solution may be the cable connecting the external hard drive.
use only the original cable supplied with the device.
