1.1.1	I keep getting this message , even though the cable is NOT disconnected .	St
1.1.2	I successfully had a home network for about two years , and then suddenly this message popped up.. On the host computer , it only happens to the card that I 'm using for the network , but on the other computer it happens to both cards .	St
1.1.3	I 've replaced the cards , swapped the cables around , and even replaced the Cat 5 cable .	St
1.1.4	Nothing has helped .	St
1.1.5	Can anybody give me some more suggestions please ?	Ques
1.2.1	& quot ; If you are referring the Balloon tip , they can be removed in TweakUI .	St
1.2.2	Install Tweakui and go to Task and Start menu , then uncheck Enable balloon tips .	St

1.3.1	If it 's not the PC 's , the cards or the cables then that would leave the router/switch .	St
1.3.2	Have you tried checking it or changing it out ?	Ques
1.4.1	Shot in the dark here , but have you recently reformatted ?	Ques
1.4.2	If so , you 'll need to install the proper drivers included with your motherboard .	St
1.4.3	Just a typical troubleshooting tip , you 'll have to get a bit further into detail so we know exactly what the issue is ( IE ; Have you reformatted recently , have you changed any hardware , is your network actually working , etc . )	St
1.5.1	I had this problem all the time and it would drive me nuts ! ! !	St
1.5.2	I would always uninstall the drivers , most of the time , and then restart to let windows reinstall them by itself .	St
1.5.3	If the issue still persists , try the drivers that were packaged with the motherboard , or download the latest driver version .	St
1.5.4	If nothing above fixes your issue , it could be several of the following : There is a driver signing issue , conflicting with windows .	St
1.5.5	( Do a fresh install ) Defect motherboard ( have you touched anything inside of your PC lately ? )	Ques
1.5.6	The router settings ( Enter the main domain of your IP address in a web browser URL , and then look for a function that will reset everything to default )	St
1.6.1	You probably have a 2Wire DSL Modem/Router .	St
1.6.2	Whenever the DSL sync drops , it stops handing out DHCP ip addresses and the little & quot ; Disconnected & quot ; balloon will pop up .	St
1.6.3	If your DSL light is n't solid green , then you know the modem is causing the problem .	St
1.7.1	If you have n't already done some of these more drastic solutions - you might try this .	St
1.7.2	I have the same problem with my Wireless Broadband router dropping me off line at times .	St
1.7.3	All it requires is to unplug the power jack on the back , wait 20-30 secs and plug it back in to reset it .	St
1.7.4	Within a minute , I 'm up and running on the network again .	St
1.8.1	Ditto on the & quot ; 2-wire & quot ; modem .	St
1.8.2	It has an option that can be turned off ; but until you do , it will intercept your web requests and deliver its own alerts instead no matter what URL you type .	St
1.8.3	This has bad consequences for sites with pop-ups .	St
1.8.4	Another situation is when a worm or virus ( or even a poorly constructed program ) makes a & quot ; blocking call & quot ; and nothing else , not even Windows itself , can use the ethernet port until there 's either a response or a timeout on the blocking call .	St
1.8.5	I think newer versions of Windows ( or updates to Windows ) converts blocking calls to non-blocking calls to avoid this problem .	St
1.8.6	If it is a laptop computer , sometimes ethernet adapters will be turned off to save power ; so if your batteries are a few years old you will experience this phenomenon more aggressively .	St
1.8.7	Dual speed switches/hubs can occasionally cause this problem .	St
1.8.8	Cisco switches , for instance , include features to disable auto-negotiation to prevent problems that sometimes result when the PC is dancing around with a switch ; each of them trying to adapt to the other .	St
1.8.9	You can disable auto negotiation in the PC too by editing the adapter settings in the Device Manager of & quot ; My Computer & quot ; .	St
1.8.10	Really it would be & quot ; Your Computer & quot ; since mine works well enough My laptop , however , was very aggressive about disabling the ethernet interface and turning it off over the slightest glitch .	St
1.8.11	That 's a feature that can be disabled ( which I did , since I use it for network troubleshooting and do n't need an ethernet interface that turns itself off ) .	St
1.9.1	fonfara 's reply sounds the closest to the problem I am having which is similar to the original post , however , mine is n't a balloon that pops up , it 's an actual icon in the space on the bottom right where the time and other icons are .	St
1.9.2	It appears as dual computers with a red X through them and the message reads : Local Area Connection , A network cable is unplugged .	St
1.9.3	The problem with that message is I do n't have LAN .	St
1.9.4	I have a single home PC on dial-up connection .	St
1.9.5	It appeared about 3 months ago and all efforts to get rid of it have failed .	St
1.9.6	I 'd appreciatre any suggestions .	St
1.10.1	Hi , I 've had this prob in the past .	St
1.10.2	I cured it by ... Go to 'Start & gt ; Control Panel & gt ; Network Connections ' & gt ; Right click 'Local Area Connection & gt ; Properties ' .	St
1.10.3	Untick both 'Show notification when connected ' and 'Limited or no Connection ' .	St
1.10.4	You could also 'Disable ' LAN I suppose as a belt and braces but you would need to reverse all this if you needed to use LAN in future obviously .	St
1.10.5	Hope this helps Rgds JJ	St
1.11.1	I had same problem .	St
1.11.2	went into windows internet connection wisard and redone the connection .	St
1.12.1	I tried your suggestion but it did n't work .	St
1.12.2	When I went into LAN Properties , both were already unticked .	St
1.12.3	Thanks anyway .	St
1.13.1	If you 're using Win XP , have you opened Internet Explorer , checked under the TOOLS dropdown , open internet options , select the & quot ; connections & quot ; tab , look for the dot where it says & quot ; always dial my connection & quot ; ?	Ques
1.13.2	If the selection does n't have a dot , you will probably have to setup your dial up connection again .	St
1.13.3	These settings may have been changed by a virus , or by mistake on a user 's part .	St
1.13.4	Since you 're already in the right area , click the setup button and follow the directions to enter your ISP info , if you know it .	St
1.13.5	If not , you will have to call your ISP for further assistance .	St
1.13.6	They should be happy to step you through it , and it should n't take more than 10 or 15 minutes .	St
1.13.7	Hope this helps .	St
1.14.1	If you 're not having problems but just want to zap the icon , right click on a blank space to the right of the time/ date etc at bottom right corner and select properties , make sure 'Hide Inactive icons ' is ticked .	St

1.15.1	I used to use IE but about a month or so ago , I switched to Firefox because I was having a lot of problems and it was when there was a major glitch found in IE .	St

1.15.3	Is there a way to do what you suggested through Firefox or do I have to go through IE ?	Ques
