HP keeps track of ink carts, but using a different ink cart even if refilled but NOT used by your system will be accepted. HP tracks upto 3 inkcarts, thus you need 4inkcarts to reset the last value from re-occuring. Saving X-money isn't worth it if the prtr. doesn't work. You need to access other inkcart(s) to continue usage. Google for further details but that covers it. tada -----Willy
