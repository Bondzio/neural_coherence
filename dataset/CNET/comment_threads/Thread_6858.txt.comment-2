I do not own that model printer or have access to one but here's what I do to get such working.
1.
I install the printer driver from HP.com for the printer for the OS in question.
2.
Then I can find the printer and use it.
&quot; tried downloading the latest XP drivers for this printer &quot; Since we need Vista drivers, that seems to be something odd to do.
