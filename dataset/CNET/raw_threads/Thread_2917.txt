However, there are a few individuals in my life that don't have a clue or really want to get that involved and need something simplier. I know there was a device a few years ago that allowed someone to copy a VHS tape to DVD that was not a regular DVD/VHS Recorder. This was portable and not much bigger than the actual VHS cassette. Has anyone heard of this or have info on it? Thanks

Big claims about ease of use so I bet many PAID DEARLY for the lesson. http://www.howtodothings.com/electronics/a4015-how-to-convert-vhs-to-dvd.html covers the 5 most common methods.

Originally I was asking about something portable that could do this function - I saw it on a shopping channel a few years ago but I couldn't find it so I guess I will either have to talk them into Dazzle or tell them to forget it

See here, for one that is fairly modern: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016GCI84/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_3?pf_rd_p=486539851&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=B000ASGFRE&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=1TEW0T1WYA7SBAP0PV90 Here is a Cnet article but they are all old devices now: http://reviews.cnet.com/1990-6463_7-5605370-1.html Of course, one could always pay someone else to do the conversions. Depending on where you live, the local drug store may provide that service on a &quot;per tape&quot; basis. And, if you are not allergic to using EBay, you might find a device that someone bought to do VHS tapes and got theirs all done and now offer the device for sale.
