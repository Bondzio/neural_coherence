what is that &quot;exec&quot; item?
sorry, i can't tell what your right thing is.
we know that we can't backup windows while windows is running.
we can backup our files but not programs and apps.
that's why i thought we'd get that out of the way first.
syncback/goodsync run on the client pc and can backup to many things or places.
i can't possibly replace the web site of those softwares but i'll start with yes to that area.
