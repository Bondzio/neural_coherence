I just purchased a Core i7 gaming pc from Visualdreamers.com.
Right from the start, I received great customer service on what components would work best for me.
The specs on the computer I built are as follows.
Lian Li Full Tower Chassis (HUGE, I didnt realize how big it was) Core i7 920 (overclocked for free to 3.8) 1000w corsair modular power supply Asus Rampage 2 Extreme Aftermarket Fans / Heatsink 6 GB OCZ Reaper 1866 DDR3 Ram Nvidia GTX 295 WD Velociraptor 300gb DVD Burner w/ lightscribe I also had the chassis custom painted Audi Blue.
Its amazing looking, and is very durable.
It only cost 99 bucks, I was expecting it to be cheap paint but its full blown high quality stuff.
I couldnt be happier with my purchase.
Just wanted to give them the thumbs up on a job well done.
Anyone else have any experiences with them ?
