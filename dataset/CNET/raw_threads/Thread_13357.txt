At 3 months I had the time to call it in. 8 hours on the phone and they take it back. What's not good about what happened next is that they returned it in far worse shape than they got it. Before it had a bug. After their repair it would lock up in minutes. To make matters worse the support calls were answers with &quot;we've done all we could.&quot; at 9 months I called it my last HP.

They're the only ones I've ever experienced who will tell you things that're 100% opposite from the truth. E.g. they told me you could plug a PCI card into a PCIe slot. I've read Bob Proffitt's posts about how they were unable to fix a defective system after many months (I see he's posted about it in this thread), and seen other similar posts. There've been numerous news reports about their financial problems and the management shake-ups they've had in recent years too.
