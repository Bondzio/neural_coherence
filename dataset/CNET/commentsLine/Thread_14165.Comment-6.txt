i agree, make sure you have enough power.
also make sure that the psu you buy (if you buy one) is not one of those cheapos.
brand names are desired when looking for a psu: antec, thermaltake, pc power & cooling, and sparkle, just to name a few.
you should be looking at ones above the $40, especially when going for a psu of 350w or more.
