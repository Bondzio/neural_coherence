any mention of the cable modem and your purchase of INTERNET SERVICE along with the Digital cable service--it is not automatic.
One either pays for an installer to set up the account or one gets the self installation package from the provider when one signs up for the internet service.
The cable company's line screws into the cable modem and the cat5 goes from the cable modem to either your NIC (ethernet card), your router, or your hub's uplink port.
