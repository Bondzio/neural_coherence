One has xp home, other has just been re-installed with xp pro. Before I reinstalled xp pro, it all worked. Now, I can't copy files from one computer to the other. I have run network wizard on both pc's, folders are shared on both pc's, workgroup is mshome on both pc's. I am logged in as administrator on both pc's. Each computer can see the shared folders on the other, but trying to acces them gives an access denied message. What have I overlooked ?

I presume I won't need to change anything on this machine, as nothing has been changed on it. On a separate note, this machine lists under my network places all the shared folders that used to exist on the other machine, but don't any more. How do I stop this machine showing shared network folders that no longer exist ?
