with the nice graphics and sounds cards you plan to use, why not install windows media center?
only about $130 at newegg.com.
i opted to buy an hp with wmc rather than build 'cause the $ was too good to pass.
yeah, i know it's hp, but i've already cleaned out the crapware and bumped the ram to 1.5 gb.
the media ctr stuff is pretty cool though.
