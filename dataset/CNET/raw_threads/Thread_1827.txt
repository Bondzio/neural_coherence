However my ability to look for anything is restricted because of my workload and my hours at Uni. Online stores are crap at determining between gigabit and regular Ethernet. so please help me. BD

DSL providers are giving the new customers free DSL modems with wifi routers and the 10/100 switch units. There is no incentive to make one with gigabit switches. However you can bet you'll get better performance if you add your own gigabit external switch. I would not look for the product you asked for since the market is non-existent (save for you.) Bob
