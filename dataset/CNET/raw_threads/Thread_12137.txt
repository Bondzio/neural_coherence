When I was reformating my C drive while reinstalling windows. Now my external hard drive is being recongized as a CD/ROM drive and I have no access what so ever to the external or any data that might have been on it. Its a Maxtor 3100, 100gb external and uses USB2.0, and im running WinXP. IS there anyway to make my computer realize its a hard drive whenever I click on CD/ROM drive it created for the hard drive it says &quot;windows cannot read frm the disk, the disk might be corrupted, or it could be using a format not compatible with windows&quot;. Is there any hope in salvaging any info on the drive, please help. Thnx
