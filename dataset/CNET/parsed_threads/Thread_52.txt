<s> Hi there, Im not sure if this post fits in this area, so i apologize in advance i am new to cnet. </s>
<s> anyway i recently built my first PC. </s>
<s> Specs: CPU: Quad Core Q6600 MB: Asus P5N-D RAM: Kingston Hyper X 2GB HDD: Seagate Terabyte GFX: NVidia GeForce 8500 OS: Vista Ultimate 32 bit The question i now ask is will crysis warhead run on my PC? </s>
<s> i downloaded the original crysis singleplayer demo and turned the spec way down, this caused it to look horrible...which doesn't suprise me neither does it appeal to me. </s>
<s> The reason i now ask this is because apparently they optimized crysis warhead to run far better on a wider range of pcs (im guessing lower spec). </s>
<s> So what is your opinion do you think it will run at an acceptable level? </s>

<s> You may have to look at &quot;the list&quot; and see how far up you can go on that list. </s>

<s> the geforce 8500 is a low-end card. </s>
<s> crysis warhead is more forgiving than the original but it still needs at least a mid-range card like a a $100 9600gt to run smoothly without resorting to low res/low effects. </s>
