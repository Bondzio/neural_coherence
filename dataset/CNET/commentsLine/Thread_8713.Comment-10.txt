my first computer (several years ago) needed servicing.
i have a parrot.
the computer was sitting on carpet.
i received a call from the service tech saying that when he opened the computer feathers which had filled up the inside came flying out all over the store.
he quickly went outside and finished emptying the case.
now i have an air purifier within 3 feet of the computer which is up off the floor in a room without carpet or birds.
recently i volunteered to do some upgrades on a neighbor's computer.
when i opened her computer there was a mouse nest complete with plastic toys and food inside it (but no dust bunnies or mouse).
my neighbor agreed that it was time to buy a new computer.
