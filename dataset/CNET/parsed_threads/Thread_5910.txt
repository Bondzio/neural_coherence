<s> Does anyone here have any experience with this tablet? </s>
<s> A good friend who is wheelchair bound is thinking about buying this tablet. </s>
<s> He mostly will be using it to watch horse racing, baseball, football and pretty much any sports so it has to be able to run flash which this does. </s>
<s> What browser does Asus use on the transformer and how is the wifi strength? </s>
<s> Any advise I can pass on to him would be very much appreciated. </s>
<s> It's limited by the FCC in this country and being a tablet is a bit of a problem since you're never sure of orientation such as a laptop screen would be. </s>
<s> Figure that all tablets get a few feet less than a laptop in the same setting. </s>
<s> At the office we have many tablets but not this one. </s>
<s> Frankly if I had a choice I'd get the iPad. </s>
<s> Once you have a few you'll know why. </s>

<s> I have an iPad2 and really like it, but it doesn't have flash which he needs. </s>
<s> It looks like most Android trablets have flash so he is pretty much stuck with them for what he wants to use it for. </s>
<s> It now appears the wifi won't be an isssue because I will be installing the modem/wirelss router in the same room he will be using the tablet in, about 10-15 feet away. </s>
<s> Other than the iPad I know very little about tablets and which would be best for him. </s>
<s> He has MS with limited use of his hands, but should be able to use a stylus OK. </s>
<s> It used SilverLight and you can bet that's a Windows only thing. </s>
<s> He will be picking up the tablet Friday and has 14 days to see what it can and can't do. </s>
<s> That should give him more than enough time to see if it fits his needs. </s>
<s> I've seen the RIM Playbook and it's very nice. </s>
<s> It can run RIM's OS and now there is an option to run Android. </s>
<s> It's not 10 inches but in my opinion, a solid tablet. </s>
<s> Feels good, works very nice. </s>
<s> Refurb at tigerdirect looks to be about 190 bucks. </s>
