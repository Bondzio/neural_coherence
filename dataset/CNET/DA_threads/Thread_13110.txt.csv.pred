1.1.1	Hello All, I have a HP 1020 printer.	St
1.1.2	There are times when I'm not able to print to it.	St
1.1.3	When I look in the printers folder I see a &quot;copy 1 hp1020&quot; along with the hp1020 printer.	St
1.1.4	When I try to print to the &quot;copy 1 HP1020&quot; I'm then able to print.	St
1.1.5	I'm not sure how or why &quot;copy 1 hp1020&quot; is installing or why I'm not able to print to the original &quot;hp1020&quot; It usually happens after I reconnect my laptop when returning home from work.	St
1.1.6	I've had this happen with my HP 1100 printer also.	St
1.1.7	I'm using XP pro.	St
1.1.8	Thanks Bruce	St
