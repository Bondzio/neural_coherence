1.1.1	Every so often, my router would decide to cut out and suddenly lose all connection.	St
1.1.2	I can't log into the router, no connection to the internet, and have to run a power cycle to get things back to normal.	St
1.1.3	This could happen between 10 minutes or 10 hours.	St
1.1.4	I've looked around and seen a bunch of others with the same issue and no solution.	St
1.1.5	Something tells me its just the hardware.	St
1.1.6	I also have two other routers I got to try and replace it, but came up with their own issues.	St
1.1.7	One's a Linksys newer WRT54G2 model, the small black ones.	St
1.1.8	It doesn't have the disconnect issue but I had problems getting its wireless to broadcast properly.	St
1.1.9	I also have an older WRT54G that worked fine at my apartment but after I tried a hard reset I can't access it anymore, it won't even show up on the network.	St
1.2.1	Disable the radio after a hard reset?	St
1.2.2	I don't see in your post where you plug in and configure the router.	St
