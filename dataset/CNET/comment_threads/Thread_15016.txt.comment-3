There's only 4 active users browsing the web etc.
The 16 machines/devices connected are 5 PCs, 6 VoIP phones, 2 servers (they are v. low use...not serving to the public), 1 printer, 1 mobile, and one occasional wireless user.
We have a 20mb &quot;BT business&quot; connection.
We don't regularly stream lots of content as this is our work connection so we are mainly browsing web pages and uploading/downloading files but most of the files are tiny (&lt;300k) and the ul/dl don't happen all day every day just occasionally.
Does that still seem like it's overuse to you?
I'm not sure what I should expect from this connection.
