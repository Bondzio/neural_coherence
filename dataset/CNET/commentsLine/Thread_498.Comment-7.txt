the technician and i finally figured it out.
since i hadn't been getting good printing copies using the photo ink, i thought the cradle that came in the box might be something i was supposed to be using.
that turned out to be a &quot;holder&quot; for the cartridge when it is not being used.
eventually, i was steered to a page which explained the correct combination of cartridges to use.
57 is the color cartridge, whether it be regular or photo.
the other cartridge uses a 56 or 58. i had to make sure that i was using the 57 photo and the 58 photo grey rather than just the black and white cartridge or the photo grey with just the color cartridge.
still, i don't see that using the photo ink makes a much better photo print than using regular ink.
still, perhaps the photo inks last longer.
