No doubt Bob your right.
I just haven't had the chance to see it.
I have only worked with a 40-50 wireless networks of 1,000+ nodes each.
But most all of them are the same brand gear so maybe that again is why I have been lucky.
I will keep an eye out for that issue now.
So thanks for the heads up.
