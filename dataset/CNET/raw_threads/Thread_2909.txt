If you have -NONE- on mtrbd. then you need to bet a SATA type i/f card to mount in mtrbd. slot. Since, you also provided nothing in the details of your mtrbd. or PC in specific, I leave it at that. Otherwise, check you manual, PC maker, or mtrbd. maker support website if no manual and/or review details of adding a SATA HD if so ported. tada -----Willy
