that comes with gps (so it knows where it is and there's no need for the user to type it himself: i'm at 52.716181 n and 60.6181711 w)?
google maps might be a better tool to use than google earth.
it clearly shows roads.
indeed, companies like tomtom and nokia and mio make such devices and such programs.
but i think their own databases, not google's.
that's rather expensive, maintaining your own world-wide database of streets.
for a start: read  kees
