I tried all latest amd drivers and with all of them i have this problem, i tested the video card on another pc and works perfectly, i tried to replace the 7770 with an nvidia 280gtx and the nvidia with its drivers do not crash, i also tried different psu on my pc but the problem persists. Could this be incompatibility between the video card and the motherboard ? i also noticed it crashes more often with some graphic engines, less with others. os: win7 cpu: i5 2310 motherboard: msi z68a-g43 video card: amd hd7770 ram: 8gb corsair ddr3 (2x4) psu: cx500w

Your newer users didn't live through the days where ATI's drivers would alternatively be bad and good with each version. Bob
