I stuck it in the closet until I had time to look at it and forgot about it. When I finally got it out I tried to reload it (Win XP Pro) but it locks up before completing the install - it did the same thing with Win 98. I tried another HD, then memory and it did exactly the same thing. Whatever is wrong with it seems to have come to the surface, the last couple of times I turned it on it instantly fills the screen with strange letters and characters. No beeps or anything, and as fast as it begins making these it clearly isnt going into the BIOS or Post Codes. Now, my question: what are the odds it is the motherboard, BIOS etc instead of the processor? I know where I can get a motherboard very reasonably, and wonder if it would be worth the gamble, any thoughts? Thanks for any suggestions. Chris

Remove ram and clean the slots with soft toothbrush and alcohol, allow to dry and then re-install ram and check results. Of course try other ram if possible or test elsewhere, that ram. That's where I'll start... tada -----Willy
