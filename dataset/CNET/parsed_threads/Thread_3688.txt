<s> Can anyone provide some information on wireless cable modems? </s>
<s> Do they eliminate the need for a wireless router between the modem and the computer? </s>
<s> Any recommendations on a model. </s>
<s> I've seen different reports on Motorola's SBG900 and SBG1000. </s>
<s> I need to hook up my existing modem via USB rather than Ethernet. </s>
<s> Is there any performance difference between a wireless cable modem and a standard cable modem with wireless router. </s>
<s> Thanks Steve Rehmann </s>
<s> is a USB connected modem, then you may want to change to the combo if it offers an ethernet interface rather then trying to add a stand only router . </s>
<s> The built in router if a &quot;G&quot; type will run at close to 54mbps. </s>
<s> Add a wireless &quot;B&quot; device and the speeds drop to 11mbps. </s>
<s> Not having to run CAT5 cable is the main advantage in going 802.11x. </s>
<s> &quot;Is there any performance difference between a wireless cable modem and a standard cable modem with wireless router.&quot; I would think not. </s>
<s> Michael: Thanks for the response. </s>
<s> Let me see if I follow. </s>
<s> I am stuck with the USB connection to my desktop. </s>
<s> I had ethernet for quite a while and it suddenly stopped working. </s>
<s> My ISP (Mediacom) and I troubleshot. </s>
<s> We ended up trying different ethernet cards, different cables, different modems and different PCI slots to no avail. </s>
<s> When we switched to the USB it connected right away. </s>
<s> I am not disapointed with the speed or performance. </s>
<s> I would guess there is a setting or failure of some type at the computer as I can get the signal to the modem but not to the computer on the ethernet side. </s>
<s> Are you saying that a wireless cable modem &quot;combo&quot; would be a route to go if it has an ethernet side for a laptop. </s>
<s> I am looking at a Motorola SBG900 wireless modem. </s>
<s> It says it has a 802.11g wireless access point. </s>
<s> My thoughts were that I could keep the desktop cabled to the modem as it has a USB connection on the rear. </s>
<s> I thought that would eliminate the need for a wireless USB adaptor between the desktop and modem. </s>
<s> I would then add the notebook as a wireless connection to the ethernet side of the modem. </s>
<s> I'd end up with a physical cable connection from the modem to the desktop (USB) and a wireless connection from the laptop to the modem (ethernet??) </s>
<s> Am I on the right track. </s>

<s> would work with your laptop (if your laptop has a wireless adapter) instead of a physical cable (ethernet) connection. </s>
<s> The troublesome statement is: &quot;I had ethernet for quite a while and it suddenly stopped working. </s>
<s> My ISP (Mediacom) and I troubleshot. </s>
<s> We ended up trying different ethernet cards, different cables, different modems and different PCI slots to no avail. </s>
<s> When we switched to the USB it connected right away.&quot; This indicates a problem within either the computers networking hardware/software or the modem. </s>
<s> The prevalent cause of lost connections is some type of viral/spyware/malware infection which if not cleaned off will eventually come back to haunt you. </s>
<s> Michael: I regularly run Ad-aware and Spybot and often have very few items to remove. </s>
<s> Will also use Registry Mechanic to clean registry. </s>
<s> I am running XP SP2, 512 RAM, AMD Athlon XP 1.47G. </s>
<s> Harware includes a Motorola SB4200 modem, logitech wireless mouse and keyboard, Xtasy 9200SE 128MB video card, Audixy SX USB sound card, Creative TV card, and a Pinnicle video capture card. </s>
<s> I have 5 USB ports in the rear and all are full. </s>
<s> 2 up front are used infrequently. </s>
<s> 2 firewire ports are on the same PCI card that has the 3 USB ports. </s>
<s> Ehternet card is a D-Link DFE-530TX+ So what we are running into is even though there is something wrong with the ethernet connection on the desktop I would be able to keep the wired USB connection and add a wireless laptop via ethernet through the wireless modem?? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> &quot;I would be able to keep the wired USB connection and add a wireless laptop via ethernet through the wireless modem? </s>
<s> ?&quot; You should be good to go, except for the statement that the wireless laptop will connect via ethernet. </s>
<s> The ethernet standard (802.3) is primarily used with CAT5 cabling, while a wireless connection (802.11) is just that. </s>
<s> PS: Try following the advice laid out here ( http://forums.majorgeeks.com/showthread.php?t=35407 ) for a more precise scan. </s>
<s> Thanks Mike. </s>
<s> I thing I'm getting the hang of it. </s>
<s> You've been very helpful. </s>
