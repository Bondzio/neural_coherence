so clock for clock, intel $ for $, take your pick.
the summary benchmark of the australian pc site was 95.5 for intel 1.8 and 96 for amd 2.0 i will have to do a lot more study to be sure which i want, but i have until july or august to decide when my son goes to college.
i don't think you can go wrong with either one and it will come down to price eventually for me
