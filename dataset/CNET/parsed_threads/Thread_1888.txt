<s> So i have a wireless network connection and a LAN connection and they are both displayed under the network bridge section in the Network Connections window, however, there is no bridge icon so i cant disable the &quot;bridge&quot; or configure my network adapters by themselves. </s>
<s> Is there another way to disable the bridge that doesn't seem to exist? </s>
<s> Ive tried a method that dealt with the registry and it removed the bridge but screwed up the adapters so i had to run a system restore and so im back to where i started. </s>
<s> what it looks like... http://img216.imageshack.us/img216/5017/89979969fl3.jpg thanks </s>

<s> I am not trying to bridge anything. </s>
<s> I am trying to disable the bridge but as shown in the pictures there is no bridge icon. </s>
<s> That prevents me from disabling the &quot;bridge&quot; or seperately modifying the adapters to turn off the ICS option. </s>
<s> I would like to stop this bridge so i can configure my netowrk adapters. </s>
<s> For me I went to the Add Remove Programs page and uninstalled ICS. </s>
<s> That turned it off. </s>
<s> Sorry, I missed that you installed ICS in your first post. </s>
