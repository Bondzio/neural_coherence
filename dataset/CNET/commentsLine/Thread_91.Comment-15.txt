if your hard drive has a physical error (bearing that's bad, rubber seal that's preventing it from spinning up, etc), it might work.
in any case it won't hurt it as long as you make sure you do not get excessive condensation on the unit.
in my case, ibm travelstar 18 gb that failed a few years ago, it did not work.
but it did allow the drive to spin up - which it did not do before freezing it.
hard drive recovery is still pricey, and any &quot;no-destructive&quot; method that you can try at home really does not do any damage.
it might start up the drive, and as other already have posted, be ready to copy the files.
