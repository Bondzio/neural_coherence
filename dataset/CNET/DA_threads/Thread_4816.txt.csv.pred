1.1.1	I know this is a pretty wide price range, but I'm trying to find the best bang for my buck in this price range.	St
1.1.2	Right now I'm looking at a Media Center from HP and a Dell 5100C Media Center.	St
1.1.3	The PC will be used in a dorm for mostly Microsoft Office, Multimedia, TV, & Internet.	St
1.1.4	Upgradability is certtainly desirable, as this will likely be the only PC I purchase while in collge.	St
1.1.5	I would certainly appreciate assistance with this matter and please ask if you have any questions.	St
1.2.1	I should have added that upgrading to a PCI tuner card is certainly not out of the question, if the non-Media Center PC is fair enough bargain.	St
1.2.2	The monitor would also need to be included in the price, or the price be low enought for a quality LCD to be purchased later.	St
1.3.1	http://www.compusa.com/products/product_info.asp?product_code=320288&pfp=BROWSE this is good as it comes with a decent 64-bit processor.	St
1.3.2	it also comes with win.	St
1.3.3	media center and a large sata hard drive.	St
1.3.4	it also come with a pci-express slot to upgrade to a better gfx card.	St
1.3.5	also comes with 1gb memmory.	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	NIL	St
1.6.1	That's a lot of puter for that price, for now and the future.	St
1.7.1	Sorry, I looked again today and noticed that was a 5100.	St
1.7.2	I believe the 5100C priced out of my range, though it did look like a great dorm computer.	St
1.7.3	And thanx for the help everyone.	St
1.7.4	Keep the ideas coming if you don't mind.	St
1.7.5	I usually look around a lot before I decide, so I certainly appreciate the assisstance.	St
1.8.1	I configured the same system on the HP website for $769, but I can add a 15&quot; LCD for only $50 more.	St
1.8.2	I think this would probably be the better total purchase.	St
1.8.3	Thank You for the help though.	Ques
1.9.1	I have configured the following systems and am mulling them over as I type.	St
1.9.2	I can get each for just under $1000.	St
1.9.3	The HP with a 19&quot; LCD and the Dell with a 17&quot; LCD monitor.	St
1.9.4	I think the Dell would be a better performer, but I would still need to upgrade it later for TV perposes.	St
1.9.5	I am seeking input on these and still welcome other suggestions.	St
1.9.6	Also, is anyone familiar with dual-core technology and the benefits of this.	Ques
1.9.7	I am also not sure if the DC has HT or not.	St
1.9.8	Thanx everyone, you have been quite kind and helpful.	St

1.10.1	however that processor isnt available with the hp and that dell model.	St
1.10.2	right now if thinking about dual core, i would suggest this http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/Gateway-Media-Center-Desktop-PC-835GM-/sem/rpsm/oid/125833/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do however, i'm not sure what your budget is.	St
1.10.3	i dont think the 5100c or the m7100y is a good deal.	St
1.10.4	if your budget is lower, i would suggest getting the emachines t6410 http://www.compusa.com/products/product_info.asp?product_code=320307&pfp=cat3	St
1.11.1	if that is right then the dell and hp u suggested were really not worth it.	St
1.12.1	I currently have the 5100C configured with a dual core 2.8ghz processor and my budget is $1000.	St
1.12.2	Both systems configured in the threads above can be bought for under $1000 with LCD monitors included.	St
1.12.3	The dell needs a coupon to be purchased for that price and the HP has rebates to put it in that range as well.	St
1.12.4	I will look at them again with your input in mind.	St
1.12.5	Thanx	St
1.13.1	NIL	St
1.14.1	so far.	St
1.14.2	HT terminology's are entirely different between AMD & Intel: Intel HT = Hyper Threading Technology AMD HT = Hyper Transport Technology Link AMD has been using their HT terminology since the introduction of the Athlon 64 (not used with the Athlon XP).	St
1.14.3	Intel HT has been in their 6xx, 5xx and 5x1 series computers.	St
1.14.4	Intel Dual Core has HT only in their Extreme Edition 840 Pent D processor.	St
1.14.5	The Intel Dual Core 840, 830, and 820 series Pent D processors do not have HT (Hyper-Threading Tech), but have EM64T.	St
1.15.1	Can most software effectively utilize the dual-core technology?	St
1.16.1	will not work on a dual core processor computer.	St
1.16.2	There may be some software already out that is specifically for dual core processor and I haven't 'Googled' to find out.	St
1.16.3	For gaming, dual core processing is in the future and Intel back in March had already begun priming: http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20050308net.htm?iid=search& Dual-Core processors are not faster than single core processors and with AMD's faster processors (FX) they plan to introduce a dual-core version of the AMD Athlon 64 FX processor when multithreaded software games are available to take advantage of its benefits.	St
1.16.4	So, although not faster than single core processors, computers with Dual-Core can eliminate the bottlenecks found in many PC processors, letting you do more faster.	St
1.16.5	You can run multiple programs simultaneously, rip and burn CD, download photos, or edit video while watching TV, emailing your friends, or surfing the Web, without slowing down your computer.	St

1.20.1	&quot;While a Hyper Threading processor will never be able to get close to dual processor performance, it does manage to alleviate the effects of running an application that requires enough CPU time to effectively stall the whole system (leading to the annoying &quot;this application is not responding&quot; message).&quot; http://www.tomshardware.com/cpu/20050509/cual_core_athlon-01.html In the most basic sense, it comes down to physical hardware: A dual-core processor has double the registers, execution units, and on-chip cache of a single CPU, even if the latter has Hyper-Threading.	St
1.20.2	&quot;Intel dual-core products supporting Hyper-Threading Technology could process four software threads simultaneously by more efficiently using resources that otherwise may sit idle.&quot; http://www.intel.com/technology/computing/dual-core/ Around 1119 other Intel references pertaining to Hyper-Threading/Dual Core, if you care to research: http://search2.intel.com/corporate/default.aspx?culture=en-US&q=Dual+Core+Hyper-Threading&x=21&y=8	St
1.21.1	$500: http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/eMachines-Desktop-PC-T6410-/sem/rpsm/oid/125832/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do $680: http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/HP-Pavilion-Desktop-PC-A1130N-/sem/rpsm/oid/127031/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do Use the extra cash to get a decent graphics card.	St
1.21.2	Note on Dual Core: While it is very nice to have the feature, games can't take advantage of it.	St
1.21.3	So you have to treat it like its single-core brothers in games.	St
1.21.4	Therefore: Intel Pentium Extreme Edition- Prescott 3.2GHZ AMD Athlon 64 X2 4800+ - 2.6GHZ Athlon 64 AMD chip is faster For multitasking, that doesn't apply because you can use the 2 cores.	St
