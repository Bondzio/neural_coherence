one more thing... might be better with two hdds than just one.
here's why .... drive 0 serves as space for your os and apps (c:) with a second partition for data (d:).
drive 1 is also installed internally and serves as an easy, fast back up (and restore) for the main hdd.
one big hdd .. if it dies you're toast and have no backup.
with two hdds you've got some redundancy and not likely that both drive could fail simultaneously.
virus infected yes...fail unlikely.
