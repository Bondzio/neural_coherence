Hi there - i currently own 2 wifi routers which have 4 lan ports on the back.
In my room i have two desktops without wireless capability.
I was wondering is it possible to have one router in my room which my desktops plug into - and then the router to &quot;&quot;Bridge&quot; with the one downstairs to give me wireless capability.
I believe its called bridging but i have had no hopen as of yet.
Huawei HG520b and Huawei HG532 are my two routers.
I know this can be done by purchasing a wire - but i cannot afford a 100m cable and i am not particularly interested in purchasing an adapter for my desktops.
Thank you
