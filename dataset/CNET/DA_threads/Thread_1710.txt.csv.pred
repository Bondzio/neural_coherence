1.1.1	Hello, this is my first post.	St
1.1.2	I have a continuous problem with my PC.	St
1.1.3	It keeps restarting itself.	St
1.1.4	PC SPECS: - XP Professional - 2.20ghz - 400w PSU - 80gig Hard Drive - DVDRW Drive - 2 x 512 DDR Ram - ATI Radeon 9200 Graphics Card - Linksys Wireless Network Adaptor - Firewire PCI Card Everytime I try and do something on my PC it restarts itself.	St
1.1.5	For example if i play a game, if i burn a CD/DVD.	St
1.1.6	i have a DVD creating software that came with the firewire card that i use to burn homemade DVDs (well i try to anyway) and during the burning process, it restarts.	St
1.1.7	i have a gut feeling that its my 400w PSU.	St
1.1.8	i'm saying this because it has thermal control.	St
1.1.9	ive tryed to disable thermal control in my BIOS, but i cant get to that specific setting.	St
1.1.10	What really gets to me is that when i try and change my screen resolution from display settings, it restarts.	St
1.1.11	i have a strong feeling that its my PSU.	St
1.1.12	Help!!	St
1.1.13	!	St
1.2.1	save ur files and then restore ur os i had the same problem on my gateway.	Sug
1.2.2	i asked gateway support and they said its a virus and i said that norton didnt find it?	St
1.2.3	i cleared my hard drive and it never restarted by itself again konny	St
1.3.1	I have actually formatted my computer many times.	St
1.3.2	i have even put a new hard drive in.	St
1.3.3	same problem.	St
1.4.1	alright thats querky if i may say.	St
1.4.2	i would trust ur gut and try replacing the power supply, go antec or another high quality brand.	Sug
1.4.3	i got antec true 480, it is unbeliebably silent, my 120mm fans r louder than it!	St
1.4.4	konny	St
1.5.1	How can 400watt power supply not be enough?	St
1.5.2	Don't listen to him!	Sug
1.5.3	Chances are, there's something wrong with the motherboard.	St
1.5.4	Such things are what usually cause crashes when the load gets heavy.	St
1.6.1	But the post is too slim on details to call it either way.	St
1.6.2	-&gt; The one area you learn never to skimp is the power supply.	St
1.6.3	Bob	St
1.7.1	Overheating processor perhaps.	St
1.7.2	2.2 GHz AMD Athlon 64 not pentium 4 right?	St
1.7.3	If it is an AMD Athon 64 that could be your issue.	St
1.7.4	Try to get at least 2 case fans for your computer and make sure your heatsink/fan are properly situated on the processor.	St
1.7.5	A good way to lower temps and cheap is to apply arctic silver 5 compound.	St
1.7.6	Roger	St
1.8.1	Is that like a hair regrowth forumla?	St
1.9.1	&quot;What is Google?&quot; or rather, using google.com I find what this item is.	St
1.9.2	Have you discovered this search engine yet?	St
1.9.3	No offense, but your posts tend to make you seem new to PCs.	St
1.9.4	Bob	St
1.10.1	So you're supposed to put some kind of gooey goo on your cpu... ^_____^	St
1.11.1	http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=how+to+install+cpu+heatsink It's a well documented procedure.	St
1.11.2	Pick an article you like.	St
1.11.3	Bob	St
1.12.1	Seriously, does it even work?	St
1.13.1	NIL	St
1.14.1	Before I start, if you are to offer advice in forums this basic principle would not be a question from you.	St
1.14.2	Time to ask for help and learn more.	St
1.14.3	-&gt; The issue for thermal paste is simple.	St
1.14.4	Any small air gap will not conduct heat very well.	St
1.14.5	The paste/goo fills in that gap and the heat moves.	St
1.14.6	Bob	St
1.15.1	After reading all the posts.	St
1.15.2	I would try the a new PSU as the first thing to do.	St
1.15.3	John	St
1.16.1	thanks john, i thought of doing that myself.	Polite
1.16.2	currently i have a 400w PSU, should i get another 400w PSU or something bigger.	St
1.16.3	And if i do buy a new one, what are the chances of the problem continuing?	St
1.17.1	It was that sorry other person that derailed us a little.	St
1.17.2	For now you can just lighten the load by dropping back to 1 hard disk, 1 CD or DVD drive and leaving the case cover off to see if its heat or power related.	St
1.17.3	Be sure to keep an eye open for any bulging or leaking motherboard capacitors.	St
1.17.4	Bob	St
1.18.1	capaciters.....???	St
1.18.2	Sorry but thats a new term for me.	St
1.18.3	explain!	St
1.19.1	Capacitors look like little ''batteries'' or ''cylinders'' on the motherboard.	St
1.19.2	When the motherboard is subject to overheating or a short occurs, the capacitors will appear bulged or in extreme cases, will burst and leak on to the board causing a multitude of problems.When this happens you need to replace the motherboard.	St
1.19.3	This happened to my system a while ago, I had to buy a new motherboard.	St
1.19.4	System temperature monitoring (tower case) is important to maintain in order to protect the components.	St
1.20.1	Ohhhh.	St
1.20.2	I was wondering what those were.	St
1.20.3	how can one spot a burst capacitor?	St
1.20.4	and speaking of motherboards, can anyone recommend a decent motherboard (2.2ghz and above) but i have a slight cash flow problem.	St
1.20.5	cheers	Polite
1.21.1	Like tires & brakes, never skimp on the power supply.	St
1.21.2	Those &quot;400 watt&quot; ain't necessarily so.	St
1.22.1	...are usually power related or heat related, sometimes both.	St
1.22.2	PCs have thermal protection in many places.	St
1.22.3	If you built the rig yourself check the thermal paste.	St
1.22.4	I had a LGA775 proc go wonky on me because I didn't have one of its &quot;legs&quot; properly secured, another PC went to spontaneous reboots because the PSU's cooling fan was failing.	St
1.22.5	More than likely it's the PSU, PC Power & Cooling (www.pcpowerandcooling.com ) or Antec are excellent, I'm using a Zalman low-noise unit.	St
1.22.6	Rule of thumb: If the PSU came with the case, pull it out & keep it for a spare, get a real one for your rig.	St
1.22.7	Good luck!	St
