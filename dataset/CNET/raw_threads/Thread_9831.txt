Should I go with the integrated 802.11b/g capability or should I dump that and just get a wireless network card? My concern with the integrated capability is that it can't be upgraded in the future. Does anyone have any recommendations?

ALL the integrated units that I've encountered were mini-PCI cards that you could change or remove... My advice is to go with it installed since it will be good to go on arrival. One less thing for you to install and setup. Bob
