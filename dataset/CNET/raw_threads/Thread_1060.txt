All that he could find was the webcam itself, no intruction or cd software. so i went to the logitech website and downloaded the latest driver and software and THEN connected it to my desktop computer. So then i go to test it out and it does everything its supposed to exept that thier is know picture! all that i see is black with a white bar along the left side of the screen. I am pretty sure its not broken or anything because my friend siad that it worked fine when he had it. So is thier anything that i can do to get it work? PS. I am assuming that notebook webcams are compatible with desktop computers. Thanks, COnnor
