Make and model of DLink?
Has it worked in the past, but now giving you problems?
Detailed error message that you receive?
Have you tried resetting the router?
You may need to do a factory reset of the router, but this will erase any settings that you currently have set (SSID, wifi key, etc.).
If you provide more details, someone here may be able to help you before it comes to that.
