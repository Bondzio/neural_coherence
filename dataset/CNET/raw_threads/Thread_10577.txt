I would like to replace both, the laptop with a Thinkpad, and either build the desktop or buy an HP. This post is going to focus on the desktop. The PC I would like to build consists of these parts, I really need help deciding on motherboards, that is the most confusing for me. I dont know if the one I selected would live up to the power of the processor. MOBO
