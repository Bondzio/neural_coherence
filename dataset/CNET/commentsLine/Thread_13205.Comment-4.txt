how do you find a new controller, what is the actual controllewr, and how is it replaced without opening up the shell?
i know this is probably a lost cause but i am thinking maybe this can help me, or someone i know, out in the future.
and if the platter is bad is there any software that you know of that can search the hard drive with the read/write head or arm on its own without any assistance?
