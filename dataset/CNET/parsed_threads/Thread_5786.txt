<s> I have a WindowsMe pc that has a box in the middle of the screen that says &quot;Video Cable Connected?&quot; it appeared out of nowhere. </s>
<s> The screen is black & red with this box in the center. </s>
<s> The screen looks like a tv when the cable goes out or no signal. </s>
<s> You can hear the programs loading up ibut nothing appears. </s>
<s> This was my pc and I gave it to my son. </s>
<s> He has alot of programs Morphous downloads music, hotmail,all that stuff. </s>
<s> I did take the pc back to original state after I gave it to him but it still isn't working correctly. </s>
<s> I don't know if this is fixable or should I just get another pc? </s>
<s> All he wants is something to make cds and play games. </s>
<s> Any suggewstions would be appreciated. </s>
<s> thank you for your time </s>
<s> and have a monitor with a miss worded message for not receiving a signal I had one that would say ON SIGNAL [should have been NO LOL]. </s>
<s> Some of these messages are in pidgen english. </s>
<s> The all he wants is &quot;Something to play games&quot; is a little humorous because gaming demands the better range of computers, not the castoffs. </s>
<s> Graphics also create high demands for a better computer. </s>
<s> First try reseating the video card, make sure all connections are good. </s>
<s> Here's why. </s>
<s> The CHERNOBYL VIRUS actually was a fine example where the FLASH BIOS could be erased. </s>
<s> This virus didn't survive long, but did teach a lesson. </s>
<s> The use of Morpheous is a great way to learn the brutal lesson that such software is like CRACK COCAINE for your PC. </s>
<s> If you run such, you may get burned! </s>
<s> Nuff written about that. </s>
<s> Your post is far too lightwieght. </s>
<s> No mention if the unit powers ups and beeps. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> The unit does power up and I can hear programs loading. </s>
<s> It does make some noise wouldn't say it's a beep. </s>
<s> I am not a computer whiz so unless the fix is rather easy not sure I can do it. </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> The unit gets power and you think it's loading the OS but the DISPLAY never shows any BIOS or other indication other than the CONNECT CABLE or similar. </s>
<s> That means you test the display on another machine and another display on this machine. </s>
<s> Tell what happens? </s>
