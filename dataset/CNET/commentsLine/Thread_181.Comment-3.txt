many isp's throttle the connections after so many bytes.
i have no limitation with my internet plan, but i begin to suspect that my internet provider could have something to do with that voluntarily 5. did you do a site survey to find an open wifi channel?
or does your router automatically find an open channel?
i don't understand what you mean here... are you talking about the interaction modem-router?
i guess it's automatic, isn't?
