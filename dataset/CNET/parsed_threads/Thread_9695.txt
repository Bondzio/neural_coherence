<s> I am looking for a scanner which can scan documents and allow me to alter the scanned stuff in word, excel etc. </s>
<s> Most scanners seem to offer great photo scanning. </s>
<s> Any ideas on which is the best scanner to use for document scanning so that the scanned documents can go directly to word or adobe and allow me to work on the document. </s>
<s> I am not very computer savvy and am looking for a scanner that is not very complicated. </s>
<s> Just about any current scanner is up to the task. </s>
<s> The only consideration is what OCR (optical character recognition) software, if any, is included. </s>
<s> It is that software the converts a scanned image into readable text in programs such as Word. </s>
<s> Personally I prefer Readiris , although Epson and other manuafcturers usually include a &quot;lite&quot; version of ABBYY FineReader . </s>
<s> They're all pretty much the same, and their accuracy ratings are pretty close, so as long as the scanner states that it includes OCR software, you should be fine. </s>
<s> Hope this helps, John </s>
