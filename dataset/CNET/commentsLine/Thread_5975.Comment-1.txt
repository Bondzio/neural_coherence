this is the second microphone i've bought for my windows xp computer and i plug the thing into the pink jack and turn it on and the sound effect manager detects the microphone but when i try to use speech recognition like windows xp says to do in help, there is no option for the microphone to speak and in sound recorder i get no sound line recording!!!
please help, how do i get the microphone to work?
i want to be able to record sound with videos on my logitech quickcam webcam!
please help.
