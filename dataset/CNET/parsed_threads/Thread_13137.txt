<s> Given the problems with trying to use WINE / Crossover Office, VMWare, Bochs and other non-solutions, is there hardware that can simulate two PCs, allowing one to load two operating systems and comfigure how much memory to allocate to each OS perhaps in CMOS / BIOS if in the motherboard or by a Windows, DOS, or Linux program otherwise? </s>
<s> There are a few concerns of mine here. </s>
<s> There are bound to be some device-related issues here. </s>
<s> Perhaps have some devices accessable by only one OS at a time such as sound cards. </s>
<s> I am not so sure this is appropriate /workable for displays. </s>
<s> Another real concern would be bus mastering devices. </s>
<s> The only search terms and phrases I can think of lead to irrelevant results. </s>
<s> I use 2 machines and a KVM switch to get to each machine. </s>
<s> Cheaper on my time... Bob </s>
<s> I suspect you aren't saving much. </s>
<s> I suppose one might manage to use an Ethernet card to boot over a network and make one of the machines diskless (no hard drive, floppy drives or CD / DVD drives) and perhaps no sound or USB as well (or use USB instead of Serial ATA). </s>
<s> I somehow forgot the two biggest expenses. </s>
<s> I'm sharing my solution to emulating a machine with two minds. </s>
<s> Given today's hardware prices, it's the cheap way out. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Time is something that costs more than the hardware here. </s>
<s> If I were to spend time trying to get one machine to pretend it was two, the hours would exceed the cost of my solution. </s>
<s> Cheers, Bob </s>
<s> from Microsoft This was a quick Goggle search, research some more. </s>
<s> Virtual PC applications are hwd intensive and Bob's suggestion may have more merit. </s>
<s> Bill </s>
<s> I am asking if there is a (primarily at least) hardware-based solution. </s>
<s> Software based solutions, to use an AT&T phrase &quot;just isn't worth it.&quot; </s>
<s> Many years ago I was allowed only one PC at my desk. </s>
<s> So I found a cube box that held 2 motherboards. </s>
<s> The KVM sat on top and I met the goal of just one PC. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>

<s> Or Virtual machine, take your pick. </s>
<s> But it's kinda like toggling between the two. </s>
<s> You can switch with out rebooting. </s>
<s> One kind of hibenates while the other is active. </s>
<s> Now if you get yourself one of the big IBM water cooled main frames from 15 years ago you could do it easly. </s>
<s> I do it Bob's way. </s>
