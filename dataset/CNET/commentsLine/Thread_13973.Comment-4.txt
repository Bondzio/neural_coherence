how do i switch between the vga and dvi input signals on my monitor?
if you have one or more devices connected to your monitor you can switch between the vga and dvi input signals.
to switch between the vga and dvi input signals follow the steps below: on the lower bezel of your monitor, press the menu button to enter the onscreen menu.
use the arrow buttons to navigate to the image icon and press the menu button to enter the submenu.
select the input signal and press the menu button to confirm.
use the arrow buttons to navigate to the exit icon, and then press the menu button to save and exit.
&quot; there is a graphic icon there i can't put in this forum.
