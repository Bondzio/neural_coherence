Sorry, Bob, I should have put more information on it.
OS (Win 98) was reinstalled after a full reformat of the HD.
I can't remember now why she felt like she needed to do that.
The DVD was a Gateway installed ... the manufacturer started with an &quot;M&quot;, but I can't remember exactly who it was.
I'll e-mail her and find out.
Thanks for your help.
Cameron
