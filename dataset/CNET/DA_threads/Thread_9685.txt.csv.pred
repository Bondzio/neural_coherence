1.1.1	Hi all , I am working with a Sony Vaio PCG-FRV35 .	St
1.1.2	Upon startup with battery in and plugged in , the computer will say it is running on A/C power , when it should say bettery ( charging ) .	St
1.1.3	If I shut down and remove battery and re-insert , start back up it works fine , runs on battery and charges correctly , even works without charger as should .	St
1.1.4	This problem does not take more then an hour or a day to come back .	St
1.1.5	The main problem is that I am not the primary user of this pc and since it is for business use , they dont want to learn how to deal with it .	St
1.1.6	Any Ideas from anyone ?	Ques
1.1.7	By The Way- We already purchased a new battery and are using it now , but the problems occurerd with the old battery as well .	St
1.1.8	I also noticed that when I start up the laptop on battery it stays on the Windows Xp loading screen for about 2 mins , sometimes more , and the loading bar moves slower then usual or on charger .	St
1.1.9	After getting insto windows the mouse moves but lags for a split second every other second or so .	St
1.1.10	It doesnt clear up right away after the computer finishes loading but a couple minutes later and the mouse has no lag .	St
1.2.1	You said with the laptop plugged in , it says it 's running on AC instead of saying it 's charging the battery .	St
1.2.2	I 'm not seeing a problem .	St
1.2.3	It is running on AC .	St
1.2.4	As for the slower response while running on battery , this is normal .	St
1.2.5	It 's conserving power .	St
1.2.6	One way is to slow or & quot ; step down & quot ; the CPU .	St
1.2.7	You might find that you can customize some power settings to be less conservative .	St
1.2.8	I 'm not sure about Sony but other laptops I 've seen derive their power status displays from services that are running .	St
1.2.9	It could well be that the battery is n't always charging .	St
1.2.10	It wo n't need charging when full and not using it .	St
1.2.11	Are you finding problems being caused such as disconnecting the AC and finding the battery only 1/2 charged when it should be full ?	Ques
1.3.1	No it does not get only partial charge .	St
1.3.2	A big problem that I noticed is that it will sometimes die while the power is pluged into it .	St
1.3.3	And no , it is not supposed to say running on AC power when plugged in with the battery .	St
1.3.4	It should only say that if the battery is removed from the system .	St
1.3.5	When the battery is in and power plugged in , it should say Charging .	St
1.3.6	At these times that it says running on AC power , I go into control panel to power management and go to the battery screen where it shows no battery recognized .	St
1.3.7	After removing the battery and re-insterting to get it to charge correctly and tell me it is charging , if I go to power management it shows the battery type and power level and whether or not it is charging .	St
1.3.8	The main problem with this is that it does engine programming and if the laptop dies while programming , it could cost us more then the laptop to replace the computer we are programming .	St
1.3.9	I know that is enough reason to buy a new laptop but I am not the one that makes these choices .	St
1.3.10	Please help if you can .	Sug
1.3.11	So far I am leaning toward mainboard problems but I will try anything you can think of that may help .	St
1.3.12	As for the computer being slow when unplugged .	St
1.3.13	It does not take a laptop 3 minutes solely on the XP loading screen aside from all the bios .	St
1.3.14	Plus , my laptop I have at home if run on battery will show you the slower clock speed in the system settings .	St
1.3.15	This Sony shows the full clock speed and has no options to tell it to slow down the cpu for power savings .	St
1.3.16	I do not think this laptop has that option , and if it does I dont think it is being used anyway .	St
1.4.1	That 's weird .	St
1.4.2	Is this your laptop or are you some tech ?	Ques
1.4.3	The battery issues are easy to solve on laptops because there are so few parts at play .	St
1.4.4	We have the wall unit or brick which we check out with the voltmeter then the mainboard , contacts and finally the battery .	St
1.4.5	When you have a client that insists on it working you can nail the maximum repair fee with the cost of the mainboard , battery and your one hour shop fee .	St
1.4.6	Bob	St
1.5.1	Well its a family business that I work in not dealing with computers at all but I am the only one that works on and maintains the 10 computers that we use for work .	St
1.5.2	So Im stuck with just an hourly wage here .	St
1.5.3	I have already tested the wall unit with volt meter and it measures out good , just a sliver over which is better then underpowered .	St
1.5.4	How do I check the mainboard ?	Ques
1.5.5	contacts ?	Ques
1.5.6	battery ?	Ques
1.6.1	The tech bench has to swap the part to see if that fixes it .	St
1.6.2	This is why you issue a maximum estimate to see if they are serious about fixing it .	St
1.7.1	Thanks for the info , I know I wont be able to swap the board to test it so lets move on to the contacts and battery .	St
1.7.2	by contacts , do you mean the piece the charger plugs into that runs to your main board ?	Ques
1.7.3	I know some are plugged in and some are soldered in .	St
1.7.4	if this is plugged I know how to test it .	St
1.7.5	I didnt look at the battery close enough to know but can I use volt meter on the battery alone ?	Ques
1.7.6	And I dont assume you can check battery voltage with the charger plugged into it ... Plus I 'm wondering if getting power problems will even affect the issue Im having , which is windows not recognizing the battery all together .	St
1.7.7	I guess I 'll find out eventually .	St
1.8.1	Passing or failing if they ca n't measure voltages .	St
1.8.2	If we put the battery in we can test the contacts by seeing if the battery voltage appears on the motherboard on the other side of where these contacts go .	St
1.8.3	Replacing contacts has been done in the past but is such a rare failure that I 'll just say the motherboard is the highest failure item after the owner keeps a failed battery in the laptop too long which fries the charging circuit .	St
1.8.4	Today 's techs are little more than screwdriver jockeys but once in awhile you find one with a voltmeter .	St
1.8.5	Those are at least aware that there is more to this than swapping parts .	St
