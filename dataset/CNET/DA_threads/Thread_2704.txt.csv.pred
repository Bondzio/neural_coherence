1.1.2	Any ideas guys ?	Ques
1.2.1	The 8000 is a series so you should be more specific .	St

1.4.1	http : //miataru.computing.net/hardware/wwwboard/forum/28655.html and a few others note the onboard NIC may be the INTEL Pro 100 VM ethernet controller which can be found at http : //support.intel.com/support/chipsets/	St
