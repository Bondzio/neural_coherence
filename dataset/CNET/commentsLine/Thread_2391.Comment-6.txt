just like what you did on the video card, try reseating the memory module as well.
(these are much smaller and flat than the video card) try to push the edge levers of the memory socket simultaneously, then carefully, insert it back following where the notches of the memory should fit and wait until a click sound or it locks up with the lever.
(you really have to be careful with the memory module)
