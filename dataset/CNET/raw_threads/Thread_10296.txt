I would try the spinrite program ($89.00 but has a return policy that if it does not help you get your $$ back) It works by looking at a secotr and trying to recover and if its bad it tries to get the data off the sector and relocate it for you. It has had alot of sucsess from what i understand and there is little risk. If its is making noise then there is a mechanical fault which this program can't fix
