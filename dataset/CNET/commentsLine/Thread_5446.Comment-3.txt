i don't dwell too much on monitoring pgms., speedfan included.
i use them during a fix to check results but not on a constant basis monitoring.
it can be off and i tend to use them as a suggested rate of observation.
others may say, they get good results, but real measurements can vary from those provided by any such apps., so take with a grain of salt.
on top of all that, proper install of ans, etc.
will show at least they're working.
