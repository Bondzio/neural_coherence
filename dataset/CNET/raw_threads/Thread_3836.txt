It keeps shuting off and restarting for no reason, after turning off the auto-reboot option I keep getting BSOD'd. Normally with the generic error message. However the last two times I kept getting a BSOD with BAD_POOL_HEADER on the 3rd or 4th line down. I've been told it could be a number of different things wrong with it. Overheating, bad mobo, faulty PSU, bad RAM etc. I've checked the mobo for defects and bad capictors and they all seem ok. Its had a fresh install of Windows XP pro, I did a memtest and after about 2 hours it came up with 2 errors with the RAM. The CPU temps according to Speedfan are running at 36-43'C depending on load (this is with the side of the case off and a small deskfan blowing inside the case). With the side panel placed back, core temp 1 and 2 were into the 40s with a little red arrow pointing up. Its got a stock AMD heatsink and fan on it, however the case has no fan on it. The actual PC is about 4 years old but its new to me. The specs are: AMD Althon 3500+ (2.2Ghz 64bit) Asus motherboard (dont know the model) Nivida GeForce 5700 2 Sticks of 512mb ATL RAM Maxtor 80GB Hard Drive Windows XP Pro 230V PSU (dont know the wattage) Can anyone help?

And with the cover off and that fan there, did it still reboot? Also, since it reboots I wonder if you can tell us the 10 or so drivers you installed after you installed XP. It's not unusual to find a driver that was forgotten. Bob
6665	2	301486	2813396	2813369	radar19	7/17/08 8:54 AM	1.21628484E12	thanks for replying	The case has been cleaned out, it has restarted on a few occasions with the side off and a fan blowing into the case. the drivers that were installed, the CD-rom and DVD-RW drivers were installed I think, the graphics card driver, mobo driver, Wireless card driver. Thats all I can remember,

Notice the first 3 drivers are all about that at http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7587_102-0.html?forumID=69&threadID=271360&messageID=2699006#2699006 If you can supply the make, model of the mainboard I might find these. Also, my kids older machine continued to reboot oddly (rarely) for months until I figured out it was the audio driver. You can test for that by disabling the onboard sound. One last thing. Did you refresh the CPU heatsink &quot;compound&quot;? I would. Bob

In reguards to the heatsink, I have reasons to suspect this as it was kinda dusty before I cleaned it. I havent got any thermal paste so I cant take the heatsink off to see.

Proffitt	7/17/08 10:50 AM	1.2162918E12	Another idea	I have an AMD 64 socket 754 system and my random reboots ended when I moved some USB things off the onboard USB connections. That was my clue a driver wasn't quite right. Oddly the PCI USB 2.0 card that I moved them to worked fine. OK, how to identify the motherboard. You have the visual method and you can try BELARC ADVISOR and the free version of EVEREST. Bob
