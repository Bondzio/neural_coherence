1.1.1	I just got a new firm ware update for my wireless router the Dlink DI 624 and it has WPA and WPA2 but my brother has a netgear PCI card WG311 and i dont know if i can have this kind of security My question is does the PCI card have firmware or will i just have to use WEP	St
1.2.1	is the place to look.	St
1.2.2	As far as security, each network has it's own needs.	St
1.2.3	An apartment environment may need the beefier security of WPA, while a private country estate may need MAC filtering at best.	St
1.2.4	The choice is yours.	St
1.3.1	my question is that does the PCI card have the other security to use WPA and do PCI's have firms ware	Ques
1.4.1	on page 3-10.	St
1.4.2	Any change to the cards security function would come through a software program update, not firmware.	St
1.4.3	As this is an older card, I would guess Netgear is leaving this one alone and hoping you will buy a newer card.	St
1.5.1	comes under the heading of &quot;Use the internet to its fullest advantage.&quot; D-Link isn't the only manufacturer that has figured out how to provide useful information.	St
1.5.2	Netgear has information on their website too.	St
1.5.3	A cursory look reveals that there are 3 different versions of the WG311 card, but you have to look at the serial number of yours to determine which it is.	St
1.5.4	One of them has a new driver that will support WPA, the others apparently won't.	St
1.5.5	Enough hints from us, you know where to look for the rest.	St
1.5.6	dw	St
