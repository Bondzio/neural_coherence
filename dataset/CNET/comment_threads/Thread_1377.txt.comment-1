Hi.
I have an HP Pavilion zd8000, and all the specs I could find on the Internet indicate that it should have a Dual Layer DVD-RW drive, but no site indicates whether it's optional or standard for the computer (I assume optional).
I seem to remember getting mine with a Dual Layer DVD-RW, but I just stuck in a DL disc and it couldn't read it.
Is there any way to figure out whether it's a DL DVD-RW or just a normal DVD-RW?
Thanks.
