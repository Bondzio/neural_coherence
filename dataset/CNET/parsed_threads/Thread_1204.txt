<s> I am looking to upgrade my wireless network from a netgear mimo range max to the new n. I think I have it narrowed down to the NETGEAR WNDR3700 or the DLink DIR-825. </s>
<s> I really like the ability to set up a guest access point along with the more secure home network. </s>
<s> Another issue is the space where it will sit. </s>
<s> Standing up on edge it the most preferred setup. </s>
<s> I am looking for speed, range and stability. </s>
<s> I already have a set up for multiple drive on the network, and the printer is wireless so the usb port and network sharing on the router is not a major concern. </s>
<s> Also was looking to upgrade the usb pc wireless adapter for the main pc to maximize the benefits. </s>
<s> You most likely will see little if any difference between what you have and these newer routers as far as internet surfing go. </s>
<s> Your bottleneck is your internet connection and G and N both far exceed any consumer internet. </s>
<s> Next you will need to upgrade all your equipment to N to really get the advantages. </s>
<s> If you have a single device running G it will slow everything else down to G. Now both the routers you mentioned have 2 radios so you could run G on one and N on the other. </s>
<s> This assumes that you can run you N on the 5G band and leave the G on the 2.4G There is not a lot of difference between these routers mostly which software feature you like more. </s>
<s> Both are limited by FCC regulations so they will have similar strength so speed/range should be about the same. </s>
<s> The only difference I could see is that if you have signal strength issues is that the D-link let you put different antenna on it but you only do that when you have coverage problems. </s>
<s> The USB for the PC is similar issues but they make dual band verison of these too. </s>
<s> I would get one that has a long USB cable or buy a USB extension cable so you can place it on top of the PC. </s>
<s> The PC case itself tends to block signal if you are not careful </s>
<s> SO is there a reason to upgrade to an N? </s>
<s> I was having connectivity issue with wife's laptop but have discovered if I disable the wireless network and use an usb adapter it seems fine. </s>
<s> I do have some signal strength issues which is why I was looking at upgrading. </s>
<s> What would anyone suggest? </s>
<s> I think as you found out the issue is on the PC side. </s>
<s> Generally the internal cards on a laptop are not your best bet since they are a compromise. </s>
<s> They are nice and built in and save battery by running at low power. </s>
<s> I like the cards put out by ALFA. </s>
<s> Many models have external antenna that you can change as well as the ability to transmit up to the legal maximum power levels. </s>
<s> These are best used when you have a power source since they eat your battery when you turn the power up. </s>
<s> If you are going to buy stuff always buy N since they all support G also. </s>
<s> There is little difference in the price and someday you may be able to convert to N without replacing stuff again. </s>
<s> The key difference between N and G is that N is more tolerant of interference which sometimes give better coverage but both are limited by the same rules as far as transmit power goes so basic signal strength is the same. </s>
