Hello, I have a PS/2 optical Logitech mouse that works in Linux (Ubuntu 8.04), but not in Windows (XP Pro SP2).
It's plugged in when I start the computer, so what's the deal?
I've attempted the following to get it to work: *Check Device Manager: no yellow or red devices *Try to use &quot;Add Hardware&quot; - it found nothing *Tried to use &quot;Add Hardware&quot; manually - no mouse in the selection Suggestions on getting the thing to work?
It's slightly annoying when using some programs to not have a mouse.
