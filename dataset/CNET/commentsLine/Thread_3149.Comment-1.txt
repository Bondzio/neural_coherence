i have 2 harddrive questions: 1. i have an external hard drive and although i am suppose to have a usb 2.0 connection no matter where i pull the cable it keeps telling me that the hard drive is not going to function as well and needs to be put in a usb 2.0 port.
2. i currently have a 80gb hard drive installed on my computer and when like to get and larger one installed.
can they install a bigger hard drive say 250gb and transfer over all my stuff from the 80gb hard drive without causing any problems?
