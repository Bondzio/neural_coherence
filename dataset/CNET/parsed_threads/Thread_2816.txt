<s> I currently have a 750GB PATA drive (only about 20-25GB actually used, the rest is free) that I want to clone onto a 300GB Velociraptor drive recently purchased for increased performance of my system. </s>
<s> I am going to use Arconis True Image to clone the disk and I was wondering if anyone had any issues cloning a partition from a larger disk to a smaller disk? </s>
<s> Would any data be potentially lost even though the PATA drive is only about 20-25GB full right now? </s>
<s> they should ...the data would still be on the PATA. </s>
<s> And if you miss some, you could always reconnect the PATA and recopy the missing part. </s>

<s> I've used Acronis to go from multi-partitioned larger drives to smaller drives without a problem. </s>
<s> You shouldn't have too any trouble. </s>
<s> My best advise would be to just take your time and double check your setting before you execute the job. </s>
