<s> I had no problems with the WD drive until this morning. </s>
<s> It is connected to the computer via a USB2 cable. </s>
<s> I turned on the computer. </s>
<s> As the booting was taking place the WD drive powered up but then produced three clicking sounds then a pause then another set of three clicking sounds. </s>
<s> Then the power stayed on but it was not attached as a drive (i.e. </s>
<s> it does not appear as a drive and I have no access to the data stored on it). </s>
<s> Has anyone run into this problem (and what was the solution then)? </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Over in our Storage forum the most succesful recovery is when the owner opens the USB casing and moves the drive into another case. </s>
<s> However if you've been very good about backups you can make it a warranty issue and let them have it. </s>
<s> Example case for IDE drives at http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817716010 Example case for SATA drives at http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817173043 Sorry no. </s>
<s> I can't guess if it's the case but it's the cheap part you want to replace if you want a shot at getting to the files again. </s>

<s> Not that worried about the drive itself. </s>
<s> I can replace that. </s>
<s> I need to recover the data if in fact the symptoms are those of a crashed or crashing drive. </s>
<s> Unfortunately I am out of warantee as of last April. </s>
<s> I am hoping that someone else had this misfortune before and can shed some light. </s>
<s> I am trying to open the case and identify the source of the click. </s>
<s> The click is a very bad sign. </s>
<s> You must try the new case if you must save your files (or put the drive into some desktop.) </s>
<s> The longer it is in a defective enclosure the hopes dim. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I took the drive out of the WD box and put in another enclosure with the same bad results. </s>
<s> I will try tomorrow to put the drive inside the desktop (second bay) and hope. </s>
