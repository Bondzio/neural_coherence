I have partitioned off the good sector (25G) and left the bad part (15G) unallocated using XP's disk management tool and reinstalled XP on the 25GB partition. So far its working well. My question is will the bad part spill over to the good part over time and cause problem? Thanks in advance.

Don't think I've ever heard of a hard disk drive with that large a percent of the space bad If that were mine...I'd be looking to replace it ASAP. Did you test it with the nfgs diags ? Goof Luck

XP stalled at the very start (no 1% even). So I created two partitions, 5GB and 35GB and tried to format the 35GB partition. XP stalled again at the very start. Then I did 10+30. same result. Then when I did 15+25, XP quickly showed 1%, and finished formatting the 25GB on time. Thats what I meant trial and error. I am not a geek and don't have the time to be. This how I do things . If I could do it better in a non-geeky way (without a third party SW, specially non-freeware) I would appreciate letting me know. Thanks

The HD will sooner or later entirely fail. I belive you got &quot;soft errors&quot; or hard error in a certain spot(s) that's not good but confined. The point is, it just isn't good news. Prepare to replace the HD. Far too often a HD dies for one of these reasons, drops or heat damage. Physical drop of laptop(ouch!) or prolonged usage in hot(not well cooled) laptop, the HD actaully works for a time but drift starts to phase in and data becomes corrupted and/or the HD heads actually touch the media due to swelling/expansion of media. You may want to try Spinrite to correct or check into it, its about the best recovery HD s/w out ther for the price, if it doesn't work, then the HD is a goner for sure. Or save that Spinrite cost and apply to new HD. tada -----Willy

Hi, It is almost impossible to have that many faulty sectors on a HD and still being able to use it. If it is working is is totally unreliable and I would replace it at once before you loose your data. If you know sombody who own's &quot;spinrite&quot; you could run that to see what's going on. If you have to buy spinrite, skip that and and spent the money on the new HD. Cheers, Joseph.

Spinrite has got to be the absolute best in surface recovery. If you don't know about it - it is a sort of non-destructive low-level formatter. It low-level formats, high-level formats, pattern tests and then, only if the sector passes all tests does it put the data back. If it fails, the data is transferred to a safe area on the HDD. I've revived loads of drives with it. Ideal for rejuvenating sectors Before they fail. It can also recover data.

Adds: you can repair this file usiing Win2000 CD-Rom. NOW is this Related to BAD SECTORS or is it simply a current bug with that OS?

Go to Hdd's Mfg website and download an Hdd floppy that can check for same and might allow zero-fill. But that wipes the whole Hdd and you'd have to reinstall. As with SpinRite, I've recovered many bad sectors and more of Hdd that way, as the Hdd wasn't failing. The bad sectors got made by data hard errors and sudden power-off.

Bad Sectors do tend to spread over time. YOU CAN fix bad sectors if you really want to save your drive, and the software i recommend for that is HDD Regenerator @ http://www.dposoft.net/ however it is shareware but it can repair the first bad sector it finds. If you have alot of bad sectors like you think you might have then it probably can restore your drive back to good working form if you buy the software, or better yet buy a New Hard Drive as they are not expensive nowadays.

Also, usually when you get a drive RMA'd, they don't make the same drive anymore, so it will usually be replaced with a larger faster better one.

Lost clusters are serious stuff since the os cannot read across them and a crash or freeze results.That crash usually means more data loss or software damage which in turn causes yet more probs. Even when clusters can be restored and got working or at least isolated they can still cause probs eg slow to read/write or the area has got to be skipped by the os,not good !. So on a drive of mine any bad clusters and the drive is from then on is suspect,back ups are taken quick.If they cannot be repaired or any more deteriation is suspected then the drive is scrapped and back ups applied to a new one. Best wishes Chris.

I never found out why it did this but it only lasted 4 months, occuring more frequently as time passed, then no more HDD. HDDs really should be replaced as soon as errors appear as their engineering doesn't leave much time between the first error and a failure that will stop you retrieving your data.

But truthfully, the drive is going and you can lose everything, buy a new HD.
