<s> I have a HP Pavillion notebook zd7380us, with an nvidia geforce fx5700 grafic card, so far I was playing some games without a problem, then it came Doom3 and after completing several levels the computer start crashing, I have done everything from updating drivers, game versions, and still have problems, then it happens that when restarting the laptop on the very first screen before log in, it looks funny with some vertical color lines and white dots, then when it strat to log in to windows the screen goes black, I have repair and reinstall the OS,drivers and even update the BIOS, still I have the problem, if I log in on safe mode the screen comes up and then I disable the display drivers only like this I can log in in to normal windows if I enable the display drivers again, it just goes black once again.....any ideas what might be the cause and how can it be solved? </s>
<s> Apriciate any help given...Thank you. </s>

<s> You have to use HP's latest driver offerings and if it's crashing, call it in under support. </s>
<s> Be ready to wipe the machine and reload but stick with it. </s>
<s> Some get a new motherboard or such until it works. </s>
<s> On the game forums, others have HACKED the NVidia drivers to let you use them on laptops. </s>
<s> But I offer only this information and nothing more. </s>
<s> -&gt; To me, this is a warranty issue and possible bad hardware. </s>

<s> Thank you Bob, I have done a lot of things acording with HP suport, from reparing and reinstalling the OS, last thing they suggested was to use an utility called active killdisk, I have downloaded but it wont work since is the free version and would only do a zero phase erasing, What would you suggest, do you think this will work, and is there another free utility that would do the same has killdisk??? </s>
<s> I believe as you said that might be a problem with the grafic card it self, since eve while runing DOS I have the white dots on the screen. </s>
<s> Thanks, Daniel. </s>
