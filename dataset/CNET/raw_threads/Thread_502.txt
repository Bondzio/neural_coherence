Hello, I just bought a notebook with that being its processor, and now am having some serious second thoughts. I know that the Celeron is for the &quot;budget&quot; users, and does not hold up too good when compared to the Pentium M. My question is, the Celeron M Processor is 1.50GHz/1MB Cache/400MHz FSB and the Pentium M Processor 730 is 1.60 GHz/2MB Cache/533MHz FSB To me it looks like its just a small difference. I mean, its just a .1 difference for the # of Ghz, and 1 MB for the Cache, etc. What do these numbers mean anyway? Can somebody explain it relatively? Would a .1 difference in Ghz be that big? If it would help, I'll be using my notebook for lots of multitasking, but just between word documents, internet, playing mp3's and small videos. I wont edit videos on it or anything, but will want to watch DVD's and download music. And for gaming, just want to play Sims 2.

As for the fsb speed, it determines your multiplier, which determines your clock speed. So 1.5 won't make much of a difference to 1.6. Usually if you customize a notebook, you can upgrade to a 1.6 for little $$$. The main difference is the features. The 370 lacks certain features that the Pentium M comes with. BTW, good luck playing sims 2, i believe you need a direct x 9.0c compatible gfx card. Now the gma 900, which proabbly comes with your system supports it i think, but ppl had problems with it. ROger

Now I know I should've bought the more expensive one, but hey. Alright, so what other features does the Pentium have that the Celeron doesn't?

You can search for the answer to your question there... But as you've already in grief, i'll answer it for you. The main difference is enhanced speedstep which is only for centrino systems (not actually confined to that as it has migrated to desktops). Enhanced Intel SpeedStep technology Enhanced Intel SpeedStep technology enables real-time dynamic switching of the VOLTAGE and FREQUENCY between two performance modes based on processor DEMAND. This occurs by SWITCHING the system bus ratios, core operating voltage, and core processor SPEEDS without resetting the system. It lets you have more battery life. The Celeron M is only a cut-down Pentium M as the Celeron D is a cutdown of the Pentium 4. Roger
