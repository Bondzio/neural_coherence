<s> I have a small home network that I use for watching movies. </s>
<s> My videos are stored on my wired system and I access the shared folders on my wireless computer connected to my TV. </s>
<s> I have trouble watching large hd movies. </s>
<s> I open my shared network folder, then open the video like I would if it was a local file. </s>
<s> Is there a way I can force the file to open with UDP instead of TCP? </s>
<s> Yes, but no because you might not be up to re-writing apps as in altering the code, compiling and changing it. </s>
<s> And before I go any further UDP is for when you want to build your own system of transfer as you design the error checking. </s>
<s> So absolutely yes but are you up to the task? </s>
<s> That is, it is rare a setting. </s>
