i've searched cnet and read a few threads but im still not sure.
i've read that vista 32bit only recognize 2gb?
and the 64bit one can recognize more.
i'm using window xp pro,and recently i've added 2x 1gb ddr2 ram to my pc.
when i right click my computer,properties, it says there is 2.98 gb(2x 1gb,2x 512mb) installed.
but what i don't understand is that, why some of my other programs only detect my total ram as 2gb ?
i've installed some ram cleaner program(such as ram booster,and some other to cross check) and they says my computer ram is 2gb only.
i've ran cpuz and it detects all 3gb,all of them have the same specification except one.
here's links to 4 printscreen of cpuz of my rams.
does the mis-recognize affect the actual total amount of ram that my pc runs on?
is there any methods i could use to make my pc recognize the other 1gb of ram?
thnks in advance.
