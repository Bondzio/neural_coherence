1.13.1	1680 x 1050 is the best setting for this monitor and what I use .	St
1.14.1	Wrong question ! ! !	St
1.14.2	The correct question is : What is the native resolution of your display to have the expected picture quality ?	Ques
1.14.3	It is recommendable to use always the native resulution of the display instead of an induvidual setting .	St
1.14.4	Before you purchase a display you have the chance to select the preferable resolution and screen size based on the performance of your video card .	St
1.14.5	Also here you will find out soon that the variety will be limited .	St
1.15.1	1,024x768 pixels dell 2407 It is the best configuration for size of icons and text for my eyesight , and to get the most icons on the desktop without it seeming to get cluttered .	St

1.16.2	2,560x1,440 which is the full res on this machine 's monitor for photography work .	St
1.17.1	Surely the resolution you use is determined by the particular task being performed at any given time as most monitors have several suitable resolutions available .	St
1.18.1	I use WQXGA , that is 2560x1600 on 30 & quot ; Dell monitor .	St
1.18.2	Such displays are expensive but the compfort of work is extreme , especially if you are a professional designer , programmer or you worh with many open windows .	St

1.19.1	1920x1080 on 32 inch Philips TV .	St
1.20.1	There are lots of variables : 1 ) Size of screen 2 ) Quality of monitor/screen 3 ) Quality and capability of Video card 4 ) Personal preference , depending on one 's eyes .	St
1.21.1	Usually , the higher the screen resolution is , the better the image is .	St
1.21.2	So , the maximun resolution offered by the monitor should be used .	St
1.21.3	The monitor 's aspect ratio is important here .	St
1.21.4	For gaming and watching HD movies , an aspect ratio of 16:9 is prefered .	St
1.21.5	For general PC usage , a 8:5 ( 16:10 ) aspect ratio is better .	St
1.21.6	The resolution used for gaming also depends on the power of the GPU .	St
1.21.7	Putting all these into consideration , a 24 inch monitor with an aspect ratio of 8:5 used at a resolution of 1920 x 1200 pixels is a good choice for general usage , gaming and watching HD movies..	St

1.25.1	I have 1680x1050 on my 15 & quot ; laptop .	St
1.25.2	I find it to be a good compromise in size .	St
1.25.3	I do n't want too high a resolution because I 'm afraid everything will be too small and lower resolution means I ca n't fit as much on the screen .	St
1.25.4	Unfortunately newer laptops do n't seem to offer this resolution anymore .	St
1.26.1	I agree with jsmith29 , 1920 x 1080 is ideal .	St
1.26.2	Used to be the HD highest res .	St
1.26.3	for TV 's , but now a days a lot of PC monitors use this ( 16:9 ) res too .	St
1.26.4	Great for games and native for blu ray .	St
1.27.1	P.S .	St
1.27.2	It goes without saying , that you will want to run anything ( desktop , games , etc ) at your screens native res , as long as your GPU is up to it !	St
1.28.1	1920x 1080 on the LG 22.5 & quot ; and 1280x1024 on Acer 19 & quot ; Great on the LG , but it blooms on the 19 inch to where I loose some of the sides .	St
1.28.2	I guess because one is wide format the other is not ?	Ques

1.34.1	I do n't recall ever seeing such varied replies to a cnet poll .	St

1.46.1	1,600x1,250 on a 22 & quot ; monitor	St
1.47.1	nuf said	St
1.48.1	Indeed , but when it comes to monitors the best resolution will always be the one native to your display ( in my case 1920x1080 ) .	St
1.48.2	There are some exceptions such as system resource heavy games .	St
1.48.3	If you do n't have a powerful enough setup ( Modern GPU , atleast 4GB memory etc . )	St
1.48.4	The game will perform much better if you lower the res. , while keeping the same aspect ratio .	St
1.48.5	Other than that , always set to native resolution .	St
1.49.1	1920 x 1080 on a Samsung 2333HD , 23 & quot ; .	St

1.49.3	It was also one of the few that just barely fit under my kitchen cabinets .	St
1.49.4	Very happy with it , although , the built-in speakers are barely adequate .	St
1.49.5	I suspect that most of the & quot ; other & quot ; votes were also 1920 x 1080 , as this seems to be the most common offering these days .	St
1.49.6	You can get a 22 to 24 incher sometimes less than $ 150 .	St
1.49.7	I could n't even find a 1280 x 1024 to replace my old 19 & quot ; when it died .	St
1.49.8	For those who intentionally set the resolution lower than the native resolution so that they can see text and icons better , Windows does allow you to increase the text and icon sizes without lowering the resolution , giving you the best of both worlds .	St
1.49.9	It does n't always yield ideal results , but is worth trying .	St
