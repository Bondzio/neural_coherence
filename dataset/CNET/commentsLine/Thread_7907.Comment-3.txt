to consider getting a good video card which means avoid ati's current offerings (radeon x series models 300-850 lack sm3.0 and fp32, which means they lack features that are good to have, and radeon x 1300-1800 draw a ton of power and cost a fortune as their just being launched) nvidia's geforce 6800 and 7800 series are excellent choices for a processor i'd consider amd's athlon64 1gb of dual channel ddr 400 a decent motherboard from dfi or msi good psu from antec, enermax, or ocz 200gb-400gb hard drive, depending on what you want to store (honestly 80gb is fine, 2 80gb's is what i've got and it's more than i need) pcie is a good idea, and beyond that i'm gonna say windowsxp home edition or pro, linux won't support as many games/will require more work to get the few games it does support working i'd say just go onto newegg.com, and look around arctic silver isn't required, but it's a really good idea find a parts configuration that you think works post it back and i'd be happy to comment, and i'm sure so would damasta
