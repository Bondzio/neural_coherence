1.1.1	i have a computer in the upstiars of my home and its connected to the internet via a wireless router (linksys wireless g) that is connected to my computer via the ubs port.	St
1.1.2	when i go on the computer i get the icon in my tray saying its conencted to the internet but at a low strength is there way to change the strength of the signal?	St
1.2.1	So you have 2 PCs, one is connected wirelessly and one is connected via the USB cable to the router?	St
1.2.2	If this is the case, then it seems the only way to increase the signal to your wireless PC is to move the PC closer to the router (the cheap solution) or move the router closer to the wireless PC, or buy a range extender ($$).	St
