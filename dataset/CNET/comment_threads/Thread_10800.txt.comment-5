Ludedude is right.
You probably have a x586, PII or PIII, a good system to rehab.
Look see what ram it is, 168pin?
(pc66 pc100?)
what size hard drive?
EXCEPT, you'll need different mobo drivers for Win98 or WinXP (if it's fast enough).
I suspect the mobo went south because it doesn't read properly, if you are correct.
Win2k drivers for modem-sound might be twitchy to find, as well as software.
Is it FAT32 or NTFS?
What do you mean by backup?
