I turned my monitor on and after a few seconds the screen went black.
I did this multiple times with the same thing happening and now it's working fine but I know if I turn it off when I go to turn it back on it will turn black after a few seconds.
Same thing happens with it connected to my laptop so I know it's not my computer.
It is a really old monitor so I think maybe it's just failing I just want to be sure before I buy a new one.
So what do you guys think is there anyway to fix it or do I just need to buy a new one.
I just don't understand why it keeps going black and then one time it will work fine, I've had it on for an hour or so and have had no problems.
