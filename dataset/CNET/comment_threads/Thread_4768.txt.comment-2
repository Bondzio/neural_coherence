If it is what I am thinking, it is a standard 101 or 102 key board.
But this particular board is a bit thiner, more narrow and less wide.
It is of simple rectangular design, and the keys a bit smaller in over-all design.
It seems Dell has been including this smaller keyboard with lower end products for a couple of years now.
Probably just for over-all product and shipping costs savings.
The System Information probably doesn't identify it as anything other than generic 101/102 standard keyboard.
If you have this system, Belarc Adviser may be able to ID it a little more thoroughly.
