<s> I am using arctic cooling freezer 7 as my cpu fan and my cpu temperature is 40 C idle and 60 C fully loaded. </s>
<s> I think it is pretty high and it may reduce my cpu life. </s>
<s> Should I get a better CPU heatsink? </s>
<s> Any suggestions? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> computer spec: 3.2ghz pentium 4 640 </s>
<s> gotten an AMD. </s>
<s> They outperform and consume much less power. </s>
<s> I have a p4 630 and the temps are about 2-4 deg c higher than yours and I think they run that way. </s>
<s> BTW, my temp was not that high. </s>
<s> It was 36 idle and 47 loaded. </s>
<s> After i replaced my powersupply (it was burnt), i think i touched the heatsink during the process and no matter how i mounted and tighten the heatsink, it is not as good as it was b4. </s>
<s> Im sure it has nothin to do with the psu because i replaced with the same one. </s>
<s> I think it's just my heatsink clamps are not as tight as it was b4 </s>
