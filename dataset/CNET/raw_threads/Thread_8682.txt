The options for dvd and cd drives seem to be endless these days. I want to be able to burn audio CDs, and also use have the ability to transfer videos and pics onto DVDs for storage, and of course use DVDs for backups of my hard drive data. I know I want two drives - but what makes the most sense these days? A dvd burner and cd burner? Or if I can use the DVD burner to make audio cds, then maybe just a cd rom? I don't have a good understanding of what is compatible with what drive - so I find it a bit confusing - hope someone can help!

TODAY, you may see Dell or HP trying to sell you (at a premium no less) some DVD+R/W or DVD-R/W drive. Since I can get an ALL FORMAT DVD+/- R/W drive that also can do CDR/W media with software for 99 bucks, then this is a solution that I'd consider. As to the other drive, it's your choice what goes there. CDROM drives are about free. CDRW drives are seen in bulk at 10 to 20 bucks (no comments about quality...) So keep shopping and have fun. Bob

I may be mistaken - but doesn't that void the warranty? And though I used to try and do this stuff myself, these days I'd rather not - too busy. So I'd still have to carry it off somewhere. So given my preferences...would it still be better to add the drives later? And can you explain what a &quot;ALL FORMAT DVD+/- R/W&quot; is actually? I had read that eventually CD-specific drives are going to go away and the DVD drives will handle both applications. Is this what you are referring to?

Keep pestering them to supply what you want. 2. &quot;what a &quot;ALL FORMAT DVD+/- R/W&quot; is actually?&quot; A DVD recorder that can use the following media: DVD-R DVD-R/W DVD+R DVD+R/W CD-R CD-R/W and if you get one that does DVD-RAM, then that's OK, but it seems to be a passing standard. I don't see the media widely distributed. 3. &quot;I had read that eventually CD-specific drives are going to go &quot; With DVD recorders under 99 bucks, I agree. Bob
