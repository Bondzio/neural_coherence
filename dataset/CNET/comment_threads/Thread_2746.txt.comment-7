I had a similar problem.
My Linkstation is plugged into a Linksys switch.
I could ping it and open the configuration page through a web browser.
But when I typed \\Linkstation, I got the message 'network path not found'.
Buffalo tech support asked me to turn off my Firewall (I Use Norton) temporarily and retry.
I was then able to access the drive.
I then entered the IP address for the Linkstation in the trusted site tab in Norton and turned the firewall back on.
I have not had problems since.
Good Luck
