Proffitt	6/18/13 8:20 AM	1.3715436E12	You can't	If you've been around there is a race between games that tax the hardware and hardware that improves and provides more CPU/GPU power. If you reach some plateau then you have to improve or replace the PC or parts. It's a shame you only posted what you did and not the reason you did all this latency testing. In itself it's just a test and doesn't mean there is a real problem to solve. Also, not a word about your Pentium 4 machine? Bob

You always run into clients that tell you how many fans are on the case or &quot;it's not heat.&quot; I don't see the video (could have missed it) but you see the 8800's and others failing now. You asked about latency so let's read this from toms. &quot;Our tests demonstrate fairly little difference between a $225 LGA 1155 Core i5-2500K and a $1000 LGA 2011 Core i7-3960X, even when three-way graphics card configurations are involved. It turns out that memory bandwidth and PCIe throughput don't hold back the performance of existing Sandy Bridge-based machines. &quot; http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-cpu-review-overclock,3106-4.html Since you have a nearly same CPU and it can drive three cards without much issue, your issue must be somewhere else. If it's crashing, then you know to try the usual. Ask if you didn't know. Bob

12697	11	595399	5468821	5468804	R. Proffitt	6/18/13 9:07 AM	1.37154642E12	Spelling it out.	I missed what video card is in use. When I see such I replace the heat sink compounds as we can't see what the original builder did. Be sure to nod and smile at your client but do the work. Leave the side cover off and point some fan at it and try again. If it crashes take the inventory of the machine to ask if others are seeing this. Bob

12697	14	595399	5470687	5468960	BlazeKousuike	6/24/13 2:00 AM	1.3720392E12	not yet changed anything	I didn't clean the heatsink yet but I noticed what's the problem here I checked the cpu usage while running the gpu on 100% it only takes 5 to 10% of cpu usage but when my cpu and gpu are 100% loaded he can't do that 5 to 10% cpu usage correctly hence the framerate spike drops I do get this problem with games because it probably taxes my cpu too much as well I thought he would just lower the framerate of th gpu to compensate the load on the cpu but apperently i'm wrong

Sure, you could do the usual BIOS and driver updates and hope but this one is back to it's makers since it's failing when new. Bob
