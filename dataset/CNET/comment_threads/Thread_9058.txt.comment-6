I found some phrases that might help: &quot;Unbuffered&quot;... &quot;Set Timings&quot;... After reading about setting timings, It sounds very important but I am even more confused...I found another topic on the message boards about this one person with a completely customized computer and had 2 different types of timings and that resulted in crashes.
This new chip will be 2 of 2 chips because that is what my present motherboard has.
It only has 2 slots.
How do I read what the timings are on my existing chip to make sure they are the same as the additional chip??
Which timings are the most recommended...??
I do not know the name of the motherboard.
It is just whatever usually came with a SR1053WM machine.
