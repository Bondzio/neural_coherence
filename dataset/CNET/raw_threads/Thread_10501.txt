It has a 4 pin connection, but all the fan's I'm seeing online has a &quot;round&quot; pin instead of a &quot;Square&quot; pin connection. Below is what mine looks like. http://img.misco.eu/resources/images/products/106/SRH/FA/FAN4EXT12//FAN4EXT12_500x500 . But this is all I'm seeing online(Round hole): http://www.dvinfo.net/forum/attachments/non-linear-editing-pc/7552d1210860165-powering-two-9800gtx-gpus-enough-connectors-800px-molex_female_connector.jpg Will it work?

Looks like a 4 wire&gt;4 wire splice job. The molex/round pin is a common connector. That square pin connector may be a specialty item.

Yes I could get all technical on you but that one is so you can tap power from the usual ATX power supply. The square one looks to be the rare 4 pin that has RPM and possibly temperature sensing. I won't discuss the latter without full details on the host PC. Bob

So I bought a 120mm fan for intake on the side of the case but didn't realize it has &quot;Round&quot; pin holes. Do you know if there is an adapter I can buy? Or? I only paid $4 for the fan so it's not like I'm out anything but would still like to use it.

Your link in the first post was dead so is your second post link what you actually have or the type you think you need? If you have the standard molex type, only two of the pins will be wired as this type connects directly to your PS an not on the motherboard. It won't be speed controlled unless it has internal circuitry to do so or a speed selector switch. If the molex type, you connect it to the PS with no special adapter needed. Most such fans I've seen already have a adapter if no free PS plugs exist.

Anyways, I have 2 connections on my motherboard. One is the &quot;CPU&quot; fan which is a &quot;Square&quot; 3 pin, and the other is a &quot;System&quot; fan(What it shows in Bios) connection that is a &quot;Square&quot; 4 pin(Same as the picture in post #2) The issue is, the fan I bought has a Molex plug in. I found an adapter that should hook up to the mobo and use the molex fan. And like you said, it seems I(The Mobo) won't be able to control the fan speed if I went that route correct? It looks like I can buy a touchscreen fan controller but if I'm running just 1 fan it seems kind of pointless.
