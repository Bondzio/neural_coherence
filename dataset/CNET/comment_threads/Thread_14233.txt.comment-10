Hmmm....If your computer/motherboard was designed for DDR2100 then the later designed computers for 2700 or still later designed computers for 3200 would make no difference on your 2100 designed MB.
Course you can up your RAM beyond 512MB but your computer if designed for 2100 would show no improvement using 2700 or 3200.
Crucial.com will tell you what type and max RAM for your particular computer.
Personally, I have not heard of any speed increase in gaming for RAM over 512MB, except for bragging about having XXX RAM.
Higher RAM for video editing and other intense graphics work may be necessary and advisable.
