1.1.1	I need help with a small office network .	St
1.1.2	I currently share an office with another company and want to restrict them from seeing my computers .	St
1.1.3	I have 3 machines all running XP .	St
1.1.4	I have a linksys wireless router that all three are connected to .	St
1.1.5	I have an connection from the internet going to the correct port on the router .	St
1.1.6	I only want two of the three machines to have internet access but I would like all three machines on the intranet because they all share files .	St
1.1.7	How can I configure my machines and router to accomplish this task ?	Ques
1.2.1	I 'm assuming this router is yours .	St
1.2.2	If so , after all your PCs are set up and running wireless , turn off SSID on the router .	St
1.2.3	Make sure you are running WPA/2 for encryption .	Res
1.2.4	SSID broadcasts its presence to all PCs .	St
1.2.5	When you turn it off , only PCs that have been identified and logged in will see it .	St
1.2.6	Yes , this can be overcome by specific software that sniffs out signals .	St
1.2.7	But hopefully the other business is more professional .	St
1.3.1	That seems simple enough !	St
1.3.2	Firstly , yes the wireless router I am using is owned by me .	St
1.3.3	But the one additional question I have is I do NOT want one particular computer on my network to access the Internet , but I do want it to be able to communicate with other computers and network printers .	St
1.3.4	How would I do this ?	Ques
1.3.5	Setup ip 's on router ?	Ques
1.3.6	I 'm not certain .	Res
1.3.7	Thanks to anyone who can help .	Ques
1.4.1	since all my PCs have full access , I 've never done this .	St
1.4.2	Maybe someone else will chime in .	St
1.4.3	There is probably a setting in the router .	St
1.4.4	You might look into the configuration .	St
1.4.5	It may jump out at you .	St
1.5.1	http : //www.google.com/search ? hl=en & source=hp & q=linksys+router+setup+block+ports finds how to block ports on your common linksys router .	St
1.5.2	Sorry that I ca n't offer a STEP BY STEP but what you want to do is two steps .	St
1.5.3	1 .	St
1.5.4	Use DHCP RESERVATION so that machine always gets a specific IP assigned .	St
1.5.5	2 .	St
1.5.6	With that IP noted we use the articles above to block PORT 80 ( example ) to that one IP entry .	St
1.5.7	Blam .	St
1.5.8	No more Web browsing for them .	St
1.5.9	Now block more ports as needed .	St
1.5.10	Bob	St
