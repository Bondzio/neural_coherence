<s> Have an ipod and Maxtor 3100 external hard drive running Windox XP Professional on Dell D600. </s>
<s> Can connect each individually through USB with no problem. </s>
<s> If ipod is plugged in while external hard drive is connected, Windows XP indicates &quot;USB Device not recognized&quot;. </s>
<s> Likewise if ipod has been connected by itself working fine, then connect external drive, ipod no longer recognized. </s>
<s> Can someone help? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> With just XP, USB 2.0 is not supported. </s>
<s> With XP SP1, USB 2.0 started to function but we couldh't run CHKDSK on the USB 2.0 hard disk. </s>
<s> Finally with XP SP2 we could run CHKDSK on out USB 2.0 hard disks. </s>
<s> Your post didn't note the SP1 or SP2 and many won't install SP2 (their choice). </s>
<s> I can only share that some fixes were in SP2 but I can't find a document revealing what Microsoft fixed. </s>
<s> This is not an offer to fix your issue, but a comment about SP1, SP2 and how it matters in USB 2.0 Bob </s>
<s> I had a similar problem with almost the exact same hardware (D610 instead of the D600). </s>
<s> My problem was intermittent in that sometimes my computer could recognize both USB devices at the same time, but most of the time it couldn't (very infuriating). </s>
<s> I believe I've fixed it by uninstalling Itunes and Ipod updater, installing the latest Bios Update and the Dell Notebook System Software, and reinstalling itunes and ipod. </s>
<s> Go to http://support.dell.com/support/downloads/ select you computer and OS and find both updates under the following: FlashBIOS Updates Dell Latitude D610 System BIOS System and Configuration Utilities Dell Notebook System Software Hopes this helps I finally came upon this solution after trying everything else on the apple website. </s>
<s> I too have a dell and when the external hard drive is plugged in and i connect the ipod the hard drive locks up. </s>
<s> my Dell can still detect them both but the hard drive becomes useless because I cannot move any files that are related to the external hard drive around, and the point of having one was because i have to much music to store on the regular computer. </s>
<s> I tried updating my computer by installing &quot;USB 2.0 driver version 2.7&quot; but when i restarted the computer the problem still existed. </s>
<s> I would appreciate it greatly if anyone knows what to do. </s>
<s> As I noted there is no USB 2.0 support in XP. </s>
<s> I noted when it appeared. </s>
<s> The reason is simple why we have to know. </s>
<s> There are some that do not want to install SP1, SP2 or SP3. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> This has always been an issue for xp sp1 users, complaints rolled in like rapid water floods directly to MS. </s>
<s> The same goes with DX 10, why not release the driver for xp? </s>
<s> Well, mr bill wants you to buy vista, thats all. </s>
<s> Anyhoo, USB 2.0 is supported with any service pack, please go here http://support.microsoft.com/kb/329632 </s>
<s> Thanks for the links that validate why we ask about Service Packs. </s>
<s> -&gt; Here's another nugget. </s>
<s> In XP SP1 some of our external hard disks would mysteriously need a chkdsk. </s>
<s> After SP2 that problem vanished but we never could tell exactly where in the release documents Microsoft tweaked that. </s>
<s> More fun at http://www.engadget.com/tag/zune30 </s>
<s> Here's an article on Apple's support site that may help. </s>
