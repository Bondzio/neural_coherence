hi.
today i just buy my western digital my book live 1tb network storage this is first time im using wd nas i successfully installed windows 7 x64 on my computer this week, but the computer sometimes loses contact with my wd 1tb book live nas(when trying to copy big file).
when this happens, i restart the computer, and the drive usually reappears.
i just bought this hard drive two days ago.
instead of simply failing to recognize it, i sometimes get &quot;not responding&quot; errors when trying to open files.
here the screen shot
