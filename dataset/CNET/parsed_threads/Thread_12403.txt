<s> i'm looking for a expansion slot expander card. </s>
<s> for example: 1 PCI Express to 2 PCI (i know these exist but i dont know where to buy one) or 1 SATA to 2 SATAs etc any ideas? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> On the PCI buss each slot has it's own interrupt to the PCI chipset controller. </s>
<s> A slot expander can't add this needed signal. </s>
<s> Similar issues for PCI Express. </s>
<s> As to sata, you might look at adding drives on USB 2.0. </s>
<s> Not as fast but pretty fast. </s>

<s> In the Dell GX260 Desktop there is a card that splits a PCI Express to 2 PCIs. </s>
<s> I KNOW THEY WORK, EXIST ETC, b/c i've used both at once. </s>
<s> I dont know how, believe me I thought a/b exactly what you said, then i put an ethernet card and a firewire card in the slots and used them simultaneously. </s>
<s> so i KNOW they work...just dont know how or where to get one. </s>
<s> The maker of the machine has to design both pieces. </s>
<s> This is not something in the basic Intel design. </s>
<s> I can see where people may think it's a standard. </s>
<s> As to getting the part, you just revealed where. </s>
<s> Dell. </s>
<s> Call and order it. </s>
<s> Will it work? </s>
