<s> We have a Dell Dimension 8200, with Pentium 4, 2.4 ghz, 1MB RAM, running windows XP, Home Edition 2002 we have 80GB of memory on an internal hard drive and it is full. </s>
<s> We also may be the last people with a bulky Dell D1025HTX monitor having not upgraded to flat screen yet. </s>
<s> Our system has been running into trouble recently. </s>
<s> 1) We replaced the graphics card this spring since the last one died and now have a NVIDIA GeForce 6200 A-LE which is working fine it seems. </s>
<s> 2) the whole system is VERY slow at times - ie. </s>
<s> opening excel, quicken, and explorer will take a couple of minutes - no kidding (geological time compared to my work laptop.) </s>
<s> We use it for common home uses - pictures, video of kids, internet, some light games (we are not gamers per se but have two kids who may want to do this in the next couple of years); quicken; excel applications; itunes; etc. </s>
<s> So the question(s) are: 1) is there hope for a cost effective upgrade scenario? </s>
<s> What was crossing my mind would be to do some combo like upgrade RAM, get an external Hard drive, replace the monitor with a nice flat screen, and get a cost-effective HP laptop around $750 range to add to our home wireless network etc. </s>
<s> Or, would we just be rearranging deck chairs on our Titanic old Dell? </s>
<s> 2) If we decide to go 'new' what are the best home systems and combos out there? </s>
<s> It has been more than 5 years since I was into this and researched this stuff so I have no idea what are the key factors/components for speed, processing, RAM, hard drive size, etc etc. </s>
<s> I used to be relatively good with computers and still feel fairly confident (ie. </s>
<s> can open it up and replace cards and parts etc.) </s>
<s> But our system is so sluggish and iffy that it is clear we need to do something to make this useful again. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance for your help and ideas - all are welcome. </s>
<s> Choice of monitor (CRT or LCD) is irrelevant for performance and independent of old or new PC. </s>
<s> All you need to do, in my opinion: 1. clean install of the OS (including formatting the disk) 2. add a second (internal!) </s>
<s> hard disk if you really need more disk space (#1 tends to free a lot of space because all kinds of rubbish is deleted, but - of course - you might have 60 Gb of music and photo's that you restore and then it's full again) There's absolutely nothing wrong with 1 Gb and a 2.4 GHz Pentium 4 for Windows XP, and no reason why it should be slower than it was when it was new. </s>

<s> 1) why your emphasis on 'internal' hard drive? </s>
<s> I have read about good very large externals that seem easy to use. </s>
<s> 2) thank you for the suggestion of a clean install of XP. </s>
<s> Would I need to move or temporarily store pictures and such if we are reformatting the disk? </s>
<s> If you go to our Storage forum http://forums.cnet.com/5204-7588_102-0.html?forumID=70&tag=forum.fd you'll see quite a number of posts about failing external hard disks. </s>
<s> And hardly any on failing internal ones. </s>
<s> That's my reason to recommend an internal one for daily use and use externals for transport and a backup copy only. </s>
<s> Convince yourself! </s>
<s> The standard Windows XP installation CD has the option to start over with a clean windows (and probably program files) folder and keep your My Documents. </s>
<s> But quite a few PC's come with a restore CD that brings the machine back to factory conditions. </s>
<s> My recommendation would be to buy an external hard disk (use if for a backup copy in the future) and copy all your pictures and such to it. </s>
<s> It's nice to have a backup copy, even if you don't need it at the moment. </s>
<s> Of course, with most models you can take out the disk (be sure it's IDE, I don't think your PC has SATA already) and 'promote' it to an internal drive. </s>
<s> Then this would only cost you the case, and that's some $25. </s>
<s> I suppose your pictures are worth that much! </s>
<s> On the long run I'd recommend both an internal disk (if the current 80Gb isn't enough) and an external one for a backup copy. </s>
<s> But that might be a nice Santaclaus or birthday present, if you've got a copy of all your current data on both the old and the new internal disk. </s>

<s> I suspect your issue is that hd that is full....very bad. </s>
<s> Grab a copy of Ccleaner...use google. </s>
<s> Install it. </s>
<s> Click on the analyze button. </s>
<s> See what it has to say. </s>
<s> Uninstall those old unneeded progs. </s>
<s> Archive some of those pics...docs...vids. </s>
<s> Check the e-mail area. </s>
<s> Some folks keep every piece of mail they ever sent or received. </s>
<s> The folders can get huge. </s>
<s> Your question to Kee's about the need to save Your Stuff before a format seems to imply the you don't already have Your Stuff backed up...very bad. </s>
<s> A new LCD monitor will save you loads of electricity and deskspace. </s>
<s> A monitor you get today can be used with whatever computers you get in the years to come. </s>
<s> An external hard drive is easy to use with other computers, as that's one of the tasks they're designed and used for. </s>
<s> You can get the kind that plug into the wall, or the portable kind that runs off USB. </s>
<s> Those sorts of investments will pay ahead, in that when you scrap this aging system, the devices will work well with a new one. </s>
<s> Some things that won't play well in the future: RAM on the old guy won't be usable in a new computer. </s>
<s> You list &quot;1 MB&quot; -- did you mean 1 GB of RAM? </s>
<s> Or 128 MB? </s>
<s> If it's 1 GB=1024 MB, that's plenty enough. </s>
<s> Internal hard drive: a new very large hard drive could be had for the Dell for under $100. </s>
<s> But it's the old style PATA/EIDE wide-ribbon cable. </s>
<s> So that drive won't match up with new systems' SATA II. </s>
<s> You can still run them in new systems, but... Buying EIDE internal drives is investing in 10yrs old technology. </s>
<s> The old system seems like it is in dire need of maintenance. </s>
<s> Who's gonna do it? </s>
<s> How much is their time worth to you? </s>
<s> For just a few hours work you could have a system that performs pretty much as it did when new. </s>
<s> On the flip side, for just a little bit of money you could purchase a new system that greatly outperforms your old Dell, as even the low-end current machines are a couple generations newer. </s>
<s> As you allude, a nice laptop can be had for pretty cheap nowadays, and its mobility can really be nice, even if it's mostly a home computer. </s>
<s> Bob, Indeed - I have been trying to clean it for the past few weeks (uninstalling programs); but also all e-mail is web based for us, so we have not storage on here for that. </s>
<s> Duly noted on the back-up - for that I have been negligent and plan to address that 1st. </s>
<s> I downloaded CCleaner and used it just now and that was helpful to some degree. </s>
<s> Thanks for the ideas </s>
<s> dear squirtlewa: thanks for all the ideas. </s>
<s> here are some follow-up questions/comments that now come to mind... 1) LCD monitor - yes, I was curous about the power issue too - the monitor is from 1997 I think. </s>
<s> 2) Sorry for the RAM - it is indeed 1GB, not MB; 3) If I can figure out how to restore eveything I need after reinstalling XP, then I think I can manage the time to do it myself. </s>
<s> However, would you suggest any service that is good for projects like this? </s>
<s> Geek squad or the like? </s>
<s> I have never used anyone like that. </s>
<s> 4) I get your point about the internal HD issue - I think... </s>
<s> So I could buy internal HD of much larger size, but it owuld have to be PATA and therefore would also be out of date and essentially stalling the inevitable. </s>
<s> 5) Re the laptop - I think where I am heading is to a) get a good external HD that will last beyond this system and clear a lot of space on the HD; b) try the OS reinstall and reformat as suggested to improve performance; c) get a LCD; d) get a cost effective laptop to hook into our wireless network here. </s>
<s> 1) you will feel a lot better with a new monitor -- cooler cheaper and easier on the eyes 2) 1 GB is plenty for that system 3) Sounds like you can do it yourself. </s>
<s> Geek Squad is the only nationwide services company I know. </s>
<s> I'm positive there'd be some smaller local business with capable services, too. </s>
<s> You're talking a good bit of time -- there's no way to speed up a system install, and even if the tech is spending a bit of time watching the progress bar, that's still labor. </s>
<s> It's one of those things -- some people want to DIY, others just want it to work right. </s>
<s> Myself, I clean my own bathroom, but hire the lawn mowed. </s>
<s> 4+5) sounds like a really good plan. </s>
<s> That way if something unpleasant turns up while workin on the OS, you have a backup disk and a plan to move ahead without committing too much to the old system. </s>
<s> My hunch is you'll get it cleaned up and be happy with it for a while longer. </s>
<s> We have a small home network with this desktop computer and I want to be able to network with my work laptop and a new laptop we plan to buy for home use. </s>
<s> Since our desktop is strained, we are going to get either a Network Attached Storage Drive or a regular external hard drive. </s>
<s> I am reading reviews and suggestions on each but am not sure how I should choose betwen the two. </s>
<s> The high rated, lwer costs NAS is in the $300+ range (on up to very expensive); while the high rated External is in the $175-200 range. </s>
<s> So what would spending the extra $100-$150 for an NAS get me now and in the future when I upgrade things? </s>
<s> Please advise. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> You've boiled it down nicely what the distinction is. </s>
<s> The answer to it, however, is something each person needs to decide for themselves. </s>
<s> With a NAS you can access from all computers at the same time, and from off-site, too. </s>
<s> But you could nearly get 2 regular units for the price of one networked... </s>
<s> The answer to the question boils down to how much is it worth to you for the freedom of not having to move the HDD back-n-forth? </s>
<s> Understand also that from a compliance point of view, ease of use means people will typically be better about following a regimen. </s>
<s> With networked you can set it up so that backups are gonna happen no matter what. </s>
<s> If you're using a &quot;sneaker network,&quot; there's more risk that someone will say &quot;oh, I&quot;ll do that backup tomorrow, I can't be Aed to move the HDD.&quot; which will lead to data loss... </s>
<s> I appreciate the point of view on the NAS vs External. </s>
