<s> I have an external HDD assembled using a 3.5&quot; 1 TB SATA internal HDD and a casing. </s>
<s> The unit was powered by the casing adapter and all worked fine until we had a power fluctuation and after that, the drive was not detected and kept creating clicking sounds. </s>
<s> Going through various suggestions posted on the net, I tried freezing, heating, tapping and everything else there was to do, but to no avail. </s>
<s> The clicking continued and the drive would not be recognized. </s>
<s> To avoid fluctuations, I had removed the casing & adapter and had connected this HDD directly to an SMPS, but the clicking went on. </s>
<s> However, as I connected another PATA external HDD to the molex connector of the SMPS, the first HDD's clicking came to a halt and the HDD came to life. </s>
<s> All drives are now visible in Windows and I'm in the process of backing up the data. </s>
<s> Whenever the PATA HDD is disconnected from the SMPS, the SATA HDD gets disconnected and starts clicking again. </s>
<s> This is the weirdest thing I've ever encountered and have no clue what's making this happen. </s>
<s> Why is the presence of another HDD connected to the SMPS making the SATA HDD not work ??? </s>
<s> Has anyone else come across a similar situation or have any solution ?? </s>
<s> ? </s>
<s> It was noted in old drives and we chalked it up to a drive that was going to die. </s>
<s> Without an OSCILLOSCOPE you won't be able to watch the power supply closely to sniff out why more than one bothers it, but get your data out and move on. </s>
<s> That's the hardest thing I find today for folk is to get away from cranky gear. </s>
<s> They can't resist tinkering and risking their files on such things. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks for the response. </s>
<s> It seems that the SMPS was faulty. </s>
<s> I concluded this from the fact that the clicking Sata HDD worked perfectly when attached to another SMPS. </s>
<s> Anyways, I'm not relying on the HDD and a backup is in progress. </s>
<s> Apart from this, I had attached another PATA HDD to the faulty SMPS to check and after being detected, it stopped spinning after 5 seconds and has now completely stopped functioning even with another SMPS. </s>
<s> The &quot;Smooth&quot; chip is getting overheated in this HDD and the motor seems lifeless. </s>
<s> I guess i blew the smooth chip and am now stuck with a bricked HDD </s>
