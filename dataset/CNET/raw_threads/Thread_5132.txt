P.S. I believe 'those cylindrical things just south of the cpu mount' is the heatsink for the northbridge on the motherboard.

I don't see anyway of telling simply by looking at the images though. I would say go for it, but, if you're really not sure, it's not too hard to pick out a different motherboard.
