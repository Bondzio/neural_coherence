1.1.1	i only have a pci slot and i was wondering if this card was better then the Nvidia fx5500 or Ati9250, because i read the required spec on games and some of them say atleast 256mb graphics card.	St
1.1.2	Its overclocked and just pci.	St
1.1.3	http://www.bfgtech.com/6200_256_PCI.html	St
1.2.1	Looks to be the best card for plain PCI	St
