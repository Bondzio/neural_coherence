The pausing during spooling/printing some documents is common and normal.
You might try changing the setting to wait for the last page to be spooled before printing.
It won't speed up the whole process but might stop the pauses.
As for the displayed size of the print job, I don't think you can equate that to size the file shows on on disk especially when compressed graphics might be involved.
I wouldn't worry about either as an issue but you could, as an experiment, change the mentioned setting.
Go to Customize your Printer/Advanced and tic the button to wait for the entire document to be spooled before starting the print.
