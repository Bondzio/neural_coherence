somehow i inherited a &quot;dust cougar&quot;, and since then the &quot;dust doberman&quot; has failed to function?
in reality, i never clean the inside of my computers and have never experienced any problems whatsoever that relate to dust.
my prior unit was an early edition gateway that i used for 5 years without any problems.
currently i have a dell dimension that is about 4-5 years old and has never been opened up.
a lot of folks do more damage than good when they attempt to clean the innards in an improper way.
