<s> Hello everyone. </s>
<s> I don't know much about internet/wireless setups, so I would really appreciate any help with my issue. </s>
<s> I recently moved to Japan where my internet provider (Yahoo BB ADSL through Softbank) makes me pay around $15(USD) extra a month for the privilege of having a wireless connection. </s>
<s> The router they set my connection up with is not wireless, so they basically have me rent a wireless card (I'm not sure if that is the term) which connects into the router from them. </s>
<s> I don't know what the card is called or if I can purchase one myself so I can save the $15 extra a month. </s>
<s> Is there something else (maybe a USB thing) I can connect to the router to have a wireless signal? </s>
<s> If I buy my own wireless router could I replace theirs with it and still have my internet work? </s>
<s> Sorry for my ignorance, and thank you for any help. </s>
<s> not just for internet access. </s>
<s> The $15 is not for the card alone but for card and wi-fi service. </s>
<s> Are you able to access the internet through hardwire connection for no extra charge? </s>
<s> Replacing their ADSL Modem router seems to be too hard on owners. </s>
<s> But I have used ROUTERS AS A WAP when I needed to add wifi. </s>
<s> Google this -&gt; How to use a router as a WAP? </s>

<s> If I don't pay the $15 extra I have to connect to the modem with via an ethernet cable to get internet. </s>
<s> Isn't wifi service just being able to use the internet wirelessly? </s>
<s> SO I would need to connect a wireless router to my existing router? </s>
<s> Should have answered that. </s>
<s> It's a common setup. </s>
<s> If that's not what you wanted to do, just add more details about what your goal was. </s>

<s> thanks for your help </s>
