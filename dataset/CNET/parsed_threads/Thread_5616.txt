<s> Hi webman.Have you given thought to the core i7 cpu? </s>
<s> The core i7 920 cpu, can be had for under $3oo. </s>
<s> The mobo will cost more though. </s>
<s> The benefits outweigh the extra cost by the way of future proofing (at least a little longer) your pc. </s>
<s> Clock speed isn`t everything. </s>
<s> With the i7 there are less chances of bandwith bottlenecks; shorter memory path which does not need to go through the northbridge first. </s>
<s> Overclocking is easier as well. </s>
<s> 4ghz is achieved regularly. </s>
<s> Anyways, just a thought. </s>
<s> I would up the psu. </s>
<s> to at least 700w. </s>
<s> The 450w will run everything but it will run at the limit. </s>
<s> you need some headroom so the psu is never stressed and possibly fry your pc. </s>
<s> Do not scimp on power. </s>
<s> I run 900w on mine. </s>
<s> Have fun building! </s>
<s> ok, so i'd have to get a different mobo to run the other processor? </s>
<s> and i was planning on running xp. </s>
<s> and how hard is it to over clock? </s>
<s> i know what it is, but i've never done it. </s>
