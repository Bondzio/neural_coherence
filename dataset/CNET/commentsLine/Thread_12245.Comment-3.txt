that sounds like what i was expecting to hear.
i spent a lot of time on the phone yesterday with linksys tech support describing what i wanted to do.
he kept insisting that if i connect one port to the house wiring the router would support any computer that was tied in to the house and dhcp would accomodate each computer with unique addresses.
i havne't actually tested it yet but it does sound suspect.
