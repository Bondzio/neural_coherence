Here's a hypothetical question, if I received a new laptop for Christmas which came configured with a wireless &quot;N&quot; card could I use the new computer with my current Linksys &quot;g&quot; router, ( Model WRT54G ) or would I need to upgrade my router to a wireless &quot;N&quot; model?
Is wireless &quot;N&quot; faster than my current wireless &quot;g&quot;?
