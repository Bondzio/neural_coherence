<s> I was given this PC, but when I start it up it looks as if everything is well until it stops at a Black screened menu with white words. </s>
<s> The 'System Configuration' Menu. </s>
<s> It comes to the point where it says &quot;Building DMI Pool......Success&quot; and nothing happens after that it just stays in that menu. </s>
<s> Can anyone help me get past this menu and actually load up the OS? </s>
<s> Wich by the way is Windows XP Pro. </s>
<s> Usually a sign of some trouble on the IDE channels. </s>
<s> Bad drive or bad CD/DVD drive. </s>
<s> Try to boot from CD or other device with the hard disk unplugged. </s>

<s> Is a OS Re-Install.. .. </s>
<s> But really just unplug all the USB 2.0 Hardware.. </s>
<s> UnLoad all the Software and Drivers.. .. Use the DEVICE MANAGER/ Un-Install the Drivers that don't show in ADD/REMOVE Programs.. .. </s>
<s> Pull all the PCI-cards..and the MODEM.. .. </s>
<s> I sometimes just re-install the DRIVERS..and leave it at that.. .. You also don't want DUPLICATE Project Software..like ROXIO and NERO on the same machine.. .. </s>
<s> Sometimes a Salesman might sell you something your machine won't SUPPORT/its advisible to know your Original Configuration.. .. Celeron D is not real good w/DVD-burning..but adeguate w/Audio on CD.. .. NTFS File Systems are best over the FAT32..for System Drives.. and are a must for Video Creation(7200-rpm).. .. </s>
<s> The START-MENU/ Click the PROPERTIES/ I only use 3-ICONS in the Start Menu.. and I Un-Check the BOX-recently OPENED Documents.. ........and CLEAR the LIST........regularily.. .. Defragmentor Program/ gives a good IMAGE of the HDD's that your Useing.. .. That GREEN Stip is your Page File.. </s>
<s> I only use a Page File in the (C:)Drive and never exceed 800-MB's.. My HD will show a GREEN Strip at the Left side of the Visual for Disk Defragmentor/and if I corrupt my OS..this will split into two-strips..two Green Strips means its time to re-Install the OS.. .. That's the simple side. </s>
