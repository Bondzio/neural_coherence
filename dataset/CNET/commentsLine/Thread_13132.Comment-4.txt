by all means replace the caps, its a good idea if only to say you did it.
of course, because you lost power makes even more problematic as anything can be at fault.
since, you seemed to have stumbled on yet more bad monitors, i'll guess that's a power problem in your area.
so, i strongly suggest you look into a very good surge protector, ac line conditioner and even an ups if you care to.
in other words, protect your devices at best as you can afford.
even, the bad caps can be replaced with better models like ceramic or metallic(military grade) which are more durable or robust compared to the std.
cap, that looks like a small soda can(rolled foil).
