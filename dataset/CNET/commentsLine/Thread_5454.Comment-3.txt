a router uses 3 layers of the osi model up to and including the network layer.
this layer is where packets are router to different subnets using ip's.
wap's and/or ap's use up to and including layer 2--the data link layer.
to answer your question, an ap deals with mac addresses and it keeps them in a re-writable rom chip (eeprom).
each layer adds encapsulation going up the stack.
