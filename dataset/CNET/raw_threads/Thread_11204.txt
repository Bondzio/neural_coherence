What are the two cards already there, sound and video? Will Windows configure even if we're at home and not on the college LAN yet? New at this, but I have added RAM before. Compaq Presario 2.8G about 3 months old.

BUT WINDOWS may not support this card. Have the drivers handy. And NO! It will not configure the card for use away from home. Just asking. How is the Home connection? Ethernet? If so, don't add this card. Bob

We have dial up at home, no network. Are you saying Windows doesn't have drivers to support card and that we will have to find driver at a website? College recommends SMC or 3COM cards and sells them and cable at the bookstore. I was hoping to get the job done at home before the move.

You also may not be able to test the card, but absolutely can install it, the drivers and then disable it to sidestep the freeze and thaw that may happen. Bob
