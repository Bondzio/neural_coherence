<s> My Netgear WGT624v4 wireless routers are having an IP conflict! </s>
<s> One is the base-station and the other the repeater. </s>
<s> How do I stop this madness?! </s>
<s> Believe it or not, Netgear forums are of no help. </s>
<s> I've been told to make sure the IP of the repeater is outside the range of the base-station. </s>
<s> I thought I did that. </s>
<s> I assume from the error messages, I haven't done it right. </s>
<s> Of course, I can't even check because I can't log into the repeater, only the base-station. </s>
<s> Can't remember how to log into the repeater. </s>
<s> Help! </s>
<s> I defer to the maker for support. </s>
<s> Sorry but I must. </s>
<s> Your complaint is well known and I lay the issue at the maker's door. </s>
<s> OK, but how do I extend a router's coverage? </s>
<s> I use this phrase on google if you don't know about it -&gt; How to use a router as a WAP? </s>
<s> I never have this issue with the usual WAP setup. </s>
<s> -&gt; As to your login to the repeater, I find myself resetting the repeater to it's factory setting then doing it all over. </s>

<s> - Disconnect the router (repeater) from the 1st router and power cycle. </s>
<s> - Connect a computer to a LAN port on the router (repeater) in order to configure it. </s>
<s> If you can't log in, you may need to reset to factory defaults. </s>
<s> - Under &quot;Advanced&quot; and &quot;LAN Setup&quot;, uncheck &quot;Use Router as DHCP Server&quot;. </s>
<s> Then select &quot;Apply&quot; and reset router. </s>
<s> - Connect the LAN port from the first router to a LAN port on the second router (don't use the WAN or Internet port). </s>
<s> Power cycle both devices. </s>
<s> - You should be able to reconnect all devices with no IP conflict, since all devices will get an IP address via DHCP from the first router. </s>
