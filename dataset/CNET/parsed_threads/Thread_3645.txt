<s> OK I have a question, as we all do. </s>
<s> I had windows xp on my old computer and something in it died. </s>
<s> The geek squad said it was a green chip in the mother board. </s>
<s> I am not savvy on the lingo as you can tell. </s>
<s> So I bought a new hp with vista. </s>
<s> It seems to work pretty good for me. </s>
<s> My question is what to do with the drive in my old computer. </s>
<s> I heard you should not just throw it away because it contains alot of stuff. </s>
<s> Can I hook it up to my new one or have my it guy at work load it on a disk or beat it with a hammer? </s>
<s> Hope To get an answer. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> You could remove the hard disk and put that in a case like these http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=USB+DRIVE+CASE The rest could be tossed out on freecycle.com Bob </s>
<s> I guess I could open up the old computer and see what your talking about. </s>
<s> This thing can be used as a usb drive </s>
