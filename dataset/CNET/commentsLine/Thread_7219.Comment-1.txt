being reluctant to spend money and of the old fasion opinon that pc's should be as long lasting as appliences from the 70's (yeah i know) i am still using a ati/rage fury pro xpert 2000 pro card.
does this card support ''transform and lighting''?
probably not and if it doesn't can any recomend an inexpensive card that does.
i have a gigabyte socket a mother board ga-7vaxp with an amd athalon xp 1800 chip.
also can any one help me with navagating ati's site.
can i e-mail them this question?
where on the site?
customer support only seems to have a telephone option.
thanks, everyone david
