1.1.1	A few days ago I posted about the malfunction of both my cdr and dvd drives .	St
1.1.2	It turned out to be a problem in the registry caused by Adaptec Easy Cd Creator .	St
1.1.3	I found the solution ( thanks again Bob ) and then both drives worked fine- until I installed the update to the Adaptec program so it would recognize my cdr again .	St
1.1.4	Okay , so now the cdr works , but the DVD does n't .	St
1.1.5	I 'm not even getting an error code- the DVD drive does n't show at all in Hardware Manager .	St
1.1.6	I tried the Hardware Install Wizard- nothing .	St
1.1.7	I tried the same regedit that worked before- nothing .	St
1.1.8	I just watched a movie on the thing , I 'm pretty sure its not broken .	St
1.1.9	It is a one year old Sony .	St
1.1.10	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.2.1	That 's a possible clue .	St
1.2.2	I have n't put ANY Adaptec software in machines for about 5 years .	St
1.2.3	Tell more and if the DVD shows up in the BIOS .	St
1.2.4	Bob	St
1.3.1	Musta been Gremlins .	St
1.3.2	I did nothing to the pc except turn it off for the night ... I just turned it on for the first time and the DVD player is working despite being identified as a cd drive in My Computer .	St
1.3.3	THe misbehavior of the dvd drive persisted through many reboots , maybe it just needed a goodnights rest .	St
1.3.4	I wish everything would fix itself .	St
1.3.5	Bob- you mentioned that Adaptect software may be a problem .	St
1.3.6	I know you ca n't advertise here , but is there a program you would recommend ?	Ques
1.4.1	There are a few noteable free CD recording freebies out there .	St
1.4.2	Today I use http : //www.cdburnerxp.se and it 's very usable without being locked to the CDRW make/model .	St
1.4.3	Nero is nice too .	St
1.4.4	On Linux , it 's K3b .	St
1.4.5	Bob	St
