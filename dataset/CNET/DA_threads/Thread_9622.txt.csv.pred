1.1.1	I have two external hard drives that I want to wipe clean (not reformat; wipe clean).	St
1.1.2	Are the disks still usable after being wiped?	St
1.1.3	Is it possible to reformat the hard drives for further use, and if so how?	St
1.1.4	Thanks.	St
1.2.1	Methods vary depending on your intended purpose.	St
1.2.2	When I do this, I usually look for the manufacturer's destructive utility that performs a complete diagnostic test of the drive to disclose any problems such as bad sectors.	St
1.2.3	Once this is completed and if no deficiencies are noted, you use it as if it was a new drive.	St
1.2.4	You partition and format the external drive using the computer you attach it to.	St
1.3.1	and format the drives as desired with the your system OS....specifically 'disk management'.	St
1.3.2	VAPCMD	St
