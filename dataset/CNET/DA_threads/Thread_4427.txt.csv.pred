1.4.1	& quot ; Or my peripherals ? & quot ; & quot ; Tip : If you are asking for help to troubleshoot a computer-related problem , please be sure to include all the necessary information ( ie : operating system , model number , hardware , software , etc ) that will help others identify your problem for a speedy resolution. & quot ; This tip is put up with every post .	St
1.4.2	While it may or may not help , I wish you the best in finding the cause and a cure , but let 's just state that old machines can go unstable even with the best of care .	St
1.4.3	A prime example is this GOOGLE - & gt ; http : //www.google.com/search ? & q=BAD+MOTHERBOARD+CAPACITORS Also worth noting are the PESTS that we find on too many machines .	St
1.4.4	I wrote up a short list about this at http : //reviews.cnet.com/5208-6132-0.html ? forumID=32 & threadID=1313 & start=0 Not many shops will alert people to this issue because it would run up a bill and inflict too much time educating the users .	St

1.4.6	Now that we 've got a good idea it 's not heat related , we move to & quot ; other items. & quot ; Bob	St
