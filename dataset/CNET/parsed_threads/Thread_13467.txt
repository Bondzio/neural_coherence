<s> I recently replaced my old 80 gb HD with a 300 gb HD and have put my old 80 in an external enclosure with all data still intact. </s>
<s> WHAT is the best way to use this for backing up added data from my current (C:) boot drive (which has all old data transferred to it at installation).. Should I get a program such as Memeo ?, or can I do this manually at intervals of my choosing ? </s>
<s> I decline to tell the web address of it or write a tutorial but it's what I use. </s>
<s> HOWEVER THIS IS NOT A BACKUP but a fine fast copy. </s>
<s> It and any other hard disk system fails some basic backup criteria. </s>
