this is somewhat of a silly question, because the results of this poll don't prove anything given that the &quot;computer&quot; isn't defined as to its kind or usage.
for a desktop pc being used to play video games, view and edit digital video, etc, most people would want the most powerful graphics card they could afford.
for a desktop pc being used to run business applications, a low-end graphics card--or even an integrated graphics chipset--would suffice.
and of course for a laptop, integrated chipset graphics are the way to go.
high-end graphics cards use a lot of power and generate a lot of heat, which would result in poor battery life, loud fan noise, and possible discomfort to the user.
most people want a laptop primarily to run business applications, and would prefer long battery life and lower heat dissipation.
that is why the best quality laptops usually have very basic graphics capabilities.
