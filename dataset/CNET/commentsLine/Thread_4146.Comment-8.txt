the screw holes on all cases and drives are in the exact same place, if yours don't line up you may have the drive backwards or incorrectly placed, drives just don't vary at all in where they have the holes.
free space doesn't mean total space, how much space does it show total (capacity) when you right click on the drive and select properties.
whatever number you see, multiply it by 1024x1024x1024 to get the actual size in bytes.
in the case of a 111gb drive that comes out to 119.1 billion bytes, quite close to 120gb.
