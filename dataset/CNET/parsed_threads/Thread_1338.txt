<s> I am having a problem with my hard drive and am afraid it will fail. </s>
<s> I have a second hard drive in my system that was set up to shadow the C drive. </s>
<s> I disabled that second drive after I received the computer, so this drive is essentially new. </s>
<s> Do I have to do anything to the second drive, since it does have a couple of files on it to be able to use it as a primary drive? </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> I am running Windows XP Home Edition. </s>
<s> USe a program like norton ghost to duplicate your current drive. </s>
<s> So using this program will reformat the second drive and make it bootable? </s>
<s> I will be retiring the C drive as soon as I get D up and running. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>

<s> You download it from the drive's maker. </s>

<s> The other drive in my system is the same age and brand as the one with the problem. </s>
<s> It just hasn't been used, because I disabled the shadowing. </s>
<s> (Kinda wish now that I hadn't.) </s>
<s> So there is no copy program that I am aware of. </s>
<s> I'll dig out the disk and take a look. </s>
<s> I use another called G4U but some find it too hard to use (no GUI.) </s>
<s> If you had shared the make of the drives I might have found that maker's free copy software. </s>
<s> But you can look too. </s>

<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> I appreciate the time taken to answer my questions. </s>
<s> I'll drop a note when I get the job done. </s>
