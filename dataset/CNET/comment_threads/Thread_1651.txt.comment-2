I'm not a gamer and I don't even usually watch videos on my multimedia PC, so video performance is good to have but hardly essential for me.
It's a lot more important on my notebook, on which I do occasionally watch DVDs when traveling.
But, even then, it's a lot less important than CPU speed, RAM, and HDD capacity.
