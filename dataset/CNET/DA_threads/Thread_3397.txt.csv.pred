1.1.1	Building my first gaming system , on a loose budget but trying to save money , hence custom-building myself rather than buying a pre-built PC .	St
1.1.2	Have n't purchased any of the components yet but here 's what I 'm interested in putting together : PROCESSOR : Intel i7 LGA 1366 MOTHERBOARD : Asus Sabertooth X58 1366 RAM : Corsair DDR3 6GB 1600MHz Tri-kit HARD DRIVE : Hitachi 1TB Serial ATA/300 7200RPM , 32MB Buffer VIDEO CARD : Diamond ATI HD 5670 1GB PCI-Express SOUND CARD : Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi XtremeGamer Sound Card POWER SUPPLY : Apevia Iceberg 680W Green ATX Power Supply And I have n't chosen a case just yet , thinking mid-tower , so I do n't exactly have a min- or max- amount of fan installation space as of yet .	St
1.1.3	Any advice at all would be GREATLY appreciated !	Polite
1.2.1	One might do the job and if the internals do n't dissipate heat well then you can compensate with more fans .	Sug
1.2.2	The answer is 1 or more .	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	I do n't think so .	Res
1.3.2	Here 's some info re GPUs that might be of interest .	St
1.3.3	http : //www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-radeon-hd-6870-radeon-hd-6850,2782-7.html About the Apevia PSU ... . believe you can do better in both quality and performance .	St
1.3.4	See reviews at the tech sites and buyer reviews at Newegg.com .	St
1.3.5	Re how many cooling fans ... depends on how much heat your components generate , the system design and how much you 're willing to spend .	St
1.3.6	VAPCMD	St
1.4.1	Get yourself a tower with a bunch of fans .	Sug
1.4.2	A good sort of budget box is an Antec 900 , lots of fans incorporated and plenty of room to work in the box .	St
1.4.3	Just a suggestion , I have built 2 systems using the 900 and the results have been great .	St
1.5.1	Thanks for everyone 's advice !	Polite
1.5.2	Will do a bit more research on most of the components as far as reviews go , etc .	St
1.5.3	But will most definitely do some more looking around as far as the PSU goes .	St
1.5.4	And read a lot of reviews for different cases on Newegg ... I found I really liked the Rosewill Challenger .	St
1.5.5	Least amount of complaints .	St
1.5.6	But I 'll look once more into the Antec .	St
1.5.7	Again , thanks !	Polite
1.6.1	http : //www.jonnyguru.com/modules.php ? name=NDFAQs The link above above is for PSU FAQs .	St
1.6.2	There 's also plenty of reviews on individual PSUs .	St
1.6.3	Let us know what you decide on .	St
1.6.4	VAPCMD	St
1.7.1	Keep in mind , it 's not just how many fans you have , but how they are placed .	St
1.7.2	I 've answered this a few times before , so I 'll be brief ( search fans or heat ) .	St
1.7.3	Keep the flow going in one direction .	St
1.7.4	Your chip is the most important , have the biggest fan you can .	St
1.7.5	Flow : I have all my fans flow ( with filters ) from the front , to the rear , with side fans blowing onto the chip radiator .	St
1.7.6	I do n't have it blowing harder than the chip fan ( that is on the radiator ) .	St
1.7.7	This gives & quot ; cooler & quot ; outside air .	St
1.7.8	For your case , I would strongly suggest a large tower .	St
1.7.9	I see they are scarce , except the pricey ones .	St
1.7.10	Air volume equals cooling too .	St
1.7.11	I have a 5.25 & quot ; gap between by cd/dvd burners because they generate a large amount of heat .	St
1.7.12	But nothing close to the heat my larger HDDs do !	St
1.7.13	Here I have a ( hard drive ) fan vertically mounted & blowing against them .	St
1.7.14	That air bounces down .	St
1.7.15	Well some of it does & some of it goes past .	St
1.7.16	What you put in there is more up to what your budget is .	St
1.7.17	Than you work with how to cool it .	St
1.7.18	Adjusting your budget so that you have a good balance .	St
1.7.19	I 've put fans on the bottom of a case , to draw unheated air from there .	St
1.7.20	I 've also synced it with the chip 's thermometer to aid in it 's cooling .	St
1.7.21	Good luck on your build .	Polite
1.7.22	Always research your pieces before you want to buy them .	St
1.7.23	Now is a good time , as smart retailers are looking to pick up any sales that they can .	St
1.7.24	You may even get a better piece or add other piece with the budget you have , & that 's always cool .	St
1.8.1	All the info is much much appreciated .	St
1.8.2	For the PSU , I ended up getting the Corsair CMPSU-750TX 750-Watt TX Series .	St
1.8.3	It got the best reviews and ratings out of any that I saw in that wattage range on Newegg , and it 'll provide more than enough power than I know I 'll need .	St
1.8.4	And I also got a cooler master fan for my processor , one that I do n't have the name of right off of the top of my head and am too lazy to get out of my nice comfy bed to look at the box , but it was highly recommended by PCMAG to replace the stock cooler that came with my i7 950 .	St
1.8.5	I will buy more fans , but I wanted to finish most of the build first , to see how many more I can fit , given that I chose a mid-tower .	St
1.8.6	I will only be installing one 1TB HDD for now so there should be extra space for a fan there , and we 'll see what happens ...	St
1.8.7	I should be starting on the build by Tuesday at the latest , the case and power cord as well as my HDD connectors are coming in the mail from Newegg .	St
1.8.8	Will keep updated , especially with any more questions I might have .	St
1.9.1	with CPU , PSU , 1 stick of RAM , etc. , OUTSIDE the case .	St
1.9.2	Testing outside helps to ensure the basic components will start and run before mounting them all in the the case only to find the MB or CPU are DOA .	St
1.9.3	If you have n't ordered a case ... check out the Antec & quot ; DF30/DF35 & quot ; Series over at Newegg .	St
1.9.4	They look pretty good from here .	St
1.9.5	Keep us posted .	St
1.9.6	VAPCMD Did you get the CoolerMaster Hyper 212+ ?	Ques
1.10.1	Yes !	St
1.10.2	The hyper 212+ , that 's the one .	St
1.10.3	And I already ordered the Rosewill Challenger case on Newegg .	St
1.10.4	Got great reviews , comes with 3 fans ( not sure whether the stock will be good enough but it 's a good start until I finish my build and decide to buy more or at least better ones to replace the stock . )	St
1.10.5	And I 'll be sure to do the bench test .	St
1.11.1	Also some good online stores for case fans , fan accessories , fan filters , etc. , at some of the smaller specialty vendors .	St
1.11.2	There 's a bunch I 've dealt with over the years which include FrozenCPU.com , CoolerGuys.com , XPCGear.com , Heatsinkfactory.com , etc. , Good Luck .	St
1.11.3	VAPCMD	St
1.12.1	Hehe .	St
1.12.2	Finished the build .	St
1.12.3	Took me 8 hours .	St
1.12.4	I could have finished much quicker had it not been my first build , but I had a few unnecessary time issues ...	St
1.12.5	The manual that was included with the chassis instructed me to install the PSU , and then the motherboard ( after processor install ) , before installing any other hardware , etc .	St
1.12.6	I did this , then realized I had to take the mobo BACK out so i could install the back plate for the aftermarket cooler .	St
1.12.7	what a hassle .	St
1.12.8	The time mostly consisted of untangling and plugging in wires , etc .	St
1.12.9	Then I took about an hour after everything was plugged in properly to troubleshoot when the mobo would n't post .	St
1.12.10	Everything was running when I started the machine , but red LED lights for DRAM and CPU kept lighting up , signaling that something was wrong .	St
1.12.11	I reinstalled the CPU and heatsink , as well as the RAM sticks , graphics and sound cards all at least twice , which took forever , then finally realized that the mobo had two separate PSU connectors .	St
1.12.12	And I had only plugged in one .	St
1.12.13	Which powered the mobo and made all of the fans , drives , etc .	St
1.12.14	run , but once I plugged in the second connector , the red LEDs clicked off on POST , I plugged the monitor in , and everything worked seamlessly .	St
1.12.15	And the fans that came with the chassis work amazingly , much to my surprise .	St
1.12.16	Runs super cool .	Polite
1.12.17	I have n't taken pictures to post , as I have n't finished cleaning up and tucking in cables and such .	St
1.12.18	Thank you , everyone , for ALL of your much needed help and advice !	St
1.13.1	Just remember you always want to test the MB , CPU , RAM , etc .	St
1.13.2	outside the case to make sure it 's working before installing it in the case .	St
1.13.3	Depending on how complex the component installation and mounting is , that could save a lot of time later if it does n't work once installed .	St
1.13.4	It 's pretty easy when it all works and nothing but anguish when it does n't .	St
1.13.5	VAPCMD	St
1.14.1	The first time usually does take the longest , & certainly the one you 'll remember .	St
1.14.2	Looks like you paced yourself well & really did n't rush it .	St
1.14.3	That 's always good .	St
1.14.4	Give it some burn in time ( leave it on ) .	St
1.14.5	You 'll also find various programs to help & quot ; use & quot ; the pieces , but you can do this by just using it .	St
1.14.6	Keep your eye on the temps t make sure they are stable .	St
1.14.7	This is especially true if you 're going to do any over clocking or tweaking .	St
1.14.8	You want it stable first , so you know what & quot ; normal & quot ; temps are .	St
1.14.9	After a week , turn everything off to make sure all the connections are secure .	St
1.14.10	Especially if you 're opening the case , or moving or installing things .	St
1.15.1	Be sure to protect the back of the board when doing this , as you may make a circuit on the connections against the case ( if you lay it on top of the case ) .	St
1.15.2	It also protects the board from damaging those bits of solder .	St
1.15.3	It may take longer to partially install the board , but you do n't have to balance the board , & you can see which wires still need to be plugged in .	St
1.16.1	thanks for the feedback .	Polite
1.16.2	i 'll be shipping it soon so i definitely want to make sure everything is secure .	St
1.16.3	and i 'm not positive yet on whether i plan to overclock but it 's a gift so i might leave that decision up to my boyfriend , who i 'm giving it to .	St
1.16.4	but i 'll leave it running for a day or two , turn it off and make sure all connections are okay ... i already tied down all the cables securely so they wo n't move around so much during the move but i definitely plan to open up the case to recheck everything once he opens it up on christmas , as i 'll be flying to where to he is to celebrate with the family and whatnot .	St
1.17.1	you might want to put some extra material inside the case to prevent it from shifting during transit .	St
1.17.2	I 've read where folks would simply set the case/system down too hard dislodging the HS Fan causing the system to start but then shut down very quickly after wards .	St
1.17.3	You 'll want to remove that packaging/shipping material before starting/using the system .	St
1.17.4	Let us know how that works out .	St
1.17.5	Merry Christmas VAPCMD	St
