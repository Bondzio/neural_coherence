<s> A friend has a laptop and wants me to add an external HDD (via USB) to it. </s>
<s> It's a relatively old system (166 mgz) running Win98. </s>
<s> 48 megs of Ram My question is what would be the limit of hard drive this system could detect. </s>
<s> He's looking at buying a 6 Gig drive. </s>
<s> Is there a general rule of thumb to determine this systems' HD limit or would I need to provide more info? </s>
<s> Thank you </s>
<s> 133Gb would probably be the BIOS limit, but that can normally be overcome. </s>
<s> The laptop probably supports USB 1.0 so speed might be an issue with an external drive and possibly power via the USB. </s>
<s> 6Gb is quite small these days and will not be an issue, more likely whether the enclosure for it supports an external power source. </s>
<s> However it may not be an issue. </s>
<s> Hard drives and enclosures are quite cheap in the 20Gb range. </s>
<s> Look on E-Bay for a 9mm / 2.5&quot; IDE drive and also for an enclosure. </s>
<s> Both can be had under $50.00. </s>
<s> You can get close to 6Gb on a USB flash stick these days (4GB). </s>
<s> You'll know because the BIOS will &quot;hang&quot; when you put something over that on it. </s>

<s> Thanks gentlemen. </s>
<s> Much appreciated. </s>
<s> Z </s>
<s> Unless he has 98 second edition with a patch flash would be a bad investment. </s>
