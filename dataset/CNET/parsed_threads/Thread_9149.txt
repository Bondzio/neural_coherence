<s> I have a Sony Vaio Media Center Desktop PC running Windows XP sp2 and would like to find out if it's possible to use a bluetooth adaptor and headset to commuicate over Skype and other IM programs. </s>
<s> thanks, </s>
<s> doesn't the head set come with an adapter, if it does, then it will work, if it doesn't, then look in the manual, see if they recommend any bluetooth adapters, then buy the recommended adapter, if they don't say anything about an adapter to connect to your pc, like no recommendations at all, then just choose another headset try downloading the manual off the headset's website </s>
<s> Thanks ferraritt for responding! </s>
<s> I ordered an Iogear (model GBE201W7)headset which they state will work with internet calling programs like Skype, Yahoo Messenger & MSN. </s>
<s> I already had the bluetooth adaptor from Kennsington a v2.0. </s>
<s> My fingers are crossed and I will be downloading those manuals! </s>
