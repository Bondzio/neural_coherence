1.6.1	I re-read my replies to be sure what I was writing .	St
1.6.2	No offense but I use English in my replies .	St
1.6.3	I also try to let you do a little work since it 's your issues to be solved .	St
1.6.4	Such as I 'll let you find the Linksys wifi print server and read up on how it connects .	St
1.6.5	Bob	St
1.7.1	Many of the Wi-Fi router companys make a print server which is Wi-Fi enabled .	St
1.7.2	You plug the printer to the print server and in turn the printer server will communicate to the router wirelessly .	St
1.7.3	Each computer that will use the print server will need the device driver installed and you or somebody of your choosing can install the device drivers ( the instructions that each component needs in order for each to talk to each other ) .	St
1.7.4	Those device drivers are supplied in the box with the print server that you purchased .	St
1.7.5	As the previous poster said , follow the manufacturers instructions and do n't skip or & quot ; think & quot ; you know more than they .	St
1.7.6	Good luck .	Polite
