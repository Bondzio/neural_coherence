first, my system specs: 3 ghz pentium 4 w/HT, 2 gigs RAM, 160 gig hard drive, 256 meg Nvidia geforce 6600 video card.
Now, what happens in these 2 games, Half-Life 2 and Battlefield 2, regardless of video settings in the game, there are textures that are either missing, black, or flickering.
Lets say there is a couch.
A cushion on the couch will be missing, or black or flickering, BUT, this only happens after the server changes maps, or if I cnrtl+alt+delete.
This happens also in the same fashion with Battlefield 2, regardless of in-game video settings.
I tried both video games' support sections, and all they give me is generalized, automated solutions (run virus scan, defrag hard rive blahblahblah all useless and didnt help), so I figure I would come here for help.
Oh, and when I look at the setting through the desktop (right click, properties, video card tab), i look at the monitor settings, and the video card has detected my LCD monitor as a CRT monitor.
WTF is that all about??
Anyway, any help would be great.
