<s> http://www.bitssite.com/serial-ata-ide-100-133-convertor-adapter/6063/hard-driver-converter/accessory.html I recently bought this IDE to SATA Converter to use on a Maxtor Diamondmax 10 300GB HDD. </s>
<s> I connected it correctly, and also attached all the necessary cables. </s>
<s> However, the HDD won't show up in my BIOS. </s>
<s> Here is my setup: AMD Phenom X4 9650 ASUS M4N72-E Corsair XMS2 4GB (4 x 1GB) Western Digital 300GB HDD SATA Nvidia XFX GeForce 9800 Why isn't it working? </s>
<s> Can anyone help, please? </s>

<s> If you are, the adapter spec. </s>
<s> doesn't say anything about that. </s>
<s> Some adapter can do that but don't know about this one. </s>
<s> Harddrive are cheap..get another ide. </s>
<s> Use the sata for data storage. </s>
<s> Good luck. </s>
<s> The HDD works. </s>
<s> I tried it on the IDE and it comes up, like it should. </s>
<s> However, I also have two disc drives: one dvd and the other dvd-rw. </s>
<s> Both use up the only IDE port I have. </s>
<s> My SATA drive is my boot drive. </s>
<s> Might have been better or easier to get an SATA optical drive or a PCI IDE-SATA controller. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
<s> I tried putting the adapter on one of my optical drives and that didn't work either. </s>
<s> I use both disc drives so I need them both active. </s>
<s> optical, get another controller (see link below) or get an external USB case and mount the IDE drive in that. </s>
