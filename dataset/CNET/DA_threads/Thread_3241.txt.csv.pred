1.1.1	Kids shot the screen wit a BB gun ( : - ( and damaged it .	St
1.1.2	Where can I procure the screen component for replacement .	St
1.1.3	I am an electronic tech of 30 years but I do not know of a source for this .	St
1.1.4	Any ideas ?	Ques
1.1.5	Thank you , Mike Crosby	St
1.2.1	Somewhere in that huge company they must have spares and a distribution mechanism for them .	St
1.2.2	But it seems very well possible to me that the price of a spare screen for a unit that was sold from 2004 is much more than the current price of a comparable unit .	St
1.2.3	Better check before you order .	St
1.2.4	Kees	St
1.3.1	You may be right , but it is worth a shot .	St
1.3.2	Thanks , Mike	St
1.4.1	Depending on how old the LCD is , finding spares is out there in the & quot ; used/spares & quot ; vendors market .	St
1.4.2	Google for model # and see if so-so has anything and of course the full cost .	St
1.4.3	If the LCD is real old and/or at least 3yrs .	St
1.4.4	old , I would consider it a lost unless you really got to have it .	St
1.4.5	In most cases a LCD subassy .	St
1.4.6	( alone ) or if used , maybe the whole assy .	St
1.4.7	the cost varies .	St
1.4.8	Buying a new 19in .	St
1.4.9	LCD , especially now during this Xmas time , there has to be a decent deal out there , well worth the checking out .	St
1.4.10	Of course , there is eBay too just find a F1903 out there .	St
1.4.11	BTW , the HP F1503 and F1903 were part of a bad series of LCDs that had poor componets used and caused failure .	St
1.4.12	So , the parts got used/repaired often and/or these bad LCDs were sold , so verify it is a working model component/LCD .	St
1.4.13	tada -- -- -Willy	St
