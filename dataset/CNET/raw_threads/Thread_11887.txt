If you don't see the button tab it may be because of the Microsoft update KB908531 that messed up the HP internet keyboards. I had that problem and had to remove that update to use and program the buttons.

Scroll down until you find KB908531 then just remove it like removing any other program. If you have your computer set for auto updates from Microsoft you will have to go there and hide that update so it won't reload itself or just turn off auto updates which is what I did. As far as it being safe to remove, it tells you of all the programs it could effect when you remove it, but when I removed it it didn't effect anything except I was able to program my keyboard buttons.
