I got the same answer from Dell about the A960 printer--only Dell cartridges fit.
I did a search on dell printer cartridges and found a web site &quot;HTTP://www.4inkjet.com/dea9prsu.html&quot; that identified that the printers are made by Lexmark, but they keyed the print cartridges differently for Dell.
Therefore only Dell cartridges will fit OR the 4inkjet.com claims to make a refill kit for that printer.
I plan to check CompUsa, Bestbuy, and Staples local stores.
I complained to the salesperson who could care less about my complaint.
Good luck.
