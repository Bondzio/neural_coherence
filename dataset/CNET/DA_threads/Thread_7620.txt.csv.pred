1.1.1	Effective with the recent Daylight Savings time change ( just coincidence , I 'm sure !	St
1.1.2	) , three of the four computers on a Linksys wireless B ( infrastructure ) network lost access .	St
1.1.3	The RF signal level was great , but the router would not assign IP addresses to three computers .	St
1.1.4	A chat with the 24/7 help guy at Linksys ( probably in Calcutta !	St
1.1.5	) , was to no avail .	St
1.1.6	I tried the usual soft and hard resets , channel changes , etc. , but finally got the system working again by increasing the maxinum number of IP address that the DHCP utility of the router can assign , from 50 to 100 .	St
1.1.7	Now the router assigns x.x.x.101 to the computer that always worked , but x.x.x.151 , x.x.x.152 and x.x.x.153 to the other three .	St
1.1.8	None of the intermediate values show up on the router 's list of assigned IPs , so why the big gap in assignments ?	Ques
1.1.9	The network is not encrypted , but MAC addresses are filtered to keep the casual snoopers out .	St
1.1.10	I am back in business , but really wonder what 's going on here .	St
1.2.1	Maximium number of DHCP users = 100 Starting IP address = ?	Ques
1.2.2	Look in the TCP/IP Properties of the 192.168.1.101 computer ( in the properties of the active network connection ) .	St
1.2.3	Does it ''Obtain IP address automatically '' or is it pre-assigned ( static ) ?	Ques
1.3.1	Hi , Linkit , Thanks for the reply .	St
1.3.2	I just checked , and all computers on the network are set to obtain the IP address automatically .	St
1.3.3	This morning I booted up one of the previously-failed computers first , and it still obtained x.x.x.151 .	St
1.3.4	Afterward , when I booted the 'always okay ' computer to answer your question , sure enough it obtained x.x.x.101 .	St
1.3.5	I 'm not really comfortable trying to use the manual setup under Properties of the network connection , but wonder if it 's possible simply to preassign IP addresses for the four computers on the network , or would this drive the router nuts , trying to use its DHCP for this ?	Ques
1.4.1	You have stated that you increased the count of IP addresses the DHCP server can assign .	St
1.4.2	In the admin page for the router , what is the starting IP address for the DHCP server ?	Ques
1.4.3	xxx.xxx.xxx.150 or xxx.xxx.xxx.101 or other ?	Ques
1.4.4	What is the subnet mask on the 101 computer ?	Ques
1.4.5	255.255.255.0 ?	Ques
1.4.6	Do you get any error message when you enter ''ipconfig /renew '' command ?	Ques
1.4.7	Static IP addresses shoud n't be a problem for the router .	St
1.4.8	The router will use the static IP addresses that it discovers on the computers/network devices before it attempts to assign an IP address via DHCP .	St
1.5.1	Answers embedded with *** : You have stated that you increased the count of IP addresses the DHCP server can assign .	St
1.5.2	In the admin page for the router , what is the starting IP address for the DHCP server ?	Ques
1.5.3	xxx.xxx.xxx.150 or xxx.xxx.xxx.101 or other ?	Ques
1.5.4	***Starting address is 192.168.1.100 .	St
1.5.5	With Number Of Addresses set to 100 , the router gives me a range of 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.199 .	St
1.5.6	*** What is the subnet mask on the 101 computer ?	Ques
1.5.7	255.255.255.0 ?	Ques
1.5.8	***The _router's_ subset mask is indeed 255.255.255.0 .	St
1.5.9	I looked under Properties of the wireless connection on the computers , but ca n't find where any subset mask is called out here .	St
1.5.10	*** Do you get any error message when you enter ''ipconfig /renew '' command ?	Ques
1.5.11	***You 've got me there .	St
1.5.12	Where would I enter this command ?	Ques
1.5.13	Start/Run ?	Ques
1.5.14	If I click on ''Repair '' under Wireless/Properties , the computer turns off the USB adapter , turns it back on and waits for a new IP assignment .	St
1.5.15	I suppose this is the same thing ?	Ques
1.5.16	If so , this computer still gets the x.x.x.151 , and my wife 's computer gets the x.x.x.101 .	St
1.5.17	*** Static IP addresses shoud n't be a problem for the router .	St
1.5.18	The router will use the static IP addresses that it discovers on the computers/network devices before it attempts to assign an IP address via DHCP .	St
1.5.19	***Does this mean that I would simply assign sequential IPs under Properties of my wireless connection ?	Ques
1.5.20	There seem multiple ways to do this , either under the General tab or the Alternate Configuration tab .	St
1.5.21	These also want a subset mask specified and call for things like a Default Gateway and preferred and alternate DNS servers .	St
1.5.22	This is all a bit beyond me .	St
1.5.23	However , if I was able to assign these manually , would I then disable the router 's Local DHCP Server ?	Ques
1.5.24	Would this give me any security advantage over auto-DHCP ?	Ques
1.5.25	*** Many thanks for all your help .	Polite
1.6.1	Let 's take care of the easy stuff first : What is the router model number ?	Ques
1.6.2	Have you downloaded and installed the latest router FIRMWARE from Linksys.com ?	Ques
1.6.3	Linksys Downloads Besides the Linksys router , do you have any other network boxes ( switches , hubs , another router ) on your local network ?	Ques
1.7.1	Hi , Linkit , First , many thanks for your continued help .	Polite
1.7.2	The router is a Linksys BEFW11S4 - Ver .	St
1.7.3	4 .	St
1.7.4	I have downloaded an updated driver , but want to wait until tomorrow to install this .	St
1.7.5	My wife uses the DSL connection in her home office and is working there today .	St
1.7.6	When opening the control panel of the router it 's clear how to browse to the file I placed on my desktop and upload the new firmware .	St
1.7.7	No , there 's no other equipment on the newtork , just the router hard-wired to the DSL modem , three desktops with USB adapters ( 1 Linksys , 2 D-Link ) , and two laptops that have built-in adapters but are used only occasionally .	St
1.7.8	The network is configured as an & quot ; Infrastructure & quot ; one ; that is , the computers talk to the modem and not to each other .	St
1.7.9	Tomorrow I will upload the new router firmware and , hopefully , report success .	St
1.8.1	Question , why would you have to set 100 clients if you only have 5 computers in your network ? .	Ques
1.8.2	I have 6 pc 's in my house and I have 6 licenses assigned and I 've had no problems whatsoever .	St
1.8.3	Also , how are these computers ( desktops ) wired to the router ?	Ques
1.8.4	are they in the same room ?	Ques
1.8.5	If so , I would n't use the usb adapters , you 're just asking for more things to diagnose in case you have problems .	St
1.8.6	If the pc 's are all together , then simply plug them into the router directly , you 'll save yourself a headache and the pc 's will have a faster connection as opposed to having an up to 11Mbps , you 'll have up to 100Mbps .	St
1.8.7	As far as the addresses are concerned , you can have any ip address you want withing a class , with a C class address being the most common one ( 192.168.1.1 ) , the router wo n't really care what you assign the addresses to be .	St
1.8.8	Try this , build a table with assigned MAC addresses , so that the pc 's in your network do n't have problems connecting to the router .	St
1.8.9	Not only will it allow only those pc 's to your network but it 'll give you an extra layer of security .	St
1.9.1	Linkit : I took your suggestion and updated the firmware for my Linksys router .	St
1.9.2	That did the trick , although I still wonder why this was necessary .	St
1.9.3	Now each computer that is turned on is assigned an IP address , starting at the bottom of the list ( x.x.x.100 ) and going up sequentially from there .	St
1.9.4	This is as it should be , how it used to be , and is once again .	St
1.9.5	Many thanks for your concern , your assistance and your tenacity .	Polite
1.10.1	Hi , JB , Yes , why indeed the 100-client setting for so few computers ?	Ques
1.10.2	The router always used to assign IP addresses to the wireless adapters in order , starting with x.x.x.100 .	St
1.10.3	But a few days ago it decided to deny access to all but one computer in the house ... until I allowed a greater number of assignments , then it started assigning at x.x.x.151 and up .	St
1.10.4	In other words , it refused to give those assignments between x.x.x.101 and x.x.x.150 .	St
1.10.5	But updating the router 's firmware solved the problem , although this still has me a bit concerned as it simply 'quit working right ' for no apparent reason .	St
1.10.6	All five computers in the house have only wireless access to the router ; in fact , the only hard-wired connection to the router is between it and the DSL modem .	St
1.10.7	The router is in the attic and the computers are sprinkled throughout the house .	St
1.10.8	Even though I once attended a seminar about rewiring pre-information-age homes , punching holes , running wires and patching sheetrock is not my thing .	St
1.10.9	And thanks for the tip about building a table of MAC addresses .	Polite
1.10.10	I have done that using the router 's built-in utility just for this purpose .	St
1.10.11	The MAC list has only the addresses of the three desktops and two laptops , and should not assign an IP to any interlopers .	St
1.10.12	Before I did this , I was able to see neighbors trying to hop onto the network from time to time , perhaps automatically and honestly , but who knows ?	Ques
1.11.1	Sorry I did n't suggest to update the firmware sooner .	St
1.11.2	My earlier questions were to make sure that what you had observed as a problem was n't just the router functioning as configured .	St
1.11.3	When you provided some of the relevant router settings , it looked like something else was wrong .	St
1.11.4	If you update software ( OS , drivers , etc . )	St
1.11.5	on your comuters , it can make commuincation with a router problematic .	St
1.11.6	Unfortunately , the router manuals I 've seen do n't stress enough the importance of firware updates to solve problems .	St
1.11.7	Also , firmware may become corrupted .	St
1.11.8	Glad it 's fixed .	St
1.11.9	Happy networking !	St
1.12.1	enjoy the network .	Polite
1.12.2	Sometimes the firmware can do hokey things like that .	St
1.12.3	I was losing my connection to my modem every so often for no apparent reason and no one could tell me why .	St
1.12.4	I updated the firmware and the problem got fixed .	St
1.12.5	I also set the MTU 's manually to 1492 and it worked .	St
1.12.6	Go figure .	St
1.12.7	As far as punching holes and stuff , it might be easy just to do it to the closest room in the upper level of your home where one of the pc 's resides .	St
1.12.8	Assuming that there 's a phone jack in the wall , all you would have to do is absolutely nothing but plug the modem to the wall jack , power it , hok it to the router and then to the pc .	St
1.12.9	I 'm also assuming that for some reason the phone company decided it would be best to wire a phone line in the attic ?	Ques
1.12.10	( that 's kinda weird to me ) .	St
1.12.11	If that 's the case , it 's very easy to run a line to the closest room on the second level where one of the pc 's resides .	St
1.12.12	Nonetheless , that could be a nice weekend project .	St
1.12.13	I just would n't feel right leaving my router in my attic where it could be exposed to whatever ( including water and heat ) , that 's just me .	St
