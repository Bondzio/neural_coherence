We have the two name brands and the model numbers but the driver would be the monitor driver.
This is not so much a driver but a file called monitor.inf that let's Windows know what settings to show for that monitor.
You can google MONITOR.INF if you want to learn what these files do.
As I noted, I find many don't want to install these so a trip to a good shop is often the cure.
Then again, you just bought the machine from who?
Maybe they'll fix this for you.
