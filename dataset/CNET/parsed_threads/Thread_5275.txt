<s> Hey guys, gotta question for you. </s>
<s> I built my first desktop yesterday. </s>
<s> Everything seems to be going well except... sometimes when I turn the system on, the motherboard screen comes up with the fancy picture that says &quot;asus m2n4-sli&quot; and says press delete to enter setup.. so I leave it to continue booting, and sometimes at that screen the system resets and trys to boot again.. sometimes the 2nd boot is successfull, other times it gets caught in a loop where it keeps resetting. </s>
<s> This doesnt happen all the time tho, maybe once every 10 times i try to start the system. </s>
<s> Any help would be greatly appreciated. </s>
<s> also, sometimes it just freezes before bios. </s>
<s> If i reset a couple of times it usually works and boots windows. </s>
<s> Anything have any idea? </s>
<s> this is driving me nuts. </s>
<s> NIL </s>
<s> Hey, Sorry, The components are as follows Asus M2N4-SLI Nvidia Socket AM2 ATX Motherboard AMD Athlon 64 X2 5200+ Socket AM2 Processor Ultra 500 watt powersupply Kingston 1024mb DDR2 Memory Module Western Digital 250 Gig SATA Hard drive XFX Geforce 7600 GS PCI Express Running OS: Windows XP </s>
<s> If the video card requires a 4-pin Molex or 6-pin PCI Express power connector directly from the PSU, make the connection. </s>
<s> I dont see anywhere to plug in the video card, also the video card works fine when the system boots up.. hmm.. im confused. </s>
<s> To confirm if the video card does or doesn't require extra power, consult its manual or post its exact model number here. </s>
<s> I checked the manual just after i last posted. </s>
<s> It doesnt say anything about connecting power to the card. </s>
<s> Did you download and install ALL the latest drivers for your motherboard, including the chipset drivers. </s>
<s> Remember that we can't rely on the XP installer's &quot;best guess&quot; drivers. </s>
<s> Firmly reseat your RAM module. </s>
<s> While you're at it, reseat all other cards. </s>
<s> Then download and run Memtest86+ to test it. </s>
<s> BTW, what's the model number of the RAM module? </s>
<s> If you're running XP and you have loaded Microsoft SP2, the trouble could be the Roxio installation. </s>
<s> Some versions of XP auto-install Roxio MediaPaq Browser or the Roxio CD maker. </s>
<s> If you are lucky enough to get past the boot go to Search and delete anything that has Roxio in its title. </s>
<s> I doubt if you'll find Roxio in your Uninstall Program list, but you may, so check that first. </s>
<s> Roxio's website has a free download that solves this problem. </s>
<s> but i have previously reseated all the cards, updated bios, cleared cmos, reinstalled windows. </s>
