rotation is on a different tab than the monitor selection window, but regardless of which monitor i selected, only the primary monitor rotated.
again this could be due to my setup (1 widescreen with dvi, 1 4:3 with vga).
still, enough folks have dual displays that you should be able to find someone who can confirm it for you.
