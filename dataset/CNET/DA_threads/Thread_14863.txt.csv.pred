1.1.1	I know you have been asked this question 1000 times but I checked and dont see the help I need ... I had to reboot my dell inspriron 6000 to factory install for the first time ... not bad after all these years ... problem is now I cant get onto the internet ... I know it is wireless ready because I have been using it for years ... I have comcast internet and use a Netgear wireless router ... I am writing now via my desktop ... I am at the beginning set up stage and it asks me for my wep or wpa key ... I have no idea what that would be or how to find it ... your forums say to key in some numbers using the the explorers address bar but since I cant use explorer at the moment I am lost ... I have had everything for at least five years so I would not know where to look for key codes or pass words ...	St
