<s> Hello, I am interesed in attaching small containers/trays (about 2 - 4 inches in width) to my flat screen monitor. </s>
<s> I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions on how to attach the tray to the monitor without it scratching my monitor. </s>
<s> Ideally, I would like the option for the container to be next to the side of the monitor or to be hidden behind the monitor. </s>
<s> This would mean that whatever the container is attached to must be flexible enough so that I can slide the tray to the back of the monitor. </s>
<s> Any ideas? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> First, you need to create the container. </s>
<s> On one side of the object, have two loops extending from the top and bottom. </s>
<s> Take a small rod and place over it two rods- each with a swivel joint- at the top and bottom of this rod with rubber washers to stabilize the area and prevent unnecessary moving. </s>
<s> Connect the rod through the loops and cap off the top and bottom to prevent slipping. </s>
<s> With each rod running perpendicular to your box, make another rod with an arm in the middle and attach the two connecting rods at the top and bottom. </s>
<s> Make a small plate with two loops close together and attach the other end of the rod to the plate. </s>
<s> From the plate, create a set of legs that wrap around and attach small screws with soft feet at the bottom. </s>
<s> You can use suction cups. </s>
<s> Use this makeshift vise to attach the plate to the monitor. </s>
<s> If I knew what it was for I might be able to help you </s>
<s> The container will be similar to a round ashtray. </s>
<s> In the container, you can put either paperclips, Ipod, phone or post-it notes. </s>
<s> It would contain things you use or reach for everyday in an office setting. </s>
<s> I would like to clip this to my flat screen monitor. </s>
<s> The container will be at the side of the monitor but should be able to move to the back of the monitor if I want to hide it. </s>
<s> What materials do I need to ask for when I go to a local hardware store? </s>
<s> Thanks for the reply. </s>
<s> It sounds like a good idea. </s>
<s> The only problem is that my container will not have a top (open container). </s>
<s> It will look similar to a round ashtray and might be angled a little bit so that the person sitting in the chair can see what's in the container and be able to reach for it. </s>
<s> If I were to go to Home Depot, I would ask for 2 loops, 2 rods, 2 swivel joints, 2 rubber washers, and a small plate (what kind/brand)? </s>
<s> Sorry, I'm not familiar with all this new terminology. </s>
<s> And in case you're wondering, it's for a class project. </s>
<s> And yes, I am in way over my head. </s>

<s> You can also pick up the tray featured in the above picture: http://www.fellowes.com/Fellowes/site/products/ProductDetails.aspx?Id=8031101 </s>
<s> Thanks for sharing the links. </s>
<s> It's useful. </s>
<s> But this is a class project and I have to make it. </s>
<s> Compare the design given to a human arm. </s>
<s> The box can be the hand itself. </s>
<s> The rod which connects is the metacarpus. </s>
<s> The two rods are the radius and ulna. </s>
<s> The second bar- with three rods- can be considered the elbow. </s>
<s> The last single rod is the humerus. </s>
<s> You're being given a design that will work. </s>
<s> If you make it, you can patent it, and never have to give credit. </s>
<s> This will represent the side of the container.--&gt; | This will represent a loop on the side --&gt; (. </s>
<s> (| &lt;-- That is the design. </s>
<s> or like a letter d. |D Now using symbols here, = for two rods, | for the connecting rod, - for the representation of the humerus. </s>
<s> We have =|- as the basic design. </s>
<s> I have to use more letter for a representation of the design d as one end, and p as the other. </s>
<s> Using this we create what the rod may look like. </s>
<s> d----p. This being the two ends of the horizontal rod which will fit over the vertical one and allow motion based on a simple hinge design. </s>
<s> Like I said: Put this together, take the credit, patent it, and you won't have to give anyone credit. </s>
<s> It's also known as being lazy and not doing things for yourself. </s>
<s> In case you didn't notice, this is a forum where people share their knowledge and expertise. </s>
<s> I am in this forum to get familiar with something that is unfamiliar to me. </s>
<s> I have never built anything. </s>
<s> I want to become familiar with different tools and hardware that might be helpful for my project. </s>
<s> Again, this is a class project. </s>
<s> I plan on doing this myself. </s>
<s> To resort to calling people names is uncalled for, undeserved and unnecessary especially when all I simply want to do is to become familiar with materials in a hardware store. </s>
<s> Nonetheless, I thank you for your previous help but I wish that you did not give your input in the first place if you were going to write such such a mean-spirited second posting. </s>
<s> I can assure you, I will not use your idea or your design. </s>
<s> Didn't you learn basic human anatomy and the six simple machines in school? </s>
<s> I am going to assume this is a basic engineering project and you are asking people that have little or no expertise in that field. </s>
