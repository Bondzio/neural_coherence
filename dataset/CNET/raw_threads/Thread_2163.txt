Long story short: By mistake, I ended up with two versions of XP Pro on the same IDE HDD. Now, I'm wanting to install my new SATA HDD and make it the boot drive. Issue 1. I want to make the new SATA HDD the C:/ drive and the old IDE HDD a D:/ drive. I see where to do this under Disk Management. However, do I need to reconfigure the IDE to be slave even though it will be the only one on the IDE cable? Issue 2. Do I do a fresh install of XP Pro on the SATA and then delete the two versions from the IDE? Can I even delete XP from the IDE? I definitely only want one version of XP, period. Issue 3. I want to keep files (photos, music, etc.) on the IDE for protection and XP on the SATA. Where should I put programs such as Office, Photoshop, etc. Issue 4. Is there a best practice anyone can point me to for splitting up my HDD like I am trying to do?

After the install is finished on the SATA drive you can delete the XP on the IDE drive if you want to. You will heve to reinstall ALL of your software on the SATA drive, and use the IDE as a data drive. John

I forgot, that unless you a very new XP ( SP2) install CD you will have to install the SATA drivers that come with SATA drive when the install program asks for 3rd party drivers. I'm assuming that your MB has SATA on it. John
