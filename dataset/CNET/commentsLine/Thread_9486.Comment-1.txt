i have a 160gb simpletech simpledrive usb 2 external hard drive.
it's been working fine for several months, and now all of sudden its giving me problems.
i can see all the files on the hard drive, and can delete them occasionally, but anytime i try to copy or access the files windows slows to a complete stop and nothing happens until i pull the plug.
i've tried 4 different usb cables, i've tried plugging it into a different computer, and nothing has worked.
i've tried defragging the hard drive several times, i've run chkdsk a bunch of times, and everything comes out normal.
i've tried running chkdsk in deepscan mode, but then it just tells me that for a bunch of files it doesn't have the space to replace the bad sectors, even though it has about 20gb free.
any suggestions?
