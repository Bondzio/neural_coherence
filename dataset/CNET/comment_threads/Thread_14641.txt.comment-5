Trust me, it's not a driver issue.
The problem lies somewhere else in the computer, not your graphics card.
Games and other very large applications tend to use a lot of memory, and will crush if you don't have enough ram.
When a GPU overheats, you start seeing artifacts.
It won't prompt the computer to restart immediately.
