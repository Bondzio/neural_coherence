Sorry, here's the bad news, not much.
Tops would be $250 with EVERYTHING included.
Leave something out, it drops more.
Maybe, if you sold it piece meal it sell more or not, it's an old PC and roughly when you check the pricing for anything new you get an idea what you're up against.
That's my guess but you can check eBay and Craigslist for comparison pricing as well.
