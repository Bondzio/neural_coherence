the bios is made by american megatrends version 3.21 for the asustek piranha 915p motherboard which is strictly for oems.
i have the latest version.
i have a 400watt psu.
as for the beeps, i believe it is 4 beeps or 3 not so sure.
but its either ram or motherboard problem.
believe it to be motherboard, due to the temporary solution being to yank out psu and push power button.
thnx for the quick replies.
roger
