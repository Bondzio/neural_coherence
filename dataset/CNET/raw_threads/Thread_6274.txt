All initial thoughts pointed to the power supply, so I opened the case to see if I could see any evidence of component failure. I've removed the power supply and nothing seems dead (looks and smell) but i saw this next to the combined fan/speaker arrangement. &lt;img src=&quot; http://www.benlawrencephoto.co.uk/G5.jpg&quot; &gt; So the questions are: 1) what are these cables for, and should they be connected? 2) If this cable disconnected itself and shorted with the case, would it damage the power supply or the logic board... or both. I'm happy to replace the power supply, but I don't know if it is the power supply that's dead, or the logic board! I'm having to do this myself as I can't afford to have it done professionally. (i've built PCs for years, but not macs) ANY help you can offer would really help..... please?

I'll have a look in the Tech Manual this evening, another 12 hours, and see it I can locate it and its purpose. Logic boards do not usually go &quot;Bang&quot; when they fail. P

Even Apple was replacing these boards far out of warranty if you call it in. Hint: If you find this, ASK. Don't assume they won't make good on this issue. Bob

Your shot was from a different angle than the one in the tech manual but I am confident that this is what they are. However, if you have Wireless/Bluetooth installed on that machine, feel free to disagree Bob's theory on the capacitors is worth checking P

This is a really old posting, but not a single person referred to the issue of the G5 dual problems. In a nutshell, do a search for &quot;g5 dual liquid-cooled leak&quot; or similar. You will learn that almost ALL of the G5 dual models produced suffered liquid-cooled leaks. This leak of a radiator-type fluid (toxic) would, in turn, fry the mother board. Leading up to this would be inexplicable behavior including what seemed like software issues, locking up and, you guessed it, screaming fans. There are a total of 6 fans in these models, so when the motherboard was glitching and running them all, it does sound like a jet! Anyone experiencing this issue (even now...2010) should contact apple support and immediately ask for a supervisor. This was a massive problem involving a multitude of macs; one which apple successfully &quot;handled&quot; on a case-by-case basis, thereby avoiding a massive recall.
