Thank you bill for the fast rsponse..
I used &quot;iperf&quot; and as u said it works very well, but the problem with this tool is that it doesn't give u a real time calcualtion.
I want u to know that I have full control for both ends.
Knowing this, will wireshark be able to provide me with a real time throughput calculation?
Thank u again 4 your help..
