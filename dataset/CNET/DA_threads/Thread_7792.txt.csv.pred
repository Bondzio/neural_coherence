1.1.1	I have a IBM Aptiva, P2, 350Mhz, with a Maxtor 10GB HDD.	St
1.1.2	When I replaced the 10GB hard drive with a 60GB hard drive, my computer won't boot up.	St
1.1.3	I have tried using a boot disk in the floppy drive.	St
1.1.4	There is a blinking cursor after I start the computer.	St
1.1.5	Changing the boot sequence in the system setup has no affect.	St
1.1.6	I am still unable to get the computer to read a disk in the floppy drive or the CD ROM drive.	St
1.1.7	Is there a limit to the drive capacity in the computer?	St
1.1.8	My original hard drive is getting ready to fail.	St
1.1.9	Should I look aroung for a replacement hard drive with the same disk capacity of 10GB?	St
1.1.10	Thank you for your help.	St
1.2.1	From memory I would try drives at known hard drive limit sizes..	St
1.3.1	the 10 Gb drive in and adding the other drive??	St
1.3.2	However, even if the new drive is recognized you will likely run into the 32 GB limited that Robert's reply is baased on.	St
1.3.3	That is a rather old computer and thus it may be difficult to get an updated BIOS from the IBM site.	St
1.3.4	However it is possible you do not have the latest BIOS even though it would be a version from years ago.	St
1.3.5	Gee, if you have a boot floppy such as one made by Win 98 the floppy should read it even if you do not have a hard drive of any type in the computer.	St
1.3.6	It should get you to an A prompt.	St
1.3.7	Newegg has a nice 20 GB Seagate with 5 year warranty for about $45.	St
1.3.8	Brand new drives not in retail box, thus called OEM.	St
1.3.9	I'm NOT suggesting thast you give up trying to use the large drive.	St
