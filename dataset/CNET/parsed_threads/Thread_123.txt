<s> I want to add an 80G Western Digital hard drive to my Dell, which has a 20G right now. </s>
<s> I don't want to replace the 20G...I'm keeping it. </s>
<s> So....I'm running XP, and I don't know what the heck they are talking about with the &quot;bios&quot; thing. </s>
<s> Is this going to be beyond my capabilities? </s>
<s> The directions seem fairly straightforward, other than that bios thing. </s>
<s> Tell me if I'm nuts, and should just pay somebody to do it. </s>
<s> I got a great deal on the drive, and was hoping to be self-sufficient, if I could. </s>
<s> :-P Thanks for your help~ Sharon </s>
<s> First, is there an available bay in the PC? </s>
<s> Next, will the MB BIOS support an 80 gig drive. </s>
<s> If &quot;yes&quot; to both, you should be fine in doing it yourself. </s>
<s> There is a potential of a power supply issue but 2 drives aren't usually a problem. </s>
<s> Go for it and good luck. </s>
<s> &quot;WD Raptor Retail Hard Drive Kits Western Digitals desktop hard drives are available in retail kits that include the hardware, software and step-by-step illustrated instructions needed to quickly and easily install the hard drive. </s>
<s> Kits over 137 GB also come with a free Ultra ATA controller card.&quot; - http://www.wdc.com/en/library/ Usually, people do just fine. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks S and Bob. </s>
<s> Apparently S didn't read about my ignorance as to the &quot;bios&quot;. </s>
<s> I don't even know what that is, much less how to check if my motherboard can handle this. </s>
<s> Can you guys help me there? </s>
<s> How would I check to find out if it can support the new 80G? </s>
<s> Good point on checking for a slot for the new drive, S. </s>
<s> Duh...I just assumed it would fit. </s>
<s> I swear, sometimes I feel like an idiot. </s>
<s> I just assumed there would be room in there...it's a big tower...lol. </s>
<s> It's really quite simple. </s>
<s> You shouldn't have to change anything in the BIOS. </s>
<s> I had a Dell with a 40GB hard drive and I added a 120GB with no problem. </s>
<s> The only thing to watch is how you actually connect the second drive. </s>
<s> On my drive, the jumper pins were set for the &quot;cable select&quot; method. </s>
<s> In fact, I don't think I even had to change the pins on the new drive since most use the cable select method now. </s>
<s> Unless this machine is very old, the BIOS issue rarely pops up. </s>
<s> Being able to run XP or if it came with XP is why I didn't write a word about this issue. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Ahhh...you guys are feeding my confidence now. </s>
<s> The machine is only 3 yrs old...that's not TOO old, right? </s>
<s> XP runs great on it, and the new hard drive did say the pins will be set at that cable select setting. </s>
<s> So...if I leave the jumper there, the jumper on the 20G should also be set at &quot;cable select&quot;, right? </s>
<s> OH, and should I be worrying about my 20G crashing for any reason? </s>
<s> I have yet to get my CD-RW up and running again after it died on me...that's another story...ugh...so I don't really have a way to back up the original hard drive. </s>
<s> Is that too scary? </s>
<s> I'd say there's a good chance the old drive will also be cable select. </s>
<s> Just to make sure, there's a chart at this site: http://support.wdc.com/techinfo/general/jumpers.asp As far as the old drive crashing, unless you've been having trouble with it, I don't see why it would. </s>
<s> After you install the second drive, you'll need to format it and then you'll be able to use it as extra storage. </s>
<s> Thanks for the link and the info, Mike. </s>
<s> I'm feeling pretty good about trying this now. </s>
<s> It should be a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon, right? </s>
<s> I appreciate the input from all of you. </s>
<s> I love this board! </s>
<s> I'll come back and let you know how I do. </s>
<s> Have a great weekend! </s>

<s> http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=how+to+install+a+second+hard+drive There are about 50 step by step articles on how to do it. </s>
<s> Also take the moderator's advice and go to the western digital site and download their instructions, they are very good on how to physically install and set the jumpers etc. </s>
<s> If your drive is different go to the manufacturer's site and get the same. </s>
<s> It is easy if you take your time. </s>
<s> The BIOS is firmware/software installed on your motherboard that includes a setup module which you can usually enable by hitting delete or another key (read your manual) during the initial power-on sequence. </s>
<s> It is where you tell the system about new devices or it tells you it has recognized new devices (or hasn't) when you add/change key hardware like drives, CDROM, etc.. </s>
<s> It has many other functions and you should read your computer manual and learn about them. </s>
<s> you should take a moment and consider how you're going to make these drives line up so the cables can reach them. </s>
<s> I usually do this: from the top of the case down: master C drive, CD rom, and second hard drive. </s>
<s> A lot of CD roms like to be set as master, so I put the Primary EIDE cable to the C: drive, then I put the end of the secondary EIDE cable to the CD ROM and the middle connector to the second hard drive. </s>
<s> If all are set to cable select, this will make the CD rom a secondary master and the new drive a secondary slave. </s>
<s> I also try to calculate the location of the drives to leave as much space as possible between them for cooling purposes. </s>
<s> I say, don't mess with the BIOS unless absolutely necessary. </s>
<s> keep touching the case throughout the procedure to avoid a static electric spark that could kill everything. </s>
<s> and UNPLUG IT. </s>

<s> I have 2 additional hard drives on my computer and suggest the following : 1. </s>
<s> My internal hard drive is 160 GB 2. </s>
<s> I have an external 60 GB hard drive which is contained in a 5 1/4 &quot;drive enclosure. </s>
<s> 3. </s>
<s> I also have an additional 27 GB external hard drive that I took out from an old compoter when I installed a new system. </s>
<s> A drive enclosure is valuable, as you can install CD-R writers or DVD writers. </s>
<s> It is also practical as you do not have to open your CPU and play around with switches, etc. </s>
<s> Once you have an external hard drive you can move files from the internal to the external with great ease. </s>
<s> I hope that I helped you resolve a problem and should you need fyrther assistance, just let me know. </s>
<s> If you want to istall a second hard drive you have to set the jumpers on it as slave and then go to the dos prompt and select fdisk. </s>
<s> Go to number 5 and selrect partition disk. </s>
<s> when you reboot there will be a new drive letter. </s>
