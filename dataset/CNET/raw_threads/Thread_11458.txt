I am not a hardware expert, but pretty handy with PC hardware, I have installed DVD writers, video cards etc. Any help is appreciated.

The newer P4 is more demanding plus any other devices to make it a happy medium. Its just better to get all new or any used that is capable. But as mentioned what came with the old system may not cut it. -OR- shop for some OEM that on its own merit provides a jumping point into P4 realm at a bargain, but you take what you get as OEM provided. Look into a eMachine or HP models. Of course that leaves Compaq, Gateway and IBM to consider as well, they're usually on sale on a regular basis. The choice is yours... tada -----Willy
