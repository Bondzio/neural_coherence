<s> I'm having lots of grief in configuring my wireless network. </s>
<s> Last week, before I moved, everything was working fine. </s>
<s> I had cable internet, my desktop PC was connected directly to my wireless router, and my laptop used wireless to connect to the network. </s>
<s> On the weekend I moved, changed ISPs, added a VoIP terminal, and am now trying to configure both my PC and laptop with wireless cards. </s>
<s> Here's my layout: cable -&gt; cable modem -&gt; voip terminal -&gt; wireless router After experimenting a long while last night, I was able to get either my laptop OR my desktop connected, but not both! </s>
<s> Both PCs are running Win XP SP2. </s>
<s> Here's what I know for sure: - The Internet connection itself is working. </s>
<s> I can connect to wherever at one of the computers. </s>
<s> - The restriction doesn't have to do with the ACL on the wireless router (as I've disabled it and still have the problem) - The problem doesn't appear to be security related, as I can remove all security on the router and still have the same problem - I reserved two IPs on the router, one for the desktop, one for the laptop, and configured their wireless cards to use these IPs. </s>
<s> This doesn't seem to be the problem, but I could be wrong. </s>
<s> - The PC that can't connect is getting DNS information, but not much else. </s>
<s> If I ping google.com, it resolves to an IP, but I never get a response. </s>
<s> Also, from this PC I can't ping other PCs on the network or the router. </s>
<s> - Both PCs ARE connecting to the wireless network, but one of them can't connect to the Internet or to anything else on the network. </s>
<s> Does anyone have any thoughts on what might be wrong, or what else I could do to diagnose and fix the problem? </s>
<s> let dhcp assign the IP's... just for trouble shooting, remove the VOIP terminal.. </s>
<s> I had a similar problem. </s>
<s> I powered everything down and rebooted in the order you have them linked and making sure that each device was completely booted before powering on the next device. </s>
<s> 1. you may want to post the output from &quot;ipconfig/all&quot; on both computers, so we have more information to go on by. </s>
<s> 2. do you have any other virtual or physical network cards installed on the problematic computer? </s>
<s> (ie. </s>
<s> vmware, vpn, etc.) </s>
<s> 3. have you tried using dhcp as opposed to static mapping? </s>
<s> in my mixed wireless/wired home network, i do utilize dhcp and static mapping with no issues, but i've seen some funny things happen when i tried static mapping with some home NAT devices -- most likely because of misconfiguration. </s>
<s> 4. are you able to ping your NAT/router from your problem PC? </s>
<s> 5. how did you configure DNS server entries on your computers? </s>
<s> are you letting your NAT/router be the gateway to your ISP's DNS servers? </s>
<s> if you are NOT able to ping even the NAT/router but you are able to get DNS resolutions then --- errrrr --- i have to think about that... but that'll be a nice bit of info to know. </s>
<s> i don't ever check these forums, the only reason why i came across this post, is because this post somehow showed up as &quot;news&quot; on my google desktop... so ehrm... good luck! </s>
<s> cm </s>
<s> I tried using DHCP, but no difference. </s>
<s> Haven't tried removing the VOIP terminal. </s>
<s> That's not really an option, but I guess it's a place to start. </s>
<s> You write ... cable -&gt; cable modem -&gt; voip terminal -&gt; wireless router Which could result in the voip grabbing your one and only IP address. </s>
