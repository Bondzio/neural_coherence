dear sir: i did exactly what you told me to do and in the presence of a technician.
i'm still at step one, that is in windows me i get msxml.dll not regestered whereas in x.p.
the scanner works ok. any suggestions?
i even tried to install an update for msxml and the dialogue box said that it's already installed and it wouldn't let me install.
