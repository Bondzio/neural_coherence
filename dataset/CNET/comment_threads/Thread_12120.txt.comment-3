a Dell Photo All-In-One Printer 964.
It can print on thick paper, photo paper, etc.
I usually get my photos printed at a place like Walmart, cheaper.
Ink I purchase is around $23 a cartridge and I use the cheap ones.
My printer is no longer made.
Make a trip to Office Max or Staples and check out the printers and the prices of ink for them.
A nice sales person should be willing to help you.
