<s> LEXMARK X5150 warranty recently expired for this All-In-One. </s>
<s> I have replaced the 83 color cartridge several times but even wicking, cleaning the back and the inside cartridge holder doesn't help. </s>
<s> Any red portion of document or photo prints yellow! </s>
<s> CAN SOMEONE PLEASE HELP? </s>

<s> Hmm.. doesnt sound nice. </s>
<s> I know you may not be happy with the results. </s>
<s> However at this point I can only imagine that the contacts on the printer is defective. </s>
<s> The problem cannot be fixed. </s>
<s> If you have ever used a refilled cartridge, please do not do so because that will damage the contacts on the printer. </s>
<s> If you ask how. </s>
<s> Lexmark cartridges are Gel based water soluble inks manufactured with high atmospheric pressure. </s>
<s> Refilling the cartridge will equalize pressure inside the cartridge with that of the atmosphere. </s>
<s> In the long run this will seriously damage the contacts. </s>
<s> For a common man this explaination always does not satisfy. </s>
<s> But for a product designer it really makes sense. </s>
<s> Hope this helps! </s>
<s> What might have caused this &quot;damage&quot; is interesting because it wasn't refilled cartridges. </s>
<s> I used brand new ones. </s>
<s> I used the printer infrequently, but that shouldn't have changed the color control. </s>
