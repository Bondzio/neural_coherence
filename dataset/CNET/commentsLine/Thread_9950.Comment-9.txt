this ---&gt; it will boot, no matter how different the hardware is.
windows will just detects the list of new devices and try to install drivers for it is wrong... take a hd from xp machine #1 put it in xp machine #2 and only if you are very very lucky will it boot up to desktop!
(and even then, you may possibly have problems with display/sound/modem etc) take that same hd and put it in a win98 machine, and i will wager it will never boot up... .
