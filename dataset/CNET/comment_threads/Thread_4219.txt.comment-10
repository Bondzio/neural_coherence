Intel's advertised speed is always higher than AMD, because it uses a technique called Quad Data Rate, which transfers 4 data per clock cycle.
Let's say the Intel cpu is said to be 3.2GHz, it's real clock is actually only 800MHz, because 3200/4=800.
AMD uses a technique called Double Data Rate, it transfers 2 data per clock.
Therefore, lets say u have an AMD with 2.2GHz, the true clock is 2200/2, which equals to 1.1GHz.
Thus AMD is actually faster than Intel.
It may not make sense to you now, but if you look at the link on the bottom, and do some other research, you will see what I am talking about.
You may not understand what I am saying now, because I am bad at explaining things, but you will after some googling.
