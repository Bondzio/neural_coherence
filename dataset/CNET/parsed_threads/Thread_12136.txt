<s> When I play on xbox live with my ethernet to my Dlink DI-524 my connection begins to lag after about 2 minutes on xbox live. </s>
<s> I got back on my other computers and the connections are inconsistant and slow. </s>
<s> Even after I turn off my xbox and reset my router. </s>
<s> what is causing this? </s>
<s> It almost went in the trash until a firmware update fixed it. </s>
<s> Of course the internet can get slow too. </s>

<s> However, if I bypass the router, the connection is perfectly consitant and fast. </s>
<s> 4.6 mbps download, 518kbps upload. </s>
<s> Even at peak hours. </s>
<s> There are gaming settings but the 524 is a cheap thing. </s>
<s> Works here, some will have to replace it. </s>
