I using DVI(1meter) connect to my acerx203H and VGA(1M) connect to my HDTV. It is able to display my screen. The problem is when i replace the VGA(1M) to VGA(10M) cable, then there is no more display on my HDTV. So i wonder whether is my VGA(10M) have problem and i use it to connect between pc n my ACER X203H. It have display but blur. Then only i notice the length of VGA cable will affect the display quality. But is this the reason my HDTV cant show? or other settings than i forgotten? Because the problem is just between 1M vga cable and 10M vga cable..
