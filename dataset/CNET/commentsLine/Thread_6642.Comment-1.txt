does somebody know how to deal with this problem?
i have a benq external cd-rw usb device and the notebook recognizes it as an usb optical storage.
i tried it in a desktop and it does the same thing.
i cant even install the driver because it does not found the device or because windows looks for a driver of a usb data storage.
thank you in advance
