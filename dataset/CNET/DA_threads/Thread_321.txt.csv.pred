1.1.1	My ATI 9600 256mb sapphire atlantis is running a lot slower than it is supposed to.	St
1.1.2	So i check out Catalyst Control center to see what my AGP speed is set at for my motherboard.	St
1.1.3	it is currently set at off.	St
1.1.4	so i try to change it to x8 which it is built for.	St
1.1.5	but, my system deems the change unsafe and sets it back to off.	St
1.1.6	is this a hardware problem or somthing i can do with software.	St
1.1.7	(i need to change the AGP speed to x8) please help	St
1.2.1	I remember stories like that with some older motherboards and there was no cure since the board maker never released a new BIOS or patch to get the 8X slot to 8x.	St
1.2.2	Could be &quot;one of those.&quot; Bob	St
1.3.1	yeah it is an older Asus that i bought off ebay.	St
1.3.2	um the model is P4S800.	St

1.5.1	Hello, Latest BIOS?	St
1.5.2	8X AGP activated in BIOS?	St
1.5.3	Latest MB Chipset drivers?	St
1.5.4	Latest Video Card drivers & DirectX?	St
1.5.5	Drivers properly installed?	St
1.5.6	If all this is done, try in a different computer.	St
1.5.7	If all the drivers are current & the problem still exists, your looking at a hardware issue.	St
1.5.8	Good luck & keep us informed.	Polite
