It would let me know if any upgrades were needed on my computer. It was taken out of the download area. Why and where can I find another one ???

Many won't pay (all it seems) so we get to update drivers the old fashioned way. Make a list of what we need to update (I suggest don't unless you have an issue) and then visit the maker's website. BELARC ADVISOR helps. Bob
