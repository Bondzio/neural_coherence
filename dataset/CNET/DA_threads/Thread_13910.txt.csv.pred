1.1.1	I have not had very good experiences with our IT guy at work -- he has some odd ideas like saying that Mozilla products are for & quot ; home users & quot ; only and insisting we ca n't use Firefox .	St
1.1.2	I went ahead and purchased a new Dell Studio desktop with Win 7 for my office ( without his advice , which annoyed him ) and he is now insisting that I ca n't run Win 7 -- that all computers on the network must be on the same operating system ( most are using XP ) , and he claims all computers must have same software , and has moved people & quot ; back & quot ; to Excel 2004 , etc , removing newer editions .	St
1.1.3	I ca n't find any evidence to support this .	St
1.1.4	He claims that the server wo n't run properly if we use different operating systems .	St
1.1.5	I think he is misguiding us .	St
1.1.6	Any input ?	Ques
1.2.1	They have a hard enough time with just XP in the brew .	St
1.2.2	For years we had NT , 2000 , then XP in the brew of clients .	St
1.2.3	We did however have to ditch DOS/98/ME systems due to too unstable and stealing IT staff time helping those that clung to the old systems .	St
1.2.4	Good riddance to that .	St
1.2.5	HOWEVER the IT staffer would be in their rights to demand 7 Pro since that 's what 's needed in an domain or active server setting .	St
1.2.6	Do n't battle too hard with them .	St
1.2.7	I find they eventually explode or catch up .	St
1.2.8	Bob	St
1.3.1	The post in the Windows 7 forum is the right forum for this .	St
