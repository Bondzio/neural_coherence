Hi everyone, I have an old emachine T5048, pentium 4 3.06 with XP pro, 1 gig of ram, 160 HD and a samsumg dvd label flash drive.
My question is: can I replace the motherboard and with a better processor and much faster RAM, if so, do I have to reinstall XP, do I have to change the hard drive and the dvd drive.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks.
Rafael
