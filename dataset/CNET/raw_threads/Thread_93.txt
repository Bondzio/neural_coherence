It goes to an AlphaShield then to a Neatgear WGT624v2 router. A couple times a day it will disconnect. The internet will slow down and then some of the lights will go out. Only lasts a minute or two then it will be ok and the lights will be steady. Does that sound like the modem going out or a Comcast problem? Is 5 years pretty old? Or could it be my AlphaShield or router?

I bought the modem so I'm not renting it from Comcast. So before I called Comcast I wanted to ask if it could be the modem going out which I would have to replace myself.
