Finally got the new ram, popped it in and all was good, installed windows, etc.
Only game I tested so far is BF Bad Company 2, but it runs great on Max 2xAA 4xAF, no visible lag.
The components are: MSI G31TM-P21 EVGA GeForce GTX 260 216 Pentium Dual-Core E6700 3.2Ghz G.SKILL 4GB DDR2-800 Creative X-Fi XG Built this pc for my bro, tried to recycle some parts from my old pc that died, but ended up replacing everything but the case and sound card.
I was hoping the old ram would work, it was $80 for the new one.
I have a better one with an i7, 8gb ram, ATI 5770, and Xonar Essence ST myself.
I was too impatient when my old pc died I went for a pre-built from my local Best Buy.
