if i had the funds to upgrade my (motherboard, cpu, memory, vidoe card pci xpress) i would have but i plan to do that the end off the year.
i got the bfg 256 6800 gt agp in january, which replaced the xfx 256 5700 le.
a week or two latter the 7800 agp cards came out.
i am not planning to upgrade the video card any more.
as far as my mobo is concerned it is maxed with the bigest socket a cpu amd xp 3200 you can put in it & 2 gigs of pc3200 memory duel channel.
power supply thermaltake 680. get a bigger power supply.
i would say get one of the 7800 agp cards.
the specs on them are realy nice.
(that is just my opion) good luck: wendell h
