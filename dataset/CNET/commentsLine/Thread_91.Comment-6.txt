i tried the freezer trick, doesn't work, i have tried it over and over again, and it still doesn't work.
i got a 10gb hard drive from ebay and it worked for a few minutes before it started clicking and it failed.
i am mad that ebay would allow such people to rip you off of 10 dollars.
hmph, and i am buying yet another hard drive from ebay, this time a 500gb for 11 dollars.
i hope this drive is not a waste of money.anyway, what shall i do to get my moneys worth out of that 10gb hard drive?
i would hate to see my money going to some one who rips people off regularlly of their hard earned cash.
