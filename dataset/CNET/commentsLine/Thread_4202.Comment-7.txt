your on the right path.
sometimes i drag the motherboard out onto a cardboard surface and add just the floppy, a little ram and see if it will boot consistently a dos diskette.
after i reach that stage i install it in the case and make sure no extra metal mounting posts are shorting out the back side of the board.
i build up from there.
