i've installed all the available drivers and it's still not working.
every morning it will still be offline and i have to keep rebooting the computer until the printer is ready to use.
it always comes out with an error message saying that the printer isn't attached properly, can't detect the printer and so on.
the printer using a usb 1.1 is attached to the computer that is using a usb 2.0 port.
will this matter?
