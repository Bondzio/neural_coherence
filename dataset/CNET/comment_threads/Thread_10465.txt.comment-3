I have same problems with my MP610.
I think it's the problem in cartbridgs, becous when I was using original Canon colors it was ok.
But now with other cartbridge bradn it prints cyan insted of black :s Tried on the same dvd-brand (verbatim printable) Funy is that other colors are ok only black is problem.
On paper is evrything fine.
If any one have a clue what is the reason pleas write me: rok.dezo[AF]gmail.com
