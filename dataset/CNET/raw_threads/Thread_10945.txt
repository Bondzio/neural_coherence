How would I hook up an extra IDE drive up to the motherboard to use it as a slave and or to transfer the files off of it. ASUS P4P800-SE motherboard prescott 3200 Processor windows XP pro

I will try it again. When you say &quot;(Single or CS will do)&quot; I set mine to slave is that ok?

When I look in the bios it says the sata is the 4th primary Am I missing somthing? The jumpers on the hard drive are set to use it as a slave

Move your SATA up to the first boot position. In most default scenarios, your system Bios will look for an IDE device first, this needs to be changed.
