I have parts like CD rom, and Floppy drive, and a harddrive, also a monitor, and keyboard and mouse. I checked out oveclocking.com becase my friend recomended it and he has built many computers. heres what i found. I was just wondering if any1 knew if the parts were compatible with each other, i have a socket 939 motherboard, and a socket 939 cpu. its SLI too.

Don't forget extra fans for cooling, windows and arctic silver 5,if you don't have windows cd, but oem or layman, if you have a store-bought windows computer's hard drive. Crucial ram, suggest change to corsair value instead. Other than that, looks good. Roger
