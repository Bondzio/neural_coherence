1.1.1	Hi!	St
1.1.2	Just finished dismatling my PC for the second time!	St
1.1.3	Having found the problem: PSU, I opened the dead PSU and found plently burnt/blackend/covered in god-knows-what capacitors and need a new one.	St
1.1.4	It was a 400W which had these rails (Is that the word for these?	St
1.1.5	): +5: 40A +12:14A -12:1A -5:1A 3.3V:28A VSB:2.5A Are those good?	St
1.1.6	I don't think so, but... Can anyone give me a good wattage range and/or brand for these components: P4 2.8Ghz GeForce 4 Ti 4600 CD-RW Drive DVD Drive 120GB 7200 RPM IDE HD QDI Superb4FX Motherboard NIC Card 5-Port USB 2.0 Card Floppy 56K Modem 12inch Cold Cathode Light 1GB of DDR3200 (Corsair Value) I have found that the connector to the motherboard is 2 rows of 10 pins totaling: A 20-pin connector for the motherboard.	St
1.1.7	I am aware that most new motherboards use the 24-pin, but there are adapters, aren't there?	St
1.1.8	I do have the website for the Motherboard: http://www.qdigrp.com/qdisite/eng/products/S4FX.htm I also need a recommendation for a Heatsink as the one I have currently is not doing too well.	St
1.1.9	My budget is low, maybe not over $75 for both items?	St
1.1.10	I can shop anywhere, but I'd rather not have to resort to eBay.	St
1.1.11	Just as an afterthought: This motherboard is not too hot, I have a NIC card and a USB card because those two items on the board don't work.	St
1.1.12	Should I buy a new motherboard?	St
1.1.13	But those are the only two things that aren't working.	St
1.1.14	I'd rather not make this like a huge ''makeover'', but should it be trashed and bought another?	St
1.1.15	But this is just an afterthought: The PSU and HSF are priority.	St
1.1.16	Sorry for the length, but this will be my first ''big'' computer item and want it to go smoothly.	St
1.1.17	Thanks in advance!	St
1.1.18	~Ibrahim~	St
1.2.1	i think this would do ok... http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817153006 and this for heatsink http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16835118112 and add in a tube of arctic silver thermal comp.	St
1.2.2	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16835100007	St
1.3.1	try the Fortron-Source AX450-PN.	Sug
1.3.2	Great bang for the buck from long time PSU builder.	St
1.3.3	Power supply works with either 20 or 24 PIN MB connector.	St
1.3.4	They always get good ratings when reviewed at site like Tomshardware.com.	St
1.3.5	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817104954 $49.99 plus shipping (reasonable at Newegg) Output +3.3V@30A, +5V@28A, +12V1@18A, +12V2@18A, -12V@0.5A, +5VSB@2A Re the HS FAN....your call plenty of choices at Newegg.	St
1.4.1	Does it have the connectors to power the IDE Drives (CD-RW,DVD, and HDD)?	St
1.4.2	It lists these connectors: 1 x Main connector (20+4 pin)- Good 1 x 12V (P4)-Good 6 x peripheral-What does that include?	St
1.4.3	IDE?	St
1.4.4	2 x SATA-Are SATA Power connectors the same as IDE?	St
1.4.5	1 x Floppy-Good I like the Heatsink, cool design!	St
1.4.6	Thanks~ ~Ibrahim~	St
1.5.1	My old PSU came with a CPU Duct which would direct the heat from the CPU to the back of the case via a funnel with a fan.	St
1.5.2	Now that I have to take that one out, the heatsink would be blowing air directly on to the side of the case, right?	St
1.5.3	What should I do?	Sug
1.5.4	Drill some holes for a case fan there?	St
1.5.5	Buy another duct/funnel?	St
1.5.6	~Ibrahim~	St
1.6.1	OK, I found a heat duct thing at NewEgg and I'm perfectly OK with drilling some holes for it and a big hole for the fan.	St
1.6.2	I just need a 80mm fan to go with it.	St
1.6.3	Any good recommendations?	Polite
1.6.4	I realize I've got to expand my budget a little.	St
1.6.5	~Ibrahim~	St
1.7.1	are the molex types used for such things as PATA drives.	St
1.7.2	Some earlier SATA drives used the same molex connector, However all of the newer SATA drives use a different type connector that are much different than the four pin molex.	St
1.8.1	OK, so far these are the parts that I am buying: PSU: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817104954 49.99 Thermal Grease: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?item=N82E16835100007 5.99 Air Duct: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16811998131 3.99 HSF (CPU) http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16835118112#DetailSpecs 29.99 80mm Fan for Air Duct: ???
