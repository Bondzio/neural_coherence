It's a 2TB hard drive and I have about 18GB of data on it. Can anyone suggest what i can do to make this drive accessible and recover my data without having to pay over $100 to geek squad? Thanks

I am a photographer. So the Ubuntu will recover the data? I bought this hard drive only a few months ago, might still be under warranty, do you think they'll be able to do anything better? Thanks

It's unlikely a standard OS (like Linux) will find that data. Warranty doesn't include recovery. If they can't repair it you'll get another empty one. If they repair it there's a good chance they delete your data in the process. So don't count on that. So if all you lost is your backup, you still have the originals. I'd start with buying another hard disk to copy them to have another backup. And from that external drive to another PC, of course, so you have 2 copies besides the original. Then keep the external on a safe place outside your office and you'll have an acceptable backup for professional environment. But webbased storage might even be better and easier. Kees

So when I replaced it, I bought the much more highly rated Western Digital My Book. Two months ago I heard the horrible &quot;click of death&quot; sound as it tried and tried to search for files and then failed. I finally got it to be recognized (sort of) by the computer. It assigned it a drive letter, but indicated that the drive was completely unformatted. About one Terebyte of data now gone! But there's an interesting end to this hard drive story. I didn't throw it away like I did the Fathom. And the other day I gave it a try again, but this time plugging it into a different circuit -- not the powerstrip where all my other components were plugged into. Apparently the power converter (this is just a guess of course) was not pulling quite enough power from the shared power strip to power the drive. Once it was on a seperate outlet, it did just fine and I was able to access my data. I'm not fully convinced something isn't wrong with the drive, but I was able to salvage and tranfer the data to another external drive. Kinda wierd! Because I have several other hard drives all plugged into power strips, and they all do just fine.
