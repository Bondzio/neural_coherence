you didn't include any information about your hardware, making it almost impossible to really supply a good answer.
not the tip about supplying all &quot;necessary information&quot; for a test you can unplug all hardware but the video card, motherboard, memory, hard drive and cpu to see if it will work with that.
if that doesn't work then pull the motherboard out of the case and set it up on a table with just the minimal hardware and see if that works.
