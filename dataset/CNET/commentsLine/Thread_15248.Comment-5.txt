what is the model number of your dell computer?
did the computer come from dell with the fat32 partition?
have you confirmed whether that partition is a restore partition?
a hard disk that full will lower overall system performance.
that is why it may be a good idea to purchase a larger hd.
if you don't want a new one, i would backup all important files to cd/dvd (or whatever external storage you have) and perform a fresh installation of windows xp.
during the installation, you will have the option to remove all partitions.
create one partition and install windows xp.
mission accomplished.
do you have the dell windows xp restoration cd?
do you have the dell driver cd?
you need these discs.
