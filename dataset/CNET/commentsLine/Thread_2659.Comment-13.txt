i used to be a wd loyalist.
however after the 2nd wd hd meltdown in 2 years, i switched allegiance to seagate.
their 5 year warranty is definitely a major reason, price and performance is another.
as for wd, i am also not happy with the warranty turnaround.
took over 3 weeks to get my hd replaced, but to give them credit, they upgraded me from a sata to sataii (same capacity) to speed up the process a bit.
however, meanwhile i had picked up a seagate baracuda from a local merchant.
now i have 2 seagates for my dual boot machine and i am using the wd as temp storage for misc downloads.
we'll see if my confidence in wd will be regained.
