having set up both for clients my choice would be the netgear.
i find it easier to set up and use, especially if things do not work right away!
i have a netgear 108mbps, but honestly do not notice much difference in operation from the 54mbps.
dont use usb wireless devices on a computer, use pci or pcmcia cards instead, i have had several instances of them disconnecting frequently (tweaking the wireless zero configuration service can or cannot help - but who needs the hassle).
hope this info helps
