Formatting 1tb external to use for Leopard and Vista	Im planning on buying a 1tb external to use between my vista system and my iMac running leopard 10.5.3. I will be using lots of file storage for the drive as well as doing video editing on my mac. So i will going between the two systems often. I plan on getting a drive with multi functionality so i can use eSata with my pc and firewire 400 on my imac. What is the best way to format drive for full use and or compatibility on both os. Any suggestions?

We see far too many people here putting things on an external hard disk and losing all (or having to pay for recovery) when it breaks down, because they forget making a backup and trust the drive will live forever. Which it doesn't. So, if you've got 1 Tb of data, it makes sense to have another 1 Tb somewhere for your backup. That's 40 BlueRay DVD's or a professional tape drive with tapes or a second hard disk.
