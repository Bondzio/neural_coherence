Hello, My burner model is TSSTcorp CD/DVDW TS-L532A The computer is a Gateway 7510GX running Windows XP Home. It burns CD-R/RW, DVD+-RW and DVD+DL However, as of late, I can only burn DVD discs, and not CD's, which lock up the burning software. I've tried burning with Nero, CD Burner XP Pro, and Alcohol, all of which can burn DVD's fine but (now) not CD's, and I have burned CD's before. The burn process starts, the light comes on and the drive spins, then after a minute or so the drive spins down and the software hangs (with Nero). With CD Burner XP Pro/Alcohol an error message is spitted out (below). I tried reinstalling the burner with no luck. The error message listed by CD Burner XP Pro is: Writing Error: (3) Error occurred writing data to the disc. The SCSI/ATAPI bus was reset and caused a write failure (1026). Error Sense Data: SENSE KEY: 6 ASC: 29 ASCQ: 0 if that helps. If you have any suggestions I appreciate it, thanks!

For years I have recorded at 1/2 the media speed. It takes not so much longer and I have none of the problems of people around me. I wonder... Bob

My TS-L632D will burn dvd's without a problem, it will read dvd's without a problem, it will even read CD's without a problem. But when I burn a CD it burns like it should, it completes like it should, the light on the drive blinks like it should... but in the end... its just a blank CD... I heard a piece of advice, I should burn at a lower speed, this I will try, but is there any advice that can be given? other than that? if that doesn't work then how else can I fix it? also... if that does work, I don't want to burn at 2X from now on. Alternatively I had a super-multi drive kickin' around so I've got it on my IDE to USB adapter and burn from it, but that's not a perfect solution either
