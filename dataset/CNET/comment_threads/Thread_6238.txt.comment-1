I am having a problem with my peer to peer network, I am running windows xp home on both pc's with a cable modem connection, and I have had this network for about a year and it always worked fine until I reformatted both pc's harddrives and reinstalled windows on both.Now when I am online on one pc say using aol and sign onto aol on the other computer I lose my connection on the pc that the connection is shared on, and if for example I am playing an online game on the pc that is borrowing the connection, soon as the other pc starts surfing the net I lose my connection, and like I said before this was not a problem till I reinstalled windows on both pc's could there be a setting or something that was lost that I need to do again.
any help would b appreciated.
