I looked into some demos of partition software, but they all seem to do nothing, just let you look, and then ask you to buy the software. So is there a demo that will let me do this? Could i also do this myself? I'm running windows 98, what if i just adjust the virtual memory of the hard drive up to the max size of it, under the system properties performance advanced settings? Would that cause any problems, like wipe the hard drive?

I'll note a name but also that many crash their partition and data with such as RANISH (google.com) I can't offer any support for such dangerous items and if you lose it all on some freeware, I can't be help accountable.
