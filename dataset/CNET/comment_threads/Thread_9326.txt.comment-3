I scanned all my photos, videos, music, paperwork onto external hard drives.
I only use my pc hard drive for software.
I keep 3 external hard drives attached to the pc (photos/music, videos, paperwork).
Every couple of months I make complete copies of the three external hard drives, then swap the backup with the originals that now become the backups to be stored elsewhere.
A sneaky way of having a backup elsewhere for my photos is that once a year I copy all my photos onto a portable external hard drive and give it as a Christmas present to a family member.
I have saved all my old internal hard drives and have used them as backups, too.
In 10 years of using internal and/or external hard drives as backups I have never had a hard drive corrupt.
