My computer that I just finished building will only send a completely black signal to my monitor. After talking to one of my friends, we decided that the problem might be in that the monitor was screwed up, and wasn't working. So, I hooked it up to the monitor I'm using now, and nothing. Once I did that, we figured the problem might be in that its just not sending a signal at all. So, using the same method, I hooked it up to another monitor, and it doesn't give me the &quot;no signal&quot; message. If you're going to say that its only not giving me that because its plugged into a grounded outlet, you're wrong, this monitor has a problem in it that doesn't have it check from grounding, it only checks for a signal going into it. So, right now, we're all stumped, I'm hoping you can help me.

If you can then see any display, its your orginal video port or card is bad. With power off remove the just tested card, working or not, and find on the mtrbd. the CMOS clearing pins. Check your manual or online support website to locate them. Follow the instructions and just monetarily short them when applying power. This should cause the CMOS(bios) to return to default vales. See, if the orginal video port/card can now access a display. Of course if a card, make darn sure its fully seated. If can see a display, reboot to access the bios screen area. Verify the bios reflects it has choosen what is your proper video out source. If can see any display with orginal port/card things are working. If not, but with the old card, then that suggests the orginal port/card is bad. However, I have seen this problem if you don't install the latest video drivers and/or bios updates. Check to reseat the monitor cable, plus look at connector for no bent/pushed in, broken pins. Of course use a working monitor tested good elsewhere to eliminate that. good luck -----Willy

I'll try using the video card though, that may just work. I do have a SLIGHT suspicion of what it might be though. most of the parts I built this computer out of I got for free, and I believe that one of the computers I took parts out of may have had some unbelievably nasty virus, so bad it was inground onto the hardware. I'm not sure if any of that computer is in this one, but I do know that a 3.5&quot; floppy drive has its magnetic control removed, so any disk put in it is magnetically wiped... but only if its hooked up and on.
