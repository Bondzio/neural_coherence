that would be an excellent buy in my opinion from Futureshop is the HP 7170N Intel Pentium D 830 (3.0GHz).
It is the latest in computers.....Dual-Core Processors and also has 64-bit support (EM64T).
Has ATI Radeon X300SE PCI-Express video card which means it has the latest PCIe x16 slot for video card upgrade.
1GB RAM, 250GB 7200RPM hard drive, WinXp Media Center Edition OS, Remote Control with IR Receiver, DVD-ROM & Dual Layer 16x DVD+/-RW with Light Scribe Tech., and more for: $1499.99 CAD without monitor ($1244,45 USD) http://www.futureshop.ca/catalog/proddetail.asp?sku_id=0665000FS10062821&catid=10607 &logon=&langid=EN The other $400 CAD could go on a good monitor and cheap printer if you don't have one.
The 2nd system you have listed sells by HP Compaq in the U.S. for $579.99 before $50 rebate & without monitor, ($698.73 CAD)
