1.1.1	My Lacie D2 Quadra is lying on a flat surface, and has been working for a year or so.	St
1.1.2	It has begun to click repeatedly for about two clicks a second.	St
1.1.3	Along with the clicking, though, I can hear the disk whirring up and then slowing, and trying again and again.	St
1.1.4	It won't mount to OS X.	St
1.1.5	Now obviously this is quite a problem, but how can I solve it?	St
1.1.6	I will take it to a repair shop if I have to, but the shops around my area cost megamoney.	St
1.1.7	Please help.	St
1.2.1	The case failure is common and cheap to replace.	St
1.2.2	Good luck, Bob	St
