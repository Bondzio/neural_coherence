1.1.1	Hi A question for the forum I 've set up my network based on the recommendations of the salesman at the store .	St
1.1.2	He suggested that I go with the Lynksys WRT54GS with speedbooster .	St
1.1.3	My network is set up with 2 desktop computers and my sons X-box hardwired into the router , with another desktop and a laptop with wireless cards .	St
1.1.4	I do n't know enough about wireless technology ( wireless G , wireless N ) to know if there would be a difference in response time from the router to the individual devices .	St
1.1.5	My son occassionally complains about lag time with his X-box live , and I notice a huge difference between the desktop that is 3 feet from the router , and the other which is @ 80 feet away .	St
1.1.6	I would like to stay with Lynksys , as I find that this seems to work best in my neighborhood with my internet provider .	St
1.1.7	Any insight would be helpful .	St
1.1.8	Thanks Dennis	St
1.2.1	You can learn it or just accept the cheat sheet about this .	St
1.2.2	When ping , lag and such matters , get wired .	St
1.2.3	No wireless solution will assure you that it wo n't contribute to lag , ping times .	St
1.2.4	This is why you wire such a connection .	St
1.2.5	At 80 feet , the situation is not going to get any better .	St
1.2.6	You would NEVER consider wifi for this .	St
1.2.7	You might consider ethernet cable or powerline links .	St

1.3.1	My description was probably a little confusing .	St
1.3.2	The desktop that is 80 feet away , and the X-box are hardwired with cat5 ethernet cable , as well as the desktop that is 3 feet away .	St
1.3.3	The X-box is approximately 25 feet away from the router .	St
1.3.4	Will there be a difference in response time based on the different factors ?	Ques
1.3.5	( Distance , type of router , etc.. ) Thanks Dennis	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
