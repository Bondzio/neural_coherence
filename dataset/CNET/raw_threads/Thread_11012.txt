The signal strength is extremely poor. 50% after about 1 metre. Not visible after about 5-6 metres (direct line of sight). Have tried all standard fixes: Have updated to the latest firmware, factory reset and power cycled. There are no other wireless networks appliances or devices that would provide interference. Have experimented with channels, thresholds, transmit type, encrypted/open, intervals etc (every option available in standard firmware)..No luck. All software and drivers are up to date, and relocating the modem does not help. I've opened the router up and all the internal components look fine. No blown capacitors, scorching or breaks. I suspect the issue is thus due to the signal transmit strength being set low, however this is not something I can check using the standard firmware. The default transmit stringth is about 17MW +- 1.5 so if it's transmitting properly it should have a lot more range. Additionally WRT Custom firmware is not an option because the flash memory is only 2Mb. On the WRT54G, you can parse a linux kernel command through Ping to boost signal strength. The same command doesn't work on the WRT54GH however. I'd like to know where I can go from here. Cisco forums suggested I post on a 3rd party site which is what I'm doing now. I don't consider buying a new router to be a &quot;solution&quot;. Thanks for your help!

This sounds like a defective router. I would have guessed you could have gotten a router with the wrong country since some countries do not allow the same transmit power but when you have issues at 1 meter that's not it. Most routers that do not have replaceable antenna and are not trying to save power transmit at maximum signal levels and you normally cannot even think to change that. Most the time you load the custom firmware to REDUCE the power not increase it. In their quest to cut costs many new routers have dumbed everything down and only included the most basic features. It is unlikely there are any user accessible commands to change the radio. Many of these options if they exist can only be changed by solder in a jtag cable... assuming it has a jtag port in the first place. On a hardware side the only fixable thing would be if somehow the internal antenna was detached from the radio. Most these routers had a three year warranty but if you have taken it apart that may not be a option.

PCs, blackberries, iphones, laptops. The router is out of warranty so I can hack at it all I like. There's no Jtag port unfortunately. The antenna is a caltronics internal antenna, connected directly to the PCB. There doesn't appear to be any break in the circuitry between it and the radio.
