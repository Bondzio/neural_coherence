The previous respondent seems to be referring to a different Buffalo drive, possibly the one CNET recently reviewed?
We got the help we needed from Linksys after several back-and-forth emails.
Basically, Linksys walked us through logging in to the router's setup page online (type in the router's IP address in a browser's address bar) and how to locate the attached drives' IP addresses (go to the Status page and click on the &quot;Local Network&quot; tab, then click on &quot;DHCP Client Table&quot; at the bottom).
If there is more than one IP address in addition to the router's, which Linksys provides, first ping the IP address from a command prompt, and then type in the IP address in a browser address bar.
You should get a login screen for the device in question.
We are now waiting for Buffalo to help us with their product.
If and when we hear from them, we will post the information here.
