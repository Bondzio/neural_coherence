<s> I recently did a fresh install of Windows XP Pro and threw in SP3. </s>
<s> When I go to update drivers for my 8800GTX, my resolution and color drops from 1400x1050 - 32 bit down to 800x600 - 4 bit. </s>
<s> I tried to increase the settings but it drops the setting back down on its own. </s>
<s> I had to do a rollback to the previous drivers to fix the problem. </s>
<s> Is it the SP3 thats causing the issue or something else? </s>
<s> The previous drivers that I'm on right now came with the gfx card, which is 2+ years old and cant play any games with outdated drivers. </s>
<s> I'm thinking about just going back to SP2. </s>
<s> Thanks in advance. </s>
<s> delete your display adapters in device manager before doing the install. </s>
<s> after rebooting, do not allow windows to reinstall the drivers. </s>
<s> then install the latest nvidia drivers -- that should fix what ails you. </s>
<s> OMG, there really IS a Holy Cow. </s>
<s> IT WORKED! </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> Can you explained to me what happened? </s>
<s> All of my previous Driver updates, I'd just click to update without having to do what you told me. </s>
<s> Is it just a new procedure that I have to go through with SP3? </s>
<s> who knows. </s>
<s> but if a device has become misconfigured, the driver installation should be replaced, not updated. </s>
<s> deleting the device and preventing windows from reinstalling it usually lets you do a clean driver instation, rather than updating the existing driver (which is misconfigured). </s>
