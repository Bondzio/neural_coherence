1.1.1	Has anyone bought a PC from a company named Digital Storm?	St
1.1.2	If yes - I would like to know if the PC turned out to be a good one or a lemon because I'm interested in buying one from them but would like to know if other people have had positive experiences or not.	St

1.2.3	Although you can get better pricing and a great deal more in part selection with AVA Direct their quality has seemed to slip from recent reviews even though their reseller rating is high their Better Buisness Bureau rating is a B- and for a 6500 dollar investment I want nothing less then the best by the best.	St
1.2.4	Digital Storm have a A+ rating at the BBB websight only Falcon Northwest comes close with a solid A. I would say these 3 companies offer the most quality and customization although you could go Intel's websight and they give you a list of other manufacturers that carry their chipset such as Velocity Micro, Biohazard, Cyberpower, I Buy Power, and many other custom dealers but as I said Digital Storm is way ahead of the pack from my research.	St
1.2.5	They have an entire forum for their customers that you can go to from their websight and it is not just a love fest it has people hanging out offering opinions on builds and just chatting.	St
1.2.6	I mean seriously how many people drop 4-10k on a computer?	St
1.2.7	So it's a nice bonus to find people with similar interests and get their opinions.	St
1.2.8	Another thing I noticed is every time you talk to someone on the phone you get an e-mail that has a link to management asking if the employee in question helped you effectively and giving a synopsis of the converstion and everyone I delt with was very polite and helpful.	St
1.2.9	I gotta say although you can get a cheaper product elsewhere the customer service and guarantee of quality and peace of mind are worth the extra cash to me.	St
1.3.1	For any future users, do not rely on the BBB to determine if a company is a good company.	St
1.3.2	Check out all the companies Acid posted and notice how they're ALL A+.	St
1.3.3	CyberPower used to be around C- about this time ago, and in two short years have managed to increase to it an A+.	St
1.3.4	I find this highly unlikely, as the number of complaints that come up about the company have only been increasing, and as to the suggestion of Digital Storm.	St
1.3.5	While Digital Storm does build quality computer, their prices have only been increasing with their popularity.	St
1.3.6	There are cheaper solutions that offer the same quality as Digital Storm.	St
1.3.7	I mean Digital Storm doesn't do anything special that any other company can't do, it's just a matter of how much time and care is put into each computer.	St
1.3.8	Check out Ironside Computers to see what I mean.	St
1.3.9	They offer good quality products and realistic prices, While they're definitely not as popular as Digital Storm, their quality is, at least in my opinion, on par with them.	St
1.3.10	At least from my own experience and what I've seen from their youtube videos, their quality seems to be relatively consistent.	St
1.3.11	The point of what I'm trying to say is, just because a computer is more money, it doesn't always necessarily mean it's better quality.	St
1.3.12	Keep in mind that Digital Storm does not manufacture their own parts, they use the same parts Ironside does.	St
