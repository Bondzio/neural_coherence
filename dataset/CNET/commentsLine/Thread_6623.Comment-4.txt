1. check your mobo website for newer bios versions which may have addressed any previous issues with ide/sata.
2. try not to mess with default hard disk parms when configuring bios.
3. ensure you install the correct mobo sata driver (ide emul, achi or raid).
4. finally for your own peace of mind: &gt; avoid installing apps to any drive other than c:\ &gt; never install apps to a drive you store precious data &gt; never use local storage containing irreplaceable programs/data as a source for program installation (install failure may cause whole source drive to be erased)
