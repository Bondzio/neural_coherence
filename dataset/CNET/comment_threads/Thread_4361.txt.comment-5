Going to a gigabit switch which is 10/100/1000 will NOT help your internet gameplay.
You connection from your ISP doesnt even come close to maxing out the 10/100 card your using.
At the most your ISP is likely putting out 10mbps, and your ethernet card can handle 100mbps.
Going to a gigabit switch will only help transfering files from PC to PC, not the internet speeds.
Hope this helps.
