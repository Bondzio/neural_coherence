...That I am not planning to use it immediately anyways...
Since it only has ethernet connection on it and since I have more than one computer now, I will just get high speed interent before I finish setting it up...
Right now I am searching for websites for heatsink repair that has clips and thermal paste...do you know of any to recommend?
?
