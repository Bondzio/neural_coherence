i received a holiday catalog in the mail from hp shopping.com yesterday and in their catalog's printer section were featured two; (2) new all in one printers; an hp photosmart 3210 and an hp photosmart 3310. the hp photosmart 3310 features both fax as well as wireless capabilities; it also retails for $100.00 more than the hp photosmart 3210 which lacks both of those features.
does anyone who participates in this forum own either printer and if so; what can you say either one of them?
good or bad?
if anyone also owns an hp 2610 all in one machine would you rate the hp 3210 or the hp 3310 to be as good as or better than the hp 2610?
feedback from anyone would certainly be appreciated.
