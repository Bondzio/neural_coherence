Also, sometimes ripping/reading certain discs causes BSOD. iTunes error is as follows. I found a lot of similar error with number 4280 and others, while I never found any troubleshooting on the Apple site for this error (#4300).

However, buying a lens cleaner would be another $15 or so, the drive cost $20 so I'm not too sure about that. I was hoping for a reply similar to the way in which other errors are fixed. A simple search for the unknown error (4280) gives a step-by-step solution that has to do with the settings of the drive.
