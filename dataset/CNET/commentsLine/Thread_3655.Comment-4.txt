if you want to be truly confused, look at the ghz of the centrino and (non-ht) p4s.
for rough comparisons, the centrino at 1/2 the clock speed is as fast as the p4 at it's speed.
see if you can find benchmarks on this.
but for games, 2+ghz of any cpu and 1+ghz centrino is usually more than ample.
the real bottlenecks are the video card and possibly the hard disk.
