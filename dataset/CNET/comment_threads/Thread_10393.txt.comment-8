OK, there was not a firmware update for the router, but there was a driver update for the laptop.
However this did not fix my problem.
I changed channels and that also didn't work.
So, I decided to turn off security and set a MAC filter.
Guess What?
That fixed the problem!
I am not sure if this is the best solution or why the security was slowing me down so much, but everything is working fine now.
