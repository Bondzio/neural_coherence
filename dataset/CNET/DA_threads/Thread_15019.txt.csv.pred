1.1.1	Hello , Can the recycle bin be moved to another drive to free up space on the C drive ?	Ques
1.1.2	I use XP .	St
1.2.1	Each disk has it 's own recycle bin that is set up automatically .	St
1.2.2	To regain space on your C drive , run CleanDisk frequently , emptying the recycle bin each time .	St
1.2.3	Since you must have another drive ( else you would not have asked about moving the Recycle Bin there ) , you should move more of your files to that drive .	St
1.2.4	Actually , there are several reasons why it is best to have your OS , programs , and other seldom-changed files on the C drive and have your My Documents folder ( s ) and other data folders on another drive .	St
1.2.5	Hope this helps Frank	St
