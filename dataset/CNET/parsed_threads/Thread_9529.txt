<s> I recently overclocked an AMD X4 965 way to much and fried it. </s>
<s> So, I bought another one and it is sitting here next to me. </s>
<s> What I need to know is, When I put the new CPU in, will the previous CPU's overclocked settings be active? </s>
<s> I would think not, because I'd just end up frying another CPU. </s>
<s> I just want to be 100% sure before I lose another $180. </s>
<s> Thanks -JRed13 </s>
<s> or go directly into your bios and choose &quot;factory default&quot; or &quot;fail-safe&quot; settings. </s>
<s> refer to your mobo manual for instructions on how to do either. </s>
<s> I *assume* when you OC'ed you used the bios area to do so. </s>
<s> if that's the case or any other OC'ing method which addresses the bios, then those setting are still in place, unless you cleared them by &quot;resetting&quot; the bios. </s>
<s> You can also remove the CMOS battery besides the clearing pins. </s>
<s> Thus, use either method to reset the bios to return to defaults. </s>
<s> You will still have to reset or set the setting you require for a typical setup. </s>
<s> You can then OC, using new setting below what caused your previous problem. </s>
<s> Now, understand when you OC, you also push the cpu into the areas of a higher demanding cooling setup. </s>
<s> thus address that to better handle the heat stress the cpu will be under. </s>
<s> The stock or typical HSF won't handle well once you exceed its limits. </s>
<s> Replace with a better cooling setup in order to keep within tolerances. </s>
<s> Also, the whole cooling process MUST be capable of handling the entire desktop airflow, so prepare to maintain the proper tolerance levels. </s>
<s> good luck tada -----Willy </s>
