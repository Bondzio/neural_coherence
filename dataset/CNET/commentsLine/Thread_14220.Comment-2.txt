you'll need to first purchase a video card that has a dvi output.
(you should check first to make sure that you don't already have this, but i'm pretty sure the dimension 4700 does not.
it would be a white port, not the usual blue one.)
you can purchase any pcie (pci express) video gard with dvi output, which most cards have.
you can get a nvidia 7300gt for under $100 from retailers like zipzoomfly.com.
just pop that into your pcie port on the motherboard and you're ready for the next step, which is to purchase a dvi to hdmi cable.
it's a simple cable with dvi on one end, and hdmi on the other.
just plug the dvi into your video card port, and the hdmi into your tv, and viola, you're ready to go.
just google dvi to hdmi if you need help finding a cable.
