i have had the same problem w/ my E521 ever since i got it.
however, when i got mine, i immediately did a clean install of XP Pro SP2.
so it has none of dell's preinstalled software or vista.
there is a link on dell's support site that makes reference to a BIOS issue w/ the E521.
that may be helpful.
