1.1.2	The network is peer to peer and all PCs are running Windows XP pro .	St
1.1.3	Each PC is also running Zone Alarm with antivirus , with the network in the trusted zone .	St
1.1.4	For some reason , the router is very picky about internet access .	St
1.1.5	I can get though to google and yahoo and almost no other sites , either using a browser or pinging .	St
1.1.6	Other than installing a password for access I have not tried any fancy security settings on the router firewall .	St
1.1.7	Any suggestions on how to access the rest of the internet ?	Ques
1.2.1	What Linksys router model ?	Ques
