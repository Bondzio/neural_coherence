the sempron 3100 is a fine processor, but no match for the athlon 64, 3300. like you indicate in its current form, it lacks the 64-bit support/instruction set.
its processor speed is 1.8 ghz as compared to 2.4 ghz of the 64/3300 and only has 256kb of l2 cache as compared to the athlon 64's 512kb l2 cache, so its yield will be higher.
tomshardware in their review of the sempron 3100 stated: &quot;with audio and video encoding the sempron falls only slightly behind the dual-channel memory-equipped athlon 64 3000+ running at the same clock speed.&quot; (note comparing it to the athlon 64 3000).
the computer at circuit city also has, &quot;160gig hd 512 megs ram 17&quot; crt speakers cdburner dvd player usb 2 / firewire kb and mouse xp home...&quot; i consider it a better buy because of: a more powerful processor & with the &quot;64&quot; support structure.
has a double layer dvd+/-r/rw burner with cd writer capabilities.
has a printer.
all for $50 more than the one at sam's.
