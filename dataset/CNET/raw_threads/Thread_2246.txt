It says RJ-45 Network Port Connects to Any 10/100Mbps Hub or Switch or ethernet networking device. Its not specific saying you can connect the cable directly to the modem. Can you? Do I really have to get a hub too?

Would have had to reset each time I used the other computer, so I went out an got a Router today and I'm all set. Got the dinaosaur and my newer one all hooked up.
