I had this problem.
My research leads me to believe it is a common problem take a look at this link: http://www.dataclinic.co.uk/maxtor-hard-disk-recovery.htm I rang these guys and they told me it is normally one of 2 things, if it is clicking or making a 'musical' tone it is mechanical fault, if it is quiet then it is most likely a firmware fault.
No cheap way of fixing them unfortunately!!
I don't know what firmware is exctly in relation to a hard disk drive but there you go!
