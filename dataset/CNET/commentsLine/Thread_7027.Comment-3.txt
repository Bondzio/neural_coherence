she says her friend who is into graphics, told her it would be better with the acer driver.
when she's on her home page, it is too small.
i think that could be corrected.
we were able to download a driver but can't install it or open it.
there are five icons and none of them seem to be for installation.
i'm thoroughly confused by this.
thanks for getting back to me.
