1.1.3	Not sure if this is the best place to ask this questions but here goes.	St
1.1.4	I have two DirecTV HD DRV HR24's.	St
1.1.5	I have a DSL Modem, a Wireless Router, Desktop, laptops, etc.	St
1.1.6	I have one of the HR24's hardwired to the Wireless Router.	St
1.1.7	The other HR-24 is in a different location and cannot be hardwired.	St
1.1.8	How can I make it part of a home network/DirecTV home network?	St
1.1.9	I have a second older Wireless Router not currently used.	St
1.1.10	Can I use that...maybe configure it as a wireless access point?	St
1.1.11	I configured it per the Belkin Router website and connected the second router via Ethernet to the second HR-24.	St
1.1.12	This HR-24 said it was connected via ethernet to the Router but that I had no internet access.Anyone know if I configure this second Wireless Router as an Access Point, can I plug something like an HR24 into it and get internet access to the HR24 so I can do &quot;on-demand&quot; and also DirecTV home connect?	St
1.1.13	Last, I also have a game console that I would like to have access the internet.	St
