1.1.1	hi, i am moving and i have HP 6122 printer-- the thing jutting out the back comes off so the rest can fit in the original packing styro, but now I don't know where this rear mechanism goes-- doesn't seem to fit anywhere.	St
1.1.2	I seem to recall this was an add-on to allow double sided printing -- do i just need to find its own box?	St
1.1.3	thanks - fj	Polite
1.2.1	NIL	St
1.3.1	Mine just sat on top it was the first thing out of the box	St
