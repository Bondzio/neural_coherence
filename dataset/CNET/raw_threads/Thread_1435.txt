I am currently visiting friends out of state and I am trying to connect to their wireless network. It is security protected butI got thier network key and was able to connect, unfortunately even though I am about 10 feet away from the router it says limited or no connectivity and as such will not connect to the internet. I have tried pinging and it seems to be ok. I have tried to run the wireless connection repair feature through the Wireless Network Connections Windows thing. Any other suggestions?
