1.1.2	I narrowed it down because i tried some overly extensive programs , on my other drives .	St
1.1.3	Nothing .	St
1.1.4	All good , on my D drive my computer completely froze when i tried anything , then it took two reboots to get back up .	St
1.1.5	Also I am hearing some whirring then a sound of brakes screaming or an engine build up then CLUNK CLUNK .	St
1.1.6	Now it 's dead silent but still recognized and files are readable albeit anything run freezes my computer on D drive .	St
1.1.7	I 'm pretty much certain it 's a soon to be dead drive .	St

1.2.1	If yes ... try the HDD mfgs DIAGs ... .download and run their diagnostic SW. VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	I have tried the tool , and computer rebooted again .	St
1.3.2	I ripped and encoded one of my dvd 's on another drive , no problems , encoded , again no problems , but a simple cut and paste of a file originating on my D : \ drive to another disk produced another hard reboot .	St
