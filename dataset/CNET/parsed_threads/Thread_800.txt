<s> or where can i find the driver for my combo drive.i need to use it urgently.thanks p/s: i asked a guy about it.he said it might be cause by Starforce protection ( this game software protection) or any similar protection.but he doesnt know how to fix it. </s>
<s> Look up REMOVE UPPERFILTERS LOWERFILTERS on google.com and you'll find the usual XP fix. </s>
<s> But I don't know if that's the OS in use. </s>
<s> Also, be sure to try another drive since they die often. </s>
