I did a fresh windows 7 installation on one of my PCs on the network.
The problem now is I cannot ping that computer from any other computer on the network.
I can ping the gateway and other computers from that specific computer, but not vice versa.
The PC s ip address is 10.5.3.100 If I ping it from another machine it says reply from 10.5.3.108 Destination host unreachable I have noticed that it is even replying from a different ip address Help
