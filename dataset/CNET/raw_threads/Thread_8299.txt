It make a humming sound most of the time, but then other times it can be so noisy you can hear it from downstairs. How can I make it silent, or at least close to. I have an Asus P5GD1 motherboard (intel P4 HT with 3.2GHz), 1GB of DDR RAM, 200 GB S-ATA 7200rpm 8MB Hard Drive,ATX Med Tower Case with 400W power, LiteOn 16X Double Layer DVD +/- RW, Asus PCI Exp Powered by ATI X300 w/126MB, and im running Windows XP Home Edition. Thanks for your help.

The cpu fan is really quiet, so I'm assuming it is coming from the case. Lets say it is the cpu fan or the case fan or both you do have the option of using watercooling devices this site has a good how to about purchasing and installing a watercooling device if that is not your cup of tea then i would get something in between an internal liquid fan. You might want to check the section about watercooling and check it out. I was thinking about doing it myself but I don't have the guts to do it myself.

That alone willl wear a fan down and cause the bearing and blades to be too noisy. The only true cure is to replace. Open side cover or system casea and find any fans causing problems and replace. -OR- find tyhe noise source and proceed from there. Buy a &quot;quality&quot; fan and install them. Google for fan sources, plus make sure your power supply hasn't goner bonkers as well, it's not readily seen so check it too. tada -----Willy

They specialize in silent air cooling for your PC. If you felt comfortable doing so you could also go the watercooling route, but that would be much more expensive and require a pretty high comfort level on your part, tinkering with the insides of your computer. So in short: for the novice to intermediate computer builder I'd suggest Zalman air cooling, for advanced users with more cash to spend then go watercooling
