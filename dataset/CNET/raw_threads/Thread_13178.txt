It is the highest quality memory you can get at real good prices and free shipping, as well as a lifetime warranty. If your Front side bus tops out at 333mhz then don't buy PC3200 memory, it's overkill and will run no faster than the PC2700 memory required for that speed bus. It does no good to buy faster memory than your system can support, it will run not faster, it will just run at the highest speed the motherboard/chipset/processor will support. If you think you are buying it for your next system, realize that the memory requirements change very year or so and even PC3200 will not be fast enough for the next generation of processors. Getting more than 512meg if memory is extremely unlikely to make any noticeable difference at all. Even between 256meg and 512meg there is little difference in performance, but above 512meg you just don't see it at all.
