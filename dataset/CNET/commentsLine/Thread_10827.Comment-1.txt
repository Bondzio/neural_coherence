i am looking for a 2.1 system and i like the klipsch promedia 2.1. now my question is has anybody ever hooked up bookshelf spreakers or any other speakers to this system?
if so, how did it sound?
i have two jbl62 speakers laying around that have a 6&quot; woofer and a 1&quot; tweeter and probably are better than the klipsch satellites.
how well would this work?
