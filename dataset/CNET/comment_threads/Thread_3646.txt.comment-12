I did use a reputable seller one I have been using over a decade.
Built three computers from buying parts I bought from them.
I do not chose to use their name.
They have refunded my money back into my account.
I am not happy off what happened, and hope it does not happen again to me or some one else.
To everybody just be carefull when you buy parts or anything online.
Thank You For Your Help: Wendell
