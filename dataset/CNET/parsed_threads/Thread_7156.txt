<s> I have one of the above printers. </s>
<s> The Scanner has failed. </s>
<s> On opening up it was obvious that one end of the connecting wire to the slim flourescent light tube has broken off. </s>
<s> The local Epson Agents refuse to supply me with a spare and instead want the price I can buy a new printer, to do what they call a repair job. </s>
<s> Anyone know where I can source a new light at a reasonable cost? </s>
<s> The issue here is simple. </s>
<s> Stocking spare parts, issuing manuals and giving (free) support costs more than a new unit. </s>
<s> Some revolt against this but there is a second hand parts market on ebay for those that want to try replacing a part. </s>
<s> Do not bother asking the makers for parts on printers under a few hundred bucks. </s>
<s> You'll waste your time. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> If you look on Ebay you can find most parts for any printer out there in the form of that same printer. </s>
<s> Just make sure to ask the seller if the part you need is working. </s>
