You are looking at Opterons and Xeons.
The P4 is not a dual CPU design.
HOWEVER, the HT version of the P4 does show dual CPUs in Windows NT, 2000, XP and Linux.
And does pretty darn good in transcoding sessions at a good price compared to dual CPU Opteron/Xeon based computers.
Today, I'd get a 3+GHz P4 with 800MHz FSB, later this year a dual core Athlon 64.
