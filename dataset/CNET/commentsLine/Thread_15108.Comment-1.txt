i have a dell dimension 9100. i want to buy ati radeon 1900 xtx 512mb but when i went to compusa, they said that my power supply might be too little for the card (375w) and so recomended me to get 500w.
i got a 500 watt atx power supply.
however, the thing does not fit... dell doesn't use standard power supply.
so, i have two questions: 1) do i really need to upgrade my power supply for radeon 1900?
2) where can i get a well priced 500 w power supply for dell computers in case i do need to upgrade my power supply.
thanks for any help!
