(i have very little left anyway . thank you in advance for your attention and consideration. --submitted by robert f. here are some featured member answers to get you started, but please read through all the member advice and suggestions within the discussion thread. roll back the driver --submitted by gr8tdane_10  video card performance deteriorated... --submitted by brechan  likely software problem --submitted by glen271  one word - sapphire... --submitted by darrenforster99  more info required --submitted by sound-byte  stab in the dark --submitted by flatworm  a few suggestions --submitted by warpete  read all member contributions to this topic  thanks to all who contributed! if you have any advice or recommendation for robert, please click on the reply link below and post it. please be as detailed as possible when providing a solution. thanks!
