zip 100 usb with win xp for some reason one of my zip disks refuses to be recognised by windows explorer.
it comes up insert disk or protected.
right clicking on any of my zip disks, will not give me the protect/unprotect option.
i have downloaded the latest software from iomega but no difference.
could this be a dodgy disk ?
when i right click this disk and look at properties it says 0 bytes and a file system of raw.
any sugestions on recovering this disk.
