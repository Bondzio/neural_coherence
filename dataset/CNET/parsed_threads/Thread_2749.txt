<s> I found a PC and I was trying to find info (specifications) on the motherboard but I dont seem to find any...So can someone try and help please...? </s>
<s> It has a type of chip that has a VIA logo with the characters: VT82C686B . </s>
<s> I tried google-ing this up but no luck... Any more info you might need to try and figure the specs out just let me know. </s>
<s> If it runs a newer Windows operating system, try running CPU-Z or BELARC ADVISOR. </s>
<s> If you can boot to system BIOS, the model number may be there. </s>
<s> Otherwise, you need to search the motherboard for something stamped/printed on it. </s>
<s> It won't be on a chip; it will be on the main board that holds all the chips and slots. </s>
<s> It's usually a little bigger than the other writing on the board. </s>
<s> so will SIW, Everest Home V2.20, AIDA32, etc.,.. </s>
<s> Also check for the MB Revision number as that often distinguishes which production version of the board you have and which BIOS and drivers it requires. </s>
<s> VAPCMD </s>
