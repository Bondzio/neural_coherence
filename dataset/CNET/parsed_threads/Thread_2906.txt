<s> Bios setting con be tweaked for some benefit. </s>
<s> Also, changed to better what is connected and/or allow some speed improvements. </s>

<s> Provided your mtrbd. </s>
<s> is easily bios friendly, take each change one step at a time or deemed prudent, DON&quot;T go hogwild. </s>
<s> Experiment if you like, just be aware if it hangs or freezes too often the bios change is to great or incompatible for that level, return to safer levels. </s>

<s> I might try overclocking sometime later, but for now would stock setting be fine? </s>
<s> Are they potentially harmful to my components other then the fact I'm not getting all the speed I could be getting? </s>
<s> Stock or default setting will do fine. </s>
<s> Like I mentioned, if you experiment, just find a stable and sustainable level that everything seems to work, OK. Stock setting are also called the &quot;default&quot; setting, though you may need to tweak abit for some device if required and that becomes your &quot;norm&quot;. </s>
<s> Don't get to caught-up in bios setting, they are pretty straight-forward and make sense once you get in under your belt. </s>
<s> Your manual or download one from the system or mtrbd. </s>
