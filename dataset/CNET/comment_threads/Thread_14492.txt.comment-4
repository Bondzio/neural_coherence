hey thanks man, i called up the DISH support and they could not help me with this.
cause i was thinking since the DISh in goes into the receiver and the out goes into the TV (which is the same connector on the tv tuner card) i figured it should work.
about the quality, will the &quot;Hauppauge WinTV-D Digital TV Tuner Card&quot; also give lousy quality?
thanks.
