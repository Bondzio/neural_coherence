I am not referring to the Asus X202E model but rather the Asus UX32A and S400CA models.
But thank you Bob, for your input on battery.
I am going to assume therefore that all batteries with most laptops function this way... Is there anyone who can answer three simple questions - 1) Might the UX32A be damaged easily?
2) Which is better for power - the UX32A or the S400CA?
3) Which is better for programming - the UX32A or the S400CA?
