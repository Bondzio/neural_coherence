my gateway 510xl recently got the dreaded bsod and after taking it to be repaired, i was told the os was corrupted and would be too costly to repair.
i would have to pay $199 for the diagnostics and since pre-made pc's only come with a restore disk, i would also have to buy a new copy of an os.
what i would like to do is take out the hard drive out of the gateway system and piggyback it into the dell desktop pc i have.
what i'd like to know is this: 1. once i connect the gateway drive to the dell system, will it boot up with the dell os or will it try to boot up with the newly added hard drives os from the gateway system?
2. what are the chances of the reason(s) for the oc to be corrupted on the gateway os to cause the same problem with the dell system?
both pc's operating systems are windows xp.
any help i can get would be greatly appreciated.
