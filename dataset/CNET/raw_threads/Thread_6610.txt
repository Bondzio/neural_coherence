I formatted the drive using Disk Utility. I find that I can read from the drive fine. But whenever I try to save any large files into the drive, it stops copying after a while. The drive has a USB interface as well, and I can read/write from the drive just fine using the USB. But writes fail whenever I use the e-Sata interface. What can be the problem?

While I would have opted for a firewire interface on a Mac any day of the week, esata while promising is still on a shake down cruise. You didn't do anything wrong. Ask for your money back since I take it they didn't offer any support. Bob

Now, I don't think it's a problem with the hard drive since I've tested two external e-Sata drives and both show the same problem. Someone out there must have faced the same problem.

While these forums are good this one is still a new thing that isn't working out of the box for everyone. The only way to fix this is to return defective stuff. Bob
