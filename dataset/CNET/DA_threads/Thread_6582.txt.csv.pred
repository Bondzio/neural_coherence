1.1.1	hey guys need some help with organising a new computer system .	St
1.1.2	this is what I currently have ( am leasing ) Sony Vaio laptop , 2.66 P4 , 512Mb Ram , 60 gig HD with 250gig external drive , external sony dvd-800U burner , 15 & quot ; lcd screen in the laptop .	St
1.1.3	I got it 2 years and 3 months ago , and its served me so well , minus a hard drive crash .	St
1.1.4	I will buy this one once the lease expires , and keep it for when Im on the road .	St
1.1.5	The lease expires in November and I hope to get a new system then .	St
1.1.6	I want a high end system , willing to spend $ 3000 AUD and source a monitor ( looking at an apple 24 & quot ; cinema display ) .	St
1.1.7	Im a graphic designer and want a system that can also do video editing with ease .	St
1.1.8	I need to be able to run photoshop , indesign , illustrator and have multiple windows open without a problem .	St
1.1.9	something my current laptop is now having trouble doing ... can you guys recommend a system ?	Ques
1.2.1	I 'd wait until November to to get a good answer to this question .	St
1.2.2	The notebook recommendation given today will be useless because there will be newer components in the market by then ( mobile CPU 's , video adapters , motherboard chipsets , & quot ; Windows Vista-ready & quot ; components , etc . ) .	St
1.2.3	Do you wish to purchase something now ?	Ques
1.3.1	could use a memory boost ... they all LOVE RAM .	Sug
1.3.2	add a 1GB stick ( probably giving you 1.25GB ) and you should see the Vaio really perk up .	St
1.3.3	also , copy as many data/work files from your laptop HD to the external HD , defrag , and set a fixed page file of about 1GB .	St
1.3.4	then copy your stuff back to the laptop HD .	St
1.3.5	that could speed you up also .	St
1.4.1	Seems the desktop would be better suited to the task .	St
1.5.1	not looking to purchase now , as stated the lease runs out in november so looking to buy then .	St
1.5.2	Cant wait .	Sug
1.5.3	Checked out some macs today they look awesome .	St
1.5.4	adding 1gig ram sounds good , know how to defrag but whats this about chaging the page file ?	Ques
1.6.1	and you want to use it thereafter and beyond ... add more RAM ( say 1 GB ) now and enjoy it .	St
1.6.2	And if you CAN wait 'til January 07 for the new system ... you could get a dual core 64 bit CPU and Windows Vista..the MS 64 bit OS .	St
1.6.3	By then there 's a good chance Adobe will have a 64 bit ver of Photoshop too .	St
1.6.4	And you wo n't need to spend $ 3K to get a well configured , robust , high performance system unless you go to the bleeding edge with the latest and greatest .	St
