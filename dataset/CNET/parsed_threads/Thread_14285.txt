<s> I am thinking to buy a medai center PC for my living room, I have been looking around but not sure which one is good. </s>
<s> My brother told me that the latest processor of the AMD trinity A10 is very good deal, so I went search and find this one called ARCTIC MC101. </s>
<s> Does anyone know about this PC? </s>
<s> It looks very nice for my living room but I cant find any review about it yet and would like to have some comment by you guys, thanks, hope you can help! </s>
<s> Here's the website and youtube about the product I mentioed above: http://www.arctic.ac/en/p/living/entertainment-center/571/mc101-a10.html?c=2296 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjx4IFuma6M </s>
<s> Hey there, I have a media center PC myself and I enjoy it very much. </s>
<s> I never seen the MC101 before but it has a very good processor, The AMD Trinity A10 only came out mid-May and it sounds promising. </s>
<s> It doesnt have review yet poss. </s>
<s> coz this is too news, it's on pre-launch only... </s>
<s> Think is a good deal with these specs, I mean mine was more expensive with less RAM, storage and older processor than this one. </s>
<s> I would go for it, good luck! </s>
<s> I own an HP Media Center. </s>
<s> When I purchased it I was excited. </s>
<s> It had all the right bells and whistles, TV, radio, great Nvidia graphics card w/ an extra slot to add another graphics card for a dual monitor possibility. </s>
<s> I immediately created the diagnostic and restore disks as indicated by the manual (since they don't supply the restore disks any more with the purchased system). </s>
<s> I was elated. </s>
<s> Unfortunately my positive awe changed to wonder, amazement and bewilderment. </s>
<s> I noticed that the OS, at the time Vista Ultimate [Business] was the hottest thing; although the system is a Dual Core 64 bit system, there was a 32 bit Vista OS installed. </s>
<s> To correct this issue would have cost me almost $300 more. </s>
<s> But besides that after about 6 months the computer started indicating that the fan wasn't working. </s>
<s> But when the system case was opened up both fans were working. </s>
<s> Then suddenly the system began to reboot itself at the most inopportune times. </s>
<s> then finally it would reboot and then after rebooting it would reboot again in an endless loop of rebooting. </s>
<s> I tried researching the problem unsuccessfully. </s>
<s> I thought it could be a virus or something, so I thought about restoring to the factory default from the recovery disks (since the recovery section on the hard drive was then inaccessible.) </s>
<s> The first disk worked fine. </s>
<s> but when prompted to insert disk 2 the app refused to recognize the second disk. </s>
<s> I called HP for help but they had stopped supporting that computer model and that recovery disk was no longer available. </s>
<s> So, in conclusion, beware when buying from HP. </s>
<s> It is often the practice to stop supporting some systems. </s>
<s> It has happened several other times in the past as well with several HP printers that I have purchased. </s>
<s> As soon as there was a new OS available for some reason they stopped supporting that particular model and drivers were no longer available. </s>
<s> Sorry this turned out to be so long. </s>
<s> I just wanted to be fair and clear. </s>
<s> BEWARE! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Oh no, poor &lt;dvmarion&gt;, that is bad luck... </s>
<s> I heard that from many people don't get HP computers coz they are not good.... @serena_va - have you brought the MC101 you mentioned at the end? </s>
<s> I just brought one as well and I got the barebone version, so that I can add my own OS and storage. </s>
<s> The device works really well, the trinity doing it job well, is really fast and the graphic is brilliant, no problem with online games. </s>
<s> I got 2 TB HDD so that I can storage series and movies I downloaded from internet. </s>
<s> I like it very much so far, think is a good choice! </s>
<s> good luck to you.....n maybe not HP as &lt;dvmarion&gt; mentioned lol &lt;/dvmarion&gt;&lt;/dvmarion&gt; &lt;dvmarion&gt;&lt;dvmarion&gt; &lt;/dvmarion&gt;&lt;/dvmarion&gt; </s>
