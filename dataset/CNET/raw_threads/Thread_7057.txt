XP picks up the card and loads the drivers; however, at the end of the boot process the screen goes blank showing nothing but a curser (I do see my desktop for about 30 seconds). My monitor is plugged into a video port on the motherboard of a Dell. Are there jumpers on the motherboard or something else I need to adjust/fix my problem, and keep the screen from going blank when I plug my monitor into the video card? Asking the experts. Thanks.

That's a very old card, but your issue is typical for a clean XP install. Many learn that Microsoft does NOT supply drivers for MOTHERBOARDS, Video and Audio cards. All this is done by you, the installer. Happy hunting, Bob
