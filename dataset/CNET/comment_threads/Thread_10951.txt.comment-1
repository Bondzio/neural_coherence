I would like to find out if the USB ports on my Toshiba Satellite 5205-S503 can power a portable storage device such as the Lacie Porche mobile hard drive (80 GB 5400 rpm).
I looked in devices & found only the manufacturer (NEC) & the driver version (5.1.2600).
I'm it is US.
B 2.0.
Short of calling the manufacturer how do I find out?
Thank-you
