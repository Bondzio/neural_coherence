In the BIOS, USB Boot is enabled, but it does not show up as an option in the boot menu, all I have is CD, Hard drive, Network, and Floppy Drive. How can I get the USB to show up as an option? The USB works just fine on other computers. Any ideas? Thanks.

I don't really see how that could be a bug. The USB works fine on other models of Gateways. Any other ideas.

If all those E-models are reporting the same result, that suggests either it isn't supported or a bios update is required. the bios may not address the issue as Dell usually doesn't say what a bios update does. But, you should check the current bios level amongst the same Dell model. AND NO, this still not the same bios update on a different other models. It may not be a bug but the E-model doesn't support booting from a USB drive or you need to set it within the bios if applicable. An actual bug maybe involved and only Dell can address that, so check thier support forum or the Dell forum here for further help. tada ------Willy

There was a setting in another part of the BIOS (not under Boot) where I had to set it to emulate the USB as a hard drive. Once this was done it showed up in the boot menu.
