This is my configuration: without using range extender.
I have two wireless routers(WRT54GS).
One in the living room and one in the room at the back of my house.
I connected them together via cable.
I us one of them as a AP (access point) and the other one as a router connecting the DSL modem.
I get excellent connection every where in the house.
