1.4.1	I have read over the other messeges and things were just a little different .	St
1.4.2	My thought is that there should be a way to copy the driver and setting for the modem from the old disk to the new disk .	St
1.4.3	Is it possible to find these somewhere or is this a situation that I have to install a new driver and have it detect the modem .	St
1.4.4	It is strange that using the old disk the modem works fine but using the new disk it just does not work .	St

1.4.12	I have been changing the Master/slave jumpers to switch back and forth to boot from one disk or the other .	St
1.4.13	Using the old disk the correct modem shows up and shows it is on comm2 under device manager .	St
