For example, a DVD creation software created identical DVDs in 6 hours.
The clone of the machine with 1G ram (the other had 512MB) finished 5 minutes sooner.
For that, the extra 512MB was not paying off.
I would have expected better because the DVD image is... 4.7GB.
As to this machine lasting you years, you should buy what you need today since tomorrow we see dual-core 64-bit machines in just a month or two.
