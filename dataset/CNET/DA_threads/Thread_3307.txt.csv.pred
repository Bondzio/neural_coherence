1.1.1	I am having some issues with my Samsung HD 501 JK internal that came installed in my HP Pavillion a6500f .	St
1.1.2	I am very concerned that it is about to die .	St
1.1.3	After a little searching , I have read that even the replacements that Samsung sends out are junk .	St
1.1.4	Any suggestions on a different HD of similar size/speed to replace it with ?	Ques
1.2.1	Quite frankly there just is n't that many HD makers .	St
1.2.2	Off the top of my head , there is Seagate , WD , Samsung , Hitatci and Maxtor .	St
1.2.3	Seagate now owns Samsung a as well as Maxtor .	St
1.2.4	Any other label out there maybe a & quot ; rebadged & quot ; HD is different from those listed .	St
1.2.5	I have found Seagate to do well to include WD brands .	St
1.2.6	I xclude any ext .	St
1.2.7	mounted drives and any 2.5in .	St
1.2.8	as well also anything SSD based .	St
1.2.9	tada -- -- -Willy : I	St
1.3.1	i also had the same concern with my HP Pavillion a 6500f not too long ago , and i decided it was time to get a replacement for my HD .	St
1.3.2	i bought a Western Digital RE3 WD5002ABYS-01B1B0 from Here it has been working wonders for me !	St
1.3.3	its a similar spec as the Samsung , but personally think WD is more reliable than Samsung 's in the HD market .	St
