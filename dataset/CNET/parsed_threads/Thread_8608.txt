<s> I have an older Compaq and want to upgrade the video card . </s>
<s> Will the newer 4x or better cards be backwards compatible on the 2x board or will I be wasting power and not see much improvement? </s>

<s> I do such all the time. </s>
<s> The cards are &quot;keyed&quot; to keep you from plugging in an incompatible card. </s>
<s> Since no one knows what the old and new cards are, the result will be uncertain. </s>

<s> Old card is a 3dfx Voodoo 3 1000 16 mb 2x AGP. </s>
<s> New is still up in the air. </s>
<s> I am looking for 128 mb on the cheap. </s>
<s> Around $50. </s>
<s> I am way open to suggestions. </s>

<s> At even 50 bucks the fx5200's are aplenty. </s>
<s> http://www.compgeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=FX5500-128MTV&cat=VCD is a fx5500 for 59 bucks and my kid could play Far Cry at some settings with ease on his P4. </s>
<s> The fx5200 is ten bucks less all over, but I'd go one step up. </s>
