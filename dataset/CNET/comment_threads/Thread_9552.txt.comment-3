Thanks for the link!
Trust me I do check CNET before any tech purchase I make.
The thing is, that CNET hasn't done a router review in a while.
I'd really like to see a &quot;Router Throwdown&quot;.
Something that takes the newer or most popular routers on the market and puts them head to head.
Some of the routers in the &quot;Editor's Choice&quot; either don't exist anymore, or have been replaced by a new model or line.
I think an update would be nice.
Any other suggestions is still welcome!!
