<s> When your home desktop PC is not in use, what do you think is the best practice to ensure its longevity and why? </s>
<s> -- Put it in sleep/hibernate mode. </s>
<s> -- A complete shutdown. </s>
<s> -- It depends. </s>
<s> -- I have no idea. </s>
<s> Please tell us the reasons why below. </s>
<s> I am no pro by a long shot. </s>
<s> But I think it would just be the sensible thing to do to shut down during the night. </s>
<s> I run mine all day partly because I use System Mechanic for many things and it runs in the background or when I am away from the PC...it checks the registry, drivers etc.etc. </s>
<s> and I seldom have problems. </s>
<s> Also I don't open a lot of different programs at once only what I need for whatever I am working on at the time. </s>
<s> Norma V! </s>
<s> If you aren't going to use the computer for more than a couple of hours, I would shut it down. </s>
<s> The time saved by using the Hibernate function is minimal, and I'm sorry Microsoft, but hibernate has always had problems. </s>
<s> Sleep is a viable option for short durations, such as an hour or less, and/or if you need your computer to be up and running in a real hurry. </s>
<s> But powering it down and allowing Windows to reboot when you need it, will always save you money, hardware usage, and headaches. </s>
<s> If you are in a hurry to reboot Windows, try a Solid State Drive for your operating system and programs. </s>
<s> Mine boots faster from scratch than it ever did coming out of sleep mode with a regular Hard Disk Drive, and with fewer glitches. </s>
<s> That's just my experienced layman's opinion. </s>
<s> Hello Everyone Actually we should completely shutdown the system if we don't have to use it, for longer time. </s>
<s> because the hibernate option put effect on your memory i.e. </s>
<s> RAM because every system program has to be saved in the running mode. </s>
<s> This think on one side have advantage for memory also have one disadvantage for system which is we have to boot it when we want to use it. </s>
<s> On the other hand if you are not using system but for shorter time period we should hibernate because it will save the boot time of the system. </s>
<s> Overnight, computers at our house get shut down. </s>
<s> For a couple of hours, they are probably left on. </s>
<s> For a laptop or desktop not on a VPN, I would let it sleep. </s>
<s> However, if my desktop or laptop are connected to my work VPN (a pain to manually reconnect to), I would just leave them on, no sleeping or hibernating. </s>
<s> Then they'll stay connected to the VPN, although they might need to do an automatic reconnect depending on how long it's been. </s>
<s> So there's no one answer for me, whatever makes more sense given the situation is what I'll do *smile*. </s>
<s> But off overnight, definitely. </s>
