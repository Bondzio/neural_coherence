i have two usb ports on the front of a pc that i use for backups.
for no apparent reason they stopped working today.
i plugged my printer into the ports to verify if they work and they did work with the printer.
when i try to do a backup i get a message saying the port/drive does not exist.
i went into the device manager and those two usb ports don't show there either.
help...does anyone have any thoughts on what to do next?
