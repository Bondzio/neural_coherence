thus if you simply want to add the drive fine.
if you want to replace the drive that has the operating system, all of the compaq data et al on it.
[thus reinstall windows on a sata drive, i would suggest going up to the compaq [hp] website and ask, if you can make the restore cd [if you don't have one] and use that to install xp on the sata.
why don't you simply add the additional drive?
twill save a lot of trouble.
i hope that you are not going to say that the original is getting full.
