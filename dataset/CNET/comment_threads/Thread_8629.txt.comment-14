There are TWO hurdles to get support for such file systems.
1.
Microsoft Licensing and fees.
It's not cheap, and may not be easy.
2.
Microsoft has been pretty tip lipped about NTFS over the years.
Most of what was created in Linux was done via reverse engineering.
And while the other file systems do exist, if you used them on the TV the users would blow up at you for using them.
