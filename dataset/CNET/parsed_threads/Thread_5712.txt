<s> I have 2.8 GHZ computer using windows XP with a 80GB hard drive partioned into 15gb and 65gb. </s>
<s> My hard drive &quot;C&quot;(15 GB drive) is full and I have multiple error messages. </s>
<s> What would be the best way to restore the computer to it's original state(like out the box). </s>
<s> Would you recommend a system restore or would you recommend reformatting and reloading the disc. </s>
<s> Can you give me detailed instructions on reformatting and reloading the OS. </s>
<s> Thanks for your help. </s>
<s> what error messages are you receiving? </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> Run DISK CLEANUP. </s>
<s> (on C:) 2. </s>
<s> Now disable System Restore (how is in Start, Help...) then re-enable. </s>
<s> You should see the low disk space warning stop. </s>

<s> Reformat -- You would only reformat if you want a larger partion (bigger then 15gb). </s>
<s> and really you could do this with out formating. </s>
<s> restore--? </s>
<s> How old is your computer? </s>
<s> I don't think there is a way in windows to restore it to the orginal setting? </s>
<s> Reload-- Reload is the best bet if you want to start over. </s>
<s> You well loose everything on your C drive. </s>
<s> But most people do this to keep windows running smooth. </s>
<s> But your problem seems to be size. </s>
<s> I had an 80gb hard drive that was split with 20 and 60 gb. </s>
<s> I was running out of space (tried to do video editing). </s>
<s> finally I bought a 320 gb hard drive for like $80 (at the time) and re-partitioned my 80 gb. </s>
<s> I lost everthing on my D drive (the 60gb) (moved what I could over to the 320) and now I run fine until my next build. </s>
<s> I still kept all my windows settings. </s>
