hello, we have been recording (voice and music) on 90 mins tape for the last 12 years.
i am looking to create a digital library (covert all those tapes on mp3).
i am wondering on wich support to keep that library.
one hard drive a year and a copy on another location.
copy the mp3 on a dvd.
copy the mp3 on dss (dat) tape.
what is the life expentency of each support.
my first idea was to store on hard drive but last week i dropped one of mine in its external casing and the drive broke (i had almost had everything on backup but i lost a month of recording).
so now i am unsure how i should procede.
