<s> Hi, I'm totally new to wireless networking so please bear with me. </s>
<s> I installed a SMC Barricade wireless router, with an Epson Stylus Photo 870 hooked up using a USB cable plugged directly into the router. </s>
<s> I followed the instruction manual on how to set up a print server, but it keeps on saying on the router setup page that the printer is not ready. </s>
<s> I also installed both the Epson and the SMC Barricade print drivers. </s>
<s> Please help!! </s>
