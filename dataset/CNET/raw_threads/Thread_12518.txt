The monitor went dark, smelled that characteristic toasted hardware smell coming from location near the power button (top, middle area) and soon after shut itself down. When I reboot, the screen lights up and after it boots fully the screen goes dark and it shuts down again after a few minutes. What could be the issue?

You'll need to take it to a shop for a diagnosis and estimate. Since you said it's an older Dell, I'd say consider it gone. You may still be able to remove the hard drive, put that in an external enclosure and retrieve you data.
