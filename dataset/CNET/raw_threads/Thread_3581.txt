I hope someone will be able to help me fix my problem... I have a COMPAQ 2100 Notebook. Recently, I installed a D-Link wireless card [AirPlus.G DWL-G630] and it was working fine. One day, I decided to see how will the connection work outside my appartment; at school. Well, as soon as I inserted the D-Link card, a msg popped up saying smt about Windows, I cannot recall exactly what and seconds later the screen went blue with a long message about a recently installed drive etc. So, as I later found out, I had to go to the D-Link website and install the last version of the drive. [BTW, when I came back home I had no problems with the comp.!] I installed it and everything was fine even outside my building. About 10 days later, I started having problems at home. Very slow response to action, frozen screen with the mouse moving but unable to click and finally the blue screen thing AGAIN! I read online about someone having the same problem and installed updates for my COMPAQ 2100. Nothing changed. Today, I finally decided to remove D-Link and couple other things. I ran the Registry Mechanic, Hijackthis, Ad-ware and stuff like that, even Clean up. I kept having the same problem. After the blue screen the computer reboots and can never fully reload. It either stops at a certain point frozen or when I try to press F8 it wouldn't respond and continue until some point. I also tried to run the Safe Mode but it wouldn't do it. The Last Good Version thing did not work... I just turn it off, let it cool down and try again. It starts running fine until a certain point when it grows lazy, freezes and gives me the finger [blue screen and all that sh... crap all over again]. Sorry for the long explanation. Hope someobody will suggest something useful Thanks in advance, Attila

A boot to your XP cd (didn't see your OS in the post), and into the Recovery Console. From there I would run CHKDSK C: /R from the command prompt.

I could not get mine to work correctly and found posts on various forums with everybody having the same problem with d-link cards and USB adapters. Uninstall your drivers. Accect your loss and Buy a new card or USB adapter of a different brand. I bought a Netgear adapter card WG511 and it works great. No problems with my network or anybody elses. You can usually catch them onsale for around 30 dollars. Hope this helps.
