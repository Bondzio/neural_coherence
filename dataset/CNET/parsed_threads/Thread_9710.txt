<s> I have an HP Pavilion 513n with a 1.8gig processor. </s>
<s> Previous to my problem the computer had been sitting for several weeks. </s>
<s> I had taken the memory out and had not fully replaced it into the mobo slot. </s>
<s> Without realizing this I turned on the computer. </s>
<s> It beeped a lot, the power button light was on, and the HD access light stayed on continuously. </s>
<s> When I realized what I had done, I unplugged the computer and replaced the memory solidly into the slot. </s>
<s> Since then when I boot it, I get the screen message &quot;Operating System Not Found.&quot; When I go into setup, it shows no primary master or slave drive. </s>
<s> It shows my memory, floppy drive and DVD-ROM(as a secondary master) correctly. </s>
<s> The computer will boot from the floppy drive with a windows 98 boot disk. </s>
<s> It runs programs from the floppy disk without problems. </s>
<s> I have tried a different,working HD. </s>
<s> I can hear it running, but the BIOS will not recognize it is there. </s>
<s> I have switched cables. </s>
<s> Nothing I try has worked. </s>
<s> Any help would be appreciated. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> Try this. </s>
<s> Attach the HD and 80 conductor IDE cable to the SECONDARY IDE CHANNEL. </s>
<s> Does it detect it? </s>

<s> Thanks for all the suggestions. </s>
<s> I reset BIOS defaults without any success. </s>
<s> I then disconnected the DVD-ROM and connected that cable to the HD. </s>
<s> The computer booted fine. </s>
<s> But then I took the cable in the primary slot and moved it to the secondary slot(the one that the DVD-ROM was in). </s>
<s> After this the computer would not boot again. </s>
<s> In other words the cable was bad the whole time. </s>
<s> Once again thanks for the help. </s>
