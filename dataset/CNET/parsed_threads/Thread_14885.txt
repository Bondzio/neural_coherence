<s> I currently have a dell inspiron e1505 with a 120gb 5400rpm hard drive and want to go up to something bigger. </s>
<s> My choices are a 250gb 5400 hd and a 200gb 7200 rpm hard drive for about $35 more. </s>
<s> Is the speed of the 7200 fast enough to really make a big difference to my system to compensate for less space? </s>
<s> XP for instance is limited to 127GB. </s>
<s> Note: If you're asking for technical help, please be sure to include all your system info, including operating system, model number, and any other specifics related to the problem. </s>
<s> My system is Dell Inspiron e1505, 2gb ram, 256 ati radeon hypermemory, Windows Vista Home premium, 120gb 5400rpm hd, intel core 2 duo 1.6ghz </s>
<s> unless your laptop is rarely on the go, you might want to stick with the 5400rpm 250gb drive. </s>
<s> It appears you are attempting to configure a laptop for gaming so battery time is a non-issue. </s>
