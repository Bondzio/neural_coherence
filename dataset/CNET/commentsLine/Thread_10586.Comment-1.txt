this is both a peripheral and a software question.
having no experience with any of the chat platforms or pc video cameras, i am looking for suggestions on which is the best camera/chat combo to use with my daughter and granddaughter.
i am in michigan, she is in montana.
we both have pc's running xp, and both have dsl.
