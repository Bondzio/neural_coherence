<s> Hi Ok, sorry if this is in the wrong section, im new here. </s>
<s> Today I bought myself a macbook pro (running version 10.6) and have had trouble with my connection. </s>
<s> My router is a WRT54 GS ver.6, i have had it around a year. </s>
<s> I have a ps3, xbox, 2 wired windows PC and a windows laptop all connectiong to it, (Windows XP) without any problems. </s>
<s> I plug the macbook in via an ethernet cable and it recognises it but cannot connect. </s>
<s> I have an unprotected belkin router near my house which the macbook can connect to with ease. </s>
<s> any ideas on why my macbook wont connect with the linksys, if you need further information just ask. </s>
<s> Thanks Jk. </s>
<s> Normally this is just a question of plugging it in an moving on. </s>
<s> When you say that the macbook recognizes it, what do you mean? </s>
<s> Does the MB have an IP address that starts with 192 or 169? </s>
<s> (169 is not good) After not being able to load a page, does Safari display the Network Diagnostics button? </s>
<s> If so, what happens when you proceed with the diagnostics? </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> ok, my mackbook recognises my router, so that i can enter its WPA personal encryption key. </s>
<s> It accepts the key althought still wont connect to the internet. </s>
<s> The status of &quot;AirPort&quot; in the network diagnostic is yellow, and underneath it says &quot;no ip address&quot;. </s>
<s> It has something to do with my router because my macbook can connect to a belkin router nearby. </s>
<s> I have tried turning the firewall and airport on and off but no luck. </s>
<s> Im also sitting right next to my router. </s>
<s> &quot;After not being able to load a page, does Safari display the Network Diagnostics button?&quot; Yes it displays that and says it cannot fix the current networking problem. </s>
<s> my ip address now does actually say 169. how do you change this? </s>
<s> the 169 IP address is a self assigned one. </s>
<s> The computer does that because it is not getting one from the router. </s>
<s> Turn OFF any wireless encryption, on the router, make sure that Airport is expecting an address via DHCP and reboot the Mac. </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> I can't resist this - I am in between eye surgeries, so I miss a couple of things now and then. </s>
<s> Usually it is humorous. </s>
<s> When I read your post question and got to the line that reads, &quot;I am also sitting next to my router,&quot; I read it as, &quot;I am also sitting next to my mother!&quot; So, ask her! </s>
<s> Did you restart the computer after the Ethernet cable was connected? </s>
<s> Did you try to change the port on the router for the ethernet cable? </s>
<s> I hope your router can run g/N protocol, or N. You might like to see that it is not just b or g in the settings. </s>
