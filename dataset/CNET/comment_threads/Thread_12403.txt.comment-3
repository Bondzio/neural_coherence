In the Dell GX260 Desktop there is a card that splits a PCI Express to 2 PCIs.
I KNOW THEY WORK, EXIST ETC, b/c i've used both at once.
I dont know how, believe me I thought a/b exactly what you said, then i put an ethernet card and a firewire card in the slots and used them simultaneously.
so i KNOW they work...just dont know how or where to get one.
