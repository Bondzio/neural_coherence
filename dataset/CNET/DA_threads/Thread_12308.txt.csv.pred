1.1.1	Which is your favorite hard drive brand and why ?	Ques
1.1.2	Personally I am a avid fan and user of WD so that makes it my favorite brand .	St
1.1.3	To me , it is reliable and stable .	St
1.1.4	Pricing wise is reasonable .	St
1.2.1	Well I always shop for my computer needs on Newegg .	St
1.2.2	And when it comes time for me to get a hard drive I look at the reviews/storage capacity/price and see what I can get for the best bang for my buck .	St
1.2.3	I always try to stick to WD and Seagate though .	St
1.2.4	Right now I 've been using Seagate and I have n't had any problems .	St
1.3.1	I 've been using Western Digital .	St
1.3.2	It 's reliable and the products i 'm using are surpassing my expectations .	St
1.4.1	I buy the one that gives me the best bangs for the bucks .	St
1.4.2	So far..no regret .	St
1.5.1	Today they all are pretty reliable and for me it boils down to cost .	St
1.5.2	Realiablity is really just a matter of luck and if you are unlucky no matter which brand you choose could end up being flaky .	St
1.5.3	But I do n't care , hard drive are cheap and as long as I got my data backed up , I have no worries .	St
1.5.4	Just my 2 cents .	St
1.5.5	Cheers !	St
1.6.1	I have been useing seagate 's since - well - so long cant remember - mid 80 's , ''in the begining ... '' LOL the wd 's used to be a joke but I 'think ' seagate bought them so by now they should be up to seagate quality .	St
1.7.1	First choice is always WD , great reliability , performance and longevity at very good prices .	St
1.7.2	Fallback choices , Hitachi and Samsung for 2.5 & quot ; drives and Seagate for 3.5 & quot ; but only when I ca n't source a WD .	St
1.8.1	More to the point Seagate with 5 year warranty .	St
1.8.2	I 've been using these drives for a long time .	St
1.8.3	To get the 5 year warranty one has to purchase enterprise class drives or retail box drives that are labeled & quot ; 5 year warranty. & quot ; Seagate also sells drives with 1 and 3 year warranties , mostly into the OEM and external markets .	St
1.8.4	Maxtor is now owned by Seagate .	St
1.8.5	Still only carries a 3 year warranty on retail packaging..	St
1.9.1	Seagate bought Maxtor .	St
1.9.2	Western Digital is still their own company .	St
1.9.3	Their product has improved radically in the last several years , especially with high-performance drives like the Raptor family .	St
1.10.1	getting too old - sorry WD.. LOL I used to love hearing when a drive went down and was maxtor .	St
1.10.2	made a lot of money installing new seagates .	St
1.10.3	good ol ' error 1701 .	St
1.11.1	In the last 6 years , I 've had two Hitachi , two WD , and two Samsung drives die on me .	St
1.11.2	In their defense , the WD and Samsung drives were over 60 degrees C in a poorly-ventilated case , which is beyond the rated temperature , but I 'm placing my bets on my two fairly new Seagate drives for now .	St
1.11.3	I have yet to see a recent Seagate/Maxtor drive die .	St
1.11.4	I think the last bad Seagate I saw was an 80 MB 5.25 & quot ; .	St
1.11.5	( yes , megabyte ) .	Res
1.12.1	you are dateing us - I bought the newest , fastest available to increase from 10MB to 20MB	St
1.13.1	For the past several years I have used nothing but Seagate Cheetah 15K SACI or SAS drives .	St
1.13.2	They have a five year warantee .	St
1.13.3	Note - there are very few high density 15k drives out their	St
1.14.1	Like others , I preferred western digital too .	St
1.14.2	I feel that the pricing is reasonable for its stability , reliability , storage space and performance .	St
1.14.3	Moreover I am a avid user of WD products .	St
1.15.1	Hands down my answer is Hitachi .	St
1.15.2	I spend the bit higher amount , but in all my computers and all the operatings systems , the ones that live on are Hitachi .	St
1.15.3	WD and all the others die on me in around 1 year or just past it .	St
1.15.4	In fact the last brand new computer I had built one year ago had a WD and in one day it gave me a failure notice !	St
1.15.5	I had the builder purchase a Hitachi and it is still going !	St
1.16.1	Recently I bought a new WD hard drive , the one with the SAS interface and it never disappointed .	St
1.16.2	The WD S25 delivers ultra-high performance with its 3 Gb/s and 6 Gb/s SAS interfaces and a sustained sequential data rate of 128 MB/sec .	St
1.16.3	In addition to all the speed required to service any enterprise need , the WD S25 also provides a 1.6 M hour MTBF rating .	St
1.16.4	I must say I 'm impressed .	St
1.17.1	I 've been building computers for myself and for friends for a dozen years now .	St
1.17.2	I 've used practically every brand of hard drive out there .	St
1.17.3	The only brand that has a 100 % survival rating is Samsung .	St
1.17.4	I 've got several that are 11 years old and still going strong .	St
1.17.5	Maybe the new WD drives are better , but my failure rate with them used to be quite high .	St
1.17.6	Nowadays Samsung is the only brand I 'll put in the computers I build .	St
1.17.7	I have one of the new Samsung 1 TB drives in my newest computer and it is awesome !	St
1.18.1	In a few more that 20 years , I have experienced two harddrive failures .	St
1.18.2	Both of these were Western Digital Caviar drives .	St
1.18.3	One drive was on a new computer still under warranty and was replaced by the manufacturer .	St
1.18.4	The other was an older drive , of unknown history , salvaged from a discarded computer .	St
1.18.5	That ran for several months after being installed in a pieced together computer before failing .	St
1.18.6	I have heard similar storied from friends concerning WD drives and have not heard such stories concerning Seagate drives .	St
1.18.7	It is for these reasons that I prefer Seagate if that option is available .	St
1.19.1	I would have to agree with this statement .	St
1.19.2	As long as you stick to the major brands , it is a matter of luck of the pick from the assembly line .	St
1.19.3	One extra step I sometimes do is google the model number to see if there is a larger than normal amount of complaints for a particular model , so I do n't get stuck with a device that has a design flaw .	St
1.20.1	I have a pc 3 years old in september .	St
1.20.2	acer that came with an Hatachi 500gb , I added the first week of ownership a Western Digital and 3 years and two months later the Western Digital failed .	St
1.20.3	Even for a back up drive with very little on it I was rather disappointed .	St
1.20.4	It got pretty hot .	St
1.20.5	Ive unplugged it and once it cooled down it ran fine .	St
1.20.6	I put a fan right in front of the hard drive in the case and still shut down every 3 days .	St
1.20.7	So perhaps Western Digital sold me a fluke of a lemon ?	Ques
1.20.8	Oh , the warrenty expired on the 3 year mark .	St
1.20.9	this p , o , s died exactly 2 months later .	St
1.21.1	I 've had the best experience with Seagate .	St
1.21.2	I 've had several WDs to fail , but the Seagates I 've worked with seem to hold up better .	St
