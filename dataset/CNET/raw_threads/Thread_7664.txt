I watch a lot of tennis and just discovered that my subscription to tennistv won't play on the iPad. Bummer that means no watching live tennis unless I am at home.

Flash overheats your tablet, doesn't support touch based devices and eats your battery life. Webmasters should really move on...anyways someone had to make this step, and Youtube,Vimeo, Netflix, Apple and many big names made it. Thoughts on Flash

With these kind of numbers it would be crazy for C'net (or someone else) not to come up with a replacement for Adobe &quot;Flash or Reader)! DMS
