<s> Just upgraded my old Netgear WGR614 v9 G-Router (which worked fine for what it did) to the brand new WNDR750. </s>
<s> I don't really need all the speed this router offer, but I wanted the best range and figured I may as well have the best Netgear has to offer since I'm learning about networking (Had a BestBuy Gift card). </s>
<s> All I'm really using it for is to expand on my home theatre system. </s>
<s> I have a simple Windows 7 HTPC downstairs in my living room with a generic USB N-adapter connected to it and my main computer upstairs connected directly to the router (also have Network printer & other laptops connected with guest connections for guests). </s>
<s> I have several files (MP3's, MP4's, Quicktime, ect) on my main computer that I'd like to transfer/stream to the living room computer. </s>
<s> But data rates are pretty pathetic @ about 500Kbps max with a good signal. </s>
<s> However, Internet speed is very good - I have a 5Meg DSL connection and I get about 3.5 to 4Mps on a speed test. </s>
<s> I'm good with that. </s>
<s> But what do I do to get a good computer to computer transfer speed? </s>
<s> Do I need to use special software? </s>
<s> Is it a Windows or BIOS setting I'm missing? </s>
<s> Do I need to set up one computer as a media server? </s>
<s> Additional router settins missing? </s>
<s> QOS is turned on from what I can see in the Netgear interface. </s>
<s> Right now I'm just using Windows Home Networking. </s>
<s> If this is the best I can do, I may as well go back to using the old WGR614 router. </s>
<s> I'd like to get the most out of the router. </s>
<s> I have another computer to add to it wirelessly (mother in law moving in basement). </s>
<s> Please advise. </s>
<s> That's well discussed so let's give the best answer first. </s>
<s> -&gt; GET WIRED. </s>
<s> Do not use wifi for everything since that's shared bandwidth. </s>
<s> The more that's on there, the slower it goes. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> OK. Let me rephrase this question so I can get some useful answers: 1) What phrases/words to I search for to find more info on this subject? </s>
<s> I searched but I couldn't find anything that applied to what I was trying to do. </s>
<s> 2) How do you get the best WIRELESS data transfer speeds? </s>
<s> I have no interest in a wired connection. </s>
<s> If a router advertises that it's capable of transferring 450Mps wirelessly, there must be a problem if I'm only getting 256kbps computer to computer and 4Mbps from the internet to the computer. </s>
<s> Looking for the bottle neck, because I can obvioulsy trasfer satisfacty data from the router. </s>
<s> If I could break the 1Meg barrier, I'd be happy. </s>
<s> Also, I am using wired connections as well as wifi. </s>
<s> Just not to this particular computer. </s>
<s> 90% of the time there is only one computer on the wireless network. </s>
<s> That should not slow my connect down to 256Kbps, whether shared or not. </s>
<s> That full speed is only possible under lab conditions such as matching wifi parts from the same maker and no interfering signals. </s>
<s> You also are sharing the air space with the other machine so even if the max was available, since each packet must go from the first PC to the router and then from router to the next PC you lose about half the possible speed because you insisted on all wifi. </s>
<s> Hope this helps you understand this without being too technical. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Gotcha. </s>
