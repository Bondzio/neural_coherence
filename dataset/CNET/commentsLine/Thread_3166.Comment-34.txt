almost all the drives that have failed with little or no warning were in operation less than 90 days.
over half the drives still running at home are well past their 3yr warranties.
i have or support systems with drives that are over ten years old & running smooth.
there are 2 to 10 gb drives that now backup data from the up to terabyte size drives that replaced them.
that &quot;obsolete&quot; drive becomes a savior when something goes wrong on the new drive.
1. keep them cool & clean while running, no fancy stuff.
2. protect them from external movement while running.
3. keep the drive in the same position.
drives can be run flat or on their side.
because they develop wear patterns, changing their orintation is begging for trouble.
4. look at the manufactor's warranty, 3-5 yrs is normal.
i look back to the 80's & 90's were people switched the orientation of thier computers to regain desk space, drive problems were often not far behind.
