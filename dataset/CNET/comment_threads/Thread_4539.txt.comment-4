Since you've never done a water cooled system before I would strongly recommend that you get an all inclusive kit with a radiator, high quality pump (aquarium pumps are no good), waterblocks for cpu, video cards, etc.
Building a water cooling system from scratch is not for the faint of heart and until you've had some experience with them you are likely to make mistakes that may end up rendering your system flooded or inadequately cooled.
you should browse some of the stuff at this&lt;a href=''http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.asp?N=2010110062+1294418558&Submit=ENE&SubCategory=62''&gt; link &lt;/a&gt; to get a better idea of what will work for you.
Zalman makes a very nice complete system with an external radiator and the ability to mix and match waterblocks to suit your needs and won't break the bank; if you want to spare no expense you should look for swiftech products.
As for enclosing the system, but still have fans running inside the case, this is counter-productive; fans only work by taking air from the surrounding air and circulating it over your components then exhausting the heated air out of a rear or blowhole fan (typically).
If you are really worried about cat hair and dust and you want air cooling then try to find a mesh filter.
