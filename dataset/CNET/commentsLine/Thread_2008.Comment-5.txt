so people are not seeming to understand what i'm looking for... i've overclocked my video card in attempts to make it faster.
it didn't change but 2-5 fps... i am looking for replacement of old mobo/cpu.
the nf7 was bought around 3 years ago?
maybe longer, and the cpu at the same time.
the fbs of the cpu is 333 (probably 266 though, not 100% sure)... it's some old stuff... processor i'm looking at is the p4 3.40ghz... some mobos i am looking at are listed below: asus p4s800d-x msi pm8m-v mach speed matrix p4m800 help me out here please!
thanks!
