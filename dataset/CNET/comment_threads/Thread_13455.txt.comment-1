I have an inkjet printer Canon MP600 which i rarely use.
The problem is i seem to be buying ink more frequently than i use it.
It uses 5 different ink tanks.
I dont know if the ink dries up after a certain period of time.
I rarely print, maybe once a month.
I mostly print text documents.
My question is, what would be the best printer for someone who rarely prints?
