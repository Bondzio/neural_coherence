1.1.1	I have an internet connection that enters my house using a CAT5 cable through RJ45 type socket - Currently I have a desktop that is connected to the Cable - I want to share my internet connection - The desktop should have a cable connection and want to connect a laptop as well which will connect using wireless as well as cable as and when required - I will not be using both computers at all times so do not want to make my desktop a server or the laptop a server - So how do i share the connection - I mean do i use a wireless router, switch or something else ?	Ques
1.1.2	and then how do I set it up - I have no experience or education in networking so I would really appreciate it if you could tell me in detail.	St
1.1.3	Thanks for your help.	Polite
1.2.1	Normally you will connect the router to that source (usually a modem).	St
1.2.2	The router will then do its thing, wired and wireless.	St
1.2.3	After the router is in place you turn on File and Printer Sharing on each PC, but only if you want to share files and such between the two PCs.	St
1.2.4	No &quot;server&quot; settings are involved.	St
1.2.5	Again, the source is important.	St
1.2.6	If you get your service from another router, the above setup can be daunting.	St
1.3.1	Okay I checked my wiring and here is how it shows - RJ11 wire connects to Modem which is a billin modem - the router interface is inaccessible, then from the modem an RJ45 cable connects to my computer - evertime i connect to my ISP i am first taken to a login page and once I enter the username and password i get an always on connection unless the connection is idle for more than 24 hrs - I get a default gateway and IP address of 124.125.xxx.xxx - not sure if it is a static or a dynamic IP allocatin - I can check for a few days and let you know to be sure - My ISP is very forthcoming with the fact that they will not assist in setting up 3rd party routers.	St
1.3.2	They will also not give any info to help with the same - so basically i need a solution that will allow me to share the internet irrespective of modem settings.	Ques
1.3.3	I receive an always on internet connection from my RJ45 cable and I just need help so that the signal can be shared on one wired and then wireless connection.	St
1.3.4	Thanks for your help.	Polite
1.4.1	Putting a router between the modem and your PC's should be solution.	St
1.4.2	They come with instruction to set them up.	St
1.4.3	For wired connection all goes automatically.	St
1.4.4	For wireless the usuals are SSID, channel, encryption type and password.	St
1.4.5	You don't need the ISP for any of those.	St
1.4.6	Kees	St
