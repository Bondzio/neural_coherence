can any point me in the direction of a computer reseller that allows you to &quot;build it yourself&quot; offering the new intel chip q9550?
intel directed me to their resellers, however, these people were &quot;distributors&quot; and not pos computer providers.
the distributors needed you to become one of their &quot;resellers&quot; to get any information.
i don't want to resell computer parts, i just want to have one built to my specifications.
this new chip is suppose to utilize intel's new .txt technology.
i plan on using new desktop for rending graphics, cad, texture creation and manipulation, animation graphics creation.
this new technology needs a special motherboard as well (one recommended was dx35bt).
they are referred to extreme technology.
any help providing me with an online &quot;build it yourself&quot; computer company that provides this technology would be appreciated.
if i have to build it myself, i still need a supplier for &quot;one&quot; cpu.
many thanks for your time.
(would like to run on xp if possible) i also posted to computer help
