1.1.1	I brought back a stick of 256MB PC133 SDRAM to Future Shop for an exchange (since my motherboard wasn't detecting it and the AzenRAM website stated it should).	St
1.1.2	Upon returning it, there were two girls there.	St
1.1.3	I told them it was defective.	St
1.1.4	One of them said: &quot;It probably got scanned by a barcode scanner.	St
1.1.5	They make these things defective.&quot; The other said that wasn't true but the girl seemed pretty sure about it.	St
1.1.6	Now I don't know what kind of merit this has, but I was wondering since it would explain why I've gotten two different sticks of AzenRAM that don't work.	St
1.1.7	(The second one was scanned despite the other girl's warning.)	St
1.1.8	So I don't know.	St
1.1.9	What do you guys think?	Ques
1.1.10	Is the barcode scanner really messing up the RAM?	St
1.2.1	My thinking is...BULL.	St
