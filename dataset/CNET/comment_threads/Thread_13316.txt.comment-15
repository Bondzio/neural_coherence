The first thing I'd check is the air temp that your power supply is pumping out.
The power supply is probably, depending on the config, the biggest producer of ambient air temp increase inside your case.
Most people fail to realize that an extremely dirty power supply willl produce far more heat than a clean one, and if it's a single fan unit, the cooling effect of the fan maybe insufficient.
If you have more than just the power supply venting air to the outside, check the temp of the air the other fans are expelling.
The power supply should be the only expelling fan with a temp markedly warmer than room temp.
Being a bit of a cooling freak (I have sixteen rotating fans and a water block cooler in my Thermaltake Xaser II) my suggestion to anyone is to start with a reputable dual fan PSU.
