i am new to mac computers, i am used to pcs.
my daughter gave me an old ibook from 2001 that has an airport card in it.
it uses 802.11b wireless.
i would like to upgrade it to 802.11g wireless.
is this possible?
if so, do i need to buy the expensive apple airport card or is there another brand i can use?
thanks for any info.
