This is the second Microphone I've bought for my Windows XP computer and I plug the thing into the pink jack and turn it on and the Sound Effect Manager detects the microphone but when I try to use Speech Recognition like Windows XP says to do in help, there is no option for the microphone to speak and in Sound Recorder I get NO SOUND line recording!!! Please help, how do I get the Microphone to work? I want to be able to record sound with videos on my Logitech QuickCam Webcam! Please help.
