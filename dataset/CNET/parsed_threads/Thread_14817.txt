<s> I'm hoping to upgrade my hard drive to a Seagate Momentus 7200.3 320GB. </s>
<s> I am unsure whether my current notebook will find the hard drive, could someone please confirm this? </s>
<s> HP doesn't provide hard drives above 120GB for this notebook. </s>
<s> My specs: HP Compaq nx7400 Intel Centrino Duo T5600 1.8GHz 2 Gig ddr2-667 RAM 80GB Toshiba S-ATA Hard drive (original) Latest BIOS update from www.hp.com Windows Vista Ultimate 32bit PLEASE HELP!!! </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> XP SP2 or later (Vista passes) 2. </s>
<s> SATA interface = as big as they come for today. </s>
<s> Sadly there is little hope anyone has your exact laptop and has done this but if it was mine I'd do that. </s>
<s> Unless the BIOS is hardwired(bios set) not to allow such a larger HD, you can install a big HD. </s>
<s> What may happen, is you may need to partition the new HD for the bios to see 80gb or 120gb as 1st partition. </s>
<s> Then the bios is happy and the remaining HD is used a 2nd partition and not wasted. </s>
<s> The supplied recovery/restore OS disks should offer not only the original install process(8gb is reserved for OS recovery) but also partitioning as well as an option. </s>
<s> In many cases, new HDs supply their own install setup, you can then use the &quot;copy/image portion&quot; to fill the 1st partition, etc.. </s>
<s> Offhand, I don't think it will be a problem, but I found laptops unique all to often, so I can't give a clear answer, sorry. </s>
<s> I have found newer laptops are simpler to deal with. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Thanks a million Willy! </s>
<s> I recieved no recovery discs with my pc 18 months ago, however I have a backup on my desktop external. </s>
<s> I will make use of partitioning if all else fails and as long as my pc picks up the new drive! </s>
<s> Ciao Fuertos </s>
<s> I have installed the Seagate Momentus 7200.3 (320 GB) in my notebook doing the replacement and making my original hard drive a portable one. </s>
<s> I just have to say that I have not experienced a tad difficulty in transfering my operating system (Vista Ultimate 32-bit) to the new drive. </s>
<s> I made use of Seagate DiscWizard, which happens to be a sister program of the Acronis Migrate Easy and Acronis True Image Home. </s>
<s> I utilized the clone option and created a 100GB partition for the transfer. </s>
<s> After waiting about an hour with a dead black screen and two busy drives, my new drive was ready to go. </s>
<s> I merely exchanged drives (transfering the metal dock cover) and hey ho... boot-up. </s>
<s> My notebook asked to be restarted once. </s>
<s> So as of now, I'm running a much faster, larger (and more reliable according to my standards) Seagate drive. </s>
<s> It's quiet running (a slight cr-cr sound vs. a weee sound from the other drive) and I'm experiencing no lag time when I open/close a program and there are absolutely no occurrences of a program freezing and then continuing again. </s>
<s> I've ran the drive for over a while now in the same format as my previous drive and the side of my keyboard above the drive is room temperature - no heat after gaming and tracking tunes I intend on transferring my copy of Vista 64 from my other drive also to a partition on this drive now using Acronis Disk Director Suite. </s>
<s> I hope this helps someone who needs the info!! </s>
<s> Peace (and quiet) A very chuffed Fuertos </s>
