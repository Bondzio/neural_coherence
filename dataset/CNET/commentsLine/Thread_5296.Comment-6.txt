if you plan on playing light / moderate cpu taxing games (such as flash games or web games) then you can probably get away with an integrated graphics card with today's cpus.
if however you are looking to play more graphically demanding games (such as call of duty, assassin's creed, world of warcraft, crysis, etc.)
you definitely need a dedicated graphics card.
the reason is integrated graphics rely more heavily on the cpu to make all the graphical calculations and renderings which can bog down the computer's overall performance.
memory is also usually shared with the main memory which again can affect performance.
a dedicated card has it's own dedicated gpu and memory which does all the video calcs and rendering which, in turn, frees up the cpu for other tasks.
this creates a much more efficient system and gives a huge boost in overall performance especially with the more graphically demanding games.
also, if you do go with dedicated, do it right!
don't slouch on the quality of the dedicated graphics card's chipset.
a low-end/older dedicated graphics card can be almost as bad as using the newer integrated graphics chipsets.
