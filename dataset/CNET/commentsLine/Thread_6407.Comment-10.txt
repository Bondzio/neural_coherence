as i know ddr2 ram chip is not compatible with ddr3 ram chip; it means you cant use both chips simultaneously on a single motherboard.
either you have to use ddr3 or ddr2 at once.
one more thing i want to tell you about ddr3 that it is a bit sticky, it uses embedded multiplexes to enhance the data transfer rate on the system unlike the ddr2.
