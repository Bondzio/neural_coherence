i'm having troubles configuring my network.
i'll include a link to an image of a diagram of my current network layout.
i receive internet service from a wifi modem.
i have a wifi adapter that recieves that internet acces, and i share that internet through &quot;lan 1&quot; on my pc.
to share with more devices i have connected lan 1 via a crossover cable to the &quot;internet&quot; port on my wnr2000 router.
all of the other computers and devices connected to that router can access the internet and network completely with no issues.
my main pc, however, cannot access the network because of the way it is connected to the router.
i have tried connecting the main pc's &quot;lan1&quot; to the router using the &quot;ethernet&quot; ports on my router (as opposed to the &quot;internet&quot; port with crossover), but i cannot share the internet that way.
my solution was to run a connection from &quot;lan 2&quot; on my pc to &quot;ethernet 4&quot; on my router, in addition to the crossover connection.
unfortunately when i enable this connection, windows decides that lan 2 is now the internet service, rather than the wireless connection, and i lose internet to everything in my network.
is there a way to force my pc to acknowledge that &quot;lan2&quot; is for network acces only, &quot;lan1&quot; is for sharing internet only, and &quot;wireless network connection&quot; is for recieving internet service only?
here is a link to a picture of my network layout on photo bucket:
