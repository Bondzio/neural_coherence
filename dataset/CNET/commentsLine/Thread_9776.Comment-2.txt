take a look at consumer reports, read some of the reviews, ink costs etc.
personally i have never seen an inkjet printer that was really cheap to use, there is always something.
if you are doing a lot of printing, then go laser but there are trade offs with those as well, it goes on and on.
i have several printers all hp varied models and they perform well but are not cheap to operate, they are printers not all in ones, my scanners are stand alones by design.
so do some research and see what best meets your needs.
best of luck!
