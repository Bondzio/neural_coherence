These are IPAHelper and AppleMobileDeviceService. It is one of these two causing it. I have suspended both and the mouse movement is smooth again. I just have not taken the time to figure out which of the two it is (since I do not need either to run, I just suspend both). I do have a Microsoft Wireless Laser Desktop 6000 with the latest driver versions off the MS site (ver 6.2), so it is not the MS drivers.

Copy the the Microsoft Intellipoint folder from Program files to somewhere else. Uninstall intellipoint. Restart Find your mouse in the device manager. Update the drivers with the drivers in the intellipoint folder. My mouse scrolls fine now even after a restart.
