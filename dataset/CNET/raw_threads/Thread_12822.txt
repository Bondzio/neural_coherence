I had him connect the laptop directly to his belkin or linksys router (sorry for lack on information) and it was the same problem. I have not yet went over and looked at the problem, i was kind of hopping someone on here has had a simular problem. (went through basic steps by unplugging router and modem) still no results....

Can he get to the internet directly through the modem? Can he get to the internet with no other computers on this router? If you connect another computer tot he router does this one lose its ability to connect to the internet? Have you tryed: ipconfig /flushdns & ipconfig /registerdns? What does it say when you go to RUN &gt; CMD and type ipconfig /all (This is when you connected to the router)

It doesn't seem to be if a computer connects he cannot connect, he just cannot connect at all.
