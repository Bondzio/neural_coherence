of the router, another suggestion would be to take the laptop into a known wifi hot spot and see if you can at least view other available networks.
if you can, it's not your laptop but something with the router.
i'm not sure if you mentioned it but what are you using to manage the network connections?
by this i mean some software that came with the laptop or are you using windows (wireless zero) to do so?
i have found that 3rd party utilities can cause problems.
if you've changed your security protocol in the router, this will mean the wpa key you set in it will need to be plugged into the laptop connection.
what you might try to do is delete any other connection set to automatically connect.
when you get to where you can see the ssid of your router and ask to connect to it, you will be asked for the security key.
once the connection is successful, windows will remember it.
