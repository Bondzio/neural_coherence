1.1.1	I have a hp pavilion a712n.	St
1.1.2	Here is all the specs http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/genericDocument?lc=en&cc=us&docname=c00288539 I'm looking for a video card up to 200$ dollars to install.	St
1.1.3	It has to be a PCI slot cause I do not have a AGP slot.	St
1.1.4	Any suggestions for a good place/card/price?	Polite
1.1.5	Thanks a lot for any help.	St
1.2.1	I would suggest the Nvidia FX 5700LE for PCI aprx $89-$100, or the Nvidia FX 5200 for PCI aprx $68-$93.	St
1.2.2	To purchase check Neweggg or places like Best Buy, Circuit City, CompUSA, etc... http://www.newegg.com/app/manufact.asp?catalog=48&DEPA=1 on the left &quot;Advance Search&quot; click the arrow on 'Interface' and select PCI then Search at the bottom.	St
1.2.3	The companies do not make a high end PCI card.	St
1.2.4	Keep in mind that you don't select the PCI-Express card as that fits a x16 slot.	St
1.3.1	I just went to circuit city on my break and wrote down the pci slot ones and there prices.	St
1.3.2	Then I compared the prices to best buy.	St
1.3.3	http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=6731799&type=product&id=1091099665193 http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?j=1&skuId=6981723&type=product&id=1099392683347 Is the 256mb worth getting for the 40-50 dollar difference?	St
1.3.4	Any other suggestions?	St
1.3.5	Thanks a lot!	St
1.4.1	I have both of these graphics cards.	St
1.4.2	They both work well.	St
1.4.3	But the best pci graphics cards are the Nvidia FX5700 or the ATI 9250	St
1.5.1	I had forgot about the GeForce 5500 PCI card.	St
1.5.2	Well, I personally think that 256MB is not needed unless it is on a high end video card for high tech competition gamers.	St
1.5.3	I kinda think it is a marketing ploy to get people to upgrade to a higher card.	St
1.5.4	I doubt there is any game that even requires the full use of 128MB and there are an awful lot of high end cards at 128MB.	St
1.5.5	However, the BGF GeForce 5500 is an overclocked version to 290 MHz from 270MHz, and since this is for a PCI card machine, and you want the max you can get, it may be worth the $30 cost over the regular 5500 PCI card.	St
1.5.6	I haven't compared the BGF 5500 PCI to the 5700LE PCI.	St
1.5.7	Best regards & good gaming.	Polite
1.5.8	JR	St
