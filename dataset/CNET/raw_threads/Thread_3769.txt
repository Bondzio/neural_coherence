Sometimes it shows up but not always. I'm afraid to put anything important on here in case I can't access it when I need it. The Bios has it listed there as a slave drive. I went into Disk Management and formatted it and assigned it a drive letter,but the next time I turned on my computer it was gone. I am running XP Home on a desktop Emachines T6216, which is 1 year old. Thanks in advance of any help you can give me. Wendy
