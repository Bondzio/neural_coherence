1.1.1	I am just about to make a purchase of a Drobo + a DroboShare .	St
1.1.2	I have one question though .	St
1.1.3	How can I format/set up my Drobo and DroboShare so that I can read and write to it from Mac , Linux , and Windows with large files ?	Ques
1.1.4	With EXT3 Mac and Windows ca n't access it .	St
1.1.5	With NTFS Mac ca n't write to it .	St
1.1.6	With FAT32 I ca n't have files over 4GB .	St
1.1.7	With HFS+ Linux ca n't write to it .	St
1.1.8	( I believe there is some commercial software for making Windows read/write to HFS+ , but I do n't know how well it works . )	St
1.1.9	So I 'm stuck , unless I am missing something .	St
1.1.10	I am unfamiliar with how NASs work , so this might not even be an issue , but I do n't know .	St
1.1.11	Thanks !	St
1.2.1	Oops - never mind .	St
1.2.2	From the Drobo website : & quot ; Connect to your DroboShare no matter which file system youve chosen from the Windows , Mac , or Linux client of your choice because DroboShare operates on the open , cross-platform SMB protocol. & quot ; Thanks anyway !	St
1.3.1	Did you get this to work ?	Ques
1.3.2	I was going to do the same thing , use the drobo share with a mac and pc .	St
1.3.3	If you got it to work I would be grateful for some info .	St
1.3.4	Cheers Marek	St
1.4.1	Well , theoretically it should work .	St
1.4.2	So far my Linux boxes recognize it flawlessly , I have n't tried on Windows , and the Mac can see it , but ca n't connect .	St
