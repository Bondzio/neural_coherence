well i think i have isolated the issue, my video card is taking just enough juice to be a little to hard for that psu...i tried jumping it on, and it worked stable with 2 hdd's, 2 fans and a cold cathode....so i don't think either part is dead...just this one is a little too small for me...also it has 25a on the 12v rail...that should be sufficient, if it's wattage was higher right?
