1.1.1	I am currently setting up a network in a small retail store.	St
1.1.2	They are looking to have 5 computers and possibly add one more, and a server.	St
1.1.3	They want all of the computers to have access to the server since they will be using a POS system and right now the point of sale has different information on each computer (which is not a good thing).'	St
1.1.4	The reason I am going with wireless is that they constantly move there displays and only one of the computers is in a permanent spot.	St
1.1.5	Which equipment would you guys suggest for this setup?	St
1.1.6	And what would be the ideal way to set it up to access the server?	St
1.1.7	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	That you can read about at linksys.com or dlink.com I suggest you implement it like any other setup and use the wireless security to keep unauthorized users out.	Ques
1.2.2	In closing, try to keep all the WIFI products of the same make and the FIRMWARE and DRIVERS the latest.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	I am looking for the router with the best securfity features, as the owner is slightly paranoid....	St
1.4.1	You can use MAC FILTERING which allows ONLY the network cards you put in the list to have access.	St
1.4.2	Again, nothing appears to be different or special in this setup.	St
1.4.3	Bob	St
1.5.1	you may want to disable SSID broadcasting, change the router password, use WPA encryption.	St
1.5.2	Businesses broadcasting their business (not to mention credit card numbers) over radio waves is rather risky.	St
1.6.1	''Businesses broadcasting their business (not to mention credit card numbers) over radio waves is rather risky. ''	St
1.6.2	In your opinion then, wireless would not be ideal for retail, or would you just make sure the network is secure?	St
1.7.1	After you lock it up with MAC filtering, you move to WPA encryption.	St
1.7.2	But I would be duplicating far too many web sites to note that.	St
1.7.3	Bob	St
1.8.1	that is the reason for all of these security measures.	St
1.8.2	Convenience is the deciding issue.	St
