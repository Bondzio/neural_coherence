<s> There are so many hard drive duplicators around in the market such as Data Copy King, Data Compass unlimited,Ninja duplicator, deepspar disk imager, atola imager, imagemaster solo,supersonix, etc. </s>
<s> Which to buy? </s>
<s> Which is the best? </s>
<s> What suggestions do you have? </s>
<s> I do this all the time with a spare unwanted PC. </s>
<s> Why would there be a market for such when I get by with free? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> yes, Man, You can be right and like me, if I want to image or duplicate faulty drives, like bad sectors or if I want to backup a lot of data, can you tell me what can be the best solution? </s>
<s> Time? </s>
<s> Some people told me some potential risks of using free stuff, I am really afraid of that. </s>
<s> So that means you should pay up. </s>
<s> Now that you revealed you might be into data recovery where you need to skip bad sectors read http://clonezilla-sysresccd.hellug.gr/recover.html Lots of choices and good luck but I can't help folk that snub free machines and free solutions. </s>
<s> I won't write at length but why isn't this acceptable? </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> R. Proffitt is right for the attitude of free tools, free tools have many solutions that paid tools may not have. </s>
<s> With some good free ones, you do many things. </s>
<s> For hard drive duplicators, I have both data copy king and Ninja. </s>
<s> Ninja is really excellent for its copying wanted files and partitions; for data copy king, the best point is its data copying speed about 6.67GB/min and it's able to copy drives with bad sectors. </s>
<s> Besides, I have downloaded many online free backup software, remember one thing, the more solutions you have, the better result you will have! </s>
<s> Hello everyone, I didn't mean to snub free devices and solutions and I am not a millionaire, if free devices would solve everything, how shall I spend one cent for the paid ones? </s>
<s> Anyway, thanks for your focus on the important copying solutions. </s>
<s> Btw,I see in websites talking about hard drive duplicators, disk imager, data copy tools, any differece among them or they are actually the same thing. </s>
<s> I just bought a StarTech (about $50 from amazon). </s>
<s> It's a pretty simple device by looking at it... there are a few pretty LED lights, 3 buttons and 2 hard drive slots! </s>
<s> Drop your drives in, Click a button and boom you have an identical copy of your original hard dive. </s>
<s> Oddly enough the Source Drive is labeled SLOT#2.. and the destination drive is labeled SLOT#1.. .Well, you can only imagine what I just did to my original drive after several months of installing software on my workstation and getting it just the way I wanted it!!! </s>
<s> Fudge!! </s>
<s> Oh well, I suppose if I had read the directions it would have warned me about this stupid design flaw. </s>
<s> I'm sure it works great once you have the drives in the right (logically opposite) slots, so I will give it 3-stars out of 5. </s>
