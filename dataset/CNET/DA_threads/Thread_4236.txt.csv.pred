1.1.1	I have just bought a Ricoh Africo AP4510.	St
1.1.2	It will not print.	St
1.1.3	It is online.	St
1.1.4	the cables are correctly plugged in.	St
1.1.5	the power supply is on.	St
1.1.6	i send a page to print and nothing happens and it comes up printer error.	St
1.1.7	Even a test page will not print from my computer.	St
1.1.8	I have connected it through the LPT1 port.	St
1.1.9	Does anyone know what i am doing wrong.	Ques
1.1.10	Do I need to clear out some registers or other stuff on my computer.	St
1.1.11	The computer tells me the LPT1 port is working and ok.	St
1.1.12	Please help i've spent hours on this.	St
1.2.1	Since DOS can send to LPT1 I boot to DOS and tap the PrtScr (print screen) key about 3 or 4 times to see if the printer is alive.	St
1.2.2	If not I know its my machine or cable and proceed to fix that.	St

1.3.1	hi thanks for your help.	Polite
1.3.2	It is still not printing.	St
1.3.3	I have checked the cable and changed it.	St
1.3.4	The printer will print a test page from its own menu - so i know the printer is working.	St
1.4.1	http://www.gcopnet.com/pdf/ricoh/AP4510.pdf I do NOT own this printer but a cousin of this model needed a menu item turned on to allow the printer port to work.	St
1.4.2	http://www.ricoh-usa.com/downloads/manuals.asp is where the manuals are.	St
1.4.3	I haven't read it yet but leave that to you.	St
1.4.4	Good luck and try the network connection next.	Polite

1.5.1	Hi thanks for the links.	Polite
1.5.2	I have went through the setup process again.	St
1.5.3	I am not using this printer on a network.	St
1.5.4	It is connected to my stand alone desktop computer.	St
1.5.5	I am completely confused by this problem.	St
1.6.1	I'd move to a network connection next if service is not available to show you it functioning.	St
