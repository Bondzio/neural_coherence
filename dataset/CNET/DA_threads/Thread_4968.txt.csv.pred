1.1.1	Heres a quick summary of the problem and the hardware involved.	St
1.1.2	I have been to many forums and a lot of people have had similiar problems and there are many solutions, but nothing has worked for very long.	St
1.1.3	Does anyone out there have an idea of what should be done to gain a sustained connection.	St
1.1.4	Its a Linksys BEFW11S4, version 2 (most other posts with the same prob have the version 4.	St
1.1.5	)Adapter is Linksys WUSB11, ver 2.6... both are fully up to date on firmware and drivers...	St

1.5.1	I dont know if you already found the answer, but I used to have the same problem with my Linksys, just make sure the IEEE 802.1 authentication is off, you have the lates firmware update and be aware of any other electronic devices such as Cordless phone do not operate in the same wavelength as your transmitters, I strongly recommend you to use a WEP 64bit Encryption.
