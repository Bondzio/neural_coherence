well i decided to try linux on my computer, downloaded it, burned it, all went well.
then in the middle of the installation it froze.
then i had no os,(or a recovery disk from hp) so i had linux for a week and couldnt install win vista for some reason.
so i tried some stuff, format hdd,no ,install vista, nope, download a recovery disk, nope, i was trying alot of things.
the thing that finaly worked: my mom told me to fix her old computer hdd to work as an external but se got the wrong case for it.
i ended up botting on her hdd in my media center in safe-command promt mode(all others wouldnt work.
then i did crtl-shift-esc... ran the explorer program, hit start-f typed in &quot;recovery&quot; and found a way to burn a recovery cd.
so i have an hp media center now on win xp pro... thats probably y but i need to find out on how to get my sound back kuz i dont wanna spend 60$ for somethin i already got.... is that detailed enough??
?
