just when i thought i had this issue figured out (thought it was an overheating problem) it comes back to haunt me.
computer: gigabyte mb, p4 3.0ghz, 1x 512mb pc3200 ddr, 128 mb radeon 9600 graphics card, 400 watt pwr sply with a cold machine, from start-up, the system goes through the bios configuration checks, and begins loading the o/s from the hd, it then simply shuts off!
sometimes when it is running, the system would just freeze, and i have to do a hard restart to turn it off, and then the shorting-out ensues.
there are no error beeps when the system is turned on, i checked the mb battery (just checking everything) it was fine, the system is not overheating i've kept the case open and even blew a house fan into it (system temps were mild also), as far as i can see, the mb does not have direct contact with the case that would cause a short.
i am completey stumped!
i don't know if i have a faulty processor, power supply, ddr, mb!
faulty case (buttons/connectors)?
any help is much appreciated.
