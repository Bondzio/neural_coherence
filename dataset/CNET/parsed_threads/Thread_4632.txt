<s> Okay here is my story, I brought a 80 Gb hard drive mid January as a second drive to my 20 Gb drive because I was running low on space. </s>
<s> My mother board and CPU at that time were 4.5 years old (PIII 800 MHz). </s>
<s> When I installed the second hard drive the bios only detected 32 Gb. </s>
<s> I couldn't find any update for my bios and I didn't want to accidently reck my system so I just partitioned and formated the drive for the 32 Gb because I figured it was 32Gb more than I had before. </s>
<s> So this brings up to last week. </s>
<s> Last Thurday my motherboard and CPU crashed. </s>
<s> Don't know why, but the end result is I got a brand new motherboard and am now running a P4 3GHz system. </s>
<s> I have my old drives in the new system and it is now saying I only have just over 2 Gb left on both hard drives. </s>
<s> I am wondering if my 80 Gb drive can be repartitioned so I will be able to get my 50 Gb back that I lost. </s>
<s> I know this motherboard shouldn't have a problem like my last one in reading drives over 32 Gb. </s>
<s> So my question is can this be done? </s>
<s> And will I lose the 30 Gb of files that are on the drive now? </s>
<s> I am running Windows 98 SE if that helps. </s>
<s> We only lose what we didn't backup. </s>
<s> With DVD recorders being in the sub 90 buck region, and a 10 pack of media som 20 bucks, for 99 bucks you could backup 47 gigabytes of files. </s>
<s> If the files are not worth 99 bucks, then you've revealed how much such is worth to you. </s>
<s> Moving a drive is often OK, but the number of posts where people lose it all is telling. </s>

<s> As Bob says, back up everything first. </s>
<s> It was not mentioned that a jumper on the drive could be a limiting factor. </s>
<s> Check the jumper/jumpers on the rear of the drive mostly used to configure master or slave. </s>
<s> You might find one which limits the size to 32 gigs. </s>
<s> This allows larger drives to be used in older systems that cannot handle them otherwise. </s>
<s> There is a program called Partion Magic that will do this. </s>
<s> BUT you still need to back up your data. </s>

<s> I may be wrong, but given the age of his previous computer, it is quite likely that his previous comp. </s>
<s> simply created 1 32Gb (max allowed on FAT32 (Windows98)) and ignored the other blank space. </s>
<s> You should be able to regain it by repartitioning, but, like the others said, always backup before a partition. </s>
