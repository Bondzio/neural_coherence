So I scoured the web for a 7200rpm+FW800 option and boiled it down to either getting the Seagate 2.5 500GB 7200rpm HDD with OWC FW800 enclosure (~200$) versus the Seagate Freeagent Go Pro of the same specs (190$). I also know that Lacie has the rugged option but it is 320GB and more expensive than the Seagate for less space. Nevertheless, I can't decide between the two. On the Seagate hand, I'll have a 5 year warranty versus 3 years for the Seagate drive and 1 year for the enclosure. On the OWC side, I can always switch out the drive without voiding any warranties since I put it together myself. What do you guys think. I think I'm leaning towards Seagate's warranty but want to hear some wisdom before swiping the card and a good chunk of my pay check.

Is there an article you can point to? Why do they have a shorter life than most internal drives? Please fill me in on more details.

After decades in and around computers of all shapes and sizes this is what I've learned. &quot;Backup is learned rather than taught.&quot; While we can teach, write about backup each new user appears to question the need for backup until they suffer loss. Then they no longer need to be told or taught. Sorry about that but it can upset some when you write it harshly. Bob

You say that the drives I mention have a shorter life, then I ask which drives have the longer life? Is this a portable vs. desktop issue, a 7200 rpm issue? I do video editing on the go and need a solution for carrying around files larger than my laptop can hold. It sounds like it doesn't matter what drive I get as long as I back it up. Is that correct?

3534	8	352961	3098242	3097422	ajmrkva	8/8/09 3:43 PM	1.24974618E12	Cool. Keeps things simple I guess.	So I'm just going to put together a 500GB solution that is 7200 rpm for video editing, and make sure to back it up. Thanks for the advice.
