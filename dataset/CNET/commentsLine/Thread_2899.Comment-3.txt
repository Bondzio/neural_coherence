yeah, the casual gaming is mostly world of warcraft- it eats up some time, but i'm definitely not too hardcore.
thankfully blizzard had the insight to make wow playable on some lower-end machines.
if i could get a machine- no moniter, i have a 17&quot; lcd which i love- for 800 bucks or less, that would be super.
(don't laugh- i know its possible.)
any ideas here?
the cheaper the better- i just don't want garbage, either.
