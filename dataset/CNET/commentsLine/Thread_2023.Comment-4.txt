there was another discussion just like this.
they had the usb 2.0, but after they partitioned and formatted it, the drive worked fine in the box.
they tested it by putting the drive into the pc and again it was unreadable.
you may have to use some laptop to desktop adapter (they are cheap) to drag your data off this drive.
