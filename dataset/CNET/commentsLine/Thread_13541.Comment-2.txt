just now, i was running the windows 7 memory test and i noticed something interesting: when 2 sticks in dual channel mode, mem test reboots or freezes when trying each stick separately, both cause the system to crash / freeze... and i tried different slots too.
(it always had problem getting pass 15% for the standard test) any suggestions are welcome
