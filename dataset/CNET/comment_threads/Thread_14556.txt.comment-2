in your original thread where you were NOT told it was no good, but that there were better cards for the same or lower price??
I would suspect that the person could give you further basis for his reasons.
I know nothing about tvideo card performance, but have read many threads where a card with a lower amount of memory performed better than one with more memory.
There are other factors.
