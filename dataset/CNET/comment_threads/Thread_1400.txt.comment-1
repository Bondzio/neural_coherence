I am running a P4, 2.6ghz (800mhz FSB)on a Asus mobo.
My question is should I keep the (2) 256mb sticks of pc2700 (in duel channel) or should I swap in (2) 512mb sticks of pc2100?
Which would give me better performance?
Or can I just overclock the pc2100, and put all (4) DDR modules in @ the same time?
Any advice is appreciated!
Thanks!
