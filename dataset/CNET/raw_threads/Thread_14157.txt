I love music,movies, tv viewing on my PC with Windows Media Center, but I'm running out of room and we have 3 pcs in the house. So everyone is fighting to use the master computer with all the files. I'm looking at the Seagate / 650GB / 7200 / 16MB / USB 2.0 / External Hard Drive but I have heard scary stories about people external harddrives getting corrupted when they power off due to a blackout (even with a backup battery). Any advice on how to set this up on my home network so we can all use the media I put on the drive and have you heard about this corruption problem?

They are not &quot;storage&quot; devices but more accurately temporary storage. You can help by converting the drive from it's supplied FAT32 formatting to NTFS when you get it. NTFS is more damage resistant and survived most if not all power loss issues. FAT32 could indeed vanish... Bob
