<s> g'day, I am a technical neanderthal who is looking to connect my kids xbox360 to xbox live. </s>
<s> Current configuration is single port modem connecting to Apple Airport Express. </s>
<s> Current home wireless network of mix of 2 x PCs and 1 x mac desktops works well. </s>
<s> The issue is whether to get the xbox 360 wireless adapter or connect via ethernet cable. </s>
<s> Have heard that wireless causes lag in live gaming, so looking at wired option. </s>
<s> Xbox is on same room as modem, so no issues there, but given single port, looks like I either need a new modem/router combo or just a router connecting to existing modem, and then connect Airport and xbox ethernet cable to that. </s>
<s> Don't know what is best, so hope you can help. </s>
<s> Cheers </s>
<s> WIFI can be interferred with, smacked down at the wrong time so gamers eventually learn to get wired. </s>
<s> As noted, you should definitely go wired. </s>
<s> You can go with either the router or modem/router combo. </s>
<s> Adding a router is the easier solution since your modem is already configured with your ISP and you know it works fine with their network. </s>
<s> You may have to consider the Airport's compatibility though. </s>
<s> You might have to make some adjustments to the Airport's configuration settings if possible (e.g. </s>
<s> turning off DHCP). </s>
<s> If you're willing to loose the Airport Express, you could just purchase a wireless router to simplify the LAN configuration. </s>
<s> Will go with wired connection from xbox360. </s>
<s> Appreciate you help on this. </s>
<s> Regards. </s>
