<s> hey.. im having some problems with my IDE hard drive... the other day i started up my computer and it said hard drive error.. then i tried going in to windows repair and tried fixmbr. </s>
<s> after i did that i tried to restart and got the same error.. i tried to go into windows repair again from the windows xp setup cdrom, but this time it wont even recognize the drive.. i went into bios and it can still find my drive, but windows cannot find it. </s>
<s> i also tried using mbr repair software, but they cant find the drive either. </s>
<s> only bios can find the drive. </s>
<s> can somebody tell me how i can get my drive up and running again, hopefully without losing any of my information? </s>
<s> thanks! </s>

<s> make sure your ide cable is firmly seated to the motherboard and the drive. </s>
<s> if that doesn't help, try moving the cable to a different ide port on the motherboard. </s>
<s> Then add the other as slave later to see if I can copy files out. </s>
<s> Nothing in your post suggests another course of action. </s>
<s> You could try the drive maker's test program but after seeing this story too many times I skip that and move right for the kill. </s>

<s> Try changing your ide cable.if that doesnt work get your hard disk change coz the platters in it has got damaged </s>
