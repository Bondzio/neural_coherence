To host an 8 player skirmish plus play it will overtax just about any machine today.
You'll have to look at splitting the game server and your playing machine up.
How do I know this?
Just from experience on other multiplayer game servers.
The office did the usual lan game thing once in awhile and we found out quickly to split off the server onto it's own machine.
