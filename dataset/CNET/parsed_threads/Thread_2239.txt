<s> I have a trendnet wireless router and my desktop is connected to the router with a cable. </s>
<s> I had an old laptop with a trendnet pc card and my speeds and connections were great. </s>
<s> The problem is with my new laptop. </s>
<s> I no longer have the old laptop. </s>
<s> My new laptop has a broadcom internal wireless adapter and the speeds were really slow. </s>
<s> I took off the security and set a MAC filter list. </s>
<s> My speed is good now, but I keep losing my connection for no reason! </s>
<s> When I reconnect it works fine for a while, then it's gone again. </s>
<s> I have changed from channel 7 to 6. </s>
<s> Try moving the router to a central location in the house. </s>
<s> Also, right-click the wifi connection in the lower right of your screen and set the priority of your router as the first to connect. </s>
<s> If you go to multiple locations or have a neighbor with a wifi router, your laptop might be trying to connecto to it, occasionally. </s>
<s> There are easy to find softwares to interfere and hijack a neighbor's WIFI if they use no security or WEP or MAC filtering or any combo of these. </s>
<s> This is why we note in our forum sticky to move to WPA (and not WPA2) and forgo MAC filtering. </s>
