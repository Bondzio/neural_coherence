I've searched online and all I've found are articles to convert from Fat32 to NTSC and not vice versa. Any advise or help? Thank!

The volatile nature of USB connected FAT32 hard disks is something I want you to consider first. Visit our other forums (Storage) and you find many that are trying to get their files back. Armed with the knowledge the entire disk contents may vanish when you pull the USB plug because of FAT32 not being damage resistant you will know to never rely on files on said drive as well as be ready to repartition and format said volume as often as it vanishes. Since it will vanish from time to time I suggest that you test your backup of those 40G of files by comparing it with your backup (I use SYNCBACK) and then use the disk management in Windows or similar in the MACOS to create a FAT32 partition then format it.
