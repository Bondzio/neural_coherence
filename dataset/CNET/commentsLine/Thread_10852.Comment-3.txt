i had something happen to my unit last night.
it will power up, (fans running, leds light up), but i get nothing to my monitor.
thied it with two other monitors, nothing... i've been in hp.com trying to find a new motherboard, but cannot locate an exact match; micro-star international, gamila/giovani/neon series030.
serial number: 4811472490 bios: award software 3.25 04/12/2005 hp part number : p8557-69002.
i got this number from the hp website, but they said - not available.
any suggestions?
