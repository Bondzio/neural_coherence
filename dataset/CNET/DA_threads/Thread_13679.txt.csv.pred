1.1.1	Im wondering what will happen if you use more than 4gb Ram memory on a 32 bit OS?	St
1.1.2	Will the system crash or will the extra memory just be 'cut off' so the computer cant use the extra memory?	St
1.1.3	And if I buy 4x 1024mb RAM that will add up to 4096mb will that be counted as more than 4GB?	St
1.2.1	Sorry, but in today's Intel architecture machines it won't do any good.	St
1.2.2	In fact due to the design you find machines that hand 2.0 to 3.5GB to said 32bit OS.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	Google away for the more than 3.5gb ram edit to your system.	St
1.3.2	That way you can boot your 32-bit with more than 4gb.	St
1.3.3	However, the OS will only use upto 3.5gb of ram, though under another MS patch it will report the full amount.	St
1.3.4	If not, then get the patch BUT it only reports the amount not its usage.	St
1.3.5	Without the edit, your system may hang or be slow, freeze, etc.	St
1.3.6	or simply work as the bios(maybe) also comes into play, but the OS is the main culprit.	St
1.3.7	This topic has been discussed before here in the forums, search and get yet more details or review the replies posted.	St
1.3.8	tada -----Willy	St
