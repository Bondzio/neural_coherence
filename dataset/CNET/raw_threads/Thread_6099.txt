I don't know where they are stored exactly, so even though I regularly make backups of my important files, I have lost important emails in the past after a hard disk failure. And, how do I reactivate that file later on, after installing a new hard disk and reinstalling MSOffice for example? How do I get the back-up email file to be accessible in my Inbox? Thanks in advance for your help.
