i already made sure that was plugged in.
my case fans start up and the led lights do turn on, as well as the cpu's water cooling starting up for about a split second... then they all turn off.
the light on the mobo is on.
and it is a 600 watt power supply, should be almost excessive.
i did take it to best buy once when i got this problem... they got it to boot but i have no idea how.
