<s> Does anyone know if you can take a p/s right out of the box, put it on the counter, plug it in and everything should work fine or does it have to be installed? </s>
<s> I bought a 400w coolmax and when I plugged it in the fan ran for a second and shut down. </s>
<s> Both on the counter and in the case. </s>
<s> No other cables connected. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> A power supply is not installed. </s>
<s> Take it back. </s>
<s> I suspect you may need an item like this http://www.pcpowerandcooling.com/products/alarmandaccesories/accessories/popups/index_tester.htm to test/power on the PS as a stand alone unit. </s>
<s> However I am not in the PC build-it/fix-business. </s>
<s> You need a load in order to test, otherwise the p/s unit will shutdown or simply not work. </s>
<s> I assume when you say, &quot;does it have to be installed?&quot; that all the required wire harness were hooked-up and if so and it still did that either an improper connection or bad unit. </s>
<s> I exclude any possible mtrb(system) problem besides the p/s, as if that's the reason you brought it the 1st place? </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
<s> the only load was the rear 120mm fan. </s>
<s> No other components are even installed in the case. </s>
<s> Seems to me that the p/s should at least provide enough power to turn it's own fans. </s>
<s> Of course that's why I asked. </s>
<s> Thanks </s>
<s> The behavior you describe is normal for an &quot;ATX&quot; type power supply, the type used in virtually all PC's made in the last 5 years or so. </s>
<s> An ATX supply is actually turned on via the motherboard. </s>
<s> The switch on the back of the supply, if any, only switches on/off the AC going into the supply. </s>
<s> To test on the bench, you need first attach a &quot;load&quot; to the supply to prevent damage, then jumper pins 14 and 15 to start the supply. </s>
<s> PLEASE DO NOT try this if you are not comfortable playing around with electricity! </s>
<s> See http://www.compute-aid.com/atxspec.html for more info. </s>
<s> You need a true load whether it be the actual mtrbd. </s>
<s> or a &quot;dummy load&quot; sold for that purpose. </s>
<s> http://www.pcpowerandcooling.com shows such a device. </s>
<s> Other vendors offer it as it as well, probably called an ATX p/s dummy/load tester. </s>
<s> I believe http://www.computergeeks.com has it as well. </s>
<s> good luck -----Willy </s>
