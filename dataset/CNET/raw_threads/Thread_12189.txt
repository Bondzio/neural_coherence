Now I can not play or explore a CD, though the D drive is visible in My Computer, and device manager sees no problem, functioning normally. have already dealt the *.vxd's that can cause conflicts. I searched for newer drivers but there is nothing newer than version 3.0d as far as I can tell. What else can i check? Faldown

I was trying to open a CD when it did lock the third time. Now it is working. I did not do anything much; just tried to scan the registry for errors -- none. Then i thought to use the soundcard to play the CD -- Creative Live! has a Playcenter which can find music sources. The CD/RW drive played. Then I re-installed WMPlayer 9 (which uses very little resources on this machine)and it started to find the songs too. -- I can not explain the inaccessibility -- it was not just WMP because I could not open the drive through My Computer either. You still believe that the drive is dying? I don't play CDs much on it, nor use it as a ROM, but I do burn occasionally, with excellent results. I realise it's now 5 years old, but it has not done that many miles. Cheers Faldown
