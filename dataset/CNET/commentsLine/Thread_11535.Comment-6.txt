i checked my bios settings last night and didnt see anything in particular that i thought would address this problem.
i also put the cd that came along with the mobo in and booted from that in hopes that it would have somehting on there to fix my problem.
do you think the fact the i dual boot to linux has any thign to do with the windows setup not beaingabel to see the drive?
