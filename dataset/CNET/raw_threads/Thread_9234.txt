4354	0	36920	430569	NR	Brandon Eng	9/14/04 7:30 PM	1.0951902E12	Doh! Did I make a mistake on this Ebay auction?	I feel like a fool for even posting this, but I was looking at some ebay items, and saw this combo kit: &quot;New AMD Athlon XP 2800+ 333 FSB 512 K L2 Cache Socket A CPU in Retail Box AND New ECS N2U400-A Motherboard nForce2 Ultra 400 Chipset, AGP 8X, 6 Channel Audio, Support Dual Channel DDR400 Memory in Retail Box Brand New! Not Refurbished! Never Used!&quot; I won the bid for $144.48. The Athlon chip goes for $140 retail on newegg. The ECS (jumperless) supports a 400 Mhz FSB and goes for $40-$50 depending on where you buy from, and got really good reviews. I really don't NEED this setup, and kinda feel I did good getting the chip and highly reviewed mobo for less than the chip retail. Having just upgraded my daughter's system because of a blown motherboard with a Biostar P4VMA-M motherboard and a 2.8 intel Duron, I kinda feel like I tossed some $$ out the window (not to mention what I'm gonna say to my wife,lol). I can always pop the chip into my existing system that has an XP2000+ chip w/a FSB of 266 and upgrade my ram to 333 FSB for a little speed boost. But after a dialogue here with Ray Harinec here, we both kinda agreed it wasn't worth my upgrading to a 2500 Barton that he was offering for sale. I guess I can try to sell the ECS board on Ebay (never have sold on Ebay, only bought) to recoup a few bux, may bundle my 2000+ chip too. I've kinda put off my AMD 64 upgrade for awhile, while waiting for the chip prices to come down a bit. I have to admit I wasn't paying attention too well during the bid cuz I was looking up reviews on the ECS board (all very good), and bid a a couple of bux above the last bid (kinda leaving it up to the pc gods), and before I knew it, I won the bid! Oy! So I guess I'm asking- what others would do in my place; swap out chips, sell the ECS board, resell the whole kit, sell the board and my old 2000+ chip. Or you can just tell me I was an idiot for not paying attention. Assuming this is in fact a retail chip as advertised, it's not the end of the world (until my wife finds out), but now I'd have to spend some bux on pc 2700 ram to get the 333 FSB. I normally don't buy chips from Ebay, especially from a seller with a short history. I did pay for the item with a credit card, so I feel somewhat protected should things go wrong. fwiw, here the link to the sale: http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=6707423784 Doh! I do feel like an idiot at the moment. Would appreciate opinions, good, bad or ugly, lol.

You got what you ordered and by your accounts seemed to save some money. It apparently works or will once you install it. It is what is says it is, so I don't see it. I hope you will like it in the long run. IMHO, I don't buy ECS stuff and they're low end compared to other brands but yeah, I've seen quite a few(other models) installed and working. I figure for a few $$ more, I go for Asus,Biostar, Gigabyte, etc., but it seems hardly that much difference nowadays. As for the cpu pricing, make sure you're not comparing retail(boxed) with OEM types, the chips maybe the same but not the overall complete offering plus the warranty side. good luck -----Willy

If you think you got a bargain then you got a bargain..if not..chuck it up as a lesson in ...what ever, hehe. I have bought lots of things from ubid but I have never venture into ebay. I just don't like to deal with someone I don't know anything about.

Thanks Willy, Well, the problem was I was asleep at the wheel; I was actually watching the bid, while really looking at a 64 chip. I guess I'm looking for, &quot;yeah, great buy! Don't worry about it!&quot; Or, &quot;I wouldn't waste my time on such a minor upgrade.&quot; Point/problem is, I'm just tired of gutting systems and rebuilding, especially just after my daughter's this past weekend. I was looking forward to the AMD 64 upgrade to be my last for quite awhile. I guess if I get enough opinions, I can decide hopefully decide what I think of as a bone-headed mistake on my part. Live with it and wait 'til the 64 prices drop? Or sell the stuff and wait. Just can't make up my mind at the moment. Not a fan of ECS boards either, as my last one an ECS K7S5A was a nightmare, but at least this one is jumperless except for the cmos and got good reviews. But I really think I only have the energy to swap out the chip. Thanks for input.

I feel like I made a bonehead mistake, and not sure what to do. I don't have comparison benchmarks to see how much I'll get out of this upgrade, already spent $$ on daughter's system, then this. Can't make up my mind what to do with this chip; as it was, I was thinking of the 2500 Barton for about a yr. and overclocking it, then the 64s came out, and decided, yeah, definitely going for the 64; I trust the members in here enough to have posted this. Guess I want to hear soothing words, lol. Or someone simply telling me I made an unfortunate dumba$$ mistake. I'm not normally this indecisive, but buying from someone that doesn't have a long track record has added to my fear factor.

I'm too lazy to look up the mobo, but explain the dual channel memory on an AMD 32 bit CPU. I was not aware that any 32 bit AMD CPU supported dual channel. [the 64 bitters do].

4354	11	36920	431684	431570	Ray Harinec	9/15/04 12:40 PM	1.095252E12	What mobo are you using??	Dual channel would mean that your memory bus is 128 bits wide. if that is what you have, fine. I wasn't aware that there were mobo's for the 32 Bit AMD's that do that. I looked at Brandon's mobo and it has three memory slots it seems that it can only support Dual Channel on two slots [different colors]. Normally dual channel 400 will give an 800 MHz FSB. I'm guessing that in the AMD case, the memory controller hub [MCH] part of the Northbridge has two channels to/from the memory, but still only a single channel to the CPU [Intel had two channels from the MCH to the CPU.] That's why the FSB is only 400, not 800. I could well be incorrect. wouldn't be the first time. The 64 Bit AMD's have the MCH as part of the CPU die and thus support Dual Channel all the way.
4354	12	36920	432222	431471	Brandon Eng	9/15/04 7:30 PM	1.0952766E12	Think there's some misunderstaning	The failed system was my daughter's, with an ECS K7S5A with a 1.4 Athlon running @ 266 FSB; had 98 loaded, so had only 1 stick 256 pc 2100. Turns out the motherboard was shot, power supply seems fine, no way to test if the chip survived as there were no socket A boards to test in. Guess I can test it in the new mobo when I get it, lol. Sorry if I may have confused you (I'm confused myself about everything, at the moment) if I suggested anything was running dual channel on the Athlon. The new chip is a 2800 Barton with the FSB locked @ 333 (as you know, some will run @ 400). The new ECS board I'm getting is capable of running @ 400, but since my Asus is locked in at 333, I wont be getting pc3200 for it. I rebuilt my daughter's system with a Biostar P4VmA-M socket 478 micro-atx board that's surprisingly versatile. It can accept an Intel chip up to 3 Ghz; loaded XP on it, which she wanted for her birthday. It has a fsb of 400, so I bought a stick of 512 pc3200, and a 2.8 Duron chip. Running surprisingly well, but after some benchmarks, e.g pcpitstop, it still doesn't compare to my existing system. My system scores about 1300 at pcpitstop, while her's scores a hair over 1100. The Phoenix-Award BIOS stinks, no settings for FSB or much of anything else, but it was cheap, seems stable, and the cost of the board and chip was about $165, which is what the individual parts would have cost on newegg. The ram cost $85, and the 80 gig HD was $75 (was gonna put in my extra 80 gigger I already had, but didn't expect the system to toast when it did.)I'll have to look in the BIOS more to see if set something wrong; it was a rush job to get it together in time for her birthday last Fri. So neither of my systems, or the new one coming in will run dual channel (I wish!). Geesh, for the $$ I've spent on rebuilding my daughter's system, the hairbrained bid I did on Ebay, I probably coulda gotten my A64 system together. I've decided to go with the 64 3200 chip (not a socket 939!) as the prices above that chip really begin to skyrocket. Just curious, what did I say to suggest the AMD chip would run dual memory? Anyway, maybe there's a happy ending for this debacle. If I'm comfortable with the speed bump, I'll live with it for awhile. I already have some potential buyers for the board which I'll sell for around $40, which I think is a fair price. Which means I'll have gotten a 2800 Barton for roughly $100-should arrive at my job t'mmw, Fri. latest. Just hope I bought from an honest seller and everything is retail as advertised. But now the problem is that I'll have an extra 1.4 chip, and 3 sticks of pc2100, 256 megs each. Enough to build yet *another* little system, which will make my wife REAL happy, lol. Anyway, I posted this to commiserate with my online friends; to tell ya the truth, I was kinda playing with the bid, thinking there was a bot that pumped up the bid, and at the same time looking at other stuff on the net, and before I knew it, I won; DUH! Well, it seems my 64 system wont happen until after the new year. I read in a computer mag today that ram prices are going to be going way up and staying high for awhile because flash memory is taking up a big market. Tween my daughter's Intel system (my first), and all the different chipsets, I'm totally confused. For the moment, I've decided on an MSI K8T NEO-FSR KT800; was thinking about an ASUS (my board of choice) A7V...Deluxe, but I read their were issues with it. Need more research. On alotta boards it says what type of ram it'll accept, e.g. the MSI accepts ddr400, but not clear to me that I'll be running a FSB @ 400 or 800. You'll be among the first I ask, unless you want to impart some wisdom how to easily figure out what is what. Or is it simply a given that when using an AMD 64 with a compatible board, the ram speed is effectively doubled? Right now, my head is spinning; the past week has been a killer for me pc-wise, my ebay idiocy sure didn't help!
4354	13	36920	432268	431570	Brandon Eng	9/15/04 7:58 PM	1.09527828E12	I don't understand, Mark	pc2700 runs at 333 Mhz, right? So if you're running dual channel, you mean to say you have a FSB of 666??? Or am I missing something again? To the best of my understanding, dual-channel is dependent on a memory controller on the chip (and sometimes on the board). The Athlons don't have a dual channel memory controller (far's I know), your board may have a dual channel memory controller, but I don't think you'll get more than a 333 FSB cuz the chip doesn't have the dual channel controller. Now I'm really confoozed!
4354	14	36920	432307	431471	Brandon Eng	9/15/04 8:16 PM	1.09527936E12	Oh, I see why you asked about the dual channel memory	From the specs of my first post. Well, you understand this stuff better than I ever will. I tried to explain my understanding of it to Mark below. The board *accepts* ddr 400, but even I didn't think for a second I'd be running effectively at a 800 fsb. I know there's a memory controller on the 64's, so I guess I have to make sure the board I get *also* runs in dual channel, correct? In my mind, I just don't understand why a 64 compatible board *wouldn't* have an onboard memory controller to take advantage of ddr memory. Alternatively, the 64's *are* the memory controller, and the ram/fsb is automatically, effectively doubled. Am I correct in my thinking? PS: glad this thread has taken a different turn; takes my mind off the original topic, lol.
4354	15	36920	432723	432222	Ray Harinec	9/16/04 5:43 AM	1.09531338E12	The ECS that you bought DOES support	Dual Channel. It has 3 memory sslots which seems wierd but what the hey it's an ECS. LOL So you can only run dual channel on the specific pair of memory sockets designated. Apparently the Nvidia chipset includes handling dual channel memory. I don't think that the interface from the MCH to the CPU is dual though. That's why FSB is max 400 rather than 800 as in Intel mobos. Dual channel operation effectively makes the memory bus 128 bits wide rather than 64. 32 bits times 2 bits per clock with DDR. I went to the ECS site to download the Manual for that mobo but it didn't offer the manual. The mobo data was there. I wanted to read about the weird memory setup. I think that you can use more memory single channel than dual channel because of only 3 slots rather than 2 pairs of slots. Re the 64 bit. Not getting the 939 socket type WILL NOT get you DUAL CHANNEL unless you get the F51 version CPU which also requires registered memory. The standard CPU only has single channel MCH built-in. The beauty of the socket 939 mobo and CPU's is that they all support Dual Channel and neither the standard or the F51's require registered memory. You get Maximum PC don't you??? LOL RTFM LOL I enjoy reading about your computer adventures. I type this on a 7 year old PII 333.
4354	16	36920	432764	432307	Ray Harinec	9/16/04 5:55 AM	1.0953141E12	You are mixing DDR with Dual Channel	two different things. DDR SDRAM is memory that is read on both the leading edge and the trailing edge of the clock thus the term Double Data Rate. All mobo's that use DDR do this. And yes the 64's handle the DDR the same way. [see my other post; they do not ALL support dual channel] Dual channel is where there are two sticks of memory [always DDR at this time] each with its own bus to the memory controller, thus you have 2 32 bit busses each being read twice per clock giving 128 bit effective memory bits of data each clock cycle. [somewhat over simplified].

The post you are responding to here was only to point out to Brandon [you got Wayne on your mind, Speakeasy must be getting to you. LOL] that he was confusing DDR with Dual Channel. The thing that totally baffles me re your mobo manual is the &quot;supports up to 600 MHz for&quot; certain CPU's. I don't know if this is some form of overclocking or ??? I'll have to download the design data on those CPU's from AMD. MSI makes very overclockable mobo's.

Just checked UPS tracking now, and it was reported as damaged and returned to sender. I called the seller, and he had no identical units, and offered a 2600+ and a &quot;similiar&quot; motherboard, so I passed. I asked for a refund if possible. He was trying to negotiate a wait for about a week, but I said I really didn't want to wait, so he agreed to refund me, minus the s/h & insurance. Figger that's fair, since he had to ship it and all that. So I have to eat the ~$20. Worth it to me cuz I really didn't want it anyway and I can stop obsessing over this, lol.

4354	26	36920	434089	432764	Brandon Eng	9/16/04 7:25 PM	1.0953627E12	Dazed and Confused.	OK, I have a decent handle on ddr memory (which you explained to me on the old boards a coupla yrs. ago). Before all this was posted, last night I was surfing for motherboards, and saw some socket 754 boards that run in single channel. Why would someone want a board that runs in single channel w/a A64??? Or is there an inherent benefit with a dual channel board because you've made the memory bus &quot;wider&quot;? But here's how I'm confused: say you have a cpu like an XP Athlon 2000+, no MCH built in; cpu FSB locked at 333, but on a board, like Mark's, that supports dual channel. Does it make any difference whether he's running dual or single channel, if the FSB is locked at 333? I can't say I fully understand dual channel at this point, depite your explanation. E.g, there's no benefit in dual channel if the cpu doesn't have a dual channel controller like Mark's, is that correct? So to reap the full benefits of dual channel, you'd need a MB with a DC controller AND a chip with a built in DC?? Or, again, the benefit is a wider memory bus?? Geesh, I'm confoozed! You get Maximum PC don't you??? LOL RTFM LOL Yep, :P and a REALLY good mag, CPU! My prob is I read a little bit of this and that, file certain things away &quot;for research later&quot; which I never get around to, lol. Here's something I REALLY don't understand re: the A64s: up to at least the A64 3500+ chips, the core operating frequency is 2.2 Ghz, and come in 2 varieties of L2 cache, 512 & 1 meg. WHAT'S THE DIFF?? Is it the fsb? According to the newegg site, it says FSB: Integrated into chip. Sample: http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProduct.asp?submit=property&DEPA=1 Are there different FSBs for each chip?? And I don't understand the L1 cache &quot;64+64&quot;. Do these chips have different integrated FSBs? Guess I should visit the AMD site, which I was gonna do before I dealt with the ebay seller, then checked in on this thread. Well, I've kinda settled on this MSI motherboard: http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=13-130-449&depa=1 . The KT800 will pump ddr 400 to an effective 800 Mhz FSB (think I got THAT right!). I don't think I've seen a socket 754 board with a faster FSB. I don't intend to connect via SATA or have a RAID array; my tech guy is testing an A64 2800 on SATA, and he says he didn't notice any speed gains, otherwise, he says it's really fast compared to his P4 3.0. Sorry for such a long post, but I figger it's easier for everyone if I replied in 1 spot. I enjoy reading about your computer adventures. I'm a regular barrel of monkeys. Just ask my wife! Help, Ray! I've fallen down and can't get up!
4354	27	36920	434126	434089	Brandon Eng	9/16/04 7:50 PM	1.0953642E12	I have a headache	I was just at the AMD site looking for a chart or something to sort out the A64s. There's a forum there also with people equally, if not more confused, than I. Where the heck can I get a chart or something re: the A64s and FSBs? Apparantly there's different FSBs for the A64s, but I couldn't find anything to help me distinguish what from what.

RE FSB on a CPU where the MCH is on the die with the rest of the CPU circuitry. It is a moot or undefined point. One must understand that the digital signals can only be transnitted a short distance over wire or printed circuitry. The signal [very fast rise time (nanosecond) rectangular or square waves] at these high frequencies get badly distorted traveling over a few inches of wire and become useless. The FSB that runs from a separate chipset to the CPU must travel over a few inches of printed circuitry, thus it is limited in speed [we sat at 66 MHz for years until they found ways to go faster]. Same with the memory bus and why memory brands don't all work on all mobo's, memory timing is very tricky at these speeds. Now you see that the CPU's can run at 3 GHz and up. That is because the circuity is connected by virtually zero length wires inside the chip [the output of one transistor is directly connected to the input of the next by plated cidcuitry] [no they are not really only transistors]. Thus if the MCH is put inside the chip the FSB could also run at that 3 GHz plus speed. Now the only limit is the practical one that a new set of data bits to put on the internal FSB cannot be obtained faster than the memory bus can present it, but there really is no need for an FSB since the data is presented within the CPU die already. So FSB then loses any meaningful definition. The fact that some cache was also put on the CPU die starting a few years ago was also one of the causes of increased CPU speed performance. It's basically the laws of physics related to high speed Transmissiuon Lines

[Intel now simply calls the Northbridge the MCH and the Southbridge the IOCH IO Controller Hub Thus instead of 32 bits of DDR data per clock [64 data bits because DDR's 2 reads per clock] you have another 32 data lines 64 bits also clocked at the same time. Thus there is 128 bits of data available each clock cycle compared to the normal 64 bits of data. In the case of the 32 bit AMD's there is only one set of 32 data lines to the CPU so the MCH has to stage the data to the CPU. The Intel P4's have two 32 bit data lines from the MCH to the CPU thus it's FSB can be 800 MHz while the AMD is only 400 MHz. The fact that AMD's perform on a par with Inel's [maybe better], is the internal achitecture of the CPU not the FSB speed. There are a number of articles that tend to show that Dual Channel may not really buy a heck of a lot of speed advantage [down in the single digit %]

The standard CPU's were single channel MCH on the CPU, and 500 cache and did not require registered memory. The FX51 series CPU for that mobo have the Dual Channel MCH on the CPU and 1 meg onboard cache AND the FX51 version required registered memory. [in the 939 socket that is no longer true]. Basically for the socket 939 CPU's the only difference is that the FX51 version for that socket has 1 meg of onboard cache, the regular still only 500K onboard cache. Remember the CPU can be access memory on the chip [onboard cache] far faster than the CPU can fetch it from the normal memory. In general more onboard cache [everything else equal] faster performance. I'm sure that there is a limit to that statement.
4354	34	36920	435694	434089	Ray Harinec	9/17/04 12:39 PM	1.09542474E12	SATA. Possibly your techs	are missing the growth issue. IDE has run out of steam at ATA 133. SATA has just started at 133 [approx]. Yes it has been reported for some time that current SATA drives are NOT faster than the IDE's, HOWEVER it has just started ino its growth phase and will soon be far faster. Intel doesn't even bother supporting ATA 133 on there mobo's they stop at ATA100 because SATA is the way to go for growth. Same re the 939 socket AMD will continue to make faster CPU's for that socket. They claim that they will continue to &quot;support&quot; the socket 754. [they can't afford to continue developing two lines of CPU, especially if you read Robert Proffitts inputs re the dual 64 bit CPU's coming]. Both Intel and AMD have seen that dual CPU's in one package will be far superior [when the software to match gets fully implemented] Also getting rid of the d----d ribon cable cables and trying to put two drives on one ribbon bable is a PITA. Don't pooh pooh RAID EXCEPT be sure to get a mobo where the RAID controller can also be used for ATA and ATAPI drives. Last time I looked the MSI controller would handle RAID and ATA but NOT ATAPI. The Gigabyte controller handles RAID, ATA, and ATAPI. There are so many details to consider when selecting a mobo. But the tomshardware and anandtech articles give all the details. More RTFA LOL You seem to be looking to make a future buy but listen to info from your techs on current hardware. BTW DDR2 and PCI Express are in the same boat, offer little now [except higher cost LOL], but next year may be the way to go.
4354	35	36920	435740	434089	Ray Harinec	9/17/04 1:14 PM	1.09542684E12	Minor point	I don't believe that the AMD FSB's are &quot;Locked&quot; the Multipliers are Locked, so that the only way to over clock is to increase the FSB by increasing the speed of the memory bus. A number of mobo's support overclocking by giving the ability to increment the memory bus in 1 MHz steps and control the various CPU voltages incrementally. I did read that Intel was going to somehow limit the CPU speed. Guess that locking the FSB would be one way, but with the FSB control in the MCH I'm not sure how that would be done.
4354	36	36920	436849	435577	Brandon Eng	9/18/04 7:34 AM	1.09549284E12	Well, gee, Ray. THAT was simple!	NOT! I'm just reading (perusing, more like it) your responses for the first time right now. I think I understand Nietche better than that stuff! My head has been spinning for quite awhile, reading about all the chipset (both for Intel and AMD; was considering a P4 for awhile. Decided not going that way), which has totally fried my brains. I'll have to come back to this. Can you answer this though? I've been to AMDs website, trying to figure out how the core frequency speeds for the A64s are the same (2.2 Ghz) for the 3500+s and below I think, but don't understand the difference 'tween say an A64 2800+ and a A64 3500+ when they apparently have the same specs. Found an area, more like an advertisement, where it says the A64's support FSB up to something like 1000+, but I can't find anything on WHICH particular chips does exactly what! Also, as I said in another post, I haven't found an A64 motherboard that supports a FSB above 800 Mhz! I'm not going to be spending more than $300 for the really high end chips; however, the more I read about the socket 939 you've mentioned, I just *may* go that way...but those chips are pretty expensive. Will bbl. Thanks much!
4354	37	36920	436907	436849	Ray Harinec	9/18/04 8:55 AM	1.0954977E12	One is easy. With the MCH on the CPU die	the term FSB has no real meaning because, as I said, the circuitry within the chip can effectively run as fast as the rest of the CPU interior [3 plus GHz]. [the result of very, wery, very, short physical path for the signals to flow over]. The FSB is the output of the MCH, so what's to limit it or define it?? It'll be the internal CPU design to pass the data to and from the memory bus that'll make the speed. Probably some form of high speed cache/buffering at the MCH output I am not sure about the evolution of the 64 chips. I believe it is basically that they started with two basic CPU versions, the standard and the F51's. F51's were the hi line with dual channel et al. My thoughts are that since then they have been adding things/architecture to the standard that weren't in the early models to bring it closer to the F51's and then in the F51 eliminating the need for registered memory. The difference, now, between the two, in the 939 socket versions, is the difference in the size of the cache. Remember the gimmick that AMD uses to give the 3000+, 3500+ numbers which are NOT the speed numbers. It is supposed to be the clock speed that an Intel CPU would have to give the same performance. Both Intel and AMD know that, except for advertising purposes, clock speed is NOT the be all and end all for performance. Intel has even changed their naming system such that the clock speed is no longer included in the model of the CPU. The faster performance is acheived by the design architecture of the CPU. There is no single architecture that is best for all possible applications. That is why an Intel will out perform an AMD for some applications and vice versa for other applications. AMD tends to be better in gaming. For example the long processing pipeline that Intel initially bragged about, turns out to be somewhat of a bottleneck for some apllications. AMD has a little shorter pipeline and different architecture to carry on more operations in parallel. At this time,CPU design is in such a state of flux there's no sure way to know what to do. I say use the 939 because that has reasonable hope to be around for two years. Intel has been constantly revising their roadmap. The AMD success with the 64's caught them off guard. Just think a CPU for which no Operating System existed turns out to be a success.[Brilliant design by AMD has it running 32 bit code as well as any 32 bit machine] The detailed info about the AMD's as well as for Intel CPU's is available in the design documentation available by download from the respective sites. They are PDF files and really tough to read. I look at them and maybe understand 2 per cent of the info. I mainly save the speed per CPU and Power consumption per CPU info. None of them say in simple English that, this CPU has this set of features and this one has this other set of features. It is also confusing that there can be 3 versions of a CPU that is called 2800+. Engineers don't like to dummy it up for management because then everyone could understand it and they'd get a pay reduction. I was a Deparment Manager of a Systems Engineering Group in Electronic Countermeasures when I retired, so I know how much I really didn't know or understand, but never let on. LOL
4354	38	36920	436925	436849	Ray Harinec	9/18/04 9:12 AM	1.09549872E12	Maybe another way is to saythat for the AMD 64's	the mobo has nothing to do with the FSB except to provide a fast enough memory bus to provide data fast enough to feed the MCH. As the CPU design progresses the output of the MCH [the FSB] speeds will be able to utilize faster memory bus speeds. That's when DDR2 will phase in. DDR is over 500 MHz now but running out of growth capability.
4354	39	36920	437115	436907	Brandon Eng	9/18/04 11:46 AM	1.09550796E12	Getting (a VERY) small handle on this	the term FSB has no real meaning because, as I said, the circuitry within the chip can effectively run as fast as the rest of the CPU interior [3 plus GHz]. [the result of very, wery, very, short physical path for the signals to flow over]. OK, I think I have a reasonable grasp of this, as I've been all over the place reading up on this. Hmmm...I've just visited newegg, and there seems to be a bit of a change regarding core clock speeds. Everything's not 2.2...1.8 and goes up accordingly. Maybe the simplest thing to do instead of trying to understand all this, is settle on a chip, see what boards support it, and go from there. My tech guy suggested the A64 2800 w/512 cache, but I understand the 1 meg cache makes a HUGE difference (how huge, who knows? lol- I get this stuff from the net.) At first, I was thinking of the A64 3200+ with the MSI board I posted somewhere here. Definitely not going for 1 of the FX chips, that would be insanity on my part. Part of the question now is timing- there's debate whether the chips will go down in price or not. There seems to be big demand for them and supply can be short. Even the Ebay guy I spoke to told me he has a hard time getting these chips, as my techie does. Just as well, I need my head to clear out before I do something REALLY impulsive and stupid. Thanks so much for your insight and knowledge Ray. I'll muddle through, as usual, lol. Hey, on a different note, I got an Honorable Mention in the question of the week from Lee. I don't know if you get it in your email, but last week I got CNet mail with a question of the week I attempted to answer. The most acceptable answer get the responder some kind of CD or something.

4354	43	36920	438842	437194	Brandon Eng	9/19/04 6:49 PM	1.09561974E12	I have a great idea, Ray!	YOU get the socket 939, and report back. You have all the know-how, so you're the perfect person for this! Last night, I spent about 4 hrs. on the net reading about socket types, chipsets, etc. and come to a couple of conclusions: It's a mystery to everyone what the architecture of the A64's are, but they're really FAST; writers from mags like MaxPC, CPU, The Register, all think the 64 is the greatest thing since the wheel, fill pages in articles, but don't REALLY know why, except it's FAST, and beats Intel. As you said, there's no FSB in the chip, but there's a memory controller in the higher-end chips!. Dual channel isn't all it's cracked up to be. There's rumors that that the A64's as they are now, will be phased out, for yet another socket type (but no one knows who's going to make the boards to support them- rumors are they're in cahoots with NVidia.) The market for the A64s are really gamers, who are generally insane (include myself in that group.) AMD is deliberately keeping availability of chips low to justify the prices on the high end chips (and even the Athlon chips) before they move to the next level of chips (whatever that may be.) These rumors may be spread by AMD itself, while testing the waters of sales of the 64's. There's still plenty of interest in the Athlon chips, that's why prices have remained pretty steady. Intel either has something up it's sleeve re:64 bit procs, or simply is counting on MS to spend the next few yrs. to come out with a resonably working Longhorn. The beta version is available, so why don't we hear anything from Intel, other than their &quot;quad-pumping&quot; P4s? (btw, I hear you can get a beta version of Longhorn in Malaysia for $2 US!) Microsoft is deliberately witholding the release of Longhorn, because the world is pissed off at them with their endless &quot;patches&quot;, and &quot;Service Packs&quot;. *I* certainly wont pay for Longhorn, you can bet on that. I'll get my license from work, like a good American- I have a friend in the IT dept. and they have licenses up the wazoo! MS is concerned that people wont spend their hard earned money for yet *another* version of Windows, and more than that, people couldn't care less about a 64 bit OS, and have great reluctance in upgrading all their software (backward compatibility or not, MS will manage to screw things up so much that people will stick with XP or even 98.) I was thinking of &quot;future-proofing&quot; my next upgrade, but, in truth, all I want is raw SPEED for my video projects, and games. I was thinking about about this while tweaking my daughter's system with a cheapie Biostar micro-atx board, and an Intel 2.4 Celeron-D processor w/a 400 Mhz fsb. I've tweaked it so much I can play Far Cry and Grand Theft Auto with barely a hiccup, using my old ti4200 vid card. It boots in about 30 secs. I have to say I'm impressed with such a cheapie setup. I raised the benchmark from pcpitstop from under 1000 to over 1100. So I'm thinking of the cost/benefit ratio. Do I spend upwards of $300 for an A64, or use that money for a high-end Barton, decent motherboard, and some extra ram? How many software vendors will be writing 64 bit apps? I suspect the gaming companies will, but do they want to alienate those customers with P4 rigs? Hmmm...decisions, decisions. OK, Ray- Are YOU going to upgrade to an A64?
4354	44	36920	438861	436925	Brandon Eng	9/19/04 7:01 PM	1.09562046E12	I finally figure that out from all my reading last nite.	And I really did spend hrs. reading about all of this stuff. My previous post was a bit tongue in cheek, but it *was* based much on everything I read. The rumors from some message boards may be taken with a grain of salt, or maybe not? Sales on retail computers have really bottomed out, and you can get a very decent system for &lt;$500. Just after I got all the parts to fix up my daughter's system, I got an email from tigerdirect for a refurbed e-machine, that had something like a 3200+ Barton, 512 ram, 160 gig HD, and a DVD-RW; cost: $300! I'm getting so tired of upgrading and digging into the guts of my systems, I think I would have bought the system; just to gut the system for parts and the chip would have been worth it to me. As for DDR2, pci Express.....I don't even want to think about it, lol. All I've been thinking about lately is &quot;Barton, A64?&quot; Now, it's &quot;Barton, A64, P4, refurbed?&quot; Oy!

Then I get a call from security there's a box waiting for me. I got the chip and the motherboard! The cardboard box was slightly dented, but everything inside seemded well protected by what looked like plastic air pillows. The amd chip looks like it is in fact retail, encased in plastic. The board wasn't externally wrapped, but the motherboard itself was covered in plastic with a seal to close it. I've emailed the vendor, but gotten no reply yet. The board supports a 400 Mhz bus, but the 2800+ only goes up to 333. Aaack! What to do, what to do. Guess I'll try calling the vendor.

Aaargh	Well, contacted vendor, he's arranging to send me a pre-paid ups box. If I'm gonna have a board that supports 400 Mhz, then I want a chip to match. The 3000+ chip on newegg is about $140 w/512 cache. Bet that really rocks. BUT I DON'T HAVE A MOTHERBOARD WITH A 400 FSB, 'CEPT MY DAUGHTER'S! Her system is faster than mine. Arrrrgh!
4354	55	36920	441691	441646	Ray Harinec	9/21/04 5:18 PM	1.09578708E12	Check with newegg. I got the soyo for $54	Not particularly recommending it because I have no reason to. No reason to not recommend it either. It really depends on what extra features that you want. Don't need RAID [I know that you didn't want it]. Nov issue of Max PC has tests to show that RAID adds nothing to gaming and a single drive is frequently faster for gamimg.
4354	56	36920	441714	441646	Ray Harinec	9/21/04 5:35 PM	1.0957881E12	They have a bunch in the $40 to $50 range.	Be careful to not get microATX types [unless that's what you want]. Note that if you do a search on socket A types there are some non 400 higher priced than 400's . They are in increasing price, not increasing speed
4354	57	36920	441733	441691	Brandon Eng	9/21/04 5:48 PM	1.09578888E12	heh, heh,....You'll like this Ray....	My next upgrade will be an A64. I figure, if the high end Athlon XPs are about the same as low end A64s, I may as well go for the A64. My brain is so discombobulated from the last coupla weeks, I have to start with a clear head. From everything I've read, as far as the motherboard, MSI's Neo-something is the best board (Asus seems to have issues). Has RAID and SATA; understand RAID to limited degree, but that's a future project for research. I just want RAW SPEED! Did I mention my daughter's system is almost as fast as mine with a 2.4 Celeron-D? Well, I found out that this chip isn'y recommended for for her Biostar motherboard, so my techies are ordering a 2.8 Celeron-D for me (will have to pay the difference in price.) THEN I think her system will definitely be faster, if the pcpitstops benchmarks are to be believed. Don't know when I'll be doing the upgrade; my techies tell me to wait for prices to drop, and I'm not sure that's going to happen anytime soon. They're having trouble even getting the chips. So I'll monitor newegg, and some other sites. May even go barebones, I think at the Monarch site I saw some decent barebones A64 systems. One thing I really, really hate about building computers is pinning the motherboard. I'm really paranoid about putting a PS connection to something like an audio header- something I did years back on my first build. Will keep you posted.

Quite impressed with it's performance. If the A64 prices remain steady, I may just say the heck with it and go for a P4; I was amazed at how simple it was in installing the heatsink/fan. As you know, with the AMDs, you practically push through the board to snap on the HS/fan. I'm surprised I haven't punched a hole in the mobo during my numerous upgrades. Off to surf newegg, heh, heh.

4354	61	36920	441798	441733	Ray Harinec	9/21/04 6:29 PM	1.09579134E12	I'll be watching. BUT	Whatever you do for any mobo. Go to the mfr's site's forums. The earlier MSI NEO mobo for the P4 875 chipset got raves in anandtech forums. The mobo became a disaster when a string of BIOS updates to correct performance problems actually damaged the mobo's. Took many month's to get a safe BIOS for it and anand's rating dropped to the real world. Think that it was the 7th BIOS change that actually got things working. Not criticizing MSI [had ordered it and sent it back to newegg and asked for refund to buy the gigabyte. When I referred them to the problems they exchanged for me]. The giga was considerably higher price though. Again not picking on MSI, any of these new high performance mobo's have many problems with various brands of memory. The users forum really let one see how many problems the mobo is having. I looked at the forum for the MSI that you mention. See a number of problems BUT I didn't check any others. For all I know they are having more problems. And again if you don't get a socket 939 A64 as opposed to the socket 754 or 940[ which is older than the 939, but I'm not sure that they ever released the 940] I would think that you are missing the point of why that socket type is really the only solution for using the lower cost CPU of that socket type. I think that you are correct about prices not dropping. One reason is that Intel still doesn't offer anything really competitive so no reason for AMD to drop prices.
4354	62	36920	441953	441760	Brandon Eng	9/21/04 8:59 PM	1.09580034E12	I just configured an A64 system at Monarch	for an A64 3500+, MSI 939 board(forget which model), PSU, 1 gig Corsair ram, suggested thermal grease, and a Lian case. Cost? 2 grand! I'm gonna hafta rethink this whole thing, lol. No way am I gonna spend 2 grand for an &quot;upgrade&quot;! So I may be back to square 1 with what my techie recommended: he likes the MSI K8T NEO-FSR 754 board, 2800 chip; not the MSI..Platinum(?) board I see on many other forums. He tests for stability first and foremost. I also need to make sure I get the right PSU, I've been reading you need &quot;12v (or amps)on the [something] rail&quot;- have NO idea what that means, lol. The more I read the more confused I get. I'm bound to upgrade w/in 2 yrs. or less judging from my past history. Who knows what Intel's gonna do? I just don't get why they're silent on a 64 bit chip. The ease of installing the heatsink is worth my switching sides, lol. btw, got in touch with the vendor from ebay. He's gonna send me a prepaid ups box to send the stuff back to him.

Did you simply upgrade, or buy a whole new system? Y'know, the more I look at the seperate parts, and the cost of shipping, it very nearly equals the cost of complete systems my tech guy builds.

4354	71	36920	442530	442276	Ray Harinec	9/22/04 8:27 AM	1.09584162E12	Re the power supply &quot;rails&quot;	A rail [voltage regulator output]exists for each of the separate voltage regulators within the power supply ie +5 volts, 3.3 volts 12 volts [forget the minus voltages they are no longer used]. Each rail has large capacitors on it to absorb [filter] the noise created by instantaneous variations of the load current. The CPU's a few years ago drew power from the 3.3 volt rail. Now they draw their power from the 12 rail The ATX 12V power supplies all have a 4 pin connector with 12 volts that plugs into a socket on the mobo near the CPU. Many ATX 12V Power Supplies simply have this 12 volts connected to the same 12 volt regulator in the Power Supply that goes to the main power mobo connector for hard drives et al.. The problem is that the CPU puts a lot of noise and spikes on the 12 volt line while the other users put other noise on it. Thus the better power Supplies have put two separate 12 volt regulators [rails] in the Power Supply. One feeds the 4 pin 12 volts to the CPU and the other feeds all of the other 12 volt loads. Then each noise source gets appropriate filtering without mixing the two, and can use smaller size capacitors..

In 1962	I inherited the job as the systems emgineer responsible for ground power supplies for the Wing 6 Minuteman missiles. Knew nothing about power supplies. Relied on the Power Supply design people to teach me. Never once heard them use the word rails. Saw it the first time in these forums. Intel uses it in some of their specs when they describe the way the turn on is done in ATX systems. I really do prefer Power Supply Output . BTW it was the first use of switching power supplies in that system. Boy did we have a lot to learn. Never thought that switching supplies would get to be as good as they are now.

No problems with reliable L, the large capaciance electrolytic capacitors do deteriorate over time, plus there was the problem with the defective electrolyte material used due to an error in the theft of the formula for it that got used by many capacitor mfr's. None accept responsibility or will tell which batches the bad stuff was used in. That problem seems to have passed for recently built equipment.

BUT	And again if you don't get a socket 939 A64 as opposed to the socket 754 or 940[ which is older than the 939, but I'm not sure that they ever released the 940] I would think that you are missing the point of why that socket type is really the only solution for using the lower cost CPU of that socket type. Do you mean that by using the 939 I'd be &quot;future-proofing&quot;, as the 754s are on their way out? That's my take on the situation. Well, I spoke to my tech guy, and he's telling me I still should wait. At this point, I don't know what I should do. I still have the ECS board and 2800 Barton from the ebay guy; spoke to him, and he's trying to figure out how I should get the stuff back to him (or he's probably trying to stay outta trouble with his boss). If I had an extra case, I'd probably slap the motherboard and cpu in. The ECS board supports a 400 Mhz fsb, but the 2800 Barton only goes up to 333. So, I'm thinking, maybe I should get a case, 512-1 gig of pc3200 ram, and simply wait for the prices of both motherboards and A64 chips to go down. I've been reading so much about the A64s, compatible boards, and now the PSUs even have me confused. I can't be quoted verbatim about the 12v rail, could have been something like 20(something)amps, volts, I'm not sure. So, again, how much of a speed bump you think I'd get going from a 2000+ @266 FSB to 2800+ @333 FSB (w/double the cache @ 512)? Mebbe I can cut a deal with the ebay vendor to just keep the Barton chip, as I have no use for the ECS board. My existing Asus board (which I really like) supports 333 fsb. I figure I'd get pc3200 ram anyway, as I'd probably need it for the future A64 system. And here's something new: if you look at the tigerdirect site, you'll see all the A64s &quot;with 1600 Mhz FSB&quot;. I looked at a few compatible boards with K8T800 chipset, which I thought only supported a FSB of 800. So is this some kind of marketing ploy? I'm trying to make an intellegent decision (for once), but the more I read, the more frustrated I get. At the moment, I just want raw speed. My existing system has served me well, but it takes forever to render a video, and even with the upgrade to an FX5900 XT vid card, I figure the bottleneck must be the chip and my 266 FSB (and it REALLY bugs me that my daughter's system is faster on a micro-atx board with a 2.4 Celeron! (soon to be a 2.8; I pointed out to my techie, that Biostar recommends a 2.8; I spoke to Intel, and they suggested I go with the 2.8 cuz the voltage difference can ultimately fry the board AND chip. Aacck...this whole thing is giving me a migraine.
4354	77	36920	444861	444793	Ray Harinec	9/23/04 4:54 PM	1.09595844E12	Some discussion.	As you now know the term FSB is essentially meaningless when the MCH is on the CPU die. Only the 939 socket standard 64's have Dual Channel MCH all earlier socket types standard CPU's were single channel only the FX [double the price] versions had dual channel for those socket types. [probably said this five times already]. Nothging wrong with your tech guys idea to wait. Wait too long and you'll be swamped with all the new hardware advances [DDR2, PCI Express, new chipsets from Intel, and the new BTX cases] then the choices would simply say FORGET IT LOL. Remember the 800 MHz FSB chipset for mobo's was when they thought tha AMD might bring out a CPU that supports an 800 mHz interface. In the 64's when AMD put the MCH in the CPU, the mobo still supports an 800 MHz CPU, just none exist in The AMD CPU line but they do in Intel and a variant of that chipset is on mobo's for Intel CPU's. [although IMHO if I went Intel I would use an Intel Chipset]. The only original way that VIA and NVIDIA got their chipsets in mobo's for Intel CPU's was when Intel dogmatically insisted on sticking with Rambus memory. Intel tried unsuccessfully to stop VIA and NVIDIA from supporting Intel CPU's. Obviously Intel finally saw the light and went to DDR memory. I have no feel for the speed bump. I only read about things and get input from a power user friend. I have never played a game on a PC [I'm afraid I would be embarrassed by my hand eye coordination/ lack thereof]. Don't buy PC3200 RAM now unless you will use it at 200/400, because in the very near term you'll wantPC 3700 or even faster when you go for the A64. [although sometimes you can get the PC3200 at a lower price than the PC 2700. I got a 512 MB Mushkin 3200 for $75 from newegg a week ago. It's back up to $80. But it is only CL3. If you want to see what the better Mushkin CL2.5 or CL 2 look in the Mushkin site. DDR memory now when you get into the lower memory cycle latencies is a subject all unto itself. The faster stuff is far more expensive. What you are paying for at the cost of the memory and the mobo that can run it, is at most a 5% speed boost. Only the really avid gamers go for this stuff. Others with the money go for it to say they have the best while they may not even have the BIOS set to have the memory run at the lowest latency. Easy to get carried away. There is no question that double the amount of L2 cache gives better speed. I don't even bother to look at Tiger Direct anymore. Virtually all of there stuff is overstock they bought that didn't sell. The text that they state is often in error or pure BS IMHO.
4354	78	36920	444901	444793	Ray Harinec	9/23/04 5:17 PM	1.09595982E12	To see a power supply which lists two +12volt	outputs check in newegg for the Antec480 NeoPower. Just an example so you know how to find those with two 12 volt rails. DO NOT get confused with those that show a +12 v and then a - 12 volt @ 1 amp. I picked this one for you to look at because of its other big feature, the cables. [active PFC is also a plus]. When you get into the big bucks get this one LOL Just for info look at it pictures. All if the cables except the main power cable to the mobo are separate and plug in to the Power Supply. Thus you only use the cables for which you have use for. Saves beaucour cable clutter and allows more room for airflow in the case. It's not cheap $115 after $15 immediate rebate LOL. I would think that it will be the next advance in computer power supplies. I put one of their true power 430's in a simple system and had a huge bundle of unused cables that I had a heckuva time keeping out of the way.

The beauty of the A64 is the &quot;hyper-transport&quot; which is suppose to take care of the i/o bottle-neck problem. The 1600mhz maybe referring to the fx53 series (which is the most expensive and notice there are no mention of FSB at all. Just guessing here.

He has ONE A64 2800 chip for a socket 754, and is still advising me to simply wait. So he's not stocking any 939 boards. If his shop is any barometer, it doesn't seem like his fairly large client base is running towards A64. He's doing quite well selling P4 systems. I'm not that interested in pci Express and DDR2; I generally don't like first generation technologies, as there's always bugs to be worked out. I received an email from extremetech (I think), and the writer concluded that the AGP slot will be around for a few yrs. NVidia's SLI technology for vid cards has it's appeal mostly to hardcore gamers; not interested in that either. Don't care for SATA (as it is now), nor RAID- my brain is overtaxed as it is, and I don't want to spend time learning something I've happily lived w/out. I just want a stable A64 system, with the attendent speed that comes along with it (at this rate, I just may go Intel :::gasp:::- but not seriously, as there's no 64 bit Intel chip ('cept for Xeon??)- but a part of me is also thinking, who knows when Longhorn will be released (not that I truly care, I believe to some degree that programmers will somehow write 64 bit programs that will somehow be 32 bit compatible. I'm thinking from a business standpoint- Intel has over 90% of the market on cpu's; Dell has the lion's share of the market on retail computers (most, if not all, with Intel processors)- what are all these people going to do if/when longhorn is released? Does MS really believe everyone is going to spend money on yet another version of Windows AND upgrade their processors? Doesn't compute well in my opinion. I'm a HUGE AMD fan, but at what cost for an upgrade? I'm getting tired of spending in excess of a grand every year or so. SO- I'm heading off to newegg again (LOL) to see what kind of system I can theoretically put together. I really don't like the idea of buying motherboards online, as there seems to be a high RMA rate. I use newegg as a benchmark for prices, and the reviews can be informative. I look at tigerdirect to compare prices; once in a blue moon tiger will have the same product on sale. I bought 2 spindles of DVD+R discs at 1/2 the price newegg was selling at. And I do agree that Tiger's site is filled with BS. Well, I guess I'll just hurry up and wait- but getting VERY impatient; I'm upgrading my daughter's system with a 2.8 Celeron-D chip. Maybe I'll just swap out my hardware for hers, heh, heh. This chip can run at a 533 Mhz fsb if the box is to be believed; I don't even know what kind ram 533 is, lol

I was simply pointing out that by waiting, whether you like it or not, they may become items that you might have to consider at the time when looking for the best performance. I haven't heard of that many DOA's of mobo's. Lots of cases where it was the first time that the person had ever built a computer and made any one of the errors that can be made. Good luck on your search for a computer to outperform your Daughter's. LOL I'll bet that she enjoys this.

I'm sure your point was to simply point out the possible benefits of waiting, and pointing out technologies I may not have known about. LOL-my daughter (more importantly, my WIFE), has no idea what I'm doing computer-wise. They just know I'm constantly tinkering. This is going to be an ongoing saga at this rate. I'M JUST REALLY ANNOYED THAT MY 11 YR. OLD DAUGHTER HAS A FASTER SYSTEM THAN I, AND ALL SHE DOES IS GO ON AOL! Arrrggh!

Considering the fact that i bought the same exact mobo combo 3 weeks ago from Fry's for 90.00, and the dual channel ram, (doubles your bandwith) for 45.00 each stick (must use two), i'd say: sell the 2 gig stuff and upgrade, already!
4354	89	36920	447874	447391	Brandon Eng	9/25/04 7:46 AM	1.09609836E12	I just may do that.	This bundle must be popular (the 2800 + the ECS board), as I've seen it all over the net, 'specially at Fry's (but I read alotta rants about Fry's selling bad mobos.) Well, I just may do that in the meantime. I just prefer to buy my motherboards from a local guy; if anything goes wrong, I'm too lazy to RMA stuff, send it back it wait for a replacement. So, I still have the 2800 Barton and the ECS board (why would they sell a chip w/a 333 FSB when the board supports 400?) Anyway, if you've read through this long and tortuous post, you'd know that the ebay seller refunded my $$, BUT sent the stuff anyway. I've contacted him, and maybe we can work out a deal, or just pay him the $124, I had to eat the shipping of $20 as part of the refund. I figger, I got it, may as well use it while trying to figure out what to do. My own system has an Asus A7V8X-X board that only runs up to a 333 FSB, so I just may pop the chip in there and upgrade the ddr 266 ram with pc3200; figure I can use the ram for a different upgrade. What I'll do with the ECS board, I dunno. Maybe sell it on ebay, lol. But you can get it online in some places for $29. Still, having the chip at that price isn't bad. Guess I'll have to make do. I'm tired of obsessing over this thing (and prob. tiring Ray out, lol.) How's your system running, btw? What type of ram did you use?
