hi, i'm having constant lag spikes.
i use dpc latency checker  on both my desktop (using pci wifi card) and my laptop i have lag spikes.
this is a screenshot of the spikes  .
although it says its my hardware problems, i doubt its true, as it happens on both devices.
as a gamer this is truly irritating.
do you have any idea how to fix this problem?
