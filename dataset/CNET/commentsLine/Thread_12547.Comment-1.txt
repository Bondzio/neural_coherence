i'm sort of in a jam.
i'm looking to buy a printer and scanner for various uses (printing plain documents from word processing and the internet), as well as scanning documents, photo prints, and negatives.
thing is, i'd eventually like to print photo-quality prints from photographs i will scan.
initially, i thought, ''well, go with an all-in-one photo printer.''
but then i wondered if i would be also to use such a printer for regular prints from word processing and such?
and if so, is this cost effective?
or would it be better to buy the one multifunction printer (that just prints, scans, and copies regular documents, not photos), and buy a small photo printer on the side?
