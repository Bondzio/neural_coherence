<s> I recently decided to go and purchase an iMac because my 3 year old compaq desktop is truely outdated. </s>
<s> But now I discovered that Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) is on the way. </s>
<s> Do you think that a new iMac or Macbook will debue with OS X 10.6 when it is released next year? </s>
<s> Should I buy my iMac now or wait? </s>
<s> Thank you for your advice! </s>
<s> RSN (real soon now) is a devilish issue. </s>
<s> I'm going to tell you to wait until you can't wait no more. </s>
<s> I saved my neighbor's laptop about 5 times and during that time we saw the passing of those horrid Pentium 4 laptops and the arrival of the Centrino and more MHz to the GHz. </s>
<s> By hanging in one more year they not only extended their old laptop by that long but added 2 years to their next laptop's life by skipping what was then being offered. </s>
<s> When you can't wait anymore, then pull the trigger. </s>

<s> You can count on there being new models whenever a new OS ships. </s>
<s> If the Compaq is annoying, it'd be fine to replace with iMac now. </s>
<s> They've recently been renewed, in the sense of getting bigger drives and faster CPUs. </s>
<s> Also a lot of people who run Leopard upgraded from earlier versions, so I'd be willing to wager an upgrade to 10.6 from 10.5.x will be available and pretty easy. </s>
