For last few months it has started to make rattling noise when i start the computer; the noise dies out in 5-6 minutes after being started. I was told to clean the fan, which I had with reduction in the noise. I was told it could be dying hard drive too. But if it was a hard drive problem then why the noise is better after i cleaned the fan?? My questions are: 1) Is there a good free software to check out my hard drive. I do have A Norton System 2001. 2) Should I replace the fans? Which ones first? Where can I buy in stores? 3)If hard drive needs to changed, should I get form dell or can i use other brands?? THnx a lot Supermoe

Put them on a floppy and thjey will check the drive. If you improved the noise by cleaning the fan before, the fan may be [likely is] a crappy sleeve bearinf type and the bearing is worn and the fan wobbles. replace it with a ball bearing/dual ball bearing type.

Also, thr power supply fan can be the same way, so verify its working plus *all* fans. As for HDs, you can add any HD vendors model. Dell, has a help guide to &quot;upgrade&quot; adding a 2nd HD, but use that as if installing a new replacement HD. If the HD happens to be under warranty use that. You can leave the side cover off to help pin-point the noise source. tada -----Willy
