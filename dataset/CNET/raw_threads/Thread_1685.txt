I have a wifi router that communicates with one computer but not another. what is strange is, my dv1432us hp laptop cannot &quot;hear&quot; the wifi a foot away, but a desktop with a cheap usb wifi dongle in the back can communicate with the wifi router from the basement. I have tried turning off zone alarm, no go. the ethernet wire out of the wifi router gives great internet connection to the laptop. the laptop wif works otherwise, I can get wifi anywhere else, including hotels and airports, and even the next door neighbor when rcn poops out. so the internet wiring system is a rcn wire into a d-link dcm-202 modem, that runs a wire to a vonage phone router, and that outputs to a netgear wgr614 v6 wifi router. my laptop runs win xp. and it used to communicate fine with the wifi router but hasn't for months. all i can think of is that i need to change the &quot;channel&quot; on the router? not skilled enough to understand that stuff. help! thanks!!! - fj
