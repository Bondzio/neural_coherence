1.1.1	At the moment this is what my System Properties say my computer is like : Hewlett-Packard Company Compaq Presario AMD Athlon ( tm ) 64 Processor 3200+ 1.99 GHz , 2.50 GB of RAM My Graphics Card is : NVIDIA GeForce FX 5200 I was thinking of upgrading my graphics card to this : http : //www.play.com/PC/PCs/4-/8055665/Gigabyte-Radeon-HD-4550-512MB-DDR3-PCI-E-Graphics-Card/Product.html and was just wondering about upgrading my processor , how I would go about doing this and what to look for .	St
1.1.2	Or if it was not necessary ?	Ques
1.1.3	I just generally want to speed up my pc , and obviously make the graphics better .	St
1.2.1	for that graphics card .	St
1.3.1	Getting a better card will handle the video aspects far better and in general take some of the cpu duties within the gpu , thus allowing the system overall to be better up to a point .	St
1.3.2	Replacing the cpu in a OEM type system can be tricky .	St
1.3.3	Systems like Dell , Compaq , etc. , are made to support that system level .	St
1.3.4	The bios may not readily or easily accept a newer cpu , though it can actually be replaced .	St
1.3.5	The system may not & quot ; auto setup & quot ; or you need to manually enter values to support it .	St
1.3.6	-OR- installing it just works .	St
1.3.7	HP systems on this regard can be too picky .	St
1.3.8	The point being it 's a & quot ; go or no go & quot ; situation , the choice it yours .	St
1.3.9	Providing the new cpu fits the specs of the cpu socket and falls in the cpu class that mtrbd .	St
1.3.10	supports , you have a good chance it will work .	St
1.3.11	Notice , I can not give a definite answer , that 's the nature of your problem .	St
1.3.12	It becomes obvious you need someone who has already done this for your HP model # and reports yes or no .	St

1.4.3	( as this is my primary concern ) I regularly play World Of Warcraft and have to have lowest possible video settings and occasionally play Football Manager 2009 and this also runs very slowly ( due to the 3D match engine )	St
1.5.1	Thanks for the reply helped me understand a few things	St
1.6.1	Which would be better out of these two : http : //www.dabs.com/products/xfx-geforce-9500gt-550mhz-1gb-ddr2-pci-express-dvi-59J4.html # description http : //www.misco.co.uk/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp ? EdpNo=362980 & Tab=0 & NoMapp=0 or are there better ones you could recommend to me for around the same price but still PCI-E and compatible with my machine	Ques
1.7.1	your power supply is robust enough to support the new video card ... I saw one XFX 9500GT and it indicated you need a 350 watt PSU .	St
1.7.2	Power requirements vary slightly with each card ... .brand and model .	St
1.7.3	VAPCMD	St
1.8.1	do I find that out ?	Ques
