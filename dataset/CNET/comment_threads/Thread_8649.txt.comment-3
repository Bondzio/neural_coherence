Sandisk usually has good quality, but it is generally up to your preference as to which brands you prefer.
Some people, for whatever reasons, enjoy going around and randomly posting bad ratings about products.
So long as there are only a few bad ratings and the good ones outnumber them, feel confident about the item.
