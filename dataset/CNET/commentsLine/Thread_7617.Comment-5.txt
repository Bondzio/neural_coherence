&quot;wireless security by cyberdoc2k7 - 10/21/07 7:55 am in reply to: amen donna - repost... i'm afraid that i must differ with donna somewhat on this issue.
it's not that any of us necessarily want to deprive others, but let's face facts.
there are evil people out there that given the chance, will do things with your unsecured bandwidth, that most of us would probably not approve of.
as bob so correctly points out, when these people do the evil things that they will do with your unsecured bandwidth, the fine folks with the black suits and sun glasses, will show up on your doorstep, and you will be the poor sucker sitting in a windowless room answering unpleasant questions.
sure, the feds will eventually figure out that you had nothing to do with said federal felony, but why expose yourself to the aggrivation, when reasonable wireles security is not that hard to implement?&quot; broadcasting ssid is not a security issue (noted why in our tips sticky) but many continue to tell people to disable it.
here's why we ask for the setup of broadcast ssid and wpa for your wifi setup today.
the reason is a simple one in that many devices, laptops, etc.
randomly drop the wifi connection if ssid is not being broadcast.
also some if not all repeaters must have the ssid broadcasting in the wifi router (or more correctly the wap.)
if you feel this is incorrect please take time to drop a note to every maker that has the drop issue so we could turn this off.
-&gt; in the meantime i wonder how many get to collect a geeskquad &quot;ribbon&quot; for them to come out and turn it back on?
and without security you can run afoul of the mpaa, riaa or other orgs you don't want to hear from.
