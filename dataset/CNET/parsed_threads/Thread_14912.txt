<s> Hi, I own a Toshiba Satellite 1135 - S125 Laptop and there are three USB ports on the computer. </s>
<s> 2 are located on the back and 1 is located on the right side. </s>
<s> I have been having difficulties with plugging hardware into them and my computer not acknowledging them. </s>
<s> I'm not the smartest when it comes to how to fix computers but my computer crashed a while back and my younger brother fixed it the best he could for me. </s>
<s> It runs and I can open all of my programs and what not but the USB ports tend to not work. </s>
<s> I can plug my mouse into any of the ports and restart my computer and it will work fine, but if I unplug it and plug it back in, it doesn't work again until I restart my computer. </s>
<s> My mouse isn't my problem though, it's my Flash drive. </s>
<s> I have a Lexar 256MB Flash drive and no matter what I do, my computer does not acknowledge that I have plugged in my Flash drive. </s>
<s> The same thing happens when I plug in my MP3 player also. </s>
<s> None of the LED lights flash or come on and my MP3 library says that my &quot;Creative player is not detected&quot;. </s>
<s> I just bought my MP3 player yesterday and this was when I realized this problem. </s>
<s> Is there any way I can fix my USB ports so that I can plug and unplug any of my USB hardware and it will acknowledge it? </s>
<s> Please let me know what I have to do to fix this. </s>
<s> Thank you, B. Hoffman </s>
<s> Someone installed XP improperly or it took some heavy damage. </s>
<s> It's time to find those restore CDs and reload the machine. </s>
<s> For most of us we never lose anything since we keep backups of what we can't lose. </s>

<s> Thanks, I'll go talk to my brother about the CD's because I bought it from his old boss a while back and like I said earlier, I'm not to Tech savvy when it comes to computers. </s>
<s> I'm sure the guy I bought it from will have the CD's somewhere. </s>
<s> If not I'll get him to maybe try reinstalling XP on ym computer. </s>
<s> Thanks again, B. Hoffman </s>
<s> Reload the USB drivers either from the makers CD and/or try their support website. </s>
<s> Laptop USB ports can fail and/or proceed to have issues as power is an int. </s>
<s> cause of such or flaky contacts. </s>
<s> Also, be sure the USB ports are &quot;enabled&quot; under bios. </s>
<s> If you have a lot of ESD(static) this can cause problems and/or blow-out the USB ports. </s>
<s> Finally, that same cause can render USB devices as well to fail. </s>
<s> Test elsewhere any such questionable devices. </s>
<s> If push comes to shove, then reload the OS and start over from scratch, just have the restore/recovery CDs or know what the vendor has provided in such cases, like a hidden HD partition. </s>
<s> Of course back-up any data before doing that last resort step. </s>
<s> if after this and USB ports still remain &quot;iffy&quot; you have a true h/w fault, laptop repair??? </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
