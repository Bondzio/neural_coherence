Thank you Kees Bakker for your comment Actually I'm using Thomson TG585 v7 and it's G not N so it is too slow and its range is too bad.
My house has built from concrete and bricks.
for the range, I need something more than 1000 ft In my country there are no Linksys WRT610N and Netgear WNDR3700, so I will order everything from amazon or any website.
regards, Khaled
