well, you can but you'll only be able to connect one device.
you connect the router to the modem and then the switch to the router.
all of your other devices go to the switch or additional lan ports on the router.
the switch keeps some sort of mac address table (magic to me) and controls traffic to and from individual devices in an efficient manner that avoids the collisions common with dumb hubs.
these hubs toss the data up for grabs and let the receiving devices determine what's meant for them.
smart hubs, switches, whatever, don't do that.
you want a good switch but i don't see too many dumb hubs out there anymore.
in any event, traffic meant for the internet (wan) will be directed by the switch to the router and then to the modem which is connected to your isp server.
your isp takes it from there.
