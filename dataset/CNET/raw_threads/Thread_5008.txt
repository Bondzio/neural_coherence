My question is, which of the following setting is better for gaming: 1)an AMD 3800+ dual core with 2gb DDR 400mhz and a 7800 gt oc =or= 2)an Intel 830 3.0Ghz dual core with 2gb DDR2 667mhz and a 7800 gt oc Thanks in advance Cheers P.S. I know that intel has a faster clock speed, but since AMD has a different archeitecture, sometimes AMD ends up faster than intel, this is why i am asking this question even though Intel has a faster clock speed. :P

It has been proven that the 3800+ is better for gaming than the Intel 830, but since that Intel has DDR2, I'll go with #2.

I would. Plus, DDR2 is limited by latency in any case. I'd go for the better processor myself. Processor = power, you can go ddr 2 later but atm nothing is gonna beat it.
