1.1.1	for college dorm .	St
1.1.2	I have a Canon PIxma 1700 but it appears that this prints text as composite color , I ca n't seem to see where it will just print black from black cartridge.. ?	Ques
1.1.3	I really hate it when printer manufacturers make it so you have to buy a new color cartridge because one color runs out -- when you are basically only printing text .	St
1.1.4	Are there any HP printers that work well and use black cartridge for text , that are under $ 100 ?	Ques
1.1.5	Or any other suggestions ?	Ques
1.1.6	THANKS	St
1.2.1	I 've lost count of how many times I 've helped others find the Print Black Only in their printer control panels .	St
1.2.2	There is no standard so I end up fishing around all the panels till I find it .	St
1.2.3	I did n't pay much more than 100 for a HP k550 and the printing costs have n't been too bad .	St
1.2.4	Have you seen the new Kodak printers ?	Ques

1.3.1	If you feel you need & quot ; mono/black & quot ; text output more than anything else , then seriously consider a laser printer .	St
1.3.2	The overall cost to run ( consumables ) is far less , page for page than any color ink printer .	St
1.3.3	In fact some are so darn cheap to buy now ( school ? )	Ques
1.3.4	some are in the under $ 100 range .	St
1.3.5	You can buy a mono laser printer and decent cheap ink printer should you still need one .	St
1.3.6	And yeah , Canon seems to make the best compromise for ink cost and output results , though I still like HP .	St
1.3.7	As for color ink usage when you really print black ( composite ) , the reason is that besides trying to get you buy color is that color wo n't sit idle too long and clog due to non-use .	St
1.3.8	It also provides a richness to output as well .	St
1.3.9	But , as Robert mentioned see if there is a setting to print in black only , some printers do so , I 'm not sure about the 1700 model .	St
1.3.10	The HP website is offering inkjets for under $ 100 as I 'm sure are other vendors .	St
1.3.11	good luck tada -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.4.1	What Willy said makes the most sense .	St
1.4.2	I also figured the reason Canon also uses color for black text is to ensure the color nozzles do not dry out and clog while the printhead is moving left and right while printing documents .	St
1.4.3	There is also a black cartridge only setting in the driver option which I think is meant to be only when you have depleted your color cartridge and have no time to replace one .	St
1.4.4	That means even if the printhead on the color tank clogs it 's no big deal as you 're going to replace it anyway .	St
1.4.5	I simply refill my cartridges and find that this way , the overall cost of running this thing is quite low .	St
1.4.6	And the good thing is , if the printhead wears out , simply buy a new cartridge , you get a new printhead AND ink to go with it .	St
