cause if they do make a 17in MacBook Pro then its gonna be $2600 at least.
Although that'd be okay im not completeley sure thats whats going to happen cause @ mac world Jobs said they were going to move their whole product line over to intel.
but i might be misreading it.
cause he did reveal the MacBook Pro after saying they had been trying to &quot;shoe horn&quot; a g5 into the powerbooks.
so i guess my question is, is it possible their adding intel to the powerbooks?
sorry to ramble peace out
