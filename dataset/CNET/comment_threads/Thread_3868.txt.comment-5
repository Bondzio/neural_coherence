Hi there, i apologize for the miss communication.
basically I'm trying to install windows on the p.c and when it boots of the Windows CD it gets to the point where it loads the drivers and just before it asks you to select F8 to accept the terms and conditions it reboots.
i have formatted the Hard drive in another machine and it seems to be working fine.
with regards to the mother board models, this is what is stated on the mother board it self, unfortunately it does not specify which one it is.
if when the CD is inserted while the computer is booting up and is still at the BIOS / CMOS stage, would it be a fault on the mother board?
In another forum, a guy mentioned that it could be as a result of blown or leaking capacitors, i check all the caps and none are leaking or swollen.
