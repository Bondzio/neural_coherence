1.1.1	I ordered a new monitor for my 2.5yr old PC.	St
1.1.2	The monitor is a wide-screen with resolution of 1680x1050.	St
1.1.3	I looked at my video card and it does not have this as a res (likley since wide-screens were not being offered at the time).	St
1.1.4	I downloaded an updated driver but it still does not support that resolution (I also made sure to show all resolutions, not just the ones supported by my current monitor).	St
1.1.5	So I guess I need a new video card and I am trying to figure which to buy.	St
1.1.6	I currently have the NVIDEA GeFORCE4 MX 440 with AGP 8x.	St
1.1.7	I mainly use the pc for photo editing, not really for games (the only game played is SIMS2 occasionaly).	St
1.1.8	I've looked at some cards but they were close to $200 which is more than I would like to spend, would rather put it towards a new PC is I were going to spend that.	St
1.1.9	Any advice on which to purchase, which brand is good, and what I need to know when purchasing a graphics card????	St
1.1.10	Also, the new monitor is both digital and analog.	St
1.1.11	My current monitor is only analog, and that is the only way it connects to the PC.	St
1.1.12	If I buy a new video card, would it allows to use either analog or video, or is that dependent on another factor.	St
1.1.13	Basically I am cluseless with video cards as I've never had to upgrade or replace it.	St
1.1.14	Thanks for the help...	St
1.2.1	The video card often takes a cue from the monitor as to resolutions.	St
1.2.2	Did you install the monitor's driver yet?	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	No, I haven't received the new monitor yet- should receive it this week.	St
1.3.2	But I did go into the control panel/display/settings/advance and un-checked &quot;hide modes this monitor can not display.&quot; Since I did not see the one I specified above, I am assuming this is an issue with the video-card and not with the monitor driver.	St
1.3.3	I would hope you are right, but from what I've read, it sounds like I likely need a new card.	St
1.4.1	The monitor can't support it.	St
1.4.2	You may be replacing a card that could do the task but that's up to you to decide whether to try the monitor.inf or driver and hook it up for a test.	St
1.4.3	Your time and money... Bob	St
1.5.1	I guess I will wait then until I receive the monitor.	St
1.5.2	Is it possible to download the driver onto my PC without the new monitor, and seeing if I can change the resolution, or would my current monitor be disabled as a result?	St
1.6.1	Since I don't see you supplying links to said driver or the contents of the usual MONITOR.INF file I'll just comment I've seen a few replace the card without need.	St
1.6.2	Bob	St
1.7.1	I tried to download the driver from Dell, but for some reason when I select the model, it brings me back to selecting which display- I am not sure if there is a problem with the site or some other reason.	St
1.7.2	So unfortunately can not provide a link.	St
1.7.3	I currently have the hp pavilion vf17.	St
1.8.1	http://www.dellcommunity.com/supportforums/board/message?board.id=dim_monitor&message.id=63323 Yes it comes with the CD with the monitor.inf and profiles so video drivers know what modes and resolutions to present to you.	St
