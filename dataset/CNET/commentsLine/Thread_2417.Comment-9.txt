this card will work fine, if you install the drivers correctly.
-- meaning, you will have to do a manual install of the drivers (pointing windows to your folder containing the actual .inf files for the card).
you will also have to install ati tool app.
to force windows to use the proper settings for the card.
after this is done, your card will work just fine.
the reason for all of these &quot;installation hoops&quot; is because ati stopped manufacturing agp cards after the x1600 pro.
all &quot;ati&quot; agp cards are now manufactured by 3rd party companies who simply build the agp card with the chipset borrowed from the original pci-e card... thus, &quot;converting&quot; a pci-e card for use in an agp environment.
you can also try  for compatible drivers for this card.
good luck!
