<s> Toshiba 16x Dual Layer DVD +/- RW OEM Black (N52-1262 )is the burner i have and was wondering if u guys can help me find drivers for it because i can not burn dvds or the roxio program can not read my burner. </s>
<s> thanks eric </s>
<s> Stop looking please. </s>
<s> If your Roxio doesn't support it, then see if they updated Roxio and check their support database. </s>
<s> In closing, CDBURNERXP may let you use your new drive while you sort out Roxio. </s>

<s> Is your burner seen as a burner in Device Manager? </s>
<s> If so, you have drivers, even if they need upgrading. </s>
<s> Look on all the packaging and paper work you got with the unit(even the front of the deck-one of my decks has the driver update address there). </s>
<s> Somewhere in there is probably a web address for updating. </s>
<s> Part 2: The problem could be the burning software. </s>
<s> Some people have had trouble with Roxio. </s>
<s> Try removing the deck from the Device Manager, then reboot. </s>
<s> It should automatically reinstall, asking for software if it needs them. </s>
<s> If you still have the problem, try completely uninstalling Roxio and reinstalling after reboot. </s>
<s> Post back if this doesn't work. </s>
