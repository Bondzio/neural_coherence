thanks for the help guys.
i set it up again from scratch and made a tiny improvement in that my laptop would connect for a while (a minute or so) before disconnecting itself.
i've bought a new router, so i'm praying the problem is the old router and not the settings, or else i've just bought a new router that won't work either thanks again.
