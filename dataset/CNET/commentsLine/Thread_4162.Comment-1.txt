hi, i have an ati 9800 pro agp.
i recently installed the omega drivers, and they worked perfectly for 4 days.
the reason i installed these is because the original ones from ati haven't worked.
dvd playback was choppy, moving in the browser is choppy, and the games i play like far cry and call of duty wouldn't work at all.
this all started after my power supply went out.
this was a couple of weeks ago.
ever since,it would work fine (not choppy, games playable) and days like today, the screen turned black, and then it went back to it's choppy state.
i don't know what else to do besides buy a new card.
but why would the card work sometimes, then it just suddenly doesn't work correctly?
thanks in advanced!
