<s> I have a Gateway DX-4305c Desktop that has loud cooling fans. </s>
<s> I just replaced my 2007 main desktop with this one that I got from a buddy because it crashed. </s>
<s> It's a couple years newer and I liked the idea of a Quad-core instead of a Dual-core processor, my old computer (HP Pavilion m8100n Media Center) was always super super quiet, even when I was running the processor near 100% all the time (Video/Picture editing and multimedia). </s>
<s> It is still running as a secondary desktop beside this one and it's absolutely silent. </s>
<s> This one at 35% processor usage, the fan is almost unbearable! </s>
<s> What kind of fan should I replace them with that won't sound like a jet plane when they they kick in? </s>
<s> I find that Gateway, seemingly being the &quot;Low end&quot; of Acer, uses cheap parts in their computers (Power Supplies, Optical Drives, Fans etc.) </s>
<s> so I would like to upgrade this component to something quality! </s>
<s> Thanks for your support! </s>
<s> You can find then with google such as quietpc.com and then start looking. </s>
<s> My advice is to replace what seems loud first. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Google away, because there are fans galore out there. </s>
<s> use keywords, &quot;fan or PC cooling&quot;. </s>
<s> Understand also, that some PC setup have &quot;mutliple stage RPM&quot; that kicks-in to ahigher RPM in order to better cool. </s>
<s> Yours maybe doing that and of course is louder. </s>
<s> Don't discount that the replacement fan will do this as well. </s>
<s> Thus, if your new PC case has &quot;empty fan mountings&quot; to add a fan because keeping the case cool helps maintain the lower RPM level plus the overall cooling. </s>
<s> Understand 100% that most PC cases are &quot;in&quot; at the front. </s>
<s> and &quot;out&quot; at the back and if so installed, &quot;out&quot; on side or top locations. </s>
<s> You can improve cooling by making a hole and mounting fan. </s>
<s> Inspect and clean any frt. </s>
<s> mount vent or filter. </s>
<s> Match the replacement fan to current one and sorry you pay more for better fans. </s>
<s> Also, larger is quieter but that may not work if where you plan to mount it is physically able to. </s>

<s> Take the side panel off. </s>
<s> You might find that if you let all the heat out all the fans run at low speed......nice and quiet. </s>
<s> Cost?.......nadda. </s>
<s> While you've got the cover off take a look at the innards. </s>
<s> If it's loaded up with dust some cleaning might help. </s>
<s> Sides been off since I got it because I had to replace the Hard Drive. </s>
<s> Pulled all components out and spend two hours cleaning, even re-seated the processor and put new thermal paste on. </s>
<s> But Thanks! </s>
<s> From there all you need do is read, choose, install and enjoy. </s>
<s> If you're really fan noise averse, consider those that offer manual speed control. </s>
<s> Let us know how it turns out VAPCMD </s>
<s> I tried to verify specs at Gateway and no such model# is shown. </s>
<s> So, what does the OEM decal/sticker offer? </s>
<s> Is this really a DX-430 series or DX-4300 series? </s>
<s> It makes a difference in order to see what gateway case was provided. </s>
<s> On top of all the posts you already have. </s>
<s> I did a google search and found *ONLY* your DX-4305c posts and generic Gateway DX series offerings. </s>
<s> Just so you know... -----Willy </s>
