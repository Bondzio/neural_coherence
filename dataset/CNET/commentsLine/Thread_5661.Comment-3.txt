it turns out that the scsi cable i was using was for &quot;lvd&quot; devices and not &quot;se&quot;, which is what i needed.
hopefully this was what was keeping me from getting things done, but i have to now wait for the cable to arrive in the mail (these 68-pin se scsi cables cost $60 or more locally, and $15 online!).
the os i plan to use is suse linux, but without these drives working, i can't install it.
thanks frank, robbie
