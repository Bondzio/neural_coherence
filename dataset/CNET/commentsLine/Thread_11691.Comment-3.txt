my experience has been that the power supply is old, hungry and sipped from its final water hole.
you can try blowing it out with a can of compressed air.
take the cover off and clean it out.
use a soft thin paint brush on the fan blades and components.
it's worth a try.
but if lights are going on (real low voltage) and no fans are turning...well... oh, replace the battery on the motherboard.
good luck.
and life goes on... jack
