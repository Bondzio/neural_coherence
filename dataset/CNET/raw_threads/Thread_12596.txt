Hi guys, I just picked up a new custom made computer: An Amd Athlon 3400, (128 MB) Radeon 9800 pro, 1024 MB of Ram and a Seagate 120 Gigabyte Hardrive. Now those are my specs here's where the trouble is; I just got this computer back yesterday from my fathers friend whos a pro at building custom computers and never makes mistakes. When I rebooted the computer for the first time and windows xp loaded for the second time I started to get artifacts all over every icon and also on random messages from windows that pop up (even the user icons when you log onto windows xp). I fixed that problem because supposedly my card can't handle windows xp on the highest hardware acceleration (which is the default setting). But now I'm getting this problem in every game I play; it's not just a few artifact glitches popping up here and there there all over the screen almost like a checkerboard pattern... The games I've played so far are Mafia and Doom 3 and they both look the same. Should I return my card? Are there any settings I can change? P.S. My brother has the EXACT same computer up to the case and he is having no problems at all...

At that parts list, a 450 or higher wattage supply would be my pick, but your post writes &quot;get artifacts all over every icon and also on random messages from windows that pop up (even the user icons when you log onto windows xp). I fixed that problem because supposedly my card can't handle windows xp on the highest hardware acceleration&quot;. When I see this, the case cover comes off and I point a fan at the machine to see if it's heat. Many don't design heat management into their design. Bob

Keywords, &quot;just got this computer back yesterday from my fathers friend whos a pro at building custom computers and never makes mistakes.&quot; Don't want to say your system builder made a mistake, but if all the parts are new (my card can't handle windows XP) then something is wrong and the builder should correct issue.
