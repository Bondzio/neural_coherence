<s> We have a D-Link wireless 11N router. </s>
<s> We use it very successfully with an Acer Win7 wireless 11N laptop, and we now have a 2Wire brand 11B wireless ethernet adapter (to connect a BluRay player to the network, but not yet installed). </s>
<s> Will the addition of the 11B device slow down the speed of the separate 11N connection. </s>
<s> ...just a general question about mixing 11x devices on an 11N router. </s>
<s> If I have to get model numbers I can do so. </s>

<s> I looked in the &quot;sticky&quot; thread(s) and I did not see a reference in the link in reply 18(19) about mixing wireless protocols on the same network. </s>
<s> Sorry to be so ignorant. </s>
<s> But I think your simple &quot;Yes&quot; tells me what I need to know (but did want to hear). </s>
<s> Thanks VERY much for your response! </s>
<s> Was about how to use a router as a WAP (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point ) By using any old router as a WAP for the 802.11b traffic we not only extend/expand our wifi traffic capability but keep the 802.11g/n traffic from getting hit with the slowdown. </s>
<s> It's my cheap fix. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I think you are advising that I should find another wireless router (such as an 11b) and chain it to my DSL via the existing 11N wireless router. </s>
<s> That is, the new wireless router will be wired via a short ethernet cable to an ethernet port on the existing 11N router, which is still wired via ethernet cable to the DSL. </s>
<s> The result, if I can configure it all right, would be 2 wireless signal choices in the home, one 11N and another 11B (if the new router is 11B) and then I could connect the wireless 11B bridge to the 11B signal, and leave the 11N laptop connected to the 11N router. </s>
<s> That sounds like a great suggestion! </s>
<s> ...but I fear it might be more complex than my capabilities (or time to do it). </s>
<s> I know nothing about IP and MAC data but something tells me I would need to learn about that before doing such as that. </s>
<s> Is it possible that it might work in a plug-and-play way? </s>
<s> ...that is, if I plug the new router into the exisitng 11N router, will the IP addresses come out OK by default? </s>
<s> Thanks so much for the response, though. </s>
<s> If we use that method I will advise how it came out. </s>
