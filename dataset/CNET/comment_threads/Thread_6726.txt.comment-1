I have recently reinstalled Windows XP on an HP computer which has the 9 in 1 card reader built in.
My problem is that now when I go to 'my computer' instead of having the drive names all that they say is removable disk.
I am sure all I need is the drivers but I check at HP and could not find them for the HP pavilion a523x.
thanks for you help.
Gary
