When I turn on the computer, it says: CMOS checksum error. Loading Default settings. I have to press F1 to continue. Since this problem started I also can not use the scanner, which is a part of an HP laser printer (printer+scanner+fax+copier in one machine). The errors I get are: The scanner is already in use (it is not!); A driver is missing; A device conflict etc. What is wrong? Are these problems connected? They started at the same time. Thank you, Mogi.
