1.1.1	I am planning on buying a Wireless N router soon and was looking for some opinions on good and bad routers you may own .	St
1.1.2	It needs to be compatible with an X-Box 360 as well .	St
1.1.3	Thanks .	Polite

1.3.1	I was at Circuit City today looking at N routers and the sales rep told me that if you have a Wireless N router and connect any device to it that has a G card , then the entire network reverts to a G network .	St
1.3.2	Is that true ?	Ques
1.3.3	I will have a N desktop , G laptop , and G X-Box 360 .	St
1.3.4	So if I connect the laptop and 360 to the network , it will not be an N network ?	Ques
1.3.5	If that 's the case , then it seems like I am better off just sticking with my G router that I have .	St
1.3.6	The other option the sales rep at CC told me was what he did in the same situation at his own home : use a Wireless N router and a Wireless G router in combination and use MAC address discrimination between N and G devices to determine which router they use .	St
1.4.1	The Linksys WRT600N is an expensive choice at $ 150 - $ 200 but it makes the most sense for the following reasons : It is Draft-N 2.0 compliant ( which means it can be upgraded via a firmware update if there is a change in the 802.11-n standard once the final certification is complete ) It has dual-band radios at 5GHz ( 802.11-a/n ) and 2.4GHZ ( 802.11-b/g ) .	St
1.4.2	It is the only router that allows operation of both bands at the same time - which means it is the best router to use in a mixed environment of 802.11 a/b/g/n devices ( similar routers such as the Buffalo WZR-AG300NH and D-Link DIR-855 have not been released ) PCWorld Magazine has named it & quot ; THE & quot ; router to beat On a personal note - I have one with the following devices connected full-time or on-demand : -Dell XPS M1330 Notebook ( wireless ) -D-Link VoIP switch -PlayStation 3 ( Wireless ) -PSP ( wireles ) -iPod Touch ( wireless ) -Buffalo LinkStation -HP-Officejet Pro L7680 AIO printer See my review of the Linksys WRT600N by clicking on my screen name .
