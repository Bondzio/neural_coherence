You may need additional Y-cable splice to make more connections available from un-used Molex power connection. Power to run fans isn't that demanding thus placing fans should relatively easy. If you like, visit a &quot;modding website&quot; to get ideas of what's available and/or been done. Of course you should use the on-board fan connections provided by the mtrbd. to help in this regard. IMO, it should straight-forward where fans may best serve. The key is &quot;air flow&quot;, front to rear direction and provide as best less obstructions as possible. Typical fan placement is frt. panel= pull in, rear=pull/push out. Any other fan placement either &quot;directly&quot; cools by drawing away or blowing towards. Depending on that arrangement, the remaining(any other) fans have to increase their operation to balance &quot;in vs out flow&quot;. Fans on top usually pull out or vented out. The above applies to typical PC type fans. If you get creative and use household or auto fans, etc., or refrigeration, that's your talents at works. Also, you may want to look at PC water cooling kits as well. tada -----Willy
