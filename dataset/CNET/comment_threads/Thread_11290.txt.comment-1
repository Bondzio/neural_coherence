I have a question I was hoping you could help me with.
I have a Netgear WNR854T router connected to a Linksys BEFCMU10 Modem and a Netgear GS602 v2 Router.
I would like to add a wireless access point at the other end of the house.
I have run a cat 5 cable to the other end of the house.
I also have a Netgear WPN824 v2 Wireless router, can this be used as an acees pointand if not what would you suggest.
