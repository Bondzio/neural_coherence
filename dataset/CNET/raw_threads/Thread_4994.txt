My bro isnt allowing me to have the SSID to access the wifi on our home network (for my PSP). So i have purchased a D Link to connect my Xbox, and my PSP Wifi, since all the available ports on my current routers are used up. Question is: My bros router is a Linksys WRt54G and my one is a Dlink (54G), and i will be connecting it by connecting the network cable coming to my PC to the router. then enabling wifi and accessing it from there. But i was wondering since but Routers will both mask IPS if that will cause problems for my Xbox/PC/PSP. Heres a diagram: BR = brothers router MR = my router X = computers/Xbox/PS2 Wifi = Laptops/PSP BR -------------| -----------------X ------------X X---------- --------X Thats the current setup, but i want it to be like this: BR -----------| --------------------X ------------X X------------- -MR ------X | Wifi -- --- X How do i get this to work, and theres no point asking my brother to give the SSID (asking for a very long time) and i know i could get a switch for Xbox and PC or use my PC as a hub, but i would be more interested in getting WIFI access for my PSP as well. All your help is appreciated, thanks alot in advance.

Configure the DLink WAN for DHCP addressing. Make sure the DLink has 2 unique IP addresses/networks. To be safe, chage the DLink LAN side to 192.168.x.1. Make x greater than 1. When you configure your wireless, pick a different channel that the Linksys. The only channels you should be using are 1, 6 and 11. Using these 3 channels you can operate 3 APs very close to each other with no interference. SKrall
