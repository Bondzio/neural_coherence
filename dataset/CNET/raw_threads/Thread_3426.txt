Name your wireless network what you want through the configuration of the Access Point and you are good to go. This is making the assumption that both laptops have 802.11b or g built in, or you have wireless network adapters for each. Hope that helps. Scott

If this is the case I might try adding a multiport switch to the rooms sole jack. Both may be able to access at the same time.
