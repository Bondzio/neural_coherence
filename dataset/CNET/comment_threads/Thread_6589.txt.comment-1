Bought (and returned) a Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex Ultra-Portable External Hard Drive, 500GB, yesterday and tried to use it on a public Mac but couldn't because I didn't have the &quot;admin&quot; password to install the required compatibility software (and can't get one).
I need to buy an ext.
storage device that can work with my WinXP PC and be written to on this public Mac running OS X.
Please suggest a Brand and Model that will work for this, I am at a loss.
