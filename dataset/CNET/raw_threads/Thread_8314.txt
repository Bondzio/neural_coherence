After doing the calculations and going to the Antec website to verify the numbers it turns out he needs to upgrade his power supply. There are so many brands out there, which is the best brand? He wants to stay in the $100 or below range. We are going to put in either a 500 or 550 watt unit (he has a 300watt now) and am looking at the Antec or Thermaltake brand. Is there any difference dependability wise of these two brands or are there better ones. Any advise would be appreciated. Wayne

Some users *may* complain of noise levels but even with good brands, there are so many models it does get confusing. I suggest besides using a wattage calculator buy the biggest hunking psu and brandname and provide for a stable system. The better the psu the more the cost, but cost does pay back in a stable system. Take into acct. if it fails it may take other devices/components with it. As for noise, look for the dB levels as part of the specs.,, however as stated so many psus out there check at these websites and others: http://www.geeks.com http://www.newegg.com httpp://www.cyberguys.com for cost comparisons. tada -----Willy

It does go over his $100 buget, but I will make up the difference as this looks like a very good supply from the reviews. They have it at Circuit City here in town, so we don't have to worry about the shipping. Thanks again. Wayne
