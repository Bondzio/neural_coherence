i'm loath to part with $99 which is the cost for most of the utilities.
i've found a trial version of file salvage which may allow me to explore the drive (it recognises it) and salvage the files.
the option to remount the drive is, i think, only available in the paid-for version.
i'll update this with news of success or otherwise if this is a help to others.
in the meanwhile, any other suggestions will be gratefully received.
