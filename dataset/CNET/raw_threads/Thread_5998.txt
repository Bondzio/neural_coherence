Scenario: a) press power button - computer starts and works perfectly b) press power button - computer doesn't even post bios. The mobo is powered, and the fans start, but no usb power/vga output etc. I have both a) and b) happening on a whim at the moment. For example, got back from work. Pressed power on, and nothing. Switched off, jiggled cables, unplugged hard disk, unplugged dvdrom, changed psu power cable, changed a 12V psu cable (it's modular). Turned psu on and off and tried restarting 10 to 20 times, and still no bios post / nothing but fan noise. Walk away for an hour come back and try it....and it's working. How is that possible. However when it does start...i get a bios post of verclock settings...blah blah incorrect..press f2 to reset. (syntax is correct there is a missing O, as i presume it means overclock on bios post output??!) But I don't have any overclock settings, considering after the first time this faulted I pressed f2, went into bios and loaded all defaults. I think this started after transporting my desktop on a long journey the other day. I have an asus p5-b deluxe, and i've watercooled the cpu and graphics card. Could it be a CMOS battery issue? The computer had been dormant for a few years before I started using it last weekend. So what can make a computer this binary!
