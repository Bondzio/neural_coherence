<s> I have a Dell 4600 PC computer and a D-Link DIR-625 router. </s>
<s> My Dell computer is hard wired to the internet via a Road Runner modem and cable connection. </s>
<s> I also access the internet in my LAN with a Dell laptop (wireless connection). </s>
<s> Also in my LAN is a Wii game console (wireless connection). </s>
<s> Everything was working fine until this evening. </s>
<s> Up until this evening I could access the internet from all three - the Dell PC, the Dell laptop and the Wii. </s>
<s> Now, I cannot access the internet with either of my wireless connections (Dell laptop and Wii game console). </s>
<s> However, I can still access the internet with my Dell 4600 (hard wired to the internet). </s>
<s> In my laptop, when I click on the green horizontal bars icon in the systray, the &quot;Connect to a Network&quot; window is displayed. </s>
<s> There are a list of networks in that wndow but my network is not one of them. </s>
<s> What could have caused this problem of losing the internet connection in my wireless laptop and Wii and how do I correct it? </s>
<s> I am a newbie with routers and related terminology. </s>
<s> So, if you could please keep that in mind if you answer this post, I would appreciate it. </s>
<s> Thanks. </s>
<s> Two possibles: the router has suffered a mains spike reset and wireless is OFF by default or wireless security has been reset. </s>
<s> Either way you need to access the router's user interface -- to navigate to this you need to refer to the Dlink manual for your router which I suggest you download if you don't have a full version supplied with the product. </s>
