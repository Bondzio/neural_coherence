<s> I have an external hard drive. </s>
<s> Its a 300gb matxor drive in a generic external usb/firewire case (its been plug in through firewire). </s>
<s> I've had it hooked up to my gateway laptop for about 4 months, and now I cannot access it. </s>
<s> The laptop still recognizes that the hard drive is plugged in, but I cannot get at any of the files. </s>
<s> It tells me F:\ is not accessible The file or directory is corrupted and unreadable I ran spinrite on it at level 2 and it detected nothing wrong with the drive. </s>
<s> I also tried maxtor's Powermax utility, but it wouldn't even recognize the drive. </s>
<s> Help please, its got 170gb of my stuff on there I'd like to keep. </s>
