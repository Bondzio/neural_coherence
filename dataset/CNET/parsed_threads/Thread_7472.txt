<s> I have DSL with AT&T at home. </s>
<s> They gave us a modem (2Wire logos included) and that is what we use to connect to connect to the internet, no signal amplifiers or anything. </s>
<s> We pay for the 3 mb/sec plan. </s>
<s> My question is twofold: One: how would a router play into this and what do routers do differently from modems, and two: if the router increases speed and we only get a certain speed from AT&T, how does that work or is the 3 mb/sec bandwidth. </s>
<s> Can someone help explain all of the different parts of a network (and yes, I know what an ethernet cable and wi-fi are). </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> then you are mostly there. </s>
<s> As I see it, routers enable two things; 1] Wireless access to the internet for wireless capable computers anywhere around the home, and 2] More than one computer connected to the internet at once. </s>
<s> The setup is Computer --&gt; Router --&gt; Modem --&gt; Internet. </s>
<s> If you have a modem that allows more than one computer to access the internet, then you do not physically need any other hardware equipment. </s>
<s> Routers do not speed up your internet connection. </s>
<s> If you have a 3 MB/s plan, you will not get faster speeds. </s>
<s> In fact there is some slight slow down, but that is insignificant to us. </s>
<s> Mark </s>
<s> Ok that is helpful thank you! </s>
<s> Our modem connects up to 8 devices to the network at the same time (albeit rarely more than 4) on all platforms and using both ethernet and wireless. </s>
<s> I wouldn't to slow it down. </s>
<s> Also, if I don't need one, what kind of people do? </s>
<s> I see them in ads all of the time but we were provided a modem from AT&T and when it broke could only buy a replacement that was of a specific model at Best Buy. </s>
<s> Are routers if you don't get a modem for free? </s>
<s> And if routers do not speed up the network, then do they make more bandwidth, increase range, or just support faster networks (depending on 802.11 a/b/g/n or whatever the router is)? </s>
<s> Thank you! </s>
<s> that you have a wireless modem that acts as a router as well, and if so, in your case, you don't need any other hardware. </s>
<s> I need a modem. </s>
<s> The modem supplied by my ISP is just that, a modem. </s>
<s> But I have 3 computers around the house, and all need internet access at some time or other. </s>
<s> My main one is connected directly to the router via cable, and the other two are wirelessly connected. </s>
<s> I assume other users have similar needs. </s>
<s> However, like yourself, if my modem fails I need a replacement from my ISP, and I can't do anything about that. </s>
<s> (I imagine others with technical know-how could, but that is not me, and I prefer to stay on the good side of my ISP). </s>
<s> When we were using dial-up, we could use any dial-up modem we liked. </s>
<s> But with cable TV and cable broadband, as I understand it, the ISP has control of what modems we use. </s>
<s> Don't get confused by internet connection speed and bandwidth. </s>
<s> In many ways they are the same. </s>
<s> Your connection speed of 3MB/sec is your maximum bandwidth, and sharing this between up to 8 devices will divide that bandwidth between all the devices. </s>
<s> However, bandwidth can also be affected by outside influences. </s>
<s> For example on my street many of the houses are cabled connected by one provider. </s>
<s> In the early days if the whole street was online, my own bandwidth shrank considerably because the ISP could not provide more. </s>
<s> That rarely happens now and I seem to experience full bandwidth of my chosen plan most of the time. </s>
<s> One thing you mentioned can apply. </s>
<s> Range. </s>
<s> Wireless routers will increase the range, up to 300 feet, depending on the router used. </s>
<s> A wired connection will degrade the longer the cable is, but I am given to understand that this can also extend to some 200-300 feet. </s>
<s> However, wireless is much easier to set up over these ranges. </s>
<s> Also, cables can deteriorate when exposed to the elements. </s>
<s> Others here will have much better knowledge than I do. </s>
<s> I can only say the limited amount I know, but is there anything specific you are having problems with, or are considering? </s>
<s> Hope that helps so far. </s>
<s> Mark </s>
<s> and is what I was looking for. </s>
<s> Thanks so much! </s>
