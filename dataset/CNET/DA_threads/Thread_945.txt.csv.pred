1.5.1	Just bought a 22 & quot ; 1680x1050 Samsung monitor to replace old 19 & quot ; 1280x1024 CRT .	St
1.5.2	The new monitor works but the highest I 'm offered in display settings is 1280x1024 , even though my PC clearly recognisies the new monitor and I 've installed its driver .	St
1.5.3	I 've been told that any graphics card should be able to handle a higher resolution with ease ( my graphic card was bought 2003 ) so any ideas why I ca n't get the right res for the new monitor ?	Ques
