the 3000+ is the lowest the 939 socket range goes.
and there appears to be a worldwide shortage of the 3000+ and 3200+ at the moment.
at least thats the info i read somewhere this week, and i have been having trouble sourcing them from the distributors.
you may be lucky to find one in stock somewhere if u shop around though.
good luck.
