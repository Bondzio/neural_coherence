I recently bought an HP Media Center PC that comes bundled with the f2105 21&quot; LCD monitor.
It is fantastic.
In addition to being a PC monitor, it is also HDTV ready.
I got a Comcast HD cable box and hooked it up to the monitor.
FANTASTIC!
I think I spend more time watching HDTV then working on the PC.
The only problem I find with this monitor is that it doesn't have any vidio inputs (S-Video, Component Video) for connecting a DVD player or other components.
Otherwise, I highly recommend this monitor.
