sorry, i'm reposting my question here too, because it's related to my wireless card in notebook problem... i hope someone will be able to help me fix my problem... i have a compaq 2100 notebook.
recently, i installed a d-link wireless card [airplus.g dwl-g630] and it was working fine.
one day, i decided to see how will the connection work outside my appartment; at school.
well, as soon as i inserted the d-link card, a msg popped up saying smt about windows, i cannot recall exactly what and seconds later the screen went blue with a long message about a recently installed drive etc.
so, as i later found out, i had to go to the d-link website and install the last version of the drive.
[btw, when i came back home i had no problems with the comp.!]
i installed it and everything was fine even outside my building.
about 10 days later, i started having problems at home.
very slow response to action, frozen screen with the mouse moving but unable to click and finally the blue screen thing again!
i read online about someone having the same problem and installed updates for my compaq 2100. nothing changed.
today, i finally decided to remove d-link and couple other things.
i ran the registry mechanic, hijackthis, ad-ware and stuff like that, even clean up.
i kept having the same problem.
after the blue screen the computer reboots and can never fully reload.
it either stops at a certain point frozen or when i try to press f8 it wouldn't respond and continue until some point.
i also tried to run the safe mode but it wouldn't do it.
the last good version thing did not work... i just turn it off, let it cool down and try again.
it starts running fine until a certain point when it grows lazy, freezes and gives me the finger [blue screen and all that sh... crap all over again].
sorry for the long explanation.
hope someobody will suggest something useful thanks in advance, attila
