i cannot figure out, for the life of me, how to get the wep encryption to work with windows xp.
i'm using a thinkpad t42.
i type in the password, and it generates the numbers, but when i plug them into the notebook, it doesn't seem to work.
i don't know a lot about wireless.
what am i doing wrong?
if i have not given enough info, please let me know.
