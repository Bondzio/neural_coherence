(Well I hope you're not promoting a product, eh?)
Uhm...let me see...I think I won't opt to change my OS (and I think FreeBSD is a gamble since you said &quot;...but then you wouldn't have games.&quot;).
Thanks anyway.
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;External video card with enough memory for the game.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; So if I upgraded to let's say 2GB DDR for a 2GB required game, would it be performing the same as a 2GB DDR2 machine runing the same game?
Meaning bus speeds won't affect gameplay..is that what you mean?
(same for the video card thinggy...My slot says AGP 8x.
I don't have PCI-E.
I think.)
Help!
