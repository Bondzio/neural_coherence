12768	0	356132	3112035	NR	bea1236	8/26/09 2:07 AM	1.25125242E12	Dlink	I have a Dlink 524 router which has become unsecured. I've been trying to secure it following various oline instructions but i'm finding it very difficult.I've reset the router and renewed my IP address (this was lost at one point!) but now on the DHCP page it's showing up my mac address (which i didn't put in) and is the preshare key where i put the password? I created a password but when i tried to access the internet clicking on my newly renamed router, nothing happened, it was just trying to load!!!! I also want to be able to access my wireless on my laptop but how do i do this (when i eventually secure the network) My pc is windows xp My laptop is a Dell Inspiron 15 windows vista Please help!!
