I've formatted it with a secure (password-protected) partition and a non-password-protected partition. It had been working fine since yesterday. I was transferring some files from the watch to my PC, deleting those files from the watch, adding files to the secure partition...Suddenly, when I tried to delete or copy anything on the watch, it showed the message that &quot;The disk is write-protected. Remove the write protection or use another disk.&quot; I can still copy data from the watch to my PC, but cannot modify the contents on the watch. For the reason of being write-protected, I'm not even able to format the USB drive. Please Help!!!

It worked fine for 6 months and I can copy files from it to the PC but nothing from the PC to it. I recently installed iTunes for my wife and wondered if this had anything to do with it? Any help out there appreciated
