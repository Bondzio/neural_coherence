so far, windows 8 will only be on tablets that ship with it installed.
as a software and hardware developer i don't want to slam whoever wrote that but only the current windows 7 tablets stand a chance of running windows 8. as to the lens, i find that for everyday use i head to amazon.com and look at the best selling lists for the items in question.
as to deeper camera questions, i'd ask in the cnet digital camera forum.
