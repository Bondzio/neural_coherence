hi - when i first bought my 100gb maxtor external hard drive for my desktop dell, i plugged it in, set it up correctly, but couldn't locate it.
after researching i found on this site, a link i followed that i think (i can't really remember) i downloaded something wich located this new drive.
i just moved my room around, unplugging everything, and now i again, can't locate my drive.
i don't want to reformat it b/c i have everything saved on it.
can anyone help me locate it again?
thanks - al
