Your modem is DOCSIS is 1.0/1.1 (the older cable protocol).
The newer protocol is DOCSIS 2.0.
Your modem is indeed approved for Comcast, but the newer protocol is needed to get the higher speeds.
The D-link DCM-202 is DOCSIS 2.0 protocol.
I'd buy the D-link, try it, and if it works you're set.
If it doesn't work, return it and we'll try another route.
