I want to archive an image of a DVD that I made.
I know that when I write to the DVD recorder, the DVD will be written as -R or +R depending upon the media in the drive.
In the future, I want to use a DVD Iso image to write to DVD's.
Is the Iso image of a DVD different if it was made from a -R or +R DVD?
Can I just make an image from a -R DVD and then later write it back to a +R DVD?
