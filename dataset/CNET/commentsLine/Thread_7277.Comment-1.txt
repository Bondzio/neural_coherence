i have a dell hybrid that will not boot to the os.
it loads about halfway and goes to this screen.
i cannot reload windows at this point and would like some help on what to do.
i ran a diagnostics test and the hdd test passed.
press f2 for run setup.
press f11 if you want to boot from the network.
press f12 for bbs popup.
the mch is operating with ddr2-667/cl5 in dual-channel.
it will not let me boot into safe mode.
what can i do to reinstall the os.
