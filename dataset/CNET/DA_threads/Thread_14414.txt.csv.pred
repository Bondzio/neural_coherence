1.1.1	I am in the market looking for a TV tuner card .	St
1.1.2	Honestly , the functionality I want is for system such as the Playstation 2 or Xbox , or other TV peripherals such as DVD players or what have you , basically anything that uses standard AV ( Yellow , Red , and White ) cables .	St
1.1.3	The ultimate goal for me is to be able to use those systems through my computer , and be able to record the video and sound into movie files .	St
1.1.4	So what kind of card offers that ?	Ques
1.1.5	I wo n't use any of the actual TV tuning features , nor the FM radio ones or any such things .	St
1.1.6	It will basically serve as my video game recording station .	St
1.1.7	However , I 've looked at some cards and noticed not a lot of them actually have all of proper AV ports ... many just have a video-in .	St
1.1.8	I figure my best bet is to get something like the Hauppauge WinTV-PVR-150 ( & lt ; a href= & quot ; http : //www.amazon.com/Hauppauge-WinTV-PVR-150-MCE-White-Tuner-Remote/dp/B000E65HOO/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3/105-8533176-7524417 ? ie=UTF8 & s=electronics & qid=1180660825 & sr=8-3 & quot ; & gt ; http : //www.amazon.com/Hauppauge-WinTV-PVR-150-MCE-White-Tuner-Remote/dp/B000E65HOO/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3/105-8533176-7524417 ? ie=UTF8 & s=electronics & qid=1180660825 & sr=8-3 & lt ; /a & gt ; ) However , I always come to CNET before making a major purchase , because you guys here generally know what 's what !	St
1.1.9	Haha well any replies or advice would be greatly appreciated .	St
1.1.10	Thanks !	St
