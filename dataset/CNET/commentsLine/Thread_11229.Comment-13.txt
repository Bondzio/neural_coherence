ok, but wat if i have nothing i want to back-up.
everything i have on here is completely replaceable i think.
wat about windows service pack 2??
do i have to get that again or something??
also, if i have nothing i want to back-up or anything, can i just put in the restore/recover/reformat disc and do it or do i need to follow all of those steps??
how exactly do i reformat if i don't need to back-up anything??
do i just put in the restore disc, reformat it, then put in the master disc?
?
