<s> I have been unable to successfully load the driver for an external USB Drive in Windows 98SE. </s>
<s> The Drive mounts perfectly when attached to a machine running XP or ME. </s>
<s> The case (Travelstar) uses a Genesys GL811E Chipset. </s>
<s> When attached to the USB port, the system correctly recognises the presence of the drive. </s>
<s> However, when loading the final driver files the system crashes and locks up. </s>
<s> I have tried both the driver on the CD supplied with case and a driver I found at ''Driverguide'' listed for the GL811 chipset. </s>
<s> The driver files look pretty similar and neither one will load properly. </s>
<s> I have tried this on two separate machines running Win98SE. </s>
<s> The outcome is the same on both systems - no success. </s>
<s> Behavior is the same whether using the onboard USB 1.1 ports or a PCI USB 2.0 port. </s>
<s> Can anyone provide any suggestions on how to get this working? </s>
<s> Thanks, JIm </s>
<s> Over at USBMAN.COM some pages are about some motherboard chipsets as well as USB 98se files. </s>
<s> I offer no do-this cure but the site I used to figure it out. </s>
<s> The crash or lockup is typical when an owner has not installed latest chipset driver packages. </s>
<s> Cheers, Bob </s>
