I just recently got the thrive as a birthday gift.
It was something I have been researching for a long time!
I LOVE IT!
The functionality is great, I dont have to haul my laptop around and I can use it for all of my school work...
I can put my sd card from my camera in it to look at pictures and email them, the USB is a big plus in my opinion and I use it constantly and the battery lasts really well...
The only issue I have had is finding the right silverlight download for it... Kim
