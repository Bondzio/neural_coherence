3530	0	32982	379972	NR	jenchong	8/13/04 3:32 PM	1.09241112E12	My computer does not read IP address! Please help!!!	I have a Sony Vaio Model PCG250. My network connection is fine. My wireless connection status says I am connected at 53.0Mbps. But it says I have an invalid IP address. I am currently using a wireless router (Dlink) and a wireless PC adapter (asante). I am connected but my internet explorer does not work. I went to Command Prompt to look at my IP configuration, but it says 0.0.0.0 I tried to manually input an IP address but my computer does not seem to accept it. I tried to release my ip and then renew (my friend showed me how) but I get an error message saying &quot;an error occurred while renewing interface wireless network connection 3: the system cannot find the file specified. Please help!

First, do you have a static or dynamic IP address? If dynamic, you may need some info from your isp. Anyway, you may want to try this, reset the router per D-Link's instructions (normally a little button you have to push, sometime with something like a pencil point). Open up Internet Explorer, and under tools&gt;internet options&gt;General Tab, left click the Delete Files button in the middle to get rid of any cached router addresses. RE-setup router per the instructions. Then go through the setup page. Did the router and Sony EVER communicate with the 'net? Sometimes doing a repair of your lan connection will fix it, and check to see if the XP firewall is enabled.
