<s> Okay, I know there have been several postings already about wired routers to wireless routers, and I have looked thru some of the stickys. </s>
<s> I'm just looking for some clarification / validation on this information due to I have a somewhat unique situation. </s>
<s> Okay, here is the background. </s>
<s> I have an exhibit at a local childrens museum that I take care of. </s>
<s> It uses internet to get new updates every night. </s>
<s> Up until a few months ago, it was working fine. </s>
<s> Now the computer cannot connect to the network, therefore no internet. </s>
<s> I've switched ethernet cables, but it still does not work. </s>
<s> I had a friend of mine who has some network experience who took a look and said he believes there is a problem with the ethernet cable between where my exhibit is located and where the router is. </s>
<s> Now, my exhibit is located on the 2nd floor in the North-East corner, while the router is located on the 1st floor in the South-West corner. </s>
<s> Just replacing the router with a wireless router will not work because of the amount of steel/concrete structure between the two locations, a signal just will not get thru. </s>
<s> On the same floor as my exhibit, there is a working ethernet cable in the opposite corner of the room (about 50 feet away). </s>
<s> Museum officials do not want cable strung across the ceiling, nor routed along the floorboard behind the trim. </s>
<s> What they will allow me to do is put a wireless router up there, then I could use a wireless adapter on the computer for my exhibit. </s>
<s> Okay, so now that you have all of the background, I'm just wondering, can I put a wireless router in place, and plug the ethernet cable (which is of course plugged into a wired port on the router downstairs) just plug that into the internet port of the wireless router?? </s>
<s> What configurations would I have to do in the wireless router to connect with the router downstairs in order to distribute the internet. </s>
<s> Once I have the routers talking to each other and working properly, I will be turning OFF the SSID as museum officials do not want the area becoming a Wi-Fi hotspot. </s>
<s> The only thing it will be used for is my exhibit connection. </s>
<s> Any advice / support would be greatly appreciated!! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> Even this forum's sticky notes this. </s>
<s> Sorry that the first link died and I'll update that when I have the time and find it. </s>
<s> So yup. </s>
<s> Read http://forums.cnet.com/5208-7589_102-0.html?messageID=2754854&tag=forums06;posts#2754854 It's done all the time. </s>
<s> But the only clarification is that we turn the WIFI ROUTER into a WIFI WAP. </s>
<s> You could buy a WAP but since with just a little settings you can use any common wifi router. </s>
<s> Bob PS. </s>
<s> If you are within a few hundred miles of Boston I would volunteer to help you in person. </s>
<s> Thanks for the posting. </s>
<s> I'll be sure to take a look. </s>
<s> Thanks for the offer too, but unfortunately I'm in Central Illinois, which is more than a couple hundred miles of Boston! </s>
<s> Thanks for all your help!! </s>
<s> I appreciate it!! </s>
<s> I'll be glad to get this exhibit back up and running again. </s>
