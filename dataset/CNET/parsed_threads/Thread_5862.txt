<s> I'm currently using a D-Link 802.11g/2.4GHz Wireless Router to Link my modem to my computer system as well as my xbox gaming system to the internet. </s>
<s> Currently I'm not using any wireless features, just the 4 wired ports on the back. </s>
<s> Randomly the router disconnects and reconnects to the internet for no reason. </s>
<s> This problem never happened while I was only using the modem. </s>
<s> So I'm just wondering if anyone has any sujestions? </s>

<s> As do some Netgear wireless routers. </s>
<s> And others of the same brands work fine. </s>
<s> First, completely disable the wireless side of it if you are not using wireless. </s>
<s> That might stabilize it if it is not &quot;responding&quot; to stray radio interference from microwave ovens and cordless phones. </s>
<s> If it still is unstable, you'll have to call D-Link and see if they'll replace it. </s>

<s> Why isn't the model number and firmware version of this router in you post? </s>
<s> Open your browser , go to 192.168.0.1 which is the IP address of your router if you haven't done that, set up a password if you don't have that, check the configuration for the WAN settings , maybe you are renewing your address when you don't need to. </s>
<s> model number - DI-524 How do I find out what firmware I'm using? </s>
<s> I'm not entirely sure... </s>
<s> the version is usually shown on one of the configuration pages. </s>
<s> From other sources, I understand that the latest firmware version, 1.11, released just recently on May 17, resolves the disconnect issue for those who are having it. </s>
<s> You can download it from this D-Link support page: http://support.dlink.com/products/view.asp?productid=DI%2D524 (And, as an object lesson for all, this is an example of why Bob always reminds us that the firmware version should be checked on brand new routers. </s>
<s> Even if the router was bought just yesterday, it is unlikely that you got one that was manufactured within the last 2 weeks. </s>
<s> But the firmware update released just 2 weeks ago is needed to make it work properly.) </s>
<s> HTH, dw </s>
