and paired my logitech bt mouse on both.
it does not come up as a serial port so that's not it.
did you follow the logitech directions at logitech.com?
for example i didn't read where you press a connect button.
&quot;logitech keyboards and mice are in discoverable mode when you press the 'connect' button located on the bottom.&quot;
