i have a lenovo desktop (model - lenovo 3000 q series 8822 11q).
it has a 300 watts smps(psu).
i'm planning to upgrade to a 400 watts smps.
but, there's a problem.
my lenovo smps has a 2-pin power slot for the lenovo lcd-tft monitor.
does all smps have that slot ?
or else then what should i do now?
