I only hold the contract to work in the shop, the in-house technicians are reluctant to use Microsoft anything(except as standard OS') and while they have access to microsoft training, I do not and since I am on contract I will not be given any.
To be honest, I feel like I've been placed in a box of bricks, because I am constantly relying on others work to further this effort and it is not a high priority to others but it is a major portion of my workload.
I would love to take any courses offered but have neither the time (as this contract is paid hourly) or the money(as it would be out of personal pocket) So here i am, looking for any assistance.
Thanks
