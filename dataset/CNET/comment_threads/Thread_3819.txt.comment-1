Hi all.
I had a few issues with my Belkin router, and not really knowing what I was doing, I fiddled around and enable the &quot;configure router as access point&quot; option.
I now have an issue where some, but not all, wired devices can access the internet, and I've no WiFi access at all.
This is only temporary, as I'm getting a new Wireless N modem/router from my ISP, but this won't be for approx 4 weeks.
In the meantime, how can I log onto the router's settings and disable the access point only?
The previous IP of 192.168.1.0 has now been altered.
Current setup: Scientific Atlanta EPC2100 cable modem Belkin F5D8236-4 router PC (Vista &amp; Ubuntu GNU/Linux)- able to connect over ethernet on both OS's PS3 - able to connect over ethernet laptop (XP) - unable to connect either with or without network switch (shared with below) laptop (OSX) - unable to connect either with or without network switch (shared with above).
Any thoughts?
