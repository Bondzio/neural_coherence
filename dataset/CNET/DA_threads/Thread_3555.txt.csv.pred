1.1.8	Can someone have an idea how to solve this?	St

1.2.1	Probably your video card has become loose in its socket.	St
1.2.2	You can remove the case cover, loosen the screw and reseat it.	St
1.2.3	Power off!	St
1.3.1	Check the video cable connector pins.	St
1.3.2	Be sure they aren't bent or broken off.	St
1.3.3	Unplug at each end to do a visual inspection of the connectors.	St
