1. let's say your account on computer a is called &quot;johnny&quot;.
do you have an account called &quot;johnny&quot; on computer b and did you set the permissions on the files to allow johnny to read them?
that's 2 things you need to accomplish.
2. another downright nutty thing that kills some is that after they get the accounts correct it still doesn't work.
what i found is windows doesn't retroactively give johnny access to the share.
i have to remove the share, recreate it after i created johnny's account.
after this, johnny can read.
