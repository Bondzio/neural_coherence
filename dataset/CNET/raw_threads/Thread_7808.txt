I just bought an i7 950 with the Extreme6 MB, I choose to pick my tri-channel RAM-blocks among the few DDR3 on the market operating at 1.5volts. Read that the memory-controller in the i7 chip can get damaged by higher voltages! RAM-Specs: Kingston ValueRAM 3 x 2 GB - Product code: KVR1066D3N7K3/6G 1066 MHz, PC3-8500 - 7-7-7-20 On-Die Termination (ODT) / Intel Extreme Memory Profiles (XMP) AS-Rock's MB-support page does NOT have these modules on the Compatibility list!! Now Im afraid these Kingston RAM will cause a problem, this is my first rig-build! Help me figure out whether I should send the RAM back

If so, read: http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/front-panel-usb-3-connector,2755-7.html I see the BIOS goes to well over 2.0 Volts so where did you read that 1.5V would be damaging to the system?

7786	4	505161	5024572	5024516	DC_DK	11/11/10 1:43 PM	1.28948298E12	Hi Bob	Well, I read it in some articles, here are the ones i have the adress on: http://www.legitreviews.com/article/806/1/ http://www.anandtech.com/show/2636 -The source to my consearns is actually from the supportpage on the X58 Extreme6, the modules arent in the supported list!! How important is it to follow these guidances?? I have wrote to AsRock, and am in the process of contacting Kingston. Just thought, maybe someone knew how 'hard' one should follow that DDR-compatibility list. (Thanks for answering guys) DC
7786	5	505161	5024566	5024516	DC_DK	11/11/10 1:57 PM	1.28948382E12	correction:	The articles said something about that core i7's integrated memory-controller could get damaged beyond repair by memory-modules operating ABOVE 1.5V. Almost all of the DDR3 triple-channel operate at 1.65V, but then I found these. Havent had the time to try to figure out, whether there IS a problem, or whether those sites(articles)are just AMD-freaks bashing superior enemy architecture

Just re-read those articles, and it seems I got it wrong: Its apparently only a problem when going BEYOND 1.5-1.65V -So Im going to return those Kingston, cause they are too slow! BUT: Does anyone know how much one should follow that DDR3-compatibility list for supported modules???

I supplied the link to the Tom's Hardware so you could see that in the screen shot. I don't see the problem. But that doesn't mean people won't fret over this. Bob
