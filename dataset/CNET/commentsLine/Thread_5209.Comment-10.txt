as it turns out, i started to have problems with my pc.
it started with not being able to reboot my pc, no power no fans... nothing.
upon reseating my ram it would start up.
this happened four or five times.
i thought it was some bad ram and was in the process of determining that, when it started randomly shutting down.
reseating the ram would still allow me to reboot, but then it shut down randomly for one last time, and anything i tried would not fix it.
so i pulled the power supply, and voila, everything worked.
no problems with ram.
as far as the smell went, well that is going to remain a mystery.
it has slowly dissipated, but still continued after i put in the new power supply.
i don't think the smell was coming from the power supply, as it didn't smell, but it could have come from my x-fi front i/o connector bay as this no longer works.
but i am unsure, because, in all of the frustration, of trouble shooting my pc, i may damaged it, as i found a small resistor or something like that, had become dislodged.
i don't know if a power supply failure could cause that.
i tried soldering it back on to no avail.
one thing that does have me concerned though, is with the bad power supply, when i would flip the power supply's toggle on switch to on, the pc would just boot without me pushing the front power button.
which i have never had that happen on any of my previous pc builds.
when i switched power supply's this behavior stopped ... for the first few boots.
but now when i disconnect the plug and flip the switch, i am getting the same thing.
the pc just boots up on its on.
the only thing i can think of that would cause this would be the bios setting that has to do with the power going out.
but i have the soft boot option selected.
(where the pc stays off when the power is interrupted.)
anyway is this normal?
i've never seen it before... that i recall anyway.
