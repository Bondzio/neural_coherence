<s> I have a 400 watt in my PC. </s>
<s> Thank you </s>

<s> But can I pull up that info through windows somewhere? </s>
<s> Minimum recommended power supply with +12 volt current rating of 22 amps. </s>
<s> On the &quot;EVGA&quot; box it say's... </s>
<s> Minimum recommended power supply with +12 volt current rating of 22 amps. </s>
