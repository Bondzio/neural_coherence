ok, here is what happened.
i have an external 160gb usb.
i was trying to open a folder and it went into (not responding) mode.
i know i shouldn't but i was frustrated so i just unplugged it.
once i did that i got the bubble for a write error, i don't know the exact wording.
now i had just transferred something to it, but i thought is was done as the transfer notice went away.
so now the computer does not see the hard drive anywhere.
i have check, disk management, i have check bios and i have done this at home and on my work computer.
now while i would like to save the hard drive what i really need is some of the data.
does anyone have any ideas for getting the computer to recognize the drive again.
i have a program to get the data back but first the computer needs to see the drive.
thanks for any help.
