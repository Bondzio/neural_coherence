I had the same problem, although it happened to me more often.
I was pretty rough with my cables and the tabs always popped off in my bag on the way to class.
Now I get my network cables from www.tendonusa.com They have a tab protector thing that works really well.
They were inexpensive too.
Try them out, you won't be sorry.
