I have plugged them into my MacMini, but no matter what I do only one of them will mount at a time. I'm wanting to mount both so that I can create a RAID with them. Is there any reason why I can't mount both of them? Thanks in advance Luke

There should be no reason why those two drives do not mount at the same time. Are you going through a hub or directly into the back of your MacMini? P

It's just when plugged in together that they don't. Very strange. Anyone who has any ideas - I'd appreciate the help Ade

Next time go get models that have firewire as I bet that would work. Also, try inserting some USB 2.0 Hub into the mix. I've seen that correct the odd USB id issue. Sorry I won't duplicate that discussion again. Just try it and move to firewire. In case you wonder why I don't want to discuss it again, the discussion will not cure it. Bob

I've never tried USB drives so I can't comment on that configuration. I currently have two Firewire LaCie drives, and when daisy-chained, they both show up.
