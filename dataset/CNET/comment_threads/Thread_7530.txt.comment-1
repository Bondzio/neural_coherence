I have two Maxtor Diamond plus 9 HD's 80gb and 160Gb.
I am changing my Amd XP CPU to Amd 64bit Venice core 3500 and Asus A78NX motherboard to DFI Lan Party SNli 4 -DR. What is the likelihood of my hard disks being accepted by the new system?
I've got Acronis True Image for backups in case.Thanks in advance.
