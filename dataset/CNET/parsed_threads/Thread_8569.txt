<s> I'll try to make this short. </s>
<s> I bought a digital camcorder and realized that I don't have a dvd burner on my desktop comp. </s>
<s> I purchased a Mad dog external dvd burner 18x dual format that I have not connected yet. </s>
<s> My computer only has usb 1 ports. </s>
<s> I have been lead to believe that the DVD burner will be real slow unless I use usb 2. </s>
<s> I bought a usb2/ firewire pci card at radio shack. </s>
<s> After plugging it in the slot, the directions say to plug in the power supply to the card into the small 4 prong receptacle on the card. </s>
<s> No power cord was supplied nor are there any that seem to be unused in my computer. </s>
<s> There is a power plug unused that has 4 inline receptacles but that configuration would not match the 4 small square receptacle on the card. </s>
<s> Is there a plug available for me to buy to power this card? </s>
<s> Does it connect to that unsed 4 inline plug that is available in my pc? </s>
<s> Is there a usb2 pci card that doesn't need a power supply? </s>
<s> Your power cable/cord should be an 'unused' one from the system's power supply. </s>
<s> If you don't have an extra one or one that matches, then you need to buy one. </s>
<s> However, you offered no info on the USB/firewire card, what model it is. </s>
<s> If it is a typical system power connector required, you can get a 'Y-cable' which splits one power lead into two, found at many computer suppliers, but this is a guess on my part. </s>
<s> Just be sure to follow the install instructions, take that with you to RS maybe they got what you need or ask for more info. </s>
<s> If none of this helps with that RS product return it, it useless, get a more generic USB2.0 pci card, if you need firewire, a combo pci card from another source. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> For less than USD$40, you could install an internal dual layer DVD burner that will be faster than any USB burner. </s>
<s> No extra PCI card needed. </s>

<s> If that connecter on the rear portion is like one on your HD power connection, get a Y-cable. </s>
<s> If like the one for the floppy drive, get one that matches, again as a Y-cable, with dual type connection, FD and HD type. </s>
<s> Hope this helps. </s>
<s> tada -----Willy </s>
<s> Willy, yes that is the card. </s>
<s> As I said, there is an unused 4 pronged inline plug available but that would not fit the card nor even reach it. </s>
<s> I am hoping RS has the plug available when I go back. </s>
<s> Thanks for the help. </s>
<s> As for the internal DVD vs external, I wrestled with that but went with an external ( even though they are more expensive) because I have 2 other computers ( a laptop and another desk top) neither of which has a dvd burner, so I figured I would be able to use the 1 burner for 3 computers. </s>
<s> Plus my main PC s almost 4 yrs old so I might soon need to buy a new one anyway. </s>
<s> Thanks for the replies. </s>
