<s> I've searched the forums for an answer to this question, but the information I've found has been pretty old. </s>
<s> So I wondered if there might be a more current answer. </s>
<s> I have no land line, using only my cell phone for calls and cable broadband for internet. </s>
<s> What, if any, options do I have if I want to be able to fax documents from home? </s>
<s> I tried eFax once upon a time, several years ago (2003, I think), but found it to be twitchy with a Mac. </s>
<s> (Fonts would frequently get messed up.) </s>
<s> I imagine the service may have improved by now, but I would *so* prefer being able to fax in a more conventional way. </s>
<s> Most of the documents I need to fax are not originating from the computer, often being forms filled out by hand. </s>
<s> I'm having a hard time believing that there is *no* faxing option for those of us without land lines! </s>
<s> It's becoming more and more common to not have one. </s>
<s> Can anyone help? </s>
<s> (Just in case it might be relevant: I have an older iMac running OS 10.3.9 with a mere 500MHz G3 chip and 384 MB of RAM.) </s>
<s> (...Please don't laugh. </s>
<s> I'm a poor social worker!) </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>
<s> ! </s>
<s> To fix the issue with eFax, push your content to PDF or &quot;images&quot; before the fax. </s>

<s> We currently use uReach for our business, and have been very happy with it. </s>
<s> I would recommend checking it out. </s>
<s> And I do not work for uReach, I own my own company. </s>
<s> Hey there fellow ureach customer, I have a question for you. </s>
<s> Are you getting buckets of russian spam? </s>
<s> Do you have any ideas of what to do about it? </s>
<s> thanks! </s>
<s> Lucky, I have not, yet. </s>
<s> Since we get faxes daily and only use ureach for receiving faxes, I think we have gotten lucky. </s>
<s> I know my spam folder does a good job of catching stuff, but I just click empty and never look at it. </s>
