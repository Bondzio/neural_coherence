1.1.1	The whole screen seems to glow unless it 's tilted just right even when the background is black , and its totally impractical to use it like that .	St
1.1.2	The taskbar is hard to make out against the white of open windows because of this .	St
1.1.3	There seems to be no contrast .	St
1.1.4	The items on the screen seem to have a slight purplish hue .	St
1.1.5	Since it 's a dumpster lap I attribute it to being old and worn out , but am unfamiliar with the term & quot ; worn out lcd & quot ; .	St
1.1.6	I had another one even worse once and it was even more purple with areas that were obviously more faded than others .	St
1.1.7	Is there anything I can do ?	Ques
1.1.8	Since it 's a 700 mhz and I 'm poor I 'm more than willing to take it ( The screen ) apart .	St
1.2.1	Well heck , you did n't mention exactly what it was other than a LCD .	St
1.2.2	Besides the LCD portion , there are electronics that drive lcds of the video display .	St
1.2.3	These are corona chips , etc .	St
1.2.4	which are separate items either onboard or elsewhere .	St
1.2.5	These like a monitor can fail or simply weaken and demise output .	St
1.2.6	In most cases they are unique to the model involved and only a pro has parts .	St
1.2.7	But the best an end-user can do is swap parts from a savalged unit , provided they 're willing and capable .	St
1.2.8	If the LCD is that old , it may not be practical other than a learning experience .	St
1.2.9	good luck -- -- -Willy	Polite
1.3.1	The LCDs do indeed do that .	St
1.3.2	First let 's find that LCD burn out article .	St
1.3.3	http : //www.calce.umd.edu/articles/abstracts/1999/indiumtext.htm In short , the materials in the LCD have degraded .	St
1.3.4	There is no fix available except to replace the LCD panel .	St
1.3.5	Sadly this is not economically sound since panel replacement exceeds the cost of the total display .	St
1.3.6	Hope this helps .	St
1.3.7	Bob	St
1.4.1	That I need a pssword to view that page .	St
1.4.2	It would also appear that my question has been answered without actually having to see it .	St
1.4.3	Thanks .	Polite
1.4.4	In answer to the first response to my question , it 's an HP Pavilion N5250 700 mhz p3 notebook with a 13.1 & quot ; XGA-TFT display .	St
1.5.1	LCD 's degrade due to chemical degradations and other issues .	St
1.5.2	What you do need to know is that high temperatures accelerate the aging process .	St
1.5.3	You ca n't & quot ; fix it & quot ; .	St
1.5.4	Bob	St
1.6.1	This same notebook is only running at 547 MHZ .	St
1.6.2	It 's a 700 by name .	St
1.6.3	The speedstep is disabled in the bios and no matter where I set it it reverts to disabled if it boots past the bios ... even if it does n't go into windows ... say into the HP hardware diagnostics .	St
1.6.4	If it 's set and the machine is reset and immediately returned to bios setup the setting is retained .	St
1.6.5	This is the only setting in the bios that it will not retain .	St
1.6.6	Do you have any idea what the problem is .	St
1.6.7	I reflashed it but it made no difference , and I can not download the original or any other version .	St
1.6.8	Apparently it had been upgraded before I got a hold of it .	St
