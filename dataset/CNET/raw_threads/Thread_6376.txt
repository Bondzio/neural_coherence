Do check the contacts since I ran into a few broken ones. Also, read the other reply. One real nasty of a failed older battery is that it can destroy the charging circuit. This is not a design flaw. Sadly the only fix for that is a new board. Bob

I sit here infront of my G4, which I think it has a mind of its own, and the battery shows 3:21 98%. The best part about this little fiasco, I did absolutly nothin. So thank you to all those who helped... -Andrew

Even removing and replacing the battery a few times would &quot;scrub&quot; the contacts and magically fix it. Think about this if it fails again. Bob
