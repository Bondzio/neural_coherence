if the cpu is overclocked, it will just keep itself turned off until you correct your error.......i would rejumper the cmos to off for about ten minutes and then rejumper it back to the on position and try rebooting since that will set the bios back to defaults where you can start over.
if you can't get into the bios to reset it manually to defaults...... i don't think that board has any specific jumpers for clocking the cpu (dip switches, etc) and believe that the motherboard sets it itself automatically so resetting it back to defaults should do it.
if it still doesn't power up, remove the cpu and hsf completely and reseat it.....after jumpering the cmos to off.....and then back to on.
