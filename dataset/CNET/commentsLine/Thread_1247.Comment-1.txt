hello, i have comcast internet and a dlink dir-655 router.
i have a laptop, playstation 3 and 2 blackberrys hooked up on my wifi.
i also think my neighbor is using or trying ot use my wifi.
i need a software program or piece of hardware that will allow logging of the url's that are requested through my router.
i currently use opendns, and the service itself is pretty good.
however, it doesn't tell which user is requesting which url, and if a website is visited with 10 ads on it, it also shows the url's for the ad hosting company, even though they didn't actually type that url in.
i know what a keylogger, browsing history, etc.
is but i want to know what url's are being typed in by what user and i would prefer to have the url name resolved other than just the ip address.
i have researched router logging by the actual router, but it seems as if the dir-655 isn't very good at doing this.
i have also tried wireshark and wallwatcher, but they seem so difficult to use.
i would love to find a good software program that has a simple interface, that would allow me to turn off logging of certain devices, such as the ps3.
any help would be appreciated!
thanks!
