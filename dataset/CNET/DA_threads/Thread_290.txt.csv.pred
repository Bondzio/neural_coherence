1.1.1	I remember about 2 years ago when SATA HD's really started to sell many started prophesizing the downfall of PATA HD's... SATA drives had a faster interface and SATA cables kept cases neater.	St
1.1.2	Going through retailers now I see that PATA drives still dominate the shelf space... and manufacturers are still producing larger and better models.	St
1.1.3	My question is, why is this?	St
1.1.4	Is it simply that SATA has not matured enough and has not garnered enough support from PC manufacturers?	St
1.1.5	Has the lack of movement towards SATA in optical drives simply made it easier for manufacturers to stay with PATA?	St
1.1.6	Or, is it just that the performance increases in SATA are too low to justify the expense of completely switching over to their production?	St
1.2.1	XP doesn't install nicely to it.	St
1.2.2	You should share why you think Microsoft doesn't have SATA support in their current OS.	St
1.2.3	Bob	St
1.3.1	most new PCs support more SATA hard drives than PATA drives.	St
1.3.2	new intel mobos only have 1 ide channel that's really only intended for optical drives.	St
1.3.3	there's still a bunch of PCs with plenty of IDE ports available so PATA drives will still be on shelves for a while.	St
1.3.4	as for cd/dvd drives, moving to SATA is pure expense and doesn't bring any performance boost to the table.	St
1.3.5	there's very little profit margin in cd/dvd burners so there's little incentive to move to SATA.	St
1.3.6	still, SATA dvd burners do exist.	St
1.3.7	when bluray/hd-dvd drives start picking up steam, that's probably when the switch to SATA will take place.	St
