thanks to all who posted here.
special thanks for the link to hp.
took me 15 min on the phone for them to ship me a replacement monitor - 3 months out of warranty.
while i appreciate the replacement, i already bought a new viewsonic 19&quot; lcd for about 1/2 what hp charged me for the 17&quot; monitor 15 months ago.
what a difference.
the hp f1703 is a piece of crap.
perhaps i can sell it on ebay.
no more hp products for me.
