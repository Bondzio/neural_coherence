<s> I bought a emachine t2542 and know it didn't have an agp port. </s>
<s> So i decided i would just buy a new motherboard to put a geforce fx in. </s>
<s> I tried this and the computer doesn't boot winxp anymore. </s>
<s> I'm thinking emachine put something on the HD that detects the motherboard therefore stopping people from using there parts with other computers. </s>
<s> Maybe i didn't uninstall enough, but i did uninstall the video, sound, and ethernet card. </s>
<s> Tell more if there is more to uninstall like IDE devices or all the different Intel controllers. </s>
<s> I definitly need some help otherwise it's buy a new HD and windowsXP something i want to avoid. </s>
<s> Somebody knows the answer i hope. </s>
<s> Microsoft's OSes don't handle all hardware changes with grace. </s>
<s> In fact, let's get some items out of the way so you understand these issues. </s>
<s> 1. </s>
<s> If the XP license was one for the E-Machine, then some go ballistic as they find out that the OS will fall and will not install on another machine. </s>
<s> Changing the motherboard may not be inside that OEM license capability. </s>
<s> 2. </s>
<s> When you change the motherboard, the current Microsoft OS XP may or may not work. </s>
<s> There is nothing wrong with this except that people don't like that. </s>
<s> There is NO SUPPORT from Emachines (if your OS was a license from them) and there is NO SUPPORT from Microsoft to change the motherboard and have the OS function. </s>
<s> In spite of the above, other people have written passages you can review to see if you can make it work. </s>
<s> I'll offer these web sites in a moment, but I want you to know that even I don't offer any hope that this OS will ever work proper when the motherboard has been changed. </s>
<s> I only support the clean install method because my experience has shown that any other course results in unhappy customers that come back too often. </s>
<s> Article and links at http://www.windowsreinstall.com/install/other/motherboard/winxp.htm Bon </s>
<s> Such an O.E.M. </s>
<s> PC will only work with it's original motherboard since the Recovery CDs will only have the drivers & software for that motherboard. </s>
<s> If one of the Recovery CDs is labeled Windows XP then you might be able to use it to do a clean install on your new motherboard. </s>
<s> You can give it a shot. </s>
<s> The reason I stated that is I had performed a similar installation a couple of weeks ago. </s>
<s> Someone had wiped out the hidden recovery partition on a HP Pavilion so could not do a recovery as no recovery disks were available. </s>
<s> But the HP has the XP CD Key on the side of the PC. </s>
<s> I was able to use another O.E.M. </s>
<s> WinXP HE CD from a DELL Dimension to install XP on the HP using the HP CD-Key! </s>
<s> I have a user that lost her restore CD with her EMachine. </s>
<s> I can use my XP HE CD as long as I use the key that is on the PC? </s>
<s> It is an OEM XP HE, BTW. </s>

<s> It is an OEM XP HE, BTW.&quot; The keys sometimes don't take on the foriegn version of the OS. </s>
<s> It's all in the plan to curb piracy of the OS. </s>
<s> It's also been noted that using another CD has resulted in the machine taking a fatal exception requiring a total install. </s>
<s> Proceed with caution. </s>

<s> Worked! </s>
<s> Activated just fine and I loaded all the proper drivers and runs....NICE for an EMachine. </s>
<s> As a bonus,no EMachine garbage littered throught the system. </s>
<s> Thanks for the warning! </s>
