What type of Internet service: Cable, DSL, EDGE, EVDO other?
If Cable/DSL what modem and/or router model?
If EDGE/EVDO, what is the wireless card model and service provider.
The options I see thus far are: - Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) - Router If you give more specifics, then we can give more specifics.
