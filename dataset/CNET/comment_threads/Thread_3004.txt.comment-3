I couldn't find any web site for www.windows-disk.com I agree that this looks like some scam, so whatever you do at this stage, don't click anything to do with this web site, or with any scans it offers.
Shut down the computer, reboot it into Safe Mode and run a full scan with your AVG anti-virus and anti-spyware from there.
You don't say what Windows you are running.
Then follow Grif's advice in his post here; http://forums.cnet.com/7723-6122_102-517577.html?messageId=5083961#message5083961 Mark
