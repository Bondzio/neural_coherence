Hi There, I had the exact same problem.
Even though the port is not being block, it's being &quot;hidden&quot; by the firewall.
In the router setup, go to the Firewall selection.
I have a Linksys router.
No matter what your router is, it should be have settings in the firewall selection.
There should be something like &quot;Filter Anonymous Internet Requests&quot; What this does is hide the ports.
Click this off and you should be o.k.
