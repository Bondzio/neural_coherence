So I haven't changed anything on my HP laptop hard drive - 100GB, but ~10GB is partitioned as the back-up. I have the back-up dvds anyhow, so ...I want that last 10Gb available...darn it! But...how do I unpartition it? Thanks in advance. Best, Shalin

Keep in mind your PC needs plenty of free disk space to function correctly and getting use of that last 10GBs could be one of the things you ultimately regret doing. I predict you will be visiting us again soon. VAPCMD

If you are getting down to the wire and really need that last 10Gb, you should consider a larger hard drive or at the least, an external hard drive and use it as storage for many of your larger files that are cnsuming so much of yor master drive's space. I have found from personal experience that about the best software out there and will assist you with disk partitions and help you in many other ways with a very user fiendly interface would be &quot;Acronis Disk Director Suite&quot;. Even if you get an external drive, I would still recommend looking into purchasing this software or one similar to help manage your hard drives. This software has been very time and almost life saving to me. Look it up on the web and check it out as I truely believe it's something you can use. You can use it as well to move, merge, copy, resize, defrag, explore, recover, delete and create new partitions. I found it on eBay at a very reasonable price. Look for at least version 10. I hope that this bit of info helps you. Best regards, Stephen

Select Start&gt; All Programs&gt; System Recovery&gt; PC Recovery. 3. At the System Recovery screen, click Advanced Options. 4. Select Delete Recovery Partition and follow the onscreen instructions. Hope this helps.

It will delete the partition you don't want, with secure erase, if you wish, and add the free space to the remaining partitions, without losing any data. That said, take a backup first! And I recommend running Partition Magic from the bootable CD, rather than installing it on your primary partition. As others have said, if you are this close to your hard disk capacity, you should look on the 10 GB your free as temporary breathing space and plan on a bigger HDD or an offload of some of the data to a USB external drive. For that, I'd recommend a 2.5&quot; drive, rather than a 3.5&quot;. Although smaller, they are designed to be moved around, whereas 3.5&quot; are assumed to be in a relatively static desktop. Good luck!
