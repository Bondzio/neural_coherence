You won't get a good answer since such can vary by what satellite you are receiving from (power of, what frequency and other factors.) In short, 1/2 the diameter gets you 1/4 the receive sensitivity, so you can't arbitrarily change this. You've been here before and know that you should reveal all about what you are trying to do, otherwise we spiral into some odd (to you) response that just gets you upset. Bob

But you may have not revealed what your true setup is or what you are trying to accomplish. This is typical of your posts. Image if you were not receiving from the satellite, but wanted to use the FM mod'd XM radio or an external FM transmitter like http://www.ccrane.com/fm-transmitter.asp In that case, the antenna isn't a satellite antenna, but a stock chunk of wire of the right length.

Is there any way in the world with a budjet of a $1,000,000 whould there be away to creat a tiny antena to recive the XM satilites signal. When i mean small im talking about it would be able to hock up to an ipod mini small, Thanks Shimi

An RF signal at some frequency only is received by a proper sized antenna that has the matching resonant frequency. There are electronics courses on the subject, but in a nutshell, some want no antennas at all. There is a way to move the bigger antenna to another device, then rebroadcast on another freqency that doesn't require a big antenna. I supplied just such an solution with that FM transmitter. In closing, I can't teach physics or electronic design in this small space. You might have to take some courses. Bob
