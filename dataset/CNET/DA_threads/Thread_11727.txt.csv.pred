1.1.1	I have a home buit system about 8 months old , intel quad core , abit ip35 MB , 4 gig ram , 2 hard drives , both drives are seagate es models and both were bought new .	St
1.1.2	I was changing a light switch in our den and needed to cut power off so i threw the breaker but accidently did the wrong one , so my pc room power went out ( pc was on ) , when i put the power back on after doing the light switch , I went in to turn pc on says insert system cd to boot from cd , went into bios no drive found ( yet it was connected ) .	St
1.1.3	Went thru the typical troubleshooting stuff , swapped to a different power lead , different sata cord , even different sata position on the board , no matter what I did that primary C seagate drive would NOT show up !	St
1.1.4	I pulled the drive used a usb to sata device to try it on my laptop I could hear it power up and spin ( no funky noises ) but again nothing showing up as a drive connected under my computer .	St
1.1.5	I tried the old stick drive in a ziplock and into the freezer in hopes it might help but 12 hrs later a test via usb to sata still no drive showing up ( this trick DID work for me on an old laptop hard drive , enough to grab the primary data i needed ) .	St
1.1.6	I even tried a ubuntu live disc as described here ... http : //yatsite.blogspot.com/2008/09/how-to-recover-your-windows-files.html Disc worked , followed it step by step but sadly it was a no go - drive is not showing or listed so there was n't much else I could think to do .	St
1.1.7	I know the golden rule ( BACKUP YOUR FILES ) heck that drive was only 8-9 months old and was in a very COOL Antec 900 case ( lots of fans ) but yeah I had false security in the drive and did n't do backups obviously , the drive is under warranty and will go back , but before i send it are there any other tips or ideas I can try to get this drive to be recognized and or pull any data off it before it goes back to seagate ?

1.2.1	Try the demos of GETDATABACK and ZERO ASSUMPTION RECOVERY .	St
1.2.2	Please try both your SATA and USB connections so that 's all of 4 tests then the next stop is http : //www.drivesavers.com Bob	Sug
1.3.1	I downloaded and tried both of those ( and a few others on the net ) the problem seems to be the drive itself is n't being detected , so no matter what program i use i dont have a drive to SEE and choose in these programs even when its hooked up direct sata and power to pc or via sata cord via usb , the drive just never & quot ; appears & quot ; as viewable etc .	St
1.3.2	I did go thru the bios saw nothing to really adjust for drive detection , any drive i ever put on here shows in the bios ( even usb thumb drives ) just not this drive that failed on me .	St
1.3.3	Thought that freezer thing might work for me but seems my problem is more basic ( getting the drive to even show up ) , altho it does spin up and has no weird clunks or anything , just cant seem to get anything to & quot ; SEE & quot ; the drive so i can attempt to view or recover from it .	St
1.3.4	Gon na send it in at the end of this week but man i wish i could figure a way out to get to the content before it goes .	St
