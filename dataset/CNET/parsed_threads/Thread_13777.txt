<s> Hey everyone! </s>
<s> I'm getting myself a new gaming computer from buyxg.com. </s>
<s> I would like to get two Nvidia GeForce 8800 (640 mb) for my computer. </s>
<s> The other stats are 4GB of Corsair (Heat Spreader) RAM, and 6000+ AMD Dual Core processor. </s>
<s> My motherboard specs are (MSI K9N4 SLI-F nForce 500 SLI Chipset DDR2/800 SATA-II RAID MBoard w/ Dual 16x PCI-Express), to be exact. </s>
<s> What I want to do is put it all into a medium sized case (NZXT Nemesis Elite). </s>
<s> What I DON'T know is what I should put my power supply at for best performance (I'm not exactly sure about the power supplies). </s>
<s> So basically what I'd like to know is the power supply that I should use to support all of this and if my medium sized case could fit all of this. </s>
<s> I'd REALLY appreciate any help you could give to me since I don't know TOO much about these things, and I really don't want to order a computer that isn't going to work (or lags really bad.) </s>
<s> Thanks to you all in advance! </s>
<s> I have heard that the 8800 series cards, though amazingly fast and powerful, take up substantially more space in your case (rhyme unintentional). </s>
<s> I wish I had your budget for a PC! </s>
<s> As for the power supplies I have heard of people using anything as low as 650w and as high as 1100.. :-/ sorry not too much help on that. </s>
<s> Get to know how much power your parts eat up, or at the most estimate! </s>
<s> since putting together a computer is usually done once take time to figure these things out and youll be a happy gamer. </s>
<s> as for getting to new vid cards i tell me how it looks and works because i im getting a 8800 soon and was thinking of 2 cards as well lol. </s>
<s> Yeah, I have been taking time to figure most of things out, but for some reason, the power supply and the power requirements have been the hardest things to figure out. </s>
<s> I'm not sure why... actually, its just that I cant find any sites that accurately say how much power the parts take up, and I can't find any sites that say anything more than the minimum power for 1 8800. </s>
<s> On NVidia.com actually, it says that the minimum power for 1 GeForce 8800 is a 400 watt power supply... but does that mean that two 8800s would need a 800 watt power supply? </s>
<s> Because on different forums, people seem to hint at the fact that they have two 8800s but don't even have an 800 watt power supply... </s>
<s> If possible, could any of you link me to a helpful site? </s>
<s> Thanks for your help so far. </s>
<s> seeing browsing the web myself looking for upgrades(don't quote me, only going by memory): case: get full tower, you'll need it for cooling power supply: anywear from 750-1000 cpu: I've been looking at them myself (I have a 64x2 4400). </s>
<s> The 6000 can use up to 140w itself. </s>
<s> with the 2gpu's and 6000 the psu should probably be closer to 1000 to be on the safe side. </s>

<s> Go to www.slizone.com and click on &quot;Power Supplies.&quot; You can then select &quot;SLI Certified&quot; power supplies to be sure that you are getting a PSU that will handle your hardware. </s>
<s> It looks like they start at 650W and go up from there A good place to start...hope it helps! </s>
<s> That was the perfect site for me; now I KNOW what I need to get. </s>
<s> Thanks for all of your help, guys! </s>
<s> i read tht each nviida card take up about 500watts/ i want to get 2 at some point but it jsut takes up to much power. </s>
