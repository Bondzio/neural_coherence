Hi.
What mobo are you on?
Some of them (like my Abit NF7S2) will allow you to overclock Athlons.
My 2700+ is running at the same speed as a 3200+ by upping the bus from 333 to 400 and has been for 6 months.
If you want to upgrade the processor to a worthwhile level, it will mean going to a new motherboard as well.
For video, try an agp nvidia 6600GT.
It REALLY makes a difference over a 9600XT, honest.
Mine plays Battlefield 2 and CS source at 1280x1024 no problems.
