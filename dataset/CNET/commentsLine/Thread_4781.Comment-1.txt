i have two notebook computers.
one is for work ( company owned) and other is personal.
i travel a lot for business and carry my work computer with me.
during the traveling i cannot do any personal business as i lack the personal notebook.
i was planning to purchase a usb external hard drive.
copy files from my personal computer and carry this hard drive when i travel.
i can use this with company computer.
i use outlook express and microsoft outlook for my personal business.
how can i copy outlook express and microsoft outlook from personal computer to external hard drive?
how can i use this with my company computer ?
the company computer has microsoft outlook installed but i want to keep my personal e-mail seperate and on the external hard drive.
also how can i syncronise hard drive with my personal computer once i return from my trip ?
thanks
