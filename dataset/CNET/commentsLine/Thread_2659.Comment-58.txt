data is very important and i sure understand your situation greatly.
in the past i have felt good about wd drives, but in recent years they have lost their touch.
in the beginning when i was working with 10mb drives i liked seagate and then they had their share of problems and some were good and others were, well not so good.
maxtor in the early days were super drives, but when they bought out miniscribe and took on a new series of designs and were poor for a long time.
each brand has had their ups and downs.
right now i feel that seagate is the one to choose and a strong choice for reliability.
i have some maxtors, westerndigitals, and seagates.
right now i am cautious with them all.
i do data recovery when it comes about and it is time consuming to do and try to keep the costs down for the individual who wants to keep their files that they have worked so hard to save and develop over a period of time.
personally i charge a fee usually from $200-300 in most situations to recover your data.
even with the programs available today, there is no way to guarantee the data can or will be recovered.
i certainly wish i could have helped you, as i know the feeling when it comes to your data, having lost data of my own, just so happens on a wd.
seagate right now may be the choice in hds today for reliability.
tomorrow, who knows what might be the right choice.
whatever you do save your data on multiple platforms or media.
