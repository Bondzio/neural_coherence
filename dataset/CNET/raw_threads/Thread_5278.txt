My computer belongs to a workgroup called ABC. Now, I can connect to most of the computer under same workgroup directly by typing &quot;\\computer1&quot;. However, I cannot connect to any of the computers belonging to some other workgroup. I tried typing &quot;\\EFG\computer2&quot; where EFG is a name of the workgroup, but does not work. I am not clear about the concepts of workgroups and interconnectivity. Please advice. Thank you

Try this rather than typing the network path and the correct route should be displayed for you. If you desire, you can always map a share to your PC if you connect to it often.
