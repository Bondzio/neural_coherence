hello all.
i need to upgrade my hp pavilion p6210y with one or more hard drives.
the upgrade & installation manual has some nice phtos of uninstalling/reinstalling the factory drive.
the photos show a &quot;drive cage&quot; which appears to be big enough for a second drive.
however, there is no help on where new hard drives should sit, nor specs on the type/number/size of new hard drives supported.
in the p6201y specs in hp's website, i found the following availability statements for hard drive bays: drive bays bay type quantity 5.25&quot; two (one available) 3.5&quot; three (two available) does anyone know where these available installation points are located?
from the factory drive uninstall/install photos, it looks like there is room enough in the drive cage for a second drive.
however, i can't tell whether the factory drive is 5.25&quot; or 3.5&quot;.
also, i can't find room other than the factory drive cage where 2 additional 3.5&quot; drives should be mounted.
any help in understanding drive bay installation would be greatly appreciated.
thanks.
