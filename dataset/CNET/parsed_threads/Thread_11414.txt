<s> How long does a solid state drive REALLY last? </s>
<s> The other day I came across an ad on Newegg for a Samsung SSD. </s>
<s> In its specs it makes the claim that the MTBF (mean time between failures) is 1,000,000(!) </s>
<s> hours. </s>
<s> For those of you who are like me and don't do big number math well off the top of your head or don't have a calculator conveniently handy, that translates to just over 114 years. </s>
<s> So is someone supposed to take away from this that this Samsung SSD--with normal use--is supposed to outlive its owner, if the unit was to actually start use at the same time as the owner's birth? </s>
<s> Or is the MTBF quote supposed to mean something else? </s>
<s> Yes, SSDs don't have any mechanical moving parts. </s>
<s> But my understanding of SSDs is that they are based upon NAND-flash memory units. </s>
<s> And NAND doesn't have an indefinite lifespan by any means. </s>
<s> The usual number I see quoted for memory wear is 100,000 write/erase cycles. </s>
<s> I've actually worn out a CompactFlash card recently (85,000 +/- writes plus an unknown number of erasures, as used across three different dSLR cameras) that took me about 4 1/2 years to accomplish (I have a nasty habit of taking multiple shots of a subject by leaving the camera in continuous shoot mode and holding the shutter button down, believing that if the first shot didn't come out just right, then perhaps the 2nd, 3rd or even 4th following frame will be better...the scourge of digital photography). </s>
<s> Even with the latest advanced flash memory that purported has a write/erase (or program/erase) cycle rating of 1,000,000, that would only translate to 45 years at best, and that's only taking pictures at the rate that I take them. </s>
<s> Computer operating systems seem to access and write their primary hard drives all the time if I use my machines as an example. </s>
<s> Web surfing results in constant p/e cycling, and OSs like Windows and the assorted applications for the platform creates all sorts of temporary files for all sorts of functions and needs. </s>
<s> Heaven forbid that you might partake in actually defragging that SSD at some point. </s>
<s> So how can Samsung proclaim that its SSD will live 114 years given this sort of working environment? </s>
<s> PR department run amok? </s>
<s> since the Windows Vista rig I am using has two 128GB SSD's in Raid 0 format. </s>
<s> Nothing like chancing fate huh? </s>
<s> SSD in Raid 0, It's been going since July 2009, but I had to reinstall Vista at the new year. </s>
<s> It's not turned on continuously, when I don't use it I shut down, but it's on several hours a day. </s>
<s> Mark </s>
<s> http://www.storagesearch.com/ssdmyths-endurance.html covers this once again with a nugget about the 100,000 number that is true. </s>
<s> Most of the parts exceed the 100,000 by 10x. </s>
<s> It still means that worst case you are looking at a 5+ year drive. </s>
<s> And now that most hard drives have dropped their warranty to 3 years, it still looks like SSD wins. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> For a desktop user the math of MTBF, which I am sure thousands of scientists and engineers have performed, can be rendered practically irrelevant by using SSDs only for the OS and apps. </s>
<s> Keep your data on a comparatively durable HDD and back it up multiple times of course as you know. </s>
<s> The speed gain, noiselessness, low power, low heat and 3-yr warranty of SSD make it a no-brainer choice as system disk for W7(TRIM) desktops (NOT servers and NOT laptops unless backed up after every session). </s>
<s> Pro photogs and worry wart ams should replace their flash well sooner than specified lifetimes or warrantees. </s>
<s> Still no guarantee of failure free operation but buys a teeny bit extra peace of mind. </s>
<s> And no TRIM available on this setup. </s>
<s> I don't understand the technical reasons, but Dell says this firmware doesn't support TRIM. </s>
<s> Mark </s>
<s> It's a small world and we (a company I do work for) have been asking more questions about bad sectors, SMART and more. </s>
<s> Here's the interesting part about SSD and what happens when it runs out of spare sectors. </s>
<s> To protect the contents of the drive the drive becomes READ ONLY. </s>
<s> Smart move in my opinion. </s>
<s> But this means that anyone that setup RAID 0 would need to see if the pair is readable in other OSes since Windows can't run from a read only drive. </s>
<s> As a test I'd boot UBUNTU from CD in it's LIVE CD mode so no install and see if it shows your files. </s>
<s> If it does you are likely safe for years from any trouble due to flash wear. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> &quot;...In a well designed flash SSD you would have to write to the whole disk the endurance number of cycles to be in danger...&quot; I wondered as much. </s>
<s> Makes sense to segment and allocate the p/e cycles across all of the memory portions of the drive than concentrate them always to the most immediately available address and in unison treat the entire drive as a singular entity. </s>
<s> The article does seem to give credence to notion of a SSD lasting a VERY long time. </s>
<s> But a lot of these specification claims still feel very much like manufacturers' gloating over something that no one today will be around or--just as likely--remember to see proven. </s>
<s> A bit like GM's mystical Chevy Volt MPG numbers. </s>
<s> It also begs the question: if a SSD goes into Read Only mode as you described in one of your other postings, does that actually qualify as a failure, at least in Samsung's eyes? </s>
<s> Or is the continued data integrity part of that 114+ years? </s>
<s> (I'm still trying to get my head around that 1,000,000 hour number &lt;sigh&gt;...) </s>
<s> That's where the wear leveling gets tested. </s>
<s> Even with discount after discount I can only get it down to 5.4 years even with the rogue data recorder scenario. </s>
<s> What's more likely to fail is something else. </s>
<s> For example your common FLEX CABLES also have a limited MTBF and that was in one rare case listed at 5 years. </s>
<s> Pretty scary as those were used in HDTV sets. </s>
<s> Here's my bet. </s>
<s> Something else will fail before the actual flash components. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> I know Knoppix wouldn't be able to read RAID 0 drives, (at least from a few years ago), so maybe Ubuntu Live CD can do that now. </s>
<s> Just a thought though. </s>
<s> This OS is fine, (at the moment), and no risk of running out of space. </s>
<s> Unless I misunderstood what you say. </s>
<s> If the SSD's become Read Only then the OS fails, but if the OS is working then I haven't reached that point yet. </s>
<s> Or perhaps I misunderstood in another way. </s>
<s> Booting from Ubuntu is a good test to see if any sectors have become Read Only? </s>
<s> Whichever, it's time I got myself a replacement for Knoppix so I will try Ubuntu. </s>
<s> Mark </s>
<s> What happens when it runs out of spare sectors. </s>
<s> To protect the contents of the drive the drive becomes READ ONLY. </s>
<s> Since Windows will no longer run we need some other OS to reach in and copy out the files. </s>
<s> At least with SMART you should get warning but many ignore or have turned off SMART warning. </s>
