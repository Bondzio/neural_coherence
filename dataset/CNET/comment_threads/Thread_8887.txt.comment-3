Hi, thanks for replying.
They both run xp home.
The compaq 8000T is a build to order pentium 4 2.4 processor.
It has a.llot of the bells and whistles and is 2 years old.
The Dell XPS is two days old, it's a pentium 4 2.8 processor although it really has no extra ports in the back other than the dvi for the monitor and about 6 USB openings.
how do I know if they have a nick card - the compaq might very well.
I could email photos oth the backs of the pc's as they sit.
I just took some pictures because I just built this desk for the pc's and wired all last night.
Thanks litegide24@yahoo.com
