i am looking to buy a laptop with three antennas capable of 450 mbps speed.
3x3 mimo.
the only one i know of is the alienware 17 and 18 inch, which have the killer 1103 wireless card pre-installed and 3 antennas.
i think the new macbook pro has an intel centrino ultimate wireless-n 6300. are there any others that anyone knows about?
there was a dell e5210 but it is discontinued.
