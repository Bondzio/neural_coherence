the maxtor drive in my 1st dell computer was whisper quiet.
others maxtor drives that i've used since are louder, although i wouldn't really say they were overly so.
using the maxtor program made them nearly silent.
i currently have 4 maxtor drives from 1-3 years old, and no failures to date.
i also have a wd drive that is louder than my maxtor drives.
my opinion is that this is likely an acoustic problem.
i've had no problems with maxtor reliability.
