I'm still not entirely sure if the board has an agp card installed or an available agp slot.
If it has a card installed it will probably support the resolution but it's hard to say with out knowing the make and model of the card.
That said I do believe it's runing on onboard video, and information on the video capabilities of this chipset video are limited at best.
The other problem is that the slot whether occupied or not, is a AGP 2.0 specification.
The newer specification is 3.0.
The compatibility issues there are complex to an inexperienced user and given the limited info on that chipset, I wouldn't attempt it if I were you just now.
If you install a 3.3v card were only a 1.5 is supposed to go, you're not going to like the result at all.
&quot;Doctor, I smell burnt Toast&quot; I'm going to do some more reasearch on the chipset and get back to you.
