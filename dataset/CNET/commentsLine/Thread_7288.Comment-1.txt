i had a problem that i was told was a rootkit, so i decided to reformat my hard drive.
details on that problem, if necessary, are in this thread:  so now i have a fresh install of xp pro, and i need to install my wireless driver.
i've done this successfully at least once before.
this time i am having problems.
i have the original disc with the drivers that came with my computer.
as i was installing the driver, the icon appeared in the taskbar with a &quot;new hardware found&quot; kind of message.
a couple seconds after that, my screen switched to a blue screen with lots of white text for a second, and then the system restarted.
then i have the option to start windows normally, in safe mode, or last known good configuration.
if i start windows normally, the blue screen and restart happens again.
if i start with last known good configuration, i don't have wireless.
does anyone know what my problem is?
