<s> I use stereo headphones, and almost all HD movies seem to have low volume on my PC at max volume settings.. Actually even not-bluray movies with 2 channels audio are kinda low too but still A LOT better then the 5.1 channel videos, So what exactly is the problem? </s>
<s> Do i need a Dolby headphones? </s>
<s> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Laboratories dives in and there are more than 5 Dolby technologies but if the audio levels are low then you head to some Mixer app or control panel to set the mix as you wish. </s>
