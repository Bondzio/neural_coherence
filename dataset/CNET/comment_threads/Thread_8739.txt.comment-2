All I can offer is I would not setup or support such a system.
I will offer that I might consider using the more accepted &quot;use a router as a access point&quot; noted in this forum's sticky are at http://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/965/~/using-wpn824,-wgr614,-or-wgt624-routers-as-an-access-point There are routers that do lock up when a Vista machine is near but that's an old issue cured with firmware or if not, replacing the bad router.
As to &quot;why is this happening?&quot; I can't tell you but I do see the problem and have had to cure far too many with firmware, replacements or revamping the network., Bob
