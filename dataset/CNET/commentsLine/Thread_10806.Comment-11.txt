sorry for the typographic errors in my last post.
-&gt; don't worry too much about cookies that ewido may find.
those are pretty normal and ewido is just nitpicking.
what we need to do is to rewind to the top of this discussion now that we have the spyware and winsock under control (we think.)
i'll post a recap and see what i think would be next to try.
(i rarely give up.)
