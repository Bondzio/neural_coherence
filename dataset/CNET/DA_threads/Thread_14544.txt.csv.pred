1.1.1	What is the difference between pc3200 and pc3200u ( u=unbuffered ? )	Ques
1.1.2	Should n't this be important enough to mention on web sites like www.crucial.com ?	Ques
1.1.3	( I may know viruses , but memory escapes me - www.schiffkey.com )	St
1.2.1	Suspect buffered -unbuffered is addressed on mem mfg websites ... sure its not there ?	Ques
1.2.2	VAPCMD	St
1.3.1	You 're right -- it 's not very conspicuous : http : //www.crucial.com/kb/KBSearch.asp ? SearchTerm=unbuffered & Category= & go=go	St
1.4.1	Thank you !	St
1.4.2	Strange how I would notice - over many years - the 8 larger black chips - but never notice that one , much smaller , tiny black chip .	St
1.4.3	So & quot ; registered & quot ; chips are the ones with the & quot ; U & quot ; .	St
1.4.4	These chips have a clock cycle delay .	St
1.4.5	The Unbuffered chips are the one without the & quot ; U & quot ; ( sounds like reverse polish notation ) .	St
1.4.6	It also means I can not & quot ; mix and match & quot ; .	St
1.4.7	But in this case : I can remove the 256mb unbuffered chip , and replace it with two 256mb registered chips .	St
1.4.8	Thus putting 512mb safely on the computer - a step up .	St
1.4.9	Of course , this all assumes the chips & quot ; fit & quot ; ( one versus two notches - and not on a Dell which moved the notches thus making their memory & quot ; propriatary & quot ; ) .	St
1.5.1	instead of about the RAM that does n't work .	St
1.5.2	To be honest I doubt the RAM is proprietary unless the original MB is a server board ... .cause all the PC66 , PC100 , PC133 that I 've seen is on the same PCB design ... 168 Pin SDRAM with 2 notches ... some single sided , some double sided .	St
1.5.3	VAPCMD	St
1.6.1	The primary question was general in nature : A customer had given me a few choice sticks of RAM instead of CACH ( cache ?	Ques
1.6.2	bad pun ?	Ques
1.6.3	) So , when I went to CHEQUE ( check ) the ram , found it had that U ( pc3200u ) whereas other sticks were w/o the u ( pc3200 ) .	St
1.6.4	As for the more specific nature of propriatary RAM - check out a DELL motherboard : The notches on most ( ? )	Ques
1.6.5	sticks of RAM are off by a fraction - thus forcing you to buy ram directly from Dell instead of your friendly neighbourhood computer warehouse .	St
1.7.1	& quot ; IBM compatible & quot ; could mean compatibility with any number of computers produced over the past quarter century .	St
1.7.2	Too vague .	St
1.7.3	If the notches are misaligned , even by a little , you 're probably using the wrong type of RAM .	St
1.7.4	The best way to learn what type of RAM works or is compatible with a computer is to go to the computer model 's webpage and look at its specifications .	St
1.7.5	BTW , WHAT DELL MODEL IS IT ?	Ques
1.7.6	An alternative is to enter the computer model number at a site like Crucial.com or Kingston.com .	St
1.7.7	They will display information on what of RAM they sell is guaranteed to be compatible .	St
1.7.8	You could also download and run CPU-Z ( http : //www.cpuid.com/cpuz.php ) to learn all sorts of information about the RAM modules currently installed in the computer .	St
1.7.9	It is yet another way of learning what TYPE of RAM is compatible with your computer 's motherboard .	St
1.7.10	It will even give you the manufacturer name and model number of the RAM module .	St
1.8.1	The 'u ' that you see may be part of a model number scheme for a specific manufacturer and not necessarily part of an industry standard designation .	St
1.9.1	184 pin , buffered and unbuffered and the DIMM notch is slightly off-center .	St
1.9.2	If we knew what PC mfg and model number we could probably back into the RAM type .	St
1.9.3	Your call .	St
1.9.4	VAPCMD	St
