I have a couple of PC's in my home and would like to have a central backup place for my files as well as a Itunes server. I already have a spare hard drive and just need a good enclosure to match it with. I'd like to get the enclosure for cheap (if that's possible) but want something that's not going to die right after I get it. Any advice?

I've seen this one off of ebay and &quot;looks&quot; like what I'm looking for. http://cgi.ebay.com/SATA-NTFS-Vista-FTP-Samba-NAS-Network-Storage-Enclosure_W0QQitemZ200167776942QQcmdZViewItem

I heard that you can only format fat32. As far as I understand, this would mean that you cannot assign different access rights per folder to different users or groups on the network, but can only share folders

10200	14	273064	2686425	2686396	bigeasy72	1/23/08 6:32 AM	1.20106992E12	NAS Drive	Thanks for the feedback, Ramarc. Do you know where I can find a little more info on this. Can one set access rights on the drive, per folder/file and per user/group?
10200	15	273064	2686447	2686333	R. Proffitt	1/23/08 7:08 AM	1.20107208E12	NTFS or another file system...	Even in Linux we have such permissions. You need to get your goals stated since those linux based NAS can use a file system that has permissions, ownership and such. But let's skip all that. Most don't want to know what the file system is but want &quot;features.&quot; Bob
10200	16	273064	2686589	2686447	samkh	1/23/08 9:39 AM	1.20108114E12	Wait a minute!	&lt;&lt;Most don't want to know what the file system is but want &quot;features.&quot;&gt;&gt; Altho I've been tempted by NAS (affordable types), I have resisted for two reasons: 1. Almost all cheap NASs uses Linux SMB-CIFS and if the enclosure dies, I've got to either get a replacement (compatibility may/maynot be easy to find) or use some translator to access with a Windows PC or boot a distro. Not exactly instant recovery! 2. Even with GbE, thruput continues to be low. Nothing yet beats a stripped down PC with direct attached SATA for a highly manageable, cost effective SOHO solution.

10200	20	273064	2824335	2686333	tunghoy	8/1/08 2:55 PM	1.2176025E12	Do not buy the Linksys NAS200	I hope it isn't too late! The device is OK for archive purposes, but you don't want to use it for daily work. It's slow as molasses (with 7200 rpm SATA drives) and there's no way to prevent the drives from going to sleep every 30 minutes. Not only that, but if you want to back up your data, the NAS200 ACTIVELY PREVENTS the archive bit from being reset, which means that you cannot do an incremental or differential backup. You have to do a full backup every time. When I called Linksys, I spoke to some genius in India who only read canned statements and refused to take any action. She told me to update the firmware, but the problems persisted. It's the last Linksys product I will buy.
