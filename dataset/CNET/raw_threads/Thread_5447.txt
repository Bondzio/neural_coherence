Can I use my 'WD MyBook 500GB' or any OTHER external hardrive to listen to music/view media on a regular basis? In other words, can I use my external hardrive just like any other hardrive? The reason for this type of question is that I feel a little uneasy about seeing how hard my hardrive has to work.. or how it heats up after long periods of time. It's enough to get anyone a little concerned.

But, I'm an avid collector of music and I listen to it on a regular basis. So, that means I'm constantly making WD's MyBook work hard.. by making it's insides churn, and heat up. My other WD hardrive (160GB, not a MyBook) never really got hot or made a lot of noise. To be honest, my other hardrive was much faster and probably performed better overall! I've heard it's because the MyBook writes/reads slow.. could this be the case? It came with a FAT32 filesystem and I decided to change it to NTFS because I've heard it's safer too. So far, I noticed very little speed boost. Anyway, with all these reviews and comments about data failing on external hardrives (USB/firewire).. I guess I have to be careful with mine? lol, and also my dad has a Lacie external hardrive.. I don't think it has a cooling system (fancy fan) either. But, I've read reviews about it overheating. In this case, I have personally used it for long periods of time and felt it to be very hot afterwards. If you're caring around a lot of data.. even that is at risk. Backing up a back-up drive seems a bit funny, but I'm beginning to believe it really IS necessary. You never know what's going to happen!

The button is a backup button but no switch to stop a virus or human from wiping out the drive accidently. These fail the basic test of a backup. The next test is having the second and third copies. I found only one person to have more than one backup. BOb

With just one device/media the pests can infect it and you can't go back. Also it can't be left off site in case of fire, theft. Bob
