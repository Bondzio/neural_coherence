My old Lexmark printer needed a new cartridge after several years of sitting in an unheated summer cabin in MN.
A new black cartridge costs about $30.
I bought a &quot;NIB Factory Sealed Lexmark Z715 Photo Ink Jet Printer&quot; on eBay for $12.50 plus $14.75 s&h.
It was new with two unopened cartridges, black and color.
The seller got it free with a new computer and didn't need it.
