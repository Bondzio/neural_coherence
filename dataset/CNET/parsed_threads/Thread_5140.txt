<s> I recently help a friend of mine to format and re-instal windows XP home edition to his Dell dimension desktop. </s>
<s> On completion the pc is working perfectly but for one snag, his pc isn't recognising his connection, he has a cable/ethernet connection with blueyonder, his modem etc is connected but yet he can't seem to get online. </s>
<s> In his device manager, he has a yellow question mark where ethernet controller and PCI modem are, is this the cause of it and what can be done to resolve this problem? </s>
<s> Any advice regarding this matter will be greatly appreciated, as he is driving me mad with phonecalls every five minutes. </s>
<s> reinstall of XP is incomplete. </s>
<s> When Device Manager reports a disabled device, you likely have yet to install all the required drivers to make your PC functional. </s>
<s> You need to put the resource CD in the drive to install the chipset drivers. </s>
<s> Great, that did the trick, i now have a happy friend thanks to your advice, Thank you. </s>
