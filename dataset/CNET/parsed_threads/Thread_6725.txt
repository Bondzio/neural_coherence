<s> I have a computer running Win ME. </s>
<s> I want to transfer the files from that hard drive to a computer running Win 2000. </s>
<s> Is it possable to take the HD from the ME computer and put it in the 2000 computer as a 2nd drive? </s>
<s> I would then copy the files to the drive that has 2000 installed on it. </s>
<s> I would then put the ME drive back in the computer that it was in first. </s>
<s> Will all the programs work ok? </s>
<s> By transfer, do you mean move them or just copy them? </s>
<s> You can certainly put a second drive in another PC temporarily for this purpose. </s>
<s> You cannot copy entire programs this way but you can copy such as text, audio/video, picture files and those you have created with programs on the other PC. </s>
<s> The other PC must have the ability to open the files you copied or they would be of little value. </s>
<s> Hope this answers your question. </s>
<s> I think I get the idea. </s>
<s> If I install the programs on the win 2000 computer I can copy the data for those programs from the second hd. </s>
<s> Next question! </s>
<s> If I leave the hd from the win ME computer in win 2000 computer will win 2000 be able to run those programs? </s>
<s> The ME hd would be a slave. </s>
<s> How much of win me could I delete from the hd? </s>
<s> You cannot link program shortcuts from one drive to another as the programs are installed and registered to the OS on the drive. </s>
<s> However, you can install both completely working drives and run them independently by switching through the BIOS when you start or restart the PC. </s>
<s> I do this myself. </s>
<s> If you plug your ME drive into one already working with Win2K, you will need to configure the hardware, load the necessary drivers, etc. </s>
<s> Once done, you can select which drive to operate from. </s>
<s> I prefer this to partitioning and loading multiple OSs on a single drive. </s>
