Hello, I am a beginner so my apologies if i do not understand or have to ask again anyways, I just got a Toshiba laptop with windows 8 pre-installed. It had a 1 TB hard drive and I added another 1 TB as it has a slot I want to install Linux. How should I go about partitioning my extra hard drive that I added? Currently it is unallocated and currently i do not see this hard drive i added in the list of my drives in the My computer but yes i do see it in the Disk management area any help is much appreciated

At no time am I partitioning or formatting ahead of the install. Those that do such tend to blow up there installed OS. Bob Step 4 of http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/install-desktop-latest shows this. Again I have to wonder why so many want to make this harder than it needs to be.

If i shrink the first hard drive that Windows 8 is on it and if Ubuntu installs correctly can I move it or give it more room from the second drive which would be free it is just a thought i am a beginner and do not know exactly if the cause of the error message (cant mount file) is really what i just said any expert thoughts/suggestions please?

If WD or Seagate, they provide s/w to help install and prepare and others provide similar(I assume). That should include any partitioning s/w as well. Just be darn sure you are addressing that new HD. Once only the partitioning is done you can access it for Linux as it should see a prepared HD awaiting use and direct the Linux there. I'm unsure if GParted is capable under Win8 use but it has provided partitioning setups for prior OSes. http://gparted.sourceforge.net/download.php Before you attempt anything, be sure you have a working back-up or recovery discs made in order to restore you current setup, just in case. tada -----Willy

Anyway, I made a USB and booted from it and nothing happened. I do not know what to expect to be honest. Would Ubuntu come up automatically? sorry but I am beginning on this path but very eager and determined I tired to eject the usb and message said the file was in use by system but could not see anything anyways thanks Reza

Use their site and tutorials and it's usually fine. That is, I usually find folk are making up something undocumented and wondering why it doesn't work. There is a clue &quot;I tired to eject the usb and message said the file was in use by system but could not see anything&quot; as that tells me you did not boot from the USB drive. Bob

The newer laptops arrive with UEFI BIOS enabled and that is going to break old install systems. OK, how did I fix that on a new Windows laptop that came with UEFI enabled? 1. I created the restore media. 2. Since this was the first time I had to deal with this I slipped in a new blank HDD. 3. I set the BIOS to LEGACY ONLY. 4. I used the restore media to restore the laptop to near factory condition. 5. Finally I could boot Linux media and do a good install just like we did before UEFI. --&gt; What does this all mean? As the industry changes to UEFI BIOS we'll have to wait till the Linux distros catch up. Sorry I didn't spot this earlier. And this subject is widely discussed so I'll stop here so you can do more research. Bob
