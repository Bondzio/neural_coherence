i've got a hp pc running xp with a 1.3g athlon processor.
in the past 6 months it has gotten painfully slow.
i can't play music and open any other program at the same time.
i had 256mb ram and it always used to work fine.
i'm not running anything different.
i've run various spyware and virus removal programs and started deleting programs i didn't use and killed most of the stuff runing in the system tray.
that didn't help.
i then tried adding more ram.
i now have 512, but there has been no improvement.
i assume the next step would be to reformat the hd and reinstall windows, but if it came with a xp cd, i can't find it (i don't think it did).
is there anything else i can try before i chuck this thing in the dumpster?
i don't claim to be a computer expert, and am not comfortable jumping into bios etc... any help is appreciated!
