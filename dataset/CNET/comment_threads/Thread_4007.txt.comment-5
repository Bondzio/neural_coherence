Thanks, I had good time with this forum, must say.
And also worth a try, as I hoped actually it will work, cause I realy don't want to run that cable again.
But, I've connected a small second hand 4port switch, and that seems to help, and I have space for another 2 cables to fit in case I need more.
Thanks for your time guys.
I appreciate it a lot
