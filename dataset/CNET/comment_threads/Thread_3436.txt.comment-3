Or flawed even.
Imagine new system builders ire as they notice that boards had a documentation flaw.
A recent flub had people connecting an IDE LED to the reset.
Over 1/2 those boards were RMA'd over such.
The motherboard marking was correct, but this error has been seen on many boards.
You should examine the markings on the motherboard for the power on switch and consider that many can't test said push button with an Ohmmeter.
