Before spending money on a new burner, there is one possible solution you should have tried.
Most burners, whether they be CD or DVD or CD/DVD Combos, need to be set as master and any CD-ROM, or in your case, DVD-ROM drives set as slave.
The fact that it worked awhile back means nothing in this case.
When first installed, they can do that but very soon will stop operating properly.
I am willing to bet that if you were to go inside your computer and switch them, both drives would work properly.
When you turn on your computer, it will automatically make the changes in your setup.
If you install your new burner in the same setup you have now, with it as slave, and it doesn't work, try the solution above.
