sorry i didn't post about my power supply specs, it's a sparkle power inc 350w.
i plan on upgrading the power supply, because of this video card.
my computer is an hp m1170n media center pc.
it uses a 24 pin atx power connection for the motherboard.
only problem, because of the size of the video card, it's blocking four of the motherboards atx power pins.
i believe these have to be pins 1-4, which are important for operating the computer.
i don't know if there is a work around for this?
those pins have to be powered, if not the computer can't run.
if you go here:  .
that will show what the layout of my motherboard is.
it's the way the atx power connector was placed on the motherboard, that the video card gets in the way.
i know it's a laugh, because of the overall specs of my desktop.
i can see why the video card won't fit.
that's why i'm never getting a brand named desktop again.
i would rather build one like i've always wanted to.
any help would be great on what to do..
