well, i know i am in over my head here.
i would have no worries if it had not shut off(once it went blank and once the screen scrambled) twice within ten minutes this morning.
yes, it restarted each time, but i figure it will keep shutting off sporadically.
so i have read that you take each card out except video and test the computer to find out if it is the mb or a card you fried.
maybe i should find an expert to look at it.
but a new dell 2400 cost about $350.
would it be worth it to buy a new mb and have it installed professionally?
testing ram?
btw, i never knew you had to test ram .
i had an old system around the house but it wasn't the same so i figured the ram would not work in it.
i got it from crucial so i figured it would be good ram.
maybe good ram, bad operator....
