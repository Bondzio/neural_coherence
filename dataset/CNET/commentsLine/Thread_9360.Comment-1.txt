hello, world.
i just bought a used, 120gb wd passport on ebay.
the seller was a vista user and didn't reformat the drive before sending it to me.
i tried the hdd on my xp pc, and though the power light came on and the computer recognized it, i couldn't see it in explorer.
when i go into disk management, i can see it there, but when i right click on it all the options - including format - are greyed out.
the drive works fine on my vista laptop though.
when i went into disk management there with the drive connected, i could see it and reformat it.
so i did, but when i plugged it back into my pc it still didn't appear in explorer.
i've also tried a fix i read in some other forum - disabling my 1394 connection and rebooting, but that didn't work either.
i need the drive to work on both systems so i can transfer files from my pc to my laptop.
i'd appreciate any help.
