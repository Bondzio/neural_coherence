This happens with picture files in the Windows Explorer..... jpg, gif, etc..
I haven't tried printing a web page and I'm not sure about txt files (although the test page prints fine).
This is a problem on my dad's computer - he prints a lot of pictures.
I tried a number of them and it happens every single time.
Actually, it not only happens when trying to print pictures straight out of the Windows Explorer, but also when trying to print from a special program for scanning pictures, editing them, and so on.
To explain it again... when printing a picture, it should be right in the middle of the printing page.
But it ends up being shifted to the side, so that half of it is &quot;out of bounderies&quot; of the page and obviously gets cut off (while the closer half is right by the edge).
