to coincide with your proposed strategy.
Like you, I want to back it all up and restore it all in as little time as possible if the primary drive should become corrupt beyond repair or fail.
I don't want to spend time finding all the CDs, the product keys, reloading the OS, the MB and periperhal drivers, all the application software, set all the defaults etc., etc.,.
Makes me tired even thinkin' about it.
I create compressed, restorable images of my drive C (OS and APPs) and D (ALL DATA) to a second internal HDD.
I also put copies of those images on an external HDD as well.
It has really really served my well.
