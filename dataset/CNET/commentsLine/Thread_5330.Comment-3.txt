of ups's.
one is always using the battery to power the output while the battery is constantly being float charged.
the other actually transfers from one to the other.
if this transfer is the problem, it may be possible to go into the pc's bios and change the power management settings.
maybe set it so that the power off button has to be held in for 4 secs before it will turn the system off.
one thing about an atx system is that if you shut it off, you must wait a short time [maybe 10 or so seconds] before you can turn it on.
has to do with the discharge of capacitors in the power control circuits.
possibly the ups causes it to momentarily shut off and then the voltage comes back before the turn on logic will work properly.
of course, this still means a reboot which is not at all what the purpose the ups is supposed to do.
