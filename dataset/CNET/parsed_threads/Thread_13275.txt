<s> Here's my situation. </s>
<s> Small business running a Windows 2000 server with 8 clients. </s>
<s> Server is the PDC and acts as a file server (everone stores most of their files on the server) and also acts as an FTP server. </s>
<s> The FTP server traffic is sporadic, but sometimes we use it to transfer some rather large files. </s>
<s> The server also acts as an App server for 1 application. </s>
<s> Right now we're on a 10/100 network (all computers connect at 100) with 2 switches (have to have 2 because of the way the wall outlets are situated) all behind a DSL router. </s>
<s> I'm wondering if it would make a noticeable difference if I upgrade the network to a Gigabit network. </s>
<s> It would cost about $675 for the new cards and switches and labor. </s>
<s> We already have cat 5e cabling. </s>
<s> The network doesn't really run under a heavy load, but I do transfer some large files over the network in my every day work and I was thinking that might speed up. </s>
<s> Any thoughts or experience in the matter? </s>
<s> Thanks! </s>

<s> Consider coax. </s>
<s> It has a higher bandwidth than 5E. </s>
