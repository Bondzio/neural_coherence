<s> I'm replacing our 4-year-old Vista 32-bit 2GB RAM desktop. </s>
<s> We use it for web browsing, email, word processing and storage of photos, music and video. </s>
<s> No gaming. </s>
<s> I find it is getting slow at waking up, web browsing, switching between applications, and switching between users. </s>
<s> I'm not a geek. </s>
<s> I basically limit myself to running msconfig and turning off unnecessary things. </s>
<s> I have also plugged in RAM and other cards, but that's about it. </s>
<s> I expect the biggest resource hog on our system is Office 2010 Professional. </s>
<s> I just purchased an HP Pavilion P6-2125 and am getting it ready to swap over. </s>
<s> It seems to be much faster at tasks, but it is, after all, right out of the box. </s>
<s> I am thinking of adding another 4GB of RAM to the 4GB that is already there. </s>
<s> Will I notice a difference when waking it up, web browsing, switching between applications, and switching between users? </s>
<s> I'm looking at Kingston ValueRAM, but someone suggested Corsair CML4GX3M1A1600C9. </s>
<s> The Corsair is well reviewed for gaming and overclocking, but we don't do that. </s>
<s> Also, since I assume that the factory-installed 4GB is probably not a high performance stick, I wonder if adding the Corsair would cause problems. </s>
<s> Any opinions are welcome. </s>
<s> Here are the specs I think are relevant: Windows 7 Home Pro 64-bit According to HP: Dual channel memory architecture Two 240-pin DDR3 DIMM sockets Supports up to 8GB on 64-bit systems Thanks! </s>

<s> Your mobo has 2 ram slots. </s>
<s> Your mobo supports dual channel. </s>
<s> I'll take a guess that both slots are in use. </s>
<s> If that's true you can't add more ram to the existing ram. </s>
<s> What you will need to do is remove the installed sticks........2x2GB? </s>
<s> Install new sticks.......2x4GB. </s>
<s> If you want to do this......look here. </s>

<s> for Excel and Access. </s>
<s> So given the cost to upgrade and the fact you have only got 2 DIMMs slots ..... here's what I'd get. </s>
<s> http://www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx?model=Pavilion%20p6-2125&Cat=RAM You would have to remove the RAM that came with the PC ... and install the 2 new DIMMs. </s>
<s> Since the PC is under warranty ....you may want to keep the original RAM until the warranty expires in the unlikely event you have a problem with the machine and have to return it. </s>

<s> Those were very good points, so I opened the tower and, voila! </s>
<s> only 1 slot is occupied by a 4GB stick made by Hynix. </s>
<s> I took it out and scanned both sides for really good images, it but it seems that this forum has no way to upload files... </s>
<s> According to Wikipedia Hynix is: &quot;the world's second-largest memory chipmaker and the world's sixth-largest semiconductor company... </s>
<s> Formerly known as Hyundai Electronics&quot;&lt;div&gt; I googled &quot;compatible with Hynix ram&quot; but didn't get anything helpful... </s>
<s> So I'm back to my original question: any tips on what 4GB desktop RAM to get to run alongside this Hynix RAM? </s>
<s> &lt;/div&gt; Thanks again. </s>
<s> Two ways to do this. </s>
<s> You can buy a stick that is the same speed as the installed ram and hope the two sticks will play nice together. </s>
<s> Or. </s>
<s> If you have 40 bucks you can remove the original stick and install a 8GB kit. </s>
<s> The kit will have two matched sticks that will play nice together and use the dual channel feature with no fuss. </s>
<s> 1600 speed is the max your machine will support.......that's the target I'd shoot for. </s>
<s> In your other post you talk about testing this for best perf. </s>
<s> W7 comes with a bench mark tool called.....windows experience index......run that thru google. </s>
<s> You can use that and test different configs of ram.......see what the tool shows. </s>
<s> difficult that it may appear and most of us with experience recommend just biting the bullet and getting the matched RAM from a reliable source as suggested above. </s>
<s> If you're going to all this trouble....best to put the odds of success on your side. </s>
<s> Even if you went back to the PC Mfg....to get another DIMM, chances are it wouldn't be from the same mfg with the same specs....latency, voltage, etc.,. </s>
<s> Always best to get all that you need at time of purchase or upgrade later with a kit of matched DIMMs from a reliable source.. Let us know how it works out. </s>
