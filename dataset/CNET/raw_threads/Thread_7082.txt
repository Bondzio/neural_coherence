I have my XBOX 360, Blu Ray and HDTV Cable box connected to the back of my tv with 3 HDMI cables. The tv has an optical out so I have an optical cable to my reciever so all those things are in surround sound. I have my desktop connected to the tv with a VGA, the audio is connected from the headphones jack to an auxillary port (RCA). I have some DVD backups on my hard drive and I would like to get the sound instead of standard stereo to be 5.1. The problem is the only port I have left on my older receiver is the composite audio which is an older technology but would give me what I want. I searched everywhere on the internet and the only audio cards I could find have optical out, hdmi, or the computer speakers 5.1 style. I will probably have to get an older card from ebay since this technology is kind of dated but if anyone can point me in the direction of a specific one I would be so very greatful.

That's actually what I have, I have a headphone jack to (Red and White) RCA cables but that only produces 2.0 stereo. I AM LOOKING FOR A PCI CARD FOR MY DESKTOP COMPUTER THAT HAS A COMPOSITE AUDIO OUTPUT WHICH WILL PRODUCE 5.1 SURROUND SOUND.
