1.1.1	I have a hp photosmart p1000 printer that has a slot for a compact flash card.	St
1.1.2	It has always worked.	St
1.1.3	But now when I put the card in, it will read it and say how many photos are on it but when I push the save button on the printer, it says looking for pc a couple of times and then says pc is not connected.	St
1.1.4	But it is because I can print from it.	St
1.1.5	any suggestions?	St
1.2.1	uninstalling and re-installing.	St
1.2.2	What has transpired since it worked?	St
1.2.3	You might also see if there is any information and/or driver updates from HP.	St
