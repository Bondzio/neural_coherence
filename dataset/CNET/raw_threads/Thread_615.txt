We have this &quot;Cisco security agent&quot; that won't let me run the executible file ( http://www.usr.com/support/product-template.asp?prod=5411 ) I know my company doesn't support this type of arrangement but I know so many people who use it. Is there any way around this? Is there a way I can trick the card to work without running this .exe file?
