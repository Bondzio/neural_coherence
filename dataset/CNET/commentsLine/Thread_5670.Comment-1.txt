hi, i have a strange issue... last month or so i noticed that the battery level (when the adapter was plugged in too) indicated 99% and didn't go over that level... however, if i disconnected the adapter and let the battery level fall under 95%, when i plugged it in again it did go to 100% again.
after hibernating though it fell to 99% again... i thought i might try to calibrate, and now it shows 98% and won't go over that level (with the adapter plugged in)... is there an explanation?
thanks!
ps: i have a gigabyte netbook.
