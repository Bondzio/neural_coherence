<s> In my motherboard manual it says PC1600 DDR ram but my local computer store only sells PC133 DDR ram or PC 400 DDR (think that is right) ram. </s>
<s> Motherboard in question is an MSI KT2 Combo. </s>
<s> Has 2 DDR and 2 SD ram slots. </s>
<s> They constantly say they can't supply PC1600 ram and I am wondering what the actual differences are? </s>
<s> I was wondering if it is really worth the effort to hunt down the exact type of memory listed in my user manual. </s>
<s> http://www.msi.com.tw/program/products/mainboard/mbd/pro_mbd_detail.php?UID=408 The specifications for your motherboard indicate the following memory is compatible: Two modules of PC1600 or PC2100 DDR SDRAM (184 pins) -OR- Two modules of PC100 or PC133 SDRAM (168 pins) * * * * * DDR SDRAM (DDR for short) is a different type of memory than simple SDRAM DDR memory http://www.crucial.com/kb/answer.asp?qid=4003 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR_SDRAM slowest &lt; PC1600 &lt; PC2100 &lt; PC2700 &lt; PC3200 &lt; fastest * * * * * The fastest RAM that your motherboard can support is PC2100 RAM. </s>
<s> HOWEVER, Since memory makers have decided that it isn't profitable to make the slower (and older) PC1600 and PC2100 RAM anymore, you will have a difficult time finding it in stock. </s>
<s> No need to worry because DDR RAM is backwards compatible, and you could use PC2700 or possibly PC3200 modules in a board that calls for PC2100. </s>
<s> Reference: http://www.crucial.com/kb/answer.asp?qid=4127 For Windows XP, get that computer up to 512MB or 1GB or memory. </s>
<s> RAM is referred to by 2 different means IE: PC2700 = 333 MHz (or DDR333) You'd be best to go to http://www.crucial.com/ and use the on-line scan to determine your needs. </s>
<s> Spend some time on that site to get an underatnding of RAM designations. </s>
<s> A Google never hurt either!! </s>
<s> And YES it does matter - you need the excact RAM! </s>
<s> And NO, I never heard of a motherboard that will support both SDRAM & DDR RAM (SDRAM is for older machines - like 5yrs & older.) </s>
<s> Board that supports 2 types of RAM!! </s>
<s> Didn't do my homework - it's Sunday Night! </s>
<s> I purchased what was affordable at the time and now have 512 mb of PC400 DDR ram. </s>
<s> My motherboard has 2 DDR sockets and 2 SD sockets so you can use one or the other but not both. </s>
<s> Also I built this machine from the board up so I know a lot more then the casual user. </s>
<s> And it's been fun because I am always pottering around with it and upgrading things here and there. </s>
