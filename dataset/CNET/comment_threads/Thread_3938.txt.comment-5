I've got a friend who wanted me to do a few updates to his eMachines computer.
It currently has a Celeron D processor, and he bought a Pentium D 805.
They're both LGA 775, so that's not a worry, and I believe the mobo can handle the upgrade without a BIOS update.
However, he doesn't have a copy of Windows XP, and I wasn't sure if he would need to buy one or not just to upgrade his processor.
I've already done a few things to the computer, like upgrading the power supply and installing a different graphics card.
I was just hoping I could install the processor without reinstalling XP.
Here's a question: if I swapped the processors out, and it didn't like the upgrade, couldn't I just put the Celeron back in without any problems?
