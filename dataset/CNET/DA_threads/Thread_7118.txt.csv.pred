1.1.1	A computer ( desktop ) I 'm looing at has an Integrated video card and I was wondering if it is something I can upgrade or if by integrated it means its interated in the motherboard ? ? ?	Ques
1.1.2	Any help would be great ! ! !	St
1.1.3	Thanks	Polite
1.2.1	but if it has expansion slots , ie pci , pci-express , or agp , than an upgrade is possible .	St
1.2.2	Roger	St
1.3.1	Thank you for the info !	St
1.3.2	Now another question , if I were to install in a better card in a pci-e slot would the computer use both of the video cards ?	Ques
1.3.3	Or just the better one ?	Ques
1.3.4	Thanks again	St
1.4.1	NIL	St
1.5.1	get a far better one , you may need to get a higher wattage Power Supply .	St
1.5.2	You also may have problems cooling the system if you have have one of the cute , but tiny , cases such as used by HP , Dell , Compaq , Esystems , et al .	St
1.5.3	You might want to post the name and model of your system and which card that you are considering .	Sug
1.6.1	http : //www.shopping.hp.com/webapp/shopping/product_detail.do ? product_code=EL472AA % 23ABA & tab=detailed_specs & storeName=computer_store & landing=computers & category=desktops/hp_pavilion/a1300_series/a1330e_series & subcat1=rts & catLevel=5 # defaultAnchor and I wanted to upgrade the video card to a Nvidia Geforce 7800GTX PCI-E Would that work or no ?	Ques
1.6.2	Thank again !	St
1.6.3	Steph	St
1.7.1	Specs indicate the PC has a PCIe slot however adding such a high wattage video card to an off the shelf box without knowing the power supply specs could be a recipe for an unstable PC without a warranty .	St
1.7.2	VAPCMD	St
1.8.1	I want to use the computer primarily for gaming .	St
1.8.2	I had a previous post of a computer I built using the HP website and I had a Intel Dual processor in it but I was quickly informed that AMDs are much better and after seeing the proof I decided to go with a AMD .	St
1.8.3	Now that I want an AMD tho I 'm having a hard time finding somewhere I can build a AMD with the price range I 've got ( $ 1300- $ 1600 ) and get the video card I want as well .	St
1.8.4	If that pre built HP wont work , what sort of components are crucial to make sure it can handle the Nvidia Geforce 7800GTX ?	Ques
1.9.1	Take a look here ... http : //www.pcper.com/hwlb.php ? & guide2=y # guide2 You can mix and match , add or subract , as desired .	St
1.9.2	The one thing you might want to consider is 2GBs RAM ... for that reason ... go to Tomshardware.com and read the article on 'How Much Ram ' ... . My observation is go to the MAX RAM you think you might want upfront ... then you wo n't have to worry about adding later and matching speeds , brands and using 2 DIMM slots vs. 4 DIMM slots .	St
1.9.3	The other thing is the RAPTOR is a great drive ... however its outrageously expensive .	St
1.9.4	You could easily save yourself some big $ $ on the drive upfront and add one later if you really decide you want to put out the extra dough .	Sug
1.9.5	In lieu of the 150GB RAPTOR ... you could also get a 74GB RAPTOR and a good 200-300GB hard drive to go with it and have $ $ left over .	St
1.9.6	With a system like you want ... you need someplace to store your system backup ... 2nd internal hard drives are great for that purpose .	St
1.9.7	Once you pick out the components ... post it for comment ... believe me you 'll get plenty .	St
1.9.8	The only problem is knowing which comments are factual and worth considering further or just people repeating what they 've 'heard ' .	St
1.9.9	Other sites with interesting reviews ... HTTP : //WWW.ANANDTECH.COM HTTP : //WWW.TOMSHARDWARE.COM HTTP : //WWW.XBITLABS.COM Hope this helps VAPCMD	St

1.11.1	Since you have such other good components , I think it 'd do shame not to have a ASUS A8N-SLi Premium , or even Deluxe in there .	St
1.11.2	But , what is the make on the one you have got now ?	Ques
1.11.3	~Ibrahim~	St
1.12.1	Mixed feelings , here 's why : 1 .	St
1.12.2	The MB listed & quot ; NF4SLI-A9 & quot ; ... .not a review found anywhere not even on the BIOSTAR website .	St
1.12.3	However I did find a reference to a BIOSTAR N4SLI-A9 on BIOSTAR website ( below ) and a product under that model number is available at NEWEGG ( link further below ) .	St
1.12.4	Suggest reading the buyer reviews to see what they say about the BIOSTAR & quot ; N4SLI-A9 & quot ; .	St
1.12.5	http : //www.biostar-usa.com/mbdetails.asp ? model=n4sli-a9 http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16813138253 Think I 'd rather look for another MB for the heart of my system .	St
1.12.6	2 .	St
1.12.7	The Ultra PS is not one of PSs that I typically recommend .	St
1.12.8	They 're a new or relatively new brand and I have n't seen enough on them to justify put one a high end PC .	St
1.12.9	Besides it 's a modular PS that many DO NOT RECOMMEND simply because it 's modular and offers additional failure points Here 's a site that has some good info on PS that warrant reading .	St
1.12.10	http : //www.rose-hulman.edu/~freemawa/featured/psu/trusted.php & quot ; Modular power supplies Yes , they 're pretty .	St
1.12.11	And removing unused cables can be easier than tucking them out of the way .	St
1.12.12	But be careful .	St
1.12.13	Part of the problem is inherent in the supplies being modular : adding another connection adds another source of resistance , another possible point of failure , and just one more thing to go wrong .	St
1.12.14	The bigger part of the problem is that most of these supplies are absolute garbage .	St
1.12.15	If you take junk and make it worse , it 's still junk .	St
1.12.16	The market leader in modular supplies has been Ultra with their X-Connect line .	St
1.12.17	And their X-Connect line is unequivocably terrible ( it was n't , originally , but it is now ) .	St
1.12.18	So if you are going to go this route , spend the money on a quality supply & quot ; The best of the best is & quot ; PCPower and Cooling & quot ; .	St
1.12.19	If you can find one of those at a price you 're comfortable with .. that 's the way to go .	St
1.12.20	If not , take a look at the Seasonic S-12 500 or 600 .	St
1.12.21	They seem to get great reviews wherever they 're rated .	St
1.12.22	Fortron Source is also good too .	St

1.12.24	Really want/need RAID 0 ? ? ?	Ques
1.12.25	And if YES ... how will you back it up ?	Ques
1.12.26	I 'd much rather have a standard drive system and reduce the risk of corruption and data loss .	St
1.12.27	In a RAID ZERO ... there is NO REDUNDANCY WHATSOEVER ... the files are split on two or more drives .	St
1.12.28	Any drive failure under RAID 0 means you lose it all unless it 's backed up somewhere else ... ergo the reason I suggested something like a 74GB RAPTOR as a primary boot drive with the OS , APPs and DATA and a second HDD for backup .	St
1.12.29	Last but NOT LEAST ... ..there are new AMD processors ( Socket AM2 ) coming out soon that will also use differnt RAM DDR2 .	St
1.12.30	if you can wait for that ... you might be better off toward future ugradability-expansion .	St
1.12.31	Hope this helps VAPCMD	St
1.13.1	Right now all I have is an older Dell laptop that does n't play much of anything and an ever older HP desktop that is so old I do n't even use it any more .	St
1.13.2	This would be my first half decent computer , that 's why I 'm trying so hard to work it out so that I do n't end up with some thing that wont be any good a week after I buy it .	St

Motherboard : Asus A8N-SLI Premium nForce4 SLI Audio/GB Processor : AMD Athlon 64 FX-55 Hard Drive : Western Digital Caviar SE16 WD3200KS 320GB 7200 RPM SATA 3.0Gb/s Video Card : Geforce 7800GTX 256MB GDDR3 PCI Express x16 Sound Card : Creative Sound Blaster Audigy2 ZS SB0350 7.1 Channels PCI Interface Power Supply : Antec TRUEPOWERII TPII-550 ATX12V 550W Memory : CORSAIR XMS 1GB ( 2 x 512MB ) 184-Pin DDR SDRAM DDR 400 ( PC 3200 ) Unbuffered Dual Channel Kit System Memory Model TWINX1024-3200C2PT ( x2 ) To make this eats up EVEY penny I have to spend on a computer .	St
1.15.1	Sorry .	St
1.15.2	I personally like the A8N-SLi as it has most of the features found in the Deluxe and Premium versions .	St
1.15.3	How about a X2 4400+ instead of the FX-55 ?	Ques
1.15.4	It is only about .4GHz slower , and it has two of them .	St
1.15.5	Bigger cache , as well .	St
1.15.6	That 'll shave some more .	St
1.15.7	That is alot of space ... You could save by maybe bringing it to a 200GB .	St
1.15.8	Your call .	St

St
1.16.4	If you drop the sound card and get the X2 4800+ you 'll save about $ 181 + $ 75 = $ 266 ... that should be enough to get 2GB RAM and 2 hard drives .	St
1.16.5	Then add the sound blaster later..it 's an easy add and a much better way to do this .	St
1.16.6	Video Card : Geforce 7800GTX 256MB GDDR3 PCI Express x16 Scratch the sound card ... use the onboard as an interim and get 2GB RAM upfront .	St

1.19.2	.	St
1.19.3	.	St
1.19.4	it 's a bigger price difference than performance difference .	St
1.19.5	With your system ... you 've already offset most of that with the 2GBs RAM .	St
1.19.6	-- re drives ...	St
1.19.7	The primary drive in my system setup is usally smaller than the secondary drive .	St
1.19.8	I put the OS and the APPs on drive 0 partition 1 ( C : ) and my data on drive 0 partition 2 ( D : ) .	St
1.19.9	This way I can backup the OS and APPs or the DATA or the entire hard disk using GHOST 2003 .	St
1.19.10	The images ..usually multiple copies of images , are stored on drive 1 .	St
1.19.11	That 's partly the reason I suggested the 74GB RAPTOR as drive 0 ( OS and APPS ) if that might be large enough and whatever fits the bill for drive 1 ... the bigger the better until the cost/MB gets too high .	St
1.19.12	Usually the best buys per/GB seem to be in the 200-300GB range .	St
1.19.13	If drive 0 gets corrupt and I ca n't restore point it or correct it , I just pull the last image of drive 0 partition 1 and simply put it back on C : If drive 0 dies ... then I replace it and use the same technique to restore both C : and D : .	St
1.19.14	I actually take that one step further and put copies of the mages on an external USB drive ... just in case and the system is protected by a good UPS .	St
1.19.15	This method minimzes downtime and avoids spending hours and hours finding CDs , locating product keys , loading the OS , the drivers , the APPs , set all the preferences , and then get to the WEB and do all the SW updates .	St
