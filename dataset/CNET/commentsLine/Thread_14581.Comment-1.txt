hello, i have a home network with router linksys wrtu54g-tm.
i have moved my home-office upstairs and would like to use d-link tm-g5240 as a wireless bridge that would connect 3 wired computers and 1 wired printer to the network.
i have tried configuring the tm-g5240 according to the owners manual, but the manual is decidedly thin on details.
the last thing i did was to give the d-link tm-g5240 a static ip address on the home network (192.168.
0.140), and to communicate on the same channel (6) to the home network ssid on the linksys wrtu54g-tm ip address (192.168.0.1) using the correct wpa password.
when i try to renew the ip address of a wired computer i see activity on both the wireless and port lights on the tm-g5240.
the wired computer never gets a good ip address.
instead it gets a 169.x.x.x address.
please help
