I don't know too much about what your software needs, so I apologize if I'm wrong.
You're going to need 1 GB of memory, 2GB would help.
You probably could use a quadro ro firegl card with at least 128mb memory.
However, those cards are somewhat pricy, so stick to what you can afford.
I would also get a dual-core cpu, like the Athlon 64 X2.
Monitor size depends on what you view, more is better so whatever you can get is good.
Unlike a computer system, you can keep using a monitor for years so I'd put more money into the monitor size, at least 19&quot;.
