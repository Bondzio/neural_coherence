<s> Hi all, Fun way to start my day. </s>
<s> Tried to turn on the computer [I never turned it off] and NOTHING. </s>
<s> Diagnosed bad power supply. </s>
<s> So I replaced the power supply and figured all was well and good, until I got past the post and received the old &quot;No Boot Disk Found&quot; routine. </s>
<s> I swapped the SATA connectors from Gigabyte's GSATAII0/1 [3Gbps] ports to the regular SATA ports, and now the BIOS sees the drives [1 HDD/1 Optical]. </s>
<s> Fine and good right? </s>
<s> But no! </s>
<s> Post takes longer, and when Windows 2000 got past its logo screen, it jumped to blue screen. </s>
<s> I'm familiar with 2K doing that when you make a major hardware change, etc. </s>
<s> So, my hunch is that 2K doesn't like the switch from the GSATAII0/1 slots to the regular SATA slots. </s>
<s> Problem is the BIOS isn't seeing any drives attached to the GSATAII0/1 slots. </s>
<s> I can't find any BIOS settings that could cause this phenomenon, even using Ctrl+F1 to access Gigabyte's notorious hidden settings. </s>
<s> Nonetheless, I can't think of any reason why an overnight blowen power supply would cause a BIOS setting change. </s>
<s> Anyway, I'd like to get my 2K HDD bootable again, and I'm wondering why the GSATAII0/1 ports have stopped recognizing attached devices. </s>
<s> My hunch is either that whatever caused the power supply failure caused the GSATAII0/1 ports to malfunction [in which case I'm taking Gigabyte up on its warranty] or there is a setting change that I missing. </s>
<s> Any thoughts on this mystery? </s>
<s> Incidentally, In the meantime, I have loaded XP to a fresh HDD, using the regular SATA ports [still a slower POST then when things were working fine with 2K], and am happy to report that my data is safe on the original 2K boot drive. </s>
<s> Gigabyte Board GA-965GM-S2 </s>
<s> They do fail so it's the cheap fix. </s>
<s> I imagine especially susceptible when there has been an event which has caused a power supply failure. </s>
<s> This is the first board I have used these slots on, but they definitely seem to pep up the post. </s>
<s> Does it make sense to you too that a change from a GSATAII0/1 port to a general SATA port would be enough to throw 2K off and go to blue screen on boot? </s>
<s> All versions of Windows tend to dislike IDE or SATA port changes. </s>
<s> If you can bear the thought of losing that copy look up &quot;WINDOWS 2000&quot; REPAIR INSTALL on google.com These are the articles I use to correct the OS short of a full install. </s>
<s> Bob </s>
<s> Thanks Bob, I appreciate the confirmation. </s>
<s> I'll probably just warranty out the board. </s>
<s> Even if I stay with the new XP install [always nice to clean house and start fresh], I'd prefer a fully functioning board. </s>
<s> What the heck? </s>
<s> It's just postage. </s>
<s> Anyway, thanks again! </s>
<s> Always good to gain more tips and tricks. </s>
