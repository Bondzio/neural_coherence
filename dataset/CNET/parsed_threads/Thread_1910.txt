<s> I recently purchased this processor: http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=5619575&CatId=4348 I recieved it today and put it in and my computer would not start. </s>
<s> I'm pretty sure that it's compatible with my mobo because the description on the bus type says it's an &quot;AMD Athlon 64x2 model&quot; and on Acer's website for my cpu's specs says &quot;Processor: AMD AM2 Athlon 64 x 2 or Athlon 64 or Sempron (940 pin)&quot; (here's the link: http://support.acer.com/acerpanam/desktop/0000/Acer/AspireT180/AspireT180sp2.shtml )I did notice that it got very hot pretty quickly. </s>
<s> This is my first time replacing a cpu so I'd appreciate all the help I can get . </s>
<s> Also my mobo cpu socket type is AM2 and the CPU is AM2+. </s>
<s> I read that AM2+ is backwards compatible with AM2. </s>
<s> Is this true or not? </s>
<s> If not then Doh &gt;.&lt; My bios is up to date with the bios acer released so I dunno if that is the problem. </s>
<s> Such changes are &quot;great it works&quot; as well as &quot;it didn't work.&quot; As the BIOS is current your result is the later. </s>
<s> Upgrading laptop CPUs tend to work out or not. </s>
<s> Since we can't force the maker to support other CPUs my advice is get your money back. </s>
