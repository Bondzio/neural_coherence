I have a desktop with a 1.2 Ghz Athlon processor (Thunderbird I _believe_) with 384 (256+128) RAM.
No idea about the motherboard, do you know how I can find some stats about it?
Anyway, running Windows XP.
Sometimes it gets a bit sluggish when I have a lot programs open.
Will upping the RAM to 512 or 768 be worth the money?
Its SD-RAM, by the way.
