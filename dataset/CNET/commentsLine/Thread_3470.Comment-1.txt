i have a amd athlon 64 x2 dual core processor 5200+ (2.70ghz) 2gb of ram, a 650watt power supply and an open pci-e slot i was just curious would my computer be able to handle a graphics card like the nvidia geforce gtx 560/570/580?
i used to have an ati radeon hd 4850 but its gone now.
just wondering what restricts someone from running a powerful video card?
thanks!
