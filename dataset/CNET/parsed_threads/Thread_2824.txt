<s> So I do mainly use windows, but for programming and as a development server I like to use linux. </s>
<s> I just built a new machine, and all was well and good until I needed linux. </s>
<s> I put in the may 2007 edition of ubuntu and started up under the disc. </s>
<s> I hit the install button and tried to have it resize my windows partition, which being the greedy little ******* it was had taken up my whole hard drive. </s>
<s> After several hours it was still at the 0% mark, so (Here is probably where it went wrong. </s>
<s> This was pretty stupid of me) I shut down my machine because I couldnt get it to respond. </s>
<s> I thought it turned out all right until I went to my computer in windows and saw that it thought my hard drive was 20 gigs. </s>
<s> I cant figure out how to fix it, so could someone recommend some free software to fix the issue? </s>
<s> Or if xp pro has something built in, that would be even better </s>
<s> Sorry but I don't want to duplicate web content on it's use. </s>

<s> Virtually every problem I have ever asked for help on, you have been there to solve it. </s>
<s> I just wanted to say thanks for all of your help. </s>
<s> Always nice to know if it helps. </s>
