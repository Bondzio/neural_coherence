Proffitt	7/21/11 10:26 AM	1.31124396E12	First, best for the buck link.	http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card-game-performance-radeon-hd-6670,2935.html Even the Radeon HD 6670 at the near 100 buck mark is quite the upgrade here. And it pulls about 124 total system Watts as noted at http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/radeon-hd-6570-radeon-hd-6670-turks,2925-15.html To see if you need a new power supply I'd use a P3 Watt Meter to see what your system draws now (that's about 20 bucks if you don't own one) then you can see if you can skip the PSU upgrade.

With this set up would i be able to run games like crysis in 1920x1200 with playable framerates? Im trying to play higher end games.
12520	3	534709	5171002	5170963	R. Proffitt	7/21/11 12:00 PM	1.3112496E12	Sorry but	I don't discuss dual video cards. This is my choice on the matter. Why? Dual video cards are only for those that must go there and suffer the issues. It's like a tar pit. I don't go into tar pits. Hope this explains my choice on this. If you need more power, use the first link and move up the chain. Then read the review on your selected card to sniff out if you need to replace the PSU. Here I use the Watt meter before and after along with the PSU details on Amperes per rail to make the decision to replace or not replace a PSU. Bob

My brother has it (with Intel i7) and plays all kinds of new games in HD monitor (1920x1200), with all details maxed and at decent frame rates: Get a good PSU. 80 plus means 80% effeciency or higher. Corsair, antech and cooler master is a good choice.

I have no idea what size/type psu you have now.......so just winging it. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139021 Assuming that fits in the machine it should carry you through most future upgrades. The HD 6670....as mentioned...is quite a jump from where you are and may be a simple video card swap with no psu upgrade needed. Might be worth a look..........depends how high up the gaming ladder you want to go.

12520	7	534709	5172291	5171694	F33linR4ndom	7/23/11 2:22 PM	1.31143092E12	Id like to go pretty high to be honest	My budget is up to 400 dollars, more if needed but i dont feel i need the newest or the best, just close to it. I want to be able to run the newest games with decent fps rates maxed settings. I want to play arma 2 specifically.
12520	8	534709	5172293	5172291	R. Proffitt	7/23/11 2:26 PM	1.31143116E12	Then go up the dollars at the link I supplied.	But if you are going dual cards, be sure to locate a vendor that accepts returns!

Your definition still leaves quite a range. First I recommend you look at some general guidelines on how to upgrade a video card. This site has good information about defining wants, system requirements, non-gaming and gaming cards, reviews, and installing video cards at: http://www.upgradevideocards.com/ It will give you a good general information on upgrading your video card and a link to excellent sources. One top link is to the list of the best video cards at each budget level at THG - it includes a brief but very helpful description of which each will buy you: http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-graphics-card,2964.html Based on what little info you have provided, I think you are in the range of the GTX 560 - which is on the above list at the $190 level. I recommend this EVGA (excellent brand) card at $175 after rebate: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130660 You might also be interested in reading a reviews about the GTX 560 card and about mid-level cards in general: http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gtx-560-amp-edition-gtx-560-directcu-ii-top,2944.html http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-radeon-graphics,2977.html As you can see in the article about the GTX 560 - at load the total system usage was 150w - 200w at factory settings. Assuming you have no other power hunger added components, you should be able to comfortably run the system with a PSU at 300w or more - although I would recommend 350w to be safe. This also assumes you have a good PSU. What brand and model do you have?
