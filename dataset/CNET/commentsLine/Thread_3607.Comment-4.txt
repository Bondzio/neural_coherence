prevents getting into any file.
that simply gives the desktop et al settings so that each account has the screen that they prefer.
you can get into any file from either account and even if you skip the account by hiting enter.
i think that xp has a file settings and transfer wizard that'll do it all for you and keep the dll links so that the applications will still work, simply dragging and dropping does not always maintain those links and then you have to reinsall the application [you will not lose the data though].
post this in the xp forum with a very descriptive subject line.
hopefully david chan will see it and provide excellent support.
