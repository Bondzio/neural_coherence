A few yrs.
ago many a CD drive would last longer and the reason is the speed factor.
As drives become more speed-X they have little room for error and &quot;settledown&quot; time is nil and quickly errors out.
However, a basic CD drive is darn cheap nowadays and reflects that, but quality still matters and usually will last longer excludes any other factor.
DVD drives by default are more demanding and quite easily get tossed early after normal wear&tear.
My rule of thunb upon hearing a drive going bad, is it at least 1yr.
and used often, then you got your money's worth if brought with the system.
Plus, now you have the &quot;combo drives&quot; which just allows more possibilites of having a problem, so there you go.
