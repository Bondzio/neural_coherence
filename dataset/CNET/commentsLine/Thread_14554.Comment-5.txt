i went to their site and was so impressed i purchased the pro version.
sharpwitz, geeks.com sells a diagnostic kit that traces the codes during post for under $30.
this gadget installs on a pci slot.
it comes with a booklet containing all the code definitions.
it's helped me a few times.
between the two of them you should be able to isolate the problem.
sorry for the misunderstanding.
and life goes on... jack
