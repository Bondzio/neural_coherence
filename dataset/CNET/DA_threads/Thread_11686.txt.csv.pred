1.1.1	Hello CNet My specs are : Case : Corsair Obsidian 650D Ram : Corsair Vengeance XMS3 - 16gb @ 2133mhz Graphic : MSI TwinFrozr 780 CPU : i7 4770k Haswell @ 3.5ghz CPU Cooler : Corsair H100i SSD : Corsair 180gb GS Power Supply : Corsair AX760i Motherboard : ASUS Maximus VI HERO - Socket 1150 Monitor : BenQ XL2411T @ 144mhz -- -- - My problem today is , I just finished building the PC myself and when I run a game like GRID 2 or Metro : Last Light it does not take more than 5minutes and my PC shuts totally down , then it TRIES to reboot as it does not happen , it shuts down once more even before showing anything on the screen from first attempt to reboot , and then it reboots again and starts up and works again - I do not have any clue to what this problem could be , none of the games I play lagg or show any sign of as the system should be running hot or with defect , it just suddenly stops working as result of the shutdown I have tried : To test the PSU ( as it has a selftest button , it should run fine as the test shows ) To remove 2 of the 4 sticks of ram , to see if this would make a difference .	St
1.1.2	When I first got the PC I ran a 12hour 'stress test ' on the CPU where it 's avrg .	St
1.1.3	tempature was around 37-42 ( Celsius that is ) -- -- When I run a game like GTA IV ( which is from 2008 ) in MAX settings this error does not occour and it runs nice and smooth -- -- If anybody knows ! ANYTHING !	St
1.1.4	to what this problem could be or has had the same error when they 've build a PC themselves - Please post your solution to your problem Thank you in advance .	St
1.2.1	If anybody knows any great test-software that could run tests on the hardware ( CPU , PSU , Graphic , Ram etc . )	St
1.2.2	Preferbly free ones .	St
1.2.3	Please post them here Thank you in advance .	Sug
1.3.1	My bet is the BIOS is out of date to start with .	St
1.3.2	Nice machine but if that 's not it and they did n't detail how to install the OS or drivers , I 'd start RMAing parts .	St
1.3.3	Bob	St
1.4.1	Hey Bob , thank you so much for the reply .	Polite
1.4.2	I want to start off saying , I am NOT a proffesionel when it comes to all this BIOS and software orientated stuff , I just assembled the machine .	St
1.4.3	I did however go to the BIOS and tried a few different RAM settings ( 2133mhz , 1866mhz & 1600mhz ) as I had read on other forums and such that some people talked about RAM speed could have a say in the system .	St
1.4.4	My BIOS 'looks ' quite new , does n't mean it is the newest , of course .	St
1.4.5	I will however look into this new BIOS you speak of , do you know what difference the 'new ' BIOS should have compared to the 'old ' ?	Ques
1.4.6	Thank you in advance .	St
1.5.1	But reading the page there & quot ; .Improve system compatibility. & quot ; It 's an oxymoron that there was something they needed to fix .	St
1.5.2	As presented I ca n't see the build so I ca n't check for issues like an extra motherboard mounting stud so I have to take what is presented and go hunting for issues and found one .	St
1.5.3	RAM speed should be AUTO for folks that just want it to work .	St
1.5.4	And when it does n't you call up and begin the exchange process .	St
1.5.5	Besides that BIOS I 'm seeing some really fresh versions on motherboard and audio and did n't check the rest drivers at http : //www.asus.com/Motherboards/MAXIMUS_VI_HERO/ # support_Download It 's highly unlikely the driver CD in the package is up to date when the driver date I found was 7/3/2013 !	St
1.5.6	Bob	St
1.6.1	Hey Bob , thanks once again .	Polite
1.6.2	I installed the new BIOS and that works fine , did not help my problem though : \ I did however try to run a test on my Graphics card , called 'Furmark ' which is benchmarking the graphicscard to it 's fullest And here I encountered my problem again !	St
1.6.3	- it shut down after less than 30-45seconds , so I think it 's my graphicscard that can not handle the high-end loads as in GRID 2 and Metro : Last Light .	St
1.6.4	Although my graphicscard is a 780 and should have no problem loading these games .	St
1.6.5	and like I wrote at first , it has no problem with the game , besides this , it runs so nice and smoothly - untill it shuts down I 'm not a 100 % sure if this is actually the graphicscard .	St
1.6.6	And do anyone know if this problem could have anything to do with the fact that I bought QUAD channel RAM instead of DUAL - its 4 sticks , 16gb @ 2133mhz Thank you in advance .	Ques
1.7.1	& quot ; Dedicated single +12V rail with user-configurable virtual & quot ; single rail & quot ; and & quot ; multi-rail & quot ; software modes & quot ; It appears that you have choices in the PSU area to make .	St
1.7.2	As I did n't design this computer I ca n't answer which mode is appropriate .	St
1.7.3	I ca n't see the machine so I ca n't tell if the issue is the power or cooling .	St
1.7.4	Try it without the cover and the video card in another slot .	St
1.7.5	Bob	St
1.8.1	Hello again again Bob .	St
1.8.2	The PSU should be able to cover all the needs in this system , I am of cause not a 100 % sure of this , but I ran the & quot ; Self-test & quot ; ( A button to test if the PSU works as it should ) .	St
1.8.3	It should have enough power to run this system .	St
1.8.4	Also the cooling seems very fine , when the Graphicscard fails ( If it even is the Graphicscard ) and shutsdown the tempature is about 60-65 degrees , which is really not that hot .	St
1.8.5	The rest of the system runs very cooled too , I 've bought the Corsair H100i for the CPU , so it runs at around 50 degrees at full load ( when idle about 35-40 ) So as you can see none of these should be the problem , unless its the sensor on the fans/card that fails at 60+ degrees , I have got no idea if that could even be the case , but I start thinking of all these scenarious .	St
1.8.6	I 'll try and put the card in the other PCI-e slot and see if this helps Thanks in advance .	St
1.9.1	& quot ; Dedicated single +12V rail with user-configurable virtual & quot ; single rail & quot ; and & quot ; multi-rail & quot ; software modes & quot ; It appears that the PC 's designer can change the PSU settings .	St
1.9.2	Very odd but up to the designer to sort out .	St
1.9.3	Hope moving the card changes the result .	St
1.9.4	Bob	St
1.10.1	Hello Bob , the error code appeared with a description now , something new !	St
1.10.2	I was doing the change slot thing you spoke of and instead of shutting down this time , it closed the application and an error message appeared !	St
1.10.3	This is the error message : http : //imageshack.dk//viewimage.php ? file=/imagesfree/JjQ27642.png I hope you can help me here , I have found some videos and such , but I am not a 100 % sure of what this failure actually contains and how it could impact the system by fixing it manually Thanks in advance .	St
1.11.1	http : //nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3007/~/opengl-message- % E2 % 80 % 9Clost-connection % E2 % 80 % 9D I read that and came away thinking , well , what it details is not fixable so it 's time to begin the return exchange cycle since no one I know can fix that one .	St
1.11.2	Remember I 'm an electronics designer and software author so while it made sense to me , it was clear that it 's not an error but a message .	St
1.11.3	I 'm unsure what you think of the message but for most it means nothing .	St
1.11.4	That is , furmark is a stress benchmark and furmark 's author would have to reduce the GPU load to avoid this message .	St
1.11.5	As the PC did n't shutdown , furmark is not adding much value here .	St
1.11.6	OK , maybe it 's not clear so here it is .	St
1.11.7	If updates of BIOS and drivers fail we swap boards and parts .	St
1.11.8	http : //www.pcworld.com/article/2040319/build-the-ultimate-intel-haswell-pc-for-under-1000.html notes a GPU I 'd swap to .	St
1.11.9	Bob	St
1.12.1	I did Furmark benchmarking yesterday night too , several times and it did the same as my games did , tried to reboot and then rebooted .	St
1.12.2	Then this morning I swapped my DVI-duallink cable to the other plug on the card and it 's here it gave me error message instead of the shutdown .	St
1.12.3	I 've read on the internet people say this is fixable , because Windows ca n't go with these rendering speeds , not sure if this would actually help though .	St
1.12.4	Also , I 'm running Windows 7 Prof. 64bit and got me thinking , maybe by upgrading to Win8 would help this , if it 's a win7 & Nvidia driver that 's colliding Thanks in advance .	St
1.13.1	But I disagree .	St
1.13.2	HOWEVER changing ports is a good clue but as in all things , go with what works .	St
1.13.3	That is , if you find one video port works better than the next , you use the better solution .	St
1.13.4	There are folk that want to get such a thing fixed and in this discussion it 's something incompatible or out of date or you are beta testing for the makers .	St
1.13.5	That motherboard looks to be very new so what 's to say it 's ready for the market ?	Ques
1.13.6	In summation , if you do n't change drivers and boards , the issue should remain .	St
1.13.7	BOb	St
