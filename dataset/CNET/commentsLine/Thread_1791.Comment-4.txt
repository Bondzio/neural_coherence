it's probably best to make that parallel installation as you outlined.
disconnect the old ide (pata) hd.
connect the new sata hd.
boot to system bios.
enable sata autodetection.
set sata hd as primary boot hd.
set cd drive as first boot device.
boot to xp cd.
tap the f6 key when prompted, so yo may feed the sata/raid driver to the xp installation program.
do you have the sata/raid driver on a floppy yet?
after xp installs and you get it fully updated, reconnect the pata hd and boot to bios.
ensure the sata hd is still the primary boot hd.
exit bios and start windows.
pata hd should appear as a secondary hd in my computer.
if you have permission problems when accessing any folders or files, you need to take owenership .
