i was wondering why windows had started putting out different versions for different hard drives...(and when!)
i have no idea which version of windows is worst, having only used three versions.
as far as the hard drives go, i have an internal western digital that has been okay and an external seagate that has also been okay.
however, from the reviews i read, i would be inclined to go with seagate if given an option (it seems to stand up to general wear and tear slightly better than other brands).
