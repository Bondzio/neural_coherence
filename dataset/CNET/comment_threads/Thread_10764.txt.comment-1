I have an IBM SCSI Internal Hard Drive that I use on a MAC running OS 9.
My computer can no longer read the hard drive.
Whenever I boot up the computer it will crash if the hard drive is installed.
When it is not installed it boots up fine.
The hard drive came with an adapter that I think may be the cause of the problem.
Is this a common problem that can be fixed by purchasing a new adapter?
Below is all the information on the hard drive label: Type: DGHS COMP IEC-950 *ECE32284* *PN59H7013* SN 6810A623GK EMC P/N 072-000-123 11S59H7013ZM1FV110A623 9808 Please let me know if you can help me with this situation.
I've searched the IBM web site but it appears they no longer have a support section for hard drives on their site.
Thanks for any help you can give me.
