1.1.1	For whatever reason my USB-based HP 7300 All-in-One printer, stopped printing.	St
1.1.2	On-board print tests work fine, so it's not the printer.	St
1.1.3	I swapped USB cables, USB ports, and uninstalled / reinstaled the s/w, plus undated my USB drivers.	St
1.1.4	I'd also used this printer periodically on my desktop system and that too stopped printing.	St
1.1.5	I reinstalled it as a network printer and was able to print a test page, but when I sign-on my laptop through my companies VPN, it no longer prints, though the fax, scan and copy capabilities work fine.	St
1.1.6	Our Help Desk says there's no work-around and it won't work through a network connection and VPN.	St
1.1.7	It's most likely the USB port within the printer, and I'm not sure what I can do about that, any suggestions?	St
1.1.8	I'm running XP (SP2) on both my laptop and desktop.	St
1.1.9	Joe	St
1.2.1	Then it may be game over.	St
1.2.2	It's quite proper that the VPN shuts out the network printing.	St
1.2.3	If anyone was able to fix that, then they just discovered a gaping security hole in VPN.	St
1.2.4	(hint, not going to happen.)	St
1.2.5	The cheap fix is likely going to be a new printer if this one is out of warranty.	St
1.2.6	Bob	St
