It seems that your drivers are incorrect and/or the hardware is not compatible with your OS. What OS are you using? Have you tried to update the driver directly from Device Manager? If you bought the modem new it should have come with a driver disk.

I have tryed to update the driver in device manager but still receive the error when the computer boots up to the desktop. the error that i am getting is the msvcp60.dll file is linked to missing export msvcrt.dll_ic_collate_cp the modem never shows up in the device manager only the pci enumerator problem.
