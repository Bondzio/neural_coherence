i was a systems tester in the usaf.
tested operating systems before they were released af-wide.
in other words i broke them until they were fixed.

first burroughs was a b-263.
card input/output.

better quit before lee sends me a nasty note.
btw: that 5mb hard drive was the first time i cracked open a case and installed it myself... with hands sweating, heart thumping and wife looking over my shoulder with a frying pan in her hand in case i screwed it up... and our $4,000 investment.
and life goes on... jack
