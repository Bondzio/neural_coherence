try uninstalling everything that involves the printer.
then go to the epson website and install just the drivers (no other epson junk).
many companies will include their own utilities and junk you dont need.
i have worked on machines where the extra stuff disrupts the driver itself causing the device to not work.
i have seen this on printers, networks adapters, and digital cameras.
so, try installing just the drivers and no other software.
also, epson is a popular brand and may have a driver already in xp.
that was the case with my hp printer and windows installed a universal driver automatically.
so, i would try to: 1. uninstall it and related software 2. unplgg printer from power and computer 3. restart computer 4. plug printer into computer 5. plug printer into power and turn on 6. if it hasnt already happened, the new hardware popup will show up and give it a generic driver.
7.if none of this works, try backing up your data and reinstalling windows.
a fresh copy of windows will definetly fix the problem if all else fails evan
