Your home network Wireless Local Area Network and the kind you find at &quot;Hot Spots&quot; like Starbucks. The other is provided by Verizon, AT&T, and such. You'd be hard pressed to find a laptop without wireless capability for home LANs and hot spots. They have a built in wireless card. For the other provided by &quot;Telcos&quot; requires a separate wireless card purchased from the Telco. For this you pay a fee for a generally slow connection.
