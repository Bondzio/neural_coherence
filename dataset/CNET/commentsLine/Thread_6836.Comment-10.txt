hi, i've had this prob in the past.
i cured it by... go to 'start&gt;control panel&gt;network connections'&gt;right click 'local area connection&gt;properties'.
untick both 'show notification when connected' and 'limited or no connection'.
you could also 'disable' lan i suppose as a belt and braces but you would need to reverse all this if you needed to use lan in future obviously.
hope this helps rgds jj
