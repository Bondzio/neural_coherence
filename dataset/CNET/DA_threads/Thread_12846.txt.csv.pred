1.1.1	Got a new laptop, the CD drive has been acting up horribly.	St
1.1.2	CDs read at an incredibly low speed (like half an hour for a 170MB install) and whenever I try burning a CD I receive an error message.	St
1.1.3	After the error message, the drive will appear to continue doing things indefinitely, and the eject button doesn't work.	St
1.1.4	Is this the drive that is messed up or is it a software problem?	St
1.2.1	Please use it.	St
1.2.2	It's not your problem.	St
1.2.3	Well almost...	St
1.2.4	If you installed Roxio software, there is a bug with whats on the CD distribution that will cause what you complained about.	St
1.2.5	Bob	St
1.3.1	Haven't been using Roxio.	St
1.3.2	I tried with Media Player and Sonic Record Now.	St
1.3.3	I'll contact Dell but I hope I don't have to send my laptop back in because I'm in university right now and I need it.	St
1.4.1	I don't know all software that creates the issue.	St
1.4.2	You can try uninstalling ANY recording software that you installed after getting the machine.	St
1.4.3	But before that, try stopping the imapi service and trying again.	St
